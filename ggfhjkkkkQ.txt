Cure to Evil
Mirrond
Summary:

    All for One has did his absolute best to change his son into a perfect villain. The skills, the contacts, the money. Even the quirk. Now that he officially retired to focus on his family (namely, his beloved if slightly intimidating wife and absolutely adorable adopted daughter that he only had to destroy one yakuza clan to obtain - a bargain, really) he expects his son to become his heir. To have All Might tremble in fear.

    Except, Izuku's definition of villainy sounds oddly antiheroic. Surely, he'll come around eventually. Right?

Chapter 1: The Arrival
Notes:

    The story is finished. I just need to publish it all. It's honestly already fully done on the FF.net, but I decided to share it further. Especially as it's actually not a sequel (more like alternative universe thing) the Ties that Bind is doing fabulously. And yes, it'll be published here as well.

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

UA was THE hero school. The most important, the most famous, and so on. UA produced hundreds of pro heroes in the past, including close to half of the current top ten. It was even the alma mater of All Might, the greatest of all heroes and the Symbol of Peace. 

It was a dream. Midoriya Izuku‚Äôs dream. For many, many years he dreamed of being able to walk its halls and training areas. He loved the heroes, especially All Might! His mom once told him to just open an All Might-themed museum, he had THAT much limited edition merch laying around at home. 

Finally, he managed to realize this dream and got into UA. With many prospective heroes, each of them armed with a wonderful quirk and an unyielding desire to make the world a better place. And a seriously sleep-deprived teacher that was also an underground hero that he happened to be a fan of. 

Midoriya Izuku sets the volume to the max and starts speaking. 

‚ÄúMy name is Legion, and we are the League of Villains.‚Äù He announces, the last of his comrades exiting Kurogiri behind him. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve decided to interrupt your training exercise in order to kill the Symbol of Peace. Although, it seems he‚Äôs absent.‚Äù 

Unfortunately, Midoriya is the only one to appreciate the level of irony that his life is operating on. He is even wearing his favourite All Might hoodie.

Eraserhead shouts to Thirteen to get the students out and then charges down the stairs. A tactical mistake. Sure, there are only a few villains in the USJ main plaza. Sure, they all look barely older than the shocked students crowding next to the entrance. But he is still severely underestimating the people that broke into UA. 

‚ÄúKurogiri, scatter the students.‚Äù Izuku commands, his mask changing his voice. True to his villain‚Äôs name, he set it to change his voice every few seconds. The initial announcement was the only thing he would say with his true voice during the attack. ‚ÄúDecay and Vampire, intercept.‚Äù 

His best friend and his probably-not-a-girlfriend leap forward, engaging a pro-hero in melee combat. Knife and disintegration versus combat scarf and a lot of combat experience. 

Izuku is worried. Extremely worried. Eraserhead is an expert in capture and can deactivate quirks merely by looking at you. He is as famous as an underground hero could get. Thankfully the mask stops Izuku from stuttering and making other noises that are seriously unbecoming of an aspiring criminal mastermind.

On the other hand, it is a horrible match-up for the underground hero. Vampire fights de facto quirkless, and is very good at it. Decay‚Äôs quirk requires five finger contact and is potent enough to end the fight in a single touch - and with Vampire there, Eraserhead can‚Äôt keep it offline constantly, as it would allow the shapeshifting villain to blindside him. 

However, Eraserhead is still a professional hero, with many tricks up his sleeve! He has that object resembling a scarf, that is clearly a very advanced and skill-based capture weapon! It had to take years to master it to this level, and...

‚ÄúLegion.‚Äù Kurogiri appears out of nowhere, interrupting Izuku‚Äôs mumbling (thank god for the voice alteration thing). There is a lot of soot on the warper‚Äôs body armor. ‚ÄúThirteen is incapacitated. The Ingenium‚Äôs brother got out. I sent all the students from the list to the ambush site, but one of them‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes, I can see him.‚Äù Izuku replies, feeling the incoming headache as clean as day. The explosions and ‚ÄòDIE!‚Äô screams are rather noticeable. He didn‚Äôt intend to fight his old bully during the attack. It would hurt Kacchan much more to be teleported away and safely incapacitated by the second team. With ego as fragile as his, treating him as if he wasn‚Äôt worthy of attention would be‚Ä¶ crushing. But since he wants to do it so much‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúBAKUGOU, STOP!‚Äù Eraserhead shouts. He could have just as well tried bargaining with a landslide (its intelligence level and attention spans were comparable with Izuku‚Äôs quirkist bully). 

He goes for the head, of course. Starting with a punch. Straight one. With his right arm. Like always. Izuku grabs it and throws Kacchan over his head, drawing a knife. It is stopped centimeters away from his old bully‚Äôs face with Eraserhead‚Äôs capture scarf, extended to the max. 

‚ÄúYou really are a great hero, Eraserhead.‚Äù Izuku announces, while Vampire stabs the now defenseless teacher in his right side. Secretly he is relieved - the hand moved on his own, he didn‚Äôt plan to almost murder a kid. That would go against the League‚Äôs long-term goals.

Kacchan has enough situational awareness to use his explosions to escape from the trap. 

Decay grabs the underground hero‚Äôs head with all but one of his fingers and rams it into the pavement. Tenko‚Äôs love for excessive violence is there all along, although he is kind enough to not overdo it. And sticks to the plan. 

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt move if I were you, Eraserhead.‚Äù Izuku announces. The teacher halts his attempts at struggling, and stares at him. ‚ÄúDecay‚Äôs quirk is a five point finger matter disintegration. He has all but a single finger on your head. If you move too much and make the fifth one touch you‚Ä¶‚Äù He shrugs. Hopefully this will be enough, he isn‚Äôt here to kill Eraserhead. 

‚ÄúOh, and thank you for distracting your teacher with your antics‚Ä¶‚Äù He turns towards his former bully. He wants to savour the moment. ‚Äú... Kacchan.‚Äù 

The look on Bakugou‚Äôs face is priceless when the recognition settles in. The positive side of being officially dead (together with all your loved ones) is that you don‚Äôt need to hide your name when you turn to villainy. 

‚ÄúD‚Ä¶ DEKU?!‚Äù And now he is reminded why he hates Kacchan so much. If he didn‚Äôt tailor his plan explicitly to avoid non pro-hero casualties, he would have sent Tenko after him. Seeing his bully vanish into dust would be quite cathartic. ‚ÄúYOU QUIRKLESS BASTARD! DIE!‚Äù He leaps forward, accelerating himself with microexplosions. 

Izuku didn‚Äôt think that it was possible. But somehow Kacchan got worse when he wasn‚Äôt looking. When he examined his actions from the perspective of time (they haven‚Äôt seen each other ever since the housefire that ‚Äòkilled‚Äô the Midoriyas), he realized that Bakugou was basically an angry meme made flesh rather than a human being. And somehow, just somehow, he got WORSE. And even more one-dimensional. 

Unbelievable. 

‚ÄúMustard, gas him.‚Äù The last member of the party pulls up a support item resembling a flamethrower and covers the charging student in poisonous gas. It isn‚Äôt a dose enough to kill him, not in a single burst. But it is enough to make him lose control over his limbs and fall to the ground. 

He was too focused on Izuku to notice the attack, apparently. 

‚ÄúSo, can I dust him?‚Äù Tenko announces in the resulting silence. ‚ÄúI want the EXP.‚Äù Eraserhead looks suitably distraught and cornered. 

Izuku is happy about his best friend‚Äôs acting skills. Or, at least, he hopes that Tenko is acting. His desire for destruction and murder are a feature rather than a problem normally, but Izuku can‚Äôt help but be worried about it right now. They are only planning a single murder today, and it's not Eraserhead.

‚ÄúOh, no need to go that far, Decay.‚Äù Izuku says. His mask once again proves useful - it made him sound like a confident mastermind instead of a slightly terrified teenager with a complicated family situation who is WAY over his head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like some information from you, Eraserhead. Where is the Symbol of Peace? According to our intel, he should be participating in this training session. But I don‚Äôt see him.‚Äù

Eraserhead doesn't have time to answer. The entrance bursts open. 

‚ÄúFEAR NOT!!!‚Äù The giant announces with a voice that could shake a mountain. ‚ÄúFOR I AM HERE!!!‚Äù 

He is here. The Symbol of Peace. The number one hero. The All Might. Izuku almost drools for the occasion to see his favourite hero in person. The massive figure radiates both immense strength and undescribable charisma. Makes villains tremble and civilians feel that everything will be alright.

Then Izuku remembers that he is a villain. And that the League has organized distractions to keep All Might occupied elsewhere during the attack, since despite their boisterous claims, they weren‚Äôt here to fight him. 

Izuku bluescreens. This isn‚Äôt part of the plan. 

‚ÄúKurogiri, get Hellhound!‚Äù He shouts, his voice changer making him sound urgent but not panicked. The warpgate opens up and something massive enters the field. The quadrupedal monstrosity of claws and fur, designed with destruction in mind. The most successful second generation Noumu to date. 

It is massive and inhuman enough to give the Symbol of Peace a pause. For about two seconds. Then he charges towards it, too fast for the eyes to follow. 

His first punch generates enough air pressure to make Tenko fly off Eraserhead, who immediately jumps backward, gaining some ground. He is limping noticeably, his costume stained with blood. Not fit for combat anymore. 

Unfortunately for the heroes, Hellhound doesn‚Äôt seem to notice the punch. 

‚ÄúHellhound is a bioengineered superweapon, designed to fight you at your strongest, All Might.‚Äù Izuku announces. Good bluff was a key to success. Then again, what is he supposed to say? ‚ÄòSorry I‚Äôve panicked so much that I had Kurogiri warp in my house dog that has temper issues worse than Kacchan and some illegal upgrades?‚Äô He has an image to uphold, even if the plan is going to hell. 

All Might doesn‚Äôt even flinch. He unleashes a flurry of blows. Hellhound is tanking them nicely, its Shock Absorption holding well. The strength behind the attack is still potent enough to push it back slightly, and each time it attempts to lunge at the Symbol of Peace with his fangs and claws, the attack is either pushed back or deflected. 

The battle is too intense for anyone to interfere. But eventually, it ends. All Might overwhelms the Shock Absorption and sends Hellhound flying through the roof. 

Izuku stares in awe, thinking that All Might is truly the coolest of heroes. Then he reminds himself that the hero just punched out Hellhound and is about to defeat the League. 

The second team picks that very moment to send him a message. A picture displays itself at the side of his vision, Mindscrew, Gentle Criminal and Gremlin making the victory signs next to several incapacitated students. 

This has to wait. 

‚ÄúSo, villains.‚Äù All Might stands up, surrounded by clouds of dust. ‚ÄúAre you going to surrender peacefully? Your ‚Äòsuperweapon‚Äô is done for, after all.‚Äù 

Is he giving them time to surrender, because he can see that most of his enemies were underage? Or‚Ä¶ 

Izuku figures it out. And screams in terror. At least internally. They are so much off the plan that they might as well have no plan at all. 

By sheer stroke of luck, that is the moment when he gets a message that the other teachers - and Thunderbolt, the Number Three Hero - are almost at the USJ. Four minutes until the second phase of the original plan can be executed. 

As Tenko would say, they were getting a continue. He just has to buy some time to make it look natural.

‚ÄúSurrender?‚Äù Izuku asks. ‚ÄúHow about this? If you manage to knock one of us out, the rest will surrender and fully cooperate with the police.‚Äù He can see the sudden sweat on All Might‚Äôs face. 

Few of the students left near the USJ entrance are administering first aid to Eraserhead, who seems to have collapsed due to blood loss. Izuku didn‚Äôt even notice that until now - All Might was really good at drawing attention. 

Izuku should have asked Eraserhead for an autograph instead of trying to interrogate him. Now the occasion is clearly lost. 

The students felt safe to do that, despite the villain presence near them, as the All Might was there. Major miscalculation, though understandable considering that it was ALL MIGHT. 

‚ÄúI would prefer to not use my strength against children.‚Äù All Might is good at acting. Really good. But he doesn‚Äôt know that Legion knows about his limits. 

‚ÄúYou prefer to not use your strength‚Ä¶ or are you unable to do it?‚Äù Cornering All Might is giving him a rather complicated set of emotions. Sure, he isn‚Äôt trying to kill him - it would be counterproductive to the League‚Äôs long term goals, to begin with. Besides, All Might is his idol! But he has to do it, and if he is doing it he can as well do it well.

‚ÄúNo quirk is without weaknesses.‚Äù Izuku speaks confidently. Quirks are his hobby - he loves talking about them, even in such circumstances. ‚ÄúYours is extremely powerful, and appears to be infinitely versatile. There is only a single potential weakness of it that I can think of - you have either a time limit or have a stamina bar, as my friend Decay would say. Which is why I organized all those beautiful distractions for you, in order to tire you out before the attack.‚Äú He sees All Might‚Äôs face flinch, confirming his suspicions. ‚ÄúAnd then I sent in the Hellhound with its Shock Absorption quirk, to weaken you further. So here‚Äôs my theory - you aren‚Äôt punching our lights out‚Ä¶ because you can barely stand upright.‚Äù 

Silence. The students next to Eraserhead - and a conscious but paralyzed Bakugou - look at either Izuku or All Might with growing dread on their faces. They can‚Äôt believe his words - he is a villain, after all. One previously unknown - all members of the League were previously unknown, it is their debut mission. Only Gentle has a reputation, but he was technically hired for the job. But All Might is still standing there, instead of taking them down in a split second. 

Ten seconds until the teachers arrive. He bought enough time with his villainous monologue. 

‚ÄúDecay, Vampire - kill him!‚Äù He shouts. Their attack is delayed by a further second as they are trying to comprehend why Izuku - the All Might‚Äôs number one fanboy - just told them to kill his idol. Then they decide that he has a plan, so they lunge forward. 

‚ÄúKurogiri, phase two.‚Äù He says to the living warpgate. The cloud shifts itself as it prepares for the sudden warp.

The teachers burst into the USJ. They are all pro heroes so they waste no time. Snipe fires at Tenko - first bullet goes through his hand, making Decay yell in pain and jump back from All Might. The next two bullets hit Kurogiri‚Äôs suddenly opened warpgate, and emerge from another part of his body‚Ä¶ right behind Snipe‚Äôs back. 

It isn‚Äôt a mortal wound, but for now, the League of Villains can cross one of the heroes out. Too bad this tactic wouldn‚Äôt work for a third time. Thirteen and Snipe were enough. 

Midnight rushes forward, whip in one hand while the other is ready to unleash her quirk. Present Mic runs sideways, towards the position that would allow him to use his quirk without hitting All Might or the students. 

Cementoss conjures a hundred meter long wall of concrete, separating the League from the All Might. Izuku breathes a sigh of relief. Vampire and Decay retreat.

Then comes Thunderbolt. The current number three hero, and one of the lackeys of the Hero Commission. As far as Izuku‚Äôs knowledge goes, he was regularly ‚Äòinspecting‚Äô the UA at Commission‚Äôs behest as a form of additional oversight over the notoriously independent school - Nedzu‚Äôs empire is small, but people in power are suitably worried about it. 

He wears a rather unoriginal costume, resembling all those pre-quirk ‚Äòspeedster superheroes‚Äô. He even has some thunderbolt decorations over it. Really uninspired, and Izuku suspects that he has stolen most of it from an old hero, O‚ÄôClock. But you don‚Äôt become a number three hero by being incompetent - Izuku questions his morals and aesthetics, but not combat skills. He immediately recognizes Izuku as the ringleader (or perhaps Ingenium‚Äôs brother described him as such?) and goes after him.  

He is fast. Faster than All Might, though lacks his resistance and sheer strength. Of course, getting hit by something at mach whatever is going to knock Izuku out instantly, even if the person behind it would be easily crushed by a quirkless bodybuilder if immobilized. 

But Izuku knows that he is coming. And unlike everything else today, this is personal. And the reason for the League‚Äôs attack.

Reflex Boost. Overhaul.

He feels something in his body change, as it accommodates the quirks he calls upon. Thunderbolt crosses the hundred meters distance in a heartbeat, his leg going for Izuku‚Äôs head to knock him out instantly. 

Reflex Boost gives him enough of a reaction time to raise his hand in defense. His hand touches the incoming Thunderbolt‚Äôs leg for an instant - and that is enough. Overhaul requires nothing more. 

Thunderbolt, the Number Three Hero, is instantly splattered over half of the USJ. Bakugou, who is the closest to Izuku when it happens, is painted red. Only his eyes are spared from the recoloring.

‚ÄúAlways so hot-blooded.‚Äù Izuku, who is trembling internally from shock, terror and joy, announces in the dead silence. ‚ÄúAlthough it‚Äôs just blooded now, I guess.‚Äù He has no idea what he just said. He isn‚Äôt exactly conscious. And internally he is freaking out just as much as everyone around him.

Vampire stares at him like he just descended from the heavens, introduced himself as a god of blood and proposed to her while offering her half of his godhood. Students and half conscious Eraserhead stare at him in terror. Even the other teachers halt their advance, trying to comprehend what just happened. Someone (a student most likely) screams. 

‚ÄúWhat, too soon?‚Äù Izuku decides to dig his grave deeper. ‚ÄúOh, well. Kurogiri, we‚Äôre leaving.‚Äù 

The warpgate embraces him seconds before the Present Mic‚Äôs sonic attack. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúThat was‚Ä¶‚Äù Vampire - known also as Himiko Toga, he isn't letting his friends be villains without proper villain names - says in the resulting silence. 

‚Äú... fucking awesome!‚Äù Decay - also Tenko Shimura - finishes for her. His hand is already fixed (Overhaul was an infinitely useful quirk, almost as overpowered as One for All in Izuku‚Äôs opinion). 

They all finished changing. They still had a lot of laundry to do, but it could wait. 

‚ÄúOh, please.‚Äù Izuku looks down, not really sure how to react. ‚ÄúThe plan almost failed. I didn‚Äôt expect All Might to show up, and if I didn‚Äôt have Hellhound prepared just in case, we would all end up being captured. Also, Eraserhead was taken down by accident, since K..kacchan‚Ä¶‚Äù He pauses, because Himiko leans towards him and lands a kiss on his cheek. 

He blushes. A lot. Mask and clothes intercepted the majority of the blood, and he washed off whatever made it past them, but Himiko could still smell it on him. And he knows how it makes her act. It is going to be a long day. 

Tenko mumbles something about ‚Äòfucking normies‚Äô and decides to play on his console. Since Izuku fully understands the woes of an introvert within a group of people, he lets him do that. Mustard decides to join Tenko, which is probably better than hearing him rant about ‚Äòthat damn elite school‚Äô not being able to do a thing about him.

Izuku switches on the TV - a necessary part of the living area of the villainous headquarters - and watches the news with Himiko at his side (he doubts that anything safe for All Might level of strength could pry her off him). The attack on UA was already reported (police and paramedics are swarming the complex, hard to hide something like that), but nobody knows what exactly happened. 

Warpgate opens up in the middle of the bar. Kurogiri brings back Gentle, Gremlin and Mindscrew. The rest of his ‚Äòparty‚Äô which he had sent after the students whom he deemed as potential threats. Like Endeavor‚Äôs son. They are good at taking down people without hurting them. 

Izuku refuses to hurt students. Save for Kacchan, but he kinda deserves that. And even in his case, he prefers to do it without lasting bodily damage. Psychological damage stings more. 

Gremlin is, of course, hyperactive. She crosses the distance between them and yanks him from Himiko‚Äôs embrace (resulting in a loud ‚ÄòEh, that‚Äôs not fair!‚Äô coming from behind his back, although somehow the resident vampire manages to retain the hold on his arm) in order to face him. 

Face him from a very close distance. Her concept of personal space was thrown through the window years ago. 

‚ÄúHow did my baby work?‚Äù There is way too much pink hair way too close to his eyes, in Izuku‚Äôs opinion. ‚ÄúDid they hurt it?!‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt worked great.‚Äù Izuku replies in his voice. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not damaged. And neither am I, thank you for asking.‚Äù Himiko giggles behind him. Mustard laughs openly. ‚ÄúNow please, put your taser-sword back in the sheath before approaching people, okay?‚Äù He almost got hit by it, and he knows from experience that it would ruin the day for him. 

‚ÄúOh, okay.‚Äù She backs down. Somewhat. Izuku‚Äôs voice altering mask is Mei Hatsume‚Äôs newest baby and she is an extremely protective mother. ‚ÄúGoing to the workshop now, see you later!‚Äù Then she is gone. 

‚ÄúSo, how did it go?‚Äù Mindscrew decides to ask. He was in charge of the second party, mostly because Gremlin is no commander material and Gentle was‚Ä¶ well, he is Gentle. Izuku kinda expected him to forget about the plan and end up in fierce discussion over tea brands with Yaoyorozu‚Äôs heir if she mentioned her love for it during the battle. 

Besides, he was merely borrowed by the League for the operation. Izuku prefers giving commanding positions to regular members. He needs to learn how to delegate. And they need to learn how to command when he isn‚Äôt around.

He is standing behind Mindscrew, probably giggling internally for all the new content he is going to publish with La Brava once she finishes downloading the camera feed from USJ. But she isn‚Äôt here, so he restrains himself. 

‚ÄúToo well.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúThunderbolt dead. Snipe, Eraserhead and Thirteen badly wounded. But All Might was actually there, so I totally panicked because ohmygod that‚Äôs All Might so I had Kurogiri summon Hellhound and‚Ä¶ ‚Äú His voice suddenly halts as Mindscrew‚Äô quirk takes hold. 

‚ÄúTake three deep, slow breaths.‚Äù Mindscrew - aka Hitoshi Shinsou - says. Izuku follows, before the brainwashing‚Äôs hold on him breaks. 

‚ÄúOkay, sorry for starting to ramble.‚Äù Izuku takes another deep breath. ‚ÄúWe almost killed All Might by accident.‚Äù 

Hitoshi and Gentle stare at him, trying to comprehend what he just said. Izuku isn‚Äôt surprised. He was there but he still can‚Äôt process what happened. 

‚ÄúI thought he would simply not show up, after all the distractions we‚Äôve made. But he ended up forcing through his limit. ‚Äù Izuku continues. ‚ÄúWhich is really cool, and very heroic, and I totally love him for that, but, uhm‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúHe raises his hand, stopping Toshi from what was going to be another brainwashing session. He can calm himself down, if he really wants to! ‚ÄúHe ran out of strength punching out Hellhound, and tried to bluff his way out of it. I went on a villain monologue to buy time until Thunderbolt arrived, but I think that a lot of UA students now know that he has a time limit.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhich isn‚Äôt that much of a problem.‚Äù Gentle announces. ‚ÄúAll Might is a giant, the Symbol of Peace! Naturally, there is nobody out there who would believe in him having ‚Äòlimits‚Äô!‚Äù Fair point. It took Izuku himself a while to believe in it, and he had an extremely trustworthy source of information. ‚ÄúNow excuse me, but I believe that I have tea to drink.‚Äù

And shaking hands to calm down. Gentle is a terrifyingly dangerous combatant, but also a big softie. Before he joined Mr. Compress‚Äô crew, he was busy making a mess in front of cameras in shops that sold subpar merchandise‚Ä¶ and thoroughly (but non-lethally) beating the heroes that tried to stop him. 

Kurogiri warps in again. 

‚ÄúI recovered Hellhound.‚Äù He announces, before heading towards the bar. ‚ÄúLa Brava is back too.‚Äù Gentle Criminal proves that Kurogiri isn‚Äôt the only teleporter around by vanishing instantly. 

Izuku silently congratulates himself for giving Hellhound a GPS collar. 

Those remaining in the bar celebrate with a toast. Kurogiri, the League of Villains unofficial nanny, refuses to hand alcohol to the minors. With Gentle gone, the only other adult is Tenko, who prefered energy drinks to alcohol. 

Celebrating their villain debut with soda is decidedly un-villainous. 

He agrees with Himiko‚Äôs plan to take him (and both Hitoshi and Tenko) for some karaoke in the evening. Her attempts on making the least sociable members of the League have at least some social interactions (planning how to tear down society as they know it apparently isn‚Äôt social enough) continue, despite the grumbling they cause.

After a quick videoconference with the Doctor concerning the Hellhound‚Äôs performance (and repairs), Izuku asks Kurogiri to warp him home. It is time for the family drama to start. 

There is still a chance that he wouldn‚Äôt make it to the karaoke. He just had to not survive the family meeting. 
Notes:

    Thunderbolt is pretty much a throwaway character. I wanted someone important to eliminate who wasn't All Might, and the remaining top hero cast will be left for... other time. He is pretty much Endeavor, except arguably worse of a person.

Chapter Text

Detective Naomasa Tsukauchi really likes his job. Sure, it often exposes him to the nasty handiwork of many villains, but he is mostly working in Musutafu. In the shadow of UA. There are still some local villains, but ever since All for One was punched to death, very few heavy-hitters dared to show up in the city. 

Nedzu made an example out of the few that tried. 

That bear/mouse/rat hero is terrifying when angry. 

Which is why the detective thinks he had heard a very elaborate joke when someone told him that the police (and paramedics) were just called to UA due to someone ATTACKING it directly. 

Soon it turns out that it isn‚Äôt a very elaborate joke. More like someone‚Äôs very elaborate suicide. 

He arrives at UA in a crowd of policemen. He quickly leaves the conventional work to Sansa, as he is ‚Äòcordially invited‚Äô to the Recovery Girl office. Which is bad, since he expected All Might to meet with him first and he can think of a very few reasons for the Symbol of Peace to not rush to greet his old friend. But then he sees Sir Nighteye waiting by the office entrance and his reaction quickly goes from surprised to badly covered panic. 

‚ÄúMirai.‚Äù He nods to the pro hero. They had fought together against the Symbol of Evil, helping dismantle his empire bit by bit. Few years of minimal contact didn‚Äôt change a lot. They respect each other‚Äôs skills and dedication to their jobs.

‚ÄúNaomasa.‚Äù He gets a scarce nod back. Sir Nighteye isn‚Äôt the most expressive of people out there. He knows that much.

The detective tries to evaluate how bad the situation is. From the look on Nighteye‚Äôs face (that he got to see many, many times during their campaign against All for One), it seems to be eleven on the one to ten scale. 

‚ÄúIs he‚Ä¶‚Äù The words fail to come through. But the hero understands. 

‚ÄúHe is alright. But apparently, it was close.‚Äù Nighteye replies. ‚ÄúClose enough for Nedzu to call me, and for All Might to not protest against it.‚Äù Eleven turns to fifteen in the detective's mind. 

The door opens. Recovery Girl peeks out. 

‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù 

All Might, frankly speaking, looks like shit. Which is rather reassuring, as he looked like that ever since his fight against his fated nemesis. There are no new wounds, but he is clearly exhausted and vomiting blood from time to time.  

Nedzu is there too. He is working on a laptop (either checking through the security records or plotting the downfall of Mankind). He is drinking tea, of course. When Naomasa looks at his old friend, All Might shows him four fingers. 

Fourth tea. Fifteen turns to fifty. If he was the object of Nedzu‚Äôs anger (with that intensity), he would spare himself pain and kill himself on the spot. 

‚ÄúSo can someone explain to me what happened?‚Äù Naomasa asks. It sounds like a better option than waiting until All Might and Sir Nighteye acknowledge their presence in the room. Those two are just a pain to watch.

‚ÄúVillain attack.‚Äù Nedzu speaks. It‚Äôs something in the scarce movements of his nose, but Naomasa recognizes fury when he sees it. ‚ÄúOne of them had a warp quirk, and they used it  to teleport into the USJ. They also managed to hack into our network. Enough to make UA as a whole unaware of the attack. Frankly speaking if one of the students didn‚Äôt make it out with a warning, we would have failed to respond.‚Äù 

So an organized group of people with access to very good hackers AND a warpgate quirk. Plus, of course, balls to actually attack Nedzu‚Äôs stronghold. Even All for One generally considered it (together with the National Diet Building and Tartarus Prison) to not be worth the effort. 

Pretty bad. Especially with Japan being the burning mess that it was right now. Horrible timing.

‚ÄúAt least they didn‚Äôt go after the students.‚Äù Recovery Girl adds, her words followed by a loud (and tired) sigh. ‚ÄúA few of them got electrocuted into unconsciousness, but not a single one was wounded. Wish I could say the same about the teachers. Eraserhead, Snipe and Thirteen are all in the hospital. They should make a full recovery, but they took quite the beating.‚Äù  

Nighteye is silently observing them all. Naomasa might have worked with him for years, yes. But he never really figured out what was happening in his mind. Honestly, he never even wanted to. The man was an oddity... and that was the most gentle way of phrasing it, he could think off. 

‚ÄúWhat about Thunderbolt?‚Äù Naomasa asks. ‚ÄúHe is the Hero Commission‚Äôs representative in the school. I‚Äôm not sure if we can have a talk this important without him.‚Äù Personally, Naomasa absolutely hated the man, but he had to ask. 

He didn‚Äôt expect the deathly silence. 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù He asks, hoping that it isn‚Äôt what he thinks it is. 

‚ÄúThe villain leader has‚Ä¶‚Äù All Might says before coughing up some blood. ‚Äú... let‚Äôs just say that they‚Äôll have to bury Thunderbolt in a closed coffin.‚Äù 

Naomasa doesn‚Äôt want to hear that someone murdered the Number Three hero in HIS district. He really, truly doesn‚Äôt want to hear it. He already fought one war and he isn‚Äôt looking forward to another one. 

‚ÄúMore like a bottle.‚Äù Recovery Girl comments. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need to run DNA tests to even confirm his death. The villain practically liquidated him.‚Äù There is something nasty in her face. She is one of the kindest people Naomasa ever knew, but she absolutely hated Thunderbolt. 

She wasn‚Äôt alone in that feeling. Thunderbolt was a gloryhound, who had an entire cemetery in his closet. But he was untouchable, because he was always ready to do whatever the Hero Public Safety Commission told him to. 

‚ÄúWonderful.‚Äù Naomasa replies. ‚ÄúSo I suspect that we‚Äôll get some special governmental representative to pester us and override my every decision in the course of this investigation. I fucking love Mondays.‚Äù He forgot to drink his morning coffee today.  He regrets it immensely. 

‚ÄúProbably.‚Äù Nedzu replies finally. ‚ÄúWhich is why I‚Äôm going to be running my own investigation, preferably with Sir Nighteye, and you‚Äôll be busy telling me what said governmental representative will be doing.‚Äù The principal seems to be on the warpath. Sir Nighteye appears ready to join him. 

Naomasa swears to himself to never again forget about his coffee on Monday. 

‚ÄúHow many attackers?‚Äù Nighteye finally speaks. ‚ÄúAny known faces?‚Äù 

Straight to the business. 

‚ÄúNine.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúCalled themselves the ‚ÄòLeague of Villains‚Äô and announced that they came to kill the Symbol of Peace. Only one of them familiar: Gentle Criminal, occasional co-worker of the Levelers. Unless he had a breakout with Mr. Compress, he was probably either borrowed or hired for the job. I assume it happened due to him having a very competent hacker by his side known as La Brava.‚Äù

Levelers are all Robin Hood-styled thieves that go after the wealthy (especially with connections to the heroes) and give most of their spoils to the poor. Mr. Compress is rather infamous, although low on the list of priority of heroes and police in Japan. Gentle Criminal is much less infamous, but he has an online following if Naomasa remembers it correctly. 

Nobody bothers to acknowledge the flinch on Nighteyes‚Äô face when Nedzu mentions the League of Villains‚Äô mission. The man‚Äôs obsessive worship of All Might is old news. 

‚ÄúSo eight previously unknown but obviously highly dangerous villains.‚Äù Naomasa summarizes. ‚ÄúWhen can I interrogate the captives?‚Äù It will be very useful. And with All Might, Thunderbolt and the faculty, it‚Äôs practically guaranteed that the villain strike force was butchered. 

He curses mentally when he sees Nedzu and All Might make The Face. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúThey escaped.‚Äù All Might finally admits. ‚ÄúTheir leader called for general retreat after Thunderbolt was killed. Everyone was too stunned by his death to pursue them, so they had a few seconds to teleport away. Leaving no one behind.‚Äù

Nedzu finishes his tea. Recovery Girl immediately hands him another one. It is a PR nightmare, a humiliation unheard of in UA history. Nedzu is going to go on one of his legendary crusades of covert destruction over this. No questions asked. He will find everyone involved in the raid and make an example out of them. 

‚ÄúYou let them escape?!‚Äù Nighteye is furious. He was glaring at All Might, probably pissed off by how Yagi managed to leave a stain on the Symbol of Peace‚Äôs good name. On the UA grounds, out of all places. 

‚ÄúI was a bit too busy surviving to pursue them, Mirai!‚Äù All Might retorts with anger. ‚ÄúIf the teachers arrived five seconds later, I‚Äôd be dead. I had no strength left to go after them, and their leader timed the retreat perfectly.‚Äù 

‚ÄúCome again?‚Äù Nighteye is frozen. In a bad way. Recovery Girl somehow manages to conjure a cup of coffee for the detective and he is infinitely thankful to her. It is going to get ugly, especially with All Might apparently ALMOST DYING.  

‚ÄúTheir leader, Legion, managed to figure out that I have a time limit.‚Äù Yagi admits ‚ÄúHe staged several villain attacks and other emergencies around UA today to tire me out. And when I arrived at USJ, he sent some ‚Äòbioengineered superweapon‚Äô with what I believe to be a Shock Absorption quirk. By the time I punched it out of the building, I barely had enough energy left to stand. So I tried to bluff‚Ä¶ and he called it.‚Äù All Might sighs and coughs a bit of blood. ‚ÄúIf he did it a few seconds earlier, or if other teachers arrived a few seconds later, I‚Äôd be dead.‚Äù 

So, a newly emergent supervillain who knew of All Might‚Äôs weakness, and has managed to not only infiltrate the probably most secure place in Japan but also retreat from it without losing a single member. And had the means to defeat the Symbol of Peace while doing so. 

This is no longer just a PR nightmare. It is just a nightmare. And the detective can‚Äôt find a way to wake up from it.

‚ÄúAnd it was also a bunch of kids.‚Äù All Might adds bitterly. ‚ÄúHalf of the villains I saw seemed to be of the same age as the UA students. Including Legion himself, at least judging by his stature.‚Äù 

That probably explains why Nedzu was stuffing himself with a crisis amount of tea. If the tales about Nedzu that he heard from Yagi and Nighteye in the past were any indication, the rat-bear is probably imagining all the wonderful things he could do if those villains decided to be heroes instead and tried to join UA. 

Nobody can question their level of competence. And Nedzu would have loved to have someone like Legion as his personal student. 

Water under the bridge now. 

‚ÄúI have a theory.‚Äù Nedzu announces suddenly. Everyone in the room flinches. When Nedzu has a theory, it is best to hide. Preferably outside the country. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that they planned to kill you, All Might. Rather, they were going after Thunderbolt.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThey what?‚Äù All Might looks like he isn‚Äôt sure what he just heard. Sir Nighteye appears to be simply insulted by the idea of someone ignoring the Symbol of Peace and going after someone else in their presence. 

‚ÄúThey hacked into the security network deep enough to know exactly when the teachers were going to reach the USJ.‚Äù The rat-bear announces. ‚ÄúLegion acted like a man of few words during the whole incident. He made exactly one villain monologue, which mysteriously lasted exactly as long as the time needed for the teachers - and Thunderbolt - to arrive. He seems to be an excellent tactician, so why did he tell Decay and Vampire to attack you five seconds AFTER the window of opportunity to kill you closed in? And why didn‚Äôt they press their attack after Thunderbolt got killed, and instead immediately retreated? If they warped their other party in, they would have had a chance of overwhelming the faculty.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat about all those distractions? And that monster, Hellhound?‚Äù All Might doesn‚Äôt seem persuaded. 

‚ÄúYou responded to all but three hero emergencies in the area, All Might.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúThey were handled by other heroes. But If they didn‚Äôt show up and you responded to even a single one of them, you wouldn‚Äôt make it to the USJ in time. I suspect that they were just as surprised with you being there as we were with their attack. What‚Äôs more, if I hadn‚Äôt demanded that Thunderbolt should go together with the school‚Äôs staff, he would have rushed ahead and gotten killed without the League having to battle the teachers.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds like an excellent plan.‚Äù Nighteye admits with a deep frown. ‚ÄúOne that didn‚Äôt survive the contact with the enemy, but they managed to improvise enough to pull it off.‚Äù Improvising and bluffing in front of the Symbol of Peace was an achievement equaling creation of a plan to invade the UA, in the detective‚Äôs opinion.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm more worried about that ‚ÄòHellhound‚Äô.‚Äù Nedzu admits. ‚ÄúFive meter long beasts resembling wolves capable of going toe to toe with the Symbol of Peace aren‚Äôt something common. It was warped in when All Might arrived, so I believe it was some form of contingency plan in case of All Might making it to the battle. Probably something to delay him while the rest warped away.‚Äù 

The rat-bear doesn‚Äôt have to add that any organization capable of fielding such a beast as a CONTINGENCY PLAN is bad news. Worst of all, it was a previously unknown organization with completely unknown operatives. It was an unprecedented situation, for as far as detective‚Äôs memory goes.  

‚ÄúAny other leads?‚Äù Naomasa asks. 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù The rat-bear replies. Naomasa‚Äôs quirk tells him that it was a lie. 

Probably something Nedzu wants to keep outside of the government‚Äôs attention.

Kurogiri warps Izuku back to his room, which is very, very considerate of him. 

The room hadn‚Äôt changed. His debut as a villain didn‚Äôt make the All Might posters and other merch suddenly go up in flames. 

The All Might clock on his bedside table tells him he arrived twenty minutes ahead of schedule. So he quickly switches his computer on and checks the news. Then he quickly confirms that the present was ready. 

‚ÄúIz‚Ä¶ Izu-nichan?‚Äù He hears right after a very faint knock on his door. 

‚ÄúI AM HERE!‚Äù Izuku replies with vigor and his best All Might impression. His sister immediately storms in, in her favourite All Might onesie, and goes for a hug. 

That he, of course, gives her. While suppressing the slight ‚Äòouch‚Äô when her horn almost stabs him. Midoriya Eri deserves all the hugs in the world, and everyone who claims otherwise should be fed to the Hellhound. 

‚ÄúSo, how was your day?‚Äù Izuku asks, and braces for a tsunami of words. 

 

***

 

Ten minutes of (cute) monologue later, the two of them leave his room and go downstairs. Mom is thoroughly surprised when they show up on the exact same moment when dad emerges from the kitchen with a birthday cake. 

She cries. A lot. Izuku inherited that part of her, although to a much lesser degree. Didn‚Äôt stop Tenko from complaining about Izuku ‚Äòwasting the League‚Äôs budget on tissues‚Äô, although to be honest Tenko complained about everything. 

Mustard told him that if the League wanted to save some money, it could cut down on both the tissues and the computer games. Tenko didn‚Äôt speak to him for weeks. 

They eat the cake together, chatting happily. Then comes the time for the presents. Father‚Äôs present is a really expensive spa and onsen visit. Eri gives her a crown of flowers that she made herself - Hizashi and Inko both agree that it is the ‚Äòbestest‚Äô present ever and Eri positively beams. 

Izuku switches the TV on. Eri remembers their agreement and quickly vanishes from the room - she is a bit too young for what is going to happen.

Hisashi and Inko both stare at him questioningly, so he gestures to them to sit beside him on the couch. 

The news start. 

‚ÄúA previously unknown organization known as the ‚ÄòLeague of Villains‚Äô has launched a daring raid on UA using a warp quirk this morning.‚Äù The news anchor announces. ‚ÄúPro heroes Snipe and Thirteen as well as an undisclosed underground hero were hospitalized after engaging them in battle. Before the villains could get their hands on the hero course students present at the scene, the Number Three Hero, Thunderbolt, arrived. He managed to delay the attackers until All Might arrived, but suffered fatal wounds at the hands of the villain lead...‚Äù 

He hears Inko inhale deeply. He looks at her with his best smile. 

‚ÄúHappy birthday, mom!‚Äù

The hug that he gets after this almost makes him follow Thunderbolt. 

‚ÄúIzukuuuu!!!‚Äù The tears that accompany the wail are the happy ones, he can tell. 

Before Izuku was born, Midoriya Inko was a villain. Quite an infamous one, in fact, but she retired from this life when Izuku was two years old. Less than one year after that an undisclosed hero messed up and started a fire that killed Inko‚Äôs sister and left her paralyzed from the waist down (a state that ended only recently, thanks to Eri).

Even with all his resources, Hisashi didn‚Äôt manage to find out the hero responsible for the disaster until much, much later. The Hero Commission was rather thorough with their cover-up - and the reason for that became obvious when the Midoriyas‚Äô finally discovered that the one responsible for it was Thunderbolt, the Commission's poster boy. 

Midoriya Inko is a slightly clumsy and overweight housewife which also happens to be the kindest and most emotional person that Izuku knows in his life - her villainous past (that was composed entirely of bloodless thievery in which her object attraction quirk was rather useful) had ended a long time ago. But her deep, personal grudge towards Thunderbolt had not. 

Izuku‚Äôs parents knew that he was preparing his villainous debut, and they wholeheartedly supported it (although his mom was constantly and extremely worried about him over it). He kept details under wraps for two reasons - to not worry his mom even more... and to surprise her. 

Thunderbolt visiting the USJ on her birthday was just the cherry on top. 

That man was a monster. Worse than Endeavor, somehow. Izuku hates the idea of taking the lives of others, but there are people that deserve to die. Like Thunderbolt. Or the original user of the quirk that Izuku used to end the Number Three Hero‚Äôs career. 

After his mom manages to stop drowning her only son in her tears, she quickly runs away to record the news. Some new photos to decorate the house with are also probably going to be involved. 

‚ÄúI must admit I am impressed.‚Äù Hisashi Midoriya says when Inko vanishes from their sight. ‚ÄúI expected you to start with some small work. But instead you attacked All Might and Thunderbolt in the middle of that infuriating rat‚Äôs stronghold. I am proud of you, Izuku.‚Äù 

Receiving compliments from his father is something that just‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt get repetitive. It might be something in his presence, some hard to pinpoint quality of character that puts strength and meaning behind his every action and word. That, or some quirk. Izuku never figured it out.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ are you planning to return to the business?‚Äù Izuku decides to not point out how attacking All Might wasn‚Äôt part of the plan and how he actually could have killed the Symbol of Peace but didn‚Äôt do it. 

It was a touchy subject to mention in his company, to say the least. 

‚ÄúOh no, not at all.‚Äù Hisashi Midoriya - known to some as All for One, the worst villain in the history of Japan - replies calmly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve spent six years on life support, with next to no chances of recovery. It‚Äôs something that changes your perspective on life. Two centuries of undisputed lordship over the Japanese underworld is enough. The world of villains needs some new perspective to evolve.‚Äù 

He doesn‚Äôt have to add that his son was (and still is) his preferred successor. There was a reason why Izuku‚Äôs father left him his money, contacts and, although that one was mostly the genetics, quirk. 

Izuku‚Äôs collection of quirks is pathetically small when compared to his father‚Äôs, and he can only keep two active at once. But his father assured him that it would change. When Hizashi was his age, he could only keep a single quirk active. 

They chat for a short while about what to do next. Inko returns, and soon after it, the news anchor announces that the Hero Commission has decided to officially register the members of the League of Villains as villains (which, in other words, meant that there was now an open arrest warrant on them, if not a kill-on-sight order - depends on the person in question).

Izuku had waited for this moment. What rank are they going to receive? It influences a lot of things. It is a bit of a badge of honor among the villains to get a high rank. If he wants to become the best villain, he needs to rise in the rankings. 

Inko and Hisashi waited for this moment to see his son‚Äôs friends and co-workers. The rule about not bringing work home is an ironclad one. Izuku keeps his villain friends away, and Hisashi doesn‚Äôt mention his investment company‚Äôs newest business plans at the dinner table.

Izuku still didn‚Äôt quite get over the fact that his father‚Äôs ‚Äòretirement plan‚Äô consisted of taking over a company that he previously used to launder dirty money‚Ä¶ and make it into a successful company with absolutely no connections with the underworld. Although it is probably the only way to live in pretty much a small mansion WITHOUT someone asking where all the money came from. Heroes and police are nosy people. 

Mindscrew is listed as a C-Rank villain with an ‚Äòunknown mental quirk‚Äô. Hitoshi is probably watching the news in their hideout, hiding the happiness behind his zombie face together with slight disappointment. Inko naturally asks Izuku to remind his friend to go to sleep earlier. 

Gentle and La Brava (police or Nedzu made the connection, they took the Legion‚Äôs bait well) are listed as C-Ranks too. The news anchor mentions them as an independent villain duo with connections to a number of notable villain groups, including the Levelers. Their quirks are listed as unknown. Izuku also has to reassure his mom that La Brava wasn‚Äôt underage and while the age difference is quite serious, they are a completely legal pair. And are happily married. 

Gremlin is listed as B-Rank. Izuku is reassured that she didn‚Äôt forget to put her mask on (they weren‚Äôt quite ready to announce her face to the world). Her higher rank is probably due to someone figuring out that she was the League‚Äôs support engineer. Supports, masterminds, healers, teleporters and so on are almost always higher ranked, simply because they are much less expendable than the combat types. Taking them out makes dismantling the group as a whole much easier. 

Izuku reassures his mom that no, Gremlin isn‚Äôt his girlfriend. Not having to invite Mei over for tea at his home is one of the major benefits of keeping his villain life away from his family. His mom would probably die of a heart attack before Izuku would have time to explain to her what the pink-haired menace meant by having babies with her son. 

Kurogiri is listed as a possessor of a warp quirk and an A-Rank villain. Reasonable enough in Izuku‚Äôs opinion. Warp quirks are rare and extremely useful, and he DID incapacitate both Thirteen and Snipe. This is actually mentioned in the program. Kurogiri is probably secretly smiling behind his bar, while wiping all the glasses for the seven hundredth time this day. His smile has more to do with fatherly pride than with his own achievement. 

Mustard is a C-Rank, with an ‚Äòunknown poison gas quirk‚Äô. He is wearing that weird gas mask slash armour that is supposedly inspired by some old anime. With the ‚Äògasthrower‚Äô that Mei built for him. 

Next is Vampire. B-Rank with unknown quirk, responsible for hospitalization of an underground hero. When his mom teases him with the ‚Äòis she your girlfriend‚Äô bit, he blushes a bit too much. So she immediately demands that he invites her for dinner. Hisashi, the great traitor, gives him the ‚Äòdon‚Äôt fight when you can‚Äôt win‚Äô face when he looks at him for support. 

Decay is declared a B-Rank, with an unknown quirk and specialization in close quarters combat (he is also mentioned as participating in the take down of the underground hero). Izuku remembers describing the five finger point disintegration thing to Eraserhead, so the hero probably doesn‚Äôt regain consciousness yet (or the heroes aren‚Äôt sure if that wasn‚Äôt a bluff). 

Mom is slightly worried by the hands and generally creepy aesthetic. Izuku reassures her that the hands aren‚Äôt actual human hands. Getting Tenko to visit an underground therapist and overcome the trauma caused by what happened to his family was the best idea Izuku ever had. His mom would drop dead if her son‚Äôs best friend was still wearing the severed and preserved hands of his family members (that he accidentally killed as a child) as a part of his villain outfit. 

Hellhound is there too. A-Rank villain, suspected to be either an animal with a quirk or someone using a bestial transformation quirk. Inko off-handedly comments that the beast‚Äôs fur colour resembles the one of their dog. Izuku and Hisashi manage to look surprised by her words. When she turns her face away, Hisashi gives his son a death glare. 

The dog is a second gen Noumu, one of those created after Izuku was introduced to the business (but before his father officially retired). The entire second gen was born when Izuku pointed out that if the Noumu creation process (which he was INCREDIBLY uncomfortable with) damages higher brain function, then perhaps using creatures who generally aren‚Äôt very dependent on said brain functions made more sense.

Doctor facepalmed at the idea. Or at least he tried to. He froze mid-move and made the ‚Äòoh my All for One why I didn‚Äôt think of this earlier‚Äô face. The result was an entire line of noumus built upon animals that developed quirks (and thus could be given more) but not sapience. Buying a dog with some minimal quirk on the internet was also significantly less problematic than kidnapping someone from the street. 

Izuku is still waiting for the right moment to inform the good Doctor that he is only marginally less uncomfortable with the second gen Noumus and that it‚Äôs probably the time to do something less maniacally evil. At least Eri in the meantime was followed by a dog who considered defending her (and other family members) his life‚Äôs duty AND could tank several All Might-level punches after going into combat mode. Which also makes it grow several times bigger. 

Mom doesn‚Äôt know. Izuku and Hisashi decided that it was for the best.

Finally, the climax of the show arrives. The news displays a small figure in an All Might hoodie, with a face covering mask and an utility belt with a combat knife. Name: Legion. Quirk: Unknown, Extremely Dangerous, Touch-Based. There was also a note mentioning Izuku‚Äôs responsibility for Thunderbolt‚Äôs demise. And a rank. 

S-Rank. 

Izuku almost chokes. He isn‚Äôt a villain. He is a state-recognized SUPERVILLAIN. 

‚ÄúYou fought and escaped All Might while wearing an All Might hoodie?!‚Äù Hisashi looks like Christmas came early. 

Mom seems to have broken under the revelation and is mumbling something that sounded like ‚Äòmyboyisans-rankafterhisdebutohmygodiamsoproud‚Äô. While crying. 

He still has an hour until the karaoke and he really, really hopes he will survive until then. 
Notes:

    I slightly rewrote the villain ranking system in this world. G to A-ranks are normal villains, so pretty much from the thugs to people capable of going toe to toe with ranked heroes (ranked as in numbered, not exactly top 10). Then you have supervillains, with a threat level going between S (singular 'thugs' capable of fighting Top Heroes, lesser villain organizations leaders that has managed to become infamous enough, etc.), SS (major threats, think heads of major villain/terrorist groups that can uniformly go against Top Heroes) and SSS (existential threat to the country).

Chapter 3: Developments
Chapter Text

In the end, Izuku survives his mom‚Äôs birthday party. Sure, it is a bit stressful. Mostly because Inko is torn between being terrified that something was going to happen to ‚Äòher baby‚Äô now that he is a supervillain AND being thoroughly happy and proud about him being a supervillain. 

Also he really doesn‚Äôt want Hisashi to start interrogating him about All Might‚Äôs apparent public humiliation. There is no lying to Izuku‚Äôs father. He always finds out. And without lying, Japan‚Äôs newest supervillain would have failed to hide the fact that All Might survived because Izuku wanted him to. 

Which would have led to more troublesome discoveries, such as how Izuku secretly hopes to make All Might hug his sister with her quirk active simply to bring him back to his full strength because that would be SUPER COOL. 

Izuku is a villain, yes. And he is reasonably comfortable with that designation. The word has a lot of meanings these days, either way. But he has a strict code for what he was ok with in this business AND he genuinely thinks that heroes who genuinely do their best to save people (so All Might, Ingenium and pretty much every rescue and underground hero) are just the coolest thing ever. 

It kinda makes it easier to look at his own reflection in the mirror. But he will still fight them if necessary, and hopes that they won‚Äôt corner him enough to force him to resort to lethal means. 

Besides, his dad makes a rather funny face each time he sees Izuku‚Äôs collection of All Might‚Äôs merch. He once walked into the kitchen in the morning to see his two kids wearing matching All Might‚Äôs onesies and his reaction was absolutely hilarious. He was visibly torn between cooing how his little girl looks cute and going out to crucify the family members of whoever designed the onesies. 

Izuku considers this a form of gauging the strength of his father‚Äôs retirement conviction. He doesn‚Äôt want his father to unretire himself. Japan really wouldn‚Äôt survive that, especially with All Might being so weak right now. 

League wants Japan to survive (for now), and then there is also the part where All Might has all the moral qualities that Izuku would like his father to have. To make his son be less confused as to what to feel about him. Izuku is generally confused about a lot of things nowadays.

Karaoke is reasonably interesting. Mustard is there too (they always call him Mustard, since he really dislikes being called with his real name, and besides, said name is a League‚Äôs secret), for some reason. After they briefly celebrate Izuku‚Äôs supervillain status they proceed to thoroughly humiliate him in public by making him sing songs. Although it is mostly him stuttering. 

The only saving grace for the League of Villains members is that they then humiliate themselves. And then Tenko announces that he wants to go to an arcade (to the surprise of absolutely no one), and they follow him. 

They spend a fairly pleasant time there. The highlight of the evening is probably Mustard going on a rant that Thunderbolt that died in the USJ was an impostor, and All Might is actually Endeavour and the real Thunderbolt wearing a costume as they couldn‚Äôt decide which one of them should be a Number One Hero so they decided to become one together.  

At this point, nobody in the League is willing to hazard a guess whether Mustard actually believes in his conspiracy theories. They just like to see him all worked out because of them pointing out the flaws in his logic. 

It all still feels surreal to Izuku. He did it. He is actually a villain, nay, a SUPERvillain. Up until this day he did, technically, violate a handful of laws on a daily basis, but he was still a criminal at best. And the government didn‚Äôt even know about his existence. So it‚Äôs as if he wasn‚Äôt doing anything.

But now, he did it. Sure, there are three different levels of supervillains, and he is on the lowest one, but it is still the S-Rank. Even if he dies tomorrow, he will still be remembered (in whatever will be left from Japan after his father‚Äôs revenge rampage, that is). Hell, someone out there is probably already making HIS very own villain merch. Which is illegal, but honestly, also kinda coo‚Ä¶

‚ÄúIzuuuu‚Ä¶‚Äù He wakes up from his thoughts only to see an unfamiliar girl‚Äôs face very, very close to his. ‚ÄúYou were mumbling again.‚Äù His brain snaps back in place - it is the face Himiko wears for the outing. 

He is thankful for the interruption. Mumbling about his status as a supervillain in public is a serious security risk. Arcade is a loud place, but not THAT loud. 

‚ÄúThank you, Himi.‚Äù She gives him one of her wide and only slightly creepy smiles. It is probably the fangs that added the creepy factor to it. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶ I think we need to have a talk. I need to confirm some things?‚Äù

She looks at him with a mixture of questioning AND encouragement on her face. She is always unfailingly encouraging. That‚Äôs one of her biggest positive sides (and she has a number of those).

‚ÄúSo, you, uhm, like me?‚Äù She nods. ‚ÄúBut do you like me or do you, uhm, like like me?‚Äù He is probably blushing furiously. Why on Earth does he find it harder to talk about stuff like that than to plan an assault on second or third best guarded locations in Japan?

‚ÄúI love you, silly!‚Äù She makes some sort of salute. ‚ÄúYou are the cutest, most adorable thing I have ever seen in my life, and any girl that doesn‚Äôt fall for you obviously has a horrible taste!‚Äù 

Izuku isn‚Äôt sure if being ‚Äòcute‚Äô and ‚Äòadorable‚Äô fits a criminal mastermind. He once asked his father what was the weirdest quirk in his collection and it turned out to be one that made everyone around you perceive you as something ‚Äòcute‚Äô and ‚Äòpetable‚Äô. The results of his father using said quirk were just absolutely unholy and actually gave Izuku nightmares for a while. 

He eventually decides that he could probably work with the ‚Äòcute‚Äô bit. It certainly would make him original among the supervillains. 

‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù He braces himself for the big talk. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶ does that mean that you are my‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶ gggirlfriend?‚Äù 

Their relationship was complicated from the start. Kurogiri introduced her to Izuku when he was ten years old and on the best way to become a completely asocial recluse together with his best friend, Tenko. He was already training under his father to become his successor back then (at least when his father was actually conscious, since it was only a year since his last fight with All Might), and Hisashi apparently decided that having some social skills is a good idea for a villainous mastermind. 

Himiko stood up to the task. Izuku and Tenko were, frankly, pissed off at the obnoxious and loud girl that didn‚Äôt even know how to play the simplest video game. But she didn‚Äôt care about their grumbling and simply installed herself into their lives. Like a giant, mutated tick that refused to die no matter what you did (and that was a quote from one of Tenko‚Äôs rants). 

Then they all got older. And Izuku noticed that the distance between him and Himiko - already abysmally small - started shortening rapidly. Hugs, cuddling, unexpected kisses on the cheek and so on started - and he was the only one recipient of all the additional affection. It was‚Ä¶ confusing. He still doesn‚Äôt know how to react to that. His supervillain education didn‚Äôt cover that.

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù Himiko replies. It isn‚Äôt an answer to his question. More like an announcement. She probably decided that he is now her boyfriend a few months ago and acted on it, completely ignoring the fact that he didn‚Äôt, technically, agree to all of that. 

Sure, he kissed her back once. On an impulse. Tenko came upon the two of them facing the opposite walls of the room, equally red and completely out of it. He later on bought Izuku a romance game and ranted on how three dimensional girls aren‚Äôt worth his Player Two‚Äôs time. 

Tenko is kinda nice. In his own weird ways. 

Himiko is nice too. In her own weird ways. 

‚ÄúOh. That‚Äôs n...nice.‚Äù Izuku is really out of his depth. ‚ÄúAlso my parents want to meet you.‚Äù 

That breaks her. 

Himiko Toga is‚Ä¶ moody. Or, more like, emotionally complicated. She is a solid contender for the position of the world‚Äôs most extrovert person, yes. She has absolutely no problems with suddenly and randomly kissing her crush (which is a nicer way of describing it than ‚Äòboyfriend unaware of that status‚Äô, since it sounds kinda yandere). But she has absolutely no resistance to being on the receiving side of‚Ä¶ well, pretty much everything relationship-related. 

The Kissing Incident is a good example. She was totally alright when she kissed him, but when he did the same thing to her, she reached the same level of shyness as he did. And not only started to stutter but also couldn‚Äôt face him. Not to mention the blushing. There was a lot of blushing, made more visible by her pale skin.

Izuku doesn‚Äôt want to imagine Himiko Toga who didn‚Äôt have relatively sane villain friends during her childhood. She would probably end up being a psychopathic murderer or something. She would make a nice duo with Tenko in such a world. Izuku got his best friend a therapy for only one particular issue. Tenko had a lot of those. 

‚ÄúYour pppparents?!‚Äù She blushes furiously before making a step back and hiding behind her hands. ‚ÄúI, like, uhm‚Ä¶ I mean‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Äù 

Mindscrew is probably busy watching cat videos on the internet. Which is regretful, as Izuku can‚Äôt use his quirk to restart Himiko. Hitoshi joined relatively recently, and the armored train of Himiko Toga‚Äôs extrovertism is yet to overwhelm his resistance to spending time together outside of the base. 

‚ÄúAm‚Ä¶ Am I going to be the first one to meet them?‚Äù She manages to calm herself enough to ask the question. 

He keeps his life separate from his villainous aspirations. The League is kept in the dark when it comes to Legion‚Äôs family. Since most of the members have their own complicated backstories, they decided that he probably has a valid reason for secrecy and let it slide. There was only one exception - Izuku‚Äôs family life is the second most popular field for Mustard‚Äôs conspiracy theories. 

‚ÄúWell, technically speaking Kurogiri babysat my sister once.‚Äù The teleporter looks scary, but is extremely soft on the inside when children are involved. And Eri trusted her brother when he said that Kurogiri is a very nice person. 

Izuku still remembers returning home that day to see Kurogiri sitting on the floor in the dining room, practically covered in hero stickers. The warper seemed content with his life on that day. 

‚ÄúOther than that, no, you are going to be the fir‚Ä¶‚Äù She doesn‚Äôt let him finish. 

‚ÄúYou have a sister?!‚Äù Himiko latches onto the subject with ferocity of‚Ä¶ well, a vampire. A starving one.  

‚ÄúYes, and I‚Äôm very sorry about that, but she is the cutest girl ever and you‚Äôre not changing my mind.‚Äù Izuku replies promptly. ‚ÄúAlso you are going to agree with me once you meet her.‚Äù

Bakugou Katsuki is very easy to anger. 

He is impulsive, he refuses to back down from any sort of challenge, and has a long list of things that push him over the edge. He isn‚Äôt constantly angry (the extras surrounding him know shit about him), but it is rather easy for him to go off. 

He wants to be a true combat-oriented hero. He needs to be strong. Anger brings strength. He isn‚Äôt an idiot, though. Unless something really extreme happens, he can both be angry AND think logically. Even if none of the ‚Äòstudents‚Äô around him seemed to notice it. 

Tactics are useful. Beating villains in terms of strength is one thing, but beating them in the strength and brains department at once is even better.

But that‚Äôs where things stop making sense. He is supposed to be angry right now. Instead he feels‚Ä¶ confused. 

Is anger a circle? Can you get so angry that you get back to the start and no longer feel angry? Or is Bakugou too angry for his heart to keep up, so his brain suppresses the reaction until the anger declines to a manageable level?

Bunch of shitty villains attacking UA wasn‚Äôt a bad thing on its own. He considers villains to be stepping stones for himself. He needs a lot of those to become a Number One Hero, so he can as well start early. 

And then he fucked up. 

Sure he got a good hit on the misty fucker, which was more than could be said about the extras that he was forced to study alongside of. But then he charged at the other villains. 

He has no idea why. Something in their leader just‚Ä¶ made him explode. And not only did he let villains almost kill their hobo-teacher (which happened because he decided to risk his own life to save Bakugou), but he also discovered that DEKU was alive. 

And a villain. Apparently a supervillain now.

And then he didn‚Äôt even bother fighting him for real. He had one of his own extras take him down, and then promptly ignored him. Before using what was obviously a FUCKING QUIRK to kill the FUCKING NUMBER THREE HERO. 

Bakugou Katsuki decides that he isn‚Äôt raging around yet simply because his mind fails to process what happened. Deku exploding Thunderbolt in front of him just‚Ä¶ broke him. His mind fails to compute the image.

‚ÄúI see that you are awake.‚Äù Bakugou flinches and looks around his hospital room. Someone‚Ä¶ Something furry is sitting on the chair near his bed, with a small laptop in its hands. Paws. Yeah, those are paws. 

‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you?‚Äù He has a bad day, and he really doesn‚Äôt want to make it worse. Whoever that furry fuck is, it should just fuck off and let him figure things in peace. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Nedzu. The UA‚Äôs principal.‚Äù The rat/bear replies calmly. Something in its voice is pissing Bakugou off. 

Then he understands what he just heard. And that he just made his day way, way worse. 

He just referred to his school‚Äôs principal as ‚Äòwhat‚Äô rather than ‚Äòwho‚Äô. And it is Nedzu. Bakugou‚Äôs idol is All Might, but he lives close enough to UA to hear the legends of Nedzu‚Äôs viciousness and his absolute lack of tolerance towards certain things. 

Such as people treating him as not a person. 

‚ÄúI suspect that I know what you are thinking about it, Bakugou Katsuki.‚Äù Nedzu‚Äôs voice is calm, but something in it makes the student tremble internally. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to let it slip. You are young, after all. And I know full well that you have a tendency to speak before thinking.‚Äù If anyone else has told him that, he would explode. But this time, it isn‚Äôt even on the table. 

‚ÄúYou know who Legion is.‚Äù Nedzu announces. ‚ÄúHe called you ‚ÄòKacchan‚Äô and you raged, and called him a ‚Äòquirkless Deku‚Äô. You will describe your relationship with this villain immediately. If I catch you lying or omitting the truth, you‚Äôll be expelled. And I will personally make sure that you will never be enrolled in any hero school in this country.‚Äù 

Bakugou Katsuki heard that Nedzu is normally a perfectly sane and decent individual. Unless he switched into his little genocide mode. Unless Deku greatly overestimated the ‚Äòsanity and decency‚Äô part in one of his hero rants that somehow stuck to Bakugou‚Äôs memory, the student is just witnessing said mode. 

Bakugou confesses. 

It‚Äôs as if a dam breaks, letting words flow through. Crushing the lives of hundreds. 

 

***

 

The day of the attack on the USJ was one of the worst in Nedzu‚Äôs life. He was caught completely off-guard, by a group composed mostly of children. It was a humiliation, yes. But he could live through that - he likes challenges, and cracking down the ‚ÄòLeague of Villains‚Äô appeared to be one. 

The real problem is that it is a distraction. And he doesn‚Äôt need those. 

The situation in Japan is‚Ä¶ precarious. Way too many powerful groups. Increasingly autocratic (and inept, it always goes together) government. Hero Public Safety Commission installing itself as a shadowy power behind the ailing democracy. Hokkaido practically seceding after a narrowly thwarted coup by the Meta Liberation Army (and it‚Äôs not like they managed to get the true supporters of the coup, only the mob and some turncoat heroes that almost overthrew the government with their numbers). Quirkless Liberation Front, Creature Rejection Clan, Inhuman Supremacy Party, Levelers and a dozen more villain groups rampaging around. 

The Symbol of Peace was never more important. He is a giant casting its shadow over Japan. Re-Destro would have long ago started an open war if he wasn‚Äôt afraid of All Might sending him flying from Hokkaido to Russia with a punch. 

All Might was the symbol of what heroism should be about, someone to look up to. To remind other heroes what they are supposed to be. And now, a group of brilliant young people almost overwhelmed him. If he died, no, if he was even wounded‚Ä¶ Nedzu doesn‚Äôt even want to imagine the chaos that would ensue. The country would collapse overnight. 

In a better world, most if not all of the League members would have made for fantastic heroes. Most of them didn‚Äôt even display their quirks, yet they managed to take down several pro-heroes, kill Thunderbolt and corner All Might! Nedzu has to admit that it is simply breathtaking. 

But now, they are a wildcard. Nedzu isn‚Äôt even sure if they are UA‚Äôs enemies, if he is to be honest. He considered eliminating Thunderbolt himself - UA is his fortress, and he dislikes nosy people. Instead a completely unknown group did that for him, while making the world think that they came to kill All Might, the most powerful of Nedzu‚Äôs chess pieces. 

All that the rat-bear has to do now was to pretend to be saddened by Thunderbolt‚Äôs demise. 

But the League‚Äôs astounding debut is going to complicate the chessboard even further. 

All of that because a completely unrelated school messed up. Nedzu is going to completely annihilate it, simply out of spite. And to improve his mood a bit. He does things for such reasons from time to time. 

If said school was slightly less quirkist, perhaps Nedzu would be spending this day with Midoriya Izuku, preparing him to be his successor. He certainly has the brains for that. The tactical acumen and quirk analysis skills displayed by him during the attack make the rat-bear salivate. 

Using Kurogiri to take down both Thirteen and Snipe by turning their quirks against them. Forcing Eraserhead to deal with two talented melee experts, with one constantly trying to blindside him - taking full advantage of the weaknesses of the Erasure quirk. Mustard on standby to gas Eraserhead if Decay and Vampire failed to take him down, while simultaneously suppressing his quirk by limiting visibility. Preparing the distractions to keep All Might away. Actually figuring out All Might‚Äôs weakness. 

According to Bakugou, Midoriya started to analyse quirks right after learning how to write. How good does he have to be today? 

He would gladly exchange Bakugou for Midoriya. Alas, water under the bridge. Now he has to eliminate Legion and his League before they will grow even more dangerous. And Bakugou Katsuki might be a useful pawn in this endeavor. 

‚ÄúTwo months of detention.‚Äù Nedzu announces when Bakugou finishes his hurried confession. ‚ÄúMandatory anger management classes and psychological consultations. Consider yourself on probation - if I hear anything even remotely discriminatory from you before you graduate, you‚Äôll be expelled. The same will happen if your temper issues endanger another student or a member of the faculty.‚Äù 

If Nedzu is to be honest, Bakugou is as much of a victim as Midoriya. Sure, he was the bully. That much couldn‚Äôt be denied. But nobody has ever told him that what he was doing was wrong. There is no genuine malice in this child, only acute insecurities and wrongly understood kindness - if Nedzu read him well, he started attacking Midoriya as a form of discouraging his friend from going after heroics, which he perceived as too dangerous for a quirkless boy. 

Add peer pressure and irresponsible adults to the mix‚Ä¶ and you get Japan's youngest supervillain. And an aspiring hero that was yet to understand that his dream of becoming a Number One Hero is dead and buried.

Legion is going to be eventually unmasked. Someone will make a connection. Driving a child into becoming a menace to society through bullying is enough to stain his image forever. The best that Bakugou can hope for was becoming another Endeavor - so close yet so far from the top. 

He leaves the hospital room, leaving the shattered remnants of the student behind. 

Nedzu hopes that Izuku is a late bloomer. There are cases of supposedly quirkless people developing powerful quirks much later than normal. Eclipse of the Quirkless Liberation Front is a good example - she was seventeen years old when her quirk kicked in. 

The alternative to that is too horrible to comprehend. 

 

***

 

Three days after the USJ raid, the Villain Network finally catches up with the events. Legion‚Äôs account is promoted from an unranked passerby to an S-Rank villain. The same thing happens to other members of the League. 

Villain Network is pretty much something between a Discord and Facebook but for villains - on the international scale. Izuku‚Äôs father didn‚Äôt elaborate on how it works and how it avoided international scrutiny. But he did claim it was reasonably secure. On the other hand, you never know if the villain you are talking with isn't an undercover hero with an expertly falsified criminal record. Caution was advised. 

Theoretically anyone can join it. But you don‚Äôt get access to anything interesting unless your country declares you a villain and mysterious administrators of the Network confirm your credentials. 

It is‚Ä¶ underwhelming, at least a bit. Izuku expected something more. On the other hand, most of the villains aren‚Äôt exactly the friendliest sort. If anything, League of Villains was probably an exception to the rule, since its members got along quite nicely. 

He will probably end up using it to chat with other League members. Some of them didn‚Äôt live in the Legion‚Äôs secret lair, oddly enough. And even those that did seem to be very into the internet, especially in the evening.  Plus probably he would ask some villains for an autograph through it. 

Delivering it will be a pain, though. 

He creates a private chat and invites League members to it. Tenko joins in immediately, unsurprisingly. Hitoshi is right after him. 

His friends would benefit from having life aside from the internet. 

He hears a faint knock on the door of his study. 

‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù Tenko is playing downstairs, so the chances of it being a hero are rather abysmal. He would have heard screams, curses and general combat noise. And probably had the entire building collapse due to Tenko decaying walls.

It is Himiko. In her shy and super awkward mode. 

‚ÄúUhm, Zuku?‚Äù In a very shy mode and super awkward mode, he corrects himself. ‚ÄúSo, uhm, I‚Äôve been wondering‚Ä¶ what should I wear to the meeting?‚Äù 

Seeing Himiko actually conscious about what she is wearing is a new experience. She attacked UA while wearing a villain outfit mostly composed of what is pretty much a SCHOOL UNIFORM. Just with some added knives. He isn‚Äôt even sure where she took that school uniform from, if he is to be honest. And he isn‚Äôt sure if he wants to know. 

‚ÄúIt really doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúWear whatever you are comfortable with. Your standard clothes are totally alright.‚Äù He kinda likes them. Especially the short skirt. But he would rather go to the Tartarus than admit it publicly. 

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù She isn‚Äôt sure what to answer, most likely. ‚ÄúAnd, uhm, the face?‚Äù She adds while covering hers with her hands. 

There has been a serious misunderstanding between them, Izuku understands. 

He stands up from the chair and approaches her, leaving the computer behind. He gently pulls her hands off her face (she responds with some stammering while doing her best to not look at him). 

‚ÄúHimiko Toga.‚Äù The official tone makes her finally look at him, but it is clear that she was struggling. ‚ÄúMy parents are VILLAINS. They are absolutely proud of me for staging the raid on the USJ. The reason why they want to meet you is because they figured everything out from my reaction to mom‚Äôs teasing me about you being my girlfriend when the news announced your new status as a villain. They know who you are, they know what you are doing for a living, and they have absolutely no problem with that.‚Äù 

She is just staring at him, so he decides to add something more.

‚ÄúJust be yourself, alright?‚Äù 

The resulting hug almost finishes Legion‚Äôs career as a villain. It also makes him forget to explain just what sort of villains his parents are. 

It can wait, right?

    Izuku introduces his girlfriend to his family. Shenigans ensue.

Chapter Text

Kurogiri opens a warpgate in front of Izuku‚Äôs home soon after the sunset. 

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù Himiko looks around with a surprise written on her face. Izuku can understand that. His home is a small residence, surrounded by a well-trimmed garden‚Ä¶ in the middle of the forest. Sure, there is a road (someone might have asked awkward questions if they weren‚Äôt any, warp quirks are rare after all), but other than that, it is just the forest. 

Izuku prefers to not mention just how rich his family is in front of the League members. Most of them were either impoverished before turning to villainy‚Ä¶ or worse than that. Himiko‚Äôs parents were relatively well off, but since her quirk was ‚Äòvillainous‚Äô, her childhood was tough. 

‚ÄúFather has an investment company.‚Äù Izuku says in an almost apologetic tone. He doesn‚Äôt mention that he also invests a lot of money in the League. It‚Äôs from his personal retirement funds, though. Company itself is clean.

‚ÄúOh yeah, you said he was a villain.‚Äù Himiko is back to her normal self. 

Izuku chuckles. 

‚ÄúRetired villain.‚Äù He replies. ‚ÄúHe uses the company as an explanation for the money. Err‚Ä¶ actually, I forgot to mention something.‚Äù He admonishes himself for that fiercely. 

‚ÄúWhat is it, Zuku?‚Äù 

‚ÄúMy parents are retired SUPERvillains.‚Äù She stares at him in surprise. ‚ÄúI forgot the ‚Äòsuper‚Äô bit when I told you about them. My bad.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDo I know them?‚Äù She is visibly excited. Sure, she didn‚Äôt reach the level of fanboyism present in Izuku, but unless you are Tenko Shimura you simply can‚Äôt spend childhood with Midoriya Izuku without catching some of it. 

‚ÄúMom used to be known as Mischief.‚Äù Himiko‚Äôs eyes widen in shock. 

‚ÄúThat famous thief?!‚Äù Izuku nods. He remembers Mom crying when Mr. Compress got interviewed by someone and mentioned her as an inspiration alongside the Peerless Thief, Oji Harima.

Then again, he remembers Mom crying about a lot of things. 

‚ÄúAnd an S-Rank in her prime.‚Äù Izuku replies with pride. At least one supervillain on his family tree that he can be genuinely and unquestionably proud of. ‚ÄúNow she‚Äôs‚Ä¶ very dedicated to being a housewife and a mother. Very emotional, don‚Äôt get startled when she starts crying, she does that a lot.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶‚Äù She makes a thoughtful expression for a moment. Quite unlike her, if Izuku is to be honest. Not that she is stupid, quite the opposite in fact. But she tended to be way too expressive to make such reserved faces. ‚ÄúAnd your dad?‚Äù 

Now things are going to get tricky. 

‚ÄúDo you remember All Might‚Äôs time limit thing?‚Äù She nods. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because the last time they met, my dad tore All Might‚Äôs stomach and lung out.‚Äù 

Himiko.exe stops working. 

‚ÄúBut father ended up spending six years on life support after it, and while he made a full recovery, he decided that it‚Äôs time to retire and focus on his family.‚Äù Izuku continues. ‚ÄúAll Might thinks that his nemesis is dead, and the government never admitted that he exists as they prefer the public to think that the Symbol of Peace is untouchable. So he is something like an‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶ SSSS-class villain?‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo reality is crazier than the Mustard‚Äôs conspiracy theories.‚Äù Himiko finally manages to respond. ‚ÄúWow. Like‚Ä¶ wow.‚Äù 

He looks at her with an apologetic smile. 

‚ÄúYeah, it kinda is.‚Äù He adds. ‚ÄúAlso before we enter, I need to quickly run you through a list of several crucial rules.‚Äù 

‚ÄúRules?‚Äù 

‚ÄúRule number one - my sister is the cutest being under the sun, and is too pure to be exposed to something as unsightly as villainy. When she is with us, we do not talk about villainous things.‚Äù Izuku announces with a serious expression. 

‚ÄúOkay!‚Äù Himiko is back to her cheerful self. ‚ÄúWhat next?‚Äù 

‚ÄúRule number two - if you notice something wrong with our dog, do not speak of it aloud. Mom and my sister do not know, and it should stay like that.‚Äù This time Himiko stares at him strangely. 

‚ÄúSomething wrong? Like what?‚Äù She appears to be a bit‚Ä¶ distraught by that rule. 

He shrugs. She‚Äôll know when she‚Äôll know. Otherwise, there is no point in mentioning it. Izuku isn‚Äôt sure if he wants her to know. 

‚ÄúNot important. Rule number three is that we do not talk about All Might when dad is around. He got United States of Smashed at least twice, and considers All Might to be his archnemesis. He is kind enough to ignore his merch, as he knows that I‚Äôd set fire to his suit collection if he destroyed it, but that‚Äôs as far as he goes.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNoted. What else, Zuku?‚Äù She adds. She seems entertained by all of it and he has no idea why.  

‚ÄúWhat happens in this residence stays in this residence.‚Äù He knows that she can hold a secret well when she wants to, but he still decided to mention it.

‚ÄúSomething less obvious?‚Äù She replies with a chuckle. 

 

***

 

The entrance door is slightly open. Izuku pushes it open a bit more. No light. Now that is‚Ä¶ suspicious. 

He can‚Äôt imagine someone crazy enough to attack All for One in his home. Only All Might has a chance of winning that fight singlehandedly (but if it was him, there would be no home left). Several Top Ten Heroes with a plan or several supervillains would have a chance too, but‚Ä¶ 

Re-Destro, Eclipse and Mr. Compress cooperating to take down All for One is about as likely as All Might and All for One working together for world peace. And without those three, all you have left were some minor supervillains. Maybe save for Purity and Beast but those are assholes that nobody liked.

Then again, he can also scarcely imagine Top Ten Heroes mobilizing without infighting. Nedzu and the Hero Public Safety Commission are at each other‚Äôs throats for years. Nedzu didn‚Äôt start a civil war yet because he didn‚Äôt want Re-Destro to jump at the victor‚Äôs throat. The same goes for the HPSC.

Night Vision. Reflex Boost.

He can see clearly now, without switching on the lights. Himiko is following him soundlessly‚Ä¶ and with a knife. 

He did tell her to ‚Äòbe herself‚Äô during the meeting, but he still didn‚Äôt expect her to take her knives. Midoriya Izuku is sometimes a bit of a dummy. 

They search the house until finally Izuku notices something odd. Swivel chair in the middle of the room. Massive swivel chair in the middle of the room. 

Light is suddenly switched on, and Izuku is blinded for a second before he deactivates Night Vision. As a result he misses most of the grand reveal. When his eyesight comes back, All for One is already facing them, sitting on the chair in one of his best suits with a white cat on his lap. 

‚ÄúWelcome to my evil lair, young villains.‚Äù Hizashi Midoriya announces in his best villain voice. It‚Äôs absolutely terrifying, even to Izuku who has known him for years. 

Himiko jumps back on instinct. Izuku isn‚Äôt surprised. His father is‚Ä¶ intimidating, even when he isn‚Äôt doing anything actively malicious. Himiko‚Äôs instincts are well-honed - he is sure that she would immediately recognize Hizashi as a mortal danger even without Izuku‚Äôs warnings about who the man is.  

‚ÄúSwivel chair reveal, really?‚Äù Izuku curses himself for having the idea to bond with his slightly estranged father over old movies. Why exactly did All for One liked Bond films so much is anyone‚Äôs guess, really. Did he relate to the villains in it?

‚ÄúI always wanted to try it.‚Äù His dad shrugs while letting the cat jump off him. ‚ÄúI even borrowed a cat from Kurogiri.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the worst.‚Äù Izuku replies.

‚ÄúStop complimenting me, Izuku.‚Äù It is a bit of an inside joke to them. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs time for some introductions. Also you can put down your knife, Vampire. Izuku‚Äôs friends are safe in this house. Unless...‚Äù He is probably trying to make an SSSS-Rank villain equivalent of ‚Äòdon‚Äôt you dare make a mess in my home‚Äô, but accidentally ends up ramping up the intimidation factor. 

Himiko freezes. 

Midoriya Inko might have gotten a bit‚Ä¶ chubby after she retired, but she can still move quietly. Quietly enough to sneak upon All for One himself and suddenly slap his head with a rolled newspaper. 

‚ÄúWhat the‚Ä¶'' He tries to ask but is interrupted.

‚ÄúMidoriya Hisashi.‚Äù All for One freezes. He recognizes the tone. Jokes are over. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you see how terrified she is of you? Your son finally brought home a friend, and you are about to give them a heart attack with your antics. Have you no shame?‚Äù 

In Izuku‚Äôs opinion, All for One got interested in his mom simply because she was probably the only person out there that didn‚Äôt cower in terror in front of him. That or her cooking. Either one works. 

Unlike him she actually has an idea how normal people work on a day-to-day basis, too. He was learning things from her, but he was still a bit off. There is a reason why he governed his company through videoconferences from home. He isn‚Äôt ready to be unleashed upon the non-villainous world. 

‚ÄúAlright, I apologize.‚Äù Izuku‚Äôs father announces. ‚ÄúThat was uncalled for. I‚Äôm sorry for scaring you.‚Äù His intimidating aura lessens significantly. 

Inko gets to Himiko, takes the knife out of her hand and then gently hugs her and pats her back. Izuku joines her from the other side.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, sweetie.‚Äù Inko says in her most reassuring tone. 

Himiko Toga suddenly remembers that breathing is a thing. 

 

***

 

Izuku has to admit that Himiko‚Äôs visit COULD start in a better way. Even after Inko consoles her a bit, she is still rather shaken. He isn‚Äôt surprised. It worries him a lot - he actually likes her (in the ‚Äòlike like‚Äô way, or at least he thinks so), and he doesn‚Äôt want his father to‚Ä¶ influence their relationship in any way.

For example by scaring Himiko mentally for life. 

Eri shows up a few minutes later. In her All Might onesie (she is probably planning to go to sleep soon, so it was a given). All for One smiles widely but Izuku can see the existential pain in his eyes. 

Judging from the expression on Himiko‚Äôs face, she just decided that Izuku was correct when he said that his sister is the cutest thing ever. 

Himiko likes cute things. And people. 

‚ÄúHe...hello.‚Äù Eri says, her big eyes set on Himiko. 

‚ÄúOh hi!‚Äù Himiko‚Äôs smile is genuine, although slightly‚Ä¶ exhausted. ‚ÄúYou must be Izuku‚Äôs sister.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd you‚Ä¶ you are Izu-nichan‚Äôs wife!‚Äù Eri announces with a straight face slightly tinted with a ‚ÄòI‚Äôm so smart!‚Äô expression. 

Himiko breaks again. This time together with Izuku. Inko makes a sound like she just choked on something. Hisashi is the only person to remain sane, and is probably having a blast while doing so. It‚Äôs just that he doesn‚Äôt show it.  

‚ÄúEri.‚Äù The girl looks up at her adopted father. ‚ÄúThey are friends. While I admit there is a possibility of marriage further down the line, they are way too young for that.‚Äù 

The mention of the ‚Äòpossibility of marriage‚Äô only messes everyone up more. It was intentional. Truly, All for One‚Äôs evil is limitless. 

 

***

 

They are eating a late dinner together, talking about some random things. Eri is around, so they couldn‚Äôt have the ‚Äòproper‚Äô talk. The food is, of course, delicious. 

At some point of the meal, All for One‚Äôs restraint reaches its limit. 

‚ÄúI have a question for you.‚Äù He says towards Himiko. ‚ÄúYou know that Izuku likes analyzing quirks. I happen to be a bit of a quirk analyst myself.‚Äù An understatement of a century in Izuku‚Äôs opinion. Both sentences, in fact. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm extremely curious about your quirk. If it isn‚Äôt a problem, could you tell me what it is?‚Äù 

He is probably curious about quirks of the entire League of Villains. So many new yet powerful villains with unknown quirks. He spent two centuries gathering hundreds of ‚Äòinteresting‚Äô quirks inside his own body, and certain things stuck (even if he promised Izuku to not steal more of them after retiring).

Himiko responds by transforming into Izuku. Her clothes stay the same. Seeing himself wearing girl‚Äôs clothes (in front of his parents, no less) is a bit‚Ä¶ weird. 

‚ÄúFull physical transformation.‚Äù All for One is suitably impressed. ‚ÄúAnd an almost instant one. A wonderful quirk. I assume there are some requirements for the transformation, yes?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Himiko replies while changing back to her natural self. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not sure if I can speak about it here.‚Äù She is considerate enough to not mention the blood drinking part in front of Eri. Or Izuku‚Äôs parents. 

Eri suddenly raises her hand. 

‚ÄúIs it about sex?‚Äù She asks with an absolutely innocent face. 

Izuku chokes on his katsudon. Himiko freezes. Inko looks at her adopted daughter with terror on her face. Hisashi‚Äôs face is one of a traumatized soldier after years of trench warfare who was just told that the war started again and it‚Äôs time for the trenches again. 

‚ÄúWhere‚Ä¶ where did you hear that word?‚Äù Inko manages to utter. Izuku can see the dam is ready to burst. 

‚ÄúYou and daddy were talking about Izu-nichan yesterday.‚Äù Eri announces, completely unaware of what is happening. ‚ÄúDad asked you if it was the time to have a talk about sex with Izu-nichan, and if it wasn‚Äôt already too late for that.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcuse me for a moment.‚Äù Hisashi stands from the table and disappears into another room. They can all hear a muffled scream coming from it a few seconds later. 

Mom starts crying while trying to explain to Eri that this is something that she was too young to know details about. 

 

***

 

Eri finally decides to go to sleep. It happens right after a large dog of undetermined breed walks into the room as if it owned it.

The dog is limping a bit. 

‚ÄúWhat happened to it?‚Äù Himiko asks. She does like animals, although only some of them. Either the cute (so most cats) or the fluffy (so large dogs). This one is hard to classify concerning its breed, but there is certainly a lot of fluff. 

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know, actually.‚Äù Inko replies with a worried look on her face. ‚ÄúHisashi took him to a vet, and there are no actual wounds, but he still walks like this. It‚Äôs the second day of it, but I think it‚Äôs getting better.‚Äù

She and her husband vanish from the room, probably to help Eri settle down (and probably for some bedtime story). It is at this point that Himiko connects the dots and turns her face towards Izuku. 

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt.‚Äù She looks shocked. 

‚ÄúI did.‚Äù Izuku replies sheepishly. ‚ÄúI panicked. So I told Kurogiri to warp in my dog. It has‚Ä¶ a really nasty quirk.‚Äù A few, in fact. But he is yet to explain the whole noumu business to the League. 

They knew he had something prepared (together with the mysterious ‚ÄòDoctor‚Äô) in case things went wrong, and he did get a few questions about the whole ‚Äòbioengineered superweapon‚Äô thing after the attack. That talk had to happen sooner or later. Preferably later. 

‚ÄúYou had your dog fight All Might, THE Number One Hero.‚Äù She says, still obviously in shock. ‚ÄúAnd your dog almost won.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt rub salt into my wounds, please.‚Äù And she is yet to see his room. That‚Äôs when things are going to get awkward. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a lot of All Might.‚Äù Himiko says after entering his room and taking a look at all the merchandise scattered throughout it. 

‚ÄúWell, he is my idol. Kind of.‚Äù Izuku replies. He does his best to not think about the fact that there was now a GIRL IN HIS ROOM. Talking about All Might feels significantly less awkward. He is reasonably confident on that subject. Unlike the other one.

It isn‚Äôt just All Might, though. He has some Edgeshot, Miruko, Gang Orca and Best Jeanist stuff too. And a handful of smaller things themed after underground heroes that are mostly handmade (including a large Eraserhead figurine). Plus some rescue hero things. 

At least seventy percent of things in his bedroom are All Might themed, though. 

He is a villain‚Ä¶ and another villain just saw his room, full of hero merch. It is the right time to explain some things. The last thing he wants is Himiko misunderstanding what she just saw. Then again, can it really be misunderstood?

‚ÄúI am a villain, and I know it.‚Äù Izuku says in a serious tone. Himiko manages to pry her eyes off the merch scattered throughout the room and looks at him. ‚ÄúBut I simply cannot find it in myself to hate people who are actually willing to risk their lives for others. It‚Äôs one thing that I really disagree on with my father.‚Äù

They talked about it a lot. Eventually Hisashi gave up on trying to persuade Izuku. He accepted that his son had a different definition of villainy and they both agreed to disagree on it. For as long as Izuku didn‚Äôt apply to a hero school or didn‚Äôt go vigilante, that is. 

‚ÄúSo while they are horrible people among the heroes, like Thunderbolt, people that I‚Äôm willing to end‚Ä¶ I just can‚Äôt hate the idea behind it all. I guess that it does make me a bad villain, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

She grabs his hands and moves closer to him. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what makes you an awesome villain, Zuku.‚Äù Himiko says quietly. ‚ÄúYou know what my past was like. I had a ‚Äòvillainous quirk‚Äô so I was told to keep it hidden from the world, even despite it hurting me. Everyone kept telling me that I was a villain in the making, despite the fact that I didn‚Äôt want to be one.‚Äù She pauses for a second, as if gathering courage. ‚ÄúVillains were scary. Then I met you. The kindest person I ever knew and an aspiring villain. Person who showed me how to be myself without growing to hate what I was.‚Äù

Izuku is on the verge of crying. Strangely enough, he isn‚Äôt the only one. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what brought the League together.‚Äù Himiko continues. ‚ÄúWe all didn‚Äôt fit. We all wanted to change something. To do something. But we had no idea what or how. And then, instead of going insane or on a random murder spree, we met you. Person who didn‚Äôt judge us by our past, or by our quirks. Person with ideals that we could follow. A leader. So don‚Äôt feel bad for having said ideals. Besides‚Ä¶‚Äù She chuckles slightly. ‚ÄúAfter seeing All Might in person I must admit he is awesome. Your dog‚Äôs more awesome, though.‚Äù

What follows is a session of laughter interspersed with crying. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs where I work on my secret evil plans.‚Äù Izuku announces, while Himiko eyes the room curiously. 

It is quite spacious. There is a desk with a computer and a large book stand filled with his hero and villain analysis notes on one end. On the other end are two bookshelves with a rather diverse content. 

‚ÄúOh wow.‚Äù Himiko is shocked. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ the biggest collection of villain merch I ever saw.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHaving it in the room next to my own is kinda ironic.‚Äù Izuku sighs. ‚ÄúAnd most of the stuff are figurines I made myself, actual villain merch is illegal and thus tends to be of inferior quality. I refuse to settle on inferior quality.‚Äù He has standards, after all. 

‚ÄúThere are like‚Ä¶ two hundred figurines there.‚Äù Himiko looks at him with a combination of terror and surprise. She is almost correct, there are only one hundred ninety one figurines in the room. ‚ÄúYou made them all yourself?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bit of a fanboy, not sure if you noticed.‚Äù He replies and she laughs. 

‚ÄúThe left bookshelf is the villains I personally disagree and dislike.‚Äù Izuku decides to explain. ‚ÄúPlus heroes I believe are pretty much villains in disguise.‚Äù They can both see a Thunderbolt figurine on that bookshelf. ‚ÄúOn the right are the ones that I personally look up to or at least think that they had a point.‚Äù

No All for One‚Äôs figurines. Izuku respects him as a father figure (he is genuinely doing his best, even if a lot of law-abiding citizens would disagree), but his villain history is‚Ä¶ questionable. Extremely. You don‚Äôt get called ‚ÄòSymbol of Evil‚Äô without being a monster.

Lack of his figurine means that Izuku doesn‚Äôt have to ask himself which bookshelf it belongs to. He himself isn‚Äôt sure why - he knows he should hate his father‚Äôs handiwork, but somehow he just can‚Äôt, and at least not when he regularly sees the man in question go mellow when Eri pops up in the room. This bothers him at night sometimes. 

‚ÄúWait, is that‚Ä¶‚Äù Himiko notices it of course. ‚ÄúMeta Liberation War? On the right bookshelf?.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt expect a rather quirkist book in the house of a person who used to be bullied for quirklessness. There is also the part with the Gremlin‚Äôs past that they both prefer to not touch.

‚ÄúIt is.‚Äù Izuku replies with pride. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at me like that, Himi! I dislike the ideology, and I AM going to fight Re-Destro eventually. And you know why. Destro was much better, though. He fought for free quirk usage in the times when quirked people were discriminated against. If someone made him time-travel to the modern day and showed him his descendant openly discriminating against the quirkless and those with weak quirks‚Ä¶‚Äù Izuku shrugs. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he would be very happy about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI should probably stop asking you questions.‚Äù Himiko sighs. ‚ÄúIf I keep doing that, you‚Äôll give me a ten hour long lecture and it‚Äôs a bit too late for that.‚Äù He blushes a bit. Sure, it is his favourite subject, but he wouldn‚Äôt make it a lecture! Okay, maybe a short one. ‚ÄúNow show me your browsing history!‚Äù She leaps towards his computer.

‚ÄúNoooo!!!‚Äù Izuku panics. Thankfully it is a joke. Unfortunately, he fell for it and when he catches up to her, he sees that she is laughing. 

‚ÄúSo you DO have some shameful bits in it!‚Äù She laughs. ‚ÄúI thought you were an innocent cookie, but now I can see there is some spice in it.‚Äù He does his best to appear innocent. ‚ÄúWho is that, though?‚Äù 

She decides to not mention the part of his desk occupied by figurines of the League of Villains members‚Ä¶ but she does get curious over the one figurine on the desk that she doesn‚Äôt recognize. Which is probably suspicious, as it is right next to the monitor. In a rather exposed location. 

‚ÄúThunderbolt was the second person that I killed.‚Äù Certainly not something that a sixteen-year old teenager should be saying. But he is living in cruel times. ‚ÄúThis is the first one. He was a villain who had a vision of a better world, but did horrible things to achieve it. I keep it here so that I remember him‚Ä¶ and I remember that ends do not justify all means.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat bird mask is quite cool.‚Äù Himiko comments. ‚ÄúWhat did he do?‚Äù

‚ÄúKept Eri in a locked cell deep underground and harvested her blood to use her quirk to produce anti-quirk bullets. For more than a year.‚Äù She stares at him with an abject horror on her face. ‚ÄúHe wanted a world of equality, and he saw quirks as something that made true equality impossible. And a form of disease. I still feel guilty for killing him‚Ä¶ but I do not regret it.‚Äù 

There is silence in the room for a while. Finally Himiko speaks. 

‚ÄúI love you. But I‚Äôm going to stab you dead if you ever do something like that.‚Äù Himiko, in general, had no problems with stabbing people. Even stabbing them to death. But there were lines she clearly wasn‚Äôt going to cross. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great.‚Äù Izuku replies with a smile. If he ever goes so far off, slaying him will be an act of heroism. The type he likes.

It is probably for the best that he doesn‚Äôt mention the ‚Äòhe bled her dry and then put her back together with his quirk‚Äô part. Nor the one where he disassembled her into a blood smear and then reassembled her back as a form of punishment. Multiple times. 

It greatly helped the ‚Äòno regrets‚Äô bit after he saw him slowly disassemble into a pool of blood in front of him, screaming curses and begging for life alternately. Overhaul died slowly. And he knew why.
Notes:

    Yes, Izuku can be scary. Then again, it's Overhaul we're talking about. It's kinda giving me the vibes from that one youtube animation when Izuku comes upon Tomura Shigaraki and the League about do the whole 'disarming' bit to captured Overhaul. He yells at Midoriya to save him (Midoriya is a hero, right?), only for Izuku and Tomura to exchange glances. Then Izuku says 'fuck him up', Tomura gives him a thumbs-up and Overhaul goes wtf.

    Seriously, that guy deserves it. He is objectively more horrible villain than pre-All for One copy Tomura Shigaraki on absolutely every field.

Chapter 5: Moving On
Summary:

    A small introduction to the world of chatting and messaging from the tags.

Chapter Text

FuckSchool: So how did your date go? 

Insomniac: You just want something to build another conspiracy theory about his family.

FuckSchool: Yes

Izuku checks their private group chat on the Villain Network first thing in the morning. Ok, first thing in the morning after Kurogiri warps Himiko out (she spent the night in the guest room). Everyone he invited joined it‚Ä¶ and Izuku is already starting to regret it. 

 

SmallMight: Honesty is a virtue

HandyMan: We are villains tho

SmallMight: Do you know how many supervillains failed because their followers lied to them

SmallMight: I am too young to fail so 

SmallMight: Honesty good

SmallMight: Unless you are talking to the police or heroes

Insomniac: great that you added the last part

Insomniac: I was about to phone local hero office to tell them about the League

FriendlyVampirePrincess: It was great

 

Oh no, Izuku thinks. 

 

FriendlyVampirePrincess: His parents are pretty cool

FriendlyVampirePrincess: And his little sister is the cutest thing I ever saw

FriendlyVampirePrincess: He also has a dog

FriendlyVampirePrincess: Izuku‚Äôs dog would probably chew All Might if someone told him to

 

She isn‚Äôt going to let that go, Izuku decides. 

 

FuckSchool: any of his parents looked like aliens

FriendlyVampirePrincess: -_-‚Äô

FriendlyVampirePrincess: one of the students in the USJ had a pink skin 

FriendlyVampirePrincess: and antenna-like horns

FriendlyVampirePrincess: compared to her SmallMight‚Äôs parents looked pretty human 

FuckSchool: disguises

HandyMan: weird

Insomniac: what? 

HandyMan: it‚Äôs so normal that it‚Äôs weird

 

Tenko has a point, Izuku decided. Point that needs to be addressed. Immediately, if possible. 

 

SmallMight: @FriendlyVampirePrincess forgot to mention that both of my parents are supervillains

FuckSchool: what

Insomniac: (o_o) 

HandyMan: ‚Ä¶ 

SmallMight: Can‚Äôt tell any details

SmallMight: both are thought to be dead

SmallMight: we have a deal

SmallMight: I don‚Äôt tell ANYONE who they are unless they specifically agreed to it and I keep my house‚Äôs location secret

SmallMight: In exchange they don‚Äôt butt into my business and support the League with some modest donations every month

SmallMight: so unless you decide to become my girlfriends, you can forget about finding out

HandyMan: not interested enough

Insomniac: ^ 

FuckSchool: can you at least play twenty questions with me

MissExplosion: I‚Äôm in if they let me make babies for them

FriendlyVampirePrincess: I‚Äôm ok with that if I‚Äôm the wife and you‚Äôre the mistress :3

 

Izuku sighs. Loudly. 

 

SmallMight: no

SmallMight: just no

SmallMight: I‚Äôm going to wake up as a cyborg after the first night

SmallMight: @Insomniac, @HandyMan and @FriendlyVampirePrincess are my heroes for being brave enough to sleep in the same building as @MissExplosion.

SmallMight: strengthening my image as a criminal mastermind by having a harem of deadly women isn‚Äôt worth it

Insomniac: she isn‚Äôt that bad

EverybodyLovesTheBartender: A week ago I ran into MissExplosion in front of your bedroom.

EverybodyLovesTheBartender: At night. With a welding torch and a number of parts.

EverybodyLovesTheBartender: She refused to elaborate on why she was there. 

EverybodyLovesTheBartender: I teleported her back to her room. Three times. 

Insomniac: oh shit she is that bad

 

[[SMALLMIGHT changed EVERYBODYLOVESTHEBARTENDER‚Äôs nickname to Papagiri]]

 

Papagiri: Please no. 

FriendlyVampirePrincess: please yes

SmallMight: technically more for an uncle to me, but certainly dad to half of the League

SmallMight: and certain cat

SmallMight: you know what I mean

SmallMight: my revenge will be terrible

Insomniac: did someone say cat

FuckSchool: Now i need details

Papagiri: His father wanted to do a swivel chair reveal inspired by an old film series they watched together.

Papagiri: Having a cat on your lap is apparently part of it. 

Papagiri: I provided the cat.

 

[[PAPAGIRI changed their nickname to CatProvider]]

[[SMALLMIGHT changed CATPROVIDER‚Äôs nickname to Papagiri]]

 

Papagiri: Excuse me for a moment. 

Papagiri: I found a stash of All Might merch in the headquarters and I need to do something with that.

Papagiri: On an unrelated note, does someone know how to find GPS coordinates of the nearest active volcano?  

 

[[SMALLMIGHT changed PAPAGIRI‚Äôs nickname to CatProvider]]

 

FriendlyVampirePrincess: lol

FuckSchool: xD

HandyMan: -_-‚Äô 

Insomniac: it‚Äôs great to know that our great leader is impervious to blackmail

Insomniac: also

Insomniac: Can I move to @SmallMight house

SmallMight: if you want my mom to sneak sleeping pills into your drink at 8pm then we can think about it

SmallMight: the first thing she did after seeing your face on the TV was asking me to tell you to go to bed earlier

Insomniac: dammit

SmallMight: also you aren‚Äôt insomniac you just watch cats and troll people on the internet until 4am

Insomniac: because I can‚Äôt sleep

SmallMight: did you even try

Insomniac: once, it was unpleasant

HandyMan: ok so a question

HandyMan: We had a great first fight, lots of experience and fame +500

HandyMan: gg would play again

HandyMan: but what now

 

That is‚Ä¶ a good question. Way too good. Actually Izuku was trying to not think about it too much for the past three days, since he was busy sorting out his family situation. And dealing with Himiko‚Äôs relationship status upgrade. 

 

SmallMight: Hard to say tbh.

SmallMight: I focused on the USJ attack, so I only have a general idea of what to do next.

SmallMight: We got our name out, and that‚Äôs great.

SmallMight: But we set the bar a bit too high I think.

SmallMight: If we start robbing banks after assassinating Number Three Hero it would look kinda weird

Insomniac: suffering from success

Insomniac: nice change from suffering from failures xD

FriendlyVampirePrincess: mood

MissExplosion: can we blow up local Detnerat factory

MissExplosion: i have JUST THE RIGHT BABY FOR THAT

CatProvider: You are storing high-yield explosives next to my bar?

MissExplosion: Yes

CatProvider: You just lost your internet privilege. 

MissExplosion: NO. 

CatProvider: Also I am confiscating the explosives. 

MissExplosion: YOU WON‚ÄôT TAKE MY BABY FROM ME

SmallMight: do it do it do it

SmallMight: @Insomniac go to her workshop and brainwash her before she does something crazy

Insomniac: brb

FriendlyVampirePrincess: now that this is sorted out, @SmallMight talk with us about the plans

FriendlyVampirePrincess: wait what was that explosion

SmallMight: WHAT EXPLOSION
HandyMan: she is trolling you

Insomniac: that‚Äôs my job

Insomniac: also @MissExplosion has been detained

Insomniac: she said where the bomb is

Insomniac: everything will be alright

SmallMight: I hope you aren‚Äôt trolling me while saying that because I know you well enough 

SmallMight: dying in flames is a small price to pay for a good joke in your twisted mind

Insomniac: on an unrelated note, does someone know a good expert at disarming bombs who can reach our headquarters within twenty minutes

 

In moments like these Izuku remembers that he is leading a villain organization that is mostly composed of teenagers. And Tenko. Who is a child at heart. They have skills and a certain form of suicidal bravery that only teenagers and young adults are capable of, but maturity is a completely different - and alien - thing. 

 

SmallMight: Dammit

SmallMight: Papagiri I call upon thee

SmallMight: status report

CatProvider: Situation has been dealt with. 

CatProvider: Insomniac is making fun of you.

Insomniac: traitorgiri

SmallMight: ok

SmallMight: also about the plan

SmallMight: we are going to lay low for a while

SmallMight: making another move right after is kinda suicidal

SmallMight: Nedzu is after us

SmallMight: We made sure to leave no traces 

SmallMight: but he is crazy good

SmallMight: and on high alert

SmallMight: so you can focus on your school @UA-Spy

UA-Spy: Reassuring.

UA-Spy: But you are right. Nedzu is strengthening security. He still thinks that you got the school plan from LaBrava. If you move against UA again soon, he will get suspicious.

UA-Spy: Wait until PowerLoader stops being THIS attentive to the cybersecurity before doing anything to UA. 

SmallMight: Well you heard it

SmallMight: The thing is, my plans aren‚Äôt exactly focused on UA

SmallMight: I don‚Äôt plan to invade it again, that‚Äôs for sure.

SmallMight: I actually kinda love that school? It was all about the Thunderbolt. 

UA-Spy: Great. So what‚Äôs the point of me being in it? 

SmallMight: High quality education and good work prospects with the diploma? 

UA-Spy: ‚Ä¶ 

FuckSchool: -_- 

FuckSchool: I hate UA. 

FriendlyVampirePrincess: we know

HandyMan: Yeah

Insomniac: yup, you mention that twice a week at least

 

Mustard has a general dislike for any schools perceived as elite‚Ä¶ and personal hatred for the UA. Which is also the reason for his slip into villainy. Izuku knows about it, and considers it a bit‚Ä¶ childish, but then again, he became a villain because his parents were villains. He isn‚Äôt one to judge. 

If Mustard saw that as enough of a reason to become a villain, then Izuku is alright with that. It wasn‚Äôt his job to talk people out of villainy - but it was his job to make them into ‚Äòproper‚Äô villains. Ones with skills, end goal, conviction and some personal creed to follow. 

 

SmallMight: Also I want you to keep an eye on the rat. And the kids. I think I see a few that could be potentially recruited in correct circumstances. 

SmallMight: Oh and telling me how their curriculum works is on the list too. 

SmallMight: It might be helpful in League training. 

UA-Spy: Okay, fine

UA-Spy: before I forget

UA-Spy: Blueberry mentioned that the Quirkless Liberation Front is planning something big

SmallMight: define big

UA-Spy: no clue

UA-Spy: Blueberry isn‚Äôt high enough in the ranks to know the details

UA-Spy: But it‚Äôs something really big

UA-Spy: Maybe not ‚ÄúCoup d‚Äôetat‚Äù big but‚Ä¶ big. And public.

UA-Spy: Eclipse herself will probably show up

UA-Spy: Going to happen within two months. 

UA-Spy: I might be able to warn you within a day or two prior to the event, but details and location are unlikely

UA-Spy: gtg, homeroom starts

SmallMight: k, will remember

SmallMight: OKAY SO BACK TO THE MAIN SUBJECT

HandyMan: finally

SmallMight: We need to make a proper statement to the world. 

SmallMight: Because right now the media made us sound like we tried to murder a bunch of children AND All Might. 

SmallMight: I‚Äôm literally too afraid to recruit people rn because we‚Äôd get the wrong kind of people

SmallMight: G-Man told me that F.U.C.K.I.N.G MUSCULAR asked him about us. 

FuckSchool: Oh shit

FriendlyVampirePrincess: who that

Insomniac: Nasty serial killer who brutalized a bunch of children.

FriendlyVampirePrincess: Oh shit 

SmallMight: So yeah

SmallMight: I have an idea but we‚Äôd need to contact someone who is notoriously hard to contact

SmallMight: isn‚Äôt on the Villain Network

SmallMight: isn‚Äôt a hero or a vigilante neither

SmallMight: might or might not be playing solo

SmallMight: and regularly changes location

SmallMight: worst of all this isn‚Äôt a manga so he isn‚Äôt going to randomly pop up in front of one us just because we‚Äôre in the same city while looking for him

SmallMight: oh and he might or might not consider most villains to be a kill-on-sight target

SmallMight: and we kinda share the outlook on All Might so he MIGHT try to murder us without giving us time to explain for what we did at the USJ

FuckSchool: Is this a form of twenty questions

Insomniac: oh shit I think I know who you talk about

Insomniac: you are crazier than MissExplosion

Insomniac: this is why I‚Äôm working with you lol

Insomniac: it‚Äôs never boring 

FuckSchool: fuck how
Insomniac: I spend half of my life on the internet

HandyMan: but still suck at videogames

Insomniac: at least I have a life

HandyMan: on the internet

SmallMight: marry already

HandyMan: FUCK YOU

HandyMan: #Team2DWomen

Insomniac: #TeamCaffeine

FuckSchool: OK SO I HAVE A QUESTION

Insomniac: not telling you who the guy is unless SmallMight admits

FuckSchool: no I just wanted to ask if SmallMight is Re-Destro‚Äôs illegitimate son

Insomniac: Jesus Christ he said that his parents are thought to be dead

FuckSchool: could be a logical ruse

FriendlyVampirePrincess: All I can say is that he has a copy of the Meta Liberation War

FriendlyVampirePrincess: in his study slash villain lair 

FuckSchool: Y E S

SmallMight: N O

SmallMight: I don‚Äôt even like his ideology

SmallMight: its quirkist

SmallMight: but I collect villain stuff

SmallMight: also asking my own father for an autograph would be super weird

FuckSchool: so are you an illegitimate child of Mr. Compress and Eclipse

SmallMight: I‚Äôm so done with you all and I‚Äôm not telling you whom I looking for

SmallMight: Insomniac don‚Äôt tell them

SmallMight: even if they bribe you with coffee

Insomniac: ok

SmallMight: write me a private message about whom you are thinking about

Insomniac: ok

SmallMight: ALRIGHT I CHECKED IT

SmallMight: Insomniac is correct

SmallMight: MysteryGuy is quite chatty so I‚Äôll have Insomniac accompany me on the hunt

SmallMight: holy shit now that I think about MG‚Äôs quirk, it‚Äôs going to be ironic if he gets caught in Insomniac‚Äôs

Insomniac: YOU KNOW HIS QUIRK?! 

SmallMight: yeah it‚Äôs pretty cool

Insomniac: how

Insomniac: like, how

Insomniac: this is like the second most mysterious quirk in Japan after All Might‚Äôs 

Insomniac: and maybe Mr. Compress

SmallMight: I know his quirk. I know where he went to school.  I even know his real name.

SmallMight: he just doesn‚Äôt use it anymore so it won‚Äôt be helpful

Insomniac: you what

FuckSchool: I‚Äôm regretting asking those questions. 

FriendlyVampirePrincess: Tell me the truth

SmallMight: no 

 

[[FRIENDLYVAMPIREPRINCESS changed their nickname to VampirePrincess]]

 

FuckSchool: SHOTS FIRED SHOTS FIRED

SmallMight: Himi

SmallMight: no

SmallMight: it will be a surprise

SmallMight: you‚Äôll like him

SmallMight: unless he murders you first

VampirePrincess: o-o 

HandyMan: speak

FuckSchool: spit it out

SmallMight: If I get my mom to cook you all something tasty, will you drop the subject

VampirePrincess: Immediately and wholeheartedly

FuckSchool: okay now I‚Äôm looking forward to the food that‚Äôs THIS good

 

It is time to make a handful of other talks. There are a few secret chats that he is a part of. He isn‚Äôt exactly hanging on Giran when it comes to intelligence gathering. That man is reasonably loyal to whoever‚Äôs paying him, but you never know who goes after him with a brainwashing quirk. 

The idea of some truth-enforcing quirk hero coming near the information broker is probably a common nightmare for the Japanese underworld. 

 

Satan 2: Hello there.

DoctorEvil: How can I help you? 

Satan 2: how many 2nd gen noumus are ready

DoctorEvil: Depends.

DoctorEvil: Ready as in can fight, or ready as in can fight and follow orders? 

DoctorEvil: Training 2nd gen takes more time than the quirk implantation itself.

Satan 2: fight and follow orders

Satan 2: or at least not attack unrelated people

DoctorEvil: You are still hanging on to that?
Satan 2: I literally just came forward with my existence

Satan 2: I have a (small) fanclub of edgy people on the internet

Satan 2: I‚Äôm not All for One

Satan 2: I need to uphold an image

Satan 2: Political terrorism kinda hangs on it

 

It is probably better sounding than ‚ÄúI DO NOT WANT TO KILL RANDOM PEOPLE YOU NUTJOB‚Äù. The Doctor is useful, but he is from the AlO‚Äôs school of evil. Unfortunately, Izuku has to lie a bit. 

The last thing he wants is the Doctor going renegade. 

 

DoctorEvil: Seven.

DoctorEvil: But they aren‚Äôt High Ends like Hellhound

DoctorEvil: Top Tens will take them down almost instantly.

DoctorEvil: Would do alright against regular heroes. 

DoctorEvil: Or as a distraction.

Satan 2: Alright

Satan 2: Keep three of them combat ready at all time during the next two months

Satan 2: ready to warp at the moment‚Äôs notice

DoctorEvil: Something I should know?
Satan 2: League‚Äôs member has a childhood friend in a villain group that I will not mention for personal reasons

Satan 2: they just made a ‚Äòwatch yourself during the next two months‚Äô comment

Satan 2: implying that something nasty is going to happen

Satan 2: I don‚Äôt know when or where

Satan 2: but I prefer to have something to cover my retreat if shit hits the fan

DoctorEvil: Japan is big.

Satan 2: Yes but I don‚Äôt like the fact that this came up literally two days after we‚Äôve hit UA. 

Satan 2: Might be a coincidence, but you never know. 

Satan 2: Better safe than sorry. 

DoctorEvil: Understandable. I will do as you ask. 

 

Just one conversation left. This time not on the Villain Network, but on a completely different site. Izuku has to refresh an old working relationship‚Ä¶ he can only hope that it is still a thing. 

 

Akatani Mikumo: Yo 

Sawa Takeo: what is it

 

Instant answer? That‚Äôs unexpected. Both names are fake, but‚Ä¶ well, that is to be expected considering the circumstances. 

 

Akatani Mikumo: need to find someone

Sawa Takeo: i assume you can‚Äôt just ask the police about them

Akatani Mikumo: yes

Akatani Mikumo: they are looking for him too

Akatani Mikumo: I prefer to find him first

Sawa Takeo: very well

Sawa Takeo: but you DO know that the Alliance will want something from you

Sawa Takeo: depending on how serious the thing is

Sawa Takeo: who is it

Akatani Mikumo: Stendhal

Sawa Takeo: are you fucking kidding me

Sawa Takeo: no you most certainly do

Akatani Mikumo: chill down

Akatani Mikumo: it‚Äôs important

Akatani Mikumo: I can offer things in exchange

Sawa Takeo: listen 

Sawa Takeo: I have you in my contact list because you gave us an info about several notable criminal hideouts

Sawa Takeo: like three years ago

Sawa Takeo: which was pretty cool btw.

Sawa Takeo: and we are thankful and consider ourselves to be somewhat indebted

Sawa Takeo: but you were silent for a long time

Sawa Takeo: and I don‚Äôt even know who you are

Akatani Mikumo: good

Akatani Mikumo: works both way

Akatani Mikumo: I have some new things

Akatani Mikumo: you won‚Äôt like them

Akatani Mikumo: but I need to find Stendhal

Sawa Takeo: isn‚Äôt he dead or retired

Akatani Mikumo: he isn‚Äôt and that‚Äôs kinda a problem

Akatani Mikumo: for a lot of people

Akatani Mikumo: he is very active but rebranded

Akatani Mikumo: I hope that someone knows anything about him on your end

Akatani Mikumo: might be even stuff like a coffee shop he frequented

Akatani Mikumo: would have preferred to know any of his associates that might be still in contact secretly or any sort of safehouse

Sawa Takeo: give me a moment

 

He waits for two hours. During which he eats breakfast (his mom is wonderful and completely understanding - she even brings it to his study so he doesn‚Äôt have to stop his scheming and planning). 

 

Sawa Takeo: the Alliance conditionally agrees

Akatani Mikumo: let me guess

Akatani Mikumo: conditionally as in ‚Äòdepends on what your stuff is‚Äô

Sawa Takeo: yeah

Akatani Mikumo: okay so I have two things

Akatani Mikumo: nr.1 ‚Üí Hero Killer is the Stendhal‚Äôs new brand

Sawa Takeo: what

Akatani Mikumo: I know that for certain

Akatani Mikumo: don‚Äôt question it

Akatani Mikumo: I like his new aesthetic though not exactly what he is doing

Akatani Mikumo: nr.2 ‚Üí Quirkless Liberation Front is planning something big and public within the next two months

Akatani Mikumo: I do not know the location nor the exact time, but it‚Äôs apparently some major operation

Akatani Mikumo: Eclipse will almost certainly show up in person

Akatani Mikumo: There is a chance (50/50) that I will be able to warn you a day or two before it happens, but I can‚Äôt promise that and I‚Äôll probably not know the location and what they are planning to do exactly

Akatani Mikumo: deal?

Sawa Takeo: yes, we‚Äôll send you what we know today or tomorrow

Sawa Takeo: Are you alright with us telling the heroes that something nasty is going to happen

Akatani Mikumo: What heroes

Sawa Takeo: Eraserhead should be leaving the hospital today. Probably Ingenium too. 

 

So either the underground heroes (they were well organized and, in all honesty, rather close with the Alliance, though officially the heroes were after it) or the surface ones. 

 

Akatani Mikumo: Tell Eraserhead

Akatani Mikumo: I kinda owe him something

Sawa Takeo: For?

Akatani Mikumo: not telling, bye





Chapter 6: Changes
Summary:

    Search for the Mystery Guy continues, and Hosu is growing increasingly... interesting place to be in.

Chapter Text

Shota Aizawa likes teaching. This isn‚Äôt something that he would admit in public (then again, there aren't a lot of things that he is willing to admit in public, he enjoys privacy). Especially when the public includes his quote unquote friends or the students that have the misfortune of being HIS students. 

He might have been wounded in the USJ attack - but it isn‚Äôt the first nor the last time. That is no reason to not show up to school. He is no longer unconscious after all. And he can both walk and speak - what else does he need?

He trained the kids well. There is silence in the class within three seconds. Good. Wasting time was illogical. 

‚ÄúPrincipal Nedzu told me to make an announcement.‚Äù Eraserhead says, ignoring the way Bakugou flinched at the name. He has no idea what the crazed rat talked about with Bakugou, but it was probably something utterly terrifying. Despite his lack of knowledge, he agreed to not expel Bakugou, despite the kid‚Äôs illogical charge being the cause of his teacher‚Äôs injuries. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about the sports festival.‚Äù 

‚ÄúA sports festival?!‚Äù One of the kids asks in visible shock. It is probably another case of students being surprised by something normal. Are they still traumatized by what he did on the first day? Is normal school stuff during the homeroom this surprising? 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs gonna get cancelled‚Ä¶‚Äù Uraraka looks crestfallen. Probably wants to show her parents her progress or something else like that. He doesn‚Äôt really care. 

‚ÄúNedzu decided to go forward with it.‚Äù Aizawa announces. There were some mixed reactions to this statement. ‚ÄúCalling it off would only make the UA look bad and rob you of a precious opportunity to showcase your skills to pro heroes out there. The security will be significantly tightened, however. Five times more police, numerous heroes on the standby and so on. I was also told to remind you to be cautious.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by ‚Äòcautious‚Äô, Aizawa-sensei?‚Äù Iida and his weird hand movements. Irritating, but he performed admirably during the USJ attack so Aizawa decides to not be irritated this one time. 

‚ÄúThe League has apparently made it a point to NOT attack you.‚Äù Aizawa replies. ‚ÄúFor which I‚Äôm thankful. However the problem is that the UA‚Äôs reputation and Nedzu‚Äôs legendary viciousness deterred a lot of problems from this city, and both those things were weakened by the attack. So for as long as Legion is out there, there‚Äôs a possibility that another group will get inspired by his achievement. So no late evening lone walks, no unsupervised meetings with people you meet on the internet, and no talking with suspicious people, got it?‚Äù 

He prefers to remind them of that. Those are pretty much the baseline rules of living in modern Japan. Kidnappings of kids and teenagers with strong quirks happen.  Villain groups either sell them somewhere or end up recruiting them down the line. 

He is still pretty certain that Mineta will ignore all of that if the villains use a woman as bait. He still didn‚Äôt quite figure out why he didn‚Äôt expel the kid during the quirk test. Was he getting soft? Should he remind himself and the kids that he is anything but soft?

‚ÄúThe school festival will happen in two weeks.‚Äù Aizawa continues. ‚ÄúYou have time to hone your skills until then. This is going to be one of the three occasions to show yourself to the world during your stay in the UA. Do not waste it.‚Äù He gives them a few seconds to swallow the information.

‚ÄúEveryone but Ochaco, Asui, Ejirou, Jiro and Katsuki are dismissed.‚Äù He announces. There are a few awkward stares and unspoken questions. But then the room (mostly) vacates. 

The five students that remain are obviously nervous. Especially Bakugou. Seriously, what did Nedzu do to the kid? He earned some serious scolding and/or getting expelled, not lifetime psychological damage. 

‚ÄúI AM HERE!‚Äù The living headache announces, while storming into the class. ‚ÄúWITH SOME ANSWERS!‚Äù

The students‚Äô eyes lighten up. Eraserhead still doesn‚Äôt understand the All Might‚Äôs appeal. Sure, he punched out a lot of heavy-hitter villains, but other than that, his appearance and mannerisms are irritating.

‚ÄúBefore we start, I wanted to personally thank all of you except for Bakugou.‚Äù Eraserhead announces. ‚ÄúRecovery Girl told me that I would be in a way worse shape if you didn‚Äôt give me first aid on the field. You did a good job.‚Äù 

He could use his scarf to patch a wound‚Ä¶ but he happened to lose it after he used it in the maximum range to stop Legion from killing one of his students. At least it was recovered. 

‚ÄúBut after that happened you and Bakugou heard something that you shouldn‚Äôt exactly hear.‚Äù Eraserhead continues. ‚ÄúYou were told to not mention any details of the attack to anyone by the police. Originally we planned to leave things at that, but there has been a change of plans. All Might wishes to address Legion‚Äôs claims about his quirk.‚Äù There is a mixture of shock and curiosity in the faces in front of him. ‚ÄúYou are allowed to leave this room now. If you stay, you‚Äôll learn something that has to remain a secret. You will not be allowed to talk with your parents about it. You will not be allowed to tell your friends about it. In fact, we heavily discourage talking about it between you, as there is always a risk that someone overhears it.‚Äù 

Asui raises her hand.

‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs such a secret, why do you want to tell us about it-kero?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve decided that having some students be aware of the situation will be beneficial.‚Äù All Might announces. If Eraserhead‚Äôs gut feeling is correct, ‚Äòwe‚Äô meant Nedzu and/or Nighteye. All Might recently spent an awful amount of time with the latter. ‚ÄúYou can also consider this a form of hero training. Even the surface ones sometimes need to hold a secret.‚Äù 

In the end, they all decide to stay. Even Bakugou. Eraserhead is faintly proud. 

‚ÄúVery well.‚Äù All Might says. Then he deflates in a cloud of steam. 

‚ÄúWoah!‚Äù Kirishima is the most expressive among the students. Asui and Uraraka merely stare. Bakugou stares too but with something akin to fright in his face. ‚ÄúWhat the hell?!‚Äù 

All Might pulls up his shirt, exposing his rather horrific wound. This time everyone stares with terror on their face. 

‚ÄúSix years ago I fought against a villain.‚Äù All Might speaks with a solemn tone. ‚ÄúI cannot tell you who it was, as the government decided to keep his existence a secret. I have managed to defeat him, but not without losing a stomach and one of the lungs. Ever since then my power has a time limit. One that decreases each time I overuse it‚Ä¶ like I did in the USJ.‚Äù None of the kids utter a single word - that is quite a revelation to be hit with. But Aizawa spots a movement on Kirishima‚Äôs lips, something that appears to be a wordless ‚Äòso manly‚Äô. 

This year‚Äôs kids are going to be the death of him. He is absolutely certain of that.

‚ÄúWe thought that this managed to remain a secret, but it appears that Legion managed to figure it out.‚Äù All Might continues. ‚ÄúAnd here comes your part in all of that.‚Äù He looks at Eraserhead, who takes that as a sign to take over.

‚ÄúNedzu decided to ‚Äòhire‚Äô All Might‚Äôs other form as a teacher under the name of Yagi Toshinori.‚Äù Eraserhead says. ‚ÄúWe are going to be doing our best to stop him from overexerting himself, but it‚Äôll probably not work in the end.‚Äù He makes a loud sigh. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre now aware of the secret and we expect you to help in maintaining it. This means providing diversion when All Might needs to abruptly vanish and change into Yagi Toshinori. Deflecting questions as to why their clothes tend to match-up weirdly often and so on.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf the absolute worst comes to happen and USJ will happen again...‚Äù All Might takes over. ‚Äú... you‚Äôll be aware of the symptoms of me reaching the limits. Which means that you will know when to urge your classmates to retreat, despite me being around. Even without me telling you to do it.‚Äù 

Aizawa doesn‚Äôt say that aloud, but he is pretty certain that Bakugou and probably Kirishima would have rather tried to help All Might. That man‚Äôs brain is working well enough to know that much. 

He can only hope that there will be no occasion for that to happen. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúZukuuu‚Ä¶‚Äù Himiko suddenly speaks. ‚ÄúSo can you tell me whom we‚Äôre looking for?‚Äù 

Izuku knew that he was going to regret the decision to let her join the search party. He did it regardless. It wasn‚Äôt exactly favouritism - she had a point when she said that they could use someone skilled in melee. 

Mindscrew is there too, wearing a hoodie. Then again, they all wear those. And when they left the hero-patrolled part of Hosu, they also added some masks and moved knives to visible parts of their bodies. 

This isn‚Äôt a safe place to be in. And it is best to show the locals that they meant business. 

‚ÄúSo after getting his mom‚Äôs cooking you also want to get the intel?‚Äù Mindscrew comments from the sideway. ‚ÄúGreedy.‚Äù 

‚ÄúShe has a point.‚Äù Izuku says, and Himiko beams. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre literally looking for him right now. Together. Looking for someone you don‚Äôt know is kinda counterproductive.‚Äù 

‚ÄúStill greedy but alright.‚Äù Mindscrew wants to be the only one on the secret, probably for the purpose of some practical joke. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking for the Hero Killer, Himi.‚Äù That surprises her. 

‚ÄúThat serial killer targeting heroes?‚Äù She replies finally. ‚ÄúHe is famous, yes, but why are we looking for him? Isn‚Äôt he‚Ä¶ I mean, I figured out that you‚Äôd hate him?‚Äù She probably isn‚Äôt up to date with the situation.

‚ÄúHero Killer targets corrupt heroes.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúMini-Thunderbolts. He has a very well defined idea of a hero as someone who saves others simply because they can, not to gain fame or wealth. He doesn‚Äôt touch rescue heroes nor the underground ones, but he hits a lot of surface ones that were abusing their position or did something unheroic, such as go after him instead of saving someone in danger and so on.‚Äù 

He doesn‚Äôt mention how many heroes he slew just happened to be aligned with the Hero Public Safety Commission. Stain probably has a personal grudge with it, and if so, then it is one of the many points where their interests are connected. 

Stain doesn‚Äôt hit him as someone particularly well organized in terms of gathering information. A lot of his judgments are a product of passion. One hero died because he came upon Stain about to finish a heavily wounded hero - and attacked the Hero Killer instead of trying to save the other hero. So, Stain judged him as a fake hero, who was willing to abandon a human in need to gain fame through taking down the Hero Killer. 

But others are well researched. Did Stain get someone to help him? Someone to find ailing heroes for him? Whoever they are, they are good. Very good. Izuku-would-like-to-work-with-them good. 

‚ÄúOhhhh, I see now!‚Äù Himiko claps her hands in joy. ‚ÄúYou want to use Mr. Stainy to make people understand that we are after nasty heroes too. And thus fix the bad rep that we got, yes?‚Äù 

Izuku is very happy that their masks just happened to be both voice changers AND communication equipment. They are the only people who heard the talk. Having someone overhear Himiko would be catastrophic.

‚ÄúYes, but the problem is that Stain is probably the only person out there who idolizes All Might more than I do.‚Äù He replies. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm kinda afraid that he will just try to stab me when he recognizes me as the Legion. I think I know how to pacify him, but to achieve that I need him to listen to my words instead of trying to stab me. So, you know, keep the League part silent, alright?‚Äù 

‚ÄúAlright!‚Äù Himiko makes a salute, which probably looks super weird to anyone watching them. 

‚ÄúAnd since he stabbed Green Gauntlet to death in Hosu three days ago, we know that he is here, right?‚Äù This time it is Mindscrew. ‚ÄúSince he always attacks a few people in a city before moving elsewhere.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes, and we are going to patrol the edges of the hero patrolled zones in Hosu during the late evenings and nights, which is when he does his job.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúAlthough before that happens, we‚Äôre heading to an old safehouse that I managed to track with my masterful information-gathering skills.‚Äù Which meant simply that he knew whom to ask and had something to bribe them with for an answer. 

He hopes that it is still occupied. Patrolling means danger. Worse, if they fail to find Stain before his next hit, they will probably end up having to shadow the potential targets, and that was an even greater danger. 

That‚Äôs when someone contacts them. A message from the Villain Network is displayed on his mask‚Äôs glass. 

 

MissExplosion: My baby has its eyes on the location!

MissExplosion: Someone‚Äôs there. 

MissExplosion: You‚Äôll give me back my explosive baby for that, yes? Yes? 

 

He switches his mask to a speech-to-text mode and answers her.

 

***

 

There is someone on the lookout in front of the abandoned building that is supposedly a local safehouse of Stendhal. 

Unfortunately they have a hoodie. With a mask. So he has no idea who they are. 

Ironic.

‚ÄúWe come in peace.‚Äù Izuku shouts from a (probably) safe distance of about twenty meters. ‚ÄúJust want to talk.‚Äù He used a slightly older voice. He is sixteen years old, nobody would take him seriously unless he would admit that he is the Legion. And if his suspicions about the person in front of them are correct, that would have ended in bloodshed. 

‚ÄúAbout?‚Äù The man answers. He is weirdly relaxed for someone faced by three unknowns who were obviously hiding their identities. Probably wasn‚Äôt alone. 

 

MissExplosion: Sniper on the building one hundred meters in front of you.

MissExplosion: That‚Äôs some super cool baby!

MissExplosion: I can make a better one, though, ask them if they want one for me, please

MissExplosion: Or give me my explosive baby back! 

 

Of course. That explains the lack of fear. And there is probably someone else too, in the process of searching the hideout. 

‚ÄúStendhal.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúI heard that he had a safehouse here.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù The man replies. ‚Äú... you must be Akatani Mikumo.‚Äù That confirms Izuku‚Äôs suspicions. There is still a minuscule change that during the last three years the underground heroes (or other villains) managed to infiltrate the Alliance enough to intercept his inquiry, though.

‚ÄúAnd you must be from the Vigilante Alliance.‚Äù Neither Himiko nor Hitoshi move (much less speak), but Izuku is certain that they have to be quite surprised by that announcement. ‚ÄúI think I mentioned that I wanted to find Stendhal first.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, but if your intel is correct, this is kinda personal.‚Äù The vigilante shrugs ‚ÄúIf someone finds out what he is doing now, the Hero Commission will have a serious motivation to go after us. Thus far we‚Äôve mostly stayed under the radar. Besides, it‚Äôs not like you told us why you want Stendhal.‚Äù 

And he isn‚Äôt going to. What is he supposed to say? ‚ÄòWell, we‚Äôre going to shoot a commercial about murdering people together?‚Äô The first rule when you have a sniper aiming at you is to not give them a reason to pull the trigger.

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù Izuku shrugs. ‚ÄúBut let‚Äôs make an agreement. If we get him first, you won‚Äôt intervene. If you find him first, we won‚Äôt intervene. And whoever finds him, tells the other side about it so that they can stop wasting time on useless search.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can work with that.‚Äù The hooded man replies. ‚ÄúYou have the deal.‚Äù 

Izuku nods and turns his back on him. His comrades follow. Naturally, they don't let him stay silent for long. 

‚ÄúOkay, so I‚Äôm going to ask the question.‚Äù Mindscrew says. ‚ÄúHow the hell do you know people from the Vigilante Alliance?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou remember the bit where my parents are retired supervillains?‚Äù Izuku asks. ‚ÄúWell, a few years ago my father gave me a list of his old associates that he personally disliked. And I gave it to the Alliance. So we kinda have an‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶ working relationship?‚Äù 

‚ÄúAre you sure you are sixteen years old?‚Äù Mindscrew asks. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get how you fit so many events in your life.‚Äù Probably by not wasting 95% of it on cats, coffee and internet, but Izuku decides to be a bit more diplomatic than that. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sixteen years old but my father started introducing me to the business when I was eight years old.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt meet an actual villain until I was eleven years old, save for Kurogiri, Himiko and Tenko, though. Mom was against making me meet bad people too early, so it was mostly theory, and stuff like information gathering, quirk analysis and interpersonal skills.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat explains a lot.‚Äù Hitoshi replies. ‚ÄúNerd.‚Äù Himiko chuckles in the background. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúSo, who was that?‚Äù He hears from the earphone. Of course she would get interested. 

‚ÄúThe guy who told us about Stendhal.‚Äù The vigilante replies. Somewhere far away a certain sniper makes a thoughtful face. ‚ÄúPlus some bodyguards, I think. Wanted to know if we found anything.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd did we find anything?‚Äù She asks.

‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù Another voice speaks. ‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt here for a long time. I‚Äôm about to leave, so we should be able to wrap this all up soon.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHide yourself well before leaving the building.‚Äù The sniper says. ‚ÄúThere is a drone hanging over you. I think they found me before or during the talk. Whoever they are, they are good. And you are a bit too much of a public figure, Hauler.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Crawler, dammit.‚Äù There is laughter on the network.

Stain is notoriously hard to find. It isn‚Äôt surprising. Everyone wants to get him. Heroes for killing or maiming so many of them. Vigilantes for being a PR risk to them. Local criminals too, because he has no mercy for thugs and villains because while heroes are his target, he will judge villains for lacking a cause if he runs into them. 

One week after the meeting between the Vigilante Alliance and Izuku he strikes again. The hero in question survived, but was unlikely to fully recover from the wounds and would probably have to end his hero career. 

Judging from someone releasing evidence of him molesting an intern at his hero agency on the internet after the attack, it is probably over for him even if he fully recovered. Not like Izuku has an issue with that. He would probably be only marginally irritated if Stain actually killed that ‚Äòhero‚Äô. 

They switch to tailing the heroes that Izuku decides are likely to be targeted. A tactic that is risky, but not like he has an alternative. At least Hitoshi is good at staying unnoticed (he doesn‚Äôt even have to try, he really has a low profile) and Himiko is an absolute master in that field. 

A day before the UA school festival he gets an unexpected message. On a private hidden chat that he uses to contact his spy in the UA about things that he isn‚Äôt sure if he wanted the League as a whole to know. 

 

UA-Spy: Alright so I have‚Ä¶ news. From Blueberry.

UA-Spy: You aren‚Äôt going to like them. At all. 

 

Izuku is watching a film with Himiko and Mustard in the League‚Äôs hideout. Tenko is playing on a console in the background. Unfortunately, while the film is nice, Izuku has priorities. 

 

SmallMight: Talk to me.

UA-Spy: Yeah, so Blueberry apparently got a promotion in the QLF.

UA-Spy: She joined one of their combat cells. Started soldier training and all of that.

UA-Spy: She now knows a lot more and is willing to talk with me about it. 

UA-Spy: I‚Äôm sure she won‚Äôt talk about anything really incriminating, so don‚Äôt expect me to tell you where to find Eclipse, or any of the QLF bases. 

UA-Spy: She is loyal to the QLF, but she trusts me

UA-Spy: I wouldn‚Äôt tell you a thing if I thought that this would endanger her or caused lasting damages to the QLF

SmallMight: good

SmallMight: I‚Äôm a late bloomer

SmallMight: Spend years as a quirkless

SmallMight: So I know why they do what they do, I don‚Äôt support it but I‚Äôm not going to fight them over it

SmallMight: I just prefer them to not plant a bomb somewhere near me

SmallMight: or end the society as we know it before we are ready for that

SmallMight: tell me what you feel comfortable about sharing

UA-Spy: k

UA-Spy: she is positively terrified of the amount of stuff the QLF amassed

UA-Spy: they are apparently pretty much drowning in weaponry, explosives, and support equipment

UA-Spy: and that‚Äôs just her cell

SmallMight: someone is supporting them?

UA-Spy: no clue, it‚Äôs not like they explain that to new recruits

UA-Spy: here comes the bad news

SmallMight: worse than what you already said?

UA-Spy: yes

UA-Spy: you remember that Tokyo bombing campaign two years ago

SmallMight: yes?

UA-Spy: they were something like five combat cells involved in that

UA-Spy: largest joint operation of the QLF to date

UA-Spy: Blueberry said that this time they are amassing F I F T Y combat cells

 

That was an ‚Äòoh crap‚Äô level of intel. 

 

SmallMight: are they trying to pull Re-Destro on Japan

SmallMight: i don‚Äôt think that it can survive another successful secession

UA-Spy: dunno but they have at least one thousand well-trained fanatics who literally live to see the world burn involved and that‚Äôs bad news 

UA-Spy: even worse; they also have some other groups involved

UA-Spy: she heard mentions of not only combat cells but also some ‚Äòdemolition‚Äô and ‚Äòheavy weapons‚Äô cells being involved

UA-Spy: numbers unknown, nature unknown

UA-Spy: also her cell helped smuggle something apparently?

UA-Spy: they guarded a warehouse with some stuff for a while

UA-Spy: she has no idea what it was, but she said that a guy with white hair that kinda formed into something like an arrow was involved?

SmallMight: oh boy

UA-Spy: you know him?

SmallMight: yeah 

UA-Spy: I‚Äôm not even surprised by you knowing things anymore

UA-Spy: who is it? 

SmallMight: Chronostasis

SmallMight: Member of the Shie Hasseikai. 

UA-Spy: the heck is that? 

SmallMight: Yakuza group. 

SmallMIght: Major player when it comes to Trigger production and distribution until recently

SmallMight: I figured out that they closed off but it seems that not all of them kicked the bucket

UA-Spy: this is only going to get worse, doesn‚Äôt it? 

SmallMight: Another talk, gtg, thx for the info

 

He jumped into another message network. 

 

Akatani Mikumo: Okay so I have good and bad news

Akatani Mikumo: it‚Äôs about the QLF thing

Sawa Takeo: quick check

Sawa Takeo: did we have a meeting about two weeks ago

Akatani Mikumo: In Hosu, yes, that was me, nice hoodie

Sawa Takeo: alright

Sawa Takeo: what is it

Sawa Takeo: btw eraserhead says that if you have a source in QLF he wants in and offers full anonymity +a lot of favours from the underground heroes

Sawa Takeo: they are notoriously hard to infiltrate

Akatani Mikumo: nope

Akatani Mikumo: this is a bit of a special situation and not really a source

Sawa Takeo: ?

Akatani Mikumo: ok, so in short, a friend with a ‚Äòvillainous‚Äô quirk wanted to be a hero. Saved a few years older quirkless girl from being raped when he was nine years old

Akatani Mikumo: then ‚Äòhero‚Äô rolls in and suddenly they are both responsible for an assault on some poor people. actually ended up in a juvie

Akatani Mikumo: they bonded over that, she tells him about stuff but he isn‚Äôt going to tell me anything that might seriously endanger QLF or her. so not a source of info, more like a source of gossip from the organization

Sawa Takeo: this country is such a shitty place to live smh

Akatani Mikumo: to quote someone I know: mood

Sawa Takeo: okay so give me the news 

Akatani Mikumo: good thing is that she was recently promoted and joined a combat cell, so she now has some actual intel about the operation to happen

Akatani Mikumo: bad news is the intel I got

Sawa Takeo: that bad? 

Akatani Mikumo: Tokyo bombing campaign included five combat cells

Akatani Mikumo: this time they are mobilizing FIFTY combat cells for a single operation

Sawa Takeo: oh shit

Akatani Mikumo: my thoughts almost exactly [it was ‚Äòoh crap‚Äô]

Akatani Mikumo: also they got some incredible funding, are pretty much drowning in weaponry, explosives and support items

Akatani Mikumo: and besides the combat cells there are also going to be some ‚Äòheavy weapons‚Äô and ‚Äòdemolition‚Äô cells involved in the operation [no details on what they are]

Sawa Takeo: i don‚Äôt like the sound of that

Akatani Mikumo: Also tell Eraserhead that QLF is in the bed with the Shie Hasseikai remnants

Akatani Mikumo: they are/were to Trigger what UA is to heroics

Akatani Mikumo: gossip-source‚Äôs cell was guarding a warehouse possibly full of Trigger for them, and Chronostasis (major SH member) was involved [but she won‚Äôt tell us the location]

Akatani Mikumo: My intel on SH is old but I know a lot about the way it operated in the past (I know quirks of all notable members of it as they were one and half years ago, plus a lot of personal stuff), I might be interesting in selling it for favours

Sawa Takeo: we or the underground heroes will probably take you up on that offer

Akatani Mikumo: gtg, stay safe
Chapter 7: The Past
Summary:

    Let's just say that Overhaul's research is going to be playing a crucial role in this fanfic.

Chapter Text

The school festival is a pain in the ass, at least in Eraserhead‚Äôs opinion. It is bad enough that he is constantly overworked - he is a hero, a teacher and, for some reason, a certain rat‚Äôs main contact in the tight-knit community of underground heroes. And vigilantes. 

And then his quote unquote best friend somehow ropes him into being a commentator for the event. He still doesn‚Äôt know how exactly that happened, and that is bad because without knowing what he did wrong he can‚Äôt avoid such a mistake in the future. 

However, the event is now finally over. Eraserhead sighs with relief and vanishes from the booth, not even waiting for All Might to decorate the winner (Endeavour is probably proud of his son). 

Then he sees a familiar face approaching him. And his newly gained good humour vanishes. 

‚ÄúYou know, I should probably ask how one of the key members of the Vigilante Alliance managed to sneak in. Despite all the additional security.‚Äù He says, while Crawler smiles at him apologetically. ‚ÄúBut I think I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm just happy that the festival‚Äôs over.‚Äù 

‚ÄúGonna leave something to your imagination, old man.‚Äù Koichi‚Äôs smile grows wider. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say that I‚Äôm here legally.‚Äù 

Yeah, right. And let‚Äôs ignore the part where his very existence is illegal, because he is a wanted man in Japan. 

‚ÄúSo, why are you here?‚Äù Eraserhead asks. 

‚ÄúCan we have a talk?‚Äù Crawler replies. ‚ÄúAkatani gave me some concerning intel.‚Äù 

Crawler is normally a ray of sunshine in the form of man. If he thinks something is ‚Äòconcerning‚Äô, it probably is. He wasn‚Äôt a hero - just a kid in the costume - but he survived as a vigilante long enough for Eraserhead to treat him seriously. 

‚ÄúFine, but not here.‚Äù The underground hero replies. ‚ÄúThe rat is watching.‚Äù He knows of just the right place, and a part of him wonders how long it would take Present Mic to find him. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúCat cafe, really?‚Äù Koichi isn‚Äôt impressed. 

‚ÄúYou have a problem with my choice?‚Äù Eraserhead asks while a cat lands itself on his lap. They are old acquaintances at this point, and the cat knows that it‚Äôs a comfortable place. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù Crawler retreats. Not a fight that he can win. ‚ÄúI relayed your offer to Akatani. He refused.‚Äù

‚ÄúTsk.‚Äù Eraserhead hoped for a different answer. The Quirkless Liberation Front is legendarily hard to infiltrate. To begin with, they only accept quirkless or those who are late bloomers (like Eclipse), and thus spent years being discriminated against as quirkless. 

It is hard to find someone like that who is willing to work with the heroes. Or with anyone who was quirked. 

‚ÄúDid he say why?‚Äù Eraserhead hopes that it was something that can be fixed with a bigger bribe. 

‚ÄúApparently his friend with a quote unquote villainous quirk saved a quirkless girl from rape.‚Äù Koichi is visibly disgusted with the last word. ‚ÄúDreamed of being a hero, but when an actual hero showed up, the two of them ended up in a juvie together for an assault. So they bonded over that. Said girl has joined the QLF, but she trusts her friend enough to share some gossip. Or perhaps more than that, but said friend will not divulge anything that could actually threaten the QLF or the girl.‚Äù

‚ÄúStupid prejudices just costed us another hero with a potential.‚Äù Eraserhead wishes he knew the name of the ‚Äòhero‚Äô responsible for that. He would do something nasty and creative. Or ask Nedzu to do it for him.  Wouldn‚Äôt be the first time, all things considered. ‚ÄúWonderful. But I assume you have more than that to talk about?"

‚ÄúAnother dose of said gossip.‚Äù Koichi replies. ‚ÄúQLF has much better funding than anyone thought, and is, apparently, ‚Äòdrowning in weaponry, explosives and support equipment‚Äô. That's a quote, actually. Also whatever operation they are planning, it will involve Eclipse herself‚Ä¶ and at least one thousand soldiers.‚Äù 

Eraserhead almost spits out the coffee when he hears the number. 

‚ÄúWhat are they planning to do, storm the National Diet? Blow open the Tartarus?‚Äù He stares at the vigilante with a shock on his face. The latter is a massive over exaggeration, but the former could work. Depends on the timing, really - if the attack happens when Endeavor and All Might aren‚Äôt there, the QLF will probably succeed. 

Of course, they can‚Äôt hope to hold the Diet. Nor to escape. So it would be just a collective murder-suicide. 

‚ÄúNo idea. But they are fielding fifty combat cells‚Ä¶ and an unknown number of ‚Äòdemolition‚Äô and ‚Äòheavy weapons‚Äô cells, but we have no idea what those are.‚Äù Crawler replies. ‚ÄúApparently the Tokyo bombing campaign was carried out by five combat cells. So‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs going to be pretty bad.‚Äù

Understatement of the century. Eraserhead is already getting a headache. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll mention that to Nedzu.‚Äù If there is a single person in Japan capable of somehow counteracting such an operation without making Eclipse realize that someone sold her, it is the rat. ‚ÄúAnything else?‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you ever heard of the villain group known as Shie Hasseikai?‚Äù Crawler asks. Eraserhead shook his head. Contrary to popular opinion, he doesn‚Äôt know every organization in Japan. His area of operations is centered around Musutafu. 

‚ÄúOur friend Akatani appears to know something about it.‚Äù Crawler continues. ‚ÄúApparently, and I quote, ‚Äòthey are or were to Trigger what UA is to heroics‚Äô. They or their remnants also went to bed with QLF, as the combat cell of the informant guarded a warehouse full of what we suspect to be Trigger.‚Äù 

Now that is interesting. 

There was a steady raise in Trigger usage and quality for several years. Many underground heroes tried to crack it, but somehow the group in question eluded them. If the QLF was responsible for the transport - QLF that was also almost impossible to crack from the outside - it would explain a lot of things. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to ask Nedzu about that group too.‚Äù Eraserhead replies. ‚ÄúThis might be a breakthrough that we needed when it comes to the Trigger distribution.‚Äù Crawler nods. He battled too many Trigger-addled villains to not be looking forward to it. ‚ÄúDid he tell you anything more about them?‚Äù 

‚ÄúA single name.‚Äù Crawler replies. ‚ÄúChronostasis, apparently he was in charge of the warehouse in question. Mikumo claims to have a lot of intel on Shie Hasseikai that he is willing to sell for favors. Primarily their quirks and also some ‚Äòpersonal stuff‚Äô. But he says that his knowledge is one and a half year old.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDefector from the group?‚Äù Eraserhead asks. Crawler shrugs in answer. 

‚ÄúDunno. Can‚Äôt get a read on him, really.‚Äù The vigilante replies. ‚ÄúHe gave the Alliance a lot of valuable intel three years ago, then vanished and reappeared a few days after the USJ raid. He started giving us stuff again, and asked for our help in finding the Hero Killer, oddly enough.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHero Killer?‚Äù Eraserhead is increasingly interested in Akatani Mikumo. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù 

‚ÄúAgain, no clue.‚Äù Crawler shrugs. ‚ÄúHe says that he needs to find him before the police do. Alliance would have normally told him to get lost, but he made a claim that Hero Killer was previously our member. He even gave us the name. Boss said that I can‚Äôt tell you who that was.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trying to clean it up on your end.‚Äù Eraserhead replies and Crawler nods.

‚ÄúBasically, yes.‚Äù Crawler has the decency to look ashamed. He just admitted that his organization seeks to kill someone to cover up their messes. Then again, Eraserhead works for Nedzu. He isn‚Äôt one to judge. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôve investigated the connection. Both are very talented melee fighters fighting with blades, and the vigilante‚Äôs quirk allowed him to temporarily paralyze someone by tasting their blood.‚Äù 

Crawler doesn‚Äôt add it, but it sounded extremely similar to what Hero Killer‚Äôs surviving victims claimed. They were all paralyzed by something, but nobody knows what exactly. 

‚ÄúI was actually investigating the vigilante‚Äôs old safehouse in Hosu when I ran into whom we believe to be our mysterious Akatani Mikumo.‚Äù Crawler continues. ‚ÄúWith two bodyguards, all wearing identical hoodies and face masks. Awfully polite, but could be because they had a flying drone with a camera that spotted our reinforcements waiting nearby. Somewhere around 1,7m tall, sounded about‚Ä¶ 18-20 years old? Hard to say, he wasn‚Äôt talkative. His sidekicks didn‚Äôt say a word. Also when I asked him if I can talk with you about the QLF stuff, he said that I can, because he owes you something. But didn‚Äôt specify for what.‚Äù  

‚ÄúYou think you could organize a meeting for us?‚Äù Eraserhead decides to ask. ‚ÄúPreferably me and a certain detective from the local police. Full confidentiality, no need to get unmasked, can bring his bodyguards, on neutral ground, can refuse to answer a question and so on.‚Äù He is almost certain that the person in question is a villain. Probably a small time one, but you could never be sure. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to talk about Shie Hasseikai.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI can ask.‚Äù Koichi replies. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not going to try to pressure him into it. He and whatever group he represents sound pretty serious.‚Äù

 

***

 

‚ÄúDammit, I hoped the thorn girl would win!‚Äù Himiko shouts in defeat. ‚ÄúStupid mini-Ingenium!‚Äù 

‚ÄúHey, the Endeavour‚Äôs kid was pretty awesome.‚Äù Mustard replies with an irritated expression on his face. ‚ÄúHe deserved to win!‚Äù

‚ÄúSettle this like men.‚Äù Tenko replies from the background. 

‚ÄúBy murder?‚Äù Himiko asks and Izuku shivers a bit. 

‚ÄúPillow fight.‚Äù Mindscrew pitches his idea. 

Izuku growls menacingly when the pillow fight starts and asks Kurogiri to warp him back home so that he can note down everything he noticed about the quirks used in the festival.

Sawa Takeo: Talked with Eraserhead. 

Sawa Takeo: He wants to meet you. Would like to bring a friend with him. 

Akatani Mikumo: Is it the moment when I agree only to discover that the friend is All Might or Nedzu that didn‚Äôt drink a single cup of tea in a week

Sawa Takeo: lol no

Sawa Takeo: some detective

Sawa Takeo: Apparently they never heard about the Shie Hasseikai and want to change that

Sawa Takeo: Trigger cases on the raise, heroes and police stumped and all that

Sawa Takeo: Neutral ground, you can bring your bodyguards, no one will ever know, you can stay behind your mask. 

Sawa Takeo: I already organized like three similar meetings with Eraserhead, I can vouch it‚Äôs no trap, just desperation

Akatani Mikumo: Conditional yes

Sawa Takeo: Define conditional

Akatani Mikumo: I want autographs of all heroes working as UA staff members, preferably on something small (posters or some other merch). Eraserhead and Vlad King can just sign me a piece of paper, they are underground so no merch

Sawa Takeo: is this an elaborate joke I‚Äôm too vigilant(e) to understand

Akatani Mikumo: no I‚Äôm serious

Sawa Takeo: I‚Äôll see what I can do

 

***

 

Izuku isn‚Äôt sure who was more surprised by the news. 

‚ÄúWe what?‚Äù Mindscrew asks him. Himiko is just staring at him in shock. 

‚ÄúWe are going to meet with Eraserhead and some police detective, because I want signatures of several heroes.‚Äù Izuku replies with a straight face. ‚ÄúAlso this will be a good lesson to you, Toshi, about‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs say, lines you shouldn‚Äôt cross even as a villain. I promise this will make sense after the meeting.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIf I didn‚Äôt see the recording of you vaporizing the Number Three Hero I‚Äôd seriously think you are leading us into a trap.‚Äù Mindscrew sighs. 

It‚Äôs nice to be loved.

 

***

 

The meeting location is in an abandoned warehouse. Izuku has the entire area surrounding it double checked for possible traps, and then has Gremlin deploy not one but two of her drones (now with nightvision, infrared and some other things he doesn‚Äôt understand) as surveillance. He also organized a table and a few chairs and kept Kurogiri on the standby. 

It is close to midnight. He goes in flanked by Himiko and Toshi, all three wearing their infiltration hoodies and face-concealing masks. Himiko also has her knives and Mindscrew has something resembling an assault rifle. 

Something that was made by Gremlin. Izuku has no idea what sort of thing it is using as ammunition, but it is certainly no normal bullets. Although that is probably one of many options. Figuring Mei‚Äôs line of thought is something that he has long given up on.

The guests arrive soon after midnight. Eraserhead, the guy in a hoodie that Izuku suspects to be his Alliance contact (is it someone important, maybe Crawler himself?), and some plain looking guy that is probably the detective. 

Time to start the game.

 

***

 

Eraserhead has no idea why, but somehow Sir Nighteye, All Might‚Äôs former sidekick, has caught wind of the meeting. He suspected Nedzu to be responsible. Nighteye apparently heard about Shie Hasseikai, and was leading an investigation into them for years, but without an actual breakthrough. For as far as he knew, they were just a minor criminal group, albeit one quite good in covering their tracks.

Eraserhead refused to include another person in the meeting. Sir Nighteye would be present only as an observer through a camera and an internet connection (with an option to speak to Eraserhead through an earphone if needed). Hopefully he wouldn‚Äôt have to.

Eraserhead isn‚Äôt sure what he was expecting. The meeting place is rather standard (although most villains preferred to meet in public places - the threat of heroes actually lowered the chance of people coming to blows - but here one side IS heroes). Crawler doesn't make any ‚Äòoh you brought someone new‚Äô comment, so the two bodyguards (one with knives and one with‚Ä¶ wait is that a gun?) are either the same people as those following the informant in Hosu or have very similar body build. 

Akatani Mikumo is sitting in a chair on one side of the table. There are two chairs on the opposite side and one beside it (probably for Crawler who was the middle-man). Bodyguards stand behind the man himself. 

Crawler hands the bag of merch (seriously what sort of villain gets paid in hero merch) to Mikumo, who briefly checks it before handing it to one of the bodyguards. 

‚ÄúGreat.‚Äù He said. Eraserhead‚Äôs estimation of his age based on the voice aligns with Crawler‚Äôs. ‚ÄúSo what do you wish to know?‚Äù 

‚ÄúShie Hasseikai.‚Äù Eraserhead says. They have a plan. Naomasa has a small item (courtesy of Power Loader) in his pocket. Pretty much a button that, if pressed, will make another item (on Eraserhead‚Äôs finger) jolt him slightly. Something to signify that the detective noticed a lie, but without warning their informant about his lie detecting ability. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go chronologically. When did you become aware of them?‚Äù 

‚ÄúAbout three years ago.‚Äù Mikumo replies. ‚ÄúI was told by someone to investigate them. Can‚Äôt say why or by whom exactly, but I did so for more than a year. I even joined them for a while.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd what were they exactly?‚Äù Eraserhead asks. 

‚ÄúA remnant clan of Yakuza.‚Äù Mikumo replies. ‚ÄúThey were quite proud of that, trying to uphold the old traditions. Disliked villains, and didn‚Äôt consider themselves to be a part of them. So no villain names and so on. They had something like one to two hundred members and were pretty much local thugs until the new leadership took over.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNew leadership?‚Äù That sounds like a route to follow. 

‚ÄúAn adopted son of their leader overthrew his father.‚Äù Mikumo replies. ‚ÄúKai Chisaki. Took up the villain name of Overhaul and decided to make some major changes. He had both a very powerful quirk and a strange ideology according to which quirks as a whole were a disease upon Mankind and had to be eradicated. I think he thought that if he destroys them, he will get rid of heroes and villains and thus the yakuza will be able to be restored to its former glory.‚Äù Trying to turn the clock back at its earnest. Quite ambitious, Eraserhead has to admit. Especially for such a small group. Then again‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs always the small groups, isn't it?

‚ÄúI think I can see why he gets along with QLF.‚Äù Naomasa comments. 

‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt. I killed him.‚Äù Mikumo replies, surprising them both (and probably Nighteye too). ‚ÄúWhich, all things considered, was pretty heroic. I‚Äôm going to be honest with you - in a few more years he would be a menace worse than Eclipse or Re-Destro. He decided to wage war against quirks as a concept, and was on the best way to win it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBold statement.‚Äù Eraserhead comments calmly. ‚ÄúEspecially in front of a hero.‚Äù He isn‚Äôt going to make an arrest. First of all, they have to gain more intel. Second of all, Japan has enough problems as it is to be worried about the death of some unknown villain. Eraserhead has priorities.

Mikumo only shrugs in answer. 

‚ÄúWin it?‚Äù Naomasa seems to be in agreement with Eraserhead. They will eventually try to apprehend Akatani Mikumo‚Ä¶ if they get evidence for him killing Overhaul. And if they run out of uses for him.

‚ÄúListen‚Ä¶‚Äù Mikumo says. ‚Äú... I hate Overhaul. Like, I really do. If I was locked in a room with him, Eclipse, Re-Destro and a gun with two bullets, I would shoot Overhaul twice. But I have to admit one thing. That man was a genius. Amoral sociopath, but a genius. When it comes to quirk genetics and quirk-oriented biology, he was pretty much a David Shield-level of genius, if not more than that. His life‚Äôs dream was creating a drug capable of rendering someone permanently quirkless. He created and began mass production of a drug that could damage one‚Äôs quirk factor enough to render them unable to use non-mutant quirks for several days and designed a bullet-syringe capable of administering it from a distance.‚Äù 

Eraserhead is shocked (but disciplined enough to not show it). Someone created a drug that pretty much made his own quirk, Erasure, utterly obsolete. He doesn‚Äôt even want to imagine what would happen if villains could simply shoot heroes into helplessness. Although perhaps it would make his students be slightly more interested in quirkless combat abilities.

Overreliance on your quirk is a slow and insidious killer. 

Part of him still hopes that Naomasa‚Äôs button broke and the detective is actually smashing it semi-constantly. 

‚ÄúAnd that was merely his main work.‚Äù Mikumo continues. ‚ÄúHe worked on all manners of quirk-related drugs. If you noticed a sudden improvement in Trigger quality something like two years ago, that was Overhaul‚Äôs handiwork.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWe did.‚Äù Naomasa notes grimly. Eraserhead remembers the mess that followed. As far as he knew, nobody figured out where the drugs were coming from. ‚ÄúYou mentioned that he had a powerful quirk, can you elaborate?‚Äù 

‚ÄúHe named his quirk after his villain name. Or the way around.‚Äù  Mikumo replies. ‚ÄúThis quirk allowed him to reassemble biological matter according to his whim on touch. When I was part of the Shie Hasseikai, I heard a gossip that he once turned a man inside-out for his failure, and in a way that made him remain alive for several hours afterwards. I also know that if cornered he could merge with other people, making himself bigger and uglier but also allowing him to use the quirks of whoever he merged with.‚Äù Eraserhead notices Naomasa flinching slightly at the mention. ‚ÄúHe could also alter his own flesh for as long as his brain and hands remained part of his body, although he seemed limited to ‚Äòresetting‚Äô his body to the state before an injury.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ certainly does sound like an Eclipse-level threat.‚Äù Naomasa admits, and Eraserhead agrees with him wholeheartedly. Kill-on-touch, self-healing AND quirk fusion? Class-Five quirk, no doubt about it. Something the government missed completely. ‚ÄúHow close do you think he was to creating the permanent quirk-erasing drug?‚Äù 

‚ÄúHe actually created and tested a working prototype plus an antidote for it.‚Äù Eraserhead forgets how breathing works for a few seconds after that statement. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt have the time nor the means to mass-produce either, however. But I know for the fact that he created at least three quirk-erasing bullets, and tested two, destroying the victims‚Äô ability to use non-complex mutant quirks. Permanently. But he restored one with an antidote.‚Äù

It is something that could quite literally overthrow the society itself - and not only in Japan - if it was mass-produced. It would return the world to the chaos of the early quirk era, only this time the quirkless would have a long list of valid reasons to discriminate against the quirked (at least for as long as revenge counted as one). 

There were many groups in history that dreamt of turning the clock back to restore an area that was long gone. If Mikumo wasn‚Äôt brainwashed into telling them a made-up tale, Shie Hasseikai was on the verge of actually achieving that.

‚ÄúDo you think that Shie Hasseikai could have somehow replicated that drug without Overhaul?‚Äù Naomasa asks. 

‚ÄúOverhaul himself wasn‚Äôt needed for the process.‚Äù Mikumo replies. ‚ÄúI made sure that his lab was destroyed, but there is a high chance that he wrote down the formula for it elsewhere. But I did make sure that a crucial component for the quirk erasing and quirk suppressing drugs was gone from their hands, and I don‚Äôt think that they could replace it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat was that component?‚Äù Eraserhead asks. He knows that irreplaceable things like to turn out to be replaceable at the worst possible time. 

‚ÄúOverhaul‚Äôs mad genius made him produce quirk-related drugs from the blood of quirked individuals with appropriate quirks.‚Äù Mikumo says. Eraserhead already knows that the full answer is going to be a headache. And something truly horrible. ‚ÄúThe source of both drugs was the biological granddaughter of the former Shie Hasseikai boss. Since Overhaul required a lot of her blood for his research, he bled her dry dozens of times and then repaired her from the brink of death or from beyond it with his quirk. She was five years old when I killed him.‚Äù 

Eraserhead suddenly decides that he regrets the fact that Mikumo killed Overhaul. This spared him the occasion to do that himself. 

Naomasa looks like he is about to vomit. Eraserhead fully understands that. 

Nighteye somehow maintains his strict silence (he wouldn‚Äôt interrupt Eraserhead unless it was absolutely crucial, such was the deal between them). But if Eraserhead knows anything about him, he is probably searching the internet for a quirk that can resurrect a dead person simply to have Overhaul suffer some more. He looks like a creepy murderer sometimes, but he has a heart in the right place. 

There are many horrible things happening to people all around the world. This is probably one of the worst that Eraserhead ever heard about. And if that isn‚Äôt enough, nobody knew about Overhaul‚Äôs entire operation. If not for Mikumo, this could continue for years.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to ask about it, but‚Ä¶ where is she now?‚Äù Naomasa says quietly. 

‚ÄúRight now? In her room in my house, in her bed with her favourite All Might plushie.‚Äù Mikumo replies. ‚ÄúFinally having a normal childhood. She is not involved in the QLF operation in any way. But I certainly missed at least a single quirk erasing and some quirk suppressing bullets during the assault on the Shie Hasseikai‚Äôs headquarters, so it is possible that the QLF is having the remnants of Overhaul‚Äôs group work on replicating those drugs. Either that or they are smuggling more standard drugs together to finance the QLF‚Äôs operations, their ideology appears to be compatible enough.‚Äù 

He pulls a stack of papers from under the table and pushes it towards Eraserhead and the detective. 

‚ÄúThose are the notes that I made on Shie Hasseikai‚Äôs operations while I was preparing the assault on their main compound.‚Äù Mikumo adds. ‚ÄúYou have pictures and profiles of their leaders, including Overhaul himself. Location of their old headquarters and Overhaul‚Äôs main laboratory. Notes on their drug trade. It‚Äôs all at least one and a half years old, but it should give you a general idea on what to look for. I took the liberty of censoring the bits that could point you to me or my associates. But it shouldn‚Äôt be a lot.‚Äù 

Eraserhead quickly skims through a few pages. He was impressed. Names, pictures or drawings (of members in and out of their villain costumes), detailed quirk analysis, notes on why they joined the group and on what sort of people they were. 

Plus, of course, detailed description of their base and all the other things Mikumo mentioned. There were moments where he seemed to ramble uncontrollably, but it was obvious that those parts left for speculation. Confirmed facts were written down in a clear and concise form.

Then Mikumo puts something else on the table. 

‚ÄúThis is the hard drive I took from Overhaul‚Äôs computer.‚Äù He continues. ‚ÄúThe one in his lab. He wasn‚Äôt known for being particularly‚Ä¶ coherent in his work, but if you give it to someone knowledgeable enough, it should at the very least serve as a proof that what I said about Overhaul‚Äôs research aren‚Äôt lies. I suggest someone from the I-Island. You work with All Might, so that should be easy to achieve.‚Äù 

Eraserhead dislikes the idea of asking All Might for something, but if Overhaul‚Äôs research is as revolutionary as Mikumo is suggesting, David Shield is probably their best bet when it comes to figuring it out. 

‚ÄúSo, unless you are planning to arrest me after all, I believe it‚Äôs time to bid you goodbye.‚Äù Mikumo announces suddenly, interrupting Eraserhead‚Äôs inner deliberations. ‚ÄúThe Vigilante Alliance knows how to contact me, if you‚Äôll need something from me.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll stick to our side of the deal.‚Äù Eraserhead speaks. He has no idea who Akatani Mikumo truly is, but it is quite obvious that he is an interesting and potentially useful person. Trying to arrest him now - without even knowing his quirk or how dangerous he could be - will just ruin a profitable relationship. 

There is also the part where he killed Overhaul. A de facto SSS-Rank villain in the making. Eraserhead isn‚Äôt going to try fighting him without knowing what to expect.

Chapter Text

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù Mindscrew decides to speak when they leave the abandoned warehouse. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be honest. I thought that my foster parents were the epitome of unrepentant evil, but that Overhaul guy has just made them look like saints in comparison.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHe has a tendency to do that to people.‚Äù Izuku replies calmly. ‚ÄúWhich is why I decided to take you with me. Himiko already knew about him, and‚Ä¶ well, we‚Äôre going to be doing a lot more villainous things in the future and I prefer to use such occasions to teach League members how to behave when I‚Äôm not around.‚Äù 

He still has no idea how to explain the concept of ‚Äòlines we do not cross‚Äô to Tenko and Gremlin. Tenko is a borderline murderous psychopath - although he has a ‚ÄòI‚Äôm brawn you are brain‚Äô deal with Izuku, the supervillain isn‚Äôt planning to give his best friend a chance to operate independently anytime soon. And Hatsume Mei‚Ä¶ is Hatsume Mei. 

She was kinda unhinged before the event that drove her to villainy, and now‚Ä¶ if anything, she appeared to be strangely stable since the USJ attack. Izuku doesn‚Äôt like that. It‚Äôs unnatural and she is probably hiding something.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt tell me about the ‚Äòrepeatedly bled dry and stitched together‚Äô part.‚Äù Himiko comments. She is furious, but hopefully not at him. 

‚ÄúYou were meeting my parents and we were having something close to a first date.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúWhat was I supposed to say? Describe in detail how Overhaul violated my adopted sister for more than a year? Way to set up a romantic mood.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou have a point.‚Äù He can hear her clicking her tongue in irritation. She is in a bad mood - during which she is way less expressive, speaks in a more concise way‚Ä¶ and could get really scary. ‚ÄúI really wish I could stab him a few times and leave him to bleed out slowly.‚Äù 

If Izuku read her mood correctly, this is no exaggeration. She is a bit of a psychopath when angry. 

‚ÄúSo yeah, in short‚Ä¶‚Äù Izuku decides to comment. ‚Äú...I hate the current society. I want to end the current society, because at this point it‚Äôs too messed up to repair it, so the best option is controlled demolition and then rebuilding it from the ground up.‚Äù 

The ‚Äòcontrolled‚Äô part is why Izuku panicked when he almost killed All Might - if he died during the USJ attack, Japan would have died with him. They weren‚Äôt ready for it. Nobody was ready for it, to be honest. 

‚ÄúAnd I can‚Äôt wait to see myself laugh on the throne made of bones of the Hero Public Safety Commission members in the burned out shell of their former headquarters.‚Äù He continues, with only a bit of melodramatic exaggeration. ‚ÄúBut, yeah. There is stuff we‚Äôre not going to do, even if it would help us achieve that goal. And I‚Äôm going to be very, very angry if someone does them behind my back.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAwesome!‚Äù Himiko is back to her slightly normal self. Probably. ‚ÄúSo if you end up becoming the postapocalyptic warlord at the ruins of modern world, can I be your sexy, stripperific and deadly consort?‚Äù Mindscrew chuckles in the background. 

‚ÄúDepends.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúAre you going to betray me in favour of some rising hero seeking to end my reign of terror after I make the mistake of sending you after him and you get hypnotized by his bulging biceps?‚Äù

They continue their banter (with Mindscrew joining in soon after) until they reach Gremlin‚Äôs position. Once she makes sure that heroes didn‚Äôt put anything dangerous (like localizer or something) in the merch, Kurogiri warps them back to the base.

Few hours later Izuku sees the news. 

Stain attacked Ingenium in Hosu. The hero was pronounced dead on arrival. 

‚ÄúWhat the hell did you do, Stain?‚Äù He whispers to himself. 

It isn‚Äôt like him. Ingenium was a good hero, but not skilled in combat enough to force Stain to use lethal means in self-defense. Stain could have just paralyzed him for a moment and disappeared. 

What could have happened in that alleyway? 

 

***

 

Five days after the meeting with their mysterious informant, Eraserhead is cordially invited to Nedzu‚Äôs office. The subject of the day: Overhaul. 

He arrives last. Detective Tsukauchi, Nedzu, Sir Nighteye and All Might (oddly enough) in still skeletal form are there already. David Shield is also present, but as a face on the computer screen. 

Eraserhead earns a surprise look from the genius inventor when All Might was introduced as All Might. The All Oaf probably forgot to mention to his friend that Aizawa is within the group aware of his injury. Though everyone was suspiciously dodge‚Äôy on whoever caused it.

‚ÄúEveryone is present.‚Äù All Might announces. ‚ÄúI believe that we can start, David.‚Äù 

The famous inventor nods. He has bags under his eyes, and looks seriously overworked. Eraserhead finds it nice to not be the only sleep deprived person in the meeting. 

‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù David Shield replies. ‚ÄúSo I got the hard drive and I managed to analyze most of its contents with the help of my friend‚Ä¶ I believe you know him as a pro hero, High Mind?‚Äù Eraserhead doesn‚Äôt recognize the name. He isn‚Äôt alone. ‚ÄúWell, he is from Europe, so perhaps it's understandable. He became the I-Island leading expert on quirk inheritance and genetics after his retirement.‚Äù The inventor takes a deep breath. ‚ÄúWe both have one question: where the hell did you find this?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Sir Nighteye is obviously stumped. 

‚ÄúWho is the author of the files on that hard drive?‚Äù David asks again. ‚ÄúBecause he deserves at least two separate Nobel prizes AND several consecutive life sentences.‚Äù 

Oh dear, thinks Eraserhead. 

Whether Overhaul‚Äôs supposed research was genuine was an object of controversy among those involved in the investigation. Eraserhead and Tsukauchi suspected that there could be something in it. All Might and Sir Nighteye were skeptics. Nedzu was unreadable. 

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ the data is genuine?‚Äù All Might asks carefully. 

‚ÄúGenuine? Genuine?!‚Äù David appears outraged by the word. ‚ÄúYagi, me and High Mind haven‚Äôt slept for four days straight! And in the end we only slept last night because Melissa slipped sleeping pills into our drinks. Where did you find this?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI think I can answer that question.‚Äù Eraserhead decides to come forward. David‚Äôs eyes focus on him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an underground hero. I was following a lead about a criminal organization responsible for Trigger production and distribution in Japan, and ended up meeting an anonymous informant. He claimed that he stole the hard drive from the laboratory of the head of said organization, previously unknown villain known as Overhaul. He also claimed to have killed said villain earlier. Both claims were verified as truth by detective Tsukauchi‚Äôs lie detection quirk.‚Äù

‚ÄùOverhaul‚Ä¶ I see.‚Äù David says before making a loud sigh. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs regrettable that a mind such as his didn‚Äôt lead him to the I-Island. But considering the things he did for his research, it was probably for the best. So I assume that you want to know what exactly I found on the hard drive?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat would be best, Mr. Shield.‚Äù Nedzu is unfailingly polite. Even when visibly impatient and tea-starved.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear to me that Overhaul seeked to create a drug capable of rendering someone permanently quirkless.‚Äù David says, confirming Mikumo‚Äôs tale with his first sentence. ‚ÄúThat alone would be pretty revolutionary, there are millions of people out there suffering from quirks that are simply debilitating or way too dangerous to them. But the most important part is the fact that to achieve this goal he practically rewrote our entire knowledge of the biological side of quirks.‚Äù 

He pauses for a while, as if trying to organize his thoughts. He is‚Ä¶ excited, that much is obvious. Eraserhead never met him, but he is quite obviously an example of a naive scientist - the quirk erasing drug would be used to deal with such cases‚Ä¶ but if Eraserhead‚Äôs knowledge of the world is in any way correct, it would be merely an afterthought of much worse applications. 

‚ÄúOkay, so I‚Äôll try to quickly summarize what he did, without the jargon.‚Äù David says before pausing for a second. ‚ÄúWe always knew that quirks are based on a mix of biology and, to say in the simplest terms, a manipulation of some form of energy. Things such as quirk suppressing cuffs and many support items are based primarily on distorting, suppressing or altering such energy fields, still following me?‚Äù 

Eraserhead feels slightly insulted. It wasn‚Äôt that complicated. Was David used to talking to way less intelligent people? Investors, perhaps? That would explain a lot.

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs mostly because our ability to access the biological side of quirks is next to none.‚Äù David continues his lecture. ‚ÄúOur knowledge of conventional genetics reached the level when we can fix many genetic disorders through gene therapies, but when it comes to quirk genetics we are on the level of Mendelian inheritance diagrams. Things simply refuse to cooperate. We failed even when it came to locating any type of genetic markers that would separate quirkless from the quirked, which is why the quirkless diagnosis tends to be based on external characteristics such as the toe joint. This is also why there are no drugs capable of truly altering one‚Äôs quirk.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat about the Trigger?‚Äù Sir Nighteye asks for them all. 

‚ÄúIt works differently.‚Äù David shrugs. ‚ÄúBodies of the quirked individuals possess certain limiters on their own strength. For example humans use only a fraction of the full potential of their muscles, as going beyond a certain level threatens to damage them. Trigger essentially lifts such inborn limiters, which influences both their quirk strength and natural strength to a certain degree. It doesn‚Äôt amplify the quirk itself.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAre you saying that Overhaul managed to crack that barrier?‚Äù Nedzu asks. He is visibly distraught - probably due to his past as a lab rat, if Eraserhead‚Äôs suspicions are correct. 

‚ÄúYes. Yes he did.‚Äù There is silence in the room. ‚ÄúIronically enough he didn‚Äôt actually figure out any big secret. No ‚Äòunified biological quirk theory‚Äô or something like that in the files. He simply approached the issue from a completely different angle AND seemed to have used an overwhelming amount of unethical human experimentation to bruteforce the blockade.‚Äù 

Now that is‚Ä¶ something. Eraserhead feels way over his head. He comes in to get some drug dealer, and instead he gets an apparent scientific revolution. Was his class somehow involved? For some reason everything strange that happened to him recently was someone connected to them. He knew they were going to be the death of him, but he didn‚Äôt mean it literally!

‚ÄúOverhaul speculated that the ‚Äòquirk factor‚Äô of a quirked individuals can be summarized to be the maximum power level their body can handle.‚Äù David continues the lecture, oblivious to Eraserhead‚Äôs growing confusion. ‚ÄúIn other words, imagine the body to be a computer. In this comparison, the quirk factor is a hard drive while quirks are the programs installed on it. They can grow, typically through experience, but they will eventually reach their maximum strength.‚Äù

Another pause. This time to drink some water. The silence in the room is deafening. Eraserhead briefly wonders if computer programs can actually grow through experience, but then banishes the thought. David Shield is obviously too sleep-deprived to make his comparisons fully rational. 

‚ÄúOverhaul made a theory that ‚Äòquirk awakenings‚Äô, so the situations when one‚Äôs quirk spontaneously evolves into a stronger form, are a result of a quirk reaching its maximum possible power level while taking only a fraction of the individual‚Äôs quirk factor. Plus extreme stress and quirk exhaustion.‚Äù David picks up where he left and continues the lecture. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit primitive and not fully reliable, but it appears that Overhaul actually designed a certain form of blood test that can measure the estimated strength of the quirk factor AND how much of it is occupied. If we confirm it to work, there is a chance that we‚Äôll be able to estimate one‚Äôs chance of quirk awakening. And if we are able to measure those things, we could start testing various medications to see if they can influence the quirk factor or quirk strength reliably. And that‚Äôs not the most shocking thing we found.‚Äù 

Oh great, Eraserhead thinks to himself. Diet supplements for quirks will be a thing. Joy.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm a bit afraid to ask, but‚Ä¶ what is it?‚Äù All Might looks like he isn‚Äôt sure if sending the drive to David was a good idea. 

‚ÄúOverhaul managed to find a way to trick the quirk factor into accepting ‚Äòforeign data‚Äô into its unoccupied space.‚Äù David replies. ‚ÄúThis is actually the basis on which he tried to construct his quirk erasure drug. However this technology has an absolutely limitless potential outside of it, that he mostly ignored. Imagine a drug that allows you to use someone else‚Äôs emitter quirk for a limited amount of time. Or, to save the quirk factor space, only a fraction of a quirk, for example imagine a drug that grants you Endeavor‚Äôs heat resistance for a few hours. Hell, at some point down the line we might actually learn how to transplant quirks between individuals or alter the way their abilities work! With this technology, the sky's the limit!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat can you tell me about the quirk erasure drug?‚Äù Nedzu asks. Eraserhead is glad that the talk returns to the fields that are actually useful for his job. ‚ÄúThe informant in question claims that it was created, but Overhaul failed to mass-produce it before his demise.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes, that would line up with the data on the hard drive.‚Äù David nods. ‚ÄúThis is actually an example of such a quirk-based drug. The data on the drive indicates that it was created from the blood of an unnamed girl. The details of her quirk aren‚Äôt mentioned, but whatever it is, the drug ‚Äòinstalls‚Äô an inferior copy of said quirk to the victim‚Äôs quirk factor, one that activates automatically and in some way unmakes itself AND the quirk factor as a whole. It might be some highly specialized annihilation quirk, but I can‚Äôt tell you that with any degree of details. This is, from the scientific point of view, absolutely and stunningly brilliant.‚Äù 

Eraserhead decides to not ruin the inventor‚Äôs good mood by mentioning that the girl in question was five years old and unwilling. Nor the bit with bleeding her dry and restoring her with a quirk. 

‚ÄúIn a hypothetical scenario in which someone uses such a drug against a hero‚Ä¶ are you capable of producing an antidote?‚Äù Nedzu asks the most important question. No one in the room wanted to imagine the result of a QLF sniper hitting All Might with such a bullet. 

‚ÄúThat, honestly, depends on many things.‚Äù David seems genuinely uncertain. ‚ÄúOverhaul‚Äôs notes are‚Ä¶ partially deranged and far from organized. If not for the fact that the biological and genetic bits make perfect sense, I‚Äôd have discounted them as a waste of time and the work of a madman. They show us the way, but we‚Äôll require a lot of work to catch up to him and work out all uncertainties. Plus, of course, there is also the fact that I‚Äôm not willing to throw ethics through the window.‚Äù David sighs loudly. ‚ÄúI estimate that if we really rush it through, we can create an antidote to the quirk-erasure drug within‚Ä¶ five to fifteen years? Depends on whether I will have access to the girl‚Äôs blood and quirk-erasure drug for testing. Two to three years if we talk about making the antidote for someone under the table instead of making it an official thing, registering drugs created under the basis of a completely new scientific paradigm is going to be a nightmare.‚Äù  

Much smaller nightmare than the fact that Chronostasis - who was apparently Overhaul‚Äôs lab assistant - was now working with the QLF. Eraserhead doesn‚Äôt even want to think of the implications. Even quirk suppressing bullets, if mass-produced, are a game-changer. Something to tilt the balance in QLF‚Äôs favour. 

‚ÄúAfter this talk is over, I‚Äôm going to give High Mind a laboratory.‚Äù David continues. ‚ÄúPlus the right to recruit twenty people of his choice, regardless of who they are and how much they cost. I‚Äôll make them sign the harshest NDA I can think of, and put them to work on the Overhaul‚Äôs notes. If you find any additional data about his research, be it notes, his assistants or literally anything else, send them to me. I cannot stress enough how important that is. I‚Äôll also make the antidotes for quirk suppressants and quirk erasure drugs a priority. But...‚Äù He says and pauses for a second, looking almost guilty. 

‚ÄúLet me guess.‚Äù Sir Nighteye takes advantage of the pause. ‚ÄúThe girl.‚Äù David nods. 

‚ÄúYes, having access to her blood would speed up the process immensely.‚Äù The scientist replies. ‚ÄúWorst of all, we don‚Äôt even know what her quirk exactly is. Without this, I‚Äôll have to spend years on trying to approach the concept differently, perhaps through some restoration quirk? Hard to say. ‚Äù 

‚ÄúThis might be hard to achieve.‚Äù This time it is the detective that speaks. ‚ÄúAccording to the informant, she was five years old when he killed Overhaul. Worst of all, she was an unwilling test subject and her treatment was‚Ä¶ nothing short of horrific. The informant appears to have adopted her and claims that she is happy now,  but I can‚Äôt imagine a six years old girl not reacting with horror to the idea of blood tests after being repeatedly bled to death and then stitched together with Overhaul‚Äôs quirk.‚Äù David‚Äôs face is getting more and more clouded as the words come. The last sentence replaces the clouds with a look of abject terror. ‚ÄúIf that wasn‚Äôt enough, the informant stays anonymous, probably due to being protective of her. If we push too much, he might decide that we want to steal her from him and then they‚Äôll disappear.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll try asking.‚Äù Eraserhead announces. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not going to force the issue in any way. He is too useful of a source and I have a feeling that he will be of even greater use in the future. If he says no, you‚Äôll have to accept that.‚Äù

UA-Spy: You there?

 

Izuku yawns loudly. What hour is it? Why is their spy even awake in this ungodly hour? Izuku was focused on having a rather awkward dream in which Eri was riding atop Hellhound and pursuing an apparently terrified (and highly unlikely) duo of All Might and All for One, and then this little‚Ä¶

 

SmallMight: This better be important or I‚Äôm ratting you out (lol) to Nedzu

SmallMight: my dream time is crucial

SmallMight: not enough sleep and I‚Äôll start looking bad

SmallMight: like insomniac

SmallMight: I‚Äôm a criminal mastermind, I need to look dashing

UA-Spy: yea yea whatever

UA-Spy: check this out

 

The spy sends him the audio recording. A rather lengthy one. He switches it on. 

‚ÄúEveryone is present.‚Äù A voice unknown to him announces. ‚ÄúI believe that we can start, David.‚Äù 

Fifteen minutes later Izuku is nothing short of outraged. By both the contents of the talk and the fact that he got to hear it. But he is ready to share only the latter with League‚Äôs most favourite (and only one) spy. 

 

SmallMight: HOW

SmallMight: Wait

SmallMight: You didn‚Äôt

UA-Spy: I did

UA-Spy: You have permanent ears in the principal‚Äôs office, in the teacher‚Äôs lounge, and in the Recovery Girl‚Äôs office. 

UA-Spy: for some reason UA makes all important talks in those three places [i can understand the first two but the third?! like why]

UA-Spy: Courtesy of me and MissExplosion

SmallMight: okay, how

UA-Spy: my quirk :P basically undetectable

SmallMight: You magnificent bastard

UA-Spy: I‚Äôll take that as a compliment

SmallMight: mention stuff like that to me first, please xD 

SmallMight: I mean, I‚Äôd never say no to an initiative this brilliant

SmallMIght: but I prefer some heads up in case we had to warp in to break you out after a mission gone wrong

UA-Spy: I probably shouldn‚Äôt ask, but‚Ä¶ she didn‚Äôt tell you?

SmallMight: YOU ASKED HER TO RELY A MESSAGE

SmallMight: ARE YOU INSANE

UA-Spy: my bad

UA-Spy: I barely know you people aside from you, kurogiri and tenko

UA-Spy: oh and himiko though we didn‚Äôt interact a lot

UA-Spy: like, I know that MissExplosion is ‚Äòcrazy‚Äô and a support engineer (helped me with the technical side of the operation), but I don‚Äôt know her personally

UA-Spy: where was the last time we hanged out together

SmallMight: two years ago I think

SmallMight: we were celebrating your birthday and Papagiri baked you a cake

SmallMight: tenko accidentally decayed his slice and was on the verge of crying (or killing someone) before you gave him your portion

UA-Spy: good times

SmallMight: I paid someone to clean your police records so you could hope to get to UA as a present

SmallMight: I also gave you a list of instructions on how to catch up on your training since you didn‚Äôt train for the few years as you thought that your dream was dead

UA-Spy: it still is, you just gave me a better one

SmallMight: big mood

UA-Spy: I‚Äôll be sending you the recordings from now on

UA-Spy: now goodnight

Izuku gets another - this time highly expected - message in the morning. 

 

Sawa Takeo: Okay so I have a message from Eraserhead

Akatani Mikumo: go on

Sawa Takeo: They confirmed the data on the hard drive as genuine and apparently super valuable

Sawa Takeo: You got David Shield to ‚Äòpractically salivate‚Äô over it

Sawa Takeo: They are still looking through the other data, but as a whole, you just got some very powerful and loyal friends, who consider themselves seriously indebted to you

Sawa Takeo: Eraserhead told me that if you want something (legal) from I-Island, they can arrange it for you, free of charge

Akatani Mikumo: great but I sense ‚Äòhowever‚Äô

Sawa Takeo: Yeah

Sawa Takeo: They are afraid that the QLF has replicated either the quirk suppressants or the quirk erasure drugs and want I-Island to work on the antidotes just in case

Sawa Takeo: seriously how the fuck did we come from ‚Äòyou can find a bunch of D-Rank villains villains in building X‚Äô to international schemes and SSS-Rank villains in like three years smh

Sawa Takeo: Eraserhead wants to (‚Äògently and politely‚Äô, he said) ask you if there is a chance to borrow your adopted ward (daughter?) for a while

Sawa Takeo: Blood tests would be invaluable 

Akatani Mikumo: He‚Äôs asking for a lot

Sawa Takeo: Yeah but it‚Äôs all fully optional

Sawa Takeo: No hard feelings when you say no, they are aware of her circumstances and your anonymity and know that this is a lot to ask for

Akatani Mikumo: I MIGHT get some blood samples from her, but that would be small blood samples and not very often

Akatani Mikumo: She mostly got over her acute fear of needles and doctors (boy what a fight that was) but I don‚Äôt want to push it too much

Sawa Takeo: fuck overhaul man

Akatani Mikumo: yeah with a chainsaw

Akatani Mikumo: my heart fucking broke when she asked me how does one smile because she wants to but doesn‚Äô‚Äôt know how to do it

Sawa Takeo: jesus christ I hope Hell exists literally because overhaul

Akatani Mikumo: yeah, same

Sawa Takeo: They also would like to know what her quirk is

Akatani Mikumo: nope

Sawa Takeo: why?

Akatani Mikumo: listen

Akatani Mikumo: I think I know why they are asking

Akatani Mikumo: trust me - there is no other quirk like hers out there

Akatani Mikumo: Chronostasis will never find her and he will never find a replacement for her

Akatani Mikumo: she already suffered enough because of her quirk

Akatani Mikumo: if I let people know about it, someone might come and try to use her for something

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôll just tell you that it‚Äôs a powerful recovery quirk

Akatani Mikumo: she‚Äôs slowly overcoming the trauma about it and might one day decide to become a healer like the Recovery Girl

Akatani Mikumo: Eraserhead is free to reserve her a place in some good hero school (ten years in advance is reasonable for UA or Shiketsu lol, those schools are crowded)

Akatani Mikumo: but we can‚Äôt help you now

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôll have that talk with her when she tells me that she actually wants to have a quirk

Sawa Takeo: speaking for myself for now, but I think that it‚Äôs highly reasonable

Sawa Takeo: I‚Äôll rely your answer to Eraserhead

 

Izuku switches off the chat. And decides to think for a while in silence.

Overhaul‚Äôs data turned out several times more valuable than Izuku thought‚Ä¶ which also means that it was a brilliant idea to not hand it to the DoctorEvil (nickname very fitting). Izuku doesn't want to imagine what that man (who was, arguably, as bad or even worse than Overhaul) could do with that stuff. 

The data is now outside of his reach. I-Island is reasonably well-protected, so perhaps it is for the best. 

All Might is running on fumes, and everything is going to burn the day he ends. It is a literal deadline for the League of Villains. Prolonging it would help a lot‚Ä¶ but Izuku was honest in what he said. She lacks control, and accidentally killing or incapacitating All Might will simply end everything ahead of schedule.

He now has a secret contact with the UA, AND has an ear in the rat‚Äôs stronghold. But he still needs to find the Hero Killer, the QLF is planning something potentially horrible, and the Hero Public Safety Commission (and, well, Nedzu and the UA) wants him and his League dead. 

At least he isn‚Äôt going to be bored. 
Notes:

    How long said informational advantage will last is the main question.

    Also, yes. Look, the Overhaul's research is a subject that's completely skimmed in canon. I decided to amend that. This fic is the result. I've thought through potential implications of what he 'achieved' with Eri's blood in canon and made this :P And trust me, there'll be more as time comes.

Chapter Text

Eraserhead finishes narrating Mikumo‚Äôs reply to Nedzu, All Might and Sir Nighteye. They are in Nedzu‚Äôs office, and‚Ä¶

...honestly, how did Eraserhead get roped into investigating something alongside All Might and the man who was the main brains provider for the Top Hero? Even working with Nedzu is a problematic thing. The rat has a‚Ä¶ reputation. 

‚ÄúRegretful.‚Äù Sir Nighteye replies. ‚ÄúDo you have any idea on who the Akatani Mikumo might really be?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is absolutely paranoid when it comes to covering his tracks.‚Äù Eraserhead replies. ‚ÄúWhich is probably understandable when you have an adopted daughter with a backstory like that. I‚Äôm surprised he didn‚Äôt just flee from Japan, there are way less dangerous places out there.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo, no leads?‚Äù Sir Nighteye decides to be pushy. 

‚ÄúAbsolutely none.‚Äù Eraserhead promptly replies. ‚ÄúAll we know is that he dealt a blow to the Shie Hasseikai and adopted a kid. Until a few days ago, we barely knew that the Shie Hasseikai existed and it‚Äôs not like he adopted her officially. Oh, and that he is a major hero fan, which isn‚Äôt really all that unique.‚Äù Eraserhead himself might have a poster or two in his room, not that he will ever admit to that publicly. ‚ÄúHow do you even start investigating someone like that?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI thought that you, as an underground hero, would know something about that.‚Äù Sir Nighteye decides to start a war. 

‚ÄúStop.‚Äù All Might intervenes before Eraserhead can retaliate. ‚ÄúThis is really no time for infighting. We have enough problems as it is.‚Äù They both agree to that without a word. 

‚ÄúAnything to add, Principal Nedzu?‚Äù Sir Nighteye decides to move out of the potentially dangerous ground. 

Nedzu is busy doing something on the computer. Not that small laptop he is often carrying around with him when he is really into some investigation, but the one on his desk. When Sir asks him, he suddenly moves his computer monitor, revealing a picture of a boy (7-8 years old?), with green hair and freckles.  

‚ÄúLet me introduce‚Ä¶‚Äù Nedzu speaks quietly. ‚Äú... Midoriya Izuku. The boy whom I believe to be our dear Akatani Mikumo. And, interestingly enough, our dear friend‚Ä¶ Legion.‚Äù All Might and Eraserhead are stunned by the very idea. Sir Nighteye is marginally less impacted. 

‚ÄúAs much as I know that we have many underage criminals‚Ä¶‚Äù Sir replies. ‚Äú... I think that an eight years old supervillain is a bit of a stretch. Although I‚Äôd love to hear the logic behind your reasoning.‚Äù There is no sarcasm in that, merely calm interest. Sir knows that Nedzu doesn‚Äôt announce a theory without evidence to prove it. 

‚ÄúOh, no no.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúThis is an old picture. Midoriya Izuku and his parents, Midoriya Inko and Midoriya Hisashi, perished in a tragic house fire about seven years ago. I‚Äôve made some serious inquiries about the event during the past few days, and I have managed to obtain a sample of Midoriya Inko‚Äôs DNA. Don‚Äôt ask how, I like to keep some secrets. Now, imagine my shock when I discovered it to be identical with the DNA of‚Ä¶ Mischief.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat thief?‚Äù All Might is shocked, in a strangely strong way. Eraserhead isn‚Äôt sure why. Did they have a history together? Wasn‚Äôt he in the US when Mischief disappeared? 

‚ÄúYes. According to their neighbours, she was paralyzed from waist down after some unspecified villain attack.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done some digging. Imagine my surprise when ‚Äòvillain attack‚Äô turned out to be a well covered-up mess up of a hero‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôd never believe which one.‚Äù

‚ÄúThunderbolt.‚Äù Eraserhead is the first one to speak. Nedzu nods. 

‚ÄúYes. He was climbing the ranks quite fast back then, and was already in the HPSC‚Äôs pocket.‚Äù Nedzu adds. ‚ÄúSo they cleaned it up. Another funny coincidence - the attack on the USJ and murder of Thunderbolt happened on the stated birthday of Midoriya Inko.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs too many coincidences.‚Äù All Might said. It was an understatement, in Eraserhead‚Äôs opinion. ‚ÄúBut how did you exactly find out about him?‚Äù 

‚ÄúBakugou Katsuki.‚Äù Nedzu replied. ‚ÄúThe 1-A student. He and Izuku were childhood friends‚Ä¶ before he started to bully him for quirklessness. We already had a talk about that.‚Äù Rat adds when he sees the look on Eraserhead‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúI do not blame him. His peers did the same, and his teachers openly encouraged such behaviour. Nobody has ever considered telling him that what he was doing was wrong. I‚Äôve corrected that mistake AND I will personally annihilate the school responsible for this mess.‚Äù The rat sighs. ‚ÄúIf I saw genuine malice in Bakugou, I‚Äôd have expelled him immediately. Instead I saw a confused young man who has genuine heroic aspirations but will require some‚Ä¶ corrections in the morals department. Besides, the last thing we want right now is a vigilante or even a villain who can secrete nitroglycerine at will.‚Äù

‚ÄúI understand.‚Äù Eraserhead replies. He knows that many of the prospective heroes are a rowdy bunch. Bakugou has the drive, powerful quirk and genuine combat instinct. He needs guidance - and that‚Äôs what the school is for. He only wishes that Nedzu told him that right away. Or that another school lived up to his duty. 

‚ÄúContinuing the subject.‚Äù Nedzu says. ‚ÄúHe was the only person other than Thunderbolt against which Legion and his‚Ä¶ friends used lethal force. Legion didn‚Äôt appear to be particularly interested in his old bully, after all Bakugou was among the students that were to be teleported elsewhere. But my theory is that when Bakugou attacked him, he reacted with more enthusiasm than he intended. He also referred to Bakugou as ‚ÄòKacchan‚Äô, which is apparently the nickname that Midoriya Izuku gave him when they were still friends.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI guess he felt no need to hide that.‚Äù Sir Nighteye comments. ‚ÄúNo need to hide things like that when you are legally dead for years and nobody knows what you look like now.‚Äù Nedzu nods. 

‚ÄúCorrect.‚Äù The rat adds. ‚ÄúSo I currently suspect that Midoriya Izuku turned out to be a late-bloomer. And, now armed in a very powerful quirk, decided to take revenge for his mother by assassinating Thunderbolt.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat do we know about him?‚Äù Sir Nighteye asks. ‚ÄúIt will be outdated news, but this might still be helpful.‚Äù

‚ÄúA few things.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúHe was, if you exclude his quirklessness, a prime hero material. Bakugou described him as a very intelligent and extremely kind child, almost to the point of habitual self-sacrifice.‚Äù Eraserhead is 99% sure that those aren‚Äôt the words that Bakugou used. ‚ÄúWhen he was seven years old, he almost died saving another child from being run over by a car. When asked why he did that, he apparently replied that he doesn‚Äôt know, his body just moved on his own.‚Äù 

Something hard to describe shows up on All Might‚Äôs face for a second. Eraserhead wonders what that was. 

‚ÄúBakugou also mentioned that Midoriya Izuku was an extremely enthusiastic amateur quirk analyst.‚Äù Nedzu continues. ‚ÄúHe started filling entire notebooks with analyses of interesting quirks he encountered practically right after learning how to write. If he continued doing that after his apparent death, that would explain the humiliating ease with which he countered quirks of Thirteen, Snipe, Thunderbolt‚Ä¶ and yours, Eraserhead.‚Äù As much as he would like to have a reply to that, he doesn‚Äôt. He was taken down way more easily than he would like to admit. ‚ÄúHe was also a great fan of All Might. To the point where his room was filled with your merch, and he apparently watched your debut video ‚Äòhundreds of times‚Äô.‚Äù 

Nobody says a thing. But Eraserhead is sure that things didn‚Äôt click in his mind only after that. The apparent ‚Äòasassination attempt‚Äô on All Might done after making sure that he wouldn‚Äôt show up after all. Legion intentionally wasting his perfect chance of actually killing the Number One Hero and vanishing immediately after Thunderbolt‚Äôs demise. Thus eliminating the Number Three Hero‚Ä¶ and giving All Might and Nedzu a plausible deniability. Despite one of Nedzu‚Äôs most dangerous enemies dying under his roof. 

It was brilliant, in a way. Even Eraserhead has to admit that. 

‚ÄúAs much as I understand the motives, I really wish my fans didn‚Äôt try to make me happier by assassinating my enemies.‚Äù All Might comments bitterly. Eraserhead agrees with him for once. ‚ÄúWhat about his connections to Mikumo?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI can think of three.‚Äù Eraserhead decides to not get humiliated with his lack of knowledge anymore. ‚ÄúFirst is that Mikumo is apparently very much into hero merch, and Legion is still a fan of that, most likely. Second is the part that infiltrating a previously unknown criminal organization and saving a little girl from its clutches sounds like very Midoriya Izuku-thing to do. Besides, his quirk feels like a perfect counter to Overhaul‚Äôs. And the third one is the part where Mikumo said that he owes me for something‚Ä¶ soon after Vampire stabbed me and Decay rammed my head into concrete at Legion‚Äôs orders.‚Äù 

‚ÄúCorrect.‚Äù Nedzu admits. He appears genuinely happy that someone other than him proves to notice the strands. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what brought my attention to the potential connection first. Then I made more connections. The fact that he reignited his contact with the Vigilante Alliance right after the USJ attack. The body builds of Mikumo and Legion are also almost identical, and we know that the latter has access to some excellent voice changing support items. I made comparisons behind Mikumo‚Äôs bodyguards and League of Villains‚Äô members and I‚Äôm almost certain that those two were Vampire and Mindscrew.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAgile close quarter combatant for defense against unexpected attacks.‚Äù Sir Nighteye comments. ‚ÄúAnd the combination between a mental paralysis quirk user and someone who can literally kill you through a touch is very deadly.‚Äù Nedzu nods.

‚ÄúYes, it was a very well-thought group.‚Äù The rat-bear says. ‚ÄúI still didn‚Äôt quite crack how Mindscrew‚Äôs ability works, but it would be enough to halt some powerful attacker in their tracks for a quick escape‚Ä¶ or for Legion to get close. As I said, Legion is an extraordinary quirk analyst, and knows how to use them for maximum efficiency.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo, are we going to try to apprehend Legion?‚Äù Sir Nighteye asks. ‚ÄúWe have the upper hand, since Mikumo reasonably trusts us and we know who he is.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt do anything.‚Äù Nedzu replies. The remaining three stare at him in silence. ‚ÄúOh, eventually the League of Villains will have to be eliminated. No doubts about it. But my desire to see it annihilated as soon as possible shrank significantly when I established with absolute certainty that the League considers itself to be our allies and doesn‚Äôt seem to be composed of utter monsters. They are no longer a dangerous wildcard messing up the already messy game. They are now an asset.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI dislike the very idea.‚Äù All Might comments quietly. Eraserhead disagrees with All Might on that. Although he wishes he could agree with the Number One Hero.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúI know. Your untainted purity and uncontested strength as a Symbol of Peace are the sole reasons why the country still exists. But we all know how ugly things are beyond the curtain. Which is why you left them to me.‚Äù The rat-bear sighs. ‚ÄúHPSC‚Äôs constant power grabs are a threat to Japan as much as the Re-Destro is. For as long as the League of Villains is going to target the puppets of the Hero Commission, I‚Äôm going to remain incapable of finding them. We‚Äôre going to continue our investigation, so that we can destroy them instantly if they step out of the line, however. And then‚Ä¶ there is Stain.‚Äù 

Eraserhead sighs. All Might is going to get pissed off by that talk. Sir Nighteye will be only barely less irritated. Hopefully no one gets punched out through the ceiling.

UA-Spy: oh shit oh fuck

 

Midoriya Izuku dislikes being woken up at an ungodly hour. This one might have been godly (he is about to head to the late-evening patrol in Hosu), but he also dislikes this type of messages. 

You immediately know that it is going to be messy. 

 

SmallMight: what is it

UA-Spy: So many shocking revelations that I don‚Äôt know where to start

UA-Spy: Nedzu knows who you are

SmallMight: I know

SmallMight: I called 1-A boomboy with an old nickname, I knew he would connect the dots and I was 90% that Nedzu would catch wind of that

UA-Spy: no

UA-Spy: more than that

UA-Spy: 1. He found that you mother was Mischief (please tell me I can announce that on the main chat if he is correct)

SmallMight: oh fuck how

UA-Spy: he didn‚Äôt tell but it included DNA test

UA-Spy: 2. He claims that some guy Akatani Mikumo (the one from the Overhaul case) is you

 

Izuku panics. There are no other words to describe his current state. This isn‚Äôt a part of the plan. That most certainly isn‚Äôt part of the plan. He knew that Nedzu was smart, but that is an overkill!

If he somehow connected Izuku with All for One‚Ä¶ the League would be super-dead. His father is the only thing that could make Nedzu and HPSC work together. And with ferocious zeal. It is extremely unlikely (Hizashi Midoriya knew how to cover his tracks), but...

 

SmallMight: oh no no no no no no how

UA-Spy: apparently hero merch, similar stature and the fact that you said you owe Eraserhead something +Akatani appearing right after USJ attack

SmallMight: this is bullshit ;_; 

UA-Spy: a bit, yeah

UA-Spy: but they all bought it

UA-Spy: also they know that Vampire and Mindscrew were with you

SmallMight: at least they didn‚Äôt notice Gremlin

UA-Spy: small mercies

UA-Spy: good news is that rat decided that you are now an asset in his proxy war with the Commission

UA-Spy: they are planning to investigate more about the League to be able to take us down if we went renegade

UA-Spy: but other than that, Nedzu is temporarily terminating his genocide crusade against us

SmallMight: So mission failed successfully? 

UA-Spy: kinda, the whole deal made All Might seriously unhappy, he doesn‚Äôt like the part when his number one fanboy is killing people for him

SmallMight: I‚Äôd stop being his fanboy if he was ok with that

UA-Spy: he stormed out of the room cursing like a sailor and threatening to punch Nedzu and Eraserhead into the stratosphere when they started talking about the Hero Killer

SmallMight: what?

UA-Spy: it might be better if you listen to it yourself

UA-Spy: I still suspect it might be a fever dream

 

So he does listen to it. It isn‚Äôt long. But it sure as hell puts his world upside down. 

 

SmallMight: what in the fuck

SmallMight: like what

SmallMight: I don‚Äôt even

SmallMight: I mean it fits considering what I know about Stain but

SmallMight: shit

SmallMight: now I need to find him even more

UA-Spy: Yes. Yes you do. 

SmallMight: I hate this country.

UA-Spy: Big mood. 

SmallMight: you can announce the Mischief part on league‚Äôs chat, I need some entertainment after this

 

***

 

UA-Spy: !!!

UA-Spy: I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT

VampirePrincess: ???

FuckSchool: what is it, mystery man

HandyMan: yeah?

UA-Spy: through my unmatched spy skills

UA-Spy: I have found out who SmallMight‚Äôs mom is

FuckSchool: TELL ME IMMEDIATELY

VampirePrincess: Did he let you talk about that? -_-‚Äô 

SmallMight: actually, yeah

SmallMight: Nedzu knows (I call bullshit) so no need to keep things hidden anymore, at least within the League

HandyMan: oh

HandyMan: you in danger?

SmallMight: no need to commit murder in my stead, Tenko xD at least not yet

SmallMight: they all think she is dead and I murdered Thunderbolt on her birthday as a revenge

SmallMight: because he put her on the wheelchair (they don‚Äôt know she recovered from that)

UA-Spy: SmallMight‚Äôs mom is ‚Ä¶

Insomniac: c‚Äômon, the suspense is killing me faster than caffeine addiction

FuckSchool: I NEED TO KNOW

UA-Spy: ‚Ä¶ Mischief. 

FuckSchool: O_o 

VampirePrincess: yay

Insomniac: ayfkm

HandyMan: who that

SmallMight: my friendship with you have ended, now @UA-Spy is my best friend

HandyMan: what about our game night, it‚Äôs tomorrow

SmallMight: what are we going to play

HandyMan: Dark Souls

SmallMight: you are still my best friend but you are on probation

FuckSchool: I urgently require more information

FuckSchool: your mother is MISCHIEF? that cat thief? 

HandyMan: she stole cats?

Insomniac: holy shit man your knowledge on villain trivia is just sad

HandyMan: I consider it a victory over SmallMight

SmallMight: @FuckSchool yes, that S-Rank thief

SmallMight: I saw drawings and recordings of her in that black cat costume jumping between buildings and honestly I can scarcely believe that‚Äôs her myself

VampirePrincess: yeah, she is kinda round now

FuckSchool: round?

SmallMight: chubby

SmallMight: very emotional (cries when happy, cries when nervous, cries when sad, and her waterworks are nothing short of inspirational), happy as a housewife, uses her small object attraction quirk to summon tissue boxes mostly

SmallMight: can still move around quietly (she sneaked upon my dad and smacked his head with a newspaper when he scared @VampirePrincess, and he isn‚Äôt easy to sneak upon) but doesn‚Äôt really do it anymore

HandyMan: sounds kinda weak

HandyMan: like a low level rogue

SmallMight: let me tell you a family secret

SmallMight: her quirk lets her ‚Äúattract‚Äô‚Äô small objects from a distance to her hand, with quite notable speed (up to 50km/h if she really puts her back into this)

HandyMan: and?

SmallMight: eyes and a number of internal organs count as small objects

HandyMan: ‚Ä¶

FuckSchool: Oh shit

Insomniac: o_o 

Insomniac: I‚Äôm going to need an additional cat to erase those mind images

CatProvider: I can help. I was severely intimidated when I found out too. 

VampirePrincess: why you didn‚Äôt tell me that when I was visiting this sounds so damn awesome :D

SmallMight: because then you would mention it and she doesn‚Äôt like that

SmallMight: she was happy doing bloodless thievery then discovered this when some thugs cornered her after her last heist

SmallMight: she retired soon after and married dad

VampirePrincess: this is still the coolest quirk application I ever heard of

SmallMight: that I can agree with

MissExplosion: Can I make a baby with her?

Insomniac: Jesus Christ

SmallMight: you guys are impossible xD

SmallMight: also: Insomniac and VampirePrincess, get ready for the patrol

SmallMight: I have a gut feeling that it‚Äôs going to be wild night

They find Stain in an alleyway, right next to the surface hero-patrolled zone of the city. He is busy monologuing to a fallen hero, whom Izuku recognizes as High Slide. The hero is on the verge of bleeding out and paralyzed by Stain‚Äôs quirk. 

‚ÄúMei.‚Äù He speaks through the speech-to-text. ‚ÄúWhat are your gremlin eyes seeing?‚Äù 

 

MissExplosion: Sniper is back

MissExplosion: moving to a position where they can see him

MissExplosion: one minute

 

They arrived right on time. 

‚ÄúStain!‚Äù Legion walks out from behind the corner and his two bodyguards. ‚ÄúWe need to talk.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù The Hero Killer rises from above his newest victim. He looks‚Ä¶ Well, like always. Tall, gaunt and maniacal. With a rather horrifying face and a lot of sharp stuff pretty much everywhere. 

‚ÄúYou will follow us. ‚Äù It isn‚Äôt Legion that spoke first. It is Mindscrew. And now, an irony among ironies, Hero Killer finds himself unable to control his body and starts walking towards the three hooded figures. 

Unlike normal reactions to Mindscrew‚Äôs quirk, that one is‚Ä¶ quirky. Brainwasher finds himself staring in shock at the person who is visibly struggling against the order. And after merely a few meters, manages to shake it off entirely. 

He didn‚Äôt even know that this was possible!

‚ÄúYOU‚Ä¶‚Äù The Hero Killer screams, but Legion is faster. 

‚ÄúKUROGIRI!!‚Äù The warp gate enveloped all four of them. 

 

 ***

 

Warping anywhere with an angry Hero Killer isn‚Äôt the best idea Izuku ever had. Stain quickly proves it to him. The warp is still in progress when Mindscrew‚Äôs jaw meets with Stain‚Äôs fist, and his lights go out. Himiko tries to draw a knife, but is too late - Hero Killer storms past her, using a short knife to lightly jab her and then immediately paralyzes her with his quirk. 

Izuku, the target of the charge, has no chance of moving fast enough to defend against Stain. To begin with, he is a sixteen years old child. Sure, his quirk is powerful, but Stain is a master of close quarter combat that defeated dozens of pro-heroes. With a quirk that requires him to draw their blood before it can do anything. Stain could as well be fighting quirkless. 

Izuku simply isn‚Äôt an opponent to him. 

He lands on his back on the floor of the bar, with Stain towering over him and with one of his blades hovering a few centimeters above Izuku‚Äôs eyes. The attack was so quick that he landed on the floor almost simultaneously with paralyzed Himiko and unconscious Hitoshi. 

‚ÄúSTOP!‚Äù Izuku shouts. Not to Stain, but to Tenko, Mustard and Kurogiri. Especially the first one is about to leap at the Hero Killer and that would have ended badly. Mostly for Izuku and Tenko. 

Stain‚Äôs eyes quickly scan the room. 

‚ÄúLeague of Villains.‚Äù He says after maybe two seconds. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the thugs that dared to attack All Might. The filth that thought they could take down the Symbol of Peace.‚Äù He was furious‚Ä¶ but in a tranquil way. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the type I despise the most.‚Äù 

Izuku is absolutely terrified. Stain has that‚Ä¶ aura. It is similar to the one that his father sometimes exuded. But All for One‚Äôs is calm and composed. It is terrifying but organized, born from an overwhelming strength chained by a will of steel. Stain is ruthless - and you can practically feel it. His aura is born from the strength of conviction and readiness to see the world burn in their name. 

Izuku is terrified‚Ä¶ but it isn‚Äôt the first time he has felt it. And he knows what to do. 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Izuku replies. Stain looks back at him. ‚ÄúAnd yet you will not kill us.‚Äù If there is one thing that Stain respects, it is bravery in the face of death. 

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù For a second a bit of the tranquil fury is replaced with an interest. ‚ÄúDespite being at my mercy, you have the strength to talk like that? There is a mind and will behind your actions‚Ä¶ however misguided they were.‚Äù Stain gives him one of those terrifying smiles he is known for. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ why do you think I‚Äôm going to spare a villain like you, Legion?‚Äù 

‚ÄúBecause if you kill me, then Eri will be sad.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúUncle Stain.‚Äù 

There are a few seconds of utter silence. League members appear to be increasingly confused with what is happening. The tranquil fury on Stain‚Äôs face is replaced slowly by shock and dawning realization. 

‚ÄúIzuku?‚Äù Stain says, the shaken tone of the voice is a clear sign that the Hero Killer could barely believe it. He takes off Izuku‚Äôs hoodie - and sees familiar, green hair. Something in his eyes steels up. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have a serious talk about the things you did, kid.‚Äù 

Stain has no idea that it is going to work both ways. 
Notes:

    Look, Izuku adopts everyone he likes into his family. It is a known phenomenon. Nothing saves you from that. Stain has already fallen for that, just didn't leave contact details when he departed to stab people to death in the alleyways.

Chapter Text

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù Izuku says, while standing up. Stain makes a step back, freeing him - while also sheathing his knife back. ‚ÄúBut before that happens, I think you should invite the members of your crew. We also need to bring Mindscrew back to his senses and patch up Vampire. So‚Ä¶ let's delay the meeting for a few minutes.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOf course you figured out that I‚Äôm not working alone.‚Äù Stain chuckles. ‚ÄúWhy am I not surprised? Did I at least manage to hide my lair, or did you find it too?‚Äù Izuku remembers Stain being greatly surprised and impressed by his information gathering skills back then. The impression, apparently, remained.

‚ÄúIf I found your quote unquote lair, uncle, I wouldn‚Äôt have to look for you on the streets.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúTell Kurogiri where it is, and go fetch them up. Just‚Ä¶ watch yourself. We actually resorted to kidnapping because you were about to be shot dead by a sniper.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù That surprises the Hero Killer. ‚ÄúLooks like I‚Äôm not the only one to have things to talk about. Very well then.‚Äù 

Hero Killer warps out together with Kurogiri. Mustard checks out Mindscrew while Izuku moves over to Himiko and pulls her back to the nearest couch. 

‚ÄúI should be surprised.‚Äù Tenko comments. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not.‚Äù Izuku isn‚Äôt sure what he is referring to.

Mindscrew wakes up about the same time when Himiko‚Äôs paralysis is lifted. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what happened?‚Äù Hitoshi jerks up on the couch. 

‚ÄúStain knocked you out cold.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúThen he paralyzed Himiko and almost nailed me to the floor. But then we had a talk. He‚Äôll return in a while with his friends to negotiate.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAlso he is apparently ‚ÄòUncle Stain‚Äô to a certain green haired menace to society.‚Äù Mustard comments. Mindscrew stares at him for a second, then looks back at Izuku with questions written on his face. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll explain soon, make yourself presentable, we‚Äôre about to get guests.‚Äù Izuku replies before turning back to Himiko who is just slowly rising from the couch. ‚ÄúHow do you feel?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt kidding when you said he is deadly up close.‚Äù Vampire chuckles weakly.‚Äù I barely saw what was happening and I was already down. What‚Äôs his quirk? You somehow never mentioned it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHe can paralyze people by tasting their blood.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúThe duration depends on blood type.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHe's deadly with knives AND drinks blood for the living?‚Äù She stares at him. ‚ÄúYou were right, I already like him.‚Äù Izuku chuckles. Himiko had a lot of issues during her childhood due to her quirk being seen as ‚Äòvillainous‚Äô over the blood drinking bit. So he foresaw her somewhat bonding with Stain over it. ‚ÄúAlso damn, he smells of blood so much‚Ä¶‚Äù Something weird shows up on her face for a second. 

‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt fall in love.‚Äù Izuku replies with a smile. ‚ÄúHe is taken. Married the concept of killing fake heroes and dedicated his life wholy to it. No place left for women.‚Äù 

Kurogiri returns. Figures emerge from the black cloud. Stain comes out first. He is followed by a young man in a leather coat with some rather horrific burn scars covering a significant part of his skin. Then comes out a lizardman in a combat vest similar to Stain‚Äôs, and a blade on his back. Finally a quite bulky looking young man in a hoodie with a red cross plastered on the front. 

‚ÄúDabi.‚Äù Stain says while pointing to the scared man. ‚ÄúSpinner.‚Äù The lizardman. ‚ÄúZealot.‚Äù The third one. 

Izuku replies in kind. Then comes the awkward silence. Both sides are eyeing each other with just a slight hint of hostility (save for Stain and Izuku).

‚ÄúNow that‚Äôs a stylish villain hideout.‚Äù Spinner breaks the silence, probably earning himself good graces in Kurogiri‚Äôs book. ‚ÄúUnlike a certain basement, eh, boss?‚Äù Stain growls something nasty, probably used to the lizardman‚Äôs complaints. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre young for a villain.‚Äù Dabi says to Izuku. Who refuses to take the implied insult face down. He is a supervillain, this dictated certain rules! 

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre ugly for a human.‚Äù He replied. Stain chuckled. Dabi does so too after a short while. 

Seeing Stain laugh in a non-menacing way succeeds in at least partially defusing the hostile atmosphere. But it is still there. Izuku isn‚Äôt surprised. League members probably feel like prey in the presence of a predator. Stain does that to people.

‚ÄúI think I like you.‚Äù Dabi adds. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt swing that way.‚Äù Izuku replies. There is a brief ‚Äòwhat I didn‚Äôt mean it like that‚Äô on Dabi‚Äôs face before the room erupts in laughter. Tensions are (mostly) gone. They can move on to business. ‚ÄúAlright people, just sit wherever. If you want something to drink, ask Kurogiri. He is probably giddy on the inside that his bar finally has proper guests.‚Äù Warper gives him a death stare. Probably. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be a long night.‚Äù 

Everyone sits around. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Stain‚Äôs crew sticks to him. 

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù Stain starts. ‚ÄúCare to explain why the number one fan of All Might tried to assassinate him?‚Äù The Hero Killer isn‚Äôt one to beat around the bush. ‚ÄúAnd kill a bunch of kids?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúI was after Thunderbolt. I mentioned killing All Might as a form of intimidation factor, which sadly backfired. And the kids weren‚Äôt in danger, but try to explain that to the media.‚Äù 

‚ÄúFair.‚Äù Stain knows what bad publicity means. No matter how many times he strikes against some serious monsters pretending to be heroes, the media publish materials making said heroes into innocent victims and him into a ruthless monster. This lost some intensity recently because he published evidence on the internet, and amassed sufficient following that journalists figured out that they were fighting a losing battle and finally admitted that Stain wasn‚Äôt killing people at random.

They still paint him as a monster. It isn‚Äôt hard to achieve, in Izuku‚Äôs opinion. Hero Killer IS a serial murderer, even if one with a code of honour that he stuck to. In a better world he would be best incarcerated. In a better world Izuku would probably help in that. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm still surprised to see the kid I knew become a supervillain.‚Äù Stain says. ‚ÄúAnd that you got a quirk. Why didn‚Äôt you become a hero with it? You had the drive and potential to become a true one.‚Äù

It is the highest compliment one could get from Stain. Even his sidekicks appear surprised by him saying that. 

‚ÄúI thought about that.‚Äù Izuku replies honestly. ‚ÄúBut in the end‚Ä¶ heroes are split between Nedzu and the Hero Commission. They are pretty much waging a secret war now, and I refuse to become a hero only to kill or backstab other heroes. I prefer to be a villain and be honest to the word, than to be a hero in times like this. But‚Ä¶ whom am I to tell you about this secret war?‚Äù He gives Stain a knowing look. 

‚ÄúSo, you found out.‚Äù Stain chuckles. ‚ÄúLooks like you only got sharper since the last time we met.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAbout the fact that the overwhelming majority of your victims were on the Hero Commission‚Äôs side, because you were working for Nedzu?‚Äù There are some gasps in the background, but Izuku ignores them. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to judge you for that. I know you, I know that Nedzu wasn‚Äôt paying you for political kills. He was simply sending you evidence for corruption, and you acted on it. But‚Ä¶ do you know that he betrayed you?‚Äù 

‚ÄúHe what?‚Äù Stain didn‚Äôt expect those words. 

‚ÄúNedzu knows that you weren‚Äôt the one to kill Ingenium.‚Äù Izuku continues calmly. ‚ÄúSomeone killed him while he was on the way to a meeting with you, with a package from the rat. With evidence for the corruption of local heroes. But he was murdered and the bag disappeared, so Nedzu decided that someone, probably the Commission, suspects you for being someone‚Äôs hired blade. If they got to you, they would uncover the whole deal, so he had Eraserhead rat you out to the Vigilante Alliance.‚Äú Izuku pauses for a second before finishing. ‚ÄúWe warped you out seconds before their sniper got into a position to take you out.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAny evidence for that?‚Äù Stain has a reasonable degree of trust in him‚Ä¶ but also in Nedzu. Who is, after all, closely connected to All Might. 

Izuku hands him out a small MP3 player and a set of earphones. There is only one file in it, the recording of the talk in Nedzu's office. 

Izuku expected Stain to crush the player on instinct when the right moment came. To his surprise, he doesn‚Äôt do that. The decision to buy it instead of using one of Mei‚Äôs babies was a wrong one. 

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù Stain‚Äôs face is cold. Deathly cold. ‚ÄúLooks like I owe you something.‚Äù 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs consider this a payback for your help with the Shie Hasseikai.‚Äù Izuku quickly replies. ‚ÄúYou got Eri out of the Overhaul‚Äôs lab. She is now my adopted sister. Life for a life.‚Äù Stain nods and relaxes a bit. He doesn‚Äôt like being in debt to others. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd prefer to talk about the future. Namely, are you and friends interested in joining the League of Villains?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNormally I‚Äôd test your mettle now.‚Äù Stain replies calmly. ‚ÄúPeople on the brink of death show their true faces. But I already know yours.‚Äù A brief silence. League members are probably highly confused about the entire talk. Then again, so are Stain‚Äôs sidekicks. ‚ÄúWhat are your goals?‚Äù 

‚ÄúControlled demolition of Japan.‚Äù Izuku replies. Calmly. It is probably the first time that he stated the end goal to so many people, yet he isn‚Äôt nervous at all. He doesn‚Äôt know why. ‚ÄúAll Might‚Ä¶ he has maybe a few years left, Uncle Stain.‚Äù Stain‚Äôs eyes widen. ‚ÄúHis very quirk is burning out. When he ends, everything breaks. We no longer have time to repair this country. Especially when the UA and the underground heroes are pulling shit like hiring you. All we can do is ensure that those who could take advantage of the chaos won‚Äôt be there when it happens.‚Äù

‚ÄúHero Commission.‚Äù Stain replies. 

‚ÄúYes, but not only that.‚Äù Izuku says. ‚ÄúMeta Liberation Army, Quirkless Liberation Front, Creature Rejection Clan‚Ä¶ I seek to weaken them so much that when the Symbol of Peace falls, the remaining heroes true to this word will have a fighting chance. Perhaps even the UA if the Commission falls and Nedzu will keep being a cynical backstabber.‚Äù He had no idea the rat went that far. He suspected assassinations to be a thing, but‚Ä¶ more than thirty-five heroes killed or maimed at his orders?

Sure, they deserved that, but‚Ä¶ the distaste remains. 

‚ÄúIf I heard such words from any other sixteen years old kid, I‚Äôd laugh at them.‚Äù Stain replies after a few seconds of silence. ‚ÄúBut you? You are someone that I can imagine succeeding. You were a thirteen years old quirkless kid when you started infiltrating the Shie Hasseikai‚Ä¶ and you managed to take down a man that was Re-Destro‚Äôs equal. Even if someone helped you in that confrontation, you were the one that planned it. And I know the strength of your conviction.‚Äù Stain pauses and gives him a weak smile. ‚ÄúBut my comrades do not. Impress them, and we‚Äôll join the League.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI think I know a perfect plan to achieve just that.‚Äù Izuku replies. He knows that Stain wouldn‚Äôt say yes to the merger simply by being inspired by Izuku‚Äôs bright smile. The Hero Killer doesn‚Äôt work like that. So he worked on a plan for a few days now. ‚ÄúYou judged, what, fifty-seven heroes in total? Which one was the highest ranked one?‚Äù 

‚ÄúMr. Brave.‚Äù Stain replies, with a hint of irritation on his face. ‚ÄúRank 31. Secretly Overhaul‚Äôs rat among local heroes. I beheaded him‚Ä¶ although you know that. You were the one who sent me after him.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Izuku answers. ‚ÄúBut he was still a hero number thirty one. I know your opinion on the hero rankings. I know they disgust you‚Ä¶ and they disgust me too. Heroism should be measured in your willingness to risk your life for others, not in how strong you are and how popular your aesthetic is. But whether we want it or not, they influence the country. People look up to the top ten heroes. A single fake among them is a greater threat to the word hero than a hundred lower ranked fakes combined. We should strike higher, Uncle Stain. Much higher. Behead the system instead of chopping off its fingers.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù Stain‚Äôs eyes are gleaming. Izuku is speaking his language‚Ä¶ and he greatly enjoys that. 

‚ÄúEndeavor.‚Äù Izuku replies. He sees Dabi‚Äôs eyes widening suddenly‚Ä¶ and wonders why that happened. Then again, those burn scars... ‚ÄúI‚Äôll help you judge the Number Two Hero‚Ä¶ in front of the entire world.‚Äù

The meeting comes to an end. Izuku invites Stain and his sidekicks to temporarily (or not) move into the League‚Äôs base, and the offer is accepted. Being able to move out of some cold and wet basement into a rather comfortable evil lair (with its own training room and a bar), had its positives. Just as the access to warp quirk and healer (namely, Izuku with his quirk, although it has a lot of limits), and a hypercompetent support engineer. 

Izuku returns home and goes to sleep. It is‚Ä¶ hard. The sheer adrenaline from the brush with death (he really thought that Stain was going to kill him for a second) makes him‚Ä¶ itchy. He is also afraid - what if something was going to happen in the base now that he isn‚Äôt there? What if the two groups came to blows? 

And then there is the part where he got so swept by his own words that he isn‚Äôt sure what to feel about it. Where did his stuttering go for a few minutes? 

He is, however, blissfully unaware of the commotion that is happening on a certain secret chat on the Villain Network that he isn‚Äôt invited to. 

 

***

 

VampirePrincess: So I‚Äôll just summarize the evening for those who weren‚Äôt there: holy shit. 

Spymaster: What did I miss this time by not being able to hang out at the headquarters

MyBabies: You mean the new guys upstairs? I wonder what babies I can make with them :3 

MyBabies: Yet to meet them tho

GasMask: I‚Ä¶

GasMask: holy shit is correct description

GameMaster: in short

GameMaster: guildmaster invited another party to join our guild

GameMaster: Hero Killer +3

Spymaster: huh

Spymaster: So what sort of person is he?

CoffeeOrDeath: Killing machine. 

CoffeeOrDeath: In like two seconds he punched my lights out, paralyzed Princess with his quirk and almost nailed the boss to the floor with a knife 

Spymaster: what

VampirePrincess: it was so fast that we literally fell on the floor in the same time

GasMask: yeah, like

GasMask: I get it that there are deadly people out there

GasMask: I mean, I saw All Might up close

GasMask: but this guy

GasMask: he is something else

GasMask: GameMaster is fucking awesome for actually trying to move to save boss

GasMask: I was just paralyzed

VampirePrincess: me too

VampirePrincess: just literally xD

CoffeeOrDeath: lol

GameMaster: I moved yeah

GameMaster: but I‚Äôm certain I would die if I attacked him

GasMask: yeah, Hero Killer‚Äôs presence was just‚Ä¶ 

CoffeeOrDeath: fuck I know, he actually managed to somehow break out of my brainwashing

CoffeeOrDeath: I didn‚Äôt even know that was possible

GasMask: he did what?!

CoffeOrDeath: I brainwashed him before warp, told him to follow us, he struggled like a guy possessed by a demon in some old films (you know, the weird moves as if struggling against themselves) and then just fucking broke out and run after us with a katana with an intent to murder us all

CoffeeOrDeath: never in my life I was this fucking terrified

CoffeeOrDeath: i can‚Äôt even find a way to joke about it

GasMask: holy shit that‚Äôs a new one

VampirePrincess: also can we talk about how our leader suddenly got ten times sexier when he started talking with Stain about ending society as we know it

VampirePrincess: it was super hot and super terrifying at once

VampirePrincess: I‚Äôm sexually confused

GasMask: i don‚Äôt know about sexier, but

GasMask: Stain was intimidating like hell

GasMask: but when boss was having the talk with him, casually mentioning his desire for ‚Äòcontrolled demolition of Japan‚Äô and annihilation of the Hero Commission and then announced that they will fucking murder Endeavor together in front of cameras

Spymaster: they will WHAT

GasMask: holy shit it was like I was watching two Stains talk together

GasMask: even Stain‚Äôs sidekicks felt it

GasMask: it‚Äôs like those two were alone in the room, no one else had the courage to even breathe loudly when they started

GameMaster: High charisma stats +bonuses from Supervillain feat and Mastermind class

GameMaster: and really good roll

GameMaster: but yeah, felt that too

VampirePrincess: he has those moments, like

VampirePrincess: he is normally adorable and kind and cute and just a sunshine in the form of human being, with just a hint of shyness to heighten the adorable part

VampirePrincess: I know he is hiding a lot from us (mostly about his past), but he is so kind that I‚Äôm not even having a problem with that because I know that he is too sweet to betray us and will tell us when it will be the right time and probably looks forward to it (plus there is always a risk that one of us gets arrested, so keeping secrets makes sense)

VampirePrincess: besides, knowing him, he is hiding things for our sake

VampirePrincess: but when he really gets into the villain mode and starts talking about it

VampirePrincess: then wow, you just get swept by it and not look back at all

GameMaster: yes

GameMaster: I can confirm

GameMaster: I just want to play games tbh

GameMaster: I‚Äôm not invested that much into his storyline, although I like spending time with him (he is a good player two)

GameMaster: but something makes me tag along on his quest and I‚Äôd probably die for him if it helped him succeed

GameMaster: I don‚Äôt understand

CoffeeOrDeath: if anything, boss > Stain

CoffeeOrDeath: I saw Stain‚Äôs eyes literally gleaming when boss went into his villain mode deep enough

CoffeeOrDeath: like, I think he would agree either way, but this wasn‚Äôt just agreement

CoffeeOrDeath: it was getting swept in, just to a lesser degree

Spymaster: Okay so @MyBabies sent me a videorecording from a security camera, with audio

Spymaster: just finished watching it

Spymaster: and I agree

Spymaster: holy shit

Spymaster: the recording doesn‚Äôt carry it over well enough, but I can barely recognize the boss

Spymaster: no nervousness, no stuttering, just smooth words and just the perfect gestures to amplify what he was saying

TiredNanny: It‚Äôs charisma. 

VampirePrincess: Wild papagiri appears!

TiredNanny: I was busy at the bar and helping four new people settle in. 

TiredNanny: Also I‚Äôm not wild. And not a papagiri. 

GasMask: Charisma?

TiredNanny: Special type of.

TiredNanny: His father has it. Stain has it. All Might has it. Re-Destro and Eclipse too. Endeavor wishes he had it.

TiredNanny: It‚Äôs something that you get from a combination of conviction to change the world, readiness to act upon it, willingness to spill blood if needed, and power. 

TiredNanny: Think about All Might. Imagine that you are random passersby attacked by a villain. Suddenly All Might appears and makes the ‚ÄòFEAR NOT, FOR I AM HERE‚Äô talk. 

TiredNanny: If anyone else spoke such words, people would have laughed at the cheesiness or remained terrified of the villain. But here, it makes them hopeful and calms them down. Because they know - instinctually or not - that he wholeheartedly means it. That he has the strength to back his statement, and that he would rather die than abandon them. 

TiredNanny: Stain is identical. That man has abandoned his prior life not once, but twice - for his ideals. He has dedicated his very existence to purging false heroes from this world. Only death or incarceration can stop him. And the latter only until he inevitably escapes.

TiredNanny: If All Might turned his back on people in need, or if Stain willingly spared a false hero, their aura would no longer be genuine - because even if no one else would know, they would. And this special quality of charisma would have vanished from them. 

TiredNanny: You were influenced by Izuku‚Äôs words, because they were honest and, however cliche it might sound, they came from his heart. 

GameMaster: tl;dr ‚Üí boss has op charisma and persuasion skills but is normally too shy and anxious to be aware of it

TiredNanny: This is an accurate statement. 

GameMaster: also he is bad at lying

TiredNanny: Which is why he prefers telling you to the face that he can‚Äôt tell you about something. Or not mention something at all. 

GameMaster: also who the hell was Overhaul??? 

GasMask: yeah I didn‚Äôt know about that but knowledge of boss‚Äô past is literally required for my continued survival. I demand answers or I stop breathing

VampirePrincess: you remember me mentioning that the boss' little sister is adorable?
GameMaster: is high charisma stat inheritable

VampirePrincess: Probably but she is adopted. Boss apparently saved her from the villain named Overhaul (whom Stain just compared to Re-Destro in terms of strength) after killing said villain

VampirePrincess: also said villain has literally bled said girl dry as a part of his sick experiments and then stitched her back together with his quirk

VampirePrincess: so he pretty much killed a five years old girl dozens of times and then resurrected her back

GasMask: What the fuck

VampirePrincess: and he did that to a granddaughter of a guy that apparently pretty much adopted him from the streets

VampirePrincess: I‚Äôm ok with stabbing people if I have to, or if the boss tells me to. Or if someone pissess me off badly enough. But this? Yeah, nope, I‚Äôm drawing a line.  

VampirePrincess: @SpyMaster you knew about this? you are oddly silent

SpyMaster: I know a lot of things (that‚Äôs my job). I overheard Nedzu, All Might and Eraserhead talking about this in the UA. 

SpyMaster: Boss sold the Overhaul‚Äôs research data to I-Island through Eraserhead (for hero merch [lol] and favors from the Vigilante Alliance and the underground heroes - anonymously). 

SpyMaster: I think he kept it mostly quiet because he wasn‚Äôt sure how you would react to his silent deals with the heroes

VampirePrincess: not very quiet

VampirePrincess: me and Coffee were there, boss kinda gave us a lecture afterwards about lines he isn‚Äôt ready to cross in order to achieve his goals (Overhaul was a good example, he literally has his figurine on his desk to serve as a reminder that goals do not justify all means)

VampirePrincess: i got a feeling that he was planning to introduce others to the concept, just one by one

SpyMaster: Part this and part the fact that he is genuinely afraid that remnants of Overhaul‚Äôs crew went to bed with QLF. 

SpyMaster: Overhaul‚Äôs endgoal was a drug capable of rendering people permanently quirkless. Our goal is‚Ä¶ well, you heard the boss today. 

SpyMaster: But the point is that if QLF shoots All Might with a syringe-bullet with such a drug tomorrow, we are kinda screwed, so he makes sure that heroes are reasonable prepared against such a situation

GameMaster: I‚Äôm getting a headache

GasMask: yeah, he is several steps ahead of everyone lol

GasMask: I should probably be irritated about the secrecy, but i‚Äôm more impressed than angry

VampirePrincess: btw. do you think that someone else was involved in the Overhaul raid? 

VampirePrincess: other than boss and Stain?

TiredNanny: I was. 

VampirePrincess: ohhh

TiredNanny: Stain infiltrated the compound and got Eri out of it, while I was providing a distraction. 

TiredNanny: Izuku has also confronted Overhaul, but I do not know what exactly happened there. 

TiredNanny: His father was involved too, but by the time he arrived, Overhaul was incapacitated. That‚Äôs all I can say. 

CoffeeOrDeath: so let me process that

CoffeeOrDeath: boss, being a 13-14 years old Q U I R K L E S S kid

CoffeeOrDeath: [no issues with quirkless btw., I‚Äôm only half a step better than them in eyes of the bigots, but this does mean no special powers and, well, body of 14 year old kid, not an expert fighter]

CoffeeOrDeath: confronted a Re-Destro level super maniacal villain

CoffeeOrDeath: and fucking won? 

GameMaster: boss was op, needed nerf, but the Administrator misunderstood and made him more op

GameMaster: feels like average mmo class that normies enjoy

VampirePrincess: also he made a battle plan that S T A I N followed

TiredNanny: He also persuaded his father to not only allow it but also follow it too, despite Izuku risking his life the most. 

VampirePrincess: I know his dad. that‚Äôs literally more epic that making STAIN follow a 13-14 years old kid‚Äô orders

VampirePrincess: when he told me to not make a mess in his home I was so terrified that I forgot how to breathe until his mom consoled me (and smacked her husband with a newspaper for almost scaring me to death)

VampirePrincess: and Izuku made him follow a plan

VampirePrincess: I‚Äôm going to marry the boss asap and have at least five children

GasMask: o_o 

VampirePrincess: he is too perfect

GameMaster: normies

CoffeeOrDeath: normies

GasMask: lol

TiredNanny: I‚Äôm waking you all up at 7am. 

GasMask: oh shit it‚Äôs 3am

VampirePrincess: but why are you going to do such a thing?

TiredNanny: Because I‚Äôm a villain?
Notes:

    Someone: So how grim is your AU
    Me: Ingenium worked with Stain
    Someone: TOO DARK TOO DARK

    Welp. And we're yet to discover who assassinated him. Then things get real dark.

Chapter 11: Preparations
Summary:

    Plots, preparations and some quality Nedzu roasting. Let's be real, the rat deserved that.

Notes:

    Guys, seriously, this isn't my only fanfic here. Check the Ties that Bind and Dead on Arrival, they are awesome too but don't get even nearly enough love >_< They are even marked as part of this series so that it's easier to get to them. Pls.

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

‚ÄúSo, they failed to eliminate him?‚Äù Nedzu asks. Eraserhead stares at him from the other end of the room, only barely hiding the hostility. It‚Äôs a miracle that the rat doesn‚Äôt notice it. 

‚ÄúStain vanished before she got into the position.‚Äù Underground hero replies. ‚ÄúHigh Slide bled out before vigilantes got to him, so we can‚Äôt even interrogate him. I went with plan B after receiving confirmation that plan A failed, and attempted to set up an emergency meeting with Stain, only to jump him with a group of underground heroes. But he didn‚Äôt reply. There is a possibility that he knows that it was a set-up and went into hiding.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it strange how often pet assassins go rogue nowadays?‚Äù Nedzu replies. Eraserhead knows whom the rat was referring to. He clicks his tongue in irritation. ‚ÄúIf only I knew why the League of Villains was looking for Stain‚Ä¶‚Äù Rat appears to be deep in his thoughts. At some point he resurfaces. And looks at Eraserhead with renewed interest. ‚ÄúWhat about‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Hero replies. This startles Nedzu. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you are planning this time, but the answer is no.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Nedzu is still surprised. This is a rare occurrence. 

‚ÄúWhat I mean is that All Might was right yesterday.‚Äù Eraserhead replies calmly. ‚ÄúI relayed your order to the Alliance only because I know that vigilantes wanted Stain dead either way, and that his survival is a threat to them. All I did was tell them where and when to find him. But now I‚Äôm done with him and I‚Äôm done with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAizawa‚Ä¶‚Äù Nedzu starts, but Eraserhead doesn't give him the time to finish.  

‚ÄúI was aware that you used Stain to eliminate corrupt heroes that were too dug-in to be eliminated through other means.‚Äù The underground hero says. ‚ÄúBut I knew of only three assassinations. What I didn‚Äôt know is that you used several more heroes as couriers. Including Ingenium.‚Äù A second of pause. Eraserhead‚Äôs face steels up. ‚ÄúThirty-seven heroes killed or maimed pretty much at your orders? What is wrong with you, Nedzu?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThirty-seven government backed villains in our midst.‚Äù Nedzu replies calmly. ‚ÄúWhat was I supposed to do? Send them letters condemning their actions? No court in this country could potentially get people like High Slide or Green Gauntlet behind bars. And you know it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúGreen Gauntlet is done for not because Stain stabbed him.‚Äù Eraserhead answers with venom dripping off his tongue. ‚ÄúHe is done for because you anonymously released a videorecording of him raping an underage intern. While telling her that he is untouchable because nobody would believe her and he has friends in high places. Everyone knows he is done for now. Even if someone in the Hero Commission decides to defend him after all, his reputation, his career and his negative influence on heroics are over. Sending a serial killer after him was redundant. And illogical.‚Äù 

‚ÄúTell that to the intern.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúShe committed suicide two years later, after Gauntlet did his best to ruin her career for trying to fight back. I‚Äôm sure her spirit will be overjoyed to know that her killer had his career ended and received a lot of nasty words on social media.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs all about vengeance?‚Äù Eraserhead is only getting more and more furious. ‚ÄúJustice might be blinder in Japan than in most of the world. But who gave you the right to be the judge, jury and executioner?‚Äù

‚ÄúHero Commission is‚Ä¶‚Äù Nedzu is about to reply, but Eraserhead doesn‚Äôt let him. 

‚ÄúStop that.‚Äù He says and Nedzu, oddly enough, stops talking. ‚ÄúI know that the president of the Commission is one of the worst villains in this country. I know what she did to you and I know that you are doing your best to not let her become an authoritarian despot. But what‚Äôs the point when you are doing that by acting like her?‚Äù Something ice-cold shows up on Nedzu‚Äôs face. It is fury, that much Eraserhead is certain about. ‚ÄúYou are supposed to be a hero. A pro-hero. If you are truly fighting against the decline of democracy, you should have come forward and shown the evidence of corruption to the public and let THEM decide on the punishment. You can‚Äôt restore public trust in heroes and justice by hiring serial killers to dispense the latter on the former.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare talk to me about becoming someone like her.‚Äù Nedzu is furious. More than he was at the Legion right after the attack. Eraserhead saw him like that only once before. But he came prepared to face the rat. And nothing is going to change it. ‚ÄúYou know nothing about what she did to me. And also‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre fired, Aizawa. Now get out of my office.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Eraserhead replies calmly. Nedzu looks at him with a combination of shock and fury. ‚ÄúNo, I'm not fired and I‚Äôm not leaving. First of all, you are a hypocrite. If sending murderers after Commission lackeys is justified because some of them did horrible things to you, then that means that QLF is morally right when it plants bombs in pre-schools because other quirked did horrible things to their members in the past. Past abuse doesn‚Äôt give you a moral carte blanche.‚Äù Nedzu opens his mouth for some fearsome retort, only to freeze. Eraserhead leans over his desk and looks down on Nedzu from up close. ‚ÄúSecond of all, if you get rid of me, you also need to get rid of All Might, Mic, Midnight, Vlad and all your contacts within the Vigilante Alliance and the underground heroes. And just so you know, Cementoss and Recovery Girl will probably follow All Might even if he doesn‚Äôt tell them the whole truth about the issue.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThis is treason.‚Äù The prospect is terrifying enough that it shakes Nedzu out of his silent fury. ‚ÄúThe Commission will win, you can‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù Aizawa is increasingly angry, but he knows that sufficient shock is the only way to make Nedzu reconsider his wrong ideas. 

‚ÄúUse your goddamn brain, Nedzu.‚Äù Eraserhead starts losing his patience. Why, for all his smarts, Nedzu is sometimes so stupid? ‚ÄúWe all gathered around the UA not because we wanted to work for you. But because UA meant something to us. We gathered around the ideals of heroism, of helping others and serving the people. So we didn‚Äôt betray anyone. But you came very damn close to betraying us all when you started using assassinations as a go-to mean of disposing of our enemies, instead of the absolute last resort. What‚Äôs the point of winning against the Commission if we turn into its copy to achieve that?‚Äù  

There is silence in the room. Nedzu appears calm, but Eraserhead‚Äôs eyes are good enough to notice the slight trembling. 

‚ÄúThink about it for a few days.‚Äù The teacher says after the silence becomes awkward. ‚ÄúThen tell me if I‚Äôm still fired.‚Äù 

He is about to leave the room when he thinks of something.

‚ÄúAlso, why the hell did you think that it was a good idea to mention all that to All Might?‚Äù That is the one thing he still couldn‚Äôt understand. 

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter anymore.‚Äù Principal replies. 

Huh.

Akatani Mikumo: We found him.

Akatani Mikumo: Are you going to honour the deal? 

Sawa Takeo: Are you going to make sure he doesn‚Äôt talk with anyone about being Stendhal? 

Akatani Mikumo: Let‚Äôs just say that I‚Äôll make sure that he doesn‚Äôt lethally inconvenience the Alliance. 

Akatani Mikumo: but I‚Äôm not going to kill him

Sawa Takeo: why did you even look for the Hero Killer

Akatani Mikumo: had a debt to settle, he helped me deal with Overhaul

Akatani Mikumo: but that‚Äôs settled now

Akatani Mikumo: also listen

Akatani Mikumo: you should recall Alliance members from Hosu for a while

Sawa Takeo: why?

Akatani Mikumo: consider this a warning, the city‚Äôs getting too hot

AkataniMikumo: too hot as in Ingenium was assassinated by someone from the Public Commission rather than Stain, and Stain was almost assassinated by someone from a completely different group [can‚Äôt tell details]

Akatani Mikumo: I also got to Stain right before Legion did [so the League‚Äôs in the city too]

Akatani Mikumo: Hosu‚Äôs getting hot and you‚Äôll do best to not be there if things get even hotter

Sawa Takeo: shit

Akatani Mikumo: yeah it‚Äôs grade A political clusterfuck and if you get too involved, Commission might target you even if it won‚Äôt connect you with Stain

Sawa Takeo: I‚Äôll relay the warning, but can‚Äôt promise anything

Akatani Mikumo: alright

He is about to enter the Juzo News building when his phone rings. 

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù He decides to pick it up. It could be something interesting, even if he doesn‚Äôt recognize the number. 

‚ÄúTokuda Taneo?‚Äù The voice feels slightly odd. Some voice alteration app? It can be more interesting than he thought. Especially as this particular number is private. How did the mysterious caller find it?

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. Who is it?‚Äù Hopefully his articles didn‚Äôt infuriate someone enough to start threatening him on the phone. That would ruin his day. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs irrelevant.‚Äù The voice replies ‚ÄúWhat is relevant is that I have an offer to you. If you tail Endeavor this Friday, you might be able to obtain an interesting material. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs the type of material that makes certain powerful people very antsy. As a result, it might be best to have it aired live‚Ä¶ I believe a journalist as popular as you will find someone willing to expose the corruption to the public?‚Äù 

Endeavor? Corruption? Something is going to happen in three days? This does sound interesting. Very much, in fact.

‚ÄúIt might be a bit hard to achieve.‚Äù The journalist replies honestly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I could find a handful of TV stations ready to risk their heads for such a scoop, but they won‚Äôt just randomly air such a material. Not without confirming it first. And if it‚Äôs something as volatile as you claim it to be, certain groups‚Ä¶ or, perhaps, the Hero Commission, might sweep in first.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDo not worry about that.‚Äù The mysterious caller replies. ‚ÄúThe eyes of Japan will be on Hosu that day. All that‚Äôs left is to switch the cameras to another part of the city when it happens. Should be much easier to achieve, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù The journalist smiles faintly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs much more possible.‚Äù

Satan 2: I need all noumus ready for combat this Friday.

Satan 2: Not going to ruin the surprise.

DoctorEvil: Sensei would be proud. 

DoctorEvil: I have nine second gens operational, including one Near High-End. 

Satan 2: Marvelous. Kurogiri will pick them up from the usual spot on Thursday. 10pm works?

DoctorEvil: Yes. I will have them all prepared. 

 

Izuku still didn‚Äôt figure out how to explain to the Doctor that he is All for One‚Äôs son rather than chosen successor. It was going to be an awkward talk, considering how that man pretty much worshipped his father. 

He also thought that said father was dead. Even more awkward.

Sawa Takeo: Too many underground heroes and other weirdos around. And I was almost spotted by Hawks of all people [but I heard he pulled out today]

Sawa Takeo: But the point is that Alliance is pulling out from Hosu for the next two to three weeks, until the situation calms down.

***

 

Aizawa Shouta has a relatively pleasant day. The students aren‚Äôt that much of a bother, nobody makes him question his own sanity, and even Present Mic is less of an irritant than normally. The last bit is especially rare.

Then, when he is about to leave the school grounds, he suddenly feels his telephone ring. 

Unknown number.

It can‚Äôt be good. He can only hope that someone accidentally pushed the wrong buttons, and‚Ä¶

‚ÄúEraserhead?‚Äù The unknown voice in the phone immediately dispels the underground hero‚Äôs hopes. 

‚ÄúYes. Who is it?‚Äù 

‚ÄúDo I need to say it?‚Äù The voice is completely different this time. 

‚ÄúLegion.‚Äù How did he get his phone number? Sure, it is the phone that he uses for school business, so technically it isn‚Äôt that much of a secret, but‚Ä¶ did he get it from one of the students? Or was it one more leftover from the pre-USJ hack? 

‚ÄúIndeed.‚Äù Legion makes a small chuckle. ‚ÄúI heard a lot of good things about you from our mutual friend‚Ä¶ Stain.‚Äù 

Oh, shit.  

League getting in contact with Stain is one of the worst case scenarios that Eraserhead can imagine. He knows that Akatani Mikumo (so, Legion) was after the Hero Killer, but until now, they didn‚Äôt know why. Or whether he succeeded. They all hoped that the Hero Killer vanished after being betrayed by Nedzu. 

This meant that Legion is now aware of the fact that Nedzu was using Stain as his personal assassin‚Ä¶ and knowing Midoriya Izuku‚Äôs outlook on heroism‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúDo not worry, Eraserhead.‚Äù Legion interrupts his musings. ‚ÄúStain is pissed off, but he knows that sinking Nedzu would sink UA. And sinking the UA would damage All Might. And I‚Äôve spent enough time in the underworld to know that underground heroes like you sometimes need to get their hands dirty. Though I suspect that Nedzu didn‚Äôt tell you how many people he had Stain kill or maim for him, hmm?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ might be correct.‚Äù Eraserhead replies as neutrally and calmly as he can. ‚ÄúBut what do you want? You aren‚Äôt phoning me just to talk about the past.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúI need a favour. In exchange, Stain and the rest of the League of Villains will mysteriously forget about the entire ‚Äòhired killer‚Äô part. Forever. Nothing illegal, before you ask.‚Äù 

Stain and the rest of the League? Eraserhead eyes widen in shock. The Hero Killer actually joined an organization? Nedzu and the rest of the UA saw him as a disposable lone wolf that bowed to no one. How did Legion - a sixteen years old kid, no less - manage to get Stain to follow him? 

Eraserhead can scarcely imagine Stain having followers - Nedzu actually suspected he had someone, though he hunted alone. Stain being the follower‚Ä¶ this elevated Legion‚Äôs potential threat level immensely. Wasn‚Äôt the Hero Killer about to be ‚Äòpromoted‚Äô to an S-Rank himself? 

It can - and hopefully is - a deception on Legion‚Äôs part. It‚Äôs not like Eraserhead got to see Stain and Legion working together. All he has are Legion‚Äôs words.

‚ÄúWhat would that favour be?‚Äù Aizawa asks. 

‚ÄúI need the underground heroes to pull out from Hosu for a few days.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúI know that Ms. Joke sent a lot of them to look for Stain. And I know that she will listen to you if you ask her for it. I want them out by the end of tomorrow.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh? I might consider that‚Ä¶ if you tell me what you are planning.‚Äù Erasure Hero replies. He needs information. Legion has already outgrew their estimations of his potential danger level. 

‚ÄúAll I can tell you is that it will change the dynamic between the Hero Commission and the UA completely.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to win Nedzu‚Äôs war for him, and keep your hands and his paws clean. But I want to avoid collateral damage, and to that end, I need to get rid of all the wild cards. A group of underground heroes whose placement I can‚Äôt predict can throw the whole plan through the window, and you know how ugly improvisation can be from the mess in the USJ.‚Äù 

Eraserhead mentally skims through everything that he knows about Izuku Midoriya. How trustworthy is he? He didn‚Äôt shout at Nedzu about going too far, only to immediately go too far himself. That would be illogical.

His knowledge points towards conditional yes. The League did its best to limit collateral damage during the USJ attack, made sure to not hurt any kids (save for a small slip that was Bakugou), and targeted the Hero Commission‚Äôs hero. Legion appeared to be a fanboy of UA, but‚Ä¶ 

‚Ä¶ is that still a thing? Hearing about UA faculty arranging assassinations of their political enemies can change a fanboy into a hater. Agreeing - even verbally - to pull out of a city at the behest of a S-Rank villain will be a nail to the political coffin if made public. 

Eraserhead hated politics.

‚ÄúI already had that talk with the Alliance, before you ask.‚Äù Legion interrupts his musings again. ‚ÄúCrawler‚Äôs merry bunch of misfits has already left the city. All I‚Äôm doing is having the groups I like pull out before shit hits the fan. No weird schemes here.‚Äù 

He knows about Crawler too? The day just keeps getting worse. But if the Vigilante Alliance DID pull out at his insistence‚Ä¶ it gave some credence to Legion‚Äôs words. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to check if the Alliance has truly pulled back.‚Äù Eraserhead eventually decides what to do. ‚ÄúBut if it did‚Ä¶ then you have the deal.‚Äù 

‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù Legion sounds genuinely happy. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt throw out the phone. I‚Äôll tell you when to switch the TV on.‚Äù Then the call ends.

Switch the TV on? What did Eraserhead just agree to? 

 

***

 

‚ÄúI wish to apologize.‚Äù Nedzu says, actually bowing his head before them. ‚ÄúWhat I did was wrong. I let my personal vendetta against the Hero Commission cloud my mind, and took the war with them too far. I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ and I promise you that this will not happen again.‚Äù 

Eraserhead didn‚Äôt expect to be called into the Principal‚Äôs office for this. Judging from the look on the All Might‚Äôs face, he wasn‚Äôt the only one. 

‚ÄúPrincipal Nedzu.‚Äù All Might is the first one to answer. He is in his inflated state‚Ä¶ but the solemn and serious expression on his face made him look strange. This isn‚Äôt the smiling face that the world was used to. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to lie to you. I find your actions reprehensible. I‚Äôm not blind to the world, I know what state Japan is in. And I know that without you and Sir Nighteye doing some morally questionable things behind the curtains, the villain that tore my stomach and lung out would still be at large. But I‚Äôll repeat my words from our arguments - we are heroes. We are supposed to inspire people. Give them hope. Become an example for them to follow.‚Äù Few short seconds of silence. ‚ÄúYou ordered assassination of almost forty heroes. Regardless of what they did or whether they could be dealt through a legal process, you went too far. Whether or not you apologize for it, I expect you to turn yourself in when only it will be possible to do that without threatening the integrity of Japan. And if you do not do it, then I will do it for you.‚Äù 

Technically, all that Nedzu did was leak evidence of corruption. But to a man who considered cleansing corruption with bloody murder his calling. Whether that would influence the verdict was anyone‚Äôs guess. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll do that gladly.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúBecause if I‚Äôll be in a position to do it, then it will mean that my work in Japan is over, and the country is safe.‚Äù 

Eraserhead wonders if he was going to get imprisoned too. He did act as a courier on three occasions. Nedzu probably knew that he would say no to most cases, so those three were particularly nasty. But somehow he doubted that it would be a good defense in court. 

‚ÄúWater under the bridge now.‚Äù Aizawa says. ‚ÄúWe should get ready to deal with the fallout. Legion contacted me directly.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHe did what?‚Äù All Might is startled. Nedzu is obviously startled as well, but he did that wordlessly. 

‚ÄúPhone call.‚Äù Eraserhead replies. ‚ÄúUnless he lied to me, Stain has just joined the League of Villains.‚Äù Nedzu goes pale. Probably. Lack of human face (or exposed skin) makes identification of such expressions hard, but Eraserhead has a hunch. ‚ÄúLegion knows all about your deals with Stain and used that as a leverage to make me withdraw all underground heroes from Hosu for a few days. Right after he persuaded the Vigilante Alliance to pull out from the city too.‚Äù 

Eraserhead sighs tiredly. It is only going to get uglier from now on. He simply knows that. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what his plans for Hosu are, but apparently they will ‚Äòchange the dynamic between the Hero Commission and UA‚Äô... and ‚Äòwin Nedzu‚Äôs war for him, while keeping our hands and paws clean‚Äô. I‚Äôm quoting Legion here.‚Äù Eraserhead continues. ‚ÄúIt will also include television, since he told me that he‚Äôll phone me again to tell me when to switch on the TV. So, Nedzu, if you believe in any greater power, you should pray fervently until the plan goes through. Because if Legion lied to me about his goals, your bloodthirsty streak has just allowed a sixteen years old hero fanboy turned supervillain to checkmate the entire UA.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh dear.‚Äù If Nedzu was, indeed, pale earlier, then now he is borderline transparent. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs very bad news indeed.‚Äù 

 

***

 

‚ÄúSo, does everyone understand the plan?‚Äù Izuku asks, raising his head. The entire League of Villains, including the four new potential recruits, are with him. All surrounding a large table with a map of Hosu. With a number of flags and chess pieces scattered through it. Plus some pictures, typically of local pro-heroes whose quirks Izuku dissected. 

‚ÄúAre you sure you are sixteen years old?‚Äù It is Spinner who voices the main controversy. ‚ÄúAnd not, dunno, a century old villain mastermind who got hit by an age-reversing quirk?‚Äù 

It is quite ironic that his sister has just that quirk. And that his father is a two centuries old villain mastermind. But he isn‚Äôt going to announce either, although he can see Stain and Himiko growing faint smiles after the question. They know about Eri‚Äôs quirk. 

‚ÄúWe are wondering about that too.‚Äù Mustard comments, causing few of the League‚Äôs old members to chuckle or laugh. 

‚ÄúI had a good teacher.‚Äù Izuku replies, trying not to blush. ‚ÄúAnd started early.‚Äù Understatement. Both sentences, in fact. The actual training started when he was eight years old, but it‚Äôs not like he didn‚Äôt catch some snippets of knowledge here and there earlier. 

Stain laughs loudly. 

‚ÄúAnd now you know why I like this kid.‚Äù The Hero Killer says. ‚ÄúConvictions, adherence to a personal creed‚Ä¶ and brains. You only got better since the last time, Izuku.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but I‚Äôm still one hundred percent sure that things will go bad at some point.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúUSJ‚Äôs plan was equally good, but I can‚Äôt foresee everything. I got two main sources of wildcards in the city out of it, but‚Ä¶ plans can only take you so far. Worst of all, we only had two teams to coordinate back then, but now we have a few more. Kurogiri and Gremlin are going to be crucial. So I‚Äôm saying this once again - if any of them is in danger, the nearest party has to drop whatever they are doing and move in to assist. And what‚Äôs even more important‚Ä¶‚Äù He takes a deep breath. He almost starts to mumble. ‚Äú... we do not kill anyone but Endeavor. Got it?‚Äù 

Wave of nods and weak vocal confirmations. Should be good enough. 

He thinks that his plan is perfect. But then Dabi comes forward and has a serious talk with Izuku. 

If they manage to pull it off, tomorrow's operation is going to be spectacular. And Izuku couldn‚Äôt wait to see the results. 
Notes:

    Endeavor: Why do I hear boss music?
    Legion: ... Mei, what did I tell you about blasting music from loudspeaker during the operations?

    Also I don't think it's ever stated openly in this fic, but it's heavily implied that the HPSC was behind the whole 'illegal experimentation and denial of human rights' in Nedzu's backstory.

Phase Two can be summarized as ‚ÄòChaos‚Äô. They need ten or twenty minutes alone with Endeavor - alone, but in front of cameras, of course. This can‚Äôt be achieved if there are some free and unoccupied heroes walking around the city. 

They are three main hero agencies within Hosu City. They all receive nasty wake-up calls when Kurogiri warps to each of them, bringing second gen noumus with him. Four to the first one, four to the second one - and a single Near High-End to the third one. Each receives a single handler to make sure they don‚Äôt cause too much damage (or kill/maim someone) - those are Spinner, Zealot and Mindscrew. The last one is paired with Mustard - Izuku doesn‚Äôt fully trust the noumus, even the Near-High Ends.

In the meantime, Dabi and Gremlin walk to the headquarters of Hosu police. Nobody tries to stop them, as the building was rapidly vacated following a fire alarm merely a few minutes earlier - and, besides, they enter from the roof where Kurogiri warped them to. 

Dabi ensures that the fire alarm is genuine by setting an actual fire (visible from the street below) before getting warped back to base. Gremlin in the meantime connects to the police network, allowing La Brava (once again hired to do the job, but this time with a handful of subcontractors) to enter the security network of Hosu City. Creating dozens of false alarms for heroes that weren't in the agencies when the attack started. 

The chief of local police tries to contact the mayor, only to discover that phones in the entire city stopped working. Although even if they still worked, the mayor would be unable to answer due to the small EMP bomb (courtesy of a certain Gremlin) shutting down his building‚Äôs power supply, and keeping him trapped in his office. 

Within fifteen minutes, the security in the entire city is thoroughly compromised. As Izuku promised a certain journalist, the eyes of the entire Japan began to turn towards Hosu. 

In his secret hideout in a completely different city, Izuku gives a quick heads-up to Eraserhead and his parents to switch on the TV. He also quickly phones a certain journalist to get ready. 

The show is about to start. He is about to enter the stage.

And so are the four wild cards to derail the plan.

‚ÄúWe still do not know the extent of the damage.‚Äù A reporter on the screen announces. One of the few lucky reporters to be in Hosu, now fully taking advantage of that fact. ‚ÄúWhat we do know is that a fire broke out in the headquarters of local police forcing it to be evacuated, and that the three main hero agencies in the city came under attack by villains. Some of them have been identified as members of the League of Villains, a group that became known for their daring raid on the UA earlier this year. What‚Äôs more, phones throughout the city stopped working, but it‚Äôs too early to say if that too is the work of villains or if the network is overwhelmed by call attempts. Heroes appear incapable to respond to emergencies sprouting throughout the city, and‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh dear.‚Äù Nedzu says in the silence of the UA teacher‚Äôs lounge. All Might and Eraserhead that are accompanying him simply stare at the screen in silence. ‚ÄúOur sixteen years old hero fanboy just took over a city.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just a diversion.‚Äù Eraserhead replies. ‚ÄúHe is making sure that heroes and the police are too busy to try to stop whatever he is doing.‚Äù And he is rather vigorous about it, the hero has to admit. But only in his thoughts. 

‚ÄúThe real question‚Ä¶‚Äù Says All Might. ‚Äú ‚Ä¶ is what he is doing.‚Äù 

Suddenly the image of the screen shifts, the reporter‚Äôs wave of words cut in half. Instead of him, they see a familiar figure of Endeavor. He and his sidekick (Burnin, if Eraserhead remembered it correctly) are standing on what appeared to be an abandoned street. Probably somewhere in Hosu, he mentioned in an interview that he is going to move to the city to catch the Hero Killer‚Ä¶

Oh no, thinks Eraserhead. He connected the dots. Judging from Nedzu‚Äôs faint gasp, he isn‚Äôt the only one. 

Pitch black mist forming behind Endeavor is way too familiar. The flaming hero turns to face it‚Ä¶ just as figures start to emerge from it. 

‚ÄúMy name is Legion, and we are the League of Villains.‚Äù The familiar figure in All Might‚Äô hoodie announces, with Stain emerging right beside it. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve decided to interrupt your day in order to judge Hero Number Two, Endeavor for his crimes‚Ä¶ since we can‚Äôt exactly expect the police, heroes and the courts to do their work.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNow that‚Äôs quite‚Ä¶ ambitious.‚Äù Nedzu says, changing understatement into an art. All Might is visibly terrified. 

(somewhere in Japan, the face of a certain two-hundred years old criminal mastermind beams with pride, while his wife is preparing a supply of tissue boxes)

‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt hope to take him down, he isn‚Äôt a one trick pony like Thunderbolt.‚Äù Eraserhead says confidently. ‚ÄúAnd he is a ranged combatant mostly, perfect counter to Legion and Stain. He just needs to keep them at a distance, and they won‚Äôt be able to do anything.‚Äù 

Two more figures emerge. One is Decay, the hands costume easily recognizable. The other is a horrifically scarred young man in a leather coat. The living warpgate retracts but stays behind the four. 

‚ÄúHow bold of you, villains.‚Äù Endeavor is loud. He probably doesn‚Äôt know about the camera, it‚Äôs just his personality. ‚ÄúSince you were kind enough to come to me yourself, I‚Äôll give you a chance. Surrender now, or‚Ä¶‚Äù 

Burnin moves swiftly, knife suddenly in her hand. The cut is shallow, and the blade is immediately thrown towards Stain. He catches it with almost inhuman speed and licks it. 

Endeavor suddenly falls to the ground, like a marionette whose strings were cut. 

Eraserhead stares at the image in shock. All Might grows paler by the second - probably realized how easy it would be to take HIM down like that. Nedzu looks torn between amazement, amusement and horror. 

‚ÄúWhat have you done to me!‚Äù Endeavor screams in impotent rage. 

(somewhere in Hosu, a train makes an emergency stop and two heroes leave it in hurry)

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù Legion sighs loudly. The camera has a microphone good enough to actually catch it. ‚ÄúNot only you haven‚Äôt even noticed that Vampire replaced your closest sidekick two hours ago‚Ä¶‚Äù The fake Burnin makes a victory sign and hops over to the Legion side. ‚Äù... but the first thing you do after that is to scream about yourself. The real Burnin is unharmed, if slightly‚Ä¶ bound. And probably deeply touched by your attention.‚Äù He turns his head towards Stain. ‚ÄúAs I promised. Endeavor‚Äôs yours to judge, Stain.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd as I promised, me and my allies will now join the League of Villains.‚Äù Stain announces before walking over the fallen Endeavor. He draws his katana and hovers it above the Number Two Hero. ‚ÄúAre you ready to face justice, false hero?‚Äù 

‚ÄúAs if a villain like you had a right to talk about justice.‚Äù You can say a lot of nasty things about Endeavor, but not that he is a coward. ‚ÄúYou are just a murderer, Hero Killer. Even if you manage to kill me now, someone else will end you.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking forward to it!‚Äù Hero Killer replies with pride. Eraserhead doesn‚Äôt doubt his honesty even for a second.  ‚ÄúWhen I began purging the world of fakes of you, I took it for granted that a hero would finally come and stop me. I am, as you said, a murderer. And heroes stop murderers. My only wish was for my vanquisher to be worthy of his title.‚Äù He smiles widely - and maniacally. ‚ÄúBut what sort of court would we be, if you didn‚Äôt get to hear the accusations before execution? Dabi.‚Äù He turns his head towards the horrifically scarred man. ‚ÄúI assume you have something to say?‚Äù  

‚ÄúOh, let me guess.‚Äù Endeavor decides to deride his soon-to-be killers. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a villain who tried to kill, rape or steal from someone‚Ä¶ and then I, the horrible, horrible hero came and burned you. And now I‚Äôm going to be killed for that quote unquote crime.‚Äù 

The burned man - Dabi, Eraserhead reminds himself - walks over the fallen giant and kneels down in front of him. 

‚ÄúThe burning part and getting killed for it is correct.‚Äù Dabi replies calmly. Eraserhead could see his eyes gleaming. ‚ÄúBut the villain part came later. You don‚Äôt recognize me, Endeavor? I‚Äôm quite sad. Sure, I changed a lot‚Ä¶ but what father fails to recognize his firstborn son?‚Äù

Eraserhead thinks that he heard something wrong for a second. All Might takes a deep breath, his eyes fixed on the screen. They can see Endeavor‚Äôs face‚Ä¶ and how pale it gets within a few seconds. 

‚ÄúT...Touya?!‚Äù The terror and shock is clearly audible. 

(in the Todoroki residence a plate drops from someone‚Äôs hands. In another city, Shoto stares at the screen in shock, the sidekick and heroes present in the agency he choose to intern taking the look on his face as a confirmation) 

‚ÄúYes, father.‚Äù Dabi smiles. ‚ÄúLook, I survived your flames. But wait, this is supposed to be a court!‚Äù He stands up, extending his arms, what remains of his face gleaming with happiness and satisfaction. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs list your crimes chronologically, shall we?‚Äù 

And he starts talking. About how Endeavor dreamed of creating a perfect heir to defeat All Might, so he used the Hero Commission‚Äôs help to arrange a perfect quirk marriage. On how he treated Touya as his default successor due to being born first and the strength of his flames, ignoring the fact that his fire resistance didn‚Äôt work as it should. How he eventually decided that Touya‚Äôs useless and went to look for alternatives.

Then he goes on how Endeavor treated his wife as a broodmare, and started producing spare children. On how his next two children were deemed ‚Äòfailures‚Äô, and how the last one, Shouto, was finally his perfect ‚Äòmasterpiece‚Äô. 

And then he describes - in front of the entire Japan - how Endeavor casted Touya aside, despite the elder brother trying even harder to succeed in the mission that he took as his sole goal in life. How Touya eventually had enough of it (especially when his youngest brother began to go through the ‚Äòtraining‚Äô as well) seeked help elsewhere, only for people to either ignore his claims as delusional or be too afraid to help. 

On how the one and only person who tried to help him (a particularly brave policeman) was ‚Äòdiscouraged‚Äô from continuing on this road by someone from the Hero Commission. 

And how he finally tried to stop his father and used his quirk, only to get burned almost to death in the resulting struggle. How the flames of his father - and his own - burned his skin off‚Ä¶ and how he managed to fake his death thanks to some kind soul in the hospital that he ended up in. 

And how the Hero Commission helped to cover his death as an accident too. 

(somewhere in Tokyo the most powerful woman in Japan crushes the glass of wine in her hand...  and fails to notice that as she phones her coworkers to interrupt the broadcast and wake up people from the PR department)

And finally, he says how his mother finally snapped under pressure and threw boiling water at Shouto‚Äôs face‚Ä¶ on the half that resembled his father. How the Hero Commission helped his father put her in a mental asylum while making sure that nobody would ask any questions about the reasons for the snap. 

(Stain reapplies paralysis on Endeavor, but Eraserhead barely notices it)

And how Todoroki Shoto, despite that, won the UA Sports Festival while using only his mother‚Äôs side of his power‚Ä¶ as he vowed to never use his father‚Äôs flames. 

As he ends his tale. Eraserhead is angry. At himself. Why didn‚Äôt he notice? Why didn‚Äôt he ask Shoto why he only uses half of his power? Why did he fail him, just like everyone else failed his older brother? 

‚ÄúEN...DE..VOOOR‚Ä¶‚Äù All Might is absolutely livid. He is in his inflated form, his fists and mouth clenched. Eraserhead never saw the Symbol of Peace this furious. To this day, All Might seemed oddly blind to how much Endeavor hated him‚Ä¶ but now, he understands. 

He also understands how that hatred ruined the lives of five innocent people. 

‚ÄúAnd this isn‚Äôt even everything.‚Äù Legion speaks as Dabi ends his speech. ‚ÄúThe Hero Commission does it all the time. Does anyone still remember the nine victims of that horrible fire in Nagata nine years ago? A terrible villain fight that had left my mother paralyzed and her sister dead.‚Äù

Some people do remember. If not, many others will find out tonight. Eraserhead is certain of that. He also knows what‚Äôs going to happen next, not like it can help anyone.

(Bakugou Katsuki‚Äôs parents recognize the victims. Realization starts dawning on their faces)

‚ÄúOnly the villain fight was, in fact, Thunderbolt messing up.‚Äù Legion continues. ‚ÄúTook me years to find out the truth, since the Hero Commission did their cover-up so well. And thus I am here. A villain dispensing justice because he cannot trust the heroes to do that.‚Äù He laughs bitterly. ‚ÄùDabi?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù The scarred man shakes his head. ‚ÄúSons shouldn‚Äôt kill their fathers. Even such fathers.‚Äù Endeavor is a broken man. He doesn‚Äôt say anything, merely stares in shock and terror. ‚ÄúHe is yours to judge, Stain.‚Äù

Dabi and Decay vanish from the scene, teleported away by the warpgate. 

‚ÄúAny last words, Endeavor?‚Äù Stain asks. The answer is silence. ‚ÄúVery well. I pronounce you a fake hero. A villain that became a false idol to the masses.  An insult to the very concept of heroism. And the punishment for that‚Ä¶ is death.‚Äù The sword raises. 

The first three wildcards arrive at the scene. 

 

***

 

Up until this moment, Izuku‚Äôs plan was going swimmingly. Local heroes were occupied with the distractions. Policemen were running around like headless chicken. Endeavor had his crimes exposed to the entire world (Vampire is in their hideout, observing news - she would write to him if it was taken off). His voice changer makes sure that he doesn‚Äôt stutter in his lines. 

In short, it is going perfectly. 

Then, right before Stain could nail Endeavor to the ground with his sword, the Hero Number Two suddenly vanishes. Something (he saw hands for a second) pulled him underground, the massive body somehow melting into it. 

‚ÄúWhat the‚Ä¶‚Äù Stain is startled too. He takes a step back and looks around. Then gets kicked in the face by something small and very, very quick. 

Izuku curses quietly. 

Endeavor emerges from the ground twenty meters away from them. Next to him is someone wearing the familiar armor of the Ingenium‚Ä¶ and another hero. Whom he recognizes instantly, as he watched him during the festival. 

Mirio Togata. Lemillion. 

(in a certain school, Hero Number One - and a certain underground one - gasp loudly simultaneously, shocked by the new arrivals that they both recognize)

Since when can he move others underground? Izuku is confused. He would have known if that was a thing during the festival.

‚ÄúKurogiri.‚Äù Legion says calmly. ‚ÄúEvacuate other teams, then come back.‚Äù The warper obeys and vanishes from the street. 

Something went wrong. It‚Äôs time to pull out whoever he can, in case they need to be warped in as reinforcements. 

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you hear what was just said, Lemillion?‚Äù Legion shouts. The hero is surprised by being recognized. ‚ÄúThe man you are defending is a monster. Monster that no court in this country can touch.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI do not care.‚Äù Lemillion shouts back. ‚ÄúIf he truly committed these crimes, I‚Äôll make sure that he pays for them. But I will not let you murder him.‚Äù 

Barrage of blows intensifies. Stain takes them all in silence, his hands protecting his face. First few dozen shake him a bit‚Ä¶ but then they stop working. His eyes dart around the street, following the attacker. Reading his movements better and better with every second.

‚ÄúGood answer, Lemillion!‚Äù Izuku shouts cheerfully. ‚ÄúYou are a great hero. Someone actually worthy of the title. Unfortunately‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm still a villain.‚Äù 

Reflex Boost. Overhaul.  

He touches the ground under him. Overhaul can alter all matter, not just the biological one - something he intentionally forgot to mention to detective Tsukauchi. Now he takes advantage of that. Nobody can recognize the fact that he is using that man‚Äôs quirk. 

He also takes advantage of the fact that he trained altering non-organic matter a lot. 

The ground shifts. Massive hands emerge from it in front of Lemillion and Ingenium‚Äôs brother, made of concrete and asphalt. Lemillion shatters his with a surprisingly powerful punch, while Tenya Iida (Izuku finally remembered the name) shouts ‚ÄòRecipro Burst‚Äô and breaks the other hand with a massive, supercharged kick.

Ahh, super move. Like Ingenium‚Äôs, but with different placement of the engine. Izuku loves super moves, just like he loves heroes (and villains) as a whole. 

Stain catches up. He observed the attacker, studying his moves under the relentless barrage of blows coming from everywhere. Finally he is ready. The movement of his hand is too fast for Izuku to follow. He clenches his fingers on the attacker‚Äôs leg, and smashes him into the wall of the building next to him. 

‚ÄúGran Torino!‚Äù Lemillion shouts. The name is familiar. An old man slides down the wall, shaken and bleeding. Still conscious, but probably not for long. 

(All Might is terrified - if he could, he would rush to Hosu. But he knows he would arrive too late)

Izuku makes a connection.

‚ÄúStain, wait!‚Äù The Hero Killer pauses in his steps. ‚ÄúHe is All Might‚Äôs old mentor. Let him be.‚Äù Stain thinks for a second. He is interrupted when Ingenium storms after him. 

The kick, still powered by the Recipro Burst, pushes him back. But Stain is a combat veteran, who is facing someone powered by rage - yet essentially inexperienced. 

Tenya Iida feels satisfaction only for a few seconds. Then his body collapses on the ground, paralyzed by Stain‚Äôs quirk. He didn‚Äôt even notice the shallow cut on his leg. 

‚ÄúYou I will spare in memory of your brother.‚Äù Stain recognized the kid too. He is standing victorious over two fallen heroes (even if one of them is still a student), but is magnanimous in his victory. Neither of them were his prey for tonight. ‚ÄúAnd because you rushed in to save him.‚Äù He looks towards Gran Torino. ‚ÄúAnd you I spare because I do not kill the elderly.‚Äù 

He walks beside them, ignoring the curses that Tenya throws at him. His target is the still paralyzed Endeavor, lying on the street behind Lemillion. 

Lemillion comes to a decision. Izuku can see that in his eyes. The ground under him explodes, and Izuku sees bursts of electricity surrounding his fist and legs. None of this makes sense. 

He dashes forward, too fast for Izuku‚Äôs eyes to follow. 

SURVIVOR, LIFE SUPPORT!  

The lights go out. 

(his mother cries before the TV, while his father stares at it in horror - the only person in Japan save for All Might and Sir Nighteye that understood what just happened)

 

***

 

The impact was impossibly powerful. 

Stain was a veteran of hundreds of fights. He saw a lot of things. But his fights tended to be cut short by his quirk. And before this day, he never saw up close how the true power looks like. 

The street vanished. The hero kid stands there, panting heavily. His right arm is visibly broken and shattered, and he seems to be barely able to stand upright. Before him, Stain sees nothing. Steam and dust cover everything. But he can see damages on the buildings on both sides of the street going on forever.

Izuku disappeared.

Stain stands up from the ground. Only now he realizes that what sent him there was the air pressure of the punch. He heard that All Might could do such a thing, but a schoolkid? 

The strength was absurd, but the speed wasn‚Äôt. Stain had time to leap back and cover the fallen Ingenium (oh how similar he was to his brother) and the fallen hero. It was an instinct. The danger he felt from the young hero was so overwhelming that he didn‚Äôt think before he acted. 

But now he stands up. And feels particularly murderous. 

What happened to Izuku? Did he...

Hand emerges from the smoke. The hero kid is too close to it and too exhausted to react in time. When it touches him, his remaining arm and legs twist unnaturally and the young hero screams and falls to the ground. 

Then the rest of Izuku emerges from the smoke. 

(somewhere in Japan, a terrified mother starts crying even more. Upstairs, her adopted daughter hugs her dog even more, wondering what happened this time. All Might, in his school, is even more terrified than Midoriya Inko, but for a different reason)

Stain has no idea how Izuku is still able to stand. The front of his hoodie was practically vapourized by the hit - and so was most of the skin under it. His mask vanished somewhere, exposing his true face to the world. He is bleeding profusely from everywhere. And if that isn‚Äôt enough, his right arm is just‚Ä¶ gone. 

(In the League‚Äôs hideout, Himiko screams in horror. Mustard stares at the image on the screen with a blank face, his brain refusing to process what he sees. Tenko wants to murder whoever hurt his unofficial little brother so much. The three sidekicks of Stain have their reactions much more subdued)

‚ÄúThat was really close, Lemillion.‚Äù The voice is weak, but not inaudible. ‚ÄúJust a little bit faster or a little bit stronger, and you would take me out. And then you could focus on Stain. You would probably save Endeavor. You are a really cool hero, you know? You broke your arm saving someone whom you knew didn't deserve that.‚Äù Izuku turns his head toward Stain. ‚ÄúFinish him before the paralysis ends.‚Äù 

Kurogiri appears from nowhere, his face unreadable. He floats quickly towards Izuku, who gestures to him to stay back. 

Stain starts walking towards the fallen flame fake. To say no to an order said by someone who kept standing despite wounds like that is unthinkable. The strength of conviction alone is‚Ä¶ almost unmatched. Equal to his. Perhaps more. He is impressed. More than he would like to admit.

Lemillion and Tenya curse him. He doesn‚Äôt care. He never did. 

Gran Torino remains unconscious, slumped by the wall. Did he bleed out when no one was looking?

That‚Äôs when the fourth wildcard makes a move. 
Notes:

    Not many plans survive the contact with the enemy. That one, certainly, didn't.

    Few notes.

    1. In this here AU, United States of Smash is more of an ulti. It can be used more than once in a Holder's life, it's more like drawing so much of the One for All into your punch that you left weakened for a while afterwards. But it's certainly the strongest stuff in All Might/Lemillion's arsenal.

    2. I'm not saying that Toga & Stain would make a horrifying duo capable of taking down most high-ranked heroes if they did it that way, and didn't do it in front of the cameras to not warn their future victims of it. But, like, that's some scary combo attack.

    3. Whether Endeavor was more of a dick in this AU or whether Dabi put his own spin on the tale is your decision to make.

Chapter 13: Fall of Hosu
Summary:

    The Hosu battle comes to a rather unexpected conclusion...

Notes:

    So many theories. From Endeavor standing up, through AfO showing up to Hawks arriving. Unfortunately, every single one of your theories was incorrect ;)

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

It started a few minutes before Lemillion‚Äôs desperate punch almost vapourized Izuku Midoriya. In a place well hidden in one of the many forested areas of Japan, movement starts. More and more people and equipment appear out of nowhere. Their leader rushing her plans to take advantage of the unexpected. 

Nobody notices as one of the people sends an urgent message to her childhood friend. The rest, as they say, is history. 

 

***

 

Kurogiri is terrified. 

He knows he is intimidating. He is mostly composed of creepy black mist! Almost a walking definition of a villainous quirk. But deep inside, he is a big softie as Izuku often says. 

He is also a noumu. He knows that. What his creators do not realize is that he recovered most of ‚Äòhis‚Äô memories a long time ago. He didn‚Äôt particularly care. He might have been a young hero in another life, but right now? Right now he is Kurogiri. His old memories might as well be a film he once watched. He feels no attachment to it. Nor to any of the actors that starred in it.

But he does to the kids he helped bring up. Tenko and Himiko could as well be his natural children. To the rest he is either an adoptive almost-a-parent or a favourite uncle. 

Now he saw one of them dying. On the TV. Seconds before he was supposed to warp there. Everyone else is out of the city. 

He was too late. 

Or not. 

Izuku emerges from the smoke. Kurogiri warps to Hosu, his invisible face contorted with an expression of horror. He has no idea how Izuku is still alive, much less how he is still standing and telling Stain to finish the job. 

And then he gestures to Kurogiri to wait. To not teleport him to the Doctor to patch him up (is that even possible with wounds like that? It will take a lot of time for the Doctor to pick him from behind all his defenses, Kurogiri doesn‚Äôt know where his base is). 

Kurogiri doesn‚Äôt know what to do. Izuku‚Äôs father probably knows‚Ä¶ too bad that Izuku made sure that he was the only line of contact between them. Kurogiri can warp there, but it would take minutes and...

Then he can feel his telephone vibrating. 

Stain slowly walks towards the fallen Endeavor. The two hero kids (kids!) curse him to stop. 

‚ÄúI think that message is for you.‚Äù Kurogiri says to Izuku, his voice only outwardly calm.

‚ÄúOh yeah.‚Äù Izuku chuckles and spits blood. ‚ÄúI think I lost my phone. Clumsy me.‚Äù He picks up Kurogiri‚Äôs phone and looks at the screen. Then his face (miraculously intact) freezes in shock. 

Kurogiri can see the conversation from his position. 

 

UA-Spy: QLF IS ATTACKING HOSU

UA-SPY: RIGHT NOW

UA-SPY: GET EVERYONE OUT

UA-SPY: RUN

 

Somewhere at the horizon a glowing arrow is launched. It flies upward, towards the night sky above them. Stain freezes and tries to figure out what it is. 

‚ÄúWarp everyone out.‚Äù Izuku suddenly says. His face, calm even after his horrific injuries, is now filled with terror. ‚ÄúEven heroes. Leave only Endeavor,‚Äù Stain hears it, and turns his face to look at Izuku. What he sees on his face shocks him. ‚ÄúNOW!‚Äù

Kurogiri warps everyone out without questioning it.

Few seconds later the arrow explodes.

And everywhere in Hosu the quirks stop working.

 

***

 

The cameraman is shocked by the turn of events. He isn‚Äôt Taneo Tokuda - instead, he is someone else that was tasked with the job. Tokuda is too valuable person to risk his life, and‚Ä¶ however dumb he feels about it right now, the man who just filmed the era change (and the start of a war, though it will take Japan as a whole quite a while to realize that) has volunteered.

He somehow remains untouched by the hero‚Äôs punch. ‚ÄòSomehow‚Äô is probably due to him finding a good hideout. He has experience in that. 

Then something unexpected happens. The League of Villains members vanish, taking most of the heroes with them. He is left alone with still paralyzed Endeavor. 

Something explodes at the horizon. Endeavor‚Äôs flaming hair vanishes. The hero (is he still one?) stands up a few seconds later. 

‚ÄúEndeavor.‚Äù Says a figure floating in the air in front of the fallen hero. She (the voice and body shape agree) is wearing some form of tight body-armor, including a gasmask. The camera man can see black disks with yellow outlines floating around her in the air, one of them serving as a platform for her to stand. 

‚ÄúEclipse.‚Äù The flame hero replies. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt expect to see you tonight.‚Äù His voice is subdued and burned out. He knows what‚Äôs going to happen now. The League destroyed him, but the QLF will kill him.

‚ÄúI had to rush my plans a little.‚Äù The leader of the QLF and one of the most wanted people in Japan replies with a hint of cheerfulness in her voice. ‚ÄúWhen I heard of the League‚Äôs assault on Hosu, and on your presence here, I simply had to come say hello.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ Now you have power. And I‚Äôm powerless.‚Äù Endeavor says quietly. ‚ÄúIronic.‚Äù

‚ÄúTruly.‚Äù Eclipse replies and beheads the Number Two Hero with a flick of her finger. 

Behind her, the city begins to burn.

 

***

 

They warp back to the bar. Izuku barely has the time to register what has happened when Himiko leaps at him, tears in her eyes. She doesn‚Äôt grab him (she is probably too afraid that she would kill him) she just‚Ä¶ stands right in front of him. Not sure what to do. 

‚ÄúEverything will be alright.‚Äù Izuku says weakly. ‚ÄúStain. Stain!‚Äù The serial killer is there. On his face, a complicated mix of emotions. The two captives scream at them. ‚ÄúGet them unconscious. Now. Himiko, find Mei and bring her prisoner collars.‚Äù 

He wants to go to sleep. But he knows that if he does, he will never wake up. Survivor is a quirk that levels down fatal wounds into near-fatal ones. It should have several charges, but Lemillion punch - it was One for All at full power, he just knows it, he was just United States of Smashed like his dad was twice - ate through all of them at once. 

What kept Izuku alive after that was Life Support - a quirk that let him maintain his own life despite blood loss and wounds, for as long as the damage received wasn‚Äôt instantly fatal (so heart and brain were still there). It was a perfect combo with Survivor, but now the Survivor was out of charges, and Life Support was burning out quickly. 

Using Overhaul and Life Support combo to take out Lemillion might have been a mistake. Why did it tire him out so much?

He needs to reset himself. But if he does that while the captives are conscious, he will have to kill them. Tsukauchi and Eraserhead know that Overhaul could reset wounds to his body. They will connect the dots. They will figure out who Izuku‚Äôs father is. And then the League will be destroyed. His friends will die. 

They already know too much for his taste. He can only hope that Legion‚Äôs ability to influence inorganic matter that he proved during his brief fight with Lemillion will fool them. 

Stain doesn‚Äôt ask questions. He senses urgency in Izuku‚Äôs voice. Lemillion and Tenya are knocked out promptly. And their insults and cries die down. 

Izuku uses Overhaul. The power refuses to work. He used too much energy. There is nothing left to heal him.

Is he going to die? 

No. 

‚ÄúKurogiri.‚Äù He slumps down on the floor. Everyone is panicked, too panicked to know what to do. Izuku makes a mental note to organize them some first aid lessons, but forgets about it immediately. ‚ÄúTrigger. The special one. Now.‚Äù 

Orders still work. Kurogiri brings it quickly. One of Overhaul‚Äôs special brand of Trigger. Something to give him a boost, without the nasty side-effects. Izuku raided his fridge back then. 

He fails to inject it. Someone (is that Mustard? his eyes got cloudy, he can‚Äôt see it) helps him. The energy courses through him. He tries the reset again. 

It works. His body shifts, his wounds close and his arm is restored. His eyes work again. His lungs take in air with renewed vigour. But he is still exhausted and he can feel his consciousness beginning to slip again. Did he fail to heal himself fully, or is he just too tired to stay awake?

He sees Mustard right next to him (busy falling back onto his butt), shocked looks on the faces of the Stain‚Äôs sidekicks (and only slightly less shocked on old League‚Äô members - they never saw him restore himself, especially that much). 

Stain‚Äôs eyes flare. He recognizes the quirk. He has questions, but he won‚Äôt ask them now. 

‚ÄúCheck Torino.‚Äù Izuku says. Doesn‚Äôt specify whom he speaks of. Hands pull him back to the nearby couch and lie him down on it. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead.‚Äù Stain‚Äôs voice is remorseless. Izuku refuses to accept that. It wasn‚Äôt long, he can still‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúBring him here.‚Äù He orders. He knows that he will reveal too much, but Gran Torino was All Might‚Äôs mentor. He was Lemillion‚Äôs mentor. He will not become the end of such a hero. Or he will never be able to forgive himself. 

They listen to him. He activates Overhaul when he feels something under his fingertips. 

He hears the old man inhaling suddenly. Then some sounds of struggle. And a shocked shout of.. was that Himiko? 

He floats off.

UA-Spy: How is he doing? 

VampirePrincess: Still unconscious. It‚Äôs been four days. 

VampirePrincess: I‚Äôm worried. 

CatProvider: You shouldn‚Äôt. It's a quirk exhaustion. 

VampirePrincess: I SAW HIM ALMOST DIE, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO NOT BE WORRIED

CatProvider: Himiko‚Ä¶ I understand that. I felt the same when I saw him emerge from that smoke. Looking like a walking corpse. 

CatProvider: Lashing out on me won‚Äôt help him. But I know that if he was awake, he would be worried about you being worried. 

VampirePrincess: using him against me is underhanded papagiri

Insomniac: he is right tho. then again, what is SmallMight NOT worried about

HandyMan: ^, I remember him almost bawling because he wasn‚Äôt sure if I was going to like the game he bought me as a present

HandyMan: damn that was years ago

UA-Spy: what about the new members? are they staying?

VampirePrincess: yeah, boss has‚Ä¶ left an impact

SneakyGecko: You could just ask us directly, you know?

SneakyGecko: We are new to the Villain Network, so we aren‚Äôt here a lot. But still.

UA-Spy: sorry

SneakyGecko: np mr. spy

SneakyGecko: And as Vampire said, Legion‚Ä¶ seriously, holy shit, what is that guy made of

SneakyGecko: That punch looked like United States of Smash

SneakyGecko: And he stood up after it

SneakyGecko: seriously wtf

Insomniac: welcome to the club of people seriously confused by the shit boss is pulling off regularly

Insomniac: we should get T-shirts

Insomniac: with his face and large ‚ÄòHOW DOES IT EVEN WORK‚Äô above it

VampirePrincess: lol I want one

CatProvider: You should all be happy that I immediately warped to his house and told his parents that he is alright and will make a full recovery.

SneakyGecko: why?

VampirePrincess: because his mystery dad would have fucking burned Japan to the ground if his son died

CatProvider: This, but without an expletive. 

SneakyGecko: ‚Ä¶ is his dad Re-Destro?

FuckSchool: WELCOME TO THE CLUB OF THE ENLIGHTENED

Insomniac: Jesus Christ not another one

VampirePrincess: I kinda think that his dad is the guy that stalks Re-Destro in his nightmares

VampirePrincess: Can‚Äôt tell you anything more unless boss wakes up and says that I can

SneakyGecko: I‚Äôm equally curious and terrified. 

Insomniac: Welcome to the yet another club, this time of people that aren‚Äôt sure if they want to know the truth about boss‚Äô past

VampirePrincess: So what are we doing with the prisoners btw.? Haven‚Äôt seen them in a while now that I think about it

SneakyGecko: Stain had Zealot patch the Mini-Ingenium and Mr. Megaton Punch [he knows a few things about first aid], then he gave all three those shock slash quirk suppression collars and keeps them locked

SneakyGecko: I think he waits for Legion to wake up before decisions, but hard to say

SneakyGecko: He kinda stopped talking to people and just hounds around Midoriya‚Äôs bed

FuckSchool: Ok so

FuckSchool: can we finally address the part

FuckSchool: where SmallMight FUCKING RESURRECTED that old man

FuckSchool: How does his quirk even works

FuckSchool: Can quirks even do that

FuckSchool: I‚Äôm so confused

HandyMan: boss is obviously a cleric

HandyMan: kills and heals and rezes with touch

HandyMan: but he is overleveled AND a minmaxer

HandyMan: does All Might count as a deity? I am confused

Insomniac: Izuku being the lvl 20 cleric of All Might sounds about right lol 

CatProvider: I would have rather addressed the fact that Japan is going down the drain. QLF just destroyed another town. 

VampirePrincess: Crap. Did they use the gas again?

CatProvider: Yes. Then they rolled in with soldiers and tanks through the Eclipse‚Äôs warpgate, blew up local police stations, hero agencies, a support item factory and workshops, governmental offices (not before having the local bureaucrats face firing squad in front of cameras), and setting lots of fire at random. Plus shoot whomever they didn‚Äôt like.

CatProvider: Minimal resistance, as always, but media speculate that QLF is running out of war supplies. It‚Äôs the fourth day and the fourth town, they can‚Äôt have THAT much equipment stashed up. Also all heroes out there are investing into gas masks (we apparently have a shortage throughout the country), so the resistance should be increasing. 

Insomniac: Boss is going to have a field day over this when he wakes up.

 

***

 

Izuku wakes up. Which is quite reassuring - when he was falling asleep, part of him suspected that Overhaul failed to fix everything and he was going to die. 

He is still in pain. Not a powerful one, but an ever present one. How long was he lying on the bed? How long was he unconscious? What did he miss?

‚ÄúWe have things to talk about, kid.‚Äù Stain is there. Of course he is there. The serial killer is sitting in a chair next to the entrance to the room (Izuku recognizes it now as the one he used to sleep in when he was staying the night in the base). Eyeing Izuku with an unreadable face. 

Not even a ‚Äògreat to see you awake‚Äô or something. Izuku is slightly sad. Although not like he expected anything else. Not from Uncle Stain. 

‚ÄúQuirk?‚Äù His voice is still a bit meek, so he cleared his throat profusely. Things should be better now. 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Stain replies coldly. ‚ÄúI had suspicions earlier, but now I‚Äôm certain. That‚Äôs Overhaul‚Äôs quirk. How is that possible?‚Äù 

‚ÄúHave you ever heard the urban legend about the Quirk Thief?‚Äù Stain nods. That makes things a lot easier. ‚ÄúWell, the Quirk Thief is my father.‚Äù 

Stain stares at him blankly. Izuku isn‚Äôt surprised. What he just did was an equivalent of a particularly hairy American to claim to be a son of a Bigfoot. 

‚ÄúThe more I learn about you, the more I‚Äôm not sure what to do with you.‚Äù Stain finally says. ‚ÄúSlay you? Follow you? Put you in jail? Talk with your family to give you a house arrest?‚Äù The Hero Killer sighs loudly. ‚ÄúFrom your friends‚Äô reaction I assume that they don‚Äôt know?‚Äù 

Izuku nods. 

‚ÄúIf one of them got caught and the police found out...‚Äú Izuku shakes his head. ‚ÄúThe Hero Commission and Nedzu would have dropped their disagreements and focused on the destruction of the League. Quirk Thief is a power equal to All Might in his prime. Now that he is weakened‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think that even the Symbol of Peace can defeat him. But they all think that he is dead.‚Äù

Somehow, Stain doesn‚Äôt comment on the ‚Äòequal to All Might‚Äô part. Izuku is genuinely surprised by it. 

‚ÄúSo you do not trust your friends‚Äô conviction and dedication to your cause enough to tell them the truth?‚Äù Stain‚Äôs eyes narrow. ‚ÄúIs that how far your faith in them goes? Do you have the faintest idea what they went through? They saw you dying. They didn‚Äôt know that you could pull out from it. And now they are all moping in their rooms for most of their day, at best chatting with each other on the internet. Mostly about you.‚Äù He clicks his tongue. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a killer, not a therapist. They need you.‚Äù  

Getting this talk from a serial killer with fifty-something victims under his belt is slightly surreal to Izuku. Then again, what in his life wasn‚Äôt surreal recently?

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù Izuku sighs. ‚ÄúYou are right. I‚Äôll tell the old League members the truth. The whole truth. But I‚Äôm leaving your folk until I get to know them more.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThey are yours now.‚Äù Stain replies. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs acceptable. For now.‚Äù 

He is about to leave the room, when Izuku calls him out. 

‚ÄúWait!‚Äù Stain stops and looks at him. ‚ÄúWhat about the Hero Commission? And Endeavor? What did I miss?‚Äù 

‚ÄúEclipse killed Endeavor in front of cameras.‚Äù Stain replies. ‚ÄúStealing our show and saving the Hero Commission. The blow we dealt to it was a lethal one, but Eclipse is fighting a war against Japan, and seems to be winning. So the Commission‚Äô managed to save itself by pointing out that this isn‚Äôt the good time for it to be taken down, but‚Ä¶‚Äù Stain shrugs. ‚ÄúTo that day, society was split fifty-fifty between it and the UA. But now you get lynched on the internet for saying something nice about the Commission. So a job well done, even if someone else killed that fake.‚Äù 

It was one of the nicest things Stain ever said to anyone, Izuku is certain about that. 

‚ÄúAlso, your spy mentioned something about the gas being a quirk suppressor, rather than quirk erasure.‚Äù Stain continues, and Izuku breathed a sigh of relief. ‚ÄúChronostasis is now a public figure and an S-Rank. I‚Äôm an S-Rank too. And you, although the world thinks you are dead, have been provisionally promoted to the SS-Rank.‚Äù Izuku‚Äôs eyes widen. ‚ÄúAlso we are still housing the captives, the Todoroki family vanished but the spy says that Nedzu is housing them in secret in the UA, and the QLF is burning down cities left and right because Eclipse apparently learned how to use her quirk as a warpgate. Anything else?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù Izuku decides to not strain their relationship any further. Stain doesn‚Äôt seem to enjoy being his personal news service. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù 

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù He pulls out a phone and slowly starts to push some buttons on it. Very slowly. He doesn‚Äôt seem to be used to using a phone like that. 

‚ÄúErr‚Ä¶ what are you doing, Uncle Stain?‚Äù Izuku has a gut feeling that it isn‚Äôt anything good. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm making sure that you have the occasion to have a certain talk.‚Äù Stain finishes whatever he was doing, and returns his phone to his pocket. ‚ÄúI wish you luck surviving it.‚Äù 

Then he leaves.

Izuku has something like fifteen seconds to keep wondering what was that about, before the door to his room opens up abruptly and his eyes meet Himiko‚Äôs. 

Oh. 

She proves how agile she is by pretty much jumping at him from the entrance, landing on his bed right next to him and immediately going for a (rather teary) hug. 

‚ÄúHimiko‚Ä¶‚Äù He is about to say something, but she doesn't let him.

‚ÄúJust shut up for a moment. Dummy.‚Äù She replies. So he does as she said. Besides, he missed that. But after maybe half a minute she pulls back and looks at him up close. ‚ÄúDo you have the tiniest idea how scared I was? I thought you were dying!‚Äù 

Is it a good idea to tell her that he did, in fact, almost died? If he got the Overhaul‚Äôs special Trigger a few seconds later‚Ä¶ no, probably not. She is already shaken, no need to risk shattering her completely. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Himi.‚Äù He smiles. In a sad and thoughtful way. ‚ÄúI kept you and others in the dark for a bit too long, and‚Ä¶ it backfired. So I‚Äôm going to explain everything to you. Today. I promise.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù She replies. ‚ÄúBut you should also promise me to not try to stop All Might-grade punches with your body anymore.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI promise.‚Äù He isn‚Äôt planning to do that again if he can avoid that. Lemillion didn‚Äôt seem to change the weather with the impact, so it wasn‚Äôt the full United States of Smash. More like 70-80% of the power of the All Might‚Äôs strongest hit. If it was All Might himself, or if Lemillion got more training‚Ä¶ 

He prefers not to think about it. 

Tenko and Hitoshi arrive. The gamer is silent, but in an emotional way. He doesn‚Äôt have a way with words, and when thrown out of his comfort zone he tends to do this. He just shuts down and observes. The lover of cats and caffeine is visibly reassured and with a rare smile on his face. 

‚ÄúAny hopes I get to hug him too?‚Äù Mindscrew asks. 

‚ÄúNope.‚Äù Himiko shuts him down promptly and hugs Izuku closer. She is practically lying on him (with the quilt between them, and her head on the base of his neck). ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs mine and I‚Äôm not sharing him with you.‚Äù 

Mindscrew chuckles. 

Mustard and, surprisingly enough, Gremlin roll in right after them. 

‚ÄúAwww‚Ä¶‚Äù Gremlin was visibly sad. ‚ÄúI hoped you were missing your arm, I recently read a few things about cybernetic prosthetics and I had so many ideas for new babies!‚Äù She‚Äôs so genuine in her disappointment that they can‚Äôt even hold it against her. Mustard lets out a brief chuckle. 

Kurogiri is there. Standing silently in the corner. Nobody noticed him appearing, but he fits there. The room would be half-empty without him. 

‚ÄúSo now that we were spared from having to fight a cybernetic zombie-Legion‚Ä¶‚Äù Mustard announces, and is met with laughs and a disoriented stare from Gremlin. ‚Äú... I just want to say that it‚Äôs good to see you back. But I have so many damn questions.‚Äù 

The door behind them closes silently. Stain. Of course. The Hero Killer leaves nothing to chance. 

‚ÄúActually‚Ä¶‚Äù Izuku takes a deep breath. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs time for me to answer them all.‚Äù 

Mustard‚Äôs eyes flare up.
Notes:

    What do you get when you give Overhaul's research to political (quirkless) terrorist? Bloody murder, that's what. How exactly Chronostasis managed that without Eri will be eventually described...

    Also:
    Government: LET'S DEFUND THE ARMY AND THE POLICE TOO A BIT, INVEST ALL INTO THE HEROES
    Eclipse: hello
    Eclipse: *starts tearing through a country with a warpgate quirk, few quirk-supressing warheads and a measly thousand soldiers*
    Government: Wait, that's illegal!

    GSDF still exists and will play a role further down in the story, but it's been reduced to like a single division. It would smash QLF to bits if it showed up nearby, but... ~15 000 soldiers to defend Japan (if you exclude the sizeable Navy) is a bit of a joke.

    Also Kurogiri clearly knows about Overhaul's quirk ability for self-heal, he is just panicking THIS much.

    Endeavor also has a history with Eclipse that is mostly omitted here. If Ties that Bind (my other fanfic and alternative universe to this one, seriously, give it a read) is to be trusted, they are kind of a pair of archrivals. Who have battled each other several times, but somehow Eclipse always managed to give Endeavor a slip. Finally, roles get reversed... and Endeavor fails to escape.

Chapter 14: Answers

Chapter Text

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ have you ever heard the legend of the Quirk Thief?‚Äù Izuku asks right after telling Mei to record the talk (his spy has to see it too) and he is met with surprised stares. Tenko is obviously lost (he is very trivia-proof, to Izuku‚Äôs eternal sadness), but to the mastermind‚Äôs surprise, so are the others. 

‚ÄúOh yeah, I know it.‚Äù Mustard comes to the rescue. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very old urban legend in Japan. About a man who can take and give quirks. It‚Äôs a bit like the UFOs, almost no one believes in him, but you still get supposed ‚Äòsightings‚Äô here and there.‚Äù The irony of Mustard discounting the one and only true conspiracy theory as falsehood almost sends Izuku laughing. 

‚ÄúNow that‚Äôs a broken op as hell power if I ever heard about one.‚Äù Tenko finally speaks. ‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt he just conquer the country if he can just take everyone‚Äôs power for himself? Take it all and make yourself a god-emperor rather than half-ass it.‚Äù Izuku sometimes asked himself the same question. 

Mei is almost salivating, probably after imagining all the potential babies coming from a combination of more than one quirk. Izuku chuckles internally. This talk is going to be f u u n. Just hopefully not a lethal one to anyone.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs my father.‚Äù Izuku announces. Suddenly everyone stares at him, looking as if they weren‚Äôt sure if they heard him correctly. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs what?‚Äù Mustard is the first one to speak. If that‚Äôs a conscious attempt, otherwise it‚Äôs just an incidental mumble. 

‚ÄúThe legendary Quirk Thief is my father.‚Äù Izuku clarifies his answer. ‚ÄúHe is two hundred thirty six years old, is part of the first generation of the quirked AND carries five hundred sixty two quirks in his body the last time I checked.‚Äù The silence continues, so Izuku decides to break it. ‚ÄúBut he can only ‚Äòequip‚Äô about fifteen of them at any given moment, so he is only massively overpowered rather than completely broken.‚Äù 

He can see them all trying to process the news. They know he is no liar, but what he just said was too groundbreaking and impossible for them to accept it instantly. 

‚ÄúHoly shit.‚Äù Mustard is, once again, the first one to speak. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a joke, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no it isn‚Äôt.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúFor something like two centuries he was pretty much a shadow emperor of Japan. He ruled its entire underworld, getting people to follow him by granting them quirks he took from those who defied him. He did the same thing to many politicians, and has disposed of pesky heroes whenever and however he wanted. But he retired recently, after getting two consecutive United States of Smash to the face and spending six years on life support.‚Äù  

‚ÄúAll Might beat him?‚Äù Hitoshi is torn between awe and shock. ‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶ how?‚Äù And that‚Ä¶ is a very good question. One quirk versus fifteen sounds like an unfair fight, to say the least. 

‚ÄúThey have a history together.‚Äù Izuku replies. It‚Äôs time for the probably even bigger revelation. But‚Ä¶ well, no more lies. ‚ÄúLong, long time ago my dad had a brother, who was thought to be quirkless but was a hero at heart. A true hero. Father gave him a weak power stockpiling quirk, probably as a method of control‚Ä¶ he was kinda a dick back in his time.‚Äù Izuku says, unleashing an understatement of a millenium. ‚ÄúTurned out that the brother had a fairly useless quirk that allowed itself to be transferred to others, without any other ability. But it fused with the power stockpiling quirk and created something special. So for two centuries my uncle and then his descendants were rising to challenge my father, their quirk growing stronger with every inheritor, until finally the most recent Holder, All Might, was strong enough to win. Narrowly. Dad apparently tore out All Might‚Äôs stomach and lung, and was only taken down because he didn‚Äôt expect All Might to charge at him with his innards sticking out.‚Äù Izuku sighs. ‚ÄúTo make things look even more like a grizzly fairytale, dad‚Äôs quirk is called All for One, while his brother‚Äôs called One for All.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ wow.‚Äù Mustard announces after a few seconds of complete silence. ‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ holy shit, I don‚Äôt even know how to comment on that.‚Äù Even the years he spent with increasingly outlandish conspiracy theories didn‚Äôt prepare him for that.

‚ÄúWelcome to the club.‚Äù Mindscrew replies, the shock on his face equalling the signs of insomnia in strength. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ why didn‚Äôt you mention that earlier?‚Äù Himiko and Tenko seem to agree with that question, eyeing Izuku curiously. 

‚ÄúBecause I was afraid.‚Äù Izuku answers honestly. ‚ÄúNot about myself, but about you. If even a single one of you got caught and said something that would make Nedzu or the Commission suspect I‚Äôm in any way or shape connected with the Quirk Thief‚Ä¶ it would be the end of everything. My father is Japan's unspoken boogeyman. All Might, Nedzu and the president of the Hero Commission probably still have nightmares about him. If there was even a shadow of doubt about his apparent death, the UA and HPSC would immediately stop infighting, and would work together to annihilate the League and everyone connected to it. Still... I‚Äôm sorry for hiding all of that from you.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNow that sounds like a very Izuku thing to do.‚Äù Himiko replies after a few seconds. She is still hugging him, so things can‚Äôt be that bad. ‚ÄúI think I can say ‚Äòapologies accepted‚Äô for everyone here, yes?‚Äù 

They all agree, either vocally or through nods. Izuku‚Äôs heart burns. His friends are the best. And he is certain he doesn‚Äôt deserve them.

‚ÄúYeah, we kinda figured out that if you are hiding something from us it is probably for our sake.‚Äù Tenko adds. ‚ÄúYour alignment is pure good, Player Two. Throw some malice into it if you want to be a proper villain.‚Äù 

Izuku chuckles. 

‚ÄúYeah, sorry for that.‚Äù He takes a deeper breath. Time to unleash another bomb. ‚ÄúBut now my secrecy has brought a serious problem upon our heads. Namely, we took the newest holder of the One for All prisoner. All Might is probably livid right now.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThe‚Ä¶ wait, Lemillion?‚Äù Mindscrew asks the first. ‚ÄúOh shit, that punch.‚Äú He also connects the dots. 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Izuku replies and sighs loudly. ‚ÄúIt was probably transferred recently, as All Might still has his powers left. The strength amplification is all there, and Lemillion‚Äôs natural quirk, Permeation, was also re-awakened into a stronger form. Gran Torino, that elderly guy, also happens to be All Might‚Äôs old mentor and a former close friend of the hero that All Might got the quirk from.‚Äù Izuku decides that he isn‚Äôt going to half-ass his honesty. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know how to say that, but‚Ä¶ I did some digging after I heard of it, and I‚Äôm almost certain that it was your grandmother, Tenko.‚Äù 

Tenko simply stares. He is overwhelmed, but only briefly. 

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù He replies finally. ‚ÄúWell, I have never met her. So no hard feelings.‚Äù There is a tension and awkward silence after that. Izuku didn‚Äôt say that his father murdered his grandmother‚Ä¶ but it was heavily implied.

And true. 

‚ÄúDo you think Lemillion will let me make a baby with him?‚Äù Mei suddenly announces. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure I can make one that will hold against his strength, and‚Ä¶‚Äù She pauses and looks at them weirdly, as everyone other than her starts to laugh.

‚ÄúMei, never change.‚Äù Hitoshi is the first to regain the ability to speak. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre absolutely perfect when you are yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù Izuku smiles widely. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have to ask Lemillion himself. Just please wait until we‚Äôll all be in the room, I can‚Äôt wait to see his reaction.‚Äù Hatsume Mei stares at him in confusion. Her complete ignorance of social cues means that she fails to grasp what‚Äôs so funny to them. 

She was completely serious. She heard all that was said, but‚Ä¶ support items (and bloody vengeance over the Detnerat corporation, preferably through usage of her support items) are the only things on her mind. 

‚ÄúOkay, so any other shocking revelations?‚Äù Himiko asks. ‚ÄúWe already have a lot to think about.‚Äù 

‚ÄúActually, one more thing.‚Äù Izuku says and clears his throat. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about my quirk.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah, I was meaning to ask.‚Äù Mustard has mostly recovered from the earlier shock. ‚ÄúWhat is your quirk? You literally resurrected that grandpa and fixed yourself in like a second from obviously mortal wounds.‚Äù 

‚ÄúLevel 20 cleric of All Might.‚Äù Tenko mumbles. Izuku hears that and breaks out in laughter. It‚Äôs too ridiculously funny to not do that. He isn‚Äôt the only one to laugh, but none goes off as much as he does.

‚ÄúHoly shit, Tenko.‚Äù Izuku calms himself down. ‚ÄúOkay, back to the subject. The quirk I used‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt technically mine. It belonged to Overhaul.‚Äù Gasps, some shock, and faint ‚ÄòI knew it‚Äô on Himiko‚Äôs face. 

‚ÄúSo your dad gave it to you after you dealt with Overhaul?‚Äù Himiko asks. ‚ÄúI suspected it from the moment you told me about his quirk. Papagiri mentioned that your dad was involved in the Shie Hasseikai raid, so‚Ä¶ you were quirkless before that, yes?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes...n‚Äôt?‚Äù Now she stares at him questioningly. ‚ÄúFather took Overhaul‚Äôs quirk from him and gave it to me. I refused to take any from him earlier, because honestly, they are almost uniformly stolen. And from people I don‚Äôt even know, but in most cases were pretty nice. But Overhaul‚Ä¶ he was my catch, so to speak. And I knew that Overhaul deserved having his quirk taken.‚Äù He takes a deeper breath. It‚Äôs going to get wild. ‚ÄúOnly when he transferred it to me, it turned out that I already had a quirk. I was probably going to be a ‚Äònatural‚Äô late bloomer like Eclipse, but the quirk transfer awoke it earlier. And this second quirk was‚Ä¶ All for One.‚Äù 

Stunned silence. Even Mei registered the words and was shocked. 

‚ÄúOh my god.‚Äù Mindscrew speaks first. He is probably in equal terms amazed by what he just heard and terrified by the implications of what‚Äôs going to happen if that knowledge goes public. 

And perhaps by the implication of the number one quirk nerd having a quirk that lets him take quirks. 

‚ÄúHow many?‚Äù Tenko goes straight for the throat. 

‚ÄúErrr‚Ä¶ ten quirks at the moment?‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúBut I can only keep two active besides the All for One. Dad said it will get stronger with time and training. And that he could only keep one active when he was my age.‚Äù He decides to not mention how he, at some point in his life, played catch with his dad‚Ä¶ catch ‚Äòwith‚Äô quirks. Good training method. But rather an odd thing to describe. ‚ÄúBut only Overhaul is actually stolen. The rest I got by looking through palliative care wards and buying them from people. Nobody notices that some old and infirm people stop using their quirks, and I had a lot of money to pay their families, so‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúThis is how you survived the punch.‚Äù Himiko, of course, connects the dots first. 

‚ÄúWell, yeah.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúI used Survivor and Life Support. The former lets me scale down a lethal wound to nearly-lethal several times‚Ä¶ although the punch shaved off all charges from it. Life Support is a quirk that keeps me alive for as long as I do not suffer an instantly fatal wound. Then is the Overhaul and All for One, that I already mentioned. The remaining six quirks are Reflex Boost, Strength Amp, Night Vision, Notice-Me-Not, Slow-Mo, and Long Day.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI can figure out the first three easily.‚Äù Tenko comments. ‚ÄúThe rest?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNotice-Me-Not just makes me harder to spot and focus on.‚Äù Izuku explains. ‚ÄúBut it works best when I‚Äôm in a crowd or there is something else to gather attention near me. Pretty useless if I use it now. Slow-Mo makes me think way faster for up to ten seconds. So I see everything move slowly. But I‚Äôm not moving any faster than said everything, so it‚Äôs something to use to quickly conjure a plan when surprised by something. And Long Day‚Ä¶‚Äù That was going to get nasty. ‚Äú... lets me wake up fully rested after four hours of sleep.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI hate you and I‚Äôm sooo going to the police if you don‚Äôt give it to me.‚Äù Mindscrew‚Äôs reply is instant. Mustard and Himiko laugh. Tenko only grins. 

‚ÄúI thought about it, actually.‚Äù Izuku answers promptly and hurriedly. ‚ÄúBut without the All for One to save as a foundation, there is like a thirty percent chance that giving you a second quirk will turn you braindead. Is that a risk you‚Äôre willing to take?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI would if it was twenty percent.‚Äù Mindscrew replies and grins tiredly. More laughter in the room. ‚ÄúAlright, so this time I‚Äôll be the one to ask. Any more shocking revelations?‚Äù 

‚ÄúActually, maybe just one tiny little thing?‚Äù Izuku answers and Hitoshi gives him a death glare. ‚ÄúHellhound and the other beasts we used during the assault were made by an old co-worker of my father. Old, as in ‚Äòhe has a longevity quirk and is more than a century old‚Äô. Also he is a mad scientist to equal Overhaul.‚Äù Himiko stares at him with badly concealed anger. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôm my dad‚Äôs son, and he thinks that he died. But not before making me, a completely random kid, his successor and handing over his quirk. So I‚Äôm doing my best to limit his maniacal evilness while figuring out how to safely dismantle his petty empire, because if he goes renegade or I try to take him down and he survives, he might announce to the world that I‚Äôm my father‚Äôs successor and then we are all dead.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd those‚Ä¶ Noumus?‚Äù Mustard asks. 

‚ÄúAnimals bearing some weak quirk, given more by me and him, while also seriously revamped biologically by our resident Doctor Evil.‚Äù Izuku replies honestly. ‚ÄúHe thinks I‚Äôm stealing said quirks but I‚Äôm just getting them from dad. Or at least the second gen noumus are former animals.‚Äù Izuku takes a deep breath. ‚ÄúHe used humans before I took the business over. Being braindead and unfailingly obedient was apparently a feature rather than bug back then.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI want to stab him.‚Äù Himiko announces. Even Mei is horrified, probably due to comparing her babies with Doctor‚Äôs. She is a villainous scientist, technically (well, more like engineer) but an ethical one. More or less. At least when she doesn‚Äôt have one of her‚Ä¶ episodes. 

‚ÄúYes, Himi.‚Äù Izuku pets her head a bit. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you do that when the time is right, ok?‚Äù She nods and returns to hugging him as if she was afraid that he‚Äôll vanish somewhere if she lets him go. ‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ I think that‚Äôs all my secrets?‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo let me sum that up.‚Äù Mindscrew to the rescue. ‚ÄúYou are an heir to the shadow emperor of Japan who is so terrifying that people thought that he was an urban legend. A man who has pretty much beaten All Might to half-death. You also inherited his unfairly overpowered quirk AND eternal rivalry with All Might and his successor, which happens to be locked in our dungeon, although they aren‚Äôt aware that you have that quirk plus nine more. And if they or the world finds out, literally entire Japan will try to murder us?‚Äù Izuku nods. ‚ÄúOh and you have a working relationship with a mad scientist to end all mad scientists, but you look forward to backstabbing him because he reached a completely new level of animal abuse previously unheard of in this world. Did I miss something?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe part where Hellhound can switch between combat and deliciously pettable forms at will.‚Äù Himiko announces. ‚ÄúHe is their HOUSE DOG. And his mom DOESN‚ÄôT KNOW.‚Äù The stares moved from Izuku to her. So, of course, she gives them a wry smile and continues. ‚ÄúI think I mentioned on the chat how his dog would chew All Might if someone told him to, yes?‚Äù 

‚Äú... and I thought that my character backstory was messed up.‚Äù Tenko ends the stunned silence.

UA-Spy: Okay, so I listened to the recording. Then I listened to it again. And again. Then I deleted it, as you said.

UA-Spy: Holy. Shit. 

SmallMight: Yes. 

SmallMight: Welcome to my life.

SmallMIght: It‚Äôs beyond messed up.

UA-Spy: yes

SmallMight: How‚Äôs UA doing?

UA-Spy: The rat would probably marry you if you asked.

UA-Spy: I caught him S I N G I N G in his office. 

UA-Spy: He is that happy. And my ears are in undescribable pain.

SmallMight: Holy shit [also yuck I‚Äôm taken & not a furry] 

UA-Spy: x D

UA-Spy: You have won his war, pretty much. Sure, the Commission is still strong in funds and covert operatives, but your stunt in Hosu has pretty much murdered its public support. 

UA-Spy: Four million people signed a petition to rename it into the ‚ÄòVillain Public Safety Commission‚Äù. And it‚Äôs still getting signed. 

UA-Spy: A lot of people claimed that Dabi was talking shit, but then the two ‚Äòrejected‚Äô kids of Endeavor came forward, confirmed all that was said, and mysteriously vanished (they are now living within the UA grounds). Nedzu played that masterfully. 

UA-Spy: also Eraserhead got the youngest Todoroki to go to a quirk counseling and therapy 

UA-Spy: Even the Diet starts mentioning that some reforms are needed once the QLF is stopped - if they didn‚Äôt, they can forget about reelection even with Commission‚Äôs support.

UA-Spy: All Might, Sir Nighteye and Eraserhead are absolutely livid, though. 

SmallMight: I‚Äôm going to deal with them when I deal with the captives. 

UA-Spy: Sounds nasty?

SmallMight: nah

SmallMight: How‚Äôs Blueberry?

UA-Spy: Fighting on the frontline, I saw her in a recording from one of the cities.

UA-Spy: She‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt look super happy about what‚Äôs happening. 

SmallMight: Crap. Keep me updated. If she needs a lift out of the QLF, we‚Äôre ready to provide it.

SmallMight: I might even throw in a quirk if she wants to?

Sawa Takeo: did you know about the QLF attack?

Akatani Mikumo: I found out like five minutes before it happened

Akatani Mikumo: Had only enough time to hide in the basement and pull out a gasmask (I didn‚Äôt think that the QLF could make it a gas, but I knew that Chronostasis is oddly competent at times so I prepared for the worst case scenario

Sawa Takeo: so in this case, Big Boss told me to tell you that we are extremely grateful for your warning

Sawa Takeo: The Alliance avoided casualties in Hosu thanks to you

When Lemillion returns to the cell, his splints are gone, but he is able to walk normally. No sign of broken bones. And he had a lot of them.

‚ÄúYou alright, kid?‚Äù Gran Torino asks in a worried tone. Tenya stares from the back of the room. The second Ingenium seems to be powered mostly by spite and hatred towards Stain, and Gran Torino and Lemillion failed to fix it thus far. 

‚ÄúYes, sensei.‚Äù Lemillion replies before sitting down on the floor. ‚ÄúNo idea what they did to me, but my bones are fixed. They put me on the stretcher outside of the room, made me breathe in something that left me unconscious‚Ä¶ and I woke up able to walk.‚Äù Mirio shakes his head. He is genuinely confused. ‚ÄúOne of them, I think it was Mindscrew, told me to not overdo it, because if I move too much before they mend themselves properly, I‚Äôll break them again.‚Äù 

It sounds reasonable enough. The healing quirks are rare. Especially as Lemillion doesn‚Äôt appear exhausted, so whatever they did to him doesn‚Äôt work like the Recovery Girl‚Äôs quirk. What are the chances of League having access to someone more powerful than her? 

They are imprisoned for four days now, without news from the outside. Even their very captors didn‚Äôt appear particularly interested in them. One of them (big silent and cross-bearing type) splinted and bandaged Lemillion‚Äôs broken limbs. Two or three others are bringing them food. There is also someone nearby to lead them to the nearest toilet if they shout. 

Lemillion is still smiling. He agrees with Sir Nighteye. For as long as you maintain your spirits and are capable of joking and smiling, you aren‚Äôt broken. 

Even when your limbs are.

Gran Torino smacked his head when he said that aloud yesterday. 

The part where he is now a murderer is much harder to swallow. 

‚ÄúOi, kid.‚Äù Gran Torino spots it, of course. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make this face. It‚Äôs like you aren‚Äôt sure if you are smiling or not. It‚Äôs pissing me off. Just decide on one face and stick to it.‚Äù Lemillion smiles a bit more. ‚ÄúListen, if I were you, I‚Äôd punt that asshole right in the face too. Sometimes you get villains like that.‚Äù

None of them even consider Legion‚Äôs survival. Gran Torino didn‚Äôt see him, but Lemillion‚Äôs rushed description of events told him everything. You don‚Äôt survive such wounds without being right next to a fully staffed hospital. 

‚ÄúI killed a kid.‚Äù Lemillion replies quietly. ‚ÄúHe was, like what? 15 or 16 years old?‚Äù 

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù Ingenium mumbles in the corner. ‚ÄúHe deserved that.‚Äù 

Gran Torino can‚Äôt move like he used to with that damn quirk suppression collar. But he can still smack a student on his head when they deserve it. 

‚ÄúOuch!‚Äù Ingenium is startled. 

‚ÄúStop that, Tenya.‚Äù Gran Torino says with his best stern-teacher-you-just-pissed tone. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unbecoming of a hero. It would make your brother smack your head like I did. And you are disrespectful to Lemillion‚Äôs problems.‚Äù 

‚Äú... sorry.‚Äù Is all they get from Tenya. Gran Torino has a lot of work ahead of him. 

The door of their cell opens. It‚Äôs the lizardman. 

‚ÄúBoss wants to see you. All of you.‚Äù He says. Tenya tenses. Gran Torino and Lemillion exchange gazes. 

Stain. 

 

***

 

They all follow the lizardman through the hallway in whatever basement they are kept in, and then up the stairs. The League‚Äôs hideout is large, way larger than any of them expected it to be. It‚Äôs pretty much an apartment complex that was remodelled into a villain's lair. 

Gran Torino doesn‚Äôt say that, but he is reasonably impressed. 

Then he sees a bar. The warper is behind it, cleaning a glass. Dabi seems to be drinking something, flanked by the silent cross guy. Stain is next to the bar, his back on the wall and his hands crossed. 

The rest of the large room is a combination of couches, chairs and tables. There is a large TV hanging down from the ceiling. Gran Torino and Lemillion scan the room. They see whom they suppose to be the Decay (hard to say without the hands, but the hair colour fits) sitting on a chair with a game console. Then is the Mindscrew, his eyes on his phone. 

And, finally, two more members, watching some anime on the TV, cuddled together and eating snacks.

Lemillion almost trips when he recognizes one of them. 

‚ÄúHello there!‚Äù Legion, the leader of the League of Villains, and the man (kid?) that Lemillion killed, waves towards them cheerfully. The girl he assumes to be the Vampire smiles as well. ‚ÄúCome take a seat, we need to talk.‚Äù 

Lemillion almost shouts the question out loud. But he manages to push it back. Gran Torino and Tenya remained silent, but they were just as shocked as he was. 

They all sit next to each other on a couch next to the TV. Legion and Vampire sat in front of it, the captives to their left, and Mindscrew and Decay to their right. 

‚ÄúSorry for the arrangements.‚Äù Legion announces with a smile that actually feels genuine. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bit starved after the treatment. Touch-starved as well, apparently.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHow are you still alive?‚Äù Lemillion goes straight to the point. He is‚Ä¶ faintly relieved, to his own surprise. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm tougher than I look.‚Äù Legion replies. Lemillion is once again struck by how young the villain is. ‚ÄúApparently tough enough to get United States of Smashed and live to tell the tale.‚Äù 

Lemillion gasps faintly. Does he‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúYes, yes, I figured it out.‚Äù Legion replies promptly. ‚ÄúQuirks normally don‚Äôt have a time limit like All Might‚Äôs does, so I did some digging. Found some cases of people with or without other quirks suddenly developing particularly powerful strength enhancement and, in case of those with other quirks, getting their primary power re-awakened. So I made a theory that there is some form of a quirk that can get transferred between unrelated people‚Ä¶ and then I saw you applying Permeation to Endeavor and using a strength close to All Might‚Äôs, and things clicked.‚Äù Legion smiles widely. ‚ÄúYou are All Might‚Äôs successor!‚Äù 

‚ÄúHe is WHAT?‚Äù The announcement takes Stain off guard. His crew is only marginally less surprised. The Hero Killer actually makes three steps in their direction between Legion speaks again. 

‚ÄúStain.‚Äù The Hero Killer freezes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to kill him. I didn‚Äôt save his life and get someone to fix his limbs just to kill him now. So would you kindly return to brooding over there and let me do my job?‚Äù 

To the captives‚Äô shock, Stain obeys. They talked a lot about the League during the past four days, yet the scenario when Stain was actually working for Legion (rather than working along, being a co-head or even being the true boss) somehow didn‚Äôt occur to them.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember you saving my life.‚Äù Lemillion says immediately. His face is still reasonably cheerful, but there is a cold tint to his tone.

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù Legion replies, completely untouched by the hostility. ‚ÄúWe were all already out of Hosu when QLF detonated its chemical weapon and burned the city down. Eclipse arrived at the scene of our bout a few seconds after our escape and killed Endeavor. Also I regret to inform you, Iida, that Manual and his entire agency are on the casualties list of the Fall of Hosu.‚Äù 

Tenya stares in horror. Lemillion wants to not believe. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in any of that.‚Äù Gran Torino is frank. And painfully honest. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre free to.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúBut you should look at the kids' faces. Unlike you, they saw the missile being launched.‚Äù He does it. And there is shock on his face. The old hero starts to believe. ‚ÄúWhen my informant told me that the QLF was attacking the city and I saw the missile, I immediately had you all warped out of the city with us. I also regret to inform you that Hosu is the first of five cities and towns that the QLF destroyed in a similar way during the past few days. Eclipse is waging and winning a war against Japan right now.‚Äù 

There is silence. Tenya and Lemillion are scared about their families. They don‚Äôt know what cities were attacked and what the situation outside was. Gran Torino‚Äôs reaction is much more subdued. He is studying Legion, seeking to figure him out. 

Most of the League failed to do that in the last few years, until he came forward himself. Izuku wishes the old hero best of luck.

‚ÄúBefore we talk about your future, I‚Äôd like to ask you a question or two.‚Äù Legion finally interrupts the silence. ‚ÄúI want to find something out about All Might‚Äôs quirk.‚Äù
Notes:

    Mindscrew's reaction to Long Day is a big mood.

Chapter 15: Return
Summary:

    Lemillion, Ingenium and Gran Torino enjoy the League's hospitality.

    Also Gran Torino yells at All Might but c'mon, when does that NOT happen.

Chapter Text

‚ÄúAbsolutely no.‚Äù Gran Torino is adamant. ‚ÄúI have no idea what you want, but this secret isn‚Äôt something‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúEven if‚Ä¶‚Äù Legion smiles wryly. ‚ÄúI know a few things about it that may actually help Lemillion survive until his retirement?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI doubt that you learned anything about All Might‚Äôs quirk that even All Might himself didn‚Äôt.‚Äù Gran Torino remains adamant. 

‚ÄúGran Torino‚Ä¶‚Äù Legion chuckles. ‚ÄúHow many unrelated nine year old people managed to figure out that All Might got his quirk from Nana Shimura? And I have only got better since then.‚Äù  

Silence in the room. Lemillion didn‚Äôt even know that name until All Might mentioned it to him‚Ä¶ right after Gran Torino agreed to be his special teacher. 

‚ÄúHow about this?‚Äù The old hero finally makes a decision. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll answer your questions, if you answer mine.‚Äù 

‚ÄúVery well.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm game. What‚Äôs your question, old man?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat is your quirk?‚Äù Gran Torino asks. It makes sense, somewhat. Lemillion isn‚Äôt sure why it seems so important to his mentor, but getting some intel on Legion (whose quirk was still rather obscure) was going to be useful in taking him down. 

‚ÄúObject Alteration.‚Äù Legion replies. He doesn‚Äôt seem to have considered lying or not answering for even a second. ‚ÄúI can alter the state and shape of an object on touch. So I can conjure hands out of concrete by altering an area of the said concrete‚Ä¶ or disassemble a human being into very small bits, like I did with Thunderbolt. Additionally make some smaller changes, like I did when I broke Lemillion‚Äôs limbs, but it‚Äôs mentally complicated and taxing. I can reset the changes I made, even after a few days. I can fix wounds caused by someone else too, but only within fifteen minutes from when they were caused.‚Äù 

This sounded like a versatile and extremely potent power for someone who was willing to get close to their enemy. It also sounded like a wonderful quirk for a rescue hero. Legion could easily disassemble parts of the collapsed building, and then heal whoever was wounded for as long as he arrived quickly enough.

‚ÄúSo, my turn?‚Äù Legion asks while Gran Torino swallows the answer. ‚ÄúHow many past holders of this power did you manage to track?‚Äù 

‚ÄúBefore Nana?‚Äù Gran Torino answers. ‚ÄúOnly one. En. He was‚Ä¶ a rather secretive individual.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAh, I see.‚Äù Legion pauses. ‚ÄúYou suck in information gathering and analysis, you know? I found two of his predecessors.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù Gran Torino replies, his eyes widened. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll consider that to be your question for this round, and answer.‚Äù Legion replies calmly. ‚ÄúEn got the quirk from Daigoro Banjo, the Black Whip Hero. He, in turn, got it from Hikage Shinomori, pretty much a hermit who decided to spend his life in a forest, honing his quirk to give it to someone stronger. He was way more secretive than En, and I failed to find anyone in the line beyond him. Though I suspect that there were a lot more.  And now, my question. Is that quirk somehow connected to the Quirk Thief urban legend?‚Äù 

Something flinches on the old hero‚Äôs face. Lemillion has no idea what it is, but‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs strange. He might have known him for a scarce few days, but‚Ä¶ he acted unlike himself. 

‚ÄúWhy do you ask?‚Äù Gran Torino seems on edge. ‚ÄúAnd no, this isn‚Äôt one of those questions, just a clarification.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love quirks.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúThey are awesome. I lived for a few years as a quirkless. Everyone around me had those wonderful things‚Ä¶ so naturally I started to be interested in them even more. This quirk is one of the most fascinating things I have ever heard about. I grew to suspect that the Quirk Thief isn‚Äôt just an urban legend‚Ä¶ and after I started investigating All Might‚Äôs quirk, I found myself asking: what‚Äôs the chance that two quirk-transfering quirks, unique in the world as a whole, found themselves on the same island? Doesn‚Äôt it make much more sense if those two quirks were related? Perhaps one of them is a mutation from the other, so father and son?‚Äù Legion tilts his head a little. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, indulge my curiosity.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAccording to an old legend among those who know about that quirk, the first holder and the Quirk Thief were brothers.‚Äù Gran Torino replies finally. ‚ÄúOne a villain to end all villains, and the other the true hero. Now my question: what‚Äôs your actual agenda? You aren‚Äôt asking simply out of curiosity.‚Äù 

Was Gran Torino answering these questions‚Ä¶ because Legion mentioned something about prolonging Lemillion‚Äôs life? He already proved (more or less - they had to confirm his words) to know a lot more than the old hero suspected. So did his mentor begin to suspect that there is something behind these? 

And is willing to make things public (or semi-public) to test that? On the other hand, they are on Legion‚Äôs mercy either way. He can announce the truth to the world whenever he wants. 

‚ÄúWell, I WOULD ask simply out of curiosity if I had nothing more than that.‚Äù Legion replies with a thoughtful look on his face. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt believe just long I can mumble about a single interesting quirk, and that one is beyond interesting.‚Äù The Vampire, silent thus far, chuckles loudly. ‚ÄúBut you are right. I have an agenda. It‚Äôs about Hikage Shinomori. He received the quirk somewhere between his eighteenth and twentieth birthdays. He is the second longest holder I found, right after All Might. But he died of old age‚Ä¶ at the age of forty-six.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Gran Torino is surprised. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs that possible?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThere is more than that.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúI got his medical data. He was practically breaking into pieces before his death. Doctors were completely stupefied‚Ä¶ because they didn‚Äôt know that Hikage received a special quirk from someone. Ever heard of Quirk Singularity Theory?‚Äù Neither of them did, judging from the looks on their faces. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a theory according to which every subsequent generation is going to have stronger and stronger powers, due to both random mutations and inheritance‚Ä¶ until finally human bodies will collectively start failing to survive under strain, leading to extinction of Mankind. It‚Äôs a bit of a fringe belief currently‚Ä¶ but I believe that your quirk, Lemillion, is undergoing a similar scenario just on a microscale, and many times faster.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat about All Might?‚Äù Gran Torino leans forward a bit. ‚ÄúHe had that quirk for decades! There are no signs of such... ‚Äú 

‚ÄúLet me make an educated guess.‚Äù Legion interrupts him. ‚ÄúHe was quirkless before he got that quirk, wasn‚Äôt he?‚Äù 

Gran Torino freezes. Lemillion begins to realize what Legion is suggesting. 

‚ÄúI thought so.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúHis body had to deal with a single overpowered quirk, instead of a single overpowered quirk AND his natural one, re-awakened into a stronger form.‚Äù He sighs painfully and turns his head towards Lemillion. ‚ÄúI regret to inform you, Lemillion, but if you continue having that quirk, it will shorten your lifespan. I don‚Äôt know how much, as I lack data to guess it. I don‚Äôt know how many people owned it before Hikage, and I don‚Äôt have anything to compare it to. Twenty years, perhaps? Maybe a bit more, since you will now know what to look for and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll have proper healthcare instead of hiding in a forest almost until death like Hikage did.‚Äù He shakes his head. ‚ÄúIf you add your power to it, I honestly don‚Äôt think that you can have a non-quirkless successor.‚Äù 

Gran Torino looks shocked. Lemillion‚Ä¶ 

Lemillion makes a decision. 

‚ÄúI took my hero name to signify that I wish to save at least one million people during my lifetime.‚Äù He replies confidently. ‚ÄúIf I have less years to live, I‚Äôll simply have to try harder to make it in time.‚Äù 

Stain chuckles in the background. Something in his face looks proud. Lemillion doesn‚Äôt know what to think about it. Gran Torino is as amazed as he is proud. 

‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù Legion beams. Lemillion is even more confused - did he somehow forget that he is a captive of actual villains? How did things get so.. friendly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly the type of heroes we need if we want to clean up this country. Someone willing to risk their own lives for others, and considering saving people the reward in itself. It‚Äôs probably a bad moment, but I‚Äôm going to have to ask you for an autograph!‚Äù 

Lemillion didn‚Äôt expect the villain that captured him to ask for his autograph‚Ä¶ then again, unless Legion was lying to them ever since the start of the talk, it was nothing like what he imagined. 

Less capture and more like‚Ä¶ surprise quirk counselling? Although he was looking to go back home. And he really hoped that there was nothing bad in store for them before that happens. 

‚ÄúToo bad‚Ä¶‚Äù Iida suddenly speaks. ‚Äú... that you didn‚Äôt think the same thing about my brother.‚Äù His gaze is hateful and locked on Stain. 

Gran Torino is about to intervene, but Stain is first. 

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt kill your brother.‚Äù Hero Killer replies from his edge of the room. 

‚ÄúYou are lying.‚Äù Second Ingenium naturally doesn‚Äôt believe. In all honesty, neither does Lemillion. 

‚ÄúI tried to commit murder of the Number Two Hero in front of the cameras.‚Äù Stain replied calmly. ‚ÄúWhat would I get from denying responsibility for one of my earlier kills? Shorter sentence? I‚Äôm getting a lifetime in Tartarus, no matter what, if I‚Äôm caught.‚Äù Few seconds of silence. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôll say it again. I didn‚Äôt kill Ingenium. I didn‚Äôt have any of my helpers to kill him. The League of Villains didn‚Äôt kill him either. And if I saw him getting attacked during my hunts, I‚Äôd move in to save him. He was true hero, unlike most of the fakes I had to deal with in Hosu.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll add‚Ä¶‚Äù Legion intervenes. ‚Äú... that if you want evidence or to be pointed towards the true killers of your brother, you should ask your homeroom teacher. He and Nedzu know more about the case than they are willing to admit publicly. But I‚Äôll leave the explanation to them.‚Äù Tenya stares at him with a mix of hostility and questions. ‚ÄúIn the meantime, now that we‚Äôve finished our emergency quirk counseling session‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs time to talk about your future.‚Äù 

Lemillion hopes it‚Äôs going to be something‚Ä¶ like‚Ä¶ not horrifyingly bad? He had one terrifying reveal and he thinks that he had enough. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need hostages.‚Äù Legion announces. ‚ÄúAnd I can‚Äôt reasonably hope to recruit any of you. Blackmail would also ruin my newly achieved image of a noble freedom fighter. So would murder or maiming, by the way. So, the League‚Äôs plan for dealing with you is‚Ä¶ to keep you around for a day or two, and then warp you out next to UA or some other public place like that. The media say I‚Äôm dead and you were tortured or murdered by Mr. Edgy over there‚Ä¶‚Äù Stain growls slightly. ‚Äú... and I‚Äôm going to use you to prove that both claims were false. But to avoid worrying your mentors and perhaps families, I‚Äôm going to inform UA in advance of your status. Any questions?‚Äù 

They didn‚Äôt. It was a reasonable option‚Ä¶ if Legion was going to act on it. 

‚ÄúGreat.‚Äù Legion smiled widely. ‚ÄúAlso, I had Gremlin modify your prisoner collars so you can now go to the toilet and even here, to the bar slash living room, on your own. Nothing particularly secret there, and I don‚Äôt want anyone to claim I mistreated you.‚Äù 

This was certainly the weirdest kidnapping Lemillion ever heard about. 

 

***

 

Eraserhead is watching the news when the phone rings. He tears his eyes off the screen (Miruko and Gang Orca together with a lot of mutant quirk heroes have repelled QLF assault on some Tokyo ward, although casualties were pretty much equal on both sides) and sees that it is an unknown number. 

What now?

He picks it up. 

‚ÄúI know you didn‚Äôt expect to hear from me anymore.‚Äù An unfamiliar voice speaks. ‚ÄúBut the news about my demise were slightly exaggerated, Eraserhead.‚Äù Another unfamiliar voice says. 

Eraserhead‚Äôs eyes widen in shock. 

‚ÄúLegion?!‚Äù It was true. He didn‚Äôt expect to see or hear from the supervillain ever again. The wounds he saw on the TV were most certainly lethal. 

‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs me.‚Äù The supervillain replies. ‚ÄúSorry that it took me so long, but I was unconscious for the past four days. And nobody but me knew how to contact you. My mistake.‚Äù

Eraserhead doesn‚Äôt know if he is happy or not about Legion‚Äôs resurrection. Sure, the kid just dealt the greatest PR blow to the HPSC in history, but he was also a serious problem child to Aizawa. Worse than his actual students, somehow. 

‚ÄúWhat about your captives?‚Äù The hero asks calmly. That takes priority over everything else.

‚ÄúNo worries.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúGran Torino, Lemillion and the second coming of Ingenium are fine and are currently experiencing our hospitality in the super secret base of the League. And before you ask if I mean something nefarious by this, I‚Äôll inform you that Lemillion is currently beating Decay to super-death in a certain pre-quirk videogame.‚Äù Legion pauses, and Eraserhead begins to question his hearing. ‚ÄúHoly shit, that kid is brutal. He is making my best friend hemorrhage his souls and humanity like crazy and I love every second of it.‚Äù

Eraserhead has no idea what Legion means. But he is absolutely certain that Nedzu isn‚Äôt paying him enough to ask. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to warp them somewhere near UA in a day or two.‚Äù Legion continues. ‚ÄúSince I‚Äôm already a pain in the government‚Äôs ass, I can as well stick a needle in a painful place of all the newspapers and TV programmes that claim that I‚Äôm dead and so are two heroes and a hero school trainee! Tell Sir Nighteye and All Might that their secret love child and probably the most common monster in All Might‚Äôs nightmares will be back soon. And so will your student.‚Äù 

Eraserhead wants a coffee. Or a cat. The headache is going to get worse, he can feel that clearly. 

‚ÄúSecond Ingenium is moping in the corner a bit.‚Äù Legion adds after a few seconds and a click of a tongue. ‚ÄúStain told him that he didn‚Äôt kill his brother, without mentioning any secret stuff. I think he doesn‚Äôt want to taint Tenya Iida‚Äôs idealism with nasty things like this. I mentioned that if he wants to get an additional opinion about the killing, he should contact you. Don‚Äôt tell him about who did, because the last thing we want is him going for revenge again. But please DO mention that it wasn‚Äôt Stain, alright? I think he is actually kinda hurt by the accusations.‚Äù 

‚ÄúCounseling my students for me?‚Äù Eraserhead sighs. He doesn‚Äôt mention counseling serial killers, it‚Äôs really not his department. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you just make a false identity and get a job in the UA? You seem to have an awful lot of competence on the field.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know half of it.‚Äù Legion laughs. ‚ÄúAlso the friend in QLF likes Eclipse less and less.‚Äù Villain adds after a second or two. ‚ÄúHopefully this will lead us all somewhere? Well, I need to salvage what‚Äôs left of my best friend before he decays the controller in fury or something. See you later, Eraserhead.‚Äù

Eraserhead relayed Legion‚Äôs words to Nedzu, All Might and Sir Nighteye. They wanted to believe him. But they couldn‚Äôt. It was much more likely for it to be a copycat, or someone else from the League (now working for Stain, no doubt). 

The underground hero wasn‚Äôt even surprised when Tenya Iida, Mirio Togata and an old pro hero (who was cursing like a drunken sailor) appeared in the UA three days later. The police quickly rolled (vultures naturally followed), and detective Tsukauchi asked them questions about their captivity. 

Then they were all released. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, Gran Torino and Mirio Togata were rushed to the principal‚Äôs office. 

Eraserhead didn‚Äôt care.

He had a talk scheduled with a student of his about trying to take revenge‚Ä¶ and the death of his brother. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúWe have to make a SERIOUS talk, Toshinori.‚Äù Gran Torino glared at All Might, who visibly deflated even beyond his normal level of deflation. ‚ÄúRight now.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBefore that, I have a quick question.‚Äù Nedzu intervenes before Torino starts. They met a few times during their joint war against the All for One (and he DID technically work for Nedzu for a year, but the less is said about it the better), and he knows the risks. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about Legion.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Gran Torino replies. ‚ÄúHe is alive, and apparently made a full recovery somehow. Don‚Äôt ask me how, he didn‚Äôt confess stuff like that to me.‚Äù He growls slightly. ‚ÄúThrow all the personal analysis you made on him, Nedzu, through the window. He is leading the League, not Stain. Hell, I saw him pretty much telling Stain to shut up and let him talk, and Stain shut up as ordered.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh dear.‚Äù Nedzu is surprised. ‚ÄúHow did he manage to tame the Hero Killer?‚Äù 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask me.‚Äù Gran Torino replies with anger. ‚ÄúWhen he woke up after the healing, he let us cruise around a part of the hideout, but we didn‚Äôt see much and they were doing their best to make us not see anything potentially compromising. I can walk around quietly, so I did overhear a talk or two. But nothing I heard suggested that it was a setup or something. Stain is now Legion‚Äôs favoured blade, nothing more. Dabi and that geckoman actually referred to Legion as ‚Äòtheir boss‚Äô in private. And that‚Äôs not the fucking worst.‚Äù Gran Torino sighs loudly. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the worst then?‚Äù Sir Nighteye asks. 

‚ÄúThe absolute. Fucking. Humiliation.‚Äù Gran Torino exclaims. ‚ÄúHe knows about One for All, Mirai!‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, yeah.‚Äù All Might tries to reply. ‚ÄúHe figured out the time limit thing before the USJ and‚Ä¶‚Äù Gran Torino slams his hand on the desk and All Might almost jumps through the window in terror. 

‚ÄúNot that Toshinori!‚Äù Gran Torino is only getting more furious. ‚ÄúHe knows that your quirk is inheritable! He knows that you got it from Nana, and he knows that Mirio has it now!‚Äù Almost all eyes in the room widen in shock. ‚ÄúHe figured that your quirk is transferable when he was NINE FUCKING YEARS OLD! What‚Äôs the point of our secrecy when a kid figures it all out?! And now the entire League of Villains knows it too.‚Äù

Sir Nighteye is practically white. All Might is, in the meantime, getting only more and more terrified. 

‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs still not the worst.‚Äù Gran Torino continues his tirade. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve spent the majority of the last two days in a room changed into a shrine to former holders of the One for All, with Legion narrating to me all the things about this power that we missed over the years! And how he connected all the dots. That goddamn kid actually found the two holders before En!‚Äù 

‚ÄúHe did what?!‚Äù Sir Nighteye's shock is turning into‚Ä¶ something. Gran Torino doesn‚Äôt even know how to name the look on his face anymore. 

‚ÄúDaigoro Banjo, the Black Whip Hero.‚Äù Gran Torino replies. ‚ÄúAnd before him, Hikage Shinomori, some goddamn hermit living in the woods. And guess what? That‚Äôs still not the worst thing I have to say.‚Äù 

And then he describes the Legion‚Äôs hypothesis about the presence of previous quirks in One for All holders causing a strain on the body, resulting in Hikage Shinomori‚Äôs body practically breaking (in a literal meaning) and the hero dying of old age a few years before All Might‚Äôs current age. 

Gran Torino saw copies of Hikage Shinomori‚Äôs medical data. Legion had them. Of course he had them. And Gran Torino is enough of an investigator to recognize falsehoods. Those files didn‚Äôt appear false. 

‚ÄúMirio‚Ä¶‚Äù Sir Nighteye says when Gran Torino ends. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright.‚Äù Lemillion replies. ‚ÄúI told Legion that if I‚Äôm going to live shorter, then I‚Äôll just have to work harder to make up for my hero name. I know you weren‚Äôt aware of that. And‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôm just going to visit Recovery Girl regularly to confirm it AND be ready to hand the power to someone quirkless when the right time comes.‚Äù

Sir Nighteye is proud of his ward. He practically emanates it. 

‚ÄúGreat.‚Äù Gran Torino says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm moved. But this doesn‚Äôt change the fact that a sixteen years old kid is playing us around. Hell, he is playing half of Japan around!‚Äù 

‚ÄúI noticed.‚Äù Nedzu is bitter. ‚ÄúYou think he‚Äôll accept becoming a UA student under a false ID?‚Äù 

All Might vomits blood at the suggestion. 

‚ÄúThis is a bit... excessive, Nedzu.‚Äù Sir Nighteye tries to intervene and be the moderate voice in this discussion.

‚ÄúLook me in the eyes.‚Äù The rat replies. ‚ÄúAnd tell me that you wouldn‚Äôt want him as an intern in your agency.‚Äù Sir Nighteye remains silent. ‚ÄúSee? It‚Äôs not even about his powerful quirk or his quirk analysis and information gathering. None of this would have made Stain obey him and his former sidekicks switch their allegiances together with him. Stain wouldn‚Äôt accept anyone who wasn‚Äôt entirely dedicated to a personal creed and lacked charisma to back it up. The more I get to see Legion‚Äôs handiwork, the more I feel like I‚Äôm seeing significantly less malevolent All for One.‚Äù 

Nedzu shared their hatred towards the man. But also their deep respect for All for One‚Äôs strength and skills. Comparing someone to him not in the morals department was the rat‚Äôs highest form of praise. 

‚ÄúMore than that.‚Äù Gran Torino replies. And eyes turn towards him. ‚ÄúListen, I spent a lot of time seeing All for One‚Äôs goons. League is anything but similar to them. Fear? Malevolence? Threatening aura? Absolutely no. The Stain‚Äôs sidekicks aren‚Äôt fully integrated, but the old members? Bah! They act like a bunch of normal teenagers who like to hang out at the same place. You wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell that Legion is any way distinct from the rest, unless it‚Äôs time for the business. They play computer games or watch films together, Legion is cuddling with his girlfriend Vampire, they make jokes about what‚Äôs happening in the country, sometimes even make fun of Legion himself‚Ä¶ and then that green haired menace decides that he is going to kill Number Two Hero today, so everyone pulls out knives and villain outfits and goes to slay, burn and maim at his orders. Without thinking to question them. And he goes with them.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo a natural leader.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúRather than an authoritarian boss.‚Äù Gran Torino nods. 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù The hero adds. ‚ÄúForget about trying to drive a wedge between factions, provoke infighting or try to make someone defect. I observed them for two days, and I can attest that none of this is going to work. If anything, they‚Äôll probably see your attempts as a form of a joke and laugh about it while eating together and watching something on TV. But it doesn‚Äôt mean that the League is without weaknesses.‚Äù 

‚ÄòOh?‚Äù Nedzu and Sir Nighteye seem to be suddenly interested.

‚ÄúThe entire League hangs on Legion.‚Äù Gran Torino says. ‚ÄúWe spent four days in the cell after Lemillion knocked him out, because literally nobody knew what to do about us without Legion to tell them what‚Äôs the next step of his grand strategy. Stain apparently hounded around his bed almost constantly, and the rest was mostly moping around their rooms. If the League is a Solar System, then Legion is the Sun that‚Äôs keeping it all together and is a centerpiece of the entire structure. Take Legion out, and the League will vanish instantly.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it the same with the QLF or the MLA?‚Äù All Might tries to interject. Gran Torino seems like he is about to hit his old student again. 

‚ÄúNo. If you take out Eclipse or Re-Destro, you will deal their organizations a massive blow.‚Äù The old hero replies. ‚ÄúBut someone, even if much weaker, will take their place. Geten or Chronostasis will keep the organization afloat, albeit massively weakened. But if Midoriya Izuku is taken out, there is no one to do that. I don‚Äôt think that they even have any thugs and other things under them, literally the entire League is just a bunch of people with powerful quirks hanging out in the same building and wanting to change the society. Make Legion vanish, and the rest will scatter at once. You don‚Äôt even have to worry about someone organizing a rescue attempt. Legion is not only the center of gravity holding them all together, but also their only strategist and tactician. Few more can be trusted to command a strike team, especially Dabi and Mindscrew, but Legion is the only one capable of making sure that several such parties don‚Äôt mess up their coordination and everything happens on time.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds reasonable enough.‚Äù Nedzu admits. ‚ÄúAny other observations?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThey are good.‚Äù Gran Torino replies bitterly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not even the fact that Stain swept the floor with me, although this does hurt my pride a lot. They are one of the most all-rounded villain groups I know of. Transport? Kurogiri. Infiltration? Vampire. Support? Gremlin, and if what I saw around the base is any indication, she is damn good at the job. Although I didn‚Äôt get to see her. Going forward: Need to destroy or defeat someone in a loud and flashy way? Dabi and Decay, probably Mustard too with his gas quirk. Need to kill or incapacitate someone quietly and quickly? Spinner, Mindscrew or Stain. Zealot doesn‚Äôt seem to speak with anyone, but I assume he plays some role too. Looks like a heavy hitter, that‚Äôs for sure. And Legion‚Äôs quirk seems to allow him to fix wounds in certain situations. Most crews I know of are one tough guy with skills and a handful of extras. Even the large groups like QLF or MLA tend to lack the versatility the League has. But‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs another way of cracking it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDismantle it by bits.‚Äù Nedzu nods. ‚ÄúI thought about it too. Get Kurogiri, Vampire or Gremlin, and the League‚Äôs operations will be severely impacted. I‚Äôd prefer to start from the head, honestly. If I figured out the way Legion thinks, getting one of his friends out of the game will only make him angry. And he will probably find a way to take them back, and most likely a nasty one to everyone involved. Anything about the monsters?‚Äù

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt help you there.‚Äù Gran Torino replies. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see any. There is either another base, or they are borrowing them from somewhere. I did overhear someone refer to them as ‚Äònoumus‚Äô, and apparently one of the parties attacking Hosu had something that one of the villains referred to as ‚ÄòNear-High End‚Äô noumu. Whatever fought All Might as the USJ was probably a ‚ÄòHigh End‚Äô, going by the nomenclature. Unfortunately, while Legion was ready to go on for hours about All Might, Nana and other One for All holders, he wasn‚Äôt even nearly as talkative on the issue of his pet beasts.‚Äù Nedzu nods. This was to be expected.

‚ÄúFinancing?‚Äù

‚ÄúListen, I saw a lot of villain bases, alright?‚Äù Gran Torino is visibly tired by the questioning, but decides to push through. ‚ÄúThat one looked like an entire apartment block internally rebuilt to suit their needs. It had to cost a lot. I also don‚Äôt hear about the League doing any sort of illegal business, save for their high profile attacks. That means spending money, not earning. Kurogiri has a literal goddamn bar in their base with a really nice selection of alcohol. Decay and the kids are drowning in video games and other stuff. Legion has a whole room full of limited edition hero merch, some stuff looking like he robbed them from a museum. Gremlin is‚Ä¶ honestly, I don't know what that weirdo does, but they have more support stuff on them and around them than I ever saw aside from I-Island. They are drowning in money, and I have absolutely no clue where they are getting it from. They didn‚Äôt even feel like they considered running out of money an option. Which is really odd, most of them have an air, mannerisms and habits of people that were used to not having money at all. I don‚Äôt get how all of that works. Are you sure they didn‚Äôt swipe Endeavor‚Äôs credit card somewhere along the way? Or that All Might‚Äôs old crush didn‚Äôt leave them a fortune?‚Äù 

‚ÄúShe wasn‚Äôt my crush!‚Äù All Might has a suicidal streak today. 

‚ÄúOh come on, Toshinori.‚Äù Gran Torino has something sadistic in his smile. ‚ÄúI still remember how you always asked me about Mischief‚Äôs newest heist. You had no idea what was happening in the country during your stay in America, but you always had to ask about her! It was that skintight catsuit, wasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù 

‚ÄúStop that!‚Äù All Might can feel his authority in front of his successor dropping by the second. 

Nedzu sighs quietly. 

It isn‚Äôt the time for his newest theory.

Chapter Text

Midoriya Izuku might have decided to be honest with his friends and co-workers, yes. He might have even admitted that he has a spy on the UA in front of Stain‚Äôs party, yes. It wasn‚Äôt exactly a surprise for them, considering the fact that he was active on the chat when Legion was unconscious (and thought to be dead). There was no point in secrecy anymore.

But he still made it clear that the spy reports to him and him only. Knowing that he knows what Nedzu and his sidekicks talk about in his very own office was a bit too dangerous. Knowledge of a spy is one thing, knowledge of what exactly he tells them is an entirely different problem. So, Izuku said that this is staying private - and the League agreed.

 

UA-Spy: Gran Torino had a talk with Nedzu, Nighteye and All Might about the League. 

UA-Spy: Had some interesting observations

UA-Spy: check it out

 

Midoriya Izuku does just that.

 

SmallMight: Most of that is a confirmation of what I already know tbh

SmallMight: It‚Äôs not like I can clone myself 

SmallMight: there is no school for villainous masterminds out there, and I can‚Äôt just find a kid like that and have me or my parents adopt him or smth

UA-Spy: you sure your dad doesn‚Äôt have a cloning quirk?

SmallMight: lol

SmallMight: if he did, I would have at least seventeen sisters

UA-Spy: xD

SmallMight: He absolutely adores her and he would certainly went for an option to have more of her

UA-Spy: I can scarcely imagine the Quirk Thief to be a family man

SmallMight: you wouldn‚Äôt be able to imagine it at all if you saw him at work

SmallMight: part of me still suspects it‚Äôs brain damage from All Might‚Äôs punch xD

SmallMight: I‚Äôm actually going to visit them tonight.

SmallMight: Officially I‚Äôm still recovering. Mom probably cried herself dry ;_; but I really had to figure out the mess caused by my official absence

UA-Spy: yeah you might want to hear this part of the talk in the Nedzu‚Äôs office then

 

Midoriya Izuku does just that. 

 

SmallMight: OH MY FUCKING GOD

SmallMight: ALL MIGHT HAD A FANBOY CRUSH ON MY MOM 

UA-Spy: I knew you‚Äôd love it xD

SmallMight: I‚Äôm going to tell that to my parents 

SmallMight: this is going to be hilarious

SmallMight: you are the best spy in history, friend

UA-Spy: doing my humble best ;v 

UA-Spy: gtg, Vlad‚Äôs starting his homeroom

UA-Spy: one more day of ‚Äòwhy can‚Äôt you beat the 1-A‚Äô ugh

SmallMight: k, good luck surviving that xD

 

***

 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going too.‚Äù Himiko announces when Izuku mentions that he is going to visit his parents. Legion is‚Ä¶ surprised. Then again, she stuck close to him ever since he woke up, so‚Ä¶ he barely managed to get her off him when he was going to sleep last night.

‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù Izuku decides to voice his surprise. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not letting you out of my sight for more than twenty minutes until I‚Äôm reasonably certain that you aren‚Äôt going to do something stupid without me.‚Äù Himiko replies promptly. The look on her face is one of confidence. ‚ÄúYou had Kurogiri warp out everyone but you and Stain before confronting the heroes, and then told him to evacuate everyone else from the city instead of sending help to you! You are a dummy, and I‚Äôm going to have to beat some sense into you.‚Äù 

‚ÄúErrr, Himi?‚Äù Izuku feels slightly insulted and decides to respond. ‚ÄúI did that because then you would all be in the base, ready to get warped to my position. You were just in reserve!‚Äù 

‚ÄúIzu.‚Äù She leans towards him, confidence replaced with slight irritation. ‚ÄúYou do realize we could be in reserve but, like, NEXT TO YOU? Instead of one warp away, in another city entirely?‚Äù 

‚ÄúUhm‚Ä¶‚Äù He tries to muster a response, but Himiko was yet to finish verbally beating her boyfriend. 

‚ÄúYou had us warped out AND had to confront a mini-All Might on your own because you are a self-sacrificial and way too kind dummy, who didn‚Äôt want to lose anyone. So you ended up having literally everyone but yourself and Stain evacuated from the battlefield way too early.‚Äù Himiko had several days to prepare for this lecture. ‚ÄúAnd you almost DIED over it. So until I‚Äôm reasonably certain that if heroes find this place you won‚Äôt have us all warped only to fight them all alone like a self-sacrificial dummy you are, I‚Äôm staying next to you. And Papagiri agrees with me, so you can forget about him warping me away from you unless I say yes. Got it?‚Äù 

‚Äú... yes, Himi.‚Äù It was on this day that Midoriya Izuku understood that women were scary. How exactly he didn‚Äôt notice it earlier despite seeing Midoriya Inko smack a two centuries old criminal mastermind and probably the most evil man in history of Japan with a newspaper (and it wasn‚Äôt the first time), was a mystery to everyone involved.

‚ÄúGood!‚Äù She gives him a bright smile and he relaxes a bit. Just a bit. 

 

***

 

His mom almost drowns him in tears right after they arrive. Her hugs are weapon‚Äôs grade too, of course. Izuku expected nothing less. 

Hisashi Midoriya is much more reserved. He is proud, that much is obvious - his son has cornered a Number Two Hero and joined the exclusive group of people who received a United States of Smash and survived to tell the tale (and also managed to NOT get caught in the process). 

He thought about getting them matching T-Shirts over that (it sounded like a family thing to do, yes?), but decided to not aggravate his wife anymore. Not the right time for that. 

Eri, in the meantime, doesn‚Äôt care. Her brother‚Äôs finally back, and he brought his friend too! That‚Äôs all that matters. She spends half an hour on his lap, talking with him about all the things that happened in the past few days (she also shows him her newest drawing and he likes it!). Eventually she notices the signs that Adult Talk is about to happen, so she vanishes into her room. 

Besides, her favorite anime is about to start! And her brother‚Äôs friend said that she would watch it with her! 

 

***

 

‚ÄúSon.‚Äù Hisashi says officially once Eri and Himiko out of an earshot. ‚ÄúI wish to tell you that I‚Äôm extremely proud of what you have achieved. You‚Äôve humiliated Endeavor and dealt more damage to the Hero Commission‚Äôs public image than I ever did!‚Äù All for One laughs. A bit. The cheerfulness manages to reach his eyes too. 

He gets to feel what seems to be Inko‚Äôs elbow. Driven into his side. He quickly shifts the subject. 

‚ÄúBut it was still extremely reckless, and you should take better care of yourself.‚Äù Hisashi knows when to fold. Besides, he knows his son enough to realize that this isn‚Äôt going to change anything. He inherited his father‚Äôs stubbornness. ‚ÄúYour mother actually fainted when you emerged from the smoke, you know that?‚Äù 

‚ÄúSorry‚Ä¶‚Äù Izuku does his best to look apologetic. ‚ÄúLemillion and Gran Torino were on a train that was going through the city when the attack started, I didn't expect them to show up. I had a plan, but‚Ä¶ it didn‚Äôt survive contact with the enemy.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat old fart has a tendency to show up when you least expect it.‚Äù All for One replies. ‚ÄúBeen there, done that. I laughed when he did all that jumping around Stain, only for the Hero Killer to effortlessly grab his leg and slam him into the building! One of the most satisfying sights I experienced in my life. You have an eye for talented people, Izuku.‚Äù

That was the quality they both shared. What made Hisashi continuously surprised was that Izuku was almost as good as him on that field despite having two centuries less of experience.  Did the longevity quirk made Hisashi stop accumulating certain skills? Or perhaps All for One - being the platform for other things to latch to - could also carry on skills or character traits, making Izuku inherit them too? 

So many fascinating questions. He probably won‚Äôt find out until Izuku has his own children and one of them inherits the family quirk. Hisashi doesn‚Äôt mention it, but part of him looks forward to having grandchildren. And for more reasons than just quirk-related curiosity. 

Only Izuku can reasonably provide them. His girlfriend stabbed one of the best underground heroes in the country during her first villainous outing, earning her good graces in Hisashi‚Äôs book. And they do look happy together.

Eri, in the meantime, is too pure and precious. Hisashi doesn‚Äôt think there is anyone in Japan who could reasonably measure up to her and her father‚Äôs expectations in that field. 

‚ÄúI learned from the best.‚Äù Izuku replies sheepishly. Two and (almost) a half century old heart warms up a bit. 

‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs probably not the best moment to mention it.‚Äù Inko decides to make an announcement. ‚ÄúBut me and you dad decided that Eri should meet some other people. So we‚Äôve got her enrolled in a school as Shigaraki Eri.‚Äù 

Izuku recognizes his dad‚Äôs old surname. One that only Midoriyas know about. 

‚ÄúDoes she‚Ä¶‚Äù He asks. 

‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù His mom replies. ‚ÄúWe were planning to tell her two days ago, but‚Ä¶ then the QLF situation started and we‚Äôve decided to wait for you.‚Äù Inko pauses for a second or two, before continuing. ‚ÄúHisashi falsified her school records, so she‚Äôs officially transfering from another school. We‚Äôve also decided that making her a child of someone as wealthy as your dad would just make her a potential outsider and a target for kidnapping, so she‚Äôs officially from a much more modest family. But the school is in a secure place, with a lot of heroes around, so it should be alright. But‚Ä¶‚Äù She looks at her husband, who promptly takes the talk over. 

‚Äú... well, first of all, we‚Äôll have to borrow Kurogiri to help with the logistics.‚Äù Hisashi says. ‚ÄúNot enough to seriously interfere with League‚Äôs operations, and if you‚Äôll be launching another attack, we can figure out an explanation for Eri‚Äôs absence in school. Second of all‚Ä¶ her quirk didn‚Äôt act out in a while, but we can‚Äôt risk it. Taking her quirk is going too far, so I‚Äôd like to officially ask the League‚Äôs engineer to provide some‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶ cute looking accessory doubling as a quirk suppressor.‚Äù He could barely mutter the word ‚Äòcute‚Äô. Even after so much time. Izuku finds that adorable.

‚ÄúGremlin will be overjoyed to help.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúWhat else? Because there is something else, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, there is.‚Äù Hisashi knows this might turn out to be a problem. But there is no other option. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be frank with you, son. If someone endangers Eri, I‚Äôm throwing our agreement through the window. I‚Äôll do my utmost to remain unrecognized, yes. If it fails, I‚Äôll do my best to make our ties remain a secret, to not endanger you and the League of Villains. But if there will be no other option‚Ä¶‚Äù He pauses and lets the unspoken words float around them. 

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù Izuku wants to give his sister a chance for more friends. But not at all costs. ‚ÄúPromise me one thing, though. Kill only when she is an actual danger. And All Might being within ten square miles of her last known position is not a sign that you can now murder him in front of cameras or something.‚Äù 

Hisashi is slightly insulted. He isn‚Äôt planning to fight All Might anymore! He actually enjoys seeing his nemesis beat up villains on the TV. Because he knows that each fight gets him closer and closer to turning back into quirklessness. 

He might pop up in the hospital right before All Might dies of old age. He can see that scene in his mind. Yagi Toshinori thinking he can now pass away contently, having avenged his mentor and saved Japan‚Ä¶ only to see All for One (back to full strength) through a window or even in his room. Too late to change anything, but just in time to die in mental and emotional anguish. 

Seeing Endeavor broken under the Dabi‚Äôs words gave All for One some‚Ä¶ fresh outlook on the concept of revenge. And he has time. All the time in the world.

‚ÄúI see no problem with that.‚Äù All for One replies. ‚ÄúI have way too much fun seeing him squirm under you to fight him! First you bring him to his knees in the USJ, then you kidnap his mentor AND his chosen successor and‚Ä¶ what did you do to him in captivity?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWe played video games together. I also gave him emergency quirk counseling.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúYou told me about the earlier holders, so I mentioned the double-quirk-strain thing to Lemillion and listed two more past holders than All Might and Sir Nighteye managed to find. And mentioned how I figured this all out when I was nine years old.‚Äù Hisashi is confused. Izuku laughs. ‚ÄúGran Torino almost threw All Might and Sir Nighteye through the window of Nedzu‚Äôs office for hiding things so well that a nine years old kid figured out more than they ever did! It was hilarious.‚Äù  

All for One can imagine the scene. Against himself, he laughs. When he started teaching his son to be his successor, he sincerely hoped that he would embrace the true villainy like his father did. Izuku quickly proved him wrong‚Ä¶ but if Hisashi was to be honest with himself, there was something wildly entertaining in watching Legion play All Might and his infuriating extras like that. 

He is also proud. 

Izuku is sixteen (well, close to seventeen now) years old. Lemillion - that tintinesque copy of Toshinori - was way more powerful when it comes to combat, AND was personally trained by Nighteye. No slouch in the brains department, unlike All Might. Despite that, his son kidnapped him AND that damn Gran Torino and then let them go, just to publicly shame them. 

Even without trying to steal One for All, it is an achievement. All for One is lucid enough to be aware that he himself would have struggled to achieve it (Gran Torino was notoriously paranoid and sneaky). 

Then he notices something.

‚ÄúWait, how do you know what happened in Nedzu‚Äôs office?‚Äù Izuku‚Äôs face is so perfectly innocent that it screams the word guilty. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDid you know that when Nedzu is particularly happy, he hides in his offices and sings?‚Äù Izuku replies with the face of an angel. ‚ÄúRussian shanties, oddly enough. I have a recording of him doing that after he heard of the petition to rename the Hero Commission into Villain Commission. Really painful to listen to.‚Äù 

Hisashi Midoriya stares at his son, and for the first time in a while he doesn‚Äôt know what to say. His son ‚Ä¶ infiltrated the UA?! Deeply enough to wiretap the rat‚Äôs office?! If All for One managed to do it, All Might would have never managed to corner him. 

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù He wants to know. He needs to know. 

‚ÄúErrr‚Ä¶‚Äù Izuku gathers his thoughts for an answer. ‚ÄúOne of the League‚Äô members with an appropriate quirk just‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶ joined the UA as a student? All I did was to help him train said quirk AND clean up his police records.‚Äù

It was beautifully simple, if slightly time consuming and reliant on having someone with appropriate quirk while being of an appropriate age. And necessary acting skills. But he was the man who could just give someone the right quirk! Why didn‚Äôt he even think about doing it like that for years? He tried planting bought heroes as teachers, he tried to make villains infiltrate it and plant surveillance items, but‚Ä¶ 

He isn‚Äôt going to admit it. But when he originally told Izuku that he supports his different outlook on villainy because the new times require a new perspective, he lied. He expected his son to fail at some point, or the heroes to push him into committing more and more ‚Äònecessary evils‚Äô to survive, until he would finally come around to All for One‚Äôs teachings. 

But instead Izuku has begun to achieve things that his father dreamt of‚Ä¶ in ways that just never occurred to him as possible. 

His family would never know. But it was on that day that All for One had actually decided to retire. Until that very talk he considered this a temporary leave. Something to stave his perpetual boredom (the fact that he genuinely enjoyed the family life helped greatly) before returning to his role as the shadow emperor, preferably with his son at his side. Rebuilding it all from the scratch would have been an interesting change of pace. But now? 

Now he realized that he actually was too old for the job. And that he was right when he said that it was time for a new generation with a different outlook on things to take over. 

His son might not be an emperor of the underworld and king of all villains, controlling everything from the shadows. He, in fact, seems to be thriving on chaos, mischief and public stunts (albeit ones that have heroes dying). But a villain is a villain. That‚Äôs good enough for All for One. He couldn‚Äôt tolerate his son becoming a hero (he is ok with his daughter becoming one, he can‚Äôt picture himself saying no to her), but if he wants to save people as a villain, then Hisashi is reasonably alright with it. 

‚ÄúOh, and here comes the funniest thing I ever heard.‚Äù Izuku is unaware of his father‚Äôs internal revolution. ‚ÄúAll Might‚Ä¶ wait for it‚Ä¶ had a crush on mom when she was Mischief!‚Äù 

‚ÄúCome again?‚Äù Hisashi thinks that he misheard. His wife just stares at her son in shock. 

‚ÄúGran Torino teased him over it.‚Äù Izuku says with a wry smile. ‚ÄúApparently when he was in the US, he was super focused on his work there and wasn‚Äôt really up-to-date with events in Japan. But he always asked Gran about Mischief‚Äôs newest heist. Gran talked about it in one of the recordings.‚Äù Izuku laughs. ‚ÄúSaid it was all about that skintight catsuit.‚Äù 

The family joins the laughter. Somewhere in Japan, a hero suddenly vomits blood.

Himiko Toga agrees with the Midoriyas about the absolute preciousness of Eri. She can scarcely believe that the girl that went through things as horrible as she did can still smile so brightly and innocently. It‚Äôs as if she wanted to make the world a better place, one uplifted heart at a time, to make up for what happened to her.=

She is almost too bright for a hardened villain like Himiko. She is an A-Rank villain after the Commission figured out that she can transform into people and act well enough to fool a veteran hero like Endeavor. Despite that, she is now smiling brightly while a little girl prances around her. Telling her in secret that she wants to be a hero when she grows up to save people like her brother saved her. Showing her all the things about her room. Letting her pet her dog (it was weird, she still remembered him fighting All Might almost to a standstill). 

Himiko begins to suspect that Midoriyas keep Eri blissfully unaware of their villainous activities because then she would ask them to stop being villains and they would have absolutely no other option than to agree. That was some nuclear weapons-grade adorableness. Is being cute a quirk? That would explain a lot. 

Eventually they rejoin the rest of the Midoriya family, and spend a very nice evening together. Inko is already treating Himiko as pretty much a part of the family. The young villainess has bad memories associated with the term family, but she thinks that it‚Äôs time to change that.

Izuku and Hisashi‚Äôs joint attempts to hide embarrassing photos from the house turn out to be for naught. Inko is a master thief, close to the level of Mr. Compress. They didn‚Äôt even notice the missing books. 

Seeing Izuku blush furiously when his own mother outmaneuvered him made Himiko laugh on the inside. Growing with an entire family composed mostly of scheming supervillains had to be an interesting experience. 

She is supposed to spend the night in the guestroom again. But when Izuku‚Äôs parents vanish from the sight, she ends up in his room. They cuddle together, talking about a lot of things. She is still shaken from seeing him on the edge of death. Twice, pretty much - the second time was when she returned with the collars from Mei, to see him fixed‚Ä¶ but unconscious on the couch. For a second she thought that he was dead. 

Seeing him. Touching him. Hearing his voice. She said a lot of smart things to him when she was explaining why she was following him like that, but at least partially it was because she needed a constant reminder that he was still there. 

Izuku was all about keeping up an image and was adorable in his drive to be the best villain mastermind that he can be (he would be a wonderful hero if he applied the same drive to that). But he was just as shaken by his brush with death as she was. When they were alone, he stopped acting. They talked about a lot of things.

She never made it to the guest room that night. She sneaked there in the morning. His parents didn‚Äôt say a thing, but she saw enough wry smiles that morning to know that they knew.

Satan 2: I wish to announce that I survived.

DoctorEvil: Good. Overhaul‚Äôs quirk?

Satan 2: Yes. Just in time.

Satan 2: I‚Äôm starting to understand how Sensei lost to All Might if even a kid like Lemillion can pack this much of a punch.

DoctorEvil: He didn‚Äôt lose. 

Satan 2: Sensei died. All Might survived with grizzly wounds. All things considered it was an almost pyrrhic victory of All Might, but a victory nonetheless.

DoctorEvil: I dare to disagree, but whatever suits your ideology.

Satan 2: You are unusually negative today, good doctor. 

DoctorEvil: You had One for All holder captive, and you let him out?

DoctorEvil: Disgrace.

Satan 2: Yes, I did let him out.

Satan 2: Because: 

Satan 2: 1. I had no guarantee that I could overpower him and steal his quirk. 

Satan 2: Sensei tried that with En alone twice, and it didn‚Äôt work. Do you think I‚Äôm His equal?

Satan 2: 2. If I killed him, All Might and Nighteye would have made destroying me their life‚Äôs work, and League isn‚Äôt ready for that. They take me for a friendly type of villain that can be an asset to UA.

Satan 2: 3. By letting him out I make them think I‚Äôm trustworthy and I‚Äôll be in a position to backstab them well enough WHEN I‚ÄôM ACTUALLY READY FOR IT. 

Satan 2: Do you have a hidden army of noumus capable of overpowering All Might when he actually finds out headquarters? If not, then please stop being passive aggressive (or downright aggressive) and cooperate. 

Satan 2: How are the noumus doing btw.?

DoctorEvil: Finished their maintenance three days ago. We didn‚Äôt lose even a single one and we‚Äôve gained a lot of valuable combat data for their further fine-tuning.

Satan 2: See? We‚Äôre playing a long game.

PurgeTheFakes: What do you normally do between murdering high profile heroes?

PurgeTheFakes: Fakes out there and I‚Äôm here, wasting time.

    Whether sex was involved or whether it was just cuddling is something that will be answered later in the story :P

    Also Nedzu's little hobby is based on an old acquaintance of mine (damn, it's like a decade ago) who kept singing russian shanties through the teamspeak while we were playing Minecraft together. That was... ugh, traumatic. And he was doing that sober, to top it all.

Chapter Text

Creature Rejection Clan was a hate group that started growing in numbers relatively recently, although it existed for a long time. It saw the mutation quirks (especially the complex ones, so Miruko‚Äôs more than Ingenium‚Äôs) as intrinsically evil and dangerous and impure yadda yadda yadda. In Izuku‚Äôs opinion you could copy paste a manifesto of any past hate group and just exchange whatever they hated with complex mutation quirks and it would summarize CRC up pretty well. 

A bit of a cruel irony, but the CRC was right from a biological point of view, at least once Purity took over. Earlier CRC hated everyone diverging from pure human form, but post-Purity they only had an issue with complex mutations. So people like Miruko, Gang Orca, Spinner or that frog girl from the USJ attack. Those mutations worked significantly differently than normal quirks (even normal mutant quirks, like Ingenium‚Äôs), typically offering a wider array of abilities. They were also absolutely dominant in terms of genetics. 

Speaking about it in a more simple terms, Miruko‚Äôs children would be rabbit people just like her. And so her grandchildren. And grand-grandchildren. Regardless of who their ‚Äòother‚Äô parents were. Complex mutant quirks typically overrode other quirks entirely when it came to inheritance. 

As a result, if Miruko and her descendants were allowed to exist, then in a few centuries there was going to be a significant group of rabbit-people living in Japan. Potentially making ‚Äòstandard‚Äô humans into merely one of subspecies of generalized Mankind. So yes - from the biological point of view, the existence of such quirks was a danger to humanity as it was understood presently.

Unfortunately for the CRC, Midoriya Izuku, League of Villains and most normal people in Japan didn‚Äôt consider having rabbit, frog, orca or lizard-people in the society as a problem. At least until they joined the mirror opposite of the CRC, the Inhuman Supremacy Party. Because, honestly, then they became assholes just like those that discriminated against them.

Stain wanted to charge in and simply slaughter everyone inside, but Izuku advised caution. Izuku turned out to be right. The small hideout of the Creature Rejection Clan was not as small as they originally suspected. 

Japan as a whole was still blissfully unaware of the exact workings of Vampire‚Äôs quirk. It was a child‚Äôs play for the Mindscrew and Himiko to tag a CRC member, mug him in an alleyway and, when he was unconscious, for Himiko to drink some of his blood. Wearing him as a disguise she sneaked into the hideout and then returned with a report. 

They expected 20-30 CRC‚Äô members and two turncoat heroes. They got about 150 CRC members, no less than six turncoat heroes and some torture dungeon slash experimentation lab. Plus Purge, one of the Purity‚Äôs main lieutenants. 

Stain‚Äôs interest in randomly charging and murdering people has cooled down after it, replaced with an interest in creating a plan on how to charge and murder people while being smart about it. 

‚ÄúOkay, so a quick question before we start.‚Äù Izuku announced right before they started strategizing. Everyone was gathered around the 3D model of the building printed by Gremlin and used as a map. ‚ÄúIs there anyone here who is yet to kill someone?‚Äù 

Silence. Good. They are prepared. 

‚ÄúWhy do you ask?‚Äù Mindscrew gets curious. 

‚ÄúBecause I have a very short patience when it comes to hate groups.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúPlus we did so many semi-bloodless raids that I really think we should make it bloody for once. Just to show the world that we are villains, not vigilantes. We might be following a set of rules‚Ä¶ but we should still be feared.‚Äù He made a decision after the night when Himiko mysteriously forgot where she was supposed to sleep.  

He wanted to be a villain. A great villain. He respected vigilantes - the good ones were even cooler than the underground heroes. And he wasn‚Äôt going to attack random people. But unredeemable villains? Yeah, that was a different situation altogether. 

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ we go in and kill something like one hundred fifty people?‚Äù Mustard asks for clarification. He doesn‚Äôt seem to believe in what he heard. 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Izuku replies calmly. Stares intensify. ‚ÄúWell, unless they manage to escape. You are free to spare those that flee.‚Äù 

Stain laughs menacingly.

The CRC was a group with religious trappings. Izuku, personally, had no idea why that happened. The surface level of their base had a large hall resembling a church. Many, many pews. Candles. Altar for some crazed preacher to mumble about how all inhumans were evil. They had gatherings once or twice a day. 

Zealot appeared to be religious. Some variant of Christian, most likely. And had an issue with CRC. Izuku asked him what religion the CRC‚Äô stems from, to which the man replied that he thinks that CRC‚Äô themselves don't know the answer to that question. Which was most likely a correct answer. Hate groups like them weren‚Äôt really into studying their actual history.

Himiko stalked the building earlier, getting the coordinate readings for various locations throughout the complex for Kurogiri to easily warp to and from. She noted down the approximate combat strength of the villains (trashy, to say the least, but numbers were a form of power too). 

The turncoat heroes and one or two heavyhitters of the CRC tended to spend time on the second level of the building, where Purge had his office. There was an underground section, divided between the barracks and the prison. The former was garrisoned by something like twenty cultists on the level of proficient thuggery, armed with a variety of weapons (mostly melee things). 

With all CRC members typically wearing various forms of body-covering robes, sneaking in was a child‚Äôs play once you had someone spend two or three days in. Besides, Legion, Mustard and Decay only had to get to the main hall during one of those Christian mass parodies that CRC indulged in so often. 

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ ready to finally unleash your ulti?‚Äù Legion asks his best friend. He can‚Äôt see it, but he knows that Tenko is grinning maniacally under his robe. And a rather minimalistic gasmask, identical to the ones that Mustard and Legion carry.

Tenko is like that. 

‚ÄúHell yeah, player two.‚Äù He finally gets an answer. 

The three of them are standing right behind the sea of pews, filled to the brim with people who are very busy venerating their own acts of petty (or not so petty) hatred against the mutant quirk holders. 

‚ÄúLegion to all.‚Äù Izuku switches to another channel. ‚ÄúPhase One in twenty seconds.‚Äù The CRC is going down hard. Chances that Phase Two will be needed are minimal. 

 

***

 

Nineteen seconds later, Decay makes a step forward. Legion kneels and touches the floor. His quirk stretches to its limit. The pews and the altar are suddenly surrounded by thick stone walls. Decay is locked inside with close to one hundred clan members. Or, to be exact, they are locked there with him. 

Mustard spreads his poisonous gas throughout the ground floor of the facility. It‚Äôs going to take him a minute or two to get it thick enough to incapacitate people, but he has Legion to defend him. There are some stragglers here and there, but nobody capable of facing an SS-Rank villain. 

Decay pushes his quirk to the limit. The CRC members are still surprised by the appearance of the wall when he touches two nearest clanners with five fingers each. They scream (it's painless, but they are surprised and terrified when they see what‚Äôs happening) as his quirk decays them into dust. More scream when the effect spreads into the nearest cultists. And then more of them. 

Infectious Decay, his most powerful super move, kills 97 people within the next three minutes. Nobody gets close enough to attack him. Mustard‚Äôs gas kills a further seven, while Legion scores merely three kills. 

 

***

 

The traitor heroes are chatting happily together with two tougher looking CRC regulars a level above. One of them is telling the others an amusing story of how he left a mutant quirk girl to die in a housefire, and how hilarious the shock and fear on her face when she realized that he isn‚Äôt going to save her. 

They hear screams coming from downstairs. They grab their weapons and support items. That‚Äôs when Kurogiri warps in Stain. He materializes in the middle of them, his katana drawn. 

They recognize him, of course. Their movements pause. One of them is braver than most (he will be the one to survive the longest, oddly enough). 

‚ÄúStain, you are surrounded!‚Äù Hero Killer laughs. 

‚ÄúAll I‚Äôm surrounded by is fear.‚Äù He replies. His maniacal smile makes two nearest ‚Äòheroes‚Äô take a step back in terror. ‚ÄúAnd dead fakes.‚Äù 

The last of his enemies has his throat sliced open four minutes and twenty-three seconds later. Hero Killer suffers only a single shallow wound. 

 

***

 

When the alarm rings, Himiko moves instantly. The nearest torturer (she won‚Äôt call them jailers, they don‚Äôt deserve that) gets stabbed before he can react. When the remaining ones gather in front of her, Kurogiri warps Spinner behind their back. 

He doesn‚Äôt warp out. The three of them slaughter seven people in the next minute. When that‚Äôs done, they open the cages up and have Kurogiri warp the captives (nine people with complex mutant quirks kidnapped from the streets) out of the building. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúTell me, why exactly did I get roped into that?‚Äù Mindscrew comments, before opening fire again. One of the clan thugs that failed to reach safety in time falls to the ground bleeding from several gunshots. ‚ÄúI should be smarter than this.‚Äù 

He, Gremlin and Dabi are hiding behind a set of overturned tables in the local barracks. The resistance is bigger than Legion estimated - it appears that one of the heavyhitters was visiting the barracks when the attack started. 

The rest of the hall is a mess. Part of it is burning, part of it is shred by gunfire. Gremlin armed Mindscrew with a lot of customized ammunition, but this time he mostly uses normal bullets. Painfully bland, but hey, as long as it works. 

‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm here because I want to make even better babies!‚Äù Gremlin replies with a maniacal grin and throws a firebomb behind what appears to be a bar. Judging from screams and a burning figure emerging from behind said bar, her throw was an accurate one. The alcohol burns well. ‚ÄúAnd I love field-testing them! So I think it‚Äôs awesome!‚Äù

Dabi stays silent (but he grins a bit, and that grin matches the one on Mindscrew‚Äôs face) and keeps throwing blue fireballs at the CRC‚Äôs giant that‚Äôs approaching them, hidden behind two metal tower shields. He is followed by several thugs that survived the initial assault. His fire‚Äôs scorching hot, but whatever the shield is made of, it helds strong against it. 

‚ÄúWatch this, Dabi.‚Äù Mindscrew decides that it‚Äôs time for a change in tactic. ‚ÄúHey, big guy! How much did the mutants pay your mother for a night? Is that still an option? Asking for a friend.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat did you‚Ä¶‚Äù The shieldbearer freezes. Thugs behind him are confused. Mindscrew lets out a chuckle. 

‚Äú Stop hiding behind your shields. ‚Äù

The rain of gunfire, fireballs and grenades cuts down the shieldbearer and the thugs in a few seconds. 

 

***

Purge hears the alarm and screams of his men, so he runs out of his office. He is a particularly normal looking human being. He prides himself on being able to keep a low profile and stay under the radar. Useful feats for an A-Rank Villain responsible for dozens of public crimes. 

Especially by someone whose quirk allows him to manipulate masses of people. How many ‚Äòspontaneous lynching‚Äô did he organize until now? He trained his quirk enough for it to have several more interesting applications. 

He sees one of the attackers right outside of his office. He is about to blast him with his quirk, when he recognizes the face. 

‚ÄúNakano?!‚Äù Purge forgets where he is and what is happening around him. Nakano is here! The lost lamb smiles apologetically and walks towards him. ‚ÄúPurity was looking for you everywhere, why are you‚Ä¶‚Äù 

He has only a second to notice Zealot activating his quirk. His figure erupts, almost doubling in size. It‚Äôs no size-alteration quirk - this is an all-round enhancement of strength, power and speed with a massive transformation component. 

Having a powerful mental manipulation quirk is of no use to you when you just allowed a strength-type to approach you. Before Purge can do anything, his arms are torn off and then his head is pulverized by a punch that would have made All Might proud.

 

***

 

‚ÄúWhy did you call for the meeting, detective?‚Äù Nedzu is reasonably intrigued. Detective Tsukauchi rarely does things like that, and has never done that without a reason. 

The group has expanded slightly. There is Eraserhead, visibly tired (then again, he is always like that). All Might in his skeletal form. Sir Nighteye and Lemillion. Finally, Nedzu himself. The composition of the group (even if Lemillion was brought in by Sir on his own) indicates a subject connected to the League, but‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúWe have a new development about League of Villains.‚Äù Detective replies. The attention of the people present focuses on. ‚ÄúFour hours ago someone launched a raid on a previously unknown Creature Rejection Clan‚Äôs hideout in Tokyo. Nine captives were liberated and moved to a hospital specializing in mutant healthcare. Their description of their liberators matches that of Spinner, Vampire and Kurogiri. We assume that the rest of the League was also present.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAttacking CRC?‚Äù Sir Nighteye is intrigued. He misses a certain part of the detective's mood, one that tells Nedzu that it‚Äôs not the whole reason for his presence. ‚ÄúAn unexpected change in their modus operandi.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not exactly surprised.‚Äù All Might adds. ‚ÄúThe League appears to see themselves as something akin to vigilantes, just ones ready to bring the war to the heroes if they aren‚Äôt up to the standard. Besides, Legion has personal reasons to dislike the quirkist groups.‚Äù 

Midoriya Izuku being the Legion is public knowledge at this point. Detective knows, but doesn‚Äôt know that Nedzu and the rest knew before him. 

‚ÄúDetective, is there something you wish to say?‚Äù Nedzu decides to skip directly to this part. 

‚ÄúThe attack was‚Ä¶ brutal.‚Äù Tsukauchi says after a short silence. ‚ÄúI believe that Legion decided to make a statement to remind the world that they are a League of Villains, not Vigilantes. That or he had to remind Stain that their methods align.‚Äù He still didn‚Äôt fully buy the revelation that Legion was the League‚Äôs head, rather than Stain.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid someone die?‚Äù Eraserhead asks. Nedzu thinks that he knows that the answer will be positive, though he also suspects that the number will be higher than the teacher thinks. 

‚ÄúWe are still counting corpses.‚Äù Detective finally says. Nedzu hears a short gasp somewhere in the room. ‚ÄúThe League annihilated one of the largest CRC bases we‚Äôve ever heard about. We currently estimate that they killed anywhere between one hundred and two hundred CRC members.‚Äù Even in the age when QLF levels down cities, those numbers are shocking. The League doesn‚Äôt have a thousand soldiers behind them. The people in the room stare in silence. 

‚ÄúWe believe that Purge, an A-Rank villain and Purity‚Äôs second in command, is among the casualties, but we‚Äôll require DNA identification for that.‚Äù Detective continues. ‚ÄúSomeone tore his arms off and then inflicted a blunt force trauma onto his head with enough strength to make everything above his abdomen effectively vanish. We've found bodies of six heroes and two B-Rank criminals on the same floor of the facility, their wounds indicating that Stain slew them. Officially we‚Äôre yet to explain why the heroes were there, but at least two of them were suspected of committing hate crimes at some point in their past. It‚Äôs unofficial, but I believe that they were CRC members too. Another B-Rank villain and seventeen E and F-Rank villains were found dead in what we presume to be barracks. Cause of death was either burns, gunfire or grenades, so we suspect that Dabi, Mindscrew and probably Gremlin fought there. The most troubling are events in the main hall of the facility.‚Äù 

Detective pauses. He knows that he is technically spreading confidential information, but he is way past that level. They are heroes going after the League. If anyone should know that, it‚Äôs them. 

‚ÄúWe suspect that the League attacked the hideout during one of the‚Ä¶ CRC gatherings.‚Äù Detective continues. ‚ÄúMustard filled the main hall with gas, and Legion disassembled a few clanners that tried to interrupt that. But the most casualties were caused by Decay. When the attack happened, Legion trapped the majority of the gathered rank and file cultists with Decay by using his quirk. The nature of Decay‚Äôs quirk makes it hard to count, but we estimate that he killed between seventy and one hundred fifty cultists.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith a five finger point quirk?!‚Äù Sir Nighteye is appalled. Eraserhead is merely shocked. Quirks like that are useful in one-on-one combat mostly. ‚ÄúEven if they were utterly incompetent in fighting, he shouldn‚Äôt be able‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúWe know.‚Äù Detective interrupts him and sighs. ‚ÄúIf we judge the length of attack from how long the neighbours heard the commotion, the raid lasted for less than five minutes.‚Äù More gasps and shocked stares. ‚ÄúUnless Decay is impossibly fast and proficient in combat, we have to assume that his quirk is capable of some form of area of effect attack. That or it‚Äôs a chained attack - Legion either imprisoned the cultists to stop them from fleeing or because the Decay‚Äôs quirk can spread from person to person and object to object when they are close enough.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh dear.‚Äù Nedzu says after a few seconds of silence. ‚ÄúI think for the first time in his career, Legion actually managed to pull through with the plan WITHOUT it getting derailed by something.‚Äù 

He promised to not kill people left and right, and he wants to stick to it. But he can‚Äôt help but feel faintly proud. CRC had a rather negative approach to quirk-carrying animals developing sapience, after all. The slightly sadistic rat can‚Äôt really feel bad for the ‚Äòvictims‚Äô of this massacre. 

‚ÄúIs that what caught your attention in all that?‚Äù Sir Nighteye tries not to be sarcastic. ‚ÄúYour, to quote Aizawa, Problem Child just committed mass murder.‚Äù 

‚ÄúTechnicalities.‚Äù Nedzu replies calmly. ‚ÄúThey are villains, Mirai. What did you expect? Even many heroes would have gone on a rampage in those circumstances, and we all know that the public‚Äô won‚Äôt care about two villain groups fighting each other, especially not when Eclipse is destroying a town every day. CRC is a major villain organization led by a supervillain with thousands of victims under its belt - the official approach to those is ‚Äòtake them alive if you think it‚Äôs convenient‚Äô. You think that Miruko and Gang Orca considered taking their enemies alive during their battle against QLF?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNedzu‚Ä¶‚Äù All Might is pissed off. Eraserhead decides to intervene. 

‚ÄúOkay, stop that.‚Äù The underground hero achieves his goal of stopping the brewing argument‚Ä¶ at the cost of becoming an object of attention. ‚ÄúYou were about to argue whether a villain group can LEGALLY murder another villain group. This is the height of irrationality. Could you please focus on something actually productive? Like, trying to figure out WHY Legion did that, and HOW did he do that? Plus what‚Äôs that entail for the future?‚Äù 

‚ÄúFair point, Aizawa.‚Äù All Might nods. ‚ÄúI think we can assume that Legion just proved to us what sort of tactical advantage a warp quirk can give you on a battlefield, just as Eclipse showed us on the strategic level. From what I heard from Tsukauchi I assume that the League attacked several points in the facility simultaneously or almost simultaneously. Take the Stain‚Äôs fight - he certainly didn‚Äôt get there by fighting his way from the entrance. So, if I‚Äôm correct, League used their shapeshifter to reconnoiter, and then had Kurogiri teleport their members in exactly where they should be. Add Legion‚Äôs ability to dissect quirks, and suddenly every notable defender finds himself facing their worst nightmare. Like Purge who was apparently destroyed by someone strength-oriented, without being given time to charge his mental quirk up. And if any assault party found itself overwhelmed, Legion would simply warp in reinforcements from other groups. From a tactical point of view, this raid was a masterpiece.‚Äù 

Eraserhead finds himself reminded that while All Might is often caught unaware of various things, he DOES have loads of combat experience. Nighteye was more of an investigator and a strategist for him. The Number One Hero needed no one to act as his tactician.

‚ÄúI can agree with that analysis.‚Äù Nedzu nods. ‚ÄúLegion proves to us over and over again that he knows how to properly apply the tools that he has to maximum effect. Thankfully most of the truly valuable places, like the UA, are armed in warp coordinate scramblers. USJ was a surprise, but now we have enough readings on Eclipse and Kurogiri quirks to stop them from simply walking into my office. That covers ‚Äòhow‚Äô. Time for ‚Äòwhy‚Äô.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIntimidation?‚Äù Sir Nighteye asks. ‚ÄúThey struck some high profile targets, but they started to gather a reputation of people who avoid collateral damages. Attacking in a different way might discourage further targets from for example trying to hide behind hostages. After slaying more than a hundred people in five minutes, they will be much more inclined to believe he would simply kill the hostages and then them.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that.‚Äù Lemillion, silent since the beginning, suddenly speaks. ‚ÄúAnd I think you still misunderstand who Legion is.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Sir is startled. Nedzu is interested. All Might vomits blood. Eraserhead wants to go home. 

‚ÄúYou see him as a villain who retains at least some morals and weird obsession for the true heroes, and think that his current operation was somehow unlike him.‚Äù Lemillion replies. ‚ÄúI spent only two days with him, but I think that I managed to get a glimpse on who he truly is. In a way, he and I are strikingly similar.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Sir is startled even more. The rest are busy listening. 

‚ÄúLet me explain.‚Äù Lemillion takes a deep breath. ‚ÄúI dreamt of heroics for years, a long time before I actually went to the UA. I‚Äôm not going to brag, but it was always my dream to save others, to become the greatest hero of them all. Not for fame, but simply because it meant that I saved a lot of people, and thus made the world a better place. I mean, even my hero name is a statement, a type of an oath that I want to save a million people before retirement. And I can‚Äôt help but notice how similar Legion seemed to have been at some point. And how similar in a twisted way he still is.‚Äù 

He pauses for a second, obviously struggling with finding correct words for what he is trying to describe.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to become a professional, official hero.‚Äù Lemillion continues finally. ‚ÄúThis means getting shackled by law and regulations, but also becoming a symbol of what people should strive for. We all know how many UA students dream of being like All Might, after all. Underground heroes, like Eraserhead, are those who decided to avoid the popularity so that they can do sometimes questionable things without tainting the image of heroics but while still being able to work officially and alongside police. I know that I‚Äôm probably going to mess up my graduation chances, but I‚Äôm going to risk saying that the difference between the vigilante and underground hero is that the latter has a badge. But the logic behind their operations is similar.‚Äù

Eraserhead wasn‚Äôt going to comment on that. But in the most butchered and simplified way, Lemillion was correct. Of course, this supposedly minor difference still meant a lot - vigilantes tended to know less about the law (due to lack of proper training), often accidentally messed up police or hero investigations with their operations, and in general tended to be enthusiastic (and sometimes fully accidental) amateurs.

The ‚Äòprofessional‚Äô vigilantes like the ones from the Knuckleduster‚Äôs Vigilante Alliance had many former heroes and former hero trainees in their midst (either tired of regulations or personally pissed off by the Hero Commission), and were generally speaking better organized. They also had many communication channels with underground heroes which tended to lessen the risk of Vigilante accidentally taking out a hero informant and so on. 

At least in methodology there were many similarities, something that made Eraserhead occasionally irritated. Vigilantes shouldn‚Äôt be needed to keep people safe. For now, they were.  

‚ÄúAnd then, Legion.‚Äù Lemillion finally reaches the main subject. ‚ÄúHe has the same drive to make people‚Äôs lives better. His character came from the same mold as mine and All Might‚Äôs. But something, perhaps meeting Overhaul, made him decide that even vigilantism is too limiting. So he unshackled himself entirely.‚Äù Few seconds of pause. ‚ÄúHe kills people that he perceives as evil. If he did that as a hero or vigilante, he would stain those terms with blood. So instead he embraces the term villain with pride. After all, it‚Äôs just villains killing other villains, at least to the general public.‚Äù

Eraserhead had to agree‚Ä¶ that this was an unusual take. But the more he thought about it, the more it made sense considering the Legion‚Äôs activities. His mind goes back to the Vigilante Alliance trying to kill Stain due to his past as Stendhal and potential implications of Hero Killer being a former vigilante. 

Legion literally called his organization ‚Äòthe League of Villains‚Äô. Was there a better way to keep people thinking that you are a villain? And was there a better way of reminding the public of it after taking down some corrupt heroes than a mass murder?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure if he is aware of that logic himself, really.‚Äù Lemillion continues, surprising Eraserhead. ‚ÄúHe appears to be oddly proud of being a supervillain, in a similar way in which I would be proud from getting to the Top Ten hero ranking. In a way, he feels like one of the scions of Stain. He doesn‚Äôt peddle drugs, because for him that‚Äôs pointless villainy. He is a villain that wants to change the society through an illegal use of quirks, and ‚Äòthe change‚Äô he strives for seems to be cleaning the country up. It makes even more sense if you consider him knowing about All Might‚Äôs quirk weakening - since he knows what would happen if All Might vanished tomorrow, he began to dismantle the groups that could tore the country into pieces in his absence.‚Äù 

The lecture is long enough that they somewhat get used to it. It takes them close to ten seconds to figure out that Lemillion wasn‚Äôt going to add anything more. 

‚ÄúIt makes perfect sense.‚Äù Nedzu is the first one to speak. ‚ÄúHe limited the collateral damage when it came to attacks on Thunderbolt and Endeavor, because said damage in their cases would be either hero students or civilians. But in the CRC raid the only ‚Äòbystanders‚Äô were cultists and thus villains, so he didn‚Äôt bother with limiting the lethality of his attack.‚Äù

Sir Nighteye nods. Honestly at this point Eraserhead wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he was secretly Mirio‚Äôs father. The paternal pride from accomplishments and growth is all there. And this was a very on-point analysis.  

Detective nods too. He doesn‚Äôt seem to be agreeing to anything in particular, merely deep in thoughts over Lemillion‚Äôs lecture. He is a detective after all - he is probably thinking how to apply the resulting knowledge to the investigation.

‚ÄúSo, in short, Legion is Nedzu, Stain and All Might's secret love child.‚Äù Eraserhead decides to stir the pot a bit. The combination of laughter, shock and betrayal in the eyes in front of him are a good enough reward. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just great. And really makes me wonder what he is going to do in the hypothetical scenario where he DOES clean the country up.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs a question in a similar vein to ‚Äòwhat will Stain do if he ever runs out of fake heroes to kill‚Äô. 

Aizawa suddenly remembered Stain's words about him knowing that eventually he would be caught‚Ä¶ and looking forward to it for as long as a true hero would be the one to stop him. Stain clearly treated himself as a villain to be caught and detained once he succeeded in changing the world. Why did he and Legion were so similar despite having no prior ties?

‚ÄúSo, how are we going to proceed?‚Äù Sir Nighteye asks Nedzu, deciding to completely ignore Eraserhead for his blasphemies. 

‚ÄúContinue investigating Legion in hopes of finding a way to detain him.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúAs much as his actions thus far benefited the society, he is still a murderer. And letting him act as judge, jury and executioner is a long-term detriment to the rule of law.‚Äù 

Only the presence of Mirio and detective Tsukauchi in the room stops Sir Nighteye, All Might and probably Eraserhead from calling Nedzu out on that. The rat either learned his lesson or was sarcastic. You could never tell. 

Eraserhead still thinks that it‚Äôs hypocritical. Not what Nedzu said but what Legion was doing. HPSC and Nedzu did the exact same thing as he did. Killed people for their own goals. And he was clearly calling them out on that. 

The only point where he was better than them was the fact that he (like Stain) at least had the decency of calling himself ‚Äòvillain‚Äô. If anything, he was probably more pissed off about Nedzu (and the HPSC) doing it despite being heroes than about them murdering people. Izuku Midoriya clearly liked heroes - or, to be exact, his overidealized image of the profession - a tad too much. Enough to kill people to maintain it. Just like Stain. 

Besides, he was still a kid. Even if a smart one, it still means a certain degree of immaturity. He - and most of the League - were of the same age as Ejirou Kirishima, the kid that in Eraserhead‚Äôs opinion was absolutely fixated on the concept of manliness and was ready to call about everything he respected as ‚Äòmanly‚Äô, even if it was a girl. 

Kids were illogical and prone to liking things or concepts too much. Like a lot of adults, frankly.  But they were typically worse at that. Legion, unfortunately, took that up to eleven and had a means to follow up on it together with resolve to kill people. 

He probably enjoyed killing Overhaul a bit too much.  

‚ÄúAnd in the so-called meantime‚Ä¶‚Äù Nedzu continues. ‚Äú... I have a certain theory to share with you. One that concerns the father of our favourite villain.‚Äù
Notes:

    Look, Midoriya isn't particularly malevolent, but he did grow up next to All for One. And I'm fairly certain that Overhaul wasn't the only one that died during the assault on the Shie Hasseikai headquarters, even if he was the only one whom Midoriya killed. And he got reaaaally influenced by Stain. So, yeah. Obligatory war crime scene, except victims were assholes.

Chapter 18: Getting Close
Summary:

    Some training and fluff, some terrifying (and slightly misplaced) revelations. Some worldbuilding too, I guess. And some reveals about quirk (khe khe Zealot).
    Also expect some earthquakes during the next two chapters, ngl. Especially the chapter 20 is a bit... shocking.

Chapter Text

‚ÄúFather?‚Äù All Might is surprised. Why is it important? Although part of him is curious who it was that actually managed to catch Mischief. She had quite a fanbase a while ago. Although he still refuses to count himself as a part of it.

‚ÄúFavourite villain?!‚Äù Sir Nighteye feels particularly outraged at the words. He would never favour a villain! Although he does feel sad that Legion chose that route to follow. He would make an outstanding hero. 

‚ÄúYes, yes.‚Äù Nedzu replies, ignoring the outrage. ‚ÄúYou see, the father of our dear Midoriya Izuku is an enigma. I had someone ask the past neighbours of the family, and they are all quite adamant that he was a rather enigmatic figure. In fact, oddly enough, no one seems to have ever seen him, save for the parents of Bakugou Katsuki. To continue with yet another odd point of the story, they were invited several times for a dinner‚Ä¶ which, interestingly enough, is the only case of someone actually seeing Hisashi Midoriya. No other visitor saw him. No one saw him out doing groceries. The official version is that he worked overseas and was rarely home‚Ä¶ but to speak in the shortest version, things do not add up.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou think it was a set-up.‚Äù Sir Nighteye caught the first. ‚ÄúThat whoever was introduced to Bakugous‚Äô actually wasn‚Äôt Hisashi Midoriya, but either someone else or Hisashi himself but under some form altering quirk or heavy make-up.‚Äù

‚ÄúPrecisely!‚Äù Nedzu replies with enthusiasm. ‚ÄúThis entire investigation is just endlessly interesting. It‚Äôs probably understandable considering that Legion‚Äôs mother was Mischief‚Ä¶ sorry for not mentioning it earlier Tsukauchi‚Ä¶‚Äù Detective gives the rat a death glare. ‚Äú... but someone went to truly extraordinary lengths to cover everything up. Each time I think I got something, I discover that I found only another layer of misdirection. I haven't had as much fun in years!‚Äù Eraserhead reminds himself that the rat is a special type of evil and gets over that announcement. 

‚ÄúTo be honest with you, despite wasting a lot of money and investigating Hisashi Midoriya for weeks I haven‚Äôt found anything.‚Äù Nedzu smiles brightly. ‚ÄúAnd that alone is why I was trying even harder! The identity of that man has been hidden with significantly more dedication than that of Inko Midoriya‚Ä¶ despite the latter being a hidden S-Rank villain! I believe you can understand why this only makes me more intrigued.‚Äù 

All Might and Tsukauchi nod with understanding. Sir is unreadable. 

‚ÄúAnd then I gave up.‚Äù Nedzu announces, catching them off-guard. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I think that I managed to crack the enigma. I just gave up on trying to investigate it from grounds-up. There is only a limited number of people who can warrant this degree of cover-up. Other supervillains, notable heroes, major celebrities that somehow aren‚Äôt heroes, influential politicians‚Ä¶ I actually decided to make face-to-face comparisons between them and the known parts of the Midoriya family! One by one! And that was really time consuming work, even with my quirk.‚Äù Eraserhead can imagine that. ‚ÄúThankfully, Lemillion managed to expose the Izuku‚Äôs current face to the world with his punch. This made my work significantly easier‚Ä¶ especially as something in my mind clicked after seeing it. Although it took me a while to come to a certain degree of certainty and I had to consult that with a specialist..‚Äù 

‚ÄúThis is an awfully long introduction to a reveal.‚Äù Sir Nighteye decides to interrupt. ‚ÄúI have a feeling that we won‚Äôt like the result.‚Äù Nedzu smiles. 

‚ÄúMore than that. You are going to be absolutely‚Ä¶ something. Gauging human reactions to certain things is still complicated to me.‚Äù The monitor on his desk turns to face them. On it is a picture of Izuku, and a large picture of whom Eraserhead presumes to be Midoriya Inko to the upper right from Izuku. There is an open space to the upper left of it, probably waiting for the father‚Äôs picture to be shown.

‚ÄúWe can all see the similarity, especially in terms of colour of the hair, eyes and so on.‚Äù Nedzu continues. ‚ÄúBut as we all know, there are things that one gets from their father. You are always a mix of your parents, with some random bits here and there. But when I look at Midoriya Izuku, I can‚Äôt help but feel like a certain person‚Äôs genetic heritage would fit the puzzle perfectly‚Ä¶ especially when you consider what we know about Izuku‚Äôs intelligence, interest in quirks and so on.‚Äù 

Nedzu clicks something on his keyboard. A new picture shows up on the screen. One of a white-haired man with red eyes. Eraserhead spots some hard to pinpoint similarity between him and Izuku, despite the vastly different colouration. The messy hair is the biggest one. There are also details on the face, like the shape of eyes, nose and so on that carry some faint similarity. 

It‚Äôs at this moment that Eraserhead notices that the room is silent. Much more than he expected. Then he looks around. All Might, Sir Nighteye and Tsukauchi are practically white. Lemillion appears to be as lost as Eraserhead is. 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù All Might manages to speak. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs impossible. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs just‚Ä¶‚Äù Nedzu raised his paw. 

‚ÄúBefore we discuss it, I believe that it‚Äôs time to introduce the man in the picture to young Lemillion and Eraserhead.‚Äù Principal says confidently. ‚ÄúThis man is the world‚Äôs one and only SSSS-Rank villain. Uncrowned emperor of the Japanese underground with influence spread over the entire world. Man spoken of as a legend by the regular villains, but referred to as Symbol of Evil by the supervillains. Villain so dangerous that the Commission, the government and I all agreed to keep his existence a secret so as to not provoke a panic. The man who tortured All Might‚Äôs mentor to death‚Ä¶ and tore out his stomach and lung when they battled. Although All Might eventually managed to triumph and slay him. Which happened six years ago.‚Äù Nedzu sighs. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt expect that without him keeping the Meta Liberation Army, Quirkless Liberation Front, Creature Rejection Clan, Inhuman Supremacy Party and dozens of smaller groups on a tight leash, they would unleash that much havoc.‚Äù 

Eraserhead could scarcely imagine someone controlling all those groups. But if he terrified All Might and Sir Nighteye that much‚Ä¶  

‚ÄúWhat was his quirk?‚Äù Lemillion asks the right question. Eraserhead would do it himself. 

‚ÄúWhich one?‚Äù Nedzu replies with a bitter chuckle. ‚ÄúHe had hundreds. He is the legendary Quirk Thief. Man capable of stealing and granting quirks to others. He stole a longevity quirk early on - he was apparently one of the first quirked individuals in Japan. Two centuries of organization building were something that even me and Mirai struggled to dismantle.‚Äù 

Eraserhead heard about the quirk thief legend. He spent enough time as an underground hero, so it was a given. As much as he admitted that there were many odd quirks out there, that very idea always struck him as‚Ä¶ outlandish. But unless this was all an elaborate prank‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ not possible.‚Äù All Might was still in denial. ‚ÄúThat man would have never had a child! That‚Äôs just‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt‚Ä¶ makes an uncomfortable amount of sense.‚Äù Sir Nighteye speaks. All Might‚Äôs eyes crucify him with their gaze. ‚ÄúThink about it, Yagi. Legion is an extremely intelligent tactician and strategist, with uncanny knowledge on operations of the villain groups that were formerly kneeling before that man. He appears to have an interest bordering on obsession when it comes to quirks‚Ä¶ especially yours. And Legion‚Äôs young age‚Ä¶ if All for One was grooming him into being his successor or influential lieutenant from the youngest age until his demise, it all makes perfect sense!‚Äù 

‚ÄúAll for One?‚Äù Lemillion interjects. Nedzu sighs.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs time to introduce you and Eraserhead into another secret. Since they are connected AND Aizawa is crucial in our dealings with Legion.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúAll for One is the ‚Äòofficial‚Äô name of the Quirk Thief‚Äôs quirk, but it was also used as his other moniker. But he had a brother, one of poor health but a heroic heart. He was thought to be quirkless, and his brother gave him a power stockpiling quirk as a form of control. Nobody knew that All for One‚Äôs brother had a fairly useless quirk that allowed itself to be willingly transferred to another person.‚Äù Lemillion‚Äôs eyes light up, while Eraserhead is still lost. ‚ÄúThe two quirks merged into one. It was then transferred from hero to hero, each of them hoping that someone down the line would finally grow strong enough to take down All for One‚Ä¶ a fitting mechanism considering that the quirk‚Äôs name was One for All.‚Äù Eraserhead could agree with that much. ‚ÄúAnd their wish was realized six years ago, when All Might, the current Holder of the One for All, managed to kill All for One. However, recently he transferred the quirk to Lemillion.‚Äù 

And now everything makes sense. It sounds like a fairytale, yes. But a fairly sensible fairytale. Eraserhead can work with that. 

‚ÄúIt all feels like a teenage rebellion.‚Äù Eraserhead points out, and all the eyes gather at him. ‚ÄúI mean, if he is All for One‚Äôs son, then they were together until like‚Ä¶ his 10th birthday? And if he was as powerful and influential as you claim, then I just fail to see how he could be there for his son very often. Certainly not common enough to deter his son from developing an unhealthy obsession for heroism AND becoming a terminal case of All Might‚Äôs fan.‚Äù Eraserhead continues. ‚ÄúAll Might then killed his dad, but despite that Legion did his utmost to not kill or wound All Might during the USJ attack. So unlike Thunderbolt and his mom, he doesn‚Äôt seem to have a grudge. He even saved Lemillion‚Äôs life and then let him return home, despite Lemillion carrying One for All and practically fistnuking him into halfdeath minutes earlier. So it seems to me that Legion was groomed to be that All for One‚Äôs successor. But when his half-deadbeat dad died out, he started to successively eradicate his old empire out of spite for bad parenting or because he decided to be a hero in own rights. Like his uncle.‚Äù 

The One for All first holder sounded like someone with potential. Unlike a lot of his past students. Eraserhead would have liked to meet him. Being ready to stand up against All for One despite being almost quirkless was impressive. 

‚ÄúOh my god.‚Äù All Might looks like his entire life was just rearranged in front of him. ‚ÄúAll for One‚Äôs son is MY FAN?!‚Äù Eraserhead thinks that this isn‚Äôt the most important part of what he said, but whatever floats the hero‚Äôs boat. 

‚ÄúThe potential All for One‚Äôs son.‚Äù Nedzu reminds. ‚ÄúBut yes, I agree with Eraserhead‚Äôs opinion. The most ironic part of it is that if we are correct, then All for One‚Äôs son is dismantling his father‚Äôs empire‚Ä¶ while using his father‚Äôs funds to pay for it. Because we know how ridiculously well-funded the League is despite no sounds of income.‚Äù Nedzu sighs. ‚ÄúIt would also explain how he knows so much about past One for All holders. His father probably described them to him in some butchered form at some point, as he killed most of them personally.‚Äù Nedzu looks around. ‚ÄúConsider this a theory. With circumstantial evidence, but a rather solid one. And now‚Ä¶ what do we do about it?‚Äù

UA-Spy: I have news for you

UA-Spy: but you are going to shit bricks when you hear it

SmallMight: very few things can ruin my mood right now, we‚Äôre all celebrating the raid in the base

SmallMight: wish you were here

UA-Spy: Nedzu just figured out that your father is All for One

SmallMight: HE WHAT

SmallMight: oh shit shit shit shit shit

UA-Spy: WAIT DON‚ÄôT DO SOMETHING DUMB IN A HURRY

UA-Spy: I think they find it hilarious

SmallMight: what

UA-Spy: They came to a conclusion that you were groomed to be his successor

UA-Spy: but then you went into a teenage rebellion phase

SmallMight: the WHAT

UA-Spy: and you‚Äôre now dismantling his old empire (by destroying groups like CRC bit by bit) 

UA-Spy: out of spite for him being a deadbeat father or smth

UA-Spy: also you almost gave All Might a heart attack when he realized that if that‚Äôs true then his archnemesis‚Äô son is practically worshipping him and has just commited a mass murder for him

UA-Spy: He sounds like you just realigned his entire worldview and he doesn‚Äôt know what to feel about it

UA-Spy: also they think that your parents are dead

SmallMight: so close and yet so far

SmallMight: Jesus christ what‚Äôs that rat smoking

SmallMight: I mean, I thought that I was good

SmallMight: but he is just ridiculous

SmallMight: how did he figure out

UA-Spy: apparently he decided that it was odd that your mother is a supervillain and yet he found out about her but your father is somehow ten times better concealed 

UA-Spy: so he started visually comparing your and your mother photos to photos of people whom can be considered to be worth of greater secrecy than an S-Rank in hiding

UA-Spy: then Lemillion blew off your mask and showed your face to the world

UA-Spy: and things clicked

SmallMight: I call bullshit

SmalMight: Seriously, what in the everfucklivingbiscuits is that logic

SmallMight: I‚Äôm so done

SmallMight: So what are they going to do about it

UA-Spy: nothing

SmallMight: what

UA-Spy: They find it hilarious, I told you

UA-Spy: they will try to apprehend you if they found out how to dismantle the League

UA-Spy: they are giving their best to catch you but Nedzu sounds like a father proud of his son‚Äôs achievements when he talks about you

UA-Spy: I think that he is looking forward to your further rampage

UA-Spy: just act like your parents vanished on you and you‚Äôll be ok

UA-Spy: ask Tenko for tips xDD

SmallMight: ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs just nasty lol

UA-Spy: also don‚Äôt make them suspect that you have his quirk

UA-Spy: and you‚Äôre golden

SmallMight: I‚Äôm simultaneously frightened to the bone and reassured

UA-Spy: also Lemillion just fucking psychoanalized you to the base particle level

UA-Spy: and boy if he isn‚Äôt correct

SmallMight: what? 

UA-Spy: listen to this

 

He does. 

 

SmallMight: holy shit Lemillion is so cool of a hero I‚Äôm so happy that he gave me his autograph before leaving

SmallMight: and it‚Äôs apparently his first one ever

SmallMight: I‚Äôm going to treasure it like All Might‚Äôs signature

SmallMight: also I‚Äôm telling Eri that he is an awesome hero 

SmallMight: she might like him because he has a funny face that should be easy to draw tbh

SmallMight: but yeah, part of this I didn‚Äôt think about, but I kinda agree with the general outline

UA-Spy: just don‚Äôt tell your dad that that you are cleaning the country for All Might and trying to make the heroics great again

UA-Spy: he might snap from his retirement if he hears that his son is ‚Äòhero with villain methods‚Äô

SmallMight: I‚Äôm a villain.

SmallMight: I use quirks to break the law

SmallMight: murder people

SmallMight: that‚Äôs evil and wrong, even if it‚Äôs just the certain type of people that totally deserve it for being quirkist murderers and/or stains on the good name of heroics

UA-Spy: dude I literally heard Lemillion describe that but better than you did don‚Äôt even bother

SmallMight: ;_; 

SmallMight: no one loves me anymore

UA-Spy: We have Himiko for that

The best part of having Stain around was the combat training. They had something comparable to a training room in the basement, and Stain was ready to kill his boredom between League operations with some harsh training. 

Not everyone took part. Legion, Zealot, Spinner and Vampire showed up on their own. Decay, Gremlin and Mindscrew attended when Legion told them to. Decay could benefit a lot, but he hated distraction from playing computer games. Gremlin actually had a sword (the less was said about this cyberpunk abomination the better) and a shield as a part of her villain outfit, but tearing her away from her constant babymaking was a pain. Mindscrew liked guns, but was willing to figure out some self-defense measures if enemies got close. Unfortunately, he was just as much of a lazy ass as Decay. 

Quirks were allowed. In all honesty, everything was allowed. Legion was there and he could literally resurrect someone if they died. Didn‚Äôt happen until now, but they still had to clean a lot of blood from the floor on an almost daily basis. At least Gremlin developed a specialized, floor-cleaning baby for the job. 

Since quirks were allowed, Legion loved watching the training even when he was acting as a nurse. It was brutal, but Q U I R K S! This never got boring. 

Vampire sat on the bench next to him, bleeding from a few nasty cuts. He fixed them with Overhaul, but she was obviously exhausted so she wanted to rest for a bit. There was something dreamy in her eyes, probably due to how much the room had to smell of blood. It also made her much more‚Ä¶ touchy. 

Izuku got used to it somewhere along the way. 

‚ÄúIzuu‚Ä¶‚Äù She leans for a hug. He doesn‚Äôt say a thing when he feels her fangs piercing his shoulder. Himiko sucks a lot of blood before pulling back. ‚ÄúI never get tired of your taste, Zuku.‚Äù He also doesn‚Äôt get tired of her doing that, but he‚Äôs too shy about certain things to admit it.

‚ÄúThat can be skewed in the wrong way.‚Äù Izuku replies with a chuckle. He uses Overhaul to reset himself and the bite wound vanishes. ‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôm starting to suspect that you have a complex mutant quirk.‚Äù 

That surprises her. Mutant quirks normally don‚Äôt make people into shapeshifters. 

‚ÄúWait, what?‚Äù She asks. Her bloodlust is mostly sated right now, and she is back to acting more or less normal. 

‚ÄúI mean, think about it.‚Äù Izuku really enjoys this subject. ‚ÄúComplex mutant quirks tend to influence a lot of things in a more or less permanent manner. Unlike emitter, transformation or even simple mutant quirks, who are much more singular. You have your blood transformation thing, yes. But you also have permanent fangs. This alone could be considered a minor mutant factor made necessary by your quirk mechanism, but‚Ä¶ think about it. Drinking blood doesn‚Äôt only allow you to transform into people. It recovers your stamina. I‚Äôm almost certain that it makes your wounds close faster. You actually need to do that to avoid anemia, and your body knows about it well enough to make you lust for it when you are blood-deprived. You have an enhanced smell, although it works best when it comes to detecting blood. You can even tell people‚Äôs blood from each other when you focus on it hard enough, yes?‚Äù Himiko nods. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm also fairly certain that your body is stronger and more agile than it should be concerning your body‚Ä¶errr, I mean, you don‚Äôt seem to have well-defined muscles, yet your strength is only marginally smaller than Mei‚Äôs. But you are way more agile.‚Äù He really isn‚Äôt confident talking about her body, and it is rather obvious. Himiko, as always, finds that cute. 

Gremlin was an engineer. She carried a lot of things around. It surprised a lot of people, but she was built like an athlete. Her six-pack was no joke. 

‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ a vampire mutant?‚Äù Himiko is surprised by the idea. ‚ÄúWhat about shapeshifting then? Isn‚Äôt that a transformation quirk?‚Äù

‚ÄúActually, I read a lot about mutant quirks recently.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúApparently there are rare cases when a complex mutant quirk coincides with a transformation or emitter quirk. However when that happens, said additional quirks are almost always‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶ of a similar theme? So for example a complex frog mutant will not develop a fire ability, but might, albeit chance is minimal, develop a water or poison quirk or something like that? So I developed a theory that you are like that, with both a vampire mutant quirk and an aligned blood transformation quirk. But we won‚Äôt really be sure until we see what sort of quirks will your children inheee‚Ä¶‚Äù 

Izuku wasn‚Äôt really thinking about what he was saying. He was in his almost-mumbling-about-quirks mod. Realization strikes him hard and he instantly goes red. Himiko‚Äôs reaction is identical (HER children!) but she recovers quicker and goes for the throat. 

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ our children will all be cute and kind criminal mastermind vampires?‚Äù If it was manga, Izuku would let out a puff of smoke through his ears. He is down for the count. Himiko takes advantage of that by relocating onto his lap and hugging him closer. 

‚ÄúStop teasing me like that, Himi.‚Äù He whispers while trying to cover his face. She kisses him on the cheek, and laughs internally when he is even more startled. 

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help it, it‚Äôs too much fun.‚Äù She replies honestly. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, I still have a few more minutes before Stain drags me back into the ring. You can talk about quirks if you want, consider this a payback for teasing.‚Äù She likes hearing him talk about quirks. He is so focused, so enthusiastic about it‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSo, for example, why did they come to be?‚Äù 

‚ÄúErr, nobody knows that for sure.‚Äù He replies quickly. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm in the‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶ intelligent design camp, though?‚Äù 

‚ÄúIntelligent design?‚Äù She asks curiously. ‚ÄúSo, like, God made them?‚Äù

‚ÄúGod, gods, aliens, creatures from different dimensions, perhaps our subconscious will or something like that.‚Äù He quickly replies. She is still on his lap (and it‚Äôs very comfy), but she can see the shyness evaporate as his mind moves over to his favourite subject. ‚ÄúI have no idea which option is correct, but‚Ä¶ the quirks aren‚Äôt random enough to be a natural occurrence. Cases like Dabi, who got powerful flames and resistance to low temperatures instead of high are extremely rare and tend to occur when someone tries to go into vastly incompatible eugenics. Many quirks are accompanied by a multitude of secondary characteristics that make them stronger and easier to use. This happens even among the random mutations, so people like Tenko. But mutations should be random, and it makes no sense for someone to suddenly develop several different traits all in perfect harmony with each other. So I‚Äôm suspecting some will behind all of that. Especially when you take in quirks such as the one Zealot got.‚Äù 

In the background the villain in question receives a truly nasty punch to the face from Stain. He lands on the floor and only narrowly manages to dodge the kick. 

‚ÄúHis quirk is all-round strength, speed and endurance amplification during combat.‚Äù Izuku continues. ‚ÄúProvided that he sees himself as good and his enemy as evil. And the stronger the moral difference he perceives, the greater the power boost. But the point is, his quirk is grounded not only in his personal perception but also in abstract concepts. I can understand Re-Destro‚Äôs quirk, who has a power-boost proportional to stress level, but Zealot‚Äôs quirk is simply too abstract. So is yours, if it‚Äôs actually a complex mutant one - there are some blood drinking bats, but you are obviously way closer to the cultural image of vampires. And they never existed. So either there is something granting the powers at will to people OR the awakening of quirks is based on our own minds, meaning that we subconsciously design our own powers.‚Äù 

She loves hearing his lectures. She knows he is smart (way smarter than her, let‚Äôs be honest), but seeing him all confident and talkative is just‚Ä¶ actually kinda sexy? She listens to him intently, because he says interesting things, but she isn‚Äôt blind to other things. 

He is done with that lecture. So she is going to let him make another. Stain still didn‚Äôt notice her absence and‚Ä¶ Stain? 

‚ÄúWhat about Stain?‚Äù She asks and he eyes her questioningly. ‚ÄúHe has a blood paralysis quirk, yes? But I can scarcely imagine a human being moving as fast as he does. He is way faster than me and you say that I might be above human level in that field!‚Äù 

‚ÄúErr, I‚Äôm actually kinda into pre-quirk cultural imagining of heroes and villains. Although they were referred to as ‚Äòsuperheroes‚Äô and ‚Äòsupervillains‚Äô back then.‚Äù He replies promptly. She knows about that, he mentioned it more than once but still feels kinda ashamed to admit it. She likes his nerdy qualities, but he fails to get used to that idea. ‚ÄúThe point is, they didn‚Äôt have quirks back then so they imagined many different ways of obtaining superhuman degrees of abilities. We mostly dialed back culturally to quirks and only that, but there were more types back then.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike?‚Äù There is a genuine curiosity on her face. She can scarcely imagine a hero or a villain not using a quirk‚Ä¶ okay, maybe if they were really smart? Izuku would have managed to do scary stuff with the League even without his quirk. She is certain about that. 

‚ÄúFor example, some such superhumans got the super part from dealing with some supernatural entities.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúReligious or not. Others from gadgets and intellect‚Ä¶ we can honestly count Gremlin as an example, she has a quirk but it‚Äôs mostly useless when it comes to combat. So she is using various gadgets she created to cross the gap.‚Äù Himiko suddenly realizes that while she didn‚Äôt think about it earlier, this makes perfect sense. ‚ÄúYou had people who were simply incredibly smart, so all those masterminds and‚Ä¶ well, honestly, Stain‚Äôs strength and speed is either the so-called Charles Atlas Superpower or quirk-enhanced genetics.‚Äù 

‚ÄúCharles Atlas?‚Äù She never heard of the name. Is that some old scientist or someone like that?

‚ÄúCharles Atlas Superpower is a superhuman power obtained by training.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúI mean, imagine that someone you know is a serious bodybuilder. So he pretty much lives in the gym. When this eventually makes him go beyond what‚Äôs possible for humans and he is suddenly able to throw around All Might-grade punches due to the training making him impossibly strong, it‚Äôs Charles Atlas Superpower.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo Stain amassed so much training and combat experience that, together with his absolutely mindless dedication, it made him able to go beyond the limits of what humans should be capable of?‚Äù She asks and he gives her a ‚Äòyes you are super right good job!‚Äô smile that makes her heart melt even further. He probably forgot that she was on his lap. 

‚ÄúThe alternative is the theory that quirks enhance humans as a whole even passively.‚Äù Izuku continues, blissfully unaware of how the girl cuddling with him is melting down in his arms. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what my dad thinks, but personally I think he is too‚Ä¶ quirk-centered in his thinking. But he did tell me that when he was young, what passed for ‚Äòpowerful emitter quirk users‚Äô was significantly squishier than today. And that every subsequent generation appears to be stronger in general than the past one. Not only in terms of their quirks.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait.‚Äù She says and he pauses his lecture. ‚ÄúIs that why you are‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶ kinda weak? Sorry to put it like that, but you‚Äôre physically the weakest of us all. And that‚Äôs after I found out that you were using Strength Amp and Reflex Boost during our training. And you are something like a half-second generation quirked person, yes?‚Äù 

‚ÄúErrr, yes.‚Äù Izuku replies with just a hint of shame. ‚Äú Dad actually keeps four of five endurance enhancement quirks active when in combat to bridge that gap, because otherwise Stain would have probably knocked him out with a single punch if he wanted. Even without quirk. The difference isn‚Äôt massive when you compare me and the average human being out there, so dad‚Äôs theory is that this general passive augmentation is tied to the strength of your quirk. So, for example Endeavor could probably remain standing and in combat after two or three regular All Might punches, despite being an emitter quirk user. Overhaul was built way scrawnier than the former Number Two Hero and had no strength enhancement quirk to rely on, but I saw him remain standing after dad‚Äôs punch. Not one of his stronger ones, but I saw this quirk combo split a stone boulder in half.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMakes sense.‚Äù Himiko replies after a while of thinking. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ weren‚Äôt they both rather... singleminded in their quirk usage? Endeavor was a training freak, and Overhaul sounds like someone who constantly overused their quirk. So‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs still that Charles Atlas thing? You can‚Äôt say that they lacked dedication and conviction when it comes to growing stronger.‚Äù 

His eyes beam. She said something right.

‚ÄúYes, I thought the same!‚Äù His enthusiasm is childishly innocent and it‚Äôs the second cutest thing she ever saw after his adopted sister. ‚ÄúSo I kinda combined the two theories. I believe that passive genetic augmentation makes the growth ceiling raise higher and higher with every subsequent generation, but it‚Äôs the dedication to training your quirk and certain form of mental focus on strength growth that lets some people reach said ceiling. So I think‚Ä¶‚Äù 

She never found out what he was thinking. Someone grabs her from behind by the collar. She looks back and sees Stain standing there, towering over Himiko. Behind him she can see several incapacitated villains. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to borrow her for a while.‚Äù His eyes scream pain. 
Chapter 19: Understanding
Summary:

    New resolve. New plans.

Notes:

(See the end of the chapter for notes.)
Chapter Text

VampirePrincess: Note to you all

VampirePrincess: do not let the supreme leader SmallMight talk about your quirk

VampirePrincess: unless you are ready to have your entire life turned upside-down 

SmallMight: It wasn‚Äôt that bad! I just shared some observations.

FuckSchool: ???

SneakyGecko: Oh?

Insomniac: tell me 

VampirePrincess: yeah so we are kinda cuddling in the training room

VampirePrincess: atmosphere is romantic, I tease him about things because he is so cute when shy

HandyMan: normies

Insomniac: normies

FuckSchool: lol

UA-Spy: i have a feeling that this is going to be a good one

VampirePrincess: and suddenly he is like ‚Äúdid you know that you are actually a complex mutant‚Äù

SneakyGecko: what?!

Insomniac: the fuck

FuckSchool: what sort of complex mutant quirk makes you into a shapeshifter

SmallMight: sigh

UA-Spy: I called it xD holy shit

VampirePrincess: apparently I‚Äôm somewhat a ‚Äòvampire mutant‚Äô thing?

VampirePrincess: so I drink blood for the living (abstaining = anemia), can smell blood from a distance, drinking makes me recover stamina, probably heal faster and I‚Äôm also stronger and more agile than I should be considering my body-built

VampirePrincess: also there are rare cases of double-quirk bearers with one quirk being a complex mutant one and another being a thematically compatible non-mutant quirk

VampirePrincess: So a frog human might get a water emitter quirk but not fire emitter quirk, and since I‚Äôm all about blood, I got a blood transformation quirk? 

VampirePrincess: but apparently we won‚Äôt be 100% sure until I have children, and if they all turn out to be little vampires then I‚Äôm officially a complex mutant

SneakyGecko: welcome to the complex mutant club (provisionally)

VampirePrincess: heh thank you, do I get a T-shirt

SneakyGecko: we should get some, yes

HandyMan: always knew you were a human tick, now I‚Äôm just more certain

VampirePrincess: hey that‚Äôs hate speech when I‚Äôm a complex mutant >_< 

HandyMan: don‚Äôt care

VampirePrincess: also I faintly remember my parents telling me that I was extremely vulnerable to sunburns when small

VampirePrincess: so after the revelation from SmallMight I thought about it and I think I stopped being that much sunburned when they finally gave up on trying to find a way of making me quote unquote normal

VampirePrincess: and I started getting blood regularly (then again I think I was less dependent on it when young)

VampirePrincess: so I might be vulnerable to sunlight if bloodstarved? 

Insomniac: Himiko: I developed a weakness

Insomniac: Tenko: yay

Insomniac: Himiko: It‚Äôs sunlight

Insomniac: Tenko: I don‚Äôt know what that is but I‚Äôll find out and use it against you

SmallMight: LOL

HandyMan: fuck off

FuckSchool: xDDD

UA-Spy: ouch xD

SneakyGecko: pfffft

SmallMight: since normal light doesn‚Äôt do that to you, I suspect that it‚Äôs the UV light

SmallMight: I‚Äôll add it to the notes, thanks for the heads-up

SneakyGecko: notes? 

VampirePrincess: half of his villain lair slash study slash second room is pretty much an archive about cool quirks. Heroes, villains or neither. alive or dead. Doesn‚Äôt matter.

VampirePrincess: strengths, super moves, weaknesses, theories on how they work

VampirePrincess: he is a ‚Äòbit‚Äô of a quirk analyst, not sure if you‚Äôve noticed

SneakyGecko: I think I kinda did

SmallMight: hey it‚Äôs not that large of an archive, stop making it sound like it‚Äôs something it‚Äôs not

VampirePrincess: how many quirks you‚Äôve dissected like that

SmallMight: just a few thousand? It‚Äôs not that much

UA-Spy: (o_o) 

HandyMan: nerd

Insomniac: get a hobby dud‚Ä¶ oh wait that‚Äôs your hobby

Insomniac: get a second one then

Insomniac: also @HandyMan stop kinkshaming your best friend

SmallMight: That‚Äôs not a kink! C‚Äômon people

HandyMan: Oh? 

HandyMan: so you didn‚Äôt analyze Himiko‚Äôs quirk in d e t a i l s?

HandyMan: what was that about her bodybuilt

SmallMight: ‚Ä¶ is that a revenge for me wanting to find you a catgirl

HandyMan: yes

 

***

 

UA-Spy: you there

SmallMight: always, unless certain princess is busy cuddling me to death because she is too afraid that I‚Äôll try to stop All Might punch with my face again when she lets me leave her sight

UA-Spy: your crush at least notices you

SmallMight: rip

UA-Spy: then again it might be for the best, who knows when I‚Äôm exposed

SmallMight: fair

SmallMight: So what is it about?

UA-Spy: Blueberry wants a lift out of QLF

UA-Spy: Blueberry +3, apparently.

SmallMight: oh? 

UA-Spy: they don‚Äôt know about the League, but I did mention that I might get someone to help them without putting them in jail for what they did while part of the Front

SmallMIght: why though

SmallMight: I‚Äôm all in for a way to deal damage to the Front, but they are famous for fanatical loyalty of their members, now they seem to be winning and suddenly‚Ä¶ this?

UA-Spy: it‚Äôs because they are winning

SmallMight: am confused

UA-Spy: just had a very emotional talk with Blueberry

UA-Spy: she isn‚Äôt sure how much longer can she keep that special phone from Gremlin hidden btw.

UA-Spy: She finally told me actual things about QLF and things are going from bad to worse

SmallMight: what?

UA-Spy: they keep receiving manpower and equipment from somewhere, Eclipse warps them in

UA-Spy: new recruits are quirkless but most of them aren‚Äôt speaking Japanese

UA-Spy: looks like the Eclipse‚Äôs victories put eyes of quirkless liberation groups throughout the world on Japan

UA-Spy: recent attacks are launched only with past members of QLF, while the new recruits are training

UA-Spy: QLF now has at least 5000 active members and counting‚Ä¶ and the 4000 new ones have an equipment as good as the first 1000 [but are rushed through training]

SmallMight: Jesus Christ, they are gathering strength for some major operation

UA-Spy: and nobody knows a fucking thing

UA-Spy: things get worse

SmallMight: shit

UA-Spy: Eclipse is turning increasingly deranged

UA-Spy: we all know that quirkless are treated by the society as subhumans (Nedzu barely sank the Commission‚Äôs proposal for forbidding them from marrying the quirked a few years ago but we know that there are still people supporting the idea in the Diet)

UA-Spy: and that they have the reasons to be pissed off

SmallMight: yes

UA-Spy: but lots of people like Blueberry joined to be safe from abuse, meet others like her and to help said others (even if she is ok from shooting a hero or a policeman dead, I mean she has negative experience with them like I do)

UA-Spy: But the cells in the field had limited contact with the leadership due to the secrecy and so on

UA-Spy: now they operate together and some field cells with ideology akin to Blueberry‚Äôs discovered that the Front leadership is a fucking doomsday cult

SmallMight: what?!

UA-Spy: Eclipse goes on rants how quirkless might be a dying breed and how they have nothing to lose so they can as well die out in flames and make the quirked that survive remember them with fear

UA-Spy: the new recruits seem to be agreeing with her.

UA-Spy: until now the QLF was mostly focused on destroying political or quirk-aligned targets, while shooting random people was a second priority (hard to say under the quirk suppressant if you aren‚Äôt shooting some surviving quirkless guy)

UA-Spy: once they start moving their main force, I think that they will slaughter everyone in sight, especially the defenseless civilians

UA-Spy: And that‚Äôs still not the worst

SmallMight: ‚Ä¶ 

UA-Spy: Blueberry‚Äôs cell leader went out to talk about the ‚Äòkill everything that moves‚Äô policy with his higher-ups

UA-Spy: apparently similar in ideology to her and pretty swell guy

UA-Spy: he returned three hours later spouting the same slogans as Eclipse with fanatical zeal

SmallMight: Shit, brainwashing quirk?

UA-Spy: some form of

UA-Spy: I think they got a late bloomer with powerful brainwashing quirk, but they can‚Äôt use it super quickly so they started from key members or those that dared to speak out against Eclipse

UA-Spy: eventually they are going to get Blueberry, so she wants a lift out preferably asap

UA-Spy: I got the coordinates of the QLF main base, and she is willing to tell everything she can about the layout, so‚Ä¶ we can lift them out with Kurogiri

SmallMight: it won‚Äôt work

UA-Spy: what?

SmallMight: Ever heard of warp interference?

UA-Spy: err, no? is it something about warp quirks? 

SmallMight: Yeah. Warp quirks naturally suppress each other (they distort reality, and warping anywhere from within a few kilometers area surrounding the active distortion is suicide so quirks shut down on their own and stay dormant until they can safely be used)

SmallMight: There was a case in Poland I think 30 years ago when two twins awakened warp quirks but were thought to be quirkless until they were 12 years old. Then one of them had an accident and was taken to a hospital 10 kilometers away from their village and it turned out that they were warp-interfering each other for the past 12 years (school right next to home, very close to each other so didn‚Äôt move anywhere on their own etc).

SmallMight: you can warp TO an area of warp interference (expect it to be bumpy though), and there is technically an option to force a (super dangerous) warp from the area if you are skillful enough with warp quirks (still suicide), but no casual warp outs

SmallMight: so if we warp to the QLF base while Eclipse is around, Kurogiri won‚Äôt be able to evacuate us and we‚Äôll get caught up with 5000 frothing fanatics, and two supervillains

SmallMight: worst of all, Eclipse will know instantly that something is interfering with her warp quirk, and while I don‚Äôt think she knows about warp interference phenomenon, she will certainly put the base on high alert

UA-Spy: fuck

SmallMight: on the other hand‚Ä¶ wait, I think I have an idea

SmallMight: it‚Äôs crazy BUT might work

UA-Spy: how can I help you

SmallMight: can Blueberry tell me with at least a few minutes of time to spare about what city is going to be attacked next and where (more or less) Eclipse is planning to warp to inside of it? few days ahead if possible

Eraserhead was slowly getting used to Legion phoning him. Each time from a different burner phone. And each time from a completely different, impossible place. Apparently the last talk was from the South Pole, which the underground hero frankly didn‚Äôt buy.

He was ready to bet a jelly pouch that Gremlin had her fingers in it. 

‚ÄúHello there, Eraserhead!‚Äù Legion sounded unusually cheerful. ‚ÄúI have news concerning the QLF.‚Äù 

Situation was a bit awkward, because he was in the teacher‚Äôs lounge, happily nudged into a corner behind a couch where nobody could see him and he was finally alone. He was tired after his homeroom (1-A was a bunch of demons, not students) and he planned to remain hidden even if someone came looking for him. 

‚ÄúPlease tell me that Eclipse and the QLF as a whole decided to retire.‚Äù Aizawa sighs loudly. ‚ÄúAt this point I think that the government would have paid them just to get rid of the issue without losing more towns.‚Äù 

At least it sounds like Lemillion‚Äôs theory about Legion going after the QLF is confirmed. That makes Eraserhead slightly relieved.

‚ÄúErrr, nope.‚Äù Legions bring him back to Earth. ‚ÄúActually my news is of the ‚Äòoh crap we‚Äôre all going to die‚Äô type.‚Äù

Eraserhead didn't want to hear anything like that when he was crawling off his bed this morning. Alas, life is brutal.

‚ÄúGreat.‚Äù The underground hero wants to go to sleep. But he can‚Äôt. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúEclipse impressed the international quirkless terror group enough for them to start pitching in reinforcements to her ongoing guerilla campaign.‚Äù Legion delivers his news. First sentence is already a massive headache. ‚ÄúBoth in manpower and equipment. She continues raiding towns with the original Front members to lull heroes‚Äô vigilance, but my source in the QLF states that she has several thousand new recruits going through a rushed training regimen. And enough weapons to equip them all.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, fuck.‚Äù Eraserhead rarely curses, but if this message is true, this is a perfect moment to swear. ‚ÄúSo they are prepping for a large assault on something. Any ideas on that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSource doesn‚Äôt know, but I have a theory.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúEclipse is rushing the training as if in a hurry, and‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt the I-Island going to get close to Japan soon?‚Äù 

That is bad news, Eraserhead decides. His ability to understate the gravity of the situation is truly astounding. Destruction of I-Island - the world‚Äôs center of quirk research - would be a monumental blow to the quirked community, and a rallying cry for abused quirkless worldwide. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually planning to assassinate Eclipse before that happens.‚Äù Legion says, and Eraserhead finds himself staring blankly. Did he just hear‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúAs a late bloomer I can understand the woes of the quirkless, and if they focused on assassinating abusive heroes and politicians then I wouldn‚Äôt bat an eye. Hell, I would probably forward some monthly donations to them! But now the QLF is descending into doomsday cult status. Eclipse is apparently going on rants on how quirkless are a dying breed and that if they are going to die out, they could as well make the world remember them with fear. And at least the new recruits bought that wholeheartedly.‚Äù 

Oh no, thinks Eraserhead. This is going from bad to worse. 

‚ÄúYou can expect them to leave less and less survivors with every subsequent attack.‚Äù Legion continues. ‚ÄúAlso, according to my source, the QLF got a late bloomer with a powerful brainwashing quirk. Everyone who speaks against exterminating quirked to the last one disappears and returns a few hours later, unconditionally agreeing with Eclipse. I think that she is planning to brainwash every QLF member eventually, but this takes time.‚Äù 

And if they are brainwashed, they will certainly be killing everything that moves when she tells them to. Eraserhead‚Äôs headache is approaching a full-blown migraine status. 

‚ÄúSo, assassination?‚Äù He decides to return to something that at least appears to be hopeful. 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Legion is silent after that short confirmation‚Ä¶ for a bit too long. ‚ÄúBut you won‚Äôt like the plan.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like any part of this talk, problem child.‚Äù Eraserhead replies promptly. ‚ÄúDish it out so I can return to my nap faster.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe League is going to ambush Eclipse the day after tomorrow.‚Äù Legion is silent for a few seconds. ‚ÄúWhen she comes to attack the UA.‚Äù 

Full stop.

‚ÄúShe what?!‚Äù Eraserhead says louder than he thought. Ectoplasm notices his hideout, but returns to grading math homework instead of commenting. ‚ÄúTell me you are joking.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúWith the Hero Commission weakened, the UA is the main potential source of strength for the government. Without Nedzu to pull strings, getting several agencies to make a team-up will take much more time, limiting the government's ability to form a proper response to further QLF raids. I think they also want to get rid of UA before attacking I-Island. Today and tomorrow they will make no raids to lull heroes into a false sense of safety, and then they will warp to Musutafu. Outside of UA‚Äôs warp coordinate scramblers range, but close enough for the gas to reach the school. And then they will assault you directly while you‚Äôre down.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI assume that you have a plan for all of that.‚Äù Eraserhead hates the very concept of asking a villain about it, but he is certain that Nedzu will want to hear Legion‚Äôs opinion on it either way.

‚ÄúI have devised a way of isolating Eclipse during the warp, which should stop the QLF from warping in soldiers and launching the gas.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm going to ambush her when she starts the attack. But I need you to figure out a way of moving All Might and other high-profile heroes from UA elsewhere for a day to explain why they didn‚Äôt make it to the battle. And to get the local police and heroes to focus on cordoning the area and evacuating civilians.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou want to fight her on your own.‚Äù Which was interesting. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kinda personal?‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúThe point is that I need you to keep others from interfering. League is skilled enough to take her down, and I promise you she will be taken out of the picture if no local hero intervenes. Hearing that All Might isn‚Äôt around and seeing three supervillains battling it out should deter them from trying to butt-in, but‚Ä¶ well, we all know that butting your head in when you aren‚Äôt supposed to is the essence of being a hero.‚Äù And now Legion was quoting All Might. Great. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll see what I can do.‚Äù He says. ‚ÄúIt all depends on Nedzu and a certain local detective.‚Äù

CatProvider: Since you all seem to be very, very busy, I‚Äôm going to inform you that new villain rankings have been announced.

VampirePrincess: oh shit

CatProvider: Language.

VampirePrincess: I‚Äôm sorry, Papagiri. 

FuckSchool: It's a post-CRC raid ranking, yes?

CatProvider: Correct.

UA-Spy: *cries in no villain ranking*

SmallMight: @UA-Spy don‚Äôt worry, Nedzu will shit bricks when he finds out about you and what you‚Äôre doing, he‚Äôll make you an S-Rank out of spite

UA-Spy: more like ‚Äòhe‚Äôll make sure no one will ever hear about me‚Äô

SmallMight: stop being a smartass and figuring me out like that

HandyMan: so?

CatProvider: Decay - A-Rank. Mustard - B-Rank. Gremlin - A-Rank. 

HandyMan: YES

FuckSchool: C‚Äômon what do I have to do to catch up with Decay

HandyMan: kill 100 people in 3 minutes?

FuckSchool: fair

CatProvider: Mindscrew - B-Rank. Dabi - A-Rank. Spinner - B-Rank.

SneakyGecko: dammit

Insomniac: so first I keep hearing that my quirk is villainous and then it turns out it‚Äôs not flashy enough to get noticed when I turned to villainy

Insomniac: life isn‚Äôt fair

HandyMan: yes, suffer

BurnBurnBurn: guess I‚Äôm an A-Rank for messing up Endeawhore alone since I did nothing else that was memorable

SmallMight: apparently

BurnBurnBurn: even after ruining him and seeing him dead I end up getting a high rank because of HIM

BurnBurnBurn: shit

SmallMight: we‚Äôll work on that, don‚Äôt worry

BurnBurnBurn: thx

CatProvider: Zealot is a C-Rank. The rest remains as it was (me and Vampire A-Ranks, Stain S-Rank and Legion is SS-Rank). 

DeusVult: ‚Ä¶

SmallMight: I think they still didn‚Äôt figure out what your quirk is and that it was you who did Purge in

SmallMight: they are going to move you all the way up to an A-Rank at once when they see you pulverize a villain with a punch

SmallMight: don‚Äôt worry

DeusVult: thanks

FuckSchool: he speaks!

VampirePrincess: he speaks!

HandyMan: he speaks!

SneakyGecko: he speaks!

BurnBurnBurn: traitor

SneakyGecko: no u

PurgeTheFakes: Izuku, we need to talk. Face to face.

 

***

 

Despite the fact that Stain was a bit like an uncle to him, Izuku was still reasonably cautious when in the presence of the Hero Killer. That man was dangerous, and while their thoughts aligned on many fields, he was still a bit of a wildcard. 

A wildcard AND the most dangerous of Izuku‚Äôs assets. Decay might have excelled in annihilating crowds of people and Vampire was an apt assassin and spy, but Stain would have promptly dispatched of them both if they went after him. He didn‚Äôt receive an S-Rank classification for being scary looking. 

‚ÄúIs that about the drawing on the fridge?‚Äù Izuku tries to turn to humour when he enters and decides that he isn‚Äôt sure how to read the look on Stain‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that Eri didn‚Äôt draw you in a scary enough way, but she‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúJust stop.‚Äù Stain replies with a sigh. ‚ÄúAnd tell me why are we going after villains so much?‚Äù 

Ah, so it‚Äôs THAT talk, Izuku thinks. It was going to happen sooner or later, he knew about it. It‚Äôs also the moment that decides whether Stain stays with the League.

‚ÄúI thought you were alright with slaying those fakes that joined CRC?‚Äù He asks. Let‚Äôs nab the subject bit by bit, instead of going for the throat. 

‚ÄúOf course I was.‚Äù Stain now looks at Izuku as if the smart kid he knew turned dumbass when nobody was looking. ‚ÄúYou know what I mean, so stop beating around the bush.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù Izuku replies. Stain wants the throat, so he gets the throat. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because my plans changed a bit when I found out that Lemillion inherited All Might‚Äôs quirk.‚Äù He can see the ‚ÄòOh?‚Äô on Stain‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúI thought that he wouldn‚Äôt pass it over, thinking that it served its purpose. So I seeked to dismantle the country into some postapocalyptic wasteland, because that was honestly a better option than having his quirk die out and no hero strong enough to keep Re:Destro, Eclipse and so on at bay.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs your plan now?‚Äù Stain is unexpectedly tranquil. Izuku is on guard because of that. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mostly the same plan, actually?‚Äù Izuku can see a shadow of confusion on Stain‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúBut the difference is that I confirmed that UA faculty is honest in its heroic convictions and is ready to fight to make heroes into true heroes. Which means that there is a genuine alternative to the HPSC on the heroes side. There is also the part where Lemillion will grow strong enough to become a new Symbol of Peace, if given enough time. But it also means that All Might will grow weaker quickly, and‚Ä¶ honestly speaking, I think that Japan has a 50/50 chance of surviving the transition. There is going to be a war. If the QLF didn‚Äôt start it already. But now I think that there is something worth saving in the current society.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù Stain is interested. Probably. The man is unreadable. 

‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm going to dismantle the villain groups I don‚Äôt like.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúWhile leaving the villain groups I like‚Ä¶ under the better version of my father‚Äôs empire. My version.‚Äù That took Stain off-guard. They did have a talk about who All for One was, and he knows that Izuku wasn‚Äôt super happy about his dad‚Äôs methods, and this‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúBut before I can take up the mantle of the Symbol of Evil I need to clean up the rabid remnants of my dad‚Äôs times. I can‚Äôt control the world of villains from the shadows when it‚Äôs tearing itself apart‚Ä¶ and I can‚Äôt control the society from the shadows when the society is on fire.‚Äù 

It was... quite unexpected to him that Stain was the first person he talked to about it. Even his own girlfriend was yet to find out. It was a recent development. His meeting with Lemillion and the discovery of what Eclipse was up to has changed a lot of things. 

Then again‚Ä¶ Stain inspired Izuku‚Äôs personal outlook on heroism a lot, even without the Hero Killer knowing. In a way, Stain was his idol. Unlike All Might (and like his own father) though, Izuku‚Äôs approach to Stain was problematic. Izuku tried to separate All for One as a father from All for One as a villain, and similarly he had to partially separate Stain the Villain and Stain the Demagogue. 

Stain killed too many heroes. Some of them didn‚Äôt deserve it - they should have their career‚Äôs ruined, yes, but killing was going too far. So while Izuku subscribed to the general idea that there were way too many fake heroes around, he was much less happy about Stain‚Äôs methods. 

Which is why he only tried to kill people like Endeavor and Thunderbolt, who were too powerful to be taken down non-lethally. Dabi‚Äôs revelations wouldn‚Äôt be enough to destroy the former - the HPSC would still rescue him if he survived Hosu, he was too powerful and useful to be sent to jail. The CRC fallen heroes were mostly collateral, in that Izuku didn‚Äôt consider them to be primary targets. The entire base was one big primary target. They just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. 

Hearing Lemillion‚Äô analysis and the fact that Nedzu seemed to learn the lesson for now changed things even more. The idea of Legion being a hero-villain‚Ä¶ It was, somewhat, true. And if it was true, then he could as well act on it properly. With intent and will, instead of mere afterthought and unconscious wiggling. 

If spending time with Stain teached him anything, it was that you either went all-out once you decided on something or didn‚Äôt bother trying at all. His father‚Äôs inheritance was an asset that could help him achieve the goal. Why should he shy away from using it? 

‚ÄúSo you are interested in Lemillion‚Ä¶ because he is going to be your very own nemesis.‚Äù Stain says. It‚Äôs not a question, more like an observation. 

‚ÄúMore like an antithesis.‚Äù Izuku shrugs. ‚ÄúIf the collapse of my father‚Äôs empire is any indication, bad order is still better than chaos. He was a monster, but he kept things ordered. All Might is his polar opposite who tried to achieve the same thing. Symbol of Peace to oppose the Symbol of Evil. He knows that people need symbols. This is why the heroes honest to the word gathered around him and around the UA. And why the fakes all crowded around the Hero Commission and its president, the unofficial Symbol of Corruption. When ideologies are in conflict, the people develop convictions and dedication to their causes. And this is my plan.‚Äù

Stain understands. And laughs. There is pride and interest in his laughter. 

‚ÄúSo you will dismantle the Hero Commission to get rid of fake heroes.‚Äù He says with his eyes gleaming. ‚ÄúMaking those worthy of the title band around the new Symbol of Peace. All of that while dismantling the current villain groups, too dangerous and uncontrollable to continue existing. And when they are gone‚Ä¶ your name will become the rallying cry of the remaining villains. The ones that you will allow to exist.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd thus I will become the new Symbol of Evil.‚Äù Izuku smiles. ‚ÄúThe polar opposite to Lemillion and whoever the next holder of the One for All will be. When the society will be working as it should, my resources will be limited and the Symbol of Peace will be triumphing. When peace and prosperity begin to wane, leaving people downtrodden and seeking a different world, I‚Äôll be there to guide them‚Ä¶ and force the country to change. Or change it myself. I will create a world where heroes are heroes and villains are villains. Where fakes will be an exception and not a rule.‚Äù Izuku smiles at his uncle. ‚ÄúSo will you become my blade, Uncle Stain?‚Äù 

Stain stares at him for a few seconds. Izuku doesn‚Äôt feel intimidated. Not anymore. And finally, the Hero Killer speaks.

‚ÄúWhen I heard you talk about your ideals for the first time after we met again, I actually considered slaughtering the League. You included. ‚ÄúStain says, genuinely surprising Izuku. ‚ÄúYou talked a lot, and there was a clear dedication to your ideas‚Ä¶ but what about that? I could feel how immature you were deep enough. You were incredibly smart, reasonably ruthless and had resources - the soil was perfect, yet what grew in it was mismatched. Almost‚Ä¶ fake.‚Äù 

Izuku didn‚Äôt expect Stain to describe him in such words. It was a lethal thing for most people. But Stain didn‚Äôt stop talking.

‚ÄùYou considered yourself to have the ironclad determination and goal, but something was missing in both.‚Äù The Hero Killer continues. ‚ÄúSome crucial element. But you were and are young, so I decided to give you a chance. So I tagged along, to see what was going to sprout from the seed that I saw in you. You took down Endeavor, and massacred the Clan‚Ä¶ both great moves, but in both I saw you lacking. There was strength and smarts there, but you didn‚Äôt seem to know where you were heading to. You showed me a mess of disjointed lines where you promised a drawing, random acts instead of a clear strategy to achieve your goals. You, perhaps unconsciously, were trying to find an answer for yourself.‚Äù

Stain pauses for a few seconds. Part of Izuku expects his sword to suddenly behead him. But this doesn‚Äôt happen. 

‚ÄúMy decision to wait was the correct one, it seems.‚Äù Stain smiles. His smile is in equal part terrifying and reassuring. ‚ÄúThe seed finally sprouted. You finally see the big picture. You finally have a true goal in your life. One that you will follow until you die‚Ä¶ or until you reach it. Your eyes are no longer clouded with indecisiveness when you talk about your father‚Äôs heritage and about your own villainous career. I see no indecisiveness in you at all. And because of that‚Ä¶‚Äù Their eyes meet. ‚Äú... the answer is yes. I‚Äôll be your blade, because you are finally worthy of wielding me. Let‚Äôs murder Eclipse together.‚Äù 

(Somewhere in Japan an old hero has the same nightmare as he sometimes has. The ruined island, his nemesis‚Ä¶ and his teacher and mentor, telling him to run before facing the monster alone, giving Sorahiko time to take him to safety. But this time, there is another figure besides the All for One. Unfortunately, the hero fails to remember the nightmare - all that remembers is the faint feeling of dread after waking up, that he shakes off promptly)
Notes:

    Objectively speaking, the ending of the next chapter has several times more shocking plottwist than Izuku deciding to embrace his father's heritage and become an inheritor of All for One in more meaning than the quirk. Good luck guessing what happens then :P

Chapter 20: Resurrection
Summary:

    Plot earthquake incoming. But first, some fluff.

    Also FIVE HUNDRED KUDOS, damn. Things are going pretty nice. STILL PLEASE NOTICE THAT I HAVE TWO MORE STORIES HERE AND THEY NEED SOME LOVE TOO :V

Notes:

    ALRIGHT I WAS REPEATEDLY ASKED ABOUT ECLIPSE QUIRK SO IT'S TIME TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU. Because it kinda doesn't happen (at least in detail) in the story.

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZlHD0v_J_Q I was initially inspired to create when I saw this music piece, or to be exact, the accompanying image. You see that floaty black-with-yellow-edges bit behind her? Eclipse can generate and control multiple similar surfaces, which carry the properties of any surface she wants to from her vicinity. Of about 25cm of said surface. If she is walking on concrete floor, she can generate floating disks, each of which is an equivalent of 25cm of concrete.

    Also fun fact - those are just surface. There are two-dimensional. This makes their edges into monomolecular blades capable of slicing through practically everything. Yes, it would go through All Might like a hot knife through butter. And then she had a quirk awakening and figured out how to give her surface properties of an area of space (say, air) from different place altogether, essentially creating a warpgate between her current position and said place.

    This is why late-bloomers are so feared in-universe. Her quirk showing up elevated her from small-time quirkless terrorist into a nightmare that will murder (instantly or almost instantly) most heroes out there. In 1vs 1 the only heroes that can win against her are Hawks (her quirk offers her a lot of defenses, but it's not omnidirectional and his feathers might find their target between the surface shields), Thunderbolt (if she is on the ground, he could knock her out instantly before giving her time to realize that an attack is incoming), Endeavor (unless she drags him somewhere where there are some highly fire-resistant surfaces to operate, he would probably win through brute force and melting through her surfaces), and All Might (strong enough to shatter her shields, quick enough to avoid getting cut in half, at least probably).

    There is a reason why the whole League is ambushing her at once, 'ya know.

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

FuckSchool: So‚Ä¶ this actually happened?

HandyMan: what

Insomniac: ???

SmallMight: what is it, I‚Äôm kinda busy atm?

FuckSchool: I just saw VampirePrincess moving your stuff from your room in the base to hers (you don‚Äôt have much here)

FuckSchool: So congrats?

Insomniac: normies

HandyMan: normies

FuckSchool: lol

SneakyGecko: victory for the complex mutant team

SneakyGecko: boss has an obviously good taste 

SmallMight: we spend so much time cuddling together in the evenings that we can as well make it official instead of sneaking around the hallways at night, it makes kurogiri somewhat jumpy

FuckSchool: ‚Äòcuddling‚Äô? really

HandyMan: we are reaching dangerous level of normies

FuckSchool: honestly I can kinda imagine you two actually cuddling in the evening since moving to something spicy makes you blow smoke from ears and lay there unconscious

CatProvider: I wish to inform you that something akin to that just happened. VampirePrincess just checked her phone and is currently incapacitated in my bar.

CatProvider: Please stop incapacitating my wards in my bar. 

FuckSchool: yeah what unclegiri said [also just call her your daughter, we all know that you adopted her and Tenko and prob. UA-Spy in all but legal terms]

SmallMight: please stop investigating my lovelife

SmallMight: there is little to investigate aside from her teasing me while being unfailingly encouraging and listening to my mumblings

HandyMan: let‚Äôs be real, we lost the boss to the 3d woman when he made a theory about her quirk being a mutant one

HandyMan: he said that only her having children can confirm his quirk theory

HandyMan: so they started to working on that

FuckSchool: LOL

Insomniac: ouch

SmallMight: WHAT, NO 

SmallMight: TENKO STOP DOING THAT

HandyMan: revenge is nice, Player Two

HandyMan: I like its taste

CatProvider: I look forward to babysitting your children, @SmallMight.

SmallMight: traitorgiri 

SmallMight: you just want grandchildren and you gave up on Tenko

HandyMan: yes, 2D only, sorry

SmallMight: and also please no I‚Äôm having my 17th birthday in like a week, I‚Äôm too young to have children ._. dad was like a two centuries old before he decided to have exactly one

SneakyGecko: isn‚Äôt two centuries a bit too much of an overexaggeration, how old was he really

CatProvider: It‚Äôs hard to say something about his father without making it sound like an overexaggeration.

BurnBurnBurn: Hmmm?

SmallMight: yes, I should probably explain some things soon to the new members (Stain knows, but other than that, nope), especially as Nedzu figured out most of it

SmallMight: Unclegiri, are Zealot, Spinner and Dabi in the bar rn

CatProvider: Depends.

SmallMight: On?

CatProvider: Are you going to properly and legally marry @VampirePrincess at the first possible moment instead of staying an eternal boyfriend? 

FuckSchool: oh wow papagiri takes no prisoners

FuckSchool: no mercy for the boy messing with his daughter

Insomniac: why is SmallMight silent so long

HandyMan: he is probably getting steamed by what‚Äôs coming from his ears

HandyMan: like she is

HandyMan: normies

Insomniac: normies

Fuckschool: lol

 

***

 

SneakyGecko: okay so we are now among those who know

SneakyGecko: and well

BurnBurnBurn: i can barely compute

DeusVult: yes

FuckSchool: it gets easier to think about after a week or so of having your view on life tilted upside down

SneakyGecko: I see

SneakyGecko: to know that quirk thief exists AND he is boss‚Äô dad, wow

SneakyGecko: I mean it kinda explains why he is so much into quirks I think?

SneakyGecko: it‚Äôs pretty cool if bone-chilling scary

SmallMight: I actually wanted to make an announcement concerning that

SmallMight: I know I should be saying this face to face but I want to have it said and done before the battle, which is tomorrow, and I‚Äôm currently inspecting the battlefield with Stain

SmallMight: giving him a disguise that people don‚Äôt see through is what makes me look up to VampirePrincess as a true master of disguises and infiltration

FuckSchool: I NEED TO SEE THE PICTURES

PurgeTheFakes: Only if you want to die.

FuckSchool: I no longer want to see the pictures.

SmallMight: So, it‚Äôs the hour that you are all active in, so I shall just say it and then mention details in person

SmallMight: I‚Äôve made a decision that the best way of proceeding with the League of Villains‚Äô goals is for me to actually become my father‚Äôs successor AND a new Symbol of Evil (pretentious but there is something intimidating at it I guess)

FuckSchool: what

UA-Spy: Nedzu is going to have a heart attack xDD if he has a heart, sources disagree

HandyMan: so guildmaster is going to ascend to godhood at the end of this questline

HandyMan: cool

SneakyGecko: oh

Insomniac: so you are no longer touchy about his methods?

Insomniac: I‚Äôm not even going to guess how many people he killed or worse in his life

SmallMight: methods will change, idea of becoming the villain equivalent of the Symbol of Peace did not

SmallMight: Father‚Äôs ‚Äòdeath‚Äô caused years of chaos throughout the country. I want to clean up the overly ambitious rabble, pick up who is sane enough to work with (Mr. Compress is pretty cool for example, and he isn‚Äôt trying to drown the country in blood)

SmallMight: once Nedzu dismantles the Hero Commission, we‚Äôll have a world of black and white, as Uncle Stain would like to

SmallMight: villains versus heroes, each with their own leader, to keep things balanced

Insomniac: as all things should be

SmallMight: nerd

SmallMight: The biggest change will be to the methods

SmallMight: I mean, let‚Äôs be real

SmallMight: I‚Äôm not going to pull a ‚Äòyou have outlived your usefulness‚Äô on Tenko for failing at something and then give his op pls nerf quirk to someone else to turn them into a fanatically loyal tool

HandyMan: ok normie

SmallMight: don‚Äôt test me pls xD

SmallMight: The point is, you are my friends.

VampirePrincess: or more

SmallMight: yes, Tenko is best friend

VampirePrincess: ;_;

SmallMight: I might be pulling this shit on other groups that will end up as our satellite organizations

SmallMight: but League is and will be something else

SmallMight: trust, honesty and camaraderie for the win

SmallMight: some of you (MissExplosion, FuckSchool, DeusVult, BurnBurnBurn) have joined us with a goal in mind

SmallMight: for those who don‚Äôt know: MissExplosion (destroying Detnerat Corporation for what it did to her family), FuckSchool (taking revenge on their ‚Äòheroic‚Äô parent for abandonment), DeusVult (annihilation of Creature Rejection Clan and death of Purity), BurnBurnBurn (Endeavor = Endeawhore, now and forever). 

Insomniac: let‚Äôs not comment on how this entire line is pretty much ‚ÄòI have problems and it‚Äôs about my parents‚Äô just in several different versions, because tbh we all wouldn‚Äôt be here if not for the bad parenting

SmallMight: yeah I‚Äôm not touching that subject with a fifty feet pole encased in barbed wire

VampirePrincess: also let‚Äôs not comment how many of said parents ended up being killed by us (or, in some cases, are on the chopping block to get killed by us), because honestly, I‚Äôm not sure if I want to join such a T-shirt club

SmallMight: jesus fucking christ I‚Äôm sending you all to a group therapy after Eclipse, now stop derailing the convo

UA-Spy: Hey, my parents are alright!

SmallMight: your parents are dead

UA-Spy: ok, so my parents WERE alright, stop complaining about my grammar, you‚Äôre not Present Mic

Insomniac: keep derailing the convo and boss will change him into a Past Mic

FuckSchool: LOL

SmallMight: OKAY STOP WITH AN OFF-TOP I‚ÄôM HAVING AN IMPORTANT MOMENT HERE DAMMIT

SmallMight: alright so

SmallMight: I only got one of this objectives completed, but let me be honest here and now

SmallMight: the second you joined us, those goals became my goals. Even if you die or are incarcerated, I will continue working on fulfilling your wishes in your stead. You‚Äôre part of the League, you are my friends, you are pretty much family. That‚Äôs enough for me. 

SmallMight: Others might be here because they are my friends and just want to see my own goals fulfilled (the exception is a certain person who has thoroughly objectified me into being her exclusive bloodbag), but the logic persists. for as long as you are part of the League, you are part of the family (leaving is ok, family members sometimes do that, just don‚Äôt betray us to the heroes/other villains and you are free to do that at any moment)

SmallMight: some have their motivations a bit harder to describe (Insomniac just wants to see the world burn, let‚Äôs be honest here and PurgeTheFakes is PurgeTheFakes), but it‚Äôs still alright

PurgeTheFakes: my goal is you achieving your goals, we had that talk already

UA-Spy: Same

SmallMight: yeah, thank you :D 

VampirePrincess: what was that about the bloodbag

SmallMight: savour the taste, we‚Äôre testing the way your body operates while blood-deprived after Eclipse is dead

VampirePrincess: shit

VampirePrincess: but why

SmallMight: because I want to

VampirePrincess: so you want to see me squirm in pain, begging you for release? kinky

SmallMight: what

FuckSchool: busted

SmallMight: TIME OUT I‚Äôm not having that talk with you, back to the main subject,

VampirePrincess: awww

SmallMight: So is there anyone who has issues with me becoming (at some point in the future, a lot of work before us) a shadow emperor of the Japanese underworld? Or questions?

CatProvider: Does your father know you changed your mind?

SmallMight: No and I plan to keep it that way until I get the organizational framework set up. We might have some achievements, but we don‚Äôt even have any group loyal to us except for DoctorEvil but I don‚Äôt trust him and want him dead asap. 

SmallMight: I have an idea how to change it very soon, but we need to deal with Eclipse first.

MissExplosion: I sense lots of occasions for babymaking.

SmallMight: When we get the basics set up, I‚Äôm going to get you an exclusive sub-organization (probably working through Giran and/or Villain Network) dedicated to providing high quality support items and outfits to the villains from subsidiary groups. 

MissExplosion: H A T S U M E   I N D U S T R I E S   L I V E S   A G A I N

MissExplosion: now I really want to have a baby with you

Insomniac: for the first time in forever I‚Äôm not sure what she means by baby

Insomniac: it is incredibly confusing

VampirePrincess: :3 I‚Äôm interested, we need to have a girl talk about it

SmallMight: stop trying to build me a harem only because I decided to become a shadow emperor of Japan

VampirePrincess: awww, but it would be sooo sexy, more is better, think of all the things we could to do together

Insomniac: normies

SmallMight: normies

HandyMan: normies

HandyMan: wait what

Insomniac: THERE IS A SPY AMONG US

HandyMan: SmallMight is sus

FuckSchool: I suspect that this was a reference to some antique game but I‚Äôm not a nerd so I‚Äôm not sure

HandyMan: yes

UA-Spy: Can I be there (or see the recording) for the moment when Eraserhead, All Might, Nedzu and Sir Nighteye figure out that their pet bloody vigilante group is actually All for One‚Äôs second coming and they helped it rise with their regular favours exchange? Pitch in Gran Torino and Lemillion for additional degree of laugh

SmallMight: oh yeah this is going to be a hilarious moment xD we gotta record it to laugh about it together

SmallMight: they think that AlO was a deadbeat dad and I‚Äôm dismantling his organization as a form of teenage rebellion xD they don‚Äôt know how many times my mom had to stop him from physically demolishing the school and crucifying tortured yet still breathing teachers on its ruins for allowing kids to bully me

SneakyGecko: is that like a metaphor

CatProvider: His father would do it. No doubts about it. He did worse things for much lesser reasons.

SmallMight: imagine AllMight but morally tilted towards being as evil as he is good

SneakyGecko: oh shit

SmallMight: My father is EVIL. You don‚Äôt get called Symbol of Evil without that (I‚Äôm going to have to redefine the term a bit before taking it ;v) 

SmallMight: which is why I‚Äôm happy he retired and I‚Äôm not doing the same scary stuff as he did. also he adores my little sister so much that he actually starts acting like a reasonable human being due to that. My sister‚Äôs cuteness is a Class-Six quirk you can‚Äôt change my mind

VampirePrincess: not going to try, she just smiled at me and I began to consider going to the nearest police precinct and turning myself in, just to make the world a better (and less villainous) place for her

VampirePrincess: that smile. that damn smile

SneakyGecko: I‚Äôm increasingly worried

SmallMight: Eraserhead was right about me disagreeing with dad on moral grounds and not sharing his malevolence, but that‚Äôs all he got right

SmallMight: if no more questions for now, go to sleep

SmallMight: we‚Äôre killing Eclipse tomorrow, you have to be in your full strength

HandyMan: the raid boss is going down

The operation started as it should. Then it immediately derailed into complete chaos. 

Eclipse had a bit above nine hundred soldiers and twenty-three tanks (plus two self-propelled missile launchers armed with the gas) on standby in the base. High morale, people were really heated up by the string of victories and a single tie (she is going to skin Miruko and Gang Orca at some point in the future for that). The idea of attacking Musutafu was met with an ovation. 

She used her quirk to summon a surface and connect it to the Musutafu‚Äôs main square, right next to the local governmental office. She stepped through it (she can only teleport herself or summon others to her), noticing something was strange with it but not to a point where the warping failed. Like always, she makes herself float atop one of her surfaces, nothing is more attention-grabbing than floating menacingly above the crowd you are about to slaughter.

 And then the plan dies. Screaming. 

She expects a bunch of civilians minding their own business (and immediately going into a total panic once they see her) and probably several local heroes. They would attack her immediately, hoping to delay the gas and give the civilians time to flee, but‚Ä¶ Kamui Woods, Mt. Lady and Death Arms aren‚Äôt actually that powerful. She could deal with all three at once. In a manner of seconds.

And that‚Äôs without counting the army that would join her in a minute.

Instead she sees the last civilians fleeing from the square, an absolute lack of heroes around‚Ä¶ and several figures that she recognizes as members of the League of Villains scattered in front of her. 

Then she finds out that she can‚Äôt open a gate for her soldiers to pour in. 

‚ÄúMy name is Legion and we are the League of Villains.‚Äù The figure in the All Might hoodie standing behind the crowd, right next to the League‚Äôs warpgate, announces. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve decided to interrupt your assault on Musutafu in order to punish you for stealing our kill. And end your irritating rampage.‚Äù Legion sighs and adds in a different voice. ‚ÄúDestroying cities is bad for business, you see.‚Äù 

Of course the kid was pissed off by it. Chronostasis was right - Legion IS a revenge-freak. And she just, as he said, ‚Äòmade it personal‚Äô. She should have listened to her second-in-command a bit more. 

Oh well. She just has to kill them all and find whatever machine or a person is deactivating her warp. Then she can resume her attack on the town.

‚ÄúI heard that you were a late-bloomer.‚Äù She says confidently. She knows her skills. She battled many pro-heroes. She only took down Endeavor in his depowered state because of the delicious irony - the flame hero flaunted the strength of his quirk, so she slew him in front of millions in a state of de-facto quirklessness. She was confident she was at least his equal. And he would massacre the League if Stain didn‚Äôt catch him off-guard. ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you be at least somewhat amenable to the Front‚Äôs goals?‚Äù She uses the time to scan the area. 

Perhaps the heroes will arrive, turning this into a melee-a-trois. Legion is a good planner, she knows that well enough. Chronostasis AND recent League‚Äôs actions are a good proof of that. If she buys enough time for the heroes to arrive, she can take advantage of chaos. 

She sees nothing that could be a warp suppression machine. But she also doesn‚Äôt see their engineer. Suspicious. 

‚ÄúOh, but I am amenable to your goals!‚Äù Legion says with a cheerful voice. ‚ÄúJust not to your methods. Do you have the tiniest idea how many quirkless kids has their bullying intensify each time you commit a mass-murder? Then again, that‚Äôs probably a feature, not a bug. I mean, the more they are bullied, the more likely they are to join the Front. Am I right?‚Äù 

Did he just suggest that‚Ä¶ Eclipse is beyond furious. She is going to murder every single League member. Brutally. Perhaps she will take some alive and have them tortured. She spent two decades fighting a war against people treating quirkless as subhumans, and she isn‚Äôt taking words like that face down. 

‚ÄúYou sh‚Ä¶‚Äù Suddenly, she freezes. Quirk. Mental. Is it Mindscrew‚Äôs? She can see him, standing before Legion with a rifle. Eye contact?

‚Äú Remain stationary for the next ten seconds. ‚Äù She hears his voice. Stain throws knives at her, Mindscrew pulls up his rifle. She didn‚Äôt survive her childhood as a quirkless without a willpower of steel. She promptly shatters the quirk. Surfaces (round and black with yellow edges, she made it look like that to fit her villain name) block the attacks. 

She isn‚Äôt going to get caught like that again. 

‚ÄúThis is cheating.‚Äù She hears someone, probably Mindscrew, say. ‚ÄúHow did you do that?‚Äù She is about to respond with a taunt, when suddenly she has a breakthrough.

Is it vocal response-based brainwashing? Mindscrew and Legion were both wearing masks, and she knew that Legion‚Äôs was a voice changer‚Ä¶ does that mean‚Ä¶

Oh, those sly kids. It was Mindscrew who taunted her earlier, placed in front of the Legion so she wouldn‚Äôt recognize that fact. She isn‚Äôt falling for it anymore, she will stay silent for the rest of the battle. 

She stands there, on a floating surface, summoning several more. Her limit is fifteen, but when she gets close to it, she has problems overseeing all of them at once. She flings two at Legion, but he dodges - her control is so-so at a distance, too, so she fails to make the surfaces follow him. 

They are two-dimensional. You can stand on them, or connect two (even distant) surfaces, but their edges slice through all matter. They are essentially monomolecular circular saw-blades. Her quirk is powerful, like it‚Äôs common for the late bloomers.

One of the nearest League members suddenly triples in size and lunges at her. She reacts instantly. She fought Re-Destro once and managed to bring it to a tie, she knows how to deal with strength enhancers. She reacts in time and stops the punch with four surfaces arrayed one after another. 

The punch shatters three of those. 

That‚Äôs a dangerous level of strength. That villain (she faintly remembers him, what was the name, Zealot?) has strength approaching Re-Destro‚Äôs. There are more punches after it, as his speed is decidedly inhuman. She summons her surfaces fast enough to compensate, but it occupies most of her attention. 

Stain is throwing knives at her from the side. His knives are connected with him with a thread. He can recover them easily once they bounce off one of her surfaces. She can‚Äôt teleport them elsewhere because her warp doesn‚Äôt work, and he is reacting fast enough that she can‚Äôt use her surfaces to slice the line. She would have to give up on defending for a few seconds to muster the response, and she knows that Mindscrew with his rifle is waiting for it. 

They have her pinned down. 

She doesn‚Äôt like that. 

Decay and Vampire are the closest, but they aren‚Äôt attacking. She is too high for them - they are probably going to lunge at her if the surface she is using as her footing vanishes. They will overwhelm her if she drops to the ground, forcing her to maintain that surface. She can‚Äôt even move, because flying around would interrupt her concentration. 

Their mere presence is enough to immobilize her. It also costs her one of her surfaces. She knows that Legion is a good quirk analyst, but this is getting ridiculous. 

Risks sometimes have to be taken. She summons another surface and sends it on a semi-circle route. She almost decapitates Zealot, but he dodges. Mindscrew - the end-point of the semi-circle - has much less luck. The surface cuts his rifle and hand in half. His arm is half-split vertically. 

He screams. The blood gushes from the wound. One down. Unless Legion gets him to the League‚Äôs healer instantly, he will bleed out soon. Just don‚Äôt answer taunts, and Mindscrew is useless. 

He is no longer shooting her, so she can amass three surfaces. Stain dodges the incoming blades easily, but he doesn‚Äôt expect her to tilt the nearest at the last second. The wide side of her surface impacts him and throws him back. Knives were dealt with, at least for now. 

Spinner, Dabi, Mustard and Gremlin. Where are they? Mustard is probably useless (she is wearing a full-body suit with an air filtration system, and he has a gas quirk). The lizard is equally useless in this battle, he is practically a weak Stain. Dabi and Gremlin are left. 

Where are they? Legion wouldn‚Äôt attack her with half of his squad. There is a plan in the works, and she is yet to figure it out.

Stain stands up. That man is made from steel, she knows that much. His eyes are maniacal. He draws his sword. 

She survives the execution of Legion‚Äôs plan by accident. 

She is looking in the right direction and she can see a sudden burst of light in the distance, on what looks like an apartment complex a few clicks from her position. Her instincts save her life - she arrays enough surfaces for them to intercept the incoming round, despite it shattering most of them. 

It wasn‚Äôt a sniper rifle. Whatever it was, it packed enough punch that she would expect it from a heavy artillery round. It was a small caliber, but the impact was enormous. So extremely high velocity, and that blink of light‚Ä¶ 

Realization strikes. Did Gremlin just fire a RAILGUN at her? Holy fuck. Those kids are crazy. If she didn‚Äôt stop the round, it would probably pierce one or two buildings behind her.

Eclipse now knows the engineer‚Äôs position. If her hunch is correct, the missing League members are with her. She doesn‚Äôt know how long Gremlin will be reloading, but she needs to move over and kill the engineer before that happens. But before that‚Ä¶

She manages to sever Zealot‚Äôs arm with a vertical slice. The hulking monstrosity stops for a few seconds, and she almost manages to decapitate it, but it jumps back. 

Stain charges in her direction. He quickly catches up with Decay and Vampire, but it doesn‚Äôt matter anymore. Mindscrew falls on the ground, probably about to bleed out. 

Finally, she is free. She can move! She will now murder them all, one by one. Mindscrew is dying, Zealot is pushed back, she can hide behind a building so no more railguns from Gremlin, she can keep Stain at bay and all that‚Äôs left are pure melee fighters that she can rain death on from above! She will‚Ä¶  

Suddenly, she feels a slight pinch in her right side. 

‚ÄúCheckmate.‚Äù Legion announces. 

She looks down to see a small cloud of blackness floating right next to her‚Ä¶ and a small and somewhat mismatched and distorted syringe bullet dug deep into her suit. 

There is another cloud of blackness right next to Legion. And he points at it with some sort of pistol that she completely overlooked during the fight, and‚Ä¶

Her mind makes a connection. 

‚ÄúNO!‚Äù She screams while her quirk stops working. She falls down‚Ä¶ where knives are waiting.

Blueberry (she kinda adopted that nickname as her official name, sue her about it) is twenty years old. She is also acutely aware that she will not live until her twenty-first birthday, as she was just dragged into Chronostasis office together with her three friends that she planned to escape with. 

They are all beaten up. The QLF members that made the arrest didn‚Äôt take their betrayal lightly. They had orders to keep them alive for interrogation, but they weren‚Äôt going to be delicate. 

Chronostasis is there. Wearing his gas mask and breathing in a loud and sometimes pained way. Shigeko once compared him to some ‚ÄòDarth Vader‚Äô character from a pre-quirk film she once watched, just with a different colour palette and normal clothes. 

‚ÄúLeave us be.‚Äù He says, and their captors vanish from the room. The four of them lie on the ground in front of Chronostasis desk, bruised, battered and cuffed. ‚ÄúYou know, I have to thank you for what you did.‚Äù 

Blueberry isn‚Äôt sure if she heard that right. 

‚ÄúEclipse was‚Ä¶ problematic to deal with.‚Äù Chronostasis says, before making a particularly laboured breath. ‚ÄúBut you sold her to the League of Villains. And they just took her down. In a way that didn‚Äôt damage the‚Ä¶ uuuuugh‚Ä¶ other assets of the Front. That now belongs to me.‚Äù 

League of Villains? Her childhood friend knew the LEAGUE OF VILLAINS?! Why didn‚Äôt he‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúI planned to make an example out of‚Ä¶ uuuuuugh‚Ä¶ you.‚Äù Chronostasis continues. He is visibly tired and hunched over, half-resting on the desk behind him. ‚ÄúI allowed your ridiculous rebellion to continue long enough to take Eclipse out of the picture. But I changed my mind. Izuku is‚Ä¶ ‚Äú He coughs furiously for a few seconds. ‚ÄúIzuku is doing well. Too well. And revenge‚Ä¶ I love revenge. I‚Äôm going to kill him, but why not make him know of that beforehand? Psychological damage‚Ä¶ yes, that‚Äôs gonna be great.‚Äù He laughs slightly. There is a sick tint to his laughter. 

‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm letting you go.‚Äù Chronostasis adds, while pulling off his gas mask. Blueberry can see some smoke coming from it‚Ä¶ wait, was that an inhalator rather than a gas mask? ‚ÄúWith a message to Izuku.‚Äù 

He leans over terrified Blueberry. His body starts changing. Hives erupt on the exposed parts of his skin. She can see his eyes changing colour. Something bulges under his skin. His hair begins to turn black. His face‚Ä¶ twists and changes. 

He touches her hand. Something in her shifts. The bruises no longer hurt. Her broken arm fixes itself. That‚Äôs not his quirk, what just‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúTell him‚Ä¶‚Äù Blood bursts from Chronostasis‚Äôs mouth. He quietly puts his gas mask back on, and the grotesque changes she just saw began to slowly revert.  ‚ÄúTell him that even death cannot stop Overhaul.‚Äù
Notes:

    Look. It's not taken out of ass. The next chapter explains it in details.

    I'll just remind you rn that David Shield mentioned something about the 'potential to one day transplant quirks' through Overhaul's research and... does someone here remember what canon Vestiges are? :P Although judging from the state of Chronostasis, it's a rather faulty solution.

    Oh, and taking down Eclipse? Forcing a warp within warp interference radius is possible, but time consuming and suicidal for humans (as stated earlier). The whole battle was the League keeping Eclipse pinned down so that Kurogiri could open a shortcut into her blindspot so that Legion could fire one of the few remaining quirk supressing bullets that he had left from his brief fight against Overhaul in the past. After all, League has a use for living Eclipse...

Chapter 21: Reactions
Summary:

    Izuku's good mood is promptly ruined. And then he says a bit too much.

Notes:

(See the end of the chapter for notes.)
Chapter Text

The first thing Izuku does after their return warp to the hideout is to fix Mindscrew. Who decided to bleed to death when no one was looking. 

He has that awkward, slightly lost expression on his face. Everyone brought back from death has a face like that. It‚Äôs as if they saw somewhere while dead but now can‚Äôt recall it, and it makes them extremely confused. They get better after a good sleep and some distractions.

Himiko leads Mindscrew to the nearest couch (Kurogiri would have complained about blood smears but Hitoshi just literally died so he has some mercy), while Izuku fixes Zealot. Kurogiri warps in the second team. Gremlin is covered in soot and some slight burns (she probably forgot about safety measures and stood too close to her newest baby). 

Izuku fixes her too. He isn‚Äôt sure if she noticed that. 

Stain drags Eclipse to the dungeon. Izuku shot her with one of Overhaul‚Äôs old quirk suppressant bullets that he stole back then. Through Kurogiri‚Äôs minuscule warp that the League‚Äôs collective father figure managed to force open, taking advantage of Eclipse not knowing enough about warp quirk theory. 

The bullet came through messed up and looking weird, but the thing inside worked well enough. They weren‚Äôt going to trust the drug that was probably somewhat altered, so he told Stain to put a quirk-suppressing collar on her. 

He has plans concerning Eclipse. It actually kinda concerns her body mostly, but he doesn‚Äôt like double entendres like that. He has Himiko for that. 

‚ÄúThat was some nice raid boss.‚Äù Tenko announces after taking off his additional hands and putting them on a counter. ‚ÄúWent down quite fast, though.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDPS was off the roof.‚Äù Izuku replies with a loud chuckle. ‚ÄúI almost shat myself when I saw her chop off Zealot‚Äôs arm! Like holy shit, that guy‚Äôs built like a tank in this mode and she just sliced it off like it wasn‚Äôt there. Also‚Ä¶ ‚Äú He chuckles. ‚ÄúThe loot‚Äôs kinda awesome.‚Äù He knows JUST the thing to do with it. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so done with your MMO words, despite knowing it‚Äôs your coping mechanism for excess stress. It‚Äôs either that or swearing.‚Äù Mustard replies and sighs loudly. ‚ÄúCan someone come and tell me what I missed by being on watch duty next to that infernal engine of destruction?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou mean that railgun?‚Äù Himiko asks. 

‚ÄúGremlin.‚Äù Mustard deadpans. Chuckles in the room. Mei looks surprised and once again fails to figure out what they are all about. 

Kurogiri warps the railgun back to Mei's lab, so she flees away screaming about her ‚Äòbaby needing a medical check-up after its big day‚Äô. Midoriya Izuku decides that he isn‚Äôt paid enough to care.

He tells Kurogiri to warp to a designated pick-up coordinates, and bring Blueberry and her friends to the base. Their spy on the UA isn‚Äôt going to make it, so this is going to be a wild talk. Especially once he is still high on adrenaline.

Blueberry wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect from the secret base of the League of Villains. A fortress on some desolate wasteland (with lasers), some weird underground base resembling a bdsm sex dungeon (with a lot of chains and suffering prisoners) or some abandoned warehouse, perhaps? 

Instead she gets a combination between a rather stylish bar (with the spooky looking mist guy immediately moving there and taking his place behind the counter) and the living room in her parents‚Äô house (she doesn‚Äôt call it hers, because she didn‚Äôt belong there since she was diagnosed quirkless). 

Needless to say, Blueberry is confused. Or, she would be, but her mind‚Äôs capacity for confusion is occupied by Chronostasis and his transformation. And still being alive. 

She recognizes some faces. Mostly Legion and Stain, they are infamous. Hard to NOT recognize supervillains, especially when they are still wearing their villain outfits. She was never very much into villains, so others are unfamiliar. She does recognize Vampire, though. 

She is going to kill a certain someone for not mentioning that he is a friend with THE LEAGUE OF VILLAINS. Isn‚Äôt he in the heroics course? What the hell? 

Legion sees that her two friends are still wounded. He quickly jumps towards them (she almost dies of a heart attack when he does that) and touches them. Their wounds vanish. 

She is oddly familiar with that process. And he seems slightly surprised that it worked, strange.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù Legion, with his touch-based instakill (or instaheal, apparently) quirk is standing a meter away from her. She is frightened a bit - he IS a villain. She isn‚Äôt sure if she can count herself as a villain too, you need to have a quirk for that. Stupid law. ‚ÄúWhy the wounds?‚Äù 

‚ÄúChronostasis knew about us.‚Äù Blueberry replies. She is going to tackle the issue of her childhood friend‚Äôs choice in friends later. Now she prefers to answer quickly and concisely. ‚ÄúKept us around to get Eclipse out of the picture. We got arrested and had a meeting with him, after which he let us go.‚Äù 

Legion is confused. She isn‚Äôt alone in that state anymore.

‚ÄúChronostasis let you go, despite knowing that you are working for me?‚Äù He blinks at her a few times, in obvious daze. ‚ÄúWow, someone got a character development and some level ups when no one was looking.‚Äù

‚ÄúStop stealing my lines!‚Äù The gaunt man shouts from the background. Several others laugh. Only now Blueberry notes that most of the people in the room appear to be‚Ä¶ kids. Wow. Didn‚Äôt Chronostasis say that they took down Eclipse?!

Her friends stare around in shock. They are much more out of the loop than she is. She decides to be brave about it. Someone has to. 

‚ÄúDo you know of someone with a similar quirk to yours?‚Äù She asks Legion. He looks at her questioningly. ‚ÄúSomething really weird happened with Chronostasis and I‚Äôm still trying to process it.‚Äù She wants to be confused with the whole League business, but she is mentally still in Chronostasis‚Äôs office. 

‚ÄúNo one alive, why do you ask?‚Äù He is faintly intrigued. So she continues. 

‚ÄúChronostasis brought us to his office.‚Äù She starts narrating. ‚ÄúThen he did his villain monologue about using us to take down Eclipse. While having trouble breathing, because he always has trouble breathing.‚Äù Surprise is visible in the green eyes in front of her, Legion seems to have heard about it for the first time. ‚ÄúHe took off his gas mask at some point, which turned out to be some sort of inhalator. Then he started to change.‚Äú

‚ÄúChange?‚Äù She appears to have his full attention now. Which is quite nice (he is kinda cute, she has to admit, but it‚Äôs certainly not the time to even think about this). Honestly, how quickly did he manage to deescalate the fear? She doesn‚Äôt feel threatened, maybe save for Stain. He is VERY threatening. But at the back of the room. 

‚ÄúHives on the skin. Eye colour shifting. Even his hair started to turn black. It was terrifying.‚Äù She continues speaking. ‚ÄúThen he touched my skin, made my wounds vanish in an instant, coughed some blood, put back his mask and gave me a message to you.‚Äù She can see his face suddenly going paler. But onwards she goes. ‚ÄúSaid message is: ‚ÄòEven death cannot stop Overhaul.‚Äô‚Äù.

Legion, a supervillain and one of the most dangerous people in the country, faints on her. Or, more like, his legs just give up. Vampire leaps towards him and manages to grab him before his head has a traumatic meeting with the floor. The lizardman is right behind her. 

‚ÄúPapagiri, take them to their quarters!‚Äù Vampire shouts, while she and the lizard are dragging Legion towards the nearest couch. The black cloud behind the bar stops shifting threateningly and floats towards Blueberry. Stain is no longer staring at them with a scary face, he is livid in a way that almost makes Blueberry faint from fear.

‚ÄúI hate those fucking plottwists.‚Äù The gaunt man mumbles loud enough for Blueberry to hear. 

 

***

 

Himiko spends something like two hours consoling him before Izuku regains rudimentary ability to think cohesive sentences. 

Overhaul. The first man he ever killed. The idea of a maniacal villain that shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to live made flesh. The monster who tortured his beloved sister. The man whose quirk he stole, and killed in a particularly grizzly way as punishment for what he did to Eri. IS. ALIVE.

He might have overexaggerated the cohesive sentences part a bit. 

Worst of all, Izuku just gave him one of the largest terrorist organizations in the country on a silver platter. He is half convinced to free Eclipse just to screw with Overhaul, but if he truly did plan for it to happen‚Ä¶ Izuku is almost certain that Eclipse would be greatly surprised by how her brainwashed tools are now loyal to someone else. 

Her quirk might be great, but how many riflemen can she defend against at once? Bad match-up. 

How? How did all of that happen? He spent the last two hours being borderline comatose, with this question completely occupying his mind. He figured it out. He knows that there was nothing he could do to stop that, but‚Ä¶ 

He raises up, his head no longer resting on Himiko‚Äôs lap. Murdering Overhaul (this time for real) becomes an absolute priority. 

‚ÄúZuku, how do you feel?‚Äù She asks him. Her face is worried. 

‚ÄúI need my phone.‚Äù He replies. ‚ÄúNow.‚Äù He had it in his hand few seconds later. He phones Eraserhead. 

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù His number is unknown (the Gremlin‚Äôs baby in his hand is like a multi-use burner phone, very useful), so while the hero suspects that he knows who it is, he isn‚Äôt going to risk acting on that before confirmation. 

‚ÄúLegion speaking.‚Äù Izuku replies. He already has something resembling a cohesive battle plan, albeit he needs time to get it done. Heroes can give him time. ‚ÄúHow fast can you get everyone aware of Overhaul‚Äôs research together?‚Äù He needs Nedzu, Nighteye and David Shield, at the very least. 

‚ÄúTwo to three hours.‚Äù Eraserhead replies. ‚ÄúWhat happened? Other than you kidnapping Eclipse and saving Musutafu and UA from the raid.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo one is ever going to see her again.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúBut then things fucked up. Seriously. I need David Shield especially. I‚Äôll phone you in exactly three hours from now. Bye.‚Äù 

Few more days until Eclipse is operational. Few more days before he can start assembling an empire. Few more days before he can start seriously unfucking (word fixing just doesn‚Äôt quite fit in his mind) this mess. 

 

***

 

Eraserhead is reasonably worried. Unfortunately, his ‚Äòreasonably worried‚Äô is ‚Äòseriously afraid‚Äô in normal people‚Äôs language. And he isn‚Äôt alone - the implications of the Overhaul‚Äôs research are still giving the people in the know nightmares. And now, this. Legion calling for a general meeting (even if he will be participating only through the underground hero‚Äôs phone, it seems)? Not good. 

Nedzu seems positively delighted to be able to speak with his unofficial protege. Eraserhead is so done with that rat.

Eraserhead, All Might, Sir Nighteye, Nedzu, Detective Tsukauchi and David Shield all make it for the meeting (the last one, of course, through the internet). Almost right on time, the underground hero‚Äôs phone starts ringing. Unknown number. He sets it to the maximum loudness and picks up. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have much time, and the matter is grave, so I‚Äôll go to the point quickly.‚Äù It‚Äôs certainly Legion. ‚ÄúYou all noticed me taking down Eclipse. Turns out that she was set up by Chronostasis, who can be now considered to be commander-in-chief of the entire Quirkless Liberation Front. As for the reason for the meeting‚Ä¶‚Äù They all hear a loud sigh. ‚ÄúChronostasis isn‚Äôt Chronostasis. It‚Äôs Overhaul.‚Äù 

Dead silence in the room for a few seconds. Eraserhead can see blood leaving the faces of people present. Overhaul being alive is somehow the only thing worse than QLF somehow acquiring a quirk erasing gas. 

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù Sir Nighteye answers first. 

‚ÄúI have a theory.‚Äù Legion replies and Eraserhead shudders internally. Now that kid literally sounds like Nedzu. ‚ÄúBack then, he mentioned something about the potential to transplant or copy quirks through his research. He also said something about ‚Äònot being sure what else gets transplanted‚Äô. I didn‚Äôt pay it any mind, but... Chronostasis certainly has Overhaul‚Äôs quirk, but also appears to have his personality and certain medical problems.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBack-up plan.‚Äù Nedzu digs in. ‚ÄúHe must have finished the research and prepared something to transplant his own quirk to someone else, in secret. And when he died, Chronostasis used himself as a host.‚Äù They all read his file, Chronostasis fanatical devotion to Overhaul was no secret. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the state of his health?‚Äù This time it‚Äôs David Shield. His face seems torn between fascination and revulsion. His question takes Legion off-guard a bit. 

‚ÄúErr‚Ä¶ bad?‚Äù The villain replies. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get my hand on his medical file, but my no-longer-a-spy in QLF claims that he constantly has problems breathing. He is also wearing some form of inhalator - when he took it off, his body began to change to resemble Overhaul more. Hair began to go black, his eyes changed, I also heard something about ‚Äòsomething starting to shift under his skin‚Äô. He also coughed out a lot of blood after a few seconds, and put his inhalator back on. Though not before using Overhaul‚Äôs quirk as a demonstration.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAhhh‚Ä¶‚Äù David has a face of sudden understanding. ‚ÄúI think I can explain that. It‚Äôs not a perfect fusion, if anything it seems that the process was as far from perfect as possible. The vestiges of Overhaul‚Äôs personality attached to his quirk has overwritten Chronostasis‚Äôs mind, but the latter‚Äôs body is rejecting the former‚Äôs quirk. I suspect that it was damaged in the transfer process, and can‚Äôt be fully deactivated. The inhalator probably contains some sort of anti-rejection drug, or perhaps some dedicated quirk suppressor to keep Overhaul‚Äôs quirk weaker. Or both. When he took it off, the quirk began to slowly rewrite the host's body to better fit the default state of the body according to said quirk‚Ä¶ so some form of dysfunctional fusion of Overhaul and Chronostasis. Causing conflicts. He probably coughed out blood because his lungs were temporarily mismatched, in both genes and shapes.‚Äù 

Eraserhead doesn‚Äôt want to imagine the degree of pain Overhaul has to live in daily. He probably deserves it all, but it‚Äôs still rather painful to think about. 

‚ÄúWhen he put the inhalator back in place, the changes began to revert.‚Äù Legion replies. David seems fascinated. No one in the room feels like reminding him that he is talking with a supervillain. 

‚ÄúOverhaul‚Äôs research is so groundbreaking that it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶‚Äù David sighs. It‚Äôs an oddly excited sigh. ‚ÄúI feel like one of Wright‚Äôs brothers trying to analyze a jet plane. I know what it is and some general rules of aerodynamics, but details are way beyond me. If I were to speculate, I‚Äôd say that the inhalator carries some form of quirk-altering drug, that alone being revolutionary, that alters the desired body state that Overhaul‚Äôs quirk passively works towards into that of Chronostasis. He will most likely die without it, and rather quickly.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhich changes nothing in our current situation.‚Äù Sir Nighteye states. ‚ÄúWe have a mad scientist with knowledge surpassing the scientific community of the entire world, capable of doing things considered impossible by said community, in charge of the largest active terrorist organization in Japan. That was also mostly brainwashed to do his biddings with fanatical loyalty. It also has international support from anti-quirked hate groups worldwide.‚Äù He sighs. ‚ÄúAlso how certain are we that Chronostasis‚Äô is the only neo-Overhaul?‚Äù 

Eraserhead gets a headache out of the last question. He doesn‚Äôt seem to be alone in that. There are several thousand fanatically loyal quirkless soldiers in the Front. If Overhaul can copy himself‚Ä¶ even a hundred sickly SSS-Rank supervillains (Commission will shift the designation the second it finds out details about Overhaul, and its president is probably going to shit herself at the image) are a death sentence to the country. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs likely that he is the only one.‚Äù Legion speaks. ‚ÄúOne, I think that if there were two Overhauls‚Äô, they would promptly kill each other over refusing to listen to the other‚Äôs orders. Two, it‚Äôs very likely that blood of the original Overhaul is required for the process, as otherwise the resulting copies would inherit the current, broken fusion of Chronostasis and Overhaul. Add third person to the mix, even quirkless, and you get a mess. But if he truly carries Overhaul‚Äôs mind, he is probably working on finding a way around that obstacle.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo, a race against time.‚Äù Nedzu summarizes. ‚ÄúOverhaul has to be stopped before he manages to replicate himself again‚Ä¶ or before he concludes his research on the quirk erasure drug and makes it into a chemical weapon.‚Äù He remains silent for a few seconds. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the current status of the girl?‚Äù 

‚ÄúMy sister is of no importance to this issue, and remains beyond Overhaul‚Äôs reach.‚Äù Legion replies automatically. And, as often in such a state, makes a mistake. The unspoken question: ‚ÄòSister?‚Äô fills the room. 

‚ÄúSister?‚Äù Nedzu decides to speak it after all. Legion remains silent for a few long seconds. 

‚ÄúNedzu, I‚Äôll be frank with you.‚Äù Finally, Legion speaks. Something in his voice is‚Ä¶ new. Sure, he still changes his voice now and then, but even then, Eraserhead can feel something‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice that you are trying to catch me. Or kill me. That‚Äôs your job as a hero, and honestly, I think you‚Äôre doing just great. But my family isn‚Äôt a part of this. I know how you used families of villains that pissed you off to capture them, but do not try that with me. Because if you do, I‚Äôm taking my gloves off.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd then?‚Äù Nedzu chirps in. He seems intrigued by something, or perhaps tries to intimidate Legion into making some mistakes. 

‚ÄúAnd then I‚Äôm going to burn UA to the ground, personally murder every faculty member, sell your students to the nastiest human traffickers I can find, and bless Japanese internet with the image of me using your preserved head as an sextoy.‚Äù The voice is calm, almost serene. Eraserhead is taken aback. All Might is horrified. David Shields looks like he just remembered that they are talking with a supervillain. ‚ÄúMy mother and sister are off-limits to your schemes. Go after me and the League in whatever way you want‚Ä¶ save for that one. Do not make me angry, Nedzu. The original Overhaul died slowly and painfully, and you don't want to end up like him.‚Äù

Sir Nighteye freezes suddenly. Oh, they are all taken aback by the words that they didn‚Äôt expect. But something in the way Sir acts just now ticks Eraserhead off. He pulls out a notebook, writes something on it, pulls the page out and hands it to Eraserhead. 

He reads it. He can feel his blood go cold. How? How is that possible? 

He nods to Sir who nods back. All Might looks at them questioningly, only for both of them to tell him to stay silent by putting fingers on their lips. Tsukauchi and Nedzu join the club of questioning faces. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take that promise into account, Legion.‚Äù Nedzu is unfailingly calm. 

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù Legion says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll send Eraserhead the coordinates of the QLF base in a moment. ‚ÄúThen he ends the call. 

‚ÄúI think‚Ä¶‚Äù Eraserhead says in the resulting silence. ‚ÄúThat I need to show you something. Come with me for a second.‚Äù Sir Nighteye nods. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúHoly shit, Zuku.‚Äù Himiko managed to stay quiet until the end of the talk. ‚ÄúYou are so hot when you threaten people like that.‚Äù She is blushing furiously and has those dreamy eyes. She is probably in her own fantasy world. It‚Äôs probably best to not imagine what happens in it. But it most certainly includes the two of them and incredible amounts of blood. 

Midoriya Izuku sighs. This really isn‚Äôt the time for that. He knows he messed up when he mentioned that Eri is his sister, but he also thinks that he managed to fix it with the ‚Äòspontaneous‚Äô outburst and his further words. 

Time to ask his favourite spy to have an eye on the situation. Just in case he was wrong. Because then‚Ä¶ then things would get ugly. 

 

***

 

His favourite cat cafe isn‚Äôt particularly crowded at that hour. The workers manage to stay calm when Eraserhead enters it with whom they recognize immediately as Principal Nedzu. Sir Nighteye, All Might in his deflated form and Detective Tsukauchi elicit no reaction. 

They are quickly seated in a relatively remote part of the cafe, with some of the cats coming to meet the new people. They get cafe or tea (All Might picks the latter, but knowing his lack of stomach, he is merely tasting it). Everyone is curious about the reason for Eraserhead to bring them here. 

‚ÄúI believe that we either have a leak, or, even more likely, Nedzu‚Äôs office is wiretapped by the League.‚Äù Sir Nighteye starts hard right away. 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Detective speaks for everyone. Nedzu is borderline mortified. All Might coughs out blood. Eraserhead is interested in the reasoning behind the theory. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about the Legion‚Äôs slip up and his subsequent clean-up.‚Äù Sir Nighteye explains. ‚ÄúOnly we, Gran Torino and Lemillion know about Legion being the son of Mischief and, most likely, All for One. Legion mentioned having a sister, which implies at least one of his parents being alive right now. So he issued his threat‚Ä¶ and then, instead of saying ‚Äòmy family is off-limits‚Äô, or joking how odd he would feel if he called someone his ‚Äòdaughter‚Äô while being sixteen years old, he explicitly stated that ‚Äòmy mother and sister are off-limits‚Äô. Thus betraying that his mother is alive. Why clean one slip-up with another?‚Äù 

Eraserhead understands before others in the room. 

‚ÄúFor no reason.‚Äù The underground hero replies. ‚ÄúUnless you happen to know that the people you talk with know that your father is an evil incarnate. Then it makes perfect sense to fix the slip-up by reassuring them that it is your mother that is alive‚Ä¶ by another accidental slip-up.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bit of a stretch.‚Äù All Might tried to intercede. Sir Nighteye doesn‚Äôt let him. 

‚ÄúHe also mentioned how Nedzu is doing a good job trying to catch him.‚Äù Hero says. ‚ÄúWhat if it wasn‚Äôt sarcasm? Because I heard none in his voice, and we all know how he enjoys complimenting heroes who do a good job. His voice alteration doesn‚Äôt suppress sarcasm and irony, because his tongue was practically dripping with venom when he thanked his childhood friend for distracting Eraserhead during the USJ attack. If he somehow wiretapped Nedzu‚Äôs office, he knows how easily the Principal found out about his parents. And think about how easily he, an S-Rank villain, agreed to the meeting with Eraserhead and Tsukauchi? No wonder he didn‚Äôt worry about it being a trap. That‚Äôs because he KNEW that it wasn‚Äôt a trap.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThe same with our regular cooperation concerning QLF and ambushing Eclipse.‚Äù Eraserhead adds. ‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt afraid to land the entire League on UA‚Äôs doorstep, despite Eclipse‚Äôs presence interfering with their warp, because he KNEW that we weren‚Äôt planning to ambush them both.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThis is all rather circumstantial, but‚Ä¶ Nedzu?‚Äù Tsukauchi doesn‚Äôt seem convinced. So he asks the rat, who is oddly silent since the revelation. 

‚ÄúOh dear.‚Äù The rat-bear finally speaks. ‚ÄúI think you might be right. And I‚Äôm torn between amazement, amusement and desire to commit an‚Ä¶ unpleasantness.‚Äù Rat sighs and sips his tea. ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs quite decent. Should have brought me here earlier, Aizawa.‚Äù 

Eraserhead certainly isn‚Äôt paid enough to review cat cafes‚Äô for Nedzu in his spare time. Besides, he gave the cafe a positive review on the internet, and he is certain that despite him making it under a different name, the rat knows.

‚ÄúI can also add another circumstantial evidence to the list.‚Äù Principal adds after a few seconds. ‚ÄúWe know that the UA‚Äôs systems were hacked before the USJ attacks, but there was one thing that bothered me. Power Loader failed to explain how the League knew about the teachers that were going to be present in the USJ on that day. We found signs of intrusion in the USJ systems, but the actual timetable exists in physical form in the teacher‚Äôs lounge in the main building. I settled on thinking that Legion prepared for all eventualities, and made sure that All Might was elsewhere just in case he was scheduled to visit USJ, but‚Ä¶ it makes even more sense if he actually knew who was going to be there.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIn other words, there is a mole in the school.‚Äù Sir Nighteye summarizes. ‚ÄúAnd Legion knows everything or at least a lot that was said in at least the Principal‚Äôs office, which is probably wiretapped either through conventional means or with a quirk. Which is something that even All for One failed to achieve.‚Äù He sighs. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs not my thing to say, but‚Ä¶ Nedzu, be so kind and DON‚ÄôT touch Legion‚Äôs family if you manage to find it, alright? That kid is dangerous, and we shouldn‚Äôt push him too far at least until we‚Äôre certain that we can catch him afterwards.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNot planning to.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúNot because of the threats, but because I failed to find even the barest of trails. I simply can‚Äôt find them. And if so, then neither can Overhaul. And we can all agree that the last thing we all want is me finding his family only for Overhaul to steal his sister from me.‚Äù 

Eraserhead decided to not comment on how psychopathic that announcement was. All Might giving the rat a death glare was enough. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll give our friend Legion a few days to calm down.‚Äù Nedzu continues, ignoring All Might. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll get my friend, who happens to have a quirk that lets him detect active quirks, invited to visit the UA under some false reasons. If he detects some active quirk within my office, we‚Äôll have confirmation. If not, I‚Äôll have the Power Loader inspect the room to check for conventional things. In the meantime, I‚Äôll get him to make all people from our unofficial task force some secure communication tools. Something that doesn‚Äôt require vocal input.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd now, back to the Quirkless Liberation Front.‚Äù Sir Nighteye announces. ‚ÄúAnd Overhaul.‚Äù 

 

***

 

The President of the Hero Public Safety Commission is recently way more stressed that she likes to. Her organized world was ruined by Legion, Stain and Dabi exposing Endeavor‚Äôs family life to the world, and while QLF‚Äôs rampage was a godsend, things are still bad. The PR‚Äôs office of the HPSC is in the permanent disaster management mode. 

And now Nedzu is calling her. 

She picks her phone, looking at it as if it was a venomous snake. 

‚ÄúWhat is it, you abominable chimera pretending to be a human being?‚Äù She asks, concealing how tired and caffeine-dependent she is right now. Her voice sounds as strong as always. 

‚ÄúSomething came up, you damnable witch who somehow missed her appointment with a stake.‚Äù Nedzu chirps back. Both of them truly mean their insults. Their hatred equals the one between All for One and All Might, but they are yet to conclude it with murder. 

‚ÄúWhat exactly? Let me guess, you tried to screw a panda in the local zoo, some kids saw it and now you need my help to cover it up?‚Äù She replies promptly. Insulting each other with almost every sentence is something of a tradition in their mutual relationship. Murdering each other through the phone is hard, which didn‚Äôt stop the president from trying to find quirk capable of doing that. Nedzu is probably doing the same. 

‚ÄúOh? So your people are good in hiding sex with animals from public? I guess with you around, they have a lot of experience with that.‚Äù The rat shoots back. She clicks her tongue in irritation. ‚ÄúI happen to have new information concerning the QLF. You won‚Äôt like it, which would be pretty great, but unfortunately I don‚Äôt like it either.‚Äù
Notes:

    ... you didn't expect the UA to remain oblivious to the wiretapping forever, now did you?

    Also, just so we're clear, another plot earthquake is scheduled for chapter 28 :P Although, to be honest, that particular earthquake lasts for two more chapters.

    Also, hopefully, the entire history of talks between Nedzu and the HPSC President will one day be published, for the great benefit of the world of Japanese insults.

Notes:

    Miruko, Gang Orca and Shishido are listed as independents, however many commentators speculate about connection between them. Not only are they all possessors of complex mutant quirks, but they also frequently team-up (while avoiding team-ups with anyone else). Some claim that there is a conspiracy in play, others that this is simply due to them all sharing the issue of being a target of frequent discrimination, making them more likely to co-operate with each other. When they team-up outside of their group, they tend to do that with UA-aligned heroes. 
    Yoroi Musha, Crust, Scream, Wash and Boulder are a part of the Northern Battle Group, a semi-permanent team-up placed near the northernmost end of Japan. Yoroi Muusha is there permanently, while the others come and go (but there is always at least two more heroes from the list, plus a lot of heroes with lesser rankings). The NBG‚Äôs goal is to repel any attempt of Re-Destro and his Meta Liberation Army to make landfall in northern Japan.

MissExplosion: potentially

VampirePrincess: ?

MissExplosion: It's like my normal babies, but it grows on their own with your limited input, and its functionalities (quirks, physical strength and so on) are kinda random, yes? But Izuku seems like a source of quality material.

MissExplosion: and I‚Äôm yet to make such a baby

MissExplosion: so I‚Äôm potentially interested in it, because I love making babies

MissExplosion: sentient biological ones are something new

Izuku was correct. The quirk-suppressing drug he injected into Eclipse WAS damaged by the messed-up warp. Enough to stop working after less than two days. Unfortunately to the (former) leader of the QLF, she was decked in a quirk-suppressing collar way before that. 

She was a former quirkless, so she knew how to be mean to other people without her quirk. But she could do very little while handcuffed. Even her legs were bound. Plus, a gag. None of the League members really cared about her discomfort, since Izuku made his plans known to them. 

When the collar confirmed that there was something to suppress, Stain dragged her to the training room, where all members of the League were gathered. 

‚ÄúHi there, Eclipse.‚Äù Izuku waved at her. She was unable to respond vocally, so she merely stared daggers at him. 

No one in the world knew what Eclipse really looks like‚Ä¶ until she was captured by the League. She was a reasonably decent looking and completely normal (for quirkless standards) woman approaching her forties. Her hair (long and black) were actually slightly similar to Blueberry (and so were her blue eyes). That gave Izuku an interesting idea.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs no way to treat a lady.‚Äù Izuku sighs. Like many other ‚Äòspontaneous‚Äô things in his life, this meeting was planned to a detail. ‚ÄúStain, ungag her.‚Äù 

He did so. She kept staring at Izuku with hatred in her eyes. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not telling you anything about QLF.‚Äù She says. ‚ÄúIf you think that starving me is going to make me talk, you‚Äôre mistaken‚Ä¶‚Äù Izuku laughs. That takes her off-guard. 

‚ÄúChronostasis sold you, Eclipse.‚Äù He says, and Eclipse freezes. ‚ÄúHe knew that we have a spy in your midst and that we‚Äôre going to ambush you. All your information about the QLF is outdated. We had heroes storm your base yesterday, and all they found was some trash that Chronostasis forgot to take with him. You have almost nothing of value, so after I extract the only valuable thing from you, I‚Äôm going to have you executed.‚Äù He gives her a cheerful smile. ‚ÄúNo hard feelings, but I‚Äôm not letting a mass-murderer responsible for gassing several cities and a lot of civilian deaths roam free. Not to mention someone who made lives of the non-villainous quirkless in this country so much harder. Including my own.‚Äù 

She doesn‚Äôt want to believe him. But something in her eyes says that she does. At least about the Chronostasis part. Did she suspect him of doing something behind her back? Too late to change anything. 

She is kneeling, Stain holding her in that position. Izuku approaches her and puts his hand on her face. Then he activates All for One. 

He never actually stole a quirk. He got Overhaul‚Äôs quirk from his dad, who was the person who did the deed. Willing transfer wasn‚Äôt a problem, since there was no real resistance (and that's how he got all remaining quirks). But Eclipse has a powerful willpower - she will hold her ground. Especially once she figures out what is happening. 

He had no ‚Äòcombat‚Äô experience, but it doesn‚Äôt mean that he lacked training. He trained quirk stealing on his father. All for One didn‚Äôt put maximum resistance (Izuku would have never won if he did), but he did scale it as time passed. 

Eclipse screams and squirms in her bonds when he begins. Energy cracks in the air, like red-electricity. Strands of ‚Äòsomething‚Äô of similar color are leaving her body and entering his. 

She fights tooth and nail. He slowly and purposefully breaks her resistance. She is powerful, but not invincible. He also has time, and she is weakened by the news of Chronostasis‚Äô betrayal, of QLF being taken from her and by the fact that she, simply speaking, lost to the League already. Not eating or drinking for two days didn‚Äôt help. 

Izuku tires. But doesn‚Äôt relent. It takes him almost twenty minutes (Eclipse stopped screaming after half of that time) to finish the process. He pulls his hand back and the former QLF leader slumps down. 

Surface Control . 

He generates a small surface based on the floor underneath him and makes it float above his hand. He discovers that he can easily alter their colour, Eclipse picked black and yellow to fit her name. That was quite an interesting aesthetic sense. The discovery is both interesting and greatly beneficial to his plans. 

Eclipse stares at him in horror. 

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶‚Äù She finally utters. ‚Äú... that quirk.‚Äù She understands what just happened‚Ä¶ but doesn‚Äôt understand how that was possible.

‚ÄúYes, Eclipse.‚Äù Izuku replies with a smile. ‚ÄúAll for One is my father. He is letting me prove myself by cleaning up people like you, instead of reigning you himself. Very nice of me to not hand you to him, won‚Äôt you say?‚Äù Her already pale face turns white. ‚ÄúIn a way, I empathize with you. I know what it means to grow up quirkless in our society. To be treated as a subhuman and a mistake of evolution. So let me assure you, that your quirk will be used in a way that will benefit others like us. And those quirkless who never turned out to be late-bloomers.‚Äù 

He signals to Stain. Stain breaks Eclipse‚Äôs neck and she slumps to the ground, dead. 

‚ÄúDabi, cremate the body.‚Äù The oldest of Endeavor‚Äôs progeny nods and does as ordered. ‚ÄúSo, does anyone have anything to add?‚Äù They all gathered here to see how his true quirk works. He isn‚Äôt sure what to think about it. 

‚ÄúCool.‚Äù Tenko comments. Mustard nods in agreement. 

‚ÄúNot sure what I expected, but it was kinda bland?‚Äù Spinner comments. ‚ÄúI mean, it‚Äôs pretty much a Class-Six quirk, yeah? Despite the scale officially reaching Class-Five only.‚Äù Izuku already knows of at least three quirks going past it - one belongs to Midoriya Eri, one to two other Midoriyas‚Äô, and one is shared by two heroes. 

Too bad the matter is secret to the world. He would love to talk about it on the internet forums for quirk enthusiasts.

‚ÄúSlightly reassuring that it takes so long, to be honest.‚Äù Himiko adds with a thoughtful face. ‚ÄúPart of me was afraid of you accidentally stealing my blood transformation when touching me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWas there a lot of touching?‚Äù Mindscrew adds, while Tenko chuckles maniacally in the background. 

Izuku sighs. His friends are weird.

 

***

 

Izuku tells Stain to fetch Blueberry and bring her to his unofficial office. It looks like an office at least, he needs a place to look like one when he has guests. No one should suspect that his actual evil mastermind‚Äôs office is elsewhere. 

He does so. Then he leaves. Blueberry looks at Izuku questioningly. 

Izuku has to admit one thing - Himiko kinda has a taste. Blueberry (another person after Mustard to refuse using her real name) is rather pretty. Older than him, yes (like almost everyone in the building), but not so much. Shoulder-long black hair, blue eyes, a nice pair of‚Ä¶ 

Izuku sighs internally. Being a teenager sucks. Being a teenager AND Himiko‚Äôs boyfriend sucks even more. He should stop letting her get to his head. 

Hormones bad, villainy good, get a grip about yourself.

‚ÄúSo, is it the moment when I hear why are me and my friends still here?‚Äù Blueberry is also kinda fearless. Izuku understands that. Those quirkless that do not commit suicide before adulthood tend to be like that. When living is as bad of a prospect as dying, your fear of death vanishes somewhere. ‚ÄúAlso I still didn‚Äôt get to talk with my other friend.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHe is my undercover agent.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt exactly pull him from the UA on a moment‚Äôs notice, although he DOES bombard me with questions about how you are faring almost constantly. He is very protective of you, you know that?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù She replies promptly. ‚ÄúI noticed.‚Äù He did save her. So it‚Äôs a given. He might be a few years younger, but he refuses to look up to her. They are equals. ‚ÄúI also noticed that I now know that you have a spy on the UA, which really doesn‚Äôt make me feel optimistic when it comes to my future.‚Äù 

And also intelligent. Himiko really has a good taste. That, or her taste is literally everyone so she scores some good ones along the way. No one can tell. 

‚ÄúWell, yes.‚Äù Izuku sees no reason to lie. ‚ÄúWhich is why I have an idea. One that will help us both make the world a better place for the quirkless, while simultaneously taking care of that issue.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou care about the quirkless?‚Äù She seems surprised. Well, she is out of the loop. She didn‚Äôt see Eclipse‚Äôs last fight. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a late bloomer.‚Äù He replies. She looks at him with something unreadable on her face. ‚ÄúMy former ‚Äòbest friend‚Äô told me to take a swan dive off the roof when I was eight years old. Not even sure where he heard the words. And it took me a while to figure out what he meant by it. I support the cause behind the QLF, just not its methods. We can do so much better together, Blueberry.‚Äù 

He has her attention. Just not her consent. 

‚ÄúWhat is your plan?‚Äù She asks. Her eyes met his. And refuse to leave. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll create a completely new organization for the quirkless and late-bloomers.‚Äù He says confidently. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say‚Ä¶ Quirkless Equality Movement? It‚Äôll be villainous, of course. I don‚Äôt do heroics, not sure if you noticed.‚Äù He chuckles. ‚ÄúBut without the maniacal factor that the QLF fell into. No mass murders. No destroying towns. No chemical weapons. You will be killing or exposing the heroes and villains that persecute the quirkless. Terrorizing the parents who abandoned their quirkless children‚Ä¶ and killing those that abused them and drove them to suicide. Interrupting the manifestations against quirkless rights. Leading completely innocent internet support groups for the disenfranchised quirkless‚Ä¶ while fishing for those who can join a villain group. Your villain group, Blueberry‚Ä¶ daughter of Eclipse.‚Äù 

The last words shook her off the trance. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a daughter of Eclipse.‚Äù She replies. ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt think that I can impersonate someone like that.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh, trust me, you can.‚Äù Izuku smiles. ‚ÄúYou will come forward to announce the insanity of the QLF. The brainwashing, the Overhaul‚Äôs betrayal of your mother. You will denounce the methods of Eclipse, say that all they do is make the quirked discriminate the quirkless more. While giving the world a teary story about being de facto imprisoned by her when she understood that you are against her campaign of terror. And how you fled with a handful of supporters during the chaos of Overhaul‚Äôs coup. Nobody knows what Eclipse truly looks like, save for the QLF‚Äôs leadership‚Ä¶ and who will believe a bunch of terrorists when they‚Äôll say that you aren‚Äôt her daughter? And even if someone knows how she looks, you actually are quite similar.‚Äù He can see gears turning in her head. Time for the last push. ‚ÄúBut the people will believe you. Because you will be using her quirk.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs as if thunder struck the room. 

‚ÄúHer quirk?‚Äù Blueberry appears angry. ‚ÄúAre you going to make me pretend to have a quirk? Use some parlour tricks to fool other quirkless? Is that what you are planning to do?‚Äù 

Yes. Quirks are a painful subject for the quirkless. Who never tried to pretend to have a simple quirk (like some intelligence or analysis one), cast the stone first. But Izuku planned for that reaction. 

‚ÄúNo, Blueberry.‚Äù Midoriya Izuku, willing heir to the most evil man alive, smiles once again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm planning to give you her quirk.‚Äù 

He activates Eclipse‚Äôs quirk. Round surfaces began to float in the air around him. Blueberry‚Äôs eyes grow wider in recognition. Her mind seeks answers, but can‚Äôt find any. 

‚ÄúLate-bloomers always get a powerful quirk, one that their immature body was unsuited to host.‚Äù Izuku says. ‚ÄúAnd I got probably the most powerful of them all. The power to take and give quirks. And now I‚Äôm offering to give you one. Are you interested?‚Äù 

He can see it on her face. In twenty seconds Blueberry goes from shock and unbelief to complete and utter dedication to him. To the person that offered her the greatest gift a quirkless can get. The ability to be ‚Äònormal‚Äô. To no longer be an outcast. To have power after suffering from powerlessness for her entire life. 

Together with an option to help others like her. He doesn‚Äôt say it, but she understands that what he did once, he can do twice. And quirkless with their endless desire to fit in‚Ä¶ aren‚Äôt they perfect receivers of such ‚Äògifts‚Äô?

‚ÄúYes. Yes I am.‚Äù She says. And he laughs - internally. He won. One small step in the construction of his empire. But a great step for himself. Sure, he is following his father‚Äôs trail. But most children do that. There are always deviations‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs his goal. But for now, the road is clear.

‚ÄúKneel then. And relax.‚Äù He says, and she follows the instructions obediently. He puts his hand on her face and activates All for One. 

He should get a suit for the next time he does that. Just a small throwback to the old regime. Also a picture - his father‚Äôs going to frame it, no doubts about it. 

 

***

He leaves Blueberry in the living room of the base. He has a lot of things to talk about with her, yes. The Quirkless Equality Movement is composed of only a single member right now (she is yet to announce its creation to her three friends) - they will have to talk about the best ways of expanding it. About the way the League of Villains can help her balance her organization‚Äôs budget. But it can wait.

She is too busy experimenting with her quirk. And crying with relief and happiness. She spent her entire life getting persecuted for something that he just ‚Äòhealed‚Äô her from. There are no words to describe the depths of relief that overtook her brain. 

She seems to be a natural. She already generated more surfaces at once than he did. Slightly odd, but also pretty great. Besides, some people having natural compatibility towards certain quirks are normal, at least according to his father. 

He has other things to do. He doesn‚Äôt notice Himiko approaching Blueberry when he turns her back on her (she is still on ‚Äòit‚Äô, and she just noticed a weakened prey). 

He ends up in Gremlin‚Äôs lab. Needless to say, it looks like a mess. Reinforcing and sound-proofing the area cost the League a lot of money. Especially as he had to do the same in the reserve base. 

There are dozens of ‚Äòbabies‚Äô scattered around. He doesn‚Äôt even dare to try to figure out what half of them are. Gremlin is a mad genius, and she can navigate this labyrinth of explosives and acids perfectly. The base might be his kingdom, but this dukedom rules itself without the king's attention. 

‚ÄúHello there, boss!‚Äù Mei was tinkering with something on one of the many tables. ‚ÄúHere to make a baby with me? You always have the best ideas.‚Äù He is acutely aware. She mentioned that hundreds of times already. 

‚ÄúActually, I was going to talk with you about a certain business proposal.‚Äù Her face turns towards him and her eyes glow. ‚ÄúI had a talk with Giran earlier.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh, oh, oh, wait!‚Äù She shouts and quickly puts her ‚Äòbaby‚Äô down. She caresses its metal frame. ‚ÄúMama has to talk with papa for a bit, be nice to the others while I‚Äôm out, alright?‚Äù She makes a weird face. ‚ÄúGood boy! I‚Äôm proud.‚Äù

Sometimes Izuku asks himself if Mei didnt‚Äôt fall from the mountain of sanity far enough to actually hear her ‚Äòbabies‚Äô talk with her. Her quirk is about eyesight, so it‚Äôs certainly not the cause. On the other hand, she is functional enough AND a certified genius. It‚Äôs like having his own David Shield, but in the basement and with more explosions. Is it really important if she is sane when she is happy?

‚ÄúPlease tell me it‚Äôs all set up!‚Äù Mei says after pretty much jumping all the way to him. Is that some new jumping baby she is field-testing while working on another thing altogether? ‚ÄúIt is, right? Right?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes, Mei.‚Äù He replies and she beams. ‚ÄúGiran is overjoyed at the prospect of working as your middleman. He heard a lot about the quality of your babies AND is interested enough to find you both a remote place for your company and some willing co-workers.‚Äù 

He will probably disguise it all as a company that deals with electronic junk. Hatsume Mei‚Äôs ability to turn junk into stuff like jetpacks or railguns is legendary among the League members. Giran is trustworthy enough. He knows just how much money this business can earn him. And he loves money. 

‚ÄúAre you sure that you can deal with management, though?‚Äù Izuku asks, not fully certain of it. Not all certain of it, in fact. More like anti-certain. ‚ÄúYou are a crazy good inventor and engineer, but other than that‚Ä¶‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt add ‚Äòwith an accent on ‚Äòcrazy‚Äô but it‚Äôs implied. Kinda. She wouldn‚Äôt notice it even if he said that to her face. 

‚ÄúI can do that no problem.‚Äù She replies promptly. ‚ÄúPa and Ma prepared me for inheriting their company since I was eight years old and made my first baby! I can manage a company alright. I mean, having others make babies is like making them yourself, yes? ‚Äù He isn‚Äôt sure if she truly looked for an answer, but he still nodded. ‚ÄúBut you can make even more of them at the same time! So it‚Äôs like having grandchildren! And I can‚Ä¶‚Äù 

She suddenly breaks into tears. Izuku is right next to her in a heartbeat, hugging her. He knows what happened. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Mei.‚Äù He says, trying his best to console her. He doesn‚Äôt want her to trip on something in this state, not in a room full of exposed wires, acids and explosive materials. 

Hatsume Mei was fourteen years old when Detnerat Corporation decided to eat up her parents‚Äô company. When they refused to sell Hatsume Industries, Detnerat decided to ignore said refusal.

Her parents lost. First their livelihood (Detnerat promptly ruined Hatsume Industries with some underhanded methods, and then took it over). Then everything else. Hatsume Mei - who had the unfortunate luck of being a genius inventor even at her age - was kidnapped and told to make her babies for Detnerat Corporation in order for it to spare her parents. Parents that, unknowingly to her, were already dead. 

She eventually escaped through a stroke of luck. And, somehow, run into Kurogiri. She was already maniacally focused on her babies - and revenge - when that happened. And just slightly insane. 

But sometimes, there were moments like this. When her mind returned to those days. And decided to take a break. The prospect of having a ‚Äòcompany‚Äô properly once again did it this time, if Izuku‚Äôs hunch was correct. Too many emotions that she no longer knew how to deal with. 

She hugged him back. He activated Strength Amp to not make it too painful. Her arms‚Äô strength was no joke. 

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I miss them so much.‚Äù She utters, still crying. He is still hugging her, using one of his hands to pat her head. He tries to not think of oil smears on his favourite T-shirt. 

‚ÄúI know, Mei.‚Äù He says. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll make a perfect company. New Hatsume Industries. Something to make them proud of you. And we‚Äôll take revenge on Detnerat together, like I promised. I know that we didn‚Äôt have time to work on that recently, but‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs celebrate you becoming a CEO properly! Did Kurogiri give you your explosives back?‚Äù 

He didn‚Äôt. But he does so when Izuku asks him. Then he teleports the bomb to the local Detnerat factory (after its closing time, Izuku understands revenge but not random mass slaughter, it‚Äôs not like regular workers did nasty things to her parents). Izuku and Mei watch it go off from the roof of the building a kilometer away from it. 

The factory is thoroughly destroyed. Mei is back to her cheerful insanity state. The hug she gives him almost breaks his ribs. They shout at each other over how to name her new company (her name is still a secret, and he doesn‚Äôt think that ‚ÄòFuck Detnerat‚Äô is a good company name). They eventually settle on Villain Industries. 

It‚Äôs a nice evening, all things considered.

[[HAREMMISTRESS send invitation to the chat to Blueberry [Unranked]]]

[[Blueberry [Unranked] joins the chat with default nickname of Blueberry]]

[[HAREMMISTRESS changed BLUEBERRY‚Äôs nickname to DevotedSlave]]

 

DevotedSlave: I‚Äôm not sure if I meant it that literally, Vampire.

BabyFactory: oh, someone new in the harem? can we make a baby together?

DevotedSlave: errr, did I miss a memo about something?

HaremMistress: she is our support engineer, babies are her name for her inventions (she is very protective of them)

DevotedSlave: oh, I see, explains the nickname I think

HaremMistress: yeaaa

HaremMistress: how was your day, BabyFactory?

BabyFactory: Izuku blew up a Detnerat factory for me, and we watched the explosion together! all of that at sunset (it looked beautiful)

HaremMistress: for a person who says that he dislikes the idea of having harem of beautiful, deadly and thoroughly devoted women at his side, he did an awful lot of things to make you fall for him

BabyFactory: yes, I want to make all the babies I can do for him, and then some more

HaremMistress: also when did my adorable innocent green bean mastered the art of setting up a romantic mood

HaremMistress: I‚Äôm confused

DevotedSlave: So what do we do here normally? I‚Äôm new to both the Villain Network and this chat

HaremMistress: We talk about how awesome Izuku is, brainstorm ways to make him accept you all into his bed, and also read newest episode of my totally not super sexy story about him that I write when he isn‚Äôt looking

BabyFactory: I‚Äôm still surprised how quickly you wrote it, isn‚Äôt this chat on since yesterday?

HaremMistress: and I‚Äôm still surprised how you actually are present on this chat unlike the main one, and you even write relatively coherent statements!

HaremMistress: any skills that you can contribute to our arts corner, @DevotedSlave?

DevotedSlave: well I did hear that I‚Äôm very good at drawing, does that count? 

HaremMistress: Y E S we‚Äôre going to have so much fun together! :D :D I have so many commissions in mind for you

HaremMistress: Also, guess what, did you know that Izuku‚Äôs birthday is in three days? :3 

DevotedSlave: oh dear me 

BabyFactory: that‚Äôs a crucial information to me, going to the workshop immediately, gtg

HaremMistress: oh yeah it‚Äôs all coming together
Notes:

    Small step for Izuku, massive nostalgia ride for his father when he finds out.

Chapter 23: Reorganization
Summary:

    The empire expands. Himiko tries to win the game. Someone is plotting in darkness.

Chapter Text

Izuku wakes up in their room in the base, does his best to avoid waking Himiko up (she is just slightly bloodstarved right now, and he isn‚Äôt sure what to expect from her once she wakes up) and after some basic preparations ends up in the living room of the base. 

He is planning to play videogames with Tenko, but instead sees Kurogiri waving at him from behind the bar. So he comes along. 

‚ÄúTea? Coffee? Soda? Water?‚Äù Kurogiri asks. Izuku shakes his head. ‚ÄúBreakfast is already waiting.‚Äù 

The police and the heroes are blissfully unaware that if Kurogiri disappeared from the picture, the League would have no other choice than to surrender to the police. They would literally die of starvation without him. That or Izuku would have to invite his mom to live with him and his friends, and that would be a truly ultimate humiliation for a supervillain.

‚ÄúYou are a life-saver, Unclegiri.‚Äù Kurogiri reacts in no discernible way to yet another butchering of his villain name. ‚ÄúSo, you wanted something from me?‚Äù He says while stuffing himself with sandwiches. Waving is a bit unlike their warper.

‚ÄúI have a business proposal for you.‚Äù The warper (well, theoretically, Blueberry‚Äôs presence is keeping him grounded until Gremlin finishes their warp-assistance support items) says. ‚ÄúI believe we are currently branching out a bit, so I decided that it‚Äôs a good time to ask.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSure, go for it.‚Äù He was about to make some internal changes to League‚Äôs structure in order to accomodate for the recent changes. 

Kurogiri‚Äôs idea is one of the most beautiful and crazy things Izuku ever heard. Their warper pointed out that one of the reasons for the heroes‚Äô triumphs over the villains is that they can learn their trade openly. Villains, in the meantime, are typically self-taught or have mentors who tend to impart skills and mistakes alike. 

But now, the League of Villains is branching out and its finances are stellar. Izuku might not be reaching the level of funding the Re-Destro has (the government is still pretending that Detnerat and some other corporations didn‚Äôt back his coup, because trying to dismantle them would kill what‚Äôs left of the Japanese economy), but it‚Äôs quite close. They can invest into the future. 

So why not organize an underground academy for villains? Get some promising fifteen-twenty one years old thugs, tell them how to use their quirks for maximum power, teach them some ‚Äòproper‚Äô quirkless combat skills, instruct them in things like picking locks, some rudimentary hacking, disguises and whatever else they might need. 

Also some psychological counseling, because being an ass to your compatriots is probably the most common reason for villain‚Äôs crew collapse after heroes. 

If the trainees will be good enough, then the entire ‚ÄòVillain Academy‚Äô can finance itself by selling their skills in exchange for practical experience as a form of internships. And the graduates can pay back the remaining cash in installments from their villain career. 

Besides, even if graduates get captured by the heroes, the League can survive losing some money if it means a higher level of professional villainy out there! Not to mention that many active villains will simply pay the Academy to train their kids for them. 

‚ÄúThis is beautiful, Kurogiri!‚Äù Izuku beams up, and he can feel the happiness radiating from the warper. ‚ÄúI name you the first principal of the Villain Academy!‚Äù It‚Äôs like the Villain Factory but this time less retarded. ‚ÄúAnd offer you the League‚Äôs full support!‚Äù 

In Izuku‚Äôs opinion, the warper just likes the idea of making children happy. Children or pets. Kurogiri still thinks that nobody knows of him regularly feeding stray cats from the surrounding district. 

Izuku should go spend some time with his family today.

FuckSchool: Okay so can someone tell me why is Kurogiri hiding in one of the unused rooms, humming something and looking through the teaching curriculums that our spy stole from the UA

FuckSchool: I‚Äôm getting bad vibes about it

SmallMight: Kurogiri decided to work on the level of professional villainy in Japan and I offered the League‚Äôs unconditional support for his idea of opening an academy for villains.

FuckSchool: WE‚ÄôRE OPENING A SCHOOL?! 

FuckSchool: on an unrelated note, does someone know about a villain crew interested in recruiting me

SmallMight: don‚Äôt get melodramatic, it won‚Äôt be open here AND you don‚Äôt have to participate

SmallMight: I‚Äôm probably going to offer quirk analysis AND teach the kids how to analyse quirks of their enemies

SmallMight: looking forward to it already! 

VampirePrincess: So I'm going to teach them‚Ä¶ disguises and knife-fu?

SmallMight: aye

VampirePrincess: hey that‚Äôs actually quite cool

UA-Spy: let me guess - you want me to ‚Äòvanish‚Äô more teaching material

SmallMight: if possible, UA is the best and we want to learn from the best

SmallMight: still talking with Blueberry?

UA-Spy: just finished, it was an interesting experience

UA-Spy: at least she isn‚Äôt angry at me for not mentioning the League

SmallMight: nice

MissExplosion: @CatProvider are you interested in opening a support department in your school, as a CEO of Villain Industries I‚Äôm interested in working together

FuckSchool: wait she can talk like that?!

CatProvider: I‚Äôm sure we can come to an accomodation, Miss Hatsume!

HandyMan: This is just creepy

Insomniac: said the walking advertisement of hand cream

SmallMight: yeah, so it might be the time to talk about it

SmallMight: @Everyone

SmallMight: I‚Äôm planning to make some internal reorganizations rn, read stuff from here down and comment when you are on

SneakyGecko: what reorganizations?

SmallMight: 1. Blueberry is joining the League as regular member

SmallMight: 2. We‚Äôre branching out into numerous organizations, and we need to figure out some form of command structure

SmallMight: ok less command and more ‚Äòwho is responsible for what‚Äô or we‚Äôll all drown 

UA-Spy: BLUEBERRY WHAT

SmallMight: lol she didn‚Äôt tell him 

Blueberry: r e v e n g e

UA-Spy: ‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt even complain about it without being accused of being a hypocrite, right?

Blueberry: yes

UA-Spy: I shall then shut up

Blueberry: good

FuckSchool: I kinda love their older sister younger brother but also childhood friends dynamic ngl

FuckSchool: a bit low on ara ara moments though

UA-Spy: ‚Ä¶ 

Blueberry: ara ara 

FuckSchool: better xD 

SmallMight: ok, so I remain the head of the League 

SmallMight: [I‚Äôm going to say things as if describing what‚Äôs decided upon, but feel free to offer your input on things]

HandyMan: can I be the head

SmallMight: [other than the first one]

SmallMight: literally didn‚Äôt give me enough time to write that small note, damnit Tenko xD

HandyMan: that‚Äôs not an answer though

SmallMight: I‚Äôm not letting you lead the League of Villains, you would literally start dusting cities for having bad internet connection or smth

HandyMan: yes

SmallMight: ‚Ä¶

HandyMan: they deserve to die

HandyMan: they all deserve to die

FuckSchool: what

SmallMight: Hey I understood that reference!

SmallMight: now stop derailing

SmallMight: So the first ‚Äòbranch‚Äô are the heads of the subsidiary groups. They are going to be mostly retired from the frontlines, unless it's an emergency. 

SmallMight: This branch includes: MissExplosion [Villain Industries], Blueberry [Quirkless Equality Movement], CatProvider [Villain Academy]. 

Insomniac: both warpers?

SmallMight: losing even a single one will be a pain, so it‚Äôs probably best that we don‚Äôt risk them all at once

Insomniac: fair

SmallMight: I expect getting more groups to join, BUT we aren‚Äôt going to invite every head to be member of the League of Villains, this is going to be kinda a special privilege

SneakyGecko: gotta be the first time in my life when I‚Äôm privileged lol

Insomniac: big mood

VampirePrincess: ouch but also rel

SmallMight: PurgeTheFakes is going to be my official second-in-command while being a group into himself

SmallMight: don't‚Äô take it bad, uncle, but your strength lies in being scary as hell and deadly, not in being a field commander material, and I CAN‚ÄôT for the love of all that‚Äôs holy and unholy imagine you listening to orders from someone who isn‚Äôt me

PurgeTheFakes: yes

SmallMight: UA-Spy and Vampire Princess are going to be our infiltration, assassination and espionage department, mostly because they are damn good at that. UA-Spy‚Äôs in charge, though

VampirePrincess: hey!!! you don‚Äôt trust me?

SmallMight: I trust you with a lot of things. Not making a bloodbath when you are discovered BUT there are other options is not one of them. 

VampirePrincess: you know me too well, fair

UA-Spy: I   H A V E   T H E    P O W E R

SmallMight: yeah, yeah, whatever

VampirePrincess: question

VampirePrincess: can I at least name that branch

SmallMight: UA-Spy?

UA-Spy: alright

VampirePrincess: Red Room

SmallMight: jesus christ

UA-Spy: I regret certain decisions

SmallMight: I regret watching MCU films with her holy shit

VampirePrincess: NO TAKING BACK YOU PROMISED

SmallMight: just don‚Äôt mention the name with me around and alright

UA-Spy: ‚Ä¶ shit, alright

VampirePrincess: YES

HandyMan: I am confused

CatProvider: Hello confused, I‚Äôm Kurogiri. 

SmallMight: OH MY GOD

VampirePrincess: OH MY GOD

Insomniac: PFFF

FuckSchool: WAS THAT A DAD JOKE
UA-Spy: Kurogiri is Papagiri confirmed

HandyMan: ‚Ä¶

SneakyGecko: LOL

BurnBurnBurn: ‚Ä¶ dad jokes are oddly fun, a bit late (I‚Äôm 24) but can Kurogiri adopt me too, I want a normal dad for once

SmallMight: stop making this convo a rollercoaster of feelings I don‚Äôt know what to feel right now

Insomniac: yeah holy shit

SmallMight: it‚Äôs especially hard for HandyMan because we all know that he is too simple to feel more than one emotion at once

HandyMan: fuck you

SmallMight: no

CatProvider: I‚Äôm not adopting anyone. But I‚Äôm going to take care of you all to the best of my abilities. Regardless of your age and of whether you have, do not have or have killed your biological/adopted parents.

VampirePrincess: awww, Papagiri, this is the sweetest thing I ever heard

HandyMan: yes

SmallMight: BACK TO THE SUBJECT stop derailing the convo with your daddy issues dammit

SmallMight: The rest will be an exclusive combat unit of the League of Villains. Insomniac‚Äôs in charge. 

Insomniac: yes!

HandyMan: no! 

FuckSchool: maybe!

SmallMight: and I dub thee‚Ä¶ Vanguard Action Squad

Insomniac: your naming sucks

SmallMight: you‚Äôre the one who tried to name your cat ‚ÄòDog‚Äô, you aren‚Äôt in a position to criticize me

HandyMan: HE WHAT

Insomniac: I TRUSTED YOU TO KEEP IT SECRET

Insomniac: IT WAS IRONIC

SmallMight: your facial features are ironic (why have them when you don‚Äôt use them), now quiet down dammit

SmallMight: VAS members are: Insomniac, FuckSchool, HandyMan, BurnBurnBurn, SneakyGecko and DeusVult. 

SmallMight: find yourself a second-in-command from the list

SmallMight: also the name is because I plan to have you operate as literal vanguard, supported by thugs and villains from subsidiary groups

Insomniac: BurnBurnBurn, do you want to be my second-in-command?

HandyMan: fuck I knew he wouldn‚Äôt pick me

BurnBurnBurn: looking forward to working together! And burning things. Mostly burning things.

Insomniac: @HandyMan, you are a weapon of mass destruction in the shape of a man, you can‚Äôt focus on murdering people AND commanding people, so let me do the latter and focus on the former, k?

HandyMan: now you‚Äôre speaking my language

Blueberry unleashed her manifest the day before Izuku‚Äôs birthday. He actually ended up asking Mr. Compress for help with it. The Big Man himself decided to join in with the effort (he was, is and will be an absolute master of things like lighting, acting and special effects) when Izuku offered him a chance to meet his mom. 

Mr. Compress didn‚Äôt believe him when he told him that Mischief is alive. But he decided to check the possibility of meeting one of his idols. Besides, it was an occasion to make a working relationship between Legion and Mr. Compress (thus far all contacts were through Gentle Criminal/La Brava). 

Needless to say, Blueberry coming into public knowledge (under the villain name of Sunset, with her surfaces being rather red/orangish, to keep with the solar themes of Eclipse) was an astounding success. La Brava and her computer collective ended up actually finding, confirming and redirecting a handful of remaining ‚Äòoutside‚Äô cells of the QLF into the newly formed Quirkless Equality Movement. Although confirming their loyalty was going to be another thing altogether. 

Asking his mom to spend an hour or two sipping tea and talking about old heists with Mr. Compress (they ended up spending five hours and making friendship bracelets for each other, oddly enough) was a low price to pay for making Blueberry infamous. Izuku was borderline tired of seeing the memes on the internet, and it was only a few hours since the act. 

They also ended up exposing a human trafficking ring preying on quirkless AND blew up a police precinct that was covering up abuse of local quirkless, despite several suicides happening there in a short succession. Blueberry happened to know one of the people who killed themselves, and making her not cackle maniacally while the building exploded (on camera) was Mr. Compress‚Äô greatest achievement of teaching. 

They also make it a point in the recording that the two policemen that were actually trying to do something about the issue and one that joined said precinct AFTER the fact were purposefully lured out of the building before the explosion AND that they made sure to make the boom happen when there were no civilians inside. 

QEM‚Äôs membership number skyrocketed overnight. Blueberry began to organize local cells. All you really had to do (with modern internet being this fast) was to host your villain forum in some failed state where police no longer existed or was officially working for the local villains, and your villain group could work semi-openly on the internet. 

That and watch for undercover policemen and heroes. 

Official denouncement of Sunset being Eclipse‚Äôs daughter (and of that brainwashing talk) plus the online screeching from QLF‚Äôs fanboys was a music to Legion‚Äôs ears. Overhaul was probably clawing his eyes out in fury over getting kicked in the PR.

Izuku was going to have two birthday parties. One organized by the League of Villains, and one in his home. It didn‚Äôt really matter which one was going to happen first - he wasn‚Äôt getting alcohol in either, and everything else was just a matter of tiredness. He went with the League‚Äôs part first, in the end. 

It was fun. Happy atmosphere, lots of laughter, a cake shaped after Thunderbolt‚Äôs helmet (he enjoyed cutting that apart with a really large knife). Presents. A new videogame from Tenko, a very nice blade from Uncle Stain‚Ä¶ well, a lot of presents. Most of them are reasonably normal.

Himiko gave him a page from a notebook with a large ‚ÄòThreesome Pass‚Äô written on it. He almost threw her through the window (not like they had any in their base), but then she quickly said that it was just a joke and offered him a drawing that she commissioned someone to do. 

Very high quality image of slightly too buffy version of Izuku standing on the backs of Thunderbolt and Eclipse (both on all fours), with an Endeavor in a butler suit standing next to him, with a selection of drinks on a platter.

Never in his life was he more confused than when she showed him the picture.

HaremMistress: Damn it, it didn't work!

DevotedSlave: I noticed

DevotedSlave: It wasn‚Äôt exactly subtle. 

DevotedSlave: also shouldn‚Äôt it be a Foursome Pass?

HaremMistress: I was trying to be delicate about it, so start from 3

DevotedSlave: Delicate? 

HaremMistress: C‚Äômon, I‚Äôm a queen of subtlety when compared to BabyFactory

DevotedSlave: I‚Äôm afraid of asking but what did she do?

HaremMistress: see this pic

DevotedSlave: oh

DevotedSlave: my

DevotedSlave: god

HaremMistress: See? queen of subtlety

DevotedSlave: Is this‚Ä¶ no, just no

HaremMistress: I told her to drop it and make a present that will not make him murder everyone in the room and then off himself

DevotedSlave: let‚Äôs never speak of this again

HaremMistress: I agree

DevotedSlave: great

DevotedSlave: did he at least like the drawing?

HaremMistress: yes, said that whoever drew it is super-good, but I think it was a bit too weird

DevotedSlave: so, what next?

HaremMistress: make that ‚ÄòIzuku as a postapo warlord on the ruins of hero commission building surrounded by harem and lieutenants of his army‚Äô drawing we talked about

DevotedSlave: sure, but give me a bit of a break for a day or two, I hurried the first one to make it for the birthday 

DevotedSlave: despite Mr.Compress being a demanding director

DevotedSlave: I‚Äôm a bit overworked 

HaremMistress: you‚Äôre right, my bad

HaremMistress: wait, I‚Äôm processing what you just said, and I‚Äôm kinda shocked you found time to draw it actually

HaremMistress: like, when did you sleep

DevotedSlave: the real question is ‚Äòhow did you sleep‚Äô and the answer is ‚Äòalone, unfortunately‚Äô

HaremMistress: got it, got it, don‚Äôt get sassy on me, I‚Äôm working on it! geez

The second birthday party was much more subdued. Eri was around, being as cute as always but even more chatty. She had a lot to talk about concerning her school - she absolutely loved it and it seemed that she already befriended everyone within a two kilometers radius from it. 

Izuku wasn‚Äôt surprised. 

It was, in a way, a repetition of the mom‚Äôs birthday party, but izuku-centric. His parents bought him a collection of reprints of old superhero comics. Eri gave him a scarf that she apparently knitted with only ‚Äòminimum‚Äô help from mom. 

Izuku was overjoyed. If it didn‚Äôt risk Eri finding out, he would have integrated the scarf into his villain outfit. 

Eventually things settled down, and they began to chat about various things. And once the non-villainous subjects ended, Eri recognized the atmosphere and vanished from the room. 

‚ÄúSo, how‚Äôs your business doing?‚Äù All for One asks. They sit around the table, with Izuku facing his parents. He decides that this is how being interrogated by the police must feel like. ‚ÄúI assume you are focused on killing Overhaul again.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúThis is a bit of a focus.‚Äù They ramped up the security surrounding Eri even before the Hero Commission announced that Overhaul was the new leader of the QLF. They didn‚Äôt mention a lot, but his extreme expertise in quirk sciences was on the list. The forums were still filled with discussions on what exactly he did (other than quirk suppressing gas, but that was old news) to warrant immediate SSS-Rank and an open ‚Äòkill-on-sight regardless of collateral damage‚Äô order. 

‚ÄúYou got him once, you‚Äôll get him twice.‚Äù Hisashi says with a reassuring smile. His pep talk skill is probably the best of his social skills, although Izuku prefers to not think about why he was so experienced with it. There aren‚Äôt many words, but somehow Izuku truly believes in them. Is some quirk involved? ‚ÄúHe is good, I give him that much. Besides, the Sunset‚Äôs debut probably just split his powerbase in half, so he‚Äôll struggle with further recruitment.‚Äù 

He really has to mention it. His mom knows and is giving him The Stare. So he braces himself for the imminent chaos. 

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù He says quietly. He isn‚Äôt sure how to start the talk, and is still mulling over possible scenarios when his father accidentally helps him.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm kinda surprised by the fact that Eclipse had a child.‚Äù Hizashi continues. ‚ÄúShe never mentioned it. I honestly thought that she married the concept of quirkless liberation and had no time for men in her life. Though I also do remember some gossip about her swinging the other way‚Ä¶ then again, Sunset clearly has an extremely similar quirk to Eclipse‚Äôs, so that‚Äôs a solid proof of family bonds.‚Äù 

Alright, Izuku thinks to himself. Now or never.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a similar quirk.‚Äù Izuku says, and Hizashi looks at him with a surprise on his face. This is clearly an almost identical quirk, and he knows his son to be an excellent quirk analyst, so why‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the same quirk.‚Äù 

He can see it on his face - Midoriya Hisashi is having some complicated internal struggle. Probably trying to persuade himself that he really heard it. And then trying to persuade himself that it truly means IT. 

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt.‚Äù In the end, he struggles too much to get there on his own. So he asks for help. And Izuku gives it. 

‚ÄúSunset was my spy in the QLF.‚Äù He replies. ‚ÄúShe has contacts in the quirkless groups throughout the country. And when I offered her Eclipse‚Äôs quirk in exchange for working for me as the head of the Quirkless Equality Movement, she agreed instantly.‚Äù 

Mom smiles. She probably knows that there is a reason that he doesn‚Äôt mention what happened to Eclipse. Midoriya Inko is and always will be supporting her son, whatever he would be doing. Even now, she sees herself and Hisashi in her son. He had her looks, his smarts‚Ä¶ and moral creed somewhere between theirs. So she doesn‚Äôt ask. 

Hisashi doesn‚Äôt even try to pretend. None of his classical ‚Äòstylish‚Äô act. He simply stands from his chair, walks around the table and grabs Izuku into a beary hug. 

He activates Strength Amp out of reflex. Probably some aftermath of getting almost crushed to death by Mei. Then again, his dad is absolutely enormous. All Might‚Äôs height. Intimidating to say the least. 

‚ÄúSon, I‚Äôm so very proud of you.‚Äù Hisashi says, and Izuku knows that he truly means it. ‚ÄúIt also makes me proud of myself, to be honest.‚Äù He adds, his head leaning back and giving his son some breathing space. ‚ÄúYou decided to accept another part of my heritage, despite me not insisting on it. This means that your old man can‚Äôt be THAT bad, right?‚Äù 

Izuku remembers his father from the times before Eri got adopted by them. Part of him honestly suspects that Eri‚Äôs has a complex mutant quirk making her impossibly cute (and flaring up positive emotions of everyone in the vicinity) alongside of her Rewind quirk. Sure, Hisashi acted decently in front of his son back then. He was smart enough to know that pushing too much would only make Izuku, the hero fanboy, rebound in anger. But words like that last sentence would have never come out of his mouth back then. 

‚ÄúI decided to accept all of it, dad.‚Äù Izuku replies, and his dad stares at him even more. ‚ÄúSave for the worst crimes. So‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve decided to actually become the Symbol of Evil. Like you did.‚Äú

For a second he thinks that something glistened in his father‚Äôs eyes. He doesn‚Äôt believe that Midoriya Hisashi CAN cry. But he isn‚Äôt given the time to investigate before he gets another hug. This time much stronger. 

He really thinks that his dad broke some of his ribs this time. He overhauls himself just in case, while his mom is using her most dangerous weapon (rolled newspaper) to teach her husband something about restraint. 

When things calm down, he has a long talk with his parents about his new subsidiary groups. Dad is especially amused and intrigued by Kurogiri‚Äôs idea of organizing an underground training organization for the aspiring villains - Izuku does his best to not get snarky about how it‚Äôs much simpler idea than using some weird drugs (Villain Factory was and is one of his father‚Äôs dumber ideas and he isn‚Äôt budging on that). 

He also mentions how his girlfriend decided that normal teasing no longer facilitates enough of a reaction in him, so she moved on to group teasing. And how Gremlin seems to be in on it. Hizashi laughs and gives him the ‚Äògo for it, son‚Äô blink. Mom confuses him deeply by sighing and saying something alongside of ‚Äòah, to be young again‚Äô. 

He expected some understanding and then laughing about it together, instead he was mostly greenlighted. Then again, he asked a two-centuries old criminal mastermind and woman who jumped between buildings and robbed people blind while wearing skin tight black cat costume. 

His family isn‚Äôt normal, and he is reminded of it for the hundredth time.

But he would never change it for any other. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúDo you have it?‚Äù An old voice says in the darkness. The man whose men fill the warehouse is tired of a lot of things, and having to do things like this are on the list. 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He says. A small package changes hands. ‚ÄúOverhaul‚Äôs research data, straight from the I-Island. Shield doesn‚Äôt know that we‚Äôve got it, and neither does High Mind. They still think that it was a terrorist attack, not a distraction.‚Äù 

Islanders prepared against a quirkless raid, for some reason. He managed to make his operation look like one. It wasn‚Äôt easy, but‚Ä¶ well, he was skillful enough to pull it off. 

‚ÄúWonderful, wonderful!‚Äù Some faint screeching noise from the background. He and his people seem equally unnerved by it. ‚ÄúAre you interested in joining me for some long-term cooperation, Wolfram? I happen to be in need of competent people. I plan something big, yes, something extremely big! Something to change Japan.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSorry, but no.‚Äù Wolfram is certain about it. He is already getting giddy when thinking about all the villains around the world to whom he can also sell the data. And unnerved by the noises he hears for a while now. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do political stuff.‚Äù He does, he just doesn‚Äôt trust the man in front of him.

‚ÄúHow sad.‚Äù The old man says. ‚ÄúI preferred you to be willing participants of what‚Äôs to come.‚Äù Wolfram understands what was just said and tries to activate his quirk.

He hears the screams of his men. And then darkness overtakes him.

Chapter Text

Mr. Principal: I believe that all of us should be in possession of the comm-item, so I‚Äôll take this occasion to make an announcement.

Mr. Principal: The acquaintance with quirk-detecting quirk has finished his inspection of the UA.

Mr. Principal: He found signs of an active quirk in my office, in the teacher‚Äôs lounge and in the Recovery Girl‚Äôs office.

Mr. Principal: I desire murder. 

SuperPunch: Oh. Now that‚Äôs unexpected. 

TruthDetector: To quote someone we all know, ‚ÄúOh dear‚Äù. 

DeadpanStalker: First of all, it‚Äôs regrettable to see my suspicions confirmed. Second of all, why aren‚Äôt we simply using our names and who thought that it was a good idea to name me DeadpanStalker? 

CatsCoffeeNap: Yeah, I wonder about that myself.

Tintin: Tintin? 

RoadRunner: If it‚Äôs your idea, Toshinori, you are dead. 

SuperPunch: IT‚ÄôS NOT MY IDEA I SWEAR!!!

Mr. Principal: I regret to inform you that due to Power Loader wanting to make this line super secure, changing anything once it was set up is impossible. 

DeadpanStalker: And it‚Äôs a coincidence that your name happens to be your hero name, as the only one of us all?
RecoveryGirl: Not quite.

CatsCoffeeNap: why is her nickname normal too

Tintin: Can someone explain my nickname to me, please? I think I‚Äôm missing a joke.

DeadpanStalker: I‚Äôll do that after this talk, Mirio.

Mr. Principal: Shame that the mess with the nicknames happened, I‚Äôll find the person responsible for it.

CatsCoffeeNap: I‚Äôm in front of your office right now, I can hear your sadistic, maniacal laughter from here, Nedzu.

Mr. Principal: Well, I said I‚Äôll find the person responsible. I didn‚Äôt say that said person isn‚Äôt me, or that I‚Äôll do anything about the issue. 

CatsCoffeeNap: You know what, I don‚Äôt care.

CatsCoffeeNap: The entire computer system of the UA working for a 1000 years would still fail to calculate just how much I don‚Äôt care.

CatsCoffeeNap: Now, what do we do about the spy issue?

Mr. Principal: You‚Äôll be crucial in untangling that mystery, Aizawa.

CatsCoffeeNap: are you going to pay me extra for this

Mr. Principal: The budget doesn‚Äôt allow it. 

CatsCoffeeNap: You use godzilla-sized combat robots for an entrance exam and you tell me that you can‚Äôt pay me for working overtime? 

Mr. Principal: Yes.

CatsCoffeeNap: Do you think that League of Villains is open for recruitment? They have a large budget AND I have experience in dealing with kids who are slowly but surely killing me. Also Mindscrew looks like my mood kindred.

Mr. Principal: Alright, no need to get that far! I‚Äôm sure we can come to an accomodation.

SuperPunch: If I still had a stomach, I‚Äôd run to the nearest shop and grab some popcorn. 

Tintin: I‚Äôd join the effort, if I‚Äôm to be honest. 

RoadRunner: sometimes even you get a good idea, toshinori

Mr. Principal: We‚Äôll start by excluding the teachers from the list of the suspects. I‚Äôll have them gathered soon and have Aizawa use his quirk on them while my quirk-detecting friend will be with me in my office. If the surveillance quirk vanishes, we‚Äôll know that it‚Äôs one of them. 

DeadpanStalker: It‚Äôs impractical to try that with the students, however. And I‚Äôm almost certain it‚Äôs one of them.

SuperPunch: Why?

DeadpanStalker: All for One has already tried infiltrating the faculty. Multiple times. Even so many years after his death, Nedzu‚Äôs background checks are stuff of a legend. But - only for the faculty. 

Mr. Principal: It is regrettable, but I have to agree with Sir Nighteye. I‚Äôm going to background check every single student right now (I already started). We can‚Äôt have Eraserhead test every student. If we do it by class, we‚Äôll only know which class the spy is in. If we do it one by one, our chances of catching the spy BEFORE he catches the wind of what is happening and vanishes, or worse, on us, are minimal.  

TruthDetector: What‚Äôs worse? 

Mr. Principal: Murder someone before vanishing, plant a bomb in the school, unleash some dangerous intel upon the world?

TruthDetector: I shouldn‚Äôt have asked. 

DeadpanStalker: No one with appropriate quirk within the student list? 

Mr. Principal: No. Which carries some worrying implications.

SuperPunch: Like? 

Mr. Principal: Like one of the students managing to hide a re-awakening of their quirk or some special, surveillance-oriented ability from us. 

Mr. Principal: Or one of them having two quirks. 

RoadRunner: no just no

TruthDetector: I agree that chances of this are‚Ä¶ minuscule. 

DeadpanStalker: yes

Mr. Principal: Not as minuscule as I‚Äôd like to admit. 

SuperPunch: Nedzu. Talk to us. Now. 

Mr. Principal: It‚Äôs not confirmed evidence. But I had someone trustworthy analyze bits of Legion‚Äôs blood that we found in Hosu.

DeadpanStalker: And?

Mr. Principal: It was heavily degraded and polluted, but my contact found genetic markers and certain blood anomalies indicating the presence of multiple quirks. He estimates that he is something about 70% certain that the results are correct. 

RoadRunner: Fuck. 

TruthDetector: Just don‚Äôt tell me that All for One is alive. Please. I had enough of him for a lifetime.

SuperPunch: Are you saying that Legion HAS that man‚Äôs quirk??! 

TruthDetector: Marginally less horrible prospect. 

Mr. Principal: As I said, the samples were heavily degraded. It is not confirmed knowledge. The analysis of the leftover blood of the noumus (both Hellhound and the ones in Hosu) confirmed the existence of multiple quirks in them as well. 

Mr. Principal: One of them was cut rather nasty and a local hero gathered a sample of its blood for an analysis BEFORE QLF attack. So it was cleaner than the rest. I confirmed the presence of four different quirks, but not any form or variant of All for One. 

Mr. Principal: The noumu in question appears to have been originally a dog. Using animals for quirk implantation is something new, and certainly not AlO‚Äôs modus operandi. Besides, we now know of at least a single person capable of bestowing quirks other than AlO (namely, Overhaul). And we don‚Äôt know how to discern their methods through laboratory analysis yet.

Mr. Principal: There is also a very high chance that AlO granted quirks to Legion before his demise. We all know that giving quirks to quirkless family members as a form of control is something with a precedence in his case, and he could get particularly charitable with a quirkless child who loved quirks so much. Legion might, so to say, be liquidating remaining assets from his father‚Äôs time (namely, the noumus). 

Mr. Principal: I have actually looked back to certain archived police data and I‚Äôve located symptoms of multiple quirk implantations in a villain connected to the Villain Factory case. B-Rank Villain known only as ‚ÄúHooded Man‚Äô, not heard about since then. It was two years before All for One‚Äôs death, if he was some early noumu then we can be certain that AlO was working on them for at least several more years before his demise. 

Mr. Principal: If AlO worked on finding a way to install multiple quirks in others (hence, noumus), there is a chance that whoever is the spy within UA is a carrier of multiple quirks as well. 

DeadpanStalker: I can find a few issues with your theories. 

DeadpanStalker: The most glaring is the chronology. If the Hooded Man was ‚Äòmerely‚Äô a B-Rank in terms of strength, then how likely is it that the All for One jumped from him to Hellhound in two years only? How much more sense would it make if someone continued working on noumus? Additional six years of experimentation make things way more sensible. 

Mr. Principal: You are unfortunately correct. Which would indicate that League has access to someone with ability to transfer quirks. 

RoadRunner: So‚Ä¶ Legion HAS AlO or not? And is that man alive or not?

DeadpanStalker: We don‚Äôt know. It is possible that being a son of AlO simply imparted Legion with greater resistance to the (almost certain) side-effects of multiple quirk implantations (we know AlO tried that in the past and the result was turning victims brain-dead from the strain) even without the quirk itself, just like children of flame-quirk users are often quite heat-resistant. 

Mr. Principal: Then it makes perfect sense for AlO to stuff his son with all the quirks he can handle - something that was certainly painful and might explain the subsequent rebellion. But it still doesn‚Äôt explain the noumus. 

Tintin: What if they do not belong to the League? 

DeadpanStalker: Explain?

Tintin: They weren‚Äôt housed in the League‚Äôs base. And I did get a feeling that despite all that camaraderie and genuine friendship, even League members didn‚Äôt know a lot about them. 

Tintin: This implies that the noumus aren‚Äôt a product of League and Legion, but of some unspecified third party, that lends them to the League when needed. If Legion truly is AlO‚Äôs successor, or at least some form of heir apparent, it makes sense for him to have contacts with some other remnant groups of AlO‚Äôs empire, yes?

Mr. Principal: Oh. So another group altogether, with an ability to bestow quirks and produce the noumus, who is using the League of Villains as a distraction? Some form of post-Villain Factory?

DeadpanStalker: Interesting idea. What are the chances that said group IS the AlO himself?

Tintin: You told me a lot about him. He doesn‚Äôt strike me as a person who would use quirked animals for experiments instead of much more available humans (like that Hooded Man). 

Mr. Principal: Oh dear.

SuperPunch: Oh no, not one of those

Mr. Principal: There is a recently emergent supervillain known only as Nine that, now that I think about it, might be involved. 

SuperPunch: why?

Mr. Principal: Because I watched a recording of his fight with some heroes. It didn‚Äôt occur to me back then, but now I‚Äôm something like 50% sure that he might be a multiple quirk user too. But he focused on one quirk. Might have slipped in one moment. I think he was wounded in that battle, I‚Äôll have someone analyze his blood for quirk markers. 

Mr. Principal: I‚Äôll focus on that AND on subtle background checks of the students. Aizawa, get ready for inspection of the faculty in 30 minutes. 

TruthDetector: This investigation is a nightmare and I just can‚Äôt wake up from it. 

 

***

 

Frankly speaking, the week after Izuku‚Äôs birthday was a boring one. If you exclude blowing up a factory (and causing massive property damage), nothing interesting happened. Then again, everyone probably needed this. 

Izuku was busy. His day was mostly composed of looking for wherever Overhaul holed himself in AND helping Blueberry set up the QEM‚Äôs organizational framework and train her quirk. When he had some remaining free time, he visited his family, played video games with Tenko or went on their equivalent of dates with Himiko. 

He managed to confirm that her quirk makes her stronger, faster, but way less sane (and easier to exhaust) while blood starved. They didn‚Äôt go far with that, but it was still an interesting and potentially useful thing to know. 

He noticed something was amiss during one of the evenings. He tended to spend those with Himiko, in their room, typically watching films. About heroes and villains if he was the one to choose, or about vampires, generalized fantasy and romance when Himiko did. 

That one evening was one of hers. He tried his best to not look bored, but he did jump into the Villain Network when she paused the film and went out to use the toilet. He moved around at random, trying to not doze off. When she returned, he had lots of questions. 

‚ÄúHimi. We need to talk.‚Äù She froze in the middle of the room, while he stared at her from bed. ‚ÄúAs a leader of your villainous team I have access to the list and general stats of the chatrooms you are in. Can you tell me why there are so many new messages and one more member in that harem chat?‚Äù 347 new messages in a chatroom within twenty-hour hours by only THREE users? That was worrying. 

‚ÄúErrr‚Ä¶‚Äù Himiko acts like a deer caught in the car‚Äôs headlights. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶ think of this as your personal fanclub, of sorts? Just a girls-only one.‚Äù She is doing her best, but the car‚Äôs still going at her. 

‚ÄúFanclub?‚Äù He is afraid to ask. ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù She nods furiously. ‚ÄúWho is the new member?‚Äù 

‚ÄúBlueberry!‚Äù She replies. 

Of course it‚Äôs Blueberry, Izuku thinks. He noticed the stares. 

‚ÄúHimi, please stop with the teasing, alright?‚Äù Midoriya Izuku is tired of it. Like, really tired. He does get the fact that he has an actual fanclub out there (most of the members appear to be some really weird people that he certainly DOESN‚ÄôT want to meet), but this is getting frankly disturbing. 

‚ÄúWhat teasing?‚Äù She tilts her head a bit and eyes him curiously.

‚ÄúYou know what teasing.‚Äù He is doing his best to NOT be angry. ‚ÄúThe harem thing. I get it that I stopped responding as well to your standard teasing, mostly by the virtue of getting used to it. But please stop with the group teasing stuff.‚Äù 

She chuckles a bit, crosses the distance between them in like two seconds (the bed shakes a bit when she lands on it) and hugs him. He is just slightly confused (he still didn‚Äôt figure out the whole relationship thing, although he does his best). Then their eyes met from up close. 

‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not teasing, silly!‚Äù She gives him a wide smile. ‚ÄúYou are so wonderful that I can‚Äôt just hog you all to myself, yes?‚Äù 

He is a supervillain for several months. Villain for several years. Son of All for One for his entire life. He has (almost) enough willpower to not react to that announcement with a visible shock. 

Almost.

So he stares at her in silence. Himiko, of course, takes the ‚Äòoh my god what did you just say‚Äô silence for ‚Äòplease continue‚Äô silence and keeps talking .

‚ÄúYou are super smart, you are super dangerous, and you are also the kindest and nicest person I have ever met!‚Äù She lists with a cheerful smile. ‚ÄúYou are absolutely the best boyfriend I could imagine. So when I see a girl I like being alone and sad, how can I keep you all to myself?‚Äù 

He really doesn‚Äôt want to unpack what he just heard. But he realizes he probably has to because he ignored an issue and let it grow due to thinking it was just her idea of a joke. Wonderful. 

‚ÄúSo I got Mei and Blueberry together.‚Äù Himiko continues. ‚ÄúWe talk about how awesome you are. We try to make you take the hint, which is honestly hard because you are kinda a dummy in those things. I‚Äôm also writing a story about you and Blueberry is making drawings of you!‚Äù He really, REALLY hopes that clothes are actually involved in those drawings. ‚ÄúMei also did something but we promised to never speak of it again. So I won‚Äôt.‚Äù 

Now if that isn‚Äôt scary. 

Izuku fights the urge to jump off the bed and knock himself unconscious by trying to destroy the nearest wall with his head. Somehow he wins. 

Why can‚Äôt he have an actually NORMAL friend for once? He likes League members and he would probably give his life for them if needed, but he is acutely aware that they aren‚Äôt ‚Äònormal‚Äô. More like a family of societal outcasts that have more mental disorders and daddy (or mommy or parental in general) issues that he likes to admit. 

He and Kurogiri are the only even remotely functional people in that group. And as much as he hates to admit it, he is the more important one of the two. Izuku still remembers what sort of state the League was in when he returned from that one-month trip overseas with his family a year ago. 

It was the first time he saw Kurogiri cry. In relief, when he saw that Izuku was back. Like whatever Mei did, the details of the incident were consigned into oblivion by acclamation. 

Ironically enough, the closest thing Izuku has to a ‚Äònormal‚Äô friend is probably Lemillion. And he would still punch Legion in the face if he saw him, due to the whole hero/villain dichotomy. 

Izuku spends a few seconds considering the idea of making a false internet account to befriend Lemillion on some social media and ask him for relationship tips. The fact that the heir of All for One considers doing that with a heir of All Might is probably the best image of just how incredibly lost and confused Izuku is right now. 

The fact that he decides to do that in the end just makes it sad. Then again, having a contact like that might be useful in his job as well. 

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ you say that those two are, uhm, actually interested?‚Äù He decides to gather some additional information. He isn‚Äôt sure why Blueberry‚Äôs even there, and Mei has probably just got roped into it by Himiko. 

‚ÄúYep yep!‚Äù Himiko is incredibly cheerful and probably deeply happy by The Talk happening and Izuku finally getting the hint. ‚ÄúMei said that she is interested in making a sapient and organic baby for once, and that you would be a source of high quality material for it! And then you blew up a Detnerat factory for her. She thinks it was the bestest thing ever!‚Äù 

Izuku finds the ‚Äòsapient organic baby‚Äô bit extremely disturbing to say the least. But it also looks like Hatsume Mei, the resident mad scientist, was awoken to the concepts of sex and relationships. He can scarcely believe it. 

‚ÄúAnd Blueberry thinks that you are cute, awesome because you gave her a quirk, smart, and, to quote, ‚Äúfriend told me that the shyest people are always the wildest‚Äô.‚Äù Izuku isn‚Äôt going to ask. ‚ÄúAlso when I found out how many things she crammed into her timetable, I asked her, to quote, ‚Äòwhen did you sleep‚Äô to which she answered that the real question is how did she sleep, and the answer to that is ‚Äòalone, unfortunately‚Äô, so‚Ä¶ I think she‚Äôs in too?‚Äù

Izuku is slowly approaching the dreadful realization that they might actually mean it all. 

His life as a supervillain (and, earlier, supervillain-to-be) didn‚Äôt prepare him to deal with bullshit of this magnitude. 

He didn‚Äôt know how to deal with Himiko alone. Getting to deal with what sounds like three Himikos at once sounds like the worst idea ever. 

Sure, he is a teenager. Sure, hormones are a pain to deal with. But he is also an intelligent person. Part of him might be happily supporting the idea, but he knows better. He has to end this burning mess right now. Himiko might be crazy (a bit, and in a way that keeps her functional), but she will understand the straight ‚Äòno‚Äô, right?

‚ÄúI... ‚Äú He says confidently. ‚Äú...need to think about that.‚Äù 

He screams internally. At himself.

Mirio Togata: No way. 

Akatani Mikumo: Sorry. 

Mirio Togata: Why are you messaging me? 

Mirio Togata: also you do realize that I‚Äôm going to have to report that to Sir Nighteye and All Might, yes?

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôd prefer to avoid it, it‚Äôs not really‚Ä¶ business stuff? Something private.

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶

Mirio Togata: You are the absolutely weirdest villain I ever met, you know that?

Akatani Mikumo: Was that a compliment?

Mirio Togata: No.

Akatani Mikumo: Awww.

Mirio Togata: Okay, you know what, alright.

Mirio Togata: I‚Äôm going to tell them anything that I think might be useful in catching you or taking down the League, but nothing other than that. Nor the existence of this talk, if I can avoid it in any reasonable way.

Mirio Togata: Consider this a payback for saving me, Ingenium and Gran Torino from Eclipse. I do not like being in debt to a villain in any way, shape and form. 

Akatani Mikumo: Awesome!

Akatani Mikumo: I have a problem. Heart problem. 

Mirio Togata: Shouldn‚Äôt you talk about that with a doctor?

Akatani Mikumo: Not that type of heart problem, dammit, why is this so damn complicated

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶ are you asking me for advice on relationships? 

Akatani Mikumo: Yes!

Mirio Togata: You. A supervillain. Are asking me. All Might‚Äôs successor. For relationship advice.

Akatani Mikumo: Yes? 

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶ 

Mirio Togata: What‚Äôs the problem? I thought you were doing alright with Vampire?

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôm doing too well with Vampire.

Mirio Togata: What?

Akatani Mikumo: She decided that I‚Äôm too perfect to monopolize, and is in the process of trying to organize me a harem of beautiful and deadly female villains. She already has two more members in, and they are apparently writing stories about me and making drawings of me while talking about how awesome I am. 

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶ 

Akatani Mikumo: I don‚Äôt know how to deal with it. And I‚Äôm too afraid to ask about details of the stories and drawings.

Mirio Togata: Shouldn‚Äôt I be the one to ask YOU about tips on relationships?

Akatani Mikumo: Shit not you too

Akatani Mikumo: I asked my mom for help and she made a weird face and said something like ‚Äòah to be young again‚Äô

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôm too terrified of the implications to try digging into that

Mirio Togata: I think I can understand why. 

Akatani Mikumo: And I literally have no one else even relatively sane & adult around me [other than Kurogiri, but he is a father figure to ‚Öî of the girls involved and is already passive-aggressive about me not marrying Vampire yet]

Akatani Mikumo: help

Mirio Togata: Literally no one else? 

Akatani Mikumo: Lemillion, 16-20 years old kids don‚Äôt turn into villainy and don‚Äôt storm the newspaper headlines like that without serious issues

Akatani Mikumo: I sometimes feel like I‚Äôm running a kindergarten for mentally challenged psychopaths

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôm not even trying to count how many of us ended up killing one or more members of their families on either an accident or after snapping under the abuse

Akatani Mikumo: I had to bribe Decay with videogames to go to a therapy so that he would stop wearing severed and preserved hands of his family members as a part of his villain outfit ffs

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶ 

Akatani Mikumo: He was actually talking to them. Their presence consoled him. He got regular panic attacks when he wasn‚Äôt wearing at least one at any given moment. Creepy af.

Mirio Togata: I don‚Äôt even know how to answer that. 

Akatani Mikumo: You don‚Äôt turn a hundred cultists into dust while screaming stuff like ‚Äògive me the sweet exp, you low level trash‚Äô without having serious mental problems.

Mirio Togata: Please stop telling me things I don‚Äôt want to know and move over to the main subject.

Akatani Mikumo: So I made a list of people that I know (even passingly), and I know them to be normal and reasonably‚Ä¶ reasonable, and it‚Äôs literally just your name on an otherwise empty page

Mirio Togata: I‚Äôm so confused and part of me suspects that I‚Äôm dreaming. 

Akatani Mikumo: Welcome to my world. 

Mirio Togata: Also you do realize that I‚Äôm legally obligated to tell you to go after all three of them will all your might, so that you have much less time left to villainy and will be too focused on pursuing the relationship to focus on your goals, thus making you commit mistake and eventually get caught? 

Akatani Mikumo: yes?

Mirio Togata: Okay, so with that done, let‚Äôs talk.

 

***

 

Mr. Principal: I have the results of the analysis. Nine carries no less than four quirks, including what appears to be All for One. 

SuperPunch: Well, shit. 

RoadRunner: Looks like something we can agree on

Mr. Principal: Good news is that it‚Äôs not ‚ÄòTHE‚Äô All for One. And by AlO I mean the quirk. 

DeadpanStalker: What?
Mr. Principal: It appears to be a massively inferior form of the genuine article. It‚Äôs hard to say how exactly AlO did it, but he managed to impart some form of a ‚Äòcopy‚Äô of his quirk to that individual. 

Mr. Principal: The blood is also ‚Äòweird‚Äô. Nine isn‚Äôt fully human - he carries signs of extensive genetic and biological modifications, but we cannot tell how extensive without actually getting to examine his body. 

DeadpanStalker: So he can transfer quirks in order to produce the noumus, but can‚Äôt possibly reach the power level of true All for One. How many quirks can he keep active at once? 

Mr. Principal: Either one or two but they get weaker when used simultaneously. And since he has only a handful of quirks, there is probably also a storage limit. 

Mr. Principal: Nine himself isn‚Äôt an existential threat, the real problems are Noumus and whoever is making them. 

Mr. Principal: Either Overhaul was in bed with All for One in the past (unlikely considering the age difference) and inherited his noumu project or we have another mad scientist out there. One to match Overhaul in morals and knowledge. Nine is probably helping whoever that is with the quirk transfer. 

DeadpanStalker: What‚Äôs with all the mad scientists popping up in Japan recently? First Overhaul, now our mysterious second person, and after having a talk with Power Loader about it, I‚Äôm starting to suspect that Gremlin is approaching similar status. 

CatsCoffeeNap: What did he say? 

DeadpanStalker: That even after analyzing all the recordings, he still has no idea of how she created a portable railgun capable of packing this degree of punch. I think I‚Äôm going to bring that to David Shield tomorrow. 

CatsCoffeeNap: If I officially give up on overtime pay and bonuses from now onwards, will you, my dearest and most beloved Principal, prepare us all a secret fund to organize our escape from the country when things (inevitably) go to Hell?

TruthDetector: You speaking like that is the most unholy thing I ever saw, Eraserhead. 

RecoveryGirl: Never do it again.

SuperPunch: I agree.

Mr. Principal: I would have never done such a thing! And I certainly didn‚Äôt do it already. On an unrelated note, how large do you want that tropical island to be? 

SuperPunch: Knowing your funding and approach to spending the money, you probably made the entire school capable of going airborne and flying to America when no one was looking. 

Mr. Principal: Now that‚Äôs a brilliant idea! Why didn‚Äôt you tell me that earlier? 

SuperPunch: I will not dignify that with an answer.

DeadpanStalker: How‚Äôs the search for the spy going, by the way?

Mr. Principal: Teachers are clear. But I‚Äôve made a vow to start doing PROPER background checks on ALL first year students. From now on. 

DeadpanStalker: ‚Ä¶ that bad? 

Mr. Principal: I already found seven first year students with some degree of potential contact with various subversive (if not villainous) groups out there. Nothing warranting expulsion, for the record - it‚Äôs all relatively minor things. For example Ibara Shiozaki of class 1-B has a cousin who is on the watchlist over suspected connections with some minor Christian terror group. He is apparently estranged, but I think that it‚Äôs a ruse. In fact, I suspect that she might be a part of it together with him.

DeadpanStalker: Being a part of a terror group doesn‚Äôt warrant expulsion? Is this a part of some long-term plan to get Legion to join the UA?

Mr. Principal: I might not be sharing their beliefs, but I‚Äôm not entirely adverse to the operations of the group in question. And I certainly question their status as ‚Äòa terror group‚Äô. 

Mr. Principal: They bombed out (empty) governmental office due to its head using their position to steal property from a peaceful religious group, which resulted in said group having their place of worship and cemetery levelled down. And replaced them with an apartment building, whose owner almost certainly bribed the official I mentioned to achieve it. Naturally, he managed to avoid responsibility (at least until the religious group turned non-peaceful and the bomb exploded).

Mr. Principal: Disagree with me all you want, but I would still let her join as a student even if I knew about it beforehand. I consider UA to be something more than a hero factory. Our job is to take children with dreams and means to strive towards them (through intellect or quirks) and make sure that they achieve those dreams without turning to villainy. Ibara Shiozaki is a one-time vigilante at worst, in my opinion. She needs guidance, not expulsion.

Mr. Principal: This doesn‚Äôt change the fact that people like her should be noticed earlier and properly observed. So from now on, I‚Äôm doing proper background checks of all students. 

Mr. Principal: But this also means that narrowing down the list of potential spies will be‚Ä¶ less successful than I thought. 

Mr. Principal: On a sidenote, from next year onwards, UA is going to have three hero classes. The third one will be a rehabilitation class for young vigilantes and small-time villains who appear to have both potential to be something more and a potential to be reformed into proper members of the society. I also think it might be a good idea to leave one or two slots in our hero course exclusive to the quirkless.

CatsCoffeeNap: What about NOT using robots during the entrance exam to give people with non-flashy quirks a fighting chance?

Mr. Principal: If we are going to make reforms, we could as well make them wholeheartedly. So yes, there will be changes to that as well. 

CatsCoffeeNap: Great. What about giving teachers a raise once you no longer have to spend money on giant death robots?

CatsCoffeeNap: Of course he went offline at the mention eh
Notes:

    Just so we're clear.

    Lemillion and Legion internet chats are going to be a semi-regular thing. Lemillion is still trying to arrest Legion. He is also trying to fish for useful intel. And, honestly, vice versa. So it's not like they suddenly started to be friends :v

Chapter 25: First Contact
Summary:

    Harem developments. Mustard's backstory is revealed. Izuku's friendship(???) with Lemillion and his love for quirks backfires spectacularly.

Chapter Text

HaremMistress: GIRLS! GIRLS! 

DevotedSlave: ? 

BabyFactory: Yes?

HaremMistress: I‚Äôm in my room rn, I just had a talk with Zuku

HaremMistress: About US. 

Devoted Slave: Oh? 

BabyFactory: Did he agree? Can I start working on our baby?

HaremMistress: Our silly cinnamon roll still thought that we were just teasing him and weren‚Äôt serious about it, ha! :D 

HaremMistress: I explained that we are serious, he went super shy and blushed like crazy (I love when he does that) and said that he has to think about it!

DevotedSlave: So he didn‚Äôt say no?

HaremMistress: yep

DevotedSlave: It‚Äôs working, then. 

HaremMistress: YEP, just a few more steps and he‚Äôs in

HaremMistress: And then‚Ä¶ then we can do things!

DevotedSlave: things‚Ä¶ like? 

HaremMistress: Well, you know. Things.

DevotedSlave: ‚Ä¶ 

DevotedSlave: Excuse me for asking the question, but I really have to.

DevotedSlave: Did the two of you ACTUALLY have sex with each other?

HaremMistress: uhm

HaremMistress: define sex

DevotedSlave: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

DevotedSlave: unbefuckinglievable

DevotedSlave: You know, I got some tidbits about your past and I‚Äôm getting serious suspicions that no one has ever gave you The Talk

DevotedSlave: Kurogiri‚Äôs nice guy, but I can‚Äôt picture him explaining how ‚Äòthings‚Äô work from a girl‚Äôs side

HaremMistress: weeeell

DevotedSlave: So I want you AND the BabyFactory in my room in 15 minutes. 

DevotedSlave: I‚Äôm going to explain ‚Äòthings‚Äô to you. 

HaremMistress: oh okay

BabyFactory: M‚Äôkay 

 

***

 

Izuku entered the living room in the morning, to see Tenko playing on a console (probably still, at least judging from the amount of empty energy drink cans surrounding him) and Mustard trying to inebriate himself. With soda. 

It wasn‚Äôt working well. 

‚ÄúDid you see Himiko?‚Äù He asked the gas user. Mustard shook his head. Izuku decided to give up. He had no idea where his girlfriend vanished and honestly, he wasn‚Äôt sure if he was so keen on hanging out with her. Not after yesterday. He needed time to cool himself down. 

She wasn‚Äôt in the room when he returned to it after spending three hours talking with Mirio and then playing some online game with him. God bless Gremlin for how untraceable she made the local internet connection. 

His father would have broken him out of the prison just to give him a stern talking about getting caught due to playing a videogame with the soon-to-be Symbol of Peace. Lots of people would die in the process. 

Himiko wasn‚Äôt there in the morning, either. 

‚ÄúWonderful.‚Äù Izuku sighs. ‚ÄúSo how‚Äôs your life going, Mustard?‚Äù 

‚ÄúAre you trying to make me into a temporary replacement for your missing girlfriend for entertainment purposes?‚Äù Mustard replies, obviously trying to be an ass about it. His parental issue makes him react with hostility to anything relationship-oriented. 

‚ÄúAre you asking for real or is that one of your conspiracy theories?‚Äù Mustard‚Äôs eyes cloud at the worlds implying that he doesn‚Äôt believe in his conspiracy theories. ‚ÄúOkay, okay, chill, stop looking at me like you want to murder me. Just kidding.‚Äù 

He pours some of the soda and drinks it alongside the breakfast (made by Kurogiri, the League‚Äôs collective guardian angel). He is halfway there when his brain catches up. 

‚ÄúWait, why are you here?‚Äù He asks and Mustard stares at him. ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you be at school?‚Äù 

‚ÄúFuck school, man.‚Äù Mustard replies confidently. His nickname on the chatroom didn‚Äôt come from nowhere. ‚ÄúI was a good boy for a while, so nobody will bat an eye on me not going once or twice now. Pros of having a notable hero as a parent, everyone treats you like your bones are made of glass. Besides, Kurogiri‚Äôs breakfasts are awesome. Way better than what I get at home.‚Äù 

Kurogiri nods with acknowledgement and satisfaction. Then he returns to eyeing the bar while waiting for someone to approach him and ask about something. He is like the most stereotypical bartender from some films or games. Always there to talk with you and offer you something to drink. 

‚ÄúMom‚Äôs not going to look for you?‚Äù Izuku asks and he sees Mustard‚Äôs face flinch in anger. But move, Izuku, very bad. 

‚ÄúFirst of all, Midnight‚Äôs not my mom.‚Äù Mustard replies with a badly hidden anger. ‚ÄúMy mom‚Äôs dead. Second of all, she is busy working. She is always busy working. Either as a teacher, or as a hero, or as some fucking poster girl of ‚Äòsex positivity‚Äô or whatever bullshit she talks about so often. She will certainly not notice me missing school one day, just as she didn‚Äôt notice that I stood in front of her in my villain outfit. She didn‚Äôt notice me even when she watched the recording of the attack and saw me use my quirk on the explodoboy. So can we talk about something else, please?‚Äù 

Izuku is willing to oblige. They spend twenty minutes talking about Mustard‚Äôs newest conspiracy theory (this time it‚Äôs about Kurogiri being Nedzu with some weird support item letting him warp around, using the League to learn how to interact with humans). Izuku starts to suspect that Mustard‚Äôs just mentally bored and so ends up twisting the reality in some particularly insane way to kill time and test his wits in the game of ‚Äòjustify it and find some Evidence‚Äô. 

Izuku thinks that he hoped deep enough that Midnight would recognize him just to finally have a reason to abandon his life fully. No longer bother with school. Just hang out with the League, the only place where he has friends who actually treat him right. It was, in Izuku‚Äôs opinion, contradictory. Mustard hoped to free himself from never being noticed by her by being noticed by her, just in the negative way. Then again, he isn‚Äôt one to judge. 

Perhaps Mustard just wants to see her face twist in realization. He is a bit of a sadist when it comes to things like that. 

‚ÄúIzuku.‚Äù Kurogiri takes advantage of silence to speak. ‚ÄúI know this might be unwise, considering Mustard being here, but I believe that we need to talk about my‚Ä¶ organization.‚Äù 

Mustard flinches as if he just smelled something rotten. Izuku gives him a disappointed stare. Then he turns towards Unclegiri. 

‚ÄúWhat do you want to talk about?‚Äù Izuku knows it‚Äôs going to be something interesting, Kurogiri wouldn‚Äôt interrupt him for something not interesting. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve talked with Giran and some similar acquaintances.‚Äù Kurogiri says from behind his bar. ‚ÄúThey appear to be‚Ä¶ intrigued. League has enough of a reputation for them to risk a long-term investment. They are working on figuring out where to host the Academy and how to get people in and out of it. We‚Äôre probably going to do a pilot class, of about twenty students, to see how things are going to work out. Giran got me a list of various thugs, thieves and other small-time villains to potentially recruit students from. And I believe that the first class would certainly gain a lot from having you look through the list and assess their quirks and general potential.‚Äù 

Izuku was sold the second he heard the words ‚Äòassess their quirks‚Äô. 

He spent two hours going through the files prepared by Giran, while also looking through the internet for some videos of events mentioned in the text. The list wasn‚Äôt created recently, if anything Izuku suspected that it was some form of Giran-owned database of interesting people. 

He didn‚Äôt know that the information broker ramped up his operations that much. Maybe the gossip of the information brokers out there having their own, well-funded organization (and merely being faces for it) were true? It really didn‚Äôt matter to the task at hand, but Izuku couldn‚Äôt help but salivate when thinking about the amount of knowledge that would have to be possessed by such a group. 

He ended up throwing out a lot of people. Some were too crazy. Others too unruly or clearly too dumb to learn anything useful. Some had other issues (like being quirkist assholes or potential police informants). In the end he narrowed the list to twenty people who seemed to have potential. In terms of quirks, but‚Ä¶ not always. 

It was a fun distraction. 

He was almost done with it when he saw Himiko enter the living room. She looked like she just tried fist-fighting Stain. Just without blood. Mostly exhaustion and messed up clothes. She resembled Mindscrew, but looked slightly better.

Izuku was about to call her when she saw him. She froze midstep, went beet red, then turned back and ran out of the base‚Äôs living room. 

What just happened?

‚ÄúSorry boss.‚Äù It was Blueberry. She looked only marginally better than Himiko. ‚ÄúHad a sleepover. With her and Gremlin. Stayed a bit too long.‚Äù She managed to reach the bar. Kurogiri somehow had a cup of coffee at the ready. ‚ÄúOh, just what I need, thank you.‚Äù It‚Äôs amusing to see how quickly she got used to being here.  

‚ÄúDo I want to ask why she reacted like that?‚Äù Izuku asks. The fact that all three apparent members of ha‚Ä¶ his fanclub took part in said sleepover is, to say the least, suspicious. 

‚ÄúI had to give her The Talk.‚Äù Blueberry replies with a slightly sleepy voice. ‚ÄúHer knowledge on what sex is was‚Ä¶ terrifyingly incomplete. I fixed that. No need to thank me.‚Äù She yawns loudly before continuing. ‚ÄúGive her a few days to figure out what to do with the new knowledge and she‚Äôll probably stop being incapacitated by her overactive imagination after seeing you.‚Äù 

Oh great, he thinks. Himiko now actually knows what sex is. So much about her thinking that cuddling under a quilt and watching films together is the peak of a relationship. So when the time comes she will want to take a step forward and then‚Ä¶ then he isn‚Äôt sure what to do about it. 

Why was his adopted family messed up so much? He loves them all, but sometimes he wishes there was someone who actually worked as he should. For a change. Unfortunately he can‚Äôt invite Mirio to hang out at the bar, at least not without kidnapping him. And kidnapping him regularly would just ruin his image as a soon-to-be Number One Hero. 

Worst of all, he still can‚Äôt find Overhaul. It‚Äôs as if that man vanished on them. Heroes were stupefied as well. Did he have another warp quirk at hand? Five thousand soldiers do not disappear without a trace in a single day. And something in the I-Island attack worries him more than he‚Äôd like to admit.

He isn‚Äôt used to the silence. He thinks that it‚Äôs preceding a storm.

Akatani Mikumo: I don‚Äôt like it. 

Mirio Togata: Being terminally bad in this game does that to people. 

Akatani Mikumo: Okay, so point one, it‚Äôs mostly about how silent things are recently in the country, I feel like everything‚Äôs going to explode tomorrow or the day after

Akatani Mikumo: and point two stop being so smug about being so good in video games you ass

Akatani Mikumo: Seriously, how, you didn‚Äôt strike me as a gamer

Mirio Togata: my best friend has enough social anxiety for at least twenty people, we‚Äôve been playing a lot of games together because he needs some interactions but can barely speak up when he sees people

Akatani Mikumo: oh I see, that‚Äôs kinda admirable

Mirio Togata: and since i started playing video games a lot, I decided to be the best in them I can

Akatani Mikumo: ‚Ä¶ Plus Ultra?

Mirio Togata: yes! 

Akatani Mikumo: Stop being this damn cool ghrrrr

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶

Mirio Togata: So, noumus? 

Akatani Mikumo: What?

Mirio Togata: Noumus. I want to know more.

Akatani Mikumo: why do you have to bring politics into this

Mirio Togata: it‚Äôs not politics but heroics and you know it

Mirio Togata: We‚Äôve been talking and playing games for like a week now

Mirio Togata: But I‚Äôm still trying to fish for information. 

Akatani Mikumo: hmmm

Akatani Mikumo: Some development on your side concerning them, hm? 

Mirio Togata: I can say yes or no, but by telling you something I want something in return

Akatani Mikumo: you realize that I can just, like, lie?

Mirio Togata: yes, but I also believe that this is unlikely.

Akatani Mikumo: hm

Akatani Mikumo: Fine, so let‚Äôs do a question for a question

Akatani Mikumo: What do you want to know? 

Mirio Togata: who is making them

Akatani Mikumo: Dunno his real name. I call him Doctor Evil. Quite a scientific genius, like Overhaul. Internet acquaintance of mine pretty much, I inherited him from someone and I‚Äôm currently trying to find out where he lives to punch him out or rat him to the heroes. He is a psycho. 

Mirio Togata: Hmm that would fit what we know, thank you.

Mirio Togata: your question?

Akatani Mikumo: did you ever get to see your predecessors? 

Mirio Togata: what?

Akatani Mikumo: ok so secondary question: are you in on the details of how Overhaul ‚Äòsurvived‚Äô

Mirio Togata: yes?

Akatani Mikumo: He is carrying a single added quirk, transferred with enough personality to overwrite Chrono completely. 

Akatani Mikumo: You are carrying a quirk that formerly belonged to anywhere between five and thirty heroes

Akatani Mikumo: I refuse to believe that there is nothing left of them

Akatani Mikumo: odd dreams, thoughts that aren‚Äôt yours, strange reactions to mental quirks, is your body reacting to the quirk differently than All Might‚Äôs, any hallucinations or smth? 

Mirio Togata: is this going to be a ‚Äòlet‚Äôs tilt your world upside down‚Äô talk

Akatani Mikumo: Vampire said that talking with me about quirks is dangerous. Something about me coming along and casually telling her that her quirk is actually a complex mutant one rather than a transformative one

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶

Mirio Togata: yeah, I can see how that can be shocking

Mirio Togata: as for an answer

Mirio Togata: I did start having odd dreams after Hosu, but I remember only snippets of those. I think I remember seeing Nana Shimura once or twice, but I thought that it‚Äôs just because I now knew her face (you showed me the pics while I was‚Ä¶ visiting the League)

Mirio Togata: no thoughts that aren‚Äôt mine

Mirio Togata: I was hit by a mental quirk during training two weeks ago, a form of mental invasion thing. The guy screamed and passed out, but doesn‚Äôt remember what happened, only some faint voices (but not what it said)

Mirio Togata: All Might had full power from the start, while I‚Äôm struggling with bone-breaking and only slowly raise the max power level I can reach

Mirio Togata: no hallucinations

Akatani Mikumo: this is incredibly, incredibly fascinating

Mirio Togata: you don‚Äôt say?

Akatani Mikumo: I now think that you‚Äôll be the last holder of this quirk (does it have any name?)

Mirio Togata: One for All. And why?

Akatani Mikumo: Cool name! And as for why‚Ä¶ I believe it finally matured. 

Mirio Togata: matured? 

Akatani Mikumo: If my theory is correct, past generations of its users were using it in its still developing form. It was stockpiling power in preparations of something, but was also letting its users tap into said power 

Akatani Mikumo: your body seems to find it hard to use One for All‚Äôs power properly unlike AM‚Äôs, because you are dealing with something vastly different than he did

Mirio Togata: It‚Äôs not that much different in mechanics though?

Akatani Mikumo: because you barely start to explore the new avenues

Akatani Mikumo: you started having some faint dreams about past users after you put your back into it and used maximum power available during our duel in Hosu, probably pushing One for All/your body adaptation to it through some threshold

Akatani Mikumo: Those dreams should grow clearer as your body and quirk adapt to each other better (I can‚Äôt with full certainty say that the long-term damage thing is still a think rn, because your quirk changed vastly and it seems to be changing you in the process)

Akatani Mikumo: also I don‚Äôt think those are dreams, those are past holders of the One for All trying to communicate with you

Akatani Mikumo: you should try to confirm it, there are mental trainings and drugs to make you remember dreams better clearer

Mirio Togata: So if you‚Äôre correct, I‚Äôm going to deal with anywhere between five and twenty-five voices in my head, yes? 

Akatani Mikumo: heroic voices, so no body hijacking and I think that they‚Äôll stop talking if you ask them, probably?

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶

Mirio Togata: Reassuring. 

Akatani Mikumo: you should also ask David Shield about regular testing of your quirk factor (I think something about it was in the Overhaul‚Äôs research data), and if my theory is correct, each time you use One for All in its fully matured state, it enhances and enlarges your quirk factor. In preparation. 

Mirio Togata: preparation for? 

Akatani Mikumo: We know that it has stockpiled strength of the past users. I‚Äôm almost certain that it also stockpiled their memories, perhaps personalities (call it a soul if you want to, because honesty it could as well be that). 

Akatani Mikumo: And I‚Äôm willing to bet a lot of money that it also stockpiled their quirks.

Mirio Togata: Oh 

Mirio Togata: OH

Akatani Mikumo: I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the dreams didn‚Äôt start because your quirk factor reached the size when it can safely fit first quirk out of many, but you still have some communications problem to fix and they don‚Äôt want to push a quirk onto you without explanation

Akatani Mikumo: you should check that immediately! 

Mirio Togata: Wait so you told me something about the noumus AND in exchange you told me a lot about my quirk? 

Mirio Togata: what? how‚Äôs that an exchange

Akatani Mikumo: but I like talking about quirks and yours is super cool

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶

Mirio Togata: You are making it really hard for me to try to put up the righteous heroic zeal thing when I‚Äôm thinking about you. 

Akatani Mikumo: awww.

Akatani Mikumo: what‚Äôs your opinion about friendship bracelets

Mirio Togata: don‚Äôt push it

Akatani Mikumo: :( 

Mirio Togata: I‚Äôm going to do‚Ä¶ some experiments

Akatani Mikumo: Tell me the results! [if it works, you can tell AM that I helped you and even about this convo, it might be hard to explain what happened otherwise sigh]

Mirio Togata takes some special pills from Recovery Girl (without asking what they are). Then makes some other preparations that were supposed to be helpful in remembering dreams/lucid dreaming that he found on the internet. 

He doesn‚Äôt exactly expect success. Words of Legion (who is a SUPERVILLAIN, stop looking forward to talking with him, Mirio!) are nice, but honestly, what are the chances of them being true? 

Then he opens his eyes within the ruins of a city. The sky over it is red, and the ground itself is twisted and broken in horrifying forms. He can see some massive damages in the nearest buildings that appear to be recent. 

‚ÄúIs that all?‚Äù He hears a thundering voice. The blood in his veins freezes cold. There is a figure floating in the air, one wearing a black suit and familiar white hair. ‚ÄúI expected something more from one of my brother‚Äôs descendants, Miss Shimura.‚Äù 

Mirio‚Äôs eyes drift to where All for One‚Äôs rest. He recognizes the bloodied figure standing amidst the broken concrete. She must have been thrown into the floor with enough strength for it to break around her, but she still managed to stand. It‚Äôs hard to say if she fought a battle or was tortured - the blood and wounds are everywhere. Her arms are broken. 

‚ÄúHe escaped.‚Äù Nana replies. Her voice is weak, held up only by willpower of steel. ‚ÄúI no longer carry the quirk. You‚Äôll kill me, but Yagi will stop you.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWords that I heard oh so many times before.‚Äù All for One laughs‚Ä¶ in a bloodcurdling way. ‚ÄúWell, watching you say goodbyes to your beloved student and totally-not-an-adopted-son was good entertainment, at least. One for All holders always make for a decent comic relief. There is a reason why I‚Äôm always letting them transfer the quirk before I end their existence.‚Äù His arms begin to shift as he calls upon his quirks. ‚ÄúNow perish.‚Äù 

Nana Shimura makes a last, pained smile. Then she is overtaken by an explosion of black electricity, after which darkness envelops everything around Mirio.

When it parts, Mirio is in a large room filled with chairs. They are numbered - the largest number he sees is twenty-seven, but it is empty. The others aren‚Äôt, but no matter how much he focuses on them, he can‚Äôt say what the people on them look like. It‚Äôs as if some perception-altering quirk hides them from him. 

The only exception is the number twenty-six. She recognized the woman, though she carries no wounds this time. And there is a heartwarming smile on her face rather than the expression of someone who knows they will die, but refuses to be broken before that. 

‚ÄúNot my proudest of days, you know.‚Äù Nana says while standing up from her seat and approaching Mirio. ‚ÄúI really thought that I could win. And I probably could. Some additional allies aside from Gran Torino and Yagi, some different plan... ‚Äú She shakes his head. ‚ÄúNo use being angry about it right now, am I right?‚Äù Her smile grows even wider. 

Mirio tries to answer but discovers that he can‚Äôt. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt try that, kid.‚Äù She says quickly. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôll be a time when we'll be able to talk with each other, but not now. We both rushed this meeting from our sides, so‚Ä¶ well, shortcuts, am I right?‚Äù She laughs, and Mirio decides that he missed out some internal joke. 

‚ÄúAs you already figured it out, Legion was correct about the One for All.‚Äù Nana continues. ‚ÄúTwenty-seven past users. Seventeen quirks. Inheriting the whole thing will take decades, but we decided to start as soon as possible. Japan seems to be a bit messy recently, so you have to be able to protect yourself properly. We didn‚Äôt spend two centuries on keeping the line alive for someone to extinguish it right before the destination, right?‚Äù 

He wouldn‚Äôt like it either. 

‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôll get my quirk when you wake up.‚Äù Nana says before giving him a slap in the back. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great! You‚Äôll love it. Yagi always said that it was awesome, and if your face wasn‚Äôt a copy of your dad‚Äôs I‚Äôd have suspected that you are his secret love child!‚Äù She freezes and looks back at the assembly of chairs behind her. ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM ON IT, ASSHOLE! I can finally talk with Yagi‚Äôs successor, give me that one damn moment, Lariat! Or I swear to everything swearable to that I‚Äôll punch you so hard that you‚Äôll die from starvation while still in the air!‚Äù She adds while waving a fist threateningly. 

She turns back to face him. He is only slightly intimidated. 

‚ÄúBut there are two things that you need to know.‚Äù She says to Lemillion. Her face, while still smiling, appears significantly more‚Ä¶ serious than earlier. ‚ÄúFirst is the fact that Legion is All for One‚Äôs son‚Ä¶ and has inherited his quirk.‚Äù 

Lemillion stares at her in horror. She smacks the top of  head with her first. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give me that look, kid! You ought to smile more.‚Äù She says with a smirk. ‚ÄúOne for All and All for One are two sides of the same coin. We can tell a lot about the other merely by coming into physical contact. He has only ten quirks, including the one he was born with. Eight weren‚Äôt stolen but willingly given to him. We only have flashes of memories associated with their former holders after the contact, but we‚Äôre almost certain that the Legion got them from terminally ill people in palliative care wards or hospitals in general. There was no resistance to the transfer process, and the people in question weren‚Äôt very emotionally invested with their quirks, so I don‚Äôt think that there are any minds to speak off attached to said quirks. The last quirk is an exception.‚Äù

Lemillion knows which quirk she talks about before she says it.

‚ÄúThe last one belonged to the monster that recently returned to the world of the living.‚Äù She says. Overhaul, Lemillion understands. ‚ÄúWe got to witness a lot of Overhaul‚Äôs memories when Legion used his quirks to shatter your bones. Once that happened, we voted 24:2 to let this one act of stealing a quirk slide. And the remaining two are still highly conflicted over it. Considering almost all of us died trying to stop All for On from stealing quirks, that should say a lot about Overhaul.‚Äù

It does. At last to Lemillion. 

‚ÄúNow, One for All is a ‚Äòheroic‚Äô quirk, at least in theory.‚Äù Nana continues. ‚ÄúI hate labels like that, way too many people with ‚Äòvillainous‚Äô quirks end up villains over that. But the point is, there were times when the word ‚Äòhero‚Äô meant something else or meant nothing at all. The Twenty-Seven were all heroes by heart, but some were called ‚Äòvigilantes‚Äô, ‚Äòvillains‚Äô, ‚Äòterrorists‚Äô and so on by the world. We have some mixed feelings about seeing someone with an All for One not being a maniacal and mass-murdering force of nature, but most of us are in a way looking forward to seeing what he does next. Yoichi especially is just giddy to watch his nephew. OH YOU KNOW I‚ÄôM RIGHT YOU REVERSE BROCON!‚Äù She shouts at the invisible crowd. 

‚ÄúLegion is a villain, yes.‚Äù She says while turning to Mirio again. ‚ÄúAnd he has to be stopped. But thus far, we‚Äôve seen nothing suggesting that he should be made an absolute priority, like his father used to be. Nothing suggesting that he should be killed rather than just arrested. But we are still worried about him having that quirk, so‚Ä¶ watch him and make sure he isn‚Äôt trying to walk in his father‚Äôs footsteps fully, alright? You should be way stronger than he is right now, so stopping him, if you can find him, shouldn‚Äôt be that hard.‚Äù

Lemillion agrees with that statement.  

‚ÄúThe second bit is a bit more personal. I need to deliver some messages from me.‚Äù Nana leans forward. ‚ÄúTell Gran Torino that I thank him for saving Yagi during that battle. For helping him finish school. For helping him fight when he returned from America. For helping you figure out how to use One for All properly. And that I‚Äôm sorry that I couldn‚Äôt be there with him.‚Äù Her smile is still there, but it is filled with sorrow. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get to meet Yagi personally sooner or later, so just tell him to better prepare some sensible explanation about that party in the US. I saw it all. From the first person perspective. And I have many questions, starting from ‚ÄòWhat the hell, Yagi?!‚Äô‚Äù 

There is a history behind those words, one that Lemillion is really interested in knowing. 

‚ÄúThe last message is to Legion.‚Äù Nana adds after a few seconds. ‚ÄúThough I suspect that Gran will end up having to know about it too. Tell him that I disagree with his little murderous crusade and I would have punched him in the face if I met him while being alive‚Ä¶ but I sincerely thank him for resurrecting Gran Torino in Hosu.‚Äù Lemillion isn‚Äôt sure if he heard that correctly. ‚ÄúNeither of you noticed that, but we know that Stain killed Gran. I know that Sorahiko wouldn‚Äôt have died in the first place if not for Legion attacking the city, but he still almost killed himself through quirk exhaustion to save a hero. One of his father‚Äôs greatest enemies, in fact. It‚Äôs probably what persuaded most of the Twenty-Seven to give the kid a chance.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd now that we're past the depressive stuff‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúNana puts her fingers at the edges of her mouth and pushes them up. ‚ÄúSMILE!‚Äù 

Then he wakes up. On the ceiling of his room. Explaining this is going to be a pain in the ass. 
Notes:

    Them: Midnight can't be Mustard's mother, she is too young!
    Me: FOOLS, YOU ARE UNDERESTIMATING MY POWER

    Also yes. All for One is two centuries (not something about a century old) in this fanfic, hence more One for All holders, although only Yoichi and the few most recent ones are truly active (the rest mostly goes zzzzz in the background now that All for One is dead). And yes, One for All is unique among the quirks in that it doesn't have Vestiges of its users inside, instead it actually 'stockpiles' its users.

    Smol changes. I regret nothing.

(See the end of the chapter for notes.)
Chapter Text

He ends up asking All Might, Gran Torino, Sir Nighteye and, after some thinking, Detective Tsukauchi for an ‚Äòemergency meeting‚Äô. The last one is there because‚Ä¶ well, Mirio is going to speak about some hard-to-believe things. So, having someone with a lie detecting quirk who is also in on the secrets is a good idea.

Lemillion thought about borrowing the cat cafe again, but Nedzu and/or the League probably have it under surveillance already. School was right out - he doesn‚Äôt want Nedzu to know, at least for now. In the end he settles for a meeting in Sir Nighteye‚Äôs agency. 

He refuses to mention what it is about until they find themselves in a mostly empty meeting room. They are all curious, obviously enough. They don‚Äôt take him for someone who would call them all like that without a reason. 

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù He starts, while facing his three mentors and a living lie detector. ‚ÄúI have a confession to make. For close to a week I‚Äôve been in‚Ä¶ contact with Legion.‚Äù Sir Nighteye is startled, but scarcely. All Might is much more expressive. Gran Torino stares with just a small hint of hostility. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bold confession to make.‚Äù Tsukauchi speaks for them all. ‚ÄúWhat sort of contact?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWe talk on the internet and play games together.‚Äù Lemillion replies. ‚ÄúIt started because, apparently, he has relationship problems and after thinking about it for a while he decided that I‚Äôm the only reasonably sane and normal person he knows to ask for help in that field.‚Äù

‚ÄúRe...Relationship problems?!‚Äù Sir Nighteye is rarely shocked to the point where it becomes this visible. Lemillion shares the idea of being appalled by the very concept of a supervillain asking All Might‚Äôs successor for love tips. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs complicated.‚Äù And it‚Äôs not Lemillion‚Äôs job to talk about how a certain supervillain has a problem with an overly ‚Äòfriendly‚Äô group of villains. ‚ÄúWe made a deal - I don‚Äôt mention our contacts unless he agrees to it, but if he makes a slip-up and tells me something useful in catching him then I‚Äôm free to do whatever I want with it. I‚Äôve been trying to milk him for information since then, but I finally got something useful today. Together with an agreement to come forward with the general issue.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù Sir says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to say that I agree with having contacts with villains, at least not without telling your superiors about them, but I understand the reasoning behind it.‚Äù Gran Torino and Detective nod. All Might is much more scarce in expressions and seems to be thinking about it deeply. 

‚ÄúIs it about the One for All?‚Äù All Might says finally, catching Lemillion off guard. ‚ÄúI see neither Eraserhead nor Nedzu among us, only the closest ones, and‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, yes, but not only that.‚Äù Mirio replies. ‚ÄúWe had another session of ‚Äòemergency quirk counseling‚Äô and results are‚Ä¶ groundbreaking, to say the least. But I also had a talk with him about the noumus, and he mentioned that he gets them from some internet acquaintance that he apparently ‚Äòinherited‚Äô. He refers to that person as ‚ÄòDoctor Evil‚Äô and is in the process of trying to find where they are so that he can kill them or rat them out to heroes, due to them being, and I quote, a ‚Äòpsycho‚Äô. This lines up with my theory from the chat, Unless the line was breached, it certainly wasn‚Äôt an attempt to get on my better side by falsely confirming my theory.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo some third party‚Ä¶‚Äù Sir Nighteye is certainly interested. ‚ÄúProbably inherited from All for One. Interesting. If what you say is correct, the noumu-maker is probably leaving and picking up noumus from some designated transit points, while Kurogiri transports them from it to the battlefield.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd that tells us‚Ä¶‚Äù Gran Torino asks. ‚Äú...what exactly?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat if we manage to find the League headquarters, we won‚Äôt have to worry about the noumus intervening in the bust.‚Äù Sir replies. ‚ÄúThey need to prepare them for every operation days ahead of it, so they can‚Äôt warp them anywhere on a moment‚Äôs notice.‚Äù Lemillion nods. He came to a similar idea. ‚ÄúAnything else about the League?‚Äù 

‚ÄúTidbits.‚Äù Lemillion replies. ‚ÄúHe went on a rant once about how he sometimes feels like he is running a kindergarten for mentally challenged psychopaths. He mentioned how Tenko aka Decay has apparently been wearing severed and preserved hands of his family members before Legion bribed him with videogames to go to a therapy.‚Äù They all flinch. Lemillion isn‚Äôt surprised. ‚ÄúHe also said something about the majority of the League having daddy or general parental issues alongside standard mental ones. Not sure if that‚Äôs in any way helpful, though.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMaybe yes, maybe no.‚Äù Tsukauchi comments. ‚ÄúSo, I assume that covers the League business. So‚Ä¶ One for All?‚Äù Lemillion nods. 

‚ÄúYes, but‚Ä¶ this is going to be pretty wild. I think we should all sit.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt want Gran or All Might to land on the ground due to their legs stopping to work right. He isn‚Äôt sure how they will react to Nana‚Äôs presence in his head. 

Meeting room in general is too large for five people. So they take five chairs and sit in a circle. It really feels like some sort of group therapy. Lemillion suspects that some of them might need group therapy after the talk. 

‚ÄúLegion asked me a few questions about my‚Ä¶ mental state.‚Äù Lemillion starts when everyone is seated. ‚ÄúI mentioned certain dreams I‚Äôve been getting since Hosu. I never remembered more than a scene or two without context, but I‚Äôm certain that I saw Nana Shimura in some of them.'' Something flinches on Gran and All Might‚Äôs faces, but it lasts for too short of a time for him to analyze. ‚ÄúAnd that incident during the training with the mental quirk user that got knocked out when he tried to use it on me. Plus the fact that unlike All Might, I can‚Äôt use it properly right from the start.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMirio!‚Äù Sir Nighteye is horrified. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be saying things like that to a vill‚Ä¶‚Äù All Might‚Äôs hand raises up. 

‚ÄúMirai, stop.‚Äù He says, and Sir obediently stops. Before his head turns towards The Symbol of Peace. ‚ÄúI understand your reasoning. But whether we want it or not, our knowledge of One for All is extremely limited. Legion seems to know much more than we do, and has probably known about most of these things beforehand. Confirming some minor things is a small price to pay to actually learn something that might be important.‚Äù All Might concludes, having no idea just how important the thing Mirio learned was. ‚ÄúMirio, please continue.‚Äù 

Gran is, somehow, still silent. He is probably still irritated at the events of Hosu. He is normally stable about it, but sometimes he does get rather frustrated at Legion‚Äôs slippery. And his very existence. 

‚ÄúLegion made an‚Ä¶ educated guess about One for All.‚Äù Lemillion says. ‚ÄúAnd figured out an experiment to confirm it. Which I did last night. I‚Äôm going to start saying a lot of crazy and almost unbelievable things from now on. I want you to know that I have confirmed all of them. And I have asked for Tsukauchi to be here, so that he can confirm that all I‚Äôm saying from now on is true.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNothing you said thus far, including the last few sentences, was a lie.‚Äù Tsukauchi confirms. Gran, Sir and All Might all have a rather complicated expression bordering between interest and worry. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stay silent during that talk, unless I detect a lie.‚Äù It was probably for the best. Tsukauchi was slightly more of an outsider in the subject, despite being in on everything. 

‚ÄúVery well.‚Äù He spent the last few hours figuring out how to explain things to them. He had more or less a plan. ‚ÄúTo begin with, it appears that I‚Äôm excluded from the ‚Äòdamage under strain‚Äô mechanic. One for All damaged past users due to being fundamentally immature and still growing into its ‚Äòtrue‚Äô form. I‚Äôm unable to use the full power augmentation potential of it unlike the prior users because the growth process of the quirk has concluded, meaning that what I have is something fundamentally different than what the previous Holders dealt with.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThis explains why Recovery Girl found nothing out of place in your body.‚Äù Sir is visibly relieved and overjoyed. ‚ÄúThis is wonderful, Mirio!‚Äù Lemillion agrees. His ~15 years of lifespan left has significantly expanded, at least unless a villain kills him first. 

‚ÄúWhat is this true form of One for All?‚Äù All Might is focused on it. He is a bit more invested in this quirk than the rest, by the virtue of still technically using what‚Äôs left of it. 

‚ÄúLegion speculates that‚Ä¶ One for All doesn‚Äôt only stockpile physical strength.‚Äù Lemillion replies. ‚ÄúIt stockpiles‚Ä¶ everything from its users. Memories and personalities‚Ä¶ or souls, his words not mine. And quirks.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt give them time to chew through it and ask, so he continues. ‚ÄúHe said that the dreams were probably the past Holders trying to communicate with me, and urged me to try some exercises and drugs that make it easier to remember or control your dreams. I did so tonight. Nana confirmed that everything Legion said was correct.‚Äù 

He doesn‚Äôt give them time to chew through that, too. He can see the shock on the faces of All Might and Gran Torino. Shock and disbelief. So he makes one last push - and activates Nana‚Äôs quirk. His control is lacking, but he does start floating towards the ceiling. 

‚ÄúTh...This quirk.‚Äù All Might manages to utter. Gran Torino just stares, looking like he was on the verge of a heart attack. Mirio can see tears in their eyes. 

‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs hers.‚Äù Lemillion replies and after some struggling manages to switch it off. He wasn‚Äôt far above the ground, so he managed to land relatively gracefully. ‚ÄúThere are also sixteen more in the One for All, but unlocking them all will take me decades of work, if Nana was correct.‚Äù He considers this assessment a challenge. 

‚ÄúTell us everything.‚Äù Mirai‚Äôs reaction is subdued, but his eyes are gleaming. ‚ÄúFrom the start.‚Äù 

Lemillion does so. He describes the initial dream, the one of the desolate and warped wasteland and of Nana‚Äôs last moments. All Might breaks into tears openly when he says how Nana‚Äôs last words were her telling All for One that her student would stop him. Gran doesn‚Äôt berate him for it - he is on the verge of crying himself. 

Then he moves over to the hall where the Twenty-Seven reside. Of the empty chair with the twenty seventh chair waiting for All Might, of how the twenty five of the remaining chairs were filled but by people that remained invisible to Mirio. And about Nana in the twenty sixth seat, rising from it to talk with Lemillion. 

Mirio narrates her words about twenty seven past holders that he will eventually be able to converse with, and seventeen quirks stored in the One for All that he will inherit. Starting from her own, that he was going to have on him when he wakes up. On how Nana joked about Lemillion being All Might‚Äôs secret love child, only to end up shouting threateningly at someone she called Lariat who apparently told her to hurry up (Mirai recognizes the hero name of the Black Whip Hero, one of the past holders they know of thanks to Legion). 

‚ÄúThen‚Ä¶ then things turned complicated.‚Äù Lemillion is finally going to fight the first of the many hurdles. ‚ÄúThe past Holders have some‚Ä¶ expertise on the field of quirks. When Legion touched me to break my legs in Hosu, they immediately found out that he‚Ä¶‚Äù Mirio takes a deep breath. ‚Äú...That he truly is All for One‚Äôs son. And has inherited his father‚Äôs quirk.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs as if the bomb exploded. The mood whiplash is intense. 

‚ÄúHe what?!‚Äù Gran Torino, still with tears welling in his eyes, shouts. Detective is horrified. Nighteye is unreadable. All Might is torn between emotions. 

‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt receive the full package from his quote unquote dad.‚Äù Lemillion quickly explains. ‚ÄúHe has only ten quirks, including All for One. Eight of them weren‚Äôt stolen or inherited but given to him. Nana says that from the Holders pieced up together, he received them from some people in hospitals, probably from patients in palliative care wards. The only one that was stolen used to belong to Overhaul.‚Äù Mirio sighs. ‚ÄúIt had enough of Overhaul‚Äôs memories attached that after reviewing them, the Holders voted 24:2 in favour of forgiving that one act of stealing quirks. And the remaining two were highly conflicted about it. So I‚Äôm really not sure if I‚Äôm in the position to be angry about it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThey‚Ä¶ forgave him?!‚Äù All Might seems appalled by the idea. 

‚ÄúApparently they have some, and I quote, ‚Äòmixed feelings‚Äô about seeing All for One user not being an unstoppable and deeply malicious force of nature.‚Äù Lemillion replies. ‚ÄúAlso if another of Nana‚Äôs random outbursts is any indication, someone named ‚ÄòYoichi‚Äô is ‚Äògiddy‚Äô to see what his nephew is doing. From the implied familial connection I can assume that said Yoichi is the First Holder. She called him a ‚ÄòReverse Brocon‚Äô.‚Äù He tries to not laugh. He fails. ‚ÄúShe also told me to watch Legion and act if I saw him follow in his father‚Äôs footsteps. From this alone I take the fact that they don‚Äôt seem particularly concerned with All for One Junior.‚Äù

Lemillion isn‚Äôt surprised. One for All and All for One aren‚Äôt, on their own, powerful. Their true strength lies in the ability to accumulate power over time. Hisashi Midoriya was so dangerous because of his two-century old collection of quirks - Izuku Midoriya isn‚Äôt even nearly as dangerous in direct combat. Lemillion was taken by surprise in Hosu, and for as long as he‚Äôll be cautious enough, there is just no way for him to lose in a 1vs1 fight with Legion.

He learned how to use air pressure for ranged attacks recently. This alone is probably enough to incapacitate Legion. And if not, then he just has to use permeation to make Legion unable to touch him to activate his quirk. Izuku Midoriya really isn't fighter material (although he WAS extremely dangerous to non-One for All Holders). 

Of course, Legion knows about it. He is willing to get his hands dirty, if needed. But he is a mastermind in heart, and is the most dangerous while making plans for others to execute. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt seem concerned?!‚Äù Gran Torino is furious. ‚ÄúThat kid is going to become a monster like his father. We have to stop him right now, no matter what. Toshinori, don‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôre buying that‚Ä¶‚Äù

It was time to intervene. Nana must have expected it to happen, and has armed him in proper counterarguments. 

‚ÄúNana also gave me three messages to deliver.‚Äù Lemillion interrupts the old hero. Thankfully he doesn‚Äôt get a kick in the shin for that. ‚ÄúOne to Gran Torino, one to All Might‚Ä¶ and one to Legion. Though she mentioned that I should probably mention the last one to Gran.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMessage?‚Äù All Might asks, dumbfounded. ‚ÄúTo Legion?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Lemillion replies. ‚ÄúShe told me to thank him‚Ä¶ for risking death by quirk exhaustion to resurrect Gran Torino in Hosu.‚Äù 

Gran Torino stares at him for a few long seconds before he manages to utter a winded ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù. 

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get a lot of context.‚Äù Mirio replies. ‚ÄúBut Overhaul‚Äôs quirk can resurrect a very recently deceased. And according to Nana, Stain killed you. But Legion brought you back, knocking himself out for several days and almost dying in the process.‚Äù He pauses for a second, letting the news sink in. ‚ÄúI think that Holders are giving him a chance because of that. Because sure, Stain wouldn‚Äôt have killed you if not for Legion, but he did risk his life to save a hero. And one of his father‚Äôs old enemies. Despite not having to.‚Äù 

Gran Torino looks at Tsukauchi in hopes of having him say that Lemillion just lied. He gets none of it. He slumps in the chair, shocked and conflicted. Mirio doesn‚Äôt even dare to try to figure out what‚Äôs happening in the old hero‚Äôs mind. 

‚ÄúAs for the message directly to you, she told me to thank you‚Ä¶ for everything.‚Äù Lemillion adds quietly. Gran Torino‚Äôs head perks up. ‚ÄúFor getting All Might to safety that day. For teaching him and helping him fight after he returned from the US. And for helping me. And also to apologize to you that she couldn‚Äôt be there with you.‚Äù 

This is too much. Gran Torino breaks into tears - something that Lemillion never even thought that could be possible. Tsukauchi and Sir Nighteye hold his hands, stopping him from falling off his chair. 

‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶ my message?‚Äù All Might asks. 

‚ÄúShe told you that you‚Äôre going to meet in person sooner or later.‚Äù Lemillion says, getting ready to mess up the solemn mood. ‚ÄúAnd that you have the time until then to find an explanation for some party in the US, because she saw it all and has a lot of questions to ask. Starting with ‚ÄòWhat the hell, Yagi?‚Äô‚Äù 

All Might goes pale.

Mirio Togata: Like you wouldn‚Äôt believe. I had a long talk with one of the previous holders and got their quirk. Not telling you which one. 

Akatani Mikumo: Nana Shimura/Float. I‚Äôm not dumb - it‚Äôs either reverse chronological order OR they decided whom should show up first, and be honest, she makes the most sense as a first Holder to pop up due to having ties with people alive right now. 

Mirio Togata: I don‚Äôt know why I even tried to conceal it

Akatani Mikumo: lol you did your best

Mirio Togata: They are all inside. And they felt quirks (quirkS) inside you when you broke my limbs in Hosu. 

Akatani Mikumo: oh

Mirio Togata: They know who your dad is AND that you have his quirk. 

Akatani Mikumo: oh crap

Mirio Togata: good news is that they know that all but one quirk you have aren‚Äôt stolen, and I think they voted about the stolen one and decided that Overhaul deserved it for being an ass

Akatani Mikumo: they did what

Akatani Mikumo: you have a crowd of dead heroes in your head and they have a democracy in there?! 

Akatani Mikumo: this is messed up

Mirio Togata: Actually, it kinda is, I just hope they aren‚Äôt watching when I‚Äôm with my girlfriend -_-‚Äô 

Mirio Togata: The good news is that they think that you aren‚Äôt a complete and irredeemable ass like your dad. Nana said to thank you for resurrecting Gran but also that she would still punch you in the face for being a villain and killing loads of people if she met you

Akatani Mikumo: I KNEW that getting her old poster was a good idea, she sounds so cool

Mirio Togata: also your uncle likes you

Akatani Mikumo: ‚Ä¶ oh

Akatani Mikumo: I was about to say something like ‚Äòfinally someone normal in the family‚Äô but then I remembered that he is a ghost living in your head/quirk and borderline a mythological entity at this point, like some half-forgotten demigod from a fable that has created a holy sword to slay the demon lord

Akatani Mikumo: ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is a stretch

Akatani Mikumo: well,.. tell him that I like him too? I mean, standing up to my father while being de facto quirkless was awesome, ngl. Suicidal, but awesome

Akatani Mikumo: on another note, when can I expect Nedzu and Hero Commission to team up to murder me

Mirio Togata: Not telling either of them

Akatani Mikumo: you what

Mirio Togata: listen

Mirio Togata: I have 26 dead heroes in my head

Mirio Togata: some of them were called vigilantes or even villains by their contemporaries (but all were heroes by heart, according to Nana, and I trust her word on it, she spend years getting to know them better)

Mirio Togata: they seem to lowkey like you, however confused that fact makes them

Mirio Togata: I was directly told to punch you in the face if you start acting like your dad

Mirio Togata: And I‚Äôm going to do my best to defeat and arrest you if we meet again, plus I‚Äôll do my best if I‚Äôm invited to help in an investigation leading to capture you, even if you don‚Äôt go super evil

Mirio Togata: but Japan is a mess right now, and as much as I detest your methods and look forward to seeing you incarcerated, you thus far exposed corruption among the heroes, slaughtered a bunch of villains (while saving the captured civilians that would be otherwise tortured and killed) and stopped Eclipse from destroying ENTIRE CITIES and wiping out UA (and then I-Island)

Mirio Togata: not to mention that we have any leads about what Overhaul is doing only because of you

Mirio Togata: So I classify you as ‚Äòtemporarily necessary evil‚Äô and I‚Äôm not going to help the Hero Commission and Overhaul by taking Nedzu off their back in order to get rid of you. As I want them gone more than I want you gone.

Mirio Togata: U N L E S S you start acting as your dad, because then I‚Äôm going to go after you like All Might went after you dad

Mirio Togata: did the message come through?

Akatani Mikumo: uhm

Akatani Mikumo: about the act as my dad thing

Akatani Mikumo: can I make a confession

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶ 

Mirio Togata: what did you do?

Akatani Mikumo: I might have pulled dad‚Äôs old trick of ‚Äòtransfer quirks from A to B to get influence‚Äô

Akatani Mikumo: which MIGHT have included an act of stealing a quirk

Akatani Mikumo: BUT the person whom I stole from was not only a genocidal maniac but also worked with Overhaul

Akatani Mikumo: does that count?

Mirio Togata: okay

Mirio Togata: 1. Eclipse ‚Üí Sunset?

Mirio Togata: 2. Why are you even telling me instead of hiding it

Akatani Mikumo: 1. Yes

Akatani Mikumo: 2. Because judging from what you just say you‚Äôre going to look for potential cases of me using my quirk, so this sooner or later gets found out, and then you‚Äôre going to decide that I‚Äôm a ‚Äòdemon lord‚Äô like my father.

Akatani Mikumo: It‚Äôs really not that well hidden.

Akatani Mikumo: So I prefer to mention it right now when you‚Äôre still likely to listen to my reasons for the act

Mirio Togata: I‚Äôll be frank

Mirio Togata: I‚Äôm disappointed in you

Mirio Togata: but I did watch Sunset‚Äôs manifest and did see the ‚Äòvillainy but restrained and with ethics‚Äô bit, honestly that alone would have probably make me suspect your involvement, especially with Mr. Compress hands in the manifest creation

Mirio Togata: i know you and Levellers are in contact (Gentle)

Mirio Togata: Whatever we do rn, there will be quirkless terror groups out there. Because the system failed the quirkless - and until we‚Äôve managed to fix that, the quirkless not being hostile the quirked will be an exception to the rule

Mirio Togata: QEM > QLF, even without Overhaul in the game. If I have to deal with a quirkless terror group, I prefer QEM, because it doesn‚Äôt seem to destroy cities and blow up pre-schools, at least for now

Mirio Togata: them fighting each other only makes streets safer for normal civilians

Akatani Mikumo: so‚Ä¶ you aren‚Äôt going to try to kill me over this?

Mirio Togata: I don‚Äôt know

Akatani Mikumo: what?

Mirio Togata: you don‚Äôt have to persuade me

Mirio Togata: you have to persuade 26 dead heroes in my head who have given you a benefit of doubt over you saving Gran Torino almost at the cost of your life

Mirio Togata: despite being a manifestation of holy fury against your father and his actions

Mirio Togata: when I get to meet one of them in my dreams and he tells me that you went too far and majority of them agrees to that, I‚Äôm going to dedicate myself wholly to ending your existence, and ignore everything else, like All Might once did with your father

Akatani Mikumo: fair

Akatani Mikumo: Vampire said something similar but it included knives and me acting like Overhaul

Akatani Mikumo: be my auxiliary conscience number 2

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôm all for it

Mirio Togata: Can I ask you a question?

Akatani Mikumo: Yeah. Can‚Äôt promise an answer though. 

Mirio Togata: What‚Äôs your goal?
Akatani Mikumo: Huh?

Mirio Togata: I‚Äôve read enough about Stain. He wouldn‚Äôt accept you if you didn‚Äôt have a clear goal. 

Akatani Mikumo: Uncle Stain accepts me because he has a soft spot for 13 year old quirkless kids who are ready to risk their life for someone else and face an SSS-Rank villain like Overhaul

Mirio Togata: He was involved?

Akatani Mikumo: someone had to save my soon-to-be sister from Overhaul‚Äôs lab while I was dealing with the big man himself

Akatani Mikumo: Stain was available, and so was my other uncle, Kurogiri

Mirio Togata: I see

Akatani Mikumo: but I do have an end-goal

Mirio Togata: Oh?

Akatani Mikumo: The same as yours, in fact.

Mirio Togata: Saving people? 

Akatani Mikumo: Saving people‚Ä¶ by inheriting the mantle of your predecessor. 

Akatani Mikumo: You want to become the Symbol of Peace like All Might.

Akatani Mikumo: I want to become the Symbol of Evil like All for One.

Mirio Togata: what

Mirio Togata: are you serious right now

Akatani Mikumo: not talking to you but to the 26 dead heroes in your head xD now let me explain

Akatani Mikumo: For two centuries this country struggled because my father ruled it from shadows

Akatani Mikumo: things began to turn hopeful when All Might emerged into the status of the Symbol of Peace, despite it being a wartime for those in the know

Akatani Mikumo: Then father lost his little war, leaving only the Symbol of Peace standing - and did the country become a better place to live?

Akatani Mikumo: no, because once again there was chaos on one side of the struggle. So everyone began to take advantage of it, and the chaos started to erode the Symbol of Peace giving birth to what the Hero Commission is right now

Akatani Mikumo: We need balance. Symbol of Peace and the Symbol of Evil. Struggling against each other. One a symbol of hope for the civilians and an inspiration for the heroes. Other the societal boogeyman that those wishing for change turn towards and an inspiration (while also a restraint) for the villains. 

Akatani Mikumo: QEM is a pilot attempt. Villain group - but with clearly set boundaries. With someone above it ready to intervene if it goes too far. Even when its very leader does. 

Akatani Mikumo: You said it yourself. Quirkless will turn to villainy (or, well, criminal acts, you can only be a villain if you use quirks because yeah discrimination, sigh) whatever I do. I can‚Äôt tell them to not hit back against their oppressors, but can make sure that they aren‚Äôt bombing pre-schools but actually go for more surgical strikes against people who actually did bad things to them and avoided responsibility

Akatani Mikumo: keeping them manageable and with at least some moral standing until someone (for example you, the Symbol of Peace, because we know how much authority that title gives you, even unofficially) does something to fix the crack in the system that I stop from growing too wide and manage what comes through it

Mirio Togata: so you want to become like your dad and fight me like your dad fought All Might‚Ä¶ but not actually win?
Akatani Mikumo: do you still remember me saying that the League is like a kindergarten for mentally challenged psychopaths?

Akatani Mikumo: why would I want to WIN against heroes? I enjoy small things like having electricity and water. And to ‚Äòwin‚Äô against heroes is to destroy society completely, so those things would all go away in this scenario. Can you imagine me trying to run a government with people like Gremlin? She‚Äôs my friend, but not a minister material.

Akatani Mikumo: Listen

Akatani Mikumo: Decay accidentally killed his family during his quirk‚Äôs first activation. He was a traumatized child that nobody even tried to help. He pillaged trash bins (a 5 years old kid) for months. Civilians thought that a hero would take care of him, and heroes didn‚Äôt care. Bystander Syndrome at its finest. Eventually villains picked him up. 

Akatani Mikumo: Vampire was beaten and otherwise abused at home for having a ‚Äòvillainous quirk‚Äô and ‚Äònot being normal‚Äô despite her quirk being a potentially wonderful thing for an underground hero. When she lashed out and accidentally stabbed her ‚Äòfather‚Äô dead while he was trying to tear off her fangs, a hero rolled in and took genuine pleasure in beating her to half-death (for ‚Äòresisting arrest‚Äô, despite her wanting to turn herself in), until Kurogiri rescued her. She was 10 years old when that happened

Akatani Mikumo: every other League member (save for me, Stain and Kurogiri) has similar backstories

Akatani Mikumo: I don‚Äôt create villains. I don‚Äôt need to. The system does. All I do is pick them up and try to steer them into the path where they make the world aware of what it did to them, to perhaps, make people consider ‚Äòchanging‚Äô some things to the better, while causing minimal possible number of victims

Akatani Mikumo: you know what Decay did to those cultists. Can you imagine what would have happened if he didn‚Äôt join me? If he remained as actively hateful towards the world as he was at the beginning? If he fired his quirk like that but on some crowded street in Tokyo during the rush hours? Instead of that he is helping me take down genuinely corrupted heroes and dangerous villain groups. 

Akatani Mikumo: So I‚Äôm going to become the second Symbol of Evil. Perhaps by the time I retire or get arrested, there will be no need for the third bearer of this title. And further down the line, many decades later, when peace will bring stagnancy and stagnancy will bring chaos, someone will pick up the mantle again (hopefully while being more me than my father)

Akatani Mikumo: The end of my answer.

Mirio Togata: One last question: why did you save me, Gran and Ingenium 2?

Akatani Mikumo: For the same reason why I would save All Might, Eraserhead, or Sir Nighteye.

Akatani Mikumo: Because I believe that if much younger Decay was searching for food in your trash bin, you‚Äôd save him. Because I believe that if you saw some ‚Äòhero‚Äô beating a defenseless Vampire, you‚Äôd stop him. 

Akatani Mikumo: I can‚Äôt destroy the system entirely (although I considered it before I saw that UA is still worth something and that the Symbol of Peace has a successor, because everything was better than what the HPSC was doing). And I can‚Äôt reform it from the outside. But I can cast the light through the cracks in the walls and hope for those inside to fix it - and to that end, I need to preserve those who know how to repair buildings. 

Mirio Togata: you gave me (+26, though I can‚Äôt hear what they talk about rn) a lot to unpack

Akatani Mikumo: I know

Akatani Mikumo: tell me when they come to a decision

Akatani Mikumo: in the meantime, check this out

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶ 

Akatani Mikumo: My sister likes you :D so she drew you

Akatani Mikumo: I told her you are super cool hero like All Might so she calls you Mini-Might

Akatani Mikumo: I think it‚Äôs your face, you are easy to draw and she thinks your face is a bit funny but isn‚Äôt saying why

Mirio Togata: I would have very mixed feelings if you didn‚Äôt mention Stain saving her (because we‚Äôre together in one picture, holding your sister‚Äôs hands). Now I only have mixed feelings.

Akatani Mikumo: xD 
Notes:

    Well, All Might's party in the US and Nana being pissed off at him for it is a bit of a running gag throughout the entire series. I'm never saying what it was, leaving that for readers' headcanon. Just like whatever Mei's planned present for Izuku was.

    Also this chapter is both Izuku Midoriya finding a refuge in audacity (knowing full well that he can't hide himself using All for One-the-quirk for long, nor his attempts to rebuild his father's legacy from Mirio Togata, so the only way of delaying the inevitable for reasonable amount of time is either significantly confusing or persuading Lemillion that Izuku is doing all of that in good will) and slightly losing his calm.

    He idolizes All Might, but unlike the canon, he never gets into any significant contact with All Might (save for brief incidents like the USJ). Instead, Lemillion kind of takes the cake of being... well, not a father figure, the age difference is too small, but certainly an idol to a degree. So he deep inside wants to impress him/make him like him, however childish it might be considering the whole 'archvillain in training' status.

    Then again, it's the same kid that in canon 'hides One for All' despite yelling its name in most of his techniques because he finally has a goddamn quirk and this is something that he finds hard to keep in. Yeah.

    Of course, his attempt to bamboozle Lemillion by telling him the truth is going to be rendered a bit redundant by another plottwist in the story that's coming in two chapters ahead of this one. Anyone has any guesses as for what that's going to be? :P

Chapter 27: Intervention
Summary:

    League realizes that the mystery is out. Another mass murder. Lemillion develops questions (but has supportive figures of authority to help him).

Chapter Text

UA-Spy: Am I the only one who has bad feelings about it?

SmallMight: bad feelings about what?

Blueberry: ? 

UA-Spy: everything

SmallMight: UA-Spy Protection Squad is a go

UA-Spy: lol

VampirePrincess: *virtual hug*

Blueberry: *virtual hug*

HandyMan: I don‚Äôt do hugs 

HandyMan: but tell me whom to kill to make you feel better

SmallMight: Awww

UA-Spy: Awww

VampirePrincess: Awww

Blueberry: Ara ara.

UA-Spy: no, honestly, it might be the lack of activity and Overhaul being invisible

UA-Spy: but, I feel like something‚Äôs deeply wrong

UA-Spy: I don‚Äôt hear even nearly as much things from Nedzu

UA-Spy: and I feel like even the underworld itself went kinda silent?

UA-Spy: I don‚Äôt like it

UA-Spy: I feel like a horror protag staring down a dark corridor at night and wondering if something didn‚Äôt just move down there

SmallMIght: I have to confess - I have similar thoughts

SmallMight: Overhaul vanished

SmallMight: No one heard about him for like two weeks now?

SmallMight: I get it that he is holed up somewhere and working on his Science of Evil‚Ñ¢

SmallMight: but HOW did he vanish so well and why nobody saw his soldiers since then

SmallMight: I‚Äôm 99% certain he either copied Eclipse‚Äô quirk when nobody was looking or has another warper

SmallMight: this is messed up

Blueberry: Wouldn‚Äôt he come forward with said quirk to claim himself as Eclipse‚Äôs successor? 

SmallMight: I don‚Äôt know, Overhaul is messed up in the head but really damn smart, there is a plan in all of that

SmallMight: But I can‚Äôt decipher it and this is terrifying since he has like 50x more resources than when he was the head of the Shie Hasseikai

UA-Spy: that‚Äôs super reassuring

SmallMight: did you prefer me to lie to you?

UA-Spy: fair

UA-Spy: Nedzu might be onto me, now that I think about it

SmallMight: What?

UA-Spy: I don‚Äôt like how everyone suddenly stopped having Serious Talks‚Ñ¢ in his office

UA-Spy: they might know about my surveillance

UA-Spy: If so, they are probably doing background checks on everyone in the vicinity

SmallMight: crap, when did that start?

UA-Spy: soon after Overhaul talk

SmallMight: Did I slip too much

SmallMight: shit

UA-Spy: yeah

SmallMight: you want a lift out rn?

UA-Spy: I‚Äôll tell you when I see a hero tailing me or smth, for now I can still be wrong

VampirePrincess: I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing you with us! 

HandyMan: same

UA-Spy: heh

UA-Spy: if they are truly onto me, they might go for an arrest during the training camp

UA-Spy: in two weeks, isolated in the countryside, surrounded by heroes

SmallMight: makes sense, I‚Äôll locate the place and get ready for an assault if we lose contact with you

UA-Spy: thx

UA-Spy: friends willing to assault a fortress in the middle of the woods filled with heroes and hero trainees for you are the best friends

SmallMight: Hell yeah!

SmallMight: what do you know about the training camp btw.?

UA-Spy: that it‚Äôll be big, bigger than in prior years

UA-Spy: Cementoss and Power Loader are there, helping in construction of something. Together with literally every single support class from every single year. 

UA-Spy: Plus Nedzu decided to include more people. Might be most of the hero classes, plus a lot of heroes for security. 

SmallMight: oh joy, security amped up

UA-Spy: yeah I wonder who inspired that

SmallMight: that‚Äôs certainly not me, you reverse sunshine

 

***

Akatani Mikumo: Anything on Overhaul?

Sawa Takeo: He is out of the Vigilante Alliance‚Äô weight class, if we found anything about him, we‚Äôd tell Eraserhead or some other pro hero about it

Akatani Mikumo: this is fair

Akatani Mikumo: what can you tell me about Inhuman Supremacy Party‚Äôs operations in Shizuoka prefecture

Sawa Takeo: ‚Ä¶ what brought that in? 

Akatani Mikumo: I am a bit of an information broker, not sure if you noticed

Akatani Mikumo: I might or might not have certain Legion in my extensive list of underworld contracts and he is looking forward to finding something to wreck, so I think that making him go after villains is a relatively good idea

Sawa Takeo: ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm starting to understand why you looked for Stain. 

Akatani Mikumo: not my proudest job, and I really thought that they would murder each other

Akatani Mikumo: turned out that Legion is Stain‚Äôs adopted (and temporarily estranged) nephew

Akatani Mikumo: who was looking to reconnect with his uncle

Akatani Mikumo: would you expect THAT development? be honest with me

Sawa Takeo: ok wow

Sawa Takeo: you have a point

Sawa Takeo: this had to come out of the blue

Sawa Takeo: Alliance has a lead on what appears to be an ISP‚Äô base in Shizuoka, but nothing substantial

Akatani Mikumo: good enough, I have other sources, I‚Äôm just trying to narrow down the location

Akatani Mikumo: I have three potential places, and I need to cross out two

Sawa Takeo: money or info?

Akatani Mikumo: nothing interesting in my information list, at least nothing that Eraserhead doesn‚Äôt know and that might have interested the Alliance

Sawa Takeo: so money it is

Akatani Mikumo: Standard payment?

Sawa Takeo: yep

 

***

Izuku read through the file sent to him by the Alliance. He was halfway in when he started laughing. 

‚ÄúBusted, assholes.‚Äù He is running under a bit of a sleep deficit due to being very involved in his current investigation. As a result, he gets ‚Äòmaniacal cackling‚Äô instead of ‚Äòsatisfied laughter‚Äô. He decides to go to sleep - he has to plan another mass murder, and this is something to do while relatively sane. 

Himiko is still missing out on their nightly cuddling sessions. Since she was the person to force him to go to sleep on reasonable hours, his current state is probably at least partially her fault. Certainly not his. He is sure about that. 

 

***

ISP was using a large tea plantation as a cover. The building had a surprisingly expansive underground section serving as barracks, and it was right next to a large forested area used by the local ISP cell as a training area. Mostly at night - there was no one around the plantation to notice an awkward number of complex mutant quirk users emerging from it right after the sunset. 

The police were yet to find an explanation for some missing campers and hunters in the area. Sure, only four during the last two years. But the forest was still slowly developing a reputation. And not a good one. 

He had Spinner observe the camp for three days. He found about seventy members of the ISP in the area, including five B or C-Ranks (rest was D or E). 

Izuku chuckled menacingly when he found out. It was time to practise operations in forested areas. And he had just a perfect idea in mind for it. 

 

***

TruthDetector: Five hours ago the League attacked the Inhuman Supremacy Party base in this prefecture.

Mr. Principal: Oh dear.

DeadpanStalker: Let me guess - ISP was massacred?

TruthDetector: To put it mildly, yes.

Tintin: ‚Ä¶

Tintin: At least Legion is consistent. 

SuperPunch: One way to describe it.

Mr. Principal: What happened, Tsukauchi? 

TruthDetector: We thus far counted seventy-two corpses, but we suspect that there might be more scattered through the woods. We caught three survivors that the League missed, but no one important (just thugs, frankly traumatized and terrified by what happened, and thus highly cooperative). We also have some camera footage from the plantation that ISP used as a cover.

TruthDetector: Decay isn‚Äôt the only one member of the League with way more dangerous quirks than we previously anticipated. Majority of the ISP casualties came from Mustard covering about ten square miles of forest with his poison gas, while party-ists were in the middle of training in it. 

Mr. Principal: Oh dear. 

TruthDetector: One of the survivors said that it was like a mini-cyclone made of poison mist. With Mustard in the middle (she is flight-capable mutant, she managed to fly above the poison cloud and tried to engage him, but was shot by Mindscrew and only barely managed to get out of the poison range before falling to the ground). 

TruthDetector: It is possible that said cyclone was capable of moving, for as long as Mustard was.

DeadpanStalker: So, an A-Rank. And that‚Äôs putting it lightly. S-Rank material with some development, no doubt. 

TruthDetector: Certainly. Good news is that the poison density seems to have decreased with range, resulting in said three survivors that were on the verge of the cyclone. I‚Äôm also willing to risk a bet that even in the middle of it, it wasn‚Äôt as concentrated as when he is attacking people directly. So it takes time to incapacitate and even more to kill. 

SuperPunch: Good news, but not great news. Mustard‚Äôs potential for large-scale battles is clearly immense. He can saturate the entire battlefield in poison without having to expose himself to danger. And everyone willing to confront him will have to navigate towards the densest part of the poison fog, getting more and more weakened the closer they get. 

SuperPunch: He is extremely dangerous when paired with Mindscrew, who can simply order his opponents to take off their masks or stand there for a few seconds and inhale deeply (and since the visibility is awful, he can borrow the voices of their teammates to force them to respond if there is more than one attacker). 

Mr. Principal: I agree with this assessment entirely. 

TruthDetector: The events on the plantation were equally awful and warrant another villain rank change. 

CatsCoffeeNap: what now?

TruthDetector: The attack on the plantation began with Dabi setting the buildings on fire from a distance. When the members of the ISP emerged from them to confront the attackers‚Ä¶ well, I think I‚Äôll just upload the video. 

Mr. Principal: There is a streaming feature in our communicators, use it. 

TruthDetector: Sure. 

 

The video starts. They can see some burning buildings, with smoke concealing a lot. The people with complex, mostly animalistic, mutant quirks emerge from the buildings. 

They recognize the two figures standing on the open field before the plantation, despite them being far away from the camera. 

 

CatsCoffeeNap: Dabi

Mr. Principal: + Zealot.

 

‚ÄúWho are you!‚Äù Someone from the mutant crowds shouts. ‚ÄúDo you have the tiniest idea who you just att‚Ä¶‚Äù 

Dabi is far away from the camera, but it has good audio AND he is using a megaphone. They can hear the words quite clearly. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Dabi, the vice-commander of the Vanguard Action Squad of the League of Villains.‚Äù The villain announces, with a notable glee in his voice. ‚ÄúAnd yes. I know who you are. Bunch of assholes we‚Äôve come to kill.‚Äù 

The detective pauses the recording. 

 

TruthDetector: Opinions on that?

Tintin: Well, he isn‚Äôt wrong with that last sentence.

DeadpanStalker: Mirio?

Tintin: I mean, they were assholes, and they did come to kill them all, so as I said, no lies there.

DeadpanStalker: Don‚Äôt scare me like that.

CatsCoffeeNap: So, Legion learned to delegate. Great. 

TruthDetector: Delegate?

Mr. Principal: Vanguard Action Squad is a new development. I believe that Aizawa suggests that Legion himself acted like a strategist and main planner of this operation, while letting someone else execute the attack itself. Probably whoever the leader of the VAS is. 

SuperPunch: Most likely Mindscrew is the leader. He is relatively levelheaded, and has a mental quirk (we all know that mental quirks are often paired with increased situational awareness and intelligence level). 

DeadpanStalker: My thoughts exactly. 

Mr. Principal: I‚Äôm more worried about the word ‚ÄòVanguard‚Äô. It implies preceding some main force. We don‚Äôt see it here, but‚Ä¶

TruthDetector: Not the real worrying thing. Continue watching. 

 

What follows is a massacre. 

Dabi doesn‚Äôt even participate. Just laughs in the background.

Zealot bursts forward, his body expanding in size, his robe proving to be a support item with an incredible elasticity as it doesn‚Äôt just break under the strain. 

The camera can barely catch Zealot's movement speed. He crosses fifty meters distance in a second, his fist meeting the face of one of the bigger mutants. He practically rams said head into the wall of the building behind the man, shattering the majority of the building and splattering the head over what‚Äôs left of it. 

Two more mutants die almost instantly, one to an elbow hit that practically decapitates the ISP warrior, and the other one to a follow up punch. 

The rest has just enough time to start screaming. The last one dies when Zealot breaks his back on his knee - with enough strength to practically sever the man in half, showering everything with gore. 

The massacre concluded, Zealot shrinks back to his normal size and walks back towards Dabi. Who stops laughing maniacally into his megaphone.

 

Mr. Principal: Oh dear. 

Tintin: ‚Ä¶ All Might, you didn‚Äôt have any secret children somewhen in the past?

SuperPunch: I most certainly did not. 

TruthDetector: This is far beneath All Might‚Äôs level of strength enhancement. But in theory it is a similar quirk - massive enhancement of strength, speed and resilience, just with greater transformation components. 

TruthDetector: Zealot was punched once in the film, by that gorilla mutant - we have data on him and trust me, his strength counted as superhuman. Zealot didn‚Äôt even notice it and then tore off the head in retaliation with a single hand. 

CatsCoffeeNap: I just imagined having to deal with All Might if he was a villain. 

CatsCoffeeNap: My day is ruined.

CatsCoffeeNap: Thank you.

SuperPunch: ‚Ä¶ mine is ruined a bit, too. That really was like seeing myself murdering people. 

SuperPunch: I hate the very idea. 

DeadpanStalker: So, another A-Ranker in the League (because let‚Äôs be honest, seeing that WILL make the Commission up him). 

Mr. Principal: No doubts about it. 

CatsCoffeeNap: Any ideas how his quirk works?
TruthDetector: No. But I‚Äôm certain that this still isn‚Äôt his full strength. 

CatsCoffeeNap: oh great, another nightmare

Mr. Principal: Explain?

TruthDetector: I‚Äôm 99% certain that he was the one to kill Purge. But the punch that he used to do it has practically pulverized that man, the wall behind him, the office behind the wall and then the outside wall of the building. Almost collapsing it in the process.

TruthDetector: It was a significant fraction of All Might‚Äôs full strength. 40-50%? 

TruthDetector: but he didn‚Äôt use it here, that‚Äôs 15-25% just without holding back against human targets

DeadpanStalker: there is a villain out there who isn‚Äôt All for One or Re-Destro and can reach this degree of physical strength?! 

TruthDetector: I can only suggest not engaging him without appropriate quirk combination and/or Symbol of Peace. But to have an appropriate quirk combination, we need to figure out his quirk.

Mr. Principal: I‚Ä¶ might have a theory. 

Tintin: I‚Äôm scared and in need of a hug. 

CatsCoffeeNap: Same. 

Mr. Principal: He lost an arm (before getting it back, somehow) in the battle against Eclipse. I run genetic tests on it, and the results indicate a very close familiar connection with‚Ä¶ Purity. Judging from the age, he is most likely her son.

TruthDetector: Purity as in the Creature Rejection Clan leader? 

Mr. Principal: One and only. 

TruthDetector: Didn‚Äôt he kill Purge, Purity second-in-command? 

Tintin: Oh great, another League member with acute parental issues. 

TruthDetector: Yeah, sounds like it.

Mr. Principal: I happen to have a ‚Ä¶ contact with someone within the CRC. No one high, but he does share some gossip from within the organization. Several years ago I heard unproven mention that Purity had a son, who apparently vanished. But no actual details (she kept her family hidden from the organization at large).

Mr. Principal: I suspect that Purge was as surprised with seeing him as we are with his parentage. 

CatsCoffeeNap: What does that tell us about his quirk?

Mr. Principal: Purity‚Äôs quirk is strength (and quirk power) enhancement to people in the vicinity who she ‚Äòidentifies with‚Äô, so in her case it‚Äôs typically the non-mutant quirkeds, especially those from the CRC. Her quirk is further boosted when they are wearing concealing robes, because without seeing their faces she can ‚Äòimagine‚Äô that they resemble her more. 

Mr. Principal: My theory is that Zealot has a variation on that quirk - self-boost on the basis of some form of abstract perception of himself and/or his opponents.

Mr. Principal: He appears to have escaped from the CRC, and has managed to generate a much larger power level when engaging Purge, when compared to the one he displayed when engaging ISP. 

Mr. Principal: It might be hatred, or it might be something slightly more constructive (for example righteousness? so he felt that Purge is more evil and more worthy of killing than ISP members, due to him being a more ‚Äòpersonal‚Äô brand of evil, and thus reaching a higher power level?) 

SuperPunch: If he had a quirk empowering him when he feels that he is good and the enemy is evil, how didn‚Äôt he end up as a hero? This is like a dream quirk for a hero. Especially when it gives him this degree of a power-boost. This is literally a Top Five Hero material with proper training (if not a guaranteed Number Two Hero position if he puts his back into it) 

Mr. Principal: He is a son of a supervillain, probably with no documents (villains don‚Äôt need those) and on the run from Purity (if our theories on their relationships are correct). I would take him in, no questions asked, if only to spite his mother, but he might have not seen this as possible and never tried to join UA.

Mr. Principal: He joined the League through Stain, and most of his former party appear to be formed from more‚Ä¶ extremist vigilantes who developed issues with a lot of heroes on top of those towards villains. 

Tintin: Another person that fell through the cracks into villainy. Tsk. 

DeadpanStalker: Mirio, he is a villain. 

Tintin: A villain that could be a hero if society gave them a chance. I sometimes feel like the League has this as a running theme for its members. 

DeadpanStalker: Mirio, we all know that. But he is still killing people. And has to be stopped, regardless of how much we relate to his motives. 

Tintin: Excuse me for feeling bad about having to arrest or kill (if they resist too much) people my age who should have been helped by the very society that I‚Äôm supposed to uphold. 

Tintin: But weren‚Äôt because they were born with the wrong quirk (or no quirk at all). 

Tintin: Had some slightly enlightening talk recently, and, well

Tintin: My quirk was originally extremely weak, and I heard many people discourage me from going to heroics. I managed to persevere, but what about those who didn‚Äôt? Gentle Criminal tried to become a hero for several years, but no one wanted to give him a chance and now he is a villain. 

Tintin: He defeated many heroes, so it‚Äôs not like he was too weak. He might steal from the wealthy, but we all know that Levellers focus on those wealthy who have done nasty things. So it‚Äôs not like he had no moral compass. So why he isn't a hero but a villain?

Tintin: And that's not all. 

Tintin: It‚Äôs something I heard about while a ‚Äòguest‚Äô in the League. I didn‚Äôt think that it was important, but I think it‚Äôs time to mention it.

Tintin: Vampire became a villain because due to her quirk requiring her to drink human blood, it was seen as ‚Äòvillainous‚Äô. So not only was she abused at home (despite, let‚Äôs be honest, Legion being 100% correct when he said that ability to shapeshift like that is a dream quirk for an underground hero) but ended up killing her father accidentally in self-defense when he was trying to forcefully tear off her fangs. That she apparently needs to not suffer from crippling anemia. 

Tintin: And when she wanted to turn herself in, a ‚Äòhero‚Äô ended up almost beating her to death for fun, until some villain (!) intervened out of pity. She was 10 years old when that happened.

Tintin: How am I supposed to feel when I‚Äôll face her in a fight? Maybe if I was born quirkless or with a ‚Äòvillainous‚Äô quirk, I‚Äôd persevere and become a hero. But maybe I wouldn‚Äôt, and I would end up like her. 

Tintin: It‚Äôs a bit of a haunting perspective. And I‚Äôm not sure what to think about it. It‚Äôs not covered in the school curriculum, that‚Äôs for sure.

CatsCoffeeNap: Consider an internship with some underground heroes before graduating. 

CatsCoffeeNap: We deal with issues like that on a semi-constant basis. I get to know many different villains in my line of work. 

CatsCoffeeNap: Also tell me if you ever find out the name of the hero who did that to Vampire. Just for‚Ä¶ reference. 

DeadpanStalker: I agree with Eraserhead. Sure, you are going to become a surface hero, but a different perspective is never a bad idea. You‚Äôll often work on the basis of evidence gathered by an underground hero, and understanding how they work will be beneficial to you.

DeadpanStalker: And do not feel bad about not knowing what to think about it. Hero schools are supposed to foster idealism - because that‚Äôs the core of heroics. 

DeadpanStalker: Understanding the villain‚Äôs motives and reasoning is something we typically leave for already molded heroes. There is always a risk of understanding a villain‚Äôs motives a bit too much.

DeadpanStalker: You asking such questions just means that you began to mature as a hero earlier than most.

Tintin: Well‚Ä¶ thank you. It‚Äôs not exactly the reaction I expected but it means a lot to me.

Tintin: I think I‚Äôll consider working with underground heroes for a while, as you said. 

DeadpanStalker: I‚Äôm always there for you if you want to talk.

SuperPunch: Same. 

Mr. Principal: I‚Äôd like to add that I agree with you, Mirio. There are many villains who are truly and unquestionably evil (think of people like All for One, or Muscular and Moonfish, the recent escapees). But many are victims of circumstances, or just victims. We still need to stop them from committing crimes, but‚Ä¶ there are underlying issues to address. 

Mr. Principal: The current crisis is because the HPSC focused on heroes, as a go-to means of dealing with issues, and completely forgo working on the issues that cause villains to be born in the first place. 

Mr. Principal: Then again, I didn‚Äôt do a lot either. Which is what I‚Äôm going to change. 

Mr. Principal: This is a reason why I plan to organize the rehab hero class. Too many people end up as villains because they were born in the wrong family, because they were told that their quirk is villainous once or twice too many and so on. I also think that going to the hero course with people like that should give other students some perspective concerning what Mirio mentioned about how not all people called villains are pure evil. And not knowing how to react to that. 

Mr. Principal: Unfortunately, UA is only a single school. And I have a long list of issues with many other schools. HPSC is only making things worse with their policies. Hopefully some schools will follow our example, we know that UA is a bit of the image of an ‚Äòideal‚Äô hero school. 

SuperPunch: Get one of ‚Äòyour‚Äô TV stations to ask me on live television about villainous quirks. Telling Japan that the Symbol of Peace thinks that there is no such a thing as villainous quirks is probably a step in a good direction. 

Mr. Principal: Finally taking a step in? 

SuperPunch: I read some articles, and checked some statistics recently. And I agree with Mirio. I don‚Äôt like how certain things grew out of proportion in the chaos of the last few years. It requires some correction.

SuperPunch: I made non-intervention in societal matters a policy, because the last thing I want is a One for All Holder (and a Number One Hero) going on a power trip, and All for One has proven to us how addictive ‚Äòchanging the society‚Äô is. But now I know that I‚Äôm going to turn quirkless soon, so that threat is negated. And I refuse to stand idle for even a minute longer if there is no one else to do a thing, and the HPSC is only making things worse. 

Mr. Principal: And what caused that? Not like I‚Äôm going to complain about it, since I think that‚Äôs a very good thing to do. Just asking. 

SuperPunch: Partially it‚Äôs the League and hearing about people like Zealot. Partially it‚Äôs some words I heard recently from an old teacher of mine. But it‚Äôs private, so I‚Äôm not going to elaborate. 

Mr. Principal: I see. Well, I‚Äôm looking forward to hearing from you! 

Mr. Principal: Unfortunately, it will take years to get anywhere. We really got kinda lazy after we got rid of the All for One, didn't we? 

TruthDetector: I hate to admit, but you are right. 

TruthDetector: The Re-Destro‚Äôs failed coup should have been a waking call, but‚Ä¶

SuperPunch: We and the Commission equally felt like it‚Äôs just a bump on the road to recovery from All for One. 

SuperPunch: And now we got Overhaul, Legion and I sometimes feel like we‚Äôre getting two new villains per one we eliminate. And don‚Äôt have me started on how Eclipse almost destroyed UA and I-Island, something that even All for One wouldn‚Äôt try. 

RoadRunner: ‚ÄúWon the war, lost the peace‚Äù, I think it went like that. 

 

***

Mirio Togata: I think your plan is working.

Akatani Mikumo: ???

Mirio Togata: Not telling you. That‚Äôs classified info. 

Akatani Mikumo: You can‚Äôt do that to me

Akatani Mikumo: this is too cruel

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôm supposed to be the villain here

Mirio Togata: Look forward to Nedzu‚Äôs announcements and/or All Might‚Äôs interviews, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm going to say. 

Akatani Mikumo: it‚Äôs like telling fish to look forward to water

Akatani Mikumo: I haven‚Äôt missed any Nedzu‚Äôs public appearances or All Might‚Äôs interviews in last ten years

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶ 

Mirio Togata: I really don‚Äôt know how to react to this. 

Mirio Togata: you really like All Might, don‚Äôt you?

Akatani Mikumo: If I wasn‚Äôt keeping my sister‚Äôs appearance a secret, I‚Äôd show you the picture my mom took of us while wearing matching All Might onesies

Akatani Mikumo: Also Vampire‚Äôs reaction to seeing my room for the first time was, and I quote: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a lot of All Might.‚Äù

Akatani Mikumo: Let‚Äôs not go deeper than that

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶ your dad didn‚Äôt, like, try to stop that at some point?

Akatani Mikumo: He got punched out by All Might when I was ten years old, so not a lot of time

Akatani Mikumo: but he tried soon before the fight

Akatani Mikumo: I told him to give the merch back or I‚Äôll set his suit collection on fire

Akatani Mikumo: He said I‚Äôm too young to try to bluff like that.

Akatani Mikumo: I wasn‚Äôt bluffing. 

Mirio Togata: you set his suit collection on fire

Akatani Mikumo: yes

Akatani Mikumo: he looked like he wasn‚Äôt sure if he was pissed off for me denying him and wanting All Might‚Äôs merch collection back or proud of me ready to stand up to him AND pull stunt like that on a supervillain while being a ten years old kid

Mirio Togata: you set All for One‚Äôs suit collection on fire to get your All Might merch back as a 10 years old kid

Akatani Mikumo: yes? I already confirmed

Mirio Togata: sorry, still trying to process that and I think that my mind went to where Nejire‚Äôs normally resides in the process 

Mirio Togata: you know I can‚Äôt hear or see it but I‚Äôm like 99% sure that your uncle just fell off his chair in laughter, and he probably isn‚Äôt the only dead hero to do it

Akatani Mikumo: try to imprison me instead of killing when we finally have our last epic battle, because then I‚Äôll be able to write memoirs while in prison (just make sure that Tartarus isn‚Äôt that much of a shithole by then, k?) and then you and your dead heroes will have some quality thing to read

Mirio Togata: tempting
Notes:

    Midoriya most likely wasn't ten years old when that happened. Then again, saying his real age during the incident would provoke very hard to answer questions so there is that.

    The Earthquake starts during the next chapter :P Look forward to it.

Chapter 28: Taking a Stand
Summary:

    UA does something long overdue. Nedzu compensates for his small size. Another plot earthquake starts.

Notes:

(See the end of the chapter for notes.)
Chapter Text

Izuku understood what Mirio meant by watching All Might‚Äôs interview two days later. All Might was a part of some debate panel concerning the heroics and one of the questions concerned ‚Äòvillainous quirks‚Äô. 

‚ÄúHoly shit, I love All Might now.‚Äù Hitoshi announces when Number One Hero finishes verbally chewing everyone in the room about how there are no ‚Äòvillainous quirks‚Äô only villainous people. And how bullying people for having ‚Äòvillainous quirks‚Äô is not only actually villainous (if quirks are involved) but also produces villains, by pushing otherwise decent people beyond the edge. 

‚ÄúYep, welcome to the club.‚Äù Himiko adds and cuddles closer to Izuku. ‚ÄúZuku is the president, obviously.‚Äù 

She was kinda over the revelation of details of sex, and that was reassuring. She was back to cuddling, hugging and so on, but hasn‚Äôt actually mentioned the S-word. Izuku was aware that there was activity on his ‚Äòharem‚Äô chat, though. A lot of it, in fact. 

‚ÄúHow did you tell?‚Äù Izuku asks her, while smiling slightly. ‚ÄòIs it the ‚ÄúNumber One Fan of the Number One Hero‚Äô T-shirt?‚Äù One of his favourites. She still thought that it was weird, but the least weird of his T-shirts. 

‚ÄúPossibly, possibly.‚Äù She replies. ‚ÄúHonestly, it‚Äôs quite great to hear all of that from him. I mean, I know he saves people every day, and is super strong, but‚Ä¶ Endeavor did that too. Though he would never say stuff like that.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou think that it‚Äôll change anything?‚Äù Hitoshi isn‚Äôt fully sold on the idea. It‚Äôs still a very touchy subject to him. His treatment was similar to Himiko‚Äôs. If Izuku‚Äôs grip on Overhaul‚Äôs quirk was worse than it was, Hitoshi would still be missing his tongue. And even after all that, some food still tasted weird to him. 

Izuku COULD technically regrow body parts that were lost for different reasons than his own quirk AND after the fifteen minutes window closed, but it was a mess. Took a long time, required him to study the biological details of whatever he was regrowing, and the result was always subpar when compared to the original. He preferred not to do this, if he could.

‚ÄúOn its own, no.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúAll Might is popular, but not THAT popular. But it‚Äôs a major step forward. If only because of how many people he inspires to become heroes. If those people get influenced by what he said about villainous quirks‚Ä¶ then maybe what happened to Himiko will not happen to some other people out there. And then, with more heroes not being dicks, the public will start to move in a better direction.‚Äù 

Influencing the society as a whole was a lengthy thing. 

‚ÄúApparently it‚Äôs partially because of us.‚Äù He decides to admit that much. Hitoshi and Himiko look at him questioningly. ‚ÄúI might or might not be playing video games online with Lemillion, and he mentioned something about Nedzu and All Might getting inspired by us and preparing something. But he didn‚Äôt mention details.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre playing video games with that hero kid?!‚Äù Hitoshi is shocked. ‚ÄúWell, wow. I didn‚Äôt see that coming. What brought that up?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI wanted to ask someone for relationship tips and after some introspection I discovered that he is the only relatively normal person that I know and can potentially help.‚Äù Izuku replies while absentmindedly picking up some chips. ‚ÄúWhich is kinda sad, all things considered. Plus we both know what it means to have really big boots to fill.‚Äù

They don‚Äôt ask, but Himiko eyes him curiously for a while. Probably over the relationship tips bit. 

Two hours of idling in front of the TV later, Nedzu starts a press conference. 

Rehabilitation class for young vigilantes. And villains too, if they were young enough and were deemed to have a potential to be rehabilitated. Changes to entrance exams to make them more approachable to people without flashy combat quirks (so, for example, mental quirks). That alone would be shocking, but then comes the real bomb. 

THREE slots in the Hero Course reserved for the quirkless. Izuku stares at the screen in shock. Vultures in the room don‚Äôt take it face down and almost start a riot over the idea. Nedzu calmly leaves the stand, which is then taken by the man that introduces himself as Sir Nighteye (Izuku knew, others in the room did not). All Might‚Äôs former sidekick and a pro hero. 

Sir explains (his face strangely intimidating despite being essentially emotionless, enough to calm the riot with a single stare) that he has one of the largest number of closed cases among the pro-heroes nation-wide. Despite not using his quirk during the last six months due to undisclosed personal reasons. He lists two A-Rank villains that he defeated and incarcerated despite fighting de facto quirkless. 

Then he says that UA decided - with support of both All Might and Principal Nedzu - that denying a chance for a career in heroics for people who might have not been born with quirks but had a knack for investigation and planning was illogical. He also mentions that he sees no reason why quirkless individuals were to not fare pretty well in combat. To further support that, he cites an undisclosed underground hero with a quirk allowing him to deactivate non-mutant quirks, who despite that has arrested numerous mutant quirk villains - without using his quirk at all. 

Nedzu returns and adds a few closing statements, including an honest admittance that he doesn‚Äôt expect a quirkless hero to ever reach the Top Thirty - but that he also doesn‚Äôt believe that this is in any way demeaning to them, as what should really matter to heroes is saving others rather than meaningless pursuit of strength (which totally isn‚Äôt read by anyone in the room as a kick in Endeavor‚Äôs dead face and HPSC‚Äô president living face) or amassing popularity. 

‚ÄúQEM is going to have a field day over this.‚Äù Izuku comments when the press conference ends. ‚ÄúForget the UA recommendation seats, those three slots are going to be the most contested school choices in the Japanese education system.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThis is the second best day in my life after the one when Izuku finally noticed that he is my boyfriend.‚Äù Himiko comments dreamily, and Izuku wonders for a few seconds if she has an idea just how spooky that sounded. He decides that probably not, and then moves to more pressing stuff. 

Quirkless forums on the internet were probably on fire right now. Blueberry was out, shopping for Kurogiri if Izuku remembered it correctly. He decided to be the first one to tell her. 

 

SmallMight: Blueberry did you see Nedzu‚Äôs press conference

Blueberry: no, it‚Äôs my turn for the grocery run with Spinner you know

SmallMight: did you bring your QEM phone with you

Blueberry: no? left it in the base. What happened?

SmallMight: quirkless world tilted upside down, their forums on fucking fire, your lieutenants probably going crazy over not having contact with you, you know, the usual

Blueberry: What? 

SmallMight: Nedzu just guaranteed three slots in the UA hero course to the quirkless and with Sir Nighteye publicly bashed the media vultures for claiming that quirkless cannot be heroes

Blueberry: omg

Blueberry: OMG

Blueberry: did I die and this is Heaven

SmallMight: We are all here, so‚Ä¶ probably not?

Blueberry: warp back in five minutes, gotta find a private place

 

Several minutes later she dropped several bags of supplies next to Kurogiri‚Äôs bar (together with Spinner) and ran through the living room. Not long after that Izuku heard her conversing with her lieutenants from the QEM on the phone, although it was less ‚Äòconversing‚Äô and more ‚Äòtrying to scream louder than the other person‚Äô.

Akatani Mikumo: You son of a‚Ä¶ wonderful person.

Mirio Togata: You son of a‚Ä¶ well, almost literal Satan. 

Akatani Mikumo: ouch

Akatani Mikumo: but I kinda had it coming

Mirio Togata: correct

Akatani Mikumo: seriously, this is awesome

Akatani Mikumo: Mindscrew just joined club of All Might‚Äôs fans within LoV, and Sunset almost warped Spinner into a wall when she was returning from the grocery run in hurry

Akatani Mikumo: congratulations

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶ grocery run. 

Mirio Togata: really

Mirio Togata: I mean, I was living among you for like two days so I know how weirdly normal it feels, but still, using warpgate to do grocery runs for a villain organization is just kinda‚Ä¶ 

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôll let you know that I do have to brush my teeth for them to be healthy

Akatani Mikumo: And Himiko regularly needs all those weird girl things that I don‚Äôt want to think about

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôm afraid that villain status also doesn‚Äôt make you exempt from preparing food, getting stuff to drink and figuring out who is on toilet duty today

Akatani Mikumo: we had a timetable hanging out in the living room but I think Dabi burned it this morning because he is an ass and didn‚Äôt like the schedule

Akatani Mikumo: kids these days

Mirio Togata: first of all, he is 7 years older than you, stop talking like that

Mirio Togata: second of all, sorry, I don‚Äôt really have all that much contact with villain groups AND I spend last 2,5 years learning about how to defeat you in combat

Mirio Togata: I think my view on villains got a bit too narrowed down to combat, investigation and so on

Akatani Mikumo: Nah just kidding I know what you mean

Akatani Mikumo: Symbol of Peace should probably know that people on the other side are still people

Akatani Mikumo: if there is one thing I respect in All Might the most it‚Äôs the fact that despite waging war against my father he still took villains prisoner, and the only fatalities were mostly accidents or cases where it was either them or civilians

Akatani Mikumo: good to know you‚Äôre in the same camp

Mirio Togata: you just want a nemesis that isn‚Äôt going to punch your head off

Akatani Mikumo: you already killed me you know, so yeah, not looking forward to a repetition

Mirio Togata: what?

Akatani Mikumo: the quirk that saved me in Hosu downgrades lethal damage to non-lethal level

Akatani Mikumo: It was USED after your punch, so you did give me instantly lethal degree of damage

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶

Mirio Togata: wow

Mirio Togata: and you still saved Gran Torino after that? and let me out?

Akatani Mikumo: Mirio you are not a regular hero (just a provisional license still) and you were facing an S-Rank and a hardened killer that just knocked out your mentor

Akatani Mikumo: with no chances for back-up and a person (however shitty Endeavor was as a person) to defend

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôd have been more angry if you pulled your punches in the circumstances

Akatani Mikumo: Besides I‚Äùm like 99% sure that you didn‚Äôt want the punch to be THIS powerful

Mirio Togata: yes

Akatani Mikumo: I still expect you to be slightly less deadly if you try to arrest me and my friends (well, reasonably less deadly, I‚Äôm not telling you to die trying), and if you go after my sister for some sinister nedzu-ific reason I swear to‚Ä¶ everything I can think off that I‚Äôm going to break more than just your limbs this time

Mirio Togata: everyone got the clue after your threat to Nedzu, don‚Äôt worry

Mirio Togata: family out

Mirio Togata: besides, your mom isn‚Äôt really interesting to us nor dangerous to anyone, and your sister isn‚Äôt a villain

Akatani Mikumo: My mom is VERY dangerous, just doesn‚Äôt apply her danger to anything because she is too busy crying about the weather being nice, not nice or way too neutral today or some other super important reasons like being happy, sad or, well, being neither happy nor sad. She cries a lot. 

Mirio Togata: really? dangerous? 

Akatani Mikumo: I saw her repeatedly smack my dad with a rolled newspaper in the head over him doing something stupid while I was a child, so yes

Akatani Mikumo: D a n g e r o u s 

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶ 

Mirio Togata: your mom

Mirio Togata: repeatedly smacked

Mirio Togata: ALL FOR ONE

Mirio Togata: with a rolled newspaper

Mirio Togata: in the head

Mirio Togata: and she survived that?!

Akatani Mikumo: and he apologized 

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶

Akatani Mikumo: on his knees

Mirio Togata: I‚Äôm kinda sad that I don‚Äôt hear what‚Äôs happening in my head, it‚Äôs probably a riot in there

Mirio Togata: doesn‚Äôt she just have a small object attraction quirk?

Mirio Togata:  I know it can pull small things really fast 

Mirio Togata: she once pulled a diamond with enough strength for it to fly out of the building with a speed of like 50km/h

Mirio Togata:  but that‚Äôs not THAT dangerous unless you are in the way of an object, yes?

Akatani Mikumo: do you want a list of internal (or not) organs that technically count as small objects? let me just say that it starts with the eyes.

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶ 

Mirio Togata: okay this is some of the most messed up thing I have ever heard about

Akatani Mikumo: Vampire thought that it‚Äôs super cool. And Mindscrew had to borrow a cat from Kurogiri to deal with the mind images.

Akatani Mikumo: that‚Äôs the type of people I have to deal with on a daily basis

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶ 

Mirio Togata: you need to get more normal friends

Akatani Mikumo: IT‚ÄôS NOT AS EASY AS YOU‚ÄôD LIKE TO THINK WHEN YOU ARE ON THE TOP 10 MOST WANTED LIST

Akatani Mikumo: and the only internet acquaintances I‚Äôd possibly like to meet IS legally obligated to punch me into a stratosphere when we meet irl

Akatani Mikumo: so yeah

Mirio Togata: can I ask you a question

Akatani Mikumo: you know the drill - you can ask, I‚Äôm not obligated to answer

Mirio Togata: what‚Äôs your, uhm, general opinion on All for One‚Äôs parenting? Everyone here thinks that you are rebelling against him for bad parenting

Akatani Mikumo: ah yes, the hardest question

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôm still trying to sort out my opinion on it, tbh?

Akatani Mikumo: Like, I have two collections of villain merch - mostly figurines - in my home (one for villains I dislike and one I like) and he has no figurines because I just don‚Äôt know what to think about him, even after so many years

Akatani Mikumo: no figurines, no need to ask myself what shelf it belongs to

Akatani Mikumo: His villainous career is absolute definition of monstrous and it‚Äôs where me, you and the 26 agree [we can also agree that All Might stopping him was a blessing to the world]

Akatani Mikumo: but he still was my father, and as much as it might sound unbelievable, he was‚Ä¶ kinda a good one?

Akatani Mikumo: he tried his best, mom corrected him when he went too controlling or villainous

Akatani Mikumo: I do remember her shouting at him when he went too controlling about my life and it was something like ‚ÄòTHIS IS WHY YOUR BROTHER REBELLED AGAINST YOU, THAT‚ÄôS A FAMILY NOT A TOTALITARIAN STATE, HISASHI‚Äô and then bam with a newspaper

Akatani Mikumo: mom‚Äôs kinda badass when needed

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs putting it lightly

Akatani Mikumo: I also still remember that battle when I came home from school with some burns, the bullying stuff was found out and me and my mom had to (and boy if that wasn‚Äôt a hard battle) persuade him against burning the school down and doing something unspeakable to the teachers who supported the bullying

Akatani Mikumo: My childhood was an‚Ä¶ interesting experience. 

Mirio Togata: that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ one way of putting it

Akatani Mikumo: I honestly don‚Äôt know how much it was actual love on his side, sometimes I still think that he just grew bored with his life (two centuries is a long time) and decided that family life could be an interesting distraction

Akatani Mikumo: but if so, then he was pretty damn invested in it

Akatani Mikumo: then he got punched before I finished an education that was supposed to make me more like him, but I did have a tutor or two remaining to go forward with it (just no master manipulator capable of turning me into a malevolent evil deity and stuff like that) so here I am now

Akatani Mikumo: Still looking forward to the memoirs?

Mirio Togata: yes

Mirio Togata: this is a bestseller material

Akatani Mikumo: yes just be aware that it will mention how All Might‚Äôs greatest nemesis was more afraid of his wife and a rolled newspaper than the Number One Hero xDD

Mirio Togata: ...

Mirio Togata: give me some time to unpack this

Mirio Togata: in the meantime, Nejire did something crazy today

Akatani Mikumo: tell me more :D it‚Äôs like hearing about what‚Äôs Gremlin doing but without people dying

Mirio Togata: could you p l e a s e stop make things disturbing for once, ugh

The awkward silence continued until the advent of the UA training camp. Izuku managed to find some traces of activity on Overhaul‚Äôs side, but nothing conclusive - some sightings of his soldiers, an attack on some quirk research facility in Kyoto (repelled by the heroes), and so on. 

This still counted as an awkward silence in the country to Izuku. He had no idea why Overhaul sent his goons to attack that place. What were the chances of it having some knowledge that would interest him? Maybe it was about the medical supplies? There was a lot of head scratching in the country over that. 

Izuku‚Äôs spy in the UA somehow wasn‚Äôt arrested on arrival. Giving the League loads of valuable (potentially) intel.

 

UA-Spy: holy fucking shit Nedzu is batshit insane

SmallMight: ?

VampirePrincess: is this a ‚Äòrepeat what we already know‚Äô day for our spy?

UA-Spy: this is less a school training camp and more a fucking military exercise

SmallMight: details

Insomniac: yeah 

FuckSchool: I don‚Äôt want to hear about UA

VampirePrincess: it might inspire new theories for you

FuckSchool: you have a point, I‚Äôll stay

UA-Spy: Every single hero class is here, training in separate areas of a really large forest.

UA-Spy: Nedzu subcontracted like twenty different heroes with training licenses with connections to the UA to deal with the chaos

UA-Spy: Cementoss, Power Loader and the support students built a F U C K I N G   F O R T R E S S, which seems to include everything from fallout shelters and murder robot base to Nedzu‚Äôs command center and center of the communication network

UA-Spy: It even has an A R T I L L E R Y battery and AA missile launchers if the gossip from the support classes is correct, and I‚Äôm at a point where I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it was powered by a nuclear reactor with an explosive self-destruction option tied to Nedzu‚Äôs heartbeat in case someone killed him while inside the fortress because he is this level of spiteful prick

SmallMight: WHAT ARE THE UA‚ÄôS BUDGET NUMBERS

SmallMight: AND WHO IS FINANCING IT

SmallMight: I NEED TO KNOW SO DAMN MUCH

UA-Spy: I KNOW RIGHT?! 

UA-Spy: I mean, holy shit

UA-Spy: I know they are probably going to reuse the fortress the next year, and that most of the stuff inside was a form of month-long large scale training exercise for the support classes (and that the school will probably sell most of what they did after the training camp ends) but

UA-Spy: seriously wtf

UA-Spy: that rat is insane

SneakyGecko: that‚Äôs saying it lightly holy shit

UA-Spy: you have twenty additional part-time teachers, and no less than thirty additional heroes (mostly lower-ranked and tied to the UA) patrolling the area

UA-Spy: And something like one hundred hero trainees plus fifty or so support guys manning the fortress, doing stuff like maintenance and communication. Oh and I think like twenty gen eds from various years that are looking to go into medicine and have live exercise of running a first aid point with Recovery Girl

SmallMight: I‚Äôm 99% sure that rat is just compensating for his small size

UA-Spy: LOL

Insomniac: sounds like it xD

SmallMight: I mean, it makes lowkey sense - country is messed up, and it‚Äôs a good idea to look like a goddamn hedgehog to villains willing to punch you

SmallMight: but

SmallMight: did someone ever try to explain to him what MODERATION means

UA-Spy: he probably things it‚Äôs some form of english cuisine

VampirePrincess: XD

SmallMight: okay, any notable faces among the heroes/ you said that mostly lower ranked)

UA-Spy: I saw Sir Nighteye with some skeletal guy that I don‚Äôt know who was, Kamui Woods, Wild Wild Pussycats (I think it‚Äôs their joint to begin with), some Idaten sidekicks, Gran Torino (he just isn‚Äôt going to give up and retire, doesn‚Äôt he?)

UA-Spy: oh and Boulder

SmallMight: Rank 15 Hero? From the Hero Commission?

UA-Spy: Did you think that the Commission would be alright with Nedzu amassing enough firepower in a single place to storm the National Diet without any form of oversight

SmallMight: fair, I think he is one of the more decent of the Commission heroes, so it‚Äôs nice that‚Äôs him

UA-Spy: so‚Ä¶ do you think you‚Äôll manage to extract me if they arrest me

SmallMight: if not from the camp then from wherever else they‚Äôll take you

SmallMight: even if I have to attack Tartarus for it

UA-Spy: Awww

Overhaul exits the portal within the forest. It‚Äôs late evening, so darkness has already overtook most of the surrounding area. 

He is at the edge of the cliff, granting him a beautiful view of the forest in front of him. He sees some lights here and there, each signifying a cancerous lump of the disease that he is here to excise. 

Others let the disease fester for too long. But it won‚Äôt last for long. He is here to help. He is here to help them all. 

‚ÄúStart warping in our army.‚Äù He says to the QLF soldier that he gave the disease he took from Eclipse. Doing such a thing is distasteful, but he needs to compromise sometimes. This is all for the greater good. 

The portals open. Soldiers start to walk through. They no longer doubt his leadership, and are here for the same goal that he is - to heal the world. Even if it means killing it in the process. 

This is merely one of the several units. There will be more. Oh, so much more. This is war, after all. And he plans to win it with the first battle. 

‚ÄúConnect me with their network.‚Äù Overhaul says to another of his soldiers. His quirk is technopathic one, boosted greatly with a special brand of trigger. One of oh so many surprises he prepared to destroy the UA, and put Japan on its knees. 

 

***

 

Nedzu is in his command center, observing the evening exercises through numerous cameras and sensors. Seeing two hundred people act on his desires is a bit soothing to his ego, he has to admit. Especially as everything is going so nicely.

Then everything goes to hell.

‚ÄúMy name is Overhaul.‚Äù He hears from the speakers. Nedzu freezes. And so do dozens of people throughout the forest. ‚ÄúAnd I consider myself a visionary‚Ä¶ and a healer. But the world‚Ä¶ uuuugh‚Ä¶ calls me a villain.‚Äù 

Nedzu sees red dots popping up on the screen, signifying the sensors detecting intruders. There are many. Oh so many. 

‚ÄúDo not worry.‚Äù Overhaul continues. ‚ÄúYou are sick, yes. But I have come to heal you. I have come to heal you all. I shall free this world from the diseases known as quirks,  heroes and villains. Uuuugh. I shall usher in a new age upon the world. An utopia.‚Äù 

At least a thousand dots. The systems start to interpret about two hundred of them as‚Ä¶ 

Nedzu can feel his blood go cold. 

‚ÄúI shall take that moment to announce a merger between the Quirkless Liberation Front and several other groups. Including the remnants of the empire of a certain great man. Man so great that Nedzu and the Hero Commission agreed to keep him hidden from the world. Uuuugh‚Ä¶ out of fear.‚Äù Overhaul adds. 

Frozen Nedzu observes a crowd of no less than two hundred noumus marching towards the center of the training camp. Towards where most of his students are. 

‚ÄúWe are now the Paranormal Liberation Front.‚Äù Overhaul says. ‚ÄúAnd we have come to kill you all. I wish you a good night.‚Äù 

With an agonizing shriek, the communication network set up by Power Loader dies down. Bringing down the means to communicate with the outside world, to coordinate numerous separated groups of heroes and hero trainees and to observe movements of the enemy.

Seconds later the first artillery rounds start to fall on the fortress. Nedzu can feel it shaking ever so slightly under the distant explosions. 

‚ÄúOh dear.‚Äù He says. The nearest support students stare at him in terror.

Izuku is woken up by an alert signal from the Villain Network app. He manages to untangle himself from Himiko (who was very in a mood for some cuddling in the evening, sue them both about it) after a few seconds of struggle. He is doing his best to not wake her up. 

He opens the app. And can feel his blood go cold.

 

UA-Spy: OVERHAUL AND QLF ARE ATTACKING THE CAMP

UA-Spy: HERO COMMS DOWN, IT‚ÄôS TOTAL CHAOS

UA-Spy: I NEED HELP OR EVAC RIGHT THE FUCK NOW

 

Izuku hits a button on his phone that he never got to use before. Sirens start blasting throughout the building, brutally tearing everyone from their sleep. Himiko eyes dart open and she grabs her knife (where did she even hide it for the night).

Izuku switches onto another app. 

‚ÄúEmergency sortie, everyone but Sunset.‚Äù He can hear his voice coming from the speakers through the building. The alerts die down - everyone is awake already. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Overhaul. Load up everything you fucking can. Gremlin, take Gadget.‚Äù Himiko leaps towards her wardrobe, where her clothes and knives are. 

 

SmallMight: We‚Äôre coming. Hold the line. 

UA-Spy: IT‚ÄôS NOT AS EASY AS YOU‚ÄôD LIKE TO THINK

‚ÄúIncoming warp jump detected.‚Äù One of his lieutenants announces. ‚ÄúLanding coordinates scrambled.‚Äù Another useful disease he had to install in a previously pure person. 

Somewhere else, League members emerge from Kurogiri to find themselves scattered throughout the forest, with heroes and villains battling it out around them.

‚ÄúWonderful.‚Äù Overhaul replies. Everything is proceeding according to plan. 
Notes:

    The next few chapters of the plot rollercoaster called the Training Camp Arc include loads and loads of characters dying or getting badly wounded, just saying. And yes, it includes League members.

    Shoutout to that one guy/gal that figured that the next plottwist is Overhaul throwing his lots with Doctor Garaki. Congrats. The QLF is still QLF (no mass noumification), so you didn't suspect the result of Overhaul getting access to Garaki's archive of quirk samples to use with his quirk transplanting Science of Evil :P So no full points for anyone.

Chapter 29: Training Camp [Part One]
Summary:

    Paranormal Liberation Front's assault on the UA Training Camp commences. It's as ugly as you'd like to believe.

Chapter Text

Zealot is reasonably angry. And lost. Mostly lost. His spatial awareness is‚Ä¶ lacking, to say the least. He has no idea where he is, and he has no idea which direction is which. He is too lost to be able to focus on his anger.

And he has a lot of it. 

His life is, objectively speaking, a mess. Being born to a supervillain is bad enough. He can‚Äôt express with words alone how much he relates with Midoriya Izuku. Only his supervillain parent was charismatic enough to make him do some extremely bad things before he changed his mind. 

The change happened mostly due to him reading about the religious sources of the CRC. He had no idea how much of the CRC teachings were just petty hatred coated in words of people who would have wanted nothing to do with clan members. Although this is perhaps a wrong thing to say - most of those people would have wanted Purity dead or jailed. They were mostly against inactivity in the face of evil.

So he threw out everything that felt like re-packaged hatred, turned towards some actually constructive teachings of long dead people. But he still felt guilt. He couldn‚Äôt become a hero, but he could be a vigilante. 

How exactly he became a villain was a mystery to him. But it wasn‚Äôt a bad type of a villain, all things considered. So he could still use his quirk. He still remembers how it basically died out on him when he realized that he was doing evil things to undeserving people as a part of the CRC. Persuading himself that he is worthy of his own power took him a while. 

He still could power up to Gear Five (his maximum) only when facing people like Purge. People whose evil he knew and understood personally. People whom he couldn‚Äôt see as anything other than monsters. Monsters seeking to harm the innocents for their own petty gain. 

Only Gear Four otherwise, and even this took a lot of effort. Like facing the polar opposite of his old ‚Äòfamily‚Äô, the ISP. 

Overhaul sounded like someone to beat that record. Zealot barely restrained his desire for murder when boss narrated to him and the remaining old followers of Stain what Overhaul did to his sister. 

But no Overhaul in sight. Eventually he did run into someone, but those certainly weren‚Äôt people warranting the attention of his quirk. 

Students. He didn‚Äôt recognize what course they were from. Seven people, three of them badly wounded and carried by their friends. They were running away from something, judging from some of them glancing behind them. But then they froze when they saw him emerge from the woods in front of him. 

‚ÄúWh‚Ä¶ who are you?‚Äù One of the students asks. Ironically enough, a complex mutant quirk carrier. A kin of the people he once killed for the CRC. Some mammalian creature. 

‚ÄúNot an enemy.‚Äù He replies. ‚ÄúWho is following you?‚Äù 

‚ÄúMo‚Ä¶ monsters.‚Äù She replies. ‚ÄúOur class, they‚Ä¶‚Äù She fails to say anything more. She is choking on her tears. Zealot doesn‚Äôt ask. She might be crying but she is still carrying a wounded friend to safety. Admirable. 

One of her other friends screams - the abominations began to emerge from the woods behind them.  

‚ÄúKeep running.‚Äù He says and starts walking towards them. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look back.‚Äù 

They do as he say. 

Gear Four. 

He feels his body grow, the addictive feeling of power and fury overwhelming his every limb. How many people - kids, maybe not a lot younger than him, but still kids - did they kill? How many did they wound? How many of their victims were here because they wanted to help others? To be heroes? 

Gear Five. 

He closes the distance and punches the nearest noumu through its abdomen. It flies back, screeching and howling like Zealot would imagine a demon would. 

He destroys the monsters left and right, but they just keep coming. Is that their main force? Is he going to die here? No help in sight. Just enemies. Crawling, walking, running and flying towards him. He can feel his arms tire, he can feel his skin getting cut and bruised. Gear Five doesn‚Äôt make him invincible, not against those many enemies, not for so long.  

Is he going to die? Just like that? To be remembered as a villain that fell in battle against other villains?

But‚Ä¶ will it be that bad if the kids get to safety? Will it be that bad to die if his last act will be saving a kin of those he once killed? Wouldn‚Äôt it be great to at least die like a hero should?

Gear Six.

Zealot kills ninety-four Noumus - including four High Ends - before getting overwhelmed by their numbers. His last stand buys the students gathering at the training field in the middle of the camp fifteen minutes. 

He dies happy.

 

***

 

Legion lands in the middle of the forest. He can hear a cacophony of the sounds of battle in the background. Distant gunfire, quirks and explosions mix up into an orchestra he would never want to listen to. 

He is alone. He shouldn‚Äôt be alone. Something didn‚Äôt work. He connects to the chat with his speech-to-text device. 

 

SmallMight: REPORT

CatProvider: Something scrambled the warp, I‚Äôm alone in the forest. 

Gremlin: same

 

Others do not answer. They are either in combat, or‚Ä¶ worse. 

No. Don‚Äôt think about it. 

 

SmallMight: Gremlin, get your recon drones airborne

SmallMight: if you can, try to bring hero comms back online

 

If the attack is anywhere near as prepared as he expects Overhaul to be, this is going to be a massacre if the heroes are scattered through the forest with no means of coordinating their movements.  

He has no idea where to go. So he heads towards what sounds like the nearest battle. He fails to reach it before he gets a report. 

 

Gremlin: It‚Äôs a disaster

SmallMight: what

Gremlin: at least a thousand enemies, hero comms still down

Gremlin: at least a hundred humanoid noumus

SmallMight: WHAT

Gremlin: Nedzu‚Äôs fortress under siege (tanks, noumus, infantry and artillery fire)

Gremlin: several hero classes overwhelmed or on the run

Gremlin: the attackers are pressing towards the center of the area, where the main camp buildings and the training field are located, the scattered students gravitate towards those places

SmallMight: well that‚Äôs just fucking great

Eraserhead understands that they can‚Äôt hope to win this battle when several students come running to the training field and start shouting about an army of monsters on their tail. 

The underground hero would have questioned the idea of ‚Äòarmy of monsters‚Äô, but whatever is still happening in that direction is clearly scary. Someone‚Äôs fighting there, and he feels like he‚Äôs watching All Might fight with full power. Trees and humans (or humanoid monsters, as the kids claim) are literally sent flying.

Yeah, not touching that. 

‚ÄúVlad, we‚Äôre leaving.‚Äù The other underground hero looks at him, visibly frowning. ‚ÄúMain camp, now.‚Äù

They have the majority of their first year classes with them. Together with the Wild Wild Pussycats. The location is basically undefendable, and if the enemy commander has a brain (he probably has), their current location is one of the priority targets. 

‚ÄúAre you sure about tha‚Ä¶‚Äù Vlad fails to finish the sentence. 

‚ÄúOH LOOKIE HERE!‚Äù They all hear a shout. Eraserhead‚Äôs eyes jump to the figures emerging from the woods. He recognizes the speaker. ‚ÄúSo many kids! This is going to be fun. I knew that joining the House of Red was a good idea!‚Äù 

Eraserhead had that name once. It was apparently an organization of serial killers, but no one believed that it could actually exist. It was just an urban legend. 

‚ÄúMuscular!‚Äù One of the Pussycats shouts. Their kid, Kouta, looks like he just saw a ghost. 

Eraserhead recognizes two others. Moonfish, the cannibal murderer. And Magne, serial killer. There is a crowd of lesser villains behind them. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but we aren‚Äôt supposed to let you retreat.‚Äù Magne sounds almost apologetic. ‚ÄúNot until the noumus get here. So excuse me for that, but please die.‚Äù

Eraserhead unleashes his capture scarf. Other heroes and trainees who can actually fight tense up and prepare for battle. They are ready for it - but not for Stain and Decay suddenly leaping from the forest to the left of the villain group. 

And certainly not for Stain decapitating Muscular with his katana, driving a knife in the side of Moonfish‚Äôs head all the way to its hilt and slitting Magne‚Äôs throat before disappearing in the woods to the right. All while Decay spreads his quirk over the crowd of lesser villains behind the three, killing no less than twenty of them and sending the other half fleeing back into the woods. Before vanishing in the woods after Stain. 

The entire process took less than half a minute. Decay spent most of it chanting ‚ÄúEXP EXP EXP EXP‚Äù repeatedly. Stain was intimidatingly silent. 

‚ÄúI really think that we should go.‚Äù Eraserhead announces in the resulting silence. This time nobody complains. Mandalay sends an open warning to everyone in the vicinity that the main training area has fallen, and heroes and students are to retreat to the main camp.

When the noumus finally arrive at the training area, they found nothing but corpses of their allies. 

Eraserhead‚Äôs group encounters the vanguard of the former QLF forces before they manage to get to the main camp. The fierce fighting erupts throughout the forest. 

 

*** 

 

Somewhere else in the forest, Kamui Woods and a bigger part of the 2-A class encounter a company sized force of the QLF with heavy noumu support. The surprise is total, but the wood hero manages to entrap most of the QLF soldiers with his branches. 

The students flee while the remaining QLF soldiers turn their guns on the hero. He manages to buy enough time for the students to escape before joining the list of casualties. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a hacking attack!‚Äù Power Loader shouts back from the main communications room. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs some form of technopathy quirk, probably boosted with Trigger. We should get comms back on once Eraserhead uses his quirk on the perpetrator or after he gets off Trigger!‚Äù 

(somewhere in the forest a pink haired girl shouts triumphantly and tells her crush that she is ready)

‚ÄúIt will take at least an hour.‚Äù Nedzu replies. He is calm. Oh, so very calm. Or that‚Äôs what he is trying to tell himself. It doesn‚Äôt work. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have an hour. Students and teachers are fighting alone, we can‚Äôt give them artillery support or deploy robots without communications. We need‚Ä¶‚Äù

The large screen in front of the principal flares up. On it is a picture of a chibi-fied Gremlin armed with a comically oversized chainsaw making a V-sign with her other hand, with a text ‚ÄòVillain Industries‚Äô beneath it. 

More words pop up underneath. ‚ÄòPresents a Baby #347: Independent Drone-based Field Communication Network‚Äô. 

Then it vanishes, and Nedzu is greeted with a familiar sight of the command map. The situation on it is way, way worse than it was the last time he saw it.

‚ÄúYou owe me for that, Nedzu.‚Äù He hears a voice from the speaker. ‚ÄúA fucking lot.‚Äù Different voice adds. 

‚ÄúLegion?!‚Äù Nedzu is shocked. For the first time tonight, it‚Äôs a positive shock. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù

‚ÄúSaving your rodent ass and hopefully trying to kill Overhaul.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúLeague is scattered around the forest alongside the heroes. I‚Äôm god knows where, you have a comfy command post with an ability to see everything. I told the League members to listen to your orders. So start issuing them.‚Äù 

The command system is optimized to work well with his High Spec quirk. The information flashes before his eyes, Nedzu‚Äôs brain taking in and analyzing entire pages of text within miliseconds.

The situation is critical. No less than thirty students and heroes are already dead. Majority of the remaining ones are either wounded or scattered throughout the forest. He sees many groups composed of one or two heroes and whatever students from broken classes that manage to latch unto them. 

The crowd of noumus approached from the east, the main QLF forces from the west. They practically severed the area in half, overwhelming the main training area that acted as the geographic center of the UA facilities. The camp in the southwest will be attacked next. The fortress in the northeast is still under siege by a detached force of the Paranormal Liberation Front. 

Another detached group attacked the field hospital. The attack failed spectacularly due to All Might visiting it for the medical check-up (with his entourage of 1-A students), but it was the only positive of the situation. Well, that and the fact that the League intervened. 

The situation is critical. But Nedzu lives for moments like these. He already has a plan. A lot of those. 

He hits the button. 

‚ÄúNedzu to all students and faculty in the area‚Ä¶‚Äù He says loudly. ‚ÄúI authorize all students for combat. Due to the severity of the situation I officially change engagement protocols. Heroes and students, fight to kill, I repeat, fight to kill. Do not try to apprehend enemies. I‚Äôm taking full responsibility for that. Do not engage League of Villains members, they are our allies for the time being.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt have time to listen to sounds of surprise, and switches the channel. 

‚ÄúPower Loader, send out the robots.‚Äù It was time to lift the siege of his fortress. ‚ÄúExtermination Mode, please.‚Äù Power Loader nods on the screen and gets back to work. Nedzu switches over to Snipe. 

Judging from the image of the screen he and a group of 2-B students are defending a ridge against an advance party of the QLF soldiers supported with some noumus. Excellent situation for a person with a gun and a Homing quirk. 

‚ÄúSnipe, you have another group of QLF soldiers about to flank you from the north.‚Äù He hears a mumble of acknowledgment. ‚ÄúRetreat southwest, I have a job for you.‚Äù But first he has to find other people to help in it. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúThey got their‚Ä¶ uuuugh‚Ä¶ comms back.‚Äù Overhaul announces. Doctor Ujiko winces oddly on the screen. 

‚ÄúWhy? That shouldn‚Äôt have happened.‚Äù Overhaul had a decent amount of respect for Ujiko‚Äôs knowledge. All for One had a good taste of co-workers. But he was an awful commander material, and they both knew it. Which is why Kai was the one in charge of the operation. ‚ÄúHow do you know that?‚Äù 

Way too jumpy. 

‚ÄúBecause six ‚Äòscattered‚Äô groups of students and teachers just simultaneously converged on one of my QLF companies and are in the process of annihilating it.‚Äù He sees a two-meter wide stone boulder rolling through one of his tanks, not stopping at all despite encountering the armored surface of the vehicle, exploding it in the process. Some officer is trying to shout orders before an improbably accurate bullet blows his head off. 

Snipe and Boulder. Overhaul is absolutely overjoyed. 

He switches to another camera, this time the one showing the assault on Nedzu‚Äôs fortress. Right in time to see a 3-Pointer robot unleashing a rain of missiles on several vehicles, shredding the soldiers around it with shrapnels. One of the tanks manages to nail him, but Overhaul can see more robots emerging from the fortress. Including a looming giant of a 0-Pointer. No way his tanks can take THAT down. 

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs just great.‚Äù Overhaul announces. ‚ÄúAttacks on the fortress and on the field hospital have failed, uuuuugh. We captured the training area, but we lost half of the noumus from the main group and the defenders had time to retreat. Enemy now has an information advantage and has begun to deploy robots. Plan Maximum no longer feasible, uuugh, unless we decide to field the Purified or the 3rd Gen Noumus.‚Äù 

‚ÄúToo early for that.‚Äù Ujiko replies promptly. ‚ÄúNot enough of them to surely win, and if the enemy captures them, we‚Äôll lose the advantage of surprise.‚Äù Overhaul disliked how cowardly Ujiko could be. But this one time he decided to not argue about it. They had an alternative. And he more or less agrees with the Doctor. 

‚ÄúPlan Minimum it is, then.‚Äù Overhaul replies promptly. He starts barking orders. The former QLF personnel around him obeys unquestioningly. 

‚ÄúWhat about the quirk suppression gas?‚Äù Ujiko decides to irritate him further after a few seconds. 

‚ÄúWe have an entire two warheads left.‚Äù Overhaul replies. One was for Musutafu, one for the I-Island. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to need both for something.‚Äù One in case heroes found his base, and one to blow up Ujiko‚Äôs face afterwards (as he is the most likely traitor to lead the heroes to his hideout). ‚ÄúEclipse has been too‚Ä¶ generous with them. Uuugh.‚Äù 

With the destruction of his vanguard company, the group from the training area managed to retreat to the main camp. They had some casualties, but nothing major. Thankfully, that was only a passing concern. 

He had his main forces remain coherent near the center of the area, but spread the rest and told them to look through the woods and kill everyone wearing UA uniforms or hero costumes. There were many survivors hiding in the forest, and he was planning to sweep them all. All of that‚Ä¶ a distraction.

He discovers that Nedzu found his command post when the first artillery rounds start to fall around him. The second one hit right in the middle of a crowd of his staff officers, sending some body parts flying. 

He had himself warped out by his Eclipse copy. The warp scrambler had no way of preventing that, as he was among the body parts. 

‚ÄúWell, fuck.‚Äù Overhaul mumbles to himself after emerging in his secondary command post. This was going to hurt. And certainly wasn‚Äôt part of the plan. 

Plan Minimum was still in the game, though.

Legion is still hopelessly lost in the forest somewhere to the south of the enemy‚Äôs main force when he got the message from Kurogiri. 

‚ÄúNedzu, Kurogiri can warp freely now.‚Äù He says. Few kilometers to the north of him a certain rat perks up in his bunker. ‚ÄúThe source of the warp interference moved to the south-east. Do you need Giri to give someone a lift?‚Äù 

‚ÄúHow ok is he with being a living ambulance for the duration of this mess?‚Äù Nedzu asks back. Izuku chuckles. 

‚ÄúTaking kids to safety? Oh, he‚Äôll be overjoyed. Just send him the coordinates and keep him away from the south-east.‚Äù Legion replies, he can hear Nedzu saying something that he can‚Äôt hear. Somewhere away from him a warper changes position and thoroughly spooks several wounded members of the 2-B class before teleporting them to Recovery Girl‚Äôs hospital. 

‚ÄúOverhaul‚Äôs changing his strategy.‚Äù Nedzu returns his attention to Legion. ‚ÄúHis main forces are in the middle of the area, but I can see many smaller groups, typically a squad of QLF soldiers and one or two noumus, scattered around the area. Ideas?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou asking me?‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúAm I supposed to see this as a compliment? Also, no. I have no idea. I don‚Äôt know him that much, but tell me if something changes.‚Äù 

What is Overhaul doing? 

Three minutes later Nedzu finds Overhaul‚Äôs second command post. He chuckles maniacally alongside Power Loader when they start shelling it.

‚ÄúI realize that this might be a bit awkward.‚Äù Dabi announces to the group of students in front of him. ‚ÄúBut you heard the announcement about the League being your allies. And I might need a hand.‚Äù 

His younger brother, Shoto, doesn‚Äôt seem awfully happy about the very idea. Then again, his face is so expressive that he just doesn‚Äôt seem. Whatever emotions you add after those words, the sentence will make sense. 

‚ÄúYou are a villain.‚Äù Shoto finally says. Dabi adds ‚Äòmaking his two-coloured brother into an emotionally disabled wreck‚Äô to the list of reasons why he hates Endeavor. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt believe it when I saw the footage from Hosu.‚Äù 

He has a few friends with him. They must have gotten separated when Eraserhead‚Äôs group run into QLF vanguard. The french guy was shot and is bleeding badly. Shoto is being an obstructive ass. 

He hears shouts. Not heroes. QLF found them.

Kurogiri knows they need a lift. So time to hold until he gets there. The French guy can‚Äôt continue moving with a hole in his stomach either way. 

‚ÄúSure, sure, little bro.‚Äù Dabi decides against pressing the issue. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll talk some other time. Listen, I‚Äôm going to burn those assholes alive. Can you use your ice to cool me down when I inevitably overheat?‚Äù 

He is vaguely conflicted about the idea of making Shoto kill people. This surprises him. He considered killing him to hurt Endeavor before he ran into Stain and then Legion. Is Midoriya rubbing onto him? 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Shoto replies. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready to freeze you.‚Äù 

Well if that ain‚Äôt ominous.

Elsewhere in the forest, Gremlin finally loses it. 

Her mental state is precarious. She doesn‚Äôt mention a lot of things to Izuku, because he worries too much. Like, alright, she does keep seeing her dead parents telling her to murder people, but it‚Äôs not like she listens to them, so it‚Äôs alright, yes? And her Ma is often telling her how to make some newest combat baby, so it‚Äôs alright, yes? 

Okay, the ‚Äòkill them all‚Äô part is relatively rare. And mostly in situations like these. When she really has to kill people. So it‚Äôs encouragement! Not a mental disorder! She just has her dead parents in her head, giving her words of praise and telling her to do better. That‚Äôs great! Not bad! Like her own cheerleading team. But others would probably misunderstand. Especially Izuku.

But now the situation is critical. And nobody notices how Gremlin slips down further than ever. 

She stumbles from behind the trees. In front of her is a tank and twenty people armed with guns. They are all wearing Rikiya Yotsubashi‚Äôs faces. 

‚ÄúKill him, Mei!‚Äù Her parents shout at her from their backseat in her brain. ‚ÄúShow him your  babies!‚Äù Oh, she will. 

‚ÄúRIKIYA-SAN!!!‚Äù Gremlin shouts cheerfully and waves her hand at them. Gadget, her dog and a personalized second gen noumu is following her obediently. The recent, wonderful present from Izuku. She loves him so much. He is the only person that understands her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy to see you!‚Äù 

‚ÄúThe fuck?‚Äù One of the Rikiya‚Äôs asks, visibly dumbfounded. ‚ÄúDo any of you know her?‚Äù

‚ÄúHell no, no one here with that name.‚Äù Another one, his upper half emerging from the tank‚Äôs turret. ‚ÄúYou think she hit her head or something?‚Äù They are all confused with her. Why? She doesn‚Äôt understand. Aren‚Äôt they all close? Practically a family! 

‚ÄúYou remember telling me to make my babies for you? You know, after killing my parents and kidnapping me?‚Äù Mei asks, with more and more of the Rikiyas‚Äô in front of her having an unfamiliar look of confusion on their faces. ‚ÄúI have some just for you! Look here, it‚Äôs the Detnerat‚Äôs Special Baby Number Seventeen!‚Äù 

Gadget blinks, unloading his dimensional storage. Inside of it are a few hundreds of Mei‚Äôs inventions. Including the Detnerat‚Äôs Specials. This time the dog obediently brings out Number Seventeen. Like all other Specials, her mom instructed her how to make it. Probably. Her mind is a bit cloudy when it comes to things like it. 

‚ÄúLet me introduce‚Ä¶‚Äù Mei smiles cheerfully. ‚ÄúWhite Phosphorus Anti-Personnel Missile Launcher!‚Äù 

They react a second too late. What follows is fire and pain. When it ends, Mei continues walking through the forest, humming to herself and thinking about what other baby she‚Äôll get to show the world tonight. She has so many wonderful things stored in Gadget! Including thirty nine more Detnerat Specials‚Äô that she just HAS to show to Rikiya-san! 
Notes:

    Let's go chronologically through that, alright?

    1. Zealot's Gear Five made him reach 40-50% of All Might's strength. Here he discovered that he could go further (feel free to guess how many percent it gave him), only when he understood that he wasn't going to survive that battle yet still stood his ground to save people. An act so manly (and rather unexpected, the idea for this scene came to me like two chapters ago) that it made his every alternative version in every alternative installment of the series realize their wish of (eventually, sometimes it takes them a while to get there) becoming pro heroes.

    [and just so we're clear, his quirk is incredibly powerful but, also, balanced. He can't do shit to ambushes, and if he didn't hear about you committing heinous crimes, he can only employ a fraction of his strength. What's more, that's a transformative quirk, so unlike One for All normally (so not in damaged All Might's body), he can maintain his powered-up state only for some time, his 15-minute last stand was probably him reaching his time limit or getting pretty close to it. What's more, he lacks One for All's resistance to 'death touch' quirks (although this is something that'll be explored much later)]

    2. I don't like Magne. Like, seriously. Her literally only appeal to the masses is that she is transsexual, she doesn't have enough screentime to gain popularity any other way. Her first appearance in canon has her beat up a bunch of kids and their teacher, which she is clearly enjoying. Hell, one of these teachers is transsexual (Tiger). And guess what? Despite his borderline cross-dressing hero outfit, despite being a part of a hero team (something that's apparently not very popular in-universe), he managed to become (well, as a group) Number 32 hero. More than that, he is teaching a bunch of children on a semi-regular basis and absolutely no one bats an eye on that. Yet somehow Magne is often glorified in fanfics, while Tiger is completely ignored.

    So sorry. The transsexuals are clearly accepted in canon Japan. Magne and her unnamed friend's problem isn't their transsexuality, it's the fact that they are violent thugs. #TeamTiger here, people. Especially as considering the possibility that quirks affect their holders' personality, she might not even have gender dysphoria and instead have a defect in her gender-oriented quirk.

    Muscular and Moonfish also had some rather bad match-up quirkwise against Stain. The former because he is a brawler who is casual with getting hit and there are blood vessels in muscles, the latter because his teeth-blades aren't precise enough to stop small projectiles. Hence, Stain bulldozing through all three of them, while shocked heroes are staring. Although whether their participation in the plot is truly over remains to be seen.

    3. Gremlin is a complicated case. In at least one not really written (okay, 13 chapters but they are going to be rewritten grounds up, also it's All That's Left) fanfic connected to this she has an undiagnosed Class-Six quirk practically flooding her brain with engineering and scientific ideas whenever she wants to construct something (while also making her slightly unstable and prone to having to finish constructing said something to clear her mind properly and allow her to function), with her eyes being actually cybernetic implant made to conceal that fact by pretending to be her quirk.

    Whether it's like this here (I mean, Izuku has no real reason to use All for One-the-quirk to inspect one of his friends) is anyone's guess. I'm leaving that to your headcanons.

    Still, you finally get to witness one of her dreaded episodes.

    Canon Mei: Geneva Convention? What's that?
    Cure to Evil Mei: Geneva Convention? More like Geneva Suggestion.
    Cure to Evil Mei [during the episode]: *looks through the list of Geneva Convention bans for inspiration*

Chapter 30: Training Camp [Part Two]
Summary:

    The plot earthquake continues. And is mostly concluded, at least for now.

Chapter Text

‚ÄúI attempted to contact Gremlin.‚Äù Nedzu informs him through the comms. ‚ÄúBut she called me ‚ÄòRikiya-san‚Äô and I‚Äôm not sure if she heard what I said. Any idea...‚Äù 

Izuku goes pale. 

‚ÄúOh fuck, keep everyone away from her.‚Äù Mei chose the absolutely worst moment to have another of her episodes. And‚Ä¶ oh god, she had Gadget with her?! ‚ÄúShe will attack everything that moves and is remotely humanoid, and with extreme prejudice.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI noticed the extreme prejudice part.‚Äù Nedzu states flatly. ‚ÄúShe just used what looks like white phosphorus to burn an entire squad of QLF troops to death.‚Äù Izuku flinches at the image. ‚ÄúAnd now‚Ä¶ oh dear, is that a chainsaw?‚Äù

Izuku doesn‚Äôt want to know. He so much doesn‚Äôt want to know. 

Nedzu moved a drone above his head. Legion has a good internet connection, now. He connects to Mindscrew and sees him observe a squad of QLF soldiers from some bushes. 

He wants to talk with him, but he isn‚Äôt going to deconcentrate him right now. So he watches for a few seconds. Just enough to see the wonderful spectacle of one of the soldiers borrowing grenades from another, only to drop them on the ground and disappear into the woods. 

Grenades explode. Izuku found his missing girlfriend. Mindscrew emerges from the woods and shoots two dazed survivors. The last one has enough time to start fleeing before running into Spinner who promptly stabs him in the chest and then shoots him in the face with a pistol. 

Hitoshi really grew up recently. Spinner too. Izuku is proud of them.

‚ÄúToshi, we have a problem.‚Äù He decides to speak. Mindscrew jerks a little.

‚ÄúAside from the obvious?‚Äù Hitoshi replies. ‚ÄúI have a list of problems. Twenty pages, and then you get to the B-letter.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHow about ‚ÄòHatsume Mei has an episode while having her entire arsenal with her‚Äô? A problem enough?‚Äù Izuku says, and Mindscrew freezes. Vampire emerges from the woods on the other side of the ambushed squad, still wearing the soldier's face, and looks at him questioningly. 

‚ÄúJesus fucking Christ.‚Äù Hitoshi replies after a few seconds. ‚ÄúHow bad is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúAccording to Nedzu it includes white phosphorus and chainsaws.‚Äù He lets Hitoshi swallow the news for a few seconds before continuing. ‚ÄúI need you to incapacitate her with your quirk and prep her for evac. She is to your northwest, and you seem to be close to her.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou owe me for that.‚Äù Mindscrew replies coldly. 

One thing off the list. Then he gets an idea. That he is tired of being lost in the forest. 

‚ÄúKurogiri, I need a lift to the field hospital.‚Äù He says into his mask. The warpgate opens less than a minute later.

 

***

 

He steps from the warpgate to see an image of chaos. Dozens of wounded people scattered around the area. It‚Äôs a ‚Äòfield‚Äô hospital, so it‚Äôs more of a large tent than anything else. It‚Äôs clearly overcrowded - nobody expected so many people with such grizzly wounds. 

Recovery Girl is there, operating on a student. He sees some gen eds and a handful of subcontracted doctors and nurses doing their best. And a line of covered and unmoving people by the wall. 

Most of the corpses are still scattered around the forest. The ones here are those who made it to the hospital but far too late for it to change anything. He can‚Äôt help the others, but he can help those. 

Some of the personnel members are eyeing him. He isn‚Äôt surprised. Recovery Girl is too busy to care about being surprised. 

‚ÄúHow many?‚Äù She asks without pausing the operation for even a second. 

‚ÄúNot enough.‚Äù He replies honestly. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm going to do my best.‚Äù 

He touches the first of the dead students and activates Overhaul.

 

***

 

The preparations for the switch from Maximum to Minimum plans were ready. Faculty and students were still scattered, although their forces in the west amassed enough to begin to push against the PLF‚Äôs main force with increasing strength. 

All Might was advancing towards the main force from the north, decimating the squads that were hunting for the remaining students in the area. Lemillion has been located with Sir Nighteye and some of the third years, advancing towards the very same place, but from the south. 

Right according to the plan. Save for Legion being still hidden from him, but if Overhaul knows anything about that boy, he will pop up when he understands what Minimum Plan is about. 

‚ÄúDeploy the High Ends.‚Äù Overhaul announces. ‚ÄúWarper, get ready.‚Äù He would have to get his hands dirty for this one, in the worst case scenario. ‚ÄúArtillery, fire on the field hospital.‚Äù 

 

***

 

One of Gremlin‚Äôs drones has an eye on the PLF‚Äôs main force surrounding the training field. It immediately reports the change. Several self-propelled guns are warped in, turning to face north. 

Five Noumus move north. One moves south. Then Nedzu hears the worst. Enemy artillery is shelling the field hospital. Cementoss is there, exhausted and wounded in the siege of Nedzu‚Äôs fortress, and he manages to erect a cover, but he won‚Äôt hold it for long. 

All Might abandons moderation and storms towards the artillery position after telling the kids to retreat north. They do not listen. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúOh shit.‚Äù Legion reacts to the announcement. He has already restored nine people to life, and he is in urgent need of a nap. Or Overhaul‚Äôs special trigger. Though he already used it, so trying it again would probably not help at all. ‚ÄúLemillion and All Might. He is after One for All.‚Äù 

Only a single Noumu against Lemillion? The man who proved to have an atomic fist and has most likely grown in strength since then? He hopes that All Might will make it on his own. He should have. 

‚ÄúKurogiri, warp to Lemillion‚Äôs position. Now!‚Äù He shouts and disappears from the hospital. He had no one else to save there, either way. The rest was too far gone. 

 

***

 

Noumu is a massive hulking beast, with an exposed brain and a large beak. Wearing some form of ruined trousers. 

Legion emerges from the cloud of darkness ten meters away from Lemillion. He is beaten up quite badly, but his limbs are (still) intact. Izuku immediately recognizes the two other members of the UA Big Three (he is having a broken hand, she was shot in the shoulder and has it bandaged, but is clearly barely able to fight). 

Sir Nighteye is there too. He is bleeding from a nasty gash on his forehead, and something has nastily mangled his right arm. He has his hyper density seals in the remaining hand. 

‚ÄúLegion?‚Äù Lemillion seems to be torn between being angry and happy to see him. ‚ÄúHere to lend us a hand?‚Äù Happy wins.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not letting my soon-to-be nemesis die not by my hand.‚Äù  Legion replies with a slightly tired-sounding snicker. The Noumu is advancing slowly, but carefully. Something in his movements seem odd. Is it‚Ä¶ oh. 

Overhaul expected the Legion to intervene. So he told noumu to kill him if he did, but he didn‚Äôt specify the priority, so the noumu in front of them is torn between targeting Lemillion and Legion. 

Mistake. He isn‚Äôt sure how to exploit it, but it‚Äôs a mistake nonetheless. 

‚ÄúShock Absorption or Nullification.‚Äù Sir Nighteye says instantly. He knows the situation is critical and doesn‚Äôt want to waste time. He is a strategist and investigator, not a tactician. ‚ÄúProbably some form of regeneration, but I can‚Äôt tell how strong. Also speed and strength boost.‚Äù 

Everyone but Legion had various qualities of physical attacks only. Not enough to fight their way through Shock Absorption, and certainly a lost cause if it was Nullification. Legion could disassemble it with Overhaul, but if it was some form of Hyper Regeneration, he would be exhausted with that before the noumu. 

Okay, plan B. Take advantage of something that Overhaul doesn‚Äôt know. After all, Izuku discovered that he had All for One after killing him. Did the Doctor tell him? How much info did they share? 

‚ÄúWe need to restrain it for up to a minute.‚Äù Izuku says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to steal Shock Absorption, then Lemillion will punch it out.‚Äù Nejire and Tamaki are clearly lost in the first half of the sentence. Sir is unreadable. Lemillion nods.  Noumu decides to finish its thinking process and leaps at Mirio. ‚ÄúKurogiri, now!‚Äù 

Kurogiri acts fast. His warpgate envelops both fists of the Noumu, sending them elsewhere. Lemillion disappears underground, only for his hands to grab Noumu‚Äôs legs and pull them partially underground, sealing its movement. 

Legion leaps forward, crossing the distance and putting his hand on Noumu‚Äôs head. The red electricity flashes. He locates the right quirk (it‚Äôs Shock Nullification, where did that asshole doctor find it?!) and starts pulling. 

Noumu is powerful, but its mind is too damaged to offer significant resistance. But it will still take a while, and Lemillion can‚Äôt stay underground forever. Izuku pulls as fast as he can. The quirk is getting closer and closer, but‚Ä¶ 

Noumu frees its right hand from Kurogiri‚Äôs grip. Izuku has two seconds to say goodbye to his life before a cluster of tentacles grabs the fist mid-flight. The impetus is lost, but noumu struggles onward. Sir Nighteye shows up from nowhere and grabs the hand. Nejire is there too. They buy Izuku precious few seconds, but it is enough. 

He steals the quirk in time, and jumps back before the noumu‚Äôs hand can catch him.

‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS DONE!‚Äù He shouts. Sir jumps back too, pulling Nejire back to safety. The noumu shakes off Suneater‚Äôs tentacles. Lemillion doesn‚Äôt know what happened, but he reaches his limit and jumps from the underground, his fist ready. 

The punch creates a shockwave strong enough to send Izuku flying. Noumu has much less luck. His upper half practically vanishes. The regeneration starts restoring the lost body part, but the heroes don‚Äôt give it time to get anywhere. Nejire and Lemillion tear it into pieces with their attacks. The regeneration gets slower and slower until it stops. 

(somewhere else an exhausted hero gets his arm disassembled while the students are forced to watch. The blood gushes from the open wound.

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù Overhaul hisses. ‚ÄúExhausting you cost me five High Ends, but at least I did what All for One failed to do. Ah, the things you do to impress your allies.‚Äù 

His warper gets him out of the battlefield before anyone has time to react. He can‚Äôt risk Kurogiri warping in and blocking his escape route, and his quirk exhaustion is settling in hard)

‚ÄúWe won!‚Äù Lemillion is clearly on the verge of falling to the ground from exhaustion. ‚ÄúThat was‚Ä¶ something.‚Äù Nejire and Tamaki agree with him, but wordlessly. Izuku has no idea how many fights he missed, but they clearly were at the thick of it. 

‚ÄúOh no.‚Äù Izuku says. He can feel terror replacing post-battle happiness. ‚ÄúAll Might. Overhaul sent five noumus after him.‚Äù Sir Nighteye freezes. Lemillion looks at Izuku with dawning shock. ‚ÄúKurogiri!‚Äù The warpgate envelops them all. 

 

***

All Might is dying. 

He is kneeling on the ruined battlefield. Crushed and destroyed bodies of the High Ends are scattered around. His right arm is missing. His form is steadily deflating, as the remnants of his power - and his blood - are leaving his body. 

Several terrified and (mostly) wounded students are trying to stop the bleeding. It doesn‚Äôt seem to be working. 

Legion, Sir Nighteye, Kurogiri and the Big Three emerge out of nowhere. Sir and Lemillion rush towards All Might. 

‚ÄúRecovery Girl, now.‚Äù Izuku says, his brain still failing to process what‚Äôs in front of him. He can‚Äôt name it. The words to describe the scene fail to come through.

Kurogiri returns a few seconds later with Recovery Girl. Her outfit is stained with fresh blood. Her eyes widen when she sees All Might. Then her expression darkens. 

‚ÄúNothing I can do can save him.‚Äù She is crestfallen. ‚ÄúNot in this state.‚Äù 

Sir Nighteye and Mirio look at Legion. They don‚Äôt say a word, but he knows. 

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt.‚Äù He replies. ‚ÄúI used Overhaul too many times, I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù 

No. 

He won‚Äôt let All Might die. 

He is a hero. The greatest of them all. Powerful and good enough for the son of his greatest enemy to acknowledge him. He is the Symbol of Peace. He is Mirio‚Äôs mentor - and without him, who is going to make sure that Lemillion will not stray from his path? Who will make sure that the second Symbol of Evil will have a worthy antithesis? 

‚ÄúKeep him alive for five more minutes.‚Äù He says to the Recovery Girl. Something, is that hope?, flashes in her eyes. She runs towards All Might as fast as her legs allow her.  ‚ÄúKurogiri, my sister. Now.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mean‚Ä¶‚Äù The warper is shocked. It‚Äôs hard to tell without the face, but Izuku knows. 

‚ÄúNOW!‚Äù Izuku shouts at him and Kurogiri vanishes. 

The students, including Bakugou (oh, the irony) stare at him. There is a mix of hostility and hope in their eyes. 

‚ÄúNedzu.‚Äù Legion says to the communicator. ‚ÄúAll Might is dying. I need Eraserhead here as fast as possible. Kurogiri will pick him up, but I need coordinates.‚Äù 

He gets them almost instantly. He sends them to Kurogiri, telling him to fetch Eraserhead when he returns with Eri. 

Izuku takes off his mask and the hood. Kurogiri bursts out from nowhere, with a sleepy-looking Eri in her favourite All Might onesie. The warper disappears again.

‚ÄúIzu-nichan?‚Äù She says sleepily. He kneels before her and grabs her little hands. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI know that I told you that you‚Äôll never have to use your quirk if you don‚Äôt want to.‚Äù Izuku says quietly but confidently. ‚ÄúBut I need to ask you to do it right now.‚Äù 

This wakes her up. She looks around, and sees the dying All Might. She recognizes the clothes. She sees him slowly deflate, and she is smart enough to understand that it was him. Her eyes widen in terror. 

‚ÄúIzu-nichan, that‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Äù She says, but he interrupts her. 

‚ÄúEri.‚Äù She looks back at him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs All Might. He is dying, and you are the only one who can save him. It was Overhaul, Eri.‚Äù Her face turns pale. Izuku hates himself for having to resurrect her nightmare. ‚ÄúAll Might fought to protect children like you and saved dozens of them, but Overhaul got him.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶‚Äù She stutters. Kurogiri warps back with Eraserhead. The man is visibly exhausted and has half of his head bandaged. One eye remains, and Izuku can see it darting towards the fallen All Might. And then back to an unfamiliar child. 

‚ÄúDo you remember what I told you about your quirk?‚Äù She remains shocked, but he has her attention. ‚ÄúI told you that he lied about it. I told you that it‚Äôs a beautiful thing that can save hundreds of people. That can help people like you, who were wounded by people like Overhaul. You can start right now, Eri. Please, help me save him.‚Äù 

She comes to a decision. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it.‚Äù He was never as proud of her as he was right now. For as much as All for One and Mischief were supervillains, at least one of their children was an unquestionable hero. 

She approaches All Might. Her horn grows larger. 

‚ÄúEveryone, move away from them!‚Äù Izuku shouts, and the crowd surrounding All Might disperses. ‚ÄúEraserhead, use your quirk on her when I tell you.‚Äù Eraserhead nods without a word. 

Izuku walks behind his sister. Just in the right distance to grab her when she finishes, but not close enough to get hit by her quirk. 

All Might is still conscious, but barely. His eyes rest on Eri, his form almost entirely deflated. He doesn‚Äôt have strength left to speak or move. His breath is faltering. The blood drips out of the wound. He is still kneeling there. 

Eri gets close, touches his remaining hand and activates her quirk. Then there is light, not bright enough for everyone around to get blinded by it. There is buzzing, a constant vibration upon everything in the vicinity. 

The light envelops Eri. Second later All Might freezes, as similar light envelops him. 

Izuku hears a gasp when All Might‚Äôs other arm is suddenly reattached to his body. He has no idea who was the source of it. Perhaps Sir Nighteye, maybe Recovery Girl. Maybe it was Izuku himself. 

The body blinks quickly between deflated and inflated forms. Very quickly. Eri‚Äôs quirk rewinds the body in front of her for years. Several. When the blinking stops and the body remains bulky, Izuku decides that it‚Äôs enough. 

‚ÄúNow!‚Äù Eraserhead‚Äôs eye turns red. The light vanishes and the horn shrinks. Eri is about to fall to the ground when Izuku grabs her. She is unconscious, or perhaps has fallen asleep from quirk exhaustion. But she is breathing steadily. 

‚ÄúKurogiri, we‚Äôre leaving.‚Äù The warper doesn‚Äôt ask questions. They all disappear. Behind them, All Might‚Äôs eyes open up and he takes a deep breath‚Ä¶ with two of his lungs for the first time in years. 

 

***

 

Kurogiri has recovered all members of the League. He was still trying to help them bandage their wounds when Izuku decided to put an end to it and directly ordered him to go rest a bit. He was on the verge of falling to quirk exhaustion, and it was rather obvious. 

‚ÄúDid we lose anyone? Izuku is lying on the couch, barely having enough strength to raise his head. He was still running on pure adrenaline when he got his sister back home and (once she woke up) explained to her to keep that night a secret from their parents. 

‚ÄúZealot.‚Äù Mindscrew replies. He is one of the very few members of the League that aren‚Äôt to some degree wounded. He is sitting in an armchair, obviously drained. Still in his villain outfit, he was too tired to take it off before resting for a bit. ‚ÄúTook out like a hundred noumus, but they got him finally.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one awesome death, not gonna lie.‚Äù Spinner mumbles. His hand is bandaged, and the other is set in the cast. Too close to an explosion of something, apparently. 

‚ÄúHe died saving some hero kids.‚Äù Dabi adds. ‚ÄúHe probably died happy.‚Äù Another non-wounded member, but thoroughly exhausted and with his skin badly irritated by the temperature amplitudes that it was exposed to. He spent a while finding a (rather awkward) position on his couch that didn‚Äôt hurt THAT much, and decided to stay like that for as long as possible. 

Stain would have added something, but he was still in an underground hospital. He ran into a High End Noumu, and while he succeeded in slaying it (after some rather extreme duel), he got wounded pretty nastily and almost lost his hand. He was going to spend a week or two there. 

Vampire was sitting on the floor, thoroughly exhausted, but only with some nasty gashes from a noumu that ambushed Mindscrew‚Äôs party. Her sitting position was right next to her boyfriend, of course. 

Gremlin is incapacitated and tied to her bed. Where she PROBABLY shouldn‚Äôt be able to escape from until she wakes up and they manage to confirm that her episode is over. She shouldn‚Äôt be able to cause that much damage with Gadget hidden away from her even if it wasn‚Äôt. 

Tenko has bruised ribs from a noumu‚Äôs punch. He is already playing a video game in the back, his preferred form of chilling down after excess stress. 

Shihai Kuroiro, their no-longer-a-spy in the UA, is in another room. Catching up with Blueberry. There was no point in not evacuating him, as it was rather obvious that Nedzu knew about a spy. Only a matter of time. They lost a good information source, but got back a friend. 

Mustard returned home already. Izuku used the last remnants of his Overhaul quirk today to fix his wounds. He of them all still had a surface life to maintain.  And he suffered them right before the retreat, so Overhaul still worked on him. 

The gas user spent the entire time applying hit & run tactics on the QLF soldiers, gassing a lot of people - Nedzu used him to soften the enemy before heroes rolled in and stomped on whoever was left. He was exhausted, but more or less satisfied.

‚ÄúSo, was it worth it?‚Äù Mindscrew asks finally, once the silence turns awkward. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find out tomorrow.‚Äù Izuku replies sleepily. 

He switches to Life Support quirk just in case before falling asleep. Thankfully it was just exhaustion. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the end result?‚Äù Sir Nighteye asks. Nedzu is obviously the one most aware of the result of the battle. 

They are both sitting in one of the room‚Äôs in the fortress. The ruckus outside is still going - helicopters come and go, carrying more wounded students to the nearest hospitals. Sir Nighteye‚Äôs wounds are mostly patched up, so he has time to interrogate the principal about things. 

It ended half an hour ago. It was, all things considered, inconclusive. Remaining PLF‚Äôs forces retreated eastward, with heroes too weak to pursue them. Overhaul‚Äôs warp quirk user probably picked them up a few kilometers away from the edge of the UA owned area. 

‚ÄúPretty bad.‚Äù Rat replies. It was an understatement of a century, all things considered. ‚ÄúWe lost forty-seven students, Kamui Woods, Midnight and nine other pro-heroes. Gran Torino and two of the Wild Wild Pussycats will probably end up having to retire due to injuries.‚Äù He wasn‚Äôt going to bet on Gran doing that, that old man would probably stay a hero even if he lost all of his limbs. Losing two wasn‚Äôt going to stop him, especially as those were the upper ones.

‚ÄúThe press is going to gobble UA up for this.‚Äù Sir Nighteye replies coldly. ‚ÄúForty-seven dead students, Nedzu.‚Äù 

He is painfully aware of that fact. And there was also the part with how many of them received various degrees of wounds. If anything, aside from the support and gen ed students, most of the survivors were wounded. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll deal with vultures.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúWe were attacked by forces of at least one SSS-Rank villain, most likely two although the noumu-maker lacks the official presence. Including no less than one thousand of their lackeys. I‚Äôm not saying that the fallout won‚Äôt be horrible, but we‚Äôll manage.‚Äù 

Somehow. This wasn‚Äôt going to be a PR hit the same size as what Legion did to the Hero Commission in Hosu, but it was almost as bad. It was going to be ugly. Nedzu was powerful, but not invincible.

At least he ramped up the security several times beforehand. What he did was way overboard, but did give him an option of pointing out that it didn‚Äôt happen because school went too cheap on the security. Giant murderrobots, fortress, artillery battery and so many heroes? Yeah, it was the villains that were so good, not heroes that messed up. 

This was a villain team-up that he had no way of foreseeing. Predicting events like that was a job of the Hero Commission. It failed horribly this time. 

They had ALL MIGHT on the scene, of all people. He isn‚Äôt sure how to spin this up to not make people lose their faith in the Symbol of Peace, but he‚Äôll manage. Somehow. 

They aren‚Äôt sure of exact numbers, but the QLF - well, PLF now - lost no less than three hundred soldiers, twenty-seven tanks and other vehicles, and at least one hundred twenty noumus. Also numerous high ranked villains. The noumu bit was probably a disaster to the enemy forces. 

Probably. Nedzu doesn‚Äôt want to imagine the option that they didn‚Äôt get the overwhelming majority of the noumus available to the Paranormal Liberation Front. 

There were many things to talk about. Many things to change. Nedzu has managed to win a battle, but narrowly. He wasn‚Äôt dumb, quite the opposite. He knew that he won because Legion and the League of Villains intervened. 

For now he had the PR fires to put out. 

(somewhere in Japan, a deadly tired child picks up the phone, only to hear about the death of their mother. The person on the other side misunderstands the wails as born from sadness, rather than from the fact that the boy now has no one left to hate)
Notes:

    Looks like Izuku will have to hide something from his dad too. Also the spy was finally revealed, kudos to those of you who guessed it correctly :v

    Also to the person that questioned why Garaki worked with Overhaul - well, killing All Might (something that Legion clearly wasn't trying to do) was quite a thing to promise.

‚ÄúFirst thing‚Äôs first.‚Äù Nedzu announces once everyone gathers in his office. Gran Torino is missing due to still being in a hospital. There is detective Tsukauchi, Sir Nighteye with his arm bandaged, Eraserhead that has barely recovered from a concussion and still has half of his head under wraps and, finally, Lemillion and All Might. Those two actually feel pretty well, especially the latter, who is eating his first cheeseburger in years. 

The only unexpected addon is the thoroughly tired Recovery Girl. 

‚ÄúNamely, damage control.‚Äù Nedzu concludes. Eraserhead decides to ask the obvious question. 

‚ÄúBefore that, why are we here? In THIS room?‚Äù They knew it was wiretapped, after all. I mean, sure, League did save their collective asses, but it‚Äôs not like they were now all cozy. 

‚ÄúBecause the League has evacuated their spy.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúShihai Kuroiro of class 1-B. The danger has passed, and I‚Äôve made steps that will make him unable to infiltrate us ever again.‚Äù 

That was a new thing. Eraserhead decides to ask further questions. 

‚ÄúThat pitch black kid?‚Äù He remembers him faintly from some joint training. Nedzu nods in an answer. 

‚ÄúI currently believe that he was the contact between the League and their QLF agent in the past.‚Äù Nedzu adds. ‚ÄúHe was the ‚Äòfriend with heroic aspirations that ended up in juvie for assault after saving a quirkless girl from rape‚Äô. Legion forgot to mention that he later on cleared his record and got him to join UA. I planned to make an arrest during the last day of the training camp, but‚Ä¶ alas. Water under the bridge now.‚Äù The rat shrugs. ‚ÄúIt appears that he forgot to mention that his quirk allows him to hide various items, such as microphones, in sufficiently dark places. Like behind the furniture in this room. ‚Äù 

Eraserhead nods. His curiosity is satisfied. Nedzu moves on. 

‚ÄúRecovery Girl?‚Äù The principal turns his head towards the tired woman. 

‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt lost anyone more than my last report. Forty-seven students. Fifteen more have various degrees of permanent damages. The rest should make a full recovery.‚Äù She sighs. ‚ÄúOur counselors will have a lot of work in front of them, though.‚Äù

Being attacked like that, having to fight for their lives and in many cases scoring some kills? Eraserhead doesn‚Äôt look forward to Hound Dog‚Äôs work after all this. Although all of that won‚Äôt start until Hound Dog leaves the hospital. If he leaves the hospital. Doctors were optimistic, but‚Ä¶

UA‚Äôs heroic course had 118 active students. It was now down to 82 (if you included the nine hero students with permanent damages that were going to end their careers). The remaining casualties were from either the gen-ed or support course. 

‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶ All Might?‚Äù Sir Nighteye asks. Recovery Girl looks conflicted for a few seconds. Then she answers.

‚ÄúI believe the girl that Legion brought with him has the world‚Äôs first Class-Six healing quirk.‚Äù Silence in the room. Eraserhead only recently found out that Class-Six quirks existed, although he only knew One for All and All for One. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt conventional healing. All Might‚Äôs body was chronologically rewinded to its physical state before his fight against All for One. He has a small gash on his side that fits the wound he received during his fight against Toxic Chainsaw earlier that year. His mind retained all memories from after that date, however.‚Äù 

Eraserhead‚Äôs headache starts. The implications of the possibilities this quirk opened‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúThere are almost no limits to what it can heal.‚Äù Recovery Girl continues. ‚ÄúGuaranteed perfect recovery for as long as you remain alive until she gets to you. It can even heal old age. Not to mention reset diseases like cancer to an earlier stage, allowing repeated attempts at therapy. If not to just rewind the body to the point before it started.‚Äù She sighs. ‚ÄúI guess this explains why Legion was hiding her from the world so well.‚Äù 

How many people out there would be willing to kill to get someone who could make them immortal? This was a quirk that was a blessing as much as it was a curse. Especially to a girl that was already hurt so much because of it. 

‚ÄúVery well.‚Äù Nedzu officially concludes this part of the talk. Eraserhead really hopes that he won‚Äôt do something stupid with that knowledge. Empathy isn‚Äôt his strong point, but those two DO share the part of being experimented upon due to their quirk. ‚ÄúWhat about your quirk?"

‚ÄúI do not have One for All, that much didn‚Äôt change.‚Äù All Might replies between the bites of the cheeseburger. ‚ÄúBut the remaining energy was recharged fully. It will decrease as time passes, but for now I‚Äôm back to my peak level of strength.‚Äù That was, at least, rather reassuring. All Might in full power was a massive asset. 

‚ÄúNow‚Ä¶ damage control.‚Äù Nedzu says and everyone flinches. The chaos in the media was insane. Principal and the police already sent the full report to the Commission (they, unfortunately, had to) and there were many changes in the villain ranking. ‚ÄúI really need to issue a public statement. My current idea is to try to spin the tale in our favour. Attribute Zealot‚Äôs kills to All Might to restore his image, make it look like League of Villains‚Äô alliance with us was just a ruse to get intel back to the attackers to explain our casualties. With this the blow to the school should be dampened, and...‚Äù Some scarce nods in the room. Eraserhead is horrified. He is about to say something, but someone intervenes first. 

A fist lands on his desk. The sound is loud - and surprising - enough to have Nedzu go silent. And stare in shock at someone who just almost damaged his (very valuable) desk, despite being a student. 

‚ÄúAre you insane?‚Äù Lemillion is standing in front of him, clearly furious. ‚ÄúAre you diagnosed as clinically insane, Principal Nedzu?‚Äù 

‚ÄúMirio‚Ä¶‚Äù Sir Nighteye is mortified. Eraserhead is getting better at reading his face. Although in this case, he is entirely in Lemillion‚Äôs team. As the only person in the room, save for (possibly) unreadable All Might who is still munching on his burger.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm asking because if you are actually insane, then I‚Äôm not in a position to thoroughly laugh and butcher what you just said as some of the dumbest thing I ever heard.‚Äù Lemillion is more furious than Eraserhead imagined was ever possible. Enough to completely ignore his mentor. The underground hero didn‚Äôt think that it was possible. ‚ÄúSo, once again, are you INSANE, principal Nedzu?‚Äù 

Silence. Long and awkward. 

‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm not.‚Äù Nedzu finally replies. His face is unreadable. 

‚ÄúSo let me now explain why what you just said was absolute bullshit.‚Äù Sir Nighteye is horrified by the language used. He is like a doting father that just discovered that his eighteen years old ‚Äòbaby girl‚Äô knows what sex is. Eraserhead is vaguely amused by the scene. ‚ÄúDid any of you hear about such a thing as the Second World War?‚Äù 

Unexpected jump of a subject. Eraserhead is more or less aware. History wasn‚Äôt his strong point, but not a weak one either. 

‚ÄúIt was a pre-quirk war.‚Äù Lemillion doesn‚Äôt wait for the answer. ‚ÄúHorrible loss of life, with some estimating that more than sixty million people died. Do you want to know why it started?‚Äù Another rhetorical question. He isn‚Äôt waiting for an answer before continuing on. ‚ÄúIt started because the First World War was so horrible, that no one, absolutely no one was ready to acknowledge that the second one had already started. The victorious powers of the First World War let a genocidal maniac devour two European countries without a single shot fired, letting him build up his strength and popular support, because they preferred it to admitting that they are waging and losing a war.‚Äù 

Eraserhead understands what Lemillion is going to say. Huh. High time for someone to say it openly. Perhaps they will listen to an One for All holder. Eraserhead is too young (apparently) and not a veteran of their war against All for One, so they would probably ignore him. Lemillion is even younger, but he has That quirk, so...

Go get them, Lemillion. 

‚ÄúThis is what you are doing right now, but even worse.‚Äù Lemillion continues. ‚ÄúFor months I keep hearing stuff like ‚Äòoh, at least he isn‚Äôt All for One‚Äô, or ‚Äòplease just not another war, I‚Äôm so tired of the last one‚Äô.‚Äù The latter sentence is done with an impression resembling Detective Tsukauchi. Who, promptly, freezes, with an expression on his face that makes Eraserhead laugh internally. ‚ÄúWell, newsflash. The second war has already started in Hosu, and yesterday we almost lost it.‚Äù 

He pauses for a few seconds. Nedzu is about to open his mouth, but Lemillion interrupts him before the first word comes out. 

‚ÄúWhen you were fighting against All for One‚Ä¶ Do you remember your War Council, Nedzu?‚Äù The rat freezes again. ‚ÄúMonthly meetings of influential heroes whom you and All Might trusted enough to believe that All for One didn‚Äôt buy them. Exchange of ideas and information, ways of understanding a bigger picture of the villain operations in the country. Well, back then All for One ruled the villains from shadows while being able to transfer quirks and killed a lot of people in nasty ways. For weeks the QLF has been destroying entire cities and we know since Eclipse‚Äôs death that its leader can transfer quirks. So where is your War Council, Nedzu?‚Äù 

Silence. You could drop a pin on the ground, and it would deafen everyone involved. 

‚ÄúAll for One had problems amassing fifteen notable villains for an operation without you or Sir catching wind that something is brewing.‚Äù Lemillion continues. ‚ÄúParanormal Liberation Front is moving around five thousand soldiers, dozens of tanks and self propelled guns, and hundreds of bio-engineered monsters. How‚Äôs that NOT a war? You could conquer a small country openly with an army like that!‚Äù 

Eraserhead caught himself nodding slightly. 

‚ÄúYou won the first war, great.‚Äù Lemillion tries not to sound sarcastic, but fails. It‚Äôs almost hilarious considering how his face is always so optimistic. Like a second coming of All Might, really. Now he looks more like Eraserhead on a bad day. ‚ÄúBut now we‚Äôre being attacked by another enemy, one to equal if not surpass the old one, while being in the middle of the civil war against the Hero Commission. I came here, hoping for some source of optimism after the worst night in my life. Some grand plan, some lead to capture Overhaul and stop him from killing more people. Instead I hear Nedzu saying that he wants to start a war with one of our few remaining potential allies to‚Ä¶ what exactly? To make himself look better in the media than the HPSC?‚Äù He leans forward over the desk, making Nedzu shrink in his chair. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is wrong with you, Nedzu?‚Äù He leans back and looks around the room. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is wrong with you all for me, a student, to be the only person to call Nedzu out on that?‚Äù

And now the kid started to sound like Eraserhead after he caught Nedzu using Stain as a problem solver. Oh joy. Another problem child to look at with a mix of worry and pride. If Lemillion is to become the next Symbol of Peace, then‚Ä¶ Eraserhead looks forward to seeing it. 

‚ÄúNot the only person.‚Äù Eraserhead decides to interrupt the silence. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm with you on that, Mirio.‚Äù Some of the eyes in the room turn towards him. ‚ÄúKeep chewing them up, kid. Time for someone to talk some sense into them.‚Äù 

All Might says nothing. Just nods. Looks like Eraserhead isn‚Äôt the only one on it. 

‚ÄúMirio, I understand that Legion fought alongside you, but‚Ä¶‚Äù Nedzu still doesn‚Äôt get the hint. He is smart, but his understanding of social cues and emotions is sometimes‚Ä¶ painfully lacking. And there are cases - like this one - when he is having issues with understanding a new situation, and will stick to an old mindset. Like the oldest, most conservative person you can think about. 

‚ÄúNedzu, for god‚Äôs sake, take your head out of your ass and listen to what I‚Äôm saying!‚Äù Lemillion is clearly on fire, and Eraserhead hopes that there is some wiretapping left. Would Legion hand him a copy of a recording of that talk? Sir in the meantime appears to be approaching a heart attack. ‚ÄúWe need the League more than it needs us. Can you finally understand that one thing?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNow you‚Äôre overreacting‚Ä¶‚Äù Nedzu is stubborn. Probably infuriated by the indication of him having a hateboner against Hero Commission and being too single-minded about it. Despite having a hateboner against it AND being too single-minded about that. 

‚ÄúHe is right.‚Äù All Might finally speaks. Sir looks at him with more shock than horror for the first time in a while. ‚ÄúWhat would have happened if Legion didn‚Äôt intervene in this battle? Without Gremlin restoring our communications, the entire UA would be wiped out. We would have lost the Symbol of Peace, the One for All alongside of its bearer, three years worth of prospective heroes, numerous pro heroes, and both Nedzu and Sir Nighteye, our main strategists. Without Legion, Overhaul would achieve what All for One never did - he would have WON. In the span of a single night. Then he would just have to finish the Hero Commission and voila. In three weeks from now on he would be fighting Re-Destro over who gets to inherit the entire country.‚Äù 

He lets this image float in the room for a few seconds. Enough for various emotions to settle in. Sir is either incapable of saying no to All Might or finally started to think about what Mirio said. Nedzu is still in his personal cuckooland. Detective Tsukauchi is‚Ä¶ hard to read. 

‚ÄúLegion has saved our asses.‚Äù Mirio picks up where he left. ‚ÄúMore than that. While we were hiding out from the world before the training camp, hoping that no one is going to attack us again and that Overhaul would just stay in hiding indefinitely, he actually dismantled QLF‚Äôs entire popular support.‚Äù Nedzu opens his mouth again, but Lemillion once again doesn‚Äôt let him. ‚ÄúStop. Did you even watch Sunset‚Äôs manifest? VIllainy but with ethics and attacks against relatively valid targets, like what Legion does. All directed by Mr. Compress, personally a great fan of Legion‚Äôs mother AND head of the Levellers. Whom Legion worked with before, if Gentle Criminal‚Äôs presence during the USJ attack is any indication. Is it really that hard to connect the dots?‚Äù 

Nedzu closes his mouth. Eraserhead whistles quietly. He did have some suspicions, but if Lemillion got the same idea, then it just confirmed his thoughts. Sir and Tsukauchi appear fascinated and surprised by the connection. The underground hero is just slightly disappointed in them for not suspecting it earlier. 

‚ÄúAnd now you want to declare de facto war against Legion to improve your public approval rating?‚Äù Lemillion looks almost insulted by the idea. ‚ÄúWe might hate that fact. I certainly do. But we NEED him. Because League is the only group that can get at least some heat off us and occupy Overhaul‚Äôs attention until we get back to the combat shape that we heroes had during the war against All for One. And do you know why Legion is even assisting us at all? Because he thinks that we are trustworthy. Because he thinks that we are heroes honest to the meaning of the word. And you want to use the UA‚Äôs entire authority to publically shit on him and one of his friends that died saving YOUR students by claiming that he was a villain there to kill them all?‚Äù There is silence in the room. ‚ÄúDid you try to think for a second what Legion would do after seeing you on the TV saying things like that? Because while I can‚Äôt claim that I know him, I‚Äôm almost certain that none of us will like the result.‚Äù 

Eraserhead doesn‚Äôt like to think about it, either. But he is certain that Lemillion is right. Legion would be absolutely furious. Especially after his friend‚Äôs death - League was no standard ‚Äòbusiness first‚Äô villain crew. It was more like a family. Dysfunctional, but loving. Legion would probably be alright with one of them being arrested (he would try to break them out, but he wouldn‚Äôt hold a grudge if that failed). But a family member dying to save UA students, and Nedzu then publicly shaming the person in question for that...

Considering the fact that all Legion needs to damage UA seriously is get Stain an interview about how Principal Nedzu set him against his enemies, the results of the UA versus League of Villains war would be nasty. And not to the League. At least in the short term.

Lemillion quietly returns to his chair, and sits there. His face clouded and furious. Nedzu keeps deflating in his chair. Finally he speaks. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll‚Ä¶ rewrite my public statement.‚Äù Nedzu says. ‚ÄúTaking into account what was just said. Thank you for bringing it into my attention, Mirio.‚Äù He is thoroughly destroyed. His mind has probably finally unpacked what was said, making him understand just how close was he to committing an elaborate form of public suicide. 

‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll add that‚Ä¶‚Äù Sir sighs loudly. ‚ÄúWe should reform the war council. There are still some members of the past one in active duty, and there are many recently emerged notable agencies to invite to it. Mirio is right on all issues he talked about. Including the part that there‚Äôs just no way that no one noticed any signs of Overhaul amassing his forces, even with warp quirk taken into account. But the team-ups between agencies grew thin in numbers in the past few years, and with the Commission hounding the reports from their agencies‚Ä¶ we simply missed the warning signs.‚Äù

Tsukauchi nods. He is‚Ä¶ tired. Not as much as Nedzu is, but he certainly will need some time to get over it. Recovery Girl says nothing. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an excellent idea, Mirai.‚Äù All Might comments. Nedzu nods faintly. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll ask the Vigilante Alliance and the underground hero network if they want to join officially or semi-officially.‚Äù Eraserhead decides to add. ‚ÄúThey have information networks to match Legion‚Äôs, but are operating practically independently from the surface heroes. There is a fair chance that they noticed some things concerning Overhaul‚Äôs operations, but simply failed to put it in the proper context.‚Äù 

Time to talk about the actual damage control. And about Midnight‚Äôs funeral. 

 

***

 

Mirio Togata: I just paid back my debt to you for saving my and my friends‚Äô asses from that Noumu.

Mirio Togata: So don‚Äôt expect to have me do anything for you in exchange for that. I don‚Äôt like being in debt to a villain. 

Akatani Mikumo: ?

Mirio Togata: Nedzu had one of his ‚ÄòI Don‚Äôt Understand Humans‚Äô brain aneurysms. 

Mirio Togata: He was about to pin the blame about the attack on the League. I talked him out of it. With All Might and Eraserhead. 

Akatani Mikumo: holy fucking shit

Akatani Mikumo: I was afraid he would try to pull shit like that

Akatani Mikumo: thank you

Mirio Togata: Try to influence me slightly less, alright? 

Mirio Togata: i feel like I‚Äôm falling into a bad crowd

Mirio Togata: three years of being an exemplar student and here I am,

Mirio Togata: telling the principal to take his head out of his ass and listen to me

Mirio Togata: to his face in his office, with several teachers and my two mentors listening

Mirio Togata: sigh

Akatani Mikumo: oh

Akatani Mikumo: my

Akatani Mikumo: god

Akatani Mikumo: that had to be hilarious to watch

Mirio Togata: well eraserhead did look like christmas came earlier sooo

Mirio Togata: maybe?

Akatani Mikumo: xD 

Mirio Togata: I‚Äôm going to be a hero. And I‚Äôm going to save a million people with a smile. That doesn‚Äôt change and will not change.

Mirio Togata: But knowing you DOES give me some perspective. Watching news and figuring out what a mess this country is did expand the perspective too. 

Mirio Togata: still arresting you and putting you behind the bars for numerous cases of murder and villainy, for the record

Akatani Mikumo: awesome!

Mirio Togata: how‚Äôre you holding? I mean, about Zealot

Akatani Mikumo: it hurts, but‚Ä¶ he always wanted to be a hero

Akatani Mikumo: couldn‚Äôt, due to his background, but

Akatani Mikumo: he was probably happy that he at least died as one

Akatani Mikumo: saving people 

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôm still getting my promise to him fulfilled, though

Mirio Togata: promise?

Akatani Mikumo: I promised to stop Purity and the CRC from hurting innocent people.

Akatani Mikumo: Zealot might have died, but my promise to him still lives. 

Mirio Togata: if you find two bases of the CRC, tell me about one. I‚Äôll arrest everyone inside in his memory. He killed 94 noumus before dying, can you believe that? This was practically All Might at-the-peak level of power.

Akatani Mikumo: 94? holy shit, I thought that Mindscrew was joking with his ‚Äòlike a hundred‚Äô

Akatani Mikumo: he must have had another level of his quirk entirely, that he only activated when he understood that it‚Äôs his last battle but still marched into it willingly to save people.

Akatani Mikumo: fascinating

Mirio Togata: so‚Ä¶ righteousness? 

Akatani Mikumo: more like a perception of himself being good and the enemy being evil. 

Akatani Mikumo: the greater the difference, the bigger the power level he could generate

Akatani Mikumo: apparently he depowered almost into quirklessness when he understood that what CRC is doing is evil (and he was a part of it, and actually did some ugly things).

Akatani Mikumo: took him a while to look at himself in the mirror and not hate what he saw

Mirio Togata: that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ an extremely cool quirk

Akatani Mikumo: aye

Akatani Mikumo: how is it on your side?

Mirio Togata: horrible

Mirio Togata: so many people died

Mirio Togata: Gran Torino had his arms massacred by a noumu so much that they had to be amputated

Mirio Togata: Eraserhead will probably lose an eye. 

Mirio Togata: Team Idaten will freeze operations until Tenya Iida graduates because they lost several crucial members (Nedzu will probably hire remaining sidekicks for the meantime until there is Ingenium to lead them)

Mirio Togata: almost everyone I know is more or less wounded

Mirio Togata: we don‚Äôt even have the school counselor because he is still in hospital and has like a 70% chance of making it after putting himself between some students and two Near High End Noumus. 

Mirio Togata: Nedzu is hiring outside help to deal with the fallout, we expect a lot of people to drop out

Mirio Togata: for many of students it was the first time they used their quirks with an intent to kill

Mirio Togata: myself included, to be honest (the punch in Hosu was more of an accident than intentional murder)

Mirio Togata: and they lost one of the teachers too

Akatani Mikumo: which one? 

Mirio Togata: Midnight

Akatani Mikumo: oh fuck

Mirio Togata: ? 

Akatani Mikumo: sorry it‚Äôs really hard to describe and you‚Äôll probably find out sooner or later

Akatani Mikumo: I apologize profusely for doing this but I need to go right now

Akatani Mikumo: we‚Äôll continue the talk tomorrow

Satan 2: You just made a big mistake, good doctor. 

Doctor Evil: Mistake?

Doctor Evil: The only mistake here is you.

Doctor Evil: You are a disgrace. 

Doctor Evil: You spared All Might in the USJ, you saved his successor in Hosu, and now you intervened to stop me from killing them both? 

Doctor Evil: You expected me to take that face down? 

Doctor Evil: What did you plan to do next? Find All for One‚Äôs corpse and piss on it together with All Might? 

Satan 2: Oh no no no, good doctor. 

Satan 2: You do not understand. 

Doctor Evil: Enlighten me then. 

Doctor Evil: I look forward to hearing how saving One for All holders is doing justice to All for One‚Äôs memory. 

Satan 2: Did Overhaul tell you how I killed him? 

Doctor Evil: He doesn‚Äôt have that memory. 

Satan 2: Yes. If he had it, he would know that when I cornered him, I was still quirkless. I didn‚Äôt steal his quirk. My All for One (quirk) was awakened when I got his quirk. From All for One - the person. Three years ago. 

Doctor Evil: What? 

Satan 2: You almost ruined a six years long operation of his. You almost killed his FIRSTBORN SON. The first person in two hundred years to be BORN with All for One‚Äôs quirk (albeit as a late bloomer). His chosen successor and right hand man in his second empire. 

Satan 2: Because you THOUGHT that you know better than my father did. Because you ignored his clear instructions in favour of your private initiative. It‚Äôs called treason, my good doctor. And Midoriyas don't take that lightly.

Satan 2: When I capture you, I‚Äôll drag you back to my father. And then we‚Äôre going to kill you together. Probably alongside Overhaul. We had so much fun killing him together last time, after all! It was a good father and son bonding experience. 

Satan 2: Tell your new boyfriend that Eri‚Äôs new mom is looking forward to tearing his internal organs out of his body with her quirk. She‚Äôll start with the eyes. Then I‚Äôll reset the wounds with his quirk. And probably make a recording of the whole thing, to watch with my friends from the League as a quality entertainment. Maybe I‚Äôll even invite them to figure out some other creative forms of execution? I‚Äôm really looking forward to what Gremlin adds to the list. 

Satan 2: She can do some truly wonderful things with white phosphorus, you know that? Seeing you two choke on it will truly make my day great.

Satan 2: Oh, and tell Overhaul that he wouldn‚Äôt be so cocky if he remembered how he was ready to offer me everything, from Eri through his own eternal servitude to a fucking blowjob just to make the pain stop. I‚Äôve killed him only when he broke so much that he was begging me to kill him. He was so pathetic at this point that there was no fun in torturing him anymore. 

Doctor Evil: You‚Äôre lying! All for One would have never lied to me!

Satan 2: Oh? Is that so? 

Satan 2: Yes, honesty is obviously one of his most defining character traits. He told EVERYTHING to EVERY of his followers, instead of keeping it on a strict need-to-know basis. Yes. Certainly.

Satan 2: If so, then certainly you‚Äôll find no discrepancies in your old records. No surplus medical supplies delivered to you - and then inexplicably vanishing without a trace. Supplies  needed to nurse a person in critical condition for the time between his fight against All Might and original Overhaul‚Äôs death. Supplies that were used by you on my father, before you were made to forget about it with one of his memory tampering quirks. 

Satan 2:  Ask Overhaul what Eri‚Äôs quirk is and think what it could do to my father‚Äôs wounds. 

Satan 2: He knows you rarely checked those records. So he intentionally left discrepancies for me to use as a proof. In case you ever went renegade against me. Check them now. You‚Äôll just love the results. 

Satan 2: Consider comparing my photographs with his and my mom‚Äôs. If you don‚Äôt have a spare vial of my blood somewhere in your lab. Then you can just test me for blood relations with All for One. I wonder what the result of that will be? 

Satan 2: You made the greatest mistake someone in this country - hero or a villain - can do.

Satan 2: You made me hate you. You made my war against you PERSONAL. 

Satan 2: I‚Äôm looking forward to meeting you irl. We‚Äôll have so much fun together, good doctor!

Satan 2: I wonder how you‚Äôll be looking when I steal your quirk?

Psychological warfare was a mean thing to do. But Izuku was capable of it - and he knew how to apply it to Doctor Garaki. It was, honestly, like torture. But for people who didn‚Äôt like to make their hands dirty. If scaring those two assholes was going to make him a priority target to them, then it was a low price to pay - heroes really weren‚Äôt in combat shape, and if Nedzu still failed to find their hideout, then what were the chances of Overhaul locating it?

‚ÄúDid I ever mention that you speaking or writing things like that is the hottest thing ever?‚Äù Himiko asks after looking at the text over his shoulder. He let her do that. He knew she would love it. Her eyes are just a tiny bit dreamy. 

‚ÄúWhat about me while being cute, flustered and shy?‚Äù He asks back, while hiding his phone in his pocket. 

‚ÄúYou are always super hot and super cute, Zuku!‚Äù She replies, not adding ‚Äòsilly!‚Äô, but it was probably implied. ‚ÄúFlustered and shy, commanding and scary, bloodied and tired - you are always the hottest and cutest thing ever! I just like enjoying different flavours of you.‚Äù 

Heh. 

‚ÄúNice one, Himi.‚Äù She beams for praise. He ends her ability to participate in the talk with some quick kiss. Her mind practically melted. 

She was really weak to things like that. 

Now he had to find Mustard before he does something stupid.
Notes:

    Whether the Training Camp will become Overhaul's Pearl Harbor/Operation Barbarossa (to follow up on Second World War comparisons) remains to be seen. But he certainly awakened a giant. Or, to be exact, he awakened a giant because Lemillion went berserk after having a very stressful night and dished some facts.

    Oh, and Lemillion is 100% correct. Especially with Zealot's never fulfilled dreams of heroics. If Nedzu shat on him for his last (and most heroic) moment, Midoriya would go berserk, no doubt about it.

    [also Sunset is now an S-Rank due to being a terrorist organization leader, she was probably scheduled to be an S-Rank even before the Training Camp forced a sudden update to the official ranking, for the record]

Chapter 32: Alliances
Summary:

    Alliances are made. The Clown Uncle finally appears.

Notes:

(See the end of the chapter for notes.)
Chapter Text

Mustard was at home, but as one can expect after what happened, it was crowded. So many people come to say comforting words, no one understanding what that kid was going through. That he mourned his adopted mother because he hated her and now he would never be able to make her realize that. 

Izuku sent him a message, telling him to bear with it and not do anything nasty until they get a moment together to talk. Whether he read it or not was hard to say, but his district wasn‚Äôt randomly enveloped in a poisonous fog, so‚Ä¶ 

In the meantime, he and the League members (mostly patched up) get to watch Nedzu‚Äôs press conference concerning the attack. It was interesting, to say the least. 

Izuku had no idea what Lemillion told Nedzu, but it worked. Nedzu went full truth. The attacks concerning the dead students were repelled with Nedzu pointing out that the school did everything it could to defend them, including deployment of massive death robots, artillery strikes and amassing several times more pro heroes that were to go originally. 

Nedzu also mentioned how it was a debut attack of a newly formed alliance of several major groups of villains, a development that avoided the attention of not only the school, but also police and the Hero Commission. 

The rat decided to be borderline sassy when he pointed out that investigating threats of that level is certainly not his school‚Äôs job, and that he had the training camp prepared for every threat known to the hero society. It wasn‚Äôt UA‚Äôs mistake that the hero society didn‚Äôt know about the formation of the Paranormal Liberation Front.

As an example of ‚Äòpreparation for every known threat‚Äô he described the automatic counter-missile battery built into the fortress that was supposed to shoot down an incoming quirk suppressing missile if the QLF decided to bring one. It was apparently a laser capable of melting the warhead and deactivating its chemical contents safely. He also described the robots. 

Izuku was certain that a lot of people would still complain, but even many media vultures were taken aback by the level of preparations that Nedzu just admitted to. 

Then Nedzu briefly summarized the events of the attack. How PLF took down the hero comms through an usage of currently unknown but probably boosted with trigger quirk, and how majority of the casualties were suffered during the early chaos. How League of Villains intervened (according to Nedzu, because of Legion hating Overhaul for unspecified personal reasons), bringing the communication network back on and allowing Nedzu to organize the defenses and finally repel the attack. Denying the enemy victory (officially, Overhaul attacked the camp to kill All Might and Nedzu, plus kill as many students as possible). 

He even admitted that one of the League of Villains members, Zealot, died while pulling a lone rear guard action against a crowd of enemies, delaying the attack enough for two hero classes (he didn‚Äôt specify which ones) to retreat from an indefensible position and get to safety. 

The talk then shifts into some rather stupid allegations. And it continues on and on. At some point Legion has enough and switches the TV off. 

‚ÄúHoly shit.‚Äù Mindscrew stares at the now blank screen. ‚ÄúDid that one idiot just have an issue with Nedzu telling students to use lethal force while being under attack by a literal fucking army of killers and bioengineered horrors?!‚Äù 

‚ÄúIf they had a brain, they wouldn‚Äôt be part of the media.‚Äù Dabi mumbles from the side. 

‚ÄúWhat about the guy that helped us expose Endeavor?‚Äù Izuku decides to ask. 

‚ÄúException to the rule.‚Äù Dabi says and shrugs. Izuku sometimes wonders if there is any influential and notable social group that Dabi isn‚Äôt dismissive of. Probably villains, but even on this field Izuku isn‚Äôt sure. 

‚ÄúI can barely recognize Nedzu.‚Äù Stain decides to add. He is back from the hospital because of course he is. Even if half of him is bandaged, he wanted to recover at the base. Hospital staff was probably too scared to say no to him. But he was forbidden from exertion for a long while and Izuku was going to enforce that if needed.  ‚ÄúWhat happened to him?‚Äù

‚ÄúLemillion did.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúApparently Nedzu tried to pin the blame for the attack on us, but Lemillion told him to take his head out of his ass and start thinking. Eraserhead and All Might supported him.‚Äù 

Silence. Then Stain speaks. 

‚ÄúCould you please STOP corrupting All Might‚Äôs successor?‚Äù Stain has a very well-defined opinion about ‚Äòtrue heroes‚Äô, and All Might is its definition. He is probably the second biggest fan of Lemillion in this country after Izuku. 

‚ÄúHey, we‚Äôre just playing video games together!‚Äù Izuku replies. Tenko shivers in the background, probably remembering what Lemillion did to him while being the League‚Äôs captive. ‚ÄúAnd talk through the internet.‚Äù  

‚ÄúI vaguely happen to remember being recruited to the League after talking to you through the internet.‚Äù Mindscrew replies with a smirk. He doesn‚Äôt add that it was the only way in which he could talk back then. ‚ÄúYou have no idea how crazily persuasive you can be, simply by accident.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll try to tone it down, sheesh.‚Äù Izuku is slightly irritated. He isn‚Äôt persuasive, he has no idea why Mindscrew claims otherwise. 

Vampire and Vantablack (Shihai decided to keep his hero name after turning to villainy) were out, on a special meeting with Giran about expanding their little spy business. Kurogiri was probably teaching a class. Blueberry was busy with QEM work. The rest was just lazing around.

Mustard, Mirio and Mr. Compress sent him messages almost simultaneously. So much about being bored.

WorldIsAStage: We might be interested in your offer. But this is the sort of thing that has to be talked about face to face. 

SmallMight: Sure. I expected nothing less. This is Serious Business‚Ñ¢.

SmallMight: Send me the meeting place coordinates and the preferred meeting time. 

SmallMight: How many people on both sides?

WorldIsAStage: Me, Gentle Criminal and one more member. You don‚Äôt know him, but I think you‚Äôll like him.

WorldIsAStage: So take two more people on your side. Warper + someone, I believe?

SmallMight: Sure. I‚Äôm a bit busy right now, so send the coords and time, I‚Äôll check back in a while.

Mirio Togata: I have been semi-officially authorized by Sir Nighteye to ask you about the possibility of a temporary (and secret) alliance between the UA and the League of Villains.

Akatani Mikumo: Oh? 

Akatani Mikumo: Sounds like UA finally understood the gravity of the situation and started gearing up for war. 

Mirio Togata: Yes. We start by checking out who is willing to fight alongside us. But I can‚Äôt tell you anything more than that. 

Akatani Mikumo: oh pls, Ms. Joke‚Äôs Underground Hero Network, Knuckleduster‚Äôs Vigilante Alliance, and Miruko‚Äôs Table of Rejects (yes, I know the name, she is surprisingly sneaky but not THAT sneaky). 

Akatani MIkumo: you literally have no one else left to ask but them and me - and I‚Äôm probably Nedzu‚Äôs LAST choice of allies so since you are already asking me...

Mirio Togata: ...

Mirio Togata: stop seeing through me like that

Akatani Mikumo: seeing through heroes is literally my job as a villainous mastermind though

Mirio Togata: sigh

Akatani Mikumo: What are the terms?

Mirio Togata: Information exchange concerning the Paranormal Liberation Front. Non-Aggression Pact - both sides are free to continue investigating each other, for as long as they do not engage in open combat. There might be deals such as ‚Äòwe deal with base A, you with base B‚Äô, but even more unofficial than the general cooperation. And only in truly critical situations. 

Akatani Mikumo: What about our subsidiary groups? Villain Industries for example has barely started operating but it doesn‚Äôt do background checks and there is an option that some of the merchandise will be used against an UA hero somewhere. 

Akatani Mikumo: Plus the QEM isn‚Äôt centralized, and I can‚Äôt guarantee that some of the Sunset‚Äôs lieutenants won‚Äôt have a stupid idea (although chances are low, the bit with quirkless heroes bought you some positive feelings in the QEM).

Mirio Togata: For as long as the Villain Industries does not supply the Paranormal Liberation Front, we‚Äôll ignore its merchandise. But be aware - if we locate VIs or the QEM‚Äôs headquarters, we WILL attack. The truce is between the LoV and UA. And we‚Äôre not helping you in any way or degree if the Hero Commission attacks the LoV. We cannot aggravate our war against them rn. 

Akatani Mikumo: No problem there, I‚Äôm looking forward to working with you! 

Mirio Togata: Plans for the evening stay the same?

Akatani Mikumo: Sorry, I‚Äôm going to be extremely busy. Something came up. Tomorrow is free though.

Mirio Togata: alright

Mustard was living in a decent neighbourhood. One of those suburban areas of semi-identical detached houses with small gardens and nosy neighbours. 

It wasn‚Äôt until nightfall and people who knew Midnight stopped pouring in and out. And he was finally alone. 

Kurogiri dropped Izuku behind the house. He knocked on the door and waited for maybe half a minute before Mustard opened them up. 

‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù It was hard to read the look on his face. 

Izuku obeyed. He ended up on the couch in Mustard‚Äôs living room. Mustard was sitting in the armchair across from him. 

The place looks surprisingly normal and unassuming, despite it being Midnight‚Äôs house. Izuku expected it to be‚Ä¶ somewhat‚Ä¶ lewder? Hard to say what he really expected. Something else, certainly. 

‚ÄúSo, how are you doing?‚Äù Izuku has no idea how to start that talk. What is he supposed to say? ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry that you didn‚Äôt get to kill your adoptive mother‚Äô? Awkward like hell. 

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù Mustard replies, his eyes descending towards the floor. ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ I became a villain to spite her. I killed PEOPLE over that. I was angry, constantly and extremely. But now she‚Äôs dead, she didn‚Äôt even find out what I did, and now I just‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs as if all the anger evaporated. I‚Äôm just empty on the inside, and‚Ä¶‚Äù 

At least Mustard IS talking. Everything is salvageable for as long as you still want to talk about it. When you stop‚Ä¶ well, tough luck. 

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù Izuku sighs. ‚ÄúI actually expected that you would react like that. Listen, I‚Äôm going to tell you some things. Some of them might sound harsh. But please, listen to them. Once I finish speaking, you are free to do whatever you want. Before that though, just listen. Alright?‚Äù 

Mustard nods. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not one to judge people‚Äôs villainous motivations.‚Äù Izuku says. This is going to be a tough talk. ‚ÄúBut I always thought that yours was childish and immature.‚Äù Something on Mustard‚Äôs face flinches, but he continues listening. ‚ÄúDabi hated Endeavor, but spite against him wasn‚Äôt his ONLY motivation. He wanted to see him dead - but he also knew that there are other asshole heroes out there. Endeavor was merely an end-goal of his, one that he achieved way faster than he thought. But when he lost his end-goal, he still had his general goal, taking down the unworthy heroes, to retreat to. You had nothing but Midnight. And this is why you are so lost now.‚Äù

Mustard grits his teeth, but says nothing. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to blame you for wanting to leave the League.‚Äù Izuku continues. That‚Äôs what Mustard talked about during their brief chat through the Villain Network. ‚ÄúFor as long as you do not rat us out to the heroes or other villains, it‚Äôs your decision to make. I‚Äôm not going to go full on my dad and pull a ‚Äòno leaving, now die‚Äô shit. I also will not take the advantage of your villainous past to blackmail you, even if it would benefit the League in any way. If Tenko is my adopted older brother, then you are my adopted cousin, I don‚Äôt do stuff like that to my family. If you decide to distance yourself from us, we‚Äôll all understand. We‚Äôll miss you greatly, but we won‚Äôt blame you.‚Äù 

The brief hostility he spotted earlier vanishes. Mustard is once again lost, conflicted and in emotional pain. 

‚ÄúYou are in a position to do all that.‚Äù Izuku continues. ‚ÄúMustard‚Äôs true name and face are unknown. Do not take a line of work that will make you use your quirk, and you can stay undetected. Or just sell your adopted parent‚Äôs belongings, move elsewhere and then, after you graduate from school, move overseas. Eraserhead and the rest will think that it was done out of grief. The people you killed were all monsters. Villains that did horrible things to undeserving people. You only did horrible things to deserving people. Think of yourself as a retired vigilante and live on. Or‚Ä¶‚Äù 

He pauses for a few seconds. Mustard stares at him in silence. 

‚Äú... rethink your motivations for villainy.‚Äù Izuku continues. ‚ÄúFind a new reason to fight alongside us. You know what I want. I want a better society. One where fake heroes like Endeavor aren‚Äôt venerated by the public, and villains do not annihilate entire cities and do not threaten to destroy Japan. You can join me again, if you want. So for now, take some time. Your decision to leave was done in a hurry, and not in your normal emotional state. Rethink it for a week or two. Decide what you truly want to do in your life. Then send me a message. Either telling me your goodbyes, or asking me to send Kurogiri to bring you back to the base to rejoin us officially. Alright?‚Äù

Few seconds of silence. Mustard is mulling over Legion‚Äôs words. Eventually he nods. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll‚Ä¶ wait for a week.‚Äù 

 

***

 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre meeting Mr. Compress?‚Äù Stain asks, in clear surprise. ‚ÄúAnd you want to bring ME with you? I‚Äôm not exactly a diplomat.‚Äù Understatement of a century, to be honest. 

It was three days after the battle, and Stain‚Äôs speed of recovery was just damn inhuman. Izuku dragged him to the underground hospital for a check-up, and he was now allowed to operate normally (though advised AGAINST going extremely all-out for a while longer).

‚ÄúI‚Äôm bringing you with me mostly because you are the only member of the League to be able to fight him in melee.‚Äù Izuku replies with brutal honesty. ‚ÄúYou being a walking successful intimidation check might be useful. You don‚Äôt have to talk at all. Just be there in case things went wrong.‚Äù 

Mindscrew is in the living room with Izuku and his two uncles. Not because he is joining the mission, but because Izuku had a few words with him about what to do if it was a trap. The plan included Vanguard attacking the location with Sunset. He still has his curiosity. 

‚ÄúMr. Compress is that dangerous?‚Äù He asks. Izuku isn‚Äôt surprised. Mr. Compress cultivated his image of a mostly harmless oddity to perfection. 

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt we already have that talk about my mom?‚Äù Mindscrew flinches when the mention brings back bad memories. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt fully dissect his quirk, but I suspect that he is capable of ‚Äòcompressing‚Äô or otherwise storing objects on touch. The problem is that ‚Äòobjects‚Äô include humans and probably parts of them.‚Äù 

They are listening intently. Especially Stain. He never met Mr. Compress, after all, but knows that they‚Äôre talking about an SS-Rank villain. There are no weak supervillains - Legion is probably the weakest out of them all when it comes to fighting, but he can still instakill people on touch. Stain leaves nothing to chance. 

Mindscrew listens to, in case he had to lead a rescue operation. 

‚ÄúSo one touch KO, like you, but less bloody.‚Äù Mindscrew summarizes. Izuku shakes his head. 

‚ÄúNot quite.‚Äù He adds. ‚ÄúHe trained his quirk to perfection. I don‚Äôt think he needs to directly touch you - he can probably store an entire area of space, for as long as his hands are in contact with said area. That‚Äôs my theory, but I think that this isn‚Äôt instantaneous unlike direct touch, so he prefers to avoid doing that. So, if you see something weird happening to space around you, jump out of the affected area immediately.‚Äù 

Stain and Hitoshi nod scarcely. Kurogiri stays unreadable. 

‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt get manipulated by him.‚Äù Izuku adds. ‚ÄúHe is an expert in appearing like a harmless loony. He is pretty much a street magician turned melee master - he excels in one-on-one combat, since he can use his assortment of ‚Äòparlour tricks‚Äô to manipulate your perception. If we start fighting, expect him to make nonsensical and bombastic movements that are supposed to draw your attention from what he is truly doing. Be extremely wary of openings, because most of them will be a trap. When Yoroi Muusha cornered him two years ago, he somehow managed to STEAL his sword from his hands, with the hero failing to notice how he did that. He is no pushover.‚Äù 

He keeps talking for a few more minutes, before the time comes and Kurogiri teleports to the designated coordinates. 

 

***

 

Izuku almost chokes on air when the warp ends and he sees where they are now. He recognizes the look beyond the window, and the massive room he is in. If not for Mr. Compress in front of them, he would immediately shout to Kurogiri for a warp out, thinking that it was a trap. 

‚ÄúYou are absolutely insane.‚Äù Izuku finally settles on saying. Kurogiri and Stain appear surprised by his reaction. Mr. Compress is hidden behind the mask and so is an unfamiliar person next to him. Gentle appears to be on the verge of laughing. ‚ÄúYou set up a meeting in ENDEAVOR‚ÄôS OFFICE?‚Äù 

Stain has a look of genuine surprise on his face - an extremely rare feat. Kurogiri is unreadable as always. 

‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt need it anymore, doesn‚Äôt he?‚Äù Mr. Compress says, before laughing loudly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve decided to invite ourselves as La Brava found a nice backdoor into the agency‚Äôs systems. Enough to keep us hidden for‚Ä¶ thirty minutes. Setting a time limit on the meeting should keep useless words to a minimum. So, unless you have a different idea‚Ä¶ should we proceed?‚Äù 

Was Mr. Compress trying to set up the pecking order with this stunt? Probably not. Knowing him and his approach to unworthy heroes (oddly similar to Stain, all things considered), he probably considered it a form of practical joke. 

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù Izuku decides to go along with this madness. ‚ÄúThe Paranormal Liberation Front is a threat to us all. I want to rule the underworld. You want to continue the Peerless Thief‚Äôs tradition of stealing from heroes unworthy of the title and people unworthy of their wealth. Neither of this is achievable if the PLF wins and burns Japan to the ground.‚Äù  

‚ÄúHow much of a threat they truly are?‚Äù Mr. Compress asks. Izuku sometimes forgets that not everyone in the underworld is as knowledgeable as he is. Being his father‚Äôs son (and student) has its great benefits. 

‚ÄúAn existential one.‚Äù Izuku replies honestly. ‚ÄúSituation is bad enough that I had someone from Nedzu‚Äôs inner circle approach me about a truce and alliance against the PLF.‚Äù Gentle‚Äôs face shifts slightly. It‚Äôs a surprise, but also a slight fear. Others are unreadable, but Mr. Compress‚Äô body language seems‚Ä¶ shaken. Slightly. But it might be staged. It probably is.

‚ÄúThey have no less than five thousand soldiers from the former QLF‚Ä¶‚Äù Izuku continues. ‚Äú...unknown number of quirk suppressing warheads created by Overhaul, and no less than one hundred noumus of Doctor Ujiko. Noumus, for the record, are bioengineered and unfailingly obedient former humans granted multiple quirks through some really fucked up science. During the Training Camp War, the PLF also deployed ten High End Noumus, each armed with a particularly powerful quirk combination and with some intellect left. Five of those were enough to put All Might on the death‚Äôs door, and as a general analysis goes, each is an equivalent of a supervillain or a Top Ten hero.‚Äù 

Gentle is terrified - he is extremely expressive and honest about things like that. There is a high chance that Compress brought him to telegraph the honest thoughts of the Levellers in general, while keeping the more‚Ä¶ subtle thoughts of Compress himself obfuscated. That‚Äôs something that Compress would certainly do. 

The other masked person is moving their face between Legion and Mr. Compress, visibly nervous. Mr. Compress appears to be the calmest of the bunch. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ certainly an existential threat.‚Äù Peerless Thief‚Äôs heir finally replies. ‚ÄúAnd I think we can all agree with your analysis of the results of the PLF‚Äôs victory and their influence on our long-term plans. A quick question: why do you think that I won‚Äôt decide that PLF WILL win and try to throw my lots with them, my dear Legion?‚Äù 

Stain freezes a bit. Legion is much calmer. Mr. Compress is just testing them. 

‚ÄúBecause Overhaul kept the adoptive daughter of Mischief in a dungeon for years, repeatedly bleeding her to death and resurrecting her with his quirk.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúOccasionally also killing her for some minor mistakes and then bringing her back. She was four years old when this started‚Ä¶ and now Overhaul wants her back to start everything anew. And you, my dear Mr. Compress, are an honourable thief and not a psychopathic monster.‚Äù 

Silence in the office. Mr. Compress is the one to break it. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an extremely valid reason not to join them, I admit.‚Äù Judging from Gentle‚Äôs face, he would have to face a rebellion if he tried anything else. ‚ÄúVery well, I‚Äôm interested in working together against them, then. What are the terms?‚Äù 

You can say a lot of things about Mr. Compress. But not that he lacks morals. There is a reason why he is one of the few supervillains Izuku can even consider working with. 

‚ÄúYou and Re-Destro aren‚Äôt the only heirs of famous villains who are trying to measure up to their ancestors‚Äô image.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúMy father had many names. You might know him as either All for One‚Ä¶ or the Symbol of Evil.‚Äù 

Mr. Compress recognizes the names. The other two probably not, although Gentle would probably do it if Izuku called his father a ‚ÄòQuirk Thief‚Äô. 

‚ÄúYou are trying to rebuild his empire.‚Äù Mr. Compress asks. He is unreadable. Izuku is certain that he isn‚Äôt the only person who has SERIOUS issues with his dad‚Äôs legend. He has to tread lightly, or the meeting will end in blood. 

‚ÄúWith some notable changes.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúI dislike his methods. Way too bloody, way too nasty, way too ‚Äòyou have outlived your usefulness now die‚Äô and so on. Not to mention brainwashing, extremely unethical experiments, killing families of his enemies slowly, etcetera. My goal is to stop the chaos that followed his death. Chaos that, right now, appears to be carrying the faces of Overhaul, Ujiko and Re-Destro. Rebuilding his empire appears to be the only option to do that without worsening the situation further, at least for a villain.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll for One‚Äôs son working alongside the UA.‚Äù Mr. Compress comments and his head tilts a bit. He is probably staring quizzically through it. ‚ÄúNow that‚Äôs a twist I didn‚Äôt see coming. Would make for a great theatre play with a good director, huh.‚Äù He pauses for a few seconds. ‚ÄúSo, what's that new empire going to look like?‚Äù 

‚ÄúIn short, the League of Villains is going to have numerous subsidiary groups.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúYou might have already heard of the Villain Industries, it‚Äôs not often that we get an S-Rank support villain. You also know of the Quirkless Equality Movement being in our camp. What you probably do not know is that the threat of the PLF destroying everything has also urged a handful of information brokers to join our exclusive espionage and information gathering organization.‚Äù He isn‚Äôt going to mention that damnable name. He almost managed to persuade Himiko to agree to changing it. ‚ÄúThere are more projects than that, for example Villain Academy, whose sole goal is nurturing the quirks and abilities of prospective young villains, not unlike the hero academies of today.‚Äù

Mr. Compress laughs. 

‚ÄúAssistance.‚Äù He adds once the laughter dies out. ‚ÄúWhoever joins you will get access to support items, to information sources, to potential qualified new recruits fitting their ideological point. Without needing to network on their own. A country-wide net, with you, the spider, in the middle. Smart. Very smart. And ambitious. What in exchange for all of that?‚Äù He asks curiously.

‚ÄúFollowing the rules.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúNo mass murder, no attempts to change Japan into wasteland, no going after heroes‚Äô families because that‚Äôs honestly a really low blow and I have personal issues with that. A cut from your villainous incomes, of course. I need to pay my bills.‚Äù 

Mr. Compress chuckles faintly. Izuku doesn‚Äôt ask.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll also expect your support for League of Villains‚Äô operations, although this is something that can be refused on a moral basis.‚Äù Izuku continues. ‚ÄúI know your approach to killing people, so I‚Äôm not going to ask you to help me or another subsidiary group in doing that. But I MIGHT ask you for help when it comes to messing up some corrupted hero group by stealing their black funds or exposing their corruption to the world. It works both ways - you will also be able to ask for assistance from other groups through me, when needed.‚Äù He suddenly remembers something he forgot to say earlier. ‚ÄúOh, and I‚Äôll probably end up having to open my own Bank of Evil at some point, so asking for monetary assistance to be paid back after the heists is an option too.‚Äù 

Mr. Compress laughs cheerfully. Gentle appears to be surprised by it. 

‚ÄúOh, this is just wonderful!‚Äù The SS-Rank supervillain adds after the laughter dies down. ‚ÄúThe UA, the greatest force of good in this country, is helping you reconstruct your father‚Äôs empire, merely a few years after All Might killed him. And you, a villain, the son of the most evil man in the history of Japan if not the world, are seeking to curb the chaos and STOP people from killing families of heroes and committing mass murders! Oh, this is hilarious. You know what, I love this. This is‚Ä¶ theatre play, a book, a TRILOGY OF MOVIES material!‚Äù He laughs again. 

Izuku is almost certain that it‚Äôs a prologue to an agreement. Almost. He calls for Reflex Boost just in case. 

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt order around the Levellers.‚Äù Mr. Compress adds after a few seconds, suddenly calm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm their leader, yes. But I‚Äôm not going to make such a change without asking what they think about it. But let‚Äôs make a deal - I‚Äôll tell them that this idea is wonderful‚Ä¶ and in exchange there‚Äôll be a time when I‚Äôll get to write down your history. When you‚Äôll let me stage a play about your rise to power! When you‚Äôll let me make a series of films about it! I‚Äôll make a cameo in it, no one‚Äôs going to recognize me under the mask, yes, that will be wonderful!‚Äù 

‚ÄúI believe we can come to an accomodation.‚Äù Izuku replies. Mr. Compress is a man of culture and quality - he will make the play/films/book be worth it. ‚ÄúIn the meantime‚Ä¶ We still have a few minutes left. Why did you say that I‚Äôd like your mysterious guest?‚Äù

Chapter 33: War Council
Summary:

    The UA is finally gearing up for war. Eraserhead is super done, and All Might is almost equally done.

Chapter Text

Mirio Togata: I was authorized by Sir Nighteye to inform you that the first meeting of Nedzu‚Äôs second War Council is scheduled for 3pm tomorrow. Nedzu will give you a summary of what happened after it, but asks for everything you have on Overhaul and Doctor Ujiko. Make a presentation or smth.

Akatani Mikumo: My powerpoint skills suck.

Akatani Mikumo: Can I come in person?

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶

Mirio Togata: what?

Akatani Mikumo: Can I come to the War Council meeting in person? I will be able to answer questions.

Mirio Togata: We‚Äôre inviting most UA-aligned Top 15 heroes, plus representatives from the potential allied groups. You‚Äôll be in the room full of heroes, or at least you would be if not for the fact that I‚Äôd arrest you before entering it. 

Akatani Mikumo: Think of all the autographs I might be able to get! 

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶

Akatani Mikumo: OK

Akatani Mikumo: jokes aside

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôll come as Akatani Mikumo, Legion‚Äôs representative. AND I‚Äôve recently met some lovely person with a wonderful quirk that‚Äôll make me basically impossible to arrest for the duration of the meeting. So you‚Äôll have an explanation for NOT arresting me. 

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶

Mirio Togata: I can relay your words to Nedzu and Sir Nighteye, but we‚Äôll need to know the quirk in question if you want to have even the tiniest chance of them accepting this madness.

Akatani Mikumo: Sure!

Akatani Mikumo: The quirk in question can clone an individual, imbuing the clone with a perfect copy of memories, personality and skills of the original. Copies are rather squishy and can‚Äôt use their quirks, but when destroyed their additional memories are copied back to the original (regardless of the distance). 

 

Okay, so he did lie about not being able to use the quirks, but he was a villain! He had to keep some things hidden just in case (besides, that was a secret of the Levellers, not his own). He also had to agree that Mr. Compress was right - Twice had an AWESOME quirk and sounded like a genuinely decent fellow. One more victim of circumstances. Too bad that Levellers got to him first. Izuku would have recruited him immediately. 

 

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôll have my clone attend the meeting. You can have Miruko kick it through the window once it ends, if it makes her feel better.

Akatani Mikumo: Just not in the face, I once came upon THOSE drawings on the internet and it‚Äôd be awkwardly disgusting. Please. I have no such kink and I don‚Äôt want any weird mind images. 

Akatani Mikumo: And not somewhere where it really hurts (wink wink) because I‚Äôll remember the pain. 

Mirio Togata: I‚Äôll tell you what they think about it. 

 

He waited for thirty minutes before the answer came. 

 

Mirio Togata: I think they are more surprised with it than me, but they decided that it might be a good idea. But you‚Äôre supposed to behave, will have to answer Tsukauchi questions considering your reasons to join the meeting (so some ‚Äòdid you come to kill everyone‚Äô and so on) beforehand AND you‚Äôll have to stick to the subject. 

Mirio Togata: Also don‚Äôt talk about anything that Nedzu doesn‚Äôt know (I mean One for All‚Äôs special nature, you having All for One, us having these talks and so on).

Akatani Mikumo: So I‚Äôll get to visit the UA main building? AWESOME!

Mirio Togata: You‚Äôre unbelievable.

The heroes began to gather up in the UA two hours before the meeting started. Somehow (truly a miracle) vultures didn‚Äôt notice the fact. Eraserhead and All Might ended up acting as the welcome committee. Although, to be honest, All Might was the one doing the greetings. Eraserhead was just standing there, menacingly. 

He is good at standing there, menacingly. 

Edgeshot comes first. in his civilian ninja uniform. Eraserhead has no idea why he is like that. Ninja during work, ninja off-work. He is an extremely competent hero, and one of the noblest, but he is also a major ninja fan. Way too major.

Then comes Crust, straight from the Northern Battle Group. As painfully enthusiastic as All Might. Eraserhead is surprised he didn‚Äôt straight up ask the Number One Hero for an autograph. Despite having like twenty of those already. Ugh. 

Best Jeanist somehow decided to not come fashionably late. And instead comes ahead of time. Wearing his standard clothes. One day Eraserhead will see what that man‚Äôs chin looks like, but it‚Äôs clearly not this day. 

Miruko and Gang Orca arrive together. Which certainly isn‚Äôt a coincidence. Gang Orca can‚Äôt exactly make himself vanish within the crowd, but at least Miruko donned some form of casual clothes. Cut to hide her rabbit features. Eraserhead understands. 

Ms. Joke comes alone. Wearing her typical bandana and an irritatingly wide smile. 

‚ÄúAll Might! How lovely to see you!‚Äù She announces. All Might smiles back. ‚ÄúAizawa, marry me.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù He states flatly. They are underground heroes. They keep their lives secret. ‚ÄòNo‚Äô is a much more secretive way of saying ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt marry you the second time, stop saying that, it‚Äôs not even funny‚Äô. 

She laughs and enters the room. Eraserhead doesn‚Äôt question his previous life choices, but gets pretty close to doing that. 

Knuckleduster heard enough about how ironclad Nedzu‚Äôs guarantees of safety are and decided to come in person. He is old, and as quirkless as ever. Doesn‚Äôt make his fists any less deadly. He gives the two of them scarce nods and heads inside. 

They are about to head inside themselves when they see Lemillion walking towards them with some unfamiliar kid. Wearing a brown hoodie, and with multicoloured hair. He is carrying a notebook and has an All Might-themed backpack. Age is‚Ä¶ 16-17 years old, if Eraserhead judges it correctly. 

‚ÄúOne last invitee.‚Äù Lemilion announces. On his face, a complicated mix of emotions. ‚ÄúNedzu and Sir Nighteye agreed to it, but judging from the looks on your face they forgot to mention it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù All Might speaks first. ‚ÄúAnd who might that be?‚Äù The kid smiles wryly and Eraserhead knows, just KNOWS that he won‚Äôt like the answer. 

‚ÄúMidoriya Izuku, from the League of Villains.‚Äù Lemillion deadpans and Eraserhead curses in his mind. All Might just stares in shock. ‚ÄúOr, to be exact, a quirk-clone of him.‚Äù Legion salutes them and his smile grows wider. ‚ÄúHere as Akatani Mikumo.‚Äù 

Nedzu isn‚Äôt paying Eraserhead enough for any of this. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm extremely sorry about gathering you all on such short notice.‚Äù Nedzu announces to the gathered people. ‚ÄúBut the matter we‚Äôll speak about is grim. The Paranormal Liberation Front is a threat to Japan of a previously unheard level. The attack on UA‚Äôs training camp shouldn‚Äôt have happened, and the fact that the heroes and police failed to notice a movement of an organization of this size is something that has to be addressed. The recent years saw a sharp decrease in team-ups and information sharing between hero agencies, not to mention the underground hero network practically growing into a separate existence from the surface heroics.‚Äù Ms. Joke nods slightly from her seat. ‚ÄúIt is the opinion of me and the faculty that this fact led to the fact that despite various agencies noticing small bits of PLF‚Äôs preparations, they all failed to understand the bigger picture. Leading to the disaster. We seek to amend that.‚Äù 

If there is one positive side of building your organization on the basis of a school, it‚Äôs the abundance of halls that you can easily (and quickly) empty. The gathered group is sitting behind tables formed into a semi-circle. Nedzu is standing in front of them, with Sir Nighteye, All Might, Eraserhead, Detective Tsukauchi and Lemillion sitting behind a straight table behind him. 

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ an information exchange concerning the investigation?‚Äù Edgeshot asks, taking advantage of Nedzu interrupting his introductory speech for a few seconds too much. ‚ÄúA bit overly dramatic for such a thing.‚Äù He is probably all into that. Kamui Woods was a hero from his team. He looks forward to blood being spilled. 

‚ÄúNot quite.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúIt might have been enough if we had done it a few weeks ago. Now this is no longer just an investigation. This is a war. And you are all cordially invited to join the UA‚Äôs War Council.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWar?‚Äù It‚Äôs Miruko, oddly enough. ‚ÄúLots of kids died, I get your anger. But war? Strong word.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid that the full extent of the threat posed by the Paranormal Liberation Front remains hidden from the public. And even from the majority of the heroes.‚Äù Nedzu replies calmly. ‚ÄúHPSC is officially doing it to stop people from panicking, but I respectfully disagree with that policy.‚Äù Everyone can see that there is nothing respectful in his disagreement. ‚ÄúThe Commission and, to a lesser degree, UA, has kept way too many things hidden. Resulting in disasters born from the fact that people who should have known things, didn‚Äôt. I plan to amend it today. You are all free to leave the room right now. If you don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll consider this as you agreeing to join the War Council and will immediately proceed to violate numerous NDAs that the HPSC‚Äô president forced on me. So, does someone want to leave?‚Äù 

In the end, they are heroes. The only one who isn‚Äôt is Legion, but Eraserhead knows that he is here for a reason. Knuckleduster might be a vigilante, but he is a former pro hero, O‚ÄôClock. They know the situation has to be grim for Nedzu to go that far. And when the situation is this grim, it‚Äôs their job as heroes to fix it. So they stay. 

‚ÄúVery well.‚Äù Nedzu nods. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll start chronologically. This is the second iteration of such a War Council. The first one was established twenty one years ago around me and All Might. It was created to face the worst villain in the history of Japan. The man whose crimes and power were so great that me and the Hero Commission agreed to do our best to erase him from history after his death six years ago. This man was the world‚Äôs sole SSSS-Rank villain, known as either All for One, the Symbol of Evil‚Ä¶ or the Quirk Thief.‚Äù 

Knuckleduster‚Äôs face turns into a mask. He remembers waking up in a hospital with his quirk mysteriously missing. Leading to him no longer being a pro-hero. He probably investigated the urban legend enough to suspect that it was true all along.

‚ÄúYou mean‚Ä¶ that urban legend is true?‚Äù Ms. Joke is too shocked to joke about what she just heard. 

‚ÄúThe answer, I‚Äôm afraid, is yes.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúAll for One de facto ruled over the underworld of Japan but also the majority of East Asia for at least two centuries, thanks to a stolen immortality quirk. He gathered hundreds of quirks within his body, even if he could use ‚Äòonly‚Äô about fifteen of them at any given time. This made him a power capable of going toe to toe with most of the Japanese heroes at once and emerge victorious. He had people like Re-Destro, Eclipse, Purity and Beast as lieutenants. He had only a single weakness. At the dawn of his empire he had a brother, quirkless and with a weak body, but of heroic spirit. All for One forced a physical power stockpiling quirk onto him, hoping to make him indebted to him and thus bring him under his control. Unawarely to them both, this brother had a useless quirk, one that allowed him to transfer his own quirk to another person. This quirk fused with the power stockpiling quirk, creating One for All, a quirk passed down a line of heroes and vigilantes seeking to challenge All for One, growing stronger with each holder. This line continued until All Might, One for All‚Äôs 27th Holder, managed to defeat the Quirk Thief. Which happened six years ago.‚Äù 

If anyone else said all that, the heroes would have probably laughed at the tale. Or, at least, some of them. But they were facing Nedzu AND All Might who had an expression of seriousness on his face. 

‚ÄúWhat we did not expect was the chaos that followed.‚Äù Nedzu continues. ‚ÄúAll for One enjoyed controlling society from the shadows. He was actually restraining groups such as the Meta Liberation Army or the Quirkless Liberation Front from burning the country down, as if that happened, he would have nothing left to control. What‚Äôs more, me and the Hero Commission turned against each other, thinking that the villain threat is now over. The result is the growing villain activity of the past few years. This finally culminated in the Quirkless Liberation Front destroying entire cities and merging with remnants of the All for One‚Äôs empire into the Paranormal Liberation Front. And almost annihilating the UA during the recent battle. With heroes too divided to offer significant resistance, we have allowed the situation to possibly grow worse than it was during the All for One‚Äôs reign. Something that we seek to start working on with you now.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat you say is extremely worrying.‚Äù Best Jeanist speaks first, maybe a second before Edgeshot could. Crust seems both hyped out and worried in equal measures. ‚ÄúI believe I‚Äôm speaking for everyone in the room when I say that we didn‚Äôt expect things of this caliber to be hidden not only from the public, but even from the highest ranked pro heroes. I also believe that we can all understand how easily this policy would allow the situation to worsen, especially with the sharp drop in hero team-ups during the past years. Changing that is certainly a good idea.‚Äù 

Edgeshot nodded. Those two didn‚Äôt exactly like each other, mostly for personal reasons. Best Jeanist, in the end, didn‚Äôt say anything groundbreaking. But he did voiced support, and this was something that certainly set the mood. 

‚ÄúFair.‚Äù Ms. Joke comments. ‚ÄúQuick question before we proceed, because curiosity is killing me. Who are the two kids in the room? Not to discount them on the basis of young age, I‚Äôm mostly just curious.‚Äù 

Two kids, so Lemillion and Legion. Eraserhead wondered who was going to bring that up first. 

‚ÄúThe ‚Äòkid‚Äô sitting next to Sir Nighteye is Mirio Togata.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúHe is a third year student of UA under the hero name of Lemillion. You might recognize him from the Hosu recording.‚Äù Knuckleduster looked like he did. Crust too. Edgeshot and Best Jeanist were harder to read. ‚ÄúHe is a part of this council due to being the 28th Holder of the One for All.‚Äù 

Understandable degree of surprise throughout the room. 

‚ÄúOh? Looking forward to working with you, then!‚Äù Ms. Joke is unfailingly optimistic. 

‚ÄúExplains the punch.‚Äù Knuckleduster is way more scarce. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs SUPER COOL!‚Äù Crust finally fails to restrain himself. Eraserhead images him and Legion meeting each other on some internet All Might fanboy forum and shudders internally. 

‚ÄúThe other kid is Akatani Mikumo.‚Äù Nedzu continues. Legion nods scarcely, a wide smile on his face. ‚ÄúHis presence might be a bit harder to understand. He has been one of our main sources of information about the operations of the constituent groups of the Paranormal Liberation Front. I wish to inform you that he was thoroughly interviewed about his presence here by Detective Tsukauchi of Musutafu police, who possesses a lie detecting quirk. With those words behind us, I wish to officially announce that Akatani Mikumo is representing the League of Villains in this meeting.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHe WHAT?‚Äù Knuckleduster rises from his seat in anger. 

‚ÄúTell me that this is a joke.‚Äù Best Jeanist is much more restrained. 

Ms. Joke has a thoughtful expression on her face. Crust appears shocked in an almost overly exaggerated way. Edgeshot is an enigma. Gang Orca‚Äôs eyes narrow, while Miruko is simply observing Akatani carefully. Probably considering kicking his face in. 

‚ÄúLegion has a personal interest in seeing the Paranormal Liberation Front destroyed.‚Äù Akatani announces, completely ignoring the hostile stares. ‚ÄúHe has already saved UA from being destroyed twice, first by stopping Eclipse‚Äôs attack on Musutafu and then by intervening in the Training Camp Battle. He has also saved the lives of Lemillion and All Might, the first one in Hosu and the second one during the PLF attack a few days ago. Now he has sent me to this meeting in order to share the intel the League has on the PLF.‚Äù His head turns towards Knuckleduster, who is dangerously close to him, and with his fists clenched. ‚ÄúFeel free to kill me afterwards, I came here as a quirk clone. Killing me will only upload my memories back to the original body. Nothing to arrest, to begin with.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôd advise against killing him.‚Äù Nedzu announces while the remaining heroes (and a vigilante) swallow up the news. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid that we‚Äôre going to need every bit of help we can muster to win this war, even when it comes from the villains. You‚Äôll know why once we‚Äôll explain what and who exactly the PLF has in its ranks. Feel free to make decisions concerning his presence here after that segment of this meeting.‚Äù 

They back down. Somewhat. The subject will return after said segment, Eraserhead has no doubts about it. Ms. Joke is eyeing him questioningly, probably wondering what else he kept from here. 

‚ÄúI believe it‚Äôs time for you to start.‚Äù Nedzu says towards Legion, and promptly leaves the center of the room. Izuku stands up from his seat and moves in front of the gathered heroes. 

‚ÄúWell then, let‚Äôs start.‚Äù Izuku says, ignoring the hostility. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll begin with the former forces of the Quirkless Liberation Front. While counting the recent casualties suffered by them, Legion estimates that PLF has no less than four thousand five hundred remaining combatants. They are all...‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù It‚Äôs Miruko. Things rarely surprise her so much. ‚ÄúHow many?!‚Äù The rabbit woman is clearly distraught. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt it just a thousand?‚Äù 

‚ÄúOfficially, yes.‚Äù Legion replies, unmoved by the sudden interruption. ‚ÄúQLF had about one thousand active members prior to the Hosu battle. What isn‚Äôt known to the world is that after their rampage became known to the world, the QLF has received an influx of new recruits from outside of Japan. They had equipment for them, including tanks and other vehicles, but they were mostly untrained and spoke in a variety of languages. Legion suspects that they were kept in reserve while training up to QLF‚Äôs standard. Considering the casualties that Miruko and Gang Orca caused to the original one thousand during their battle with the QLF AND the fact that PLF fielded about a thousand during the last battle‚Ä¶‚Äù he turns towards Nedzu, who is now sitting by the UA table, right beside Lemillion. ‚Äú... is it safe to assume that some of them weren‚Äôt of japanese descent?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat is correct.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve investigated the corpses of the QLF soldiers left after the battle. We‚Äôre far from giving them a full analysis, but at least one in three certainly wasn't Japanese.‚Äù 

‚ÄúGreat, we have that confirmed.‚Äù Legion mumbles a bit then perks up. ‚ÄúNow, the QLF‚Äôs command roster. We know of at least three notable members other than Overhaul slash Chronostasis. We don‚Äôt know their names, nor faces. The first one is the technopath responsible for taking down Nedzu‚Äôs communication network during the Training Camp attack. He or she managed to connect Overhaul to it, deliver his message to everyone in the camp, and then shut everything down until the battle ended. Might have been boosted with Trigger, though. Might also be limited to a single network at once, as they failed to take down the replacement network. The second one is a warp quirk user identical to Eclipse. The third one is much trickier and probably infinitely more dangerous.‚Äù

He pauses for a few seconds, letting them catch up with his words and taking a deeper breath. 

‚ÄúOverhaul has an access to someone, probably a late-bloomer, with a dangerously powerful brainwashing quirk.‚Äù Legion says, to some murmur in the room. ‚ÄúSunset mentioned that in her manifest, and I can confirm it. Before Eclipse‚Äôs fall, League‚Äôs spy in the Front began to report people dissenting against her campaign of terror disappearing somewhere for an hour or two, and returning as absolutely fanatic supporters of quirked-genocide. Considering the speed at which this process continued, we can safely consider everyone above the regular soldiers to be completely and utterly loyal to Overhaul. Every regular soldier who attempted to voice their opposition to the plan was also brainwashed. You can expect no dissent or disobedience from the QLF forces.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMass brainwashing?‚Äù Miruko is livid. ‚ÄúFucking cowards! To their own people?‚Äù She voiced the general opinion on the issue in question. 

‚ÄúIt gets worse.‚Äù Legion announces and nods towards Nedzu. A single move of his finger and Legion is accompanied by holograms of two people. One with a white hair forming an arrow in front of him (and a gasmask), and one with black hair and bird mask. They are slowly rotating, to let everyone see it. 

‚ÄúThese two people are Overhaul, an SSS-Rank villain and the current co-leader of the Paranormal Liberation Front.‚Äù Legion continues. ‚ÄúThe black hair one is his original look, the other one is how he looks currently. I‚Äôll explain the difference in a minute. Overhaul is a former boss of a small-time yakuza group known as Shie Hasseikai. He has overthrew the former boss, who was his adoptive father, and put him into permanent coma until his death. He‚Ä¶ infected this group with a rather particular ideology. According to him, quirks are a disease upon Mankind that he vowed to heal.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWow, what a load of bullshit.‚Äù Miruko, as always, is frank. ‚ÄúBut I can see how that got him to join the QLF.‚Äù 

‚ÄúLoad of bullshit, yes.‚Äù Legion agrees with her. ‚ÄúUnfortunately Overhaul turned out to be one of the greatest geniuses in the history of quirk sciences, one to not only equal but probably surpass those gathered on the I-Island. Quirk suppressing gas is based on a diluted and imperfect drug created by him as part of his research. His original goal was creation of a drug capable of rendering people permanently quirkless, a feat that he actually succeeded in.‚Äù 

Eraserhead expected shock. And he wasn‚Äôt surprised. Then again, how else could one react to such an announcement? 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Äù Edgeshot finally speaks. The parts of his face that Eraserhead can see are twisted in horror. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding.‚Äù Miruko is frozen. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to, but I‚Äôm not.‚Äù Legion states flatly. ‚ÄúThe good news is that before he managed to mass produce his wonder-drug, Legion assaulted his lab together with Stain and Kurogiri. Legion killed the original Overhaul during that battle, while Stain managed to steal, or to be more precise, liberate the necessary component in production of the quirk suppressing and quirk erasing bullets. Gas is a later development, and a proof that Overhaul regained the ability to produce the weakened version of his drug in amounts previously unheard of. Legion doesn‚Äôt know how that happened. Thus far we‚Äôve seen no proof of him also possessing the full quirk erasing drug, but unless he is killed quickly, he‚Äôs almost guaranteed to eventually achieve it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to add‚Ä¶‚Äù Nedzu says from his seat. ‚ÄúThat the Hero Commission is fully aware of this situation. It is the reason why Overhaul was immediately deemed an SSS-Rank villain after we become aware that he is still active. David Shield received a hard drive from Overhaul computer in his laboratory, thanks to Legion‚Äôs generosity, and is currently working on an antidote to the quirk erasing drug. However even the most optimistic estimate is that we‚Äôre years behind Overhaul. HPSC decided to hide the prospect of quirk erasure gas from the public to avoid panic.‚Äù He sneers mockingly. ‚ÄúMr. Mikumo, do you wish to narrate the details of Overhaul‚Äôs research, or should we leave it to Sir Nighteye?‚Äù 

Legion is alright with sharing the stage. Sir Nighteye quickly narrates Overhaul‚Äôs discovery about the way to affect quirks with pharmaceuticals, the prospects that this research offer for the next several decades‚Ä¶ and the part of how Overhaul created a back-up of himself in the form of quirk transplant (together with his memories and personality) to the body of his closest lieutenant, Chronostasis.

‚ÄúShit.‚Äù Knuckleduster comments when he finishes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like something from a horror movie.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to ask, but what is this ‚Äònecessary component‚Äô you mentioned earlier?‚Äù Ms. Joke asks Midoriya. Eraserhead is faintly happy - it‚Äôs a good question that he thinks that he actually asked during his first meeting with Legion. 

‚ÄúBlood of a four years old girl that Overhaul kept locked in his basement and repeatedly drained to death before resurrecting her with his quirk.‚Äù Legion doesn‚Äôt want to play nice this time. This illicites a lot of shocked gasps in the room. ‚ÄúShe was freed from his lab by Stain and later adopted by Legion‚Äôs mother. He kept her hidden from the world until the Training Camp battle, when he was forced to ask her to use her healing quirk to save All Might‚Äôs life. Overhaul certainly knows she is out there and wants her back, but her protection is something that the League will do on its own.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNow I really want to cave his face in.‚Äù Miruko announces. Even Best Jeanist doesn‚Äôt complain about it. 

Midoriya proceeds to detail the exact workings of Overhaul‚Äôs quirk. Including parts as lovely as its ability to assimilate bodies of others, changing Overhaul into a hulking abomination capable of using multiple quirks. He also mentions the possibility that the QLF‚Äôs brainwasher is actually Overhaul, who is doing that through some detailed brain surgery, although he cites this as unlikely. He also mentions David Shield‚Äôs theory about Overhaul‚Äôs failing body. 

‚ÄúNow we move onto the second major component of the PLF‚Äôs forces.‚Äù Legion announces, before nodding towards Nedzu. The holograph changes to a small, bald man with a massive moustache. ‚ÄúThis is doctor Kyudai Garaki, known to the world as doctor Daruma Ujiko. Although the latter is an alias that he uses while dealing with the PLF. He is one of the closest co-workers of All for One and, I‚Äôm afraid, a brain to match Overhaul‚Äôs.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnother crazy scientist?‚Äù Miruko decides to comment on that. ‚ÄúThey should vet candidates better.‚Äù Eraserhead chuckles. Without making it visible to the world. But he is sure that Ms. Joke noticed. She always does. 

‚ÄúHe actually worked with the League for a while as an‚Ä¶ independent subcontractor.‚Äù Legion admits, surprising Eraserhead. And a lot of other people. ‚ÄúLegion attempted to locate him in order to either eliminate him or rat him out to the heroes, but he is extremely cowardly. He will never show in person to any meeting, instead hiding behind a very well secured internet connection. He is a carrier of an immortality quirk and is no less than one hundred twenty years old. More than that, he is the original proponent of the Quirk Singularity Theory. During the All for One‚Äôs reign he shifted from one hospital to another as a highly competent specialist in quirk healthcare, informing his master about interesting quirks to add to his‚Ä¶ collection. He latched onto the League for a while, but deemed it too bloodless and civil for his taste, and threw his lots with Overhaul. I can assure you that Legion was completely surprised by this development.‚Äù

Miruko wants to comment on that, but Detective Tsukauchi is first. 

‚ÄúHe spoke what he genuinely believes to be true.‚Äù Detective says, and Miruko backs down. Rare feat. 

‚ÄúHis greatest creation are the noumus.‚Äù Another switch of the hologram, this time to two vastly different but still hulking beasts with exposed brains. ‚ÄúThose are the first generation noumus. Each of them was formerly a human, but went through an extensive process of genetic modification and biological adaptations, not to mention various surgeries. They are divided into three main categories. Standard noumus are merely biologically enhanced while carrying their original quirk in a massively empowered form. Those noumu candidates that manage to go through it without turning into brain-dead puppets are classified as Near High Ends, and receive further augmentations and at least a single additional quirk and are typically capable of contending with Top 100 heroes. Extremely rarely someone manages to retain a certain degree of will and mind even after that. Those that do become one of Doctor Garaki‚Äôs favourites. Resulting High Ends receive a highly specialized and compatible set of quirks, allowing them to go toe-to-toe with Top Ten heroes or supervillains. ‚Äù 

‚ÄúI'll allow myself to inform you‚Ä¶‚Äù Nedzu interrupts the silence in the room. ‚ÄúThat PLF mobilized no less than two hundred fifty noumus for the assault on the Training Camp, including fifteen High Ends and at least forty Near High Ends. Three High Ends, fifteen Near High Ends and eighty standard noumus are unaccounted for and are believed to have retreated with the PLF‚Äôs forces. Majority of noumu casualties can be attributed to either All Might or Zealot‚Äôs last stand, during which he briefly reached the All Might‚Äôs level of physical strength. Students and other heroes were way less successful in their battles against noumus. Stain almost died taking down a single High End.‚Äù 

The silence after that announcement becomes deafening rather quickly. 

‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll add that Legion never condoned the first generation noumus.‚Äù Legion decides to interrupt it. ‚ÄúThis was the main reason why he attempted to locate and eliminate Doctor Garaki. In the meantime he tried to persuade him to move to slightly less maniacally evil Second Gen noumus. Hellhound from the USJ attack and the noumus deployed by the League in Hosu are constructed on the foundation of quirked animals which, unlike Principal Nedzu, didn‚Äôt develop sentience.‚Äù Nedzu freezes slightly, this is the first time he hears about it. ‚ÄúSuch animals lack higher brain functions, meaning that they have nothing to lose in that department during the augmentation process. Unfortunately, they require a lot of time to ‚Äòtrain‚Äô for combat properly after they are noumufied, in a way practically identical to training of normal attack animals. All but the High End Hellhound are currently in the PLF‚Äôs hands, but weren‚Äôt deployed during the Training Camp battle. This suggests that the PLF didn‚Äôt deploy all of its noumus, and still has some manpower to spare.‚Äù 

Silence. 

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù Legion‚Äôs head tilts slightly. ‚Äú... do you still think that you don‚Äôt need the League of Villains‚Äô help in this?‚Äù 
Notes:

    Our Lady and Saviour, the Angry Rabbit is finally here. Still a loooot of chapters before shipping might commence.

    Also the next chapter has us take a closer look at the Villain Academy and introduced my probably the most favourite OC in the entire series :V Angry Rabbit is already here, time for the Timid Rabbit to join the fray as well.

Chapter 34: Recruitment
Summary:

    VILLAIN ACADEMY IS FINALLY HERE! Including a cadre of completely new OCs with super-cool quirks (or lack of them). Yey.

Chapter Text

Izuku was having a reasonable degree of fun describing everything to the gathered heroes. Seeing some of his favourite heroes (and probably his favourite vigilante, because Knuckleduster kicked ass WITHOUT a quirk, c‚Äômon) gathered in front of him was just awesome! 

If not for the subject of the talk. He didn‚Äôt like that at all. 

‚ÄúI admit it‚Äôs bad.‚Äù Knuckleduster is the one to speak. ‚ÄúBut why are you here? You‚Äôre a villain.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are one too, if you follow the technicalities.‚Äù Mikumo replies. Knuckleduster flinches. ‚ÄúLeague is a group of messed-up people that decide to make the world a better place through outright villainy. Changing Japan into a postapocalyptic wasteland inhabited by either forced quirkless or brain-dead mutants is by no means an improvement in our books. There is also the part where Legion absolutely hates Overhaul for what he did to his sister and wants to murder him. Slowly. Oh, and Garaki too, but he is more of an afterthought.‚Äù He sighs, with just a little bit of acting. ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt the only villain group to oppose the PLF. I came here as a representative of not only Legion, but also Sunset and Mr. Compress. League of Villains, Quirkless Equality Movement and the Levellers all want to stop the PLF and are willing to work with the heroes to achieve it.‚Äù 

That surprised them all. He didn‚Äôt mention how (technically speaking) Mr. Compress was now a League member and had his organization join the growing list of its subsidiary groups. 

‚ÄúHe said what he believes to be the truth.‚Äù Detective Tsukauchi responds to the unspoken query. 

Knuckleduster still punches him in the face strong enough for his body to dissolve. Although he does that after four hours of intense discussion and war planning.

Legion: Nice. So a quick announcement.

Legion: This is now the official business chatroom of the greater League of Villains. I suspect we‚Äôll get another, even more open chatroom for lesser constituent groups (I‚Äôm negotiating with like 20 different villain crews to throw their lots with us).

Legion: This one will be a bit more exclusive. At least partially a command center. 

Legion: You want to ask for help, make an official query about some things, etc., you do it here. 

Mr. Compress: Marvelous. Business. 

Mr. Compress: So, perhaps some introductions are in order? Because I must admit, I have no idea why some people are here. Don‚Äôt take that as an insult, I‚Äôm mostly just curious. 

Legion: Every person in this chatroom is a head of a constituent group of the League of Villains.

Legion: C‚Äômon, introduce yourself.

Gremlin: Gremlin! CEO of Villain Industries and #1 provider of support items for villains! #1 in quality, not in quantity, at least not yet. We‚Äôre working on it and I‚Äôm looking forward to cooperating with you!

Mindscrew: Vanguard Action Squad of the League of Villains. Legion‚Äôs personal death squad. 

Sunset: Head of the Quirkless Equality Movement. 

Kurogiri: Principal of the Villain Academy.

Vantablack: Head of the Exchange (HIMIKO RELENTED, IZUKU), the independent information brokering slash espionage and infiltration organization! Unranked because, well, I‚Äôm good at it, and Nedzu is still an angry ass over me wiretapping his office and recording his awkward attempts at singing on tape ]:-> 

Legion: (FUCK YES)

Mr. Compress: I won‚Äôt ask. Actually screw that, I‚Äôll ask.

Legion: I said that someone can pick the name for that last one (namely, Vampire), but it was atrocious. And she finally agreed to changing it. 

Mr. Compress: I see.

Legion: Not telling you the old name, it‚Äôs too shameful.

Mr. Compress: I‚Äôll find out eventually and have a good laugh over it. 

Mr. Compress: Well, I‚Äôm Mr. Compress. Master of the stage, the best actor and stage magician in Japan, the man to actually defeat Stain in close quarters (Is he still moping? Just a friendly duel it was) and the man who actually understands the value of quality entertainment and style! I‚Äôm here at the behest of the Levellers. 

Legion: He is moping a bit. But also looking for a rematch. He wasn‚Äôt back to full strength after the Training Camp battle.

Mr. Compress: Oh fantastic! He has that gritty, scary atmosphere that would make him perfect as an actor in a film about some gritty, grimdark times. Like ours. I really like him. Entertaining that was.

Mr. Compress: So, business?
Legion: Well, unless you have something to ask of us (Gremlin is looking forward to the support items she can create for the Levellers), then I believe that Kurogiri has something to say? 

Gremlin: Yes. I'm currently swamped with work outfitting the QEM forces. Mass-production is a nope (assistants already overworked and I have problems finding more), but I‚Äôll gladly have a baby with Mr. Compress or other Levellers!

Mr. Compress: I require context. 

Legion: She calls her inventions ‚Äòbabies‚Äô. 

Mr. Compress: OH WHAT AN ABSOLUTE DEDICATION TO THE JOB, I LOVE IT SO MUCH

Mr. Compress: We just HAVE TO talk about that later. But now, Kurogiri it is!

Kurogiri: It‚Äôs about a month since the Villain Academy started. We progress much faster than the hero schools thanks to the fact that we do not need to bother ourselves with providing high quality conventional education alongside more practical stuff (although we aren‚Äôt entirely without it). 

Kurogiri: There is also the part where our students all have practical skills, me and the teachers just had to improve on them.

Kurogiri: The first pilot class is making steady progress. As a result I decided that it might be the correct time to start the internships. Most of them will find those among the smaller crews through the Exchange, but I thought a handful were talented enough that we might want to hold on to them. 

Mr. Compress: A month? That‚Äôs fast! Excuse me for asking, but how exactly does your school work?

Mr. Compress: I‚Äôm fascinated. 

Legion: I‚Äôm interested too. 

Kurogiri: I‚Äôve got a building through a certain information broker that has now joined the Exchange. I gathered twenty prospective students (Legion helped me with the vetting process) - they now live in said building, while I‚Äôm warping in the teachers for the lessons. And sometimes the students for the open air classes. 

Kurogiri: Initially, the active teachers were just me (homeroom teacher of the class) and Vampire (opening locks, disguises, CQC, street smarts, etc.), but I recently got a handful of retired villains to join us. Including Mischief. 

Legion: What? She didn‚Äôt tell me that ._. I‚Äôm sad.

Kurogiri: Your mom is more of a guest lecturer. She is quite popular, though. Someone dug out her old villain merch and pictures and, well‚Ä¶ teenagers and skin tight bodysuits.

Legion: Ugh. 

Mr. Compress: Ugh.

Legion: Am I supposed to believe that you have no poster of her in a skin tight bodysuit, @Mr. Compress? 

Mr. Compress: Well, at least I‚Äôm not a teenager. Just an admirer of fine arts with an extraordinary taste in quality. 

Legion: Ugh.

Kurogiri: You are a bit too busy to show up, Legion. 

Legion: Well, yes. But I did provide you and graded those assignments on combat quirk analysis. 

Legion: I‚Äôll find some time for you when you‚Äôll start working on their quirk improvements.

Kurogiri: Very good. Back to the subject. 

Kurogiri: After a month I‚Äôve also begun to further specialize certain school plans. Current main specializations are: Combat, Espionage and Command. Before I forget: Mr. Compress, is it possible for the Academy to borrow La Brava for a bit? Espionage and Command courses might benefit from hacking and general computer lessons. 

Mr. Compress: Oh she‚Äôll be positively delighted by the prospect! Just tell the students to ignore it when she starts talking about how Gentle is the best man ever every fifteen minutes.

Kurogiri: Gentle is free to join too, I know first hand how dangerous (and unpredictable) of a combatant he is. Having the students experience fighting a diverse cast of opponents will be extremely useful to them. Not telling them what his quirk is and having them figure it out on their own sounds like a good idea for an exercise, too. 

Legion: Great, so now that we have these done: the candidates?

Kurogiri: Naturally! The first one is Toxicity, of the Combat course. 17 years old, victim of villainous quirk designation and her own quirk side-effects. Her entire body is to a various degree poisonous. Contact with skin causes really nasty hives, bodily fluids cause chemical burns on contact, breath can knock someone unconscious when up close, and her nails and teeth are pretty much lethal when they pierce the skin.   

Kurogiri: She was genuinely trying her best in school to make up for it. High grades before she escaped her home due to abuse. No friends (no one wanted to befriend a living chemical weapon), just acquaintances. On the street fell into a bad crowd, joined a small gang, and ended up involved in several assault cases (one victim died of her poison, although this was another gangster and THEY started it). 

Mindscrew: I want her. Sounds like a relatable case AND the Vanguard needs some reinforcements after the Training Camp mess. 

Kurogiri: Very well. Second one is Non of the Espionage course. 16 years old, victim of his own quirk. Parents died in a hero vs villain battle when he was two years old, foster parents failed to do their job properly. His quirk allows him to temporarily render himself as a non-entity, making him unable to interact with the world (he can move around though), but also making everyone around himself unable to perceive his existence (this includes all known sensors and alarms). 

Kurogiri: Lack of control over his quirk while a child (together with lack of action from his foster parents) made him develop mental issues centered around doubting his own existence. He started stealing various things (in order to make people react to the disappearance of things, to prove his own existence), but also seems to have a major issue with heroes (his parents apparently died due to the hero screwing things up). He has been visiting one of those unofficial psychologists available to the villains, but it‚Äôs just a month, so not much progress yet. 

Mr. Compress: Issue with heroes, steals things AND can pop up wherever and whenever he wants with some prep time? I love him already! Gimme. 

Legion: Sorry to ask after Mr. Compress asked already, but‚Ä¶ @Vantablack, any counteroffer?

Vantablack: No. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, an extremely useful quirk, but Exchange has to deal with a lot of secrets. When you steal cash, you just have to hand it over. When you steal information, you can easily hand it over too much - I‚Äôm not risking it with someone with mental issues. 

Legion: Fair.

Kurogiri: Very well, I‚Äôll talk about the payment for that on a private chat, Mr. Compress. 

Kurogiri: The third one is Juggernaut of the Combat course. Twenty-one years old. Born to a family of small-time villains, self-educated himself through the internet apparently. 2,3m tall, looks (tbh) as if Gigantomachia had a child. 

Legion: I hate this very idea. 

Mr. Compress: Wait, Gigantomachia still exists?

Sunset: ? who that

Legion: You remember me explaining my family situation to you? Well, Gigantomachia is my father‚Äôs old personal mass destruction weapon. If my intel is correct, he is still hanging around some forest with an antique radio, waiting for All for One to contact him and tell him to destroy a prefecture or two. 

Mr. Compress: Oh great. The nightmares begin anew.

Legion: Wait until I tell you that we‚Äôll eventually have to pick Machia up because I DON‚ÄôT want PLF to do that. 

Mr. Compress: My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. 

Legion: Ancient memes, of course. 

Legion: I should be surprised, but I‚Äôm not. 

Kurogiri: Juggernaut‚Äôs quirk makes him partially ignore Newton‚Äôs Third Law. For those who missed out on physics - when he applies his force to something, he feels no rebound. So he can punch a stone boulder for days, without his fists aching at the slightest. He can also entirely negate any impacts for as long as he moves in their direction when they occur (as his quirk perceives them as ‚Äòreactions‚Äô to his movement).

Kurogiri: He once had a meeting with a speeding truck. He made a step towards it right before impact, resulting in him being unharmed (clothes were damaged though), while the truck was totaled. 

Kurogiri: His police record includes mostly general thuggery. I‚Äôd have counted him as a standard thug and not given him lots of thoughts, but as I said, self-educated. Good enough to ace the written portion of the entrance exam. He doesn‚Äôt speak a lot and seems to embrace the image of the mindless thug, but he is way smarter than people give him credit for. 

Mindscrew: Sounds fun. And we might need someone to fight in melee properly. Vanguard Action Squad is interested. 

Kurogiri: Wonderful! The fourth one is Awoo of the Combat Course. 18 years old (for a few days now). Not said officially, but bits of her backstory seem to suggest that she was born as a result of ISP organized riot (so, child of rape). Abandoned completely when six years old, and even earlier it had to be rather harsh for her, considering the fact that she has been extensively disfigured with some form of acid. Was scavenging for food for several years, before some small-time villain group picked her up. 

Kurogiri: Complex mutant quirk, of wolf-variety. Fast reflexes, excellent tracking skills, incredibly wonderful sense of smell. Rather mean fangs. Can move quietly when needed, and has an excellent sense of direction. 

Mindscrew: Can I see a picture of her?

Mindscrew: Ouch. 

Kurogiri: Yes. Ouch. Rather extreme issues with her own looks and extremely low self-esteem. Capable of talking, but appears to be selectively mute (if she is even a tiny bit stressed, she stops being able to talk). Loner. She has skills, but getting her to function might be‚Ä¶ an achievement. Honestly I‚Äôm not sure where to send her for internships, so I‚Äôm mentioning her here.

Mindscrew: Relatable backstory AND I want to see Decay‚Äôs reaction to getting a wolfgirl to the party. Win-win. I‚Äôll take her. 

Legion: You are really crazy with this recruitment drive.

Mindscrew: Need to bulk up for the PLF war.

Legion: Fair.

Kurogiri: The last one, I believe, will be of interest to Legion. Villain name Rabbit, 16 years old (but looks like 13-14 at best). Command Course. Claims to have an analysis quirk, but at this point I‚Äôm about 70% sure that he is actually quirkless (but if so, then he is good at pretending). 

Kurogiri: He was bullied in school so he‚Ä¶ Well, he destroyed the school.

Legion: he what

Sunset: go get ‚Äòem, Rabbit!

Mindscrew: Holy shit I like him already

Kurogiri: Didn‚Äôt you read his file? @Legion

Legion: I think I did, but I was mostly focused on the quirks so I skimmed the rest. What did he do? 

Kurogiri: Well, he placed surveillance in a handful of places in the school, caught the teachers enabling his bullying (and of several other people) on the tape plus the director of the school doing some questionable things in his office (she was a minor, dammit). Unleashed all of that on the internet one evening‚Ä¶ right after setting the school on fire. Half of it came down as a result, and the faculty was in too much trouble to bother repairing it. He also blew up the house of the main bully with makeshift explosives (wounding the bully in the process, but I‚Äôm not sure if that was the plan). Several other bullies (not only his, but also those bullying others that he found out through the surveillance) got either the recordings or some shameful bits of their past published as well.

Kurogiri: Hide his tracks quite well, but not well enough for Sir Nighteye to not track him. He is a bit of an escape artist (bullies useful for once) so he managed to escape the hero that came to arrest him, but he had nowhere to go so he ended up doing some small-time thievery to survive on the streets. Eventually I caught wind of him through Giran. 

Kurogiri: Anxiety and very low self-esteem, but he seems to have a knack for information analysis and is highly intelligent. Also, coincidentally, appears to be friends with Toxicity and Juggernaut. 

Kurogiri: Though it feels more like they are some sort of Rabbit Protection Squad, to quote a certain someone. 

Legion: You know what, I like him already. Having an assistant might be helpful. I‚Äôm way too overworked. And separating friends isn‚Äôt my thing to do. 

 

***

 

After about a month in the Villain Academy, Rabbit (they didn‚Äôt use their real names in the school) has almost managed to stop hyperventilating on certain occasions. What‚Äôs more, the number of occasions warranting this has also decreased. 

It was‚Ä¶ odd. 

Rabbit didn‚Äôt really plan to become a villain. Technically he wasn‚Äôt one. He didn‚Äôt use a quirk in his revenge plan, so he was a criminal at best. The law was so unreasonable sometimes. But somehow, he was now officially a D-Rank villain, and he had no idea what to do with that. 

He agreed to the whole ‚ÄòVillain Academy‚Äô thing that Giran guy told him about because he heard that it was a guaranteed accommodation and a way of disappearing under the radar. He was way too hungry and sore after sleeping in the alleyways and abandoned buildings to care. 

He was ready to come to school again, if it meant food and roof under his head. He didn‚Äôt expect this school to be so‚Ä¶ different. 

The homeroom teacher looked scary and was an A-Rank villain (he introduced himself as such). But he also helped Rabbit when he had a panic attack, and got some medications for him that make his anxiety lessen slightly! And not only did he say that he is there for Rabbit if he wants to talk, but he actually WAS there when he asked for it. 

It was incredibly confusing. Even his parents didn‚Äôt treat him like that. Always working, mostly ignoring him after the diagnosis and so on. And that was a VILLAIN. That made absolutely no sense. 

Other students were, somehow, way more scary than the teacher. Some even more than his old bullies. They didn‚Äôt do anything to him, though. Kurogiri-sensei said that he doesn‚Äôt care what they do to each other after graduation, but if someone does anything to anyone else while in his school without the other side‚Äôs consent, he is going to get nasty. 

He ended up having to prove it. The ‚Äòget nasty‚Äô meant getting a personal CQC lesson with STAIN. THE HERO KILLER. The student in question returned looking like he just saw God. After visiting Him in person. He was limping for days afterwards. 

It was even more confusing. 

The weirdest part was the fact that Rabbit wasn‚Äôt alone anymore. He had two‚Ä¶ friends? He wasn‚Äôt sure himself. One was a loud and way too touchy girl. Toxicity. Black hair with strands of hair in various colours (she had some blue, and some pink ones) and colourful nails. Several small pink stars tattooed under her eyes. Large, wireless headphones (of course, colourful, mostly pink and blue) on either her head or neck. 

Clothes varied between the day, but were always in those two colours. Blue and pink. Typically in some strange mixes. The common elements were the surgical mask on her face and really long gloves (which let her touch people without it being‚Ä¶ pretty bad). 

The other one was Juggernaut. He was large. Massive. Like twice the Rabbit‚Äôs size. Was wearing a tank top and had really rough facial features. His chin was practically square. His skin was coarse, like it couldn‚Äôt decide if it was skin or stone.

He didn‚Äôt talk a lot. But he was hanging out with them. 

In all honesty, Toxicity did 90% of talking in the group. Rabbit was responsible for 9%, and Juggernaut for 1%, although also for something like 99% of grunts. He was‚Ä¶ well, a bit odd. 

(they would still leave him if they new about his quirk, or to be exact, the lack of it)

And the lessons were super interesting! No boring math stuff, or biology and so on. They learned how to break in, how to break out (he was awesome in both things), how to fight (Rabbit really enjoyed it, actually, he chose staff because of the reach thing), how to stay undetected and so on! They learned some physics, but it was mostly practical things (like, ‚Äòhow to properly block a fire/electricity quirk‚Äô by taking advantage of the laws of physics‚Äô). 

It was great! 

(he wondered how long it would last, he had his own room now and the food was good, especially when that Mischief lady prepared it for them all, everything was going too great)

Kurogiri entered the classroom. Those that weren‚Äôt already on their seats (Rabbit was, he felt oddly safe in it), quickly headed towards them. He WAS an A-Rank villain, even if he was nice. No one in the room was ranked higher than a D-Rank. Not the same weight class. 

A lot of others were angry at the concept of going to school. Many agreed because their villainous parents told them to. Some because of‚Ä¶ well, Rabbit had no idea why some of them agreed to it all. Non, for example, acted like he wasn‚Äôt sure himself. They didn‚Äôt talk a lot, he was a bit gloomy and sometimes vanished for an entire class (although apparently he was still there, his quirk was awesome). 

It didn‚Äôt take Kurogiri a long time to persuade them to listen to him and the other teachers. They were all learning super interesting things, and without a notable risk of the heroes catching them up while training. The whole school was in some building in the middle of nowhere. Just trees wherever you looked. Even the food and so on were warped in. 

Rabbit really thought that it was a cool idea. School like that.

‚ÄúWell, today I have a special announcement to you.‚Äù Kurogiri says when the class goes silent. ‚ÄúYou have worked during the past month to improve your foundations. As a result, the Academy decided that it‚Äôs the time for you to get some practical experience. In other words, from now on, you‚Äôre going to spend half of every month as interns in various villainous organizations. The other half will have you back here.‚Äù 

Oh no.

Oh no no no no.

Rabbit doesn‚Äôt want that! He‚Äôll probably get to some scary people, and he doesn‚Äôt want that! Not without Toxicity and Juggernaut! People will probably be mean to him, and they‚Äôll find out that he is quirkless, and‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI must ask you to keep the details of your internships secret from your classmates.‚Äù Kurogiri continues. ‚ÄúYou will all receive a sealed letter with the name of the organization, your handler within it and details of when you are supposed to be ready for the warp. Pack your toothbrushes and everything else you need, just not too much. Not everyone likes that.‚Äù Kurogiri sighs. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre free to share whom you intern with with your friends, but that‚Äôs EVERYTHING that you are allowed to tell them, got it?‚Äù 

Rabbit is terrified. 

‚ÄúBe aware.‚Äù Kurogiri continues. ‚ÄúThat the villains in question are forbidden to hurt you. Do not consider this an invitation to be disobedient. You are to listen to them. If you screw something up seriously, you‚Äôll be returned to the school and punished by me. We‚Äôve made sure to choose villains that should agree with your personal life histories, so those of you who abhor killing do not have to be afraid of having to kill people. And now‚Ä¶‚Äù 

He calls them out one by one, handing each of them a letter and letting them return to their seats. Rabbit is almost unconscious from the stress. He barely notices Toxicity giving him a reassuring smile. He does notice when he sits down and his two friends come along (Rabbit was the last one to pick his letter, Kurogiri left the room and students are doing it too). Toxicity grabbed his hand and is giving it a squeeze. 

‚ÄúIt will be alright!‚Äù She says. He doesn‚Äôt see half of her face, but he is certain she is smiling. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, it can‚Äôt be that bad! Kurogiri surely picked suitable people for the internships, you know him. Big softie. And he really likes you!‚Äù Juggernauts grunts approvingly. 

‚ÄúY‚Ä¶ you sure?‚Äù Rabbit wants to believe, but doesn‚Äôt. 

(Kurogiri is pretending, they are all pretending like his old ‚Äòfriends‚Äô from school, it‚Äôs too early for them to announce that to him, they will wait until he trusts them completely and then backstab him, he just knows it)

‚ÄúSure. Let‚Äôs open it one by one, alright?‚Äù She asks, and he agrees. He tends to agree to a lot of things. Few days ago Toxicity told him that they would start a gang together, with him as their brains and he agreed to that too. He was‚Ä¶ melty when stressed. Then again, it wasn‚Äôt that bad of a prospect. 

She opens her letter first. She gasps audibly. 

‚ÄúOh my... ‚Äú She stares at the paper, as if she didn‚Äôt believe in its existence. ‚ÄúMindscrew. Vanguard Action Squad of the League of Villains. Warp tomorrow, at noon. Wow! I thought it would be some small-time gangster or something.‚Äù 

Rabbit is happy for her. That‚Äôs an A-Rank villain! They don‚Äôt have an internet in the school (only some internal network to chat about things, most likely monitored by someone), but they all know about people like that! 

Kurogiri is a part of the League of Villains. She will be with their teacher. Rabbit is torn between being happy and jealous. He wants to be the former, but the latter keeps slipping in. He hates himself for it. 

Juggernaut is the next one. He opens his letter, and then shows them the contents. 

Mindscrew. Vanguard Action Squad of the League Villains. Warp tomorrow at noon. 

His two friends will intern together. He is happy for them, but inside, he is crying. It requires his entire willpower to not start crying on the outside, too. 

(they will get even friendlier with each other, they will forget about him, he will be alone again, everyone will hate him again and‚Ä¶) 

‚ÄúCan I?‚Äù Toxicity asks, and points towards his letter. She can see he isn‚Äôt the shape to open it up right now. He nods scarcely (the tears do not come out in the process, somehow). She opens the letter and freezes, her eyes wide. 

‚ÄúHoly shit, Rabbit!‚Äù She laughs. He is even more confused. Juggernaut stares down at them. Toxicity finally turns the letter towards him, letting him read its contents, and‚Ä¶

Legion. League of Villains. Warp tomorrow at noon. 

Rabbit stares. His entire fear and sadness evaporate in the instant, leaving only confusion behind. 

Legion? THE Legion? That SSS-Rank? They don‚Äôt have the internet here, but they do have the television. So he heard of the Training Camp battle and the resulting changes to the rankings. He is like‚Ä¶ one of the four most dangerous villains in the country! He‚Äôs like one of the Top Four Heroes! Why would he want to have anything to do with Rabbit?! 

He ends up crying, of course. Juggernaut gives him a very light hug (doing his best to not break him). Toxicity does it right after him, and while she accidentally makes a bit of his skin itch for hours, he barely notices it. 

He doesn‚Äôt notice Kurogiri smiling at him through the minuscule warp gate he left in the school. 
Notes:

    Rabbit is here! Ahh, I was waiting for this moment. He is like canon Izuku (or, honestly, this story Izuku), except with less quirks and more anxiety. Unfortunately he is a bit too young and anxious here, so no ships for him, people. Saying that before someone has a dumb idea that he is Miruko's mysterious ship, she is to him kinda what All Might is to canon Izuku before they meet - idol, though in Rabbit's case because she is strong and confident, and that's something he lacks. Ya lot wouldn't ship Izuku with All Might, amiright?

    [Yes I'm 99,99% sure someone did that, but please do not enlighten me about it, that 0,01% saves mental health]

    Awoo is also, well, almost here. And boy if recruiting her to make fun of Tenko won't be Mindscrew's most failed joke of all times.

    [Also Kurogiri is compulsive Papagiri confirmed]

Chapter Text

They all gathered in the room used by Kurogiri for his teleports soon before noon came. Each in their normal outfits (there was no standard uniform for the Villain Academy). Toxicity and Rabbit had backpacks with their things, while Juggernaut was carrying his stuff in a bag. 

Odd, Rabbit decided. Toxicity decided to talk about random things (mostly about how excited she was to meet the League), and Rabbit and Juggernaut listened. 

Kurogiri arrived together with another student. Awoo. The disfigured girl. Rabbit hated himself for it, but he couldn‚Äôt look straight at her. Her eyes, nose and mouth were miraculously spared, but the rest was disfigured horribly with some acid. Rabbit still remembers having nightmares after he saw it for the first time. 

‚ÄúThe four of you will intern together in the League of Villains.‚Äù Kurogiri announces. Awoo looks away. They don‚Äôt look at her, they know she doesn‚Äôt like it. ‚ÄúI recommended you myself. Please do not make me regret that.‚Äù 

Rabbit will do his best! He doesn‚Äôt say it aloud, but his face says it all. 

The black cloud devours them whole. Rabbit opens his eyes in an unfamiliar room. It‚Äôs like a large living room, full of couches, two different large TVs, and‚Ä¶ a bar? It‚Äôs mostly empty, No one behind the bar.

There is only one person in the room. Messy hair, bags under the eyes. Wearing what looks like a set of purple pajamas. He should certainly sleep more. He is sitting on one of the couches, drinking what looks like coffee, but puts it down and raises up when he sees them arrive.

‚ÄúKurogiri.‚Äù The tired guy says. He doesn‚Äôt seem much older than Rabbit is. 16-17 years, maybe? Knowing that a lot of League is composed of young people is one thing, but seeing it is‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSo, that‚Äôs our new interns, huh?‚Äù 

He measures them with his eyes. Rabbit is certain he didn‚Äôt measure up to whatever the bar was. 

‚ÄúNice, we‚Äôre going to get along just fine.‚Äù He finally adds. Then he yawns. ‚ÄúSorry for that, it's been a long night.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhere is Legion?‚Äù Kurogiri asks. 

‚ÄúLate.‚Äù Tired man replies. ‚ÄúNegotiating with some yakuza clan. Took Dabi, Decay and Stain with him for intimidation. Vantablack is doing something with Spinner and Vampire, Gremlin is doing her own things‚Ä¶ so just me. I‚Äôll give them all the introductory talk, alright? Go scare some students straight.‚Äù Kurogiri mumbles something and vanishes. Tired man turns towards them. ‚ÄúAlright, kids. Name‚Äôs Hitoshi Shinsou, aka Mindscrew. Three of you are going to be working under me for the next two weeks. The last one will be working with Legion, but we are all living in one building, so let‚Äôs get along regardless, alright?‚Äù 

Toxicity nods fervently. Awoo looks away. Juggernaut is unreadable. Rabbit shrinks internally. Mindscrew sure, might not have looked intimidating (and was Kurogiri-sensei‚Äôs friend, apparently), but he was still an A-Rank! 

‚ÄúAlright, follow me.‚Äù Mindscrew adds. Then yawns again.

Rabbit and his friends weren‚Äôt sure what they expected from the headquarters of THE League of Villains. What they got felt like a school dorm (at least to Rabbit who lived for a while in one). 

Each of them was assigned a small room on the same floor, right next to the quarters of the remaining members of the League. Toxicity was overjoyed to hear that her room was equipped with some special air filtration system, meaning that she didn‚Äôt passively make air inside toxic simply by sleeping there for a few hours. So she could get visitors in the mornings.  

Then they were told to leave their stuff there (they did), and then they followed Mindscrew on a trip around the building.

The building was large. Two levels of underground - lower one included prison (almost never used, according to Mindscrew) and Gremlin‚Äôs workshop (off-limits, unless accompanied by her). The upper one had a large combat training area, a gym and some storage room. 

Then the surface level (probably) with the living room and the bar. Above it the level for the quarters of the members. Then the floor with the Legion's office, official meeting room, some planning area, and some unspecified archive. 

No windows. Rabbit has no idea where they are. He doesn‚Äôt even see an entrance door anywhere. It‚Äôs confusing. The League must be using warps for everything and‚Ä¶ well, that explains that nobody caught on to them. 

Kurogiri has to be a massive asset. All he has to do is to teleport League members back and from various towns to buy groceries and do their operations. Due to that, the heroes can‚Äôt even find out which city the League‚Äôs headquarters is located in. 

‚ÄúAwoo, Toxicity and Juggernaut are going to join my personal combat party.‚Äù Mindscrew eventually announces. ‚ÄúWe lost one member during the Training Camp War and another isn‚Äôt living here anymore and might drop out. So the Vanguard Action Squad is down to me, Dabi, Decay and Spinner, unless Mustard decides to stay. Dabi is the Endeavor‚Äôs son from Hosu, the one with extensive scars. He is my second-in-command. You can expect to have a lot of free time, although be aware that we‚Äôre going to train you to hell and back. Rabbit is an exception.‚Äù 

Rabbit is afraid of being an exception. 

‚ÄúLegion said that he is overworked and in need of an assistant.‚Äù Mindscrew says. ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt be fully exempt from combat training, but expect to spend a lot of time on the top floor. Legion should call you when he comes back. Also we have an operation scheduled for the next week, so don‚Äôt slack off with your training, got it?‚Äù Wave of nods. ‚ÄúGreat. You‚Äôre free to lounge around for today. Gremlin is tinkering with some special support items for you, consider those the welcome gifts. Feel free to drop by the bar when Kurogiri ends sending students to internships, that‚Äôs his joint. Just don‚Äôt enter the kitchen or touch the alcohol without his permission. Should be some food left in the living room if you get hungry.‚Äù He yawns. ‚ÄúJesus, I need a nap. You‚Äôre all dismissed for now.‚Äù 

They spend the next two hours in Rabbit‚Äôs room, for some reason (minus Awoo, who vanished in hers). Mostly talking about how weird the whole thing was. Eventually Mindscrew (now marginally less tired) knocked on the door and said that Rabbit is supposed to go to the top floor.

 

***

 

The kid was small. 

That was what Izuku thought first when he saw Rabbit entering his office. Of course, it was just a slightly hypocritical statement. The ‚Äòkid‚Äô was only a bit more than one year younger than him AND Izuku wasn‚Äôt particularly big. 

Rabbit (his real name not really important for anything) was facing steadily decreasing chances of some last, final growth spurt that would make him grow to a sensible height. Izuku was about 165cm tall, Rabbit didn‚Äôt grow up to 150 and was‚Ä¶ well, scrawny. 

Their hair was similarly messy, though Rabbit‚Äôs was black. His eyes were black too. 

Did dad have a secret affair and Izuku just met his long lost brother? Highly unlikely. Mom would find out. And then Izuku wouldn‚Äôt have a father. For all his powerful defensive quirks, Izuku doubts that even All for One could survive having all of his internal organs suddenly exit his body. 

Izuku points towards a lone chair in front of the desk. Rabbit hurries to it, while Izuku sits on the verge of the desk. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre probably wondering why I wanted you as an intern, hmm?‚Äù Izuku asks and Rabbit quietly nods. ‚ÄúWell, I read about what you did with your school. And you managed to impress me. That was some excellent planning and very good execution. You have‚Ä¶‚Äù Rabbit seems to shake his head ever so slightly. Was it even done consciously? ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

That startles the intern. 

‚ÄúEr, no, I just, uhm‚Ä¶‚Äù Rabbit takes a deep breath. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt execute it well, I messed up. My bully shouldn‚Äôt be at home when I set up the bomb, that was‚Ä¶‚Äù 

Izuku laughs. Rabbit, once again, looks like one of the animals that he was named after it was suddenly enveloped in the car's headlights. ‚ÄòStartled‚Äô is putting it lightly. 

‚ÄúYou should have seen me during the attack on the USJ.‚Äù Legion replies calmly. ‚ÄúEverything went to hell when All Might arrived instead of Thunderbolt, and then almost did it again when Nedzu forced Thunderbolt to arrive alongside the faculty. It‚Äôs a miracle and a lot of improvisation that we managed to pull it off.‚Äù Rabbit stares at him in shock. ‚ÄúFor your first operation this is more than an acceptable amount of mess-ups, Rabbit. You have lots of room for growth, and I‚Äôm really looking forward to a capable assistant. But‚Ä¶ I need you to be honest with me.‚Äù Izuku leans forward a bit and adopts a serious face. ‚ÄúWhat is your quirk?‚Äù 

It is best to start unfucking the mess that Rabbit‚Äôs mind is posthaste. Legion‚Äôs words almost give him a heart attack. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ uhm, it‚Äôs an analysis one and it‚Ä¶‚Äù No, it mostly certainly isn‚Äôt. Izuku sighs. 

‚ÄúYou do realize that you are talking to a late-bloomer?‚Äù He asks, and Rabbit freezes. ‚ÄúI was eight years old when my childhood friend told me to take a swan dive off the roof and pray for a quirk in my next life. Sunset is a close friend of mine, and the Quirkless Equality Movement was born thanks to my money and support. I‚Äôm not going to judge. But I want you to be honest with me.‚Äù 

Silence. Few long seconds of it. Finally, Rabbit relents. On his face, a death mask - he expects to be berated for that. 

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm quirkless.‚Äù He looks down. The floor appears to be oddly fascinating to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry that I lied to you.‚Äù Legion decides that the kid is about to cry on him, and he needs to move fast. 

Notice-Me-Not should work well. It‚Äôs not flashy (then again, the kid doesn‚Äôt need flashy), but Rabbit urgently needs a confidence boost. And, let‚Äôs be honest, he is one day going to be a terrifying person. Legion is confident that he won‚Äôt be overtaken, but he loves the idea of having someone he can converse about his plans and strategies on more or less equal level. 

Nedzu and Sir Nighteye play in the same league, but it‚Äôs not like he can talk about his plans with them. They both have the fields where they specialize in, making them a terrifying duo when they team-up. Izuku wants something similar. 

‚ÄúGreat.‚Äù He says, startling the kid even more. ‚ÄúListen, I would like to use my quirk on you. It works differently than media speculates. No pain unless you try to resist what I‚Äôll do, but if it works well‚Ä¶ you should be super happy. Are you alright with that?‚Äù 

He isn‚Äôt going to FORCE the procedure on the kid without asking him about that first. He isn‚Äôt repeating the One for All business, learning on the mistakes of others is the only thing better than learning on your mistakes. 

And he is going to take it back if the kid reacts negatively. He isn‚Äôt his father. He just doesn‚Äôt want to explain the quirk transfer thing without proof that it is truly possible. 

Rabbit nods. He would probably agree to everything right now. Izuku needs to work on his confidence and self-assertiveness. But not now. 

Izuku stands up, approaches Rabbit and puts his hand on his head. Then he activates All for One. Some static discharges in the air, and‚Ä¶ 

Static discharges shouldn‚Äôt be a thing. Izuku stretches his consciousness into Rabbit‚Äôs body‚Ä¶ and almost laughs at what he discovers inside. He retreats and deactivates All for One. There is no need for it. 

‚ÄúWell, Rabbit.‚Äù Legion takes a step back and smiles. ‚ÄúI have some news for you. My actual quirk is a bit special in that it can‚Ä¶ influence quirks, so to say. I‚Äôm going to have to ask you to keep that a secret. Even from your friends, although this will not last for long.‚Äù He and his friends will most likely join the League. They have potential and fit the mindsets oh so common in it. 

‚ÄúIs‚Ä¶ is it like the Quirk Thief?‚Äù Rabbit perks up and asks. Izuku marvels at the intuition. ‚ÄúErr, sorry for asking, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ quirks influencing quirks are extremely rare, and I saw you on the TV using another quirk, and the Quirk Thief, I know it‚Äôs an urban legend but I think it‚Äôs a possible one and...‚Äù He starts mumbling. Izuku decides to ask his dad if he really didn‚Äôt have any affair because holy shit this kid even acts like Izuku used to. 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Izuku decides to admit it. ‚ÄúMy quirk is much more limited than the one from the legend, but to a limited degree it works similarly. Can‚Äôt go into details yet. Now, the fun part is that the red discharges shouldn‚Äôt be there. They are a sign that my quirk managed to interface with another quirk.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnother quirk?‚Äù Rabbit asks. It‚Äôs hard to say if he already came to the right conclusion. He is smart enough to do that, but smarts aren‚Äôt enough to overwhelm years of mental conditioning by stupid and abusive people. 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúYours. You are not quirkless, Rabbit.‚Äù 

The kid stares at him blankly. For several long seconds. Then the hurricane of emotions overtakes his face. 

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ I have the additional toe joint and‚Ä¶‚Äù Izuku raises his hand and interrupts him. 

‚ÄúSo do I. And so did Eclipse. And so do other late-bloomers‚Ä¶ like us.‚Äù He sees realization dawning on Rabbit‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúYours is still dormant, but almost fully developed. I suspect that it will awaken before your next birthday. I can‚Äôt say what sort of quirk it will be, however.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMy quirk.‚Äù Rabbit mouths. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have a quirk.‚Äù 

Izuku isn‚Äôt surprised when Rabbit ends up breaking into tears. He closes the distance and gives him a hug, before muttering some reassurances. Being hugged by an SSS-Rank villain is probably NOT what Rabbit expected to happen that day. 

Eventually Izuku manages to calm him down. He always has some tissues hidden on him. He doesn‚Äôt cry THAT much anymore (he did it after Zealot died, but in private), but some things stuck to him. 

‚ÄúT...thank you.‚Äù Rabbit is much calmer. But still shaken. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry for crying.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to.‚Äù Izuku shrugs. ‚ÄúYou felt like you needed to cry, so you did. It‚Äôs alright. But now we have to talk about some things. Namely, what to do with your quirk.‚Äù Rabbit‚Äôs head perks up and his eyes navigate towards Izuku‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúI know two people who accidentally killed someone when their quirk kicked in first. One of them is a member of the League. Late-bloomers never get quirks beneath Class Four, this means that depending on what your quirk will be, it might be lethal. So I need you to promise me two things.‚Äù He raises a finger. ‚ÄúFirst - you are going to message me if you feel anything out of the ordinary. I won‚Äôt be angry at you if you call me and it turns out to be a stomach ache or something like that. If you feel something that you aren‚Äôt familiar with, call me immediately. I am an expert quirk analyst, so I should be able to discern what quirk we‚Äôre dealing with without having to risk my life. Got it?‚Äù 

Rabbit nods fervently. 

‚ÄúGreat. Now the second promise. ‚ÄúHe raises another finger. ‚ÄúI need you to tell your friends that you are quirkless, that you‚Äôre going to be a late-bloomer and about the first activation problems.‚Äù 

Rabbit instantly shrinks. It‚Äôs like seeing All Might deflate (although it‚Äôs no longer a thing after the Training Camp). It‚Äôs almost painful to see it happen to someone already this small. 

‚ÄúB‚Ä¶ but they will hate me.‚Äù He says quietly, and once again towards the floor. ‚ÄúI lied to them. And I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm still quirkless.‚Äù

Old habits die hard. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôd be surprised if they didn‚Äôt suspect that you are quirkless already. And if they still didn‚Äôt ask you, it means they are giving you a space and waiting for you to admit it on your own.‚Äù Izuku replies honestly. There are reasons why quirkless rarely manage to pretend that they are quirked for long, as it‚Äôs not toe-joint. Mental quirks almost always have some form of tells for activation, and it‚Äôs hard to fake those. Mindscrew‚Äôs quirk is unique in that it lacks those. ‚ÄúBut you have to tell them for their sake. The other person with traumatic first activation killed their father, because their quirk was lethal on touch and said father tried to hug them to calm them when the quirk kicked in. Toxicity and Juggernaut have to know not to approach you when this happens, even if said activation will be painful to you. It‚Äôs better to tell them the truth instead of trying to add more lies.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I guess.‚Äù Izuku can see Rabbit biting his lip a bit. Really nervous that one. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it today.‚Äù 

Good. That settles it. 

‚ÄúWonderful.‚Äù Izuku nods. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôll be all for today. Don‚Äôt stay late, we‚Äôre going to have lots of work tomorrow. Internships are going to be the HARDER half of your education, trust me on that. Now shoo.‚Äù 

Rabbit stands up, bows slightly, utters some ‚Äòthank you and goodbye‚Äô (if Izuku hears it correctly) and quickly vanishes from the room. 

Izuku can‚Äôt be THAT scary, right? 

He pulls out his phone and sends a private message to Kurogiri.

 

Legion: I absolutely love my new intern. Your choice of students is simply flawless and I love it. 

Kurogiri: Did you give him a quirk? I suspect that this was your plan to get him friendly if you decided that you like him. 

Legion: Oh? 

Kurogiri: I‚Äôm having a bit of an issue with you not mentioning that to me. 

Kurogiri: Rabbit is MY student first and foremost. 

Legion: Sorry. I‚Äôll talk about things like that with you in the future. Got a bit too involved. It‚Äôs like seeing myself in the mirror! Just with more anxiety and less quirks. I really should ask my father if he didn‚Äôt have an affair. It‚Äôs like having a younger brother all of a sudden! 

Legion: I‚Äôm terrified by what happens when Vampire spots him, ugh. She‚Äôll probably try to get him adopted and I‚Äôm not fighting a custody war with you. 

Kurogiri: ‚Ä¶ please, stop with the adoption talks. I‚Äôm no one‚Äôs parent. 

Legion: You are almost everyone‚Äôs parent, just finally get used to that and stop pretending otherwise.  

Legion: Also I didn‚Äôt give him a quirk. I didn‚Äôt have to. 

Kurogiri: He actually had an analysis one?

Legion: Nope. He is a late-bloomer in the making. His quirk should awaken in the next few months. 

Kurogiri: What quirk class? You should have been able to find that out if you interfaced with him with All for One. 

Kurogiri: I remember your father saying that the classes are all rather distinct when seen through his quirk.

Legion: Class-Six. Like All for One, One for All and Eri‚Äôs Rewind. 

Kurogiri: ‚Ä¶ Oh. 

Legion: I said I love your choice of interns, didn‚Äôt I? 

 

Rabbit was far enough for Legion to dare to start laughing loudly. Oh he was looking forward to the internships just so much! 

 

***

 

Rabbit returns to his room with a complicated mixture of overwhelming happiness and fright. Legion told him that he is going to have a quirk! And most likely a powerful one! It‚Äôs like a dream come true. He always wanted to have one, to be able to stand up to bullies, to not be intimidated by them so easily‚Ä¶ he only lashed out (with quirkless means) when he finally understood that it‚Äôs not going to happen. 

But it is going to happen! He trusts Legion. He isn‚Äôt sure why. He is conscious enough to know that it might be because he really wants to trust his words. He really wants to have a quirk. 

Fright is because he will have to talk with his friends about all of that.

(and they‚Äôll stop being his friends he knows it he lied to them ever since they met for the first time)

There is also a hint of fascination in him. What exactly did Legion try to do to him with his quirk? He didn‚Äôt say it, but‚Ä¶ similar to the quirk thief but more limited? 

Could Legion GRANT quirks to others? And take them? Was he planning to give one to Rabbit before he discovered that he already had one? Is that why his quirk ‚Äòinterfaced‚Äô with Rabbit‚Äôs? Because he was planning to give him one, but then discovered that his quirk has something to potentially take from Rabbit?

He said that Sunset is his friend. Didn‚Äôt Sunset pop up right after Eclipse vanished, with a quirk that was almost identical to hers? 

Rabbit panics internally. He is certain that he wasn‚Äôt supposed to even suspect that. But‚Ä¶ but if that‚Äôs true, and Legion is a Quirk Thief‚Ä¶ is he planning to steal Rabbit‚Äôs once it awakens? Rabbit doesn‚Äôt want that! He doesn‚Äôt know what his quirk is going to be (he hopes for some size alteration or strengthening one, something to make people no longer look down on him), but he knows that he doesn‚Äôt want to lose it!

(Legion acts like he likes Rabbit, why would he like him if not for his quirk, he probably knew beforehand, Kurogiri most likely found out and told him and they are both together in this)

Legion said next few months. Should be enough time to find out what sort of person he is. If Rabbit decides that it‚Äôs a possibility, he‚Äôll vanish. He is good at that. Lack of exit in this place will not stop him if Legion is a danger to him. Besides, it might awaken at school and that should be easier to escape from. 

‚ÄúUhm, Rabbit?‚Äù He hears Toxicity‚Äôs voice, and he is rapidly brought back to Reality. ‚ÄúYou told us that you have something to say to us, but now you are mumbling. What is it?‚Äù 

Oh. Oh he completely forgot about all that. He promised to tell them the truth. They are in his small room. Juggernaut feels like he is filling it whole with his presence. Rabbit is sitting on his bed, Toxicity on the chair, and Juggernaut is standing next to her. 

(he is in the right position to stop him escaping through the door, this is a trap, he knows that)

(don‚Äôt hyperventilate, don‚Äôt make them know how weak and panicked you are, they will attack you when you‚Äôre at the weakest)

‚ÄúS...sorry.‚Äù He is doing his best not to mumble. ‚ÄúUhm, the thing is‚Ä¶ I lied to you, I lied to everyone for like a month, and‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre quirkless.‚Äù Juggernaut says. It‚Äôs a rare occurrence, but when he does say something, it‚Äôs always important. 

Rabbit is surprised. Like a normal rabbit facing a car after jumping onto the road at night. 

(the results will be just as bloody to him)

He is trying to form a reply, but his voice fails him. He just nods. 

‚ÄúOh, so you‚Äôre finally admitting!‚Äù Toxicity laughs and Rabbit‚Äôs eyes are drawn to her. ‚ÄúCome on, you are a good actor but not THAT good. I knew a kid with an analysis quirk and his eyes glowed when he used it. You do that ‚Äòface freezing‚Äô routine when you are ‚Äòusing your quirk‚Äô, but someone once dropped a book near you while you were doing that and you jumped up in shock slightly. I didn‚Äôt say a thing, but me and Jug were both wondering when you‚Äôre going to come forward with it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not angry at me?‚Äù Rabbit utters, trying to wrap his mind around the concept. 

‚ÄúI can barely imagine something that would make me angry at you!‚Äù Toxicity and chuckles seeing the shock on Rabbit‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúOh come on, it‚Äôs barely a month but you are like a younger brother to me already! You and Jug are the only people who weren‚Äôt afraid of shaking my hand THROUGH a glove. Oh, and Kurogiri, but I‚Äôm not sure if he is afraid of anything. And I really think that destroying a school without even using a quirk is awesome!‚Äù 

They are not angry at Rabbit?! Why aren‚Äôt they angry at Rabbit?! They should be angry at him! He lied to them! He was‚Ä¶ is‚Ä¶ He has no idea what he should say about his quirk state at this point, this is just so damn confusing. 

‚ÄúWhat brought this?‚Äù Juggernaut is intrigued and comes straight to the point. 

‚ÄúUhm... ‚Äú Rabbit is just a tiny bit startled. But it adds to its earlier startleness, and gets quite bad. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs... Legion did something to me. Some form of test. He‚Ä¶ says that I‚Äôm going to be a late-bloomer.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awesome!‚Äù Toxicity is, as always, expressive for them both. ‚ÄúWhat quirk? Do you know that already?‚Äù Juggernaut grunts slightly, in the positive way. 

‚ÄúErr, no.‚Äù Rabbit is slowly coming to a realization that they truly mean it. ‚ÄúHe‚Ä¶ he says that it should awaken in the next few months. Told me to tell him if I feel weird in any way, and‚Ä¶ to tell you, because‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶ he knows someone who killed someone else during their first activation because their quirk was painful to them, the other person tried to hug them to calm them down and their quirk was lethal on touch and‚Ä¶‚Äù 

Toxicity raises her hand, and Rabbit stops. 

‚ÄúSo, in short, do not approach you when something weird starts happening to you.‚Äù She summarizes promptly. ‚ÄúNo problem. If we see weird things happen to you, we‚Äôll go tell Kurogiri or whatever member of the League will be here. See, it wasn‚Äôt that hard?‚Äù 

Rabbit did his best to not cry at the realization that they truly WERE his friends. He, like in many other things in his life, failed.

Tenko Shimura enjoyed playing videogames above (almost) everything else. He spent three hours playing some handheld consoles while his Player Two was talking business with some surviving yakuza clan. They weren‚Äôt any bigwigs, and were mostly mob creatures. But had a certain degree of an honour code left, and Izuku decided that it‚Äôs enough for him to want to work with them. 

They relented. Decay and Stain said nothing during the meeting. Dabi quipped about burning things a few times. Bringing three boss monsters to talk with a bunch of low level NPCs was a nice intimidation factor. They were all minmaxed for it. 

When he returned home, he finally had time to play something properly. Izuku mentioned some new folks in the base, but he saw no one. He trusted his words on it. He trusted his words on all things. He didn‚Äôt care enough to look for them on his own to find out who they were. 

Time has passed, familiar faces have vanished from the living room. It was probably night on the outside. Everyone went to sleep. He liked being left alone. 

He was taking a sip from an energy drink can, finishing his preparations for dealing with a particularly obnoxious boss monster‚Ä¶ when something happened. Someone sneaked into the living room. The steps were quiet, but Tenko spent years hiding in the alleyways from people trying to beat him or worse. He wasn‚Äôt easy to sneak up on. 

He paused the game and turned his head to inspect the dex/agi build intruder. He trusted Izuku to find only worthwhile new members for the guild, and‚Ä¶ 

Tenko Shimura sees the most beautiful girl his eyes ever rested upon. 
Notes:

    Honestly, Rabbit deserved that after the whole life of shittery, ngl.

    Also Tenko Shimura is such a hopeless case that Cupid went 'fuck it' and pulled out a love cannon instead of love bow for this one. The results are absolutely hilarious and occupy half of the next chapter.

Chapter 36: Love
Summary:

    Tenko's reaction is finally here and boy if he isn't rather... extreme.

Chapter Text

‚ÄúCould you repeat what you just said to me, but this time be slightly more generous with details?‚Äù Midoriya Izuku asked. It was early morning, he was planning to wake up Rabbit in a while to start the internships and then‚Ä¶ this happened. 

His brain, however honed it was with all the planning, quirk analysis, scheming and so on, simply refused to unpack the last words he heard. It was too much. 

‚ÄúWe want to marry.‚Äù Tenko Shimura, living weapon of mass destruction, fanatic gamer and the most asocial person Izuku knew (oh and possibly a sociopath/psychopath/whatever else) said with a wide and happy smile. He was standing in front of Izuku in the Legion's office‚Ä¶ with Awoo. 

They were holding hands.

THEY WERE HOLDING HANDS!!! 

Sure, Tenko was wearing his artist gloves to not decay anything accidentally, but‚Ä¶ even with them, he tried his best not to touch anyone. At least, anyone from the League. 

‚ÄúBecause she has the most beautiful smile and I want to do my best to protect it.‚Äù Tenko continues, blissfully unaware of just how WRONG those words sound coming from his mouth. Izuku saw him laughing while he decayed almost a hundred of people into dust! ‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt do it legally. Because we are villains. So I want you to just announce it. Make it official at least within the guild. You are the guildmaster, yes?‚Äù

Izuku began to suspect that Rabbit awoke some powerful insanity quirk because honestly this was the only reasonable explanation for Tenko saying THOSE words. With a face of someone so utterly lovestruck. 

‚ÄúErr‚Ä¶ Are you alright with that?‚Äù He said towards Awoo. He lowkey expected Tenko to have just kidnapped the girl. He also expected her to answer only with a shake or a nod of her head, due to how silent she supposedly was.

‚ÄúY...yes.‚Äù She said quietly, doing her best to look him in the eyes. ‚ÄúV...very much.‚Äù

Tenko beamed even more. Izuku was even more lost. Perhaps Rabbit has some form of transdimensional quirk and sent Legion to another universe? Maybe when Izuku hugged him? They might have switched universes with their local equivalents at that moment. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you know each other for like‚Ä¶ ten hours or something?‚Äù They nod. Tenko fervently, Awoo slightly. ‚ÄúOkay, so can you tell me what exactly happened? Because, honestly, this DID come out of the blue.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, ok.‚Äù Tenko replies. He seems confused with Izuku‚Äôs confusion. ‚ÄúI was playing a videogame during the night. Awoo came. She was beautiful so I told her that. She was shocked, and asked me what part of her is beautiful. So I listed them all. Her ears and a tail that are fluffy and pretty. Her eyes that are so different and I like to look at them because of that. Her mouth that has all those fangs that can kill people in many different ways. Plus how silently she could walk around, she is really sneaky! She smiled a bit, and I added her smile to the list.‚Äù His head tilts a bit, and there is a bit of confusion on his face. ‚ÄúShe was surprised, and said she didn‚Äôt smile.‚Äù

Izuku remembers Awoo‚Äôs acute problems considering her disfigurement. Tenko Shimura managed to - with his manchildish inability and unwillingness to lie that somehow was enough to make him appear genuine - hit all the buttons to make her fall in love. Somehow. Beginner‚Äôs luck? 

It was like a commander of an army besieging a city coming to negotiate, accidentally walking through an unmarked minefield and managing to (on an accident, once again) persuade the besieged that he is a god in flesh and making them promptly surrender unconditionally before his divine might. And then walking away, through that very same minefield again, further establishing the impression.

Awoo is practically melting next to him when she hears the words repeated in front of someone else. She would hide her face with her hands if one of them wasn‚Äôt occupied by Tenko, but she is still doing her best. Despite that, it‚Äôs obvious that she is very, very red. 

‚ÄúThen it turned out that she can play video games!‚Äù Tenko says with an even wider smile. ‚ÄúAnd she is good at them! She sneaked into the living room in the night to play alone. But she won‚Äôt have to anymore.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt specify if he means sneaking or playing alone. Probably both things. ‚ÄúWe played for a few hours. Talked. About how we were both abandoned early. I want to dust the people that did all that to her. She is so beautiful now, so she had to be even more beautiful before!‚Äù Awoo suddenly gets even more red. Izuku didn‚Äôt think that it was possible. 

TOO PRECIOUS, THIS IS TOO PRECIOUS!!!

Izuku is on the verge of dying from a sugar overdose. It‚Äôs like spending too much time with Eri. This is lethal! TOO LETHAL! 

‚ÄúThen we‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶‚Äù Tenko Shimura, the man who dusted two digit number of people twice, and laughed while doing so, actually blushes. His face matches hers in color. Izuku suddenly understands that somehow, his asocial adopted brother has actually beat him to at least a certain thing, and this is atrocious considering how long he has a girlfriend. ‚ÄúThis morning I decided that I want to stay with her for the rest of my life. And she said that she wanted it too. So we came here.‚Äù

Midoriya Izuku decides that he isn‚Äôt paid enough to deal with it. He has issues figuring out his own love life. This is just so much beyond his pay grade. And he can‚Äôt even talk with Lemillion without betraying that the League got new members!

‚ÄúAlright, so‚Ä¶ Tenko Shimura and, uhm‚Ä¶‚Äù He says and looks at Awoo. 

‚ÄúS...Suto.‚Äù She says faintly. ‚ÄúSuto Shimura.‚Äù 

She already gave up her surname. That was fast, Izuku decides. Then again they literally decided to marry and spend their life together a few hours after meeting and‚Ä¶ 

He sighs. If they are so much into it‚Ä¶maybe Tenko will mature on the inside a bit?

‚ÄúWell then, you can‚Äôt exactly do it legally, so‚Ä¶ I guess if you want it, then you can have it? You are married then.‚Äù 

Tenko almost jumps in happiness. Awoo actually does it. Then they spontaneously kiss. In his office. Only the lack of windows stops Legion from jumping through one.

SmallMight: ATTENTION

SmallMight: Today is the day when we all make fun of Insomniac for his greatest and most failed of jokes.

SmallMight: Unless what just happened is (actually) a form of illusion quirk or something else that I was hit with.

SmallMight: I still have issues with believing in what I just saw. 

Insomniac: what

VampirePrincess: ???

CatProvider: What is it this time?

SneakyGecko: Huh? 

SmallMight: Insomniac wanted Awoo (that wolfgirl from Kurogiri‚Äôs school) to join the Vanguard because she was a wolfgirl and Decay is into girls with animal ears apparently

SneakyGecko: Hey that‚Äôs both an asshole and quirkist move

Insomniac: she has skills and Kurogiri had nowhere else to send her!

Insomniac: that was just a side thing, I‚Äôd have taken her either way

Insomniac: also I get now why Tenko is excluded from this convo

Insomniac: so HandyMan and Awoo finally run into each other? And I missed it? 

SmallMight: how little you know little man

Insomniac: he was probably super startled, hmm?

SmallMight: you know nothing Hitoshi Shinsou

VampirePrincess: c‚Äômon talk to us

Vantablack: yeah, I get the feeling it‚Äôs going to be big

SmallMight: They met yesterday very late evening (after everyone else went to sleep), when Awoo sneaked out of her room and went to the living one

SmallMight: then things escalated

Insomniac: how much

SmallMight: Enough for Tenko to come to my office at 8am with Awoo in tow, both of them officially informing me that they want to marry each other. Which they did. Awoo‚Äôs real name is now Suto Shimura, and Tenko informed me that she ‚Äòhas the most beautiful smile and he wants to do his best to protect it‚Äô. That‚Äôs an exact quote. 

Insomniac: what the fuck

VampirePrincess: I MISSED A WEDDING?! I WANTED TO BE A FLOWER GIRL

CatProvider: Excuse me, but WHAT?!

VampirePrincess: wait‚Ä¶ TENKO GOT MARRIED?! To a 3D girl?!

Vantablack: Oh my God. 

SneakyGecko: COMPLEX MUTANT QUIRK TEAM SCORES ANOTHER WELL-DESERVED VICTORY

BurnBurnBurn: ‚Ä¶ My brain refuses to understand the words in front of me. 

SmallMight: welcome to my world, @BurnBurnBurn

SmallMight: THEY WERE HOLDING HANDS

SmallMight: THEY WENT FOR A KISS WHEN I SAID THAT THEY ARE NOW MARRIED

SmallMight: TENKO SHIMURA THE EMOTIONLESS MURDER MACHINE WAS BLUSHING LIKE A LITTLE GIRL ALMOST ALL THE TIME

SmallMight: I still suspect that it might be some insanity quirk because holy shit

Insomniac: what the fuck

Insomniac: normies

Insomniac: all for you

SmallMight: Should Kurogiri look for a catgirl for you?

Insomniac: none of you are free of sin I‚Äôm leaving

Insomniac: why is everyone so silent

SmallMight: I think Tenko is having unexpected guests, give them a moment

‚ÄúErrr‚Ä¶ you called for me.‚Äù Rabbit is deeply worried, because he heard some people running around the building shouting earlier. But he expected some explosions and so on if the heroes found them, so he decided that it wasn‚Äôt this. 

‚ÄúOh yes, great!‚Äù Legion smiles widely and vibrantly. He is doing something on a computer on his desk, but there are also some papers spread around. ‚ÄúWe had a bit of an‚Ä¶ interesting morning, so the start of your internship was a bit delayed.‚Äù 

Rabbit weighs the feeling of danger and his growing curiosity. 

‚ÄúW‚Ä¶ what happened?‚Äù Curiosity wins. Legion points him towards a chair right next to him. 

‚ÄúAwoo met Decay yesterday evening.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúLove at first sight. They announced that they are getting married this morning.‚Äù Rabbit stares at the supervillain in shock. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand what happened either.‚Äù 

Awoo is going to get married? Didn‚Äôt that require her to‚Ä¶ er‚Ä¶ say yes? At the very least. She never spoke. Kurogiri mentioned that she could, but‚Ä¶

Wow.

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm going to‚Ä¶ introduce you to my current little project.‚Äù Legion announces when Rabbit calms down a bit. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm planning something quite big, and I believe that you‚Äôll benefit greatly from taking part in it. Besides, I like the idea of having someone to narrate the whole thing to. I expect feedback from you, if possible.‚Äù 

Rabbit can do that. But before he has the time to, the door to Legion‚Äôs office opens wide. He is startled. It‚Äôs a girl with golden hair. 

‚ÄúIzuku!‚Äù She shouts. ‚ÄúI have an announcement!‚Äù Rabbit flinches in his seat, he was thoroughly spooked by the sudden arrival. 

‚ÄúErrr‚Ä¶ what is it, Himi? I‚Äôm a bit busy.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúAlso please don‚Äôt scare my assistant, he is a bit‚Ä¶ jumpy.‚Äù Legion is wrong. Rabbit is very jumpy. Not just a bit. 

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs the Rabbit I heard of?‚Äù The girl replies and looks quizzically at Rabbit. ‚ÄúDid your dad have another child with some black haired woman? He looks like you, but smaller.‚Äù 

Rabbit is confused. How is he similar to Legion? Legion is so confident, and powerful and dangerous, and he is just Rabbit. Small and timid. 

‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôm starting to wonder about that myself?‚Äù Legion answers with a question and Rabbit is even more confused. ‚ÄúNow, what was it that you wanted to announce?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWe are getting married!‚Äù Himiko Toga (Rabbit recognized her finally) announces with a wide smile. 

‚ÄúErr.. When?‚Äù Legion appears to be as confused as Rabbit. Who in the meantime asks himself if you should get confused by the idea of getting married with someone.

‚ÄúRight now? I mean, like Tenko did?‚Äù Himiko replies. ‚ÄúWe can have a party later. Also I‚Äôm taking your surname because it‚Äôs lovely, and mine reminds me of my parents and they sucked.‚Äù Rabbit can relate to the last bit. ‚ÄúAnd yours are awesome.‚Äù Rabbit can no longer relate.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ okay?‚Äù Legion replies, clearly taken aback with what just happened. 

‚ÄúAwesome, bye!‚Äù Vampire says and disappears from the room. 

Legion stares at the now closed door for a few long seconds before finally speaking. 

‚ÄúWhat the hell is wrong with this day?!‚Äù Rabbit is slightly reassured by not being the most confused person in the room. ‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs move to the internship before something even weirder happens.‚Äù 

Rabbit is alright with that.

Legion: I have an announcement. 

Mischief: Is it important?

Legion: very.

Mischief: Then why not say it in person?

Legion: I‚Äôd visit you officially, but I‚Äôm currently too swamped with work (something VERY big coming)

Mischief: I understand! And I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll do great.

Mischief: I‚Äôm listening then, Izu. 

Legion: I just got married. 

Legion: It‚Äôs been ten minutes, did you stop crying?

Mischief: Yes. 

Mischief: I expected to be invited to your wedding, Izuku. 

Legion: I almost wasn‚Äôt invited myself. 

Legion: Another League member met a girl and married her within the span of 10 hours.

Legion: Himiko was inspired by it, so she entered my office, yelled at me that we‚Äôre getting married right now and we‚Äôll make a party over it later, and then she left after I said yes. 

Mischief: Ten hours?!

Legion: They aren‚Äôt exactly‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶ normal. In every sense of the word. 

Legion: So Himiko Toga is now Himiko Midoriya. 

Legion: Did you stop crying?

Mischief: Yes.

Mischief: I‚Äôm so happy for you both.

Legion: Also

Legion: Are you interested in adopting another child?

Mischief: What brought that in?

Legion: You helped Kurogiri with his school, do you remember smol boy with black hair and obvious severe anxiety?

Mischief: Oh, that one. I always left him the biggest portion of my food, he really needs to eat more. I think the meds Kurogiri got him made him much less anxious, and he is a very good student. 

Mischief: Resembles you a lot, actually. Mostly the hair. And freckles. 

Mischief: What about him?

Legion: He enjoys analyzing quirks, is a late-bloomer, and is a material for a criminal mastermind to equal me. Also he was bullied in school, so he destroyed it by a combination of secret surveillance, unleashing compromising pics on the internet, and some explosives and flammable materials. Without having to use a quirk. He even escaped a pro hero that came to arrest him!

Mischief: I‚Äôm going to have a serious talk with your father. 

Legion: At least wait for the DNA test results before you murder him, don‚Äôt make Eri sad.

Legion: But yes, he is almost second me, with less quirks and more anxiety. 

Legion: And I really think that he would benefit from having even remotely reasonable parents for once.

Legion: Although making him NOT die from fright after seeing dad might be an achievement. 

Legion: He looked like he was about to jump through the window (despite the lack of these in my secret hideout) when Himiko opened the doors too quickly.

Legion: ‚Ä¶ are you crying again? you‚Äôve been silent for a few minutes

Mischief: No, I‚Äôm preparing dinner. 

Legion: Are your tears a cooking ingredient?

Mischief: Don‚Äôt get sassy with me, Izuku.

Legion: sorry mom

Mischief: I was thinking about having another child, actually. I‚Äôm still reasonably young (well, reasonably young again), and your father might benefit from someone else to pamper (he is a bit too‚Ä¶ Eri-centric ever since you stopped being around so often). 

Mischief: But I‚Äôm not sure if he would agree.

Legion: ‚Ä¶ tell him that Rabbit has a dormant Class-Six quirk, like Eri. And the two of us.  

Mischief: My worries have been successfully dispelled. 

Mischief: I‚Äôm still having those DNA tests done.

Akatani Mikumo: Can you do something for me

Mirio Togata: no

Akatani Mikumo: it‚Äôs not illegal

Mirio Togata: still no but this time with a field for negotiation

Akatani Mikumo: Vampire wants to know if there is a way to change her wanted posters from Himiko Toga to Himiko Midoriya

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶

Mirio Togata: you got married?

Akatani Mikumo:  Yes

Mirio Togata: Congratulations! What address do I need to send my gift to?

Akatani Mikumo: Is your gift a brigade of high ranked heroes to arrest me?

Mirio Togata: yes

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôm hiding in the Hero Commission‚Äôs president office

Mirio Togata: there is certainly a villain hiding there, but most likely not you

Mirio Togata: also congratulations, this time for real

Mirio Togata: I was kinda wondering how long will that take you

Mirio Togata: what about the harem thing

Akatani Mikumo: The chat is still booming with activity, but the matter seems to be dead outside of it

Akatani Mikumo: which is reasonably alright but I‚Äôm still expecting a trap

Akatani Mikumo: Also can you open a second chat with me and invite Sir Nighteye to it

Mirio Togata: ‚Ä¶

Mirio Togata: please explain

Akatani Mikumo: I have intel to share and I‚Äôm NOT visiting UA for it, plus I can‚Äôt exactly keep phoning Eraserhead whenever I have something for you

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôm 99% sure that Aizawa‚Äôs hunt for me is powered by spite for phoning him during the nap

Akatani Mikumo: If I do that too many times, he‚Äôll probably have a quirk awakening and start deactivating quirks by seeing people‚Äôs images on the internet or smth

Mirio Togata: I‚Äôm going to do that but please don‚Äôt make me regret that

Mirio Togata: Is this line secure?

Mirai Sasaki: Unless you want to send nuclear launch codes or UA‚Äôs bank account password, yes. Why do you ask? 

 

Mirio Togata added Akatani Mikumo to the conversation!

 

Mirai Sasaki: Oh. 

Akatani Mikumo: Hello there, Sir Nighteye!

Mirai Sasaki: My migraine made manifest is here.

Mirai Sasaki: What is it about?

Akatani Mikumo: I have something for you and for Nedzu. 

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôm also going to call in a favour Mirio promised me.

Mirai Sasaki: What? 

Mirio Togata: What? 

Akatani Mikumo: Do you remember the Zealot promise, Mirio? 

Mirio Togata: OH

Mirio Togata: That one.

Mirai Sasaki: I‚Äôm getting increasingly worried.

Akatani Mikumo: No need for that.

Akatani Mikumo: Mirio was impressed with Zealot‚Äôs last fight, and said that if I find two CRC bases I should tell him about one so that he can arrest everyone inside as a form of a tribute to the guy that died saving lots of kids.

Mirai Sasaki: That certainly lessened my worry.

Mirio Togata: A bit of a heat of the moment thing, but I think I speak for us all when I say that intel like that is useful.

Mirai Sasaki: Yes. What sort of base are we talking about?

Akatani Mikumo: All of them. 

Mirai Sasaki: What?

Akatani Mikumo: After joining us, Zealot gave me some notes and a few contacts that could be‚Ä¶ recruitable.

Akatani Mikumo: Few days ago I finally got a spy in Purity's inner circle. 

Akatani Mikumo: I have the location of no less than seventeen notable facilities of the CRC, including the High Cathedral, the Purity‚Äôs personal citadel. 

Akatani Mikumo: But we‚Äôre on the time limit here and I need heroes' help to confirm the intel and dismantle the CRC entirely while we still can. 

Mirai Sasaki: Time limit? 

Akatani Mikumo: I began my investigation of the High Cathedral two days ago. Yesterday Gremlin‚Äôs recon drone spotted a group of clanners training a group combat alongside the noumus. 

Mirai Sasaki: Oh, well that‚Äôs not good at all.

Mirio Togata: Purity joined the Paranormal Liberation Front?!

Akatani Mikumo: According to my informant, not yet. But the PLF provided the noumus as the proof of concept of what it can do. The informant really doesn‚Äôt like complex mutant quirkers, but had a lot of issues with the CRC for a while now, and Purity considering an alliance with someone creating abominations like the noumus was the last straw. 

Akatani Mikumo: We have ten days before the CRC and the PLF will have the final round of negotiations, and when that happens, the CRC will provide their base coordinates to the PLF‚Äôs warper. 

Akatani Mikumo: When that happens, we can expect Overhaul interrupting any attack on their allies with his forces and the noumus, or them just evacuating the CRC into wherever they are hiding. 

Mirai Sasaki: But now we can potentially annihilate one of the largest terror groups in the country, if we act fast. While denying PLF a powerful ally. 

Mirai Sasaki: I understand and support it fully. 

Mirai Sasaki: What can you give us?

Akatani Mikumo: As I said, I can‚Äôt investigate the whole thing within the allotted time frame, and I‚Äôm not going to launch a full-scale assault without being certain that the intel is true. Overhaul is‚Ä¶ painfully smart. And this could be a deception.

Akatani Mikumo: UA and its present allies have access to much more specialist investigators and heroes good with quirk espionage. So I plan to give you what I have about all seventeen bases, to confirm the intel within the next eight days. We attack on the ninth day. 

Mirai Sasaki: To make sure that we won‚Äôt miss Purity, due to her negotiating elsewhere. So the day before the deadline?

Akatani Mikumo: Correct

Mirai Sasaki: I see. Continue.

Akatani Mikumo: I promised Zealot that I would see Purity dead, and I‚Äôm not budging on that. High Cathedral will be attacked by the League of Villains. But we can‚Äôt exactly announce to the world that we‚Äôre working together. So if you agree‚Ä¶ Any ideas how to pull that off?

Mirai Sasaki: Shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. We‚Äôll send a proper assault group to the High Cathedral, but it will be late. If you‚Äôll be in the shape for that, we might stage a brief skirmish before you escape. 

Akatani Mikumo: Not going to try to arrest us for real? 

Mirai Sasaki: I‚Äôm going to arrest you for real. But after the Paranormal Liberation Front gets destroyed.

Mirai Sasaki: I disagree with your very existence, and knowledge about your true quirk makes me extremely worried about the future. But I do agree with you, Mirio and Nedzu that right now Overhaul and Garaki are a much bigger threat. And that the UA in its current, weakened state, has manpower and resources to wage a single war with reasonable chances of victory. 

Mirai Sasaki: I‚Äôm not going to start a war on two fronts when I know that I can‚Äôt win it.  

Akatani Mikumo: I absolutely love working with intelligent people, you know? 

Akatani Mikumo: In 20 minutes I‚Äôll have someone leave an envelope with a pendrive filled with data in front of your agency. 

Akatani Mikumo: Good hunting! 

 

***

 

Amaya Nemuri: I made the decision. 

Akatani Mikumo: ? 

Amaya Nemuri: sorry, but‚Ä¶ I just can‚Äôt

Amaya Nemuri: I support your goals, wholeheartedly

Amaya Nemuri: but I can‚Äôt imagine actually killing people anymore

Amaya Nemuri: No anger left. No spite left. Just‚Ä¶ emptiness.

Amaya Nemuri: I can barely understand what made me so‚Ä¶ free to do that earlier

Akatani Mikumo: that‚Äôs unfortunate, Musty

Akatani Mikumo: everyone will miss you dearly

Amaya Nemuri: I know sorry

Akatani Mikumo: don‚Äôt apologize, you have nothing to apologize for

Akatani Mikumo: if anything, I messed up

Akatani Mikumo: Spend too much time on prepping to get your wish granted

Akatani Mikumo: And I run out of time

Amaya Nemuri: we run out of time

Akatani Mikumo: what now?

Amaya Nemuri: I don‚Äôt know

Amaya Nemuri: I think about moving elsewhere

Amaya Nemuri: it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ too complicated to stay here

Akatani Mikumo: How‚Äôs your english? You are an honour student, so‚Ä¶

Amaya Nemuri: very well, why do you ask?

Akatani Mikumo: Dad has a company with some contacts here and there. He can get you settled overseas, somewhere where the past will never catch up with you

Akatani Mikumo: In US, under false identity, with a place in decent school and some scholarship to help you settle in

Amaya Nemuri: He‚Äôll do it for me?

Akatani Mikumo: musty, you are my friend, almost an adopted cousin 

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôm willing to ask him, and he does things when I ask him for

Akatani Mikumo: he can even throw in some quirk usage that will make you face appear different and even mess up with any DNA test on you - he will make it so that even when the japanese police will connect the dots, they will never find Amaya Nemuri

Akatani Mikumo: Hell, if you ask him he can take your quirk and replace it with something else, you could even become a hero like that, no one would ever knew

Amaya Nemuri: I think I‚Äôll like that. The camouflage.

Amaya Nemuri: I need to think about the latter, I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm a hero material (probably not)

Akatani Mikumo: You could be one better than her, I‚Äôm sure. The people you killed were monsters. But that‚Äôs on you

Amaya Nemuri: yeah

Amaya Nemuri: I‚Äôll still follow the news on you, for the record

Amaya Nemuri: and cheer for you

Amaya Nemuri: I hope nothing bad happens to you all, I just‚Ä¶ shit

Akatani Mikumo: Don‚Äôt worry

Akatani Mikumo: We‚Äôll do great

Akatani Mikumo: unless those damn problem children will make me die first

Amaya Nemuri: What happened?

Akatani Mikumo: Tenko got married

Amaya Nemuri: in some mmo?

Akatani Mikumo: no, rl. got a new recruit, ten hours later they walked into my office holding hands and told me to make their marriage official

Akatani Mikumo: i‚Äôm so fucking done with that all

Amaya Nemuri: holy hell

Akatani Mikumo: I relate to Eraserhead so much

Amaya Nemuri: yeah I can imagine

Akatani Mikumo: and then Himiko opened my office doom wide, shouted that we‚Äôre getting married and she is taking my surname, and then she left

Amaya Nemuri: that sounds like a very himiko thing to do

Akatani Mikumo: yeah xD

Akatani Mikumo: I actually asked dad about you know what earlier (just in case), so it‚Äôs going to be prepared by tomorrow. Don‚Äôt return to the Villain Network. Pack your stuff up tonight and write goodbye letters to whoever you want. Kurogiri will come pick you up at noon (he will probably want to say his goodbyes in person, you know how fatherly he is to us all), he‚Äôll warp you where you are supposed to be and bring your letters to the League

Amaya Nemuri: will do

Amaya Nemuri: izuku

Akatani Mikumo: yeah?

Amaya Nemuri: thank you for everything

Akatani Mikumo: sorry for not granting you your wish in time
Notes:

    All that I'm going to say about the last segment is that it's not the last time Mustard shows up in this story. And Training Camp wasn't Mustard's last poison gas cloud.

    Also, as I said, Cupid took out a cannon for this one :V Extreme Preciousness incoming.

Chapter 37: War Plans
Summary:

    Another of the UA War Council meetings is made. This time, without Izuku Midoriya...

Chapter Text

Mirio Togata: Are we playing anything this evening?

Akatani Mikumo: probably

Mirio Togata: what game?

Akatani Mikumo: you choose

Mirio Togata: what happened?

Akatani Mikumo: reading me like an open book, huh?

Mirio Togata: it‚Äôs not exactly closed rn

Akatani Mikumo: I fucked up. 

Mirio Togata: if you need to talk about it, I‚Äôm here

Mirio Togata: just know that I‚Äôm going to tell the heroes if it‚Äôs in any way useful stuff

Akatani Mikumo: no longer useful and that‚Äôs the problem

Akatani Mikumo: Mustard left the League and it‚Äôs my fault

Mirio Togata: What happened?

Akatani Mikumo: Some of the League members are in to make the world know how it hurt them

Akatani Mikumo: others are in because they have a goal, and they agreed to help me with mine (the Symbol of Evil thing) in exchange for me fulfilling theirs along the way

Akatani Mikumo: Think Zealot and stopping Purity (he might have died, but he was a part of the family and I‚Äôll fulfill his wish despite his death)

Akatani Mikumo: Mustard had one too. And I fucked it up. 

Mirio Togata: how exactly?

Akatani Mikumo: His motivation was kinda dumb tbh

Akatani Mikumo: He wanted to spite a neglectful parent seen by the world as a someone to look up to by becoming a villain and making said parent see it, to make them realize how much they fucked up with Mustard

Akatani Mikumo: took me too much time

Akatani Mikumo: Mustard‚Äôs parent passed away

Akatani Mikumo: His anger and spite passed away with them

Akatani Mikumo: I had a perfect occasion to do that a while ago but I didn‚Äôt

Akatani Mikumo: And now I lost a close friend and pretty much an adopted cousin

Akatani Mikumo: it hurts

Mirio Togata: well that‚Äôs certainly tough moment

Mirio Togata: but

Mirio Togata: you do realize I can‚Äôt exactly say I‚Äôm sad that the League was weakened, right? 

Mirio Togata: and that technically speaking I should inquire more about Mustard? He is still a living chemical weapon, who is now at large

Akatani Mikumo: yeah yeah I know

Akatani Mikumo: don‚Äôt bother looking for him

Akatani Mikumo: He is now in a different country, under a different name, different backstory, with a different face and probably something to obfuscate DNA tests. If not a different quirk altogether

Akatani Mikumo: you‚Äôll never find him

Mirio Togata: different quirk?

Akatani Mikumo: As I said ‚Äòif not‚Äô. Whether I did it or not is yours to guess

Akatani Mikumo: I had/have a small quirk to make yourself less noticeable when you want, whether I gave it to Mustard for him to not be quirkless but to be able to not be tracked by his quirk is anyone‚Äôs guess

Akatani Mikumo: I still fucked up

Mirio Togata: I‚Äôm not going to deny that. You had a goal, you didn‚Äôt make it in time. It's a failure. 

Mirio Togata: but don‚Äôt be TOO hard on yourself, k?

Mirio Togata: you did your best, but we can‚Äôt always succeed

Mirio Togata: leave always succeeding to heroes 

Akatani Mikumo: LOL

Akatani Mikumo: heh

Akatani Mikumo: been a bit of a mood whiplash, I was quite happy with Himiko and something else that I can‚Äôt talk about, then this

Akatani Mikumo: hit me harder than it would do on its own and even that would be bad enough

Akatani Mikumo: can you believe that me, an SSS-Rank supervillain, has hidden himself in his office to cry?

Akatani Mikumo: jesus this is pathetic

Mirio Togata: if you did it, it means you needed it

Akatani Mikumo: I literally said that to someone like two days ago stop being so influenced by me

Mirio Togata: ok

Mirio Togata: do you want to talk about the League?

Akatani Mikumo: are you trying to take advantage of my weakened state?

Mirio Togata: did you expect me to do anything else?

Akatani Mikumo: HA

Akatani Mikumo: That‚Äôs a low blow though

Mirio Togata: I just want to understand you better

Mirio Togata: you and your motivations

Mirio Togata: you and your message to the world

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôm not going to tell you any details that could potentially help you catch someone

Akatani Mikumo: but I believe that we can talk about motivations

 

***

 

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to officially congratulate Best Jeanist and Miruko for their successful operation against the PLF.‚Äù Nedzu started the meeting on a high note. ‚ÄúYou have managed to dismantle their operations in Kyoto, eliminating fifty-six enemies, while sustaining no casualties yourself. ‚Äù 

They are all (well, almost all) back in the meeting room in the UA. Even the tables and chairs are placed identically. Legion is absent, and so is Crust who is busy with the Northern Battle Group stuff. 

‚ÄúToo bad they all managed to commit suicide to avoid capture.‚Äù Miruko is clearly pissed off. ‚ÄúFucking brainwashing jerk.‚Äù Best Jeanist is much more scarce with his expressions, but he clearly agrees with the rabbit woman. 

‚ÄúSir Nighteye is already analyzing the recovered computers.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúTrying to take the PLF members alive is clearly a waste of time and effort, at least unless we manage to find the brainwasher and find out if his quirk can be undone.‚Äù

Eraserhead doesn‚Äôt say a thing, but it‚Äôs nice to see the alliance actually achieving something. Their team-up brought some results - namely, the information shared between the vigilantes and the underground heroes managed to give Nedzu enough of a lead to latch onto and find several places owned by the PLF. 

Not much, but a good start. 

‚ÄúSo, why are we here?‚Äù Knuckleduster comes straight to the point. ‚ÄúI see that the League representative is missing, and you called for this meeting ahead of schedule.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWe got some new evidence.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúLegion has managed to obtain a spy within the Creature Rejection Clan‚Äôs command structure. High enough to give us enough intel to completely annihilate the entire organization once and for all.‚Äù Miruko and Gang Orca perk up, but they merely react the strongest of them all. Even Knuckleduster cracks a smile. 

‚ÄúUnfortunately, the situation is grim and the time is limited.‚Äù Nedzu continues. ‚ÄúAerial reconnaissance confirmed the presence of Noumus within the High Cathedral grounds. Legion‚Äôs spy claims that we have no more than four days before the negotiations are concluded and the CRC will join the Paranormal Liberation Front.‚Äù 

Oh well that‚Äôs not good at all, Eraserhead decides. He isn‚Äôt alone in that belief. 

‚ÄúFucking hypocrites.‚Äù Miruko is livid. Not a rare thing, but this time it‚Äôs pretty bad. ‚ÄúMutants are bad but bioengineered monstrosities are suddenly alright?!‚Äù 

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt expect consistency from groups like that.‚Äù Nedzu replies calmly. ‚ÄúThe spy in question decided to betray the organization precisely due to not being able to reconcile looking down on complex mutants and employing noumus in CRC‚Äôs order of battle.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, at least that one quirkist ass is somewhat consistent in being an ass.‚Äù Miruko sneers mockingly. ‚ÄúAlright, what‚Äôs the plan?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have locations of seventeen facilities of various sizes.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúWe managed to confirm the presence of the CRC forces in all of them, but we had only five days for our own investigation. We‚Äôre going to go through the data given to us by Legion together during this meeting, but before it happens, I have to say that the raid will be rushed. Legion has also asked us to leave the High Cathedral assault to him due to personal reasons, but to maintain the ruse of League not working with us, we‚Äôll have to send an attack party there. It‚Äôll be mysteriously late to the battle, though.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going that far for him?‚Äù Ms. Joke is the one to ask, which is a surprise to Eraserhead. He thought that Knuckleduster would be the one to say that. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be frank with you.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúAs of now, we can‚Äôt afford to lose Legion. The Paranormal Liberation Front and the League of Villains are two opposing superpowers of the underworld, and the former is massively more powerful. If we destroy the League now, we‚Äôll push all the undecided and currently League-allied villain groups straight into the Front‚Äôs arms. If that happens, then the member groups of this alliance will fail to stop Overhaul and the combined force of the Japanese villains. Especially with the Hero Commission being busy with keeping the Meta-Liberation Army in check.‚Äù 

Eraserhead read something more about the Second World War after Lemillion‚Äôs simile. This whole deal reeks of what the Allies did with the Soviets. Alliance with a lesser evil to stop the greater one. 

He also read about the Cold War that ensued. He isn‚Äôt looking particularly optimistic at the future, but he simply doesn‚Äôt see an alternative. 

‚ÄúWe continue to gather information about the League, however.‚Äù Nedzu continues. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre fully aware that they will become our enemies once this war ends. I believe that Detective Tsukauchi has something significant to talk about concerning this, am I right?‚Äù Detective nods from his place behind the UA table. 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start from this.‚Äù Miruko says loudly. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm supposed to risk my head by jumping in according to the villain‚Äôs intel, I at least want to know everything I can about him.‚Äù 

Heroes and the sole vigilante appear to agree with that. Nedzu decides to go along and leaves his place in the middle to Detective Tsukauchi. 

‚ÄúLegion has been very active recently.‚Äù Detective announces. ‚ÄúOur informants connected to various small-time villain crews and remaining yakuza clans have reported numerous sightings of him and some other League members, primarily Stain. Each time they get the leaders of said groups to a negotiation table. The negotiations aren‚Äôt about an alliance against the PLF, however.‚Äù Detective sighs. ‚ÄúAs of now, we estimate that no less than sixty such minor organizations have bent their knees before Legion and became the League‚Äôs subsidiary groups.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh dear.‚Äù Nedzu says. The table of allies is probably a bit too far to hear it, but Eraserhead is very close to the rat. He understands the reaction. And why All Might and Sir Nighteye appear frozen. 

Midoriya Izuku is rebuilding his father‚Äôs empire. And they aren‚Äôt in a position to do anything about that, because an empire of crime is a better prospect than mad scientists with armies of bioengineered monsters wanting to tear down society. 

‚ÄúSo he is building himself a criminal empire.‚Äù Knuckleduster comments. ‚ÄúWell, not extremely surprising. With what the PLF is doing and the noumus starting to become a public knowledge, many small-time villains look up to someone for protection. Vigilantes see my presence here as something similar.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot just small-time villains.‚Äù Detective Tsukauchi replies. ‚ÄúAccording to gossip from the underworld, the Levellers and the Quirkless Equality Movement have become subsidiary groups as well, with Sunset and Mr. Compress becoming regular members of the League of Villains.‚Äù Murmur in the room. So much about those two groups being the League‚Äôs allies and equals. ‚ÄúWe have also noticed some new members of the League, but this requires a bit more context.‚Äù 

‚ÄúPlease provide it, then.‚Äù Sir Nighteye says. 

‚ÄúAbout a month ago the police noticed the disappearance of several previously active small-time villains.‚Äù Detective says. ‚ÄúThugs, thieves and the likes. This happened in the span of a few days, and the only common things to them all was their status as villains and relatively young age, between fifteen and twenty one years. We knew of seven such disappearances while further eleven were suspected to be a case, but we weren‚Äôt sure if they were connected. This changed two days ago.‚Äù

Eraserhead is almost certain this is going to be yet another headache. 

‚ÄúD-Rank villain known as Razorhead, who was counted among the group that disappeared, has resurfaced in a gang that swear fealty to Legion recently.‚Äù Detective continues. ‚ÄúOne of the gang‚Äôs leaders is an‚Ä¶ occasional informant of the police. He tends to sell us information about other gangs, and we aren‚Äôt sure if the other leaders of it aren‚Äôt aware of that. Well, according to that person, Razorhead joined his gang as an intern‚Ä¶ from an organization known as the Villain Academy.‚Äù 

Eraserhead called it. 

‚ÄúFrom WHAT?!‚Äù Miruko is the loudest. 

‚ÄúOh dear.‚Äù Nedzu is clearly startled. Eraserhead gets painful flashbacks to the Villain Factory case. 

‚ÄúInformant asked Razorhead about details of it.‚Äù The detective continues. ‚ÄúHe is one of the twenty students, who are apparently a ‚Äòpilot class‚Äô of the entire initiative. The Academy teaches them how to fight with and without their quirks, in-combat quirk analysis, opening locks and disabling alarms, disguising themselves, first-aid, information gathering and analysis and a lot of other, similar things. The students are divided between three courses: Combat, Espionage and Command, with Razorhead being from the first one. The list of identified teachers includes Kurogiri, who is the Academy‚Äôs principal and the homeroom teacher of the first class,  Vampire, Stain and several retired villains, including a woman claiming to be Mischief. Who cooked food for the entire class which, apparently, ‚Äòtasted divine‚Äô.‚Äù Detectives sighs painfully. ‚ÄúThis is everything that we know about the Academy as of now.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAcademy.‚Äù Best Jeanist is clearly on the verge of a KO. ‚ÄúVillains opened a school for themselves.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat sounds like something a hero nerd like Legion would do.‚Äù Oddly enough it‚Äôs Lemillion who says that. ‚ÄúDuring my‚Ä¶ stay with the League I saw first-hand that he is truly a massive fan of heroes. In a way, he respects both them and the villains, for as long as both of them fit his image of their profession. Making a school for the latter that they lack in order to improve their quality is something I can easily picture him doing.‚Äù 

He doesn‚Äôt add the fact that the League had their spy in the UA. They get to observe the best hero school for a while, and probably steal a lot of teacher‚Äôs handouts while doing so. Legion was probably basing his school on the best hero schools of them all.

Last few months are a nightmare that Eraserhead can‚Äôt wake up from.

‚ÄúHe is offering the villains who follow him his support, rather than simply demand obedience out of fear.‚Äù Nedzu says. His face is unreadable. ‚ÄúAll you need to do is swear fealty to the League, and suddenly you have access to the support items of the Villain Industries. Competent and pre-trained interns from the Villain Academy. Information gathered by Legion, who seems to be getting cozy with the information brokers and has at least two ‚Äòfamily members‚Äô who excel at espionage. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he was running an underground bank for member groups. What a brilliant, brilliant scheme.‚Äù 

Nedzu is probably still in pain that Izuku didn‚Äôt decide to join the UA and become a hero. Eraserhead doesn‚Äôt even want to imagine the result of those two teaming up. But it probably includes them laughing maniacally while drinking some high class tea, with the Hero Commission headquarters burning down in the background.

‚ÄúCan we stop admiring him and start being genuinely afraid of what he can do?‚Äù Knuckleduster interrupts Nedzu's special moment. ‚ÄúListen, I get that he is way less nasty than Overhaul, but from what I‚Äôm hearing now, he is just as dangerous in the long-term. If not more.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh, I'm afraid of what he can do!‚Äù Nedzu replies promptly. ‚ÄúI assure you that we‚Äôre attacking his headquarters when only it‚Äôs possible to do that without losing the war against the PLF in the process‚Ä¶ and when we actually find it. Which isn‚Äôt easy. We don‚Äôt know when he moved to his current headquarters. Worst of all, Legion, Gremlin and Kurogiri made it almost impossible to find. They do not enter it normally, only warp in and out. And Gremlin made it practically untraceable through the internet, even when they connect to it from the inside. Trust me, Power Loader tried. Unlike everyone else I asked, because every computer expert I tried to shove this work to took a look at the security and instantly told me to forget about it.‚Äù Nedzu sighs. ‚ÄúUnless we capture Kurogiri and make him cough up the base GPS coordinates, we can only hope for the League to mess up somehow. Or to catch them when they are outside of it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll continue narrating the new developments concerning the League.‚Äù Detective announces in the resulting silence. ‚ÄúI believe that it bolstered its numbers with at least some of the Villain Academy interns, probably the best of the group, although we don‚Äôt know their number or identities. The only exception is the kid that we managed to catch on a camera exiting what we believe to be headquarters of some remaining yakuza clan, probably returning from the negotiations.‚Äù 

The hologram displays a short recording from a CCTV camera. They recognize Legion in his All Might hoodie, and Kurogiri preparing the warp. The third person looks like a young kid, with messy black hair and a brown hoodie (that he pulls up after a second). He seems nervous, looking around while Legion is turning his head towards him (probably saying something). 

‚ÄúWe are yet to identify him, since he isn‚Äôt on the list of vanished villains, but‚Ä¶‚Äù Detective says but Sir Nighteye interrupts him.

‚ÄúAsa Naoki.‚Äù The hero says. ‚ÄúD-Rank, villain name Rabbit.‚Äù He clicks his tongue. ‚ÄúOne of my greatest mistakes.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Detective looks at the hero questioningly. ‚ÄúWould you like to tell us some details?‚Äù 

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù Sir Nighteye replies promptly, but it‚Äôs clear that he isn‚Äôt particularly comfortable with this. ‚ÄúAsa Naoki is a sixteen years old child from Kamisunagawa. Claims to have an analysis quirk, but is actually quirkless. His parents knew, and had mostly distanced themselves from him as a result. He was bullied in school due to his docile nature, small build and the suspicions of quirklessness. School didn‚Äôt intervene, and Asa finally snapped.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat did he do?‚Äù Nedzu is clearly interested. Eraserhead suspects that he knows why. 

‚ÄúHe found a part time job, bought some surveillance equipment with the money he earned, and secretly placed it around his school.‚Äù Nighteye replies. ‚ÄúHe spent months gathering incriminating evidence for the school‚Äôs tolerance towards bullying and a handful of other things, such as the principal‚Äôs on-going affair with an underage student. When he had enough of it, he sneaked into the school again, uploaded everything he found to the internet from the principal‚Äôs computer, before using copious amounts of gasoline and homemade explosives to destroy the school and the majority of evidence which could point towards him.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOkay, that‚Äôs actually quite awesome.‚Äù Miruko really doesn‚Äôt care about her words AND has a short temper for bullies. ‚ÄúBut I assume that‚Äôs not all?‚Äù 

Nedzu is almost salivating at the tale. He loves well-planned operations that he personally agrees with on the moral basis. Even if they are technically villainous. 

‚ÄúWith what remained from the school in chaos, he began to target the bullies.‚Äù Sir Nighteye continues. ‚ÄúNot only his, but also those that he saw bullying others. His revenge methods range from uploading incriminating video-recordings, through unearthing various other publicly humiliating things, to destroying their family‚Äôs prized vintage car with another makeshift bomb. He also attempted to destroy the home of his main bully with another bomb. Unfortunately, said bully returned home earlier and sustained some injuries.‚Äù Sir Nighteye‚Äôs face flinches. ‚ÄúThen I took the investigation over and, well, I screwed up.‚Äù 

Mirai Sasaki using words like that publicly is a sign of the situation being serious. 

‚ÄúI have managed to locate and gather evidence for Asa being the one responsible for it all.‚Äù Sir continues. ‚ÄúHowever, if anything, I was impressed with the dedication AND his attempts to do the whole thing without spilling blood. My idea was to have him arrested, but provide him with a good lawyer that would picture the whole thing as a case of vigilantism caused by extreme bullying. When that would occur, I would step in, mention that him going to a juvie would only make situation worse, due to his acute insecurities and previous history and I‚Äôd call in the law allowing a hero to personally oversee the reeducation of a vigilante by placing them in the care of their hero agency. He certainly had the smarts and the talent to be a valuable member of mine. Because of that, I asked Smiley, the Rank 55 Hero who is known for being good at dealing with children, to arrest him and explain the situation. And this is where I messed up.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù Nedzu asks, while Sir pauses for a few seconds to gather up his thoughts. 

‚ÄúMe and Smiley severely underestimated Asa‚Äôs anxiety.‚Äù Sir replies. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so bad that the kid is practically paranoid, and that‚Äôs without mentioning at least a handful of other mental issues, such as depression and potential dissociative identity disorder. Only after the fact I got to read his notes and discovered how often he referred to himself as ‚ÄòRabbit‚Äô and began to speak of himself in third person. The point is, he didn‚Äôt believe what Smiley told him at all. Worse, he had an acute panic attack on arrest, that made her search him less attentively to not worsen it further. And worst of all, he expected to be caught eventually and, due to his paranoia, was prepared for that option at any given moment. He managed to escape en route to the police station, despite being handcuffed, and in a police car with two policemen and a Rank 55 Hero.‚Äù 

Eraserhead stares at the hero in disbelief. He isn‚Äôt the only one. 

‚ÄúHe did WHAT?!‚Äù Miruko, as always, is the most expressive. ‚ÄúHow did he do that?!‚Äù 

‚ÄúHe expected to be handcuffed, so he personally sewed in lockpicks to the sleeves of his every long-sleeved piece of clothing.‚Äù Sir Nighteye says. ‚ÄúHe made it so that they weren‚Äôt visible, but could be easily pulled out if you knew they were there. He used said lockpicks, and we aren‚Äôt even sure how exactly, to unlock his handcuffs. When no one was looking, he pulled off two buttons from his shirt and mashed them together. They only looked to be actual buttons, and instead were made from some malleable materials that, when they were mashed together, began to produce lots of acrid smoke. He threw them in a hard to reach place in the car, forcing it to stop on a bridge. When Smiley pulled him out of it, she discovered that the high soles of his boots could be taken off. He hid a flashbang and a smoke grenade inside of them, both of them most likely homemade. He used the flashbang to escape Smiley‚Äôs grip, and then escaped towards the edge of the bridge, only to detonate the smoke grenade. The pursuers thought that he was going to jump off it, but instead he used the cover to flee in a different direction, but not before throwing his shirt, which had some hidden weights inside it, off the rails. The sound of something heavy hitting the water and the smoke bought him enough time to escape off the bridge before Smiley and the policemen figured out that Asa didn‚Äôt jump off.‚Äù Sir sighs. ‚ÄúI was trying to locate him afterwards, but it appears that Kurogiri or Legion did it before me.‚Äù 

Eraserhead is still having problems understanding what he just heard. This went from the level of being an escape artist to the level of being an escape Leonardo da Vinci or something like that. He can‚Äôt even have problems with Smiley for letting this kid escape, because he is lucid enough to admit that there was a fair chance that it would work with him. 

‚ÄúSo extremely intelligent escape artist, capable of planning and executing almost perfectly a weeks if not months-long revenge plan on an entire institution.‚Äù Detective summarizes. ‚ÄúThat had enough foresight to train self-unlocking police handcuffs before starting his plan. And has probably located the nearest precinct and decided that if he gets arrested at home, he can use the bridge between them to escape. Hence the weights. Oh and master of creating makeshift explosives and who knows what else.‚Äù He sighs. ‚ÄúI think we found a Command course student of the Villain Academy. And probably the Legion's new assistant.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh look.‚Äù Miruko says dryly. ‚ÄúThe VILLAIN Academy is more tolerant towards quirkless students than 99% of hero schools in this country. Oh the fucking irony.‚Äù Eraserhead is certain that rabbits aren‚Äôt venomous. But a certain rabbit woman certainly is.

‚ÄúPlease, don‚Äôt start that talk.‚Äù Nedzu is just slightly hurt. ‚ÄúThe UA has already announced the much-needed corrections to its policies concerning issues like that.‚Äù 

‚ÄúGive yourself a #1 Hero School medal and nail it to your head with a fucking jackhammer.‚Äù Miruko replies, with a rising anger. ‚ÄúShowing basic human fucking decency after years of doing nothing is apparently a praiseworthy achievement in this piece of shit country.‚Äù 

‚ÄúPlease, can we NOT fight?‚Äù All Might finally has enough. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre supposed to be working together. Stopping PLF, finding a way to dismantle the League before it becomes the second version of All for One‚Äôs empire, saving people. Anyone still remember those goals?‚Äù

Nedzu and Miruku relent. The day is saved. For the next twenty minutes. 

‚ÄúBe happy that you mentioned the recruitment bit.‚Äù Knuckleduster announces. ‚ÄúOr I‚Äôd fucking punch you in the face for arresting a kid for doing the right thing.‚Äù 

Twenty seconds, Eraserhead corrects himself. It was just twenty seconds. 

Sir Nighteye opens his mouth for some nasty retort. One that will probably including a rebuke of the very concept of vigilantism, bad enough to make Knuckleduster tell them all to fuck off and go home. 

‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ STOP.‚Äù Eraserhead finds himself speaking before that happens. ‚ÄúWe had less arguments and got more things done when we had a villain among us. Stop acting like you need one as a voice of reason among you, and let‚Äôs get some things done instead of trying to murder each other with words.‚Äù 

He just wants to take a nap in peace, is it THAT hard? He had a hard day at school earlier. Most of his days at school are hard, especially now that his students are having issues with what happened at the Training Camp. He didn‚Äôt lose anyone, a true miracle. Even Mineta by some unbelievable stretch of logic of the universe not only didn‚Äôt get killed but also decided to stay in the school. 

But the atmosphere in the class changed a lot afterwards. From happiness to cold determination. 

‚ÄúEraserhead is correct.‚Äù Nedzu takes advantage of the moment - he probably figured out how close they were to having the entire meeting skydive into some nasty place. ‚ÄúWe should focus on the information exchange. If you want to continue learning more about the League of Villains, I can tell you all about my new findings about their members.‚Äù He sighs slightly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mostly the reason why I invited you all, but not Mr. Mikumo.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou have something new?‚Äù Sir Nighteye asks. They share most of their data, but both of them have their own secret little investigations here and there.

‚ÄúActually, quite a lot of things.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúSome might be enlightening, some might be shocking, some might be‚Ä¶ interesting. So, do we do that first or do you want to plan the CRC raid before that?‚Äù 
Chapter 38: Knowledge

Chapter Text

They decided to talk about the League first. Lemillion found that odd, but perhaps understandable. He himself would have preferred to talk about the CRC, because he was still trying to mull over the existential crisis that Izuku gave him with his ‚Äòmotivation talk‚Äô. 

Nedzu starts from the ground level and goes up. The allies are still missing some bits of the knowledge that the UA faculty had for a while. Nedzu decides to picture them as a result of recent investigations rather than risk being attacked for withholding the information. 

They start from Midoriya Izuku. Nedzu mentions his school, his bullying, and his family‚Äôs eventual ‚Äòdeath‚Äô in the house fire. He describes what they know about pre-Legion Izuku - his fanboyism towards All Might and a handful of other heroes, his interest in quirk analysis, his apparent quirklessness and how he is believed to be a late-bloomer. 

This is all met with minimal activity from the gathered allies. This changes when Nedzu moves over to Legion‚Äôs parents. He starts from his mother, who is with absolute certainty identified as Mischief. This is the smaller of the two revelations. Then the rat informs the gathered heroes and a single vigilante that the UA believes (with 80% certainty) that Midoriya Izuku‚Äôs father is All for One. 

Things, understandably, got heated up after that. 

‚ÄúHis father is WHO?‚Äù Knuckleduster is livid. He is at this point certain that his career as a pro hero ended because All for One stole his quirk. 

‚ÄúThis is still speculation on our side.‚Äù Nedzu quickly replies. ‚ÄúWe lack untainted blood samples to run a DNA comparison on Legion. The one we did manage to obtain was tainted heavily, but we‚Äôre almost certain that at the very least he doesn‚Äôt possess the ability to steal and grant quirks.‚Äù 

In-co-rrect. But Lemillion doesn‚Äôt correct the principal, despite Sir Nighteye staring at him from his seat. Mirio Togata developed a particular dislike towards the idea of attacking someone due to being born with some particular quirk. They are going to arrest Midoriya Izuku, but for what he did. He will have no part in some public lynching because Legion inherited a quirk from a monster.

‚ÄúSo he is trying to rebuild his father‚Äôs empire.‚Äù Best Jeanist decides to say. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not exactly comfortable with the fact that we‚Äôre helping him achieve that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are we even allowing him to do that?‚Äù This time it‚Äôs Miruko. 

‚ÄúWell, he is yet to destroy a city or commit a mass murder on some random civilians.‚Äù Lemillion finds himself answering. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd have said that it‚Äôs a point in his favour, all things considered. Especially with the Paranormal Liberation Front going on a rampage.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to add‚Ä¶‚Äù Detective Tsukauchi decides to risk a sudden death and interrupts whatever reply Miruko is preparing. ‚Äú... that the police did gain access to what can be considered a standard treaty for a group trying to join the League of Villains. Legion appears to be completely disinterested in what said groups are doing for the living - we have everything from extortion rackets to human trafficking in their dossiers. But he DOES require the groups under League‚Äôs banner to follow a set of rules. Those include ban on mass murder and generally understood indiscriminate killing of civilians, no attacks on heroes‚Äô families OR heroes themselves while off-work, no attacks on heroes schools without his explicit approval, which we suspect depends on whether he sees them as corrupt, and no intentional harming of children. Accidents in work are one thing, taking a bunch of them hostage is another thing altogether, and that‚Äôs apparently a quote.‚Äù 

Lemillion is slightly distraught by the human trafficking bit. Then again, Legion isn‚Äôt in a position to turn back potential allies. His dream world would probably only have political villains and virtuous heroes, but he is living in the real world. Becoming a Symbol of Evil means taking over the entire underworld, and most of it is to a various degree ugly. Mirio can‚Äôt imagine Legion making a lot of effort to defend really nasty groups from heroes, though. He also regains a lot of points with the rest of the report. 

‚ÄúGive him a fucking medal for that.‚Äù Miruko is just a tiny bit sarcastic. Actually, entirely sarcastic. ‚ÄúWhat did you try to prove with that, detective?‚Äù

‚ÄúAll for One had absolutely no problems with those activities.‚Äù Detective replies. ‚ÄúEspecially the part with killing heroes off-work, using their families to get to them and his servants killing a lot of people at random if they wanted. This, alone, proves that while he is a villain and we all want to arrest him, putting an equal sign between him and his supposed father is a stretch. And don‚Äôt have me start on the fact that even if this is merely a temporary thing, we still can take advantage of him pulling his punches to get rid of the Paranormal Liberation Front AND find a way to eliminate his organization when Overhaul won‚Äôt be there to take advantage of that.‚Äù

Lemillion finds it reasonably admirable that they have to repeat ‚Äòyes, he is a villain but we DO need him‚Äô so often. Heroes shouldn‚Äôt be alright with an arrangement like that. He relates (to a point - they are both trying to fill really large boots AND help the society in their own way) to Midoriya Izuku, but he still does his best to fish for useful intel whenever possible. And he WILL be the one to arrest Legion, at some point in the future. 

Izuku might be a friendly villain, but he murders a lot of his enemies. He murdered a hero (however bad one Thunderbolt was), and had his underlings kill a lot more. He conspires with people like Stain, the Hero Killer. To NOT arrest him is to support his acts. To support his acts is to give them legitimacy. And to give them legitimacy is to make people think that they are acceptable. 

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù Miruko relents. Ms. Joke appears to be somewhat accepting of the deal. Knuckleduster certainly does not, and Miruko is only slightly less angry with it. Best Jeanist and Edgeshot are unreadable. ‚ÄúWho's next?‚Äù 

‚ÄúChronologically speaking, that would be Kurogiri.‚Äù The hologram of a man partially composed of black mist gets displayed right next to Nedzu.‚Äù Warp-gate user, with one of the strongest warp quirks known in history. He can alter the shape of his misty body parts greatly, while using them as warp gates. This is easy when he can see the end point of the warp, but he can do that on a distance unknown but presumably measured in hundreds of kilometers provided that he knows the GPS coordinates of the landing location. If what Lemillion and Gran Torino narrated to us after their brief visit to the League‚Äôs headquarters is to be believed, he is a paternal figure to the majority of the League members. In fact, many of them refer to him as ‚ÄòPapagiri‚Äô, Protective, and appears to have a soft place for children. We estimate that no less than twenty UA students survived the Training Camp attack due to Kurogiri evacuating them to the field hospital.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSounds like a decent guy.‚Äù Miruko comments. ‚ÄúWhat is he doing in the League?‚Äù She doesn‚Äôt add it, but having a hero with a warp quirk that powerful would save hundreds of lives. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve believed I discovered the reason for that.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúHe was lightly wounded during the training camp attack by a stray bullet. It appears that while his limbs and head are made of mist, there is still some flesh left around his chest and abdomen areas. Probably the reason why is wearing armor on them. The tests confirm the presence of two quirks in Kurogiri‚Äôs body, which has to some degree merged into a single one. He also carries certain blood anomalies associated with noumification process.‚Äù Some gasps in the room. Lemillion is surprised as well. ‚ÄúKurogiri doesn‚Äôt appear to have his mental faculties impaired, which we believe happened due to the probably unexpected merger of his original quirk and the one that was granted to him. If our theory about Legion‚Äôs father is correct, Kurogiri might be some form of a caretaker that Legion received from All for One before his demise, and that continues taking care of him and his friends even today.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWho did the body originally belong to?‚Äù Sir Nighteye asks. Nedzu flinches slightly. 

‚ÄúDNA analysis estimates with 98% probability that Kurogiri‚Äôs true name is‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúNedzu pauses for a second. He appears to be conflicted about something, which is‚Ä¶ Lemillion isn‚Äôt familiar with that. ‚Äú... Shirakumo Oboro.‚Äù 

The name is unfamiliar. But not to everyone in the room. 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Eraserhead has a face that will probably haunt Lemillion in his dreams. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid that there are almost no doubts about it.‚Äù Nedzu should probably work on his tact. Not like this could ever happen, but it‚Äôs nice to have some dreams. Eraserhead looks down on the table in front of him, trying to chew through what he just heard. ‚ÄúFor those unaware: Shirakumo Oboro was a second year UA student, and Eraserhead‚Äôs close friend. He perished in a villain attack that we long suspected to be All for One‚Äôs work. He was severely wounded by falling debris and transported to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. I re-investigated the event after the DNA comparison. Imagine my surprise when the doctor who pronounced Oboro as dead turned out to be Doctor Garaki.‚Äù Nedzu sighs. ‚ÄúOboro‚Äôs hero name was Loud Cloud, and his quirk allowed him to create and control clouds. His hair was also partially‚Ä¶ cloudified, for the lack of a better word. If All for One bestowed a warp gate quirk onto him, there is a possibility that it merged with the cloud-control quirk resulting in Kurogiri‚Äôs ability to control cloud-like mist with a warp-gate element. It also expanded the ‚Äòcloudification‚Äô from hair to head and the limbs.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo‚Ä¶ Do you think that he is still there?‚Äù Eraserhead asks. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs brainwashing, then maybe‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúI do not know.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs possible. If you run into Kurogiri again, you should try to call him by his old name. If we catch him, we‚Äôll also attempt to undo the brainwashing. You are free to explain that to Present Mic, he was Oboro‚Äôs friend too. Perhaps if you try it together‚Ä¶‚Äù 

Eraserhead nods. Lemillion feels extremely sorry for him and Present Mic. He imagines losing Suneater only to find him years later as some undead, brainwashed‚Ä¶ something. How much pain would it give to him and Nejire? 

‚ÄúThe next one is Decay.‚Äù Nedzu decides to move on from the subject. Kurogiri‚Äôs hologram is replaced by one of a gaunt young man wearing some black suit and several realistic-looking human hands. ‚ÄúFive-finger point disintegration quirk, expert in close-quarters combat. Currently pending reclassification into an S-Rank. His quirk appears capable of spreading to nearby objects of similar nature, which he proved during the League‚Äôs assault on the CRC. Legion restricted the movement of the clanners with his quirk, allowing this ‚Äòinfectious decay‚Äô attack to turn anywhere between seventy and one hundred fifty clanners into dust within less than five minutes.‚Äù Understandable murmur around the allies table. ‚ÄúHe did this again during the Training Camp battle, this time killing twenty-two villains about to attack Eraserhead‚Äôs class.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat certainly sounds like an S-Rank, at least combat-wise.‚Äù Best Jeanist comments. ‚ÄúDo we have any idea what would be the result of him using this attack on, for example, a concrete building in the middle of Tokyo?‚Äù 

This is an image that Lemillion didn‚Äôt want to have inside his mind. 

‚ÄúNo quirks are without limits.‚Äù All Might speaks up, surprisingly enough. ‚ÄúHis is probably the range from the initial activation point, so it‚Äôs not an infinite spread. If it was infinite, the planet would have collapsed after he touched the ground for too long. This doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Decay can collapse a skyscraper with a single touch, simply by damaging his lower section enough for the rest to come down.‚Äù 

That image is only marginally less bad than what Lemillion had in his mind earlier. 

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know much about him.‚Äù Nedzu adds. ‚ÄúWe have his name, Tenko, but no surname. We know that he is an avid gamer, who spends almost his entire life playing video games in League‚Äôs headquarters. He appears to be a bit of a manchild, who has a tendency to resort to murder against things he doesn‚Äôt like and ‚Äòemotionally shutdowns‚Äô into inactivity when he doesn‚Äôt how to react to some event. Legion is treating him as a sort of an odd older brother, and is Tenko‚Äôs favoured ‚ÄòPlayer Two‚Äô. He is also keeping him on a tight leash when it comes to murder, but isn‚Äôt adverse to using him as a living weapon when the situation calls for it.‚Äù 

Nedzu lied. 

Lemillion doesn‚Äôt have a lie-detection quirk and Nedzu is an expert in pretending to be honest. But Mirio is observant enough to notice a slight flinch at Detective Tsukauchi‚Äôs face. What is Nedzu hiding? He should investigate. But not now. Now he has to admit to something. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to add something.‚Äù Lemillion stands up from his seat. ‚ÄúFor a few weeks now I‚Äôve been in contact with Legion. Through the internet, and under Sir Nighteye‚Äôs oversight.‚Äù Nedzu is startled. Allies are surprised. Eraserhead is pulled back from his state of shock just a bit. Sir Nighteye probably wonders ‚Äòwhy now?‚Äô. ‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt telling me a lot, but he did mention that Decay‚Äôs father hated the heroes for some unspecified reasons. He also said that Decay accidentally killed his entire family during a traumatic first activation of his quirk. He apparently fled the scene and continued to survive on the streets for weeks. He became a victim of a bystander syndrome - citizens expected the heroes to deal with him, while passing by heroes expected the police and child services to intervene. He was eventually found by an unspecified villain, who ended up handing him to Kurogiri, who has eventually become Decay‚Äôs de facto adoptive parent. Legion and Decay practically grew up together after that.‚Äù 

Lemillion finishes and sits down. 

‚ÄúPoor kid.‚Äù Miruko says quietly. Not quietly enough. 

‚ÄúThe unspecified villain is probably All for One.‚Äù Sir Nighteye comments. He is surprised by the revelation (and probably wonders how many things Lemillion hides from him), but doesn‚Äôt show that. ‚ÄúIf Decay was as murderous earlier as he is now, he probably expected his heir to inherit some of said malice. So he had them grow up together.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was apparently even worse back then.‚Äù Lemillion replies. ‚ÄúLegion and Kurogiri managed to get him to therapy. Before it, the hands he was wearing as a part of his villain costume were actual human hands, formerly belonging to his family members.‚Äù A lot of flinches at the images, at least from those who weren‚Äôt already aware of it. ‚ÄúHe was getting panic attacks when they were taken off, and was often seen talking to them, as if they WERE his family members. He was developing into an extreme nihilist and misanthrope, but after a few years with Legion he became somewhat‚Ä¶ functional. Enough to kill only on Legion‚Äôs orders, and no longer hate everyone murderously.‚Äù Lemillion sighs. ‚ÄúHe still hates heroes for never helping him when he needed it, apparently.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnother failure of the system that we‚Äôre now going to have to fight against.‚Äù Nedzu comments. 

‚ÄúFucked up story creates a fucked up man.‚Äù Miruko adds. ‚ÄúAll part of the fucked up society. Wonderful.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNext one is Himiko Toga.‚Äù Nedzu announces, and the hologram is replaced with a girl with golden hair. ‚ÄúShe is‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHimiko Midoriya.‚Äù Lemillion interrupts him. Nedzu stares at him, and he isn‚Äôt the only person to do so. ‚ÄúShe and Legion got married a few days ago. My inquiry for a house address to send a ‚Äòwedding gift‚Äô in the form of heroes has remained unanswered, unfortunately.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù Nedzu decides to not be startled. ‚ÄúShe is an expert fighter when it comes to knives, and possesses a transformative quirk that allows her to transform physically into a person whose blood she drank. She also‚Ä¶‚Äù Lemillion raises his hand. ‚Äú... what is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe has two quirks.‚Äù Lemillion replies. ‚ÄúShe is a rare case of a complex mutant quirk bearer gaining an additional, theme-aligned quirk. Or at least Legion suspects so. That‚Äôs all that was said, but we can probably guess from her villain name and her additional quirk being blood transformation requiring her to suck the victim‚Äôs blood that her complex mutation is based on either some blood-drinking animal or the common cultural image of vampires. This is especially possible due to Legion off-handedly mentioning that not drinking blood gives her anemia.‚Äù

Everyone in the room is increasingly confused by what‚Äôs happening. 

‚ÄúFor how long did you know all that?‚Äù Nedzu decides to ask. 

‚ÄúI learned most of that yesterday. Some a bit earlier than that.‚Äù Lemillion replies. ‚ÄúI have a deal with Legion that the talks will continue and I‚Äôm allowed to try to fish for any useful intel if he slips-up, but I shouldn‚Äôt announce the presence of said talk to anyone unless he agrees to. I said yes, and upheld my side of the bargain. The situation changed yesterday, when he agreed to me coming forward with our contact, allowing me to openly deliver the intel without having to lie to people about their origin.‚Äù The hero shrugs. ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm saying is in no way confirmed, it‚Äôs just what Legion said. He appears to be oddly honest with me, and openly admits to not wanting to say something when he doesn‚Äôt want to, instead of creating a convincing lie. I wish to also state that Sir Nighteye monitors our talks, and that it was through said contact line that we‚Äôve received the intel about the CRC operations.‚Äù 

Sir Nighteye is probably surprised by hearing about him monitoring the talk. Then again, he trusts Mirio - something that goes both ways. Mirio wouldn‚Äôt openly lie to him, and he DID promise to share everything he can from the talks. 

In Mirio‚Äôs opinion, Sir considers this a form of graduation exam for Lemillion. Besides, he knows about 26 dead heroes in Mirio‚Äôs head. All of them former bearers of the same power as All Might. One of them being All Might‚Äôs mentor. He trusts them. So he nods when people look at him for confirmation. 

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù Nedzu decides to accept it and continue. ‚ÄúShe has disappeared from home after she apparently stabbed her father to death. Which happened when she was ten years old. It‚Äôs a fact that I find highly suspicious, and‚Ä¶‚Äù Lemillion raises his hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting the feeling that you should be standing next to me during this lecture, Mirio. What is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúAccording to what Legion told me, Himiko‚Äôs parents considered her quirk to be ‚Äòvillainous‚Äô, ‚Äòunnatural‚Äô and ‚Äòevil‚Äô due to requiring her to drink human blood regularly.‚Äù Lemillion adds. He can see at least few angry faces in the crowd, and they certainly aren‚Äôt angry at him for the constant interruptions. ‚ÄúShe accidentally killed her father in self-defense when he attempted to‚Ä¶ forcefully tear off her fangs, which she uses to drink blood that she requires to stay healthy if not alive. She escaped home in panic, but later on attempted to turn herself in. Unfortunately, the hero she ran into considered her a freak as well, and found some genuine pleasure in beating her up. Fortunately or not, depending on whom you ask, Kurogiri happened to be buying groceries in the area, and has intervened. He killed the hero and took Himiko in.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI sincerely regret the fact that he killed that hero.‚Äù Miruko announces. ‚ÄúIf this story is true, then I‚Äôd really like to meet them. Before kicking them in the face so many times that it would stop resembling a face.‚Äù 

Hearing that the girl apparently had a complex mutant quirk has only made her case more relatable to Miruko. 

Gang Orca nods approvingly. Knuckleduster and Ms. Joke look like they would gladly be there to take pictures or hold the hero in place for the kicks. Eraserhead is unreadable, despite hearing that his old friend killed a hero. 

‚ÄúThat would agree with my findings.‚Äù Nedzu adds with a sorrowful nod. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll double-check everything, and perhaps I‚Äôll manage to find some evidence to form a child abuse case against her mother. Way too late, but‚Ä¶‚Äù He sighs. ‚ÄúAnything else you know about her, Mirio?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly that she practically grew up with Decay and Legion.‚Äù He replies. ‚ÄúIf anything, these three plus Kurogiri can be considered to be the core members of the League. She is an extrovert with a tendency for serious mood-swings, likes ‚Äòcute things‚Äô, and has singlehandedly saved Legion from becoming a shut-in like his adopted brother. He in turn infected her with a respect for heroes worthy of the term, and she is apparently the second member of All Might‚Äôs unofficial fanclub within the League.‚Äù The hero in question stares at him with so many questions that Lemillion isn‚Äôt sure how to start answering them. ‚ÄúHim speaking his mind about villainous quirks only further cemented this state.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ see.‚Äù Nedzu decides to not jump into that rabbit hole. The hologram changes again. ‚ÄúNext one is Mindscrew. Real name is Hitoshi Shinsou. Commander of the Vanguard Action Squad of the League of Villains. We currently believe that his mental quirk allows him to brainwash others into following his orders for as long as he speaks to them and they answer in any way. This isn‚Äôt a pure mind control, all he can do is issue a single command, which is obeyed in a trance-like state. This ties in nicely with his interest in guns - he is a talented sharpshooter and has often used his quirk to force his enemies to leave their covers or deactivate their defensive quirks. He cannot influence higher brain functions, so he can‚Äôt use his quirk for an interrogation. We previously believed that he cannot issue self-destructive orders, but during the training camp battle he brainwashed a QLF officer into commiting suicide with his firearm. The wording of the order appears to be the key - he didn‚Äôt tell him to kill himself, but to ‚Äòpoint his gun towards his head and pull the trigger‚Äô. The videorecording of the event seems to suggest that the soldier was capable of partially resisting that order, but not strongly enough to prevent it from being executed, only to delay it. This doesn‚Äôt seem to be possible against non-suicidal orders.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSounds like a pain in the ass to deal with.‚Äù Knuckleduster replies. ‚ÄúUnless you know how his quirk works. Then all you need is to not react to his taunts.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNot quite.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúHis mask is a voice-changer that, with some small input from its user, can let him ‚Äòborrow‚Äô voices of everyone who spoke in his vicinity. If you suspect him to be in the area, limit yourself to hand signs and do not reply, regardless of who is speaking.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, now that‚Äôs truly a pain in the ass.‚Äù Miruko replies. ‚ÄúSo he just has to be there, and suddenly his enemies‚Äô communication is all fucked up.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt have me started on people like me, who require to communicate with others to activate their quirks.‚Äù Ms. Joke adds. ‚ÄúHe is practically my natural enemy. What about his backstory?‚Äù

‚ÄúHis parents died early in an accident.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúHe was sent to foster parents. Very good grades at school, but suffered from ‚Äòvillainous quirk‚Äô discrimination over his apparent ability to brainwash people who spoke to him. He became a shut-in and switched to online studies at some point around his 14th birthday. Less than half a year later he murdered his entire family, six people in total, before vanishing. He didn‚Äôt reappear before joining the League and...‚Äù 

‚ÄúThey cut off his tongue.‚Äù Lemillion interrupts him. Everyone stares at him. 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Sir Nighteye is the one to voice the unspoken question. 

‚ÄúThey lived in constant fear over Mindscrew controlling them with his quote unquote villainous quirk.‚Äù Mirio replies. ‚ÄúHe apparently snapped at one of his ‚Äòparents‚Äô during some ‚Äòyou are a monster‚Äô rant and used his quirk to make her shut up. They took that as proof that he is a threat, and‚Ä¶ well, cut off a part of his tongue, enough to make his quirk no longer work. They panicked afterwards and switched him into online studying in case someone from school had some conscience left. They thought that nobody would believe him on the internet, but Legion did. So he had Kurogiri warp him out of his room, before Mustard gassed the family into paralysis, and Hitoshi finished the job. He is fanatically loyal to Legion ever since, especially as he found a way to regrow his tongue.‚Äù Lemillion sighs. ‚ÄúMindscrew apparently wanted to apply to the UA heroics course to prove everyone wrong before the tongue part happened.‚Äù

‚ÄúFew more backstories like that and I‚Äôm going to end up applying to the League myself.‚Äù Miruko announces. ‚ÄúFucking shit, this is one of the most fucked up thing I ever heard about, and trust me, I heard about a lot of fucked up things.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI should have said those words ten years ago.‚Äù All Might adds bitterly. ‚ÄúI knew that people were discriminated against for having ‚Äòvillainous‚Äô quirks, but I didn‚Äôt know that things took a dive to this degree in the past few years.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll just add that this is the second most messed-up backstory from the League members.‚Äù Lemillion replies. He gets a lot of stares after that. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm not talking about Dabi. Let‚Äôs continue in order.‚Äù He sighs. He really needs to take a metaphorical or not shower after this. At least he won‚Äôt be the only one who knows those things now. Should make asking Sir or All Might for some guidance easier. 

‚ÄúNext one is Mustard, although his presence in Hitoshi Shinsou‚Äôs house seems to imply that I mixed the chronology.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúHis quirk allows him to generate and control clouds of poison gas, which causes paralysis, unconsciousness or death depending on the density. He is capable of generating a poisonous cyclone several miles in diameter, centered on himself, if given enough time. He proved it by almost single-handedly annihilating the Inhuman Supremacy Party‚Äôs base in Shizuoka. He is one of the League‚Äôs members whose actual name Legion has kept hidden from the world. I managed to find out two days ago, and this is going to be another shocking revelation after Kurogiri.‚Äù He sighs. ‚ÄúMustard‚Äôs true name is Amaya Nemuri. He is a nephew and an adopted son of recently deceased pro-hero Midnight.‚Äù 

This is new even to Lemillion. Legion didn‚Äôt mention Mustard‚Äôs parent name. Oh so many things suddenly clicked. 

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù Eraserhead actually raises his voice at this. ‚ÄúI met with him after her death. He was mourning! You can‚Äôt be serious.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI am.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve kept it under wraps for now, in order to not create another PR disaster, but Amaya Nemuri vanished mysteriously three days ago. I assume that he decided to join the League officially, I‚Äôm also unsure of his motives, but‚Ä¶‚Äù This time he visibly expects Lemillion to pick the subject up. So Mirio does that. 

‚ÄúLegion didn‚Äôt mention the name and didn‚Äôt directly refer to Midnight, but what he mentioned about Mustard makes perfect sense in the context.‚Äù Mirio knows that kicking Eraserhead right now is a low blow, but‚Ä¶ what else can he do? ‚ÄúHis turn to villainy was a form of revenge against his adopted mother. He saw the adoption as some form of community service she did for fame, and never considered her his actual parent. He saw her as spending her entire life working as a pro-hero, as a teacher at UA and the modelling bits rather than take proper care of the child she supposedly adopted as nothing short of parental abandonment. These feelings probably grew in intensity after he participated in the attack on USJ and used his quirk on Bakugou Katsuki‚Ä¶ and she didn‚Äôt even recognize him on the camera feed.‚Äù 

In all honesty, Lemillion considered that a major mess-up on Midnight‚Äôs side. She wasn‚Äôt with them anymore, so we couldn‚Äôt ask her about it, but‚Ä¶ did she suspect that Amaya was Mustard, but decided that it‚Äôs impossible due to him being such a bright and successful student? Or did she truly fail to recognize her own son? Mirio, at this point, wasn‚Äôt sure what to think about Midnight. 

‚ÄúSo he wasn‚Äôt mourning for her.‚Äù Lemillion continues. ‚ÄúHe was mourning the fact that he could no longer get unmasked before her and shout at her that he hates her for everything. If not be the one to kill her.‚Äù Eraserhead stares at him in silent horror. ‚ÄúLegion picked him up because while he considered his villainous motivation as childish, he didn‚Äôt want a living chemical bomb with an intense hatred for heroes to roam the streets without his oversight. When Midnight died, Mustard‚Äôs anger and spite died with her. If what Legion said is true, Mustard left the League and the country. Without Midnight out there, he could no longer imagine himself killing people or being a villain. Legion threw in some face-altering quirk session as a goodbyes for his adopted cousin, and says that no one will ever find him again.‚Äù He sighs. ‚ÄúYou are free to try to prove him wrong, Nedzu.‚Äù 

He personally thinks that if Legion went as far as he said he did (with the DNA obfuscation and maybe even quirk exchange), the chances of someone finding Mustard are minimal. But he wishes Nedzu the best of luck. 

‚ÄúI will certainly try.‚Äù Nedzu replies. 

‚ÄúRegretful.‚Äù Best Jeanist says. ‚ÄúI believe that her intentions with the adoption were noble, especially as she was his blood relative, but‚Ä¶ if this tale is correct, then this is one more proof that you can‚Äôt be a hero for the world if you can‚Äôt be a hero for your own family. Endeavor taught us that much.‚Äù 

‚ÄúPutting them in the same category is hurtful for Midnight.‚Äù Edgeshot adds. ‚ÄúBut Mustard didn‚Äôt see it like that. Our own wounds always hurt us the most. And are the easiest to exacerbate.‚Äù 

Ms. Joke is watching Eraserhead with a pain in her eyes. Lemillion‚Äôs heart hurts while seeing this. 

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ the next one should be Gremlin.‚Äù Nedzu decides to pick the talk and put it back onto the tracks. Lemillion intervenes. 

‚ÄúI believe that it‚Äôll be a good idea to put that on hold for a moment.‚Äù Mirio says. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do her last, please.‚Äù 

Nedzu agrees. So he probably knows the truth too. This is going to be ugly .
Notes:

    I'm seriously considering switching to weekly releases for all of my stories... as much as we all love having daily or semi-daily releases, let's be real. It means much less time for my story to amass comments and kudos before I end up finishing it ;_; People comment much less on finished works, after all. Not to mention being able to amass more backlog and so on.

    And for as much as I hate that fact, my writing IS kind of fueled by me receiving attention from people. Low self-esteem does that to people. Sigh. I was quite happy about getting to 1000 kudos, then quite sad because my two other stories from the series (that I GREATLY recommend) are only about 300 kudos each, then I realized how many kudos actually popular stories have, and ... yeah, here we are.

    Dead on Arrival got an unexpected follow/favourite on FF from one of my favourite authors on FF yesterday, which kind of stopped me from spiraling into a bad place, still. Not a nice evening to have.

    Still need to spend a day thinking about it. Tomorrow's releases of all three stories will be probably accompanied by announcement (or not). Sorry for that, in advance, if it happens, but... well, I kind of want this story to be as successful as possible, you catch my drift?

    [ALSO, DigiWrites, I absolutely loved your bookmark for this story, and liked the one for the Ties that Bind, I'd just like to point out that I have one more story :v Unless it's just not your type of story and you ignored it consciously, then it's alright I guess]

Chapter 39: Mistake
Summary:

    The War Council is concluded. A mistake has been made.

Notes:

    Following what was said the last time, we're switching to the story getting published weekly. Friday around that very moment? Yeah, that should be okay. Also all three stories [YES I HAVE TWO MORE, CHECK THE SERIES THAT THIS STORY BELONGS TO IF YOU DIDN'T ALREADY] will be updated simultaneously.

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

Dabi is old news. Son of Endeavor, with Nedzu and other Todorokis‚Äô confirming his tale. His part of the talk is mostly about what he can do and what he did. Serial arsonist, firepower actually surpassing the former Number Two Hero but lacking his resistance to his own flames. Meaning that there was a limit to how much of his blue flames he could use in short order. 

Intelligent enough to be a dangerous tactician too. He didn‚Äôt have a lot of occasions to showcase it, but there was probably a reason why Mindscrew picked him as his second-in-command. 

Spinner is a bit more complicated. Complex mutant of the lizard variety. Somehow managed to finish university (history), but with grades not good enough to earn him a job while wearing a lizard head. 

No one exactly knows why he turned to villainy. Lemillion corrects that. Not getting a job a few dozen times (and knowing that less qualified people with ‚Äòbetter‚Äô looks got it instead) turned Spinner into a social activist. A run-in with some nasty thug of the Hero Commission (which had issues with Spinner‚Äôs group calling it out on blatant quirkism) turned him into a bitter enemy of state. Finding out that his girlfriend (who was arrested during said hero encounter) was beaten to death in prison (apparently for consorting with a mutant) turned him into a hero-hating vigilante. 

Chance encounter with Stain made his career much longer than it probably would be. Spinner was apparently a gecko-mutant, allowing him to scale vertical surfaces easily - and quietly. Stain and/or League added training with blades and guns. 

Vantablack gets a mention - Nedzu decides to admit to being outplayed like that. Another backstory that appears relatable at least to Miruko. Villainous quirk bearer and a quirkless girl, send to a juvie for stopping a rape - Lemillion is surprised that she didn‚Äôt ask about the hero in question too.

Nedzu mentions Zealot - past acquaintance, but perhaps a necessary one to fully understand the situation. Miruko and Gang Orca are visibly appalled by him being a son of Purity. Their anger vanishes bit by bit as they learn more from Nedzu and Lemillion. About how Zealot began to research the roots of the CRC and understood how evil it truly was. How his quirk (they explain it too, of course) almost died on him at the realization. How he escaped from CRC and turned to vigilantism, targeting various hate groups. How he eventually ran into Stain (who was, at the time, hunting a hero connected to one of those). 

The anger is entirely gone by the time they mention his last stand. How (although it‚Äôs speculation) his understanding that its his last fight combined with the fact that he was the only thing between a horde of monsters and a group of hero students led by a complex mutant made him tap into some previously untouched level of power, annihilating 94 noumus and buying Eraserhead‚Äôs group time to retreat from the training area. 

They finish by mentioning how Legion got to the CRC by following leads given to him by Zealot. And how the supervillain considered this entire operation to be his way of granting his comrade his greatest wish - stopping Purity and the CRC from hurting innocent people. 

‚ÄúWell.‚Äù Miruko interrupts the silence following the last statement. ‚ÄúToo bad I never got to meet him. Sounds like my type of a man.‚Äù She clicks her tongue. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to kick some clanner‚Äôs brain out in his memory.‚Äù

Stain is more of an afterthought. Former hero student who left his school, disgusted by how it focused on popularity and fame instead of saving people. How he drifted into vigilantism and began to purge groups he found unworthy of their names (villains and heroes alike, for as long as he found them wanting in the dedication to their causes). 

Knuckleduster admits to being the one to cave his nose in, after finding Stendhal (old Stain‚Äôs name) unworthy of being called vigilante. How everyone thought that Stendhal was gone, only for him to disappear somewhere, train himself way harder and return as Stain. Even more fanatical and way more dangerous than ever before. 

Lemillion adds how Stain helped Kurogiri and Legion save his soon-to-be sister from Overhaul. How he became Legion‚Äôs ‚Äòadopted uncle‚Äô after it, and how the uncle and nephew re-established contact in Hosu. He admits honestly that he doesn‚Äôt know how Legion got him to work for him, beside the off-handed mention about how Stain‚Äôs respect is easy to achieve when you - as a thirteen years old child - prove ready to stand your ground against an SSS-Rank villain in order to save someone. 

‚ÄúAnd, finally, Gremlin.‚Äù Nedzu adds. ‚ÄúAnother shocking unmasking is in order, though this time it‚Äôs nothing personal to anyone in this room. S-Rank support villain and the head of the newly opened Villain Industries. If my investigation‚Äôs results are to be believed, her quirk is Scope - her eyes can ‚Äòzoom‚Äô and observe things from up to 5km away from her in perfect detail. The real danger lies not in her quirk but in her mind - she is, to be frank, an utterly deranged engineering and programming genius whose inventions appear to be at the very least equal to those of David Shield.‚Äù Some murmurs in the room. ‚ÄúHer true identity is something that certainly can‚Äôt leave this room, even more than the very fact that we‚Äôre having a meeting in the first place. Gremlin‚Äôs true name is Mei Yotsubashi, formerly Mei Hatsume. Adopted daughter of Rikiya Yotsubashi, the CEO of Detnerat Company and, but we‚Äôre still denying it publically, Re-Destro.‚Äù 

Lemillion sighs internally. This is going to be a hard moment. Everyone (well, among the higher ranked heroes) knew that Rikiya was Re-Destro. Government and media were still denying it, because Detnerat was a giant on the Japanese market, especially after its merger with Feel Good Inc. Trying to sink Detnerat risked sinking the Japanese stock market with it. 

It was pretty much a cold war. Government knew, but couldn‚Äôt do a lot. Re-Destro knew they knew, so he stuck to Hokkaido, since if he tried to leave it (even as Rikiya Yotsubashi), the Hero Commission would probably get him killed. Nedzu would help them achieve that, if they asked. 

As far as Nedzu was aware, 95% of Detnerat was clean, and was just a standard lifestyle support slash hero support slash electronics company. The real problem was that its leadership (residing in Hokkaido) funneled funds to the Meta Liberation Army. And was on the verge of achieving monopoly on at least some of the fields mentioned. 

That wasn‚Äôt the worst part, though. 

‚ÄúRe-Destro‚Äôs daughter?!‚Äù Miruko glares at them. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck, first it‚Äôs Purity, now Re-Destro, Legion might be All for One‚Äôs son‚Ä¶ now we just need children of Mr. Compress, Beast and someone from the Paranormal Liberation Front and League scores a fucking bingo.‚Äù There is also the Eclipse‚Äôs daughter, although that one‚Äôs a phony, Lemillion adds in his mind. 

‚ÄúOfficially Re-Destro adopted her after her parents died in an accident and their company, Hatsume Industries, sank and was essentially annexed by the Detnerat.‚Äù Nedzu continues. Lemillion feels a shiver of dread. Because he knows. ‚ÄúHowever, Gremlin went into a psychotic break during the Training Camp battle, which‚Ä¶ unearthed some rather worrying things.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHow much is ‚Äòrather‚Äô?‚Äù Ms. Joke asks. ‚ÄúThe support people almost never get S-Ranks, so I assume that whatever happened had to be really bad.‚Äù 

‚ÄúGremlin began to see everyone around her as Rikiya Yotsubashi.‚Äù Nedzu replies. ‚ÄúShe immediately switched from using her normal gear to weaponry from the‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶ collection she called ‚ÄòDetnerat Specials‚Äô. Before Legion had Mindscrew knock her out she showed five of those. The list includes anti-personnel white phosphorus missile launcher, a form of a spear with a chainsaw at the ends, grenade that didn‚Äôt explode but instead irradiated everything within ten meter radius with instantly lethal amounts of gamma radiation, ‚Äòfield torture kit‚Äô that seems to be converted from some dentist toolkit, and a crowd of small, spider-like robots that swarmed their victims before, errr, performing lobotomy on them.‚Äù The silence in the room is complete. ‚ÄúShe named each and every of her tools. The last one on the list, the ‚ÄòCrowd Control Robot Swarm‚Äô was apparently the number forty on her list of ‚ÄòDetnerat Specials‚Äô, for the record. So we‚Äôre still missing thirty-five of them.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. My. God.‚Äù Ms. Joke, for the first time in ever, stopped looking like she was happy and about to bless the world with some jokes. 

‚ÄúAs I said, rather worrying.‚Äù Nedzu decides to become the master of understatement and continues talking while everyone else in the room is still mortified. ‚ÄúShe was also quite vocal, almost constantly talking to ‚ÄòRikiya-san‚Äô. If my interpretation of her rants is correct and they weren‚Äôt born of her insanity, Detnerat Company destroyed the Hatsume Industries and killed her parents. Re-Destro then legally kidnapped her through adoption and some bribes, and forced her to design things for Detnerat, while pretending in front of her that he actually kidnapped her parents too, and that their survival depends on her work. At some point she must have realized the deception, and has escaped from Re-Destro. Somehow she ended up joining Kurogiri‚Äôs kindergarten for brilliant young villains and is now a part of the League of Villains. Also, if one part of her rant is to be believed, her parents are still with her and are telling her new ideas for ‚ÄòDetnerat Specials‚Äô and keep urging her to ‚Äòshow them‚Äô to the world.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOkay, this is officially the most fucked up thing I have heard about in my life.‚Äù Miruko announces after the silence becomes unbearable. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs worse, her backstory, dead parents whispering her ideas for new horrible weapons of destruction and pain, or ‚Äòcrowd control tool‚Äô in the form of robots performing lobotomy on everyone. I now have images in my mind that I never wanted there and you‚Äôre to blame. Thank you.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd we can‚Äôt hope to do anything about that.‚Äù Ms. Joke says. ‚ÄúBecause Re-Destro is hiding in Hokkaido behind something like a hundred thousand Meta-Liberation Army soldiers, and the government is too afraid of the economic crisis if they try to dismantle Detnerat.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIf that makes anyone feel any better‚Ä¶‚Äù Lemillion decided to speak. He officially hated politics after finding out that a person doing things like that is untouchable despite trying to overthrow the government. ‚Äú... Legion made sure that Detnerat Specials aren‚Äôt for sale. But several hundreds of Hatsume Mei‚Äôs ‚Äònormal‚Äô inventions are. Half of those make David Shield scratch his head in disbelief. So, yeah.‚Äù He sighs. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm kinda surprised that considering what she showed thus far, she is at least an SS-Rank. Is that some sort of anti-weak quirk bias?‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably yes.‚Äù Nedzu replies honestly. ‚ÄúI had to fight that witch to get Ujiko an SSS-Rank designation, because apparently it‚Äôs ‚Äòjust an immortality quirk‚Äô. Ugh. So, unless someone has something to add, we‚Äôve concluded our run through the League members. Or maybe some comments?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI have one.‚Äù Miruko announces. ‚ÄúTable of Rejects will officially refrain from participating in any operations against the League of Villains, even after the alliance ends. From now on, for as long as they are okay with it, we have a non-aggression treaty. Feel free to tell him that, Lemillion.‚Äù 

Nedzu stares at the rabbit woman openly. He isn‚Äôt the only one. 

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù He asks finally. He didn‚Äôt expect those words. Nobody, it seems, expected those. 

‚ÄúDo you know what‚Äôs the best part of being a bratty asshole like me?‚Äù Miruko replies. ‚ÄúI can say what I want, and nobody gives a shit. So I‚Äôll say what I want and then piss off.‚Äù She leans forward a bit and glares daggers at Nedzu. ‚ÄúQuirked and quirkless fought for two centuries before the former won, but neither side ever gave shit about mutants like me. I‚Äôm the first complex mutant quirk bearer in the top 10 hero ranking since its inception, and do you know why I got that high? Not because I‚Äôm strong, not because I save a shitload of people, but because lewd drawings of me are popular on the internet. I could fight Endeavor to a standstill, and I‚Äôd be still popular because rabbits fuck like rabbits so I obviously have to as well. And don‚Äôt have me start on heroes with quirks perceived as villainous, because you won‚Äôt see them in Top 15, and they are at the Table as well. And this is just the surface-level of shittery people like me have to face daily. So if you think that me and the rest of the Table aren‚Äôt one bad day away from going Spinner or Mindscrew on society, then you better think again.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be serious!‚Äù Sir Nighteye decides to speak. ‚ÄúThose are villains, you can‚Äôt just...‚Äù

‚ÄúThey might be villains.‚Äù Miruko grins, baring her teeth threateningly at Sir, who stops talking. ‚ÄúBut I relate to them more than I do to you or All Might. The only reason why I bothered coming to this war council is because I know that Nedzu‚Äôs past is fucked up and he has faced a similar shittery than we do. And because of his recent reforms in the UA, as let me tell you that I also represent two quirkless heroes and twenty-seven quirkless sidekicks in Japan that somehow managed to fool everyone and now live in constant fear that their nature will be discovered and their career and lives will be over. I also know that Overhaul has to be stopped. League of Villains? I don‚Äôt care about their subsidiary groups, they are mostly standard criminals and I‚Äôll continue trying to apprehend them. But the League itself? I don‚Äôt see a villainous headquarters of Legion‚Äôs evil empire. I‚Äôm seeing a safety net that I‚Äôm not sure if this fucked-up society deserves.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSafety net?‚Äù Lemillion is the one to ask. Miruko looks at him with something hard to read in her face. 

‚ÄúPeople like Vampire, Decay or Mustard could become a threat beyond your fucking comprehension.‚Äù She replies. ‚ÄúHow many people could Vampire assassinate with her quirk? Without anyone knowing that‚Äôs her? All she needs is to get a few villain friends, shank Eraserhead a few times and bam, she can enter Nedzu‚Äôs office and stab him through the eye with a fucking pencil. Probably framing Eraserhead in the process, if she plays it correctly.‚Äù She stays silent for a few seconds, letting the vision float in the room. ‚ÄúDecay and Mustard are practically living weapons of mass-destruction. With murder-boner towards the heroes. Now, a thought exercise. How much damage could they cause if Overhaul got to them first and talked them into overthrowing the world as we know it and ending the concept of heroics with it?‚Äù

Silence in the room. Lemillion imagines the PLF‚Äôs warper dropping Decay into crowds of people on the streets. Mustard unleashing his poison clouds on some suburbs during the night, hundreds dying in their sleep before someone would notice the attack and warn the heroes. PLF wouldn‚Äôt even need to move their army or the noumus around to cause devastating casualties. 

‚ÄúLegion picked up people that this society broke.‚Äù Miruko continues. ‚ÄúPeople that had skills and enough spite to use them against everyone, regardless of whether they hurt them or not. People that would have never looked to heroes for help, because the heroes failed them or were the reason for them breaking apart. And instead of using them to murder thousands of people, he got half of them a fucking therapy! Not to mention giving them all a cause that isn‚Äôt mass murder of civilians and heroes. And if you think that the Villain Academy isn‚Äôt the same thing, but on a grander scale, then you‚Äôre all fucking dumb. Anyone‚Äôs willing to make a bet with me that Asa Naoki is getting more psychological help as a villain than he did as a law-abiding civilian?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThis changes nothing, save for the League‚Äôs place on the list of priorities.‚Äù Sir Nighteye decides to pick up the glove and fight. ‚ÄúThey are villains. Their victims might be mostly other villains, but those villains are people as well. Not to mention the fact that their subsidiary groups have way less issues with going after random civilians. We are heroes. It is our job to stop people like that. Their motives and psychological problems influence their prospects on rehabilitation and length of their sentence, not the fact that they have to be apprehended.‚Äù 

‚ÄúFirst of all, Mr. Smartypants, YOU are a hero.‚Äù Miruko replies. She is increasingly angry, but it‚Äôs still manageable. ‚ÄúI might be working as one, but I stopped identifying with that profession long ago, since it never tried to identify with me. I‚Äôm the leader and representative of outcasts hoping to survive in the society that hates them. If I thought that becoming a villain would help them, I‚Äôd walk into the Hero Commission‚Äôs president office tomorrow and dropkick her through the window with a glee on my face.‚Äù Silence in the room. Best Jeanist and All Might stare at Miruko as if they saw her for the first time in their life. ‚ÄúI might work to uphold the law, but if I‚Äôm supposed to choose between it and my conscience, then screw the law. And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not going to fight against the League - because I‚Äôm not going to kill or apprehend people whom I relate with to this degree. You do whatever you want with them.‚Äù 

Lemillion quickly looked around the room. Knuckleduster seemed to agree with Miruko, perhaps unsurprisingly - vigilantes long ago made a choice between their conscience and the law, and their choice was identical to hers. He was probably more concerned with Legion‚Äôs ties with the All for One. 

If anything, Ms. Joke‚Äôs calmness was surprising - she didn‚Äôt look particularly moved by Miruko‚Äôs words, but‚Ä¶ It was less ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not interested in what you are saying‚Äô and more ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not shocked by your words‚Äô. Did Ms. Joke agree with her too? At least somewhat?

Lemillion decided that Nedzu and the rest of the UA had grossly underestimated how angry the Table members were. And if they get the Vigilante Alliance and the Underground Network to agree with them‚Ä¶

Mirio Togata: Miruko seems to like you

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôm 99% sure this is a name of some hentai comic on the internet 

Akatani Mikumo: And I‚Äôm 99% sure that she would kill me for mentioning this if I were a part of the meeting

Mirio Togata: probably yes, to both

Mirio Togata: we‚Äôre planning the assault on the CRC bases

Mirio Togata: still in the room, but I‚Äôm kinda zoning out

Mirio Togata: she is impressed with you picking up people she can relate to and fixing them for as much as you can

Akatani Mikumo: Oh

Akatani Mikumo: did you mention the Himiko surname change and the Mustard retirement bit?

Mirio Togata: yes

Mirio Togata: Miruko told me to relay to you that she wants a permanent non-aggression pact with you

Mirio Togata: you should probably talk with her about details

Akatani Mikumo: Oh

Akatani Mikumo: why are you telling me about this?

Akatani Mikumo: shouldn‚Äôt you try to limit my contacts with her, and act against me on this

Mirio Togata: because I have some very bad feelings concerning her and I hope I‚Äôm wrong

Mirio Togata: very very much

Akatani Mikumo: ?

Mirio Togata: And I don‚Äôt think I can hope on Sir and Nedzu to uncover this, since they aren‚Äôt in a position to do that

Mirio Togata: so it‚Äôs you who is left

Akatani Mikumo: ???

Mirio Togata: You‚Äôll probably figure it out yourself 

Mirio Togata: and then you‚Äôll figure out that I meant it

Mirio Togata: if I‚Äôm right, then be so kind and tell me, alright? Consider this a payback for this 

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôll consider this a challenge

Akatani Mikumo: and I shall accept it

Akatani Mikumo: when I figure out what you mean, and find out if your ‚Äòvery bad feelings‚Äô are correct, I shall tell you about it regardless of the League‚Äôs interest

Mirio Togata: alright

Lemillion decided to catch Nedzu right after the meeting. When that happened, he gestures to Sir that he has something to do (to his mentor‚Äôs noticeable surprise) and follows Nedzu out of the room.

‚ÄúWhat is it, Mirio?‚Äù Principal notices him one corridor after that. Or, to be more exact, they are now alone and he decides to acknowledge Lemillion‚Äôs existence.

‚ÄúYou know something about Decay, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù Principal freezes. ‚ÄúI noticed Detective Tsukauchi‚Äôs reaction. You lied somewhere while talking about him. What was that?‚Äù

‚ÄúMirio, I‚Äôm sure that you mistoo‚Ä¶‚Äù Principal tried to steer him away, but Mirio is past the point of his own character development where it could work. 

‚ÄúPrincipal Nedzu.‚Äù He interrupts his own principal (oh how easily it happens recently). ‚ÄúLegion told me that Decay‚Äôs true name would have hurt some heroes he doesn‚Äôt want to be hurt. I‚Äôm in regular contact with him. I need to know things like that, if I‚Äôm to gauge how honest he is with me.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid that at least at this one point he was very honest with you.‚Äù Nedzu replies. 

‚ÄúAm I on the list of people who would be hurt by this knowledge?‚Äù Lemillion asks. He is going to get to the bottom of this, no matter what. 

He fails to believe it himself, but he actually trusts Izuku Midoriya. Not enough to turn his back on him - they are enemies, and Legion would probably stick a blade where it hurts just to remind Mirio of it. But he has a mission to ensure that someone (whom he can only observe from afar) isn‚Äôt turning into a monster like his father. Father that was an expert manipulator and liar. 

He NEEDS to confirm whatever he can. 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Principal replies. ‚ÄúBut All Might and Gran Torino are.‚Äù The mouse-bear looks up at Lemillion. ‚ÄúAre you ready to lie to them if it means confirming or not Legion‚Äôs words for yourself?‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt even seem angry that Lemillion doesn‚Äôt believe his words. 

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt explain why exactly.‚Äù Mirio replies. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not a matter of whether I‚Äôm ready or not. I have to know.‚Äù 

Silence. Long and hard. Nedzu is calculating something in his tiny yet way too organized brain. Eventually he comes to a decision. 

‚ÄúDecay‚Äôs true name is Tenko Shimura.‚Äù Nedzu says. ‚ÄúHe is Nana Shimura‚Äôs grandson.‚Äù

(dead hero stares in growing horror, her signature smile strangled to death in a heartbeat)

Oh no, Lemilion realizes. Nedzu didn‚Äôt know about his company of dead heroes. He didn‚Äôt know that he just told the truth to the person that it would hurt the most. 

‚ÄúNana gave his son up for adoption to keep him away from All for One‚Äôs grasp.‚Äù Nedzu continues, unaware of what was happening. ‚ÄúHe never understood that and grew to detest heroes. The rest is, as I believe, exactly like what you said back then.‚Äù 

Lemillion‚Äôs connection to the One for All is too weak for a regular exchange of communications. But even then, he still hears the scream.

Mirio Togata: this time it was I that fucked up

Akatani Mikumo: what happened?

Mirio Togata: I cornered Nedzu after the meeting. 

Mirio Togata: he doesn‚Äôt know about the dead heroes in my head

Mirio Togata: so he told me the truth about Tenko

Akatani Mikumo: Oh fuck

Akatani Mikumo: fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck

Akatani Mikumo: any idea about the reaction?

Mirio Togata: either it was a hallucination or I actually heard her scream

Akatani Mikumo: FUCK

Akatani Mikumo: I told you that heroes would be hurt, why did you have to be nosy fucking damnit

Mirio Togata: SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME WHAT HEROES

Mirio Togata: IF I KNEW WHO WAS ON THE LIST I‚ÄôD ASK SIR NIGHTEYE TO VERIFY IT FOR ME

Mirio Togata: I‚Äôm supposed to be your auxiliary conscience at behest of the 26 dead heroes

Mirio Togata: I need to confirm your words wherever I can

Akatani Mikumo: fuck

Akatani Mikumo: you are right

Akatani Mikumo: shit shit shit

Akatani Mikumo: poor communication kills or at least tortures dead heroes

Akatani Mikumo: SHIT

Mirio Togata: what the hell happened with him

Akatani Mikumo: my dad did

Akatani Mikumo: picked him up from the street and decided that making him into a murder machine (not like he wasn‚Äôt one already at this point tbh, father pretty much only conserved his state as he came upon +gave him combat training) was a lovely pastime

Akatani Mikumo: looked forward to All Might‚Äôs face after informing him whom he just punched to death/whom he was facing rn

Akatani Mikumo: then he decided to fuck off from the business and I did my best to unfuck my adopted brother

Akatani Mikumo: but there was too much of it, all I could do was to make him not murder random people out of‚Ä¶ well, him having a bad day or smth

Akatani Mikumo: without Himiko he might have been the one to influence me rather than the other way around

Mirio Togata: your dad - and I don‚Äôt use curse words normally - was fucked up

Akatani Mikumo: tell me something I don‚Äôt know

Akatani Mikumo: why do you think I‚Äôm changing 90% of things after inheriting this burning mess of a collapsed empire

Akatani Mikumo: listen, I have to ask you for something

Mirio Togata: ?

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôm going to tell Nana something. Something that is technically a classified League‚Äôs intel

Akatani Mikumo: please don‚Äôt mention it to anyone

Akatani Mikumo: pretend that you never heard it

Akatani Mikumo: I know I can‚Äôt do much about it, but I want to help her

Akatani Mikumo: she sacrificed everything the good cause, abandoned her son to keep him safe, because she knew that All for One would kill them both

Akatani Mikumo: she doesn‚Äôt deserve to suffer like that

Mirio Togata: it was my screw up that brought all of it

Mirio Togata: Nedzu should have been told about the One for All development at least

Mirio Togata: very well, but I‚Äôm doing it for her

Akatani Mikumo: alright

Akatani Mikumo: we got a few new recruits recently

Akatani Mikumo: one of them is a girl that life fucked up even more than League‚Äôs average

Akatani Mikumo: she run into Decay the first night in

Akatani Mikumo: love at first sight

Akatani Mikumo: they come to my office in the morning, asking me to marry them officially

Akatani Mikumo: Decay was blushing the whole time and told me that she has a beautiful smile and he wants to protect it

Akatani Mikumo: I can see how they act with each other, it‚Äôs like two people broken into halves that discovered that they make a perfect whole together

Akatani Mikumo: He immediately decided to give her his surname, because her family did some fucked up shit to her and he didn‚Äôt want her surname to stick around as a reminder of it

Akatani Mikumo: I gave up trying to repair him at some point, because he didn‚Äôt want to get repaired 

Akatani Mikumo: he was content being the murder machine known as Decay

Akatani Mikumo: I know this mind sound cheesy and weird

Akatani Mikumo: but 

Akatani Mikumo: I knew Decay for years, but I think that when he is with this girl, I‚Äôm seeing Tenko Shimura rather than Decay

Akatani Mikumo: He is a villain and nothing can change this. But for her, he is a hero. 

Akatani Mikumo: I failed to save him, and I don‚Äôt know how to even start saving her, but perhaps they‚Äôll save each other in time

Akatani Mikumo: Also I‚Äôm not sure how much it‚Äôs true, Tenko isn‚Äôt exactly 100% trustworthy when it comes to his memories

Akatani Mikumo: but I think her son was beginning to forgive Nana before his death

Akatani Mikumo: Tenko‚Äôs older sister sneaked home an old Nana‚Äôs poster, and they (plus their mom) had a massive argument about that, when she called him out on hating her for so many years and trying to make them hate her too

Akatani Mikumo: He was shaken, and it seemed like she got a few good hits in

Akatani Mikumo: few days later Tenko had his quirk awakened and‚Ä¶ everyone died

Akatani Mikumo: he would still have his quirk awakened if Nana was there 

Akatani Mikumo: and she probably wouldn‚Äôt, because my father would have killed her earlier

Akatani Mikumo: hell, she could as well join the casualties list, it was a really powerful awakening 

Akatani Mikumo: and they only survived so long because she gave him for adoption

Akatani Mikumo: my father knew about them for years, but didn‚Äôt make a move on them because he had issues understanding positive emotions (at least until he spent a few years with my mom, although that‚Äôs a probability since I‚Äôm not certain about that)

Akatani Mikumo: he thought that she abandoned him fully and he had no value when it came to getting to her

Akatani Mikumo: he kept them under surveillance for years and only intervened after the accident (that she had no hand in creating) because he decided that All Might might get psychologically fucked up from that

Akatani Mikumo: your plan worked, Nana. your sacrifice wasn‚Äôt in vain. it was a freak accident that no one could foresee

Akatani Mikumo: [That‚Äôs all I can say]

Mirio Togata: I‚Äôll tell you if they‚Äôll be any reaction from them

Akatani Mikumo: reaction to what?

Mirio Togata: ah yes, nothing was said, nothing was read, my bad

Mirio Togata: i should probably purge the entire convo before certain rat hacks in to read what was said (as he now knows about it)

Akatani Mikumo: I might have an idea about that
Notes:

    1. In at least the prototype of All That's Left, Gremlin actually had an undiagnosed Class-Six quirk filling her head with engineering ideas (some borderline impossible to make) at an exchange for not being... particularly... sane. With her eyes being implants that she made to fool everyone by making it look like those were her quirk. Whether it's the same here and she fooled even Midoriya - well, leaving that to your headcanon. Still, she can made some really crazy stuff.

    Maybe sanity is a restraint when you are this smart? Hmph.

    2. Midoriya's love for One for All and its past holders is one of his greatest weaknesses, ngl. Seriously, get a grip. And yes, there'll be... consequences for this outburst in the next chapter, though, once again, probably not what would you expect.

Chapter 40: Amusement
Summary:

    Fluff. Like, a lot. But also some menacing moment.

Notes:

    I promised releases on Fridays, but you have a bonus one this week. Both because I'm a bit too anxious to wait until Friday (TOO MUCH TIME) and I need some half-measure to get used to longer releases AND because next chapter of Ties that Bind is goddamn glorious and I need to get it out or I explode. Next one is even more glorious, but this time I can hold myself until Friday. Yay.

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ could have gone better.‚Äù A white haired man admitted. Mirio was, once again, in the hero hall in his head. ‚ÄúBad communication is a pain.‚Äù 

White hair. Red eyes. Mirio understood who he was facing immediately. The First Holder. He once again tries to speak to the heroes he meets in his dreams and, to his surprise, he manages to. 

‚ÄúYou. F...first.‚Äù It was a massive struggle. Words refused to come through until he really, really focused on them. If he lost said focus, everything was undone in an instant. 

‚ÄúYes, that I am.‚Äù The man in front of him replies. ‚ÄúYoichi Shigaraki, the first holder of the One of All. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm the creator of it, since that honour unfortunately belongs to my dear brother. Hisashi Shigaraki or, apparently, Hisashi Midoriya.‚Äù 

Mirio expected hatred in his voice when brother was mentioned. Instead, there was just an emotional void. Not what he expected from a ‚Äòreverse brocon‚Äô. Then again, how many years can you be emotional about something like that? 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve decided to come as the second one.‚Äù He continues. ‚ÄúSince Nana is‚Ä¶ currently indisposed. We would have all died of boredom if we just hung around people‚Äôs heads. Contrary to popular opinions, people‚Äôs lives aren‚Äôt THAT interesting. And seeing people attend the hero schools for the tenth time in a row gets repetitive. So we can ‚Äòzone out‚Äô, which is something like a dream state. Most of us are like that now that All for One senior is out. The last thing we did with full attendance was deciding how to react to the fact that Legion is his son.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThey‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt?‚Äù He tries to reply. He isn‚Äôt sure if he managed to convey his meaning properly, but Yoichi quickly proves that he did. 

‚ÄúThey do.‚Äù He replies. ‚ÄúThey see what you are doing. They still know what‚Äôs happening and will eventually show up to assist you. They are conscious, just‚Ä¶ differently. Nana retreated to that state after she heard of what happened to her family. But she did see what my nephew wrote, I‚Äôm just not in a position to know what she thought about it.‚Äù He sighs. ‚ÄúShe is a tough one, so I‚Äôm optimistic. Although this was a hit in the worst possible place for her.‚Äù 

Lemillion can understand that. 

‚ÄúLegion?‚Äù He asks. Yoichi smiles. 

‚ÄúSmart one, aren‚Äôt you? All Might make a good choice.‚Äù Being complimented by the source of his quirk, the - to quote Legion - pretty much a fabled demigod who forged a sword to slay the demon lord in some mythical antediluvian age is an interesting experience. ‚ÄúYes, the talk is at least partially about him. Before we start, let me reassure you that as of now, our opinion on your‚Ä¶ friend? Nemesis? Friendesis?‚Äù Mirio has no idea what to call it either. ‚ÄúWell, it didn't change. He is on probation, and he will stay on it until his death. He has the most dangerous of all quirks out there AND has my brother as his father. If anything, I find it miraculous that Hisashi failed to make him into a perpetually hateful monster hating the very concept of heroics. And while I believe in miracles, I prefer to be cautious.‚Äù He pauses for a few seconds. Mirio finds the strength in himself to nod, showing that he agrees. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt stop me from being interested in my nephew, you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn...terested?‚Äù Lemillion asks. Yoichi nods.

‚ÄúI thought that my family had ended when All Might defeated Hisashi.‚Äù He replies. ‚ÄúNow I know that I have a nephew, who doesn‚Äôt appear to be a maniacally evil monster like my brother. Plus a sister-in-law, whom I know nothing about. And apparently an adopted niece. So of course I‚Äôm curious about them. But‚Ä¶ there is something else.‚Äù Yoichi sighs. ‚ÄúListen, I spent many years fighting my brother. Then even more watching others do the same. I know how dangerous he is. And I know how much of a master liar and strategist he was. I might have gone a bit paranoid in the meantime, not gonna lie. And so I can‚Äôt help but be worried when my nephew keeps using terms like ‚Äòmy father‚Äôs defeat‚Äô, ‚Äòend of my father‚Äôs career‚Äô, or ‚Äòhim getting punched so hard that his face stayed on the fist‚Äô... but not even once using the word ‚Äòdeath‚Äô or ‚Äòdead‚Äô.‚Äù  

Lemillion‚Äôs eyes widen. 

‚ÄúThis is most likely me being paranoid, as the others appear to be disagreeing with me.‚Äù Yoichi admits, and Mirio doesn‚Äôt doubt it for a second - one of Japan's first heroes is honest in that statement. ‚ÄúI saw the battle from the first person perspective. I saw how bad the beating Hisashi received was, and I saw him knocked out cold with a lethal amount of wounds. He had quirks that could save his life even in that state, but All for One requires its user to issue verbal or thought orders to activate quirks. I know that his body was recovered and he was confirmed dead in the hospital, but now I also know that he had many of those infiltrated. My estimation is a 95% chance that he died, and only about 5% chance of him surviving. Albeit if the latter option is correct, he certainly ended up in a way worse state than All Might.‚Äù

‚ÄúS...sister.‚Äù Lemillion pushed the word out of his mouth. Yoichi nods. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs correct. Her quirk could certainly heal him from his wounds.‚Äù The hero replies. ‚ÄúIzuku finding her for him makes perfect sense in this scenario. Having her heal All Might back to full strength makes absolutely no sense, however. If he recovered, he would certainly keep his son and potential heir on a tight leash. He was‚Ä¶ controlling, to say the least. And being part of his family didn‚Äôt save you from that. Consider this a favour for me, and attempt to learn more about Legion‚Äôs family. Inspect his wording, Look for discrepancies. Investigate the hospital that All for One was sent to after the battle. I‚Äôm almost certainly wrong on this, but with Japan being in the state that it is currently, we cannot risk even the faintest chance that my brother is alive.‚Äù He leans forward towards Lemillion. ‚ÄúDo this for me, alright?‚Äù

TinTinCan: I am not sure if I‚Äôm comfortable with this ‚Äòidea‚Äô of yours.

SmallMight: oh please, lots of non-villains use the Network

SmallMight: and its almost perfectly untraceable

SmallMight: 99% sure I run into Eraserhead on some public forum once

SmallMight: someone mentioned planning a robbery, and then someone with a nickname of ‚ÄúNapNeeded‚Äù came around and called their plans illogical

SmallMight: they agreed to a meeting for him to straighten out their plan and prove them they are actually wrong with it

SmallMight: never heard from them again so I guess it was a logical ruse

TinTinCan: I see.

TinTinCan: That truly does sound like Eraserhead

TinTinCan: also

TinTinCan: Your uncle Yoichi is pretty chill guy

SmallMight: what

TinTinCan: got to meet him tonight

SmallMight: oh

TinTinCan: Nana is still‚Ä¶ indisposed

SmallMight: well, shit

TinTinCan: we'll see how things go

TinTinCan: your uncle seems crazily curious about you and your family

SmallMight: understandable I guess

SmallMight: check this out

TinTinCan: Oh my god

TinTinCan: is that‚Ä¶ All for One?

TinTinCan: WEARING AN ALL MIGHT APRON

TinTinCan: [and looking like he wants to murder someone, but that I can understand]

TinTinCan: I urgently need context for this

SmallMight: Bakugou burned me at school while mom was on a trip for a few days. I was 7 years old I think?

SmallMight: so I returned home and there bam, my father notices it and goes batshit angry

SmallMight: school has no idea how close it came to getting annihilated, he actually started looking for appropriate villains to destroy it for him

SmallMight: would have done that in time but he was looking for villains that could make people die REALLY painfully

SmallMight: and told me that I'm never again going to a school

SmallMight: he was a bit of a control freak at times (Yoichi can probably attest to that)

SmallMight: Then mom comes back, hears what happened and goes ballistic on him over his controlling tendencies and trying to murder people 'for me' without, you know, me wanting to (I was 7 years old ffs I barely realized what death is back then)

SmallMight: Dad ended up having to wear an All Might apron for a week as a punishment

SmallMight: Mom started to use it as a type of a 'dunce hat' slash timeout corner after that

TinTinCan: ‚Ä¶

(somewhere in a hero's head, an ancient white haired hero stares at the conversation with shock on his face, while a black whip user falls from his chair in laughter)

SmallMight: also not sure how much of a crime that is

SmallMight: probably unnoticeable next to others I think

SmallMight: but he cheated at Monopoly REAL hard

TinTinCan: ...

TinTinCan: you were playing MONOPOLY?!

SmallMight: YES

SmallMight: Tried Uno once but we don‚Äôt speak of this incident again (Kurogiri broke a wine bottle accidentally last time it was brought up, he was playing with us that time and has some BAD memories)

SmallMight: also dad stopped cheating at Monopoly when mom got angry and stole his every building (plus phone, home keys and wallet, but that might have be due to old habits kicking in) in like two seconds while he looked away from the board

SmallMight: then she listed the ones he shouldn‚Äôt have without cheating, gave back the remaining ones and had him wear the apron for one day per unlawfully owned property

SmallMight: actually now that I think about it that picture might be from after the monopoly incident

TinTinCan: your mom has to be a fascinating woman

SmallMight: I KNOW

SmallMight: MR. COMPRESS IS PRACTICALLY SALIVATING OVER HER AND IT PISSES ME OFF

SmallMight: ugh

SmallMight: letting them meet was a mistake and I should probably confiscate those friendship bracelets ;_; 

SmallMight: I‚Äôd be ok with Kurogiri but not Mr. Clownlord ugh

 

(Izuku Midoriya is a reasonably paranoid teenager - if Mirio talked with Yoichi Shigaraki, he is going to sneak in a few more suggestions that his father is truly dead, just in case. Besides, if something happened to his dad, he WOULD be ok with Kurogiri becoming his new father, at least after a while)

 

TinTinCan: Yeah I can imagine that this can be awkward. 

SmallMight: HE HAS HER POSTER IN HIS BEDROOM 

SmallMight: AND SAYS THAT IT‚ÄôS BECAUSE HE IS A CONNOISSEUR OF FINE ARTS

SmallMight: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

TinTinCan: ouch man xD

TinTinCan: this really sucks

TinTinCan: I‚Äôm 99% sure that All Might has one too, but he isn‚Äôt admitting 

SmallMight: WHY ARE YOU MAKING THIS EVEN MORE AWKWARD

SmallMight: Ugh

SmallMight: She is a bit chubby (lost some weight recently and is exercising properly, though), she wields a newspaper like a sword, can kill you in a 100 gruesome ways with her well-honed CLASS TWO quirk, she used to jump between rooftops of buildings

SmallMight: oh and once chokeholded my dad into unconsciousness because he was actually trying to go murder Bakugou Katsuki

TinTinCan: SHE WHAT

SmallMight: but now she is mostly busy crying when she sees me on the TV (because she is proud AND worried), plus cries or faints from relief when she sees that I did something big but escaped without being captured

SmallMight [turns out that if you spend two centuries calling out your quirks vocally due to being a drama queen and now someone randomly starts choking you, you can go down like a little bitch without putting up a fight because you are out before you manage to summon some strength quirk with your mind]

TinTinCan: oh my God

TinTinCan: >200 years of amassing impossible degree of power to defeat the worst villain ever

TinTinCan: AND A HOUSEWIFE DEFEATED HIM FIRST

SmallMight: AWESOME HOUSEWIFE AND AN AWESOME MOM

SmallMight: BE MORE PRECISE DAMMIT

SmallMight: returning to the subject

SmallMight: SERIOUSLY WHY ARE PEOPLE SEEING HER LIKE ‚ÄúTHAT‚Äù

SmallMight: UGH

TinTinCan: you do realize that Yoichi would probably propose to her at this point if he could

 

(he would, and he isn‚Äôt only one among the dead heroes who would do that)

 

SmallMight: WELL FUCK YOU TOO MIRIO

TinTinCan: can I show that image to All Might, please?

SmallMight: trying to change the subject

TinTinCan: yes

SmallMight: awesome

SmallMight: go for it, did he stop vomiting blood when startled?

TinTinCan: Yeah, full recovery

SmallMight: phew

TinTinCan: Give me a second

 

***

 

TinTin: Please do not kill me for this, but I have something urgent to show you all. 

SuperPunch: Something from your other chat?

TinTin: yes, something from Legion (which is why I‚Äôm sending them here, with Nedzu excluded)

DeadpanStalker: Do it then. Something about the CRC raid?

TinTin: No, but I think that in those trying times we all need some good laugh

DeadpanStalker: Said like a true hero.

LieDetector: Fair

TinTin: AND HERE IT GOES

LieDetector: What?

DeadpanStalker: I‚Äôd like to inform you, Mirio, that All Might was eating a cheeseburger when you sent it and you‚Äôve almost had him choke to death on it. 

DeadpanStalker: Good job, I‚Äôm proud of you.

DeadpanStalker: That‚Äôs some good joke. 

DeadpanStalker: photoshop?

TinTin: Apparently not. He was cheating in monopoly and Mischief had him wear that as a punishment. 

DeadpanStalker: what

TinTin: But you are free AND encouraged to analyze it if it‚Äôs a photoshop

TinTin: I‚Äôm curious about it myself.

TinTin: No picture of the other incident I just heard about, the one where AlO wanted to violently murder Legion‚Äôs bully, so Mischief ended up having to chokehold him into submission.

TinTin: Apparently All for One was such a drama queen that he got super used into calling his quirks vocally, and she got him unconscious before he managed to call out quirks to defend himself in his mind. 

TinTin: He ‚Äòwent down like a little bitch without putting up a fight‚Äô, to quote Legion. 

DeadpanStalker: what

LieDetector: and now you broke him too

LieDetector: Gran Torino is probably seeing it too, but can‚Äôt reply due to injuries (they are installing the prosthetic replacements today)

LieDetector: so on behest of the only person still capable of talking on that chat (namely, myself), I‚Äôll just say WHAT THE HELL MIRIO

TinTin: Had a talk with Yoichi Shigaraki, the One for All 1st Holder (and All for One‚Äôs brother) this night, he is super interested in the newest addition to the family. So in his name I‚Äôm interrogating Legion about details and he is talkative.

TinTin: I‚Äôm doing my best not to phase through the chair and the floor due to losing control over my quirk over laughing too hard

TinTin: Winning thus far but hard to say how long it will take

TinTin: gtg bye

 

***

 

TinTinCan: All Might almost choked on a cheeseburger

SmallMight: LOL

SmallMight: now I want one too but Kurogiri gets assy about us eating junk food ugh

TinTinCan: Also I‚Äôve decided to spare them from knowing what sort of nickname you are using here 

TinTinCan: Seriously man this is weird

SmallMight: one of my old (when I was 4-5 years old) ideas for my future hero name

SmallMight: every single one had Might in it, no points for figuring out why

SmallMight: I‚Äôm too ashamed to mention any other, but I was 4-5 years old so it‚Äôs probably understandable

TinTinCan: ‚Ä¶ 

TinTinCan: Yoichi called you my friendesis. 

SmallMight: this sounds like some nasty disease, some odd version of scoliosis or smth

SmallMight: wait so am I a scoliosis of your moral spine

TinTinCan: I hate you.

Rabbit is surprisingly happy. Surprising is both the degree of his happiness and the fact it actually exists. 

He is at this point almost certain that Toxicity and Juggernaut are fully honest with him. That they aren‚Äôt false friends like those that backstabbed Rabbit when they suspected that he was quirkless. After all, they now KNOW. And are still hanging out with him. They don‚Äôt seem to be preparing some grand moment of humiliation to him, or at least he saw no signs of that. 

Odd. Rabbit is confused. More than he already was. 

League members are strange, too. They seem supportive of him. Especially Legion. He keeps complimenting Rabbit for his questions and ideas, and doesn‚Äôt discourage him from speaking. In most cases he pointed out flaws in Rabbit‚Äôs logic, but didn‚Äôt seem angry at him for them. 

(he was just making it so that Rabbit would lower his guard and let him steal his quirk, he knows it) 

Awoo and how much she changed is probably the strangest thing ever. Or at least that‚Äôs what Rabbit thinks until Legion suddenly looks at him over a map of Purity‚Äôs base. 

‚ÄúWould you like to be adopted?‚Äù He asks. Rabbit is startled. ‚ÄúBy some actually nice people.‚Äù 

‚ÄúW...what?‚Äù Rabbit somehow manages to reply to that. 

‚ÄúSorry, that was a strange thing to ask about.‚Äù Legion says, scratching his temple. ‚ÄúDo you remember Mischief?‚Äù

‚ÄúM...mischief?‚Äù Rabbit replies. ‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ that nice lady that teaches us how to walk quietly and steal things and brings delicious food?‚Äù She was certainly a favourite of all of his classmates. Only Kurogiri played in the same league when it came to popularity.

She actually said that Rabbit had a talent for staying unseen. He wasn‚Äôt sure why she said that. 

‚ÄúYep.‚Äù Legion replies with a smile. ‚ÄúShe happens to be my mom. She has already adopted someone, my younger sister, after something nasty happened to them. And I think she likes you.‚Äù

Rabbit doesn‚Äôt know what to say. Rabbit doesn‚Äôt know what to think. He just stands there, in silence. 

Why is Legion saying this? Is he trying to make him lower his guard? But, he has so many friends in this building, no way that Toxicity and Juggernaut could save Rabbit from him (if they would even try to). So why? Why? Why Why Why Why Why? 

‚ÄúJesus, Rabbit, I was just asking.‚Äù Legion replies. Rabbit must have made his confusion visible. (Legion will spot his weakness and attack now). ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to agree if you don‚Äôt want to.‚Äù 

Why isn‚Äôt he doing anything? Why is Legion retreating like that?

Rabbit has enough. He has friends now! He isn‚Äôt going to back down like that! He will stand up for himself at least once!

‚ÄúIs‚Ä¶ is t‚Ä¶ is this about my quirk?‚Äù He manages to say, his eyes locked on to Legion‚Äôs face. 

‚ÄúWha‚Ä¶‚Äù Legion stops mid-word and freezes. ‚ÄúOH. Wait, did you think that I brought you here because of your quirk?‚Äù Rabbit nods. He is prepared. He had time to hide some surprises in his new clothes. He isn‚Äôt sure how he‚Äôll escape the building, but he will. Bomb should open a wall. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know that you have a dormant quirk until I tested you in my office!‚Äù 

‚ÄúKurogiri.‚Äù Rabbit replies. ‚ÄúHe probably found out somehow and told you.‚Äù He isn‚Äôt backing down. He stepped out, so he is sticking to it. 

‚ÄúThis is highly unlikely considering the fact that he doesn‚Äôt have an appropriate quirk.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúHe actually suspected that you were quirkless, but still asked me to take you for an internship. He was impressed with your smarts and planning and decided that you‚Äôd benefit from this.‚Äù 

Was Legion saying the truth? Kurogiri acted nice to Rabbit. Was he really that nice? Rabbit isn‚Äôt sure. Why would he be like that to him? Did he have anything to gain from it? 

‚ÄúThey really messed you up, didn‚Äôt they?‚Äù Legion says, and Rabbit is even more startled. ‚ÄúNo matter how many times I honestly state that you are smart and resourceful and a great help to me, you still think I‚Äôm just trying to have you lower your guard for something nefarious. Right?‚Äù Rabbit doesn‚Äôt answer (he is too afraid to answer). ‚ÄúSo. What exactly is it that you are afraid I‚Äôm planning?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre going to‚Ä¶ ssssteal my quirk.‚Äù Rabbit mutters. His vocal cords refuse to work as intended. 

‚ÄúAnd why do you think I can do that?‚Äù Legion asks. Something in his face is‚Ä¶ is. But Rabbit isn‚Äôt sure what it is. 

‚ÄúS...Sunset has Ec..Eclipse‚Äôs quirk.‚Äù Rabbit decides to be suicidally brave, an act that surprises him more than anyone else. ‚ÄúA‚Ä¶ and you said that QEM is‚Ä¶ yours, so‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúSee, Rabbit?‚Äù Legion replies with a smile. ‚ÄúThere are probably a few dozen veteran heroes and police detectives out there that, at this point, know that I have something to do with the QEM creation. All of them know that I was the one to take down Eclipse. No one made the connection. Nedzu probably thinks that it‚Äôs a possibility, though. And he has one of the strongest intelligence quirks in history. But unlike you, Nedzu knows almost for certain that I‚Äôm the legendary Quirk Thief‚Äôs son.‚Äù 

Rabbit stares at Legion in shock. That legend was real? And was Legion‚Äôs dad?! 

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt bring you here and had you work alongside me because you have a dormant quirk.‚Äù Legion continues. ‚ÄúKurogiri mentioned you to me because even without a quirk you still have a brilliant mind. And I agreed because he told me what you did with your school and I was extremely impressed. Your quirk, whatever it will be, is just an added bonus that I discovered when I actually tried to GIVE you a quirk to help you with your lack of confidence and assertiveness.‚Äù 

Legion was‚Ä¶ actually planning to GIVE Rabbit a quirk? He thought about this, but.. he had no idea why Legion would bother doing this for Rabbit. 

‚ÄúBesides, I made a decision to only steal the quirks of people that managed to really piss me off.‚Äù Rabbit gets startled by it - did he qualify for this? He certainly did! He shouldn‚Äôt have said all those things after all! ‚ÄúThus far the only people to qualify for it did so by either torturing my adopted sister for more than two years or by trying to burn the society down while graciously ignoring the fact that said burning only makes quirkless be more discriminated against. You really don‚Äôt make the cut for that, Rabbit.‚Äù 

Rabbit is incredibly, incredibly confused. Is Legion speaking honestly? He never heard about Legion being able to steal quirks in the media. Was it some sort of secret? If so, Nedzu knowing the truth made sense. Rabbit heard that he was extremely smart. But‚Ä¶ nobody else? Really?

Was Legion his friend after all? Like Toxicity and Juggernaut? 

‚ÄúListen, Rabbit.‚Äù Legion interrupts his thoughts. ‚ÄúThink about what you heard for a while, alright? The offer is still on the table. Mom actually gave you the biggest slices of her food because she thinks you need to eat more, so she is already acting motherly around you.‚Äù Rabbit it, once again, startled. So it wasn‚Äôt his imagination? ‚ÄúAlso I have an adopted younger sister and grew up with Decay and Vampire, both technically older than me. But I never had a younger brother. So, if you want a family, an ACTUAL family, all you need to do is to tell me. Alright? And I‚Äôm not going to be angry if you say no.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù Rabbit wasn‚Äôt sure how to reply to all of that. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ see. I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll think about this.‚Äù

The High Cathedral wasn‚Äôt just a base of the CRC. It was a fortress. A private property. It was originally the base of the first Meta-Liberation Army, which somehow survived the Destro‚Äôs failed coup. All for One knew about it. When the survivors of the MLA gathered in it‚Ä¶ well, he was never one to ignore such a buffet of tired and weakened people carrying powerful quirks. 

It lay abandoned for almost a century. Or, to be exact, not entirely abandoned. Several villain groups moved in over the ages, maintaining the location. Even All for One used it for a while for one of his many operations, before moving it elsewhere. When asked about the reasons, he said that he doesn‚Äôt trust places like that if can‚Äôt find a permanent owner. It was probably a form of a joke coming from a man who massacred two-hundred twenty seven people from the group that built it, and was directly responsible for the situation. 

The main part of the base was underground, covered by not only earth but also a dense forest. The CRC expanded it under Purity‚Äôs orders - they had to hide their main force somewhere. But they wanted to avoid making things appear suspicious. So no imposing bulwarks of concrete, instead a network of smaller outposts on the surface, each of them well-stocked in defensive measures. All of them are bigger on the inside - mostly by being deeply dug in. 

On one hand, the Creature Rejection Clan forces defending the High Cathedral couldn‚Äôt instantly overwhelm any attackers, due to being scattered around. On the other, they‚Äôve managed to amass astounding amounts of wargear over the years. Purity, for all her faults, was a brilliant organizer. 

Worst of all, investigating the High Cathedral was almost pointless. Air recon would only spot the surface installations (and there weren‚Äôt many of those). Vampire would have to attack someone per every installation to check AND Purity knew about her quirk at this point. Vantablack was their only option, and he did manage to learn a lot, but he wasn‚Äôt a perfect and infallible mean of recon. 

In the end, they manage to successfully locate seventeen camps in the general area of the High Cathedral AND learn of the approximate number of active CRC members (750) living in the area. Vantablack has also managed to establish a contact with their spy on the inside, however for all her ability to steal data from Purity‚Äôs command center thanks to some Gremlin‚Äôs babies, her knowledge of the greater High Cathedral was limited. 

No one had any idea of just how far Purity's paranoia and preparations went. Nor about the recent re-awakening of her quirk. Nor about the fact that Zealot had a younger brother. 

If Midoriya Izuku knew about those, he would have made vastly different plans.  
Notes:

    Rabbit needs a lot of hugs. Thankfully, he's going to get them. Also in case you didn't notice, the next chapter is going to include a lot of batalistic scenes. And perhaps a wish or two getting fulfilled...

Chapter 41: Battle
Summary:

    The League of Villains clashes with the Creature Rejection Clan. Things don't go as in canon.

Notes:

(See the end of the chapter for notes.)
Chapter Text

The first minutes of the battle couldn‚Äôt, technically, be considered a battle. It was a massacre. Absolute one sided, and with the defenders unable to respond in any coherent way - their one and only reaction was dying in droves.

That‚Äôs because people in the modern times were way too reliant on quirks for combat. It was sad, in Izuku‚Äôs opinion. Why use combat quirks when you can smuggle firearms or a good old bomb and use them instead?

Fourteen outlying outposts of the Creature Rejection Clan were obliterated during the first seven minutes of the battle, with Kurogiri or Sunset warping bombs inside them and then vanishing before the detonation. Bombs were made by Gremlin, of course - everything that was left of said outposts were smoking craters. 

League of Villains killed 156 CRC soldiers without the defenders being able to fire a single shot back. The remaining three outposts were located, unfortunately, located within the range of the High Cathedral‚Äôs warp coordinate scramblers. Then again, they had their own uses - thanks to Vantablack‚Äôs surveillance placed inside them, Legion could see what was happening inside. Hear the orders issued to those inside of it.  

Kurogiri and Sunset - acting in tandem thanks to support items given to them by Gremlin, one that automatically suppressed the others‚Äô warp quirk while the other was warping elsewhere - started transporting the small army that Legion assembled for the battle. 

That‚Äôs where things began to divert from the plan.

 

***

 

Purity ran into her command center just in time to feel the ground tremble. Someone brought in artillery. 

Great. 

Her son is already at the post, observing the numerous screens in front of him. His face indicates that his quirk is active. Some of her staff officers are shouting something in the background, but she filtered that out. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening?‚Äù She asks her son. He feels oddly out of place, wearing a black T-shirt and short trousers in a place filled with robes and other religious paraphernalia. She tolerates it. He‚Äôll come around.

‚ÄúWe are under attack.‚Äù Rai‚Ä¶ no, Mastermind, she was supposed to use his villain name, replies promptly. ‚ÄúAlmost everywhere at once. Heroes are storming our bases outside one by one. Someone just blew up outposts three, four, seven, eight, ten, twelve, thirteen, fifteen, nineteen, twenty-one, twenty-three, twenty-five, twenty-seven and twenty-nine. From this and the fact that artillery rounds are raining on this base we can easily guess that it‚Äôs not the heroes that are attacking the High Cathedral. My guess would be‚Ä¶ the League of Villains.‚Äù 

Right. He told her that what happened at the Training Camp proves that the League isn‚Äôt averse towards cooperating with the heroes. And that their intelligence network was dangerous.

‚ÄúHigh chance of Bishop-level leak, considering the number of bases located.‚Äù Mastermind adds. Purity doesn‚Äôt want to hear any of that, especially on days such as the current one. So one of her lieutenants is untrustworthy? She will deal with that later. ‚ÄúMy recommendations are the defense plan Delta for the outlying bases, and Gamma for the High Cathedral.‚Äù 

She doesn't waste time looking at the displays. If Mastermind is opting for THOSE plans right off the bat, it has to be bad. Every second is valuable. Her staff officers are eyeing her in silence, waiting for her confirmation. 

‚ÄúDo it.‚Äù Officers return to work, Mastermind nods. Orders leave the High Cathedral. Throughout Japan, the heroes storming various bases of the CRC find the cultists to be in full retreat, abandoning their equipment and taking off their robes to vanish onto the streets. Those that manage to avoid the pursuit reach the designated safehouses, where they are picked up by the Paranormal Liberation Front‚Äôs warper.

She is hemorrhaging her negotiation strength, but if she doesn't agree to that, she‚Äôll soon have none of it left. 

‚ÄúWhat about the High Cathedral‚Äôs defence?‚Äù She asks. Gamma plan is much less defined. It‚Äôs, in short, ‚Äòwe bleed the enemy before retreating‚Äô sentence, with details depending on who is attacking them and with what strength. ‚ÄúAre we moving out?‚Äù The outlying bases that survived the initial attack were bound to fail on their own. 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Mastermind replies. He is, as he typically does, mostly emotionless while planning. ‚ÄúThe League of Villains expects us to do that. They are hoping that we‚Äôll send reinforcements to the external bases. Their warper gives their forces a much greater mobility, which will allow them to launch harrowing attacks and gradually weaken our forces. We have a chance of victory for as long as we remain in the range of the warp scramblers. I recommend having the external outposts evacuated, save for those best hidden. They should maintain radio silence and await an order to attack the League‚Äôs forces attacking the main base from behind, or go after the enemy command post if we locate it. I also recommend increasing security in the warp scrambler room.‚Äù

Purity is certain that he will take the CRC from her in a few years. At most. She isn‚Äôt even angry about that. He could even kill her after this, and she would still be proud of him.

 

***

 

‚ÄúWell, there goes plan A.‚Äù Legion announces from his field command post. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt take the bait.‚Äù 

His screen is much smaller than the one Purity has in her base, but he sees the rough gist of the CRC movements thanks to Gremlin drones. They do not attempt to reinforce the external bases or abandon the High Cathedral as a whole. Instead they see at least ten groups of clanners retreating towards the main base. 

In an orderly fashion. 

They are way too orderly for Legion‚Äôs taste. He expected a lot of robed fanatics, but instead he sees an army. Their robes are cut in a way to make them easier to move AND they are wearing what appears to combat vests on it. Plus an assortment of brawl weapons, with some rare guns. Many appear to be instead trained with their quirks. 

‚ÄúWe have plan B, right?‚Äù Sunset slash Blueberry decides to be an ass to him from her own command post. The Quirkless Equality Movement sent a hundred reasonably trained soldiers to assist the League, but the part with Sunset being part of it still isn‚Äôt public. So she is stationed a bit away from them. She even brought two heavy self-propelled artillery guns and started to shell the CRC main base.

Officially, Purity had an alliance with Eclipse. And that‚Äôs enough for the QEM to take an open stand against her. 

Said guns also have the ‚ÄòManufactured by Villain Industries‚Äô stamps on them. It was very Gremlin thing to do to move from support items to literal military hardware when only he let her out of his eyesight for a while. They were built from scrap, so would probably be taken out with a good quirk-powered punch, but a gun is a gun. 

‚ÄúOf course we have.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs going to end up uglier than I thought. Kurogiri, I‚Äôm sending you the coordinates of the retreating CRC columns. Give them hell.‚Äù He receives a short ‚Äòyes‚Äô in response. One minute later, people start dying.

 

***

 

‚ÄúAs expected.‚Äù Mastermind comments. ‚ÄúThey are going after our retreating units. With their warper transferring them from one group to another. Fatal mistake.‚Äù 

Purity spent the last ten minutes watching her men and women butchered. Mastermind noted down a handful notable members of the group used for those attacks with his emotionless voice. Competent B and C-Rank villains who are smart and disciplined enough to follow orders, with three A-Ranks among them. Those were the Kurogiri himself, and two former Shie Hasseikai members - the Rapper (Kendo Rappa) and Power Punch (Rikiya Katsukame). 

Mercenaries, Mastermind told her. Probably hired for the job. They were strong enough for such guerilla attacks. Power Punch was clearly boosted with Trigger, allowing him to sap enough vitality from the CRC soldiers to become a bullet-proof juggernaut. He went in first, turning the clanners' attention to him. While they were busy shooting him, the mercs hidden in the woods rained death on them. Whoever appeared tough enough to withstand that was left to get duelled to death by the Rapper, while Kurogiri, Power Punch and the mercs warped elsewhere. 

They lost close to seventy soldiers (‚Öì of them not killed, but scattered throughout the woods, typically wounded) before Mastermind decided that he learned enough about the enemy tactics. 

When Kurogiri and Power Punch appeared to attack another squad, he waited for just the right moment before pushing the button on the command console. 

The convoy that went under attack exploded. 

 

***

 

Sunset recovered Kurogiri‚Äôs body. In time for Izuku to resurrect his uncle number one. Unfortunately, he had that standard ‚Äòvacant‚Äô eyes of freshly resurrected people. Power Punch was practically vapourized (he was bulldozing the convoy when everything around him exploded) and Blueberry failed to find anything left of him. Mercs were evacuated, but most sustained at least some degree of wounds. Rappa was left stranded in the forest elsewhere.

Izuku was absolutely livid. They just lost their best warper, and with him, the majority of their advantage in maneuverability. He could live with that, but if Kurogiri stood closer to the explosion when it happened‚Ä¶ 

No time to think about it. The battle wasn‚Äôt going well at all. 

But if the enemy didn‚Äôt know about Sunset‚Ä¶ huh. There was a window of opportunity for them, especially as they still had some information advantage over the enemy thanks to Gremlin‚Äôs drones stalking the battlefield. 

If he was the enemy commander, then considering the knowledge available to him, he would‚Ä¶ 

Suddenly he sees close to two hundred cultists detaching from the enemy main force and heading towards QEM positions with at least twenty noumus as a vanguard. The position that they knew of (had to trace the rounds back) that was also impossible to be easily evacuated now that the League‚Äôs warper had been eliminated. 

Exactly what Legion would do, if he was the enemy commander. 

‚ÄúSunset, I need you to move the Vanguard to the following coordinates. Mindscrew, hide and wait for my further orders. You are supposed to attack the enemy left flank from the north, but wait until it passes by you. Compress, how many clones did Twice make already?‚Äù

The answer was satisfying. He sent some more orders, almost painfully conscious of Rabbit being increasingly anxious about the whole thing next to him. He quickly pulled out a phone. 

 

SmallMight: How‚Äôs it going

TinTinCan: Reasonably well. 

TinTinCan: Miruko just kicked Deathmonger through the window on the twenty-seventh floor. 

TinTinCan: After telling him that ‚Äòthis one is for Zealot‚Äô. 

SmallMight: wow I like her even more now

SmallMight: the rest?

TinTinCan: enemy scattered, attempt to hide among the general population, police and the heroes are outdoing each other in arrests

TinTinCan: The High Cathedral?

SmallMight: Fucking mess

TinTinCan: What?

SmallMight: Have Nedzu and Sir Nighteye look through the data they have on potential Clan associates

SmallMIght: CRC has a commander on the level of those two and me. 

SmallMight: Thus far he or she are countering my every move

SmallMight: seems quite willing to spend manpower in suicide attacks and have them die to gather intel, which is probably the only reason why I‚Äôm winning in kill/death ratio

SmallMight: I have something in preparation that should do the trick, but it‚Äôs going to be way more bloody than I planned for. 

SmallMight: gtg, evil plan to execute

 

Two hundred cultists clashed with the QEM forces half their number frontally, while the Vanguard Action Squad approached it from the north and the crowd of fifty Rapper‚Äôs clones (with a similar number of Twice clones) from south. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúUnexpected.‚Äù Mastermind announces while the advance unit begins to retreat after suffering heavy casualties in a partial encirclement. ‚ÄúThis shouldn‚Äôt be possible. Enemy forces most likely in possession of another warper. The artillery position is defended by soldiers fighting quirkless, so I suspect that Sunset and the Quirkless Equality Movement are here. The presence of someone with a quirk allowing them to create copies of themselves and others is another unknown factor. Our main force depleted to an unacceptable level to achieve total victory in this battle. I recommend abandoning the base to preserve our combat strength for future engagements.‚Äù 

QEM forces were bloodied quite badly in the clash, Purity could see it on the screens. Every officer had cameras as a part of their outfits, meaning that she got to see the defeat of their assault group up close. 

She doesn‚Äôt like the fact that it happened. Her people are dying out there, and she can do nothing about it. 

‚ÄúWe should damage the enemy some more.‚Äù She decides, although her heart bleeds. ‚ÄúIf we deal enough damage to Legion, or even better, capture him, then Overhaul will look more favourably at us. And we‚Äôll need his favour to rebuild ourselves after this mess.‚Äù So many years of organization building, undone in a span of a day. 

‚ÄúUnderstood.‚Äù Mastermind replies. ‚ÄúSilence‚Äôs decapitation strike against the enemy command post is 80% ready. We can achieve both objectives at once, if we abandon the base now and draw the Vanguard Action Squad‚Äôs forces away from Legion‚Äôs current position. Our main forces should retreat westward. However, the presence of Sunset changes my estimations of the Silence‚Äôs attack. Success might require some alterations to the plan.‚Äù

‚ÄúExplain?‚Äù Her son requires more and more input the longer his quirk remains active. This included asking questions when needed. 

‚ÄúThe chances of Silence eliminating Legion before Sunset evacuates him or warps in reinforcements are 20% at best.‚Äù Mastermind replies promptly. ‚ÄúDeploying you and the Templars while using Long Step as means of transport and evacuation raises the probability to 100% unless some unexpected factor comes into play.‚Äù 

‚ÄúVery well.‚Äù Purity replies. ‚ÄúI shall do it, then. Retreat with our main forces. Take Incense, Pain and Infection with you. If I‚Äôll not return, Infection is the Clan‚Äôs new commanding officer until she deems you ready to take over.‚Äù Infection was, all things considered, the only one she could trust with that. 

Finally. Some action. 

 

***

 

SmallMight: Well, fuck.

TinTinCan: WHAT NOW?

SmallMight: I‚Äôve managed to weaken them enough for them to abandon the base. 

SmallMight: Their commander seems to have given up for now.

SmallMight: But I have close to 350 well-organized fanatics with majority of their high ranking officers (and, probably, Purity) retreating westward in an orderly fashion, with further ~100 of wounded and exhausted survivors of crushed units following in tow

SmallMight: I‚Äôm sending Vanguard +something to keep pushing them towards hero assault unit, but expect a tough fight

TinTinCan: I‚Äôve come prepared. 

SmallMight: You‚Äôre here yourself?

TinTinCan: Me, Sir, and something like fifty other heroes, including Mount Lady (she should help scatter their forces around before we move in) 

TinTinCan: Keep pushing the cultists towards us and get ready for the mandatory brief clash afterwards

SmallMight: aye aye 

SmallMight: fuck

TinTinCan: ???

TinTinCan: ??????

TinTinCan: What‚Äôs happening?

 

***

 

Legion understood that he just let the enemy commander play him like a fool when he saw the cultists emerge from the woods like fifty meters from his command post. Without any prior warning. Even Gremlin‚Äôs drones failed to notice anything. 

He hit the panic button on the command computer Gremlin made for him. Sunset should start warping in reinforcements soon. They just needed to hold the ground. 

Something like sixty cultists approaching. Led by a woman in some differently marked robes, and probably with someone with a quirk responsible for them being able to hide from detection. 

Legion had himself (far from being a dangerous combatant outside of some special circumstances), the interns (minus Awoo, she was inseparable from Decay at this point and Decay was elsewhere), mostly unconscious Kurogiri, one of the Gremlin‚Äôs craziest babies and‚Ä¶ 

Himiko is going to kill him for staying (almost) alone in a moment like this, doesn‚Äôt she? He did it again. 

Legion, Toxicity and Juggernaut dove behind the metal covers that Gremlin surrounded the post for them. Legion pulled Kurogiri and Rabbit with him. As the first bullets bounced off the covers, the Baby - in fact Gremlin‚Äôs first full-sized combat robot - began its counterattack.

Izuku, at this point, was no longer capable of being surprised by the things Gremlin made. Baby #434 was a three meter tall juggernaut of steel and heavy armor, built like All Might but armed with guns. He began spraying the incoming crowd, forcing it to disperse and score some kills. 

It couldn‚Äôt tank super strong attacks. Rappa (the only person from the former Shie Hasseikai that Izuku was lowkey liking) would punch it into a scrap in five seconds tops. But here it was facing a crowd of people armed with baseball bats, knives, light guns and some weak quirks. It should be enough. 

But it isn‚Äôt. 

Not when Purity and a crowd of at least twenty more soldiers - each of them looking significantly bulkier and meaner than the ones that were attacking them, wearing different looking red robes - takes that very moment to just randomly warp right next to Legion‚Äôs command post. 

Warp. CRC had a warper and never showed that to the world. 

Purity is wearing her standard weird kinda-anime-like nun outfit that probably didn‚Äôt fit any outfit used by an actual religious organization. Then again, knowing Purity‚Äôs‚Ä¶ behaviour, Legion was surprised that it wasn‚Äôt made of latex and with a whip attached to the waist. 

The cultists surrounding her were obviously buffed with her quirk. Much more than he thought was possible. They looked grotesquely oversized, like some discount Zealots. 

Baby #434 attempted to turn towards the new arrivals, but it failed to do much before two of the cultists tore it apart. 

The interns did their best. It wasn‚Äôt enough. 

(elsewhere, someone gets the message that their baby just died and its father is in danger. The scream and a thundering sound of baby #56 meshes into one, deafening sound. Another person latches onto them right before the take-off)

 

***

 

‚ÄúWell, you are surprisingly weak for a triple S, Legion.‚Äù Purity says. She seems to enjoy talking and playing with them. Rabbit doesn‚Äôt like that. Rabbit is angry! She hurt his friends! Juggernaut and Toxicity are both bound and lying on the floor. She is unconscious, while he is staring angrily at Purity. Kurogiri is next to him, either unconscious or staying silent. 

Legion is immobilized and has his hands bound behind his back. There are those weird soldiers around them, and Rabbit is certain that no help is coming. Kurogiri is out, Sunset is elsewhere and the CRC has a warper of their own. Legion told him about the warp interference. 

At least twenty minutes until the nearest group (the Levellers) could get here with enough manpower to achieve anything. The first thing Purity did was to tell them that their warper needs just ten minutes of recharging to evacuate them all.

It‚Äôs bad. Very bad. Rabbit is scared. Rabbit is angry. His arm still hurts after one of the soldiers applied too much force while incapacitating him and broke it. But he threw a small bomb at him, and now the soldier is blind! Unfortunately, soldiers of the first CRC group joined them and got buffed almost as much as those crazy strong ones that accompanied Purity first. 

‚ÄúAnd you have surprisingly many children for someone wearing a nun outfit.‚Äù Legion replies. Legion is fearless. Rabbit wants to be like that! How do you get as brave as he is?! Rabbit is too scared to do anything, despite being angry. He is too powerless to do anything. 

Something deep inside him breaks slightly. He starts to feel strange. As if‚Ä¶ he hears static, like some old broken television. It‚Äôs weak but seems to be growing in intensity. What‚Äôs happening to him? Did he hit his head when the soldier pinned him to the ground?

‚ÄúOh, how mean.‚Äù Purity puffs her cheeks out a bit. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre totally my type, you know? Young but not unreasonably so. Cute and lively, too. Unfortunately, Overhaul will probably take you from me.‚Äù She adds, with just a hint of a sadistic glee in her eyes. Rabbit can see only half of her face from his position, but he both recognizes it and doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs like his bullies' eyes, but also something else. He doesn‚Äôt like else. 

Purity steps aside and stands next to Rabbit. He can feel her fingers on his cheek. She lifts his head to look at him. 

‚ÄúThat one‚Äôs a bit too young looking, but if I guess he‚Äôll do.‚Äù Rabbit doesn‚Äôt like that. He hates that. He hates hates hates hates hates hates‚Ä¶

Something changes. Something‚Ä¶ is strange. Something happened when she touched him. He isn‚Äôt sure what, but‚Ä¶ 

Wait. Is this Rabbit‚Äôs quirk? Legion told him to tell him when he feels strange, but‚Ä¶ he can‚Äôt do it right now. Is it his quirk? How to use it then? What does it do? He remembers that when other kids awakened their quirks, they could use them easily. Did Rabbit not get a manual or something? 

‚ÄúTouch him again and I‚Äôm going to murder you.‚Äù Legion says while glaring at Purity with absolute fury in his eyes. Rabbit is‚Ä¶ Rabbit is shocked! Legion was serious! He likes Rabbit! He wouldn‚Äôt say things like that if he didn‚Äôt. 

Purity smacks her lips. Second or two later the CRC soldier holding Legion smashes him into the ground. He yells in pain. 

No no no no no no no no no no no no no no!!!

‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs your name, little one?‚Äù Purity looks weirdly at Rabbit. And he decides that he is going to be like Legion. Legion is awesome! Rabbit will be like him! He will be brave!

" D...drop d..dead.‚Äù Rabbit manages to utter. Something inside him shifts. Static in his head lessens, and he feels lightheaded.

Purity obediently falls to the ground like a marionette whose strings were cut, her face frozen in a look of surprise. She isn‚Äôt moving anymore. She isn‚Äôt breathing. 

Rabbit is startled. What just happened? Did he‚Ä¶ did he just use his quirk?! 

Soldiers around them scream in pain. Something (is that Purity‚Äôs quirk?) being torn away from them. The red robbed soldiers that arrived with her are influenced the most, they are vomiting blood around and squirming on the ground. Those that arrived later are weakened and confused, but are still standing.

Legion is startled almost as much as Rabbit is. Rabbit didn‚Äôt know that this was possible. Then again, he didn‚Äôt think that him using a quirk was possible.  

Juggernaut stands up. The cultists that were holding him are incapacitated, so he pushes them aside, his fist landing on one of the still standing soldiers. He immediately charges towards a man in the backline that Purity mentioned to be their warper. The few still conscious and fight-capable cultists rally around him, their only ticket out. Few more charges towards Juggernaut from the side.

Toxicity seems to have regained her consciousness, she is still wobbly, but manages to push a button on her mask. It‚Äôs a support item that Gremlin made for her. It kept filtrating her poison from her breath, gathering it in a concentrated form. Now it unleashes it as a cloud, enveloping the group about to attack Juggernaut. Enough to knock them out. Then she falls back to the ground, her strength spent. 

‚ÄúNO!‚Äù A woman shouts. The leader of the initial attack group. She is furious and tearful at the same time. Rabbit freezes when he realizes that she is pointing a gun at Legion! 

Rabbit tries to move. Do something. He can‚Äôt. But then a thunder strikes. Something comes flying, almost too fast for Rabbit‚Äôs eyes to follow. He sees something pink while the incoming object flies beside the woman with a gun. Blood gushes, and the upper half of her body drops to the ground. The pistol fires, but the bullet flies towards the skies, not wounding anyone. 

The projectile stops. Or, more like, crash lands twenty meters away from Rabbit. Rabbit stares in awe. He sees Gremlin rising from the smoke, looking like she went through a grinder. She is armed in a long sword, now covered with blood. Her face screams murder. Another figure is right beside. Rabbit recognizes Vampire!

The two girls, despite being heavily wounded and battered, immediately leap at the nearest cultists. 

Juggernaut knocks out the warp quirk user. The five weakened cultists surrounding did their best. But it wasn‚Äôt enough. Legion told them about the warp interference thing, so he knows he has to be proactive. When the warp quirk man falls to the ground, Juggernaut‚Äôs beating continues. 

Remaining cultists charge towards them. They know that it‚Äôs over, that with Purity‚Äôs death and their quirk user being out they can‚Äôt hope to escape. They don‚Äôt care. They want revenge. 

Juggernaut‚Äôs strong enough. He kills the warp quirk user in time. A blood red circle opens up mid-air, and Sunset steps through it. More of them begin to open around her, and Rabbit sees familiar faces emerging from it.

He sighs with relief. And loses consciousness out of quirk exhaustion. 
Notes:

    I'm not pulling this out of an ass. You knew that he had a quirk brewing. And judging from the fact that while powerful and versatile (no, it's not a death note quirk or anything, it'll be explained in next chapter once Izuku has a moment to think about it), it's still far weaker than Asa's quirk from Ties that Bind and Dead on Arrival, the stressful and life-threatening situation has forced it to awaken ahead of schedule as an emergency survival measure. Before it fully developed. It'll probably have a semi-mandatory awakening to its full potential in a year or two (so after the story is concluded).

Chapter Text

SmallMight: time to reschedule the clash

TinTinCan: What happened? 

TinTinCan: I was worried.

SmallMight: Too wasted for it

SmallMight: CRC had a fucking warper

SmallMight: warped Purity and twenty of her elites right into my command post

SmallMight: just as another sixty regulars appeared out of nowhere under some detection suppressing quirk

SmallMight: Sending coordinates for you to pick up their corpses

TinTinCan: Purity‚Äôs dead?! 

SmallMight: Completely. 

SmallMight: My assistant got a fucking power-up by LATE-BLOOMING out of nowhere when she was about to warp me to Overhaul and killed her into super-death

SmallMight: This game has a fucked up plot omg

TinTinCan: Assistant? Asa Naoki? 

SmallMight: so you knew, huh

SmallMight: Yeah, Rabbit. We have second proof after Miruko that rabbits are nasty little fucks probably planning to end Mankind 

SmallMight: (sorry for excess swears but I just almost died and I‚Äôm dealing with some serious stress here)

TinTinCan: understandable

SmallMight: I hope he‚Äôll say yes and mom gets to adopt him

SmallMight: I also hope you find and fucking murder whoever was in charge of CRC during that battle

SmallMight: they are dangerous, and if they get back to Overhaul we‚Äôre FUCKED

SmallMight: I sent fifty quirk clones I have left towards you as a ‚Äòclash‚Äô we promised, give them a good fight

SmallMight: we‚Äôre pulling the fuck out, we have too many wounds to patch

TinTinCan: alright, good luck with that

‚ÄúI have an idea!‚Äù Izuku announces. He, Mindscrew and Rabbit are the only people in the living room. The rest is either in their rooms, or still resting after the battle. 

It was a nasty battle, that‚Äôs for certain. Legion messed it up. Still, Zealot‚Äôs wish was fulfilled. Purity was dead. Heroes and the League swept through something like 80% of the Creature Rejection Clan, although the remnants probably escaped into the Paranormal Liberation Front‚Äôs care. 

The Inhuman Supremacy Party announced that it joined the PLF one day after the battle. Sunset picked up Incense, Zealot‚Äôs old acquaintance and the League‚Äôs spy in the CRC from a place a few kilometers away from the battlefield, after she fled the CRC escape convoy in the confusion caused by the hero attack. 

So, they achieved something. But less than he hoped for. 

Vampire was probably still going to kill him over almost dying again. Despite being the one who latched onto Gremlin, when she powered up her jetpack and apparently FLEW over the forest at dangerous speed towards him. Like some female Iron Man with mental issues. But for now, both of them were still unconscious. Izuku found it miraculous that they managed to stand up and continue fighting for a while after THAT crash. 

‚ÄúIs‚Ä¶ it about my quirk?‚Äù Rabbit asks. Legion is almost uncomfortable with how often he feels the kid‚Äôs gaze on him. 

He finished narrating what he ‚Äòfelt‚Äô during his quirk activation. And Legion is probably the only person who knows what to expect from a Class-Six quirk. Namely, everything. Class-Six quirks by definition defied established logic of the world and/or quirks. And while the idea he has is preposterous, it makes sense in the context. 

‚ÄúYep!‚Äù Legion says and smiles widely. They are all sitting in front of the TV, where the news anchor is narrating the results of the raid. The CRC is de facto down, Purity is dead and the complex mutants throughout the country are probably celebrating. ‚ÄúCan you please touch Mindscrew for me?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhy am I supposed to be the lab rat in this?‚Äù Hitoshi decides to be an ass about it. ‚ÄúAre you going to have him kill me to prove a point?‚Äù

Izuku heard about his performance during the battle. He starts to suspect that Hitoshi decided that he likes killing people. His first kills were probably too emotionally satisfying. Another problem to face. Killing him once or twice would probably not straighten him out, though.  

‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm right, he‚Äôll be your second most favourite member of the League after me.‚Äù Legion promptly replies. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, don‚Äôt be scared.‚Äù 

Hitoshi sighs and extends his hand. Rabbit - obviously nervous about it - touches it. Nothing happens, but it‚Äôs to be expected. This is (once again, if Legion is correct, an EXTREMELY powerful quirk) only the first half of the activation conditions. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say anything.‚Äù Legion says and Rabbit nods furiously. ‚ÄúDid you feel the same thing as with Purity when she touched you?‚Äù Rabbit nods. This means that his quirk has just ‚Äòlocked-on‚Äô to Hitoshi, marking him as a potential target. It‚Äôs like with Sir Nighteye‚Äôs Foresight, which requires him to touch someone first and then look them in the eyes. Although the second condition is a bit different. ‚ÄúNow say: ‚Äòwell-rested‚Äô.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell-rested.‚Äù Rabbit obediently says. 

Hitoshi exhales deeply as something in him changes. The bags under his eyes decline in size and intensity. The look of his eyes‚Ä¶ sharpen, in a way. He is startled by the change. 

Legion chuckles. He has a confirmation. And this is one of the coolest quirks he ever heard about! All Class-Six are super cool! 

‚ÄúWh‚Ä¶ what?!‚Äù Mindscrew is still startled. ‚ÄúWhat just happened?!‚Äù Rabbit looks at Legion for answers. 

‚ÄúAlteration of states of living organisms.‚Äù Legion replies with a smile. Rabbit looks adorably confused when he is trying to unpack his words. ‚ÄúTotal command over the status conditions, to speak in Tenko‚Äôs terms. When you touch someone, you ‚Äòmark‚Äô them for your quirk. Then you need to clearly say what‚Äôs the desired state. When you told Purity to ‚Äòdrop dead‚Äô, your quirk read the latter word and ‚Äòaltered her state‚Äô to that of being dead. When you told Hitoshi ‚Äòwell-rested‚Äô, your quirk instantly alleviated his symptoms of not sleeping enough. Rendering him ‚Äòwell-rested‚Äô.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù Hitoshi stares at them both. ‚ÄúOkay, now I understand why you said that he is going to be my second favourite member.‚Äù 

‚ÄúRabbit isn‚Äôt and won‚Äôt be your personal anti-insomnia medications.‚Äù Legion decides to complain. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, using such an awesome quirk for something like this is a waste. Also you‚Äôre supposed to tell me if you feel changes vanish. We need to gauge the details of this quirk before we move over to teaching Rabbit how to control it properly!‚Äù Hitoshi appears completely betrayed by his words. ‚ÄúAlso, Rabbit, you need to figure out how to name your quirk, so‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúTotal Command!‚Äù Rabbit says and practically beams. 

Izuku recognizes his earlier words. Does Rabbit look up to him THAT much now? The soon-to-be Symbol of Evil is deeply confused. What exactly did change? 

‚ÄúWell, why not.‚Äù Izuku says. Rabbit beams once again, and even more this time. Izuku starts to feel the heavy burden of being looked up to by a younger sibling, despite Rabbit not being his younger sibling. 

They have to do so many tests now!

‚ÄúUhm‚Ä¶ Legion sir‚Ä¶‚Äù Rabbit suddenly amps up the shyness factor. ‚ÄúCan we‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶ talk in private for a second?‚Äù



***

 

Rabbit says yes. 

Izuku is almost floating under the ceiling when that adorable mass of anxiety (that also looks like Legion‚Äôs second coming) says that he is willing to give the concept of family a second chance if it means that he‚Äôll have Izuku as an older brother. 

He fails to stop himself and hugs Rabbit tightly. Which, all things considered, was a so-so idea considering Rabbit‚Äôs quirk. Thankfully they quickly discover that saying ‚Äòunchanged‚Äô safely disconnects Rabbit from other people. 

 

***

 

Izuku: I DID IT!!!

CatThief: What did you do this time, Izuku? 

CatThief: You just opened a chat for us three, so‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just slightly worried.

CatThief: Your dad is playing with Eri downstairs so give him a moment to join.

Izuku: Ok

DemonLord: I‚Äôm free for a moment. What happened? 

Izuku: oh there you are

Izuku: I‚Äôm going to have a little brother!!!

CatThief: Oh

DemonLord: Wait, Inko you are pregnant?!

CatThief: There have been a worrying‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶ miscommunication

Izuku: YOU DIDN‚ÄôT TELL HIM?!

DemonLord: Tell me what?! 

CatThief: Izuku approached me with an offer to adopt his new assistant

CatThief: I said that I‚Äôm willing to consider it

CatThief: I assume that the assistant in question said yes.

DemonLord: oh

DemonLord: Would be nice to be informed BEFORE getting the papers done, you know that?

Izuku: She was probably running DNA tests on him in secret to find out if you cheated on her with his mother.

DemonLord: What?

Izuku: But you still have your eyes, so I guess you passed. 

DemonLord: Explanations, please.

Izuku: He has messy (black) hair, light freckles, is even smoller than me, is a late-bloomer (awoke a quirk literally yesterday), has a brain to match me (needs a lot of training, confidence and experience, but eventually he is going to be Sir Nighteye to my Nedzu, watch my words) AND loves quirks.

Izuku: Literally everyone who sees me thinks he is my blood relative because he is so similar to me

DemonLord: I understand the DNA tests then.

DemonLord: But if I was insane enough to cheat on a woman who literally stole my heart when we met for the first time, I wouldn‚Äôt be capable of ruling Japan for two centuries. 

Izuku: Oh, yeah, I almost forgot that. Startling her by your surprising appearance was a bad idea for someone this intimidating, wasn‚Äôt it?

DemonLord: Thankfully I had a regeneration quirk. And she apologized. I think I fell in love at that moment. To (almost) kill me with such a simple quirk honed to such a perfect level of ability‚Ä¶ that was the most beautiful thing I ever saw. Until our eyes met.

Izuku: dad pls

DemonLord: Let your dad embarrass you occasionally, it‚Äôs not like I have a lot of occasions for that. And it‚Äôs part of being a father, yes? 

Izuku: being a boomer*

DemonLord: Do not cite the deep magic to me, son.

DemonLord: I was there when it was written. 

DemonLord: Well, almost, I was born in 2020. 

DemonLord: It was, objectively speaking, the worst thing that happened to the world that year, though it took a while for people to realize that. 

Izuku: What? Wait, did you just used some antique meme on me, dad

DemonLord: Speaking about quirks, what‚Äôs the one that this kid has? 

Izuku: Ah yes, ignore me

Izuku: Why am I not surprised with you asking about that

Izuku: also is my mom crying

DemonLord: She almost stopped crying about the adoption bit, then she started crying about the eyes (and heart) bit. I can hear her from here. Give her a moment. Now, quirk. 

Izuku: lol

Izuku: wait for it

DemonLord: ‚Ä¶?

Izuku: it‚Äôs a C L A S S   S I X quirk

DemonLord: ‚Ä¶!

Izuku: He named it Total Command. Two-step activation (touch +vocal command).

Izuku: He can freely alter the ‚Äôstate‚Äô of whoever he touches. 

Izuku: He killed PURITY with his first activation because she got touchy with him when she captured us (very briefly, mom don‚Äôt cry) and he shouted at her to ‚Äòdrop dead‚Äô so his quirk turned her state to that of being dead

DemonLord: Purity dead because she got touchy with a captive

DemonLord: THIS IS FUNNY TO ME

DemonLord: I told her that would be her end at some point, people like her just refuse to listen to reason

CatThief: HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO NOT CRY AT THIS

Izuku: He also turned Mindscrew ‚Äòwell-rested‚Äô, and then proved that he can also alter emotional states (by turning Mindscrew ‚Äòhappy‚Äô and ‚Äòsad‚Äô), although those are very fleeting. Then he said ‚Äòpoisoned‚Äô and Hitoshi started to feel really bad until he used another command to undo that state. 

CatThief: Izuku, baby, please do not use your friends as test subjects

Izuku: sorry but I got really excited

Izuku: I also had him turn me ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô after I scratched myself, and the wound disappeared, but I suspect that larger changes like that will tire him out a lot. 

DemonLord: If it DIDN‚ÄôT tire him out, that quirk would be beyond Class-Six.

DemonLord: So emotional states (easy but temporary)

DemonLord: ‚Äòlesser‚Äô biological states (such as well-rested or poisoned, which doesn‚Äôt necessitates changes of your body structure, just of hormones, energy levels and so on, semi-permanent in that ‚Äòwell-rested‚Äô lasts until you stay awake for too long)

DemonLord: and then ‚Äògreater‚Äô biological states (so those that require major changes to your body, such as healing wounds or ending life, ironically the latter might be a lesser state if it just stops the heartbeat)

DemonLord: what about states without basis in biology? Have him touch you and say ‚Äòweightless‚Äô

CatThief: just don‚Äôt float out of the window or something, please

Izuku: IT WORKS

Izuku: IT WORKS 

DemonLord: THIS IS PHENOMENAL

Izuku: I KNOW

CatThief: Sigh, you two are unbelievable

DemonLord: This is a quirk to equal Rewind!

Izuku: wait I just had an idea, two actually

DemonLord: ???

Izuku: OKAY TURNS OUT THAT ‚ÄòQUIRK-RESISTANT‚Äô IS A STATE TOO

Izuku: So his quirk can alter the functionalities of other quirks, probably explains the Class-Six status.

DemonLord: Are you serious?!

Izuku: Yeah, he used it on Hitoshi and it turned out that I can‚Äôt even attempt to steal his quirk for a while, though like most more complicated states I think that there is a time limit to that (will probably grow with training). And it probably won‚Äôt do a lot to for example physical strengthening quirk users punching you.

Izuku: Plus I think that there is a limit to one altered state per person at any given moment. Second one overrides the first one. 

Izuku: makes you wonder about the reaction to ‚Äòquirkless‚Äô state or smth like that, it would probably suppress activation of quirks until another state would overwrite it

Izuku: test number two

Izuku: OH MY GOD THE VERBAL COMPONENT WORKS THROUGH A PHONE

Izuku: Just touch someone and you can kill him or make him float or whatever else through a phone call

Izuku: This is brilliant

DemonLord: WHY WASN‚ÄôT HE AROUND WHEN I RULED THE UNDERWORLD

DemonLord: I COULD KILL ALL MIGHT BY SENDING HIM TO A HANDSHAKE EVENT WITH YAGI TOSHINORI AND THEN PHONING HIM

DemonLord: DAMN IT

Izuku: I‚Äôm like 99% sure that One for All has some sort of increased resistance towards quirks like that, you know?

DemonLord: let your old man have his dreams please

DemonLord: And, of course, if he is as similar to you as you claim, I‚Äôm entirely supportive of the adoption!

CatThief: ‚ÄúEri will be overjoyed to have another family member and her happiness is my happiness‚Äù in Japanese. 

Izuku: I know, mom.

DemonLord: Please don‚Äôt put it like that.

CatThief: You want me to lie? 

DemonLord: Well, no

CatThief: Then stop.

DemonLord: Yes, Inko. 

Izuku: Alright gtg, have fun being the head of the house [I‚Äôll bring Asa to meet you tomorrow]

DemonLord: Was that about me?

CatThief: There should be a limit to fantasies, Hisashi

An hour later Tenko and Suto Shimura left their room. Tenko only suffered some minor scratches. His reflex and speed were phenomenal and long ago approached superhuman status - he couldn‚Äôt dodge a bullet but he could certainly make sure that no one had time to target him. 

Suto had a nasty slash wound that was already patched, and was deeply shaken. 

Izuku was shaken by what she told him as well. 

 

***

SmallMight: Sorry for interrupting our little talk about the events of the battle

SmallMight: I was just visited by young Shimuras

SmallMight: I know what happened. And I demand explanations.

TinTinCan: Ugh. I‚Äôm trying to find some myself.

SmallMight: You are supposed to be a hero. 

SmallMight: You recognized Suto as a member of the League when she said that her name is Suto Shimura

SmallMight: I understand that I told it to you in secrecy (more like, told it to Nana)

SmallMight: but WHY DID YOU LET HER GO

SmallMight: YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO TRY TO APPREHEND HER.

SmallMight: SHE IS A VILLAIN DAMMIT

SmallMight: smalltime but still

TinTinCan: I DON‚ÄôT KNOW WHY I DID IT 

TinTinCan: Shit. 

TinTinCan: I know I should have arrested her

TinTinCan: sure I initially thought that she was a victim of CRC that escaped during your attack

TinTinCan: She was cut nastily AND, well, the acid splashes

TinTinCan: it was weird that she was right next to the battlefield (where we attacked the convoy that you were pushing towards us)

TinTinCan: I tried to calm her and asked her for her name, she answered

TinTinCan: Then PUFF and my brain stopped working

TinTinCan: I told her to leave because there is battle going on and she lept away from me

TinTinCan: ugh

SmallMight: If you are going to get too influenced by me, STOP

SmallMight: It‚Äôs bad enough that I got influenced by YOU

TinTinCan: What?

SmallMight: Who do you think gave me the idea to become the Symbol of Evil?

TinTinCan: WHAT?

SmallMight: I heard your analysis of me being a hero with villainous methods [Nedzu office was wiretapped back then, remember?]

SmallMight: until then I was just circling around, not sure what my end goal actually is

SmallMight: I talked about demolishing Japan in a controlled way as the only fix to it at this point and shit

SmallMight: I had a will to act, but no long-term idea of how to achieve that

SmallMight: Stain apparently considered killing me after the meeting due to that, but decided to stick around to see what will sprout from this mess

SmallMight: I wanted to achieve it all, but was like YUCK MY FATHER AND HIS LEGACY

SmallMight: then I heard you saying the hero with villainous means stuff

SmallMight: and everything clicked in

SmallMight: I decided that I want to be a hero-villain like that, but if I‚Äôm going to, I should go with full dedication and will rather than accept half-assed measures

SmallMight: So I decided to accept said legacy as a mean towards my goal

SmallMight: I needed to have a serious talk with Stain to finally voice what my actual opinion was (even before myself)

SmallMight: If you need a kick from me to get to the point like I got a kick from you, then I‚Äôm all for it

SmallMight: So get your ass to Sir Nighteye, have a SERIOUS talk about what you ACTUALLY want with all of that

SmallMight: You are supposed to be a HERO dammit. Figure out what that words mean to yourself just as I figured out what the word VILLAIN means to myself

SmallMight: our talks and playing video games are on hold until you write to me in a way that will make me believe that you know where you are standing

TinTinCan: Alright. 

SmallMight: One last thing before that, though: the enemy strategist?

TinTinCan: A lot of cultists blew themselves up to slow us down. We believe that he and at least three other CRC ‚Äòbishops‚Äô (stupid designation tbh) fled. What about your source in the CRC?

SmallMight: She is in the base rn. I‚Äôll ask her in a second and send you a summary, it‚Äôs been a‚Ä¶ busy day. 

SmallMight: Also Asa Naoki is now officially Asa Midoriya. 

TinTinCan: just give your surname to everyone in the League already

SmallMight: just talk to Sir Nighteye already

TinTinCan: ugh

Mr. Principal: I‚Äôd like to congratulate everyone involved in our recent operation against the Creature Rejection Clan! According to the current reports, we have killed or arrested no less than three thousand three hundred twenty active members of the CRC. The organization is down by about 80% of members, and has lost their bases, their money, their equipment and their leader.

AngryRabbit: Fucking awesome!

KillerWhale: Yes

TinTin: Yes! 

ICastFist: Acceptable. Unlike the nicknames.

Mr. Principal: What‚Äôs more, we suffered almost no casualties (there are some wounded, but as a whole, they will be able to return to active service). 

CatsCoffeeNap: Get used to it, Knuckleduster. It‚Äôs Nedzu‚Äôs idea of humour.

Mr. Principal: Simply speaking this is a phenomenal achievement. 

DeadpanStalker: Could get a worse nickname, vigilante.

ICastFist: ‚Ä¶ 

Ms. Eraserhead: WHY IS MY NICKNAME LIKE THIS [also WTF I love your nicknames Knuckle & Sir]

SuperPunch: ...because you keep proposing to him?

Ms. Eraserhead: But he keeps saying no! ;_; 

ICastFist: And that‚Äôs where the joke is in, I guess. 

Ms. Eraserhead: you understand humour?!

ICastFIst: no but I can find it

ICastFist: I need to find things to be able to punch them

FashionablyLate: hmph

Rasengan: ...about the nicknames thing, I have some things to say. And they aren‚Äôt positive.

SUPERCOOL: THEY ARE SUPER COOL

DeadpanStalker: CAN WE PLEASE RETURN TO THE SUBJECT

DeadpanStalker: If there is one

DeadpanStalker: anyone has anything to add about the operation?
TinTin: I might have something to add

TinTin: Few things in fact.

AngryRabbit: Oh? 

TinTin: It‚Äôs what Legion told me, to reiterate:

TinTin: CRC had a commanding officer that at the very plays in the same league as Nedzu, Sir Nighteye and Legion

TinTin: He actually managed to almost take down the League of Villains, despite total surprise of the attack

TinTin: Willing to lose lots of people if it means getting the job done/gather intel for another attack (used like 30 of his people to draw in the League before blowing them all up remotely)

TinTin: Legion caught him off-guard by having additional warp user (and then decimated half of CRC forces), but then the mysterious commander pulled a general retreat and had the League‚Äôs forces pursue him only for 60+ clanners to attack Legion‚Äôs command post under some detection-suppressing quirk‚Ä¶ and then Purity and her praetorian guard warped through an unregistered warp quirk right on top of them while they were repelling the first attack

Mr. Principal: Oh dear, that‚Äôs unexpected. 

DeadpanStalker: What‚Äôs wrong with this country nowadays, you can‚Äôt throw a rock without hitting a warp quirk user, impossibly competent scientist and a genius strategist (and all three will be villains).

AngryRabbit: it‚Äôs called ‚Äòfew decades of governmental fucking neglect‚Äô and it‚Äôs curable, at least in theory. but the therapy tends to be painful. 

ICastFist: Yes

CatsCoffeeNap: How did they manage to recover from that attack?

TinTin: apparently by complete accident

TinTin: They captured Legion and everyone else present in the command center, only for Asa Naoki to suddenly late-bloom and one-hit-kill Purity with his quirk. 

DeadpanStalker: what

TinTin: I know nothing about the quirk in question or what happened to Rabbit afterwards, however. 

Mr. Principal: Oh dear

TinTin: Save for the fact that Asa Naoki is now Asa Midoriya, as he apparently agreed to be adopted by Mischief. 

Mr. Principal: Somewhere out there, there is a world where Midoriya Izuku gathered all those wonderful, brilliant and dangerous young people together‚Ä¶ and then, before committing his first public murder, asked me to open the villain/vigilante rehabilitation class for them.

Mr. Principal: I‚Äôm an extremely happy rat/bear/mouse/principal in that world. 

CatsCoffeeNap: And I‚Äôm an extremely unhappy teacher because knowing you I‚Äôd have to help in their rehabilitation program WITHOUT bonus pay.

Mr. Principal: Teaching isn‚Äôt a job! It‚Äôs a CALLING!

CatsCoffeeNap: Do you want me to CALL the journalists and talk with them about your approach to your workforce

Mr. Principal: no need to get so confrontative, Eraserhead! 

TinTin: Can I continue, please?

Mr. Principal: But of course!

TinTin: Legion confirms the death of both the CRC warper (he wasn‚Äôt a strong one, needed more than ten minutes of recharging after bringing Purity‚Äôs strike force, and it wasn‚Äôt a far warp) and the detection-suppressor. 

TinTin: Villain names of Long Step and Silence. 

TinTin: Another of the Purity‚Äôs close lieutenant (Incense) is missing due to being the League‚Äôs spy and being evacuated from the battlefield. Class-Three healing quirk, and a reasonably qualified doctor. 

TinTin: Based on her knowledge, the strategist I mentioned is Mastermind. Seventeen years old, apparently Purity‚Äôs son that she planned to make into her successor. Class-Four or Five intelligence quirk, late-bloomer as well. Purity kept him largely isolated until recently, and Incense doesn‚Äôt know much. Real name and surname unknown. 

Mr. Principal: Potential Class-Five Intelligence quirk?! That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ extremely worrying. 

DeadpanStalker: To say the least.

Mr. Principal: I hope that Izuku recruits him for UA in that another world I mentioned. 

DeadpanStalker: Please stop daydreaming. 

TinTin: If he didn‚Äôt die anonymously somewhere, he retreated with the remnants of the CRC to join the Paranormal Liberation Front (how they will work along ISP is anyone‚Äôs guess). Together with A-Rank villains, Pain (melee fighter with ability to amplify pain felt by people he comes into physical contact with) and Infection (can infect others with a fast acting and debilitating disease with symptoms resembling pneumonia, that vanishes when she leaves the range). 

TinTin: Until Mastermind is ‚Äòready‚Äô, Infection is supposed to be in charge of the CRC remnants. 

Mr. Principal: I will contact the Hero Commission and request Mastermind to be ranked as a supervillain. 

Mr. Principal: If Midoriya Izuku taught us something, it‚Äôs the fact that if you let people like that grow, you are going to regret it IMMENSELY.

SuperPunch: The only thing you regret about Midoriya is not offering him to join UA under false name before he massacred that first CRC base. 

Mr. Principal: That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not entirely incorrect.

FashionablyLate: ‚Ä¶

Rasengan: ‚Ä¶

ICastFist: ‚Ä¶

Mr. Eraserhead: ‚Ä¶

DeadpanStalker: ‚Ä¶ 

TinTin: That would actually be kinda cool.

DeadpanStalker: Mirio no

TinTin: Mirio yes

SUPERCOOL: THIS IDEA IS ACTUALLY KINDA COOL AND I AGREE WITH YOU TINTIN

SUPERCOOL: I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE LEGION ON OUR SIDE JUST SLIGHTLY MORE OFFICIALLY

SUPERCOOL: IT APPEARS TO BE SAFER

Mr. Principal: Someone finally understands me! 

AngryRabbit: this conversation is a fucked up burning mess and I‚Äôm having other things to do

TinTin: same

TinTin: @DeadpanStalker I have something important to talk about, some private issue, can I drop by your agency now?

DeadpanStalker: Of course!
Notes:

    1. Rabbit's quirk was designed BEFORE Star and Stripe showed up in canon. Yes, I know it's a bit similar. The difference is that Total Command's limited to status condition, but on the other hand, you could technically boost a two digit number of people with some empowering statuses (think Powerful to boost your quirk and physical strength up or, if you go against people like Endeavor, Fireproof etc.). It also has a small degree of 'reality warping' included, as why it's not mentioned here (but probably will be in Answering the Call once I write it), giving someone a 'Free' status condition undoes not only mind control quirks but also physical bindings.

    2. It's not fully developed due to being awoken in a life-threatening situation, slightly ahead of schedule (as stated in the last chapter). Rabbit's quirk in other stories from that series are significantly stronger, allowing him to put his status conditions onto himself, or being permanent (although permanent until the connection last, so 24h unless touched again in that period to reset the counter, and not with some of the strongest status conditions like Imperceptible or Invincible, which still have a timer). Healthy still works best on diseases and scratches though, it's not Rewind.

    3. Ngl, Izuku and All for One geeking about the quirk together sort of warms my heart. Before I remember how many people the latter killed to obtain their cool quirks. Then it... starts being a bit questionable.

    4. Contrary to popular opinions, Total Command isn't a reference to That One Fic, because I dropped it rather quickly for a multitude of reasons. And I don't understand the hype.

Chapter Text

‚ÄúI did something‚Ä¶ during the battle.‚Äù Mirio admits. Sir Nighteye, as always, is unreadable but Lemillion has his full attention. They are in Sir‚Äôs personal office in his agency. Alone, safe for the All Might‚Äôs faces gawking at them from every wall. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what to think about this. Legion ended up calling me out on this and told me to go talk with you and figure myself out. So‚Ä¶ here I am.‚Äù His face is clouded. 

‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm here for you, Mirio.‚Äù Sir replies. He is worried, of course. He is often worried, but always supportive and Mirio will never forget that. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù 

‚ÄúDuring the CRC attack I was in a position to‚Ä¶ apprehend a member of the League of Villains.‚Äù Mirio admits. Sir stares, his face unreadable. They both know that the cooperation between League and UA is on a strategic level - there was a reason why Midoriya visited the war council in a form that made him impossible to arrest. ‚ÄúBut I let them go.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt do such a thing without a reason.‚Äù Sir says. Mirio expects scorn on his face, but there is none. Only attention. ‚ÄúSo why did you do this?‚Äù

‚ÄúDuring the‚Ä¶ recent meeting of the war council, I noticed that Nedzu was lying when he spoke about Decay.‚Äù Mirio decides to describe everything from the start. ‚ÄúI spend enough time with detective Tsukauchi to be able to read him sensibly. And he looked at Nedzu and flinched slightly.‚Äù Mirio clenches his teeth for a second. He is deeply uncomfortable. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ Legion told me earlier to not look into Decay. That finding out who he truly is would hurt many heroes that don't deserve to be hurt. I consider this my job to confirm the things he tells me about as much as possible, to look for signs of him being like his father‚Ä¶ so I confronted Nedzu about it. And he told me the truth.‚Äù Mirio sighs painfully. ‚ÄúAll things considered, this was a mistake.‚Äù 

And now he is going to have to share this with Sir. No other way for him to truly understand what happened. He can‚Äôt help Mirio if he won‚Äôt know what actually happened. At least Sir wasn‚Äôt on the list of people to be TRULY hurt by the truth. 

‚ÄúWhat did you find?‚Äù Sir asks him.

‚ÄúThat Decay‚Äôs true name is Tenko Shimura.‚Äù Something in Sir‚Äôs face shifts. ‚ÄúHe is Nana Shimura‚Äôs grandson and her only remaining blood relative. Nana‚Ä¶ heard all of that. She refuses to speak with anyone, even other heroes in the One for All since then. Nedzu didn‚Äôt know that she lives in my head. I‚Ä¶ should have asked you to confirm Legion‚Äôs words.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ was indeed unfortunate.‚Äù Sir replies. Now his face is clouded too. ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt know. All Might and, especially, Gran Torino. It would kill him.‚Äù Mirio nods. Gran Torino is a tough one, but he is exhausted by his grievous wounds and he was‚Ä¶ probably even closer to Nana than All Might. ‚ÄúWas it Decay?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Mirio shakes his head. Even knowing the truth he would try to apprehend Decay. That man was too dangerous to be left out there. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a bit more complicated. When I told Legion what happened, he freaked out. He asked me to promise him that I won‚Äôt share what he says with anyone else, to pretend that all he said was said directly to Nana. Cat‚Äôs out of the bag now, so‚Ä¶‚Äù He shrugs slightly. ‚ÄúThe crucial part was the one when he admitted that the League got some new recruits. Interns from Kurogiri‚Äôs academy, I believe. One of them was a girl, whom life messed up just as much as it did Tenko. Legion said that it was like two broken half-people discovering that if together they make for a single functional person. After years of being a deranged mass murderer, Nana‚Äôs grandson found someone he genuinely cares about. Someone he loves. Legion even said that when they are together, he sees Tenko Shimura rather than Decay for the first time in his life. And‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou ran into her.‚Äù Sir asks. Mirio nods. 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Lemillion adds. ‚ÄúA complex mutant quirk girl. 17-18 years old. Mostly human, but with some wolf features, like a tail and ears. Someone must have poured acid over her at some point, seems to have covered her face with her hand enough to protect eyes, nose and mouth, but the cheeks are‚Ä¶ rather horrible to look at. Right hand went through the same thing, and I think that chest and abdomen were scarred like that too. I thought that she was a CRC captive that escaped during the attack, but‚Ä¶‚Äù Mirio sighs. ‚ÄúLegion said that Tenko married that girl the next day after meeting her, and gave her his surname because her own carried some bad memories. I asked that wolfgirl about her name, and she said that she is Suto Shimura. So I pretended that I still think that she is an escaped captive and told her to get out of the battlefield.‚Äù 

There are a few seconds of silence in the room. Sir is considering something. He isn‚Äôt the most expressive of people, but Mirio knows him enough to read some things. Sometimes. This is one of them. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôd have let her go too.‚Äù Sir finally says. Mirio jerks his head up and stares at his mentor in disbelief. That‚Äôs the last thing he expected to hear when he came to Sir‚Äôs agency. 

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ why?!‚Äù Mirio asks. Perhaps he will discover his reason by listening to Sir Nighteye‚Äôs. 

‚ÄúFor two reasons.‚Äù Sir replies. ‚ÄúFirst, the more rational one, is the fact that Tenko Shimura is a weapon of mass destruction in certain... circumstances. Taking away his emotional crutch before he is safely incarcerated might have backfired spectacularly.‚Äù Mirio didn‚Äôt think of this. ‚ÄúLegion is keeping him on a leash, and I prefer to have him still on it than to have him go renegade. Especially if it means him going on a rampage because the heroes took his other half from him. He should be incarcerated at the same time as his wife or before her to avoid that. Especially as said wife practically lacks a criminal record, making her not a priority target.‚Äù 

This isn‚Äôt Mirio‚Äôs reason. He knows that. But he agrees with Sir‚Äôs reasoning. He didn‚Äôt think of it earlier, but this makes a lot of sense. 

‚ÄúSecond reason, the one I believe you‚Äôll agree more with, is a villain called Crucible.‚Äù Sir says and Mirio is confused. He never heard of such a villain. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an A-Rank villain, who went missing four years ago. Thug, but a quite smart one. Killed a few people during this career. Still technically wanted, though he is a cold case. I found him three years ago‚Ä¶ but you are the second person to learn about that.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt arrest him?!‚Äù Mirio stares at his mentor as if he met him for the first time. 

‚ÄúMore than that.‚Äù Sir replies. ‚ÄúI destroyed the evidence that could point towards him.‚Äù Mirio stares with his jaw dropped. ‚ÄúCrucible is a victim of discrimination. His quirk was perceived as villainous, and he ended up joining the bad crowd. He disappeared because together with three other members of his former gang he fled his hometown to the other end of Japan‚Ä¶ and set up an orphanage. Perhaps as a means of atonement, or perhaps to give children like him the things that his own childhood lacked? I cannot tell. I never talked with him, and he doesn‚Äôt know that I found him. But I did investigate the orphanage from the ground‚Äôs up and ruled out any form of foul play. I know that he genuinely cares about the kids under his care. If I acted according to the letter of law, I‚Äôd have ruined the lives of fifteen children. Quirkless, with complex mutant quirks or with quote unquote villainous quirks. Children that no one else was willing to help. So I didn‚Äôt. Crucible probably still wonders what is the source of the anonymous donations that keep his orphanage floating.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt you say that law is important?‚Äù Mirio feels that he agrees with Sir when it comes to what he did. But‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so out of character. He doesn‚Äôt know what to think about it. ‚ÄúYou pretty much went into a shouting match with Miruko over this!‚Äù 

‚ÄúI did. And yes, the law is important.‚Äù Sir says with a nod. ‚ÄúLaw is the framework of society. If everyone acted however they pleased, there would be no society left. I‚Äôm a part of generally understood law enforcement. Defending the law is my job. But I also believe that law without mercy is a tyranny. And I know that laws do not define what is good and evil. I have a conscience of my own. I assure you that if the Commission managed to ban marriages between the quirkless and the quirked tomorrow and told me to look for people breaking the law, I‚Äôd tell it to shove it and start secretly supporting the Quirkless Equality Movement. ‚ÄúMirio simply stares, his eyes open wide. ‚ÄúMy argument with Miruko had less to do with me disagreeing with the notion that conscience precedes the law at least in some cases and more with the fact that someone like her, a public figure, one of the strongest heroes and a symbol for the complex mutants out there shouldn‚Äôt speak of the law like that in the open, even in a meeting like this. We have enough people disregarding the law already, and way too many looking down on heroes.‚Äù He sighs. ‚ÄúAlthough it‚Äôs probably easy for me to say, since I‚Äôm not a victim of discrimination like she is.‚Äù

Mirio suddenly remembers Legion telling him to figure out what the word ‚Äòhero‚Äô means to him. Himself telling the people gathered in Nedzu‚Äôs office (and, apparently Legion) about Legion being a hero with villainous methods, and that being a villain for him is changing the world through using your quirk. 

What does being a hero mean for Mirio? When he said that Legion was hero with villain means, what did he mean by hero? Defeating other villains? Endeavor and Thunderbolt did this too, and he struggles to call them heroes. They may have been ones by profession, but‚Ä¶ there were heroes in this world before the profession, there were heroes in this world before the quirks. Sure, they saved people‚Ä¶ but is that all there is to heroism?

Things start to click one by one. The things that he wasn‚Äôt sure how to describe now have names. The disjointed mess of connections in his mind is untangled. The coast is clear. 

‚ÄúI think I let her go‚Ä¶‚Äù Mirio says. Sir is silent, waiting for the answer to come from Lemillion‚Äôs mouth. He probably knows it already, but also knows that it has to be said. ‚Äú...because I knew about Tenko‚Äôs past and I knew that hers was just as bad. And I believed that they both deserve a second‚Ä¶ no, probably the first chance. A chance that the law will never give them. So if I wanted to save them, I had to break it. And I care more about saving people that no one else can save than I do about the law‚Ä¶‚Äù He sighs. ‚Äú...though it is important to me, as well.‚Äù 

Tenko Shimura greatly helped in that decision by killing other murderers rather than innocent people. Trying to help him was one thing, risking the lives of civilians and heroes to do that was something else. It wasn‚Äôt even an option. Mirai, naturally, knows that. 

Sir‚Äôs faint smile that popped up after his first words grew significantly after the last addon. 

‚ÄúYes, Mirio.‚Äù He replies finally. ‚ÄúEventually we‚Äôll have to arrest them. Sure, some courts look less angrily at villains killing other villains than when civilians are involved. But murder is still murder. However, his traumatic past and clear mental issues are attenuating circumstances. Perhaps if given some time, Tenko Shimura will understand his wrongs. A person capable of proving that they want to get better will stay behind the bars much less long than a raving monster incapable of empathy, shouting at everyone that he will murder them.‚Äù Sir sighs. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs, at least, if you are willing to trust Legion‚Äôs words on this. And you are willing to risk the backlash if your decision backfires on you or some innocents.‚Äù

Lemillion is surprised by this fact. But he is willing to. Legion is hiding things from him - but that‚Äôs understandable. Mirio is hiding things from him too. But both do that by either not mentioning things at all, or by saying openly that they aren‚Äôt going to say a thing. Lying is‚Ä¶ oddly absent. 

The backlash is harder to accept. But‚Ä¶ sometimes he has to draw a line somewhere, if only to let himself sleep soundly at night. And thus far Decay‚Äôs victims are almost uniformly monsters wearing human skins. 

‚ÄúYou know, I planned to sever your contact with him.‚Äù Sir says, surprising Mirio once again. ‚ÄúBut to my surprise, he is a positive influence on you. You are asking questions that you wouldn‚Äôt have a few months ago‚Ä¶ and find the right answers for yourself. The school and I gave you the necessary skills and fostered idealism. But now you are confronting the real world. One where things are much more grayer than you used to think. And it only seems to be making you stronger.‚Äù There is a smile. One wider than Sir normally shows. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lose what you gained today, alright?‚Äù 

He isn‚Äôt planning to.

SmallMight: I kinda expected you to spend a few days mulling it over

SmallMight: rather than send me five pages long essay on your new outlook on heroism and morality in like half a day

TinTinCan: ‚Ä¶

TinTinCan: Plus Ultra?

SmallMight: oh ffs

SmallMight: but also

SmallMight: THIS IS AWESOME

TinTinCan: heh

TinTinCan: Were you afraid that I‚Äôm getting too influenced by you and my resolve for heroism is waning?

SmallMight: actually, somewhat?

SmallMight: don‚Äôt get me wrong, if there is a world where I become a hero you‚Äôre probably my favourite senpai

SmallMight: I really respect you (and I think that All Might choose super well)

SmallMight: but that‚Äôs the point - I respect you due to you being an awesome true hero

SmallMight: you no longer being an awesome true hero would be‚Ä¶ yeah

TinTinCan: Ha, fool

TinTinCan: you never saw how anime protags return from every moment of doubt thrice as decided on achieving their goal

SmallMight: YEAH SORRY FORGOT ABOUT THAT

SmallMight: so, a hero who is willing to save even the villains if he can. and is more neutral good than lawful good

SmallMight: that‚Äôs quite admirable

TinTinCan: Understanding my enemies and their motivations makes sense. AND I‚Äôm not blind to the fact that there are villains that cannot be in any way reasoned with. 

TinTinCan: Like, sorry to say it, but I can‚Äôt imagine your father going to a rehab

SmallMight: I can

TinTinCan: if your mom forced him?

SmallMight: that too

SmallMight: I kinda think that in his own way he loved us? It‚Äôs hard to summarize it all, but‚Ä¶ I mean, Midoriya Inko CHOKEHOLDED HIM into unconsciousness (in front of Kurogiri, mind you) and he didn‚Äôt take revenge on her. And he kept overreacting to me having ‚Äòissues‚Äô in school.

SmallMight: My working theory is that family started as a distraction (two centuries of ruling must take its toll on you, even if it‚Äôs your hobby) but at some point he just‚Ä¶ grew into it? Actually spent a lot of his time with us, despite waging a war against Nedzu and Sir. 

SmallMight: Sometimes I wish he just retired and stayed with us. 

SmallMight: despite the, you know, tens of thousands of people he killed or died due to his orders in the past that he should probably answer for

SmallMight: I kinda try to not think about this ehhh

TinTinCan: Alright, so

TinTinCan: Muscular?

SmallMight: fuck that guy

TinTinCan: xD 

TinTinCan: I could use the O-word, but that would be too much.

SmallMight: Yes

TinTinCan: so what are your future plans?

SmallMight: I need to introduce Asa to his new mom and sister. And boy if this isn‚Äôt going to be a hard thing to achieve without him freaking out, detonating a smoke bomb and vanishing on us. 

SmallMight: Today he listed the things he prepared in case I was planning to steal his quirk.

TinTinCan: He knew he had a quirk brewing?

SmallMight: Yeah because I planned to give him one of my minor quirks just to deal with acute anxiety and self-worth issues due to quirklessness (bought, not stolen) but turned out that he has something inside  

SmallMight: and holy shit that kid would have probably manage to escape from us all, he even pieced out a small bomb from some kitchen/bathroom supplies

SmallMight: Rabbit is scary

TinTinCan: So I heard

SmallMight: As for other plans

SmallMight: we‚Äôre officially welcoming new members of the League (interns they might be, but they are a family after the shit they pulled out during Purity‚Äôs attack on my command post)

SmallMight: And I STILL need to address what two of my ‚Äòharem members‚Äô did, but I‚Äôm waiting until they wake up, ugh

TinTinCan: tell me 

SmallMight: They were away from me when the attack started, and Gremlin went berserk. Fired up her jetpack, with Vampire latching onto her. Flew over the forest with a high speed towards me. Got right in time - Silence was about to shoot me, but they just flew past her, with Gremlin severing her in half with a sword that she was carrying AND the momentum of her crazy flight.

SmallMight: Then they crashlanded.

SmallMight: Real hard.

SmallMight: but immediately stood up and charged at the clan members closest to me

SmallMight: then passed out from exhaustion caused by their flight just as Sunset started warping reinforcements 

TinTinCan: marry Gremlin

SmallMight: ‚Ä¶ what?

TinTinCan: She is like a female Tenko that can probably build a nuclear bomb from scrap. And she has a crush on you. I prefer her happy with her life (also, as Tenko established, love redeems) instead of having more Training Camp moments.

TinTinCan: So I‚Äôm now totally supportive of her attempts to join your harem, but it‚Äôs mostly my self-preservation instinct speaking.

SmallMight: I HATE YOU

 

***

 

‚ÄúD...do you think they will like me?‚Äù Rabbit asked quietly. They were having some few last choice words before Kurogiri warps them to Izuku‚Äôs house. Rabbit is, of course, extremely nervous about the whole affair. 

They are in the living room. It changed. Tenko is still playing his videogames (rarely alone though), but has begun to spend a lot of time in the corner of the room. With Awoo. Doing something crazily precious. Right now she is sitting on his lap, working on his rather awful skin on the face. It‚Äôs part of his quirk - his skin dries easily and Tenko didn‚Äôt care about it at all. 

Now he has an Awoo to apply some cream into it, slowly and deliberately, while the man himself is busy staring intently at the girl right in front of him. He doesn‚Äôt say things, but she knows that he simply loves watching her, because he thinks that she is the most beautiful person ever. Izuku can feel Awoo‚Äôs confidence grow point by point from this. They appear unable to notice the world around them.

He sometimes wishes they stopped being SO precious, they are really making the atmosphere weird sometimes. It‚Äôs a villain lair, dammit! 

‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs start from the fact that mom already likes you.‚Äù Izuku promptly replies, ignoring Tenko and his ‚Ä¶ preciousness entirely. ‚ÄúIf anything, be worried about her spoiling you too much. My sister likes absolutely everyone, and I mean it. She knows she‚Äôll get another family member and she loves the idea. We explained to her that she shouldn‚Äôt get too‚Ä¶ touchy, and she understands that. She wasn‚Äôt used to physical contact at first. The only problem might be my father.‚Äù 

‚ÄúTh‚Ä¶ the Quirk Thief?‚Äù Yeah, Rabbit‚Äôs eyes make it obvious that he is afraid of his soon-to-be father. Izuku isn‚Äôt surprised. Not with how insecure Asa is about his quirk. 

‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt going to take your quirk.‚Äù Izuku informs his younger brother. Those two words: ‚Äòyounger brother‚Äô, are simply a wonderful combination. ‚ÄúHe stopped taking quirks at all. But he is sometimes rather‚Ä¶ intimidating. Not on purpose. A bit like Stain.‚Äù 

They both shudder at the memory of Rabbit‚Äôs first meeting with Stain. The kid actually almost got a heart attack. They didn‚Äôt see each other at the Academy, so the first meeting was rather‚Ä¶ painful and surprising. 

‚ÄúBut he knows that you are rather jumpy, so he‚Äôll give you some space.‚Äù Izuku adds. ‚ÄúBut if some of this intimidation slips out, then‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúRabbit will be brave!‚Äù Asa announces with a look of decisiveness on his face. He is looking up to Izuku, in more ways than one. Izuku feels the heavy burden of that. 

‚ÄúVery well then!‚Äù Izuku replies with a smile. ‚ÄúOnwards to an adventure!‚Äù

 

***

 

The house is big. 

Rabbit never saw houses as big as this one, save for the ones on the TV. It‚Äôs a bit scary. But then again, this means a lot of places to hide if he doesn‚Äôt feel safe, yes? He likes that. 

No one in sight. Suddenly his anxiety spikes. Rabbit forgot about something!

‚ÄúUhm‚Ä¶ Iz...Izuku?‚Äù He isn‚Äôt used to referring to Legion (SSS-RANK VILLAIN) like that. But he is his brother now! He should get used to it. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I have a q...question.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù Izuku stops and turns his head to look at Rabbit. 

‚ÄúH‚Ä¶ How am I‚Ä¶ uhm.. supposed to refer to them?‚Äù He isn‚Äôt sure if he knows. ‚ÄúM...mom and‚Ä¶ dad? I‚Äôm not s..sure yet if I feel‚Ä¶ uhm, alright with that, I mean, I‚Äôm all for it, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúAsa.‚Äù Izuku says, and Rabbit stops talking. ‚ÄúIt took us close to a year for Eri to get comfortable enough with us to start calling us her mom, dad and brother. Say whatever you feel okay with, they‚Äôll understand.‚Äù 

Rabbit understands. Or, more like, trusts Izuku. Izuku was captured by his enemy and told that he would be brought to an even worse enemy of his, but he still told Purity to leave Rabbit alone! And then got wounded due to that. He wouldn‚Äôt do that if he was pretending to be his friend! 

After that, Rabbit decided that he wants to be more like Izuku. He was smart, he was brave, he was confident, he was all that Rabbit wasn‚Äôt but wanted to be. 

Rabbit will do it!


***

 

RABBIT WON‚ÄôT DO IT!

Izuku‚Äôs father is massive and scary. He is only standing there, on the other end of the room, and Rabbit already feels like he is about to die. He is smiling, and this smile doesn‚Äôt seem scary at the glance but Rabbit is scared! Very much so!

He makes a step back, partially hiding behind Izuku. Izuku actually moves a bit, to let him hide some more. Rabbit is happy about this. 

What he doesn‚Äôt expect is Mischief appearing out of nowhere and starting to beat the scary man with a rolled newspaper. 

‚ÄúSTOP‚Äù bam ‚ÄúSCARING‚Äù bam ‚ÄúMY NEW‚Äù bam ‚ÄúCHILD‚Äù bam ‚ÄúHISASHI!‚Äù

‚ÄúStop doing that to me every time someone comes to visit us!‚Äù The Scary Man shouts back and jumps to the side, the couch partially hiding him from Mischief. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre overreacting!‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo I am not!‚Äù Mischief shouts back. Rabbit decides that he just met the second most awesome person in his life after Izuku. Toxicity and Juggernaut are awesome too, and his friends, but this is an entirely different level of awesome. He stares at her in awe. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about that, Asa‚Ä¶ or do you prefer Rabbit?‚Äù Mischief asks, while approaching him. She kneels in front of him, lowering herself to his level. 

He knows he uses the latter outside. A lot. Way too much. But‚Ä¶ this is supposed to be his family, yes? He should at least try. 

‚ÄúA...Asa is alright, M...miss Inko.‚Äù He mumbles, while looking down. If he looked up, he would have seen the motherly expression of ‚ÄòohmygodheissopreciousIneedtohughimsomuch‚Äô on her face.

 

***

 

Izuku was 99% certain that his parents staged the newspaper attack in order to make Asa feel less scared of his new dad. Too many consecutive hits. That or, which was an option as well, Inko felt her motherly protective instinct bloom into something uncontrollable and she went berserk for a second.

That was an option.

She enjoyed bloodless thievery, but it‚Äôs not like she didn‚Äôt have to beat someone from time to time. She just did it non-lethally. She was still slightly chubbier now (way less so than before Thunderbolt died), but she still knew how to beat people if needed. She just didn‚Äôt do that anymore.

(if Mischief in her prime and Rappa went into the ring, Izuku would bet for Rappa but nothing which he would be hurt by losing - and that‚Äôs if she wasn‚Äôt using her quirk, since otherwise RIP Rappa)

The last bits of Asa‚Äôs overwhelming fear and anxiety were mostly dispelled when Eri popped up, alongside Hellhound in his small form. She didn‚Äôt try to hug him (she knew that he was scared and didn‚Äôt want to scare him any more than that), but she immediately started talking. Reassuringly. And in a cute way (because there are very few things that she does that AREN‚ÄôT cute). 

Asa seems to have come to the idea that if Eri is here, then the family - and a certain part of it that was towering over the room and filling it with his presence - couldn‚Äôt be so bad. 

When Asa, Inko and Eri departed from the room (to show Asa his new room), Hisashi approached Izuku.

‚ÄúHe really is similar to you.‚Äù His dad speaks. He is confident and in one of his best suits. He looks certainly not like a person who was just smacked several times with a newspaper. Not enough for Izuku to decide that the fight was staged, still. Hisashi knew how to pretend that everything was going according to the plan even when everything around him was going to hell.

‚ÄúWhat about the DNA tests?‚Äù Izuku shots back jokingly. His father groans. 

‚ÄúI told you, no one else in my life.‚Äù Hisashi sighs. ‚ÄúI was too busy being a shadow emperor for romance. Unless Garaki decided to clone me or do something like that, Asa is certainly not my biological son.‚Äù 

Even if he did, what were the statistical chances of Izuku running into THAT very lost brother? Besides, it‚Äôs not like an interest in quirks was defined in genetics.

‚ÄúThere is a thing I need to ask you about, though.‚Äù Hisashi says. ‚ÄúThe Paranormal Liberation Front is a rising threat. I must admit that I didn‚Äôt expect Garaki to go renegade to this degree, and I have absolutely no idea how he and the Quirkless Liberation Front came together. Their ideologies couldn‚Äôt be more different.‚Äù

‚ÄúSeems to be a common theme.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúI mean, remnants of the Creature Rejection Clan and the Inhuman Supremacy Party joined it too. It‚Äôs like every sufficiently evil group out there decided to put their ideological crusades on hold and focus on overwhelming the heroes.‚Äù 

‚ÄúTrue. QLF‚Äôs attack on Hosu was the start of the avalanche.‚Äù Hisashi says. ‚ÄúEclipse proved that you can attack the heroes and win. Not just some random hero out there, but an entire city they protected. The Paranormal Liberation Front will turn upon itself the second the UA and the Hero Commission fall. But for now, it‚Äôs members will work together because they feel they can win.‚Äù 

He doesn‚Äôt add it, but his reign was different. He could win. All he had to do was to just show up in front of the National Diet, butcher everyone inside, and then start mowing down the heroes left and right. Who would stop him? One for All Holders? Until All Might (and, perhaps, Nana if she played her cards better) they were an amusing distraction rather than a threat. 

He just didn‚Äôt feel like doing it. He enjoyed being the whispered object of terror, controlling everything from the backseat. Japan and its eternal war between the heroes and villains were an entertainment to him. He had enough puppets in the government to de facto control both sides for most of the time. He ruled only one of them, but influenced the other heavily. 

Destroying the heroes fully would just mean having to deal with various underground insurgency groups, pissed off by the fact that he was now a no-longer-shadow-but-still-very-emperor figure. Instead all of his potential enemies popped up in the media, honing their quirks until they were ready to get harvested by him. 

Oddly enough, there were always more hero candidates than really dangerous villains. Like lambs to the slaughter, in the end. 

But his ‚Äòdeath‚Äô tilted the board, changing it into a mess. 

‚ÄúComing back to the thing I have to ask you for‚Ä¶‚Äù Hisashi sighs. ‚ÄúDo you think you are ready to face Gigantomachia?‚Äù 

Well, that was the last thing Izuku wanted to talk about. 
Notes:

    F_ck - and I can't stress this enough - Russia, people.

Chapter 44: Marriage (?)
Summary:

    New members of the League, more talk about Gigantomachia, maybe an accidental marriage.

Notes:

    I promised to show you the list of nicknames after the last chapter, there are some more in this one so I decided to wait for it.

Chapter Text

SmallMight: I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY

Insomniac: Oh?

SmallMight: More like three, actually

SneakyGecko: Oh?

SmallMight: Announcement Number 01:

 

[[SMALLMIGHT send invitation to the chat to Juggernaut [D-Rank]]]

[[Juggernaut [D-Rank] joins the chat with default nickname of Juggernaut]]

 

[[SMALLMIGHT send invitation to the chat to Awoo [Unranked]]]

[[Awoo [Unranked] joins the chat with default nickname of Awoo]]

 

HandyMan: Suto :) 

Awoo: Tenko :) 

SneakyGecko: TOO PRECIOUS

SmallMight: I KNOW THEY ARE PROBABLY SITTING TOGETHER WHILE WRITING THIS

 

[[SMALLMIGHT send invitation to the chat to Toxicity [E-Rank]]]

[[Toxicity [E-Rank] joins the chat with default nickname of ToxicGirl]]

 

[[SMALLMIGHT send invitation to the chat to Rabbit [D-Rank]]]

[[Rabbit [D-Rank] joins the chat with default nickname of Rabbit]]

[[SMALLMIGHT changed RABBIT‚Äôs nickname to Mini-Miruko]]

 

[[SMALLMIGHT send invitation to the chat to Incense [B-Rank]]]

[[Incense [B-Rank] joins the chat with default nickname of SavingGrace]]

 

Mini-Miruko: What

SmallMight: You are a rabbit, and you are dangerous when you get close. She is a rabbit, and she is dangerous when she gets close. 

SmallMight: Yes, I saw you admiring her merch in my room.

Mini-Miruko: oh

SneakyGecko: A boy of good taste

Mini-Miruko: please don‚Äôt eat me Mr. Spinner

SneakyGecko: WAIT I DIDN‚ÄôT MEAN IT LIKE THAT

CatProvider: -_- 

SmallMight: OH NOW YOU‚ÄôVE DONE IT GECKOMAN

SneakyGecko: SORRY SIR

ToxicGirl: uhm, hello!

Juggernaut: yes

Awoo: :D

SmallMight: Yeah so we have new members now

SmallMight: Our interns decided to accept my offer to join us 

SmallMight: I‚Äôm happy because they were super awesome during the battle

SmallMight: Also fuck this we‚Äôre going in raw

 

[[SMALLMIGHT send invitation to the chat to Mr. Compress [SS-Rank]]]

[[Mr. Compress [SS-Rank] joins the chat with default nickname of WorldIsAStage]]

 

PurgeTheFakes: Oh no. 

CatProvider: Oh no indeed.

WorldIsAStage: OH YES, is that fascinating and wonderful special hidden super fantastic chat for the active members of the League?

 

[[SMALLMIGHT changed WORLDISASTAGE‚Äôs nickname to ClownLord]]

 

ClownLord: Now that‚Äôs just uncalled for, young Midoriya!

SmallMight: I asked you about payment for Levellers participation in the battle (okay it was just you, Gentle and Twice but still)

SmallMight: you asked me to pay you in pin-ups of MY MOTHER

SmallMight: I‚Äôm being merciful with the nickname

CatProvider: ‚Ä¶ 

ClownLord: Understandable, have a nice day. 

ClownLord: On another note, did we lose anyone important except for Power Punch?

SmallMight: Nah, in the end we didn‚Äôt. At least, no one important. 

SmallMight: but it was close. And Power Punch WILL hurt us, or at least the Rappa‚Äôs little FIght Club that just joined the League as a subsidiary. Do you know how hard it is to get some REAL heavy brawlers? It‚Äôs not like I can invite Knuckleduster or Miruko to do some illegal cage-fighting.

SmallMight: NOW IT‚ÄôS TIME FOR ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER TWO

SmallMight: From now on, Asa Naoki aka Rabbit aka Mini-Miruko is my beloved adopted younger brother that I cherish greatly and you‚Äôre all supposed to be nice to him (as in, even nicer, seriously, put in some effort)

SmallMight: Also he is Asa Midoriya now.

ToxicGirl: wait so Mischief is Rabbit‚Äôs mom now?

Mini-Miruko: yes

Insomniac: oh wow boss‚Äô plan to give us all his surname has moved to another phase

ToxicGirl: that‚Äôs awesome! She cooks well and she is just sooo kind and nice to everyone

Mini-Miruko: i know

Mini-Miruko: until she has a newspaper in her hands

Mini-Miruko: then she is scary but in good way

ToxicGirl: I‚Äôm missing some context?

SmallMight: it‚Äôs a bit of a family secret

SmallMight: ClownLord might get a heart attack

ClownLord: Why?

SmallMight: Not telling you.

ClownLord: PLEASE LET ME UNPACK THIS WONDERFUL MYSTERY

SmallMight: no

ClownLord: JUST ONE SMALL TIP?

SmallMight: NO

ClownLord: ONE WORD, WE‚ÄôLL PLAY HANGMAN OVER IT!!!

SmallMight: FOR FUCK SAKE STOP IT OR YOU‚ÄôLL BE THE HANGMAN

Blueberry: Seeing boss talk like that with Mr. Compress of all people is just so surreal, he has been a supervillain for SO long, wow

SmallMight: AND STOP HAVING LEWD THOUGHTS ABOUT MY MOTHER YOU DAMN CLOWN

ClownLord: no

SmallMight: Ugh, you asked for it.

SmallMight: She is taken. 

ClownLord: Oh? That didn‚Äôt come up during the talk. By whom?

SmallMight: WELL I WONDER [just don‚Äôt get a heart attack]

ClownLord: ‚Ä¶ no.

SmallMight: yes.

ClownLord: OH FUCK NO

SmallMight: OH FUCK YES

ClownLord: I THOUGHT HE IS DEAD

SmallMight: HE ISN‚ÄôT BUT YOU MIGHT BE IF CATPROVIDER TELLS HIM ABOUT THE PIN-UPS

ClownLord: @CatProvider THIS WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING OH FUCK 

ToxicGirl: uhm?

Insomniac: @ToxicGirl Legion has a dad that‚Äôs so scary that Hero Commission didn‚Äôt add him in the supervillain list because they preferred to pretend that he doesn‚Äôt exist, and now Mr. Compress found out that he was lusting after his wife

Insomniac: he thought that said dad was dead

Insomniac: and so Mr. Compress is having a panic attack

Insomniac: also it‚Äôs a League‚Äôs secret, dear interns, so no telling anyone on the outside or we‚Äôll all die

CatProvider: How so?

ClownLord: NOT ERO PIN-UPS, THE NICE ONES, BECAUSE SHE IS LITERALLY ONE OF MY TWO IDOLS AND I LOVE HER VILLAIN OUTFIT AESTHETIC

ClownLord: I WOULDN‚ÄôT LEWD HER I WAS JUST MESSING WITH LEGION

ClownLord: have mercy

ToxicGirl: do I want to ask why the SS-Rank villain has this degree of a meltdown over this?

Insomniac: The last time Legion‚Äôs dad met with All Might, said dad tore All Might‚Äôs stomach and lung out and did a villainous monologue in front of the Symbol of Peace (who was on his knees with his innards being on the wrong side of the skin). But then AM managed to sneak in United States of Smash and Legion‚Äôs dad ended up looking worse. But now said dad is back to full strength.

ToxicGirl: oh, okay that explains the meltdown

SmallMight: mercy granted, now stop with the screaming ugh

SmallMight: I wanted to announce it in different way, but yeah, cat‚Äôs out of the bag

SmallMight: my dad is the legendary quirk thief, man capable of taking and giving quirks

SmallMight: he ruled this country from the shadows for like two centuries but recently decided to retire

SmallMight: is currently too busy cuddling my little sister (whom he thinks is the most adorable person in the world) to do crimes

ClownLord: wait

ClownLord: All for One R E T I R E D? And is currently busy with family life?

SmallMight: yes

ClownLord: This is literally the least probable assortment of words within a single message I could potentially think of. 

SmallMight: I can send you a pic of my little sister using my dad as a stead. He is on all fours. 

ClownLord: what

SmallMight: this is honestly less humiliating than the one of him wearing All Might‚Äôs apron (it was a penalty from mom for cheating at Monopoly)

SmallMight: All Might choked on a cheeseburger when he saw it

ClownLord: what

SmallMight: and the newspaper thing that Mini-Miruko mentioned is because he scared him so Inko started beating him with a rolled newspaper until he hid behind the couch

ClownLord: what

SmallMight: we are all alive and safe only because he is playing a family man

SmallMight: so DO THE ENTIRE JAPAN A FAVOUR AND DON‚ÄôT MAKE HIM UNRETIRE HIMSELF WITH SOMETHING STUPID YOU DAMN CLOWN

ClownLord: I WILL NOT DO ANYTHING STUPID, SIR

ClownLord: Just don‚Äôt mention the pin-ups to him, please 

SmallMight: No lusting after mom and no mentions of the pin-ups. Ugh 

SmallMight: this brings back to the third announcement

SmallMight: When we rest and heal, we‚Äôre going to battle Gigantomachia

ClownLord: OH FUCK NO WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS

ClownLord: I CAME HERE FOR THE LAUGHS NOT FOR THE EXISTENTIAL PAIN

ToxicGirl: Who?

Insomniac: Actually I don‚Äôt think I know details myself? It was mentioned by Legion on another chat, but he was limited in specifics. But I do know that it‚Äôs going to be a pain, due to the Compress reaction. He actually knows it. 

SmallMight: @ToxicGirl let me summarize it

SmallMight: My dad is a drama queen slash concept of overkill made flesh.

SmallMight: He wanted to make a perfect bodyguard

SmallMight: So he created a 3-30m tall (he can change his size) humanoid kaiju capable of trampling cities in its wake, almost utterly invulnerable to attacks and capable of fighting continuously for weeks without rest, food or water, with T E N quirks (number taken from the fact that it was supposed to be able to face all Top Ten heroes at once and at the very least hold the ground against them (that was before All Might popped up). 

SmallMight: tl;dr my dad‚Äôs bodyguard can destroy a small country on his own, and we are going to force him to submit

PurgeTheFakes: What the fuck?! 

Insomniac: Jesus Christ

ToxicGirl: o_o 

Mini-Miruko: I‚Äôm scared

SmallMight: @Mini-Miruko come to my room if you want a hug

Mini-Miruko: I‚Äôll be brave! 

SmallMight: :D

SmallMight: Gigantomachia is essentially my father‚Äôs ultimate weapon. A living weapon of mass destruction, capable of stomping through cities, annihilating armies of heroes in its wake. 

SmallMight: He is like a super-high end noumu (but is still intelligent, although is a bit‚Ä¶ toddlerish for most of the time?) 

SmallMight: people generally go braindead on the second quirk. Gigantomachia nomed nine and WITHOUT Garaki surgeries to make it easier on him

SmallMight: The problem is, PLF knows where Gigantomachia‚Äôs hidey-hole is. 

Insomniac: oh well that‚Äôs no good

BurnBurnBurn: that‚Äôs putting it delicately

SmallMight: Gigantomachia is fanatically loyal to my dad, but my dad is a dick and he won‚Äôt just warp there and tell Machia to follow me. Instead he wants me to earn it by popping there with my group and proving my strength to Gigantomachia. 

SmallMight: And I have to do it real fast, because if I won‚Äôt do it then Garaki will and then we‚Äôre all T O A S T

SmallMight: Machia is a weapon capable of engaging All Might at the apex of his strength in battle - it can‚Äôt win, but it can tank so many hits that it‚Äôll tire Might badly (so with some support‚Ä¶ yeah)

Insomniac: Plans for that? because I honestly can‚Äôt imagine us taking this thing down, unless you use your OP PLS NERF quirk

SmallMight: using the primary would defeat the purpose of beating Makhia 

SmallMight: and disassembly would be nice but he has a hyper-regeneration quirk - I‚Äôll tire down WAAAAY before him

SmallMight: BUT I have an idea 

SmallMight: it‚Äôs crazy BUT it will count as wonderful training for us all, especially the new interns.

SmallMight: We need to wait for a moment or two for everyone to heal back up, though. 

ToxicGirl: are we really going to be useful in all that?

SmallMight: You, my dear interns, are the only reason why this plan might work. 

SmallMight: but that‚Äôs for the future

SavingGrace: Gremlin woke up, come quickly

SmallMight: GTG BYE

 

***

 

The room they delegated to being Incense‚Äôs temporary hospital was a small one. It was also filled with smoke, and Incense‚Äôs hair was on fire. 

The most surprising thing in all of that was that it wasn‚Äôt Gremlin‚Äôs fault. 

‚ÄúThat was fast.‚Äù Incense commented when she saw him enter. She was a young woman, about the same age as Tenko, with blazing red hair. She ditched the religious paraphernalia after they evacuated her from the battlefield and was now wearing a short dress and a pair of knee-high socks. All black, for some reason. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave you two alone.‚Äù 

The fire in her hair dies out when she deactivates her quirk. It was quite cool - her hair produced an incense-like smoke that greatly sped up recovery of wounds and reduced exhaustion of everyone that inhaled it. It also regrew quite quickly from the constant burning. 

She was, technically, a non-complex mutant. And had a personal reason to detest the complex mutants. The Inhuman Supremacy Party did things that made many people hate the people it supposedly represented.

Incense left the room. Gremlin rose from the bed. 

Izuku was about to say something. Then he saw that she had tears in her eyes. And then she ran towards him. His strength-boosting quirk (he should probably get another one for moments like this) stopped him from suffering serious injuries. 

‚ÄúMei‚Ä¶‚Äù He tries to speak. He isn‚Äôt used to Hatsume Mei pretty much crying into his T-Shirt. She doesn‚Äôt give him the time to do that. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ sowwy.‚Äù She said. ‚ÄúYou got hurt because of me. Because my baby wasn‚Äôt good enough. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù She adds, slightly more clearly. Although clearly only in terms of vocalization, because Izuku immediately notices that he has no idea what‚Äôs happening. What does she even mean by this?

‚ÄúYour baby‚Ä¶ you mean your robot?‚Äù He asks, and he can feel her nod. It‚Äôs slightly uncomfortable to have her close enough to feel her nods instead of seeing them. ‚ÄúIt did its best, if anything it‚Äôs my fault for letting Purity surprise you. It‚Äôs not your fault, Me‚Ä¶‚Äù

She pushes him back. Or, more like, she takes a step back with a bit too much enthusiasm. 

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù She shouts. Her eyes are slightly unfocused. She is still conscious and sane, but something in her is‚Ä¶ wrong. Her hands waved around her temples, fingers stretched as if she considered grabbing her head but wasn‚Äôt sure about it. ‚ÄúNo, you‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ It was supposed to protect you! It failed! I failed! When I fail‚Ä¶‚Äù Tears are still streaming down her face. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt leave me! I‚Äôll make a better one! I promise!‚Äù 

Oh shit. 

Oh shit shit shit shit shit shit. 

Izuku realized that he was too lenient with his attempts to fix his friends. And that he classified Gremlin as happily and functionally (save for the EPISODES) insane, and focused on the more‚Ä¶ perturbed League members. And he has missed some very worrying things. 

He really didn‚Äôt want to think about what brought that. Re-Destro was going to die, and Izuku really started to feel like that one thing was getting personal.

‚ÄúMei.‚Äù He makes a step towards her. She looks like she is shrinking before him. He grabs her hands, and pulls her towards him a bit. But he does it delicately - he doesn‚Äôt want to aggravate anything. When she is close enough, he hugs her. Thankfully she hugs him back. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, I‚Äôm not leaving you, no matter what happens. You saved my life, Mei. You and your babies.‚Äù She is crying again, but this time it feels like it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ less painful to her? There are some happy tears mixed in. ‚ÄúYou are part of the League. Part of the family. This won‚Äôt stop simply because you didn‚Äôt work hard enough, Mei.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not like his words can mysteriously fix whatever Re-Destro broke in her. He does his best to support her, but he has a lot of work in front of him. She still calms down a bit. No, a lot. But only after a few minutes of crying into him again. 

Living with Midoriya Inko prepared him for that very moment. He is used to being cried into. 

‚ÄúSorry, I‚Ä¶‚Äù Mei finally says. She took another step back, but seems to be back to her‚Ä¶ saner state. ‚ÄúI overreacted. I thought you were dying and‚Ä¶‚Äù She sighs. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want that. I don‚Äôt want that to happen.‚Äù 

She isn‚Äôt alone in that part. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm still here. And I‚Äôm planning to stay.‚Äù He replies with a reassuring smile. ‚ÄúSo, is there something that I can do for you? You did save me, after all.‚Äù He should also figure out a gift for Himiko. They were in on that one crazy stunt. 

‚ÄúMarry me.‚Äù She replies promptly and Izuku just stares at her. 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Is all that he manages to utter. 

‚ÄúMarry me.‚Äù She says again, this time slightly more confidently. ‚ÄúBe a papa to my babies. And... ‚Äú The confidence vanishes. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be alone ever again.‚Äù She half-whispers. 

Izuku is 99% certain that marriage is something else than a mutual agreement to live together and tinker with weapons of mass destruction until heroes will be too tired of dealing with them and will all emigrate from Japan. 

Gremlin sounds like she wants to be adopted more than married. Is that what marriage is in the League of Villains? Adoption (mutual in Tenko‚Äôs case) with benefits? Ugh, he hates the term with passion. He is still going to mention it to Mirio just to see his reaction.

It‚Äôs not like he gets benefits, either. He and Himiko are SLOWLY getting used to the existence of the S-word, and are honestly just cuddling and being supportive to each other. Their marriage is an odd one. 

‚ÄúOkay, first of all, I‚Äôm already married.‚Äù Izuku replies. Gremlin tilts her head, looking at him quizzically. As if trying to figure out how that's a problem. What‚Äôs HER understanding of the word marriage to begin with?! ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm not sure if we can make decisions like that without Himiko, so...‚Äù His attempt to buy some time in order to STOP BEING SO DAMN TERRIFIED OF THAT TALK is brutally interrupted.

‚ÄúI agree!‚Äù He hears an unexpected shout. They both look towards the source of it, and‚Ä¶ of course, Himiko is no longer asleep. Still in her bed, but certainly not asleep. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, do it!‚Äù 

‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt you just stay asleep, dammit.‚Äù Izuku is slightly angry. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making this awkward.‚Äù He is happy she woke up, but‚Ä¶ he is also kinda unhappy that she did it at the worst possible timing.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only awkward because you don‚Äôt want to agree but you also don‚Äôt want to say no!‚Äù Himiko retorts. ‚ÄúMake up your mind and say yes! You made so many babies with her, take responsibility!‚Äù 

Mei perks up a bit. 

‚ÄúYes! And we‚Äôll make even more together!‚Äù She has that‚Ä¶ slightly manic look on her face. ‚ÄúSo many new babies!‚Äù 

Izuku decides that he was wrong. Himiko wasn‚Äôt making it awkward. Both of them were making it awkward. It is time to end this once and for all. 

 

***

 

SmallMight: I have a question.

TinTinCan: yes? 

SmallMight: How exactly am I supposed to tell my mom that I think I just got married again? 

TinTinCan: ‚Ä¶ 

TinTinCan: YOU ACTUALLY MARRIED GREMLIN?!

SmallMight: I DON‚ÄôT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

SmallMight: IT JUST DID

SmallMIght: omg mom is going to kill me

SmallMight: it was bad enough when I told her I was married after the fact but I think I now did it again and with a girl she didn‚Äôt even meet beforehand

SmallMight: I‚ÄôM REALLY WEAK WHEN IT COMES TO RELATIONSHIP STUFF AND THEY EXPLOITED IT AGAINST ME

SmallMight: Gremlin was just too‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶ damaged by it all? She asked me to marry because she doesn‚Äôt want to be alone ever again (right after tearfully begging me to not leave her alone because her baby failed to protect me and‚Ä¶ uhm, I think that Detnerat didn‚Äôt tolerate her babies being subpar so ugh) and I just‚Ä¶

SmallMight: I MEAN I STRUGGLED 

SmallMight: BUT THEY JUST

SmallMight: KEPT NAGGING ME

SmallMight: And then Gremlin suddenly said that she wants my surname because her parents wouldn‚Äôt want her to be a villain and she just taints the name of Hatsumes and I was like 

SmallMight: UGH

SmallMight: I DON‚ÄôT KNOW WHAT I WAS LIKE

SmallMight: SHIT

TinTinCan: I diagnose you with a terminal case of being too kind

SmallMight: what

TinTinCan: You are so kind that you literally can‚Äôt NOT help someone who was messed up by life, and you are willing to go so far as to literally MARRY THEM to make them feel better

TinTinCan: they just need to ask tearfully and if you think it will make them happier you will immediately agree

TinTinCan: I‚Äôm almost sure that your ‚Äòmarriage‚Äô is like 99% cuddling and emotional support and being an even closer family to each other

SmallMight: make it 100% 

TinTinCan: ‚Ä¶ really?

SmallMight: I DON‚ÄôT KNOW HOW TO START THAT SUPPOSED 1% DAMMIT DON‚ÄôT MAKE IT EVEN HARDER ON ME

SmallMight: Aren‚Äôt we like 6-7 months after the USJ raid? I asked Himiko what she thinks about me that evening and it was like

SmallMIght: Do you like me?‚Äù ‚Äúyes!‚Äù ‚Äúbut do you, uhm, like like me?‚Äù and of course while blushing and not being able to say love word openly because my throat gagged on it

SmallMight: IT‚ÄôS A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF PROGRESS FOR SIX MONTHS, ESPECIALLY AS IT WAS PRETTY DAMN BUSY SIX MONTHS

SmallMight: AND DON‚ÄôT HAVE ME STARTED ON THE FACT THAT HIMIKO DIDN‚ÄôT REALLY KNOW WHAT SEX IS UNTIL SUNSET EXPLAINED IT TO HER

TinTinCan: WHAT

SmallMight: SO YEAH IT‚ÄôS MORE LIKE ADOPTION WITH (POTENTIAL FUTURE) BENEFITS

TinTinCan: Your last message has proven to me that you are truly an unrepentant evil monster and you need to be stopped. I‚Äôm sure the heroes in my head agree.

SmallMight: try it and I‚Äôll ask La Brava to flood the UA systems with some choice drawings from the internet

TinTinCan: What drawings?

SmallMight: The ones with Legion x Lemillion tags

TinTinCan: ‚Ä¶ 

TinTinCan: I‚Äôm going to violently murder you for informing that such a tag exists. 

SmallMight: WELL I ALMOST VIOLENTLY MURDERED MINDSCREW FOR INFORMING ME TOO

SmallMight: mood kindred

TinTinCan: ugh

SmallMight: in the meantime, I have something to ask you about

TinTinCan: Oh?

 

***

Izuku: I have an announcement.

CatThief: Oh?

DemonLord: Another adoption?

Izuku: Yesn‚Äôt? 

Izuku: I got married.

CatThief: We know.

DemonLord: Yes

Izuku: no, like

Izuku: ...it happened again?

CatThief: What?

DemonLord: ‚Ä¶? 

Izuku: IT WAS AN ACCIDENT

Izuku: I WASN‚ÄôT GOING TO SAY YES BUT I SOMEHOW DID AND I CAN‚ÄôT TURN IT BACK

Izuku: besides I'm a villain so it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs official so‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶ doing it twice is alright? 

Izuku: is mom crying

DemonLord: Please stop asking rhetorical questions.

Izuku: And what‚Äôs your opinion? 

DemonLord: I‚Äôm currently too busy laughing about your predicament to answer. 

Izuku: Ugh

CatThief: Who is it, Izuku?

Izuku: Gremlin.

Izuku: Saved my life during the battle against Purity

Izuku: Flew over the forest with a jetpack, with a large sword in hand, and then‚Ä¶ like‚Ä¶ flew beside a CRC officer like that, severing her in half, as she was about to shoot me? And then she crashlanded, only to stand up and rush to defend me, despite her injuries (with Himiko, because she latched onto Gremlin before the flight). And after waking up she started to cry because she felt like she failed me for not, like, saving me faster? And‚Ä¶

Izuku: I mean it was hard to say no to her when she then asked me to marry her because she doesn‚Äôt want to be alone ever again

Izuku: Quirk not very cool, but she can probably build a nuke, fifty support items and at least three different weapons violating the Geneva Conventions from what you can buy at some corner electronic shop. 

Izuku: I think David Shield has now an entire lab dedicated to trying to figure out her inventions so‚Ä¶ 

DemonLord: Do not act like that, son.

DemonLord: First of all, that‚Äôs your wife, not mine. Second of all, I understand the value of good support items. I might collect quirks, but I‚Äôm not blind to the greater picture. 

CatThief: When can I meet her?

Izuku: ‚Ä¶ soon. I hope. I just got a very complicated mission and it‚Äôs super time sensitive. As in, ‚Äòif we wait too long, an apocalypse happens‚Äô.

CatThief: Apocalypse will certainly happen if I don‚Äôt get to meet your new wife soon. 

Izuku: I‚ÄôLL DO MY BEST TO FIT THIS INTO SCHEDULE MOM

Izuku: Also can we start a proper family chat, me and Asa are going to be away from home for a  W H I L E soon

DemonLord: excellent idea!
Notes:

    Izuku is doing his best but his social skills when girls are involved are still his dump stat. Is that even a harem at this point? Was Gremlin 'married' or adopted? No idea, but it'll certainly involve a lot of cuddling. Blueberry actually lampshades that question in a chapter or two.

    Also having a semi-qualified doctor (however small of a role she'll be playing) makes sense, even with Izuku having Overhaul's quirk. Trust me. Time will, once again, tell.

    And yes, I boosted Gigantomachia by three quirks. Simply because I could.

Chapter 45: Gigantomachia
Summary:

    Plans for Gigantomachia are made. Tenko is hit by yet another character development mallet. Hisashi admits what's his secret evil masterplan to his wife.

Notes:

    I'M GETTING A BIT DESPERATE BECAUSE THAT FIC DOESN'T GET ENOUGH LOVE

    https://archiveofourown.org/works/36271333/chapters/94006657 --> Dead on Arrival. Very good fic that actually ends up being a rather convoluted, alternative AU distant prequel to TTB and CtE, that's going to answer some rather interesting questions (such as how One for All/All for One actually started and where is Nedzu taking all the money from). Seriously, give it a read. I'm kind of sad ass about it because the premise I picked (Dawn of Quirks but with canon characters) seems to be... uhm... less popular than the CtE, despite me thinking that I wrote it much better. Oh, the sadness.

    https://archiveofourown.org/works/36245944/chapters/94005706 --> Ties that Bind. Another fantastic fic of mine, that's actually doing pretty well (about 50% of the activity of CtE despite less chapters), but I'm still looking for more :V

    Dead on Arrival even got a meme from a reader yesterday. Now all I need is a fanart and a TV Tropes page and my fanfic career will be completed lol XD

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

The entirety of the League (including Mr. Compress, believe it or not, although it could as well be one of Twice‚Äôs clones) showed up for the talk. It was, after all, a major strategy talk. 

Izuku described everything he knew about the Gigantomachia. There were pictures. There was a recording (they had to be ready to see how Machia actually acts, just to not be startled). There was a dissection of the list of its quirks. 

They didn‚Äôt like it. 

Then it was time to tell them what his plan for it was. 

‚ÄúIn short, it won‚Äôt just listen to me, even if I claim that I‚Äôm my father‚Äôs son.‚Äù Izuku announces. ‚ÄúSo the only way of making it submit is to prove our strength. And to do that, we need to‚Ä¶ well, defeat it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúEasier said than done.‚Äù Spinner comments. ‚ÄúI mean, c‚Äômon! Just figure out a nasty plan to have All Might soften it up for us and there. Done.‚Äù

‚ÄúMachia will only accept us if WE beat it down.‚Äù Izuku replies. He is standing in front of the crowd, painfully conscious of a heavily-anxious Rabbit trying to stand next to it but kinda not knowing how to deal with it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually going to do my best to keep the heroes from interfering. But I DO have a plan. Just be aware that this is going to be the hardest, most arduous battle you were ever a part of. We are going to separate into three main groups. First one is Compress, Sunset, Kurogiri, Spinner, Vantablack and Gremlin. I regret to inform you that you will NOT participate in this battle.‚Äù 

Compress is (probably) relieved behind his mask. Sunset and Gremlin are shocked. Kurogiri is unreadable. Vantablack is curious and Spinner is surprised. 

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶‚Äù Sunset tries to speak, but Izuku interrupts her. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to be out of contact with the world for WEEKS, Blueberry.‚Äù She understands at this point, but he decides to drive the nail home. ‚ÄúThere is absolutely no point in taking down Machia if we let our subsidiary group collapse on us in the meantime. Levellers, QEM, Villain Academy, Villain Industries and the Exchange need to continue working AND expanding in the meantime. I‚Äôm going to leave you with a few special assignments for that time. Especially to the Exchange and the Villain Industries.‚Äù

Gremlin perks up. She smells the chance for new babies. She isn‚Äôt wrong. 

‚ÄúWhat about me?‚Äù Spinner asks. He is clearly the odd one in the first group. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to get a VERY special assignment.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúDepending on the outcome of one of the Gremlin‚Äôs little jobs, you might end up being transferred to the Exchange.‚Äù Spinner‚Äôs face clouds a bit. ‚ÄúWait until you learn what I‚Äôm talking about before making that face. Did I ever fail you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI still remember that Monopoly tournament.‚Äù Spinner retorts and Izuku wants to jump out of the window. IT WAS JUST ONE TIME THAT HE MESSED UP, ugh. ‚ÄúAlright, fine. But it better be good.‚Äù

It is. Oh it very much is. 

‚ÄúThe second group is me, Rabbit, Incense, and‚Ä¶ well, Kurogiri and Gremlin are probably going to work part-time in it.‚Äù Izuku continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the exact combat group, more like support slash temps. Me, Incense and Rabbit are going to set up a field hospital. Rabbit will be healing exhaustion, Incense will be dealing with general wounds, and I‚Äôll be using my quirk to repair heavy wounds and, if the worst happens, resurrect you. Kurogiri will be part-timing as our emergency ambulance and someone to deliver food and water to the base. He‚Äôll be also bringing new babies from Gremlin to do some field-testing of them in combat situations, if she‚Äôll build something new.‚Äù 

Gremlin is, naturally, beaming. Rabbit seems to be reassured that he won‚Äôt have to face Machia while being able to use his quirk lots (he loves doing it). Kurogiri is still unreadable, but this time he has Incense in the same camp. 

‚ÄúFinally, the combat group. Juggernaut and Stain as our main tanks to soak up the damage. Mindscrew using his quirk to at least temporarily slow Machia down, preferably alongside Stain. Toxicity, Dabi and Tenko dealing damage. Vampire shifting between bodies to fool the giant about whom he is actually facing. Awoo using her enhanced senses to make sure that Machia doesn‚Äôt sneak up on us with one of his burrowing attacks. I‚Äôll be joining you frequently as field medic slash commander slash damage dealer. Be aware‚Ä¶‚Äù Izuku stares at them. ‚Äú... this is going to be a long battle. You‚Äôre going to spend WEEKS fighting. I literally mean it. Almost no breaks during that time, unless you screw up, die and need to spend a moment in the hospital to start thinking again. We‚Äôll figure out how to let you eat and drink from time to time, but trust me - this is going to be HARSH. Anyone wants to bail out?‚Äù

No one did. His second family was a great one.

‚ÄúWell then.‚Äù Izuku smiles. You better start packing things up. We‚Äôre departing tomorrow. Gremlin?‚Äù Mei‚Äôs eyes instantly get locked on to him. ‚ÄúWe have something to do before that.‚Äù

 

(***)

 

TinTin: I have an announcement. 

Mr. Principal: Let me guess - League?

TinTin: Yes.

DeadpanStalker: We‚Äôre listening then. 

TinTin: Majority of the League has to temporarily‚Ä¶ withdraw from the day-to-day operations for a certain special assignment. 

Mr. Principal: Temporarily?

TinTin: Legion estimates 30 to 60 days.

Ms. Eraserhead: That might mean the entire war against the Front tbh

ICastFist: Optimist. 

CatsCoffeeNap: Or pessimist. 

Mr. Principal: Did they explain the reason for this?

TinTin: Legion is pursuing some old superweapon of All for One in hopes of capturing it before Overhaul does, because if PLF gets it first then we can all just lie down, cry and then quickly book tickets to United States (while hoping that Overhaul doesn‚Äôt follow us there). 

TinTin: The weapon‚Äôs name is Gigantomachia. 

DeadpanStalker: Gigantomachia actually exists?! 

ICastFist: Explanations? 

AngryRabbit: ^

DeadpanStalker: During the All for One reign we heard about the existence of some undefined being under this name. It was supposedly AlO‚Äôs ultimate weapon slash bodyguard. I honestly believed it to be an intimidating lie, especially as it didn‚Äôt show up during the clash against All Might. 

TinTin: Legion says that it exists. My opinion is that All for One didn‚Äôt treat All Might as a serious threat (you remember the bit with you sneaking in the United States of Smash while he was gloating over your broken body?), and then was taken down without being given time to summon his trump card. 

ICastFist: Do we know what exactly it is? And do we want Legion to obtain it? Shouldn‚Äôt we try to take it down ourselves?

Mr. Principal: I‚Äôm interested in obtaining answers to the first two questions myself. And to the third to a degree as  well.

DeadpanStalker: Same. 

TinTin: Apparently a former follower of AlO of such an unquestioning loyalty to him and powerful body that he survived receiving NINE quirks (without Garaki‚Äôs noumification process) without going braindead (although it is‚Ä¶ supposedly‚Ä¶ a bit mentally disabled?). 

Mr. Principal: Oh dear.

ICastFist: A lot depends on the quirks in question. 

DeadpanStalker: True. 

TinTin: I have a list, actually. Legion sent it as a sign of good will, while adding that his idea for Gigantomachia is to have him acknowledge Legion as his master (like All for One) and then have Kurogiri warp it to his home and tell him he is supposed to guard it. Thus removing him from the equation of the war entirely (Gigantomachia WILL engage every hero he sees unless explicitly told otherwise by his master, so it‚Äôs hard to use him in any sort of cooperative missions).

DeadpanStalker: So Gigantomachia out of the picture while Legion‚Äôs sister (the key element of Overhaul‚Äôs plans for the quirk erasure gas) is even better protected. 

AngryRabbit: How sure are we that he won‚Äôt use it against us after all?

TinTin: He is thus far doing his best to limit collateral damage. Gigantomachia is a definition of collateral damage. 

DeadpanStalker: I see. I assume the collateral damage is due to its quirks?

TinTin: Yes. It has, as I said, ten quirks. 

TinTin: 1. Endurance. It allows Gigantomachia to convert his morale into physical strength and stamina, while recharging  his other quirks. So for as long as his will isn‚Äôt broken, he is extremely hard to take down. It‚Äôs also supposedly his original quirk. 

ICastFist: Sounds like a pain to deal with. 

AngryRabbit: Depends. If you take him down instantly, this is useless.

TinTin: 2. Pain Blocker: He is unable to feel pain, regardless of the severity of the injuries. Which has a ‚Äònice synergy effect‚Äô with the first quirk - it has the mind of an enthusiastic child, and without pain, it‚Äôs EXTREMELY hard to lower its morale. 

TinTin: 3. Gigantification: The more angry or agitated in general he is, the larger he grows. His maximum height approaches thirty meters. It‚Äôs one part of what I said about collateral damages. 

LieDetector: Well, damn. That‚Äôs a pain.

SuperPunch: True. Normally gigantification is ‚Äòdealable‚Äô with, because it‚Äôs just a proportional strength growth. If there are other quirks to make you way stronger than that‚Ä¶ ugh. 

TinTin: 4. Dog. It seems to be a variant of mutant quirks, granting Gigantomachia exceptional sense of smell to aid him in tracking targets from afar while also allowing him to detect incoming enemies (it makes him EXTREMELY hard to surprise, as other senses are improved as well). 

Mr. Principal: There goes my initial idea of how to deal with it if we have to. 

TinTin: 5. Energy Saver. It allows Gigantomachia to operate on minimal amounts of sleep, food and water. By ‚Äòminimal‚Äô I mean two-three hours of sleep a month, and a similar amount of food and water. 

DeadpanStalker: Perfect for a bodyguard. 

TinTin: 6. Fierce Gains. Muscle-hardening quirk, apparently enough for Gigantomachia to be able to tank artillery rounds. Legion thinks that save for All Might (and, perhaps, me) there are no heroes strong enough to cause physical damage to it, unless they hit where it hurts (eyes for example) or attack with for example heat etc. 

Mr. Principal: Oh dear. 

ICastFist: Well, shit. 

TinTin: 7. Mole. It can grow mole-like claws from his fingers, spines on his back, and a visor to shield his face, to help him dig through the earth. It can hide underground easily and burrow under you for a sneak attack. 

TinTin: 8. Hyper-Regeneration. Even if you somehow blow off his arm, it will regrow promptly. It has limits, but‚Ä¶ well, refer to quirk number one. Enough damage in short succession WILL kill it, but‚Ä¶ well, refer to quirk number six.

CatsCoffeeNap: this investigation is a nightmare and I can‚Äôt wake up from it

LieDetector: Yes

TinTin: 9. Charge: Amplification of physical force when it runs. Essentially every twenty meters of movement in some direction doubles the resulting physical force of the next attack (be it a punch or a full body slam). Stacks up to two times.

TinTin: 10. Ruin: When it reaches a certain level of mass (so when it grows big enough), the non-organic physical objects stop offering him any resistance. Essentially imagine a twenty-meters monster that can simply walk through a skyscraper without even noticing it is there (and probably while sleepwalking or smth) while leaving a hole in its shape in it, and you get how this quirk works. 

FashionablyLate: I can‚Äôt believe that I‚Äôm saying this, but‚Ä¶ I agree with Legion.

Mr. Principal: On?

FashionablyLate: If we let PLF capture Gigantomachia, we can as well start evacuating the country. 

FashionablyLate: Taking this‚Ä¶ thing down would require amassing such a military force that we would be left vulnerable practically everywhere else. And we probably can‚Äôt amass enough of it if Garaki sends a hundred noumus to fight alongside it, unless All Might and Nedzu call in their international contacts. And even that might not be enough if QLF, ISP and CRC remnants will be there too.

Mr. Principal: My opinion exactly. 

TinTin: Its only weakness is that it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ well, dumb. It can think for itself, but only barely. If its ‚Äòhandlers‚Äô are eliminated, it can be easily confused and can easily fall for illusions (although probably not offensive mental quirks - Gigantomachia had enough willpower to survive what would break 99,999% people out there, this didn‚Äôt vanish entirely after the process was done). 

TinTin: It‚Äôs apparently been hiding in some forest since All for One‚Äôs death, because there was nobody left to tell it to leave it. But Legion knows that Doctor Garaki knows where it is, so he is planning to make it submit before PLF shows up. 

TinTin: But making Gigantomachia accept Legion as his new master will take anywhere between 30 and 60 days. 

TinTin: I have an approximate location of Gigantomachia‚Äôs ‚ÄòHidey-Hole‚Äô (in Niigata Mountains), but Legion urges heroes to keep away from it (if they show up, League will have to go after them with lethal means or Gigantomachia will decide that they are heroes too) while making sure that PLF won‚Äôt try to sneak around for the duration of the battle. 

Mr. Principal: It might be a good idea to play along. While doing some investigation on our own when it comes to this giant. With enough data we should probably admit that it exists to the Commission‚Ä¶ it should have some time to prepare in case something went wrong. 

DeadpanStalker: I agree. 

 

(***)

 

Izuku was planning to depart (with Himiko AND Mei) to his home, when he received the most unlikely visitor. Namely, Tenko. Alone. Tenko going anywhere alone was an unheard of thing since he met Suto. Izuku caught himself treating them like a single entity in two bodies. 

Tenko had a look of confusion on his face. And looked just slightly hurt by something. He practically stormed into Izuku‚Äôs office, with an emotional tsunami of emotions on his face. Another unexpected thing.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ Izuku?‚Äù He asks, in a slightly‚Ä¶ confused way. It‚Äôs as if he is half-surprised by him being there. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I think I made a mistake.‚Äù 

He didn‚Äôt dust Awoo accidentally, right? Izuku can fix that if it happened during the last fifteen minutes, but it will make Tenko‚Äôs marriage extremely awkward. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll try to help, but you‚Äôll have to tell me what happened.‚Äù Izuku isn‚Äôt sure if he is fit to counsel relationships of others, but he‚Äôll at least do his best. Making Tenko talk about it with Lemillion would be the height of uncomfortableness. 

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ talked with Awoo.‚Äù He starts. He is standing there awkwardly in front of Izuku‚Äôs desk, still clearly lost. ‚ÄúIt was about the last battle. I mentioned how many clanners I dusted, since I know that they are killing and wounding people like Suto. I expected her to be happy, but‚Ä¶ she wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù He looks terrified now. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ think I hurt her. But I don‚Äôt know why. I don‚Äôt want to hurt her!‚Äù

Oh great. Suto Shimura is now officially the second most favourite interns to Izuku. Although it depends on the results of this talk. 

‚ÄúI think she simply doesn‚Äôt like the idea of people being killed.‚Äù Izuku replies. Tenko stares at him quizzically. ‚ÄúThere are people like that. Majority of them, in fact.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBut why?!‚Äù Tenko is still shocked by the concept. ‚ÄúThey hurt her! And if not her, then others like her! Why not kill them for that?!‚Äù 

The honest reply from Izuku would be ‚Äòhonestly, I think they should be killed or at last permanently discouraged otherwise‚Äô, but his adopted older brother doesn‚Äôt need this degree of honesty. He needs something that will make him grow as a person. 

‚ÄúSome people simply don‚Äôt want people to be killed.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúIf my brief interactions with Suto are any indication, she knows what it means to be in pain. And is uncomfortable with knowing and seeing that others suffer. Because she understands what they feel when that happens.‚Äù In Izuku‚Äôs honest opinion, Awoo shouldn‚Äôt be a villain to begin with. But she had nowhere else to go. Besides, she can act as a tracker and do some non-lethal takedowns. 

For a few seconds, Izuku thinks that he failed. Tenko‚Äôs emotionally shutting down. He knows the signs. But somehow, through a miracle that he didn‚Äôt think was possible‚Ä¶ Tenko doesn‚Äôt do that in the end. He is still thinking, trying to unpack what he just heard. Trying to understand. To sort out himself. 

‚ÄúIs that why we‚Äôve been trying to avoid killing people save for those whom you told us to kill? Tenko asks eventually. ‚ÄúLike Thunderbolt, Eclipse or Endeavor.‚Äù Izuku nods. ‚ÄúWhat about the Purge? The ISP camp? The Training Camp and when we took down Purity?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre villains, Tenko.‚Äù Izuku replies calmly. ‚ÄúWe are good ones. We are trying to make this world a better one. Our methods are‚Ä¶ not very nice, but they seem to be working. The people we killed were people who killed indiscriminately. We are trying to be better than them, to stop them from doing really bad things. While trying to do our best to avoid doing the really bad things ourselves while doing so, hence being spare with killings.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the‚Ä¶ really bad thing?‚Äù Tenko asks. Izuku prays quietly that he won‚Äôt make it worse. But if he wants to get anywhere, he needs to risk things somewhere. Is there a quirk out there that allows you to foresee others‚Äô reaction to your words? Izuku would love to have it.

‚ÄúKilling someone else‚Äôs Awoo.‚Äù Izuku replies, and Tenko freezes. ‚ÄúInstead of killing people who do that to others for a living.‚Äù 

Despite knowing him for so many years, Izuku has no idea what is happening in his adopted older brother‚Äôs head. His entire experience was thrown out of the window when Awoo killed Decay and brought Tenko Shimura back to light. 

He gives him time. Minutes. This isn‚Äôt Decay‚Äôs emotional shutdown, but an honest internal debate. Tenko is TRYING to understand what he just heard and what his feelings about this are. This is more than Izuku can say about Decay during his entire life. 

Eventually the conclusion is made. 

‚ÄúCan I‚Ä¶‚Äù Tenko looks down. ‚Äú... not kill people anymore?‚Äù 

Evil mastermind‚Äôs goals clash with the good of his adopted brother. It‚Äôs not even a fight. 

 

(***)

 

SmallMight: I think it‚Äôs working, by the way.

TinTinCan: What is? 

SmallMight: Your decision to let Suto go in order to - maybe - save Tenko from himself.

TinTinCan: What happened? 

SmallMight: He noticed that she seemed to feel‚Ä¶ hurt when he mentioned how many clanners he killed. So, in his confusion, he came to me. 

SmallMight: He left my office with a vow to not kill people ever again, unless this is the only chance to save his family members (I assume that he means at least me and Suto, maybe the rest of the League). 

SmallMight: Because he might be killing someone else‚Äôs Suto. And he can‚Äôt stand the idea.

SmallMight: I think Tenko just began to learn what empathy is. 

TinTinCan: ‚Ä¶

TinTinCan: Wow.

TinTinCan: Like, seriously, wow. 

TinTinCan: Love can treat sociopathy/psychopathy like that?

SmallMight: I came to believe (after this talk) that he was never a sociopath/psychopath. 

SmallMight: Life messed him up, to the point where life and others lost all value to him. There was just him, a self-centered man-child with a power to murder people with a touch. Too hurt to even consider trying to leave his little hole.

SmallMight: Nobody was there to explain to him what we consider to be common-sense. 

SmallMight: But then he genuinely bonded with someone. First with me (which was enough to make him at least sorta functional, although it was mostly me letting him play games in peace), then with Suto. 

SmallMight: He had those moments when he, like‚Ä¶ emotionally shuts down. We were joking that it‚Äôs because he can only feel a single emotion at once and anything more than that crashes his system.

SmallMight: I think we were quite close - less the number of emotions and more the fact that he had no idea how to deal with them, and probably wasn‚Äôt sure how half of them worked (or even how to name them). 

SmallMight: So when he was overwhelmed, he just‚Ä¶ ignored them all? Until they went away? And probably treated everything as a form of a game to compensate/replace the entire worldview that didn‚Äôt make sense to him?

SmallMight: He spent half of our talk in something close to this state, but somehow he stuck to the subject and kept trying to unpack what‚Äôs this all about. Probably because it was about Suto. 

SmallMight: I knew that love redeems and all that but holy shit I didn‚Äôt think it could be THAT strong of a change

TinTinCan: So you just lost your mass-destruction weapon because you managed to teach it that killing people is evil?

SmallMight: Well it‚Äôs an odd way of putting it especially as a hero is telling that to a villain

TinTinCan: yes, a bit odd

TinTinCan: Then again, you are very odd

SmallMight: WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR KIND WORDS

SmallMight: and sorry but it‚Äôs my family member we‚Äôre talking about

SmallMight: I let Mustard go because he wanted to. And I‚Äôm willing to let Tenko go if he wants to. 

SmallMight: I‚Äôm trying to help them

SmallMight: So this is a low price to pay to make Tenko into a working human being (or at least a step closer to it)

SmallMight: [don‚Äôt expect him to turn himself in unless you publicly guarantee that he‚Äôll be sharing a cell with Suto, though]

SmallMight: Maybe he‚Äôll consider therapy if his other half asks him to go with her? I should try that after Gigantomachia, yes.

TinTinCan: you are, without a doubt, the weirdest villain I ever heard about 

SmallMight: but you did hear about me

TinTinCan: Is this some sort of reference I‚Äôm too modern to understand

SmallMight: yesn‚Äôt

 

(***)

 

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you sent your son and his friends against Gigantomachia.‚Äù Inko is angry at him. Moderately. So no physical violence, and still some time to straighten this out. He has all the arguments he needs for this. 

His son (that he is INCREDIBLY proud of) will depart tomorrow morning. For now, he and his friends (and a younger brother) are sleeping soundly. Said friends are, well, wives. Technically. Hisashi is almost certain that this isn‚Äôt the correct term for what they have going on between themselves, but he isn‚Äôt one to lecture others on common-sense. 

He has less of it than that adorable engine of chaos and madness that Gremlin is. He feels a kindred soul in her. She is himself but from a different world, one where quirks didn‚Äôt manifest and instead Mankind embraced advanced technology. 

He and Inko are in their bed. Hisashi would have wanted to sleep, but Inko is, as always, chatty when evening comes. And he knows that he is on the verge of sleeping on the couch, considering the state she is in. 

‚ÄúAll part of my plan.‚Äù Hisashi honestly replies. ‚ÄúFor once it‚Äôs not my sadism that makes Gigantomachia beat people.‚Äù Probably the wrong wording, considering the look on Inko‚Äôs face. Ugh. 

‚ÄúExplain the plan, then.‚Äù She asks and he decides that he might as well do that. Chances of Gremlin deploying surveillance in their home so quickly are fairly low. 

‚ÄúPLF is an actual threat at this point.‚Äù Hisashi admits. Who would have thought that he missed such a brilliant young man as Kai Chisaki and his wonderful, wonderful quirk? His alliance with Garaki, Imaginer‚Äôs band of murderers and now the remnants of the CRC and the entire ISP was an unexpected development, too. Hisashi is patient and calm, and this chaotic era is too‚Ä¶ chaotic for him. ‚ÄúLeague needs to get stronger.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBy recruiting Gigantomachia?‚Äù Inko asks. They met already. Machia absolutely adored her as ‚ÄúLord‚Äôs Wife‚Äù, and she seemed to like him in a way too.  Hisashi never inquired about it‚Ä¶ and then he discovered that when she was young, she had a brother, one mentally challenged. He didn‚Äôt live for long, but if she saw something of him in Machia, then it explained everything. Especially her patience and how caring she was towards him. 

‚ÄúNo. By having them fight it.‚Äù Hisashi replies promptly. She looks at him questioningly. ‚ÄúInko, during the UA training camp, heroes had their little child soldiers train extreme quirk usage for three days. I just organized League identical training‚Ä¶ for at least thirty days. And in a stressful combat situation. Alongside our son who can heal all injuries if he moves quickly, including death itself.‚Äù She seems to understand, but he decides to explain it further. ‚ÄúThey are already powerful. In both their quirk factors and the experience with their quirks, mostly thanks to Izuku‚Äôs guidance. Guidance further improved by his understanding of Overhaul‚Äôs theories about quirks‚Ä¶ and his pharmacology. I wonder if Izuku told anyone why Kurogiri isn‚Äôt letting anyone into the kitchen without his supervision?‚Äù He chuckles. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be surprised if any of them will NOT re-awaken their quirks at least once during this battle.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about Gigantomachia.‚Äù Inko replies, looking positively in awe. She has moments like that, moments that actually make him feel proud of what he did. Of something other than a new quirk in his collection. 

‚ÄúOf course not!‚Äù Hisashi laughs. ‚ÄúHeroes can‚Äôt get him to serve them. And if Overhaul and Garaki tried to recruit it, I‚Äôd show up before Machia when they wouldn‚Äôt be looking and tell him to leave them.‚Äù Destroying the country would make it significantly harder for Eri to realize her dream of becoming a recovery hero, and Hisashi can‚Äôt have that happen, right? Besides, recovery heroes are more doctors than heroes, so he can tolerate them. ‚ÄúIzuku told Doctor Garaki that I‚Äôm alive, and the very chance that it is true will scare him away from Gigantomachia. And the chance of them obtaining it was enough for Izuku to have the heroes keep away as well. The League will emerge from this battle strengthened tenfold‚Ä¶ with heroes and the PLF assisting them in that. And all I had to do was to give Izuku a little push, and don‚Äôt mention my willingness to rein in Gigantomachia if he got recruited by the PLF.‚Äù

Judging from the look Inko now has on her face (he feels content with his life when she looks at him like that - every great man should have someone who looks at them like that), this is going to be a longer evening. Hisashi is really looking forward to this.

 

(***)

 

 ‚ÄúAs expected.‚Äù Overhaul announces over the comms. ‚ÄúThey went after Gigantomachia.‚Äù 

This entity is of no use to him. He can‚Äôt use it for his research, nor for anything else. So many diseases in a single body. He feels pity for the giant, pity dulled by the fact that the giant asked to be infected. It could be useful as a weapon, but how many other weapons would they have to throw away to obtain it? 

Useless as an asset. But not useless as a distraction. 

‚ÄúIf they suppress it, it will be a problem.‚Äù Doctor replies through the screen. ‚ÄúGigantomachia is a superweapon capable of holding ground against armies.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou still don‚Äôt understand Izuku, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù Overhauls sighs painfully through his mask. To think that his co-worker supposedly spent MORE time with Legion than he did. ‚ÄúHe detests the deaths of innocent people. All we need is to put a few around us, and Gigantomachia, uuuugh, will never be sent against us. Because Izuku Midoriya will not be able to avoid collateral damage. But this will lower the combat and espionage capabilities of our opponents for the time being.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre buying time.‚Äù Doctor finally figured it out. Overhaul was increasingly tired of the little man. He was his intellectual equal, but his flaws were‚Ä¶ notable. 

He was useful, though. If he didn‚Äôt have Wolfram recover the data from the I-Island, Overhaul would have nothing to work with. His memory of his own research was‚Ä¶ painfully incomplete. Like all others. He knew things in general, but details‚Ä¶ those were awfully absent from his mind. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre buying time.‚Äù Overhaul corrected him and coughed a bit. ‚ÄúWe have the Beast‚Äôs bunch of rioters and rapists. We have Infection and her CRC remnants, together with Mastermind‚Äô tactical genius. We have thousands of QLF soldiers, with more coming in from overseas every day. We have, uuuugh, your first and second gen noumus. And now our enemies weakened themselves by dividing their forces to, uuugh, capture a weapon they won‚Äôt use. And soon‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll have enough Third Gen Noumus and the Purified to defeat them all. Even All Might.‚Äù And All for One, if he is truly alive, but he doesn‚Äôt add it. Not in his current company. 

The future looks bright. He will cure the world. 
Notes:

    Yes, I boosted Gigantomachia. What about it? However trying to accurately describe the weeks-long battle would be a pain in the ass, so expect a timeskip between this and the next chapter.

    Oh, did I mention that the next chapter might just include another plot earthquake? Is anyone still remembering the part where Lemillion asked Legion to investigate Miruko for him? Hmmm? Well, you'll find out in a week.

Chapter 46: Return
Summary:

    The League returns from its battle against Gigantomachia. A question gets answered.

Notes:

    YES I KNOW THAT IT'S THURSDAY EVENING BUT I HAVE A MORNING SHIFT TOMORROW SO I'M POSTING IT SLIGHTLY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE BECAUSE I WANT TO SLEEP LONG AND NICELY. Don't hate me for that.

    Also I'm like 90% sure that there is at least a part of the world where it's Friday now, soo...

List of Major Villainous Organizations

 

Threat Rank: SSS

Paranormal Liberation Front: Revolutionary group from the merger of the Quirkless Liberation Front with a number of other factions, including a previously unknown scientific genius Doctor Garaki and his menagerie of noumus. Its stated goal is overthrowing the hero society - and the society as a whole - in order to ‚Äòliberate‚Äô what‚Äôs considered abnormal by it. Suffered heavy casualties during the several large-scale raids by the heroes during the last two months.

 

Meta-Liberation Army: Revolutionary group led by Re-Destro, who preaches the ideals of freeing the society from the restrictions on the quirk usage, allowing anyone to use them at their convenience. Quirk-supremacists, preaching that the strength of your quirk dictates your value and importance to the society at large. Its state as a de facto regular army of the Free Republic of Japan (on Hokkaido) equals large numbers and possibility of open military exercises. 

 

League of Villains: Part-criminal syndicate part-revolutionary group. According to its manifest, it seeks a world where heroes and villains unworthy of their names are gone. Majority of its powers lie in numerous subsidiary groups, especially the smaller ones (while many high profile groups joined the PLF, the overwhelming majority of smaller villain organizations joined the League). 

 

Threat Rank: SS

Levellers : A troupe of ‚Äònoble thieves‚Äô, claiming to be led by a direct descendant of the Peerless Thief. Staged dozens of high-profile heists against companies indicted of malfeasance and heroes that its members found unheroic. Actual numbers unknown. Currently allied with the League of Villains. 

 

Creature Rejection Clan : An anti-complex quirk terrorist organization, responsible for numerous riots, pogroms and assassinations of complex quirk rights activists. Suffered heavy casualties during a hero raid (and League of Villains‚Äô attack). Pending reclassification to Rank S organization. Currently allied with the Paranormal Liberation Front.

 

Inhuman Supremacy Party : A pro-complex quirk terrorist organization, responsible for numerous riots, massacres and other attacks. Despite years of fighting against each other with extreme ferocity, it has recently joined the PLF alongside the Creature Rejection Clan. 

 

Villain Industries : An underground corporation producing weapons, tools and support equipment for villains throughout the country. Emerged relatively recently, however its logo is now a symbol of highest quality (and becomes more and more common-place). Currently allied with the League of Villains.

 

Threat Rank: S

Quirkless Equality Movement : Quirkless terror group that has replaced the Quirkless Liberation Front following its merger into the Paranormal Liberation Front. Expanded rapidly, and is steadily becoming more and more active (with steadily rising number of terror attacks attributed to it). Currently allied with the League of Villains.

 

Exchange: Independent information brokership and espionage organization, which also acts as an intermediary for numerous other illegal deals. Responsible for numerous cases of industrial espionage, hacking attempts and no less than seventeen assassinations during the past two months alone. Currently allied with the League of Villains.

 

House of Red : Organization of serial killers and wanna-be mass murderers, whose members typically possess powerful quirks and a taste in blood. Its existence was an urban legend for decades, but its existence was confirmed only recently. Currently allied with the Paranormal Liberation Front.

Midoriya Izuku wanted to die. 

 

Or, to be honest, he really wanted to go home and cuddle Eri and Asa to half-death (and then do the same with Mei and Himiko). But also to die. Because the past fifty-four days were an absolute, absolute horror. Constant warfare, almost constant existence on the verge of quirk exhaustion. No videogames. Very limited contact with the outside world. If not for Kurogiri still bringing back food and some scarce bits of news, Legion wouldn‚Äôt even be sure if his organization still exists! 

 

They engaged that loathsome giant in combat for days and days and days and‚Ä¶ it just refused to drop dead. 

 

Fifty-four days since some of the League members slept for the last time. If not for Asa keeping them well-rested, they would drop dead more than a month ago. It was just‚Ä¶ a horror. True one.

 

But, eventually, they succeeded. Gigantomachia decided that they are worthy of him and was warped to the Midoriyas‚Äô residence. Where it probably flooded the entire region with tears after discovering that not only the Lord‚Äôs Wife but also the Lord himself were waiting for him. 

 

They all warped to the base. They mostly went to sleep immediately. Asa rendered them well-rested and all that, but on some deep, psychological level they really needed to just‚Ä¶ go sleep. Stay unconscious for a while. 

 

Mei and Himiko off-loaded themselves into his bed, of course. Wearing matching All Might pajamas. Matching with his own, too. It was weird. They fell asleep almost immediately and somehow Mei was yet to squash him with an unconscious hug. He was still entangled too much to leave the bed (not like he planned to). 

 

He decided to quickly open up his phone.

 

***

 

SmallMight: I LIVED BITCH

TinTinCan: You‚Äôre back?! 

SmallMight: YES AND OH GOD I WANT TO RETIRE

SmallMight: 54 days of non-stop, 24/7 combat

SmallMight: THE LAST TIME I SLEPT WAS 36 DAYS AGO

TinTinCan: what

SmallMight: we brought someone who can restore your stamina and lift mental exhaustion

SmallMight: but still

SmallMight: I want to die so much

TinTinCan: oof

TinTinCan: What about Gigantomachia?

SmallMight: He‚Äôs probably flooding my home with tears after discovering that my mom (‚Äòthe Lord‚Äôs Wife‚Äô and the second most favourite person of Gigantomachia) is alive.

SmallMight: That or he is outside, acclimating to the role of the world‚Äôs ugliest garden gnome

SmallMight: And I‚Äôm almost certain that Eri is already befriending him

SmallMight: It‚Äôs safely out of the war, you can tell that to Nedzu and the rest of your gang

SmallMight: I need to sleep for real now

SmallMight: I have SO MANY THINGS TO CATCH-UP ON tomorrow

 

***

 

TinTin: Legion is back.

DeadpanStalker: Oh?

Mr. Principal: His presence is welcome. 

CatsCoffeeNap: I hate myself for this, but‚Ä¶ yes. 

Mr. Principal: Those two months were way too bloody, eh? We seem to be winning, but this is a war of attrition and I hate those. 

DeadpanStalker: What about Gigantomachia?
TinTin: Subjugated, evacuated to Legion‚Äôs home, getting acquainted with his family and ready to perform the role of ‚Äòworld‚Äôs ugliest garden gnome‚Äô. 

TinTin: His words, not mine. 

TinTin: Legion‚Äôs currently asleep, should show up tomorrow after he catches up. 

 

***

 

The next day started‚Ä¶ emotionally. They had a lot of things to catch-up on. 54 days without seeing Blueberry and Vantablack! Without seeing Spinner! And vice versa, of course. There was some drinking, there was some merry-making, and general chaos. 

 

And then Izuku had time for a very serious talk. 

 

Izuku: You planned for this?

DemonLord: Whatever you are trying to accuse me of, I‚Äôm innocent.

Izuku: What about you setting us up on Gigantomachia to force our quirks to evolve and our combat strength to increase

DemonLord: Oh, looks like I‚Äôm caught red handed. 

Izuku: Ghr

DemonLord: So how many quirk reawakening did you get

DemonLord: I spent 54 days imagining those. And probably making some bets with your mom.

Izuku: SHE WAS IN ON THIS?!

DemonLord: What parent doesn‚Äôt want their children to grow?
Izuku: WHAT PARENT SENDS THEIR CHILDREN AGAINST A 30 METERS TALL KAIJU TO MAKE THEM GROW

DemonLord: We do?

Izuku: I    H A T E

DemonLord: Cultivate it well!

Izuku: Okay so I‚Äôll admit, it worked swimmingly

DemonLord: Y E S

DemonLord: Details? 

Izuku: No. 

DemonLord: Cruelty befits you as my son.

Izuku: You‚Äôve been successful at persuading me to share the details.

DemonLord: Ouch.

Izuku: Decay (awakening once, Class Change 4-5)

Izuku: Vampire (awakening once, Class Change 4-5)

Izuku: Mindscrew (awakening once, Class Change 3-4)

Izuku: Stain (awakening once, Class Change 3-4)

Izuku: Toxicity (awakening once, Class Change 4-5)

Izuku: Juggernaut (awakening once, Class Change 4-5)

Izuku: Dabi (awakening once, Class Change 4-5)

Izuku: Awoo (no awakenings because complex mutant, but she got massively stronger and faster)

Izuku: Spinner and Gremlin made some MASSIVE progress when it comes to their own stuff, and honestly Spinner‚Äôs kinda scary now

Izuku: also

Izuku: I CAN NOW USE THREE QUIRKS AT ONCE

DemonLord: THIS IS PHENOMENAL

Izuku: I KNOW

DemonLord: DETAILS PLEASE

Izuku: N O 

DemonLord: I‚Äôve taught you well

Izuku: Stop making this awkward

Izuku: Okay, so

Izuku: Decay first learned how to exclude certain things from decaying (he doesn‚Äôt need to carry his gloves anymore), and can for example decay only a specific part (like, engine from a car) if he focuses enough, but I think it‚Äôs just him actually putting some back into control rather than an awakening

Izuku: then he saw Gigantomachia punching Awoo out and went homicidal to the point where he almost DECAYED MAKHIA into dust while simultaneously decaying absolutely everything in the vicinity, it‚Äôs an aura of decay that seems to be controllable of reaching dozens of meters in diameter and can still decay only specific things. Though it only spreads through surfaces (so it can‚Äôt attack flying targets and so on).

DemonLord: Oh that‚Äôs a really a dangerous thing

Izuku: yes

Izuku: Himiko got one of the craziest awakening I could imagine

Izuku: She can now USE QUIRKS OF PEOPLE SHE CHANGES INTO

DemonLord: So she can experience potentially dozens of quirks during her lifetime? Oh she fits into this family so well! Also it‚Äôs wonderful.

Izuku: yes

Izuku: Mindscrew went slightly crazy after failing to restrain Gigantomakhia with his quirk for many times and can now connect to others who responded to him and take them over even if hours or days passed since they responded to him, though there is a limit to how many latent connections he can maintain at the same time

DemonLord: Now that‚Äôs a powerful and useful ability, alright

Izuku: Would be stronger if we managed to achieve it from the start. We could easily conceal the mechanism of his quirk by having him pretend that something else is a trigger. Welp.

Izuku: Stain just awoke an ability similar to late Power Punch in that drinking blood of people not only paralyzes THEM but also empowers HIM (makes him stronger and faster, and by a lot). The stronger people he paralyzes, the bigger the boost. 

Izuku: Toxicity probably got the weirdest awakening ever

DemonLord: Who is that?

Izuku: Kurogiri‚Äôs intern. Her entire body is poisonous. Breath, skin contact and bites all cause different forms of poisoning.

Izuku: WELL NOW HER WORDS ARE LITERALLY POISONOUS TOO

DemonLord: What?

Izuku: Hearing her voice makes people feel as if they were drugged - disorientation, emotional shifts, confusion, balance problems, irrational behaviour etc.

Izuku: Gremlin installed voice changer (AND VOICE AMPLIFIER BECAUSE OF COURSE WHY NOT) into her mask so she can speak normally with it, but still, wow. 

Izuku: We are going to experiment if certain tones/words do not cause certain symptoms later on

Izuku: Juggernaut looks like a little Gigantomachia (the giant was actually somewhat confused at it himself), and has a quirk that negates reaction to his movements (he can punch a boulder for days without wounds, but once totalled a truck by making a step towards it before the impact, since his quirk read it as a reaction to his movements

Izuku: Well now his body stores the absorbed kinetic strength and can use it to boost his own movements (mostly punches, thus far)

Izuku: And Dabi learned how to empower fire that isn‚Äôt his in the vicinity. He can turn it blue, make it hotter and control (but only to some degree). 

DemonLord: This is even more than I expected, Izuku!

DemonLord: You keep outdoing my expectations, you know it?‚Äù 

Izuku: So, who won the bets?

DemonLord: I did, of course.

Izuku: Riiiiight.

 

***

 

‚ÄúSo, how did your transfer to the Exchange go?‚Äù Izuku asks. Spinner‚Äôs face is unusually clouded and for a while Izuku worries that he messed up somewhere along. 

 

They are both in his office on the top floor of the base. Spinner is wearing his standard T-shirt and long trousers, both looking like they went through hell a few times at least. 

 

‚ÄúQuite well, all things considered.‚Äù Spinner replies and Izuku is reassured. ‚ÄúYou and Gremlin have given me quite an interesting thing to play with. I give you that, you were right. And I think I enjoy working with Vantablack.‚Äù

 

When Spinner discovered a while ago that his quirk was less gecko and more general lizard, Izuku immediately had a brilliant idea. They managed to figure out how to make Spinner‚Äôs skin have slight chameleonic properties. Then Gremlin figured out how to share this with his clothes. 

 

And then Izuku has offered him the Notice-Me-Not quirk, after running some tests and discovering enough of free quirk factor. Add that to Spinner‚Äôs ability to scale vertical walls, and you get a horrifically dangerous spy slash assassin. Someone who could practically vanish from sight everywhere he wanted. 

 

Spinner was the pride of the Exchange‚Äôs small hired killers department, according to what he heard from Vantablack. He killed four people during the Gigantomachia battle - each of them reasonably dangerous (two were B-Ranks, one was an A-Rank villain, and the last remaining person was some lower ranked hero). All of them had a history of hate crimes. Especially against the complex mutants. 

 

Mixing business with a pleasure like that had to be enjoyable. 

 

‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm alright with the transfer.‚Äù Spinner concludes. ‚ÄúAlthough don‚Äôt hesitate to call me for something big from time to time. And I‚Äôm still going to hang out with the Vanguard and the rest of the League when not working.‚Äù

 

‚ÄúIt would be a sad and empty League without you.‚Äù Izuku replies and Spinner smiles. Many other crews would ignore such words from their leader, but Izuku has the comfort of his followers knowing that he genuinely likes them. That they were truly his family. ‚ÄúWhat about the special assignment?‚Äù 

 

Oh. So that‚Äôs why his face was so clouded earlier.

 

***

SmallMight: I‚ÄôD LIKE TO ANNOUNCE

SmallMight: that I figured out what you asked me to find out about Miruko

SmallMight: and you were right

SmallMight: oh boy you were right

TinTinCan: Damn it.

SmallMight: How quickly can you get Nedzu, Sir, All Might, Tsukauchi and Eraserhead to join us here? Because I don‚Äôt think you can invite me to your secret convo without risking Gremlin stealing all your secrets.

TinTinCan: Fifteen minutes. I‚Äôll just tell them honestly that it‚Äôs a crisis. 

SmallMight: Alright. I‚Äôll give you an invitation link to this chat room. 

 

[[Sleepy Head [Unranked] joins the chat with default nickname of NapNeeded]]

 

SmallMight: ERASERHEAD IS HERE FIRST?!

SmallMight: wow I didn‚Äôt see that coming

NapNeeded: problem child

NapNeeded: what is it this time

SmallMight: nothing good

NapNeeded: I see

SmallMight: also I KNEW THAT WAS YOU

NapNeeded: ?

SmallMight: I saw you on some Villain Net forum, telling some gangsters that their plan was illogical and asking to meet with you

SmallMight: I just knew that was you

NapNeeded: sigh

 

[[American Dream [Unranked] joins the chat with default nickname of AllRight]]

 

AllRight: I feel deeply uncomfortable with using Villain Network, Mirio.

TinTinCan: Sorry but it‚Äôs important

SmallMight: OMG IT‚ÄôS ALL MIGHT

AllRight: ‚Ä¶ Legion?

SmallMight: YES

SmallMight: I‚ÄôM SUPER HONOURED TO HAVE YOU HERE, SIR ALL MIGHT

SmallMight: please can you sign something with dedication to Vampire, she‚Äôs your second greatest fan in the League and I need a present for her

AllRight: I‚Äôll think about this, delivery might be problematic.

AllRight: Also‚Ä¶ are you using this nickname when talking with League members?

SmallMight: And other villains too!

AllRight: ‚Ä¶

TinTinCan: it‚Äôs best to get used to this

 

[[Foresight [Unranked] joins the chat with default nickname of SpyingEye]]

 

SpyingEye: Hello.

SmallMight: Sir Nighteye!

SpyingEye: ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm 90% sure that you are Legion. 

TinTinCan: Is Mirio the remaining 10%?

SpyingEye: So it‚Äôs Legion. Nice to know where you moved your talks after Nedzu found out, Mirio. 

TinTinCan: Doing my best to always be one step ahead of him!

SmallMight: PLUS ULTRA!

TinTinCan: PLUS ULTRA!

AllRight: I‚Äôm slightly worried.

SpyingEye: I have an eye on the situation.

TinTinCan: HAHAHAHAHA

 

[[Interrogator [Unranked] joins the chat with default nickname of LieDetector]]

 

LieDetector: So‚Ä¶ what is it about?

NapNeeded: We‚Äôre waiting for Nedzu to find out.

 

[[Szczurzy Kr√≥l [SSS-Rank] joins the chat with default nickname of Principal]]

 

Principal: Am I a mouse? Am I a bear? Well I‚Äôm certainly a principal!

NapNeeded: I‚Äôm not even going to ask about your villain rank.

NapNeeded: I just don‚Äôt want to know. I‚Äôm not paid enough to care.

LieDetector: ‚Ä¶ same. Except for paying. 

SpyingEye: I think I‚Äôm interested in knowing. 

Principal: I‚Äôm just a perfectionist when it comes to gathering intel under secret identities! 

SmallMight: lol, let‚Äôs just move on then

SmallMight: Everyone is present there! So we can open the emergency crisis management chat. 

SmallMight: A while ago (around the time you had that first war council meeting that I wasn‚Äôt told about)

SmallMight: Mirio asked me to investigate one of the Council members for him

SpyingEye: what?

TinTinCan: wait for it, please

SmallMight: mostly because it would be an awkward thing if they discovered that Sir or Nedzu are doing this (and I‚Äôm a villain so it‚Äôs not like anyone expects me to behave)

SmallMight: The Exchange finished their investigation a few days ago. Mirio‚Äôs worries were spot on. 

Principal: Do we have a spy in the Council?

SmallMight: Arguably worse than that. By an order of magnitude. Several probably. 

LieDetector: oh great

NapNeeded: urgh, what is it

SmallMight: I‚Äôm going to say the probably least likely sentence to ever be spoken in Japanese

SmallMight: Miruko and Knuckleduster are preparing a coup d‚Äôetat. 

Principal: Oh dear

SpyingEye: THEY DO WHAT

AllRight: is this a joke?

TinTinCan: Yeah, just what I was afraid of. Awesome. 

TinTinCan: Way too buddy-buddy with each other (but not too openly), and Miruko is way too angry about everything. Not to mention they are both leading deeply secretive organizations hating the Hero Commission. 

SpyingEye: Wait, I‚Äôm still trying to process what I just heard. I know Miruko is angry permanently, but a COUP?!

SmallMight: I‚Äôll be frank with you

SmallMight: Everyone seriously downplays the level of anger within the Table of Rejects. 

SmallMight: by their standards, Miruko is a MODERATE. She is apparently a voice of reason among the Table leaders. 

AllRight: Oh my God.

NapNeeded: ^

SmallMight: I had Spinner investigate them. He actually wrote a university thesis on ‚Äòhow to spot a coup brewing‚Äô, probably because he was already interested in coups and so on due to being a complex mutant. All signs are there. The level of hatred towards the government and the hero commission is just intense, and it's brewing silently.  

SmallMight: They aren‚Äôt showing it in public, because we know what the Commission-owned journalists would do to them. They are all taking the punches in without sticking their heads out, and the Commission tends to use them as scapegoats over that. This adds to the hatred. 

SmallMight: Exchange got some light into the Table‚Äôs preparations. Weapon and support items gathering, organizing safehouses oddly near major Commission‚Äôs facilities, buying quirk analysis of Commission‚Äôs heroes on the black market (Vantablack noticed no less than thirty cases of someone remotely connected to supposed Table members buying those from the Exchange).

SmallMight: I had him ask some pre-League information brokers and some of them remember similar movements before Re-Destro‚Äôs coup. 

SmallMight: Why so silent?

Principal: Reevaluating various activities I noticed in the past, but might have misinterpreted. 

SpyingEye: Same. Continue narrating what you know. 

NapNeeded: This is quite horrible, but why am I here? Shouldn‚Äôt Ms. Joke be here instead?

SmallMight: Because I‚Äôm not certain where Ms. Joke‚Äôs loyalty lies in all of that. Nor about the other underground heroes.

NapNeeded: What are you insinuating?

SmallMight: That the Table has LOADS of underground heroes with ‚Äòvillainous‚Äô quirks in their ranks. Like ‚Öî of the Underground Hero Network belongs to the groups represented by the Table. And Ms. Joke is its head. 

SmallMight: I‚Äôm NOT taking any chances with this. 

SmallMight: Knuckleduster isn‚Äôt a part of the Table, but the League located several notable vigilantes connected to the preparations we noticed. 

TinTinCan: And Knuckleduster seems weirdly cozy with Miruko during the meetings. And they are all friends, I think? From some underground fight clubs? 

SmallMight: Yeah. But we all know how close Knuckleduster is with Naruhata vigilantes and we had CRAWLER of all people approach an Exchange-aligned information broker asking about a quirk analysis of some Commission hero. So either he is doing this behind Knuckleduster back, or the big boss asked him to do that and Crawler doesn‚Äôt know about the reasons OR they are both in it together. And if they are both together, the entire Alliance is. 

NapNeeded: shit

Lie Detector: to say the least

SmallMight: Gang Orca seems to the organizational leader of this whole thing, but Miruko (with her high rating and mouthy behaviour) is still a figurehead of the Table (just no patience for organizing a coup)

SmallMight: Orca seems to be going the ‚Äòlet‚Äôs build it up slowly and steadily‚Äô route, while Miruko seems to be trying to NOT overthrow the government (mostly due to the risk of the thing going bad and making mutant lives worse), but I‚Äôll be frank

SmallMight: According to Spinner, if the Commission does something REALLY mean against the complex mutant or villainous quirk heroes in public, Miruko will either take the lead and start the coup d‚Äôetat or will have herself and probably Gang Orca overthrown (Shishido is way more radical apparently). The lower ranks of the Table are pretty much permanently on fire. 

SmallMight: If Miruko wasn‚Äôt as mouthy, they would have overthrown her already for being disgustingly moderate (for their standards). Instead they look up to her for speaking what they think but in the people‚Äôs faces. 

SmallMight: So‚Ä¶ what do we do about it?
Notes:

    In case someone wondered, "Szczurzy Kr√≥l" means Rat King in Polish. It might be best not to know. Also no, Miruko's mysterious ship isn't Miruko x Knuckleduster, nor Miruko's Feet x HPSC' President's Face. Keep guessing.

    I'D ALSO LIKE TO ANNOUNCE TWO THINGS.

    THING NUMBER ONE: I HAVE DONE A ONE-SHOT. FEEL FREE TO GIVE IT A READ. https://archiveofourown.org/works/37871560

    THING NUMBER TWO: THERE ARE TWO MORE FICS IN THE SERIES, TIES THAT BIND IS SUPER COOL AND DEAD ON ARRIVAL IS APPARENTLY A BIT OF A VICTIM OF SO-SO TAGGING ISSUE AND I'VE BEEN TOLD REPEATEDLY THAT IT'S ACTUALLY VERY GOOD, SOME EVEN SAY THE BEST OF MY STUFF. Give it a chance, even if you aren't sure if the tags/idea suits you, k?

Summary:

    The war continues, families change, secrets are revealed and a blackmail is made.

Notes:

    Yes, not the right day. But I'm publishing two other fics today, AND it's my birthday so... have a present? :P

Chapter Text

All for One taught his child and successor many things. Oddly enough, ‚Äòhow to wage a war‚Äô wasn‚Äôt among them. Hisashi Midoriya ruled a secret empire from the shadows for two centuries, he never really (until the very end) had any enemy that could hope to topple it. One for All holders were more of an amusing distraction than threat. Heroes were meaningless before his might. Governments he could topple if he really wished to. 

He waged exactly a single war in his life, and for all intents and purposes he lost it. All Might (supported by Nedzu's and Sir Nighteye‚Äôs smarts and Tsukauchi‚Äôs circle of friends within the police) were gaining ground on him even before All for One messed up and ended up facing his archenemy alone, even without summoning his own bodyguard.

Izuku was thus content with delegating the general command of the war to those who already proved that they know how to win it. Nedzu and Sir Nighteye were carefully studying the events throughout the country, fishing for the operations that seemed to be connected to the Paranormal Liberation Front. Whenever they found something, they sent local heroes against it. 

Underground Network, Vigilante Alliance and the League of Villains were playing mostly supportive roles. Gathering intel primarily. Izuku was happy with that - people participating in the battle against Gigantomachia deserved some free time. Plus this gave him some time to continue subjugating whatever was left of the independent groups of the underworld. 

There weren‚Äôt many - criminal groups of Japan had either thrown their lot with the League of Villains or with the Paranormal Liberation Front. Izuku made some calculations, and it turned out that for the first time in forever, he could balance the League‚Äôs budget (if you exclude the ridiculous spending caused by war against PLF). 

He got his empire, though now had to cut down the sole remaining pretender to the throne. And voila. He would officially become a Symbol of Evil. Of course, whether groups loyal to him would stay loyal to him if there was no PLF to scare them straight was anyone‚Äôs guess. 

He missed no occasion to observe Nedzu and Sir Nighteye‚Äôs‚Äôs war craft. He was going to be their next opponent, and while he had no interest in anything besides an eternal stalemate, it wouldn‚Äôt be easy to achieve. He had to be better than his father if he wanted to achieve this.

They were obviously winning the war. Which left him incredibly nervous. He saw no signs of Mastermind‚Äôs handiwork. The heavy-hitters of the PLF were nowhere to be seen. Nobody saw Overhaul since the Training Camp attack. That was incredibly suspicious. Vantablack started to complain about not liking the silence (like he did before the training camp), and this alone brought back bad memories. 

Izuku was observing the news about a large (and successful) hero raid on some PLF hideout in eastern Tokyo (with Himiko and, surprisingly enough, Mei flanking him on the couch, stealing his chips) when the message came.  

 

DemonLord: Something came up.

DemonLord: When can you and your brother come home?

 

***

 

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your day, Machia?‚Äù Izuku asked after stepping through Kurogiri's warpgate. Asa emerged from it behind his back. 

‚ÄúYOUNG LORD!‚Äù Machia bellows. He is standing in front of Midoriya's house. Like a garden gnome, just big. And ugly. And capable of destroying a small city when asked. Asa is only slightly intimidated at this point. ‚ÄúEVERYTHING IS ALRIGHT, MACHIA GUARDS WELL!‚Äù 

He is wearing a pink scarf. Eri did it (Inko helped), because Machia looked like he could be cold. Standing outside, wearing only pants. Eri has swiftly deposed Izuku as the third most important person in Gigantomachia‚Äôs life, and Izuku didn‚Äôt even have a problem with that. Being in fourth place is good enough for him. 

‚ÄúGreat job, continue guarding.‚Äù Izuku says. Gigantomachia (now ‚Äòonly‚Äô three meters tall) nods fervently. Asa does his best to keep Izuku between him and the giant as they walk past it and enter the house. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ have an announcement to make.‚Äù Hisashi says. He and Inko are sitting on a couch on one side of the coffee table, while Izuku and Asa are on the one opposing it. Eri is in school currently, probably busy making her teachers and other students feel content in life. 

‚ÄúIs mom pregnant?‚Äù Izuku decides to ask. It really feels like something like it. Then again, he wasn‚Äôt there when she was pregnant for the first time (well, technically he did, just not in a position with a good view on what was happening). He has nothing to compare it to. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have another sibling?‚Äù 

‚ÄúErr‚Ä¶‚Äù Hisashi is taken aback slightly. ‚ÄúTo quote yourself‚Ä¶ yesn‚Äôt?‚Äù Now Izuku is very much lost. And so is Asa. ‚ÄúInko, please help me with this.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Inko replies promptly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve made your bed, now lie in it.‚Äù She is merciless on some occasions. When she isn‚Äôt crying or fainting, at least. 

‚ÄúUgh.‚Äù All for One is clearly uncomfortable with the subject and that alone is worrying. ‚ÄúAlright, so I‚Äôll just skip to the chase. I considered this a form of a joke, frankly, but I DID have someone do DNA tests on Asa. I assure you that I was absolutely and utterly shocked by the discovery that he actually IS my biological son.‚Äù 

Asa stares at All for One looking like he wasn‚Äôt sure what he just heard. Izuku actually has a similar look on his face. In moments like this, it‚Äôs really easy to see familial similarities between them. 

‚ÄúWait, WHAT?!‚Äù Izuku is the first to regain his bearings. ‚ÄúBut you said there was no one but my mom!‚Äù 

‚ÄúBecause there wasn‚Äôt!‚Äù Hisashi is defensive. Very much. Then again, he is still alive (despite the whole ‚Äòchild out of wedlock‚Äô thing), so if Inko didn‚Äôt murder him, he had to find a really good explanation for it. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt very‚Ä¶ interested in sex. First I was too busy building my empire, and then I felt content ruling everything and everyone. And collecting quirks. However that might sound, Inko is the first woman in my life.‚Äù Izuku starts to wonder if his‚Ä¶ problems with relationships aren‚Äôt inherited as well. ‚ÄúI think that I found an explanation for it, however.‚Äù 

‚ÄúExplanation?‚Äù Izuku says. Asa is still out of commission. Izuku puts his arm around him as a form of emotional support. Although it might also be a physical support if Rabbit ends up fainting. 

‚ÄúAbout twenty two years ago Doctor Garaki approached me with an‚Ä¶ idea. For an experiment plus something more.‚Äù All for One replies. ‚ÄúIt was a form of an eugenic program, to be honest. He wanted to set up a fertility clinic as a front, offering in vitro treatment to pairs with fertility issues. In some rare cases he would‚Ä¶ replace the sperm or eggs with those from some high ranked villains bearing powerful quirks. Said ‚Äòrare cases‚Äô would be mostly dictated by whether the villain in question was similar enough in looks to the ‚Äòreplaced‚Äô parent to avoid being ousted easily‚Ä¶ and by whether the quirks of said villain and the other parents promised the resulting offspring to possess powerful quirks.‚Äù The biggest sign of how much Eri changed him is the fact that he genuinely looks ashamed of what he was saying. 

‚ÄúAlright, so I just found something even worse than quirk marriages.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúWow. You agreed to that?‚Äù 

‚ÄúActually I didn‚Äôt.‚Äù Hisashi replies, surprising him. ‚ÄúNot on the moral grounds, mind you. Mostly because if the children developed powerful quirks, there was a high chance of them becoming heroes. That meant their DNA being added to the databases, and high risk of someone noticing that they are an off-spring of some completely unrelated supervillain. Which would expose the entire program to the world. So for me, it looked like something you invest into for decades only to lose the whole thing soon after its debut. However I didn‚Äôt forbid the doctor from pursuing it, just pointed out the flaws and said that I‚Äôm not going to finance it. Now, however, I confirmed that Asa is actually my son, despite me never meeting his mother. And I know that Doctor Garaki ran certain tests on me after I met Inko, to see if I can actually have a child despite having an immortality quirk. What‚Äôs more, I had someone investigate the issue‚Ä¶ and discovered that Asa was born as a result of in-vitro fertilization in some rather unassuming fertility clinic.‚Äù Hisashi sighs. ‚ÄúOne that was opened twenty-two years ago.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDo we know‚Ä¶ how many ‚Äòspecial‚Äô children were born that way?‚Äù Izuku asks, still in shock. Asa is in even greater shock. 

‚ÄúUnfortunately, we don‚Äôt.‚Äù Hisashi replies. ‚ÄúYou might want to set heroes upon it. Garaki is your enemy, and‚Ä¶ well, it might be best to locate the resulting children before the PLF does. Because the older ones are young adults right now, and it‚Äôs possible that Overhaul will try to recruit them. Or kidnap for experiments.‚Äù 

He was certainly going to do this. If only out of spite. Garaki just upped a level or two in Izuku‚Äôs hate list. 

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù Izuku turns his head towards Asa. Rabbit is staring at him with wide eyes. ‚Äú... even more of a brother, hmm?‚Äù 

Asa‚Äôs face suddenly erupts with a smile. He hugs Izuku, who hugs him back. Two seconds later Inko is behind Asa, and joins the group hug. Hisashi is only slightly slower.

SmallMight: I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT

VampirePrincess: oh?

Vantablack: gimme, your announcements are always gold

ClownLord: YES I AGREE BUT THEY ARE GOLD WITH JUST A HINT OF EXISTENTIAL HORROR

ToxicGirl: Just please not an another Gigantomachia

Insomniac: we are in agreement on that, @ToxicGirl 

SmallMight: following way too many jokes about how Asa looks like my biological brother, my dad decided to do DNA tests just to prove that this isn‚Äôt the case

SmallMight: as a result @Mini-Miruko levelled up from my cherished adopted brother to my cherished biological half-brother

CatProvider: What?

VampirePrincess: :D :D :D 

Vantablack: WTF

ClownLord: oh great, another smol All for One

ToxicGirl: O-O 

SneakyGecko: okay that was the last thing I expected xD

Mini-Miruko: I‚Äôm happy

Mini-Miruko: if my brother and father are confident and smart and powerful

Mini-Miruko: then I can be like that too!

SmallMight: :3

VampirePrincess: Oh you‚Äôll be!

ToxicGirl: Yep! Also you are already smart! Super-smart. And your quirk is powerful. You just need to work on confidence :D

Mini-Miruko: thank you!

CatProvider: Did your dad survive that discovery? I‚Äôm almost certain that Inko can probably defeat him and Gigantomachia at once if she gets really angry. At least when she manages to surprise him (I still remember that chokehold). 

SmallMight: Well he found a very good explanation. Turns out that Doctor Garaki is running a fertility clinic where he might tinker around with in-vitro treatments to mass-produce descendants of villains with powerful quirks. And he MIGHT have obtained dad‚Äôs sperm when dad asked him to check if he is actually fertile after all these years. 

Vantablack: Oh dear

SmallMight: less Nedzu impression please

Vantablack: this is kinda sick

SmallMight: yes

VampirePrincess: seriously messed up 

SmallMight: yes

SmallMight: apparently Garaki did it behind his back, but I‚Äôm only 75% certain that it was really the case

SneakyGecko: So we might have who-knows-how-many people related to supervillains out there, with powerful quirks, and PLF knows who they are? 

SmallMight: YES AND THAT‚ÄôS KINDA A PROBLEM

SmallMight: Also he ran DNA tests on blood samples of everyone from the League (remember the Incense-ordered blood tests once we returned from Machia outing?) 

SmallMight: ‚Ä¶ we have three matches other than Mini-Miruko. Although only two seem to be a product of the same program. 

VampirePrincess: Oh great, another ‚Äòlet‚Äôs tilt your world upside down‚Äô talk

SmallMight: you‚Äôre not going to let that thing go, aren‚Äôt you?

VampirePrincess: nope :D 

ToxicGirl: Who is it? I hope it‚Äôs not me. 

SmallMight: no, you are clean

SmallMight: But it turns out that Juggernaut‚Äôs apparent resemblance to Gigantomachia ISN‚ÄôT a coincidence. 

Juggernaut: ‚Ä¶ 

Juggernaut: Seriously? 

SmallMight: I wouldn‚Äôt joke about that. 

SmallMight: So yeah, you technically spend 54 days beating your biological father into submission. While he was trying to murder you. And I don‚Äôt think he has enough brainpower to understand the concept of being a father. 

Juggernaut: It‚Äôs alright. I was adopted. And I knew about it. 

ToxicGirl: Oh yeah, you showed me the pictures. Your parents are smol. Absolutely not similar to you in any way. 

ToxicGirl: and quite cool, though I guess they are similar in that one thing

Juggernaut: yes, they are my parents, regardless of how they obtained me

VampirePrincess: okay so this turned out super wholesome

Vantablack: yep

SmallMight: Nice to know that we actually have a member without parental issues

Blueberry: So what, am I Eclipse‚Äôs daughter actually? xD That would be hilarious. 

SmallMight: uhm, about that...

Blueberry: Are you kidding me?

SmallMight: THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE COINCIDENCE BUT SOMEHOW YOU ACTUALLY KINDA ARE

Vantablack: Holy shit this is just so messed up, makes you wonder how many goddamn kids Garaki produced

SmallMight: I‚Äôm going to ask Nedzu to find out. Because holy shit.

Blueberry: OMG

Blueberry: I PRETENDED TO BE HER DAUGHTER FOR MONTHS BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT I ACTUALLY AM HER DAUGHTER

Blueberry: HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FEEL ABOUT THIS

SmallMight: I DON‚ÄôT KNOW

Blueberry: Wait

Blueberry: YOU KILLED MY MOTHER AND GAVE ME HER QUIRK 

SmallMight: I KNOW

SmallMight: in my defense, she was a bitch

Blueberry: Ok that does sounds like a fair reason

Blueberry: especially as I agree about her being a bitch

Blueberry: I guess this explains why I look similar to her omg

SmallMight: That‚Äôs actually what gave me an idea to make you pretend to be her daughter, oh the irony

SmallMight: What‚Äôs more the late-bloomers have a high chance of having quirkless children, so‚Ä¶ yeah, that explains why I had to give you a quirk to begin with, ugh. 

SmallMight: And why you mastered it so quickly (you must have inherited the minor biological adaptations to it from Eclipse, just not the quirk itself).

SmallMight: you joining the QLF and then League and then me forming QEM with you as its head as an Eclipse daughter is just an absolute coincidence though

Vantablack: What‚Äôs the chance of THREE kids from the list ending in a single organization at the same time?

SmallMight: Small unless the initial numbers are big. Then again, we are a villain group mostly formed of villains of appropriate age but powerful quirks so we are probably overrepresented BUT

SmallMight: THERE MIGHT BE DOZENS OF CHILDREN LIKE THAT OUT THERE

SmallMight: ¬æ are probably young heroes or are going to hero schools (unless their parents were messy or circumstances made them go villain)

SmallMight: UA is going to get a common brain aneurysm over that, and don‚Äôt have me started on what Commission will do

SmallMight: jesus christ I hate Garaki now

SmallMight: The third one is‚Ä¶ well, not related to the program at all. And it‚Äôs about Awoo. 

Awoo: ???

HandyMan: ???

Insomniac: just make a single account it‚Äôs not like you are two people at this point, just one person with two bodies

SmallMight: ^

SmallMight: I MIGHT have found who your father was. On a complete accident. 

SmallMight: Although it‚Äôs not that much of a suprise, because with how‚Ä¶ rape‚Äôy he gets, he probably has a lot of children. 

Awoo: Oh. 

HandyMan: who 

SmallMight: Beast. 

 

***

 

SmallMight: I‚Äôd like to make an announcement that by a complete accident I have discovered a large, 22 years old and probably still on-going operation of Doctor Garaki and this discovery is going to make the entire society poop square for months if made public. If not years. 

TinTinCan: ‚Ä¶ 

TinTinCan: Great. 

NapNeeded: More nightmares? 

Principal: Oh dear. 

SpyingEye: And I assume that this is something that you need our help to dismantle?

SmallMight: More like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to touch that mess with a twenty feet pole encased in barbed wire and besides this is going to be a PR nightmare for everyone in this country so have fun dealing with this while I‚Äôm cuddling with girls and playing videogames with boys in my hidden lair‚Äô. 

AllRight: ?

SmallMight: turns out that Doctor Garaki is using some large fertility clinic to run a longtime eugenics program during which he impregnates random women with children of various supervillains with sufficiently powerful quirks through in-vitro fertilization. For the past twenty-two years. 

TinTinCan: ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

Principal: Oh dear. 

LieDetector: ‚Ä¶

SmallMight: YES THAT‚ÄôS EXACTLY MY REACTION JESUS CHRIST

SmallMight: It turns out that I have three such children within the League of Villains alone. I don‚Äôt want to speculate how many more are out there, but you should probably start running genetic tests on everyone <=22 years old with powerful quirks. 

SmallMight: I HAVE CHILDREN OF ECLIPSE, GIGANTOMACHIA AND ALL FOR ONE IN MY LEAGUE AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY OTHERS LIKE THEM ARE OUT THERE
SpyingEye: YOU WHAT

SmallMight: I DON‚ÄôT GET IT MYSELF 

Principal: Okay this is the moment when I of all people need to say WHAT THE HELL. And brew more tea. A lot more.

LieDetector: And I need to get very very very drunk. 

AllRight: Each time I think that All for One can‚Äôt get any worse than he already is, he pulls something like that. Even from beyond the grave. 

SmallMight: I don‚Äôt want to rock your boat, All Might, but me and mom went through some old documents and I‚Äôm 99% sure that Garaki did it behind his back. He apparently considered it a waste of time that can be easily unmade when only someone notices that some powerful hero is a genetic descendant of an unrelated supervillain. 

Principal: So you admit that All for One is your father? 

SmallMight: You and Eraserhead are literally the only people on this chatroom who didn‚Äôt know that for sure already.

NapNeeded: what?

Principal: Oh?

AllRight: Legion is right. There has been a certain development in Lemillion‚Äôs quirk which has proven that beyond any doubt. But we were trying to keep that development under wraps for the time being. And we couldn‚Äôt provide any evidence for Legion‚Äôs parentage without explaining said development. 

SpyingEye: Mirio?
TinTinCan: yeah so apparently my quirk finally matured, and I‚Äôm going to inherit (one by one) quirks of all of my predecessors (sans those quirkless). Also I have 26 dead heroes in my head and they are apparently running a democracy in there. 

TinTinCan: I‚Äôm not exactly sure how to explain that to people so I preferred to keep only a minimal amount of people aware of it. 

NapNeeded: I think I can understand why. 

TinTinCan: I wouldn‚Äôt believe it myself if I didn‚Äôt unlock Nana Shimura‚Äôs (All Might‚Äôs teacher) quirk right after talking with her in a dream. 

TinTinCan: Finding out that I can now fly has been a bit of a game-changer. 

TinTinCan: The point is that said heroes confirmed (after brief physical contact with Legion in Hosu) that he is All for One‚Äôs son AND has inherited his quirk. But he only had ten quirks as a whole, and only one was stolen (from the original Overhaul) while the rest he received from willing donors. And after reviewing what they knew about Overhaul, they voted 24:2 to let that one act of quirk-stealing slide. 

Principal: I really think that I should be informed about this earlier.

TinTinCan: I have a deal with Legion - for as long as the 26 dead heroes in my head consider him to NOT be a younger version of All for One, I‚Äôm treating him like any other villain out there. If they ever change their mind, I‚Äôm switching to extermination mode (so, All Might vs All for One feud mark 2) and make it my sole focus. 

TinTinCan: Didn‚Äôt mention it to anyone I didn‚Äôt have to, because, well, it‚Äôs easy to overreact when you hear about Legion being able to steal quirks and so on. 

TinTinCan: Thus far I think the heroes in my head lowkey like him, actually? Especially his uncle, the First Holder. Nana Shimura too, because he almost killed himself to save Gran Torino in Hosu.

TinTinCan: And after hearing about League members' backstories I developed an intense dislike towards the idea of pursuing and trying to kill Legion due to his quirk or who his father was, rather than trying to pursue and apprehend him due to his actions.

SpyingEye: Fully understandable AND commendable approach. 

Principal: I see. Well, that explains your drive to confirm his words wherever possible. And I believe I will adapt a similar approach to him to said dead heroes. 

SmallMight: awww

SmallMight: @TinTinCan do you want to hear the peak hilarity of this discovery

TinTinCan: I don‚Äôt think that saying no will change anything so yes

SmallMight: I had my mom adopt Asa Naoki as my younger brother ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT HE ACTUALLY WAS MY YOUNGER BROTHER

SpyingEye: ‚Ä¶ 

TinTinCan: WHAT THE HELL

SmallMight: I DON‚ÄôT KNOW

SmallMight: WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF THIS HAPPENING

Principal: That depends on the number of children born through that program.

Principal: Good news is that the number isn‚Äôt large, most likely. The candidates need to be vetted with extreme attention to details in order to avoid discovery. In vitro treatment isn‚Äôt THAT common. I don‚Äôt think there are more than 20-30 such children.

Principal: But we can expect most of them to have powerful, class four-five quirks. So most of them are either villains and heroes.

Principal: Add League‚Äôs tendency to recruit brilliant young villains of appropriate age and you suddenly have an over-representation of Garaki‚Äôs children in their midst. 

SpyingEye: We‚Äôll have to step VERY carefully in this. Majority of them have probably become heroes or are striving towards this goal (powerful quirk bearers tend to do that). If we come forward with this, we can ruin careers and lives of many people who do not deserve that. 

Principal: True. But we also need to dismantle that clinic before it produces more of such children. AND find out who they are. 

SmallMight: because we cannot be sure if Garaki and the PLF aren‚Äôt going to try to pick them up. It sickens me but they are like a buffet of powerful quirks to be harvested for his noumufication program. Or to be recruited (some false story, DNA tests result and you can drive a wedge between them and their families easily).

Principal: Indeed. 

SmallMight: I‚Äôm sending @Principal and @SpyingEye links to the webpage of the clinic in question. Find some alternative explanation for walking into it and starting to arrest people and check computers.

SmallMight: Might end up finding something about Garaki too, hopefully.

 

***

 

TinTinCan: There is something I need to ask you about.

SmallMight: Back to a private chat with just the two of us?

TinTinCan: Yeah. 

SmallMight: Sure then, what is it?

TinTinCan: Is your dad still alive?

SmallMight: What

SmallMight: What brought that question? 

TinTinCan: Your uncle‚Äôs ceaseless paranoia about his brother.

SmallMight: ???

TinTinCan: You keep referring to what happened to your father as him getting beaten up or ‚Äòforcefully retired‚Äô and so on by All Might, but never ever did I hear the word ‚Äòkilled‚Äô or any other word directly meaning ‚Äòdead‚Äô.

SmallMight: I just dislike thinking that my idol killed my father so I refer to it differently

TinTinCan: I‚Äôm not buying that.

SmallMight: What?

TinTinCan: You dislike directly lying to people you respect. When you really need it, you just make them come to a wrong assumption on their own. Or tell them that you can‚Äôt talk with them about something.

TinTinCan: So my educated guess is that your dad is alive. 

 

(the heroes in Lemillion‚Äôs head start waking up from their stupor - they saw his investigation, but it was only known that he vocalized (or, to be exact, wrote down) his theory. The First Holder watches what‚Äôs happening with attentive eyes)

 

SmallMight: and now you‚Äôre just talking through your ass

SmallMight: you don‚Äôt just stand up from a hit like that

TinTinCan: So he didn‚Äôt stand up. Let me guess, life support?

SmallMight: STOP TWISTING MY WORDS

TinTinCan: Still no straightforward answer. So let me make it easier.

TinTinCan: Your uncle had me investigate the hospital where your father was pronounced dead. Imagine my surprise when I found the doctor who pronounced him dead to be oddly cozy with Doctor Garaki during his tenure in the hospital in question.

SmallMight: What

TinTinCan: If you don‚Äôt give me sufficient reason NOT to do this, I‚Äôm telling Sir Nighteye, All Might and Nedzu about my findings. Them knowing that your father MIGHT be alive will change their approach to League entirely. 

SmallMight: THIS IS BLACKMAIL

TinTinCan: THIS IS PLUS ULTRA PERSUASION

TinTinCan: Talk to me, Izuku. 

SmallMight: FUCK YOU MIRIO

TinTinCan: Time to ask the question on the alliance chatroom then

SmallMight: OK STOP 

SmallMight: Damn it. 

SmallMight: You won. 

SmallMight: YES MY DAD IS STILL ALIVE

 

(First Holder‚Äôs face darkens. Shouts start behind him. Even Nana is back.) 

 

SmallMight: Spent several years on life support, blind and almost deaf. Then Eri fixed him up and he decided that he isn‚Äôt paid enough to risk this shit again and decided to retire from crime and live with his family full time. 

SmallMight: I think that the only crime he committed during last year is paying me an allowance since it‚Äôs technically financing the League? I think that he is even paying taxes properly nowadays. 

 

(Rioting heroes go quiet. All watch the unbelievable words in front of them together. The First Holder feels his jaw drop)

 

SmallMight: Considering the current hour, he is probably watching cartoons with Eri. 

SmallMight: Didn‚Äôt steal a single quirk since the battle (save for Overhaul‚Äôs, but he gave that one to me).

SmallMight: Listen if you want to fight him over his past crimes, be my guest. He deserves a lifetime in prison, regardless of my feelings for him as a father. Heroes in your head alone deserve justice for what he did to them. And sometimes their families. And friends. And probably pets and neighbors, and their workers at their favourite cafe/bar. 

SmallMight: But NOT now. He is back to full strength. All Might won narrowly last time because my dad gloated over his broken body. I assure you that he won‚Äôt make the same mistake again. 

SmallMight: There is a reason why I‚Äôm doing my best to make him stay in retirement. 

SmallMight: You are too weak to make a difference, at least yet. And we CAN‚ÄôT lose All Might right now or we‚Äôll lose the war

SmallMight: take advantage of the fact that his power stays the same, bulk up your quirk, then ask me to set up a meeting when you‚Äôll be strong enough to apprehend him without dying or getting maimed AND we won‚Äôt be risking Japan changing into postapocalyptic wasteland if you get crippled

SmallMight: Just DON‚ÄôT TRY ANYTHING NOW AND DON‚ÄôT TELL A WORD TO THE UA

SmallMight: You‚Äôll just give Overhaul the greatest gift ever with that

TinTinCan: I need proof for all of that. 

SmallMight: what proof am I supposed to give you?! A picture of him (wearing a really atrocious fake moustache), me and Eri at a Herocon last year? I can send you one at a moment‚Äôs notice, but I don‚Äôt think that can persuade you and the heroes in your head in any way. 

TinTinCan: I have an idea. But you will not like it. 

 

Neither did the twenty six dead heroes in his head. 
Notes:

    Okay, so I have a few things to say.

    1. Inko beating All for One and Gigantomachia is impossible, in fact either of them would defeat her on their own. It's just that Inko managed to obtain a Memetic Badass status within the family, hence the jokes.
    2. Beast: *exists*. Tenko Shimura: I'm about to end this man's whole career. [you've really done f__k up old man]
    3.
    "SmallMight: I had my mom adopt Asa Naoki as my younger brother ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT HE ACTUALLY WAS MY YOUNGER BROTHER

    SpyingEye: ‚Ä¶ "

    Can you see this? This three simple dots contain the immeasurable fury and self-hatred of a man who realized that he could have All for One's son (with a powerful quirk, no less) as a sidekick at his agency. If he didn't f__k up. Words truly fail to describe it properly.

    4. Mirio made quite a good blackmail and Izuku got so used to being his (kind of) friend that he once again attempted a Plus Ultra tactic of convincing Mirio that he is actually an ok guy, despite the whole supervillain status. Whether it worked remains to be seen. Let's just say that considering what sort of plan Mirio has, he might actually have a deathwish.

Chapter 48: Confirmation
Summary:

    Lemillion makes a horrible decision, resulting in a very awkward family reunion. A new plan is made. Mr. Compress discovers something pretty great.

Notes:

    The last time I published the evening prior to the normal morning release, I suddenly was flooded with comments. I'm experimenting if this is how it works for real. So, take the Thursday/Friday release a bit ahead of schedule.

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

‚ÄúI just want to stress it once again.‚Äù Legion announces. The atmosphere in the room - the living room of the League‚Äôs headquarters - is tense. Lots of people are staring at each other with complicated expressions on their faces. ‚ÄúThis is a horrible, horrible idea.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre overreacting.‚Äù Lemillion promptly replies. Tsukauchi doesn‚Äôt believe it himself, but he is with Legion on that one. Eraserhead mumbles something nasty, probably busy memorizing faces of the League members. Especially the new ones. 

‚ÄúI most certainly am not.‚Äù Legion answers and lets out a loud sigh. ‚ÄúDo you seriously need to go Plus Ultra on everything, even bad decisions?!‚Äù His last attempt to discourage the hero from doing whatever stupidity this whole venture is goes unanswered. ‚ÄúAlright. Mei, give it to Eraserhead.‚Äù 

The crazy tech-girl approaches the Erasure Hero and hands him an external hard drive. 

‚ÄúThis hard drive contains the coordinates of League‚Äôs headquarters, and enough data about our associated businesses to sink half of the underworld. Plus everything you need to locate my sister AND my home.‚Äù Legion informs. Truth. ‚ÄúThere are no secret mechanisms inside of it to destroy it or otherwise stop you from accessing the data if Lemillion and or Detective Tsukauchi do not return from the meeting.‚Äù Truth . ‚ÄúI still think that it‚Äôs a horrible idea.‚Äù Truth . 

How did Lemillion persuade Legion to give them so much of a leverage?! Tsukauchi is honestly shocked by it. He asked Mirio, but Sir Nighteye‚Äôs student proved to walk in his mentor‚Äôs footsteps. Getting anything out of him was a chore. And a useless one, since Tsukauchi got nowhere with it. 

‚ÄúAnd we, as I said, will not access the hard drive or in any way copy its contents unless Lemillion and Tsukauchi will not return. We‚Äôll then give it back to you.‚Äù Eraserhead replies. Truth . ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make sure of it. In exchange, I‚Äôd like to have ten minutes alone with Kurogiri. I want to talk with him about something, and I will return him unharmed.‚Äù Truth.  

Legion looks at the detective questioningly. 

‚ÄúHe told the truth.‚Äù Detective replies. 

‚ÄúWell then I hope that you did it as well.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúBecause otherwise you‚Äôll all die horribly.‚Äù 

Truth . 

What did Tsukauchi agree to? 

‚ÄúKurogiri.‚Äù Legion says with a tired expression. ‚ÄúWarp me, Asa, Lemillion and the detective to my home, please. Let‚Äôs get this over with.‚Äù 

 

***

 

The secretive residence of the Midoriyas was a small mansion in the middle of the woods. Tsukauchi actually pictured the Mischief‚Äôs retirement house as something slightly more‚Ä¶ humble? Then again, if she truly was a widowed wife of the All for One, she had enough money for this.

‚ÄúYOUNG LORD, WHO IS IT?‚Äù Tsukauchi almost jumped at the sudden shout. He turned his head to face it and‚Ä¶ wait, was that the fabled Gigantomachia?! WITH A PINK SCARF?! WITH A SMALL GIRL RIDING ON HIS SHOULDER?! 

‚ÄúGuests, Machia.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúInko invited them. What are you doing with Eri?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYOUNG LADY WANTED TO GO ON A WALK TO A FOREST!‚Äù Gigantomachia bellows. ‚ÄúMACHIA HELPS!‚Äù 

‚ÄúWonderful!‚Äù Legion says with his fingers raised. ‚ÄúBut before that‚Ä¶ Eri, do you recognize him?‚Äù He adds, while pointing towards Lemillion.

The girl's eyes go wide. 

‚ÄúLemillion!‚Äù She shouts with a really wide smile. ‚ÄúMachia, put me down!‚Äù The giant does that with a gentleness that Tsukauchi didn‚Äôt expect from him. The girl runs over to Mirio. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your fan, Lemillion! Can you please give me your autograph?‚Äù  

Lemillion comes prepared and actually hands her a signed photo of himself after his victory in the last sport festival (the one where he actually wears his clothes, not the ‚Äòaccident' one). The girl beams. 

Then Tsukauchi sees the people watching them from the building‚Äôs entrance. Mischief and‚Ä¶

Tsukauchi almost gets a heart attack. 

 

***

 

The atmosphere during the dinner is the absolute definition of awkward, Lemillion decides. They are all sitting around a dinner table. All for One and Lemillion are on the opposite ends. To Mirio‚Äôs left side is Detective Tsukauchi (still absolutely white as a sheet and probably planning to murder Lemillion for not telling him what this was all about earlier) and Mischief. To his right side is Legion and then the only slightly infamous Rabbit. 

(‚ÄúWHY DID ALL MIGHT CHOOSE SOMEONE WITH A DEATH WISH TO BE THE NEXT HOLDER!‚Äù Lariat shouts in Mirio‚Äôs head, although he doesn‚Äôt hear it. 

‚ÄúI DON‚ÄôT KNOW!!!‚Äù Nana Shimura shouts back. Other heroes are either panicking or praying. First Holder is practically comatose with horror at this point.)

‚ÄúI told you that this was a horrible idea.‚Äù Legion whispers to Lemillion. The hero shrugs. He needed confirmation that All for One wasn‚Äôt a threat for the time being. All for One was at best half the usual level of threat when devoid of his organization, and it was either gone or serving Legion or Overhaul. The data he received as a leverage was enough to dismantle everything AlO could potentially recruit. 

It should make him behave.

(‚ÄúIT MOST CERTAINLY WILL NOT!‚Äù Black Whip Hero shouts. He is only repeating his reaction to the initial findings - after all, Mirio stated that line of reasoning multiple times. At this point, he is practically reading Lemillion‚Äôs mind. The look Legion received was a familiar one.) 

‚ÄúI heard a lot about your cooking, Miss Inko.‚Äù Lemillion ignores Legion entirely. ‚ÄúBut it really doesn‚Äôt do its justice. This is absolutely delicious.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt have to lie. This is some of the tastiest food he ever got to eat. 

‚ÄúOh thank you!‚Äù Mischief smiles. Her smile is truly heartwarming. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to be appreciated. What about you, Detective?‚Äù 

‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù Tsukauchi mumbles. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not‚Ä¶ feeling‚Ä¶ well. No appetite.‚Äù Lemillion can understand that. He knew that the detective wouldn‚Äôt agree to meet THE ALL FOR ONE himself, so he had to hide that part from him. 

‚ÄúEat. Your. Food. Tsukauchi.‚Äù All for One speaks for the first time in a while. Lemillion is flooded with dread. Something in All for One‚Äôs voice and presence makes him tremble. Detective slumps on the chair. It lasts until they all hear a loud BAM. ‚ÄúSTOP EMBARRASSING ME IN FRONT OF EVERY GUEST, INKO!‚Äù 

(‚ÄúDid she just‚Ä¶ hit him in the head with a newspaper?‚Äù One of the heroes (well, technically a vigilante) in the background asks. The rest simply stares in shock and disbelief. They did hear about it from Legion, they just didn‚Äôt really believe it.) 

‚ÄúTHEN STOP SCARING EVERY GUEST FOR LIFE, HISASHI!‚Äù Inko shouts back, putting the rolled newspaper next to her plate. ‚ÄúDo you know how rarely do we get actual guests here? Extremely! I like the peace and quiet, but sometimes I actually want to meet people! And you traumatizing every guest isn‚Äôt helping, so you WILL behave or you can start moving your suit collection to the guest room. And everything else too.‚Äù All for One looks genuinely terrified by her now.

‚ÄúYour brother is probably on the verge of a heart attack.‚Äù Legion says absentmindedly while poking at his food. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs even an option at this point. At least TRY to behave in front of him, alright?‚Äù 

All for One looks at him as if he saw his son for the first time. 

‚ÄúMy brother is what?‚Äù He asks after a few seconds of shocked silence. 

‚ÄúYou remember my One for All soul-carrying theory?‚Äù Izuku replies. He looks really done with his life at this point. ‚ÄúLemillion confirmed it. He has every single Holder freeloading in his head, including Yoichi. He even talks with them occasionally. And they are seeing you now.‚Äù 

All for One‚Äôs face turns towards Lemillion. Mirio has no idea how to describe the look on his face. 

‚ÄúYOICHI YOU UNGRATEFUL SON OF A BITCH!‚Äù He finally shouts. He is absolutely, absolutely furious. ‚ÄúSTOP BEING A PROBLEM TO ME EVEN TWO CENTURIES AFTER YOUR DEATH!‚Äù

(‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôRE ONE TO TALK, HISASHI!‚Äù Yoichi shouts back. ‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôRE THE SON OF THE SAME WOMAN YOU AMNESIAC ASSHOLE! AND YOUR MEGALOMANIAC ASS IS A PROBLEM TO ME TOO!‚Äù) 

Yoichi was apparently loud or angry enough for Lemillion to hear the retort. His connection with the heroes was slowly growing stronger.   

‚ÄúYoichi said, and I quote: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre one to talk, Hisashi. You‚Äôre the son of the same woman, you amnesiac asshole.‚Äô‚Äù He obediently repeats. All for One looks like he forgot how to breathe for a few seconds. ‚Äú‚ÄòAnd your megalomaniac ass is a problem to me too.‚Äù

(‚ÄúWHY ARE YOU PROVOKING HIM, YOICHI!‚Äù Lariat shouts, while Nana panics visibly behind him. 

‚ÄúI DIDN‚ÄôT THINK THAT MIRIO WOULD HEAR IT!‚Äù Yoichi shouts back, now visibly terrified. Why did Lemillion repeat what he heard?! Does he truly have a death wish?!)

‚ÄúHisashi.‚Äù Mischief says before All for One has the time to shout back or activate his quirks. ‚ÄúDo you want to live in the guest room from now until your death? And you are immortal, so it will be a while.‚Äù This calms him down. Or, more like, makes him reconsider what he was planning to do. ‚ÄúWonderful. I believe that Lemillion came here to ask you some questions.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs correct.‚Äù Mirio replies. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve managed to obtain some‚Ä¶ circumstantial evidence for All for One‚Äôs survival after his fight against All Might.‚Äù Something flinches on All for One‚Äôs face when he hears those two words. ‚ÄúI used them to blackmail Legion into organizing this meeting. Legion claims that you have retired, are not stealing quirks anymore and are not a threat for the time being. I have brought Detective Tsukauchi with his lie-detecting quirk to confirm that your existence isn‚Äôt a threat to Japan currently. Detective, could you confirm this?‚Äù 

‚ÄúUgh.‚Äù Detective seems to have woken up from the stupor. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ guess. So, is it true that you retired?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes. I did.‚Äù All for One replies promptly. ‚ÄúI do not keep any contact with active villains outside of Gigantomachia, Kurogiri and my two sons, plus Izuku‚Äôs wives. I‚Äôm running a legal business, but do not expect me to tell you anything about that. My only crime during the recent year or so is financing the League of Villains. And it‚Äôs mostly me liquidating my old funds. This house I bought with money I earned legally.‚Äù

‚ÄúT...ruth.‚Äù Detective announces, obviously shocked by it himself. 

(Silence in the hall. Once again, they did hear about it. But it was too surreal to truly and honestly believe it. Did All for One have a quirk to fool Tsukauchi‚Äôs?!) 

‚ÄúAlright, so‚Ä¶ did you steal any quirks since your fight against All Might?‚Äù Tsukauchi has a working brain. Finding out if All for One grew stronger in the meantime is a very good idea. 

‚ÄúI stole only one quirk. From Overhaul.‚Äù All for One replies. ‚ÄúHowever I gave it to my son.‚Äù 

‚ÄúTruth.‚Äù Detective is visibly shocked by this too, although he also starts to get used to the rather shocking situation. Heroes in Mirio‚Äôs head remain silent. ‚ÄúIs there anything that can make you‚Ä¶ unretire yourself?‚Äù He asks. 

‚ÄúDirect threat to either Eri or Inko.‚Äù All for One replies, his face still clouded with anger. ‚ÄúIzuku made me promise him to not unretire myself if he is killed or imprisoned, and I plan to uphold this vow. He also included Asa in this deal, since they are both villains and they know the risks. Nothing else can make me return to the old business.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat is‚Ä¶ the truth.‚Äù Detective announces. 

(‚ÄúWait, he ACTUALLY retired?!‚Äù One of the dead heroes asks, finally breaking the silence. ‚ÄúAND HE BECAME A FAMILY MAN?!‚Äù 

Yoichi stares in silence. This is literally the last thing he expected to find out. Hisashi was rather protective of him (due to his weak health) early on, so it‚Äôs not like there was no precedence to this. But the ambitions and powerlust have quickly warped him, making him into an increasing control freak. And then a shadow dictator. But this‚Ä¶ what the hell happened to him?!) 

‚ÄúDid you‚Ä¶‚Äù Detective seems to be trying to figure out how to word his next question properly. ‚ÄúDid you retire as a part of some grander scheme?‚Äù 

(Yoichi nods - this is a very good question. His brother could certainly plan something years ahead, making even supposed mistakes and retirement merely a phase of a grand strategy.) 

‚ÄúActually, I did.‚Äù All for One replies, surprising everyone. Even Legion and Mischief appear to be taken aback. ‚ÄúI expected my son to face enough opposition and some failures for the heroes to push him back into my arms, to make him embrace my idea of evil. Then I would unretire myself, with him as my right hand man. I abandoned this plan entirely when I heard of him wiretapping Nedzu‚Äôs office, since he has proven to be able to do things that I never managed to do. He has outperformed my expectations so many times that I came to a conclusion that I‚Äôm truly too old for being an active villain, and have truly, officially and without any hidden strings attached retired.‚Äù He sighs. ‚ÄúAt this point I‚Äôm starting to think that he is better at being a villain than me, either way.‚Äù 

‚ÄúTruth.‚Äù Detective announces. He is so much beyond shocked at this point that he doesn‚Äôt even look surprised anymore. 

‚ÄúAny more questions?‚Äù All for One asks, with a weird mix of tiredness and anger on his face. 

‚ÄúFor the current moment, no.‚Äù Detective would have gladly asked some questions about his business (and former villainous activities), but it‚Äôs not like there is a chance for All for One to answer them. 

‚ÄúGreat.‚Äù All for One‚Äôs tiredness vanishes in a heartbeat. ‚ÄúSo now that I heard that my beloved brother‚Äôs here, I‚Äôm going to say hello to him. In person.‚Äù Lemillion panics only slightly. ‚ÄúIf I try to steal your quirk, Yoichi, in its current fully developed state, I‚Äôll get to visit your little mindspace. I‚Äôm looking forward to catching up with you, you ungrateful‚Ä¶‚Äù 

(‚ÄúSHIT!‚Äù Yoichi shouts. ‚ÄúGET READY FOR AN ATT‚Ä¶‚Äù) 

They missed Mischief nodding slightly to Asa. Before All for One rose from his seat, Rabbit grabbed his hand. 

‚ÄúD...dad?‚Äù He asks, making All for One freeze. He looks at his son, as if him using the ‚Äòdad‚Äô word was a surprise. Mischief quickly swipes away the plates in front of All for One, while his attention is occupied. 

‚ÄúWh‚Ä¶‚Äù All for One tries to speak, but he is too late. 

‚ÄúUn...unconscious.‚Äù Asa says. All for One suddenly goes limp. His head lands on the table where his plates used to be, with enough strength to make the whole table shake. 

‚ÄúI think‚Ä¶‚Äù Mischief says in the resulting silence. ‚Äú... that you shouldn‚Äôt be here when he wakes up.‚Äù 

Lemillion, Detective Tsukauchi and the 26 dead heroes agree with her wholeheartedly. 

 

***

 

Kurogiri warps them back to the alley behind a cat cafe near the UA. 

‚ÄúHow did it go?‚Äù Eraserhead asks them, while handing the hard drive back to the warper. The black cloud promptly disappears. 

‚ÄúIf Lemillion ever breaks the law‚Ä¶‚Äù Tsukauchi announces. ‚Äú... even something minor, like loitering, I‚Äôm doing my absolute utmost to send him to Tartarus for life.‚Äù Eraserhead‚Äôs brow raises. ‚ÄúI cannot explain the reasons. But he earned it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd on your end?‚Äù Lemillion asks, ignoring Detective entirely. 

‚ÄúHe remembers being Shirakumo.‚Äù Eraserhead sighs. ‚ÄúJust considers himself to be Kurogiri. The rest of the League doesn‚Äôt know, and he refuses to use anything he learned in his past life against anyone from the UA. In Oboro‚Äôs memory, I believe.‚Äù 

There goes their hope to influence Kurogiri in any way. Welp. 

‚ÄúTime to return to normal work, then.‚Äù Lemillion summarizes. ‚ÄúNot a word to anyone about this outing, remember.‚Äù 

He had them promise that to him. He agrees with Legion that having All Might and All for One battle it out right now would have been the end of Japan.

Principal: Recovery Girl finished running DNA tests on every single UA student, comparing the samples taken with those of notable villains connected to All for One within the past twenty-five years. 

NapNeeded: Is it correct to assume that we won‚Äôt like the result?

Principal: Yes. 

NapNeeded: Oh joy. 

SpyingEye: How many?

Principal: Six hero course students, including two that perished during the Training Camp attack. 

SmallMight: GARAKI YOU BASTARD

AllRight: SIX?!

NapNeeded: Well, shit. 

Principal: Good news is that, once again, we‚Äôre probably overrepresented considering how we‚Äôre the apex of hero schools together with Shiketsu and the program typically resulting in powerful quirk-bearers. However I had to raise the estimated number of Garaki‚Äôs children.

Principal: It‚Äôs about two UA students per year, double it for Shiketsu and smaller hero schools, triple it for some odd villain or people who remained civilians. Six times twenty-two is‚Ä¶ a large number. 

Principal: The kids I found are from no less than three different fertility clinics opened between twenty-two and twenty years ago.

Principal: We must have missed the statistical anomaly of oddly many children from in-vitro joining the hero courses during the last few years. 

NapNeeded: Anyone I know?

Principal: Eijirou Kirishima and Koji Koda from your class are Gigantomachia's sons. Yui Kodai from class 1-B is Mr. Compress‚Äô daughter. 

NapNeeded: Are you serious?!

SmallMight: Makes sense. Honestly, if you exclude the moral factor, this is fascinating. 

Principal: Oh?

SmallMight: We never had a chance to assess the results of multiple-quirk bearers having children. I believe that my father thought that the children would be born crippled due to the strain of inheriting multiple quirks. Or quirkless, because their bodies would have shut down that part of themselves to avoid dying.

SmallMight: Instead Ejiro seems to have inherited a heavily mutated variant of Fierce Gains, Koda seems to possess some thematic mutation based on Mole and Dog quirks, while Gigantomachia's son from the League has a mutated variant of Charge quirk. This suggests that the quirks interfere with each other, causing heightened chance of mutation (instead of direct inheritance), but there is still only a single quirk. And a powerful one, in most cases. 

Principal: He risked having you while thinking that the quirks would kill you?

SmallMight: He could detect dormant quirks before their activation. If he found multiples, he would probably take them away. He missed me being a late-bloomer, so we can safely assume that the late-bloomers quirks are basically NOT there early on, and develop from scratch later.

SmallMight: As I said, fascinating. Not exactly useful for the investigation, but fascinating.  

SmallMight: What‚Äôs Yui Kodai‚Äôs quirk? It‚Äôs the only one I don‚Äôt know from the list. 

Principal: She can alter sizes of things she touches. 

SmallMight: Yeah, there is a thematic connection (at least, somewhat, Compress‚Äô quirk makes things ‚Äòsmaller‚Äô to a degree). Perhaps it‚Äôs not multiple quirks but the in vitro that heightens the chance of mutation as well, at least for sufficiently strong quirks? No, we would notice that already. So perhaps Garaki did some experimenting to make the quirks mutate in order to make the entire scheme less visible? And to not create straight copies of quirks already there?

SmallMight: Fascinating. 

SpyingEye: Now I‚Äôm really starting to see the familial similarities. 

SmallMight: sorry I just find quirks to be incredibly interesting

TinTinCan: I noticed. 

TinTinCan: I offered you an information exchange. You told me who creates noumus AND in exchange you told me a lot of enlightening things about my own quirk.

SmallMight: BECAUSE YOUR QUIRK IS SUPER-FASCINATING AND TALKING ABOUT IT IS MY PLEASURE

TinTinCan: Right.

SmallMight: So what are you planning to do now? 

Principal: This gives us a chance to catch Garaki, actually.

SmallMight: Oh

SmallMight: OH

SmallMight: This is brilliant. 

SmallMight: Power Loader and David Shield?

Principal: Yep. Gremlin too, if possible. 

SpyingEye: Ah, I understand now. 

SmallMight: Oh you brilliant, brilliant mouse-bear. 

AllRight: Can someone explain to me what are you talking about?

NapNeeded: same. 

Principal: These three clinics have to have some connection with Garaki. We know he is hiding behind secure internet connections, but they can‚Äôt be PERFECTLY secure (unless Gremlin or some other mad engineer set them up). 

Principal: If we storm all three of them at once (and do so quickly, quietly and decisively) with some appropriate electronic support, we should be able to trace the connection before Garaki severs it fully. 

Principal: Giving us the rough estimations of the location of the Garaki‚Äôs hideout.

SmallMight: And I just happen to have a highly competent strike team at the ready, with a warp quirk user that can allow us to assault the base immediately while preventing Overhaul from evacuating Garaki through his own warpgate. 

SpyingEye: Looks like we finally have the breakthrough we needed. 

SmallMight: Get Power Loader and David Shield to make Villain Network accounts, I‚Äôll connect them with Gremlin so that they can figure out the details. 

Principal: Great idea!

AllRight: I have a feeling that we‚Äôre going to regret letting them meet.

SmallMight: Ekhem.

WorldIsAStage: private chat? Huh

WorldIsAStage: WELL WHAT BROUGHT THAT UP MY DEAR LEGION

SmallMight: Did you ever have medical check-ups with Doctor Garaki?

WorldIsAStage: ‚Ä¶

WorldIsAStage: WAIT

WorldIsAStage: DOES THAT QUESTION MEAN

WorldIsAStage: THAT I HAVE A CHILD?!

SmallMight: AND PROBABLY A SMALL CLASSROOM OF THOSE

WorldIsAStage: WHAT

SmallMight: Nedzu estimated about 120 of Garaki‚Äôs children out there, and we‚Äôve already found one of the UA hero course students to be your daughter. 

SmallMight: SO I HOPE YOU STOLE A LOT OF MONEY RECENTLY BECAUSE THE CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENT IS GOING TO FUCKING RUIN YOU YOU CLOWNLORD

WorldIsAStage: OKAY STOP

WorldIsAStage: I‚ÄôM SERIOUSLY FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW

WorldIsAStage: PLEASE STOP KICKING ME WHERE IT HURTS FOR A SECOND

SmallMight: Fair, that DOES have to be a bit shocking so I guess I‚Äôll be nice for once.

WorldIsAStage: Yes.

WorldIsAStage: OMFG

WorldIsAStage: I HAVE CHILDREN

SmallMight: Why is that surprising?!

WorldIsAStage: Because I genuinely thought that Oji Harima‚Äôs bloodline will die out with me

SmallMight: ‚Ä¶ are you gay?

WorldIsAStage: -_- 

WorldIsAStage: As if that could stop me in this day and age from getting a descendant.

WorldIsAStage: I‚Äôm not going to let you read my medical history, but Garaki claimed that I‚Äôm not going to have children. Like, ever. Every other doctor I contacted agreed with him.

WorldIsAStage: HOW THE HELL DID HE MANAGE TO DO THAT

SmallMight: Absolutely no idea. 

WorldIsAStage: OMG

WorldIsAStage: Please tell me if you find even a single children of mine who is a potential thief 

WorldIsAStage: I‚ÄôM GOING TO ADOPT THEM OFFICIALLY AND INSTANTLY REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY ARE AND WHETHER I HAVE TO SNEAK THEM OUT OF TARTARUS PRISON

WorldIsAStage: AND THEN I‚ÄôM GOING TO CHERISH THEM LIKE A MIRACLE THEY ARE

WorldIsAStage: AND WE ARE GOING TO STEAL SO MANY VALUABLE THINGS TOGETHER

WorldIsAStage: IT WILL BE GLORIOUS

SmallMight: Actually‚Ä¶ I might have found one already?

WorldIsAStage: TELL ME IMMEDIATELY WHERE CAN I FIND THIS MARVELOUS MINI-ME

WorldIsAStage: THAT I WANT TO SHOWER WITH LOVE UNTIL MY DEATH OR LIFETIME INCARCERATION

SmallMight: Let‚Äôs just say that I‚Äôm going to be one of the two people who absolutely love Kurogiri‚Äôs choice of interns.

WorldIsAStage: Wait

WorldIsAStage: NON IS MY SON?!

SmallMight: YES ACCORDING TO THE DNA TESTS I HAD INCENSE RUN ON THE KUROGIRI‚ÄôS CLASSROOM

SmallMight: At least that‚Äôs the only other Garaki kid among them. 

WorldIsAStage: OMG

WorldIsAStage: OMG

WorldIsAStage: OMG

WorldIsAStage: His quirk makes him vanish just as mine makes things vanish

SmallMight: Yeah, a perceptive/thematic mutation. 

SmallMight: Have fun with that

WorldIsAStage: I‚ÄôM GOING TO HAVE ALL THE FUN WITH THAT

WorldIsAStage: MY LIFE IS COMPLETE

WorldIsAStage: PLEASE ASK KUROGIRI TO LET ME BORROW NON FOR JUST A SECOND WE‚ÄôRE STILL A WEEK AWAY FROM THE INTERNSHIPS AND I URGENTLY NEED TO HAVE HIM HERE

SmallMight: Fine, I can do that much, but I want to have you next to me if we manage to locate Garaki‚Äôs stronghold.

WorldIsAStage: ME AND THE LEVELLERS ARE AT YOUR SERVICE MY MOST GENEROUS LORD

Chapter Text

TinTinCan: Preparations on our side are complete. 

TinTinCan: We are starting the raid on the fertility clinics in twelve hours. 

TinTinCan: You need to attack immediately once we get you the coordinates.

SmallMight: I KNOW

SmallMight: I expect you to send heroes to the coordinates too, because we cannot be sure that this will not escalate into a regular battle. And if it's somewhere in a city, the last thing we want is to have noumus slip out. 

TinTinCan: We know. 

TinTinCan: So unless you want to get caught, you better do your best to leave the facility before we arrive. 

SmallMight: DAMN IT I KNOW MIRIO

SmallMight: STOP REMINDING OF THE ‚ÄòI‚ÄôM STILL GOING TO ARREST YOU‚Äô BIT EVERY TIME ITS EVEN REMOTELY IMPORTANT

SmallMight: Sheesh. 

TinTinCan: Well then.

TinTinCan: Good luck!

SmallMight: I‚Äôll do my best.

There are many heroes uniquely suited towards incapacitating enemies instantly - and safely. Some of them are capable of doing this to an entire crowd. Of course, doing that to an entire building - full with civilians that could or not be involved - was still a PR problem. 

 

Nedzu located three fertility clinics that took part in the program. First one was attacked by Edgeshot - the ninja hero flew through its corridors, incapacitating every member of its personnel with his super move. The second one had its fire alarm triggered remotely by Nedzu, allowing a handful of camouflage-oriented heroes to secretly enter it. The third one was enveloped with sleeping gas by one of the many UA-aligned heroes. 

 

Doctor Garaki failed to notice the infiltration before the heroes took control of the electronic systems of all three facilities. He severed the connection twenty seconds too late. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúI have the coordinates!‚Äù Legion shouts. The entirety of the League is in their villain outfits, gathered together in the training room of the League‚Äôs headquarters. 

 

This is no day for half-measures. This is war. And they are going to win it. 

 

The black mist envelops them all.

 

***

 

They emerge in the air above a hospital in the middle of some city. Jaku General Hospital, according to the letters on one of the buildings they can see. 

 

Sunset floats them around on a handful of large surfaces. 

 

‚ÄúSomething interferes with my warp quirk.‚Äù Kurogiri says. It‚Äôs certainly not Sunset, not with the support items. It looks like they are in the right place. And perhaps they caught Overhaul‚Äôs warp quirk user as well?

 

‚ÄúGremlin, scan it.‚Äù Legion orders. Gremlin has Gadget produce some odd-looking machine. Izuku wants to know nothing about how it works, but less than twenty seconds later his visor displays a three-dimensional map of the facility. Including the small red dots signifying life signs. 

 

He can see a large underground space that most certainly shouldn‚Äôt be there. And that is only available through a single shaft, probably an elevator judging from the size. 

 

‚ÄúWe have him.‚Äù Legion announces. ‚ÄúDabi, flare it up. We‚Äôre coming in hot.‚Äù The flame user laughs like a psychopathic madman. 

 

The blue fire rains on the hospital, while the League of Villains flies inside on Sunset‚Äôs surface. Fire alarms ring throughout the building, with orderlies moving in to evacuate the patients. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúShitshitshishitshitshit!!!‚Äù Garaki screams in his underground lab. Legion found him! How did that unruly and deceitful pretendent find him?! He had to work with the heroes! There is no other explanation to this attack happening right after heroes raided his clinics! 

 

Did the personnel have time to purge the records? If the heroes can find those‚Ä¶ his entire Third Gen Noumus program is endangered! 

 

NO NO NO NO NO NO!!!

 

‚ÄúNINE, STOP THEM!!!‚Äù He shouts through the microphone. He needs time to flee from the facility, especially now that Kurogiri is here, blocking his warp. ‚ÄúTHEY ARE HEADING TOWARDS THE MORGUE, STOP THEM NOW!!!‚Äù 

 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm on it.‚Äù He hears from the speakers. 

 

He told Nine everything he knew about the League‚Äôs members. Nine is powerful. This should be enough. 

 

Doctor Garaki needs to download all the data down to a portable form and run away while Nine is distracting Legion.

 

***

 

The first of the Nine crew‚Äôs members to die is Romero Fujimi. Former star student of Isamu Academy, on the fast track to becoming a hero. Unfortunately, the world isn‚Äôt welcoming towards people with quirks perceived as villainous. All you need is one mistake - such as accidentally dispersing a zombie gas in a crowded mall during the internship, and your dream of heroics is dead. 

 

He found a new one. 

 

He dispersed his gas when he heard of Nine‚Äôs announcement, enveloping nearby patients and hospital staff. They began their rampage, and he pushed them towards the incoming attack group. 

 

In Romero‚Äôs defense, he didn‚Äôt know about the enemy's ability to track all life-signs within the hospital. Legion found the single dot that didn‚Äôt move (despite being within a crowd of dots moving together as a group towards the attackers) suspicious. 

 

Zombie gas user was never the most attentive to details. He noticed Spinner only when the lizard man's gun barrel touched his head. A single pull of a trigger later, Romero‚Äôs brain was splattered on the nearby wall, and his zombie crowd fell to the ground. 

 

***

 

The second member of the Nine‚Äôs crew to die was Chimera. His death was mostly due to bad positioning - Nine and his teammates were scattered around the hospital (though most of them, save for Romero, relatively close to the morgue entrance, in the more restricted part of the hospital).

It also wasn‚Äôt his preferred combat environment. He couldn‚Äôt bulk to his full potential strength, as he would simply fail to move - the corridors were only SO big. And he couldn‚Äôt take the whole building down, since that would simply trap Doctor Garaki under the rubble. To be dug out by the heroes at their convenience. 

 

When he saw the League members emerge from behind the corner, he charged towards them. His job was to slow them down, and this was the perfect situation - all he needed to was to gain enough momentum to ram into them and keep them there while Nine and the others were on their way. 

 

The first ones to come were an unfamiliar bulky young man with a square jaw and Stain. The latter could be a problem with his quirk, but nothing that Chimera couldn‚Äôt barge throug‚Ä¶ 

 

...except when he rushed into them, he felt like he hit a brick wall. His fist hit Stain right in the face (the man didn‚Äôt even bother to dodge) and he just no-selled it. Like it didn‚Äôt happen. 

 

‚ÄúWHAT THE HELL?!‚Äù Chimera screams. Stain licks blood from his knife (Chimera didn‚Äôt even notice the cut) and the villain slumps down, paralyzed. 

 

‚ÄúShock Nullification quirk.‚Äù Stain replies, with a maniacal grin on his face. His entire body suddenly bulks up, as if there was also some strength enhancement quirk thrown in the mix. ‚ÄúGift from a nephew.‚Äù 

 

Then he decapitates Chimera with his katana. 

 

***

 

Only Nine, Mummy and Slice manage to gather in the morgue. 

 

‚ÄúWhat happened to Chimera?‚Äù Slice asks. She is, like them all, not in the best location to use her quirk. Their quirks make them capable of decimating entire groups of heroes, but tend to excel on the open air battle.

 

‚ÄúDead.‚Äù Nine replies. ‚ÄúRomero too.‚Äù 

 

His crew is a family. They are close to each other. He can feel pain in their eyes. They will mourn for their fallen later on. 

 

Nine should have never agreed to Garaki‚Äôs offer. Healing his disease wasn‚Äôt worth going to bed with people like the ones that the Paranormal Liberation Front had in their ranks. But it was too late. Now he was here, and he was losing his friends one by one. 

 

‚ÄúGet ready.‚Äù Nine says. The doors to the morgue burst open. League members leap into the room. 

 

Nine‚Äôs little family does its best. But in such a restricted space, their large-scale quirks are more of a problem than an asset. What‚Äôs more, their knowledge about their enemy is painfully outdated and they are outnumbered. They die one by one. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúOVERHAUL!!!‚Äù Garaki screams at him through the videocommunicator. ‚ÄúYOU GOT TO HELP ME, LEGION IS HERE!!! HE IS TEARING THROUGH MY BODYGUARDS AND I CAN‚ÄôT HAVE JOHNNY WARP ME OUT!!!‚Äù 

 

Overhaul sighs slightly. Just what he expected from his quote unquote ally. Izuku and the heroes has probably found him through his idiotic eugenics program. This was just a matter of time. All it took was a single father to doubt being a parent of their child and do a DNA test, and suddenly everything was on the verge of coming down. 

 

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù Overhaul replies. ‚ÄúWell, good luck with that.‚Äù 

 

Garaki freezes. 

 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù He finally manages to utter, after a few long seconds of silence. 

 

‚ÄúYou outlived your usefulness.‚Äù Overhaul informs him. ‚ÄúI could save you, but‚Ä¶ why? Uuugh.‚Äù His lungs were getting worse and worse as time passed. Well, he wasn‚Äôt going to need those for long. ‚ÄúYour noumus are interesting, but I now know everything about them. Uuugh. Found your lab a while ago and had my technopath download your entire database. And you donated all finished nomus to the PLF, save for some half-finished ones you keep in your hospital. So, good luck.‚Äù 

 

‚ÄúYou traitor!‚Äù Garaki shouts. Overhaul asks himself if someone who backstabbed Legion like that has a moral ground to accuse others of being traitors. Then again, not like he cares. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to tell the heroes everything I know, they‚Äôll find you and‚Ä¶‚Äù 

 

‚ÄúFirst of all, Izuku is going to torture you to death instead of handing you to the heroes.‚Äù Overhaul replies. ‚ÄúAnd I took the liberty of giving you false info about my real base. Did you ever ask yourself how, uuugh,  exactly did Eclipse warp in recruits from outside of Japan?‚Äù 

 

‚ÄúW...what?‚Äù Garaki seems to not understand what it is about. 

 

‚ÄúThe main PLF forces‚Ä¶ including thousands of quirkless soldiers‚Ä¶ more then a hundred of my Purified‚Ä¶ uuuugh‚Ä¶ and the majority of your noumus, including all third gen‚Ä¶. aren‚Äôt even in Japan.‚Äù Overhaul says with a faint smile hidden behind his gasmask. ‚ÄúSo feel free to scream what you know to Izuku while he tortures you to death.‚Äù Overhaul laughs lightly as he severs the connection. 

 

He is sitting on a sunbed on a tropical beach. He sees a group of former QLF soldiers sunbathing thirty meters away from him (they finished their combat training for today, and he is letting them do that - they are healthy and pure, after all). 

 

The sunlight is good for his skin, and there are only a handful of truly diseased people on the island. If his borrowed body wasn‚Äôt failing him so badly, he would actually genuinely enjoy the vacations. 

 

While heroes were pursuing his useless allies and small groups of brainwashed QLF soldiers that he was spreading throughout Japan (while making them appear as his actual army), he was slowly building up his forces in safety. His army was almost ready for the next step of his plan. 

 

Japan‚Äôs remaining lifespan was counted in weeks now. 

 

***

 

Doctor Garaki was still staring at the now empty screen when Legion disassembled the armored doors to his lab. His followers emerged from the darkness behind him. Garaki recognizes Stain, Kurogiri and Mr. Compress standing right behind Izuku. And more and more behind them.

 

‚ÄúDoctor Garaki.‚Äù Legion is still wearing his ridiculous All Might hoodie. As if to add insult to injury. ‚ÄúI told you that this day would come.‚Äù 

 

He has enough time to start screaming before the pain began.

 

***

Mr. Principal: I‚Äôd like to announce a major victory in our war.

Ms. Eraserhead: Oh?

Mr. Principal: We‚Äôve managed to locate Doctor Garaki. Legion eliminated him, while killing and resurrecting Nine and his crew members (four notable A-Rank villains: Necromancer, Chimera, Slice and Mummy), whom we now successfully apprehended. They are on the way to Tartarus as we speak. 

ICastFist: So we‚Äôve eliminated the noumus from the equation? And why did LEGION of all people do that? 

Mr. Principal: He is the only one among the alliance members to have access to warp quirks. We had heroes (including @Rasengan and yours truly) attack three fertility clinics connected to Garaki and trace the connection to him before he managed to sever them. 

Mr. Principal: The second phase of the plan was the League assaulting Garaki‚Äôs location before he escapes, while using Kurogiri to interfere with the warp, preventing Overhaul‚Äôs warper from bringing in reinforcements. 

AngryRabbit: Let me guess, Jaku General Hospital?

Mr. Principal: Blue flames like that are a bit of a giveaway, yes. 

Mr. Principal: Dabi had enough control over them to not burn patients to death (that OR the hospital staff was fast enough with their evacuation, I‚Äôm not betting on that). 

Mr. Principal: Still, we‚Äôve managed to eliminate one SSS-Rank and one SS-Rank villain, while also capturing the main Noumu production and research facility. 

Rasengan: This didn‚Äôt come up earlier, but do I even want to know why Garaki was connected with fertility clinics? 

Mr. Principal: You probably don‚Äôt. But I‚Äôm willing to share it with the rest of this alliance, although it‚Äôs something that cannot leave this chat. 

FashionablyLate: Lies and omissions are what started this chaos. I‚Äôm in for honesty. We‚Äôre all heroes or former heroes. Best of the best, to be included in this council. 

ICastFist: I agree.

Rasengan: Same.

Ms. Eraserhead. Yes.

Mr. Principal: Someone disagrees? 

Mr. Principal: Very well.

Mr. Principal: League of Villains managed to find evidence for Doctor Garaki leading a 20+ years old eugenics program during which he impregnated random women throughout the country with offspring of various supervillains through in-vitro fertilization. We estimate that no less than 100 children of people like Gigantomachia, Mr. Compress, Eclipse, Purity, Re-Destro and even All for One were born as a result of this program. 

ICastFist: This is fucked up. 

AngryRabbit: Extremely. 

Mr. Principal: We have six such children in the present UA heroics course alone. League has three more in their midst. 

Mr. Principal: This information cannot leave this chat. If it does it will ruin lives of people who do not deserve that. 

FashionablyLate: Understandable. Those children are victims, but the society would never understand it. How many aspiring young heroes would be branded as children of monsters that they never even met? 

FashionablyLate: And don‚Äôt have me start on how much we would complicate their family life. 

Mr. Principal: Which is why the official version will be that Garaki used those fertility clinics to obtain medical resources and crucial data about quirk genetics and so on. 

Mr. Principal: I expect everyone involved to stick to it. 

Mr. Principal: I‚Äôll also personally (well, with Sir Nighteye‚Äôs help, he is already busy doing that and that‚Äôs why he is staying quiet) shift through the recovered data. We‚Äôll find every single child in question. 

Mr. Principal: For now we used the fact that Garaki needs to have some connection to those hospitals to trace his hideout and send League of Villains after him. They were kind enough to leave the entire facility to us, while taking only Garaki himself. 

Mr. Principal: This is a treasure trove of scientific knowledge, that I believe we‚Äôll have a special group from the I-Island analyze. 

Mr. Principal: However there is a problem. 

SuperPunch: Problem?

Mr. Principal: We found twenty-three noumus, most of them unfinished (the only exceptions are two small ones, one of which seems to have possessed a warp quirk). We don‚Äôt know what happened to the remaining ~one hundred. 

Mr. Principal: We also believe that Garaki started to purge data, starting from the most important (League interrupted that, but not before most of it was gone). 

Mr. Principal: @DeadpanStalker do you want to add something? 

DeadpanStalker: I found references to something called the ‚ÄòThird Gen Noumu‚Äô in the files. All I know is that they weren‚Äôt kept in Garaki‚Äôs lab, and they were a relatively recent development. 

AngryRabbit: Shit. 

ICastFist: Something completely new? 

DeadpanStalker: Probably. But if so, then Overhaul now has them. And we still can‚Äôt find him. 

Mr. Principal: Which doesn‚Äôt change the fact that we dismantled the one and only noumu production facility. The amount of resources we just shaved off the PLF is astounding. This isn‚Äôt a lethal blow by any means, but we‚Äôve weakened the enemy massively nonetheless.

Mr. Principal: Now we have to consider our next move carefully. 

 

***

‚ÄúYOU BASTARD!!!‚Äù Garaki shouts. He is furious, despite the past treatment. He knows he lost everything, but he is still fairly cheeky. ‚ÄúYOU ARE A DISGRACE, A DISGRACE!!!‚Äù His legs are broken (and so are his fingers).

 

Stain was quite rough, and followed Izuku‚Äôs orders to make sure that Doctor cannot move to the letter. He also broke his fingers in case the good doctor tried something funny. There were way too many almost-finished noumus in the lab for them to be in the mood for risk taking.

 

‚ÄúSo, you didn‚Äôt believe me.‚Äù Izuku comments. It was perhaps to be expected. If the Doctor truly believed Legion‚Äôs words about his father being alive, he would immediately kowtow and beg for forgiveness.

 

Well, too late for that now.

 

They are in the training room of the base. Izuku, Doctor and the silent Kurogiri behind Izuku. The rest are either still celebrating the victorious battle, or went to sleep already. They know that they shouldn‚Äôt show up anywhere near the training room until he returns to them. 

 

The room is insulated. Not exactly soundproof. But perfect for what Izuku is planning for tonight. 

 

‚ÄúOf course not.‚Äù Doctor calms just a bit. But his face is as hateful as it was. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt even kill Nine and his crew. You are a disgrace. Vigilante pretending to be a villain. All for One would never choose someone like you.‚Äù 

 

‚ÄúI killed Nine and his crew.‚Äù Izuku replies calmly. ‚ÄúI resurrected them because I empathize with their stories. Not with their goals. I have issues with anyone who develops a ‚Äòmight makes right‚Äô mentality, especially when quirks are involved. But they are a family, like the League. I didn‚Äôt hate them enough to kill them. Only enough to have them spend the rest of their life in a maximum security prison. But you?‚Äù He chuckles slightly. ‚ÄúYou I hate. Not as much as Overhaul, but still a lot.‚Äù 

 

‚ÄúAnd what are you planning to do with that, huh?‚Äù Garaki seems to hate him more than he is afraid of him. A spectacular achievement, all things considered. 

 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to give you the most painful death I can think of, of course.‚Äù Izuku announces with a straight face. ‚ÄúYou betrayed me. You sided with Overhaul, the monster that tortured my sister. You acted against the will of my father.‚Äù Something nasty flinches on Garaki‚Äôs face. 

 

‚ÄúHE IS NO FATHER OF YOURS, TRAITOR!‚Äù Doctor shouts back. He has no idea that he is just digging his grave deeper. 

 

‚ÄúSo you didn‚Äôt check what I told you about?‚Äù Izuku is, frankly speaking, shocked by that little fact. ‚ÄúOh, well. No matter. Kurogiri.‚Äù He looks towards his favourite uncle. ‚ÄúBring him here.‚Äù 

 

Twenty seconds later Kurogiri returns. The towering figure emerges from the black cloud. 

 

‚ÄúAre ‚Äòya winning, son?‚Äù All for One says in a calm, conversational tone. ‚ÄúLooks so to me, at least. .‚Äù 

 

Garaki shrinks. There is a look on his face, the look of indescribable emotional torture and mental breakdown. He dedicated his entire life to All for One - the one and only man who believed in his theories and helped him hone his life‚Äôs work. Who supported him for close to a century. 

 

The very same All for One that he just realized that he has betrayed. 

 

‚ÄúYes, dad.‚Äù Izuku replies. Something deep inside him - something that his father managed to plant in him, but has never made it grow - stirs. The very thought of Doctor Garaki consorting with that monster‚Ä¶ planning to take away Eri and hurt her again‚Ä¶ planning to destroy both families that Izuku has‚Ä¶ He WANTS him to suffer. And he enjoys seeing him like that. 

 

Doctor is clearly too out of it. Izuku grabs his head and rams it into the floor. Then he pulls it up, Garaki‚Äôs eyes finally focusing on him.

 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll tell me everything you know about the PLF.‚Äù Izuku tells Doctor Garaki, with a smile on his face. Smile that he will never ever show to anyone who isn‚Äôt a person like Garaki. Overhaul saw it. Thunderbolt died too quickly to see it. But Garaki sees it just fine. All for One knows it well, for it‚Äôs identical to his own. ‚ÄúAnd then I‚Äôll steal your quirk. Me. Not my father. I won‚Äôt even torture you after that. I‚Äôll have Kurogiri warp you to some uninhabited island. I wonder how long you will survive there in your one hundred twenty year old body.‚Äù 

 

He doesn‚Äôt get to see the fatherly pride on All for One‚Äôs face. 

 

***

 

SmallMight: I have some additional, very messed up news.

SmallMight: I‚Äôll risk using such words in front of my idol, and I‚Äôll say that they are fucked up actually. 

Principal: Garaki?

SmallMight: Yes. 

SmallMight: I know what the Third Gen Noumus are. 

TinTinCan: ???

NapNeeded: Ugh.

SpyingEye: ???

SmallMight: Garaki learned from Overhaul‚Äôs research data that the quirk factor of children is more‚Ä¶ malleable, and more likely to survive sudden changes. Such as additional quirk implantation. 

NapNeeded: No. Fuck. No. 

TinTinCan: Shit. 

SmallMight: He started picking up children from his eugenics program. 8-16 years old. Those from less-notable families, or small-time villains. Carrying powerful quirks or at least quirk factors. And he put them through a variant of noumufication surgeries and implanted with several quirks. 

SmallMight: No exposed brains. No telling signs of them being noumus. Just pure power and deep brainwashing. He finished nine of those, each carrying five quirks with a ‚Äòperfect synergy‚Äô with each other. Mini-Gigantomachias, in short. 

SmallMight: Overhaul has them all. And is supposedly hiding outside of Japan with the majority of his forces, due to Eclipse‚Äôs quirk that he implanted to one of his lieutenants having international range.

SmallMight: He apparently laughed and severed the connection when Garaki asked him to come save him. He was no longer needed. 

AllRight: Jesus Christ

SmallMight: And Overhaul has some special project of his own, or two to be precise. One is his new body, created through the peak achievements of Garaki and Overhaul, but it apparently will take weeks to finish it. 

SmallMight: Second is his ‚ÄòPurified‚Äô. Garaki had no idea what those are, but after seeing third gen noumu field-testing Overhaul commented that their ‚Äòpet projects appear to be equally useful‚Äô. So we can expect something approaching the third gen noumus in strength, but probably more numerous and still in production.

SmallMight: Everything we were facing thus far is Overhaul buying time until he amasses enough soldiers, Purified and noumus to take the entire hero society down. CRC, ISP, House of Red, Garaki - all of those are distractions. 

SmallMight: I regret to inform you all, gentlemen, that Overhaul might have us all in check. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúGaraki and Nine have been taken down.‚Äù One of her advisors announced. ‚ÄúNedzu just dealt a crippling blow to the Paranormal Liberation Front. Without their noumu production facility, the PLF‚Äôs strength has been practically halved.‚Äù 

 

‚ÄúThis is the time for us to make a major move against the Meta-Liberation Army.‚Äù The president of the Hero Public Safety Commission announces. ‚ÄúWe need to show to the public that despite the accusations, we are still standing strong. We‚Äôll start by making serious moves against the potential traitors in our ranks.‚Äù 

 

MLA espoused strength before all others. Freedom to be yourself, to use your quirks however you saw fit. Strength and freedom to use quirks? Complex mutants and villainous quirk bearers were the most likely candidates for the moles and MLA supporters. 

 

It was time to clean up the house.
Notes:

    ... you didn't think that I would miss the occasion to let the Murder Bunny(tm) go on a rampage, right?

    [Also Izuku is a good boyfriend, he promised Himiko an occasion to stab Garaki once or twice, so he was probably stabbed a few times before having his injuries reset and then being dropped on that island]

    As for the TV Tropes page:

    1. Beast isn't a canon character :P So he can't be in a 'fan-originated offspring of a canon character' category.
    2. While Tomura probably played Mortal Kombat, I don't exactly remember ever mentioning that unless I forgot that??? It's possible though.
    3. Shout-out category misses two to F.E.A.R franchise. The first line of the reporter reporting the events in Hosu is taken practically verbatim from the ending helicopter scene of the first installment. Tomura's 'they deserve to die, they all deserve to die' line in a chatroom around the time when Vanguard Action Squad is created is also a quote from Paxton Fettel, one of the series main antagonists.
    4. Foreshadowing misses a very big one. When Izuku reacts to Gran Torino's review of the League, he mentions that he can't do a lot about being irreplacable because it's not like there is a villainous masterminds school out there and he can't have his mother adopt one of its students. Cue Rabbit.

    That's probably all. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. Also OMFG I HAVE A TV TROPES PAGE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Chapter 50: Peace
Summary:

    People begin to realize what the next chapter is going to be about.

Notes:

    A bit early, yes, it's not Friday everywhere, but I'm currently riding an emotional high following the medical examination that confirmed the fact that I DO NOT have cancer. So yeah. Grab the chapter and celebrate with me :D

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

HaremMistress: So, uhm

HaremMistress: @DevotedSlave I was a bit afraid to mention the development here, but

HaremMistress: BabyFactory did marry Izuku so that just leaves you out and‚Ä¶

DevotedSlave: It‚Äôs alright.

HaremMistress: Are you sure? I don‚Äôt want you to feel bad about it

DevotedSlave: Listen

DevotedSlave: @HaremMistress @BabyFactory I‚Äôll ask you both

DevotedSlave: How exactly are you different from Rabbit?

HaremMistress: What?

BabyFactory: Do you want me to list biological differences between the genders?

BabyFactory: I always learn the theories behind my babies before I start the assembly!

DevotedSlave: Sigh

DevotedSlave: He has his surname, like you do

DevotedSlave: Izuku appears to have a compulsive need to hug him or pet his head whenever possible. Like he occasionally does with you (and you do with him).

DevotedSlave: I‚Äôm like 50% sure that at some point Rabbit sneaked into Izuku‚Äôs bed (probably when he felt bad or had a nightmare or something) for comfort. So like you, but rarer AND WITH AN ACTUAL AGENDA.

DevotedSlave: There is zero sex involved. Like with you.

DevotedSlave: Are you actually sure that you are married rather than adopted? 

HaremMistress: STOP BRINGING UP THE S-WORD

DevotedSlave: IT‚ÄôS SEX

HaremMistress: STOP

DevotedSlave: AT LEAST WRITE IT DOWN IN A CHAT IF YOU CAN‚ÄôT SAY IT ALOUD

HaremMistress: I SAID STOP 

HaremMistress: I‚ÄôM TRYING

HaremMistress: MY IMAGINATION IS KILLING ME AND IZUKU ISN‚ÄôT MAKING THE FIRST MOVE

HaremMistress: I‚ÄôD GO ALONG IF HE DID BUT I CAN‚ÄôT IMAGINE LIKE STARTING IT

BabyFactory: odd

DevotedSlave: Why?

BabyFactory: That‚Äôs like the reverse mechanic of their relationship. Normally Himiko was knocked out because of Izuku making a move, while being super-bold with her own moves.

BabyFactory: Hence, odd.

DevotedSlave: Well, this time it‚Äôs about getting knocked up rather than knocked out soooo‚Ä¶

HaremMistress: STOP SAYING WORDS LIKE THESE PLEASE

DevotedSlave: YOU KNOW I‚ÄôM RIGHT

DevotedSlave: Just tell him that you have a present for him in your room, wait until he gets there wearing something easy to take off, then take it off suddenly and say that the present is yourself and done.

DevotedSlave: Why is she so silent?

HaremMistress: STOP CORRUPTING HIMIKO BLUEBERRY

DevotedSlave: Oh shit Izu

HaremMistress: She literally fainted on me, damnit.

HaremMistres: Checked her phone and of course that‚Äôs your fault

BabyFactory: Can she still corrupt me?
HaremMistress: No. 

BabyFactory: :( 

DevotedSlave: I‚ÄôM TRYING TO HELP YOU

HaremMistress: PLEASE STOP HELPING

DevotedSlave: PLEASE STOP RESISTING

‚ÄúCould you please repeat what you just said?‚Äù Nedzu says into his phone. His brain, currently just a bit tired from almost two days of trying to figure out how to react to the latest revelations about the PLF, simply refused to compute. 

‚ÄúThe President thinks that with the PLF weakened, the Commission needs to make a major move against the MLA.‚Äù His informant within the HPSC says. He is away from home and work, and is using a burner phone. Their work relationship is a long one. ‚ÄúShe wants to ‚Äòclean up the house‚Äô first. There is a new bill in the works, something to restrict complex mutants and villainous quirk users access to heroics. And some‚Ä¶ loyalty tests for those already there.‚Äù 

Ohnonononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononoonono‚Ä¶

The Commission thinks that the PLF had its strength halved, because Nedzu didn‚Äôt share the newest revelations (that they have no proof for except for Legion‚Äôs words). And if he did it now, the president would simply think that he is conjuring believable lies to help the complex mutants and the villainous quirk users among the herois business. 

And if Legion is correct about the situation within the Table of Rejects‚Ä¶ worst of all, he probably is. Nedzu and Sir Nighteye did their own probing. They didn‚Äôt like the result. 

He is going to need a lot of tea to deal with it.

FashionStatement: Is someone willing to finally explain to me why we were asked to urgently create accounts in this incredibly unfashionable place?

IsOnMe: Yes.

NapNeeded: I‚Äôm more surprised that you didn‚Äôt have one already, @IsOnMe  

IsOnMe: Maybe I have another one? :P 

COOLMAN: YEAH I DON‚ÄôT THINK THAT IT IS A VERY COOL PLACE TO BE IN

 

[[Vantablack [S-Rank] joins the chat with default nickname of Vantablack]]

 

Principal: This is now officially the UA-Alliance Emergency Management Chat. 

SmallMight: More like Crisis Management (also I‚Äôm Legion, nice to meet you in person). Emergency is too weak of a word to describe this mess. 

COOLMAN: YOUR NICKNAME IS QUITE COOL

SmallMight: Well thank you! You‚Äôre cool too, the way you took down the Dictator was just super awesome :D 

COOLMAN: THANK YOU VERY MUCH

IsOnMe: Okaaay? What crisis is this and why am I not seeing Miruko, Gang Orca and Knuckleduster here? 

Principal: Because the crisis in question is those three preparing a coup d‚Äôetat against the government and the Hero Commission.

IsOnMe: WHAT

FashionStatement: ‚Ä¶ Is this a form of a joke?

Ninja: I sure hope so. 

Principal: We know about this ever since the Legion‚Äôs return. Lemillion got suspicious about Mirko and Knuckleduster getting so much along and being united in hatred against the Commission. Legion was in a position to launch an investigation into his allies because of being, well, a villain. 

Principal: He and Vantablack found people connected to the Table of Rejects and the Vigilante Alliance organizing safehouses near major Commission offices and hero agencies of Commission-aligned heroes, gathering medical supplies, support items and weapons, and buying quirk analysis of Commission heroes on the black market. 

Principal: Me and Sir Nighteye have confirmed those findings. 

FashionStatement: But, why?! I understand they have reasons to dislike the Commission (the president should burn like subpar quality denim for how she is treating them), but a COUP?!

SmallMight: I‚Äôm more curious about the reasons for Nedzu inviting everyone right now though. 

Principal: We‚Äôll move over to this in a while.

Principal: Are @SmallMight or @Vantablack ready to answer FashionStatement‚Äôs question first?

Vantablack: That‚Äôs because by the Table standards Miruko is a barely tolerated moderate.

IsOnMe: She is WHAT?

Vantablack: The Table of Rejects long ago stopped making their anger public, because the Commission ‚Äòmedia lynches‚Äô made it obvious that any attempt to voice their disapproval will just make them more branded. 

Vantablack: But the rage is still there. And it's steadily getting worse, as the Commission used them as a media punching bag slash scapegoats (whenever a hero team-up messed something up, it was 100% sure that members of one the group represented by the Table will be blamed by the media). 

Vantablack: Miruko is one of the few Table members who still think that coup should be preferably avoided because it will probably make things worse. Gang Orca is from the group that thinks that without a coup, no one will bother listening to the Table. And Shishido is from the group that wants to slaughter as many Hero Commission lackeys as possible.

SmallMight: The general division is like 20:60:20 for those three approaches, if I remember right?

Vantablack: Yeah, but it seems to have a clear tendency to drift right as time passes. People are radicalizing, which is bad when they are already extremely radical. 

IsOnMe: Why wasn‚Äôt I told earlier?! 

Principal: I apologize for that. However Legion pointed out the Underground Network has a large representation of the two main groups belonging to the Table. 

IsOnMe: I was‚Ä¶ LOYALTY-TESTED? 

NapNeeded: Not my idea.

SmallMight: And you passed.

SmallMight: Close to half of the Network didn‚Äôt. 

IsOnMe: WHAT

SmallMight: We estimate (but it‚Äôs at least partially based on Table‚Äôs estimates) that about half of the underground heroes will side with the coup. And I don‚Äôt expect the remaining ones to feel like fighting for the Commission. 

IsOnMe: SHIT. 

IsOnMe: Considering the general opinion about the Commission among the underground heroes, I have to agree with this assessment. 

SmallMight: Now my question. What brought this up, Nedzu?

Principal: Discovery that the HPSC wants to push a bill through the Diet that will establish a register of villainous quirks and complex mutant quirk users throughout the country, and put severe limitations on their ability to become heroes. Plus mandatory loyalty tests for those already in the business.

SmallMight: Jesus fucking Christ

AllRight: Is the president insane?! 

TinTinCan: ^

SmallMight: Probably not officially, by the virtue of being too dangerous and powerful for any psychologist to be willing to tell her that she needs therapy. 

IsOnMe: oh fuck no, this is literally the worst thing to do rn

Ninja: She most certainly is insane. This is complete and utter madness. Even without the PLF and MLA looming over us, that would still be a suicide. And that‚Äôs without mentioning how EVIL and WRONG that is.

FashionStatement: The Table will start a coup over this. 

Vantablack: The lack of question mark makes it obvious that you DO understand the situation.

Vantablack: Yes. Yes it will. And if Miruko will try to stop it, Shishido and Gang Orca will simply depose her and launch the coup on their own. And if they by some unexpected coincidence refuse to depose her, the lower ranked members of the Table will depose them all and start a coup on their own. 

SmallMight: Time estimates?

Vantablack: Depends on how quickly the news will spread. If it's the Commission's public stunt, they will probably announce it soon. Then anywhere between 24 to 72h for the last, rushed preparations. 

Vantablack: They appear to be mostly ready. They just need to gather their forces and explain the plan to them. 

FashionStatement: This is probably not a very fashionable statement from my side, but.. considering the treatment that complex mutants and villainous quirk users have to endure, I‚Äôm not sure if I feel like risking the life of myself and my sidekicks to save the Commission. 

Ninja: Same. President is de facto a supervillain, saved from this designation by being part of the government and ruling over the organization that decides who is and who isn‚Äôt a villain. Who is going to announce themselves as a supervillain in such a situation?

SmallMight: hey don‚Äôt lump me and Vantablack with her, even us supervillains don‚Äôt want to have anything to do with her >_< that woman is n a s t y

AllRight: I agree with Rasengan and FashionStatement. 

AllRight: The HPSC president is the true villain in this. I‚Äôm not going to use the remnants of One for All to beat people who demand equality and to be treated like quote unquote normal people. It‚Äôd be borderline blasphemy considering this quirk‚Äôs history. 

SpyingEye: I would prefer to not back the HPSC in this either. 

Principal: I believe that the UA as a faction should stay out of this and remain neutral as a whole (with exception of those heroes who decide to follow their conscience). However this will be a problem if the legally elected government asks us to intervene. Because we can‚Äôt exactly refuse that. 

Ninja: Doesn‚Äôt this mean that the coup will certainly fail?

TinTinCan: I believe it will go off like the October Revolution. 

SmallMight: Read deeper into the pre-quirk history?

TinTinCan: Decided to deepen my understanding of villains and heroes by learning what those terms meant before the quirks.

SmallMight: Plus Ultra, ehh? 

TinTinCan: always!

NapNeeded: Elaborate please?

TinTinCan: Coup d‚Äôetat in Russia, long ago. The group responsible for it was extremely unpopular, to the point where less than 5% of the garrison and police in the capital supported it. But it succeeded, because less than 2.5% of them liked the previous government enough to fight in its defense. The rest decided to go home, went to loot the capital or ignored the coup entirely.

SpyingEye: Ah. What @FashionStatement said. Majority of heroes will act the same.

TinTinCan: Yes. The Table and Alliance has low numbers. But they only need to take down the Commission heroes, because not only the UA heroes but also the majority of the independents will refuse to bleed for the HPSC. 

TinTinCan: Like during that revolution, the majority of those supposed to resist it will stay at home, or refuse to fight. 

Principal: The president of the HPSC lives in a bubble. She is surrounded by advisors whose work at least partially depends on telling her what she wants to hear. She knows of the events, but probably doesn't know how much Hosu weakened her popularity even among the heroes supposedly loyal to the Commission. And the new initiative will only make it worse, at least among the decent heroes. So a majority of them.

SpyingEye: All she sees are the general popularity rankings. And she hopes to improve those by heavy-handed measures.

TinTinCan: yes

TinTinCan: if Miruko plays it out correctly, she can win. 

SmallMight: Should she win, then?

TinTinCan: What?

SmallMight: This is a crisis management chat.

SmallMight: We‚Äôre supposed to manage this crisis. 

SmallMight: We need to preserve as much firepower as we can to keep Re-Destro and Overhaul at bay after this mess is over. 

SmallMight: I don‚Äôt think that we can somehow stop the coup from happening at this point. Not with how livid the Table members are and with the HPSC not likely to listen to us.

SmallMight: Will Miruko‚Äôs victory help in stopping PLF, if we make it clear and overwhelming? 

SmallMight: Because sorry, but I‚Äôm not going to stand by quietly if you decide to warn the president about what‚Äôs coming.

SmallMight: I have standards.

Principal: Heroes can‚Äôt help, because it would weaken the image of heroics further. But you‚Ä¶ you aren‚Äôt restricted by this.

SmallMight: yes. 

SmallMight: So, once again

SmallMight: do we want Miruko to win?

 

***

‚ÄúIs this‚Ä¶ confirmed?‚Äù Miruko asks. The rabbit woman is in her house, wearing her civilian clothes. She has no hero agency of her own. Eternal loner, who espouses her own strength. Then again, when you are THIS strong, you become an army on your own. 

The paper in her hands is the printout of the Commission‚Äôs soon-to-be bill. Together with an analysis of the chances of it passing through the Diet. Unfortunately, the analysis suggests that the HPSC will achieve its goal, although with minimal majority over the saner parliamentarians. And those who represent Nedzu more than they do their voters.  

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid that it is.‚Äù Legion replies. Exchange knew how to organize a meeting between them, besides it‚Äôs not like Miruko‚Äôs contact details were a state secret. They were ways of organizing a meeting when you really wanted to. And with Kurogiri warping his quirk-clone directly into her home, there was no one to witness the meeting between a hero and villain. ‚ÄúNedzu got it from his contact in the HPSC. Trusted contact. This will be publicized in a day or two.‚Äù 

It is perhaps unsurprising that she crushes the paper in her hands. Izuku should perhaps be happy that it‚Äôs the only thing that gets crushed. At least for now. HPSC‚Äô president should probably start wearing the toughest helmet she can find. 

‚ÄúWhy are you here?‚Äù Miruko is furious. She is, as it was stated, a loner. Her being the leader of the soon-to-be revolution has less to do with her trying to work with others than with others admiring her strength and brutal honesty. Gang Orca leads the organization. Miruko is its symbol - but an influential one. 

‚ÄúNedzu send me.‚Äù Izuku replies honestly, and Miruko seems to be briefly surprised. ‚ÄúUA cannot officially support a coup. And we both know that this bill will start one. Nedzu cannot intervene directly. Having All Might battle it out with other heroes, however unworthy they were, in the name of a coup would be a ruin of the country. But‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a villain.‚Äù He smiles faintly. He really would have preferred to meet one of his many idols (and his brother‚Äôs top one idol apparently) in different circumstances. First the literal war council, now this. ‚ÄúEven without fighting alongside you and Knuckleduster, I can at least triple your chances of victory.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNot gonna fight alongside us?‚Äù Miruko isn‚Äôt insulting his intelligence. She openly admits the coup is brewing. She knows it does. And that the HPSC has just made stopping it impossible. 

‚ÄúYours is a morally cleaner cause.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúHeroes and vigilantes rising against oppression. This is one of the coup‚Äôs trump cards. Having known supervillains and villains fight alongside you would just give the HPSC‚Äôs bitch of a president something to rally independent heroes to her cause. But I can eliminate the government and the parliament before the coup. Non-lethally.‚Äù He adds quickly, that nasty flinch on her face was‚Ä¶ worrying. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôll be no one left to order UA and the independents to help the HPSC. Exchange will assist you in gathering information and supplies. Villain Industries will give you equipment. Kurogiri and Sunset will help you warp whatever you need to the right place without raising suspicion.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd in exchange?‚Äù Miruko asks. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not dumb. You have an agenda in your generosity.‚Äù

‚ÄúGaraki was captured‚Ä¶ according to Overhaul‚Äôs plan.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúPLF is as strong as it was before Garaki and Nine were eliminated. We cannot stop the coup from happening right now, but we need to minimize the casualties. Or Overhaul and Re-Destro will then conquer Japan. We cannot allow the coup to devolve into a civil war, and the coups that fail to succeed fully tend to do that. So twenty-four hours, Miruko. If you fail to eliminate the Commission within a day, you‚Äôll stand down. Or the UA will step in and force you to.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd then what?‚Äù Miruko tilts her head. ‚ÄúGet myself and those who trusted me fucking arrested and jailed in Tartarus for life?‚Äù 

He answers honestly. She doesn‚Äôt like his idea, but she knows she has no other choice. So eventually she accepts. 

 

***

SmallMight: Miruko accepted my offer. Coup will start 48h after the official announcement of the bill project. Since it will be pushed through as an emergency, the thing will probably start soon after it‚Äôs voted in.  

Principal: Details of the offer?
SmallMight: Old maxim: The less you know, the shorter the interrogation. 

SmallMight: I did my best to minimize our losses. And by ‚Äòours‚Äô I mean the entirety of our anti-PLF alliance. 

Principal: Fair, though I have a weird feeling that you made it so that you‚Äôll benefit from it whether the coup succeeds or not. 

SmallMight: Hey I‚Äôm a villainous mastermind, I‚Äôm supposed to do things like that.

Principal: Tsukauchi?

LieDetector: I‚Äôm 99% sure that the Commissioner General Kenji Tsuragamae is a part or at least a sympathizer of the Table of Rejects. 

Principal: Oh dear.

Principal: So the police are a part of this?

LieDetector: You know how badly we are treated by the HPSC (as pretty much over-glorified jailers). 

LieDetector: I don‚Äôt think that the chief of the police will tell us to assault governmental buildings, but I‚Äôm 99 to 100% sure that if he doesn‚Äôt receive appropriate orders from the legal government, he will use any explanation possible to keep the police out of it. 

LieDetector: Casus of the revolution that TinTinCan mentioned. He will not try to overthrow the government (only a small part of the police is from the groups represented by the Table)

LieDetector: but he will ignore the president's pleas to come save it.

LieDetector: the HPSC can at best hope for ‚Äòscrew them both‚Äô approach from the police. 

SpyingEye: What about the JSDF?

Principal: Great enigma. Government have been cutting down their funding (rebuilding damages from villain attacks costs a lot) almost continuously since the dawn of quirks. So there is certainly some resentment, but I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs very keen on fighting for equality. 

TinTinCan: It still exists? I thought it was disbanded.

SmallMight: Something like 15 000 members, serving typically as an honour guard. Weak quirks mostly. Garrison Tartarus mostly, but also do some disaster relief if things get serious. 

SmallMight: Using quirks in international warfare is theoretically forbidden, but it‚Äôs not as if someone cares about that at this point.

Principal: Reasonable governments do care. But it‚Äôs not like we have a lot of those in the area left. But if Chinese warlords invaded us, the Commission would classify them as villains and send Endeavor and that would be the end of the war. 

Principal: We have a Navy, but those won‚Äôt play a significant role in what‚Äôs to come.

SmallMight: Anyone else that might interfere?

SmallMight: PLF probably. MLA doesn‚Äôt have a warper, but we should probably get ready for PLF popping up if things get nasty enough.

AllRight: I agree with that assessment. Is there a possibility of us using Kurogiri to move UA-aligned heroes (at least those aware of the alliance) as a fast-response force if that happened? 

SmallMight: I‚Äôd prefer to avoid this, honestly. Hard to hide the alliance after something like that.

Principal: True. If LoV involvement in the coup will become obvious and so will our involvement with the LoV, it will be hard to pretend that our hands were clean in all of that.

Principal: We require plausible deniability over our involvement in the coup. 

Principal: Let‚Äôs consider this a worst case scenario. But All Might, Lemillion, Sir Nighteye, Best Jeanist, Edgeshot, Crust and the UA faculty should be on the standby for emergency deployment if things go seriously awry. 

AllRight: Alright. 

SmallMight: lol

AllRight: ?

SmallMight: NOTHING SIR

WorldIsAStage: You‚Äôre kidding.

SmallMight: Do I sound like I‚Äôm joking?

WorldIsAStage: That‚Äôs an option?

SmallMight: According to my understanding of the mechanisms of the quirks that you and Twice hold, yes. Might want to ask my mom for assistance if you want to pull it off flawlessly, you absolute drama queen. 

SmallMight: We‚Äôll do some field tests today. 

SmallMight: Chickening out?

WorldIsAStage: OF COURSE NOT YOUNG MIDORIYA

WorldIsAStage: With this heist I will become an SSS-Rank villain and I‚Äôll join the pantheon of the greatest thieves in history! My name will be spoken as an equal of the Peerless Thief! Future generations of thieves will be looking back to me as a giant, a master, a DEMIGOD!!!

WorldIsAStage: THIS IS BRILLIANT! I‚ÄôM SO HAPPY TO HAVE JOINED THE LEAGUE OF VILLAINS!

SmallMight: Pull it off and I‚Äôll promote you to the rank of my adopted uncle. 

WorldIsAStage: YES

WorldIsAStage: I SHALL DO MY UTMOST MY MOST GENEROUS LORD

The media announced the HPSC‚Äô president 's new initiative. The reactions were mixed, to say the least. Her lackeys pointed out how many villains are recruited from among the complex mutants and the villain quirks. 

It wasn‚Äôt surprising. Their data was entirely correct. The one thing Izuku failed to understand in their logic was how denying those two groups (or almost denying) the chance to become the heroes was going to help them STOP committing a disproportionate amount of crimes. 

What options were left for a powerful quirk user from either of this group if heroism was denied to him? They possessed unique and notable skills that could guarantee them a decent life. Heroic industry offered that. What‚Äôs left was mediocrity (where they could expect to be discriminated against)... or villainy. 

The only even remotely reasonable point in the HPSC‚Äô arguments was the security risk of the groups in question going into bed with the Meta-Liberation Army or the Paranormal Liberation Front. But dealing with it in the heavy-handed way that the Commission was doing was only going to make MORE powerful quirk users look towards Re-Destro or Overhaul. 

It was a heavily polarizing move, instead of the publicity stunt that the president expected. Of course, she probably identified the polarizing part as her enemies plotting against her. Then again, she wasn‚Äôt wrong in that one place. 

One TV debate that Izuku saw didn‚Äôt end with a hero vs hero battle only because one of the heroes in question was All Might. His presence calmed the opposition down and stopped them from doing something very very stupid. 

(Spinner joining the list of All Might fans in the League after seeing this program was a small success)

‚ÄúWell, I can‚Äôt exactly say no to it.‚Äù Eraserhead replies. ‚ÄúNot with your parents agreeing to it. Why exactly do you need the day off?‚Äù 

She decided to approach him after the homeroom class. She had to eventually. It was about tomorrow, after all. 

The dorm systems and all the additional security was a thankful development. Especially after the USJ attack and what happened at the Training Camp. But it makes certain things‚Ä¶ harder than they should be.

‚ÄúFamily situation-kero.‚Äù Asui Tsuyu replies promptly. It‚Äôs, in a way, a family situation. She has to help Samidare and Satsuki, her younger siblings. Among many other people. She doesn‚Äôt like it, but‚Ä¶ she and Eraserhead both know that if the bill passes, her hopes for heroics are dead. She might have a provisional licence, but getting the real one will be‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù Eraserhead replies promptly. ‚ÄúI should probably ask why every single complex mutant quirk bearer in the UA heroics courses has a family situation on the same day‚Ä¶ just as our guidance counselor. And a handful of people with quirks that are for some reason perceived as ‚Äòvillainous‚Äô.‚Äù He sighs. ‚ÄúBut I won‚Äôt. Just be careful and come back to us. Unharmed.‚Äù 

He knows, she realizes. He knows and he doesn‚Äôt forbid her from going. He doesn‚Äôt try to arrest her. He just tells her to be careful. 

It might have been less than a year, and it didn‚Äôt start on the best note. But she is extremely happy that Aizawa Shouta was her homeroom teacher. And that she got to join the UA Heroics course. She can only hope that it‚Äôs not the end.

‚ÄúThank you, Aizawa-sensei.‚Äù She says and bows her head a little. 

‚ÄúI think that considering the number of people developing family situations tomorrow, the school can survive a single day without lessons.‚Äù Eraserhead adds. ‚ÄúGo tell your classmates that the rest of the day is free. Do something you teenagers do when you have too much free time.‚Äù 

She will make the most out of this day.
Notes:

    If the UA was still wiretapped:

    Kuroiro: *hears the talk between Aizawa and Tsuyu*
    Kuroiro: *files the recording under the 'evidence that Aizawa has a heart' category*
    Kuroiro: What a rare treat.

    ALSO GET READY FOR ANOTHER PLOT ROLLERCOASTER FULL OF THINGS YOU CERTAINLY DIDN'T EXPECT. We're starting with the coup, and then things get progressively more intense ;)

Chapter 51: Coup
Summary:

    The time has come for the long-awaited Mr. Compress perfor... I mean, the coup. Yes. The coup.

Chapter Text

‚ÄúEveryone knows me, but I‚Äôll introduce myself regardless.‚Äù The figure in a street magician garb, with a colourful mask and a cane announces from the recording. ‚ÄúI am Mr. Compress! The world‚Äôs greatest magician and a noble thief. The man who steals from the naughty and gives to those who are in need. The descendant of the Peerless Thief, Oji Harima himself!‚Äù 

He gives a short bow. The people throughout Japan see him. He is on the internet and in the TV - whether he achieved that through hacking or by promising the TVs a good scoop is anyone‚Äôs guess at this point. 

‚ÄúI have come to you to announce my greatest heist!‚Äù Mr. Compress says. ‚ÄúWho was the naughty one this time? All of you, of course! The entirety of Japan. The people you choose to represent you are gathered in the National Diet as we speak, together with the entirety of the government. They are debating the most atrocious of laws. The one denying a good part of the society their right to strive towards becoming heroes. My ancestors didn‚Äôt spend their entire lives fighting against unworthy heroes for me to ignore an injustice of this scale, performed by the Hero Commission itself! But first, let me introduce my wonderful assistants!‚Äù 

He points towards a (still familiar to many) figure in a black catsuit. She might have been inactive for many years and only regained her ability to walk a while ago‚Ä¶ but Midoriya Inko is still graceful. And Eri did make her younger when she made her walk again. Her bow is deep‚Ä¶ and there is something feline in the smoothness of movement and almost improbable sense of balance. 

‚ÄúFirst one is‚Ä¶ Mischief!‚Äù Mr. Compress announces loudly. ‚ÄúMany of you still remember her as an S-Rank thief who is believed to have died fourteen years ago. She, in fact, retired and decided to focus on her family. But she decided in her endless generosity, to assist me in my greatest heist!‚Äù 

Then he points towards a man in black costume, with comically large while eyes. His slight bow is much less graceful, and it‚Äôs clear that he is extremely nervous.

‚ÄúThe second one is‚Ä¶ Twice!‚Äù Mr. Compress says. ‚ÄúHe is not yet a ranked villain, something we will be working on today, and is a relatively recent addition to the Levellers. Something you can certainly guess from the signs of the stage fright. Don‚Äôt make this fool you, his quirk is a truly wonderful one and he is an extremely nice fellow!‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd now, my fans, haters and the boring rest: a question.‚Äù Mr. Compress once again focuses on the camera. ‚ÄúWhat can you steal from a country itself? A lot of things. But this has to be something truly, truly valuable. And what is truly important to the country as a whole?‚Äù 

The image of the trio of thieves in some underground studio vanishes, replaced with a National Diet building, seen from the air. The camera is probably on some drone. 

There are people surrounding the building. Not just heroes tasked with its protection. There is a circle of people surrounding all of them. Divided into dozens of groups, each composed of Mr. Compress, Mischief and Twice. 

The heroes are seen scrambling to intercept. But then something happens. The building and everything inside the circle starts warping. Getting smaller. Changing. Within less than twenty seconds the National Diet vanishes, leaving nothing but a semi-circular hole in the ground, slowly filled with water from the few severed pipes. Heroes are nowhere to be seen. 

Mischief figures extend their hands. After a few seconds, whatever they do is over. The three-people groups all began to flee from the scene, each in a different direction. Then the camera is back to the studio.

‚ÄúWhich one of one hundred Mischief clones carries the National Diet building and the entire Japanese government, I wonder?‚Äù Mr. Compress asks. ‚ÄúWell, you better catch them all! If the heroes fail to catch the correct one, I‚Äôll contact you again in a few days to talk about the ransom. And in the meantime‚Ä¶ have a nice day, Japan!‚Äù The three figures in the studio bow again, before the transmission ends. 

Many thieves stole from the government. Mr. Compress became the first one to steal the government.

TinTinCan: HOW

Principal: WHY

SpyingEye: WHERE

SmallMight: How: Twice can create copies of people that actually can use their quirks (lied to you all a bit, oopsie? that was Levellers secret though, not mine). Mr. Compress can store everything from an area of space. But a single Mr. Compress has a limit to how large the space is and how quick the storage is. Mr. Compress and 99 of his clones working together on compressing the same space, in the meantime‚Ä¶

SmallMight: Why: Because I promised Miruko to nonlethally eliminate the government so that there is no one to order the independent heroes and the UA to assist the Commission. Mr. Compress will give them back once the coup is over (although there probably will be a ransom demand).

SmallMight: Where: NOT ANSWERING THAT QUESTION OBVIOUSLY

The country was still reeling in shock from Mr. Compress‚Äô greatest heist, when another shocking event happened. Miruko announced a press conference. That alone would be surprising, but the actual conference was even greater of a shock. 

Miruko announced that considering the atrocious incompetence of the Hero Commission (proven by the Mr. Compress heist) and their hostile and discriminatory policies, its president is to stand down immediately and get ready for a trial. 

This was spoken in the typical Miruko way, so it included a lot of expletives. 

She followed up with an announcement that considering the nature of the ‚Äòvillain organization‚Äô known as the Hero Commission, the heroes will move in to apprehend its members immediately. She urged other heroes to join the effort to clean the country from corruption and injustice.

It was the signal. The fighting started almost everywhere at once. 

 

***

‚ÄúA coup.‚Äù The president of the Hero Commission says in the deafening silence of her office. ‚ÄúThis is a coup.‚Äù Her mind can barely compute the very term. Miruko? Miruko of all people decided to lead a coup against her? 

This is ridiculous. Sure, there are many complex mutants throughout the heroic industry, but the Commission‚Äô superiority in numbers is astounding. The only problem was Nedzu, but she could counteract him if she squashed this idiotic coup quickly.

‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt have the time for this.‚Äù She announces with a painful sigh. ‚ÄúSend Hawks to arrest Miruko. How many other complex mutant heroes are going to follow her?‚Äù 

She was in her conference room in the HPSC headquarters, surrounded by her closest circle of advisors and heads of departments. They gathered to form a cohesive response to Mr. Compress‚Äô heist when‚Ä¶ this happened. 

One of her advisors was listening to a phone call. Probably from someone with better access to the arriving information. What passed for the emergency management section of the HPSC was one floor beneath them.  

She could see the advisor‚Äôs face growing increasingly pale. Eventually he finished the phone call. 

‚ÄúAll of them.‚Äù He replies, with a shaky voice. ‚ÄúAnd almost every hero which would be included in the villainous quirk register. We are under attack everywhere, and‚Ä¶‚Äù He pauses for a second, trying to force the words out. ‚Äú... the Commissioner General just issued an arrest warrant for you. As a suspected SSS-Rank villain.‚Äù 

‚Äú... he did WHAT?!‚Äù Her only answer was silence. 

 

***

SmallMight: I THOUGHT THAT POLICE WOULD STAY NEUTRAL

LieDetector: I THOUGHT SO TOO!

Principal: It‚Äôs just an arrest warrant, though? I mean, he has evidence for the Commission cover-up of Endeavor abuse, and probably did some under-the-cover investigation of the Thunderbolt mess-up that Legion mentioned. 

Principal: He could do that at every moment, he did it now because there is no government to tell him to sweep that under the rug. 

Principal: The police as a whole don't seem to leave their precincts. 

LieDetector: I can confirm. We have an order to stay inside and do not respond to any calls that seem to be connected to the on-going coup d‚Äôetat. Regardless of the side calling us in.

 

***

The Storm Chasers Hero Agency was among the first ones to fall. Without Thunderbolt to lead it, it has taken a massive hit in combat strength. But it was firmly on the Hero Commission side, so it was naturally among the locations that the Table had to attack. 

Unfortunately for its defenders, they were taken off-guard. The few heroes and (a lot of sidekicks) belonging to the Agency were mostly wearing their casual clothes, were scattered through the building (or in few rare cases, were outside it to begin with), and were only starting to notice what was happening in the media when the attack started. 

Even more unfortunately to its defenders, Shishido and a group of truly, truly angry members of the Table were the ones to attack it. They spared no one. 

 

***

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs official now.‚Äù Overhaul announces from his command center. The military base he is living in was constructed by one or another government in the past and then eventually abandoned. At least before he moved in. Oversight on its creators‚Äô part. ‚ÄúInsanity is a symptom of the quirk disease.‚Äù 

Heroes are now slaughtering each other? What madness is that? He didn‚Äôt even have a hand in this! Not like he is angry about it, The heroes are helping him kill them all, so it‚Äôs quite nice of them. 

‚ÄúAre we going to‚Ä¶ uhm‚Ä¶ intervene?‚Äù One of his advisors asks. He seems to be as surprised by the news as Overhaul is. They all are. The news from Japan they are all seeing on the screen make no sense.

Overhaul calculates their level of preparations for the next stage of their plan. He doesn‚Äôt need Mastermind to know that the heroes are now weakened and occupied. But he still needs a massive amount of firepower to achieve their next objective. 

‚ÄúStart preparations for the sortie.‚Äù Overhaul eventually announces. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll move or not, uuugh, depending on the situation.‚Äù

After a painfully long time, Burnin finally picks up the phone. She is now the head of Endeavor's old agency, and has been promoted to a full hero. A great achievement. Most important of all, the agency is relatively close to the Hero Commission‚Äôs headquarters, and the fact that the latter is yet to be attacked is probably a miracle. 

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù Burnin asks. President is slightly surprised by the coldness in her voice. 

‚ÄúThis is a coup, I need your Agency to reinforce the defense of the HPSC headquarters.‚Äù She responds quickly and officially. ‚ÄúWhen can I expect you to arrive?‚Äù 

‚ÄúHow about‚Ä¶ never?‚Äù Burnin replies, and the president freezes for a few seconds. Did Burnin just‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù She eventually vocalizes her surprise. 

‚ÄúEndeavor was my idol long before I joined his agency.‚Äù Burnin replies. Her voice is less cold and more venomous now. ‚ÄúHearing what Dabi said about him‚Ä¶ I know he said the truth. I know because I know how much of an obsession about the first seat in the hero ranking Endeavor had. I was originally angry at him. I felt betrayed, you know? But then‚Ä¶ I started to think. HPSC was backing him in this. And who would benefit the most from having a hero to equal All Might in their pocket?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù President had no time to waste, and Burnin was just‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúYou and your organization twisted and destroyed the man that inspired me to become a hero.‚Äù Burnin continued talking, ignoring the president entirely. ‚ÄúAll in the name of ‚Ä¶ what exactly? Getting more power than Nedzu? Well, good luck with that. This is now Shoto Todoroki‚Äôs hero agency, and I‚Äôll be keeping this post for him until he graduates. We‚Äôll stay neutral in this coup‚Ä¶ like the UA does. And you? I hope you‚Äôll rot in hell, bitch.‚Äù 

The connection ended. President stared at the phone in her hand for a few long seconds, trying to understand what just happened. 

 

***

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think that this is a bit too much, Miruko?‚Äù Hawks asks. He is floating in the air in front of her. She didn‚Äôt exactly hide - she was simply standing in front of the building where she held her press conference. She knew he was coming. ‚ÄúA coup? Really? How‚Äôs that something a hero would do?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly something a hero would do, bastard.‚Äù Miruko replies boldly. She hoped that Hawks could come. She is no leader. A symbol, yes. But no leader. She is a warrior. A champion of her cause. And her enemy was kind enough to send a champion of their own for her to bring down. 

‚ÄúMiruko‚Ä¶‚Äù He is trying. Probably to make her surrender. Did the overbitch forget to mention to him how serious the situation was? ‚Äú...don‚Äôt make me do it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference between the two of us, huh?‚Äù She isn‚Äôt much of a talker. But she has words to say. ‚ÄúThat all you have is just a single feature that a human shouldn‚Äôt have and I have multiple? That your children will have either some random feather-oriented quirks or will inherit one from their mother‚Ä¶ and mine will all be half-rabbits?‚Äù She laughs bitterly. ‚ÄúOh I still got off easily. I could look like Gang Orca. Way less human. Even less accepted.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMiruko, you are going to regret this.‚Äù Something on Hawks‚Äô face steels up. ‚ÄúWhen this is over‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI live every day of my life like there's no tomorrow so that when my number's up, I can check out with no regrets!‚Äù She interrupts him. ‚ÄúIf you and your boss thought that I‚Äôm going to lie down when a villain like her is ruining lives of innocent people, then you both know shit about Miruko the Hero. Now come.‚Äù She smiles. In the way that made many villains surrender immediately. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs fight.‚Äù 

 

***

The biggest surprise of the coup were the ‚Äòvillain quirk heroes‚Äô. They weren‚Äôt included in the rankings. The Hero Commission never considered them that much of a threat due to that, completely oblivious to the fact that the hero rankings were at least partially sorted according to their popularity. And that there was an entire category of heroes that couldn‚Äôt get high in the ranking, regardless of their strength. 

Rank 9 hero, Scream, learned that the hard way. Her agency was attacked by a task force composed primarily of the villain quirk heroes, most of them from the Underground Hero Network. She fought hard, that much had to be said. Her quirk was oddly similar to Present Mic‚Äôs - then again, it‚Äôs not like there are many ways in which combat-worthy sonic quirks manifest. 

She and her sidekicks hold their ground for twenty minutes. Scream eventually fell when she was confronted by two unranked heroes - one whose quirk suppressed all sounds in the vicinity (rendering her quirk useless) and another who could trap people who looked into his eyes in nightmarous hallucinations. By the time she woke up from them, she was already incarcerated. 

The reinforcements she called from the Fourth Kind‚Äôs agency never came. When two interns from the UA - Ejiro Kirishima and Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu - asked him about it, the Chivalrous Hero responded by saying that there is nothing chivalrous in siding with the Hero Commission. 

 

***

 

President put the phone back down. 

‚ÄúWhat did Ryukyu say?‚Äù One of her advisors decided to interrupt the silence. 

‚ÄúShe pretended to be a voicemail.‚Äù President answers. Her voice is unexpectedly tired and she looks like she aged ten years in the past two hours. ‚ÄúNo help is coming.‚Äù 

Gang Orca picked that very moment to use his sonar blast to shatter half of the windows in the front wall of the Hero Commission headquarters. His sidekicks stormed in, with him walking in right behind them. The security and the few heroes stationed throughout the building did their best to stop the attack. It was rather obvious that their best wasn‚Äôt going to be enough. 

There was only one last number to phone. She wanted to avoid it. It was too early. It was supposed to be her trump card, something that would allow her to retake Hokkaido once it would finally be ready. And, if the worst came to happen, a potential counter to All Might.

‚ÄúMera.‚Äù She says into the phone once the man on the other end picks it up. ‚ÄúDeploy the Paragons. Now.‚Äù

 

***

Snatch was a hero that specialized in convoy escort. He was the man who was tasked with making sure that the dangerous villains stopped by the other heroes made it safely to the prisons. 

His quirk had nothing to do with speed. It was sand control. But he had a lot of it stored in his car. It made his car go with only a moderate speed, but allowed him to field significant firepower when his convoy was attacked. 

He was also the only major Commission hero who was actually hard to catch. He was on the move for most of the time. Snatch might have avoided the events of that day simply because of that. But he didn‚Äôt expect the temporary cooperation between the League of Villains and the Vigilante Alliance. 

When he departed from the police precinct where he was in when the coup started, he didn‚Äôt notice one of Gremlin‚Äôs drones hanging over him. The Alliance knew where he was heading. Snatch found that out when Knuckleduster used a sniper rifle to puncture the tire of his car. 

Snatch lost control of his car and it crashed. With high speed. But he was a Rank 14 Hero. He used his sand to dampen the impact, and while the car was totaled, he emerged from the wreckage practically unharmed. And right in time to see members of the Naruhata Vigilante Group step out of two cars that stopped in front of him. 

Seven people. Armed with knives, baseball bats and naked fists. Plus, of course, some quirks. 

‚ÄúWell, don‚Äôt get me wrong.‚Äù One of them, a young man with a head formed of spikes, says. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre apparently one of the less nasty of Commission heroes. But we really can‚Äôt let you reach Dreamer‚Äôs Hero Agency.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Snatch is angry. He only recently finished paying for his car. ‚ÄúWhich one of you, punks, is going to take me, Rank 14 Hero, down?‚Äù 

It was Pop Step. With a set of taser-boots created for her by the Villain Industries. How exactly did she sneak behind him into a perfect position to leap at his back and incapacitate him was anyone‚Äôs guess, really.

 

***

‚ÄúWell, you got me.‚Äù Hawks is lying on the ground beneath her, thoroughly exhausted and beaten up. He used all of his remaining feathers to stop her last kick, but she still broke a rib or two. 

Not like Miruko is looking much better. His featherswords cut her badly. She also has a few puncture wounds from his feathers. She is in no condition to continue fighting, but there is no one to fight in the vicinity. The nearest hero agencies have all announced their neutrality. 

Being in no condition to fight is meaningless when there is no fight to have. 

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what now?‚Äù Hawks says. Even in his state, he is still cheerful. So disgustingly cheerful. ‚ÄúGonna arrest me now, Miruko?‚Äù Despite being beaten down by her, he still doesn‚Äôt take her seriously. Did he even fight for real? Well, she‚Äôll never find out now. 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù She says. He gasps when he feels her feet on his throat. Pushing down on him. He is trying to say something, but she isn‚Äôt letting him. ‚ÄúI know about Hosu, Hawks. I know that you killed Ingenium.‚Äù 

The struggling under her intensifies, as the realization blooms on his face. 

‚ÄúI know that the HPSC picked you up from the street and changed you into their poster boy. ‚Äú Miruko says quietly. ‚ÄúI know that they have controlled you ever since you were a child. And I know that bitch used you as her pet assassin ever since Lady Nagant went renegade on the Commission. But even then‚Ä¶ you could have missed. With his speed, all you had to do was to say that he heard something and dodged, enough for you to miss his vitals. And that there were heroes coming, so you fled. But you killed him.‚Äù 

He grabbed her leg beneath the knee and tried to - pointlessly - pull her off his throat. Desperate struggles. Pointless struggles. 

‚ÄúI never met Ingenium, you know.‚Äù Miruko ads. ‚ÄúNot my type of man. Way too weak. But I know that among his seventy sidekicks, he had twenty-two ‚Äòvillain quirkers‚Äô, four hidden quirkless and twelve complex mutants. Including one girl that he personally talked off the rooftop and told her that she can be a hero‚Ä¶ and that he‚Äôll help her in that.‚Äù Miruko looks down at Hawks, whose struggles are growing weak. ‚ÄúAnd you killed him, Hawks.‚Äù 

When he stops struggling, she splatters his brain on the pavement with a kick. She might be exhausted and wounded, but she doesn‚Äôt leave things unfinished. 

 

***

‚ÄúEhhh, looks like Gang Orca has really scared her off.‚Äù Crawler says, still busy observing the HPSC headquarters through a set of binoculars. 

The helicopter approaching the building is a clear indication of this. Someone was looking for an evac from the sinking ship, and it probably wasn‚Äôt an accountant. 

Oh how long she was waiting for this day. 

‚ÄúUnsurprising, if the news is to be believed.‚Äù She replies calmly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre winning everywhere, so she is probably planning to escape to some country with which Japan has no extradition agreement.‚Äù 

They are standing together on a rooftop of a building a few hundred meters away from the HPSC headquarters. They aren‚Äôt exactly hiding, then again they don‚Äôt really have to. They have a third vigilante with them, a girl who can keep things hidden by making people outside of the area of influence see said area as it looked before the quirk was activated. 

The world outside of them saw an empty rooftop. A bit of cheating, but she wasn‚Äôt going to complain about that. 

The helicopter landed. 

‚ÄúFour people.‚Äù Crawler announces. He is a decent spotter, she has to admit. ‚ÄúLooks like heroes, but I don‚Äôt recognize their uniforms. And‚Ä¶ oh, looks like the overbitch is here. She‚Äôs leaving the building with several bodyguards. Plus Insomni and Flash.‚Äù 

Nothing out of ordinary, maybe save for the heroes that arrived on the helicopter. Insomni and Flash were two quite powerful heroes that she kept on a short leash and used as her personal bodyguards. Then again, they weren‚Äôt just leashed. They were loyal. Although she had no idea why. 

‚ÄúGreat.‚Äù She says. After several years of being a sniper for the Vigilante Alliance, she has finally reached this moment. 

There was no need to pretend anymore. She put down the sniper rifle that she used as a part of her camouflage (Knuckleduster had a good taste in guns, another thing she had to admit). Then she morphed her right arm into her own sniper rifle. 

‚ÄúSo, Lady Nagant.‚Äù Crawler asks, his eyes still on their targets. ‚ÄúReady for some revenge?‚Äù 

‚ÄúAlways, Koichi.‚Äù She smiles, locates the HPSC president through her scope, and pulls the trigger.
Notes:

    Victory.

    ... or is it?

    [also surprise Nagant and surprise investigative skills of Miruko, I really like those two characters even in canon and that's rare]

    Also, let me be honest with you. The idea for the coup was at least partially influenced by the supremely intimidating Gang Orca and his sidekick army stepping in during the Provisional License exam. It was so awesome that I just had to put similar (but, you know, MORE) scene in the fanfic. Hence Gang Orca storming the HPSC headquarters.

Chapter 52: Coup [II]
Summary:

    Things no longer go accordingly to the plan. Accordingly to anyone's plan, to be honest.

Notes:

    In my defense, I know this is a low blow. Like the whole 'make the world think for like one chapter that Hagakure is a traitor before revealing that NOPE' that Horikoshi pulled. I should... left some suggestions that things were going to go in a bit different in the last chapter, something more pronounced than 'Mera, deploy the Paragons'. Sorry for that.

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

Up until that very moment, the coup was progressing according to plan‚Ä¶ and actually ahead of schedule. The only serious delays were the Gang Orca‚Äôs assault on the HPSC headquarters occurred almost an hour late due to a completely unexpected traffic jam, and Hound Dog‚Äôs assault on the Sweet Dreams Agency. 

After less than five hours of fighting, the majority of the notable Hero Commission-aligned hero agencies have either fallen, or were busy falling to the attacks. The only Top 15 Heroes serving the Commission that were yet to be incarcerated were those that were currently serving as a part of the Northern Battle Group (so Yoroi Muusha and Boulder, and only the former was willing to bleed for the Commission) and Dreamer. 

Hawks was dead. Scream and Snatch were arrested. Almost all notable independent hero agencies refused to side with the HPSC (although typically they chose neutrality). The police took the neutral option as well, save for its Commissioner General. The JSDF were entirely forgotten in the chaos, and its soldiers were watching the chaos in the media. Besides, it would take it further hours to deploy, even if the president remembered that it exists. 

Most of all, Gang Orca took over 75% of the HPSC headquarters, with the remaining heroes and security units in the building unlikely to offer significant resistance. In fact, the resistance was almost entirely broken at this point, with the remaining defenders typically choosing to surrender at the first sight of Gang Orca‚Äôs sidekicks. 

It appeared that the coup succeeded. Unfortunately, the situation was a bit more complicated than that. 

 

***

‚ÄúSNIPER, GET DOWN!‚Äù one of the Paragons that arrived on the helicopter shouted. The president felt her bodyguards throwing her on the ground. A second later she heard the thunderous sound and what felt like a nearby explosion. 

The second shot beheaded Flash, not giving the hero the time needed to activate their quirk to blind whoever attacked her. The attacker couldn‚Äôt hit the president now (not when she was covered with her bodyguards, most of which carried body-hardening quirks), but they could eliminate everyone else. 

Insomni was mostly useless in this situation. But he died as the third one, regardless. 

The paragons finally moved in. One of them extended their hand and fired a blinding projectile towards the nearest building. The projectile exploded over it, raining fire on its rooftop. 

Whoever was there either died or fled, for there was no fourth shot. 

 

***

‚ÄúRepeat that,‚Äù Gang Orca said into the microphone. He was bulldozing the remaining (rather pitiful) resistance while rushing towards the uppermost level of this maze of a building. Then, this happened. 

‚ÄúWe failed to kill her,‚Äù Crawler replies. There is pain audible in his voice. ‚ÄúShe escaped on a helicopter. You have several new hostiles inbound. I think they mean business.‚Äù 

Oh, joy. 

Gang Orca would have replied to that, but that‚Äôs when the ceiling in the corridor in front of him gave in. The muscular figure wearing an unfamiliar hero uniform lands there. Two seconds later another figure in black bodysuit lands behind it. 

‚ÄúThere you are, villain,‚Äù the muscular one says, with disgust dripping off his tongue. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Valiant, a Rank Three Paragon. And the man behind me is Foresight, Rank Four Paragon. We‚Äôve come here to arrest you‚Ä¶ or kill you, if you resist. What do you choose?‚Äù

Paragon? Gang Orca‚Äôs thoughts drift to what they knew about Hawks‚Äô past. How the Commission pretty much bought him from his family and then trained him in secret for years before showing him to the world.

That bitch prepared her own private army in secret? 

Gang Orca doesn‚Äôt bother answering with words. Instead he unleashes his sonar blast. 

 

***

Hound Dog touches Dreamer with a taser and flips it on. A few seconds of electrocution later, the petite Rank 8 Hero goes limp. He lets her go, and her body hits the floor and stays there, motionless.

UA‚Äôs guidance counselor actually feels kinda bad about it. Dreamer is one of the youngest pro heroes out there - she is merely eighteen years old. And she looks sixteen. It feels like doing it to one of his students. 

He spent too many years helping kids with discrimination-caused emotional baggage that they shouldn‚Äôt have to not join the coup. But it still feels wrong. 

At least they managed to take the Sweet Dreams Agency without killing anyone. UA students - and a handful of pro heroes, mostly underground ones - are rounding the last defenders up and arresting them. 

‚ÄúDreamer‚Äôs Agency, ghrhrh, has fallen,‚Äù he says into the microphone. The independent and secure communication network that the Table obtained on the black market (Hound Dog does his best to not notice the empty spaces where the Villain Industries logo was earlier) is one of its biggest trump cards. 

‚ÄúINCOMING!‚Äù someone shouts back. The large window in front of him explodes, raining glass on those inside. Hound Dog isn‚Äôt wounded (unlike some of the students in the room and some of the captives). But he is angry. 

He sees two unfamiliar heroes enter the room through the window. One has wings. One seems to have black snakes for hair. 

Hound Dog doesn‚Äôt give them time to speak, instead he leaps at them. His wounds from the Training Camp still ache, but he doesn‚Äôt care about that now. 

 

***

‚ÄúYour prognosis?‚Äù Overhaul asks Mastermind. They are both observing the events in Japan on several media channels at once. Way too much for Overhaul to handle, but Mastermind seems to be doing just fine. 

‚ÄúThe coup failed,‚Äù Mastermind replies. ‚ÄúThey started extremely well, but the unexpected deployment of the reinforcements on the Commission side tilted the balance in the government‚Äôs favour. Gang Orca‚Äôs assault on the HPSC headquarters has failed, and it appears that the HPSC managed to repulse Hound Dog from the Sweet Dreams Agency as well.‚Äù 

They both saw Gang Orca being carried out of the building by his sidekicks. Some TV helicopter recorded it from a distance. Gang Orca was badly wounded and not in a shape for further fighting, but whoever he was fighting with didn‚Äôt seem to be in a shape good enough to pursue him. That or because of the fact that the retreating strike force set fire to the building after deactivating its fire-suppression systems. The HPSC headquarters were burning down, and the firefighters refused to show up to what was de facto still a battlefield. 

‚ÄúNature of the reinforcements?‚Äù Overhaul asks. He has patience. Mastermind has been continuously active for many hours. It‚Äôs just an analysis, rather than commanding skills. But he will need to rest soon. And even now he requires some input from his handler. 

‚ÄúPreviously unregistered heroes,‚Äù Mastermind replies. ‚ÄúEstimated numbers: 200 to 300. Some of them are capable of going toe-to-toe with Top 15 Heroes. My theory is that they are an army that was raised in secret by the Commission as a trump card in case of a coup or Meta-Liberation Army attack. Trained in secret, probably with some loyalty conditioning if not surgical and pharmacological improvements.‚Äù

Oh you sneaky, sneaky bitch. Overhaul is secretly in awe. For how many years was this plan in motion? And no one ever heard a thing. A few more years and she would manage to retake Hokkaido - MLA was capable of holding ground against the forces Japan could spare without becoming an open target for domestic villains, but this new group practically multiplied Japan's available firepower for such an operation. 

‚ÄúWhy did the coup fail?‚Äù he asked another question. Mastermind‚Äôs face flinched weirdly for a second before returning to its normal, emotionless state. 

‚ÄúMiruko can still win, but only if she is ready to go for a full-blown civil war,‚Äù Mastermind replies. ‚ÄúDeployment of the new heroes prevented the coup from eliminating the Commission in the first series of attacks. President is now in an undisclosed location, from which she can issue orders to her forces that are still active. Rebels have numerical superiority, but are tired, no longer have the informational advantage over the enemy and have lost the initiative. What‚Äôs even worse for Miruko is that as time passes, more independent heroes will drift towards the Commission. They are still afraid of the president and her potential revenge-spree, and have mostly stayed silent earlier because it looked like she was going to be taken down.‚Äù

Was Miruko ready to fight this battle for days if not weeks, slowly bleeding out the Hero Commission? Was UA ready to let her do that if it meant exposing the country to Overhaul‚Äôs non-existent mercy? 

Probably not. 24h, Overhaul suspects. If the rebels fail to overthrow the Commission in a single day, UA will probably step in. It didn‚Äôt matter which side it would support. The coup - and the chaos - will be over by then. 

‚ÄúYour analysis on the next step of our plan?‚Äù he asks. That‚Äôs the most important question right now. 

‚ÄúWe have to attack,‚Äù Mastermind replies promptly. ‚ÄúMiruko‚Äôs victory unlikely. If the Commission wins, the new heroes will strengthen its ability to respond to our attack. We should wait for the HPSC to bleed and tire itself out a bit more, and then move in. Before the coup officially ends, and while there is still chaos throughout Japan. If we timed it up correctly, the only forces capable of forming a cohesive response to our attack will be the League of Villains and the UA heroes.‚Äù 

Those two cooperated with each other‚Ä¶ but cooperating in secret and deploying their full forces alongside each other were two entirely different things. Especially when Mr. Compress - a member of the League, something that Overhaul is ready to tell the world if needed‚Äî - just kidnapped the entire government. 

And without their entire firepower, they really can‚Äôt hope to stop what‚Äôs coming. 

Marvellous. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre moving out today.‚Äù Overhaul announces. His staff officers start to move around. This will be a busy day for them all.

The Storm Chasers Agency was the site of some of the fiercest and bloodiest battles during the course of the coup.  Shishido took it over in the first hour of the fighting, then held his ground during the counterattack. He was eventually forced to retreat from it after the Paragons arrived, only to reclaim the Agency two hours later once the Table‚Äôs reinforcements arrived. 

Majority of the building lay in ruin at this point. Surrounding buildings were mostly evacuated (not like someone was in a mind to do that, people fled on their own). The value of the Agency building was next to zero at this point, but it was a war between heroes. What else were they supposed to fight over? Actual government offices and streets didn‚Äôt matter (although the later often become battlefields when groups of heroes loyal to the HPSC and the Table run into each other). 

As a result, hero agencies belonging to both sides become focal points of the fighting. It wasn‚Äôt even thirty minutes since Gang Orca repelled the HPSC‚Äô counterassault on his own agency when a crowd of Paragons and heroes arrived at the Storm Chasers Agency. 

This time they came prepared. Most of the attackers were exhausted (the coup started sixteen hours ago, and they didn‚Äôt have a lot of time to recuperate in the meantime), but so were the defenders. And this time the attackers made sure to not leave any exit unguarded, like they did last time. 

Shishido didn‚Äôt even try to run. He died, surrounded by a pile of dead Paragons. Twenty minutes later the Hound Dog‚Äôs group arrived and retook the Storm Chasers Agency, only to immediately abandon it. There was nothing left to fight over.

Principal: The coup failed.

SmallMight: I KNOW I DID MY DAMN BEST

SmallMight: Shit

SpyingEye: Nobody could expect HPSC pulling out a private army from the president‚Äôs pocket.

SmallMight: The fighting is still going, but it‚Äôs pretty much a stalemate. 

SmallMight: Is the UA ready to intervene in the coup's favour?

Principal: I would be willing to. But it‚Äôs my personal spite talking. 

Principal: We are the bastion of heroics in its traditional, mostly apolitical meaning. If we join the ‚Äòlets mix politics with heroics‚Äô gang, we‚Äôll practically kill the heroism as a term, at least in Japan.

Principal: I‚Äôm going to start preparing some legal hijinks to keep as many involved in the coup in the business after it ends, but there is no hope when it comes to the leaders.

SmallMight: I don‚Äôt think that there‚Äôll be many willing to stay heroes if the Commission wins tbh.

SmallMight: Well, damn.

SmallMight: We have something like four hours left until the 24h period. 

SmallMight: Hopefully Miruko will find the HPSC command staff hidey-hole in the meantime. And Overhaul will not intervene. 

LieDetector: Some heroes just tried to apprehend the Commissioner General for siding with the coup.

LieDetector: Police officers on site‚Ä¶ discouraged them from this. Both by the threat of force and by pointing out how nothing that Kenji did was technically illegal. 

LieDetector: Heroes said that this isn‚Äôt over and they‚Äôll return.

SmallMight: Vengeful bitch. 

Principal I‚Äôll start the damage control in two hours.

‚Äú... heroes attempting to apprehend the president of the Hero Public Safety Commission have valid reasons for their anger.‚Äù Nedzu announces from the screen. ‚ÄúMany of them served honourably for years if not decades, only to now be treated as second if not third class heroes. By a woman who, since the events in Hosu, has a‚Ä¶ questionable reputation. I am also unsurprised by many hero trainees joining in, since the law in question would by all intents and purposes bar them from ever becoming heroes. Law that is, to say it simple, discriminatory.‚Äù 

Miruko, Gang Orca and a handful of coup members delegated to serve in its headquarters observe the events on the screen. Knuckleduster sees the room through a videochat. He is elsewhere now, attempting to retake the Scream‚Äôs agency. For the third time already. 

All Might, Best Jeanist, Edgeshot and even Crust, oddly enough, are standing behind Nedzu. That adds a certain gravity to the rat‚Äôs words. 

‚ÄúAs a result, I‚Äôve decided to call for an official cessation of hostilities.‚Äù Nedzu continues. ‚ÄúContinuing the fighting will only weaken the heroes in Japan, something that we cannot allow to happen in the face of the threat that the Paranormal Liberation Front, the Meta-Liberation Army and the League of Villains are. If both sides will not stand down within an hour and await the return of the legally elected government of Japan for it to judge which side is right, I call all currently neutral heroes to step in and help restore order.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, there goes our coup.‚Äù Gang Orca says. He is lying on a large bed, not really up for fighting. Too many ribs broken during his fight against Valiant. 

‚ÄúWe knew that we weren‚Äôt going to win for at least several hours now.‚Äù Miruko chuckles bitterly. Not even a single enemy she faced after Hawks got close to being a threat to her. She has only one or two new wounds. ‚ÄúKnuckleduster, your opinion?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a vigilante.‚Äù The voice from the computer replies. ‚ÄúUnlike you, I can‚Äôt hope to be treated by the government as anything other than a villain who tried to overthrow the government. I‚Äôm telling the Alliance forces to disengage and go into hiding.‚Äù He sighs. ‚ÄúWe lost too many people already.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAs if the government will be merciful towards me.‚Äù Miruko chuckles again, this time somehow even more bitterly. ‚ÄúNedzu might defend some rank and file rebels, but certainly no one important. And certainly no one who killed someone during the fight. I killed Number Two Hero, you know?‚Äú

Gang Orca says nothing. He knows that many of the Commission personnel failed to evacuate the headquarters before the fire swallowed it all. He prefers not to think about it, but he is painfully aware that he and his sidekicks cannot hope for anything other than Tartarus. There is one alternative (if you exclude public suicide), but he loathes it. 

‚ÄúPlan B then.‚Äù Miruko ads and turns towards the people gathered in the room. ‚ÄúContact every single member of the Table out there. Explain the situation to them. Tell them that whoever can hope for merciful treatment should just go home. The rest‚Ä¶ and those who don‚Äôt want to rely on the government's mercy‚Ä¶ return to the safehouses. Letters describing where you should head to now will be waiting for you there. Table of Rejects goes underground.‚Äù 

As they move to relay her orders, she pulls out her phone. 

 

***

AngryRabbit: Table is standing down. 

SmallMight: So, plan B?

AngryRabbit: Yes. Table of Rejects is officially requesting to be allowed to join the League of Villains as its subsidiary. I also request to join the League itself.

SmallMight: Both requests accepted. 

SmallMight: You‚Äôll see the day when the president of the HPSC pays for her crimes and this country stops hating your kind. 

SmallMight: I promise you that much.

 

It would be nice to be able to be this optimistic.

Sawa Takeo: Also I can barely write because I almost got burned to death. Shit.

Akatani Mikumo: oof

Akatani Mikumo: Can you ask your Big Boss if the Vigilante Alliance is willing to become the League of Villains subsidiary group?

Sawa Takeo: ‚Ä¶ are you serious?

Sawa Takeo: We are literally hostiles, even now. 

Sawa Takeo: Vigilantes and villains are enemies by definition.

Akatani Mikumo: I know, I know

Akatani Mikumo: I‚Äôm not going to tell you to stop hunting Legion‚Äôs other subsidiaries

Akatani Mikumo: But Legion is a great fan of Knuckleduster (he was a late bloomer and Knuckleduster kicks ass without a quirk sooo‚Ä¶)

Akatani Mikumo: The general idea is that you will retain access to the Exchange and the Villain Industries (as regular potential clients, without said groups telling other villains what you were doing with them)

Akatani Mikumo: you are still allowed to do your vigilante things, and League will react to your operations like it does to any other attack on its facilities

Akatani Mikumo: you‚Äôre also not expected to share details about your operations unlike the regular members

Akatani Mikumo: In exchange the League will help if the Hero Commission/Overhaul/Re-Destro are against you (not regular heroes though) and will occasionally give you tips where to find our irritating underground competition and so on.

NapNeeded: I‚Äôm willing to do that, but if you don‚Äôt marry me.

IsOnMe: Awww. 

Principal: @SmallMight So, what are your gains in all of that? 

Principal: I think we established already that you benefit from every outcome of the coup. 

SmallMight: Table of Rejects and the Vigilante Alliance have officially become subsidiary groups of the League of Villains (although the latter under a rather specific set of rules). 

Ninja: I should be surprised. But I‚Äôm not.

TinTinCan: Of course.  

Principal: Oh dear.

SmallMight: Whoever wasn‚Äôt interested in being at the government's mercy will continue fighting against said government‚Ä¶ but under rules similar to QEM. So no mass killings, and in general only attacking actually ‚Äòlegal‚Äô targets. It will take the Table a while to start organizing itself in any way, though. They took a beating.  

SmallMight: I‚Äôm secretly rather happy that the Commission killed Shishido, because I‚Äôm like 99% sure he would join the Inhuman Supremacy Party. 

SmallMight: Like many of the KILL-THEM-ALL faction of the Table will. 

SmallMight: what about the post-coup clean-up?

Principal: The president seems unwilling to fight against All Might and me in her current state, so it seems that her new toys (‚ÄòParagons‚Äô it seems) are standing down. The Table forces are doing the same. 

Principal: Even the ‚Äòmissing UA students‚Äô are back, though Hound Dog is suspiciously absent. 

Principal: I don‚Äôt expect to see him again, save for the wanted posters. At least until we manage to take the HPSC down and get some reasonable government to do a general amnesty. 

SmallMight: I should probably find him and hire him as League‚Äôs exclusive therapist, sigh

TinTinCan: This is actually a very good idea, all things considered.

SmallMight: In the meantime, we can only hope. 

SmallMight: and probably plan another coup idk

TinTinCan: One is enough

SmallMight: awww, I was already thinking on how to make the second one better

Mastermind and his command post departed first. Together with one of the three Eclipse copies that Overhaul created.

Discovery that identical warp quirks do not interfere with each other (or, to be exact, that the range of warp interference is pitifully small) was a great and useful one. 

Mastermind lodged himself somewhere deep in Japan, but with a good internet connection. He needed to coordinate fifteen different strike teams, each supposed to attack a different target at a more or less same time. Not to mention the evacuation bit - it was going to be a logistical nightmare. 

The second part of his force to depart were said strike teams. Each composed of a single Purified, few dozen former QLF troopers, a crowd of villains from subsidiary groups of the PLF and a handful of 1st and 2nd Gen noumus. They were tasked with attacking fifteen notable prisons throughout Japan, in order to stage one of the greatest mass breakouts in the history of Mankind. 

They were, in the end, distractions. Useful ones, but distractions. Oh, their success was almost certain, and the liberated villains would sow chaos as the Paranormal Liberation Front intended. But it wasn‚Äôt a necessity for the next stage of the PLF‚Äôs grand strategy to be a resounding success. 

Overhaul‚Äôs army (no other words could describe it at this point) was the last group to depart. Close to seven thousand QLF soldiers. Seventy five first gen Noumus. Ten second gen Noumus. Nine third gen noumus. One hundred Purified. Dozens of pieces of heavy military hardware, donated so generously by the quirkless liberation groups worldwide. 

It was going to be enough for their target. Probably. He was about to assault the most guarded location in the world, or at the very least in Asia. It was going to be bloody, but he was alright with bloody. 

He stepped through the warpgate among the first ones. Transporting his entire army was going to take dozens of minutes. Hours, maybe. He had to be here, to command the vanguard. Vanguard that should be enough to realize most of the objective - in all honesty, the rest of the army was going to be there to respond to the unavoidable intervention of the League of Villains and the UA. 

They were going to show up a few minutes after the alarm was sounded. But‚Ä¶ it didn‚Äôt matter. He was going to warp in his entire army and then engage dozens of portable warp coordinate scramblers. Enough to make the entire region impossible to be warped to. Needing to rush towards him from the outside of the afflicted area should buy him enough time.

(throughout the country, prisons for the most dangerous villains are attacked almost simultaneously. Heroes response is delayed - many of them think that it‚Äôs part of the coup at first, and it takes them precious minutes to sortie after they understand that it‚Äôs not this.)

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ this is Tartarus.‚Äù Overhaul says, while calmly observing the unassailable fortress in front of him. The house of several thousands of the most violent and dangerous criminals not only from Japan but also from many other countries. The world‚Äôs most secure prison. 

Spreading this amalgamation of diseases among the general population is against his principles. But he‚Äôll do it this time. He needs to. 

This day will be the last one in the history of Japan. 
Notes:

    Well, you certainly can't say that Overhaul doesn't plan big. Also yeah, you're about to find out wtf the Purified are.

Chapter Text

Tartarus is a special place. There is no other location like that in the world - there are many inescapable prisons for the worst of the worst (or, in some unfortunate countries, for the best of the best), but there is just a single Tartarus. 

The bulk of the facility is located one kilometer off the coast of Japan. Only the uppermost layer extends over the waters - the remaining three are under it or, in case of the third one, are located under the bottom of the sea. 

The surface layer is the biggest one. It houses close to seven thousand A-Rank villains (and some choice B-Ranks whose crimes were sufficiently terrible). It has several blocks concentrated around the central spire, which is a fortress within a fortress - its twenty meters tall walls made from the hardest materials that Japan had access to house the command center of the entire prison, barracks for the wardens, on-site hospital, and enough weapons and combat robots to wage and win a small war. 

It‚Äôs not often, but sometimes one of the inmates from this level gets to leave the prison. Save for a single block (the one for the most insane and deadly of the A-Rankers), the uppermost layer is a simple, if high security, prison. There are quirk suppressors and ever watchful wardens, but the inmates get to stretch their legs a bit. 

There are no such privileges for those housed in the segments hidden under the surface - save for some choice exceptions, typically brought by extremely good behaviour and some attenuating circumstances. The first underwater segment houses one thousand seventy-four S-Rank villains, including a bit more than a hundred of those from Japan. 

The United States, Korea, the Siberian Federation and even the European Alliance (to a smaller degree) all contributed to the number - Tartarus is the world‚Äôs highest security prison, and Japan bought a lot of political favors by taking in inmates from the other countries. 

Beneath that level lies the second underwater segment, this time housing two-hundred twenty-four SS-Rank villains, with twenty-two from that number being Japanese. Villains of this rank are typically executed after capture (just like majority of S-Ranks), but there are some for whom execution is seen as a form of mercy they do not deserve. And some who are seen as not deserving death for exactly opposite reasons - their accomodation on this level varies greatly, but not the security tightness around their cells. 

Situation of the seventy-two SSS-Rank villains housed in the underground level of Tartarus is similar. Although only twelve of those are Japanese, almost uniformly former All for One‚Äôs lieutenants captured by the All Might during his long war against his fated nemesis. 

The entire facility is defended by two thousand wardens, seventy-five heroes stationed there permanently and numerous combat robots and automatic security measures. Wardens and heroes alike come from multiple countries, and have their past screened with extreme attention to details. Even the slightest sign of past misbehaviour is enough for the Head Warden to refuse an application. 

But that‚Äôs merely a single part of the Tartarus defenses. The waters surrounding are permanently patrolled by a detachment of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. Sonars constantly scan the underwater for any signs of an attack. Ships themselves are armed to the teeth (with both conventional weaponry and water-oriented heroes) and only give the approaching ships a single warning before annihilating them if they do not change their course. 

The only alternative way of accessing the prison are two kilometre-long bridges connecting the facility with the mainland. However, there is another layer of defense there. An escapee that would manage to cross the bridge would have found himself in the middle of the last remaining base of the ground forces of the JSDF. Surrounded by ten thousand soldiers, armed with the best of the conventional weaponry that was created before quirks made those obsolete.

And it‚Äôs not like it was just a ‚Äònormal‚Äô military base, as it would be understood by someone from a centuries past. Like Tartarus itself, the entire base was a labyrinth of concrete and steel, overseen by the automatic gun turrets and artillery towers. Less a base and more a massive and interconnected network of bunkers, designed to force the enemy forces to divide itself between core bastions, and then whittle their numbers in numerous killing fields. 

Tartarus was designed to withstand every imaginable assault. Unfortunately, the one that Overhaul organized was anything but imaginable. 

 

***

The first thing that happened was the technopathic attack. This time performed not by a single trigger-boosted quirk bearer - but by twenty trigger-boosted quirk bearers. The Tartarus‚Äô security was naturally improved after the Training Camp battle, but not to this degree. 

Throughout the facility the security gates opened up, automatic turrets went highwire and opened fire on the allies, artillery turrets exploded due to induced mishandling of its ammo stockpiles, the communication networks died down, robots began to rampage and hundreds of cells stood wide open, unleashing the monsters imprisoned inside.

Not all of them had their quirk suppressor disabled, and even then the overwhelming majority of the escapees were from the A-Rank block. But it still occupied the attention of the wardens. Just as PLFs‚Äô main forces emerged from the forest surrounding the JSDF base. Artillery rounds began to rain on it, just as dozens of tanks (some made according to designs that predated the birth of quirks) rolled towards the concrete walls of the fortress, accompanied by the noumus. 

Turrets and towers that survived the technopathic attack returned fire. Ships in the distance began to launch sea-to-ground missiles. The battle started.

Tanks and noumus were a good distraction. Defenders of the outer walls of Tartarus didn‚Äôt notice Overhaul himself and a hundred of his Purified marching behind the first line of attack until it was too late.

Nedzu didn‚Äôt expect to have his day interrupted by a phone call. Especially not from the president of the HPSC. And even more especially not right now, when he was busy trying to clean up after the unfortunately failed coup. 

He entertained the idea of not answering it. His day was already pretty bad at this point. Sure, throwing expletives at that witch would be enjoyable, but having to hear her voice‚Ä¶ Was it really worth it? 

He was way too busy trying to find a way to protect people like Tsuyu Asui from going to jail for doing the right thing. Due to the very person that was now calling him. 

In the end, he picks it up. He isn‚Äôt sure why. 

‚ÄúWhat is it, you‚Ä¶‚Äù He chirps in, only to be brutally interrupted.

‚ÄúOVERHAUL IS ATTACKING VILLAIN PRISONS EVERYWHERE!‚Äù The president shouts at him, in an obvious panic. Nedzu freezes even before his mind computes the words. The tone itself, it‚Äôs something he never heard. It‚Äôs something he never expects her to use in public, and especially when contacting her archenemy. ‚ÄúINCLUDING TARTARUS! SEND EVERYONE YOU HAVE, NOW!‚Äù 

Oh dear.

Izuku is busy telling his younger brother that he will meet his idol soon (Asa is overjoyed but also worried, then again when exactly he ISN‚ÄôT worried?), when the message comes.

 

Principal: EMERGENCY SORTIE

Principal: OVERHAUL IS ATTACKING NO LESS THAN FIFTEEN HIGH SECURITY PRISONS THROUGHOUT JAPAN

Principal: INCLUDING TARTARUS

 

Well, shit. 

Izuku‚Äôs panic reaches new heights when they gather up only to discover that the nearest place where Kurogiri can drop anyone is fifteen kilometers away from Tartarus. 

It takes him, Nedzu and Sir Nighteye five minutes of intense internet debate to agree on a plan. All Might, Lemillion, Edgeshot, Best Jeanist, Crust and every single member of the UA faculty (sans Lunch Rush and Power Loader) are warped to the edge of the warp coordinate scramblers range together with some cars. All Might and Lemillion rush ahead, faster than conventional vehicles, while the rest follows suit. 

Neither group gets very far before they encounter the PLF‚Äôs rearguard, including several third gen noumus. 

Izuku is waiting impatiently for Power Loader, Gremlin and David Shield to succeed in their own operation.

Kai Yoshiyuki is a relic. 

He knows about it. He is the lieutenant general in charge of the 1st Division of the Ground Self-Defence Forces of Japan - which makes him the commanding officer of the entire GSDF, because at this point it‚Äôs just that single division. He is fairly sure that after he retires or dies, the whole thing will be disbanded. 

He is also quirkless. A relic in another way, man who climbed high in the time when the quirkless weren‚Äôt discriminated against that badly. 

His combat experience is minimal. But he fought tooth and nail to keep his forces in reasonable combat preparedness. There were many exercises. He knows the theory, and trained the practise a lot. 

He knows that this battle is hopeless. 

The walls held against the enemy vanguard. The second wave was unstoppable, however. He has no idea what those damnable THINGS are, but they tore through the walls like they were made from paper. He saw one of them tear off a tank‚Äôs turret with its bare hands. He saw another stand after getting hit directly by an artillery turret. 

He doesn‚Äôt think that the defenders managed to destroy (‚Äòkill‚Äô is too weak of a word for abomination like those, even if they look like humans) even a single one of those. Now they were tearing through the base, followed by the regular infantry and the noumus. Those could be resisted, but the monstrosities left only dead, wounded and scattered soldiers in their wake. 

His soldiers did their best. This wasn‚Äôt enough. And the support fire from the ships was growing thin, as they were sunk or forced to retreat by the enemy artillery. 

The battle is hopeless. But he still has a duty to uphold. And a history to end in a way that will make him feel ashamed to stand in front of his ancestors and predecessors.

He contacts his best friend - the head warden of Tartarus - and tells him that he will buy him as much time as possible. Then he says his last words to his soldiers through whatever remains of the base communication network, and gathers his command unit, before leading it into combat. 

The 1st Division of the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force stops existing as an organized fighting force ten minutes later. Out of 10 000 soldiers that participated in the battle, close to half died while the rest were either overlooked by the enemy or managed to escape. 

 

***

Takano Ryuu, the head warden of Tartarus, has no time to grieve. He knows that help is coming. He knows that All Might is battling it out there, but he sees the army storming the facility. Army that stands between the prison and the rescue force. 

All Might is powerful. Indomitable. But he is alone, or with only a handful of other heroes. They will not get to Tartarus in time. The technopathic attack has already deactivated Tartarus‚Äô warp scramblers. The enemy can simply warp the rescued prisoners from the prison. 

The only warp scramblers left are those of the PLF. And they are set to not interfere with their warpers. 

Thousands of quirkless soldiers in exchange for thousands of high-ranking criminals? He would make that trade, if he was Overhaul. The PLF will use their main forces to distract the relief force long enough, even if it will have to send them out as suicide bombers. 

Takano Ryuu wishes that he had other options. But he has none. Not today. Not when the heroes throughout the country just bled themselves almost dry. 

He blows up the bridges connecting the Tartarus with the mainland, trying not to think of the soldiers that were fleeing through it (PLF vanguard was there too, which made it slightly less painful). Then he switches on the intercom. 

‚ÄúThis is the head warden speaking.‚Äù He says. His voice is calm and collected, although internally he is screaming. He doesn‚Äôt want to do it. He would have killed himself on the spot if it could have stopped what‚Äôs coming. ‚ÄúCode-Red. Tartarus under attack by an overwhelming force. Perspective of reinforcements unlikely. Purge protocol in effect. I take full responsibility.‚Äù 

Thirty seconds later the entire segment of the prison inhabited by SSS-Rank villains is flooded. Seventy-two monsters to equal Overhaul drown to death during the next few minutes. Segments for S and SS-ranks villains are already too influenced by the Overhaul‚Äôs technopaths for their automatic purge systems to work. There the wardens need to get their hands dirty. 

 

***

Overhaul is furious when his hacking unit tells him about the wardens starting to purge the prison. 

This wasn‚Äôt part of the plan. He heard whispers that this was an option, he just never expected the government to actually do it. To kill thousands of prisoners to deny them freedom. 

He is always surprised when someone equals him in ruthlessness. 

He injects himself with enough of his special trigger and overhauls what‚Äôs left of the bridge connecting Tartarus to the mainland. This time with no hidden explosives. He has his Purified storm forward, crossing the almost kilometer distance in several seconds.

His warpers move strike teams to the A-Rank blocks, circumnavigating the fortress defenses entirely. He learned something about tactical usage of the warp quirks from Legion‚Äôs exploits. They overwhelm their defenders through a surprise attack and begin to warp the rescued inmates to one of the many mustering grounds throughout Japan.

‚ÄúWE FOUND IT!‚Äù Gremlin shouts while running into the room. On her face a mixture of pride and happiness. ‚ÄúI HAVE THE COORDINATES!‚Äú 

Sir Nighteye and Nedzu said that if Overhaul is attacking the Tartarus directly, then he certainly isn‚Äôt the overall commander of this operation. They hoped to trace the PLF‚Äôs base through that, but judging from the coordinates leading to a place in Japan, chances were minimal.

Kurogiri warps the entire League (sans Miruko, who is yet to be invited to the base) right in front of the Mastermind‚Äôs command post. 

Seeing them emerge from the blackness is the last push. Mastermind runs away, screaming in terror and guilt as his compatriots are slaughtered mercilessly.

All Might and Lemillion finally manage to dispose of the third gen noumus. They know that they are fighting against brainwashed children. This dampens these punches and limits their strength. 

They both know they shouldn‚Äôt. They know that if Tartarus is broken wide, the results will be disastrous. But even then, they can‚Äôt. They are heroes. They need to save people, and they have victims of some of the most horrible crimes known to Mankind in front of them. 

They incapacitate the noumus. It isn‚Äôt easy when each of them is carrying multiple quirks - two seem to be children of Gigantomachia, at least judging from insane physical strength and endless endurance. But they lack training. That can be used against them.

Once that happens, the two One for All users rush towards the Tartarus prison. They arrive five minutes too late. 

 

***

‚ÄúDo you‚Ä¶ uuugh‚Ä¶ like them?‚Äù Overhaul asks as he enters the Tartarus command headquarters. ‚ÄúI call them‚Ä¶ the Purified.‚Äù 

Four of those monstrosities enter the room through the hole in the wall behind him. Head warden is lying on the ground, his leg impaled on a spike that emerged from the floor when Overhaul touched it. His command staff is either dead, dying or fled. 

‚ÄúTurns out‚Ä¶ uuugh‚Ä¶ that if you scrape quirks out of people‚Ä¶ you can use their quirk factors for oh so many interesting things.‚Äù Overhaul decides to gloat. ‚ÄúJust a small injection before the battle‚Ä¶ uuugh‚Ä¶ and they can use multiple quirks temporarily. Lesser strain than permanent quirks. I can give them, uuugh, whatever quirks I want them to, for as long as I have access to‚Ä¶ uuugh‚Ä¶ Garaki‚Äôs quirk samples. Or fresh blood.‚Äù Overhaul laughs lightly and sickly. ‚ÄúWhat you witnessed today‚Ä¶ was Muscular muscle augmentation for strength and endurance‚Ä¶ Moonfish teeth manipulation for anti-personnel attacks‚Ä¶. and, uuugh, Wolfram‚Äôs metal manipulation to tear through the walls, tanks and turrets at ease. Multiplied by one hundred. And further boosted with carefully selected doses of my special trigger.‚Äù 

‚ÄúCongratulations.‚Äù Head warden chuckles bitterly. ‚ÄúContinue your villain monologue in hell.‚Äù 

Overhaul doesn‚Äôt stop him from drawing his gun. Head warden puts its barrel to his own temple and pulls the trigger. 

Only the head warden of the Tartarus and the president of the Hero Commission are aware of the last failsafe of the Tartarus Prison. One that is to be used only in the direst of circumstances. Established because if the prison was ever opened fully, Japan and everyone in it would be doomed. Together with the large part of Asia. 

When an implant in the head-warden‚Äôs heart announces that his heartbeat stopped, something connects to the Tartarus network. It immediately confirms that code-red was announced, that the purge protocol was in effect and that less than 50% of wardens were still alive. Then it activates something else. 

Overhaul is still wondering why the head warden didn‚Äôt try to shoot him when the fifteen kiloton nuclear warhead placed directly under the Tartarus command center explodes, incinerating him and everyone else in the prison. 

 

***

All Might and Lemillion gawk in shock when the Tartarus Prison ceases to exist. The unleashed energy is strong enough to topple them both when it reaches them. The remaining PLF soldiers and the survivors of the 1st Division are way less lucky. 

They can only wonder what happened to Overhaul. And how many prisoners did the PLF manage to evacuate before the explosion. 

(thousands)

 

***

They eventually manage to corner Mastermind after chasing him through a few buildings. He is in clear panic (Izuku finds it odd, considering what Incense told him about him), and is quite fast on his feet. 

That alone wouldn‚Äôt be enough. They are THE League of Villains, an assortment of some of the most dangerous people in Japan. But the Mastermind‚Äôs command post was guarded. Imaginer, S-Rank serial killer and the head of the House of Red, with a powerful quirk allowing him to animate tattoos and drawings (and he was prepared for an attack). Pain and Infection, an A and S-Ranks left from the Creature Rejection Clan. Several A-Rankers from House of Red and a crowd of CRC soldiers. 

This is a massacre. Not entirely one-sided. If not Izuku carrying Overhaul‚Äôs quirk, they would have lost Toxicity and perhaps Spinner. To this day Izuku has no idea why All for One identifies Overhaul as a Class-Five quirk rather than Class-Six one. But even then, it's a lengthy massacre. 

Mastermind would have probably managed to escape, if they didn‚Äôt have Awoo. Mastermind was bleeding (another thing that Izuku found odd, they didn‚Äôt wound him so why?), and that made tracking him easier. 

Mastermind looks barely older than Izuku. He is panting heavily, cornered in a half-finished building. He is unlikely to jump through the nearest window (this is a fourth floor, they chased him up here), so this is the end of his road. He is still clutching a revolver. He has nasty scratch wounds on his wrists. 

Something is wrong, Izuku decides. Mastermind doesn‚Äôt look like a man who blew up thirty of his own men to kill (however temporarily) Kurogiri. 

He raises his hand. Stain and Mr. Compress halt their advance. Mastermind stares at them all in visible horror. 

Izuku needs time to unpack what‚Äôs happening. He refuses to rush in blindly. Gun technically isn‚Äôt that much of a problem, unless Mastermind is a Snipe-level marksman and puts a bullet between Izuku‚Äôs eyes. But Stain is in the right position and Izuku is certain that if Mastermind raises the gun, Stain will step between him and Legion.

Mastermind looks terrified, guilty and on the verge of crying. Guilty. Why guilty?

Puzzles fail into the right places. Izuku is equally shocked and disgusted. Purity is dead, but in moments like these he wishes that Asa didn‚Äôt kill her. She missed Legion‚Äôs personal anger management session with her as a guest star. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your quirk, right?‚Äù Izuku asks. Mastermind‚Äôs head perks up. ‚ÄúIt makes you smarter‚Ä¶ but also emotionless. Ready to sacrifice people you care about to achieve your goals.‚Äù 

He can see tears on his cheeks. Mastermind nods scarcely. He looks to be too emotional to be able to speak. 

For how many hours was he using his quirk? Observing the coup and analyzing it for Overhaul. And then overseeing the logistics of the biggest mass prison break-out in the history of the world. At some point, even if Overhaul used his trigger on him, he must have reached the point where his quirk shutdown on itself. Freeing the man that it kept imprisoned for who knows how long.

Probably at least partially thanks to the shock that was the League‚Äôs arrival. Izuku saw his face for a split second after that, still emotionless and with vacant eyes, before Mastermind suddenly turned his back on them and started to flee. 

Purity had Infection ‚Äòhandle him‚Äô for the time being, because Mastermind never truly wanted to be the head of the CRC. He was extremely useful as a commander, but needed a handler to keep him straight. 

She probably hoped that if he killed enough people for her, he would finally ‚Äòcome around‚Äô and accept her and the CRC. If only due to having no other option at this point. 

Hating someone who is already dead is rarely not a pointless endeavor. Unless the object of your anger is Overhaul. But Izuku still feels alright hating her. 

‚ÄúI know someone with a very special quirk, Mastermind.‚Äù Izuku says, trying to sound as non-threateningly as possible. He even kneels a bit, just to make himself look less‚Ä¶ intimidatingly. If he even looks intimidating. Sources are conflicted. ‚ÄúSomeone who can take and give quirks. He can take yours and give you some normal one. He can save you from this. Just please, put down your gun.‚Äù 

He talks about himself. He doesn‚Äôt know how much Overhaul told Mastermind about Izuku‚Äôs quirk, so he comes with some unspecified third person. He certainly isn‚Äôt giving his father a quirk that, when activated, will change him into a super-genius with even less care for others. He isn‚Äôt suicidal.

He forgot that he isn‚Äôt facing Mastermind now. Mastermind would have analyzed available data in a few seconds and decided that Izuku is probably honest. But the young adult/teenager (16-18, hard to say) in front of him isn‚Äôt a super-genius. But someone who was exploited for his quirk and forced to do horrible things. And now, he feels, he is about to be forced to do even more horrible things with his quirk, just by different people. 

Izuku curses himself for not asking Mindscrew to find a way to make Mastermind talk in order to trap him with Hitoshi‚Äôs quirk. He screams and lunges forward when Mastermind puts the gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. He doesn‚Äôt make it in time, obviously. 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Izuku is furious. At Purity, at Mastermind and at everyone else. He is just furious in general. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt ending like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúIzuku‚Ä¶‚Äù Stain is trying to say something, but Izuku doesn‚Äôt care. He approaches Mastermind‚Äôs lifeless body and overhauls him back to life. Then he kicks the gun away, just in case the Mastermind‚Äôs quirk kicked back and somehow interfered with the post-death vacant state. 

It did. Mastermind has a weird look on his face, but still tries to lunge towards the gun. To kill himself again or to defend himself? Probably the latter. Izuku pins him to the ground and breaks his limbs with his quirk. 

Mastermind stops struggling. He knows he lost. He is probably calculating ways of influencing them with his words, or how to make them recruit him instead of executing him. Izuku doesn‚Äôt care about that. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a shit about your opinion on this, Mastermind.‚Äù Izuku says, anger visible on his face. ‚ÄúI decided that I‚Äôm going to save you, so I AM going to save you. Don‚Äôt you fucking dare resist.‚Äù 

He turns his head towards Stain. 

‚ÄúCarry him back.‚Äù Izuku is tired. Not in the right state to steal a quirk against someone whose willpower is probably boosted by his quirk. He will do that tomorrow. 

He sincerely hopes that the Tartarus battle ended up as good as his attack on Mastermind‚Äôs command post, but he is almost certain that reality isn‚Äôt as nice as he would like it to be.

Overhaul is dead.

Izuku stares at the words on the TV and is trying to comprehend what he is seeing. Overhaul, his archnemesis (and not in the friendly way like he has it with Lemillion) hugged a nuclear bomb and was now traveling with a police convoy down the highway to Hell (because in Izuku‚Äôs opinion, even demons if they existed were rather wary of Kai Chisaki). 

He pressed the head warden of Tartarus enough for him to nuke himself and everything in the vicinity. The last reports from the prison suggested that the PLF failed to breach the S-Rank block, much less those placed deeper. The estimates of A-Rank villains that the PLF got out varied between dozens and thousands, but those were villains. Not supervillains. 

Dangerous enough for the state of emergency to be proclaimed throughout the country (not fully legally, Mr. Compress still didn‚Äôt give the government back), and for heroes to be on a watchout. But if even the S-Rank prison was breached (much less the deeper segments of Tartarus), the current chaos would be amplified tenfold. 

He is still standing there, dazed, when the new villain rankings are announced. Almost all active supervillains are working for him. The only exception is the Meta-Liberation Army (probably his another target, because Gremlin) and the sole remaining notable head of the Paranormal Liberation Front-aligned group - Beast. 

His mom was now an SS-Rank villain. She was probably happy and proud from her one-time gig. Unless she was already planning to occasionally join Mr. Compress further‚Ä¶ performances. That was an option. Izuku was 99% sure that her old fanclubs just sprung back to life. 

What followed was a long list of incarcerated, killed or promoted A-Rank villains. Rabbit almost fell down the couch when he heard that he is now an A-Rank villain. Toxicity and Juggernaut were classified like that as well. In fact, no active member of the League WASN‚ÄôT at least an A-Ranker. 

It was unbelievable. 

‚ÄúDid we‚Ä¶‚Äù Izuku manages to speak in the resulting silence. ‚Äú...did we just win the war?‚Äù 

And did he just become a Symbol of Evil? He still had to deal with the MLA and some remnants of the PLF, but other than that‚Ä¶

He should probably do something about the UA, ugh. 

 

***

SmallMight: OMG

SmallMight: Did we just win?

Principal: The casualties are nothing sort of horrible and the criminal activity will no doubt skyrocket, but the MLA is the only remaining group capable and willing of waging a regular war against the country.

Principal: So‚Ä¶ yes?

TinTinCan: End of an alliance?

SmallMight: DON‚ÄôT BE SO HASTY LEMILLION

SmallMight: He already died once AND we have potentially thousands of A-Rankers everywhere. Who might or might not reform themselves into some new large group/reorganize the PLF as a whole. 

SmallMight: I suggest working on our own from now on, BUT maintaining this communication channel plus one month long extension on the non-aggression treaty between the League and the UA

Principal: I believe that I speak for everyone when I agree to that. 

SmallMight: Let‚Äôs figure out what sort of fallout we‚Äôre dealing with, and then decide what we all do next.

TinTinCan: ‚Ä¶ was that a pun?

SmallMight: What? 

SmallMight: FALLOUT

SmallMight: SHIT NOT INTENTIONAL

TinTinCan: good, too many people died to make fun of it, ugh

TinTinCan: I‚Äôm tired. And probably slightly irradiated.

TinTinCan: Off to Recovery Girl. 

SmallMight: I feel bad for her, she has to deal with the weirdest of damages known to Mankind in her line of work.

 

***

‚ÄúI have committed an ultimate mistake.‚Äù Izuku deadpans, half-sitting and half-lying on a couch in the living room. He is truly, truly done with the world. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not that bad!‚Äù Asa is there, trying his best to cheer him up. Rabbit knows what‚Äôs the reason for Izuku being on the verge of dying. He is only a bit less close to said verge himself, but he is still doing his best for his older brother.

Two days passed since the Tartarus battle. The world outside was surprisingly peaceful, if you exclude the occasional radiation alerts when changing winds carried clouds of irradiated dust over some city. 

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù It‚Äôs Dabi, oddly enough. The room is mostly empty (it‚Äôs evening already, so people either went to sleep earlier or are still recovering from the last battle). 

‚ÄúI invited Miruko and showed her the headquarters.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúShe likes our training room. Especially when I mentioned how I can resurrect people if they die there, and our little Rabbit can cure exhaustion. She has been inside with Stain for seventeen hours straight, and I‚Äôm slowly dying on the inside from quirk exhaustion.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôre officially fucked then.‚Äù Dabi announces after a few seconds of stunned silence. 

‚ÄúYeah, I should probably tell them to stop.‚Äù Izuku sighs and closes his eyes. ‚ÄúOr invite Rappa and Knuckleduster before those two get murdermarried in there or something. Actually, could you go and ask them to stop in my ste‚Ä¶‚Äù He opens his eyes to see that Dabi is no longer there. ‚ÄúWELL FUCK YOU DABI!‚Äù 

 

***

SmallMight: Pretty please?

Maxi-Miruko: ‚Ä¶ did you just fucking ask me to be your adopted aunt?

SmallMight: LEAGUE IS ONE BIG AND JUST SLIGHTLY FUCKED-UP FAMILY

SmallMight: I NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU ARE ON OUR FAMILY TREE

SmallMight: Also Mini-Miruko needs some‚Ä¶ positive influences from his family. 

SmallMight: also I don‚Äôt have an aunt since Thunderbolt killed the one from my mother‚Äôs side

Maxi-Miruko: I regret certain decisions.

SmallMight: oof

Maxi-Miruko: You know, alright. I‚Äôll fucking do it.

SmallMight: YES

Maxi-Miruko: I‚Äôm going to be the best motherfucking aunt you can imagine. 

SmallMight: Mini-Miruko will be overjoyed!

SmallMight: Also I talked with Rappa, he is looking forward to your‚Ä¶ visit to his Fight Club. 

Maxi-Miruko: He has a fight club?

SmallMight: yeah but it‚Äôs first rule is to not talk about it

Maxi-Miruko: did you seriously just fucking referenced that film on me

SmallMight: I KNEW YOU WATCHED IT

SmallMight: Also I‚Äôm a villain so I‚Äôm breaking rules and so on

Maxi-Miruko: WAIT A FUCKING SECOND

Maxi-Miruko: You wanted to bribe me with Fight Club if I didn‚Äôt agree to being your adopted aunt?

SmallMight: Mmmm yesn‚Äôt? 

Maxi-Miruko: ‚Ä¶ 

 

***

Mastermind resisted the quirk-stealing procedure with all his might. In all honesty, this was way harder than what Izuku did to Eclipse. But Legion was a patient supervillain. After thirty minutes of struggles he was left alone with a sobbing young man, finally freed from the quirk that changed his life into hell. 

In all honesty, it didn‚Äôt have to be like that. The quirk was a full-blown Class-Five intelligence quirk. In a way, it changed Mastermind‚Äôs brain into a living supercomputer. All he needed was someone who was less of a dick as a handler, and he wouldn‚Äôt grow to hate it. And if there was a person next to him that would teach him how to control it, and switch it on and off‚Ä¶ Well, water under the bridge now. 

Izuku decided that he isn‚Äôt going to risk activating that quirk. He was way too powerful to risk going into an emotionless and goal-focused genius mode. What if the Living Computer (Mastermind never named it, so he did) make him decide that someone from the League is a threat and would make him commit a murder on a family member?

He decided to hand it to someone already dying (from natural causes, for example - Overhaul‚Äôs quirk can‚Äôt handle old age). Probably in exchange for their quirk. To let the Living Computer die. 

When Mastermind calmed down a bit, Izuku had a long and serious talk. In the end, the League got a new member‚Ä¶ with an old quirk. And probably some much-needed villain name change.

 

***

SmallestMight: Just gave someone your quirk

ThinkFast12: oh? Someone I know?

SmallestMight: nope

SmallestMight: but he had a really ugly and debilitating natural quirk so I went for a quick switcheroo

SmallestMight: also he is Zealot‚Äôs younger brother

ThinkFast12: awesome!

ThinkFast12: I really like Slow-Mo, you know?

SmallestMight: gives you even more time to create crazy conspiracy theories on a spot, Musty?

ThinkFast12: MY HATE GROWS

SmallestMight: CULTIVATE IT AND GET READY FOR HARVEST

Split didn‚Äôt like the Paranormal Liberation Front.

Let‚Äôs be honest, the majority of Japan probably didn‚Äôt like it. Sure, they saved her from the Tartarus and warped her out of it before someone apparently FUCKING NUKED the place. But they were clearly an utterly deranged band of ugly fucknuggets, and she didn‚Äôt like the look Beast gave her. 

His‚Ä¶ tastes were well-known. Especially when you were a former pro-hero (okay, JUST A PROVISIONAL LICENCE BUT IT WAS ALMOST THE REAL DEAL, RIGHT? Things went to hell like a week before she was going to get her real license). She read the police reports. 

She expected someone to stop her, but the PLF-owned camp hidden in the middle of nowhere was barely guarded. She just walked out of it and somehow managed to find her way to the nearest town. 

She wasn‚Äôt that much known, and the government still wasn‚Äôt sure who survived the bigboom. There were thousands of new wanted posters. It was easy to vanish in the crowd (like ‚Öî of which were probably an irradiated dust at this point). 

Split sneaked around the town for a while, enough to swipe someone‚Äôs phone and search the internet for a while. 

SHE WAS AWAY FOR TWO YEARS, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO JAPAN IN THE MEANTIME?!

Endeavor, Thunderbolt, Shishido and Hawks dead? Miruko and Gang Orca were now villains?! She only recognized them, Mr. Compress, Beast and the MLA members from the list of supervillains. What happened to Eclipse? To Purity? 

ALSO MISCHIEF WAS BACK AND AS AN SS-RANK VILLAIN?! AND MR. COMPRESS WAS AN SSS-RANK?! What do you need to steal to become an SSS-Rank through bloodless thievery?! 

She googled it. The first article that came up was ‚ÄòPresident of the HPSC negotiates with Mr. Compress, when will the supervillain return the National Diet building and the Japanese government?‚Äô. 

Omfg. Mr. Compress stole the government. Yeah, that explained the designation. They would probably make him an SSSS-Rank villain if such a rank existed.

And the third remaining SSS-Rank villain was apparently an underage emperor of the underworld. Did the nuclear blast catch her during the warp and she was mysteriously propelled through the multiverse and landed in a completely different (and batshit crazy) world? 

She scrolled down the list of the supervillains, trying to figure out what the hell is the ‚ÄòLeague of Villains‚Äô. Oh, apparently the Legion‚Äôs organization. Yeah, that explains the ‚Äòemperor of the underworld‚Äô part. 

Split almost trips when she sees Mindscrew‚Äô photo. It‚Äôs Toshi.

HITOSHI SHINSOU IS A SUPERVILLAIN?! His list of villainous deeds includes murder of no less than forty people, plus an indirect murder of a similar number (apparently he was a commander of the ‚ÄòVanguard Action Squad of the League of Villains‚Äô, Legion‚Äôs personal attack dog unit). All victims were apparently villains. Save for his family. 

What. The. Hell. 

Well, she can probably understand the last bit. They kinda had it coming, she isn‚Äôt going to lie. Especially as she landed in Tartarus before she managed to gather the evidence and arrest them for what they did to Toshi. He probably got someone else to believe him through the internet. 

Someone who wasn‚Äôt a hero.

Well, fuck.

She checks out her old social media. She has a very recent message from him. Telling her that if she escaped Tartarus, then‚Ä¶

Huh. 

Well, maybe she‚Äôll get to ask him about what the hell happened when she was away. In person.

ClownUncle: I HAVE CONCLUDED THE NEGOTIATIONS

SmallMight: OH

Insomniac: WHAT DID YOU GET

ClownUncle: 300 billion yen paid to several known charity organizations (up front), and then calling off that atrocious register of villainous quirks and complex mutants (and the law in general). Oh and they will look the other way when I‚Äôll be filming my SPECTACULAR AUTOBIOGRAPHY (plus the trilogy of films about Legion‚Äôs life, when the right time comes). 

SmallMight: You do realize that you won‚Äôt get anything other than the money though

SmallMight: Since they‚Äôll have the government AND the National Diet back

ClownUncle: oh you poor unbeliever

ClownUncle: I POSSESS THE ULTIMATE ARGUMENT

SmallMight: Oh?

ClownUncle: In exchange for them keeping their word, I will NOT try to test how many Twice clones I need to steal Tokyo. 

SmallMight: OMFG

Insomniac: Jesus Christ xD

VampirePrincess: xDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Vantablack: Oh dear xD

SmallMight: I have created a monster.

ClownUncle: Maybe, but A TRULY SUBLIME AND WONDERFUL MONSTER

SmallMight: OK THAT‚ÄôS TRUE

ClownUncle: YEAH

SmallMight: Still an embarrassment for the family though.

ClownUncle: :<<<< 

Blueberry: Charities?

ClownUncle: DO NOT WORRY, I TOLD THEM TO PAY EQUAL NUMBER OF CASH FOR VILLAIN QUIRKED, COMPLEX MUTANTS AND THE QUIRKLESS

Blueberry: Awesome. You‚Äôre a man of culture, Mr. Compress.

ClownUncle: TOO BAD THAT LEGION DOESN‚ÄôT UNDERSTAND ME :<<<

Mini-Miruko: izuku said recently that you are an art piece

ClownUncle: OH?!

SmallMight: ‚Ä¶

Mini-Miruko: Just a modern art piece

ClownUncle: Okay now that‚Äôs uncalled for young midoriya, compare me to something actually valuable and aesthetically pleasing pls

SmallMight: DON‚ÄôT CALL ME YOUNG MIDORIYA YOU DAMN CLOWN

ClownUncle: THEN DON‚ÄôT DISRESPECT ME IN PUBLIC LIKE THAT OR I‚ÄôLL TELL YOUR MOM 

Blueberry: ‚Ä¶ seeing two of three most wanted people in the country act like that with each other is probably the weirdest thing ever

Insomniac: this entire chat is like 50% composed of supervillains at this point and they all act ‚Äòlike that‚Äô, just to a different degree

Blueberry: Fair

Chimera, Necromancer, Slice and Mummy all managed to escape the PLF camps rather easily. They were lightly guarded. In fact, they weren‚Äôt guarded at all. PLF was either dissolving or there was some sort of fourth dimensional plan in all of that. 

Their crew had a well-hidden hideout prepared in case something went really, horribly wrong. It was a safehouse under some ruined mansion in the middle of the woods, whose actual ownership has been something so complicated that nobody understood it anymore. 

They had food, water and some cash hidden there. Plus a spare copy of their villain uniforms. Enough to spend a week or two in hiding, and probably return to business. If there is a business to return to, now that Nine is gone. 

They spent four days there when one of the cameras outside spotted an approaching car. It was late evening, so they didn‚Äôt see who was inside. They quickly set up an ambush. No one should have any business coming here at that hour. 

The car stops before they leap at it. They can barely believe who emerges from it. 

‚ÄúNINE?!‚Äù Slice shouts in shock. This is almost certainly some form of illusion quirk, this is the only explanatio‚Ä¶ 

Nine calls in a thunder from the sky, which splits the nearby tree. There are no more questions about whether he is THEIR Nine. 

‚ÄúSorry for not getting here faster.‚Äù He says when they get closer. They start to believe, just‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI was in the prison hospital during the attack. One of the last to get warped away before the explosion.‚Äù 

They talk for a long time. In the end they decide that it‚Äôs probably time to change their business associates for some better ones. None of them have particularly pleasant memories about working with the PLF. 

 

***

Legion is actually positively surprised when the news reaches him through the Exchange. Nine and his team were alive AND wanted to work as League of Villains associates? Great. Honestly speaking, he kinda felt bad for them. They were all victims like LoV members, even if Izuku doesn‚Äôt exactly like the direction in which this fact pushed them. 

He describes the League policies to them, and gives them a series of jobs to do. Four PLF bases are raided by the heroes (the Nine and his group provided coordinates), who incarcerate seventy-two escaped A-Rank villains. Then he sends them on a raiding spree, targeting notable Detnerat installations. 

In a non-lethal way. He has them evacuate the personnel before blowing everything up. The insurance probably covers that, but he is certain that Detnerat will have to pay more for it now. Besides, Gremlin is happy and Izuku is willing to blow up several factories and office buildings to make her smile. 

Nine is back on the supervillain list after his first attack. Izuku wishes him best of luck. In the so-called meantime, the League just got another assault party. Although he doesn‚Äôt invite them to join in directly - they are just a subsidiary. His trust in people goes only so far.

Seven days after her escape from Tartarus, Split finally decides to make contact. She sneaks into an abandoned building in question. She finds a small box (with a code-lock) stuffed into some hard-to-find place. Just as Toshi said in his message. 

She knows the code. When she enters it, the box opens. Inside is a phone. With exactly one number on its contact list. She clicks on it, and braces for the worst. 

The building doesn‚Äôt explode on her. 

Instead the black mist suddenly envelops the other end of the room. She recognizes the yellow eyes in the mist. Kurogiri, the warpgate villain of the League of Villains. 

Toshi steps out of the mist, wearing a combat vest and some sort of black mask that covers everything under his eyes. He has a gun (like, an actual assault rifle although she doesn‚Äôt recognize the model) in his hands. 

‚ÄúSplit.‚Äù He says. The mask hides his expression from her. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great to see you alive.‚Äù He can actually speak. Did he lie to her in the past, or did someone bring his tongue back? Maybe it‚Äôs the mask? 

And now, the greatest test of trust. Speaking back to him. Willingly letting a villain (and a murderer of dozens of people at this point) be in a position to take control over her body. Then again, it‚Äôs Toshi. Everything around changed, and he did, but‚Ä¶ how much? 

‚ÄúLikewise.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt take control. Instead he comes closer and hugs her. She hugs him back. 

‚ÄúI heard what happened.‚Äù Split says a minute later, still eyeing Hitoshi curiously. Their brief hug ended already. It‚Äôs time for business. She didn't know that such a thing as regrowing a tongue was possible. Sure, there were wonderful quirks out there, but‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYour family, I mean.‚Äù 

Hitoshi looks conflicted by this being mentioned. Not ashamed, not happy, just‚Ä¶ conflicted. She finds it weird. 

‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù He says finally. ‚ÄúAfter you went to Tartarus, I‚Ä¶ snapped.‚Äù She can‚Äôt see it, but she is certain that he is gritting his teeth. ‚ÄúI found someone else to believe my words. They helped me, but‚Ä¶ they weren‚Äôt heroes. I don‚Äôt think I could believe in heroes after what happened to you.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI killed people.‚Äù Split replies. She knows what his answer will be. But after more than two years of Tartarus she just wants to hear it from him. 

‚ÄúBecause some asshole injected you with Trigger and had your quirk go out of control.‚Äù Hitoshi says the words she hoped to hear. ‚ÄúAnd because some asshole judge didn‚Äôt bother to understand what your quirk is about.‚Äù 

Now, the real question. How to move over to the real interesting question? Not like hearing that he is still in her corner (like, probably, one of the very few people out there) wasn‚Äôt interesting. Although it was perhaps more important than interesting, at least for her mental well-being? 

‚ÄúDid they‚Ä¶‚Äù She tries to say, but he interrupts. 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Hitoshi shakes his head. ‚ÄúLegion tried to persuade me not to kill them. Offered to expose what they did to me in public, to make people out there lynch them for me. But after you were arrested and I spent weeks thinking that my only hope to get out of that hell was taken away, I‚Ä¶ I think I just wanted them dead.‚Äù He is silent for a few seconds while she is swallowing his words. ‚ÄúHe obliged. And gave me my tongue back.‚Äù 

She failed him so much. Sure, she was merely a provisional license hero from a small-time school. But she was the only person who believed a kid claiming that his entire family was composed of monsters that cut their tongue out and pretty much kept them in a cage. While monitoring their internet usage (although not as successfully as they hoped for). 

When your crime is outrageous enough, people stop believing that it‚Äôs possible. Odd. But that‚Äôs how Mankind works, Split thinks. 

‚ÄúJoin the League, Split.‚Äù Hitoshi adds after a few more seconds, while she is still trying to figure out how to unpack his words. 

‚ÄúWh‚Ä¶ are you serious?‚Äù She retorts. He surprised her. Sure, she was a runaway, but she was still a (former) hero trainee. He can‚Äôt just‚Ä¶ They were a League of VILLAINS, after all. And if what she briefly googled was any indication, it was considered an SSS-Rank threat villain group. 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Hitoshi replies promptly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll like it. Almost every member has stories like mine. And thus far we‚Äôre only killing other villains and corrupted heroes. We killed Eclipse and Purity, can you believe that? Plus several more supervillains that emerged after you were arrested. And we‚Äôre going to go after Re-Destro now, most likely. ‚Äù 

She didn‚Äôt get to google that out. But someone did have to take those two psychos out, and it would certainly explain why the League was an SSS-Rank group despite literally not existing two years ago. Didn‚Äôt they start like seven months ago? 

Is she willing to believe him? They were kinda friends (mostly through the internet, though they met once or twice when she started to investigate his family for abuse, right before the tongue happened) once. And if she remembers the results of her brief visit on the internet a few days ago, he only killed his family‚Ä¶ and a lot of villains. 

Then again, what alternative does she have? Return to a prison? Not a nice prospect after two years of high security prison time. She could try to become a vigilante, but it‚Äôs not like she has any contacts with those. How long can she hope to stay active like that? 

No money. She was almost caught on her way here once, because she had to steal cash to buy tickets or hitch-hike her way through the country and people were EXTREMELY wary of hitch-hikers after the mass-breakout. No support items. No contacts. No hideouts. 

Ugh. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I have many alternatives at this point.‚Äù She sighs. ‚ÄúYou probably don‚Äôt know where to find some vigilantes for me to join, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúActually the Vigilante Alliance might be kinda working for my boss now.‚Äù He says and she stares at him in shock. ‚ÄúShit, forget I mentioned that. It‚Äôs supposed to be a secret.‚Äù He looks genuine in his slip. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say that there are many options on the table, but I would like you to be with us.‚Äù 

He simultaneously changed a lot and didn‚Äôt change at all. Confusing. 

Her lack of imaginable alternatives makes her nod and add a vocal agreement to at least see for herself what the League of Villains is about. She can only hope that she‚Äôll not overhear anything that will make them not want to let her go after that. If, of course, letting her go is even an option. 

She looks forward to not being homeless for a while, that‚Äôs for sure.
Notes:

    Split was eventually going to play a much bigger role in this fic, but the ending happened a bit earlier than I anticipated. Still, one more cool OC to my collection, things like that happen.

    And also MYSTERIOUS MIRUKO SHIP is taking off. Hate me all you want, but this is what peak Miruko Ship looks like. AND CAN YOU IMAGINE THEIR CHILDREN?! I'm absolutely terrified of the concept but also intrigued.

Chapter Text

The League of Villains‚Äô headquarters look like some weird boarding house. Just with less windows and more style. Or at least that‚Äôs the first thing that comes to Split‚Äôs mind when she exits the warpgate. 

She is in the middle of the living room. There is a bar, and a lot of couches, tables and TVs scattered throughout it.  She sees some gaunt man and a girl with wolf ears playing some newest Mortal Kombat game (they have their backs towards her, but judging from the movements of her tail, she seems to be very happy). Then she notices a girl with blue and pink hair playing some card game with a small kid with messy black hair, a nervous looking young man in a black T-Shirt with a large white gas mask painted on it and a giant of a man with a square jaw. The last group to come to her attention is a horrifically scarred man playing darts with a lizard mutant, a teenager with pitch-black skin and a young woman with long black hair. 

Split‚Äôs mind does a double take and she realizes that the last two people are Vantablack and Sunset. She saw their faces on the supervillain list. He is the head of some black market slash information brokership slash hired killers group, and she is the head of the terrorist organization fighting for the rights of the quirkless. And Eclipse‚Äôs daughter, apparently. 

They are playing darts. Two S-Ranks are doing something like that. And she just arrived with two more S-Ranks in tow. Four supervillains in a single room is a bit‚Ä¶ unheard of.

Uhm. She is starting to regret certain decisions.

‚ÄúThe heck?‚Äù Hitoshi asks, eyeing the room curiously. ‚ÄúWhat happened to the Clown Uncle, the Murder Uncle, the Kickass Aunt and the boss?‚Äù Does she even want to know who he is referring to?

‚ÄúKurogiri warped Mr. Compress out while you were away because of some Levellers stuff.‚Äù The two-coloured girl replies. ‚ÄúI think he is supposed to return the National Diet building today, and is probably preparing some special effects for that. Stain and Miruko are having another sparring session in the training room, and Legion‚Äôs with Gremlin in her lab. Doing‚Ä¶ uhm, something.‚Äù The girl finishes, eyeing Split curiously. 

Lizardman throws a dart in the background and shouts triumphantly that he just won another round. Vantablack and Sunset appear angry. The scarred man is fuming (no, literally, she sees black smoke rising from the edges of what seems to be skin transplants).

Split is busy processing what she just heard. She is only faintly familiar with who Stain is - she saw the moniker of a Hero Killer and that he was apparently a serial killer targeting heroes. Worrying. Then again, how many heroes could a single villain like that kill? 5 or 6? Miruko being a villain is still a shock (hearing about it being caused by her launching a coup against discrimination of complex mutants and villain quirks bearers was kinda reassuring, actually), and Mr. Compress‚Ä¶

WHY DOES THIS PLACE FEELS SO CASUAL?! That girl just mentioned returning the National Diet building like it was nothing. 

‚ÄúWell, guess we‚Äôre going to wait then.‚Äù Hitoshi replies. ‚ÄúI have a potential new recruit, but I‚Äôm not going to the Gremlin lab. I‚Äôm not suicidal.‚Äù She hears some chuckles in the room. ‚ÄúYou want something to drink? Or eat?‚Äù He asks her, and points towards the bar. Kurogiri gravitated there in the meantime, and is floating behind the bar. Just a little bit intimidating. 

Two SSS-Ranks. Three SS-Ranks. Four S-Ranks. In a single building. Save for one SSS-Rank, who is apparently out of the building for the moment. She is only a tiny bit intimidated. Okay, maybe a lot. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take whatever you have.‚Äù She is thirsty, hungry and probably wants to have a nice, long nap. 

 

***

She quickly discovers that everyone in the room she didn‚Äôt recognize as supervillains is an A-Rank villain. Save for the young man with a gasmask T-Shirt, who has joined recently and was apparently a former SS-Rank (can you even be a FORMER supervillain?). Scarred man was also Endeavor‚Äôs son, the lizardman was a veteran assassin-for-hire, the man playing videogames with the wolfgirl kills with a touch and has 100+ victims (if you counted both kills and permanent maiming) under his belt, and Stain has at this point killed about sixty heroes. 

Her status changed from tiny bit intimidated to extremely intimidated. 

 

***

 

Legion returns from the Gremlin‚Äôs lab missing one precious hour of his life and (almost) his brows. Overhaul is an ever-useful quirk and he literally loves it at this point (despite having exactly opposite feelings about his original user). 

He staggers into the living room, about to loudly complain about the unfairness of his life, when he discovers an unfamiliar face in the crowd. A young woman, with multicoloured hair, wearing a hoodie. She is standing right next to Toshi near the bar (they are talking about something and he appears genuinely HAPPY, which is slightly unnatural when he isn‚Äôt killing people), drinking something from a cup. 

Huh. 

‚ÄúBoss!‚Äù Hitoshi sees him too and waves towards him. Izuku is slightly angry. If he knew they were going to have a guest, he would wear something else. Himiko claims that his current T-Shirt (the one with the ‚Äòtrousers‚Äô written on it) is dumb, and he isn‚Äôt exactly sure if he agrees with her but he still wears it only in the company of friends, and‚Ä¶ 

Oh, well. It was probably Hitoshi‚Äôs idea of a joke. 

‚ÄúAnd who might that b‚Ä¶‚Äù He says while approaching them. He is trying to ignore the dart group who is about to start fighting for real (at least the quirks are forbidden outside of the training room so minimal damage and he CAN resurrect them so‚Ä¶ whatever floats their boat?). 

He is also ignoring the card playing circle, because Rabbit spent too much time with Mr. Compress when Izuku wasn‚Äôt looking and he was now absolutely deadly with cards, SOMEHOW. He treats the preciousness area the same way. Tenko and Suto have their own little heaven over there, and none of the villains in the vicinity feels villainous enough to intrude upon it. 

Multi-coloured hair. Toshi looking like he is happy. Izuku‚Äôs brain catches up. 

‚ÄúOh, Split, right?‚Äù Izuku asks. The woman is slightly startled by him immediately recognizing her. ‚ÄúToshi told me about you. Looks like you managed to escape Tartarus safely.‚Äù 

‚ÄúEr, yes.‚Äù She says with a nod. Clearly intimidated. Was Stain here before Izuku popped up? That would explain it. 

‚ÄúI managed to contact her through the internet.‚Äù Hitoshi takes over. ‚ÄúI hoped to make her join us, since‚Ä¶ well, you know. Not sure where to go and all that. She mentioned going vigilante, but I still have hopes.‚Äù 

‚ÄúKnuckleduster will certainly be overjoyed to have some new recruits, especially those already trained to become heroes.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúThe Vanguard might use some bulking up, though. So I‚Äôm going to do my best to have you stay with us, Miss Split.‚Äù She seems to have some mixed feelings about this. ‚ÄúAlso I just wanted to say that you have one of the coolest quirks I ever heard about. Is it true that‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äú REMAIN MOTIONLESS. ‚Äù Hitoshi uses his quirk on him, and Izuku obediently freezes with vacant eyes. Mindscrew turns his head towards only a slightly spooked Split. ‚ÄúHe gets very talkative when quirks are involved. The last time he was allowed to keep talking, his eighteen years old girlfriend discovered that she was actually a complex mutant all along. What I just did I‚Äôve done for the sanity of us all.‚Äù 

Izuku focuses on trying to make his neck bend a bit. After a scarce few seconds, the flesh starts obeying him. Something like two seconds later, he manages to shatter Toshi‚Äôs quirk entirely. 

Small success, since if this was combat, he would have given Toshi enough time to fire at him. 

‚ÄúYou know, that‚Äôs just goddamn cheating.‚Äù Mindscrew seems as angry as he is disappointed. ‚ÄúFirst Stain shakes my quirk off, then Eclipse, then Gigantomachia no-sells it for fifty-days straight and now this. Is there someone notable on whom my quirk still works?!‚Äù 

‚ÄúSpeaking about Stain, where exactly is my second uncle?‚Äù Izuku decides to ask, instead of continuing with that subject. If only to confirm his suspicion that he was here recently and spooked Split. 

‚ÄúWell, I wonder about that myself.‚Äù Hitoshi replies with a clearly audible sneer. ‚ÄúAre you sure that they are only trying to murder each other in there? Rather than, dunno, intersperse their violence with sex?‚Äù 

‚ÄúIf it was anyone other than Miruko, I‚Äôd laugh at the idea of Stain entering a relationship.‚Äù Izuku replies honestly. ‚ÄúBut she is insanely tough and has that ‚ÄòI‚Äôll live with no regrets‚Äô policy to the point where she almost overthrew the unjust government in order to save people from discrimination AND splattered Hawks‚Äô brain on the floor for his murder of a hero that Stain personally respected as a true hero.‚Äù He ignores Split‚Äôs shock at the mention of Miruko killing Hawks. ‚Äú And considering the fact that he is now an ideal punching bag due to his quirk‚Ä¶ I think I just don‚Äôt want to know what they are doing in there.‚Äù 

‚ÄúFair.‚Äù Mindscrew replies. ‚ÄúCan you imagine what their children would look and act like?‚Äù Izuku can‚Äôt help but shudder at the thought.

If he knew anything about how complex mutants worked, then there was a fair chance that being half-rabbit made Miruko prone to having multiple children (2-3, not anything crazy). He was probably going to have nightmares about an army of rabbit-people with katanas, intense bloodlust and enough leg strength to pull his head cleanly off by gripping it with their thighs and‚Ä¶ well, pulling. 

He isn‚Äôt touching that with a fifty-feet pole. Especially as they could probably jump for fifty-feet and then dropkick him into a face with enough strength to incapacitate him. Miruko was dangerous enough with bare hands and legs, how much worse would that get with an expertise in blades added to the mix? And‚Ä¶

...oh god, what if they inherit his quirk?! No, wait, that couldn‚Äôt happen. There was no thematic similarity between rabbits and blood quirks. The world was saved from the plague of blatantly overpowered, brave to the point of insanity AND blood drinking rabbit people. 

‚ÄúSo, uhm, what‚Äôs your quirk?‚Äù Rabbit materializes out of nowhere. One second he is playing cards with his friends and the former Mastermind (they are still thinking about his new villain name, Izuku hopes he will inherit Mustard‚Äôs name), and in the next one he is standing right next to Izuku. Looking at Split and asking the most important question. 

Izuku is filled with brotherly pride. But he still pulls that ace card from Rabbit‚Äôs sleeve and smacks his head with it lightly. Asa has enough common human decency to look ashamed by being caught cheating. Legion is going to have a serious talk with Mr. Compress about what exactly he is teaching his brother. 

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù Mindscrew sighs. ‚ÄúHe is Legion‚Äôs younger brother.‚Äù He says to Split. ‚ÄúThey share‚Ä¶ Honestly, do you have any distinct differences in personality?‚Äù He turns towards the Midoriyas. ‚ÄúBesides Asa being more anxious?‚Äù 

‚ÄúMy room is filled with All Might‚Äôs merch, while his with Miruko‚Äôs?‚Äù Izuku replies. The latter was theoretically banned now, so they couldn‚Äôt just buy or sell it. Then again, there was enough of a black market for people who were now trying to get rid of it (or who were urgently trying to buy it) for Legion to get enough stuff to fill Asa‚Äôs room with. 

Not the lewd stuff, of course. The serious stuff. Izuku is a responsible older brother. And he really hopes that All for One‚Äôs children are vulnerable to getting influenced by nearby hero merch through some form of heroic osmosis. If Izuku got influenced by All Might enough to start cleaning the country and save his life, then maybe Rabbit will pick up some additional confidence from Miruko.

Just not too much. That would be scary. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not exactly a personality difference, now, isn‚Ä¶ urgh.‚Äù Mindscrew sighs. ‚ÄúForget I asked. Split, do you want to answer?‚Äù

The former hero (well, almost a hero) seems to be willing to. Izuku didn‚Äôt miss the surprised flinch on her face when Izuku mentioned All Might‚Äôs merch. He feels like he established himself as a villain enough to not have to hide it from people. He has enough secrets already, and that‚Äôs really a minor one.

‚ÄúI can, uhm, split myself into several copies of myself, each inheriting a strengthened version of some major physical ability of mine.‚Äù Split answers promptly. ‚ÄúMajor physical ability as in strength, agility or endurance. The copies can‚Äôt leave a two kilometer distance from me. Also we are‚Ä¶ kinda forming a hivemind when I split?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Äù Izuku says.

‚Äú... really awesome!‚Äù Alongside Rabbit. 

Mindscrew sighs with enough physical pain to make him sound like they were torturing him rather than asking his friend about her quirk. 

‚ÄúAre you sure that they are brothers rather than, uhm I dunno, quirk clones?‚Äù He hears Mastermind asking Toxicity in their little card circle.  

Oh yes. Certainly Mustard.

 

***

Split ends up staying, although only temporarily. For now. She seems significantly less spooked and Izuku hopes that she stays because her quirk is awesome and she was a proper hero. Not a pro one, but she actually tried to help Hitoshi and that gives her a large plus in Izuku‚Äôs book. 

Besides, maybe she‚Äôll straighten him out a bit? Mindscrew‚Äôs clear enjoyment of killing people does slightly worry Izuku. Not like he is free of that, but in his case it depends on the people in question.

SmallMight: YOU ARE GROUNDED

ClownUncle: WHAT

SmallMight: STOP TEACHING MY BROTHER HOW TO CHEAT IN CARD GAMES

ClownUncle: I only taught him some magic tricks!

SmallMight: Like, how to hide cards in your sleeve without anyone noticing?

ClownUncle: YES, BUT THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A MAGIC TRICK NOT SOMETHING TO BE USED LIKE THAT I SWEAR

SmallMight: I

SmallMight: doubt

ClownUncle: I SWEAR ON MY SISTER‚ÄôS GOOD NAME

SmallMight: ‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt have a sister

ClownUncle: I actually have one, but she was in Tartarus under false name as an A-Rank ;_; 

ClownUncle: She is currently getting used to the fact that I‚Äôm now an SSS-Rank in the Levellers hideout.

SmallMight: more clowns

ClownUncle: yes

ClownUncle: So‚Ä¶ can I include a wonderful new recruit of the Levellers in our general chat? Great new potential addition to the League of Villains. 

SmallMight: no

ClownUncle: Why though

SmallMight: because I‚Äôm 99,999% sure this isn‚Äôt about Ms. Compress

***

Izuku is lying in his bed in the League‚Äôs headquarters, staring at the ceiling (although it‚Äôs a bit too dark for him to see it). He is wearing his favourite All Might pajama. Which is, well,his  second favourite nightwear in general - his All Might onesie is for when he sleeps at home, since Eri likes to sneak into his bed in identical outfit and it just fits so well). 

He is just so incredibly confused about his life right now. 

He set himself on a long journey to become the Symbol of Evil. The emperor of the underground. The archvillain. Re-Destro was still there, but with Overhaul out of the picture and the Paranormal Liberation Front being in tatters‚Ä¶ he was in a situation where he kinda didn‚Äôt know what to do. 

As if‚Ä¶ did he do it or not? He was aware that there was going to be no ACHIEVEMENT GAINED announcement when he gets a large enough percentage of villains under his thumb, life didn‚Äôt work like that. And it‚Äôs not like he could get crowned by someone. 

Was it‚Ä¶ it? Or was there supposed to be something he had to do before making it official? Sure, he could announce that he is now the Symbol of Evil in the media, but that would feel kinda pretentious. What if (unlikely, but‚Ä¶) Nedzu arrested him a week later? Wouldn‚Äôt that just make him a laughingstock? 

‚ÄúZuku, what are you thinking about?‚Äù He hears. He looks down to his right side. It‚Äôs dark in the room, but he still sees the outline of Himiko‚Äôs head, with her eyes on him. ‚ÄúI can see in the dark pretty well. You are making a weird face.‚Äù 

He can‚Äôt even brood without being cornered by someone, doesn‚Äôt he?

‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ not sure what to do now, I guess?‚Äù He replies. ‚ÄúI mean, I wanted to become a Symbol of Evil and help clean this country from the chaos. But now CRC is down, QLF is scattered, Garaki is dead, House of Red is down for the count, and it‚Äôs just the Meta-Liberation Army in Hokkaido and the Beast‚Äôs crowd out there. I feel like I won, but‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure what to feel about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh yes, eternal Zuku.‚Äù Himiko replies with a sigh. ‚ÄúYou overthinking things into full-blown rambles out of nowhere is like one-third of the charm.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMhmmm‚Ä¶‚Äù He hears from his left side, this time. Of course they weren‚Äôt quiet enough. Then again, the light was off for only a short while. Did Gremlin fall asleep already? She sounds like someone that was just woken up, that‚Äôs for sure. ‚ÄúOverthinking helps in baby-making.‚Äù 

Hearing the last two words in these circumstances is really nasty, especially for a young man (or was he still a late teenager?) like Izuku. He DID, technically, have two girls in his bed. And they were, technically (although not legally) his wives. Not like it meant anything other than sharing surnames and emotionally supporting each other closer than League‚Äôs average. 

Why was his life such a mess? Should he move out of the League headquarters? But he can‚Äôt really expect to avoid staying in one building with the people responsible for making his life a mess, especially as that‚Äôs just himself. And probably his dad. 

‚ÄúSo what do you think I‚Äôm supposed to do now?‚Äù Izuku asks. 

‚ÄúThe same thing we used to do until now?‚Äù Himiko replies. Izuku feels some shaking to the left of him, that‚Äôs probably Mei nodding. She probably forgot that it‚Äôs dark. That or she was wearing some designer baby-eye contacts with a nightvision option. Izuku wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at this point. 

He could activate his Night Vision quirk but frankly speaking, he is just so tired of interacting with people that he feels nice only having to hear them. He is and will always be kinda introvertish and he isn‚Äôt budging on that. 

Mei and Himiko are extroverts. Extreme. This sometimes hurts. A bit. 

‚ÄúLike, what?‚Äù Izuku replies. He can only hope that this is leading somewhere. He doesn‚Äôt want to be the only one who is offering support in this relationship. He has a faint feeling that relationships are best when they are a bit more equal with things like that. 

‚ÄúGather power, followers, money and so on?‚Äù Mei replies instead of Himiko. ‚ÄúI mean, that‚Äôs what villains do, right? While heroes are trying to stop them or take those away from them.‚Äù This answer is almost oddly sane. 

‚ÄúI guess.‚Äù Izuku says after a few seconds of silence. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just not sure what to feel about that. I mean, if Overhaul doesn‚Äôt just randomly pop up from nowhere, I‚Äôll end up having to fight the UA heroes and this just genuinely feels kinda awkward. I mean, I‚Äôll be trying to do that non-lethally, but even without Tartarus, we might be losing people permanently and that‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Äù 

He must have missed some silent agreement between them, because they both kissed his cheeks at once. He goes silent. And probably quite red. 

‚ÄúZuku.‚Äù Himiko says. ‚ÄúYou are the cutest, kindest and most adorable person in the world. You amassed enough firepower to challenge the government but you are still afraid that your friends will get hurt by someone if you use it. Seriously, don‚Äôt you ever change you silly cinnamon roll.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYep!‚Äù This time it‚Äôs Mei. ‚ÄúYou are also super smart, you always have time for me and my babies, know alot about quirks and‚Ä¶ well, I think my parents like you? They never told me to kill you or test my babies on you, and they go silent when I‚Äôm with you. So you are obviously a great person and don‚Äôt you ever change.‚Äù 

Okay. That was disturbing. She did mention the parents a bit earlier and Izuku is still trying to figure out how to send her to therapy over this. Hearing the ‚Äòthey never told me to kill you‚Äô that implies them telling her to kill other people did reinforce his opinion that she needs it. 

Besides, what‚Äôs the point of having hired Hound Dog (who basically went the ‚ÄòI‚Äôll do it because it might mean less people dying further down the line but I MIGHT tell everything to heroes once I get the amnesty‚Äô) if you don‚Äôt use him? 

‚Äú...I‚Äôm going to pretend I didn‚Äôt hear that.‚Äù Himiko ads after a few seconds of deafening silence, obviously leaving the issue to Izuku and his supreme experience in patching people‚Äôs minds up. This, unfortunately, isn‚Äôt something that emotional support can help with. ‚ÄúSeriously, just go to sleep. I know you don‚Äôt need a lot of it, but‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs unhealthy to torment yourself like that. Think about what to do during the day, with Rabbit and the others to advise you. Besides, if UA catches someone, you can always figure out how to break us out if it‚Äôs not from Tartarus, right?‚Äù 

He agrees. They hug him closer and soon their breaths grow steady. Izuku spends just a few more minutes thinking about how to make the League more powerful during the remaining twenty-something days of the ceasefire with the UA, and then finally falls asleep. 

He might have a lot of issues with their relationship, but going to sleep like that is pretty comfortable.

The city is a ruined mess. The damages are disastrous. He sees dead people everywhere. Dead‚Ä¶ and not just dead. Some of them are mangled beyond recognition. Some are too damaged to even tell that they are there, reduced to blood smears. Some are merged with the buildings, hanging off the surviving concrete walls like some grotesque sculptures. 

Work of a true sadist. Of a man truly unhinged. Of a man of truly disastrous power and insane mind. Of a single man who faced a thousand veteran fighters and emerged unscathed. Of the closest thing to a god this world has now. 

He raises up from the ground. His legs are missing, but this is of limited importance to him now. Geten is severed in half and seems to have bled out. Slidin‚Äô Go is simply gone, merely a lone head lying on the ground. 

‚ÄúI see that the reports about your death were slightly‚Ä¶ exaggerated.‚Äù Re-Destro, the Grand Commander of the Meta-Liberation Army, says. Ignoring the metallic taste of blood in his mouth. 

‚ÄúI died once already.‚Äù Overhaul replies. He doesn‚Äôt resemble his wanted poster at all. His hair is black. He is way taller, approaching All for One in his prime, although the build remained the same. He no longer carries a gasmask. ‚ÄúIt gets easier the second time.‚Äù 

Re-Destro laughs. Against himself, he laughs. 

‚ÄúWhat happened to you?‚Äù Re-Destro asks. He just witnessed the most powerful meta-ability in his life. Power approaching if not surpassing All for One. He is in genuine awe. 

‚ÄúI died. Again.‚Äù Overhaul replies. ‚ÄúBut I already had a third copy of myself prepared. When I died, it was installed into my imperfect magnum opus. This body. Body created through a combination of scientific knowledge of myself and late Doctor Garaki. Unfortunately, it happened before the fine-tuning was fully done. This is less than 25% of what the full-power would be. But‚Ä¶ I had to be there to reorganize what‚Äôs left of the Paranormal Liberation Front. So that will have to do.‚Äù 

One-quarter. Overhaul annihilated Re-Destro, his strongest lieutenants and the core of the Meta-Liberation Army with one-quarter of what he could have. 

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ you are truly liberated, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù Re-Destro asks. Overhaul looks at him strangely. ‚ÄúNo longer bound by common-sense. By sanity. By society. By law. Just you, your vision, your meta-ability‚Ä¶ and your genius.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one way of describing it.‚Äù Overhaul replies shortly. ‚ÄúI came to bargain.‚Äù Re-Destro doesn‚Äôt give him time for that. He, despite his missing legs and despite bleeding out slowly, bows down. 

‚ÄúMe and the two hundred thousand warriors of the Meta-Liberation Army will serve you now.‚Äù Re-Destro says. ‚ÄúThe true manifestation of the will of Destro.‚Äù He might disagree with Overhaul‚Äôs dream of a quirkless world. But he recognizes the will behind. The desire to bend the world according to it, and the power to do it. Re-Destro‚Äôs own power pales in front of Overhaul‚Äôs. He will serve. There is just no other option. 

‚ÄúWell, that saves us a lot of time.‚Äù Overhaul replies. Then he resets everything. 
Notes:

    Cheers to that one person who figured out the plottwist because, and I practically quote, "Overhaul is like a cockroach and they survive nuclear blasts so he is most certainly alive". You are my unironic hero, ngl.

Chapter Text

‚ÄúSo, my idea is to expand the Vanguard Action Squad to include non-direct members of the League.‚Äù Izuku says. Mindscrew is listening intently, while sipping on his coffee from time to time. It‚Äôs morning, after all. ‚ÄúAnd generally change it into the closest thing that the League will have to a standing army.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNow that‚Äôs an ambitious term.‚Äù Hitoshi replies. ‚ÄúWhat are the numbers we‚Äôre talking about?‚Äù

They are tucked into the corner of the living room, making plans. Or, more like, Izuku is frantically unleashing what he figured out after his small emotional support session with Mei and Himiko. Plus more. 

‚ÄúOh, nothing massive.‚Äù Izuku replies promptly. ‚ÄúThis is still going to be a vanguard. We can probably field a small army of thugs and lesser villains behind, but I want a core of competent and tested villains in front of it. A-Ranks only, save for very special circumstances.‚Äù 

‚ÄúEhhh, I think I‚Äôm seeing the image you‚Äôre painting and it‚Äôs not bad.‚Äù Hitoshi says with a nod. Izuku knows that things worked differently during his dad‚Äôs reign, but‚Ä¶ well, in all honesty, having to rely entirely on subsidiary groups with only some scant few personal villains was one of the many reasons why All for One was forcefully retired. At least in Izuku‚Äôs opinion. After all, if he just had someone to jump in when All Might United States of Smashed him...‚ÄúAny ideas for organization and new members?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI think that yeah.‚Äù Izuku says with a nod. ‚ÄúI would recommend three units for now. First one would be yours, and I‚Äôd pair you with Dabi, the second coming of Mustard and, preferably, Split. Second unit would be Rabbit, Toxicity, Juggernaut and Decay and Awoo. Third group and the first outside members of the Vanguard Action Squad would be Nine and his crew.‚Äù 

‚ÄúA bit odd, but‚Ä¶‚Äù Mindscrew unpacks Izuku‚Äôs words for a few seconds before mentally returning to the League‚Äôs living room. ‚ÄùMustard for large scale poison attacks, Dabi to set things on fire in order to delay enemies from reaching him, me to run interference with my quirk and Split for hit and run attacks in the poison cloud with her quirk.‚Äù  Izuku nods. ‚ÄúRabbit because he needs to get some skills with tactics. Toxicity and Juggernaut because they could use some practical experience as well and Decay has loads of it, so he should keep them safe.‚Äù 

Izuku nods again. Awoo isn‚Äôt even mentioned as a separate entity. Honestly, she is included under the word ‚ÄòDecay‚Äô when it comes to things like that. This is now the name of a villainous duo of two young Shimuras and that‚Äôs all that there is to be said. 

‚ÄúWorking with Nine might be a bit odd, since we did kill him and his folks and then send them to the Tartarus.‚Äù Mindscrew adds, before adapting a thoughtful face for a moment. ‚ÄúAlso didn‚Äôt you just put all my ranged fighters in the first group, while making the second exclusively melee? And isn‚Äôt Mustard going to be a bit of a dampener when it comes to us using said ranged combat skills? He does limit visibility.‚Äù 

Izuku didn‚Äôt like that either. 

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ might have done my best to not separate Rabbit from his friends.‚Äù Izuku admits and Mindscrew leaves a painful groan. While probably thinking something alongside of ‚Äòyou and your doting brother syndrome‚Äô. 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs replace Mustard with Decay.‚Äù Hitoshi says after a moment. ‚ÄúThis way the second party will have a ranged fighter, especially if what Gremlin says about improvements to the gas thrower is any indication. While the first party will be allowed to shoot freely and some additional melee fighters slash one-man-demolition-unit.‚Äù 

Izuku thinks it over for a few moments. Well, he DID see the new Mustard spend an awful lot of time with Toxicity and Rabbit‚Äôs small circle of friends (he was still severely intimidated by anyone who looked meaner than them), so‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúOkay, I can live with that.‚Äù Izuku concludes. ‚ÄúWell, that sounds great. Especially if we‚Äôll ever have to battle heroes for real. Vanguard has to be ready to break out people from non-Tartarus prisons and so on.‚Äù He refuses to lose friends if he can avoid that, after all. Yesterday‚Äôs late evening thoughts established that fully. ‚ÄúI have one more business idea, but that‚Äôs not exactly about Vanguard, so‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúC‚Äômon, spill it out.‚Äù Mindscrew seems interested. Honestly speaking, Izuku is shocked that his adopted cousin is awake and in working mode so early (well, technically speaking it is 9am) in the morning. 

Split being around was already changing him? It couldn‚Äôt work that quickly. Unless‚Ä¶ wait, did Hitoshi have a CRUSH ON HER?! No way, right?

‚ÄúEhh, I just thought that we could earn a lot of money if we created some underground bars and so on exclusively for villains.‚Äù Izuku decides to speak finally. ‚ÄúWe can use some Twice clones to man it, since it turns out that memory inheritance is an optional mechanism. Kurogiri as a barman and an emergency evac mean, probably some more clones as very inexpensive waitresses and‚Ä¶ uhm... ‚Äú He isn‚Äôt saying THOSE words. ‚ÄúGenerally might be something to consider.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd you thought about the uhm part‚Ä¶ in your bed?‚Äù Hitoshi‚Äôs face looks just a little bit sadistic. 

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù He shouts back. ‚ÄúIt might have been something from a rather weird dream and I‚Äôm trying to check if it‚Äôs feas‚Ä¶‚Äù He sees Mindscrew‚Äôs smile grow even more sadistic. ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù 

Decay enters the room with Awoo. They head for the bar and begin to stuff themselves with Kurogiri‚Äôs sandwiches. Somehow they do while still holding their hands and looking into each other‚Äôs eyes (the latter is at worst interrupted for about ten seconds before it‚Äôs resumed). 

Their preciousness is just too much. 

‚ÄúA DREAM, HUH?‚Äù Hitoshi decides to pester him in the background. Izuku‚Äôs brain suddenly snaps into a strange place. ‚ÄúWell I wonder what might have brought that dream up. Care to elaborate on potential sources, Izuukuuu?‚Äù 

‚ÄúUhm, Toshi?‚Äù Izuku asks him, his eyes still on Tenko. ‚ÄúTenko was always a loner who refused to participate in social activities and mostly played video games alone, yes? And barely bothered to read the plot until recently, it was just getting high levels and beating people, yes?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù Mindscrew is taken aback by the sudden change of subject.

‚ÄúAnd Awoo was a social outcast who was disfigured by her asshole parents, yes?‚Äù Izuku continues his short and increasingly horrified questioning. ‚ÄúWith almost no social interactions ever since, yes?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù Mindscrew still didn‚Äôt connect the dots. 

‚ÄúUhm‚Ä¶‚Äù Izuku‚Äôs face finally moves from Tenko to Hitoshi. Mindscrew finds himself facing an expression of genuine terror. ‚ÄúDo you think that someone has ever explained to them how does safe sex works?‚Äù 

Hitoshi chokes on his coffee.

Two hours later Izuku is staring at the newest message from his mom. Together with Asa, who is hyperventilating next to him, eyes locked on his own phone. 

‚ÄúUhm‚Ä¶ Izuku‚Ä¶ Is that‚Ä¶ does this mean..‚Äù Rabbit tries to speak. And breathe. At once. The results aren‚Äôt pretty.

‚ÄúYou remember the day when Tenko married Awoo?‚Äù Izuku manages to speak in a bit more cohesive way. ‚ÄúAnd then Himiko married me right after that?‚Äù Rabbit nods lightly. ‚ÄúThat was the Unexpected Marriages Day. Looks like today is Unexpected Pregnancies Day.‚Äù 

Izuku hopes that it‚Äôs going to be a girl. He has one younger sister, yes, but he agrees with his father that when it comes to Eri, then more is better. 

He receives another message on the Villain Network. He expects another unexpected pregnancy announcement‚Ä¶ but no. 

Principal: Meta-Liberation Army forces are making landfall in Northern Japan. 

It‚Äôs also the Unexpected War Day. 

 

***

The Northern Battle Group had its headquarters near the place where the Aomori, Iwate and Akita prefectures met. It was permanently garrisoned by Yoroi Muusha, no less than three additional Top 15 Heroes, about two hundred unranked heroes (like those from Tartarus, they said goodbye to popularity and fame and instead opted to serve in de-facto military), one thousand soldiers of the Ground Self-Defense Force and similar number of policemen from the riot units. 

The HPSC couldn‚Äôt predict where exactly the MLA would land, hence the positioning. Those three prefectures - due to being the northernmost ones - were the most likely targets for the invasion if Re-Destro decided to invade Japan. If the attack occurred, local heroes and police units were supposed to delay it, giving the NBG time to sortie with full force and push the attackers back into the sea. 

It was, in full honesty, a fool-proof strategy. The one hundred thousand warriors of the MLA had some heavy-hitters, but the majority of them were a mob. It was the joint estimation of the UA and the HPSC that a single unranked hero was an equivalent of twenty to thirty regular MLA warriors. Riot units of the Japanese Police and the JGSDF were capable of eliminating MLA units several times their size as well. 

Unfortunately, the situation changed when the MLA executives came into play. People like Trumpet or Skeptic were capable of going toe-to-toe with Top 30 Heroes. Slidin‚ÄôGo excelled in a single combat, and played in similar league to people like Mr. Compress or Stain. Geten was a living weapon of mass destruction, a man capable of freezing a small city with a flick of his finger and an overbearing desire to show his power to the world.  

And then, there was Re-Destro. Man whose stress made him stronger. Man who fought Endeavor and Thunderbolt at once during his coup and emerged victorious, the coup failing only because All Might arrived at the scene and stopped Re-Destro from capturing the National Diet building. And even then, Re-Destro managed to flee. 

He was also a master strategist and tactician, someone who played in the same league as people like Nedzu and Sir Nighteye. It was easy to discount him as a hulking juggernaut (when stressed enough, he turned into a black monster bigger and bulkier than All Might). But he was the last leader of a secret conspiracy that lasted for generations, a conspiracy that embedded itself into the highest ranks of the government, the financial elites and the media. Conspiracy that remained undetected until it was ready to overthrow the government and change society in its image. 

The fact that Re-Destro found pride in knowing every single warrior of the Meta-Liberation Army by his name, face and quirk was probably a cherry on the top. When the coup failed, he met every single MLA unit that lost even a single member to say his condolences. He knew the fallen. He cried for them. He might have lost the coup, but the MLA turned even more fanatically loyal to him on that day. 

HPSC knew about all of that. Just as it knew that the Japanese naval forces were in a position to decimate the MLA forces before landing (unless Geten was with them, then sending anything other than a nuclear missile was just a pointless loss of human life). With the estimated number of landing crafts available to the Meta-Liberation Army it was obvious that no more than twenty thousand warriors could make landfall in one go. 

Northern Battle Group had enough heavy-hitters to hold its ground even if Re-Destro included himself and all of his executives in the first wave. While having enough unranked heroes, soldiers and policemen to decimate the rest. By the time the second wave would be ready, the first one would be massacred. And the HPSC‚Äô reinforcements would begin arriving, to help mop up the survivors. 

The coup changed things - to the better, oddly enough. The Table members within the Northern Battle Group didn‚Äôt raise in arms - the crucial point of Miruko‚Äôs plan was to NOT compromise the security of Japan, after all. What‚Äôs more, the HPSC sent fifty Paragons - including Valiant, the Rank Three Paragon) to reinforce the NBG when the coup ended. After the events of Tartarus battle, the president of the Hero Commission has also made a decision to bolster the Northern Battle Group with every remaining active member and equipment piece of the GSDF. This decision was approved by the government, and the process was underway when the war started.

The HPSC made several crucial miscalculations with that plan. Although, in all honesty, that wasn‚Äôt its fault. They all bottled down to a single thing, in the end. Overhaul. 

No one expected Overhaul to still be alive, despite standing a few meters away from an exploding nuclear bomb. No one expected twenty-five inferior Eclipse copies, boosted with special Trigger, warping twenty-five thousand MLA warriors alongside the twenty-thousand that got there by sea. No one expected close to five hundred A-Rank villains marching alongside the MLA armies (most of what remained from the Tartarus escapees after desertions, hero raids and people simply returning home overseas). No one expected the largest joint deployment of the Inhuman Supremacy Party in history, rising out everywhere throughout northern Japan. No one expected twenty remaining Purified and three remaining Third Gen Noumus. 

The defenders were going to do their best. Like during the Tartarus attack, it wasn‚Äôt going to be enough. 

 

***

Scream was one of the heroes deep in the Hero Commission‚Äôs pocket. Her screaming attacks were causing collateral damage left and right. They worked differently than Present Mic‚Äôs, they could cut steel when she focused them enough. HPSC was always willing to smooth things out in exchange for‚Ä¶ favors. 

So yes. She was a quote unquote corrupted hero. She did her job, despite that. Stopped villains, saved people. She didn‚Äôt take money from the HPSC, just‚Ä¶. accepted their help when needed. 

Scream saw no issue with that. Normally. Sometimes when she saw people like All Might on the TV, there was‚Ä¶ something like a regret, deep inside her. She was never going to admit that publicly. She refused to admit that to herself. But deep inside she knew it. 

There was no sortie against the MLA landing forces. Reports from the police precincts and hero agencies throughout the northern prefectures made it obvious that they can‚Äôt hope to push Re-Destro armies back to sea. Not with those numbers. 

Before Yoroi Muusha had time to consider retreat south, the vanguard of the MLA (reinforced by the ISP warriors and‚Ä¶ were those the Purified?!) arrived through the warp gates and launched itself against the reinforced walls of the Northern Battle Group headquarters. She could see them from her position on said walls. 

Scream had enough combat experience and knowledge to understand what that meant. PLF and the MLA joined hands. 

The defenders eventually repelled the enemy vanguard after twenty-five minutes of fierce fighting. Scream killed one third gen Noumu, seven Purified and thirty-seven A-Rank villains by herself (she knew that Trigger dose would come in handy at some point). But finally one of the Purified acted fast enough to impale her with Moonfish‚Äô teeth blades. Scream bled out en route to Wash‚Äô field hospital. 

Second wave of the attackers arrived through the warpgates fifteen minutes later. It included Re-Destro, Geten and Overhaul himself. This time the defenders stood no chance. 

 

***

‚ÄúYou. Your meta-ability is weak.‚Äù Geten (because of course, it had to be that damn asshole) announced. He was standing on an ice bridge, towering over the walls of the headquarters. 

Easy to snipe. If he didn‚Äôt just rain the entire area with a meter-long icicles. Everyone capable of just shooting him dead was dead or dying. And judging from the explosions and screams coming from every direction, the chances of someone coming were minimal. Save for further MLA forces.

‚ÄúHow did you become a Rank 15 Hero with an ability like that?‚Äù Geten tilts his head a bit. There is probably an expression of genuine surprise and lack of understanding on his face under the hood of his parka. 

Boulder stands up. He managed to dodge and stop the icicles coming at himself. He is a large man wearing something resembling police riot armor. He always cared less about aesthetics and more about protection. 

For a reason, he decides as he breaks off the icicle that failed to pierce his armor chest piece. Its lodged in the armored plate enough to stick out, but not enough to impale Boulder.

‚ÄúNot being a genocidal, quirk-supremacist ass is a good start.‚Äù Boulder replies. His chances of victory are minimal. His quirk allows him to control all types of stone, just like Geten can control ice and create it from any water in the vicinity.. His hero name hails from his preferred usage of his quirk - create a large ball of smoothed out rock and throw it. Simple as that.

And destructive. His quirk holds the stone in a single form and velocity for no less than ten seconds. Regardless of external influences. He could throw a rock pellet through several meters of armored steel. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of that, when your meta-ability is weak?‚Äù Geten replies. Of course, no understanding. 

Boulder curses his luck. Couldn‚Äôt that be, like, anyone else? Even Re-Destro would be more vulnerable to his quirk. Geten was an accomplished ranged combatant, and he was literally in the air. Boulder is strong and he can use his quirk to throw further, but‚Ä¶. 

Their battle lasts for seven minutes. Boulder dies in the line of duty, but his last throw takes Geten off-guard (he planned for that, Geten looked down on him a lot, he was bound to be easy to surprise when he decides that Boulder is down). Enough to tear off his left arm in the shoulder. Geten fails to find Overhaul in time to reset this damage. 

 

***

Crust is a dangerous hero. Sure, he has a slightly off-putting and very emotional (both cheerful and sorrowful and everything in-between) personality, but his quirk is no joke. Sure number two, his quirk lets him create shields out of his body, but he has long-ago learned how to use it for offensive purposes.

Any of the numerous warriors of the MLA and the A-Rank villains that he faced that day can attest that. Crust is a hero, he is supposed to apprehend criminals. But this is war. And any villain that he would arrest would just be freed in an hour or two. There is no hope for victory today. 

He almost cries thinking about it. No, he actually cries. The A-Rank Villain with fire quirk that was trying to fight him is startled for like two seconds before the shield rams him into a concrete wall behind. 

He heard the announcement. Full-retreat. Valiant and the Paragons managed to repulse the ISP assault from the south and opened the (temporary, no doubt) breach in the encirclement. Everyone capable of joining them is supposed to move south as soon as possible. Yoroi Muusha and the forces currently engaged in combat are to act as rearguard. 

Crust didn‚Äôt expect that from the old hero. He was in for fame, everyone knew that. Skills, but not a true hero. Then again, it wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äòfight and die or retire‚Äô but ‚Äòdie in shame or die in fame‚Äô moment. At least for whoever stays. 

The attack on the field hospital stopped. The Wash was shouting something in the back. The hero‚Äôs outfit was ridiculous, but the Laundry Hero didn‚Äôt become a Rank 11 Hero over nothing. He was using his bubbles to float the most wounded back, they and the hospital staff were trying to evacuate whoever they could and‚Ä¶

One of the hospital walls opened up and Overhaul stepped inside. He looked different, and Crust wouldn‚Äôt recognize him if the League representative didn‚Äôt show him his original look. 

He didn‚Äôt even bother touching anything. He simply stood there. Yet the wounded heroes, soldiers and policemen around him began to die. 

Crust, the Number Seven Hero, understood what he had to do within the first two seconds of the attack. He flungs his shields, pushing Wash and as many wounded as he could through the window (Wash‚Äô bubbles will keep them in the air, they will survive, the attack obviously spread through physical contact with the floor and they are on the fourth floor). 

The eyes of the two Top Heroes met for a second. Crust smiled cheerfully and made a thumbs-up gesture. Then he died.

‚ÄúMy name‚Ä¶ is Overhaul.‚Äù The tall man says towards the camera. He is in the command center of the Northern Battle Group base. Behind him are signs of recent battle. Blood smears. Corpses. Slashes. Re-Destro stands there, right behind a bound and wounded elder wearing remains of a classical Japanese armor, who is kneeling on the floor. 

(the people gathered in the League of Villains headquarters, the UA teacher‚Äôs lounge and in the new headquarters of the HPSC gasp or curse. Izuku is frothing with rage, with a look on his face that almost makes Split faint)

‚ÄúI know that I died recently.‚Äù He says with a sigh. ‚ÄúNot the first time. Dying gets easier the second time... and there will be no third one.‚Äù He chuckles lightly. ‚ÄúI speak to you all to announce that Re-Destro abdicated in my favour. I‚Äôm the new Grand Commander of the Meta-Liberation Army‚Ä¶ which, as of now, officially becomes a part of the Paranormal Liberation Front. But that‚Äôs not all that I‚Äôm going to say today.‚Äù 

(All for One is hugging his terrified daughter, with an expression of pure murder on his face. Inko is hugging her too, her face matching her husband‚Äôs)

‚ÄúI waged a war against Japan for a long time.‚Äù Overhaul says. ‚ÄúEver since the Hosu, although then I made my first open move. Despite my best efforts‚Ä¶ I was still treated like a villain. A domestic threat. A terrorist. This ends today.‚Äù He smiles towards the camera. ‚ÄúToday more than two hundred thousand warriors of the Paranormal Liberation Front stand behind me. I‚Äôve taken three prefectures and we shall not retreat from them. This is now an open war. We will march southwest, until the entire Japan is ours. Until the UA, the HPSC and the League of Villains will all be a dead and forgotten memory.‚Äù 

He makes a slight gesture. Re-Destro breaks Yoroi Muusha‚Äôs neck. Millions watching the hijacked TV broadcast react with a mix of fury, horror and shock. 

‚ÄúThe Paranormal Liberation War starts now.‚Äù Overhaul chuckles. ‚ÄúPerhaps this time you will notice that fact. And then‚Ä¶ then I will heal you all. I will heal the world. Even if I have to do it one person at a time.‚Äù 

The broadcast ends. And so does the fragile peace in Japan. 
Notes:

    Those of you that read Ties that Bind already know sort of child was just announced to the world. Yes, guys and gals. It's the Dreaded Aiko. Eraserhead's first official Demon Child (it's like a Problem Child but to other Problem Children, so it's Problem Child squared pretty much). Doesn't get any lines here, way too young, but that's how she was 'conceived' in my little multiverse. TTB was born because I decided to age her up and make her a character.

    I have commited a comedic one-shot, except it's a three shot. At least check it out: Here
    I have also commited Exiting the Stage. Which is basically Ties that Bind, except Butterfly Effect was a bitch and the world was pushed from adorableness and fluffiness into grimdark. Check it out: Here

Chapter 57: Paranormal Liberation War [I]
Summary:

    Paranormal Liberation War starts in an earnest.

Notes:

    Decided that I haven't updated things on Wednesdays in a long time, so decided to drop a chapter today. In hopes that I'll catch some readers that I otherwise missed. Also, seriously, I HAVE MORE FICS THAN JUST THIS ONE! Just check the Series that this story belongs to. I know that some of their premise might sound weird or smth, but at least try a few chapters, I guarantee you that my writing improved BY FAR after Cure to Evil ;_; pls.

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

Day One

 

SmallMight: THAT SON OF A BITCH

SmallMight: I‚ÄôM GOING TO MURDER HIM

SmallMight: SKIN HIM ALIVE

SmallMight: FUCK YOU OVERHAUL

SmallMight: FUUUUUCK  YOU 

Principal: ‚Ä¶ you do realize that it‚Äôs not the League‚Äôs chatroom, yes?

SmallMight: I assure you, my dear rat/bear/principal, that I‚Äôm significantly more vocal and descriptive on League‚Äôs chatroom. 

SmallMight: This is a censored version. 

TinTinCan: Honestly speaking, considering what just happened to Crust and what we know about Overhaul, I‚Äôm willing to hold that man down while Legion brutally murders him. 

SpyingEye: Mirio!

TinTinCan: I‚Äôm sorry. Sir, but that‚Äôs the truth. 

SpyingEye: No, I just wanted to remind you that Overhaul can kill with a touch, ask Eraserhead to hold him with his scarf instead.

Ninja: ‚Ä¶

FashionStatement: ‚Ä¶

AllRight: ...

NapNeeded: I‚Äôm in.

SmallMight: So wholesome sob

SmallMight: please be my third family

TinTinCan: don‚Äôt push it

SmallMight: alright my totally not an adopted older brother

TinTinCan: ugh

SmallMight: estranged older cousin? 

SmallMight: CAN ALL MIGHT BE MY ADOPTED UNCLE

TinTinCan: Stop. Seriously. Please.

SmallMight: Alright, sorry, bad time considering what happened to Crust, I‚Äôll try to stick to the subject, sorry, swears and humour are my ways of dealing with stress, sorry once again

SmallMight: back to the subject

SmallMight: we now have an official war, and the Overjerk (I‚Äôm going to go Rappa on his ass and start to refer to him like that) has like 200 000 fanatics instead of a few thousand. 

SmallMight: Ideas how to proceed with that?
SmallMight: Because I sure as hell didn‚Äôt make a contingency plan for the quirk supremacists joining hands with a guy who wants to erase quirks. 

Principal: That scenario didn‚Äôt occur to me either. 

SpyingEye: Same. 

Principal: If there is an analyst that foresaw this development, I‚Äôm going to hire him even if I have to pay him his weight in gold. But not before having him or her run through psychological counseling. 

Principal: But probably there is none.

Principal: Any idea what Overjerk did to himself? 

SmallMight: Overjerk :3

Principal: Yoroi Muusha sent the data from the NBG headquarters before its fall. Overjerk used his power on people despite NOT touching them. 

SmallMight: WHAT

SmallMight: send me a recording, I‚Äôll have a look

Principal: Alright. 

Principal: HPSC president is pissing her pants off at the development. I expect the GSDF to get resurrected with every available yen pushed into it. There might even be a draft (because to be honest, we don‚Äôt have the numbers to face the masses of warriors that the PLF can now field). 

Principal: I‚Äôll be also extremely shocked if the government doesn‚Äôt hand her dictatorial powers for the duration of the emergency. And, frankly, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre in a position to oppose that. I‚Äôm officially just a hero and a school principal, and she is the only member of the generally understood government that has enough authority to pull that off. 

Principal: I‚Äôm also going to have to work with her. Oh joy.

SmallMight: Any chances to make the alliance between us official for the duration of this mess?

SmallMight: League‚Äôs operations will benefit if the HPSC will not try to arrest us at every opportunity.

Principal: I‚Äôll ask. Considering the chaos and the fact that the Front now has her checked, she might be‚Ä¶ receptive. 

Principal: Same with the Vigilante Alliance. We should leave the infighting for times after the war. 

SpyingEye: Hopefully the coup beat some sense into her. 

SpyingEye: The fight barely started and we are already in the corner.

Principal: I‚Äôm also going to start calling my international favours. We need every hero we can get, regardless of the language they speak. 

 

***

 

SmallMight: I finished analyzing the recording of the fight. Together with Rabbit.

SmallMight: ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt like it. 

Principal: Details please.

SmallMight: Overjerk seems to have optimized his new body with his quirk in mind. Consider him a Class-Six quirk bearer. He de facto is one now, even more than before. 

SmallMight: Also an increased strength, speed and reaction time. Hard to say how far, but do not consider him a weakling only dependent on his quirk. He is pretty much a humanoid High End Noumu, considering the scale of improvements.

SmallMight: His quirk can now affect things through indirect contact. He killed Crust by dismantling him through three-stage indirect contact (Overjerk‚Äôs hands ‚Üí Overjerk‚Äôs body ‚Üí Floor ‚Üí Crust). He probably has a hole in his boots‚Ä¶ or that‚Äôs actually a four-stage contact.

SmallMight: Do not engage him unless you are airborne (his quirk doesn‚Äôt affect gasses), can attack him from outside of his effective range (he seems to be limited to something like 50m, but don‚Äôt quote me on that, that‚Äôs the furthest distance we saw him using quirk) or have Eraserhead stare him down. 

AllRight: Damn. He is my perfect counter, isn‚Äôt he? My air pressure attacks won‚Äôt be enough to knock him out from this distance. Especially as he still can reset non-fatal damages.

SmallMight: Not so sure about it. 

AllRight: ?

SmallMight: He had no reason to ‚Äòonly‚Äô dismantle your arm in the Training Camp battle.

SmallMight: One for All increases resistance to quirk attacks as a whole, both physical and mental. I mean, there ARE instant kill quirks out there (if rare), someone would have extinguished the OFA long ago if killing its users was THAT easy. Even if All for One wasn‚Äôt interested in doing that

SmallMight: my theory is that Overjerk tried to disassemble you whole, but the One for All‚Äôs remnants in you ‚Äòrepelled‚Äô the hostile foreign influence before it enveloped your entire body

SmallMight: He got a massive power boost, but so did you

SmallMight: There is a fair chance that if you jump at him and pull United States of Smash on his face, it will knock him out instantly, and his quirk will fail to damage you significantly (especially through an indirect contact, if he touches you with his hands it will be‚Ä¶ Training Camp mark 2, most likely). 

TinTinCan: Hosu?

SmallMight: YES, I knew you would understand

AllRight: ???

SmallMight: I failed to use Overhaul to reset my wounds for the first time due to quirk exhaustion (I had to use some of the overjerk‚Äôs special Trigger that I stole from him back then, if I was a few seconds slower I‚Äôd have died)

SmallMight: I only used that quirk that day twice, and the first time was to conjure the asphalt hands to attack Ingenium 2 and Lemillion (non-organic changes aren‚Äôt hard though)

SmallMight: (the quirks to save my life from the punch contributed, but one is rather lightweight when it comes to quirk exhaustion, and the other shouldn‚Äôt fail these quickly)

SmallMight: This means that breaking Lemillion‚Äôs limbs put me on the verge of total quirk exhaustion, despite me having to resurrect SEVERAL students to achieve the same result during the Training Camp

TinTinCan: In other words, the One for All Holders SHOULD be resistant enough to engage Overjerk on-foot, but that would probably be done as the last resort because we do not know just how powerful his quirk truly is now

SmallMight: ^ 

SmallMight: ‚Ä¶ actually, I think I have an idea

SmallMight: give me ten minutes to confirm something

TinTinCan: I‚Äôm scared.

SpyingEye: Correctly so, most likely.

TinTinCan: Nedzu is silent, what is he doing?

NapNeeded: Phoning the HPSC president, considering the shouts I can hear from his office. 

TinTinCan: Explains his silence here, then.

TinTinCan: Sir?
SpyingEye: Looking over the map of Japan and figuring out how to stop the PLF from attacking Sendai (it will probably be its first major target). 

TinTinCan: Well, good luck with that. 

SmallMight: I HAVE CONFIRMATION

SmallMight: Rabbit‚Äôs quirk can render people temporarily immune to Overhaul‚Äôs quirk. Only people, though (so those attacking with physical objects, like FashionStatement, won‚Äôt help a lot)

AllRight: Oh? 

SpyingEye: Insta-kill on Purity AND immunity to quirks? What on Earth is Asa‚Äôs quirk?

SmallMight: ‚Ä¶ Can we just limit ourselves to saying that Class Six quirks like All for One, One for All, Eri‚Äôs Rewind and Asa‚Äôs ____ are infinitely awesome? And not get into details? 

SpyingEye: ‚Ä¶

TinTinCan: ‚Ä¶

AllRight: ‚Ä¶ 

FashionStatement: ‚Ä¶

Rasengan: ‚Ä¶

SmallMight: ugh

SmallMight: alright

SmallMight: Total Command. Two-step activation, only telling you the second one (speech). He can alter states (emotional, biological, physical kinda but it depends) of biological organisms. 

SpyingEye: What?

SmallMight: Happy, sad, weightless, poisoned, well-rested, exhausted, berserked, Triggered, unconscious, asleep,  paralyzed, ill/healthy, weakened, charmed, all of those are ‚Äòstates‚Äô. So is ‚Äòdead‚Äô (he shouted at Purity to ‚Äòdrop dead‚Äô, his quirk read the second word out of it and stopped her heart), and, apparently, ‚Äòquirk-resistant‚Äô. But he can only ‚Äòstack‚Äô a single state on a person. 

TinTinCan: Omg the absolute status condition build

SmallMight: I KNOW AND IT‚ÄôS AWESOME

SmallMight: I have the best little brother in the world

SmallMight: I love him so much

SmallMight: I know him for like three months but if something happened to him I‚Äôd kill everyone I know and then myself

TinTinCan: ‚Ä¶ please don‚Äôt do that if that happens.

SmallMight: We still don‚Äôt know how well this will fare against empowered Overjerk

SmallMight: plus we can as well just‚Ä¶ like‚Ä¶ pay Lady Nagant to snipe him? 

TinTinCan: You getting emotional about using a Class Six quirk (two if you include One for All) to defeat someone and then adding that you can also just shoot the guy in question with a gun is a very Midoriya Izuku thing to do.

SmallMight: I‚ÄôM DOING MY BEST, PLEASE AND THANK YOU

TinTinCan: Fair, so in the end, we have several possible counters to Overjerk himself. And we know that we can just kill Re-Destro if we send me or All Might against him

SmallMight: Stain is a good counter too

SmallMight: I‚Äôd pay to watch Stain and Miruko fight Re-Destro tbh

TinTinCan: They can stand each other? I figured that one would kill the other quickly.

SmallMight: Oh they do that constantly, but I can resurrect people, remember? 

SmallMight: Also at this point I‚Äôm like 70% sure they do more than just regularly kill each other during their lone ‚Äòtraining brawls‚Äô behind closed doors. 

SmallMight: Wink wink. 

TinTinCan: I now have images in my mind that I never wanted there. Thank you.

FashionStatement: ‚Ä¶ those images are in my mind as well and they are incredibly unfashionable. 

Principal: I HAVE CONCLUDED MY NEGOTIATIONS

NapNeeded: I heard villains trying to murder each other use words with less negativity than the ones in your ‚Äònegotiations‚Äô. 

Principal: How sweet of you to compliment me like that!

NapNeeded: Ugh

Principal: Alliance with the League of Villains ‚Üí Accepted. She really hated the idea, but she agreed to issue a ‚Äòdon‚Äôt engage‚Äô order on your members for the frontline and any operation outside of it that she was informed of beforehand and has given her permissions. 

Principal: Also it appears that I was correct with the dictatorial powers (government is pulling back some law from the Dawn of Quirks era chaos to give it some legal framework) and the GSDF getting resurrected. 

Principal: You can also expect our foreign ministry begging everyone out there for every piece of spare military hardware to equip it. And for foreign heroes to come to our aid. 

SpyingEye: ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll probably not pay back those debts anytime soon.

Principal: Probably not.

NapNeeded; You can probably pay them off from the UA budget.

Principal: You‚Äôre overexaggerating, Aizawa!

NapNeeded: To a lesser degree than we all suspect.

Principal: The government is planning to nationalize the Detnerat Company assets within the Japanese territory and then (once the war is over) dismantle it into several smaller groups, too.

SmallMight: High time. 

SmallMight: Vigilante Alliance?

Principal: Hunt is called off until the end of the war. Free hunting season for the PLF members - unless there will be civilian casualties, the government will not consider killings or incarcerations as acts of vigilantism. 

SmallMight: holy shit they pretty much legalized vigilantes for the time being

SmallMight: looks like someone‚Äôs finally treating Overjerk seriously

Principal: It‚Äôs just less vigilantes and more ‚Äòresistance fighters‚Äô when the front passes them over at this point.

SmallMight: you can tell the HPSC president that Mr. Compress and the Levellers decided that they don‚Äôt need the money right now and that she can pay them the ransom after the war (the additional threat is still there, so I assume she will pay despite the government being back)

SmallMight: buy some additional guns with that money

Principal: Additional threat?
SmallMight: She didn‚Äôt tell you?

Principal: She generally doesn‚Äôt tell me things.

SmallMight: Mr. Compress wanted money now and then the right to officially and legally shoot and publish a film about his own life +a trilogy of films about my life in exchange for NOT testing how many Twice clones are needed to steal Tokyo. 

Principal: I think that I shouldn‚Äôt have asked.

TinTinCan: ‚Ä¶

TinTinCan: yes.

Day Twenty-Seven

 

The Battle for Sendai went‚Ä¶ bad. 

 

The Paranormal Liberation Front couldn‚Äôt just randomly attack another city. Oh, it launched a lot of raids using the false-Eclipses, just to ignite fear in the general population of Japan and force the heroes to maintain garrisons throughout the country. But this time its goal was not to destroy, but to occupy. 

 

Its forces marched south slowly and methodically. Overtaking town by town, installing new leadership (loyal to the ‚ÄòFree Republic of Japan‚Äô, with its temporary capital in Sapporo on Hokkaido), then marching further while probably leaving some minuscule garrison to keep their flag up. 

 

Heroes that the HPSC and the UA managed to scrounge up (without leaving the rest of the country open to PLF raids at least until most major towns would be covered in warp coordinate scramblers) launched counterraids. They managed to delay the inevitable for almost a month. But eventually, everything north of Sendai was taken over by the PLF. Two additional prefectures have fallen. 

 

Sendai was reinforced by everything that Japan managed to send north. Outskirts were evacuated (people were fleeing the city right from the start of the war), and Cementoss (together with UA support course and a lot of heroes with appropriate quirks) fortified its northern approach to the best of their ability. 

 

Not enough. Sure, Overhaul and Re-Destro and most of the PLF heavy-hitters played it cool and kept away from the frontlines, but the PLF had a lot of A-Rank villains to spare. And even more of its expendable cannonfodder. 

 

Paranormal Liberation Front forces stormed the fortifications for almost two days. They were repelled every time, but they bloodied and tired out the defenders as well. At the beginning of the third day, Geten and the PLF elites broke through the defenders of the Izumi Ward and pushed south, flanking the main defensive line from the west. 

 

The defensive line went into disarray. After the last counterattack against Geten‚Äôs division was repelled, the disarray turned into a general retreat south, with the defenders (heroes, vigilantes, policemen and soldiers) trying to move fast enough to flee the city before the PLF would encircle it and change the city into a deathtrap. 

 

Geten was moving too fast for it to work. 

 

***

 

‚ÄúWell, well, well. If it ain‚Äôt the ice cunt.‚Äù Dabi laughs loudly. He is tired, just slightly beaten up, and generally wants to go home. He spend two days using his quirk to cremate people - if not for two heroes (well, one was a Paragon, which was a PEAK OF FUCKING IRONY) who were constantly cooling him down, he would have burned long ago. 

 

He was pretty much a living artillery battery. And boy if he didn‚Äôt love that. He is certain that he scored a three if not four digit number of kills. Take that, Tenko! 

 

But now everyone was fleeing from the city with whatever means of travel that were available to them. It was almost hilarious to watch, really. 

 

Sure, whoever could do that escaped through the railway south (Geten had overtaken the one leading west thirty minutes ago, so tough luck whoever tried to go that way). The helicopters were pulling people from wherever they could. Ships too. Some planes took off before something large exploded in the direction of the local airport (he has no idea what, but he saw no more planes taking off after that). But the rest, alongside with the locals who HAVE JUST NOW DECIDED (brilliant, really) to fuck off from the city, took whatever was left.

 

Dabi swears that he saw Ms. Joke, Eraserhead and Present Mic book it in some junk passenger car that he isn‚Äôt even sure was theirs. Hilarious, really. Then again, Present Mic was carried inside, and the remaining two were underground heroes, so they probably didn‚Äôt care about appearances that much. 

 

Touya Todoroki had the distinct misfortune in all of that, one that he approaches with suicidal indifference. He ran south. He was close to the westernmost part of the defensive line. His chances of getting out of the city in time were pretty nil considering his positioning AND there was also the part when he lost (more like burned) his phone and the GPS localizer, so he couldn‚Äôt hope for Kurogiri to pick him up. 

 

Of course, just OF FUCKING COURSE he run into Geten. That guy seems to be the second biggest drama queen (well, king) after Izuku‚Äôs dad. Flying in the air on an ice platform, surrounded by a hundred meters long ice dragon and bombarding everything around with shards of ice (plus freezing whatever water source he ran into, before adding it to his flying arsenal). 

 

Looking at Geten makes Dabi want to burn him to death. Just because. His ice, his parka, his fur-lined hood, literally every single part of it pisses Dabi off. Save for his missing arm. Yeah, way to die Boulder. If Dabi survives this, he is drinking in that hero‚Äôs memory. 

 

Not like he likes heroes. 95% are hypocrites that he would prefer dead. Boulder was from the Hero Commission, but apparently wasn‚Äôt that much of an ass. And what‚Äôs most important,  Boulder tore off Geten‚Äôs arm, and Dabi hates Geten intensely, soo‚Ä¶ He can spare some pocket money for a beer. Or a wine. Or something stronger.

 

Fuck, he wants whiskey now. Or vodka. They burn well. In more than one meaning. 

 

‚ÄúYou. Dabi.‚Äù Geten noticed the scarred man standing in front of him. ‚ÄúSon of Endeavor.‚Äù 

 

Oh yeah, Geten‚Äôs gonna get burned today. He really had to mention that name right out of the blue, didn‚Äôt he? 

 

‚ÄúFuck Endeavor.‚Äù Dabi replies. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention that asshole in front of me.‚Äù He expects Geten to rain ice on him. But no. The ice cunt is still floating there. Probably trying to think (if it has the capacity to do it, probably not considering how dumb his face is). Dabi is alright with that, every second makes him cool down more after the recent engagement, and there is always a chance that League will pop up. 

 

‚ÄúYour meta-ability is strong.‚Äù Geten speaks finally. ‚ÄúWhy League? Why not join the Meta-Liberation Army? We need people like you.‚Äù 

 

Someone didn‚Äôt get the memo that Re-Destro was beaten up like a little-bitch and the MLA was no longer a thing. Just the Paranormal Liberation Front. And that Overhaul fights to END strong quirks. 

 

Endeavor was an ass (seriously, fuck Endeawhore now and forever), but at least he considered other forms of training to be valuable. Like, say, basic fucking education. Geten looks like he was trained only in quirk handling.

 

He obviously has the brainpower of a peanut. And a similar body built, to be honest. 

 

Unless the ‚Äòneed you‚Äô is about overthrowing Overhaul when the war ends. Then Geten is smarter than Dabi is giving him credit for. For some reason Dabi doesn‚Äôt think that this is the case. 

 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a fuck about the League!‚Äù Dabi says confidently. ‚ÄúI never did. It was all about my asshole father. I joined Stain, but I would backstab him without a second if I found someone more likely to take down Endeavor. But guess what? Endeavor is dead. Eclipse killed him‚Ä¶ but it was the League that destroyed him. Legion that cornered him and made me describe his crimes to the world.‚Äù Dabi laughs. He knows that it makes him look like a maniac‚Ä¶ but he is one. So it checks out. ‚ÄúThat night in Hosu? Legion became my god back then. And you don‚Äôt betray your god.‚Äù 

 

His cooling support item (Gremlin was a mad scientist, this thing bordered on some cyberpunk-shit-implant if he was to be honest) recharged. His body cooled down a bit. He was ready. 

 

‚ÄúStrong meta-ability.‚Äù Geten replies after a few seconds. ‚ÄúDedication to your leader. Shame. Time to die.‚Äù 

 

Dabi dies twenty minutes later, when he overheats to the point of a fatal heatstroke, even with the cooling apparatus. He leaves a body to bury, unlike Geten who took Prominence Burn attack point blank. There is only ash left.  

 

Dabi‚Äôs last battle delays the PLF encircling maneuver by almost an hour. As a result, the plan of Re-Destro and Overhaul to crush the opposing forces during the first battle fails. PLF forces sustain twenty times the hero casualties, and end up with a city that they captured in exchange for way too much blood.

 

Then again, it‚Äôs not like PLF cares about blood. He has a lot of it to spare. 

 

***

When the message reaches the League, they mourn. Izuku locks himself in his office to cry alone. He doesn‚Äôt want to show himself in this state to the League. He knows that they know, but there is just something deeply wrong in a criminal mastermind crying in public. 

 

This lasts until Mei and Himiko manage to open the office door (despite it being supposedly extremely hard to pick). They then drag him back into the living room, to join the general crying and mourning. They see nothing wrong in the soon-to-be Symbol of Evil crying alongside his family. 

 

He isn‚Äôt even angry when he discovers that they got in because Rabbit secretly copied his office keys, just with such a situation in mind. If anything, he is now even more proud of his younger brother. 

 

***

Day Thirty-Five

 

‚ÄúYou know, there is something deeply wrong in all of that.‚Äù Crawler says. He is talkative as a spotter. She doesn‚Äôt tell him to shut up, because honestly, she likes to have some mental distraction when she is about to shoot. And he knows when to stop talking. 

 

‚ÄúLike?‚Äù Lady Nagant asks. This time they don‚Äôt have the camouflaging vigilante with them, so they are hiding a bit better. Not on a rooftop, to begin with, but in an apartment they rented for the day. They have a third person with them, but he is deeply uncomfortable with the general idea, and is busy watching his family pics on the phone. 

 

‚ÄúLike, I get that we‚Äôre killing people.‚Äù Crawler replies. The burns he sustained during the failed attempt to assassinate the HPSC president still hurt him from time to time. Pop Step shouted a lot of nasty words at them both for letting him get hurt that much, and Lady Nagant doesn‚Äôt look forward to a repetition. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it, and I know this is rather‚Ä¶ extreme situation. I can‚Äôt wait to return to more normal vigilantism. But aren‚Äôt we technically about to kill someone FOR the HPSC president?‚Äù 

 

‚ÄúFor the president, for Nedzu, for Eraserhead, Legion and Knuckleduster.‚Äù Lady Nagant replies. She doesn‚Äôt like the first three words either, but she recognizes that the situation is slightly fucked up. She is still back to trying to kill that whore and dismantle the HPSC as a whole once the war is over. ‚ÄúBesides, Re-Destro and Overhaul are absolute asshats that do the same fucked up stuff as the Commission does, but don‚Äôt bother hiding it.‚Äù 

 

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù Crawler shrugs. ‚ÄúYou got me, I guess. Still, let‚Äôs do it and be done with it. I don‚Äôt like Hokkaido. I can‚Äôt believe that the MLA lackeys really thought that you came here as a tourist, are they really that dumb?‚Äù 

 

She doesn‚Äôt like Hokkaido either. MLA wasn‚Äôt nice to it. It looks like some totalitarian dystopia. Way too many posters about listening to the great leader. 

 

‚ÄúProbably.‚Äù The third person replies absentmindedly. ‚ÄúIt was a notable tourist destination before the coup. Onsens, winter sports and so on. We‚Äôre technically approaching winter, and Principal Nedzu said that my documents were faked in a completely foolproof way, so it makes sense they fell for it. I think.‚Äù Eyes still on the pictures. Crawler and Lady Nagant aren't surprised. 

 

In her opinion, the third person in the room is a bit of an idiot. But a useful idiot, who understands the seriousness of the situation to do exactly what she tells him. And, to be honest, she would be hard-pressed to escape from him if he went after her. Defeating him was almost impossible, and she is willing to admit that much. It‚Äôs probably for the best that they are on the same side. 

 

‚ÄúOho, there he is.‚Äù Crawler announces suddenly, interrupting her thoughts. ‚ÄúStandard route, as we expected. With a crowd of followers.‚Äù 

 

She summons her rifle and finds the target. Crawler quickly scans nearby buildings for potential enemy snipers, heroes on the watch-out and so on. He finds no one. MLA really went easy on the security at some point. Especially now that the majority of their armed forces were sent to the frontline. 

 

Crawler gives her a green light. Lady Nagant pulls the trigger. 2341 meters away from their apartment, Koku Hanabata‚Äôs head has a traumatic meeting with a hollow-point bullet. Former head of the Hearts and Mind Party and the de facto prime minister of the Free Republic of Japan falls down from his campaign van. 

 

‚ÄúTrumpet down.‚Äù Lady Nagant announces to her headset. This is a signal. Underground heroes and vigilantes launch their attacks against numerous targets (primarily governmental buildings and storage areas for war supplies) throughout Hokkaido, before disappearing. The resistance (due to the PLF committing the majority of its forces to the on-going push towards Niigata) is minimal. 

 

Lady Nagant‚Äôs group flees the site in a hurry. They, as Nedzu and the president expected, become the focal point of the attention of the local law enforcement, letting the remaining assault groups reach safety easily. The response to Trumpet‚Äôs assassination is intense. 

 

They are eventually cornered, only for the PLF warriors to discover that the third member of their group is Captain Celebrity, the closest thing the United States have to All Might (and, coincidentally, Koichi‚Äôs friend(?) who considers himself to be in debt to the young vigilante after the Sky Egg incident).

 

It‚Äôs not even a fight, really. When it ends, Lady Nagant and her companions leave Hokkaido without further problems.
Notes:

    Such a cool end - go out in a blaze of glory. Yes, both puns intended.

    Also

    ‚ÄúThat night in Hosu? Legion became my god back then. And you don‚Äôt betray your god.‚Äù 
    Judas, take notes.

    [btw, I find the fact that Dabi died much more heroically than his dad in fic deeply amusing, even if canon Endeavor is 10x better person than canon Dabi]

    Also2:

    THIS FIC WAS WRITTEN IN FULL LITERALLY A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE CANON REVEALED STAR AND STRIPE. Thus I used a certain particularly op American hero that we knew from canon as the single-person international help for the beleagured Japanese heroes. Sorry for that, sigh. Then again, S&S would be imo too overpowered, I can scarcely imagine EVEN Overhaul in his little Super Saiyan mode to be able to fight her ;_; Would really ruin the tension.

Chapter Text

Day Forty-Six

Niigata has fallen. 

It was, honestly, a given. Even without Geten out there to bulldoze through the defensive ranks of the heroes, the Paranormal Liberation Front had more than enough of firepower left to deal with that city. Heroes had to defend both Niigata and the direct route between Sendai and Tokyo. The latter was significantly more important (which didn‚Äôt stop the Fukushima prefecture from mostly falling to the Paranormal Liberation Front relentless march south).

Worst of all (at least to the heroes), Overhaul got his lab back. He was far behind when it came to Purified production (something happened to his prior lab when he deployed his new body, and he was painfully scarce in details), but he managed to field several false-Getens. Each of them could only use a fraction of the original‚Äôs power, but when boosted with Trigger, they could be‚Ä¶ severely dangerous. And there were also the weakened versions of Re-Destro and the remaining Noumus to consider. 

It was a nasty battle. All Might was nowhere in sight (probably ready to show up if Overhaul or original Re-Destro did), but Captain Celebrity butchered the Overhaul‚Äôs menagerie. His presence was nasty surprise to the Paranormal Liberation Front, since absolutely no one knew why the American Number Two Hero (and he was pretty close to Number One slot, really) suddenly threw himself over the Pacific Ocean to assist Japan when the war started. 

Fun fact - you might be a mini-Geten boosted almost to Geten level of power with lethal doses of Trigger (or similar thing but for a Re-Destro), but you‚Äôll still die when someone drops a cruise ship on your head. Christopher Skyline was eventually forced to retreat, but that was less due to wounds and more due to physical exhaustion and the battle beneath him ending.

While the aerial juggernaut was fighting the PLF monsters, the regular warriors and the A-Rankers (entire platoons of A-Rankers, something essentially unheard of in history) bulldozed through the hero defensive lines on the outskirts of the city.

The Paranormal Liberation War was a conflict unheard of during the modern times. The smartest military minds throughout the world were already observing the events, and the number of international hero and villain groups pitching their support for either side grew steadily. The war was akin to the Spanish Civil War - a massive field experiment for modern military tactics and technologies. 

Rules on not using quirks during the international wars still remained. Nobody wanted people like Endeavor or All Might to become one-man-armies for some international conflicts. Dawn of Quirks and then the era when sufficiently powerful quirk users could easily become warlords and rulers of their own empires were long gone and nobody really wanted their return. But knowing what MIGHT have happened if those rules were thrown out of the window was a potentially useful thing. 

And this war‚Ä¶ It was technically a villain insurgency according to international law. Rules were lax.

Paranormal Liberation War proved that heroes on such a battlefield were, in the end, something akin to late middle ages knights. Powerful and unstoppable forces of nature (especially those stronger ones) but ultimately too unruly and lacking discipline. Capable of conquering an area, but faring much worse in holding it. 

Heroes and villains battled it out, but it was the GSDF (with some police reinforcements) and the regular MLA warriors (and QLF soldiers) that held the ground. Majority of skirmishes and smaller battles were waged by those forces, with heroes and villains playing the role of tanks or fighter jets. Something to establish superiority or help in rooting out resistance, but needing support to actually capture and hold something. 

Villains thus far triumphed. Mostly by the virtue of too many heroes being forced to stay behind the frontline to guard their towns from warp-raids, which meant that the villains had numerical superiority over the heroes. The fact that MLA had several times the numbers (and training) of the reestablished GSDF was a major contributing factor. 

Every battle thus far ended with far greater casualties on the PLF side. Every captured town forced the PLF to garrison it. Their superiority in numbers was going to be a fleeting thing, and trying to capture and hold a city as large as Tokyo was going to be a nightmare. 

Their numbers on the frontline were whittled down further after the League of Villains decided to say goodbye to Dabi in their own way and launched a warp-gate raid on Sendai that ended with almost two thousand PLF warriors dead, wounded or gone. Gremlin took down their communication network, Kurogiri warped bombs into several major buildings and the League as a whole spent seven hours hunting for survivors before the Overhaul‚Äôs general staff noticed what was happening in the city and warped in reinforcements. 

Directly into a minefield (made by Gremlin). Covered by the second Mustard‚Äôs poison gas cyclone, with incendiary rounds falling from the skies, courtesy of the Quirkless Equality Movement. 

Someone stole out the PLF plans for deploying reinforcements to that city in case of the League's raid from the PLF headquarters on Hokkaido. Overhaul raged for days. 

Heroes could still slow down the PLF‚Äôs advance more, but they were, in the end, at least partially celebrities, trained to avoid collateral damage. Not hardened soldiers. They, as a whole, still prefered to take the enemy's prisoners if possible. And preferred to retreat (like Sendai and Niigata proved) instead of trying to grind the enemy into a stalemate by warfare of attrition in a place filled with civilians. In both cases the defenders retreated once the line of defense on the city outskirts was broken.

Day Forty-Seven

Chitose Kizuki has a nice day. 

She is the executive director of Shoowaysha Publishing, and one of the most famous journalists in Japan. The war offered a lot of interesting scoops. And the Paranormal Liberation Front was winning it - a crucial thing for someone who (under the codename of Curious) was secretly lieutenant of the Meta-Liberation Army. 

She just finished writing a new article. One subtly questioning the way the current leadership of Japan was handling the current crisis. Something to undermine the war effort without making it obvious that she was in any way connected to Re-Destro. The rest of her company gravitated towards slightly similar political positions, but she did her best to make it appear natural, and in a way connected to the MLA. 

She even made a notable steps to curb quirk-discrimination within her company on two occasions when one of her journalists did something‚Ä¶ too‚Ä¶ rash. Everyone bought it. She was seen as a champion of equality by some, oddly enough. 

She is about to send the article when someone enters her office. 

One of her interns. He asks some rather meaningless questions about his current work. She does her best to appear concerned, when suddenly she feels a slight pinch in her shoulder. 

She looked down to see‚Ä¶ was that a dart?

Curious feels her quirk vanishing from her. Then she sees the pistol in the intern‚Äôs hand. Her mind connects the dots. Her hand rushes towards a well hidden alarm button, but the intern lunges forward and nails her hand to the desk with a knife. 

It was a deception. Her other hand hits the real panic button. But she hears no alarm going off. Her bodyguards don‚Äôt rush inside. Did someone switch her security off? Her office is mostly soundproofed, because she likes to work in peace and quiet, she can‚Äôt just shout for help and...

‚ÄúSurprise!‚Äù The intern laughs and its face warps into that of a yellow-haired girl. ‚ÄúGremlin hacked your security. No help is coming! And all the recording devices in this room just rolled belly-up on us.‚Äù 

Vampire. Himiko Toga. The League of Villains found her. How? 

‚ÄúOh, my.‚Äù Curious smiles. Through pain, but still. She is a veteran journalist, she lived through worse things to get good material. ‚ÄúHimiko Toga. Here for an interview? I would love to make one with you.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNope!‚Äù Vampire smiles back. Curious can see her fangs. ‚ÄúSir Nighteye found evidence for your connections with the MLA. We can‚Äôt really damage the people‚Äôs already waning confidence by making them understand that we have traitors in our midst‚Ä¶ or something. So Zuku offered to make League take you out of the picture. Anonymously.‚Äù 

Chitose‚Äôs mind is still racing to find out a way out of it when Toga leans over her desk. The girl isn‚Äôt tall, but with Curious‚Äôs hand nailed to the desk, she really can‚Äôt rise to match her. 

‚ÄúYou know‚Ä¶ I really love blood. And I like seeing people bleed.‚Äù Toga smiles. Something in that smile has Curious freeze. ‚ÄúBut knowing that would make my beloved Zuku worry. So I don‚Äôt do that normally. Love makes you do the weirdest of things, am I right? But hey‚Ä¶‚Äù She smiles even wider. Curious understands what prey feels when it‚Äôs faced by a predator. ‚Äú...what he doesn‚Äôt get to see won‚Äôt make him worry. So please, scream for me. And don‚Äôt die too fast.‚Äù

Chitose Kizuki no longer has a nice day. 

 

***

Day Fifty-Four

Legion wakes up from his hard-earned nap. Raises from the couch, checks the hour on his watch (he was out for twenty minutes, should be enough with the Long Day) and leaves the room. 

‚ÄúReady to return to work?‚Äù Sir Nighteye is painfully, painfully straight. Probably in a sexual way as well (Izuku isn‚Äôt interested enough to dig for intel about that), but it‚Äôs mostly about his character. He doesn‚Äôt like Legion‚Äôs presence in the UA war room, since Legion is a villain. 

Probably. 

He might as well just be a demanding ass. 

Legion spends fifty minutes helping Sir and Nedzu figure out how to react to the recent developments on the frontlines (namely, Niigata prefecture mostly falling to Overjerk‚Äôs forces alongside with majority of the Tochigi and Ibaraki prefectures, which means that PLF is pretty much on Tokyo‚Äôs outskirts at this point). 

Only when Eraserhead enters with a large coffee thermos (Sir and Legion need it to live at this point, Nedzu is powered up by tea and spite apparently) does Izuku notice that something is wrong. Because Aizawa stares at his face a bit too intently. 

Quick check with his phone confirms his suspicions. While he was asleep, someone sneaked up on him and used a marker on his face. He spent the last fifty minutes in front of Nedzu and Sir Nighteye with a large PLUS ULTRA on his forehead, UA on his left cheek and VILLAINS BAD on his right. 

He vows bloody revenge on Lemillion (because of course it‚Äôs Lemillion) before using his quirk to break his own arm. Kurogiri will warp in another Twice clone of his ten minutes later. 

 

***

‚ÄúYou do realize‚Ä¶‚Äù Eraserhead says ten seconds after Legion turns into mud and then vanishes entirely. ‚Äú... that he is a triple S villain, right?‚Äù Nedzu is too busy laughing like a maniac in the background to answer that. 

Sir simply smiles and asks Eraserhead to dispose of the marker before Legion returns.

 

***

Day Sixty-Four

Inhuman Supremacy Party, together with - oh the irony - remnants of the Creature Rejection Clan were one of the most major problems the Japan had to deal with since the start of the war. 

Not because they joined the Paranormal Liberation Front forces in their march south. PLF requires at least a minimal amount of willingness to cooperate between its member-groups AND enjoys some non-zero amount of discipline among its armies. CRC had the latter, but not the former. ISP had neither and was proud of it. 

Instead, the remaining groups of the ISP (plus the CRC, although it operated independently from its fated archenemy) were tasked with sowing chaos throughout Japan as possible. To keep as many heroes as possible away from the frontline, alongside the regular warp gate raids at various important locations. 

And they sowed a lot of chaos. Thousands died during the last two months. But the ISP and CRC realized way too late that for Overhaul they were expendable. The PLF leader never really cared about the goals of those two groups. Re-Destro was somewhat amenable to at least the ISP stated goals, but not to their methods. He found those barbaric. 

And without minds of Overhaul and Re-Destro behind them, the ISP and CRC become one of the prime targets of Nedzu, Sir Nighteye and Legion. Those three working together created probably the most terrifying thing in the history of the world. 

Nedzu excelled in processing vast quantities of information in order to find seemingly unnoticeable tendencies and connections. Sir Nighteye was a master of conventional investigation (made even more dangerous when Nedzu finally coughed up how he got so much DNA analysis done so perfectly). Legion, in the meantime, was almost unmatched when it came to gathering information from people. He had Vigilante Alliance, Exchange and a lot of other groups under his thumb and he knew how to learn about things from them. And how to interpret what he gained. 

CRC and ISP bases were mostly located by the sixtieth day of the war. Four days later the reckoning came. 

 

***

There was no warning. One moment the complex mutants gathered in the largest ISP base in Gifu Prefecture were enjoying their one-day break from rapine, murder and rape. The next one the ceiling in the main room came down, almost crushing him.

The massive whale-man looks up from his seat just in time to see Captain Celebrity descending into the room, with a fury on his face. 

‚ÄúI have many issues with you.‚Äù Christopher announced, interrupting the deafening silence. ‚ÄúEspecially with the way you tend to treat women. I‚Äôm still willing to accept your surrender, but I‚Äôm not going to ask for it twice.‚Äù 

Curator unleashed his hypersonic wave as an answer. It was, all things considered, a mistake. It wasn‚Äôt a long battle. 

 

***

Bearhead and the remaining two hundred ISP warriors (‚Öì of them former Table heroes, oh the irony) in the Party‚Äôs base in Wakayama‚Äôs prefecture drew the shortest straw of them all. Not exactly their fault. Bearhead preferred new (and still slightly heroic if bloodthirsty) recruits to pulling standard ISP shit. 

Beast was, frankly speaking, insane. Rape as long-term recruitment measure due to the way complex mutant genes overrode the normal human genetics? Ugh, no. Bearhead had to draw a line somewhere. 

Murder was alright, though. People gathered in their base enjoyed it, and no one was hiding it. Tearing humans into pieces was great. Hearing their screams. Some (obviously not the former heroes, although some looked like they were about to fall in line) even ate them. Giving in to their inner beasts (just not ‚ÄòBeasts‚Äô) was like a drug. 

But they had no captives. And the League disliked fallen heroes. Miruko especially was livid with what her former compatriots were doing to civilians. 

Worst of all, Bearhead had absolutely no idea why that pink-haired girl referred to him as ‚ÄòFurry Rikiya-san‚Äô. Then again, he was no longer capable of thinking when she did that through the hacked base‚Äôs intercom. He also was incapable of understanding what she meant by ‚ÄòDetnerat Special‚Äô number 23: The Hate Plague‚Äô. 

The ISP warriors on the base murdered and devoured each other in a frenzy that lasted for hours. The last survivor, too wounded to crawl to the nearest corpse, drove his fangs deep into his own flesh before succumbing to the injuries. 

Two days later the GSDF levelled the base down with artillery and air strikes and spent days decontaminating everything in the vicinity. The entire vicinity of the base was promptly quarantined, and remained that way for close to a decade.

On a positive note, the events of the day make Izuku Midoriya finally succeed in making Mei Midoriya start visiting Hound Dog. 

 

***

The biggest remaining Creature Rejection Clan falls silent finally. It took the new Mustard a while to cover it all with his poison, but it worked well. The gas got everywhere, its doses certifiably deadly to everyone not carrying gas masks. He had friends (for the first time in his life) to defend him while he did so. 

The last hopes for the CRC to resurrect itself after this war die out with that base. There are only some scattered survivors left, lacking leadership, funds, bases and even means of contact with each other. Hatred towards the complex mutants is still there, but the manifestation of it is gone from the world for the time being. 

 

***

The ISP bases in Miyazaki and Tokushima fall quickly and decisively. The former gets visited by All Might himself, and the latter by Lemillion and the rest of the UA Big Three. Despite the war going on, they still do their best to apprehend enemies. 

Those that flee their bases run into the GSDF cordon surrounding it. Soldiers have much less moral issues with fighting to kill. The ISP forces in those prefectures are de facto annihilated overnight. 

 

***

Sunset is kind enough to warp them in and announce their arrival by launching some of her surfaces at the unassuming warehouse. Then she promptly vanishes from the area. She will return later to pick them up. 

The crowd of ISP warriors floods out of the building, shouting expletives and threats. There should be close to one hundred of them here. The warehouse has a large underground area, and is placed right at the edge of the forest. Good location for a base.

Stain recognizes a few faces. Former Table heroes. He had an eye on them for a while now. How did those fakes dare to fall so low? 

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù He says loudly. ‚Äú... who kills more of them, wins?‚Äù 

Miruko grins back at him. 

The massacre lasts for twenty-three minutes. Five ISP warriors manage to escape, taking advantage of Miruko and Stain coming to blows over stealing kills from each other. They run into police and heroes and are secretly relieved to be apprehended. 

 

***

Despite everything that happened thus far, the heroes still look down on the Beast. He manages to fight his way through the encirclement of his headquarters alongside some of his followers. 

The heroes don‚Äôt take that lightly. Beast‚Äôs best attempts to shake them off are for naught. Each time his dwindling army repels an attack, another one is already being prepared. The GSDF is raining artillery rounds on his position constantly. He can see drones flying overhead, relaying his position to the enemy - every attempt to take them down by using the flight-capable mutants is repelled by the heroes. 

This is a nightmare. But the Beast perseveres. He always perseveres. He will not die. He will never die. 

His followers are far less immortal than he is. By the time the dawn comes, Beast is alone, with a long string of complex mutant corpses connecting his current position with his headquarters. 

Somehow, he isn‚Äôt wounded. He is still the muscular juggernaut of claws and fangs. Way too human in his own opinion (why just ears, why is the rest of his head looking so disgustingly human). 

He is still unstoppable. He refuses to get tired. He fought Miruko to a standstill two years ago. Enough for those idiot journalists to start accusing her of going easy on a complex mutant. Easy! Idiots, all of them. 

He spots Kurogiri and leaps at him, without giving the warper time to react. He isn‚Äôt sure why the League is here (and why the heroes aren‚Äôt attacking him again, did he kill enough of them for them to back down?), but he knows that he can‚Äôt give Kurogiri time to warp in reinforcements. 

He spots the trap too late. Kurogiri was a bait. No one was going to get warped in. The enemy was already there. 

Beast leapt towards the warper downwind. They fooled his sense of smell. He was three meters away from Kurogiri when someone jumped at thim from behind a tree that he was just passing by.

The League‚Äôs hand-villain. Beast is half a second too late with his dodge. Decay (Beast remembers his villain name now) touches his hand. 

The contact lasts for maybe a second. Beast falls to the ground, his body paralyzed. What just happened?! He remembers that man‚Äôs quirk, it‚Äôs about decaying. Beast should have lost his hand, not‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúTough luck, father-in-law.‚Äù Decay says, standing over Beast‚Äôs fallen body. ‚ÄúShould have landed more points in Agi, like Suto did. She would have dodged that.‚Äù 

Suto? He knows no-one named like that. Father-in-law in the meantime‚Ä¶ Decay married one of his progeny? That Suto, maybe?

He has a lot of children. Some end up joining the ISP when the world shouts at them that they are the child of a monster one time too many. Way more were probably aborted before their birth. Shame. 

‚ÄúBe happy that I don‚Äôt kill people anymore.‚Äù Decay ads. ‚ÄúIt hurts her. So I stopped. There are more ways of making people like you stop killing people like her.‚Äù 

Suto, it seems, is a weakling. 

‚ÄúLike what, paralyze me temporarily and wait for heroes to come arrest me?‚Äù Beast laughs. ‚ÄúIt will stop working before they come. Then I‚Äôm going to stand up and do my utmost best to murder whoever Suto is in front of you. Maybe I‚Äôll rape her first. How will you like that?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt.‚Äù Tenko doesn‚Äôt seem fazed at all. ‚ÄúI decayed most of your motor nerves. Your body will never move again.‚Äù 

Beast is still lying on the ground, screaming in impotent rage, when the heroes find him.

Day Seventy-Two

SmallMight: Do we have any estimates on how many soldiers the PLF has as of now?

Principal: They seem to be getting further reinforcements from overseas. Even with Trumpet dead, they still get new recruits from the local sources. They lost a few dozen thousand dead and wounded but if anything, the HPSC estimates they are getting close to 300 000. 

SmallMight: Where are they taking them from?! 

Principal: Apparently, China. Mostly.

SmallMight: Well why am I not surprised.

Principal: Local warlords are probably looking forward to spoils and gathered influence. Not to mention most of them being a varied degree of quirk supremacist. Or just wanting to mess Japan up for kicks.

SmallMight: The point is, I don‚Äôt think that Eclipse‚Äôs quirk has such a range. We keep killing pseudo-Getens, they are powerful but not THAT powerful. 

Principal: Oh?

SpyingEye: So it‚Äôs some sort of several stage-connection between Japan and China?

SmallMight: Yeah, so international warp-railway. I mean, Re-Destro is on the north-east end of Japan, so he has to use several-stage-connection to get reinforcements from China. 

Principal: I‚Äôll contact my associates in Korea. They most likely have at least a single step of the line on their territory. 

SpyingEye: And I‚Äôll try to investigate for potential PLF presence on some minor isles in the region. There is also a possibility that they are using some ships as transit stations, I‚Äôll look into that as well.

SmallMight: Great.

SmallMight: You do that.

SmallMight: Because if you include Hokkaido we lost more than 50% of Japanese territory already to the Overjerk, and I don‚Äôt like that. At all. Especially as we are starting to see the Purified on the frontlines again. 

NapNeeded: Thank you. I managed to spend like 50 minutes not thinking about this. 

AllRight: At least they aren‚Äôt attacking Tokyo. 

SmallMight: Unfortunately they aren‚Äôt attacking Tokyo.

AllRight: ???

SmallMight: They could - at best - gather 150 000 soldiers for that battle. 150 000 soldiers isn‚Äôt enough to take down a metropolis like Tokyo. If they attacked it, the collateral damage would be horrifying but the PLF would be crushed or grievously overextended after winning. 

SmallMight: But they keep away from Tokyo and only take out surrounding cities (like almost everything north of Tone river as of now). 

SmallMight: We can‚Äôt counterattack with the heroes from Tokyo, because then the enemy might win and then we‚Äôll lose Tokyo way too easily. 

SmallMight: and how long can we supply the entire agglomeration through its ports if the PLF surrounds it all?  

Principal: Nagano fell yesterday. They are clearly trying to march around Tokyo. Towards Nagoya or, well, Shizuoka. And UA. I‚Äôve already begun improving the school‚Äôs defenses. Because honestly, I think the frontline will reach us eventually. 

SmallMight: Overjerk still isn‚Äôt popping up. But I think we got some of his lieutenants down, by now? He can copy quirks of Trumpet and Curious, but not their other skills and position. Similar to Geten (most of the copies are only briefly reaching his level, after a lethal dose of Trigger).

SpyingEye: I think he gets new ones.

SpyingEye: Humarise Cult (notable anti-quirk extremist cult from Europe) members have been spotted by some of the local heroes. 

SmallMight: Jesus. Fucking. Christ. Can we just nuke north Japan and be done with it, please?

Principal: I don‚Äôt have access to nukes.

SmallMight: What about uranium? I‚Äôm 99% sure Gremlin can refine it quickly and cheaply. 

Principal: ‚Ä¶

TinTinCan: We‚Äôll pretend we didn‚Äôt hear it.
Notes:

    Midoriya: I'm going to make my best friend less murderous!
    Tenko: Ok
    Tenko: *stops killing*
    Tenko: *somehow gets fucking scarier*
    Midoriya: uhm
    Midoriya: task failed successfully?

    The same with Mei and Himiko. He makes them SLIGHTLY better, but when the oversight weakens... Hound Dog has his work cut out for him, ngl.

Chapter Text

Day  Eighty-One

Midoriya Inko takes the cup of tea from Gentle, and thanks him with a nod. Danjuro earned a good place in her book over helping Izuku with his USJ attack (and thus, with Thunderbolt‚Äôs death), and continues doing his best to stay there. 

And he has a good taste in tea. That‚Äôs important. 

If only her Izuku would drop the coffee in favour of tea. This is, objectively speaking, a much healthier and tastier drink. He would certainly feel better, and...

Mr. Compress lets her drink some of it in silence, before reminding her of his existence by loudly clearing his throat. He isn‚Äôt wearing his mask. He never does that in the Levellers‚Äô hideout. 

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm sorry, Atsuhiro.‚Äù She quickly snaps herself back in place. ‚ÄúI was thinking about Izuku. What were we talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúNew potential recruits for the Levellers, Inko.‚Äù They dropped the honorifics a while ago. You don‚Äôt steal the Japanese government together and NOT get closely acquainted in the process. ‚ÄúVolcano Thieves.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not so sure about them.‚Äù Inko replies honestly. It was hard to find a thief that didn‚Äôt want to work with the Levellers after their National Diet stunt. If only to bask in the glory. Or watch how the great ones work to improve themselves.

‚ÄúIs it about their boss?‚Äù Mr. Compress asks. ‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt exactly‚Ä¶ low-profile. Honestly I‚Äôm not sure why he isn‚Äôt doing heavier crimes. He is built like Endeavor and is just as likely to burn everything down.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs about that Dusty Ash woman.‚Äù Inko replies. ‚ÄúDid you see what she is wearing? I don‚Äôt want her to influence Izuku‚Äôs wives.‚Äù 

Mr. Compress chuckles. Ms. Compress looks at them weirdly from her couch. Twice is still oddly shy with them and is playing a game on his phone next to Atsuhiro‚Äôs sister. Non - Atsuhiro‚Äôs beloved son - is currently in school, learning things from Kurogiri. 

Suddenly something happens. Mr. Compress pulls his phone out and checks something on the Villain Network. 

‚ÄúYou know, Inko‚Ä¶‚Äù He says after a few seconds. ‚Äú... that your son is an absolutely brilliant young man that I love to work with?‚Äù He shakes his head. ‚ÄúI regret not joining the League earlier. We would make so many wonderful heists together.‚Äù 

She is still eyeing him curiously when he starts describing what Izuku just told the Levellers to do. Her eyes grow progressively wider. 

‚ÄúYou know, it‚Äôs actually quite sad that due to Aiko‚Ä¶‚Äù She pats her belly. It‚Äôs not yet visible, but she is NOT going to risk anything happening to her new daughter. ‚Äú... I won‚Äôt be able to be there with you.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNot a problem, Inko.‚Äù Atsuhiro smiles. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll help us with planning. And I‚Äôm sure that your heart will be with us. And perhaps something more than that.‚Äù

Day  Eighty-Three

 

NapNeeded: Humarise fanatics just tried to detonate a gas bomb in Tokyo. 

SmallMight: Oh. Great.

SmallMight: Tried?
NapNeeded: I was on their trail for a while. Underground heroes jumped them up right before detonation.

SmallMight: Any idea what sort of gas that was? Quirk-suppression?

NapNeeded: I think just a normal poison gas.

SmallMight: Ugh. 

Principal: Anyone important?

NapNeeded: Sidero and Rogone. Beros was there too, but she managed to escape. 

SmallMight: Flect Turn is probably preaching behind the frontline. Tsk.

SpyingEye: How is your mysterious ‚Äòspecial assignment that will change the course of war‚Äô going?

SmallMight: Oh it‚Äôs going pretty great. But not saying a word about it until we‚Äôre ready. But when it happens, I‚Äôll need Principal, Ninja and probably All Might and Captain Celebrity on the standby. Time will be of the essence. 

SpyingEye: ‚Ä¶ are you afraid of a leak?

SmallMight: no, just a bit of a drama queen waiting for the Big Reveal

SpyingEye: the only reason why I‚Äôm not saying that Mr. Compress is influencing you is because I‚Äôm afraid that you‚Äôll storm out of the alliance over that

SmallMight: I‚Äôll most certainly do that. Don‚Äôt bring the Clown Uncle into this. 

SmallMight: any news from the frontline?

FashionStatement: Kofu will hold for two or three more days. Not enough firepower, and way too many Purified. They are attacking us twice or thrice a day, and we‚Äôre slowly getting too exhausted to continue fighting. 

FashionStatement: We‚Äôll try to delay their advance south after retreating from the city - there are only a few roads going towards Shizuoka - but I‚Äôm afraid that if you want to climb Mount Fuji, it‚Äôs probably the last moment to do that in a while. 

FashionStatement: Unless you actually have some meaningful reinforcements to send? I almost lost my arm today and it‚Äôs NOT fashionable at all. 

SmallMight: I might pitch a regiment-size unit of the Quirkless Equality Movement (with reasonable morale honestly, UA has a good place in their books for those quirkless hero slots and everyone knows that Overjerk is pushing south to get to the UA). 

SmallMight: but not before tomorrow evening, warping them will take a while and we need a while to gather them up (Sunset isn‚Äôt keeping close to a thousand de facto terrorists in a single location, we aren‚Äôt dumb idiots like the ISP). 

FashionStatement: That would be helpful, but frankly speaking we need some heavy-hitters to deal with the Purified the most. QEM will help keep the MLA riff-raff at bay, but‚Ä¶ 

SmallMight: I‚Äôll send Nine‚Äôs crew and tell Sunset to stay as combat support, that‚Äôs seriously all that I have to spare at this point, the warp counter-raids are REALLY tiring the League out. 

SmallMight: Where's All Might and Captain Celebrity btw.? I thought that at least the former would be helping Best Jeanist.

Principal: Captain is assisting the HPSC units trying to slow down the PLF march towards Nagoya. All Might is in Tokyo. It‚Äôs almost encircled and we need him there to suppress the general panic. 

SmallMight: understandable.

Day Ninety-Four

FashionStatement: Kofu has fallen. 

FashionStatement: We‚Äôre retreating south towards Shizuoka.

FashionStatement: We‚Äôll do our best to delay the enemy. 

FashionStatement: @SmallMight We‚Äôve lost contact with the QEM regiment, I think they retreated east towards Tokyo, but can‚Äôt confirm, they are either dead or something is jamming their comms.

SmallMight: Sunset and Kurogiri are evacuating them, I‚Äôm a bit busy doing the rearguard action together with the rest of the League, we‚Äôll contact you later

SpyingEye: What? What happened? I thought PLF was retreating?

FashionStatement: It was until it wasn‚Äôt. Overjerk (yes, I‚Äôm using that name too at this point) sent ninety Purified, including ten with gigantification quirks as a vanguard. The collateral damage and civilian casualties are probably terrible. 

FashionStatement: If the League didn‚Äôt warp in what I assume to be the fabled Gigantomachia and have it set a one-man-charge at the enemy flank, we would all die here. He kept them occupied long enough for us to disengage (still alive, League warped him out, but he looked seriously beaten up).

FashionStatement: It will be a miracle if more than half of the Kofu defenders got out. 

FashionStatement: Majestic, Death Arms and Air Jet dead, Snipe vanished somewhere and I don‚Äôt know what happened to him. No less than two GSDF regiments destroyed, we‚Äôll probably piece up a company or two from the survivors once they stop wandering the woods or sneak out of the city. 

FashionStatement: This is a disaster. Less retreat and more a rout. 

Principal: Oh dear.

Principal: When the League evacuates, I‚Äôll ask Legion to have Kurogiri warp in Captain Celebrity to give you some breathing space. 

Principal: Nevermind. The PLF is attacking Nagoya outskirts and HPSC has nothing to spare. Overjerk deployed even more Purified there.

 

***

Not exactly a romantic situation. Not exactly a proper day for it. But something in Izuku broke when he saw Himiko almost die during the League‚Äôs desperate battle. Sure, they won - or, to be exact, they managed to retreat. Sure they didn‚Äôt lose anyone permanently (thanks to Overhaul‚Äôs quirk - otherwise half of the League members wouldn‚Äôt make it). But still. 

It might have been the adrenaline. But it did give him enough courage to fight through all the many questions and issues and anxiety-driven doubts he had about making that step. Himiko was absolutely overjoyed and ready to play along. 

It was a very nice evening. At least for them. Izuku managed to not think about how Japan is slowly going to hell outside of the walls of the League‚Äôs headquarters for a while.

 

***

Day Ninety-Six

SmallMight: Execution of my secret master plan in three hours. 

SmallMight: I need Captain Celebrity/All Might, Nedzu, Edgeshot and whatever hero you have that‚Äôs capable of assaulting a building and taking down its defenders and personnel before they manage to destroy any data on a standby. 

SmallMight: If the Commission has someone who can tear information out of someone‚Äôs memory or something like that, we need them as well.

SmallMight: And then even more to strike against the Warp Railway and Overjerk‚Äôs laboratories (but we‚Äôll have to do super quickly, hence Nedzu and probably Gremlin to crack their security and find out details before they manage to react). 

Principal: I‚Äôm going to require some explanations to have them give us anything.

SmallMight: You remember Mr. Compress stealing the National Diet? 

Principal: ‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre joking, right?

AllRight: What?

SmallMight: In three hours, Mr. Compress is going to steal the headquarters of the Paranormal Liberation Front, together with the Overjerk‚Äôs entire command staff, Skeptic, their war plans, their logistical plans, spy reports and whatever else. And then Kurogiri is going to warp it back to mainland Japan. 

SmallMight: All Might/Celebrity have to be there in case they kidnapped the Overjerk and/or Re-Destro too, accidentally. 

TinTinCan: If you ever say that your father was a ‚Äòdrama queen‚Äô, I‚Äôm calling you out on it SOOOO much.

SmallMight: I‚ÄôM JUST DOING MY BEST DAMMIT

SmallMight: Overjerk or Re-Destro will figure out my plans if I don‚Äôt make them this grotesquely crazy. 

SmallMight: Sunset is ready to act as a taxi for HPSC forces for this

Principal: Location of this‚Ä¶ delicious event?

SmallMight: Can UA spare me some large open space, please? We need some area with warp coordinate scramblers to prevent Overjerk from warping in reinforcements and evacuating the staff. 

Principal: Oh but of course! I‚Äôll gladly help in this wonderful endeavor! 

 

***

‚ÄúOh how I love becoming a part of history!‚Äù Mr. Compress shouts loudly as the headquarters of the former MLA begin to shrink under the tender attention of fifty of his clones. 

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you already part of the history after the National Diet, Atsu?‚Äù His sister (oh how happy he is to have her back) retorts. She is the seriousness to his overt‚Ä¶ colourfulness of personality. He was incomplete when she wasn‚Äôt there. Even her white/black costume only embellished Mr. Compress‚Äô colourfulness. 

‚ÄúWell I think that I deserve to become a part of history twice. Or, perhaps, Twice?‚Äù He says and takes off his mask just enough to make her see his winking. She retorts with a loud ‚ÄòUgh‚Äô and looks away. 

Mischief clone that came with them from Japan summons the marble. The headquarters had warp coordinate scramblers, but it‚Äôs not like they work when compressed like that. Kurogiri picks them up. Overjerk arrives ten minutes later together with Re-Destro and butchers the remaining clones of Mr. and Ms. Compress in thirty-seven seconds. 

 

***

The weird distortion of space around them vanishes. Skeptic - the head of Re-Destro command-staff and the de-facto head of the intelligence department of the Meta Liberation Army - finds himself standing as he did, in his office. 

The view behind his office window changed. The computer shuts down, and there is a power outage. His laptop is still working. 

His mind finds the answer almost immediately. Compress. He uses his quirk on the table, he is going to need every soldier he can to‚Ä¶

The window bursts open. Lemillion, the All Might‚Äôs successor. He crosses the distance in a heartbeat, his hand landing on Skeptic‚Äôs face. 

Sleeping gas. Point blank, from a glove. Skeptic falls down, his consciousness fading. He doesn‚Äôt hear the sounds of desperate - and brief - fight of the building‚Äôs security units as more heroes storm in from every direction. He doesn‚Äôt see Captain Celebrity flying into his office, carrying Nedzu, Gremlin and Dreamer. 

He does feel it when the Number Eight Hero (the Commission isn‚Äôt in the mood to announce new rankings despite so many heroes dying) falls asleep and enters his sleeping mind, cracking it open and pulling out as many of the PLF secrets as she can. But he fails to resist her. 

What Nedzu and Gremlin do to his computer when the auxiliary power generator kicks in is something he doesn‚Äôt find out about until he wakes up in a jail cell. 

 

***

Nedzu goes on a rampage after he and Gremlin manage to open up the entire computer system in front of them. He shifts through tens of thousands of pages of text within minutes, his High Spec quirk powered up fully. He finds names. Locations. Bank accounts. He speaks through the phone to the president of the Hero Commission and for the first time in the history of their work relationship, she says nothing back. She listens. And issues orders to her staff. 

The Warp-Railway through Korea is severed by the local police and heroes who storm the buildings (mostly half-ruined warehouses) secretly owned by Detnerat shell companies. Everywhere throughout Japan the hidden MLA members are ousted and arrested by the heroes, police and the Paragons - the list including every single spy that the PLF had. Bank accounts through which the money flows from outside supporters to the PLF are frozen. Foreign governments and corporations that decided to (for a variety of reasons) support the villain group discover their support to no longer be a well-guarded secret.  

Nedzu and the HPSC dismantle the entire support framework of the PLF - the entire secret empire of information, cash flow and material support allowing it to engage a much bigger country in an open war. They do that within two hours. 

Dreamer ads more when she wakes up. Such as a final confirmation that the Overhaul that they are facing is the final copy. The uncontrolled burst of his quirk after awakening levelled his primary lab down. It was going to take months to finish the next version of his body (the discovery that they were facing a monster with less than 25% of what it could have startles everyone).

PLF won‚Äôt have that time - All Might destroys the lab where the next body is worked on before being warped back to UA by Kurogiri. The Overhaul‚Äôs perfect body is destroyed in its incomplete state and without a quirk transfer happening. With the lab destroyed thoroughly, it will take Overhaul no less than six months to restore what was lost. 

They also understand the Overhaul‚Äôs long term plan. Take over Japan to be allowed to look for Eri (the only hope for an actual mass-scale permanent anti-quirk weapon rather than complicated surgical and biochemical procedures that created the Purified) without interference and with the government‚Äôs strength behind him. Izuku doesn‚Äôt comment on that, but Overhaul is probably booking on All for One‚Äôs unwillingness to just move out if that happens. 230+ of life, and yet he left Japan only a few times (and never for longer than two months). Besides, All for One RUNNING AWAY? 

Four more laboratories on Hokkaido are destroyed or damaged by missile strikes of the Maritime Self-Defense Force ships, severely delaying Overhaul‚Äôs ability to clone quirks and limiting PLF‚Äôs capability to produce the new Purified. 

It isn‚Äôt all that happens, though. When the attention of Japan is focused on all those operations, League of Villains cheerfully ignores international borders and uses Sunset to launch an unexpected raid on the international base that Overhaul used before annexing the Meta-Liberation Army and moving over to Hokkaido. It is mostly abandoned at this point. There are some noumus stationed there and a handful of bored QLF soldiers. But there is also something more. Something that even Overhaul forgot about. 

The base is thoroughly destroyed before the League returns back to Japan with their spoils.

Day One Hundred

Principal: I wish to officially announce that the Battle of Nagoya has ended.

Principal: PLF forces are pulling back and shortening the frontline in the west. 

SmallMight: Oh shit, finally a major city that they attacked but didn‚Äôt capture.

Principal: This isn‚Äôt a lot to be happy about, but yes, it is something to be happy about. 

Principal: The casualties are‚Ä¶ something not to be happy about. That was probably the fiercest battle of the war, since if Nagoya fell, Shizuoka would too. And the Keihanshin would be open bare before Overjerk. Even Tokyo (we all heard about the riots and the food rationing) might have surrendered. 

Principal: HPSC did everything save for issuing a no retreat order and putting those who broke it before firing squad to repel the attack this time. 

TinTinCan: Do I want to ask about the casualties?

Principal: I was going to announce them regardless

Principal: Paragons: 34 dead, 72 wounded [Valiant and Foresight, number 3 and 4, are dead] 

Principal: Heroes: 92 dead, 450 wounded. [Fourth Kind, Snatch and Takeshita dead, Ryukyu, Rock Lock and Uwabami heavily wounded, from more notable names]

Principal: 15 000+ dead GSDF members, twice more wounded or lost. 

Principal: PLF casualties estimated at 150+ Purified, 50 remaining noumus, 30 Geten clones, and 15 Re-Destro clones, 100+ A-Rankers from Tartarus and no less than 40 000 regular warriors dead, arrested or too heavily wounded to return to the war. 

Principal: Civilian casualties‚Ä¶ might be approaching 150 000 in dead, wounded and lost, especially due to the mass deployment of gigantified Purified and Geten clones freezing entire districts 

TinTinCan: I hope this war ends soon. We are losing too many civilians. Too many heroes. 

SmallMight: *pats the back*

SmallMight: I believe that the stunt with stealing their headquarters that we pulled was enough to stop their advance. They no longer held the advantage. There‚Äôll be now a period of a stalemate before we‚Äôll start pushing them back. 

SpyingEye: I believe that you are wrong.

SmallMight: Oh?

SpyingEye: Thus far Overjerk responded to every failure (Training Camp battle, Tartarus attack) by organizing an even greater attack. I see no reason why he would react differently this time. 

SpyingEye: He still has a lot of spare firepower left. 

SpyingEye: And he knows that Nedzu and the UA helped arrest Skeptic and dismantle his support network. 

SmallMight: shit

Principal: Oh, dear. 

SpyingEye: My opinion is that since he can‚Äôt capture Nagoya or Tokyo, he will instead attack the target that he can capture. Shizuoka - and Musutafu. And this time he and Re-Destro will probably show up in person. 

SmallMight: And probably with his own warp coordinate scramblers to keep the League grounded. Like he did during the Tartarus attack. 

SmallMight: @Principal requesting permissions for the UA to house the League members for the time being. 

Principal: Permissions granted. In exchange we would like to ask for Twice to create a copy of All Might, so that the original can stay in the UA. 

SmallMight: and the copy to stay in Tokyo for morale sake, ah 

SmallMight: Sure, no problem

SmallMight: Keep Captain Celebrity around as well, we might need him. 

 

***

Day One Hundred Three

SmallMight: new info from the frontline

SmallMight: Vigilante Alliance (with slight help from the League and our magnificent @NapNeeded) just eliminated or apprehended the Humarise Cult leadership. Flect Turn included.

Principal: Oh?

SpyingEye: Great! How did you do it? Wasn‚Äôt he hiding in some fortress with warp coordinate scramblers? 

Principal: And a small army of fanatics around him.

TinTinCan: Behind the frontlines, too. 

SmallMight: Compress marbled Alliance‚Äô assault party +Eraserhead and Twice copies of himself and Lady Nagant. Lady Nagant fired them from her gun through the window, the impact forcing the marble open, Eraserhead stared Flect Turn down while Lady Nagant shot him dead, with his Reflection down. Pop Step and Crawler apprehended Beros while Knuckleduster and the rest of Naruhata Vigilantes did the same to Serpenters. Then the Compress clone marbled everyone and Lady Nagant copy fired them back from the window, before the Cult reinforcements arrived. 

SmallMight: It‚Äôs like a warp, just works under scramblers, has a low range and includes guns. 

TinTinCan: ‚Ä¶

SpyingEye: ‚Ä¶

Principal: ‚Ä¶

Principal: Would you like to join the UA as a student under a false name once the war ends?

AllRight: The only thing that stops me from vomiting myself into death by blood loss at this suggestion is the fact that I have my lung back. 

SmallMight: @Principal find a time-altering quirk to send this offer to me prior to USJ attack, mention where to find every single League member we obtained afterwards and how to kill Overjerk to super death before he becomes a problem and we can talk about this

SmallMight: Right now I‚Äôm a bit too invested in being a supervillain, sorry

Principal: Understandable

SpyingEye: I beg to differ, but I‚Äôm also utterly unsurprised by your understanding of this. 

 

***

SmallMight: Mirio

SmalMight: you there

TinTinCan: Depends

TinTinCan: I‚Äôm on the frontline, we‚Äôre going to counterattack some small town that the PLF forces just pushed the GSDF out

SmallMight: I kinda forgot to mention this earlier (a lot happened since the start of the war)

SmallMight: MOM IS PREGNANT

SmallMight: I‚ÄôM GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER SISTER!!!

 

(Yoichi perks up in his seat, smile on his face)


TinTinCan: ‚Ä¶ what are the chances of her being another blatantly op and way too smart Class Six user? 

SmallMight: oh shoo

SmallMight: You‚Äôre no fun

SmallMight: Also Eri isn‚Äôt AlO‚Äôs biological daughter and she still has a Class-Six quirk, it (probably) doesn‚Äôt work like that

TinTinCan: Sigh

TinTinCan: Considering the fact that literally his every child thus far is a way too smart Class-Six quirk user, I‚Äôm going to stay cautious

TinTinCan: Congrats, I guess

TinTinCan: Be so kind and make her into another little hero like Eri, alright? I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing her attend the UA heroics course. Recovery Girl really needs to retire finally. 

SmallMight: now ain‚Äôt you a demanding one

SmallMight: I‚Äôll try to NOT make her into AfO2, I can promise that much

TinTinCan: Great

TinTinCan: Keep the heroes vs villains thing a bit more balanced pls, we need some Midoriyas‚Äô on our side

TinTinCan: Decided on name already?

SmallMight: Aiko. 

TinTInCan: Love Child? Really?

SmallMight: You wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you saw how disgustingly romantic my parents are with each other right now. Seriously, omg, it‚Äôs as if they met each other again and fell in love for the second time.

SmallMight: I‚Äôm like 95% sure that desire to brutally murder Overjerk together connected them like that 

SmallMight: I swear they make the same face when they see him in the media and if anything mom looks scarier than dad

SmallMight: If I were Overjerk, I‚Äôd kill myself to avoid the pain at this point

TinTinCan: eh, when was the last time the two of us just talked like that 

TinTinCan: or played videogames

SmallMight: videogames before the war started, talking occasionally but less often than I‚Äôd like to

SmallMight: you are fighting on the frontline, I‚Äôm strategizing or doing some warp raids, scaring and killing PLF troopers

SmallMight: I lost count of how many times the League members died but were brought back by me ugh

SmallMight: and I‚Äôm trying to not think about the kill-count because ugh

SmallMight: It‚Äôs uncomfortable

TinTinCan: And how‚Äôs your love life going? Did it even go anywhere?

SmallMight: ‚Ä¶ errrr

SmallMight: let‚Äôs just say that the biggest problem I‚Äôm facing right now is Himiko sneaking handcuffs and weirder things into our bedroom. I keep confiscating them but she just refuses to take a hint. 

TinTinCan: ‚Ä¶ 

TinTinCan: who is supposed to be wearing them?

SmallMight: Just

SmallMight: cease

SmallMight: and

SmallMight: fucking

SmallMight: desist

SmallMight: please

TinTinCan: I‚Äôll think about this xD

SmallMight: And you?
TinTinCan: Looking forward to returning home AND meeting my girlfriend. We were actually planning to get married once I graduated (I technically did two months ago), but‚Ä¶ yeah. Things got complicated. War and so on. 

SmallMight: is that Nejire

TinTinCan: What? 

TinTinCan: No?

TinTinCan: Why does everyone assume that she is my girlfriend 

TinTinCan: I get it that heroes around me date heroes and villains date villains (always those close to them, apparently) but my girlfriend is working in a cat cafe near UA -_-‚Äô

SmallMight: this is weird

TinTinCan: no it‚Äôs not

SmallMight: who is Nejire into then

TinTinCan: you aren‚Äôt going to believe, what‚Äôs worst it‚Äôll probably strengthen your outlook on heroes x nearby heroes and villains x nearby villains pairings ugh

SmallMight: WAIT, TAMAKI?! 

TinTinCan: maaaybe

SmallMight: it‚Äôs the tentacles, right?

TinTinCan: You‚Äôre really trying to set the heroes in my head against yourself, aren‚Äôt you?

SmallMight: huh

TinTinCan: feel free to continue talking about relationships, it‚Äôs a welcome diversion for me. One for one?

SmallMight: Mindscrew and Split are into each other REAL HARD but they seem to be worse at it than me. I think that at least Hitoshi has yet to realize he is in love and this is really, really awful to watch.

TinTinCan: Bakugou Katsuki is dating Uraraka Ochaco, ever since the latter returned from Gunhead‚Äôs internships and proved capable of beating him up with her bare hands in close quarters. At this point I think that she is the one wearing trousers in their relationship. 

SmallMight: ‚Ä¶ you almost made me choke to death on a sandwich.

Day One Hundred Five

Principal: PLF forces broke through the frontline. 

Principal: Best Jeanist presumed KIA. Snipe MIA again. Cementoss and Chimera dead. Nine heavily wounded. 

Principal: Overhaul and Re-Destro will reach UA in two days. 

Principal: With no less than 200 Purified. 

SmallMight: Well, fuck. Plan B it is.
Notes:

    In my defense, I based the Humarise on their wiki entries because I didn't watch the film. Serpenters are much more op than I thought. Then again, Vigilante Alliance (even the Naruhata branch of it) includes some former pro heroes. So maybe it checks out.

    We're approaching the conclusion of the Paranormal Liberation War. In fact, that's going to happen in the next chapter.

Chapter 60: Paranormal Liberation War [IV]
Summary:

    The war ends.

Notes:

(See the end of the chapter for notes.)
Chapter Text

***

Day One Hundred Seven

The forces Overhaul brought to attack the UA were massive. Musutafu was evacuated (in a hurry), and its streets were filled with PLF troops. Two hundred Purified, a crowd of remaining noumus (including the sole still standing High End), dozens of Geten and Re-Destro clones, thousands of regular warriors and no less than a hundred A-Ranker escapees. 

Plus, of course, Re-Destro and Overhaul themselves. This time there was no pulling back punches. 

In front of them lies the UA. Currently - after Nedzu‚Äôs maniacal monetary spending ever since the start of the war - the best defended place in Japan. UA Wall was expanded into a towering, several level monstrosity armed to the teeth with automatic guns, anti-tank cannons and even missile launchers.

The entire security had several back-ups, including no less than three separate drone networks capable of taking over the whole thing, with the defences continuing to work even if the PLF amassed all their technopaths in their army for a single attack. This was going to be no Tartarus. 

The enemies that would fight their way through the UA Wall would have found themselves facing the second line of defenses - a network of bunkers and pillboxes (established by late Cementoss before his departure for the frontlines) garrisoned by the GSDF forces with support of the pro-heroes, vigilante and villains (of the League) that Nedzu managed to gather before Overhaul reached his school. 

Plus, of course, robots. Lots of robots. Including thirty Executors, known to the school students as the 0-Pointers. This time with all limiters off, like they were during the Training Camp attack. Lethal attacks, no automatic shutdowns after being hit anywhere with sufficient strength. It was a war, after all. 

If both defense lines were going to fall, the defenders were going to fall back to the actual school grounds, where they would hold the ground until the plan B (the joint - and rather desperate - creation of Legion and Sir Nighteye) could be executed.

The battle started with the remaining QLF units shelling the school grounds from a distance. The counter-battery fire silenced them within three minutes, with Nedzu and Power Loader directing the artillery units of GSDF, QEM and UA to open fire upon the advancing army. 

 

***

The biggest miscalculation of the Paranormal Liberation Front during the Battle for UA were the automatic defenses of the UA Wall. There was a reason why guns were optional in the modern world of crimes. Stronger quirk users could either tank, dodge or kill from a distance every gun user. The UA Wall carried some really nasty guns, but the PLF had Purified. So no biggy, right?

Wrong. 

PLF now non-existent spies failed to notice that one of the companies participating in the UA Wall expansion project was in fact a shell company of the Villain Industries. Nedzu refused to take any chances with the defenses of his beloved school. He had David Shield inspect every single one of Gremlin‚Äôs additions to the Wall, in order to make sure that the League sneaked in no surprises. And even then, he was still going to tear it down after the war ended. 

The combination of the engineering genius of David Shield and the engineering madness of Gremlin (with some organizational and planning help from Power Loader) created one of the most terrifying things in history. Especially as Nedzu greenlighted the addition of some choice Detnerat Specials to the mix. 

The result of that was a massacre. Horrifying, trauma-inducing massacre that almost turned the Paranormal Liberation Front attack into a total rout. Scenes in front of the UA Wall wouldn‚Äôt be surprising on the fields of Flanders during the First World War, but in the modern times they were shocking.

Without the Purified, the assault on the UA would end before it started. The gigantified Purified marched as a vanguard, shrugging off even the heaviest of blows with their additional resistance-increasing and regeneration quirks. That was part of Nedzu's plan, however - they might have approached the UA Wall, but Captain Celebrity and All Might were there, jumping or flying between wall sections, wiping them out one by one while the Overhaul and his command staff could only throw curses at them. 

Two more died as Gremlin fired her slightly oversized railgun from the rooftop of the UA main building. The energy consumption was terrifying, but making the heads of living, kaiju-sized tanks vanish in a cloud of red was certainly one way of establishing a superiority on the battlefield. 

Overhaul‚Äôs strongest blade was blunted. Eventually the smaller Purified tore through the turrets on the UA Wall and Re-Destro himself caved in the main UA gate with his fists, but the price for that was enormous. During the first thirty minutes of the assault, PLF lost no less than thirty thousand soldiers (wounded, traumatized, dead - or worse) and fifty Purified. 

Overhaul shouted in anger and ordered his Eclipse clones to move outside of the range of the UA coordinate scramblers to start warping in reinforcements. The battle was going to be much more bloody than he anticipated. 

Oh if only he knew. 

 

***

The PLF forces poured onto the UA grounds only to discover several nasty things. The first one that they discovered almost instantly was the fact that the mines used during the last school festival weren‚Äôt the only type of landmines available to the UA. There were others, and while not lethal or even damaging to the Purified, they slowed down the advance of the former MLA warriors. 

The second thing they discovered was that Nedzu was a mad genius. He was the one who planned the entire second defensive layer (the first one was more of a welcome party to him, this one was the real deal). And he did that by taking full advantage of his High Spec quirk. 

The pillboxes, bunkers and so on were placed perfectly. With mechanical precision and attention to details that made any deviations from the original plan be counted in millimeters. It was hell. Every open space was a trap, designed so that several defensive positions could fire at the attackers from almost every direction at once. 

And it's not like said defensive positions were easy to take down. Cementoss did his best. It was not a pure concrete - it was reinforced concrete created with some trace additions that only made said concrete tougher and more resistant. Purified and the stronger noumus could bulldoze through them with enough force, and so could the Re-Destro and Geten clones. Nothing else had much luck. 

Several bunkers were carved open, with the attackers trying to pursue the defenders into the labyrinth of the underground corridors dug out with the help of some earth-altering quirks. Fatal mistake. The corridors were a death trap even worse than the surface installations. 

Overhaul was impatient. He knew that he couldn‚Äôt continue this assault forever. Reinforcements were on the way for Nedzu as well, or so he suspected (he was yet to find out about the odd assembly of Paragons and Table members being warped in by Kurogiri to a place a few kilometers behind his command post). Worst of all, he literally couldn‚Äôt lose that battle. 

Losing in Shizuoka right after losing in Nagoya? That would be a mood changer. Force that controlled half of Japan (and not the densely populated one) couldn‚Äôt allow itself to lose two major battles in a row. And by the time the PLF forces broke through the UA Wall, Overhaul lost too many soldiers to be able to pull back and call it a day without having Nedzu and perhaps All Might‚Äôs bloodied corpses to show to the world. 

He still didn‚Äôt show up one the frontline himself. Without that, plan B couldn‚Äôt start. 

 

***

Re-Destro was unimaginably stressed. He saw the MLA warriors - people he knew by name and by quirk, all of them! - were dying left and right. The UA defenses were several orders of magnitude greater than he or Overhaul expected. 

Unfortunately for the defenders of the UA, Re-Destro‚Äôs strength is proportional to how stressed he is. And right now he is very, very stressed. 80% Liberation is a go - he is now a black, hulking juggernaut capable of crushing everything in his wake. He crushes bunkers, annihilates heroes. Nothing can stand against him. 

Rat just tried to corner him with a hero party. Crimson Riot and Fatgum to resist his attacks and draw his attention, with Edgeshot appearing out of nowhere and knocking Re-Destro out with his supermove. Three notable heroes including Edgeshot, Number Four Hero. Re-Destro is flattered. 

Rat didn‚Äôt know that Re-Destro wasn‚Äôt showing up on the frontlines earlier because Overhaul was‚Ä¶ improving him. Crimson Riot is sent flying almost instantly. Fatgum has his fat storage emptied in seconds. Edgeshot moves too slow, and almost dies. The ninja reforms away from him, clutching the broken remnants of his legs. 

Re-Destro lunges towards him. He will end the Number Four Hero right there, before he escapes. He can see the dawning horror in the ninja heroes‚Äô eyes when suddenly something hits him from the side with enough power to throw him back. 

He stands back from the hit. It was strong, but nowhere near strong enough. But his stress? Yes, his stress is growing. 

There is a figure in a hero uniform floating in the air next to Edgeshot. Re-Destro recognizes him immediately.

‚ÄúMy oh my.‚Äù He laughs while now scrawny Fatgum pulls Edgeshot back. Crimson Riot is back there, bleeding profusely but still ready to help carry Number Four Hero to safety. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know that One for All makes people fly, Lemillion.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThere have been‚Ä¶ developments.‚Äù The hero replies scarcely. He doesn‚Äôt even acknowledge the fact that Re-Destro knows about his quirks. Overhaul told them all. ‚ÄúOne for All isn‚Äôt the only power I carry now.‚Äù 

All Might is probably busy tearing through the Purified. Together with Captain Celebrity. That was one terrifying team-up, in Re-Destro opinion. Celebrity with his aerial mobility was pushing them towards All Might. Nedzu was probably telling him where to go exactly to achieve that.

‚ÄúGuess what, Lemillion.‚Äù Re-Destro smiles as his stress level approaches one hundred percent. ‚ÄúI have more than one quirk now as well.‚Äù 

The quirks of his compatriots are in him, now. He powers up Geten‚Äôs quirk and the temperature around him falls down, the ice readying itself for ranged attacks. Curious‚Äô quirk makes his touch make everything explosive (that‚Äôs how he got Edgeshot down), and Trumpet‚Äôs quirk empowers the MLA warriors storming the area during the fight. 

He will take revenge in their stead. He will win for them. 

 

***

The attack gets bogged down after three hours of grinding warfare of attrition. Nedzu‚Äôs ingenious fortification planning and his callousness when it came to ordering half-dead heroes to continue fighting finally succeed in staving off the PLF advance. 

There is only so much that the Trumpet clones can do when it comes to making their fanatic followers continue their attacks over the piles of corpses of their predecessors. They were picked for their charisma and oratory skills, but at this point THEY are the ones who are having enough of it. 

There is also the part when they finally see the school main building. Which also means that Lady Nagant and Gremlin can see them too. Crawler acts as a spotter for them both, the former eliminating officers while the latter opts for Re-Destro and Geten clones. 

The attack slows down and finally halts. Overhaul will have none of it, especially as a special assault party (alongside Sunset) just attacked his Eclipse clone unit that was warping in reinforcements. Lemillion defeating Re-Destro is another unexpected favour, and while the second All Might was too tired and wounded to continue fighting, Overhaul just lost his strongest pawn. 

Celebrity is down for the count, carried behind the frontline looking way worse than he did after that Sky Egg incident. The three colossi of the opposing forces were down to a single one. All Might. If All Might fell‚Ä¶ 

No. 

Overhaul is smarter than this. 

All Might is powerful, but he is growing tired, Overhaul has something like sixty Purified left. He can deal with the Symbol of Peace (he really hoped that he would be in Tokyo, did he fell for Twice‚Äôs clone?) at his leisure. But there is something else he can do right now. 

He grabs some of the warp quirks users he has on standby. He gathers the technopaths. They can‚Äôt exactly take everything down like they did during the Training Camp Battle, but they can make a brief breach. And, besides, they‚Äôve been monitoring the enemy communication long enough to find what he wanted them to. 

Technopaths glitch the UA‚Äôs warp coordinate scramblers momentarily. Overhaul steps out of the warpgate in the middle of Nedzu‚Äôs command post. That infuriating rat is enveloped by his quirk in two seconds. Nedzu and Sir Nighteye (and everyone else in the room) die almost instantly, their bodies disassembled into blood smears on the floor‚Ä¶ 

Blood smear that changes into mud. 

Twice clones. 

Overhaul has a split second to understand that he fell into a trap before Stain, Miruko, Mr. Compress, Eraserhead and Legion (of course he is there) storm the room. Eraserhead switches off Overhaul‚Äôs quirk with his own. Legion stares him down. 

Eraserhead‚Äôs quirk does nothing to Overhaul‚Äôs massively improved body. He is superhumanly fast and strong even without his quirk. There are many quirks (diseases, in his mind) out there and Kai Chisaki knows he needs every asset available to defeat them all. 

His quirk also does nothing to Overhaul‚Äôs quirk. 

Eraserhead never found out that the quirk suppression gas was created on the basis of his quirk. All that Overhaul needed was a blood sample that he stole from a UA-aligned hospital long ago. That and a late-bloomer from the QLF with a quirk allowing them to multiply liquids. All he needed was a single drop of Eri‚Äôs blood this time.

Overhaul had a lot of Eraserhead‚Äôs blood to spare when it came to analyzing quirk. He rendered himself immune to it. But he can‚Äôt say the same about the two Eclipse clones behind him.

He tries to overhaul them through the floor‚Ä¶ but his quirk refuses to work. Legion came well prepared (Rabbit fell asleep elsewhere out of quirk exhaustion). He tries to overhaul the floor itself, impale them all on the spikes, but his quirk once again refuses to work - this time it‚Äôs due to Nedzu having Rock Lock use his Deadbolt technique on the ceiling of the floor beneath them. The ceiling and walls are frozen in place, and will remain like that for the time being. 

Oh well, time to get his hands dirty, Overhaul thinks.

He leaps forward. Everyone but Legion responds in kind. 

 

***

Plan B was born out of desperation. Nedzu, Sir Nighteye and Legion decided that they can‚Äôt hope to win the battle in the conventional way. PLF brought enough firepower to overpower the defenders through sheer exhaustion. Oh, with how Nedzu fortified the school they COULD technically hope for a victory, but only a pyrrhic one. Another Nagoya.

Legion and Sir spend a while plotting on private chat. And came up with plan B. The one and only hope Japan had for a decisive victory during the battle for UA. A victory decisive enough to guarantee the end of the Paranormal Liberation War. 

Nedzu was ecstatic when they filled him in. And just now he switched on his real command post (Twice clones did the job well earlier) and started issuing orders. The soldiers and heroes on the frontline began preparing for the execution of plan B. Reinforcements outside - Paragons and Table heroes-turned-villains began their hurried march towards the backline of the besieging army. 

Then he sends a message to Sir that the time has come. And to Legion because, let‚Äôs be real, Nedzu likes the young supervillain enough to let him gloat a bit when it‚Äôs truly applicable. 

 

***

Even with Legion limiting his quirk somehow, this wasn‚Äôt really a battle. Overhaul was as fast as Miruko, as resistant to impacts as Stain (well, almost). Eraserhead was knocked out of the fight almost instantly. He fell for the Overhaul‚Äôs ploy about his quirk being erased and tried to use the capture scarf, only for Kai Chisaki overhauling it in a way that almost killed the hero. 

Mr. Compress marbled him to save him from bleeding out and threw it back at Legion. Then he did his best to stop Overhaul. It wasn‚Äôt enough - he was quick and a master of feints, but Overhaul had strength to bulldoze through them all.

Stain tasted his blood. The paralysis lasted for a heartbeat before Overhaul changed his blood enough for the quirk to stop working. Did they think that he didn‚Äôt come prepared?

Miruko managed to tear his head off. This stopped him for a few seconds before Hyper-Regeneration kicked in. When his hands were back, he promptly resetted his injuries and slammed the rabbit-woman into the wall. 

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt ending the same way as it did last time, Legion.‚Äù Overhaul says loudly. His revenge is nigh. Legion loves his family members too much. If Stain and Miruko are real, so is he. 

Mr. Compress marbles his arm. He responds by elbowing the master thief back and regrowing the arm. 

‚ÄúIt will end exactly the same way, Overhaul.‚Äù Legion replies calmly. ‚ÄúWith you on your knees before me. Begging me for mercy and cursing me alternatively.‚Äù 

Something is wrong. Overhaul isn‚Äôt sure what it is (and he is a bit busy, Miruko just lept at his back and this occupied him for a few seconds), but something is certainly wrong. 

Stain slaughters the remaining Eclipse clones. But it‚Äôs not this. Overhaul doesn‚Äôt plan to retreat from here. When his main quirk will be back to full capabilities, he will kill them all and then level the building down. 

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Overhaul doesn‚Äôt even have to fight seriously at this point. He is just standing there, three meters in front of Legion, casually dismissing attacks on him. ‚ÄúAre you going to summon your father? Or perhaps it will be All Might this time?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt need them last time.‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúYou were taken down by a thirteen-years old quirkless kid with a stolen quirk-suppression bullet and some uncles doing the diversion.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNewsflash, kid.‚Äù Overhaul answers back with a wide smile. His quirk is coming back, this time he almost managed to disassemble Mr. Compress, the thief‚Äôs hand is certainly gone. He wanted it all, but‚Ä¶‚Äù My quirk is powerful enough to resist such a bullet now. I‚Äôll just reassemble an affected part before the drug spreads.‚Äù 

‚ÄúPerhaps.‚Äù Izuku replies, completely unfazed by his words. ‚ÄúBut how long can you hold your breath?‚Äù

(above the UA two missiles carrying quirk-suppression warheads stolen by the League from the old QLF base explode. Sir Nighteye and Nedzu timed it perfectly. Surviving defenders pulled out gasmasks when Nedzu sent out his announcements. The attackers had no such luck. And neither did Overhaul - the gas was different enough from the original quirk for his immunity treatment to not work on it). 

The answer to Izuku‚Äôs question, as Overhaul soon discovers, is ‚Äònot long enough‚Äô. He also didn‚Äôt see Stain putting up a gasmask behind his back. Without his quirk to alter his blood, he is promptly paralyzed by the Hero Killer because Izuku reenacts the events that occured after their first battle. But this time without his father present. 

Overhaul screams for a long time. But eventually his willpower fades, his mind is torn from his body and reduced to a vestige attached to the quirk. An hour later Izuku Midoriya has the badly wounded Lemillion touch his hand. The dead heroes in his hand shift through memories attached to the quirk and confirm the truth.

Overhaul had no more spares left. Kai Chisaki died for real this time. 

 

***

Purified were strong by the virtue of possessing multiple quirks. But without them, they were de facto quirkless. The detonation of the quirk-suppressing warhead caught them all off-guard. Changing the PLF strongest weapon into‚Ä¶ well, nothing.

Heroes and villains gathered around the UA still had their quirks. They still had All Might, however battered and tired the Symbol of Peace was now. Soldiers were there as well, looking forward to a rematch.

The regular MLA warriors carried no weapons and almost no skills when it came to quirkless warfare. The few QLF regiments that somehow were a part of this task force did their best, but it wasn‚Äôt much. And the less was said about the A-Rank escapees and the Geten/Re-Destro clones the better. 

It wasn‚Äôt even a battle at this point. Especially after Spinner, Vantablack and Vampire slaughtered the now orphaned Overhaul‚Äôs command staff and the odd alliance of Paragons and Table villains under Gang Orca (they were going to go back to trying to kill each other in a few days, no doubts about it) began sweeping through the PLF‚Äôs backline. 

It was a rout. With every passing minute making it look more like a downright massacre. Only those who surrendered were spared. 

 

***

Re-Destro made a crucial miscalculation. He decided to escape the captivity, despite Lemillion arresting him. 

Quirk-suppressing warheads exploded over his head and he lost his quirks. Despite that, he was still a genius with an omnidisciplinary knowledge about‚Ä¶ well, almost everything. Escape artistry was among his abilities. And the people fleeing from the battle were mostly his loyal servants. They did their best when they recognized him.

It took him a lot of effort, but he managed to avoid capture or death. He was travelling northeast, towards Kofu, with some MLA warriors, already busy thinking how to recover from this disaster, when his enemies found him. 

He realised how crucial of a miscalculation his escape was when he heard someone referring to him as ‚ÄòRikiya-san‚Äô through a megaphone. Then came pain and, after way too much time, merciful oblivion. 

With Overhaul and Re-Destro dead, with all major lieutenants of the former MLA dead or imprisoned, with the PLF‚Äôs international backing eliminated and resistance groups on the rise everywhere throughout Hokkaido and northern Japan, the war was essentially over. What was left was cleaning-up.

Day One Hundred Thirty-Seven

Principal: I‚Äôd like to officially announce that Amplivolt, the new Grand Commander of the Meta-Liberation Army, has officially announced its surrender. The Paranormal Liberation War is over. 

SmallMight: They actually elected someone? Weren‚Äôt they pretty much having a small civil war over the seat?

Principal: Apparently most of the candidates decided that it‚Äôs a lost cause since they obviously lost the war. HPSC retook Niigata yesterday, and the MLA casualties together with the plague of desertions has made it shrink to something like 60-70 thousand. 

Principal: QLF has officially split but the MLA has destroyed the majority of it, apparently. 

TinTinCan: They surrendered because now they still have some cards left (like a promise of not destroying northern Japan even more) and can hope to get themselves be treated like a side of a legitimate war instead of a villain insurgency, hmm?

Principal: Yes. They will be treated like a foreign army instead of villains. At least, mostly. 

Principal: I‚Äôll make sure that whoever was connected to war crimes will pay.

SmallMight: ‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt we technically violate international conventions by deploying biological and chemical weaponry? Aren‚Äôt we war criminals?

Principal: Well, we WON the war.

SmallMight: Fine point. 

SpyingEye: Urgh.

SpyingEye: I just realized that I did, technically, use a chemical weapon. After all, it was me who pressed the button to launch the missiles. Which, technically, makes me a war criminal. Then again, it was a non-lethal chemical weapon. 

SmallMight: What about matching T-Shirts? With an inscription like ‚ÄúGeneva Convention is a bitch and I‚Äôm its pimp‚Äù or something like that

SpyingEye: ‚Ä¶

SpyingEye: I‚Äôm going to pretend I didn‚Äôt hear that. 

TinTinCan: these words are spoken on this chat way too often ugh

Principal: I want one! 

AllRight: You are still going to jail after this is over, you remember that, Nedzu? We made a promise about it. 

Principal: Well I might be going to jail but at least I‚Äôll look dashing in that T-Shirt.

TinTinCan: Jail?

AllRight: It‚Äôs complicated.

SmallMight: Ugh. 

SmallMight: Keep him around.

SmallMight: I need someone to play a real world grand strategy game against me

Principal: Oh I assure you that I can do that from the jail, no problems on my side.

SmallMight: also the Hero Commission. 

Principal: Urgh. 

AllRight: Urgh.

FashionStatement: Ur

SmallMight: Shit stop trying to write with your arms in the casts, Jeanist

SmallMight: Let‚Äôs keep the truce for a month or two more, I‚Äôm not sure if the president of the HPSC will actually relinquish the dictatorial rights. And that‚Äôs lowkey worrying me (also I‚Äôm still killing her for Miruko, ngl)

Principal: Tell me if you need help with that!

SpyingEye: urgh.

Three days after the MLA surrendered and the majority of the heroes, soldiers, police and the paragons were busy with the resulting wave of prisoners to deal with, something happened. It occured in a small and otherwise unremarkable district of an equally unremarkable town. 

A white-haired girl with a small horn on her forehead didn‚Äôt return from her school. After ten minutes of growing increasingly worried (and two missed phone calls), the man with a black mist for the head phoned her father. 
Notes:

    Kill me, but despite thinking for a long time, I couldn't imagine more ironic fate for Overhaul (the man that wanted to end quirks and was ready to kill for it) than to die desperately wishing that he still had his quirk.

    Also yes. Japan is officially fucked.

Chapter 61: Return

    All for One returns to the business.

Notes:

(See the end of the chapter for notes.)
Chapter Text

Izuku was still trying to wrap his head around the fact that the war was over. Oh there were still skirmishes with some die-hard MLA fanatics here and there, but that was for the heroes to worry about. Even Captain Celebrity returned back to the United States, with tens of thousands of people popping up to tell him farewell at the airport. Heartwarming, really. 

He has decided to give himself a few well-earned free days. Hell, he gave those to almost everyone. Or at least everyone who wanted to have free days. The League spent two first days after the end of the Paranormal Liberation War partying because honestly at this point there were literally no supervillains in the country that weren‚Äôt acquainted with the League. 75% were actually present at the party. 

That was an achievement. 

Then he got an early warning from Kurogiri (who was mysteriously absent for the past few hours and this was bad because they were too afraid to try to pick up alcohol from his bar without him). And his blood ran cold. 

‚ÄúFUCK!‚Äù Izuku shouted, jumping up from the couch in the living room. Startling the hell out of the people. ‚ÄúMy dad will be here in half a minute, get ready!‚Äù 

Honestly speaking they never planned for this. Izuku didn‚Äôt even want to imagine the outcome of such an event. Midoriya Hisashi showing up at the League‚Äôs headquarters? Himiko and Rabbit knew him and they were obviously the ones freaking out the most after Izuku. 

Miruko knew about All for One, but thought that he was dead. She just froze near the bar, where she was busy inebriating herself with (who would have thought) Stain. Split didn‚Äôt know a thing, and Izuku cursed himself for not mentioning it earlier.

Tenko knew him (but didn‚Äôt see him for years now), but Suto didn‚Äôt. Only half of their joint body being aware of what was happening made the entirety of it very confused. 

Rabbit and Himiko did the smartest thing and jumped behind their respective couches. Mei, as always, was too socially inexperienced to understand what was happening. 

Kurogiri‚Äôs warpgate opened up in the middle of the room. All for One stepped through it. The atmosphere in the room shifted instantly. Midoriya Hisashi was angry. Furious. His face was unmoving and calm, but there was no doubt about the emotions behind it. 

Miruko and Stain froze, their well-honed combat instincts making them instantly understand that they were but a prey facing an apex predator. It was the first time ever that the idea of fighting someone powerful in front of her didn‚Äôt even cross Miruko‚Äôs mind. 

Spinner took an unconscious step back and actually tripped, landing on his butt. Split fainted and would have fallen to the floor if Mindscrew didn‚Äôt catch her. New Mustard did the same together with Toxicity - Juggernaut caught them both. 

Rabbit persevered. Because it was his dad. Asa bonded with him ever since Hisashi started teaching him how to plan things and analyze quirks. And because Rabbit got a lot of confidence during the past few months. Izuku was faintly proud, though he also had something else on his mind. 

Suto hugged Tenko closer, visibly terrified. Tenko responded in kind, but with protectiveness almost oozing from him. 

Sunset froze.

‚ÄúDad?‚Äù Izuku managed to speak. He has never seen his father this angry. This‚Ä¶ hateful. It was All for One from the times before Inko managed to bond with him and make him somewhat normal. Before Eri did her magic. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThe Commission kidnapped Eri.‚Äù Hizashi replied. Calmly. Calmness was only outward. When Izuku‚Äôs mind comprehended the words, he‚Ä¶ was no longer calm either.

‚ÄúParagon program.‚Äù Izuku states. It‚Äôs not even a question, really. 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù All for One replies. ‚ÄúPresident‚Äôs personal army. We gave Eri a simple backstory about being from a modest family when we enrolled her in that school. Perhaps too modest. Modest enough that the Commission decided to steal her for themselves when Mera with his analysis quirk detected that she had a Class-Six quirk. She must have decided to ramp up the program again‚Ä¶ and they run into her.‚Äù For a second his aura ramps up and Izuku is almost certain that Miruko squealed in terror quietly. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where they are holding her and I‚Äôm not in a mood to let them abuse her for even a second longer than necessary. The president will know where she is. And I‚Äôll ask her personally. Before doing something that I should have done long ago - destroying the HPSC. I‚Äôll tell you where she is, and I expect you to save her.‚Äù 

Izuku freezes even more than he already did. His father doesn‚Äôt know...

‚ÄúI know, Izuku.‚Äù All for One interrupts his thoughts. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a mind reading quirk. You healed him during the Training Camp battle, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù Izuku opens his mouth to respond, but no words come through. ‚ÄúDo not try to apologize. You needed him alive for your long-term goals. He is my nemesis, not yours. But this calls for some‚Ä¶ adaptations.‚Äù 

He approaches Izuku. Izuku spent enough years with him to not be afraid of him, somehow. He doesn‚Äôt flinch even when Hisashi Midoriya puts his hand on his head and activates All for One. He makes no resistance. 

The second copy of Overhaul‚Äôs quirk leaves his body together with the immortality quirk he stole from Doctor Garaki. Seconds later quirks began to flood in. Dozens. Hundreds. 

Izuku gasps when his father retracts his hand. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶‚Äù He tries to say, but is interrupted. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to need something to measure up to Lemillion once I finish my personal feud. So after today.‚Äù Hisashi replies calmly. ‚ÄúMost of these quirks I bought or exchanged for others. Hand the others to your followers. I won‚Äôt need them anymore. I‚Äôll give you Mera too, his quirk should be extremely useful to you.‚Äù 

‚ÄúD...dad, I‚Ä¶‚Äù This sounds like‚Ä¶ is his father just telling him in his own way that he isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ that he might not come back?! No, this cannot be, Izuku refuses‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúIzuku.‚Äù Hizashi looks at him with a faint smile. ‚ÄúChildren succeed their parents. That‚Äôs just the way of this world. After today, Eri will be safe and the world will know you as the Symbol of Evil. I might have joined the parenthood club quite late, but I know that this is the way I should act as a father.‚Äù His smile grows just slightly malevolent for a second. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still going to murder All Might, no doubt about it. And, hopefully, I‚Äôll manage to not die while doing so. But other than that‚Ä¶ I hope you will finally be able to say that you are proud of your father.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI was always proud of you.‚Äù Izuku says, barely holding tears. ‚ÄúNot of you as a villain, but‚Ä¶ of you as a father.‚Äù Stating his desire to kill All Might didn‚Äôt help the former at all. But the rest‚Ä¶

For a second, there is a complicated mix of pride, happiness, sadness and pain on Hisashi's face. Then he gently hugs his son, ruffles his hair a bit with a faint smile, and then turns towards his other son.

‚ÄúAsa‚Ä¶‚Äù Rabbit leaps from behind his couch and hugs him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that I can‚Äôt be with you for longer. I‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt find out about you earlier. You didn‚Äôt deserve what was happening to you for so many years. I should have been there to stop it.‚Äù Rabbit would have answered, but he is crying too hard for it to happen. 

Izuku and Asa cry together when Hisashi tells them to save Eri, look over mom in his stead and be there for Aiko. Then Kurogiri warps him out. 

 

***

The first thing Hisashi Midoriya does after warping in front of the HPSC headquarters is to find one of the TV cars that are squatting there constantly and have a short exchange of words with the TV crew about the way their equipment works. Then (with a camera he borrowed from them floating in the air behind him) he announces his return to villainy by killing 15 674 people with a single touch. 

His brother wasn‚Äôt the only person ever born with quirk-altering quirks. Hisashi spent more than two centuries finding people lacking the biological sign of quirklessness yet also not having any detectable quirks. Many were misses, their quirks having just awfully hard-to-achieve activation conditions. But many were hits. 

All Might defeated him because he was an avid collector. He enjoyed collecting quirks, but‚Ä¶ changing them, altering them permanently‚Ä¶ It felt like painting over a rare art piece you just bought. It was wrong. So he never tinkered with his quirks despite having quirk-altering quirks allowing him to alter their expression mechanisms, activation methods, make them stronger, more cost-efficient or even one-up their quirk classs. 

He handed most of those quirks to Izuku. He knew his son. He was going to make so many horrifyingly wonderful things with them. He will be a Symbol of Evil even better than his father (even if his definition of evil is lacking malevolence in All for One‚Äôs opinion).  

The rest he invested into the Overhaul‚Äôs quirk‚Ä¶ and a select few combat quirks he left for himself.. Making them stronger, expanding their range of influence and making the control (especially in the case of Overhaul) infinitely more detailed. Then he touched the front wall of the HPSC building. 

Within seconds it warps. Thousands of people working throughout this edifice of bureaucratic corruption die as the walls close on them, crushing them into pulp. Others die merged with the walls or impaled on the spikes (All for One controls every detail of the transformation and he is an avid - and livid - sadist). Those unlucky survive for a while, entombed in small pockets of open space surrounded by solid material, dying only when the air runs out. Alone, in darkness, and no hope of rescue coming. 

Then he uses Air Walk quirk to move up. He has prepared a perfect stage and he is the second last of the actors to arrive. With his camera on, and the TV stations just figuring out what sort of material it was bringing them, everyone will see what happens next.

 

***

 

President of the HPSC was in the middle of the meeting with the highest ranked Paragons, Mera and some of her closest advisors when the world stopped making sense. The floor shook under her feet, the ceiling vanished. The furniture was still there, but the walls and ceiling were just‚Ä¶ gone. 

‚ÄúWhat the‚Ä¶‚Äù Invincible, the Rank One Paragon shouts while jumping up from his seat. She is just slightly less startled when she hears a voice. 

‚ÄúI hope I‚Äôm not interrupting anything important.‚Äù She knows this voice. She heard it years ago. She heard it in her nightmares many, many times. Her head turns towards it‚Ä¶ and she gasps in horror.

All for One. The long dead boogeyman is floating there menacingly. Unfazed by the Paragons surrounding her, despite their power being enough to measure up to the majority of the old Top Ten Hero ranking. 

How? HOW?!

‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù Invincible asks, his eyes not budging from the figure for even a second. He is the Number One Paragon, Endeavor‚Äôs equal but with a quirk similar to the one Captain Celebrity has. He is trained enough to feel his instincts scream at him to run. 

‚ÄúA lot of people in Japan ask themselves the same question right now.‚Äù All for One replies with a tone almost casual. Only one does the president notice the camera floating next to him. He moves her away from himself, just enough for it to catch everything at once. Both himself and the president and her group. ‚ÄúSo let‚Äôs answer it first before I start killing you, alright?‚Äù 

‚ÄúStop!‚Äù President shouts. Not to the All for One but to the Paragons. Some of them looked as if they were about to attack him after the last sentence. They stop obediently. She knows that they would be slaughtered, but she also knows that every single second of All for One‚Äôs villainous monologue heightens the chance of some additional help appearing.

All Might. How far is he from her right now? He is extremely fast when he really wants it, but it‚Äôs probably dozens of kilometers, she can‚Äôt hope for him to‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Hisashi Shigaraki.‚Äù All for One announces. ‚ÄúKnown also as Hisashi Midoriya, the Quirk Thief‚Ä¶ or the Symbol of Evil. I was born with a quirk known as All for One, a Class-Six quirk allowing me to take the quirks of others and make them my own‚Ä¶ or to grant them to others.‚Äù President gags - is he announcing that to the entire world?! Why?! ‚ÄúI‚Äôm two hundred thirty seven years old, and have spent the majority of my life being the secret emperor of Japan and the majority of Asia. I overthrew and installed governments at my leisure. I collected hundreds of quirks. Where others saw hero rankings I saw the menu of an exquisite restaurant. I‚Äôm the world‚Äôs sole SSSS-Rank villain, unranked officially because the Japanese government was too afraid of me to admit that I exist. Am I telling the truth, miss president?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù She is too terrified to think of lying to him. ‚ÄúAll Might. All Might defeated you!‚Äù She shouts. 

(millions of people throughout Japan stare at the TVs in shock, her admittance just... )

‚ÄúIndeed.‚Äù Hisashi smiles. ‚ÄúI had him on his knees before me. I tore his stomach and one of his lungs out. Unfortunately, I gloated just a bit too much and he got a single good hit in. I ended up looking worse than him for a while, but as you can see, I fully recovered. He didn‚Äôt. And besides him, there is no one that can stop me. Did you know that we share a history together?‚Äù 

His tone is‚Ä¶ conversational. The single question of ‚Äòwhy‚Äô is filling her head. WHY WHY WHY WHY over and over again. Why is he here? Why didn‚Äôt he die? Why is he announcing all of that? 

‚ÄúI had a brother, once.‚Äù All for One says. ‚ÄúWhere I had power, he had weakness. Where I had malevolence, he had kindness. He was quirkless, or so people thought. I gave him a power stockpiling quirk only to discover that he had a useless quirk that allowed him to transfer itself to others. They merged, creating One for All. A quirk steadily growing in power over the ages, transferred down the line of heroes and vigilantes raising against me to be slaughtered and tortured to death, but not before transfering the quirk to another wannabe saviour. I should be honoured, really. I‚Äôm powerful enough to have a Class-Six Quirk out there dedicated solely to my destruction. Like a demon lord from manga, with a holy sword out there that‚Äôs the only weapon that can slay them. All Might is the Twenty Seventh Holder of this power.‚Äù Another of those terrifyingly normal smiles. ‚ÄúHe was a quirkless kid who wanted to make the world a better place by becoming a hero before receiving it, can you believe it?‚Äù 

She never heard about it. No one ever heard. Nedzu. Nedzu kept it all under wraps. That damn rat, how could he‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI decided to retire after that fight, you know.‚Äù All for One says words. Her brain can barely comprehend them. ‚ÄúI had a family to look after. I decided to give up my mantle of the Symbol of Evil to my firstborn son and a chosen successor. The second holder of my quirk. He is much too‚Ä¶ kind, if I were to be honest, but his smarts‚Ä¶ He isn‚Äôt even eighteen years old, but Legion is already the ruler of all villains in Japan after he reigned in my rebellious lieutenants. Like Beast, Purity, Re-Destro or Eclipse.  I‚Äôm proud of him, you know. He and Lemillion, the 28th Holder of the One for All and the next Symbol of Peace will make for a wonderful pair of archenemies.‚Äù 

‚ÄúW...wait.‚Äù Too much information. Lemillion has All Might‚Äôs quirk? Legion is All for One‚Äôs SON?! He, of course, doesn‚Äôt wait for her. 

‚ÄúI planned to remain on the sidelines.‚Äù All for One continues. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd probably visit All Might in the hospital before his death. I can see this scene. Him, dying content, thinking that he stopped me and avenged his mentor and predecessor that I murdered slowly and painfully and can now die in peace‚Ä¶ only to see me in his room. In full strength. Oh, what a face he would do? I‚Äôd probably bring a camera to record his calm and content face twisting into an expression of emotional and mental anguish. Something to watch for amusement when I'm bored.‚Äù The sheer amount of malevolence oozing from his every word makes some of the Paragons around her take a step back in horror. ‚ÄúBut then you managed to do the one thing that could make me unretire myself.‚Äù All for One‚Äôs calm and smiling face steels up suddenly. ‚ÄúYour little sidekick Mera kidnapped my daughter from her school in order to forcefully recruit her into the Paragon program. And I didn‚Äôt like that one bit.‚Äù 

What? Mera did WHAT?! The man in question froze completely, staring at All for One with terror on his face. 

‚ÄúOh please, don‚Äôt try to pretend.‚Äù All for One says towards the president. ‚ÄúWe both know that the best way to create eternally obedient and powerful pawns is to groom them from childhood. If anything, I must congratulate you! Paragons are a very well thought program. You are truly a wonderful villain, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù He smiles wryly. ‚ÄúMera has a quirk that lets him find out a general type of quirk and its class merely by seeing a person from a distance. He is visiting schools out there for you, finding bearers of quirks from Class Three up and then recruiting them. Some you buy from their parents, some you get by threatening said parents and some like my beloved girl, you simply kidnap. Especially when their parents aren‚Äôt well off. Then you just pressure the local police to drop the investigation and voila! Really ingenious scheme. But you kidnapped my daughter whom I enrolled under a false name and backstory. I‚Äôm here to take her back.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about!‚Äù President won‚Äôt admit that this is how the Paragon program works. Not in front of cameras. He can kill her, he probably will, but this will destroy her empire. And then he will still probably kill her. 

‚ÄúStill in denial?‚Äù All for One‚Äôs head tilts a bit, he looks like he is genuinely surprised by her words. ‚ÄúI think you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen right now. This isn‚Äôt about you giving her back to me to save your life. I already killed more than fifteen thousand people present in your headquarters‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs just a beginning, my dear.‚Äù He smiles. Once again, he smiles. But this time the smile almost stops her heart. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to wipe out your Paragons and steal some of their delicious quirks. Then I‚Äôm going to warp Mera elsewhere to slowly and viciously torture him to death later on. When we‚Äôll be finally alone, I‚Äôm going to inflict the most gruesome of fates I can think of on you, my dear president. I‚Äôm going to drain all of the Commission‚Äôs dirty secrets from your brain and upload them into the internet, just to thoroughly ruin every politician and journalist who helped you build your little empire of crime. Then I‚Äôll give you an immortality quirk while also subtly altering your nervous system to inflict a locked-in-syndrome on you. I‚Äôll make sure that you are going to spend at least one hundred years as a prisoner of your own body, only able to move your eyelids, with just enough time to contemplate what you did to my daughter. Then I‚Äôm going to use the knowledge I got from your head to find and save her. After that‚Äôs done, I‚Äôm also going to personally kill every single Commission-aligned hero together with their entire agencies. I‚Äôm going to publish the personal data about every single non-hero worker of the HPSC and their families on the internet and start a manhunt. I‚Äôll pay whoever kills them a lot of money‚Ä¶ even more if they die painfully, and I‚Äôll throw in an even greater bonus if their families are killed in front of their eyes in the most painful and degrading way possible. This‚Ä¶‚Äù He adds, suddenly calmer. It is a silence before the storm. And she knows it. ‚Äú... is how much you managed to anger me. And now that you know what I‚Äôm going to do‚Ä¶ I shall start doing it.‚Äù 

Her Paragons do their best. But this isn‚Äôt a fight. This is a harvest. 

 

***

‚ÄúZ‚Ä¶ Zuku.‚Äù Himiko is watching the TV broadcast with a look of terror on her face, her hand grasping on Izuku‚Äôs. Other League members have similar expressions. Even Miruko and Stain are taken aback. Compress just warped back, probably just in case he was on All for One‚Äôs kill list - he knows that Izuku might just be the only person who can save him if he is. He says nothing. He just stares at the TV.

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù Izuku replies. ‚ÄúAll for One is back in business. This‚Ä¶ this is what I tried to avoid the whole time.‚Äù He wants to cry. Asa is still hugging him while sobbing. They weren‚Äôt together for a long time, but he still grew to love his biological father. But Izuku can‚Äôt cry. Not now. Eri still needs him. ‚ÄúI hoped he would remain my father. That I would keep seeing my mom beating him with a rolled newspaper when he does something wrong. That I would keep seeing him acting like the world‚Äôs most doting father around Eri. But instead I‚Äôm going to see him return to business. To see him die to save her.‚Äù All Might will get there. Lemillion too, probably. And heroes. So many heroes. 

All for One isn‚Äôt fighting to win. He learned from his son how to make a public appearance as a villain‚Ä¶ and used this knowledge to stage his own death. To save Eri. And to crown his son as a new Symbol of Evil. While also crowning Lemillion as his archnemesis. 

He should watch his last fight, if only because his dad is fighting for him. 

Maybe, just maybe All for One will win and escape. Or maybe he will only be detained. This is still an option, right? Right?

After less than five minutes of struggle (could be done faster, but his drama queen of a father wanted to make his kills look like an art, and of course he complimented and analyzed the quirks in front of him before slaughtering their users) Invincible, the last of the Paragons, dies. All for One tears out his quirk and then throws him off the building, the man probably plastered over the pavement below. 

Then his father warps Mera to the League‚Äôs hideout - and Izuku steals his quirk before disassembling him. And then his father corners the president and does as he promised. He puts his hand on her head and through a combination of a mindreading and internet-uploading quirk publicizes every single act of political murder, corruption and every other imagineable crime that president commited or helped hide to the world. With evidence to back it up.

He also sends the message to his son. Coordinates of the base where Mera sent Eri. Because of course he told her about finding a Class Six quirk. That‚Äôs what the whole now-interrupted meeting was about. 

The League marches to war. 

 

***

Eri Midoriya might have been kidnapped, yes. And she generally has a bad memory associated with unfamiliar adults manhandling her and putting her somewhere where sunlight doesn‚Äôt reach her. In fact, ‚Äòbad memory‚Äô doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe it. But she isn‚Äôt the same girl as she was back then. 

Overhaul is no longer here. Izu-nichan and papa confirmed it without a shadow of doubt, and she trusts them. And with Overhaul gone, there is literally no one in the world that Eri is afraid of. 

Even the meanest of people pale in front of that man. And she knows (she is young, but she isn‚Äôt dumb and she went through a lot of things that made her understand things normally alien to people her age) that her brother and dad and perhaps uncle Kurogiri were involved in his demise. 

Oh and uncle Stain, but she didn‚Äôt get to see him recently. She misses him. He looks scary but not the Overhaul‚Äôs type of scary. He even bought her a candied apple (her first one! she loves them ever since) when they were waiting for Izu-nichan back then. She still didn‚Äôt figure out why he told her not to tell anyone.

So she knows that her brother or her dad will save her. Because they love her. And because whoever kidnapped her is certainly less of a threat than Overhaul was. Because everyone is less of a threat than that man. 

Despite being kidnapped and shoved into a cell, she refuses to mope around. She is one day going to be a hero. She is going to save people with her quirk AND with her smile. Izu-nichan told her in detail how All Might wears his signature smile to make people not feel afraid regardless of whatever is happening. So she smiles too. It makes a lot of people smile back and that makes her feel just a bit like a hero.

There are some children like her in the cell. She directs her smile at them. She does her best to make them be less afraid. They don‚Äôt believe her when she says that Izu-nichan will come save them all. But after a few hours of working on it, they start being influenced by her. It‚Äôs hard work, really. But she does her best. One or two kids seem angry at her, for some reason, but she doesn‚Äôt care. Others, especially those more timid and scared, seem reassured by her, and that‚Äôs the most important. 

Then the building shakes. She hears screams. Another thing he is acutely familiar with, but the other kids in the cell aren‚Äôt so she tells them to not worry, because it‚Äôs probably Izu-nichan. She heard explosions and screams the last time he saved her too (some of the kids appear slightly weirded out by those words, but once again, she doesn‚Äôt care). 

The wall of the cells is disassembled suddenly. She was terrified of this quirk when Overhaul was using it, but she isn‚Äôt - and could never be - terrified of it when it‚Äôs her brother who is using it. And that‚Äôs him. He is wearing his All Might hoodie and there is Uncle Kurogiri behind him and‚Ä¶ is that Uncle Stain?! 

She leaps at her brother, who hugs her back and tells her that she was brave and he is very proud of her. She is happy. 

Then he tells Uncle Kurogiri to warp the other kids to Musutafu Police Department, and hugs her again. But something is wrong. Why is Izu-nichan looking like he is on the verge of crying?

All for One succeeded in draining the HPSC president of all her dirty little secrets. He was about to slip-in his second immortality quirk (discovery that she was quirkless actually startled him for a second considering how many discriminatory laws against quirkless she tried to issue, then again she probably hated them even more because she was one of them, some people are like that) into her broken and sobbing mess of a form when he arrived.

All Might. Ugh. All for One understands that he failed his son when he somehow let Yagi Toshinori become his moral (more or less) role model. What exactly did the job? He suspects that Inko with her love and kindness made Izuku too empathetic, so that when he started to figure out what his dad‚Äôs business is all about, he just‚Ä¶ jerked away from that. Into someone whom he saw as a good person, and also someone whom everyone in his school idolized. 

How damn confusing. Then again, he was All for One‚Äôs first actual child. A few mistakes can be excused, yes? He would have done way better with Asa and Aiko. Not with Eri. He wasn‚Äôt going to try to make Eri into a villain because she is clearly not a villain material. 

Even now, he is still thinking about them and Inko, isn‚Äôt he? Family really softened him up. But even if offered an alternative, he would have never given the last few years up. Although he did enjoy the brief occasion to stretch his legs a little and act like during his good old days. 

‚ÄúAll Might.‚Äù All or One sighs. ‚ÄúBack to full strength, talk about unexpected things happening.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll for One.‚Äù All Might is livid. There is no smile on his face, merely the face of a man powered by fury and being out for blood. ‚ÄúI hoped that I wouldn‚Äôt have to see you ever again.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I hoped to be able to visit UA as a father of my beloved daughter to join a parent/teacher conference under a camouflage quirk, just to laugh about you and the rest of Nedzu‚Äôs clowns not recognizing me. Before doing the hospital bed routine I mentioned earlier just to see you die in the greatest pain I could possibly inflict on you.‚Äù All for One is just slightly salty about all those little things he was going to miss. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not exactly happy about the way this turned out either.‚Äù 

He gets the message. Izuku got Eri out. His little girl is safe. His son and heir got his public coronation. Now he has just the one last thing to do - this time for himself. He is going to see All Might‚Äôs broken body in front of him, see his chest stop moving and that damn face freezing on him. Even if he is going to perish out of injuries soon after.

He gave up most of his quirks. But this time? Yeah, this time he isn‚Äôt going to gloat until he confirms that the clown is dead. He will gloat to whatever heroes come after him when that happens. He learned the lesson. 

He calls up his quirks. Yagi leaps forward. The impact of their fists meeting shatters the camera and throws the HPSC president of the ledge, into the abyss below. 

It is going to be a long battle, but one thing is certain - All for One is going to enjoy every second of it.
Notes:

    Not going to lie, a platform high in the air that's basically a warped and twisted skyscraper that used to be the headquarters of the HPSC, full of dying people and corpses (some of them probably impaled on spikes extending from the outside wall, displayed before the world), is a battle arena truly worth of the drama queen/demon lord that we all know that All For One is.

    Also can you imagine the irony? All for One is battling out All Might because he was trying to save an innocent kidnapped girl and was ready to risk his life for that goal? This is actually a twist that neither Yagi Toshinori nor the past Holders living in One for All certainly couldn't even imagine.

    The next chapter will show us the resolution of the fight, its aftermath... and will contain a slightly distant epilogue for the story. For now let's rejoice that Eri is safe and the witch is dead.

Chapter 62: Epilogue
Summary:

    Everything comes to an end. Sometimes bad, sometimes good. Sometimes even fanfics can end well (which means being written until last chapter rather than abandoned). Cure to Evil's time, it seems, have come to such an end.

    f___ing finally, ngl

Chapter Text

Lemillion finds the rooftop in question quite easily. He can fly now, and while he didn‚Äôt master the quirk (not yet), he is quite confident about using it. Confident enough to fly over the city and approach the location without anyone seeing him. 

He expects some bodyguards, but Legion is alone. Then again, it‚Äôs probably one of Twice clones. Or perhaps not, at least not today? Mirio Togata isn‚Äôt going to pretend that reading what‚Äôs happening in Legion‚Äôs mind is easy.

Sir Nighteye tried. Nedzu tried. Lemillion tried. They are still far from getting full read on him, and he is willing to admit that much. 

Legion is sitting on the rooftop‚Äôs edge, looking down. Honestly speaking, he‚Äôs looking like he is considering the jump. Probably at the end of the meeting he will do it, at least if he is a Twice clone. 

Lemillion sits right next to him. Then they just sit there for something like a minute. In complete silence. Mirio doesn‚Äôt feel like talking first. It‚Äôs an awkward moment for them both. Not to mention a painful one. 

‚ÄúNot going to try to arrest me?‚Äù Legion asks finally. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have enough time to be each other‚Äôs nemesis. From tomorrow until either of us dies or you are incarcerated.‚Äù Mirio sighs. ‚ÄúToday I‚Äôm here as a friend. Just don‚Äôt try to commit any crime in front of me, please.‚Äù 

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù Legion looks down. Both literally and figuratively. 

The awkward silence is there again. How are they supposed to approach the subject of what happened? 

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your family doing?‚Äù Mirio decides to try that route. 

‚ÄúThey are crying.‚Äù Izuku smiles faintly. ‚ÄúInko taught us well. Almost too well. Asa and Eri pretty much cried themselves into sleep. I have no idea how to explain what happened to her. Mom is with Mr. Compress and Kurogiri. Crying too. Compress is probably trying to cheer her up while Kurogiri is warping in additional tissue boxes and providing drinks to replenish the lost liquids. I‚Äôm holding quite well. I‚Äôm the Symbol of Evil now, I really think that I shouldn‚Äôt cry‚Ä¶‚Äù 

It‚Äôs a sad spectacle. Really sad. Sad enough that Lemillion has enough of it. He grabs Legion‚Äôs arm and pulls him into a hug. Izuku hugs back and the dam breaks. He cries. A lot. He calms down eventually, but only a bit. 

‚ÄúS..sorry.‚Äù Izuku pulls back. Tears are still welling in his eyes, but the dam is back on. ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have‚Ä¶ damn it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou needed it, so you did it.‚Äù Lemillion shrugs. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not you, so I didn‚Äôt record it to humiliate my opponent publicly or anything like that.‚Äù Somehow Legion chuckles a bit. ‚ÄúBesides, you just lost your father. It‚Äôs alright to cry over that.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you just lose your mentor and predecessor?‚Äù Izuku retorts back. Yeah, that battle was a mutual kill. All for One realized his dream of standing over his fallen nemesis, only to fall to the ground soon after and perish, the wounds and quirks exhaustion overwhelming his regeneration quirks together with the hero reinforcements. ‚ÄúOh, wait. One for All.‚Äù Lemillion nods. 

‚ÄúIt takes a few days for a perished Holder to pop back to One for All.‚Äù Lemillion replies. ‚ÄúYoichi told me that. So in a few days I‚Äôll be able to talk with All Might again. At least after Nana stops shouting at him for some party in the United States and after he stops shouting at me for not telling him that All for One is still alive.‚Äù He pauses for a second. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have that much luck.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThey will also all shout at you that I have way more quirks now.‚Äù Legion ads. He is trying to smile wryly while doing so, but the key word is ‚Äòtrying‚Äô. ‚ÄúDad gave me most of his before the battle.‚Äù 

Lemillion freezes for a second. His mind shifts through what he just learned. He isn‚Äôt the only one - the heroes in his head are arguing ever since he hugged Legion. 

‚ÄúHe expected to die.‚Äù Lemillion finally concludes. ‚ÄúWait, he knew that All Might was back to full strength?!‚Äù 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking about All for One himself, Mirio.‚Äù Legion rolls his eyes at his words. ‚ÄúOf course he knew. Despite the League and UA doing their best to hide it. He just popped up in the League headquarters, gave me most of his quirks, took the second copy of Overhaul‚Äôs quirk, told me that it‚Äôs a father‚Äôs thing to sacrifice themselves for their children‚Ä¶ and left. To save Eri and to crown me before the world.‚Äù He sighs. ‚ÄúI still think that he hoped that he would manage to return to us, though.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo All for One‚Äôs last act in life was to save the country from dictatorship and unearth decades worth of corruption‚Ä¶ all to save his daughter and help his son.‚Äù Lemillion summarizes with a sigh. There‚Äôs probably a riot in his head. He doesn‚Äôt even want to imagine Yoichi's reaction to it. ‚ÄúFamily as a cure to evil? Is it that simple?‚Äù 

‚ÄúIf by family you understand people who stick to you and do their best, regardless of what happens, to help you‚Ä¶ then yes?‚Äù Legion replies. ‚ÄúNot a panacea, mind you. Even dad was‚Ä¶ just slightly less evil at the end, not good by any stretch. But getting support and being accepted is probably very, very important.‚Äù

Then he starts crying again. This is going to be a longer evening.

YEARS LATER

[and actually not in a chronological order]

The plan was perfect. Someone managed to locate the Villain Industries new headquarters. Some shell company or something, with a luxurious penthouse at the top of it supposedly housing Gremlin herself. 

Who exactly decided that Dynamight is a good hero to make that arrest was probably an idiot, though. Not as much of an idiot as Dynamight himself was when he referred to his mother as Old Hag in Uraraka‚Äôs presence (THAT DAMN WOMAN ALMOST BROKE HIS WRIST DAMMIT but honestly he likes how intimidating she can be, someone to actually have a rivalry with without being an ass like the living thermostat), but close. 

Sure, he was a Rank Three Hero at this point (FUCK YOU ICY-HOT AND FUCK YOU MINI-ALLMIGHT) but he wasn‚Äôt exactly a low-profile hero. But Mini-AllMight was fighting some destructive gigantified villain elsewhere, and Icy-Hot was‚Ä¶ honestly, Bakugou has no idea where he was and he doesn‚Äôt care. 

He is still salty over that school festival. Sue him for that. He doesn‚Äôt give a shit. 

With some remote detection-suppression quirk he manages to sneak his way through the building and is almost at the penthouse. Doors are slightly ajar and he can see Gremlin in‚Ä¶ wait, is that an All Might pajama? 

Whatever fucking dammit. 

He leaps through the door. She yells, startled, but he manages to immobilize her on the floor in like three seconds, lessons with Uraraka (it‚Äôs certainly not her finding worrying amounts of enjoyment in beating him up, it‚Äôs TRAINING) didn‚Äôt go to waste and‚Ä¶

It is at this moment that Bakugou notices that they aren‚Äôt alone in the room. He sees the majority of the active League members in the room, having some sort of fucked up sleepover. All Might or Lemillion pajamas everywhere. There is a large TV screen showing Lemillion battling the villain as seen from a helicopter. 

Vampire and Spinner are actually holding a banner with some LEMILLION #1 written over it. While staring at Bakugou with an obvious shock. 

There is also Deku. Because of course there is Deku. Right in front of Bakugou, in fact. Because of fucking course he is right in front of Bakugou. 

‚ÄúNo one is ever going to believe you, Kacchan.‚Äù He says slowly, and with a worryingly delighted smile. Then he punts Bakugou through the window.

The screams and sounds of struggle coming from the warehouse reach a deafening crescendo. Kyoka Jirou (Rank 56 Hero according to the last ranking update, she is satisfied with this) stops listening. 

It‚Äôs way too painful to listen to.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening, Earphone Jack?‚Äù One of the policemen asks. They were supposed to raid the warehouse (which was a base of some anti-complex mutant group, one of those who popped up in the wake of CRC‚Äôs tragic - well not really tragic - demise). But someone arrived before them.

She quickly scans the available heroes and policemen. Nope. Just no way. 

‚ÄúMurder Rabbits.‚Äù She deadpans. ‚ÄúAll three.‚Äù Policeman goes pale and phones someone much higher in the hero ranking. 

Thankfully they have the Symbol of Peace nearby and Earphone Jack can just go home and not get traumatized enough to jump out of the window in horror when Koji brings his pet bunny to their class reunion. Like Mineta did last year.

TinTinCan: I need Kurogiri on those coordinates, preferably right now.

SmallMight: ??? What happened?

TinTinCan: Certain triplets in need of a pick-up. 

SmalMight: SHIT

SmallMight: Miruko gave them a house arrest but they escaped.

SmallMight: 90% sure that Asa let them out because he thinks they are adorable.

SmallMight: They bonded way too much after he stole a truck full of organic carrots for their last birthday

SmallMight: Papagiri en route, what the hell did they do this time?

TinTinCan: Attacked some anti-complex mutant group base. 

SmallMight: ‚Ä¶ how many victims?

TinTinCan: Twenty thugs, three B-Rankers and two A-Rankers. 

SmallMight: Wow. Seriously, wow. 

TinTinCan: But they accused each other of stealing kills and ended up coming to blows. They were already unconscious when I arrived.

SmallMight: Oh great. I think I remember their parents pulling something similar in front of some ISP base during the war. Uncle Stain was a sore ass about it for days because he had less kills in the end. 

TinTinCan: khe khe

SmallMight: Alright, alright, ugh

SmallMight: So how much is this going to cost me?

TinTinCan: Standard rate for captured League members. 

TinTinCan: Sir Nighteye says that he is VERY interested about that human trafficking circle in Hiroshima. 

SmallMight: Oh yeah sure take them out, those asshats are creepy. I‚Äôll send you the address tomorrow, just you know, gather the evidence first so that nobody knows it‚Äôs me.

TinTinCan. Right.

TinTinCan: Izuku.

SmallMight: Yes?

TinTinCan: Could you organize some anger management classes for the rabbits?

SmallMight: Why?

TinTinCan: BECAUSE THEY ARE THIRTEEN YEARS OLD AND I DON‚ÄôT WANT THEM TO BE LIKE THAT WHEN THEY ARE ADULTS

SmallMight: Did I mention that Miruko is pregnant again?

TinTinCan: NO

Stain, despite being a crucial part of the League of Villains, had some mixed feelings about it. Oh, he still endorsed whatever Legion did - Izuku had convictions and ironclad will. It‚Äôs just that‚Ä¶ he wasn‚Äôt sure if he liked the result. 

The world grew atrociously peaceful. Most of the villain versus hero battles were to a various degree staged (although the public didn‚Äôt know). It was the price that the heir of All Might decided to pay for the country not being at risk of descending into the same hell-on-earth status that it had a few years ago. 

Of course, both sides believed in their ideologies. That was a plus. League of Villains didn‚Äôt tolerate punch-clock villains in their midst - they all believed in their own visions of the world, just agreed to only pursue them in certain ways. There were many true heroes out there, worthy successors of All Might, to fight them. 

It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ it didn‚Äôt feel right when no one was really putting their life on the line. Well, except for some fights. When some foreign villains rolled in or some previously League-aligned group took its self-imposed limitations as a sign of weakness. But‚Ä¶ that wasn‚Äôt very common at this point. 

Then again, Stain has also realized how soft he got in the meantime. Oh, he was still deadly, that much didn‚Äôt change. It‚Äôs just that nowadays he was mostly busy teaching the new generation of villains how to fight properly. He still killed a hero or two occasionally (if they acted REALLY bad), just‚Ä¶ his recent average was this happening once a year.

Rather pathetic. Although how much of that was due to bad heroes being very rare?

He was thinking this over while picking up the diapers in the supermarket (Miruko kept sending him to buy stuff like that as punishment when he lost a spar, and unfortunately, he lost the last one). He was interrupted when he heard some loud noises coming from the direction of the counter. 

He decided to investigate. He realized that it was something interesting when he saw that there was a hero talking to the guy behind the counter. And, considering the look on the cashier‚Äôs face, it wasn‚Äôt anything nice.

Stain spent half a minute listening to the talk. Then he realized what it was about. 

Hero wanted some FREE STUFF. Because he was a HERO. And when the cashier tried to say no (completely reasonable), the hero started to make thinly veiled threats of the shop getting into ‚Äòproblems‚Äô. 

Oh, no. That will not stand.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd leave the shop if I were you.‚Äù Stain says, and the hero turns his head towards him. 

‚ÄúOh? And why is that?‚Äù Hero fails to perceive him as a threat. C‚Äômon, the All Might merchandise that he is wearing does make him look tame (especially the colourful and honestly rather horrible glasses), but he should have enough situational awareness to see the amount of muscles under the shirt, right?

Stain doesn‚Äôt answer. Instead he takes off the fake nose (it‚Äôs quite shocking how well it hides who he is). After maybe five seconds, the hero goes white. 

‚ÄúS‚Ä¶sstain.‚Äù He says, taking a step back. He ends up hitting the counter. 

‚ÄúI have a one warning policy nowadays.‚Äù Stain announces. ‚ÄúThis is your warning. You are a hero. Act like one. Apologize to the cashier and fuck off.‚Äù He lets out some of his Malicious Intent. He isn‚Äôt sure from this range, but he thinks that the hero actually wet himself. ‚ÄúAnd just so we are clear, you are going to be under observation. Until your death. With all the League‚Äôs resources. Either retire now, or be the best hero you can possibly be. Or I WILL find you. And gut you like a pig.‚Äù 

As the hero hurriedly apologizes to the cashier (and Stain plans how to leave the area before the hero reinforcements arrive, but not before paying for the diapers, Miruko would have murdered him for stealing from a shop), the Hero Killer realizes that he is still needed. Maybe for a few more years? Then he‚Äôll focus on teaching the next generation (especially his own part of it) how to fight properly. 

He still is rather conflicted about the way the world works nowadays. But he is going to leave dealing with it to his children. If they want to change it, the will have to achieve it by their own hand. Like their parents did.

SmallMight: You have been cordially invited to the celebration.

SmallMight: In the League‚Äôs headquarters.

SmallMight: Tomorrow evening.

TinTinCan: this isn‚Äôt the anniversary of Overhaul finally kicking the bucket, so‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs happening? 

SmallMight: I‚Äôm technically inviting Nana, you‚Äôre an‚Ä¶ accompanying person.

TinTinCan: ‚Ä¶ Tenko? 

SmallMight: Another Shimura in the family.

TinTinCan: Jesus Christ

TinTinCan: Tell him what contraceptives are, he gets Suto pregnant almost every year

SmallMight: okay, first of all, this is his fifth child thus far

SmallMight: stop exaggerating

TinTinCan: -_- 

SmallMight: Second of all, did you get to see the look on his face when he sees Suto and four (well, five now) little Sutos in the room with him?

SmallMight: You have never seen a man this happy in your life, I guarantee you

TinTinCan: ugh

SmallMight: also his oldest son loves All Might‚Äôs cartoons and MIGHT be sleeping in All Might‚Äôs onesies so‚Ä¶ I think the next generation of Shimuras is going to be on your side (we all know that the former one is retired now), although they MIGHT be kinda ‚Ä¶ wolfy. 

TinTinCan: I changed my mind

TinTinCan: MORE CHILDREN

SmallMight: ‚Ä¶

Eraserhead is sitting in the UA‚Äô principal office, alone. It‚Äôs his office now, although he still has no idea how that happened. Literally. He woke up in this office with all the paperwork done the day Nedzu vanished. With no idea where he was during the last two hours. 

Nedzu left a letter stating that he could technically keep doing his rat things from jail but it‚Äôd be boring now that the HPSC president is dead, so he is going to disappear before Sir Nighteye acts on All Might‚Äôs promise and issues an arrest warrant for him. Eraserhead decided that he‚Äôs so done with the mousebear that he doesn‚Äôt even want to bother going after him (especially as Stain‚Äôs affair was also an issue to him). 

No one saw him again. Sir Nighteye and Lemillion are still pretending that this online consultant of theirs that‚Äôs helping them play their perpetual wargame with Legion is a human being, and not a villainous chimera in hiding. Mostly because he has a very well protected online connection. Another thing that Eraserhead really doesn‚Äôt care about.

He takes much less naps recently, which might have thrown his sense of reality off-balance. He has de facto retired from being an underground hero. So did Ms. Joke. Having children is, apparently, time consuming. Who would have known? He is fairly satisfied with the world outside being peaceful. And slightly peeved at how half of the League members are pretty much celebrities at this point, especially after Compress published his trilogy of films (if he sees one more student carrying Vampire merch he is going to commit manslaughter, don‚Äôt they realize that woman stabbed their principal at the USJ?!). 

And he isn‚Äôt even digging into the part where someone (and he is almost certain that Legion and Lemillion were somehow connected) has made a collectible card game about the darkest days of Japan. And yes, it was a smash hit as well. He also doesn‚Äôt like the graphic design of his own card. 

Japan is making less and less sense as the time passes, really. Legion and Lemillion are to be blamed, no doubt about it. Legion is mostly playing around with the crime, until some villain group tries to break off from the League, breaks the rules or comes from outside of Japan without asking and conforming to the local rules. 

Then he gets nasty (as in, ‚Äòlet‚Äôs massacre them all and leave their bodies in some public place to scare the next batch of idiots straight‚Äô nasty). And yes, people still remember what happened with those Russians. Ugh. 

Lemillion keeps going after him and his associates but they are for some reason very well hidden and when they are arrested, Vanguard Action Squad attacks the convoy (without killing anyone, of course) and they are gone. Eraserhead is also super done with that. 

It greatly contributed to his retirement as an underground hero. 

At least the discrimination issues are becoming less and less of a problem, according to the stats (when both the Symbol of Peace and the Symbol of Evil hate you, you‚Äôre done with life). Crime rates are down too. Terror groups go for assassinations (or flashy non-lethal battles against heroes in front of the cameras to increase public awareness of their problems) rather than blowing up public spaces. 

Yeah, they are positives of the situation. But this is still messed up. And he still doesn‚Äôt care. 

New year is about to start. The entrance results are in and they have already sorted out the classes. Eraserhead is skimming through the list of his soon-to-be menaces, trying to figure out who is going to be this year‚Äôs problem child and‚Ä¶ 

Oh. 

Shigaraki Eri. 

Maybe he should retire from being principal too? 
Notes:

    We've got to the end! Am I happy about this fic? Honestly, not quite. The ending was rushed, several plotlines I planned (like Shinsou/Split pairing and her help in making him take the chill pill) ended up being somewhat scrapped in the hurry to finish it. I'd also rewrite the story to have a smaller text-to-chat ratio, because I slightly lose control over the chatroom (although don't worry, seeing how popular they ended up being I'd simply add more scenes written in text rather than erasing chatrooms). Many events would also play out differently.

    Then again, that was my first fanfic. I sincerely believe that the remaining ones in the series are much better than this one, at least when writing is involved (please, even if the premise looks quirky, give them a chance, they're really good it's just my dumb ass picking unpopular premises out of some deep-seated masochism or smth).

    Still, it was a fun journey. Thank you for all your comments and kudos :D And once again, check other fics in the series.
