Chapter Text

Five Years Ago

 

 

Father still isn’t back yet.

 

“I’ll just be gone for a few hours, a day at most,” Father had assured him before stepping out in the suit he saves for special occasions.

 

Izuku knows that oftentimes, his father lies, but Father has never before been gone longer than a day.

 

It’s been over a week.

 

Izuku could be worried, but instead, he finds himself filled with a sort of sick hope. He knows he shouldn’t, he knows that he should want his father to come back. But he just can’t. These past eleven days have been the calmest of his life. There’s no one telling him what to make or eat, no one proofreading every piece of his homework, no one taking him into the basement for all sorts of training at all hours.

 

It’s just Izuku and whatever Izuku wants to do.

 

He makes himself meals his father would never approve of. He eats desert without Father’s permission. He watches hero cartoons on the television instead of the news Father always puts on.

 

Despite the comfortable haze Izuku settles into, he always dreads coming home from school. What if today is the day he comes back?

 

A couple nights, Izuku doesn’t go home. He sleeps in the park on a bench or with a sleeping bag in an alleyway. He could be scared but, honestly, nothing scares him anymore. Nothing but Father.

 

On the eleventh day, Izuku goes home after school. He’s had enough restless nights outside that his back is starting to hurt. If Father is here, then Izuku might as well deal with him now rather than later.

 

He steps up to the door and silently turns the key. It swings open with less sound than Izuku makes breathing.

 

Father’s shoes are there, scuffed and so worn they’re barely usable anymore, but they’re there nonetheless. Izuku’s blood runs cold but his face doesn’t show it. He enters, closes the door, and switches into his slippers.

 

“Father!” Izuku calls. “I’m home!”

 

Silence. Nothing.

 

Izuku’s fingers twitch, nervous energy needing somewhere to go.

 

Where’s their routine? Father is supposed to respond with, welcome home, Izuku! Then, once they’re in the same room, they’ll engage in a safe conversation about how each other’s days were.

 

But, Father doesn’t say welcome home .

 

He doesn’t say anything.

 

Izuku debates, for a moment, ignoring the fact that his father should be here and just continuing on with his day. But then he considers the hours of chastising he’ll likely get later for not properly greeting him and Izuku goes in search of him.

 

The first thing he notices is the beeping. He can hear it from the hallway. It’s not particularly loud, but accompanied by the rhythmic heavy breathing, it’s sufficiently unsettling. Izuku knocks on Father’s door twice, like he always does.

 

“Izuku?” asks a voice that isn’t his father’s. It’s rough and quiet and broken and half-air and lacks the confidence Father’s voice has.

 

Izuku doesn’t want to open the door.

 

“Izuku,” the voice says again. “Come in... please.”

 

He opens the door anyway. Izuku doesn’t recognize the room. He isn’t sure how it was remodeled so quickly, but then he remembers he hasn’t been home in three days.

 

Right.

 

The wall of bookshelves has been replaced with a pair of bulky machines, both spewing an uncountable mess of tubes and wires leading into the wall and the bed. The bed, which had once been covered in a comforter and a mass of pillows, now has nothing but a sheet.

 

And a man.

 

The man is hooked up to many of the wires and tubes, but Izuku’s eyes don’t stay still long enough to catch what is leading where. The man wears an oxygen mask, which is likely what dulls his voice. Above the mask lie bandages which fit tightly against the entire top-half of his face and over his hair--or, based on how tight it is, maybe he doesn’t have any hair. Izuku’s eyes linger on the bandages, on the fact that they cover his eyes , but there’s so much new information in this room alone that Izuku can’t process everything.

 

“Where were you last night?” the man asks in that half-choking voice of his.

 

Izuku grips the doorknob a little tighter.

 

“Where’s my father? Midoriya Hisashi?”

 

The man’s entire body tenses and the beeping speeds up for a moment before settling down again.

 

“Izuku...” he sounds sad, dejected, but Izuku is the one who doesn’t know why this injured stranger in his house.

 

“Who are you?” Izuku asks, trying to hide his fear.

 

The man takes a moment to just breathe--because he needs to consciously think about the action--and then says, “ I am your father, Izuku. I am Hisashi.”

 

Izuku bites his lower lip. “You’re not,” he whispers. “You can’t be.”

 

“Here--” the man reaches out his hand slowly, the process obviously measured. “--I’ll prove it. You don’t have one right now, do you? I’ll give you one... Which do you want? Air Walk? A strength enhancer? Pull? I’ve been gone far too long. You can pick whichever you want.”

 

Izuku lets out a breath.

 

The choice.

 

His father rarely lets him chose which quirk he gets and he already knows his answer--of course he does.

 

“Pull,” he announces, trying to sound confident. “I want Pull.”

 

The man-- Hisashi? --smiles behind the oxygen mask and curls his fingers in a beckon for Izuku to move closer. “Come here and I’ll give it to you.”

 

After a moment of hesitation, Izuku lets go of the door handle and steps into the room. It smells like a hospital, which Izuku only recognizes from the time Father got paranoid over a simple cold and they went to the emergency room.

 

“You don’t have to be scared, Izuku.”

 

Izuku takes a deep breath and reaches out his hand.

 

As soon as they touch he feels it, the power which constantly buzzes under his father’s skin, the myriad of quirks which are so close but never within Izuku’s own reach. And then, like a chill running over his entire body, a part of that power transfers to him. A single quirk. More than Izuku himself has naturally, but just a fraction of his father’s power.

 

He feels the already familiar tug of Pull, his favorite quirk out of all the ones he’s tried so far.

 

“Believe me?” his father asks, withdrawing his hand.

 

“Yes, sorry, Father.” Izuku glances up at his father’s face but can’t bring himself to look for longer than a second.

 

“There was a villain attack,” Father supplies, “on my way home from the meeting. They got the car and... before I realized what had happened...”

 

Izuku swallows. In the silence all he hears is medical equipment and Father’s heavy breaths.

 

“I was in the hospital,” Father continues. “And... this had happened.”

 

“How long ago?” Izuku asks quietly.

 

“What?”

 

“How long ago did you wake up?”

 

Father cringes and looks away. “Two days ago.”

 

Izuku flinches, but keeps his voice carefully even as he says, “I see,” and leaves the room.

 

 

 

 

Present Day

 

 

“Since you’re all third years, now, it’s about time we discuss high school aspirations,” their homeroom teacher announces. There’s a moment of silence before he continues, “Who am I kidding, you’re all looking to become heroes!”

 

The class erupts into excited chatter and cheer.

 

“Midoriya-kun and Bakugou-kun,” the teacher begins, quickly getting their attention. “You’ve both already decided on trying for UA, correct?”

 

Katsuki just grunts an affirmative.

 

“Yes!” Izuku answers cheerfully, pumping a fist into the air. He deflates after a moment. “Is it just us who are applying?”

 

The teacher scrunches up his nose. “Ah, yes, as far as I know.”

 

Izuku frowns. “Why isn’t anybody else applying?” He turns to the classroom as a whole, and they know someone will have to answer.

 

“We don’t, uh, have suitable quirks, you know?” a boy answers, rubbing the back of his head.

 

“Nonsense!” Izuku answers with a clap of his hands. “First off, it’s not just the quirk that makes the hero. Secondly, all of you have quirks that could be used for heroics if you tried!”

 

They’ve all heard this speech before, but none of them interrupt him.

 

They know better.

 

“Yes, Midoriya-kun, you’re quite right,” the teacher states after clearing his throat. “Now, let’s get back to class, everyone.”

 

 

Izuku walks home alone, like he does every day. Once, many years ago, Katsuki had tried walking home with him, seeing as they only lived a block away from each other. Izuku’s father hadn’t approved and they never did it again.

 

So, Izuku walks home alone, earbuds playing energetic classical music. He takes the slightly longer route. He likes this way better; it’s less direct and more scenic. His class got out a bit early, anyways, so he can spare the extra minute.

 

As walks under the overpass, he doesn’t hear the sewer cover slide open or the animate slime crawl out. He isn’t even aware he’s in danger until he can’t breath. Liquid slides past his earbuds and into his ears, his nose and his mouth. He struggles, bites down, claws, tries to hold his breath, but there’s only so long he’ll be able to last.

 

His current quirk, Pull, is useless in this scenario, and he’s fully aware of this fact as his vision wanes and all he can hear is his heart beating much too quickly in his ears.

 

And then it’s over.

 

The villain bursts away with a gust of wind.

 

Izuku drops to his knees and tries to breath. Someone hits his back and he coughs up remnants of the slime until his lungs are free. Izuku blinks away tears and sees none other than the Number One Hero.

 

“All Might,” Izuku breathes.

 

All Might smiles down at him with the same smile Izuku has seen everywhere--the news, the internet, posters, t-shirts--except it’s here, in real life, and it’s directed at him. Izuku can’t help but smile back.

 

“How are you feeling, my boy?” All Might asks, voice echoing against the walls.

 

“Great!” Izuku answers as he pushes himself to his feet. “Wow, I seriously can’t believe you’re All Might. You are All Might, right?”

 

All Might laughs. “Of course I am! However, I am in a hurry, so if you’re alright I must be going.”

 

“Oh, don’t worry about me. I’m totally fine!”

 

All Might furrows his eyebrows. “If you’re so sure,” he mutters, but still louder than anyone’s natural speaking volume. “Please get checked up at a hospital just to be safe.”

 

And then All Might leaves in a flurry of movement that Izuku’s eyes can’t track.

 

Izuku smiles at the memory of All Might and searches the underpass for his backpack. It’s soaked and a little slimy, but otherwise the contents are relatively fine. He immediately calls his father.

 

“Izuku?” his father asks, a semblance of concern riddling his voice. “Are you alright?”

 

“I’m running a few minutes late,” Izuku says, already walking. “I’m totally fine. I’m not hurt at all. I just got in a little altercation with a villain.”

 

“Really? What happened?”

 

“I’m not entirely sure myself. I can explain once I get home. I’m ten or fifteen minutes away at this point.”

 

“Alright,” his father says, not sounding very convinced. “As long as you’re safe.”

 

“I am. Love you. See you soon.”

 

“Love you too.”

 

 

Izuku doesn’t expect to encounter another villain on his walk home, but he does. So, he does what he always does when he comes across a villain attack on his walk. He texts his father he’ll be a couple extra minutes late, and steps forward to watch.

 

He knows he’s more than a bit hypocritical as he judges the civilians gawking at the event, doing nothing more than gossip and complain. He tries to convince himself that he’s different, that he’s observing for analytical purposes, to learn something, but it doesn’t work.

 

He weaves through the crowd, already making observations. The smell of smoke. Unusual silence. The heroes are normally louder, flashier. A reporter is narrating but it’s hard for him to understand over the hum of the crowd. When he finally breaks through, he realizes what’s going on before the reporter says it.

 

“The heroes are unable to interfere with the situation until someone with a more suitable quirk shows up.”

 

Unable .

 

The word weighs on Izuku, pushes him down until he can barely breath. Because there’s a victim, right there, suffocating like Izuku was just minutes before, and no one is doing anything because the heroes have unsuitable quirks. Because the risk is too high. Because the victim is fighting back the only way they know how.

 

Their eyes meet and the victim is no longer a victim, but Bakugou Katsuki.

 

Izuku is moving before he realizes it, the previous weight propelling him like a spring.

 

His father’s words echo around him, surrounding him, “Heroes are naturally selfish, Izuku. They’re only it in for the money or the fame."

 

Izuku knows the limits of his current quirk. He knows it isn’t suitable against a liquid pile of slime. But Izuku goes anyway, running past the reporter and the couple of heroes who try to stop him, reaching out with Pull and finding the villain’s two eyes. He doesn’t stop running even as he takes them in his grasp and Pulls them towards him.

 

He only tertiarily registers the villain’s screams, more focused on Katsuki. Izuku wishes he could Pull bigger things, just Pull Katsuki himself out. But he can’t. So instead he reaches out with his hands, ignoring the blistering heat, ignoring the slime tugging at him.

 

A familiar burst of air disintegrates the slime and the shout of, “I am here! ” ends everything.

 

 

“What were you thinking?” Kamui Woods asks him as he sits on the end of the ambulance, a blanket wrapped around his shoulders. Katsuki is right next to him, getting an entirely different speech from another hero.

 

Izuku drops his head and lets a few tears out. He wraps his arms around his chest. “I-I wasn’t,” he says. “It just--I had--and then I was running.”

 

“Hey,” Kamui says, crouching down, putting his hands on Izuku’s knees. “It’s okay. I’m sorry. We were all just worried for you. What you did was very dangerous. You could have seriously gotten hurt.”

 

Izuku nods and wipes the tears from his eyes.

 

Katsuki scoffs.

 

“I need to--to call my dad,” Izuku says. Kamui stands up and gives him a small smile.

 

“Of course, go ahead.”

 

Izuku takes his phone from his bag, which one of the heroes had placed on the ground beside them at some point, and dials his father.

 

“Are you alright?” his father asks, slightly desperate.

 

Izuku sniffs. “I’m--I’ll be fine. I don’t know how much longer they’ll keep me for so I don’t know when I’ll be able to make dinner.”

 

“Don’t push yourself, please. I’ll order us something. You’ve had a long day.”

 

“Thanks.”

 

“And you’re sure you’re fine?”

 

“Physically? Yeah. I got checked out by a medic and everything.”

 

“Just, promise you’ll stay safe.”

 

“Promise.”

 

“I love you. Come home in one piece.”

 

“Love you, too. Bye.”

 

“Oi, Izukun,” Katsuki grunts after the heroes leave.

 

Izuku just hums in response, turning to look at Katsuki.

 

“What was that crying shit about? We both know literally the only thing you do is think.”

 

Izuku snorts. “You know just as well as I do, Kachan.”

 

Katsuki rolls his eyes with enough drama to roll his head with them. “It was one of your ploys, sure, but how does looking like a little bitch help you?”

 

“Kachan,” Izuku begins with a little more condescension than he had intended, “Is now really the right time to talk about this? And why should I just give you the answer, anyway? You’re smart enough to figure it out on your own.”

 

Katsuki snarls and turns away. “Fine. And I hope you’re not expecting a thank you. ‘Cause you ain’t getting one.”

 

Izuku just smiles. “Of course not.”

 

 

He finally leaves after an hour of a police and a hero interview.

 

Less than five minutes into his walk, he runs into All Might again.

 

“My boy!” All Might announces as he skids to a stop.

 

“All Might?” Izuku asks, subconsciously fixing his posture. “What are you doing here?”

 

Before All Might can answer, he erupts into a cloud of smoke. When it dies down, a man with All Might’s height and hair, but who has maybe half, if that, of his weight stands in his place.

 

“Shit,” the man--who is either All Might or some sort of impersonator--cusses before coughing out a spurt of blood.

 

Izuku can’t help but reach out to support him, thinking of his father in perpetual bed rest back at home.

 

“I’m fine, young man,” All Might insists--because by Occam’s Razor he is All Might.

 

Izuku furrows his eyebrows. “If you’re coughing blood, you’re missing some internal organs. You’re not fine. My father has sustained a similar level of injuries and he’s essentially bedridden.”

 

All Might frowns ever so slightly; it’s more like a cringe. “A villain attack?”

 

Izuku nods. “Yes, a few years ago.”

 

“I’m sorry.”

 

Izuku tilts his head. “Why? It was a villain who injured him, not you.”

 

“I was unable to protect him.”

 

Izuku pouts and is silent for a moment. “I don’t expect you to protect everyone. No offense, but you’re simply incapable of the feat.”

 

All Might jolts a bit and coughs again. “Oh!” he exclaims. “You’re probably confused. About... this.” All Might waves a hand in a gesture at his form.

 

Izuku shrugs. “I mean, no one knows what your quirk is. Mutation, although a rare theory with very little previous evidence, was still on the table.” Izuku knows. He wrote a six page paper on the mutation theory. Although it hadn’t satiated his father, it had entertained him.

 

“It isn’t... exactly mutation.” All Might somehow manages to look sheepish, an expression Izuku never would have imagined on his face before. He clears his throat. “Well, I came here today to tell you that what you did earlier was extremely heroic. It’s what spurred me to action! Who knows what would’ve happened if you hadn’t stepped in.”

 

Izuku smiles and tries really hard to bury his paranoia that All Might is just saying that to get something from him. He fails. “Thanks.”

 

“What is your quirk, if you’re willing to share?”

 

Izuku dips his head a little and rubs the back of his neck. “Ah, well, it’s sort of complicated.”

 

All Might raises an eyebrow. “You’re telling that to me.”

 

“Right. It’s weird, some sort of genetic mutation or aberration, they think. The basic function of my quirk drastically changes every six months to a year. For instance, right now I have Pull, but just a few weeks ago it was Fire Breath.”

 

All Might blinks for a few moments.

 

“It’s called Random Quirk Generator, if that helps.”

 

“That’s... weird, but I’m definitely not one to judge.” All Might places a hand on Izuku’s shoulder. “You’re going to be a great hero one day.”

 

Izuku tries not to react, but he honestly isn’t sure if he succeeds or not. The statement is so honest , so pure that Izuku can’t comprehend it.

 

“I’d like to help you, If you’ll let me.”

 

Izuku expertly ignores the offer. “Why do you think I’m going to become a hero?”

 

All Might just laughs, patting Izuku’s shoulder a couple times. “Tell me something--oh, shit, uh.” All Might blushes. “Uh, what’s your--” he clears his throat “--your name.”

 

“Oh!” Izuku smiles. “Midoriya Izuku, at your service.”

 

“Midoriya-kun, sorry. Well, tell me something, why did you interfere with the villain attack?”

 

Izuku furrows his eyebrows. “There wasn't a why . Before I knew it, I was just... there.”

 

All Might’s smile grows. “Every successful hero has a story of how their feet moved before they realized.”

 

Izuku’s eyes widen.

 

“That’s what happened to you, yes?”

 

“Yes.”

 

“Then you’re going to be a great hero. I’d like to offer you a proposition. My own quirk.”

 

Anyone else would have been surprised at the prospect of one handing off a quirk to another. However, Izuku has grown up with the passing on of quirks as a simple fact of life; the only weird thing about this situation is that it’s someone other than his father—and they’re asking him. It’s his choice. Or, at least, the illusion of choice is there.

 

Izuku swallows and realizes he should be surprised at this offer.

 

“Y-your quirk?” Izuku stutters, raising an eyebrow and doing nothing in particular with his hands. They flounder aimlessly, like flippers or wings.

 

He wonders if he’s going to learn what All Might’s quirk is. If he’s lucky enough to. If, after hundreds of pages of analysis which were all, no matter what, wrong , he’ll finally find out the truth.

 

“Yes!” All Might announces, then takes a moment to swallow. Izuku composes himself.  “You see, my quirk is one which can be passed down, which I myself received from someone before me. It’s called One for All.”

 

Izuku blinks, scrunches up his face in mock confusion. “Passed down... I’ve never heard of a quirk that can do that,” he lies.

 

“Well, my boy! It’s the truth! And I’m offering it to you! You have the personality and makings of a hero!” All Might extends his hand. “So, what’s your decision?”

 

It isn’t a decision. Izuku knows this. But sometimes, his father asks him as well, asks him which quirk he wants like Izuku has any say in the matter. Izuku always answers him because that’s what he wants him to do.

 

“Yes,” Izuku answers, just as much air as words. “My answer is yes.”

 

 

Izuku feels empty, like he won the lottery but he doesn’t have anything to buy with the money. He knows All Might’s quirk-- One for All-- but he doesn’t know what to do with the information. Research? Write another paper? Tell his father? No. He definitely can’t tell his father. That wouldn’t anything accomplish at all.

 

But now... after all those pages he finally has the answer. He doesn’t feel any better for it. If anything, he feels worse.

 


When Izuku gets home, he tells his father an easy lie about how long the interviewing took and doesn’t once mention All Might outside of he saved us .
Notes:

    This is gonna be a long, wild ride, y’all. Please keep all hands and feet within the vehicle while Hisashi/AFO continues being a terrible parent.

Chapter Text

Toshinori finally texts Midoriya by the end of the week. He hadn’t been putting it off, per say, just... waiting for the right time. Yeah, that’s it.

 

No, he’s lying to himself.

 

The prospect of texting someone first is utterly terrifying, especially when that someone is his successor.

 

DM -- Midoriya Izuku

 

[Toshinori Yagi]

Is this Midoriya’s number?

 

[Midoriya Izuku]

Yes, it is!

 

[Toshinori Yagi]

Great! I was hoping we could begin physical training soon

When are you available?

 

[Midoriya Izuku]

I’ll have to check with my father, but I should be free for a couple hours before or after school and more on the weekends.

 

[Toshinori Yagi]

Let me know what works best!

And I was thinking we could meet at Dagobah beach if that works for you?

 

[Midoriya Izuku]

Sounds good to me!

I’ll get back to you ASAP!

 

Toshinori lets out a sigh of relief and drops his head on his desk. Before he can properly congratulate himself, he gets a text from Naomasa asking if he wants to meet for coffee.

 

 

“So,” Naomasa says over his tea (which isn’t coffee, but Toshinori doesn’t say anything). “You’ve picked a successor.”

 

“Ah—uh—yes,” Toshinori stammers, slinking deeper into his seat.

 

Naomasa chuckles. “There’s no need to feel put on the spot, Toshinori. I’m not judging you, just curious. Tell me, what’s he like?”

 

Toshinori sits up straight and smiles. “He’s very mature for his age. And heroic... The slime villain incident, did you hear about it?”

 

Naomasa just raises an eyebrow in judgement. “I’m a detective, Toshinori. It’s my job to know about criminal incidents.”

 

Toshinori lets out a breathy laugh. “Right, right, of course. He’s the one who tried to save the victim.”

 

“Oh?”

 

“Yeah. Even though his quirk wasn’t well-suited and he’d already encountered the villain once before—“

 

“Oh, “ Naomasa begins, “he’s that kid.”

 

Toshinori blinks. “What kid? Who else would he be?”

 

“Nothing—” Naomasa waves his hand and shakes his head. “Continue.”

 

“Oh...kay. I mean, he’s selfless, is basically my point.”

 

“How well do you know him?”

 

“Er... enough?”

 

Naomasa sighs and rubs his eyes. “I’m not going to tell you that this is probably a bad idea, because it is your choice but, please try to think about your actions once in a while. Please? For me?”

 

“I do!”

 

Naomasa rolls his eyes. “Sure, whatever you say.”

 

“I do, Naomasa.”

 

Naomasa doesn’t look even remotely convinced, but before he can chastise Toshinori more the buzzing of his phone interrupts them. “Sorry, I have to go. Work.”

 

“No worries! It was great catching up with you!” Toshinori says as he stands up.

 

Naomasa smiles, says goodbye, and heads out.

 

- - -

 

They meet that Saturday at nine in the morning. Toshinori shows up thirty minutes early only because he couldn’t really sleep and waiting around his apartment was giving him anxiety. He sits idly on a bench just outside the entrance to the beach, trying to look busy on his phone, when he sees Midoriya walking down.

 

“Midoriya-kun!” Toshinori yells with a wave of his hand, standing up.

 

Midoriya smiles and jogs over. “Hello, sir!” When he stops just a few feet away he asks, “Is there anything specific you’d like me to call you while you’re in this form? If not I can continue with sir and sensei.”

 

Toshinori debates before answering, “Yagi is fine, my boy.”

 

The smile he’s met with is more than worth it.

 

“Yagi-sensei it is, then!”

 

Toshinori coughs into his fist at the honorific. “S-sensei? You really don’t have to.”

 

“Would you prefer shishou?” The casual way in which Midoriya asks causes heat to rise to Toshinori’s cheeks.

 

“N-no. Just Yagi is fine, I insist.”

 

Midoriya pouts, but says, “If you say so.”

 

“How about we get started?” Toshinori asks loudly, trying to change the subject.

 

“Sure! You said this is physical training, right? I already have some experience with physical activities, but not too much.”

 

“Really?” Toshinori takes in Midoriya’s brand new bright red sneakers which look like they belong on a display shelf, his half-mesh black leggings, his loose long-sleeved athletic shirt, and the bright red hair band keeping his hair back.

 

“Yup! I have two or three years of MMA—“ Toshinori almost chokes on nothing in shock, “—six of gymnastics, and I regularly do my father’s physical therapy with him so I think I’m in shape.”

 

Toshinori blinks, then realizes he’s supposed to say something. “Oh, wow. Well, this probably won’t take as long as I thought, then.”

 

“This?”

 

“Yes!” Toshinori announces and opens his arms wide. “Clearing the beach! People have always been throwing their trash here, so you’re going to drag it to the dump!”

 

Midoriya smiles and swings his backpack—a small, leather thing that rivals the price of his shoes—and pulls out a pair of thick working gloves. “I thought you might say that, so I came prepared.”

 

Toshinori watches as Midoriya puts on the gloves and stands up, feet shoulder-width apart. “Are we starting today?” Midoriya asks.

 

“You keep surprising me, Midoriya-kun.” Toshinori shakes his head and sighs. “How about this? I give you a daily exercise schedule, a special diet plan, and you work at your own pace on the beach. Try to get from... that refrigerator, with the three tires on top, to the overturned pick-up truck within six months. Does that sound reasonable?”

 

Midoriya looks at the pile of trash before saying, “Everything except the meal plan. My father is very specific about what I eat.”

 

“Alrighty!” Toshinori pulls a crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket. “Here’s my original exercise plan. I’ll likely end up changing it to take into account your experience.”

 

Midoriya scans it quickly, nodding. “Yes, this is reasonable. I can probably start out heavier, though. For now, how about I just skip the first month’s plan and start on the second?”

 

Toshinori taps his chin in thought before answering. “That sounds acceptable. I’ll try to write up a new plan for you as soon as I can.”

 

“Cool!” Midoriya places the paper in his bag and starts stretching. “I have a quick question, and don’t feel obligated to answer it if you don’t want to.”

 

“Shoot.”

 

“Why are we doing physical training? I mean, I know it’s important to have both endurance and strength as a hero, but I already have above-average both of those.”

 

“Great question! Your body is not yet fit enough to support my quirk. If you took it now, you may or may not explode.”

 

Midoriya blinks up at him. “Oh. Wow. Okay, then.”

 

“Don’t worry about it!” Toshinori insists with a smile and a thumbs up. “That’s what the training is for!”

 

“Right!” Midoriya responds, pumping his fist into the air before returning to his stretches.

 

After another minute of Midoriya stretching and Toshinori scrolling through news on his phone without actually reading any of it, Midoriya speaks up again. “Oh, Yagi-san, what kind of music do you like?”

 

“Music? Oh, I like western classic rock the best, American bands you probably haven’t heard of.”

 

“American?” Midoriya smiles and pulls out his phone. “My work-out playlist is almost exclusively American. Could I play it?”

 

“Really? Yeah! Go ahead.”

 

 

Midoriya drags a mostly broken washing machine across the sand while Seven Nation Army blares from his pants’ pockets. Midoriya--to Toshinori’s surprise--is singing along easily despite both the strenuous activity and that the song is not in Japanese.

 

“Hey, Midoriya-kun?” Toshinori asks from his perch atop the washing machine.

 

Midoriya stops mid-word to say, “Yeah?”

 

“Do you know English?”

 

Midoriya chuckles. “Ish. I can understand it pretty well, but speaking it is a different story.”

 

“Impressive.”

 

Midoriya shrugs despite the weight he’s supporting. “Not really. Maybe if I were fluent.”

 

“You’re what, fourteen, and can already understand a second language? That’s impressive, Midoriya-kun.”

 

“Thanks,” he says without his usual enthusiasm.

 

“I mean it!”

 

Midoriya drops the washing machine off at the side of the road and catches his breath for a moment. “I know.”

 

Toshinori doesn’t know if he believes him or not.

 

But then Feel Good Inc. comes on and somehow Midoriya knows all the words.

 

- - -

 

Izuku doesn’t know how to handle All Might--Yagi--some times. Most times. Yagi is just so different from literally every other adult he’s ever interacted with. He doesn’t lie--or if he does he’s better at it than Father, but that seems a bit too far-fetched. And Yagi is so straightforward.

 

Whenever Izuku’s teachers compliment him, it’s because they want to get on his father’s good side. But Yagi is just complimenting Izuku to compliment him and Izuku doesn’t know what to do. Yagi doesn’t even know Father. Hopefully.

 

“You’re almost there!” Yagi cheers from the roof of the dishwasher while he holds a box of something that Izuku knows must be heavy. “You only have a few more meters to go, my boy!”

 

There isn’t any purpose to Yagi’s words other than to motivate Izuku.

 

The worst part is they’re working.

 

When Izuku stops next to the washing machine, already sweaty and short of breath, Yagi hops down and places a hand on his shoulder.

 

“Good job, my boy!” There isn’t any malice. No hidden passive aggression. “At this rate, you’ll probably finish the goal before the six months are up!” He means every word he says.

 

“Th-thanks,” Izuku says in lieu of having a real conversation.

 

“No need to thank me! It’s the truth!”

 

Izuku doesn’t know how to respond to that, so he just smiles and hopes it’s enough.

 

- - -

 

Izuku exercises for an hour every morning before school and two hours after classes at the local gym. Then he comes home, makes and eats dinner with his father, and works on clearing the beach for two or three hours. Sometimes, Yagi shows up and keeps him company, but most of the time he’s only free on the weekends, when Izuku works nine to three straight save the lunch break.

 

It’s tough. He’s up late into the night working on homework or studying. But Izuku knows it will be worth it.

 

A couple weeks in, as they take a break from hauling to eat the lunch Izuku packed (he packed one for Yagi, too. He does every day. Otherwise Yagi won’t eat.), Yagi asks, “I don’t mean to be intrusive, but what exactly is your quirk? I mean, I know it’s Random something or the other, and you said it changes every couple months. But, like, what does that mean?”

 

“Oh, sure! Well, remember when we met?” Izuku asks, setting his bento down.

 

“Of course.”

 

“I had the quirk Pull back then and I could telepathically pull small objects or parts of objects towards myself. Now, I have Empathy, and I can see emotions as colors. I don’t have Pull anymore, and there’s a chance I never will.”

 

In reality, about a week ago, Father had taken Pull back and given Izuku Empathy in turn. Father hadn't said anything, hadn't told Izuku why he switched his quirks. Izuku didn't ask because there wasn't any point. Father never told him.

 

“Weird,” Yagi says, then waves his hand, eyes wide. “No offense or anything! I’ve just never heard of a quirk like yours!”

 

“None taken, Yagi-san. It’s extremely unpredictable. I could wake up tomorrow with an entirely different quirk and I wouldn’t have any warning.”

 

That is, in a way, the truth. Father doesn't ask Izuku permission to switch out his quirks. He just does it. Sometimes he does it while Izuku is sleeping.

 

Yagi cringes. “That sounds annoying.”

 

Izuku shrugs. “I’ve gotten used to it.”

 

“What are your parents quirks?”

 

“My father’s is Fire Breath,” Izuku lies without second thought. “My mother had some version of Pull, I’m pretty sure.”

 

“Had?”

 

“Yeah. Oh, she’s dead.”

 

Yagi flinches and his aura turns a light grey-silvery color. Sadness? Or maybe guilt? “I’m sorry,” Yagi says.

 

“Don’t be. I never knew her. She died in childbirth.”

 

“Oh,” is all Yagi says, and then the conversation dies down into awkward silence until they finish eating and head back to cleaning up the beach.

 

- - -

 

Midoriya’s phone pings as they lug a wheeless van across the sand. Midoriya could maybe drag it on his own, but Toshinori had taken one look at it and gone nope, this one’s a group project.

 

“Sorry, Yagi-san,” Midoriya begins, slowing their momentum down to a stop. “I should check that.”

 

“No need to apologize, my boy! I would hate for you to worry your father!” They let go of the van and Midoriya checks his phone.

 

Toshinori has never met Midoriya’s father, but from what he’s heard, he’s a respectable man. Unlike some other parents Toshinori knows, Hisashi is still protective of Midoriya even though he’s fully independent at his age. Much of that protectiveness likely comes from Hisashi’s own experience as a victim of villains. Some may argue that Hisashi is over protective, but Toshinori much prefers overbearing parents to those who don’t care at all.

 

“It’s a HeroWatch update,” Midoriya tells Toshinori, sounding surprised. “Endeavor is fighting a villain in town.”

 

“Endeavor?” Toshinori asks, equally surprised.

 

“Yeah. I’ve never seen him out here before. I wasn’t aware he left Tokyo.”

 

Toshinori snickers at the casual diss and says, “Do you want to go check it out?” Then, remembering that Midoriya’s father has left the boy in his care, adds on, “Is your father alright with you chasing after villain attacks?”

 

Midoriya chuckles. “He... tolerates it as long as I promise not to get too close. Are you sure you’re fine with cutting our training short?”

 

Toshinori pumps a fist into the air. “Young man, the brain is just another muscle! This way we can train it, too! Also, Endeavor is the number two hero. It’ll do you some good to see him in battle!”

 

“Awesome! We should get going then.”

 

 

Toshinori drives them to the location after Midoriya convinces him that this is not a good reason for him to use his quirk. They get there within five minutes of receiving the notification and Midoriya almost throws himself out of the car as soon as he parks.

 

“Slow down, my boy!” Toshinori says with a light-hearted laugh, but Midoriya still jumps in place, obviously excited.

 

“This will be my first time watching a hero battle with Empathy!” Midoriya exclaims. “I’ll be able to collect so much more data! Let’s go!”

 

Toshinori smiles and finally pulls himself out of the car. Midoriya takes that as his cue and runs straight for the crowd of gawkers. When Midoriya moves to head into them, Toshinori pulls him back by his shirt and gives him the best disappointing parental glare he can muster.

 

“Remember,” Toshinori begins. “You can’t get too close.”

 

Midoriya juts out his chin. “Sure, Yagi-san, but the problem is I can’t see from here.”

 

Toshinori looks over the heads crowd with ease at the current throw-down, then smiles down at Midoriya. “You could get on my shoulders?”

 

Midoriya looks between the crowd and Toshinori for just a moment before nodding. Toshinori crouches down and Midoriya hastily scrambles up his back. He drapes his legs over Toshinori’s shoulders, allowing him to grab his ankles, and gently holds onto his forehead with one of his hands.

 

“Please don’t drop me,” Midoriya pleads as Toshinori slowly pushes himself to his feet.

 

“I’m a hero, Midoriya-kun. I’m not going to drop you.”

 

Around half a minute later, Midoriya tenses. “Something wrong?” Toshinori asks, wishing he could see his successor’s face. Nothing notable happens in the fight. This villain is being particularly evasive and can dodge a majority of Endeavor’s attacks. Their quirk isn’t obvious, but it may have something to do with reactions or reflexes.

 

“No,” Midoriya says, “Nothing. Just, their emotions are stronger than I was expecting.”

 

- - -

 

Red, with waves of black. He is furious and full of hate at the same time.

 

Not the villain. Endeavor.

 

That’s all he is, and his black-red spills over the area like steam, overpowering the auras of most everyone else.

 

Izuku hasn’t seen an aura so dense and massive before. He can barely even see through it. But he can see through it enough to see the yellow of the villain. Fear.

 

Izuku swallows and tries to ignore the wave of black washing over him.

 

“Stop--! ” Endeavor yells as he sends out another burst of flames, “Dodging, you fucking coward! Fight me! ”

 

The villain’s yellow pulses in response and they manage not to get burnt to a crisp by rolling out of the way at the last minute.

 

“This looks dangerous,” Yagi begins. “Endeavor’s never been known for his... control.”

 

Izuku doesn’t answer. He’s afraid to open his mouth, afraid that the black will come in if he does.

 

“Please!” the villain cries out and they don’t sound that much older than Izuku himself, maybe late teens, early twenties. “I didn’t mean to! My quirk, it--!”

 

“Shut up! ” Endeavor responds, sending out a wave so wide it warms the closest of the crowd, who let out a shriek and scramble to get back. The villain tries to dodge, they really do, and it’s a valiant effort but against Endeavor’s pure power they don’t stand a chance. The villain collapses to the ground with a silent scream and their aura is riddled with white stripes before it disappears entirely.

 

Pain. Unconsciousness.

 

After a moment of confused silence, the crowd erupts into applause and cheers, but Endeavor’s furious hatred doesn’t subside.

 

“Well. That was an experience. Got to cross that off your bucket list, yeah?” Yagi asks, slowly dropping to his knees. “Off you go.”

 

Izuku complies, jumping off Yagi’s back and landing with a few extra steps to catch himself.

 

“Is something wrong?” Yagi asks.

 

Izuku shakes his head, still afraid of opening his mouth.

 

Yagi raises an eyebrow, concern radiating off him in comforting pink pulses.

 

Izuku just motions to Yagi’s car, where Endeavor’s haze isn’t nearly as thick, and they head over. Izuku doesn’t open his mouth until they’re both inside the car and both doors close, when he can finally breathe. He sucks in a deep breath of fresh, unbiased air, and smiles.

 

“Are you alright, Midoriya-kun?” Yagi asks, his pink even brighter now.

 

Izuku nods enthusiastically. “I’m fine, now, just got a little bit overwhelmed. Crowds.”

 

“I apologize, I hadn’t even considered.”

 

“No, no,” Izuku insists. “It’s not your fault at all! Just a side effect of Empathy.”

 

Yagi pouts. “If you say so. I’m still sorry, though. Do you want me to drive you home?”

 

“No, I can walk. It’s fine.”

 

“Please, it’s the least I can do. I wouldn’t want to force you to walk through crowds if you aren’t feeling up to it. I may not know much about empathy quirks, but I know enough introverts.”

 

Izuku snorts. “Can I convince you not to?”

 

“Nope. I’m already driving!” Yagi says as he pulls the car into the street.

 

Izuku sighs and pulls on his seat belt. “Wait. Do you even know how to get to my house?”

 

Yagi’s fingers tense against the wheel and he erupts in nervous laughter. “What? No! Of course I don’t know your address! Ha ha. Hah.”

 

Izuku raises an eyebrow. “I’m not going to ask.”

 

“It’s totally innocent!” Yagi insists, even though Izuku said he isn’t going to ask. “The other day, you weren’t answering your texts, and I got really worried, so I asked my detective friend to get me your address, just in case!”

 

“I said I wasn’t going to ask. I trust you, Yagi-san.” And somehow, Izuku thinks it might even be the truth.

 

Yagi just smiles, not comprehending the weight of Izuku’s honesty, and turns on the CD player. Fleetwood Mac plays throughout the entire ride. Both of them sing along to Landslide, even Yagi, who has always insisted he’s a terrible singer and will never ever sing in public ever again.

 

When they pull up to Izuku’s house, Yagi says. “Here you are. And please don’t tell your dad about the, er, Endeavor thing or that I used my police contacts to find your house. Thanks!”

 

“You should come in,” Izuku says even though it’s literally the last thing he wants. Because it may be the last thing he wants, but Izuku knows it’s the first thing Father wants. Father values social graces and traditions more than anyone Izuku knows. If he found out Yagi drove Izuku home and didn’t come in.

 

Well.

 

Then Izuku would have to be punished.

 

Yagi stammers nonsense before responding, “W-what?”

 

“Yeah! Come in, have some tea or a snack! I’m serious.”

 

When Yagi does nothing except turn redder, Izuku continues. “My father would kill me if he found out you came all this way and I didn’t invite you in.”

 

Yagi rubs the back of his neck. “I don’t know... I wouldn’t want to impose...”

 

“I’m insisting, please. My father’s been dying to meet you, anyway.”

 

Yagi wrings his hands together and stares at Izuku’s house. “Are you sure it’s fine?”

 

“It’d be less fine if you didn’t come. Let’s go.”

 

- - -

 

All for One feels it before they even step onto the property.

 

One for All.

 

All Might.

 

Here, at his house.

 

Wonderful.

 

“Father!” Izuku calls from the doorway. “I’m home! I brought Yagi-san, my physical trainer!”

 

“Wonderful!” All for One exclaims with none of the venom he thought the word with. All for One slowly stands up from his desk and drops his oxygen mask to his neck. He can go a couple minutes without it at a time, but sooner or later he will need it again. He throws a cardigan on over his polo shirt and jeans and heads to the living room.

 

He can feel One for All more intensely now, like a heat against his skin. It’s comforting, reminds him of his brother, and he wants it even though he knows he can’t take it.

 

All for One stops between the living and dining rooms, facing the house’s entryway with a small smile. “Yagi-san, it’s a pleasure to meet you.”

 

Yagi Toshinori--All Might--eighth holder of One for All--grabs All for One's hand and he feels it, so close but too far away, just outside of his reach. “Y-you too, Midoriya-san,” the man says.

 

“Please, please,” All for One says, relishing in the amount of power flirting against his skin. “None of that. Hisashi is fine.”

 

“Oh, well, uh, c-call me Toshinori, then.”

 

All for One's smile grows.

 

“Can I get you something to drink, Yagi-san?” Izuku asks from the kitchen. “Or a snack? We have water, tea, oranges, cookies.”

 

“Oh, no,” Yagi answers, finally withdrawing his hand. “I’m fine, really.”

 

“Please, you’re our guest,” All for One begins, leading them to the couches. “Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. Drink. Eat.”

 

Yagi swallows but sits down on the couch adjacent to All for One's. “I suppose I could drink some water. Thank you for the offer.”

 

All for One spares a moment to breath through his mask as Izuku hands Yagi a cup of water and sits down next to him.

 

“So,” All for One begins after catching his breath. “Izuku hasn’t been giving you any trouble, has he?”

 

“No!” Yagi exclaims. “Of course not! Midoriya-kun has been amazing to work with. In all honesty, sometimes I fear he may be spoiling me by making my job so easy.”

 

“Don’t sell yourself short, Yagi-san,” Izuku says. “You’re a great teacher.”

 

“Yes, Izuku is right, Toshinori. Over the past four months, I have watched him improve as a person under your guidance.”

 

Yagi sputters. “I-I really haven’t done much.”

 

Not yet, All for One thinks. But soon you’ll give him One for All. And that’s more than I could have ever asked for.

 

“What kind of training have you been doing?” All for One asks. “Izuku hasn’t told me much.” Anything, actually. They’ve both properly ignored the topic since Izuku mentioned he would be doing some extra training.

 

“We’re just working on clearing the beach. Dagobah Beach. You know the one?”

 

“Is that the one people use as a trash dump?”

 

“Yeah. I’m having Izuku clear a portion of it before entrance exams.”

 

Entrance exams? Such a specific deadline. Izuku’s attempts at not reacting are commendable, but All for One notices the way he turns his body away, how his shoulders close up slightly. “Oh? Entrance exams?” All for One asks, biting the lure Yagi unwittingly dropped.

 

“Yes,” Izuku answers a little too quickly, obviously to keep Yagi from responding. “Some schools require a physical exam along with a written one. Yagi-san is helping me ensure I’m in perfect shape.”

 

“And what schools are you looking at?” All for One asks.

 

“UA, of course!” Yagi answers with naive enthusiasm.

 

“I had no idea you were reaching so high, Izuku.”

 

“I’ll be applying to other schools, as well,” Izuku says, but they both know it’s a weak retort as soon as he says it. “UA is the best school for heroics, Father. You’re well aware of that.” The I’ve written enough papers to prove it, is left unsaid. “I believe my knowledge of quirks, overall physical capabilities, and academics will be more than enough to get me in.”

 

All for One and Izuku size each other up for a silent moment before Yagi interrupts.

 

“Personally--I mean, I know this isn’t really my place--but I believe Midoriya-kun is more than qualified for UA’s hero department.”

 

All for One turns to him. “And what makes you qualified to make that judgement?”

 

Yagi flinches and stammers silently for a moment before answering, “I-I actually work at a hero agency. I do PR.”

 

The Symbol of Peace lying.

 

What a sight.

 

“You do? I was unaware. My apologies.”

 

“It’s fine. I didn’t expect you to know.”

 

“So,” All for One begins, turning his attention back to Izuku. “You’re serious about becoming a hero.”

 

“Of course!” Izuku announces with false cheer. “I’ve always wanted to be a hero,” he lies. “Anyways, who doesn’t?”

 

All for One smiles. “Of course. Well, Toshinori, it’s been great having you but Izuku and I must be having dinner soon.”

 

All three of them stand at the same time.

 

“Thank you for tolerating me, Hisashi-san,” Yagi says with an awkward chuckle as they shake hands.

 

Izuku walks Yagi out and then they’re alone.

 

“So,” All for One begins without a smile. “You’re serious about becoming a hero.”

Chapter Text

Eight Years Ago

 

 

Izuku hands in the essay with perfectly still hands. It’s ten pages of single-spaced, double-sided research on the rise of heroes two hundred years ago. His father skims it with barely a fraction of the attention Izuku put into it (six hours straight of work without break). When his father reaches the end, he drops it onto the desk and leans back into his seat.

 

“Wrong,” he says. “It’s all wrong.”

 

Izuku tenses. “Most of it came directly from dot-gov or dot-edu sites.”

 

“And you trusted them?”

 

“I didn’t see a reason not to.”

 

Father chuckles and taps his fingers against the desk. “I see. Well, there isn’t a better time to learn the reasons than today, is there? Sit down. We’ll start now.”

 

Izuku sits down and listens.

 

“Heroes were created for a single purpose. Propaganda.” Father stands up and begins slowly pacing the perimeter of the room. “When quirks developed, society feared them. Those with quirks were ostracized, considered something less than human. When people started using their quirks, no matter the reason, they were called criminals. And then villain when the term criminal wasn’t harsh enough. A group of quirk-holders in America took the law into their own hands, fighting criminal quirk-holders. Are you taking notes?”

 

Izuku is. As soon as Father said we’ll start now Izuku pulled out his phone and started a document. “Yes, Father.”

 

“Good. Of the couple hundred vigilantes in America, seven were pardoned by the government and labelled Heroes. The rest were incarcerated. After that, other nations began hand-picking Heroes out of their quirk-holders, as well. This, in effect, left the conflict only within quirks, further isolating them from those without. Any questions?”

 

Izuku racks his brain for a question because he knows, if he doesn’t ask one, it’ll look like he wasn’t paying attention. “Why only seven?” he blurts out. “Of the original vigilantes, why were only seven pardoned?”

 

Father stops pacing and clasps his hands behind his back. “Why do you think?”

 

Izuku licks his lips and stares at his phone, brain churning through the little bit of information he has. The only theory that really sticks out is, “Propaganda. They were the only ones good enough to be shown in public.”

 

“Exactly!” Father answers with a smile, returning to pacing. “Those seven had the best quirks, the best backgrounds, and were the most physically appealing. The other two hundred fifty-eight didn't cut it. Before Japan could adopt heroes, they had their own set of vigilantes. Do you know who I’m talking about?”

 

“No.”

 

“It’s rumoured their leader had a quirk quite similar to mine, in fact. It’s the reason I’m so knowledgeable on this subject.”

 

Izuku subconsciously sits up a little straighter, intrigued.

 

“Rumours say he was able to give and take quirks. He, like the vigilantes in America, attempted to bring order to Japan where there was none. The government responded by labelling him a villain and recruiting Heroes--” Father puts air-quotes around the word “--to take him out. You know why?”

 

Izuku searches for the answer for only a moment. “He was a threat?”

 

“Yup! They were afraid of his power, even though he was trying to do the right thing. And heroes, ever since, have been in the spotlight as these perfect peace-keepers. But, do you something, Izuku?”

 

Izuku raises his head to see Father looking straight at him. “No?”

 

“Heroes wouldn’t exist without villains.” Father gives Izuku a moment to write it down, so he does. Word for word. The quote stares up at him, black on white, until Father speaks again and Izuku blinks. “And without heroes, society will crumble. Without their symbols of hope, they’d have nothing. Without villains, there would be no conflict for our society to be built around.” Father pauses before continuing. “Have you heard of Georg Simmel, Izuku?”

 

“No, Father.”

 

“A shame. Write the name down, find a research article or two. Be prepared to explain his relation to this discussion to me by dinner tomorrow.”

 

“Yes, Father.”

 

“Any questions?”

 

“Just...” Izuku begins, fidgeting a bit. Father frowns so he stills. “You’re saying that villains exist for the good of society?”

 

Father watches Izuku with a blank face as he states, “Of course. Villains are just the other side of the heroes’ coin.”

 

 

“So, Georg Simmel,” Father says over dinner, setting his chopsticks down.

 

Izuku sits up, clasps his hands together, and swallows before starting. “Georg Simmel was a sociologist of the early twentieth century. His perspective on conflict theory is that a society has the strongest bonds when it has an enemy.”

 

Father nods so Izuku continues.

 

“If villains didn’t exist, our society wouldn’t have a common enemy, and there would be nothing to unite us.”

 

Father smiles. “Exactly. You understand. Villains hold our society together. After the discovery of quirks, society was weak and quirks became the enemy. Villains stepped up and people slowly stopped fearing the quirks, but instead a small group of the people who hold them.”

 

Izuku scrunches up his nose.

 

“Do you have a question, Izuku?”

 

“Well, if the only problem was that quirks weren’t normalized yet, then isn’t the problem solved?”

 

Father frowns and sighs. “Society relies on villains, now. If you take away that crutch, society will have nothing to fear or hate so it’ll turn in on itself. You’ll start seeing homophobia, transphobia, racism, xenophobia, and more. Society will start to fear and hate itself. We need villains just as much as we need heroes, if not more.”

 

 

 

 

Present Day

 

 

“So,” Father begins. “You’re serious about becoming a hero.”

 

“I am,” Izuku answers, ignoring his rapid heartbeats.

 

“I just have one question,” Father says. He hasn’t sat down yet, which is a bad sign. If they sit down, they could pretend this is a normal conversation. But with Father still standing, this is an interrogation.

 

“Yes?”

 

“Why? ” He shoots the question like a bullet, and it hits Izuku with just as much impact.

 

Why?

 

What kind of question is that?

 

Izuku is nowhere near prepared enough to talk about this. He had wanted to bring it up on his terms, to prepare a speech with evidence and rhetoric. But, right now, he has nothing. He’s unarmed.

 

“Heroes are just as important as villains, Father,” he improvises.

 

Father doesn’t react. “Anyone can become a hero, Izuku. The world doesn’t need any more.”

 

“Are you telling me to become a villain?” Izuku asks, hoping it’s direct enough to draw Father’s interest.

 

“No,” Father responds dryly. He doesn't catch the bait. “I’m not telling you to do anything. I’m just trying to understand.”

 

Izuku believes that as much he believes everything else that his father says.

 

Not at all.

 

“Why? ”  Father asks with that same biting intonation, like the word itself could hurt Izuku.

 

And it can, because Izuku doesn’t think he’ll ever be able to answer it to his father’s standards.

 

Izuku knows his answer. He wants to become a hero to save those who can’t save themselves, to protect others from the dangers of the world.

 

But Izuku also knows that answer won’t satiate his father.

 

His father only cares about the balance, about the idea that heroes and villains are the same.

 

So, Izuku needs a different answer.

 

“The hero industry is corrupt,” Izuku starts carefully.

 

“Of course it is.”

 

“Maybe... I think I can fix it from the inside.”

 

The weight of Father’s silence is so heavy Izuku can barely breathe.

 

“I—“ Izuku starts again to fill the silence.

 

“Izuku,” Father cuts in, “do you understand how much work that would entail? You know just as well as I do how broken the system is. You saw Endeavor up close.”

 

Izuku doesn’t question how Father knows he encountered Endeavor. It could be a quirk. He could have bugged Izuku’s phone. Izuku doesn’t care right now. It’s the least of his worries.

 

“If I don’t, who will?” Izuku asks.

 

Father rolls his shoulders, widens his stance, and stands up taller. “And what exactly is one person going to change?”

 

“U.A. has four schools: hero, support, business, and general education. There, I’ll be able to make ample connections with support and business students, which will be invaluable for my future."

 

“Do you have a plan?” Father asks, voice laced with disbelief.

 

He doesn’t. Everything he’s been saying is complete improvisation.

  

“Of course I do,” Izuku lies. “I can send you a document overview by tomorrow night.”

 

“Please do. And I expect it to make your case.”

 

“It does.” It will.

 

 

Izuku bullshits a paper in two hours, flat. His experience writing essays for Father under ungodly time constraints means he can write an essay about anything within hours, whether he has knowledge on the subject or not.

 

A paper on a subject he's actually knowledgeable about? Easy.

 

“It’s good enough, for now,” Father says over dinner. “We’ll have to work on a firmer, more permanent plan when you get closer to graduating from U.A.”

 

Izuku’s eyes widen. “U.A.?”

 

“Of course. However, I have three conditions. Primarily, you must let me know where you are at all times. Text is fine. Second, don’t get hurt. I retain the authority to pull you out if I fear you have been placed in danger. Lastly, but definitely not the least, you will continue completing my assignments in a timely manner. I expect you to do both my and U.A.’s homework to the best of your abilities. Is this acceptable?”

 

“Yes, Father.”

 

Even if it wasn’t, Izuku couldn’t say no.

 

- - -

 

Midoriya Hisashi is... complicated.

 

Toshinori can’t think of a better word to describe his successor’s father.

 

When Midoriya had said his father was injured, Toshinori was nowhere near prepared for the extent. The man is just as broken as or possibly even more than Toshinori himself. The entire top half of his head is scar tissue and he has to breath through a respirator a third of the time. And that’s just what Toshinori knows from his fifteen minute visit.

 

Hisashi had been pleasant enough, but something about the entire encounter felt... tense.

 

Then again, it’s not like Toshinori meets up with the parent of his successor every day.

 

He’s probably overreacting.

 

At least Toshinori can place Midoriya’s smell, now. Antiseptic and cleaning supplies. Their house might as well be a hospital with how clean it looks and smells.

 

The lack of personal decoration had been a tad disconcerting at first, but Toshinori writes it off as either cleanliness or a distrust of strangers. They very well could keep their photographs further in the house.

 

The only other feature Toshinori notes from the Midoriya household is the books.

 

They have so, so many books.

 

Every shelf is stuffed with them. The tops of every dresser is stacked high with paper-backs, hard covers, and even leather-bounds. Under the television, where one might find a gaming system, is instead more books.

 

It’s like they ran out of space and turned to storing books wherever they can.

 

Toshinori finds it endearing and, along with the hospital-like smell, one more personal factoid he knows about Midoriya.

 

Because, no matter how much they talk, Midoriya never seems to really say anything about himself.

Chapter Text

“In six months you cleared almost twice the area I assigned! Congratulations, Midoriya-kun! You’re now ready for my quirk!”

 

They both stand in the center of the area Izuku has cleared. Izuku smiles up at him. Yagi smiles back and plucks a strand of hair from his head.

 

“Eat this.”

 

Izuku raises an eyebrow. Not what he had been expecting. Father’s transfers just require physical contact but, then again, Yagi does have a different quirk.

 

Izuku takes the piece of hair and swallows it. It’s extremely uncomfortable. Moments after, his throat still remembers the awkward sensation.

 

“Now!” Yagi announces. “You still have some time, yes? Let’s get ice cream!”

 

“Before dinner?” Izuku asks.

 

Yagi laughs and the sound is so happy it tears down any restraints Izuku has. “Why not? We’re celebrating!”

 

Ice cream. Before dinner. Without his father’s permission.

 

“Sure!” Izuku exclaims.

 

 

Yagi takes him to a small ice cream parlor halfway between the beach and Izuku’s house. The brightly colored sign reads Frozen Delights and More and the window displays plastic, intricate desert replicas that almost look real.

 

“This is one of my favorite places to eat,” Yagi says as they enter. The little bell above the door dings. “They’re extremely accommodating to diets and allergies. It’s probably the healthiest dessert place you’ll find in the city, if not the entire country.”

 

“Wow,” Izuku responds, honestly impressed.

 

The interior of the store is just as colorful as the outside. A collage of random pictures cover every inch of the wall. Izuku sees everything from a cat to a hero to a newspaper clipping to a pie chart to a child’s crayon drawing. Along with the couches and plush seating, the place has a casual, inviting atmosphere.

 

“Welcome! Oh--Yagi-san!” the barista, an older woman with bright neon pink hair, announces with a kind smile, waving emphatically at them. “Who’d you bring with you?”

 

“Ah, Yuuma-san, this is Midoriya-kun, my...” Yagi drifts off with a cringe.

 

Izuku steps up to the counter with a smile and extended hand.

 

“I’m his nephew,” Izuku says as Yuuma shakes his hand. “My parents are out of town so Toshinori is looking after me for a couple days.”

 

“Really? I didn’t know you had such a cute nephew, Yagi-san!” Yuuma exclaims. “You should have brought him in sooner!”

 

Yagi just blinks, mouth agape a tad, and stares at Izuku.

 

“I’ve been really busy with high school applications, recently,” Izuku continues, smile unwavering. “He’s been suggesting it for a while but I haven’t had the time until today.”

 

Yuuma nods. “No, no, dear. Don’t worry about it. High school is extremely important. So, what can I get for you?”

 

“Oh, goodness gracious,” Izuku begins with a light laugh, taking in the three boards worth of menu behind her. “I have no idea.”

 

Yuuma’s smile makes Izuku think that’s her intention. “Well, let’s start cutting things off. Any dietary restrictions?”

 

“Not particularly? But I don’t eat sweet things very often so something lighter would probably be better.”

 

“We could go with a sherbert or sorbet,” she offers, tapping her chin and staring off into the distance. “Or shaved ice.”

 

“Shaved ice sounds good. What flavors do you have?”

 

A light dances across her eyes. “All of them.”

 

Izuku swallows. “All of them. I-I see. How about you pick something for me and I hope I like it? Yeah, that sounds good.”

 

She laughs. “I’m joking with you, dear. Here’s a list.” She hands him a piece of paper with over two dozen flavors on it. Izuku scans it until he finds one in particular.

 

“Mint?” he asks.

 

“Yup! You want that?”

 

“Please. Thank you.”

 

“Yagi-san, you want your regular, I’m guessing?”

 

After a moment, Yagi replies with a delayed, “Huh? Oh, yes. Sorry.”

 

Yagi is pink, but his color shifts erratically. Concern, with underlying confusion.

 

What does he have to be concerned and confused about?

 

Yuuma turns from the counter to make their orders, so Izuku steps closer to Yagi. “Are you okay?” he asks quietly.

 

Yagi smiles at him, but his aura doesn’t change. “Of course, my boy. I’m perfectly fine.”

 

Izuku doesn’t push the subject, yet.

 

- - -

 

Midoriya lied.

 

Just--like that. So easily with that same smile on his face that Toshinori has seen countless times before. Toshinori doesn’t know what it means.

 

It’s a small lie, really, just a white lie. But it’s not the content that matters, it’s the fact that he did it at all.

 

“Yagi-san?” Midoriya asks. “Are you sure you’re alright?”

 

Toshinori nods his head and returns to reality. Midoriya sounds concerned enough--no--Midoriya is concerned. Midoriya is his successor, the boy who ran head-first towards a villain to save his classmate. That’s who Midoriya is. “I am. Just... a bit distracted, is all.”

 

See? That’s a lie, Toshinori. How is that any different?

 

Midoriya doesn’t look at all convinced.

 

Maybe it feels different because Midoriya was totally, completely convincing. Maybe it’s because, for half a second, Toshinori questioned whether or not he actually was Midoriya’s uncle. Maybe Toshinori is worried because Midoriya didn’t even hesitate before lying.

 

“I was asking if your hours are going to change now that we’ve done the... transfer.”

 

Toshinori swallows and tries to bury his stupid paranoid conspiracy theories. All Midoriya did was cover Toshinori’s own fuck-up. That’s the fact. “Yes, they will. By the end of this month I’ll be working half the time I used to and by the start of next school year, I’ll only really be on-call.”

 

“Are you okay with that?” Midoriya asks, idly stirring his shaved ice.

 

Toshinori shrugs. He won’t be doing hero work as much as he is used to, but teaching at U.A. should keep him busy, at least. “I don’t really have a choice.”

 

Midoriya pouts. “I can’t imagine you’ll survive sitting around at home all day.”

 

Toshinori tries to chuckle, but it sounds fake even to his own ears. “Yeah, me neither.”

 

“Maybe you could get a new job? Something that doesn’t require your quirk?”

 

Toshinori wonders where this train of conversation is going. He knows he shouldn’t tell anyone he’s teaching at U.A. next semester. But... is he really going to lie here and now? Set that example? Toshinori swallows and glances up at Midoriya, who watches him with calm, waiting eyes.

 

“I--“ Toshinori starts, then stops, clamping his jaw shut. Before he can talk convince himself not to, he blurts out, “I’m teaching at U.A.”

 

Midoriya’s eyes light up like Toshinori just admitted to being Santa Claus. “Really?” Midoriya asks, with that smile on his face that--no, Toshinori can definitely, 100% trust it. “That’s amazing! Would you be teaching any of my classes?”

 

“Most likely, yes. I don’t know much yet, but I do know I’ll be teaching some hero course classes.”

 

“Awesome!”

 

- - -

 

Izuku fucked up, somewhere.

 

Toshinori’s aura is shifting between pink and lime, now, which Izuku recognizes all too well from Katsuki’s aura.

 

Distrust.

 

He doesn’t know what he did wrong, which is the worst part. He flips through his memories for anything that could have made Yagi lose trust in him, but he can’t find anything and he’s afraid to ask Yagi because then it’ll become real. Because even though he (probably, maybe) trusts Yagi, there’s always the fear that Yagi will throw the accusation back to him, that it will become a Conversation.

 

Izuku despises Conversations.

 

In his family, Conversations are different from conversations. “Conversations” are high-speed battles of wit and charisma and passive aggression and sarcasm where one wrong word means a loss.

 

And a loss means a punishment.

 

But oftentimes, winning is worse.

 

Izuku despises Conversations, so he doesn’t ask Yagi what he did wrong. Yagi doesn’t bring it up, anyways, so it can’t be that bad.

 

Right?

 

- - -

 

All for One feels the transfer of One for All happening from across the city.

 

It’s slow. It isn’t incredibly efficient. But by this time tomorrow, Izuku will have enough of the quirk to call it his own.

 

All for One feels like celebrating.

 

One for All is finally back in the family, where it belongs.

 

 

“What are you doing?” are the first words out of Izuku’s mouth, which All for One supposes is justified.

 

“We’re celebrating!” All for One announces from the kitchen, where he’s been attempting to make Inko’s infamous chocolate chip cookies for the past two hours and failing miserably.

 

“Are you... cooking?” Izuku asks with a raised eyebrow.

 

“Baking, actually. Inko’s cookies that, I guess, are yours now. It isn’t really working out.”

 

Over two hundred years of being alive and All for One never took the time to learn how to bake, or do anything kitchen-related, honestly. He tried, once, over a hundred years ago, but it ended with him getting frustrated and literally burning the entire culinary school to the ground. He hasn’t tried since.

 

“I can see that. What are we celebrating?”

 

All for One smirks and rinses the flour off his hands. “Why don’t you tell me, Izuku?”

 

All for One feels Izuku tense, the muscles in his body going rigid, and wishes for the umpteenth time that he could see what expression he’s making. It’s probably carefully neutral, but if Izuku has kept any tells from when he was younger, his smile is too tight and he’s flaring his nostrils.

 

“Why don’t you let me finish the cookies?” Izuku counters, already stepping into the kitchen and rolling up his sleeves. “I’ll make them just like Mom did.”

 

All for One tries not to react to the casual title-drop. All for One himself never gets anything other than Father and it’s impossible not to be offended by the Mom Inko gets. Izuku has never even met the woman! She’s dead!

 

“You do that,” All for One begins, ridding himself of the half-scorched apron. “But while you do, tell me why we’re celebrating.”

 

“I don't know why you’re celebrating, Father. I just got home.”

 

“I’m sure you can at least make a guess.”

 

“I’m not comfortable guessing.”

 

All for One frowns. “Are you really going to ruin my day like this, Izuku? And it was going so well.”

 

Izuku doesn’t respond for a moment, distracting himself with cleaning up from All for One's mess. “I apologize that my reluctance to make a guess without any evidence is ruining your day,” Izuku states with measured cadence.

 

“Don’t contort your words like that. I know you’re trying to manipulate me.”

 

Izuku lets out a breath through gritted teeth. “I have no intentions of--“

 

“You’re doing it again. All I wanted was to celebrate you finishing your training but no, you have to go and make everything into an argument, because you’re Izuku.”

 

“Father--”

 

“No. I’m done. You make your cookies or whatever. I’m going to my office to work. Don’t disturb me.”

 

- - -

 

Izuku despises Conversations.

 

- - -

 

Izuku gets One for All that night.

 

It wakes All for One up with a lightning bolt of energy jolting through his body.

 

Immediately after, All for One notices something else.

 

Empathy is gone. No, not quite gone. He can still feel an echo of it, quiet and weak, hidden underneath One for All.

 

It’s almost like...

 

No, that’s impossible, right?

 

- - -

 

“Izuku?” All for One asks over breakfast. “You still have Empathy, right?”

 

Izuku manages not to be surprised by the question. “Of course. Why?”

 

“No reason.”

 

Izuku only has one quirk. All for One is sure of it. Even if he still has the functions of Empathy, he doesn’t have the quirk anymore. He only has One for All.

 

Which means...

 

“Give me your hand.”

 

Izuku does flinch, this time. His chopsticks bounce against the edge of his bowl. “Why?”

 

All for One doesn’t answer the question, instead tilting his chin up and extending his hand.

 

The safest quirk is Regeneration, All for One knows. Even if it backfires, it will still try to heal him.

 

Izuku, after a moment, reaches out, leaving his hand a couple inches above All for One's. All for One calls Regeneration to his fingertips, and places his hand on Izuku’s.

 

Izuku receives Regeneration without complaint. It’s nothing like the Nomus. The transfer goes so smoothly it could rival All for One's own receival, which doesn’t make sense because the purpose of his quirk is to take others. But Regeneration leaves All for One with no resistance, finding an easy residence in Izuku’s own quirk factor.

 

“W-what?” Izuku asks, slowly withdrawing his hand, not hiding his surprise. “That... shouldn’t be possible.”

 

Regeneration disappears almost immediately. Just like Empathy, all that remains within Izuku is One for All.

 

One for All ate them.

 

- - -

 

Izuku has three quirks. At the same time. One for All and Empathy, he can understand. Yagi told him One for All is some sort of stockpiling quirk, that it’s safe to use with another. But a third?

 

“What did you give me?” Izuku asks, voice cracking despite his best efforts.

 

Father withdraws his hand and smiles. “Why don’t we test it? I’m excited to see if it responds differently under these circumstances. Get a knife, would you, please? The utility one should work.”

 

Izuku stands up. His mind is completely blank.

 

“Oh, and meet me in the bathroom. I don’t want to stain the table.”

 

He doesn’t want to. Izuku doesn’t want to but Father is already moving and he knows what happens if he refuses.

 

Izuku takes the knife out of the block and walks to the bathroom, focusing more on trying not to shake than the walk itself.

 

 

“Less than five seconds,” Father states without hiding his glee, “and it’s already scarred. Impressive.”

 

Izuku still holds the knife. Blood drips from the blade and lands on the thin, pale scar that had formed on his thigh before his eyes.

 

“This is good data,” Father continues through his oxygen mask. He leans against the door, blocking the only exit. “When I had it, without any other healing quirks it took at least a day to get a wound of that level to scar.”

 

Izuku barely hears him, entranced by the red liquid pooling around him onto the floor of the shower.

 

“You did good, Izuku,” Father says quietly and it almost sounds honest.

 

Almost.

 

“I’ll give you Pull, in a couple days, as a gift.”

 

And then he’s gone.
Notes:

    In summary of the last bit, Hisashi “tests” Izuku’s Regeneration by having Izuku cut himself and time how long it takes to heal. When Hisashi had Regeneration, it took a day for an injury of that level to scar, but it only took five seconds for Izuku. Hisashi praises Izuku and tells him he’ll give him Pull later, “as a gift.”

    That was a heavy chapter, goodness gracious! The entire fic won’t be this dark, don’t worry! Izuku will have a chance to be happy, too.

Chapter Text

Izuku would have arrived an hour early to the exam, but Yagi had purposefully delayed him, so now he only has fifteen minutes until it starts.

 

Katsuki leans against the wall surrounding UA, idly browsing his phone and tapping one of his feet emphatically against the pavement.

 

“Yo,” Izuku greets with a small smile and wave.

 

Katsuki huffs and pushes off the wall, simultaneously pocketing his phone in a fluid motion. “You’re late,” he grunts out.

 

“Sorry,” Izuku responds with an awkward chuckle, rubbing the back of his neck. “You didn’t have to wait for me, you know.”

 

“My dad insisted.” Katsuki’s almost constant lime of distrust is overlayed by flickers of yellow. Uncertainty. He turns away from Izuku to U.A. and grumbles, “You don’t have to be fake around me."

 

Izuku skips up to Katsuki’s side and says, “I’m never fake, Kachan!”

 

Katsuki rolls his eyes. “Sure you aren’t.”

 

Then, Izuku trips on a loose brick.

 

He never reaches the ground.

 

“I’m so sorry!” someone exclaims as Izuku is righted to his feet. All his weight comes back in a single moment. “I used my quirk without asking. I’m super sorry! I just didn’t want you to fall. It would be really bad luck right before the exam, right?”

 

A student just a little bit shorter than Izuku with a brown bob stands before him, wringing her hands in a nervous gesture.

 

“There’s no need to apologize,” Izuku says with a soft smile. “I should be thanking you, actually.”

 

She blushes before exclaiming, “Ah! Well, I should be going! Don’t want to be late! Good luck!” Then she runs off.

 

“God,” Katsuki snorts, “did you seriously fucking flirt at her?”

 

“I have no idea what you’re talking about, Kachan.”

 

- - -

 

“You’re allowed to cheat unless I catch you doing it,” the proctor--Eraserhead, he isn’t even trying to hide it; he’s literally wearing his hero costume--announces. “Make sure none of your electrical devices go off. Or, if they do, that I don’t hear them. If you use your quirk I’ll know about it, so don’t. Use a number two pencil if you want your answers to be scored. If you don’t want your answers to be scored, leave now and stop wasting my time. Is all of that clear?”

 

When no one says anything, Eraserhead begins walking through the aisles dropping paper folders on their desks. “Don’t open it yet. I’ll tell you when it’s time. You can fill out the back. It’s just your name and information. If you have any questions, ask now. I won’t be able to answer them during the test.” He drops the folder on Izuku’s own desk as Izuku mutters out an almost-silent thank you.

 

 

The written test is almost suspiciously easy. Save for two or three obviously trick questions, Izuku answers them all with ease. The written response portion isn’t as engaging as he had hoped. The questions are all ones Izuku has seen before, like, Please explain the history of quirks and Who is your favorite hero and why? He answers Eraserhead--not because Eraserhead is his favorite hero, but because Izuku can write the most impressive essay on Eraserhead. Eraserhead is a cult, little-known hero. Just by name-dropping him, Izuku can already raise his application above the average. Also, someone will likely be able to connect Izuku’s exam with his proctor--Eraserhead himself. Izuku doesn’t write it outright in his short essay, but he hopes someone will catch the fact that he recognized Eraserhead. Finally, Izuku has mountains of theories on Eraserhead. Well, he has theories on every hero, but nothing about Eraserhead has ever been verified, so Izuku can show off his analysis skills, as well.

 

To write about Eraserhead is a careful, tactical decision.

 

By the time Izuku finishes the entire exam, he’s only a third of the way through the time allotted for the test. Even after triple-checking all his answers and rewriting most of his short essays, he still has an hour left.

 

His hand is in the air for two whole minutes before Eraserhead comes over.

 

“What?” Eraserhead grunts. “I said no questions.”

 

“Ah. It isn’t about the test, actually. I was wondering if I’m allowed to leave once I’ve finished.”

 

Eraserhead‘s eyes widen minutely. “What, did you guess on all the questions?”

 

“No. And I checked all my answers, as well.”

 

He huffs. “You’ll have to sit here, silently, until the testing session is finished.”

 

Izuku smiles and nods. “Alrighty. Thank you.”

 

 

Izuku sits in silence for the remaining hour until Eraserhead dismisses them all to the large auditorium.

 

The assigned seating places him next to Katsuki, who only grunts in acknowledgement.

 

“How’d your test go?” Izuku asks him.

 

“Fine.” Katsuki scowls. “It was too fucking easy. The essays were annoying as shit, though. I hate timed writing.”

 

Izuku nods. “The trick is you outline first—“

 

Katsuki rolls his eyes and Izuku would continue, but then Present Mic struts up to the podium.

 

“Examinees!” Present Mic yells into the microphone which, accompanied with his quirk, results in a high-pitched squeal. Present Mic mutters under his breath (but it’s still modulated by the microphone), “That happens every time!” He clears his throat and continues, “Welcome to the U.A. entrance exam! Everybody say hey!”

 

Nobody says hey.

 

“Wow, tough crowd. No worry! That won’t stop me! Now, you should have grabbed a pamphlet outlining the practical portion of the exam on your way in. I’m going to go over it anyways!”

 

The screens behind him light up, and simple animations help him throughout his speech.

 

 

Partway through Present Mic’s explanation, a student just a few rows in front of Izuku shoots his hand in the air.

 

“Yes, Examinee twenty-one oh-two?” Present Mic says.

 

The student jumps to his feet and, during his entire questioning, chops his hands through the air in robotic-esque movements. “This pamphlet includes a list of no less than four robots. However, you have only addressed three. If this is a mistake of U.A.’s, I will be incredibly disappointed. Do you care to explain?” The student announces, sounding more like a lawyer a teenager.

 

Izuku had also noticed the same thing, but was waiting to see if Present Mic was going to address it or not before bringing it up.

 

“That’s a good observation!” Present Mic answers cheerfully, unperturbed by the interruption. “In fact, that fourth robot is not an opponent, but more like a road block. It’s worth zero points. If you come across it, there’s no point in fighting it. It just takes up time and space. Does that answer your question?”

 

“Yes! Thank you!”

 

 

Katsuki and Izuku are separated for the practical exam, which doesn’t surprise Izuku but annoys Katsuki to a dull orange.

 

“This is stupid,” Katsuki grumbles as they all file out of the auditorium.

 

“They’re afraid that if we’re in the same arena, we’ll work together, Kachan. It makes perfect sense.”

 

Katsuki just huffs out through his nose. “Like you need my help.”

 

“Well, then why do you want us to be in the same arena?”

 

Katsuki never answers the question, instead using an excuse about finding his testing location to escape. Not like it matters. Izuku knows the answer, anyway. Katsuki is just as lime as he ever is.

 

Izuku wonders if Katsuki will ever trust him.

 

 

There are twenty of them to one arena. In Izuku’s arena are both the girl who saved him from falling, who has some sort of anti-gravity quirk, and the boy who interrupted Present Mic’s explanation who, based on the unusual fit of his pants, has a mutation quirk in his legs. Most of the students distance themselves from each other to do their independent warm-up techniques.

 

Present Mic said they have around five minutes between arrival and the start of the exam.

 

Five minutes is more than enough.

 

“Hello, everybody!” Izuku announces to the crowd with the brightest tone and expression he can manage. He waves and makes eye-contact with everyone who looks his way. The only person who waves back is the gravity girl. “We have roughly five minutes until the exam starts. I was hoping we could go around and state our names and quirks!”

 

“The fuck? Why?” one of the closer students asks.

 

“There’s nothing in the rules against forming alliances,” Izuku answers.

 

- - -

 

“There are two types of battles. Those you can win by talking through them, and those you can’t," Father always says.

 

As soon as Present Mic had announced they’d be fighting robots, Izuku was afraid this battle would have to be the latter.

 

Then, Izuku remembered there are other examinees.

 

- - -

 

“What do you mean, alliances?” someone else hisses.

 

“I mean,” Izuku begins, finding as many eyes as he can, which is easy because he has everyone’s attention now. “We all work together to get the highest scores possible.”

 

“We’re opponents, dude. Sorry, but it’s not going to happen.”

 

“I think that’s a great idea!” the girl who saved him earlier announces, jogging over to him and extending her hand. “My name’s Uraraka! I can make anything I touch zero-gravity!”

 

Izuku shakes her hand. “I’m Midoriya,” he says loud enough for everyone to hear. “My quirk is Pull. I can telepathically draw things towards me. I’m also exceptionally strong, although that isn’t quirk-related.”

 

He could, maybe, try and explain Multi-Quirk, the new cover for the mess Father has caused, but that comes with too many variables.

 

Uraraka giggles. “It’s nice to meet you, Midoriya-kun!”

 

“I suppose you are correct,” the boy who interrupted Present Mic announces, adjusting his glasses. “It technically isn’t against the rules. However, I do not see how it would benefit us, as it would also increase the scores of the people who we are working against.”

 

“Think about it like this,” Izuku begins, turning towards him. “Let’s say I would, on my own, naturally get twenty points, which isn’t enough to get in. With a team, I instead get fifty. Although most everyone else in this arena also gets fifty, the average of the other arenas will remain twenty. That means a majority of people from this arena pass, rather than other arenas. Does that make sense?”

 

"So your argument is that working as a team would increase our individual scores in relation to testers in other arenas?"

 

"Exactly! Have you ever heard of coopertition? It's collaboration in the face of competition. Essentially, nothing is saying we can't work together while still being opponents."

 

The boy blinks for a couple seconds before almost yelling, “My name is Iida, Midoriya-san! As I cannot find any fault in your logic, I will form an alliance with you and Uraraka-san! I have engines on the back of my legs that allow me to run extremely fast!”

 

After that, everyone else falls in line.

 

 

“Okay, so,” Izuku says, looking over the groupings before him. "Uraraka, you're going to get Hano and Anda to a high place as soon as possible. The next group is Iori, Tamasa, and Kurenai. You all have range, but not as much control, so try to distance yourselves from everyone else as much as possible."

 

“Will do, boss!” Kurenai exclaims. They twirl in place and snap their fingers into a pair of finger guns. “Tamasa and I will do our explody stuff with Iori’s back-up.”

 

“Great. Saza-chan and Kobo-kun, your group is even more volatile, so please be as careful as possible.”

 

“Oi,” Saza responds, crossing her arms and furrowing her eyebrows. “That’s literally my entire purpose. We’ll be fine, weirdo.”

 

“I’m just double-checking everything, Saza-chan. Hotari-kun and Kamon-kun, you both know what to do.”

 

“Yup!” Hotari replies as Kamon simultaneously says, “Of course!”

 

“Koizumi-chan, you do you.”

 

“Wouldn’t have it any other way!”

 

“Hitamoro-kun, Uchiro-kun, Maeno-chan, and Nakagawa-chan, you all are closer combat, so please be careful. And someone have an eye on Hitamoro at all times. If they get injured at all, pull them out.”

 

“I’m not a child, Midoriya. I can take care of myself,” Hitamoro complains.

 

Izuku just rolls his eyes. "Moving on, we have Iida, Suda, and Wakita. Iida-kun, watch your corners. Suda-kun, don’t overuse your quirk. Wakita-chan, don’t forget you have other limbs, too.”

 

“Yes, Midoriya-kun!” Iida exclaims as Suda throws a thumbs up and Wakita says, “I won’t!”

 

Before Izuku can cover the last group, the intercom buzzes to life. “This is it, everyone! Go, go, go! The exam has started!” Present Mic announces.

 

Only after a couple seconds does anyone move.

 

 

Ochako runs through the exam with Anda and—aw, darn it, Ochako’s already forgotten his name. She knows his quirk, though, Metal Discharge, and his hair is this pretty silver color, so she thinks that’s enough information. Anda and Silver aren’t her teammates for the entire exam, but Midoriya tasked her with getting them to the top of the tallest building as quickly as she can, so they run. They run past robots and past other students, not wasting any time.

 

“There!” Anda exhales, stumbling to a halt. She points to a building just a couple blocks away. “That one!”

 

It’s definitely the tallest building Ochako can see, and if they’ve estimated the size of the arena accurately, it is in a central location.

 

“Looks good to me!” Silver notes with ease like they haven’t just run half a mile.

 

They start running without saying anything else, all of them fully aware of the rush Ochako is in. When they stop in front of the building, Silver asks with that same effortless tone, “How good is your aim, Uraraka?”

 

Ochako catches her breath, then pants out, “G-great.”

 

“I hope so.” Anda holds out her hand. “Please don’t throw me into the sun. I haven’t turned in this week’s homework yet. I’d hate for my last grade to be an F.”

 

“There’s a ceiling, don’t worry,” Ochako answers with a weak smile, grabbing Anda’s hand and activating her quirk.

 

“That really doesn’t make me feel any better.”

 

“Too bad!” Ochako yells. She lightly tosses Anda at the building, who hits it with light oomph and latches onto the closest windowsill.

 

“You ready?” Ochako asks Silver.

 

“Always.”

 

Soon, Silver is with Anda on the side of the building.

 

“Don’t take it too fast!” Ochako calls through cupped hands. “You’ll start getting nauseous!”

 

It takes them less than thirty seconds to propel themselves to the space above the roof. Ochako drops them the short distance to the roof.

 

“You good?!” she yells up.

 

“Yes, ma’am!” Silver calls. “Now get going to your real job. We’re set here.”

 

Ochako waves up even though she can barely see that far before running back the way they came.

 

- - -

 

“How is Uraraka-chan going to find us?” Dokuro asks in between prying the arm off a one-pointer and using it to beat a two-pointer to death.

 

“I told her we’d be between her and the entrance,” Izuku answers as he carefully Pulls the chip with the three-pointer’s programming out of its delicate positioning. The three-pointer loses power immediately.

 

Dokuro frowns and then startles. Without warning he chucks the arm at something behind Izuku and says with a smirk, “Two-pointer.”

 

“Thanks.”

 

Uraraka jogs up with a group of four three-pointers chasing behind her. “M-Midoriya!” She yells with a wide smile. “I brought you both gifts!”

 

“Oh, hell yeah!” Dokuro exclaims. “Do the thing, Uraraka!” Dokuro runs up to meet her halfway. “Toss me!”

 

Without hesitation, even though neither of them have practiced the move before, Uraraka grabs Dokuro by his arm, simultaneously activating her quirk so Dokuro goes weightless, and swings him once around like a baseball bat before flinging him at the hoarde. At some point, Dokuro had gotten another piece of robot, and he now wields it like a club.

 

“Aw yeah! Drop me!” Dokuro screeches seconds before hurtling into the robots. Uraraka drops her quirk’s hold on him and he hits them improvised-club first with more than enough momentum to send all four of them to the ground.

 

After a moment, Dokuro pushes himself to his feet, relatively unharmed. “That was the best, Uraraka! Like a roller coaster but a million times better! Let’s do it again!”

 

“Yeah! I’m super happy it worked out! Usually, my quirk makes people nauseous, so I never get to use it like this.”

 

“Internal Regulation, baby!” Dokuro exclaims, jogging over. “Temperature, pressure, everything you can think of. A little zero-g can’t hurt me.”

 

Izuku, just to be safe, Pulls the chips out of those four robots, as well.

 

“Let’s keep moving,” Izuku says, already scouting another road that looks to have more robots.

 

“Yeah!” Dokuro and Uraraka say simultaneously.

 

- - -

 

“Thank you for the save, Suda-san!” Tenya announces for what feels like the hundredth time. For what feels like the hundredth time, Suda responds with a small bow before turning back to the fight.

 

“How’s it going, Iida?” Wakita asks while simultaneously digging her fingers underneath the casing of a two-pointer, ripping it off, and tearing out a fistful of wires. The robot never stood a chance.

 

“Wonderful, Wakita-san! I think I’m somewhere around thirty, not taking into account points for assistances!”

 

“Suda?” Wakita asks as she jogs over to the next-nearest robot with the full intentions of tearing that one apart as well.

 

Tenya sees Suda nod out of his peripheral and hold up some fingers, but he’s too distracted by a three-pointer to try and figure out what they mean. If Tenya’s been paying as much attention as he thinks he has, Suda hasn’t said a single word this entire time.

 

“You know morse code, my guy?” Wakita yells over the sound of bending metal, which Tenya feels behind his teeth. Suda must respond because she continues, “Are you deaf? No? Mute? Or that other thing? Selective? Yeah? Cool!”

 

Tenya, in an attempt to drown out the terrible creaking, turns his engines back on to kick the head off the three-pointer.

 

“How about binary?”

 

Tenya can’t help but be impressed by Wakita’s multi-tasking skills. He can barely listen to her and fight at the same time, let alone speak himself.

 

“Not binary either? Darn. Uh, Iida-dude, you know any non-verbal languages? Sorry, Suda, but I don’t know sign.”

 

Tenya, after a moment of recollecting his bearings, grunts out, “No. Although, if we were not in the middle of a test I would be able to efficiently communicate through the text function of my phone.”

 

Wakita finishes with her robot and Tenya hears two different chuckles.

 

“Suda!” Wakita exclaims, turning towards him and away from a one-pointer.

 

Suda pulls her out of the way of the one-pointer's attack with impeccable timing and aim that can only be his quirk, Reflexes. Tenya had initially doubted the usefulness of Reflexes, especially when paired with two strength-heavy players like him and Wakita. But Suda has been keeping them both out of trouble every second of the way.

 

“You laughed!” Wakita says, completely ignoring the incident. “Your laugh is so cute!”

 

Tenya may not be able to understand what Suda is signing, but based on his furrowed eyebrows and exaggerated movements, Suda is probably chastising her.

 

“Please try to be more careful, Wakita-san,” Tenya tells her. “We shouldn’t make Suda-san use his quirk too much. He gets bad backlash, remember?”

 

“Yeah, yeah. Drop the san’s, Legs. We’re both the same age.”

 

“Legs? ” Tenya shrieks. “My name is Iida Tenya, if you’ve forgotten!”

 

“Suda agrees with me. Legs fits you much better.”

 

“Wha--!” Tenya would continue his rant, but he sees a one-pointer down another alleyway, and remembers they’re in the middle of an exam. “We should be getting a move on. We still need to score more points.”

 

- - -

 

“What in all twelve thousand episodes of One Piece is that?! ” Dokuro screams, falling to his knees as buildings collapse around them.

 

The hulking robot is bigger than the road. Every step it takes knocks down more and more buildings.

 

“That--that wasn’t in the pamphlet.”

 

But there’s a giant zero painted on its chest and Izuku knows it was. The zero-pointer. A road-block. That’s misleading advertising if Izuku’s ever heard it.

 

“Run,” Izuku tells Dokuro, who barely waits for the word to leave Izuku’s mouth to shoot off in the opposite direction.

 

Uraraka is standing a couple meters down, closer to the zero-pointer than either of them.

 

And then a building collapses and Izuku can only watch as a chunk of cement falls atop her.

 

It lands on her legs, but it's heavy and unwieldy and Izuku doesn’t think he’ll ever forget her cry of pain.

 

Izuku closes the distance between him and Uraraka with measured steps while simultaneously reaching out to the zero-pointer with Pull.

 

It has so many pieces and they’re all large but Izuku doesn’t care.

 

He needs to stop it.

 

“M-Midori—“ Uraraka whispers from underneath the wreckage. “I’m sorry.”

 

Izuku doesn't respond. He grabs the edge of the block with his hands as he takes hold of multiple pieces of the zero-pointer from yards away.

 

A bolt in its left knee.

 

A wire running down its spine.

 

The lense of its eye.

 

And then he Pulls the pieces with his quirk and pulls the block with his muscles as One for All courses through his body.

Chapter Text

“Oh?” Nedzu starts with a tone that Shouta nor none of the other teachers in the monitoring room can ignore. “That’s interesting.”

 

Interesting.

 

Everyone freezes. Conversations die mid-word. Not even All Might’s usual heavy breathing can be heard.

 

The practical exam hasn’t even started yet and Shouta’s already just one more cup of coffee away from a heart attack.

 

“They’re actually going to work together,” Nedzu says. He enlarges one of the ten feeds: Arena F.

 

“They’re cooperating?! ” Nemuri exclaims, shooting to her feet with such speed that she knocks her chair down. “That’s what you’re telling me, right?”

 

“Yes, it is.”

 

Before Nedzu can continue, Nemuri lets out a shriek. “Shouta! Shit, Shouta, you owe me two hundred bucks! Two hundred! ”

 

Shouta groans and sinks deeper into the couch in an attempt to ignore her cries.

 

“Remember?!” Nemuri yells, leaning over the back of the couch so her face is just inches away from Shouta’s. “Remember? The first time we proctored, you were all, no one’s gonna make use of Nedzu’s stupid loophole.” Her impression of him is terrible, but Hizashi still laughs, the traitor. “And I was like, oh, wanna bet? And then we did and now you owe me two hundred bucks!”

 

Shouta exhales through his nose. “Yes. I remember. Unfortunately.”

 

She squeals and claps her hands together. “Yes! This is great! The best year ever! ”

 

“It’s just two hundred,” Shouta groans like he isn’t living paycheck to paycheck.

 

“Just two hundred?! Just?! ”

 

“Kayama,” Nedzu says, silencing her. “I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I must ask you to quiet down.”

 

“Sorry, Nedzu.” She skips back to her own seat, still smiling.

 

“So,” Snipe begins. “They’re seriously working together.”

 

“Yes!” Nedzu exclaims. “I’ll turn on the audio.”

 

Normally, Nedzu is the only one with access to the audio of the ten arenas. The others don’t need it, as their only job is to ensure the examinees stay safe. All they need to do is watch the screens and be ready to interfere at a moment’s notice.

 

“Painless?” a short kid with fluffy, dark green hair says. Based on where he’s standing, a bit in front of the rest of the students of his arena, he’s taken some sort of leadership role. Shouta thinks he looks somewhat familiar, but doesn’t recognize him. “That sounds dangerous. You could seriously hurt yourself without even realizing it, Hitamoro-kun.”

 

“That’s the point,” a tall, lanky kid with glowing blue eyes snaps. “I’m the tank. No matter how much damage I take, I can keep going.”

 

“Midoriya Izuku,” Nedzu notes, pointing to the leader.

 

“We don’t have time to argue,” Midoriya says with a sigh.“If you’re comfortable with your hand-to-hand skills, join Uchiro and Nakagawa.”

 

“What are they doing?” Hizashi asks, leaning forward with his chin on his hands and his elbows on his knees.

 

Nedzu smiles and the image is straight out of Shouta’s nightmares. Literally. Shouta has had multiple nightmares in which Nedzu gives him a pop quiz, Shouta fails, and Nedzu smiles exactly like that. “He’s splitting them up by skill set. Ranged versus close combat. Volatile versus contained. But, more importantly, he’s organizing them based on how their quirks will interact.”

 

“Er... what do you mean?”

 

“Well, for instance--” Nedzu stops mid-sentence, which Shouta doesn't think he’s ever done before. “Just listen.”

 

“Anda-chan, would you feel comfortable using bullets Hano creates?” Midoriya asks.

 

The girl in question startles and glances at another student.

 

“It’s completely sanitary,”  the other student, most likely Hano, says.

 

When she doesn’t answer immediately, Midoriya speaks up again, “Just a yes or a no, please. We’re on a time crunch.”

 

“S-sure. It’s fine.”

 

“Anda Satoko can spit small items from her mouth at high velocities rivaling a rifle. However, her aim depends highly on the shape of the item,” Nedzu states. “Since we don’t allow students to bring in outside materials, in its natural state, her quirk would be useless.”

 

“This Hano kid can create bullets?” Snipe asks. “How?”

 

“Metal Discharge. He can release the metal within his body through his pores and solidify or mold it to his desire. It’s fairly useful for close combat, as it has the potential to be used for both offense and defense. However, with Hano creating bullets for Anda, his effectiveness is incredibly increased.”

 

“You’re telling me that in... two minutes, this Midoriya kid analyzed their quirks well enough to basically create hero duos? ” Vlad King interjects.

 

“They aren’t only duos. There are groups of threes and fours, as well.”

 

Shouta, in all honesty, doesn’t know what to think. He’s impressed, definitely. No examinee has ever gone the teamwork route before and cooperation is completely underrated. But, Shouta still can’t help but think this is all too good to be true.

 

“What’s his quirk?” Shouta asks.

 

“Whose?” Nedzu replies with naivety he doesn’t have.

 

“Midoriya’s.”

 

Nedzu smiles back at him. “I’m happy you’re interested in an examinee, Aizawa, but that’s cheating. You’ll have to wait and see.”

 

Shouta clicks his tongue. He isn’t interested. He’s curious. Curious. There’s a difference.

 

“Oh?” Hizashi starts, leaning closer to Shouta. “You’re interested in someone? Really? Who is it?”

 

Shouta doesn’t answer, instead hiding his face in his sleeping bag.

 

“Midoriya Izuku,” All Might answers from the other side of the room. “I think you’d be a good teacher for him, Aizawa.”

 

Shouta doesn’t ask why All Might thinks that because Shouta doesn’t care.

 

“Seriously?!” Nemuri screams at the screens. “He knows sign language, too? Who the fuck is this kid, the next prime minister?”

 

All Might’s eyes widen. “He does?”

 

“Hey, walking megaphone, what are they saying?” Nemuri asks, raising her eyebrows at Hizashi.

 

“Don't call me out like this,” Hizashi grumbles as Nedzu zooms in on the two testers’ hands. “They’re talking about the blond’s quirk, now, Retry. It--goodness--it lets him rewind time back to the last time he blinked. Oh, alright, that makes me feel better about myself. He can only do it once per blink and overuse of it gives him pretty bad migraines.”

 

“His name is Suda-kun,” Midoriya says to the crowd. They all say hellos back. “Did I pronounce that right?” he asks Suda, who nods. “Great. His quirk is Reflexes--”

 

Not Retry, Reflexes.

 

The room of staff and Suda tense simultaneously.

 

“--he can react to situations extremely quickly. Suda-kun, you can work with Iida and Wakita. You’ll be able to provide them backup.”

 

Everyone is silent until Nedzu says, “That seems to have caught you all off-guard. I don’t know why. It was the best solution.”

 

“Solution?” All Might asks quietly. “Where was the problem?”

 

“You have a naive perspective! The examinees currently have less than a minute until the exam starts, and that’s just assuming U.A. sticks to the timeline Yamada casually implied. Midoriya is incapable of explaining Suda’s quirk to eighteen others and also completing his task of creating a united team within that timeline. In addition, how did you all initially react when learning what Suda’s quirk was?”

 

“Personally, I was intimidated,” Ectoplasm says.

 

“That is the correct answer! And we are mature adults. How do you think teenagers would respond when hearing about a potentially powerful time travel quirk?”

 

“They wouldn’t trust him,” Shouta answers. “Suda would be ostracized."

 

“Exactly! Midoriya bypassed the entire situation by simplifying Suda’s quirk down to what it accomplishes.”

 

Shouta finds it hard to believe that a fifteen year-old made such an educated decision in just a few seconds.

 

“Are you justifying lying?” All Might suddenly asks.

 

“Yes, in fact, I am! In some situations, a lie is better than the truth,” Nedzu answers.

 

All Might doesn’t respond and Hizashi announces the start of the exam.

 

- - -

 

Nedzu is both physically and mentally capable of watching all two hundred live feeds (one for each applicant) at once. And usually he does. It isn’t his fault that during this particular exam, some feeds are more eye-catching that others. For once, Nedzu actually has expectations. Arena F is actually competent.

 

Never before has he seen examinees go through the exam so effortlessly, like actors in a Broadway-ready performance. There aren’t any loose ends. When a mistake happens, it's immediately patched up. 

 

For instance, Kobo Yakukazu and Saza Cho.

 

Kobo's quirk, Bubbles, is impressive on paper. Bubbles which explode when they pop? A classic hero quirk. Unfortunately, he lacks any control over the quirk, so practical use is actually more dangerous than anything else.

 

But...

 

“Tell me when, Saza-san,” Kobo says calmly as three two-pointers wheel up to them.

 

Saza sighs and adjusts her glasses. “We’re close. One-one,” she states.

 

Kobo breaths in and puffs out his cheeks.

 

“Alright,” Saza starts when the robots are less than ten feet away. “One-seven. Probably as good as it’s gonna get.”

 

Kobo burps out five small, translucent bubbles which float in the air.

 

The robots run straight into them and explode upon impact. All of them, dead.

 

Kobo smiles and holds out his hand. “Nice one! Midoriya-san was right, we make a great team. Thanks for your help with my quirk, Saza-san.”

 

After a couple seconds of hesitation, Saza lazily high-fives back.

 

Saza's quirk, Risk Versus Reward, tells her the probability of any situation ending with a negative or positive outcome. It doesn’t have any physical applications on its own. Unless she has years of special training in hand-to-hand combat (which she doesn’t), she shouldn’t have any chance at passing the practical exam.

 

In any other arena, neither of them would score more than ten points. But, with the two of them working together, they’re both already above thirty.

 

Nedzu can hardly believe it.

 

- - -

 

“It’s time,” Nedzu announces as he hands the microphone to Hizashi.

 

Hizashi clears his throat and takes the mic. Nedzu--somehow, he doesn’t even have hands, he has paws--holds up three fingers and counts down silently. Nedzu hits the button right before Hizashi yells, “Only five minutes remaining, boys, girls, and other gender or agender teens! Good luck!”

 

The ground shakes even from the safety of the monitoring room. There are, after all, ten zero-pointers out at once.

 

Shouta groans and drinks his coffee. They have another three weeks of this crap. They are the best hero school in the world and, therefore, get a shit-ton of applicants. He seriously debates finally suggesting that they outsource the process, because it’s a nine-to-two job during these four weeks and then a straight day or two of solid arguing during the actual decision making. The entire process, despite supposedly being designed by Nedzu himself, takes five weeks in all and Shouta hates every minute. It makes him actually look forward to teaching which, in hindsight, might be the purpose.

 

“No one’s gonna do it,” Shouta grumbles.

 

“C’mon,” Hizashi whines. “You never know. There are more than a couple good ones this batch.”

 

Arena F doesn’t even need mentioning at this point.

 

“The chance is--what is it again, Nedzu?” Hizashi asks.

 

Nedzu’s ears perk up at the sound of his name. “Oh? For an examinee to take on the zero-pointer? Based on past data, one in every three hundred thousand, four hundred sixty seven. Less than ten percent of those who try will actually stick with it long enough to get rescue points.”

 

Shouta narrows his eyes at Hizashi. See?

 

Hizashi just huffs, crosses his arms, and pouts. “There’s still a chance.”

 

For a couple minutes examinees run around with their heads cut off.

 

Then, Hizashi cringes. “Oof,” he whispers before nodding to one of the monitors. “That looks bad.”

 

One of the examinees managed to get stuck under a piece of rubble so heavy she can’t get out from under it. And she’s trapped right in the path of the zero-pointer.

 

“It’s now or never, Hizashi,” Shouta grunts. He really has no trust in teenagers these days. No, he needs to clarify that. He’s never had trust in anybody. Humans are terrible creatures.

 

It ends up being now, rather than never.

 

Before Nedzu can finish saying, “That’s Arena F, Aizawa, I’d seriously reconsider,” someone takes out the zero-pointer.

 

Shouta can’t follow what happens. The examinee--Midoriya something, of course--struts calmly up to the girl and lifts up the large block while, in the background, the zero-pointer just collapses to the ground, powerless.

 

“What. The. Fuck,” Shouta deadpans, eyes wide with shock.

 

Nedzu chuckles and the sound fills the room, silencing everyone else. “Midoriya Izuku,” he says, dropping his chin on his paws. “He’s interesting, indeed.”

 

A shiver runs down Shouta’s spine.

 

Nedzu calling a living human being interesting cannot be a good sign.

 

Someone clears their throat and another person sputters.

 

“Interesting? Are you sure?” All Might inputs, voice cracking at every other syllable. “He looks pretty normal to me.”

 

Nedzu doesn’t look away from the screen. “Normal? He united nineteen strangers into near perfect hero squadrons and, if the computer’s initial calculations are accurate--” They are. Nedzu programmed it himself. “--none of them scored below sixty points.”

 

Everyone is silent. Even Shouta doesn’t have an answer.

 

All he knows is that Midoriya is going to be a problem student for whichever teacher gets stuck with him.

 

- - -

 

“So,” Nedzu begins from the head of the table. “Everyone has had a chance to look over the tentative class rosters?”

 

There’s a chorus of yes’s. Shouta just grunts.

 

Now, it's the decision making part. Also known as: everyone sits around a table and talks at each other for eight hours straight.

 

“Any questions or concerns?”

 

Snipe raises his hand and waits until Nedzu gestures to ask, “Why didn’t you admit more January Ten kids into the hero course? Most of them at least doubled the scores of almost everyone else, especially when you take into account rescue points.”

 

January Ten kids is the nickname they all gave the examinees in Arena F on that day, when Midoriya broke the exam.

 

“We were forced to weigh their scores differently. Otherwise, all of them would be admitted into the hero course, and we all know that would not have been the case if Midoriya had not interfered as he did.”

 

“I believe that some did make it into gen ed,” Ectoplasm starts. “I know at least one is in business, now.”

 

“That is correct. Three were admitted into the hero course, three into general education, one into business, and another into support,” Nedzu answers. “On that note, we will be prohibiting explicit team-ups for future exams.”

 

“Why do we need to illegalize team-ups?” Hizashi asks. “They weren’t illegal before.”

 

“It was unnecessary to make them illegal when no one considered them an option. Now that they’ve been put on the table, we need to take them off.”

 

Hizashi grumbles something incomprehensible, but doesn’t continue.

 

After a moment of silence, Cementoss asks, “I have a question,” without raising a hand.

 

“Go ahead,” Nedzu prompts.

 

“Mineta-kun has a disciplinary record. He has numerous complaints of lewd behavior and verbal harassment from his middle school. Even though no disciplinary action came from them, this would usually disqualify someone for admittance, let alone the hero course.”

 

Nedzu taps his pen against the table a couple times before answering. “Yes, Mineta-kun is a special case. I have decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and a second chance. He did score high enough in the practical exam to qualify for the hero course and his written exam scores were of the top ten percent of the applicants.”

 

“You’re going to let a possible sexual predator into the hero course because he scored well? ” Nemuri hisses.

 

Nedzu doesn’t flinch. “Yes.”

 

“Fuck this shit,” Nemuri announces, fists clenching. “Let’s vote on it.”

 

“I apologize, Kayama,” Nedzu starts, his expression unchanging. “But we cannot vote on this issue. It comes from above me.”

 

“Above you? ”

 

“The funding committee,” Shouta deadpans, the even tone of his voice not at all reflecting his anger.

 

“Yes.”

 

“Fuck!” Nemuri yells, shooting to her feet. In a hurry, she packs her bag, stuffing papers in without care. “I won’t be a part of this, Nedzu.”

 

She storms out. After looking between Nedzu and her, Hizashi runs after her.

 

“Anything else?” Nedzu asks like the entire confrontation never happened.

 

All Might raises his hand, obviously shivering with nerves.

 

“Yes, All Might?”

 

“Er, I know it’s my first time at U.A. and all, so this is probably a stupid question, but why exactly do we need to enroll Mineta-kun?”

 

Shouta grunts to claim the answer. “Mineta-kun’s family is a big donor. If we don’t admit Mineta-kun, they’ll stop donating, and U.A. will lose that portion of their income.”

 

“Aizawa is correct,” Nedzu continues. “Although we are required--”

 

“Required is a strong word,” Shouta interrupts quietly.

 

Nedzu continues like Shouta never spoke, “--to admit him, we will be able to expel him during the school year if it comes down to it.”

 

“I would like to say,” Vlad King begins, tone carefully even, “although I understand why you feel the need to admit him, please consider the image this presents to our students.”

 

“I have,” Nedzu states.

 

No one can say anything to that because they all know it’s the truth.

Chapter Text

“How’d the exam go?” Toshinori asks even though he knows exactly how the exam went. He watched the recordings at least three times.

 

“I think it went really well! The written exam wasn’t too bad and I think I made some friends during the practical. I discovered I can use One for All’s strength enhancing and another quirk at the same time, which is pretty cool.”

 

Strength enhancing.

 

Midoriya’s been treating One for All like any other strength enhancement quirk, which Toshinori supposes is fine. However, it means he’s stagnated at less than one percent of One for All’s potential. Midoriya could be so much stronger, if only Toshinori knew how to change Midoriya’s perspective.

 

On the plus side, Midoriya's caution with the quirk means there’s very little, if any, possibility of injury.

 

“We all exchanged numbers,” Midoriya says, probably to fill the silence. Midoriya’s never been comfortable with silence. “We have a group chat with all twenty of us. It’s sort of crowded, but it’s fun.”

 

Toshinori pauses eating his sorbet to contrast Midoriya’s experience at U.A.'s entrance exam with his own. In short, his had been chaos. He doesn’t remember it very clearly, anymore, but he does recall the mad rush of adrenaline during the fight for points. He remembers the feeling of competition, like every other examinee is there just to take points away from you. He remembers punching so many robots that he bruised his knuckles.

 

Midoriya’s exam had been nothing like that if he was able to make friends during it.

 

Toshinori wants to ask Midoriya what drove him to make an alliance out of his entire arena, but he can’t.

 

There’s another question he has to ask, first.

 

“Midoriya-kun,” Toshinori starts, looking above his successor’s head, “about what happened, after I gave you... it? When we were here, at Frozen Delights and Yuuma-san asked who you were...”

 

Toshinori’s throat tightens shut and he can’t force himself to ask the question.

 

“Yeah?” Midoriya asks like nothing’s wrong.

 

“You--” Toshinori swallows and tries again. He doesn’t know why he feels so nauseous. Midoriya is Midoriya. It isn’t like Toshinori is asking anything bad. It’s just a question. “How did you lie so easily?” he finally squeezes out.

 

Midoriya’s eyes widen and, for a moment, that’s his only reaction. “What do you mean?” he asks quietly.

 

“When you told her... you’re my nephew.” Toshinori tries to read Midoriya, but he just looks confused with his wide eyes and parted mouth.

 

“I mean...” Midoriya says, “I just did it?” He shrugs, but doesn’t say anything else.

 

Toshinori frowns. “I suppose a better question would be, why?”

 

Midoriya straightens his back and looks at nothing in particular. “I didn’t see any other option,” he answers almost immediately.

 

What drove Midoriya to believe lying is the only option? When and where did this happen?

 

“Um...” Toshinori coughs into his fist as a placeholder and glances around the shop in hopes he’ll find the answer. “You could have told the truth, or a version of it.”

 

“I wasn’t aware what she knew about you,” Midoriya says without inflection. “If I told her you were my physical trainer and she had no idea about your connections to the hero industry, that would just raise more questions.”

 

Toshinori frowns at the effortless rebuttal. “You could have avoided the question. Told her your name and nothing else.”

 

Midoriya just shakes his head. “She’d be intrigued by the mystery. The longer we avoided the question, the more desire she’d have for an answer.”

 

Toshinori sinks into his chair, defeated. “You could have... let me answer it?”

 

“And what would you have said, Yagi-san?”

 

“Er...”

 

Midoriya smiles--finally--and the atmosphere is normal again. “Yes, that would have gone so well.” He rolls his eyes. “We’re in agreement, then? Lying was the safest way to handle the situation?”

 

“I’m not happy about it but... I can’t argue.”

 

There are still so many unanswered questions, but Toshinori supposes he can save those for another time. Or maybe never.

 

“Have you gotten your quirk re-registered, yet?” Toshinori asks, instead.

 

“Yeah! Just before the exam. They named it ‘Multi-Quirk’ and told me it’s level Silver. Random Quirk Generator was only Blue. That’s six whole levels higher.”

 

Toshinori startles. Silver? When he had One for All, it was Bronze. Silver is an entire Metallic higher. “Did they give you the whole Metallic speech? About the increased regulations?”

 

Midoriya nods. “I got an entire folder of information. I haven’t finished reading it yet, though.”

 

“I could summarize everything I remember. I’m sure it’s not everything, but I have to know quite a bit as a hero. I’ve also been Bronze since I got--since my quirk came in, so I have that going for me.”

 

“That would be helpful, thank you!”

 

Toshinori thinks for a moment about where to start, then asks, “I’m assuming you know the basics about the quirk power classification system? The differences between Rainbow and Metallics?”

 

“Of course! The main difference is regulations and repercussions for illegal quirk usage. Quirks under a Rainbow threat, ranked Purple to Red, all face the same base-line punishment. Metallics, as they have an incredibly higher threat level, face harsher, more individualized punishments.”

 

Toshinori nods along as Midoriya speaks, but stalls by the time he finishes. “Threat level?” Toshinori asks. “I was always taught quirks were classified by power output, not threat level.”

 

Midoriya shrugs. “Power, threat. What’s the difference?”

 

Toshinori can’t think of an argument, so he continues. “Well, the process for getting a hero license is different for someone with a Metallic quirk versus a Rainbow quirk.”

 

“Really?” Midoriya asks.

 

“Well, not really different, just, slightly longer. You have to go through a couple extra steps.”

 

“Do you know about the Black or White levels?”

 

“The whats?” Toshinori asks before his brain catches up. “Wait, are those the levels above Metallic?”

 

“Yup. It goes Blank, Rainbow, Metallics, Black, White. I actually don’t know if any quirk has ever been classified under the White code.”

 

That’s probably for the best. Toshinori’s One for All is at the lowest Metallic level. He can’t even begin to comprehend what a White-leveled quirk would look like.

 

“I don’t know about a quirk at the Black or White level, unfortunately,” Toshinori answers. “If you’re really interested in it, I’m sure Nedzu knows.”

 

“The principal of U.A.?” Midoriya asks and it’s only then that Toshinori realizes what he’s said.

 

Oh. Oh no.

 

Now Toshinori is imagining Nedzu and Midoriya in the same room.

 

That’s definitely a recipe for disaster.

 

“Uh,” Toshinori starts, but he knows it’s too late.

 

“Maybe I will ask him,” Midoriya says with a smile much too innocent to actually be innocent.

 

 

 

 

A Number of Days Later

 

 

The Midoriya household doesn’t get mail.

 

All for One set it up this way specifically, years ago, when it was just Inko and him.

 

Where other houses get bills and advertisements and magazines, the Midoriyas don’t get anything.

 

So, when a thick paper folder falls through the never-been-used mail slot, it can only be one thing.

 

Izuku’s acceptance letter.

 

Izuku is, right now, still at school.

 

All for One opens the folder, hoping he won’t have to pull out the text-to-speech app on his phone.

 

“I am here!” the letter announces in All Might’s voice, “as a hologram!”

 

Ah. Of course it’s a hologram. At least there’s audio.

 

“Surprise! I’m teaching at U.A.! Oh, wait, you already... what? I need to get to the point? Alright! Congratulations, Midoriya Izuku! As you probably already guessed, you made it into U.A.’s Hero Course! Class 1-A, in fact! And, you got the highest score in record with thirty-two villain points and seventy-six rescue points. I’m sure you can figure out what rescue points are if you haven’t already. Right! The point! Your total is one hundred nine! And that’s not all! Uraraka-chan was so moved by your heroic deeds she came to us with this request!”

 

The audio fizzles, but that’s the only warning All for One gets before a girl’s voice replaces All Might’s. “He probably got enough points but... he saved me, you know? I want to make sure he gets in and he deserves them more than me, anyway. Could you--could you please give half of my points to him?”

 

“Welcome to your hero academia, Midoriya-kun! Plus Ultra!”

 

The audio cuts off into silence.

 

The highest score in record.

 

All for One's smile is more a smirk, and befits a villain more than a father.

 

- - -

 

When Izuku gets home, Father calls him into the living room. “Come listen to this!” Father announces.

 

“What is it?” Izuku asks as he drops his backpack by the stairs.

 

“Your results for U.A.”

 

Izuku is only surprised by Uraraka’s message. He may not have known that he got in, but Izuku had a pretty good idea. He was confident enough in his own ability to keep track of his points and ability to read Yagi to make the assumption.

 

“Congratulations, Izuku,” Father says. “We should celebrate, don’t you think?”

 

Izuku doesn’t want to do anything with his father right now. He wants to tell Yagi and the Arena F group chat that he got in. But, Izuku knows what the right answer is, “Yeah! What do you want to do? I could make that steak you like.”

 

“No, no. This is a special occasion, Izuku. You got into the most selective hero school in the country. Let’s go out.”

 

Out.

 

Izuku freezes. He fixes a neat smile on over his face and asks, “Out? Where?” They never go out. Or, more specifically, they haven’t gone out in roughly five years.

 

“Why not Arakawa? You used to love that place.”

 

“Do we have a reservation?”

 

“Don’t worry about that, Izuku. Let’s go! Celebrate! This is your day!”

 

If it really was Izuku’s day, fate or some higher power would just let Izuku rest.

 

 

While Izuku is changing into a suit and a green tie, his phone buzzes.

Izuku debates responding. He really, really wants to. But, he has priorities. Dinner.

 

 

“Did you really get reservations to Arakawa?” Izuku asks during the drive.

 

“Are you doubting me, Izuku?”

 

“Of course not.” It’s just that Arakawa is one of Tokyo's top ten hardest places to get in to and we just found out about my acceptance today.

 

“Arakawa?” the driver asks. He lets out a wolf-whistle. “Shi--shambles. I feel under-dressed just driving up to the place. Why didn’t you buy Uber Black if you can afford it?”

 

“I may waste money on good food,” Father begins, “but I don’t succumb so far into the scam which is capitalism that I would waste it on a slightly more expensive car.”

 

“Uh, right, of course... sir. Fu--fudge the patriarchy and all that, right?”

 

“Indeed.”

 

“So, Arakawa? Y’all celebrating something?”

 

“My son got into U.A.’s Hero Course.”

 

“U.A.?! ” the driver exclaims, almost swerving the car out of their lane. “Holy--holy shit. Fuckin’ hell! I’m--I’m driving around a celebrity! A celebrity! You’re gonna be a hero one day! Could I get your autograph, kid?”

 

“It’ll cost you a hundred bucks,” Father says without missing a beat.

 

“Huh?” is all the driver responds with.

 

“I’m joking.” Father chuckles and shakes his head. “I was being sarcastic. I don’t care what Izuku does.”

 

Izuku has to hold himself back from snickering at such a blatant lie.

 

“R-really? Great!”

 

“Have you decided on a hero name, yet?” Father asks Izuku.

 

“No,” Izuku lies.

 

“That’s fine! Your given name is totally cool, too. There should be a notebook and pen in one of the pockets on the back of the seats.”

 

Izuku finds it, signs a page, and puts it back.

 

When the driver drops them off, Father tips him an extra twenty bucks.

 

 

“Name, sir?” Arakawa's hostess asks.

 

“Midoriya,” Father answers. The portable respirator hanging from his neck is the loudest noise in the whole restaurant.

 

After a moment of scanning the tablet, her eyes widen and she bows slightly. “P-please excuse me.”

 

“Of course,” Father says even though she’s already halfway across the restaurant.

 

Izuku tries to look comfortable, like he belongs with this scene. But, honestly? The candle chandeliers? The gold silverware? The quiet opera you can hear just well enough to identify, but not well enough to appreciate? Izuku doesn’t like any of this.

 

“Midoriya-sama,” a different woman starts with a deep bow. She's wearing a nice, dark suit. The skirt and lack of apron implies she doesn’t do a lot of walking around or work in the kitchen. “It’s an honor to be serving you. I’m one of Arakawa’s managers, Koyanagi. We’ll have a table ready for you in just a couple minutes.”

 

Izuku startles. It’s an honor. A couple minutes. What is this? Did they seriously just walk into Arakawa without a reservation?

 

“Thank you, Koyanagi-san. And Midoriya-san is fine. I appreciate your hospitality.”

 

“If you don’t mind the intrusion,” Koyanagi starts, “is there any special occasion to your visit? We haven’t seen you in years.”

 

Father drops a hand on Izuku’s shoulder and pulls him to his side. “My son got into U.A.”

 

“Really?” she glances at Izuku for just a moment before looking back to his father. “Congratulations. I’m happy for you.” The smile plastered on her face is obviously fake, and her words are even less honest.

 

Izuku is used to it, though, the pandering.

 

Two patrons pass by them silently. After the door closes behind them, Koyanagi says, “Your table is ready, sir.” She takes them to a small, two-person table in one of the corners and tells them Takei will be their waiter before she leaves.

 

“So, Izuku,” Father starts, holding the menu like he can read it. “You got first place. Are you happy?”

 

“Definitely,” Izuku answers because it’s what Father wants to hear.

 

It still hasn’t sunk in yet. Izuku doesn’t know if it ever will. He can hardly believe he actually got into U.A. He probably won’t until he walks into class.

 

His first place is probably a mistake, too.

 

“My name is Takei,” their waiter says with a bow of his head. “May I get either of you something to drink? An appetizer?”

 

They both get water. No appetizer.

 

“Why don’t you tell me how you beat U.A.’s record?” Father asks.

 

“Do you know what you’re ordering?” Izuku answers.

 

“Of course, beef. Do you?”

 

“Not yet,” Izuku says, scanning the single-paged menu.

 

“How about the beef? It’s what you always used to get as a kid.”

 

Izuku doesn’t even consider something else. “You’re right. I forgot. I’ll go with that.”

 

“Great.” Father sets his menu down. “Now, the exam. I want to know all the details. How did my own son beat the previous record?”

 

Izuku crosses his legs at the ankles and pulls them under his chair. “I didn’t really do anything special...” Izuku pauses as the waiter drops off their drinks and they order their meals.

 

“Nothing special,” Father picks back up. “I’m sure you’re underselling yourself, but continue.”

 

Izuku shrugs. “I mean, I did what I always do. I talked. I convinced a couple of the other applicants to work with me, and I’m pretty sure U.A. gave me some extra Rescue Points for it. I used Pull to take out a number of the robots, but I don’t think I got an impressive amount.”

 

“Most of your points did come from Rescues,” Father notes. “You think that’s due to the alliance you built?”

 

“Probably.”

 

Father hums for a moment. “That doesn’t sound accurate. I'm sure they give out Rescue Points for actively protecting others or putting yourself in the line of danger, not something passive like that. Yours could be a result of your team, but I don’t think it’s a direct correlation.”

 

There isn’t a question in there. But, Father is expecting a response. “That does make sense.”

 

“But?” Father asks.

 

Izuku shakes his head. “There isn’t a but.”

 

“I’m definitely hearing a but.” Father says it with a smile. It sounds light. But, he isn't going to give it up. 

 

Izuku bites his lower lip before saying, “Another applicant in my alliance only got seventy-some points, and the only difference between our performances that I can think of is that I’m the one who organized us.”

 

“Another student?”

 

There’s a reason Izuku didn’t want to go down this train of topic. “Yes, Father.”

 

“So you’ve been in contact with another student... why didn’t you tell me? You know I love hearing about your friends.”

 

“It just never came up and I ended up forgetting. Sorry.”

 

Father frowns. “Forgetting? You two must not be very close, then. Or did you just not want to tell me?”

 

Izuku doesn’t have a choice in his answer. “We only met through the exam, Father. We aren’t close at all.”

 

Father clasps his hands together and places them on the table. He leans forward to say, “So you can’t even make a friend. I see. Maybe you aren’t good enough for U.A. after all. ”

 

Izuku tenses. His heart pumps blood through his body at a speed fast enough to make him boil. He should be used to it by now. He should know better than to let what Father says get to him. But... it still hurts.

 

Neither of them say another word until the food arrives.

 

“This really is delicious,” Father remarks like nothing happened.

 

“It is,” Izuku responds with a small smile that probably doesn’t reach his eyes. “Definitely worth the money.”

 

“I agree. There are some things you just have to pour money into to get the full experience. Food will always be one of those.”

 

 

After their plates have been cleared, Father frowns and says, “I’m sorry, Izuku. Sometimes I speak before thinking, you know that. I went too far earlier.”

 

Izuku smiles and uncrosses his legs. “No, don’t worry about it! It really isn’t a big deal.” It really isn’t. Izuku should be used to stuff like that by now. It’s just how Father communicates.

 

Father’s frown deepens. “Are you... going to forgive me.”

 

“Ah! Sorry, of course! I forgive you.”

 

Father smiles. “Let’s get desert, then. Today is your day, after all.”

Chapter Text

Izuku finds his classroom with reasonable ease. The maps pinned in various locations around the campus, although convoluted, offer all the information he needs to find 1-A.

 

He’s thirty minutes early, so he expects no one else to be there, but after opening the door he finds three other students.

 

“Midoriya-san!” Iida calls from the other side of the classroom, already stalking towards him. “It’s a pleasure to see you again! How have you been these past few weeks?”

 

Izuku recognizes one of the two as Todoroki Shouto. The other, a young woman with a dark ponytail, he doesn’t know.

 

“I’ve been great! How are you?” Izuku replies.

 

“Pretty good! Let me introduce you all! Midoriya-san, this is Todoroki Shouto and Yaoyorozu Momo. Todoroki-san and Yaoyorozu-san, this is Midoriya Izuku.”

 

“It’s nice to meet you, Midoriya-san,” Yaoyorozu says, walking up and extending her hand.

 

“And you, Yaoyorozu-san.”

 

When Todoroki doesn’t move to repeat the gesture, Izuku steps up to him. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Todoroki-san.”

 

Izuku is met with nothing but the orange-red of suspicion and hostility and aggression.

 

Todoroki doesn’t say anything, but his glare and aura convey paragraphs.

 

After a moment of awkward silence, Iida exclaims, “Midoriya-san!” When Izuku turns around, Iida is in a bow bent at his waist. “I want to offer my most sincerest gratitude!”

 

Izuku doesn’t trust what Empathy is telling him.

 

There is no way Iida is being serious.

 

“I received an extra thirty points in Rescue Points and, even taking into account U.A.’s weighting, I got sixty one points! Thank you very much for your assistance!”

 

He isn’t lying. Isn’t he lying?

 

He has to be lying, but Empathy is saying Iida’s telling the truth.

 

Izuku opens his mouth, closes it, opens it again. Then, he does what he always does. He smiles and says what Iida wants to hear, “You’re welcome.”

 

“Did you help Iida-san during the entrance exam?” Yaoyorozu asks as Iida straightens his back.

 

“Not really,” Izuku answers as Iida exclaims, “Definitely!”

 

Iida shoots Izuku a raised eyebrow, but just clears his throat and continues. “Midoriya-san convinced our entire testing arena to cooperate. Due to the nature of Rescue Points, it greatly increased many of our scores.”

 

“Wow,” Yaoyorozu starts. “That’s impressive.”

 

Izuku just smiles and lets the words wash over him.

 

 

Katsuki arrives with ten minutes to spare.

 

Izuku, after much debate, pretends Katsuki doesn’t exist.

 

It’s hard. Not saying hello or waving makes Izuku physically nauseous. It goes against everything his father has taught him.

 

But he knows it’s what Katsuki wants.

 

Katsuki ignores everyone else, even the kind Kirishima who's been introducing himself to everyone.

 

 

Izuku gets a text message three minutes before class starts. Iida does, too.

 

“It’s from Uraraka-san,” Iida says. “She has gotten lost and cannot find the classroom. She is requesting assistance.”

 

Izuku jumps to his feet. “I’ll help her!”

 

“Would you like me to come with you?” Iida asks.

 

“Only if you want to. I can’t promise we’ll make it back on time.”

 

“I shall remain here, then. Good luck, Midoriya-san.”

 

“Thanks!” Izuku says before leaving the classroom.

 

Izuku picks a random direction to walk and calls Uraraka.

 

“Midoriya! Thank you so much! I’m on the third floor somewhere!”

 

“Do you see any signs?”

 

“Uh... oh! Support, 3-H. Is that good?”

 

“It is! You’re in the right building, Uraraka-chan! That’s great. Take the nearest stairs down. I’ll meet you there.”

 

Uraraka sighs. “Wait, what time is it? What if I make you late?”

 

“It’ll be fine. It’s the first day of class and U.A. is a big campus. The teacher is bound to be lenient during the first few days.”

 

Izuku stands at the bottom of the stairs and hears Uraraka ask, “Are you sure?” through both his phone and up another floor.

 

“I’m sure!” he yells and hangs up the phone.

 

Uraraka jogs down the last flight and greets him with a smile. “Alright. If you say so.” After a moment of walking to their room, Uraraka asks, “Does everyone else seem nice?”

 

“Yup,” Izuku answers. “I don’t know them too well, but they seem pretty cool.”

 

“That’s good.”

 

They stop in front of the door. “Okay,” Uraraka exhales. “The moment of truth.”

 

“You nervous?”

 

Uraraka chuckles. “Just a little bit. The first days are always the worst, you know? New people, new...”

 

Uraraka keeps talking, but Izuku doesn’t hear her, anymore.

 

He’s distracted by the sound of intentionally shallow breaths, by the light grey aura illuminating the hallway, by someone trying to sneak around.

 

Izuku is back in his kitchen at two in the morning, trying to steal a handful of cereal because he hasn't eaten in three days, and Father is sneaking down the stairs. He instantly scans his environment for somewhere to hide. When he finds nothing but a door he doesn't recognize--too risky, he doesn’t know how loud the hinges are--he falls back on his last resort. He’ll find him first.

 

- - -

 

They make eye-contact from across the hallway.

 

Shouta has nothing against eye-contact, but he is currently deep in stealth-mode--as deep as he goes for his hero missions. Like this--silent, barely breathing, slithering across the floor in his sleeping bag--he doesn’t have a presence. He barely even exists.

 

So, the fact that a fifteen-year-old just found Shouta’s eyes while in the middle of engaging in a conversation is more than a little disconcerting.

 

Shouta doesn’t know how to react. Before he’s forced to, the student (fucking, Midoriya Izuku, the kid who broke the entrance exam and got Shouta two hundred dollars in debt) raises an eyebrow and signs like he knows Shouta will understand him. It’s just two words, but those two make the situation even more complicated.

 

“Eraser,” and “head.”

 

It’s a question, if his raised eyebrow and shrugging shoulders are anything to go by, but Midoriya shouldn’t even really know who Eraserhead is, let alone be able to recognize him by nothing but his face.

 

Shouta swallows and tries not to let his worry reach his face. As an underground hero (The Underground Hero), stealth and anonymity are his two strongest suits. In less than five seconds, Midoriya, an untrained teenager, has surpassed both of them.

 

Shouta slides up to his feet and signs back with his usual sloppy motions (if they’re a little more stilted than usual, at least Hizashi isn’t around to notice), “Midoriya Izuku.”

 

Midoriya just smiles and returns to his conversation.

 

What. The. Fuck.

 

How is Shouta supposed to make a dramatic entrance now?

 

It doesn’t look like Midoriya has broken his cover yet, so Shouta can at least sneak up on his other student--Uraraka, another examinee from January 10’s Arena F, unfortunately. It’s not the grand first impression he had been hoping for and the one he pulls off literally every other year, but he can live with it.

 

He slinks back to the ground and inches over to the pair, back in stealth-mode. He weaves through the occasional legs and feet which roam the hall. At less than a meter away he calls out, “If you have time to be chatting, you have time to be getting to class. Hurry up before you’re late.”

 

Uraraka jumps and lets out a shriek, hands coming up to her face. Midoriya just giggles and pulls her into the room after waving to Shouta.

 

This is going to be an interesting year, indeed.

 

- - -

 

Izuku is still on edge even after they change into their gym uniforms, head out to the field, and Eraserhead announces the activity.

 

What was that? Why was their own teacher sneaking around the place? Why was a hero?

 

“You’ve all had to do the MEXT tests before,” Eraserhead grunts. “You’re going to do them again, but with your quirks, this time.”

 

The class erupts into excited chatter. When Uraraka says, “This is going to be fun!” and Kirishima exclaims, “Hell yeah! I’m excited!”, Eraserhead huffs out and narrows his eyes.

 

“Fun?” he asks, lowering his voice an octave. “This isn’t fun. You’re all hero students, now, you don’t get fun. Fine, whoever gets the lowest score will be expelled.”

 

Everyone silences.

 

Izuku, equally on edge, just smiles wider. He’s fine with this. Izuku was already going to win, anyways.

 

“Midoriya,” Eraserhead begins, tossing a tennis ball at him. He catches it without blinking. “You got first on the entrance exam. Show us an example of the ball throw with your quirk. But first, what did you get without your quirk in middle school?”

 

“Fourty two meters!” Izuku exclaims, already skipping up to the circle. “Are there any rules?”

 

“Just don’t leave the circle.”

 

Izuku nods, steps into a shoulder-width stance, and pulls back his arm. His arm tenses in the moments before he throws, and then he chucks the ball with a sharp exhale.

 

After a couple seconds, Eraserhead announces, “Four hundred nineteen meters.”

 

It won’t be first, but as long as he scores high enough in the other tests, Izuku can still win.

 

- - -

 

Izuku is plotting something. He has to be, with all that talking he’s doing. Sure, Izuku talks, it’s basically all he does. But this is on a whole other level.

 

He moves onto the one with the laser like he’s trying to pick them off one by one.

 

“I’m Midoriya,” he says with that thing he somehow passes off as a smile.

 

“Aoyama Yuuga,” the blonde replies with a flip of his hair before they shake hands. “So you’re the one that got first place?”

 

Izuku chuckles. “Yes, I suppose I am.”

 

“What’s your quirk? Super strength? That’s a tad cliche, don’t you think?”

 

“You could say, that, yeah. But I don’t mind.” Izuku puffs out his chest and smiles wide. “It’s still my quirk! I don’t have any other!”

 

Katsuki doesn’t snort. Definitely not.

 

“What’s funny?” the kid who had been bugging him earlier asks him.

 

Katsuki just raises an eyebrow and turns to watch the active testers: invisigirl, octoman, and birdman.

 

“C’mon,” the redhead says, knocking their shoulders together. “Tell me. I wanna know.”

 

“Fuck off,” Katsuki growls under his breath.

 

The dude just chuckles. “Your quirk is pretty cool, man.” He wraps an arm around Katsuki’s shoulder. “Let’s be friends!”

 

Katsuki pulls away. “Not gonna happen,” he insists as he distances himself.

 

“Sounds great! My name’s Kirishima! Let’s exchange numbers later!”

 

- - -

 

“I don’t want to go through twenty individual scores so here’s the final lineup,” Aizawa says, flipping his screen around. All twenty of them huddle around it, trying to find their names. Ochako finds hers in eleventh place, which is pretty good! She could have done better, of course, but it isn't bad at all.

 

In first place is Midoriya, which is only surprising because some of the others definitely stood out more than him. The kid with the explosions and the icy one--who she’s pretty sure is Endeavor’s son but doesn’t want to make assumptions--were both flashier than him, as was the girl who could create things from her own body.

 

Last place is someone named Mineta-kun and is likely the boy with the purple balls for hair if his crying is anything to go by.

 

“You can’t expel me! I passed the entrance exam!” he pleads, hands clasped together. He’d be begging if only he were kneeling.

 

Aizawa sighs and, after another solid minute of Mineta’s sobbing, finally grunts out, “No one is getting expelled. It was all a logical ruse to ensure you put in maximum effort.”

 

Mineta lets out a cry of relief and collapses at Aizawa’s feet, muttering out platitudes.

 

Ochako jogs over to Midoriya and shoots him a smile. “Congratulations, Midoriya! You got first place! That’s really cool!”

 

He smiles back at her. “I’m still trying to wrap my head around the infinite score you got on the ball throw, Uraraka-chan.” He shakes his head fondly. “That was beyond my expectations.”

 

“It wasn’t really that much...” Ochako drifts off.

 

“Midoriya-san!” Iida interjects, clomping towards them with sharp, jerky motions. “Congratulations on receiving first place in the quirk apprehension test! You have more than proved that you are well prepared for the hero course, and for that you have my utmost respect!”

 

“Thank you, Iida-kun. You did well, too. Don’t sell yourself short!”

 

“Of course not!” Iida replies. “I am simply acknowledging your own accomplishments! You too, Uraraka-san! Eleventh place is commendable!”

 

Ochako spins around to better look at Iida. “Right back at ya’!”

 

“Now,” Aizawa drawls, somehow managing to steal their attention despite being the quietest of all of them. “Hurry and get back. It’s lunch time.”

 

- - -

 

“There’s barely anyone in the cafeteria!” Uraraka exclaims. “Are we sure this is the right place?”

 

“Yes, Uraraka-san. Only the hero course students are required to show up today, which is why attendance is lower than you might expect.”

 

“Ah, that explains it, thanks Iida!”

 

As they walk up to the counter, Izuku says, “I’m sort of sad we won’t get to see the others, though.”

 

Uraraka pouts. “Yeah, same.”

 

“Do not fret!” Iida announces. “We will have ample opportunities to interact with them in the near future!”

 

“That’s right! Maybe we’ll even get to see them tomorrow!” Izuku replies.

 

“I hope so!”

 

Uraraka and Iida both order their lunch and the three of them find an empty table.

 

“You aren’t eating Lunch Rush’s food?” Iida asks.

 

“Nope,” Izuku answers. “My father’s a sort of health nut, so I have a fairly strict diet.”

 

Fairly is a weak word to describe Father's attitude towards food, but it's not like Izuku can just tell them the truth.

 

Uraraka and Iida coo as soon as Izuku opens the lid to his homemade meal.

 

“I have to say,” Iida begins, adjusting his glasses. “That is an incredibly well-balanced meal. You have proteins, vegetables, and grains. I have no complaints.”

 

“It’s so fancy!” Uraraka exclaims, squirming in her seat. “Did your mother make it for you?”

 

“Ah, no,” Izuku begins, cracking his chopsticks apart. “I made it myself.”

 

“Really? I had no idea you were good at cooking!”

 

Izuku shrugs. “I wouldn’t say good. I get by.”

 

“Why don’t we test Uraraka-san’s theory?” Iida asks. “Would you be willing to let us taste your cooking, Midoriya-san? We can directly compare it to Lunch Rush’s!”

 

After a moment of consideration he says, “I suppose there’s no reason not to.” He places a dumpling on each of their plates.

 

“This is really good!” Uraraka exclaims, mouth still half-full of food.

 

Iida at least waits until swallowing to speak. “This is definitely above-par, Midoriya-san. Good job.”

 

Izuku smiles, says his thanks, and goes back to eating.

 

“What do you think about Aizawa-sensei?” Uraraka asks. “I thought all of U.A.’s teachers were heroes, but I don’t recognize Aizawa-sensei at all.”

 

“I’m in the same boat as you, Uraraka-san. It may be that either that rumour was incorrect, or we are simply unable to match him with his hero identity,” Iida answers.

 

“You think he might be a hero?”

 

Izuku swallows his bite of food before saying, “He is.”

 

“He is?” Uraraka asks, leaning forward over the table. “Which hero is he? Tell us, Midoriya!”

 

“Ever heard of Eraserhead?” Izuku asks, already pulling out his phone.

 

“Who?” Iida and Uraraka say simultaneously.

 

Izuku smiles. “Here, it’s a good introductory paper. He’s an underground hero, so there isn’t that much information on him.”

 

Uraraka takes Izuku’s phone and holds it so Iida can read it, as well.

 

As Izuku is finishing his meal, Iida asks, “Is this legitimate?”

 

“Scroll to the next page, there’s an annotated bibliography.”

 

Iida nods along as he scan it, then his eyes widen. “Goodness. I wouldn’t have ever considered a dot-net forum a reliable source, before, but this has convinced me.”

 

“It depends on how you use it,” Izuku adds. “If you use it by itself, it’s unreliable. If you have dot-org’s or edu’s to back it up, you should be fine.”

 

Iida adjusts his glasses. “I’ll have to reconsider my entire approach to writing research papers, now. Where did you find this one? It’s extremely well-written. I would love to read more pieces by the author.”

 

Izuku hesitates for less than a second before answering, “I don’t remember, unfortunately. If I ever find more, I’ll let you know.”

 

“I’d appreciate it.”

 

“You really think Aizawa-sensei is Eraserhead?” Uraraka interjects like she’s been holding the question back. She hands Izuku his phone.

 

“I really do!”

 

“It is a reasonable assumption,” Iida says. “They have comparable physical appearances and that scarf is unique.”

 

“I really hope Aizawa-sensei is Eraserhead! He sounded so cool in that paper. Like a sort of secret vigilante, but legal, y’know?”

 

“Not really, but feel free to continue,” Iida answers.

 

Uraraka chuckles. “I mean, most heroes do big jobs with lots of media attention, right? But Eraserhead does the shadowy, smaller stuff that the other heroes don’t want to do. Isn’t that cool?”

 

“Yes, I think it is... cool.”

 

Izuku smiles.

 

Whether it reaches his eyes or not... well, Izuku doesn’t think his smile ever will.

 

 

After classes are over, Eraserhead--no, he should probably call him Aizawa, now--says, “Midoriya, stay behind for a minute, if you can.”

 

Izuku freezes. His mind derails to the myriad of possible reasons why Aizawa might want to speak with him alone. Did Izuku accidentally cheat on the entrance exam? Did Aizawa find out that essay was his? Did someone discover the lockpicks in his bag (which are both illegal and against school policy)? Have they finally realized he actually has no right to be a U.A. student because he’ll never be good enough?

 

Even a minute after everyone leaves, Aizawa doesn’t say anything.

 

“Did you need something?” Izuku asks, managing to keep his voice steady through experience alone.

 

“Two things,” Aizawa finally starts from behind his desk. Two? Which two could they be? “One, you owe me two hundred bucks. Two, tell me more about your quirk.”

 

“Two hundred dollars?”

 

“Yup. Two hundred. Pay up.”

 

Izuku’s heart rate skyrockets. “Exactly how long do I have to get this to you?”

 

Aizawa watches him for a moment before sighing. “It’s a joke, kid.”

 

“Right, sorry.” He doesn't feel any better.

 

Aizawa waves a hand. “Don’t worry about it. I deadpan.”

 

Izuku smiles because he has nothing else to do. “Well, why don’t you explain it to me? So I understand it."

 

“Years ago, I bet that no one would ever form a team during the entrance exam. Then you happened.”

 

“Oh." Izuku frowns. "Sorry.”

 

Aizawa narrows his eyes. “You don’t have to apologize. I made the bet.”

 

“Two hundred is a lot of dollars,” Izuku notes.

 

“Not really.”

 

Oh. “What if I design modifications to your hero costume?”

 

Aizawa hesitates, then his eyebrows raise. “Don’t tell me... you designed the modifications to Present Mic’s costume, didn’t you?”

 

“I did draft something for him, yes, as a supplement to my application.”

 

Aizawa groans and runs his hand down his face. “Of course that was you. I should have guessed. Power Loader keeps complaining about how the hero course stole you from him, or something. If you go into a support classroom, I don’t know if you’ll ever return.”

 

Izuku chuckles. “It’ll be fine. I’m a hero at heart.”

 

After a moment, Aizawa continues, “You really don’t have to do it. It was just a joke.”

 

Izuku shakes his head. “I already had plans to reach out to the other departments. This just gives me an excuse.”

 

“If you insist. Don’t go telling people I blackmailed you into anything, though.”

 

Why would he? Did Izuku give Aizawa the impression he was of the blackmailing kind? Or is that another one of his jokes? “Of course not.”

 

“Now, your quirk. I just want a short clarification. The description on your application wasn’t clear at all.”

 

“Oh, sure! I mean, Multi-Quirk gives me the ability of multiple quirks. I can’t control what abilities I’ll gain or when, but once I gain it, it’s permanent. Currently, I have four “quirks” within Multi-Quirk: Empathy, Pull, Regeneration, and Strength Enhancement. Is that clear?”

 

“So, you could wake up tomorrow with another “quirk” or it couldn’t be for another ten years?”

 

“Yup!”

 

“Alright. You can go. I’ll let Power Loader know about your extra credit project.”

 

“Thanks!” Izuku takes a step towards the door, but stops. "Extra credit?" he asks.

 

"Yeah," Aizawa answers.

 

When Aizawa doesn't make a move to clarify further, Izuku says, "Okay, cool. Thanks," and leaves.

 

That was close.

  

Fuck.

 

Izuku made way too many mistakes.

Chapter Text

Ochako skips up to Midoriya and Iida as soon as they step into the arena they’re using for All Might’s supposed battle trials.

 

“I love your costumes, guys!” she exclaims even before she’s gotten the chance to actually form an opinion on either of them. She doesn’t need to see them to know she loves them. Iida is wearing a mecha-inspired suit of armor and Midoriya is wearing what looks like... just, normal street clothes--a maroon knit turtleneck, dark pants, a vest, and leather boots. The only items that don’t particularly belong on the street are the knee and elbow pads.

 

“Thank you very much, Uraraka-san!” Iida announces. “I like yours, as well.”

 

Ochako pouts and pulls at the fabric of her costume. “They made it a little too tight.”

 

Midoriya frowns. “We could probably get someone in the support department to fix that, if you want.”

 

Ochako waves her hands. “No, no! I don’t want to put you out of your way or anything, it isn’t that big of a deal!”

 

Midoriya smiles and shakes his head. “It isn’t an issue at all, Uraraka-chan. I’m sure at least one support student would be happy to help you.”

 

“Oh right,” Ochako begins, eyes widening. “We have connections.”

 

Midoriya giggles. “Yes, we do. Text Wakita-chan later.”

 

“I will... Wait!” she exclaims. “Aren’t you like, really good at design, Midoriya? Wakita was saying something like that the other day!”

 

Midoriya flushes and turns away a little bit. “Um, not really good.”

 

“Tell me about your costume!” Ochako says, leaning forward and giving him her biggest smile. “Please? I’m sure it’s awesome!”

 

Iida clears his throat. “If Midoriya-san does not wish to disclose the details of his costume, he is not required to. However, I am curious myself, as it is fairly unconventional in design.”

 

Midoriya smiles that sad smile he gets whenever someone says anything nice about him.

 

“I really like it!” Uraraka insists, not letting him getting away with wherever his mind is going. “And Wakita won’t stop talking about how the support kids are all gushing over you!”

 

Midoriya sighs. “Alright, alright. I’ll tell you. Bottom to top.” He sticks his foot out. “The boots can magnetize. It isn’t super strong, yet, but they can also do this--“ Two spikes stick out of his boot: one from the bottom of the sole and one from the tip of the shoe, where his toes go.

 

“Wow!” Ochako exclaims. She crouches down to get a better look. The spikes are roughly two inches long, and start at a little less than an inch in diameter until they taper to a sharp but thick point.

 

“That looks very dangerous, Midoriya-san,” Iida notes.

 

“They’re for climbing,” Midoriya answers but now Ochako is imagining him kicking someone in the head with that.

 

They wouldn’t survive.

 

Ochako swallows and stands back up.

 

“Moving on!” Midoriya continues cheerfully, setting his foot back down on the ground after the spikes recede. He pats his pant leg. “Feel,” he offers.

 

Ochako raises an eyebrow. The charcoal, off-black pants have a single stripe of dark green fabric running down the outside of his legs. They look more like dress pants than something a hero would wear, especially with the leather belt. If he took the black knee pads off, Ochako could see Midoriya wearing those same pants out to dinner or a job interview.

 

She runs her hand across the fabric and lets out an exclamation of surprise. “Iida! Feel this! They’re so soft.”

 

Iida complies and Midoriya laughs.

 

“They look like business pants, right?” Midoriya asks. Ochako nods as she pulls away. “They’re actually made from a fabric that’s a mix between activewear and leggings.” He bends his legs at the knees. “Maximum comfort, fashion, and movement.”

 

“You really thought of everything,” Iida says. “I just told them to make me a suit of armor and something to protect my exhaust pipes.”

 

Midoriya chuckles again. “That’s fine, too. I’m sort of particular about this stuff. It isn’t everybody’s thing.”

 

“Keep going!” Ochako says, eyes wide. “I wanna know everything! Oh, crap, I feel like I should be taking notes. Do you think you could help me with modifications to my costume?”

 

“Oh!” Iida exclaims. “That’s a great idea, Uraraka-san. I do believe that at the end of this semester, we’ll have an opportunity to redesign our costumes. If you’d be willing to assist us, Midoriya-san, we’d very much appreciate it.”

 

“The students in the support department will be better help, I’m sure,” Midoriya answers with that smile that isn’t actually a smile.

 

Iida frowns.

 

Ochako opens her mouth to argue who cares, we want you, Midoriya, but All Might picks that exact moment to announce the start of the activity.

 

- - -

 

They’re doing some sort of Heroes versus Villains rip-off. Katsuki has played this game hundreds of times before. It isn’t anything new, although All Might’s rendering is slightly more complicated. Still, someone is the hero and someone is the villain. You use your quirks to win.

 

Katsuki feels pretty good about the entire exercise. He has both experience and a powerful offensive quirk backing him up.

 

“The first hero team is...” All Might pauses for dramatic effect as he pulls two names out of one of the paper bags. “Uraraka-chan and Midoriya-kun!”

 

Katsuki crosses his arms and smirks. He feels bad for whichever losers have to battle Izuku. And by bad, Katsuki means he doesn’t feel anything at all. Whoever they are, they have it coming.

 

“And the villain team going against them... Bakugou-kun and--“

 

Katsuki doesn’t even hear who his partner is. Not like it matters, anyway. He’s fucked.

 

 

 

 

Eleven years ago

 

 

“Who left Mic’s cage unlocked yesterday?”

 

It was Izuku.

 

Katsuki knows it was Izuku because they were both on duty yesterday and Katsuki left first.

 

“Izuku-kun?” the teacher asks, “You were on duty with Katsuki-kun, right? Do you know who left the cage unlocked?”

 

It was Izuku, but Izuku doesn’t even hesitate before turning to Katsuki, frowning, and saying, “Ah, I’m sorry, Kachan.” Izuku takes a deep breath and turns back to the teacher. “It was Kachan, sensei. I left a couple minutes early, so Kachan was supposed to close it. I’m sorry, I should have stayed longer.” Izuku bows his head.

 

“Bullshit!” Katsuki yells, shooting to his feet.

 

“Katsuki!” The teacher responds. “Watch your language and your volume. Sit back down this instance.”

 

Katsuki collapses back into his seat, but still growls out, “He’s lying.”

 

The teacher rolls his eyes.

 

“I’m--I’m not lying,” Izuku says, already on the verge of tears.

 

“You are! I’m the one who left first!”

 

“Katsuki!” the teacher hisses again. “Come out into the hallway with me.”

 

Katsuki follows because he has nothing else to do, each of his steps stomps against the thick carpet.

 

The teacher closes the door behind him and lets out a long sigh.

 

“Look, Katsuki-kun, I understand you feel bad about letting Mic escape--”

 

“Izu-kun let it out--”

 

“Let me finish, please.”

 

Katsuki exhales, but doesn’t say anything else.

 

“I understand you feel bad, but how do you think Izuku-kun feels now that you’ve accused him of lying?”

 

Katsuki raises an eyebrow. “I didn’t accuse him of lying,” he starts, crossing his arms. “He is lying.”

 

The teacher rubs the bridge of his nose. “Katsuki-kun, you’re going to be held responsible for your own actions. That’s how the world works. Since you left Mic’s cage open--“

 

“I didn’t leave the fucking cage open! ” Katsuki yells, slamming his hands to his sides. “Izu-kun did! ”

 

“Yelling at me isn’t going to make me believe you.”

 

It’s in that moment that Katsuki realizes for the first time,

 

They aren’t going to believe him.

 

It won’t matter what he does or what he says because,

 

They aren’t going to believe him.

 

They already believe Izuku’s lies.

 

All because of a fucking pet cuckoo bird named after Present Mic.

 

- - -

 

Tsubasa collapses to the ground, panting. “Izu-kun wins again? What is this, time six? Seven?”

 

“Eight,” Izuku corrects casually.

 

“The game isn’t fun anymore,” Tsubasa whines, fluttering his wings against the ground. “It’s only fun if we have a chance.”

 

Katsuki huffs out and crosses his arms. He steps up to Izuku and stares him down. “Are you cheating?” he asks. Katsuki may not know of a way to cheat in tag, but if anyone is capable of it, it would be Izuku.

 

Izuku just smiles up at him. “No, Kachan. Why would I cheat?”

 

Katsuki glowers and doesn't quite believe him. But, then again, Katsuki doesn’t quite believe anything Izuku says, anymore. “Let’s play again.”

 

“I don’t wanna,” Tsubasa whines.

 

“We’re playing again.”

 

Tsubasa groans. Izuku smiles.

 

 

It takes Katsuki three more games to figure out how Izuku--essentially quirkless, unathletic, the smallest of the class--keeps fucking winning. Distractions. That’s it. Izuku takes a step one way, but runs the other. He looks to the left, but jogs to the right. He warns Katsuki about something in his way when there isn’t anything. He tells Katsuki to stop because he’s twisted his ankle, but when Katsuki does, Izuku reaches forward and fucking tags him.

 

Distractions. Lies.

 

“Ka-chan,” Tsubasa groans. “That makes ten or something. We obviously can’t win.”

 

Katsuki ignores him and grabs Izuku by his collar. “You’re cheating,” he hisses through clenched teeth.

 

Izuku just blinks up at him, unfazed. “Am I, Kachan?”

 

“Yeah, you fucker. You do this--” he waves his free hand in the air “--this shit.”

 

Izuku smiles up at him and says like Katsuki’s teachers do whenever he can’t find the right words, “It’s okay, Kachan, take your time.”

 

Katsuki throws Izuku on the ground and Izuku’s smile fades. Tsubasa lets out a shriek and scurries away. “You lie. That’s cheating. And cheaters don't win, that’s what sensei always says.”

 

Izuku stands up slowly. When his eyes find Katsuki’s, Katsuki has to take a step back at what he sees there. “Are you telling me, I can’t win?” Izuku asks, voice unusually flat.

 

Katsuki swallows. “Y-yeah.”

 

Izuku frowns. “The problem is, Kachan...” He takes a step forward. “I can’t lose.”

 

Katsuki believes him.

 

Even if it’s the last thing Katsuki believes from Izuku.

 

 

 

 

Present day

 

 

“We need to come up with a plan,” the Suit of Armor says as he paces around the fake bomb. “Midoriya-san’s quirk, Pull, will be able to greatly assist him in obtaining the bomb. And Uraraka-san’s anti-gravity is a good counter to my own speed.”

 

Katsuki leans against the wall and inspects his nails. “There isn’t any point,” Katsuki states. “Izuku is going to win.”

 

The Medieval Cosplayer frowns. “The heroes definitely have the advantage. My quirk would be better suited for offense. However, there isn’t any point in giving up now.”

 

“You’re not understanding me, Sonic,” Katsuki hisses, “Izuku can’t lose. He literally can’t. He doesn't even need a quirk to win. The fact that he has two or three or however many the fuck he has by now just means that he can win better.”

 

Katsuki’s “partner” blinks in disbelief for a moment before adjusting his glasses. “Apologies, Bakugou-san, I am not understanding you. What do you mean by Midoriya-san can’t lose?”

 

Katsuki screams through gritted teeth and slams his fist against the wall. “I’ve been saying the same thing over and over again, Fast and Idiotic. Izuku. Can’t. Lose. He never has. He never will. It’s just a fact of life.”

 

The Two-Legged Car opens his mouth like he’s waiting for someone to stick a hook in there and fucking reel him in. “You... you really believe that,” he finally says.

 

“I don’t need to believe it when it’s Newton’s Fourth fucking Law, Sailfish.”

 

The Sailfish opens his mouth and sighs. “It appears you are completely convinced of this.” He clears his throat and taps the communication device in his ear. “All Might-sensei! Am I allowed to request a change of partner?”

 

After a moment of silence, All Might answers to both of them, “No, Iida-kun. Team-ups are assigned randomly to simulate real-world situations! The roster may not be changed after selections!”

 

The Whirry-in-Denial looks like he was expecting that answer. “Understood!”

 

“We’re going to lose,” Katsuki says again.

 

“There is no harm in trying!”

 

But Katsuki knows that there is harm in trying.

 

If you try, you can fail.

 

If you don’t try, you can’t fail.

 

- - -

 

“You think it’ll really work?” Uraraka asks, hopping from foot to foot, smiling wide.

 

Izuku nods. “I do. Iida-kun won’t expect it and I doubt Kachan will be a threat.”

 

“Alright!” She pumps a fist into the air. “We got this! Oh, oh! Why don’t we create codenames?”

 

Izuku claps his hands together. “That’s a great idea!”

 

“I’ll be Fourteen! Like the hero Thirteen, but a number higher. Get it?”

 

Izuku smiles. “I get it! Why don’t I be Fifteen, then? Just to keep it simple?”

 

“That’s perfect!”

 

And then Yagi announces that the heroes can begin.

 

“You ready?” Izuku asks Uraraka.

 

She extends a fist. “Yup.”

 

Izuku knocks his knuckles against hers and says, “Just remember, if you find their location, don’t initiate, just let me know. And no matter what I say on the comms, don’t react unless I say the keyword, fourteen.”

 

Uraraka nods enthusiastically. “Got it.”

 

 

They split up to search for the “villains”. Izuku takes the odd-numbered floors, one and three, while Uraraka takes two and four.

 

“Hey, Mido--sorry, Fifteen?” Uraraka whispers through the communication devices in their ears.

 

“Yes?” Izuku whispers back. He checks the next room, finds it empty, and moves on.

 

“You’ll tell me about the rest of your hero costume later, right?”

 

Izuku frowns at the question. “Of course I will. I said I’d tell you, didn’t I?”

 

Uraraka is quiet for a moment before she says, “I just--no, it’s fine.”

 

“What is it?” Izuku asks.

 

“No, it isn’t important.”

 

Izuku doesn’t like leaving things unsaid, but he isn’t going to push her. “Alright. I’ve cleared the first floor. How’s the second going?”

 

“Almost done.”

 

“I’m moving onto the third.”

 

“Cool!”

 

 

Uraraka finds them in a room on the fourth floor. Like Izuku predicted, both Iida and Katsuki are playing defense. Uraraka meets Izuku in the hallway and silently gestures at the room.

 

Izuku signs, “Do you know exactly where the bomb is located in the room?” Uraraka just stares at him. Realizing she can’t understand sign language, he drags her a down the hallway a bit and asks her the question verbally.

 

She nods. “It’s in the center. Iida is guarding it pretty well. I didn’t see Bakugou.”

 

“Alright. There’s another entrance, right?”

 

“Yeah, that side door.”

 

Izuku smiles. “You’ll use that one.”

 

“You’re sure you can do this?” Uraraka asks with tight lips. “We can always try something less... finicky.”

 

“Don’t worry, Fourteen. Planning and talking are my two strongest suits. Anyway, if it comes down to it, I can always use my quirk.”

 

Uraraka nods at that. “Right. Yeah, you’re right.” She exhales and puffs out her chest. “Alright! We’ve got this!”

 

- - -

 

“What do you mean the hero team wins?” one of them asks. Shouto doesn’t know, or care, which one its is. However, Shouto does want to know the answer to that question. He’s wondering the exact same thing.

 

“Er,” All Might begins sheepishly, looking between the screen and the sixteen expectant students. “They won?”

 

Someone else exclaims, “That’s not an answer! How’d they win?! What happened?! Tell us! All we saw was Midoriya enter the room, somehow draw Iida away, and did Bakugou even do anything, and then Uraraka just walked on in and won! What is that?”

 

All Might clears his throat. “Well, why don’t we just ask the four themselves to explain it?”

 

Shouto had watched the whole trial (only because he didn’t have anything better to do and Midoriya got first during the quirk aptitude tests). However, without audio, he was unable to discern the nature of their... “battle”.

 

Shouto knows what a battle is. It isn’t whatever that was. A battle is fists against flesh, knives against knives, quirks against quirks, fire against ice. That was two minutes long and nothing. No contact, no quirk usage, no pain. That, in no shape for form, could be called a “battle”.

 

But, Midoriya got first in the quirk aptitude tests. What Shouto can’t understand is, why didn’t he use it? If Shouto didn’t already know that his quirk is some sort of strength enhancement or telekinesis (he wasn’t paying enough attention during the aptitude test to figure out which it is), he would have guessed it was one of those invisible quirks. But Midoriya’s quirk isn’t invisible, which means he just didn’t fucking use it.

 

“We’re back!” Midoriya calls as they step through the doors. “What’s the next team-up?”

 

The room stares at him until a girl with pink skin and horns--Shouto thinks she might have been the same one who interrogated All Might just a minute ago--runs up to Midoriya and essentially attaches herself to his vest. “Midoriiiiiii,” she whines, tugging at his hero costume. “What happeeeeened? You have to tell us.”

 

Midoriya stands stock still for a moment with wide eyes before he smiles and gently peels her off of him. “Are you asking about the battle trial?” he asks her like adults have asked a four year old Shouto if he knows how to read, yet.

 

“Of course,” the girl whines. She pouts. “All Might kept the audio off and it was over before it even started. C’mon. Tell us.”

 

Over before it even started. That sounds about right to Shouto.

 

Yaoyorozu steps up--second place in the quirk aptitude test, another recommended student. “We’d just like an account of what went down,” she asks, much more reserved than the previous student.

 

Midoriya nods and smiles. He turns to one of the students next to him. “Iida-kun? Would you like to take it?”

 

He straightens his back and takes off his helmet. “I’ll do my best, Midoriya-san!” The room silences and listens. “In short, Midoriya-san distracted me so Uraraka-san could “disarm” the bomb. It was an unpredictable and extraordinary plan. I didn’t see it coming at all.”

 

Shouto takes a step forward. Then he takes another, and another. He takes enough steps forward until he’s only a meter from Midoriya. “What?” he asks. He thinks he might be glaring, or maybe his eyebrows are furrowed in confusion. A trivial detail. “That’s it?”

 

The student wearing a whole--goodness, the impracticality--suit of armor nods. “Yes, from my point of view, that is all that went down.”

 

“Is something the matter, Todoroki-kun?” Midoriya asks. Despite being a head shorter than Shouto, somehow Midoriya is still looking down on him.

 

“That’s not a battle,” Shouto answers. He tilts his chin up, refusing to let Midoriya get the upper hand.

 

Midoriya just smiles, again, and turns away a little bit. Giving up? No, Shouto can still feel that Midoriya’s attention is on him. “All Might-sensei?” Midoriya asks. “Exactly how long from the start of the timer did it take for us to clear this activity?”

 

After a moment, All Might says, “Three minutes and fourteen seconds.”

 

“And were there any injuries?”

 

“No, Midoriya-kun.”

 

Midoriya turns back to Shouto. “There are two types of battles, Todoroki-kun. Those you can win by talking your way through them, and those you can’t.” His voice is sweeter than honey, he’s smiling, but there’s something in his eyes that’s darker. A threat.

 

Shouto opens his mouth to respond, to say something, anything, but Yaoyorozu speaks up instead, “I was curious. Couldn’t you have easily passed with your quirk, Midoriya-san? Why didn’t you use it at all? I mean, your more pacifistic route is definitely an option, but what made you decide to take it?”

 

Midoriya’s eyes leave Shouto, and Shouto knows he’s lost his attention. Just like that, like he never really had any of it to start with.

 

“That’s a great question, Yaoyorozu-san! I don’t like relying on my quirk or physical combat--“

 

Shouto blinks as he tries to comprehend what Midoriya just said. Not relying on his quirk or physical combat? What else is there? Ranged combat? Wait, that’s still physical, isn’t it?

 

“--If you immediately start with combat,” Midoriya is continuing, unknowing to Shouto’s inner turmoil, “you have to end with combat. You don’t have any other options. However, if you start with talking--“

 

What? That’s his alternative? How is talking an alternative to quirks?

 

“--your fallback option is the combat. Does that make sense?”

 

No, Shouto wants to say, but he doesn’t.

 

“Sort of,” Yaoyorozu answers. “I understand it in theory, but I don’t see how you can use talking in replace of combat. I believe you, definitely, especially after watching your battle trial, but I don’t understand it. I apologize.”

 

Shouto doesn’t understand or believe him.

 

“No need to apologize, at all! All Might-sensei, if we have time and everyone is cool with it, could we watch the trial again, but with audio?”

 

“That’s a great idea, Midoriya-kun! We can check after everyone else has completed theirs. Now, let’s start the next trial!” All Might announces.

 

 

Shouto finishes his battle in sixty two seconds and with his quirk.

 

No, he isn’t proving a point or trying to spite anyone.

 

But when he comes back and Midoriya smiles and congratulates him, maybe then Shouto starts trying to prove a point and spite him.

 

 

When they’ve all finished, it’s the girl with horns who brings it up, again. “All Might-sensei! Can we watch Midori’s trial, now?!”

 

“Out of curiosity,” Midoriya begins, raising an eyebrow at the girl. “When exactly did I become Midori?”

 

“Just now! Well, like two hours ago, since the trials have taken a long time, but it was definitely recent!”

 

Midoriya nods. “Good to know, I suppose.”

 

All Might checks his watch. “Is anyone opposed to this?” When no one says anything he continues, “Uraraka-chan? Iida-kun? Bakugou-kun?”

 

“Go for it!” Midoriya’s partner exclaims.

 

“It is fine with me,” the student in a suit of armor answers.

 

“Just don’t stream my own audio,” the blonde grunts.

 

All Might nods and says, “I’m going to skip the planning phase, for timing purposes, and go straight to the interactions.”

 

They all huddle around the screens and stare expectantly until it starts.

 

On screen, Midoriya walks into the room with both the villains and the bomb. When the student in a suit of armor and Midoriya notice each other, Midoriya jolts and jumps almost a foot into the air.

 

“Ur-Uraraka-chan!” Midoriya exclaims, a hand at his ear. “I’ve found the villains! Fourth floor, northeast corner! Come quick!”

 

The kid in a suit of armor belts out a cheap evil laugh.

 

Some students in the class snicker or laugh. If Shouto was the kind of person to snicker or laugh, he probably would. He hears better evil laughs from his father on a daily basis.

 

He points a finger at Midoriya. “Hah!” he exclaims. “You may have discovered our location, but it’s currently two against one, hero! Good luck!”

 

Midoriya’s smile fades into a worried frown “Uraraka-chan?” he asks quietly. “Are you there?” Midoriya slowly sinks into himself, arms first, then shoulders. He looks up a little bit and says, “She-she isn't responding, Iida-kun. I’m... I’m scared.”

 

The kid in a suit--fuck it--Iida takes a step forward.

 

“Wait,” Yaoyorozu says. “Can you pause it, All Might? Do we have time to analyze this?”

 

All Might pauses it and looks like analyzing is the last thing he wants to do. “Uh, if you all want to, I suppose we can.”

 

Yaoyorozu nods. “Where is Uraraka-san, right now?”

 

“Here!” The girl exclaims, shooting a hand in the air.

 

Midoriya chuckles and says, “She’s waiting outside the other door, completely safe.”

 

“So, this is all acting?” Yaoyorozu asks.

 

Midoriya nods. “Yes.”

 

Someone lets out a wolf-whistle. “Shi-it. Maybe you should have gone into pro-acting instead of pro-heroing, dude. I seriously thought Uraraka was in real trouble.”

 

“As the person on the receiving end of Midoriya-san’s phenomenal acting, I vouch one hundred percent for his skills,” Iida says.

 

“Ah,” Midoriya starts. “I’m not really--“

 

His partner slaps the back of his head playfully. “Stop underselling yourself, Midori!” She exclaims with a pout.

 

Acting, huh?

 

That’s all it took?

 

After a moment, All Might starts it back up again.

 

Iida says, “I’m sure she’s fine, Midoriya-san! Your communication devices may just be malfunctioning.”

 

Midoriya lets out a breath so heavy it rattles his entire body. “It’s just--what if something happened to her? What if she got--“ Midoriya flinches and wraps his arms around his torso. “What if she got crushed, like what happened--like what happened during the entrance exam?”

 

Shouto feels the room tense. Someone lets out a quiet, “Oof”, and someone else whispers, “You three were were in the same arena, weren't you. Way to hit the heartstrings, bro.”

 

Iida sets the bomb down and steps up to Midoriya, his hands out in a pacifying manner. “It’ll be fine, Midoriya-san. We’ll get in contact with her. U.A. will keep her safe.”

 

Midoriya’s smile is a frown. “You--you think so?”

 

Iida nods emphatically and places a hand gently on Midoriya’s shoulder. “I do.”

 

“But--but if she’s trap--trapped somewhere, she only has fourteen seconds--“

 

Midoriya’s partner silently steps through the other door. She’s shaking a bit, but she manages to sneak over to the bomb and tap it as Midoriya says, “--of a lack of air before she falls unconscious. What if--what if she’s already--”

 

“The--the hero team wins!” All Might announces.

 

All Might stops the video, there.

 

Midoriya really did it.

 

He actually talked his way through the entire battle, without using his quirk once, without a single move of hand-to-hand combat.

 

Someone starts clapping. It’s some guy with blonde hair and an over-the-top sparkly get-up. He steps up to the front of the room, clapping with exaggerated motions. “Encore! Encore!” he announces, sparing a moment to flip his hair. “An amazing performance from our own Midoriya! Le talent! Let’s all give him a round of applause! Applaudissements! Encore!”

 

There’s a moment of hesitation before the room slowly joins in on the applause.

 

Shouto expects Midoriya to eat up the praise, to step into the spotlight with a smile on his face. Maybe he’ll even bow. It wouldn’t surprise Shouto.

 

What does surprise Shouto is that Midoriya is doing none of those things. Instead Midoriya is standing stock still, a perfect smile on his face, staring at no spot in particular.

 

He almost looks like a doll.

 

Once the applause has died down, Midoriya says a careful, “Thank you.”

 

“Yeah!” the horned girl exclaims like nothing happened. “Have you taken any acting classes, Midori?”

 

“Oh, no, I haven’t.”

 

“Well!” All Might booms. “This has been an enlightening conversation. However, you all must get changed and to lunch!”
Notes:

    Aaaaa I really like the idea of Todoroki Shouto, who was “trained” by his father in hand-to-hand and quirk combat trying to understand Midoriya Izuku, who was “trained” by his father to use words as weapons (roll credits lol). I was gonna hold back on their interactions, but then this chapter happened lol

Chapter 10: Nothing but a season in hell
Notes:

    So sorry for the delay y’all!! Depression and anxiety hit simultaneously and I got overwhelmed even though I had absolutely nothing to do oh boyo

    Me: I’m gonna make this chapter fluffy for once!!
    Izuku: haha that’s funny.

    Chapter title from “King Crack” by Danielle Dax.

Chapter Text

Uraraka takes one step into the cafeteria and stops in her tracks. “I can’t believe this. Again?”

 

“Again, what?” Iida asks, then follows her into the cafeteria. “Ah, yes. I do recall Aizawa-sensei saying something this morning about an adjusted schedule due to the battle trials. It looks like we won’t have a chance to meet with our friends in the other departments, quite yet.”

 

“I think we have a normal schedule tomorrow, so we should be able to see them!” Uraraka exclaims as they walk over to Lunch Rush.

 

“That’s great!” Izuku answers. They step into line and he continues, “Uraraka-chan, would you want to stay after school today to meet with the support department? Iida-kun, if you’re free, you can come too.”

 

Uraraka claps her hands and smiles. “I think that’s a great idea, Midori! Oh, I can call you Midori, right?”

 

“Of course! Let me check with my father.”

 

Izuku pulls out his phone as Iida announces, “Unfortunately, I already have plans, but I appreciate the offer! If you see Wakita-san, please tell her I say hello.”

 

DM -- Father

 

[Midoriya Izuku]

Could I please stay late after school, today?

It will likely only be for an hour, at the most.

 

[Father]

Of course! Just be home by dinner.

 

[Midoriya Izuku]

Will do! I’ll be home by 5:30.

 

Uraraka and Iida get their meals and then the three of them sit at the first open table they find. Uraraka seats herself right next to Izuku and Iida sits across from them.

 

“Did you have plans with your father?” Iida asks.

 

“Oh, no. He doesn’t have the best health, so I like being home for him. I do a lot of work around the house and make sure his medical equipment stays up and running, so I can’t stay out too late.”

 

”That is a valiant undertaking, Midoriya-san!” Iida exclaims.

 

“Wow! That’s so sweet of you! Does your mother work evenings, or something?”

 

“Oh, er.” Izuku hums for a moment, trying to think of the softest way to put this. “She passed away when I was born.”

 

Uraraka looks at Izuku with this frown on her face and wide eyes. When her eyes start to dampen, Izuku extends his hands and smiles. “It’s fine, Uraraka-chan. I never knew her. And my father was around a lot when I was a kid, so it wasn’t that big of a deal.”

 

“I’m sorry for bringing it up,” she pouts.

 

Iida clears his throat. “If Midoriya-san says it’s fine, I think we should believe him! Also, Uraraka-san, you may be making a bigger deal out of this than is necessary! I don’t think Midoriya-san felt bad until you did!”

 

Izuku smiles at Iida. Honestly, sometimes Iida is just what Izuku needs.

 

Uraraka nods. “Sorry, yeah, sorry, you’re right. I just couldn’t imagine living without my mom, you know?”

 

“I actually don’t know--“ Izuku starts.

 

Uraraka playfully punches him in the arm and chuckles. “That was actually funny, Izuku. I had no idea you had a sense of humor.”

 

Izuku tries not to overthink that, but suspects he’ll find himself lying in bed at two in the morning studying ways to have a better sense of humor.

 

Iida lets out a contagious, barking laugh and soon all three of them are laughing.

 

After they’ve settled down, Iida asks, “If you haven’t had any acting training, Midoriya-san, how did you learn to act so well?”

 

Truthfully, Izuku is acting all the time--right now, an hour ago, an hour in the future. He’s acted all his life and he’ll continue acting until he dies. Depending on how everything works out, he might even continue acting after that.

 

But, Izuku can’t just tell Iida that, so instead he says, “My father’s sort of a film nerd. I’ve been watching movies since I was a child. I probably just ended up picking up some things.”

 

Iida nods like he accepts that answer.

 

Uraraka says, “You were able to learn acting just by watching movies? That’s so cool! If you watched, like, a martial arts film, could you learn martial arts, too?”

 

Izuku hums for a moment, like he’s seriously considering the proposal, before he answers, “Most films involving combat are highly choreographed, so I think I’d need a more accurate example. Now, if I watched enough real fights, I might pick up a couple skills.”

 

Uraraka smiles. “That’s super cool, Midori!”

 

“I agree. On a slightly different note, I had never considered communication to be an important skills for heroes before this, outside of interacting with the press, of course,” Iida says with his hand on his chin. “The fact that it’s always been an option available is extremely eye opening.”

 

Uraraka claps her hands. “You’re right! You know how, like, some hero fights end with people getting hurt--even innocent civilians get hurt, sometimes! If heroes were to just talk to the villains instead of going straight to the--” she punches the air a couple times and makes dramatic sound effects “--maybe everyone could be a little safer!”

 

“Well,” Izuku starts slowly. Fuck. He’s spoken to soon. He fixes a smile over the worry that had started encroaching on his face. “I think that’s a great idea!”

 

“Yeah?” Uraraka asks with bright eyes.

 

Iida frowns. “However, I do know for a fact that I cannot act as effectively as Midoriya-san can. Either that would not be an option for me, or I would need additional training before I could execute that plan of action successfully.”

 

Izuku silently lets out a breath. That is exactly the point he had wanted to, but had been unable to make.

 

“Ah! You’re right!” Uraraka exclaims.

 

Izuku clears his throat, sits up straighter, and turns his body so he’s facing both of them, casually gathering both of their attention. “Words are powerful,” he starts, moving his hands with his syllables for emphasis. “They can do just as much, if not more, harm as help. It’s a careful sort of teeter totter. Just as easily as you could talk a villain down from killing a hostage, you could talk them up to killing themselves, as well.”

 

Uraraka and Iida both sit up straighter.

 

“But, you face this same danger with using quirks, as well. Words are just another type of tool. You yourself choose to either use them for good or bad.”

 

Iida adjusts his glasses. “You are extremely wise, Midoriya-san.”

 

Izuku flinches. “This is just my opinion, of course. I could get you a paper to back it up, if you--”

 

“Midori!” Uraraka exclaims with a pout. “You’re, uh, underselling? Yourself again!”

 

“Demeaning, might be the word you’re looking for, Uraraka-san,” Iida says.

 

Uraraka snaps her fingers. “Yes! Demeaning! You don’t have to do that whenever someone says something good about you! We’re saying good things about you because they’re true, Midori!”

 

“It really isn’t that big of a--”

 

Uraraka’s glare and the pulsating pink-blue of compassion emanating from her stops him in his track.

 

“Midoriya-san,” Iida says, more reserved than Izuku has ever heard from him before.

 

Izuku settles on smiling softly and saying, “Sorry.”

 

Uraraka opens her mouth, but just lets out a sigh. “Don’t--don’t worry about it, Midori. We just want you to be happy.”

 

Izuku doesn’t understand.

 

The only time he’s ever heard words even close to these are from his father, but then they were thrown at him--knives carefully aimed for maximum damage.

 

These words--these are honest.

 

It’s almost like they actually, seriously want him to be happy.

 

No, that’s impossible.

 

They’re probably lying, even if Empathy says otherwise.

 

Izuku smiles and says, “Of course. I understand. Thanks.”

 

They both smile back, and then Iida clears his throat and says, “Oh, Midoriya-san, I am curious about something.”

 

“Yes?”

 

“During the battle trials, Bakugou-san mentioned something about you having two or three quirks. I brushed it off, but I was wondering if you have any idea what he meant. As far as I am aware, a person can only have a single quirk.”

 

Izuku nods. “Research has proven that, at this moment in our evolution, we can only hold a single quirk. However--” Izuku smiles softly, “--research has also proved that a single quirk can act as multiples. The hero Dawn, for instance. She inherited the traits of her great-grandmother’s quirk and her mother’s. Her great-grandmother’s quirk was Aura. She could create small orbs of light. They weren’t incredibly powerful. Dawn’s mother could control the intensity of lights within her eyesight. Since Dawn inherited a combination of both these quirk called Light Control, she now has almost complete control of light. It is, of course, limited to her own line of sight and she doesn’t have any natural safeguards against it, so her hero costume is mostly support. She has many fighting styles her most unique and challenging being completely darkening the area and fighting blind. It requires immense skill and effectively incapaci--“ Izuku freezes and bites his tongue.

 

Fuck.

 

He was just supposed to answer the question, not go on a rant.

 

He can feel both Iida and Uraraka staring at him, judging him.

 

He can feel his heart yelling at him.

 

Uraraka smiles. “Wow, Midori! I don’t think I’ve ever heard you speak so much at once before!”

 

Izuku cringes. He hadn’t meant to. He just--got distracted--got caught up in his head.

 

“I’ve never heard of this Dawn, before, but her quirk is interesting,” Iida says. “Light creation and control.”

 

Izuku looks down at the table, waits for the but.

 

“Hey, hey,” Uraraka starts, “do you think Aizawa-sensei knows her? He’s an underground hero, right?”

 

Izuku looks back up. They aren’t going to... chastise him? “Uh...” Too ineloquent. He swallows. “He might, actually. Dawn works nights sometimes, so it’s highly plausible.”

 

Uraraka smiles kindly at him. He tries to convince himself it’s real. “You seem to know a lot about heroes, Midori! You knew about Aizawa-sensei, too, when no one else did!”

 

Izuku clears his throat. “Yes, well. To answer Iida-kun’s initial question--”

 

Uraraka shakes her head. “Why don’t we talk about heroes?” she asks.

 

Izuku blinks dumbly.

 

Uraraka cringes and asks, instead, “Do you want to talk about heroes?”

 

- - -

 

Tenya waits in silence for Midoriya to answer the question. He’s buzzing with energy, wants to push it, wants to know.

 

Does Midoriya want to talk about heroes?

 

What does Midoria want to talk about?

 

Who is Midoriya?

 

But Midoriya just stares at Uraraka for a solid couple seconds, face completely unreadable--like always.

 

Tenya opens his mouth to say something encouraging but Uraraka silently stops him in his tracks.

 

Right.

 

He shouldn’t ruin the moment.

 

“I--” Midoriya starts, then swallows.

 

Uraraka places a hand gently on Midoriya’s arm. “It’s okay, Midori,” she starts quietly. “You can tell us the truth.”

 

Midoriya’s eyes scan Uraraka like he’s looking for something. What that something is, Tenya doesn’t know. After another moment, Midoriya exhales, closes his eyes, and says, “Sure, we can talk about heroes. I’d like to answer Iida-kun’s question, first, though.”

 

Uraraka sighs and drops her hand away.

 

Tenya just frowns a tad and adjusts his glasses. Midoriya was close, he thinks, to opening up. Which means there’s a chance.

 

Uraraka shoots Tenya a look and he knows she’ll be texting him about this later.

 

Tenya doesn’t approve of talking behind Midoriya’s back, but they’re worried about him.

 

Midoriya doesn’t even really talk in front of their backs.

 

“Well,” Midoriya starts, “my quirk. It’s sort of like Dawn’s in the sense that it has multiple functions. Pull, you already know.”

 

Uraraka nods.

 

“The second is strength enhancement.”

 

Tenya remembers back to the entrance exam, back to Midoriya saying something like, I’m pretty strong, too, but that isn’t my quirk.

 

So it was his quirk?

 

Based on Uraraka’s frown, she’s thinking the same thing. She opens her mouth, and for a moment Tenya thinks she might bring it up, but then she just smiles and says, “That’s super cool, Midori! Sounds impressive! And really helpful!”

 

“The third and fourth,” Midoriya continues and Tenya’s heart drops, “Empathy and Regeneration.”

 

Tenya ignores the pit in his stomach, the burning feeling of acid eating away at what little of his meals he’s already swallowed. He ignores it, and instead asks Midoriya who his favorite hero his.

 

It’s Ignemium.

 

Why does that just make Tenya feel so much worse?

 

- - -

 

A few minutes later, Uraraka leans over the table to whisper, “Todoroki has been staring at you this entire time, Midori.”

 

Izuku glances at Todoroki. Izuku was aware of the fact, but had been attempting to ignore it. Todoroki’s been doing a crap job of hiding his staring, if he’s been trying at all. “Should I go talk to him?”

 

“No!” Uraraka answers, aghast. She leans backwards with wide eyes. “Todoroki is scary! You can’t just talk to him!”

 

Izuku looks back at Todoroki and raises an eyebrow. Scary? Scary is one of the last words he’d use to describe Todoroki. If anything, Todoroki is the one who’s scared. Every time Izuku’s seen his aura, he’s been some sort of worried or anxious or on-edge. Whenever someone moves too quickly or there’s a loud noise, Todoroki’s aura spikes bright enough that Izuku can feel it as long as they’re in the same room. Also, just today, whenever Todoroki turns a little too far to his left, a ribbon of white stabs through his aura: pain. He’s had it since he arrived to school this morning, which means it happened sometime before.

 

Izuku checks the time on his phone--there’s only a couple minutes left in lunch, anyway--and shrugs. “I suppose you’re right. He is sort of intimidating.”

 

“Sort of?” Uraraka shivers. “He’s been glaring icicles at you this entire time! He didn’t even have to look at his food to eat it! That’s hella intimidating, Midori!”

 

Izuku smiles at her and finishes eating.

 

Right.

 

That’s intimidating.

Mei is halfway between about-to-pack-up and starting-another-project when someone knocks on the door. Thinking it’s Power Loader (who else would it be at this hour?), she hastily cleans up her work station (by clean up, she means she tosses everything in her plastic bin, shoves it under the table, and slams her computer shut). “I’m just finishing up!” she yells.

 

She does one last scan-through of her station, finds nothing left but a couple loose bolts and scraps of fabric, and hurls herself over the rows of desk and to the door. Mei throws the door open and startles when she sees not Power Loader, but two first-year students. One is a boy with curly dark green hair and a polite smile.

 

“Izuku!” she exclaims, grabbing him by his wrist and pulling him through the door. “I wasn’t expecting you, but this is perfect! We have so much to talk about! Your costume! Present Mic’s--actually, wait, that isn’t my project, fuck--that Eraser-dude’s project! The fact that you aren’t in Support!”

 

Izuku doesn’t resist as she leads him to her station and drops him off indelicately on a stool. “Ah! I’m Hatsume Mei! I’m sure Ori has told you all about me! Oh, here,” she turns in circles aimlessly until she finds another stool. She drags it next to Izuku with a little too much force. “You can sit here!”

 

“Th-thanks,” the girl says with a weak smile. She sits down awkwardly, partially hiding herself behind Izuku.

 

“I’m Midoriya Izuku, although it sounds like you already knew that,” Izuku begins, extending his hand. Mei shakes his hand enthusiastically. “This is Uraraka Ochako-chan. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mei-chan.”

 

Mei brightens at the use of her given name and slides over to Ochako. “Ori told me about you too, Ochako!” Mei says, shaking her hand. “All three of you are sort of famous--especially you, Izuku!”

 

Mei drops Ochako’s hand and lunges over to her computer in three long steps. “How do you like your costume?” Mei asks him, already pulling up a blank document to take notes. She doesn’t particularly need it, seeing as she keeps most information in her head, but Power Loader said it’s best for “documentation purposes” to write stuff down.

 

Mei’s fingers dance across the keys without clicking any of them, energy needing to go somewhere.

 

“It’s great!” Izuku answers. “The magnets in the shoes could be stronger--” Mei writes that down, of course “--but I was expecting that. Strong magnets are fairly expensive.”

 

Mei frowns. “Not necessarily. The harder part is figuring out a mechanism to turn them off and on and somehow integrating them into the bottom of your boots...” Mei drones off to pull up the shared folder of the first-year costume schematics all the support students have access to. She stares at Izuku’s, pondering the challenge for a couple seconds before he interrupts her.

 

“Actually, Mei-chan, we’re here for a different reason.”

 

“Oh?” she asks, eyes widening with intrigue. She turns to them and leans forward. “What’s that? Ori did tell you I’m the engineering lead, after you--the design lead, for Eraser-dude’s costume, right?”

 

“Ah, she didn’t, actually. We were wondering if the support department could make some modifications to Uraraka-chan’s costume.” Izuku leans to the side so Mei can see Ochako.

 

“Uh--” Ochako takes a deep breath. “Yeah! Well, it isn’t super important, but the costume I got is a lot more form-fitting than I’m comfortable with. What I wanted is something more like a space suit, if that makes sense?”

 

Mei nods enthusiastically. “Yeah, totally! We can definitely do that! Isoshi is my class’s resident fashion and runway specialist, his words. I’m sure he’d love to help!”

 

Ochako smiles and claps her hands together. “Really? That’s awesome! I’d be so happy.”

 

Mei smiles at her and says, “Isoshi is actually the one who designed and crafted your vest and jacket, Izuku.”

 

“Really?” he asks. “Did they have support students come in before the semester started, or did he do it all the first day?”

 

“A bit of both. There were optional workshop days over break we could attend. I, of course, went to all of them.” Mei puffs out her chest and smiles wide. “Which means I got to work on all of your hero costumes! Bow down to me as you don the babies I birthed with my own two hands!” She lets out a haughty laugh. After a moment, Izuku joins in, and a moment after that, so does Ochako. Once they’ve finished, Mei dramatically wipes tears from her eyes and says, “Now, I can either give you Isoshi’s number or talk to him myself, Ochako. Which would you prefer?”

 

“If you’re willing to ask him, that would be great!” she answers.

 

“Now...” Mei steps up on top of her own stool and crouches on it. She places her elbows on her knees, her chin in her hands, and leans forward to make eye-contact with Izuku. “Izuku, let’s talk about our project.”

 

Izuku smiles up at her, not intimidated at all--good. Some people are, which isn’t good. Mei would be properly disappointed if he were.

 

“I can only stay until five, and I’d like to show Uraraka-chan my hero costume before I leave, but for now I can email you my rough design and we go over that for a bit,” he says.

 

Mei smirks. “Awesome.”

 

- - -

 

They spend an hour talking about Aizawa-sensei’s project, using words Ochako doesn’t understand but sort of recognizes, and complicated diagrams she can’t really wrap her head around. Ochako does, however, come out of it with the knowledge that they’re planning on making his goggles more protective and getting Wakita to program some sort of fancy screen for them. Oh! And they’re going to do something to his suit, while keeping it light-weight and casual. They said light-weight and casual a lot.

 

Midori finally convinces Mei that they’ll have ample time to design later--Ochako thinks Mei is going to find them during lunch tomorrow, but she isn’t positive, it’s all a blur--and Mei goes with them to the locker rooms, where their hero costumes are being stored. Mei walks up to locker number eighteen without hesitation and opens it up.

 

“Mei-chan...” Midori starts, a small pout on his face. “Why do you know my seat number?”

 

Mei just lets out a laugh. “Why wouldn’t I, Izuku? Well here it is, the rumoured costume-that-isn’t-a-costume. Made fifty-percent by Isoshi and me, and the other fifty-percent by a professional. He isn’t important, though.”

 

Mei starts laying out the costume piece by piece, side-by-side. “What are we doing? Just an unboxing? Ooooo--welcome to U.A.’s support channel, in which I, Mei, and my trusty assistants, Izuku and Ochako, unbox and analyze various students’ costumes! Now, let’s start with Izuku’s costume himself! Izuku, would you like to take the lead?” Mei announces the entire bit like she’s actually being recorded and then passes an invisible microphone over to Midori, who takes it with deft hands.

 

“Why yes, Mei-chan, I would love to. In our previous video, we covered my boots and pants--” Midori points at the two items with his non-invisible-microphone-holding hand. “However, we have yet to see the belt!”

 

Mei claps her hands a couple times. “The belt! Of course!” Mei picks it up. It’s just a black, sort of thick leather belt with a buckle resembling that of an airplane’s. Mei brings it up to Ochako. “See this button here?” She points at a small button on the inside of the buckle with her thumb. Ochako nods. When Mei clicks it, the beginning of a rope gently pops out of a small opening in the belt.

 

“The belt,” Midori begins, still pretending to hold the microphone, “has a thin, but strong rope threaded within it. With the click of a button, the rope is unlocked and you can pull it out. There is very minimal friction, so extraction is easy. Also, returning the rope to its storage is automated, so if you want it back in the belt, it will only take two seconds.”

 

“On average,” Mei begins with a finger in the air, “two point one seven, actually.”

 

Midori smiles and checks his phone for a second before continuing. “The turtleneck is interwoven with protective material. It doesn’t stand up to kevlon, but it’s close.”

 

“Ex-cuse me?” Mei exclaims. She picks the turtleneck up off the floor and cradles it to her chest. “This baby has my heart and sole interwoven into it! Don’t just dismiss her like that!”

 

“I apologize, Mei-chan, would you like to explain it?”

 

Mei smiles. “Well, this baby is interwoven with protective material, of course! It may not be as strong as kevlon, but it’s way more comfortable and it’s hella close!”

 

“Wait, but--” Ochako starts, face scrunched up in confusion.

 

Midori just laughs.

 

“The vest!” Mei exclaims, still hugging the turtleneck. “Do the vest, next!”

 

Midori clears his throat. “Well, the vest, as you can see, is fairly normal, however--”

 

“The inside layer of fabric,” Mei interrupts, eyes lit up with excitement, “uses a similar technology to the camouflage older military fighter jets use. It won’t make him completely invisible, but it’ll confuse the fuck out of anyone trying to find him.”

 

“The outside does the opposite,” Midoriya adds on. “It has subtle, reflective pieces here--” he runs his hand across the slightly shinier cuts of the vest--the shoulders and a stripe down each side.

 

Ochako asks, “What if you don’t want to draw attention or go sorta-invisible?”

 

Midori smiles. “Take the vest off.”

 

Ochako snorts and Mei laughs.

 

“You’d lose all those pockets, though,” Mei says.

 

Midori shrugs. “You gotta do what you gotta do... The pads are just pads. Light-weight, flexible, removable. I’m considering getting an even thinner set, maybe something that will fit under my clothes.”

 

Mei shakes out the turtleneck and furrows her brows. “Yeah Isoshi was complaining about that, if I remember correctly. The elbow pads don’t really go with the turtleneck, or something.”

 

Ochako chuckles, imaging some kid sewing a shirt and complaining about how it looks underneath elbow pads. Support department problems, she supposes.

 

“The jacket!” Mei exclaims. “I actually don’t know anything about it at all. Isoshi wouldn’t let me touch it.”

 

Midori reaches into the locker and takes out an item Ochako hadn’t realized was left--a dark suit jacket--by the hanger. “It’s just a jacket,” he says with a shrug.

 

Mei frowns and carefully places the turtleneck back onto the ground. “Just a jacket,” she mocks. “Isoshi spent three entire days making that, bitch. It isn’t just a jacket. Give it here.”

 

For a moment, Midori looks like he’s going to put it back into the locker, but then Ochako makes eye-contact with him.

 

She tries to convey, through her entire being, silently, that you told me you’d tell me about your costume.

 

Midori smiles at her, takes off his U.A. jacket, and puts on his costume jacket. It fits him perfectly. It’s almost more like he was born for the jacket than the jacket sewn for him. “It isn’t too special,” he starts, spinning in a slow circle so they can see all sides. Even like this--with his grey, school uniform underneath it, he looks sharp enough to be All Might’s lawyer himself. Midori runs his fingers through his hair and Mei gasps.

 

“Izuku, that’s illegal. I may be gay as fuck but you should not legally be allowed to wear that jacket without a warrant or something,” Mei says, covering her eyes with her hand and peering in between her fingers. “Take it off this instance.”

 

Midori raises an eyebrow but compiles.

 

Ochako blushes.

 

“It’s made out of a similar protective material as the turtleneck,” Midori explains as he hangs it back up, “and the entire piece is semi-reflective. It’s definitely supposed to be eye-catching.”

 

“Well you caught my eyes,” Mei notes.

 

Ochako tries not to choke on her next breath.

 

Midori just smiles. “I’m happy to know it works. It has hidden pockets, within the sleeves and the torso and the back, as well.”

 

“Is that everything?” Ochako asks looking at the pieces on the ground instead of at Mei or Midori.

 

“I mean, I have gloves, too, but they’re just gloves. They have some extra grip on palms and you can use them on a touch-screen, but that’s it.” Midori checks his phone. “Oh, it’s almost five, I need to be heading out.”

 

Mei pouts. “Already?”

 

“It’s been two hours, Mei-chan.” Midori smiles. “It was fun hanging out with both of you. Thanks.”

DM -- Iida Tenya

 

[Uraraka Ochako]

Bleeeggghhhhh

Iida idk what to do

Like Midori is so nice and sweet but

 

[Iida Tenya]

I don’t think there’s anything for us to do.

 

[Uraraka Ochako]

He lied about the thing at the arena remember?

 

[Iida Tenya]

Yes.

 

[Uraraka Ochako]

Bleegggghhhhhh

 

[Iida Tenya]

Do you want to talk to him about it?

 

[Uraraka Ochako]

No no

We’ve only really known him for a couple days really

Maybe hell open up??

 

[Iida Tenya]

Maybe he will.

 

[Uraraka Ochako]

It could just be that he isn’t super comfy with us yet

Idk

 

[Iida Tenya]

That is a reasonable hypothesis!

 

[Uraraka Ochako]

Hhhhhhh maybe

Like he’s so nice and he sacrificed himself for me during the exam and

I think he’s a really good guy!!

 

[Iida Tenya]

I do agree with you. Despite his flaws, Midoriya has always, in the general scheme of things, done what is good.

Or, at least, that is what I would like to think.

 

[Uraraka Ochako]

The battle trials were a little

But he just did that to make sure we won!

 

[Iida Tenya]

Yes, his methods were unique, but he succeeded.

 

[Uraraka Ochako]

I just hope hell be alright

 

[Iida Tenya]

Me too.

Chapter Text

Shouta sits on the couch in the teachers’ lounge, forcing down hours-old black coffee that’s no longer hot nor cold and watching this morning’s battle trials from his laptop.

 

All Might steps into the room while Sero is taping the bomb to the ceiling and Ashido is setting traps with her acid. Shouta thinks they make a near-perfect defensive team. He’ll probably partner them up again in the future.

 

“Ah, Aizawa-sensei,” All Might says, interrupting Shouta’s already slippery concentration.

 

Shouta sighs and pauses the video. “Yeah?”

 

“You wouldn’t happen to be watching the battle trials, would you?”

 

Shouta blinks at him and answers, “I am.”

 

All Might chuckles awkwardly, just as awkwardly as he does everything in his... thin form, or whatever he’s calling it. “Have you, er, watched Midoriya-kun and Uraraka-chan’s yet?”

 

Shouta narrows his eyes. Why the favoritism? “Yeah.”

 

When Shouta doesn’t elaborate any further, even after a minute of extremely uncomfortable silence, All Might asks, “Uh, what did you think about it?”

 

“Could’ve been worse. Could’ve been better.”

 

All Might clears his throat and looks everywhere except Shouta. “That’s... it?”

 

Shouta raises an eyebrow. “What more do you want? A speech of every pro versus con? An in-depth character analysis? Ask Nedzu if you’re that interested.”

 

All Might flinches and holds back a cough. “No--no thank you.”

 

Shouta sighs into his coffee. “Your choice.”

 

“It’s just...” All Might looks to the side and rubs the back of his neck. Sometimes Shouta cannot comprehend the fact that this man is All Might. They’re almost polar opposites. “Do you think it was weird?”

 

“I don’t have time for this,” Shouta grunts. “If you want to unpack Midoriya’s performance, do it with someone else. Hell, do it with Midoriya himself. I’m busy.”

 

All Might turns to leave, but stops in the doorway. “I just...”

 

Shouta grunts. “Not everyone solves their problems by punching them, All Might.”

 

“So, he’s fine?”

 

Shouta visibly cringes.

 

Midoriya’s solution was wonderfully thought out. Unique, hard to catch, subtle. But Shouta doesn’t know how Midoriya was capable of successfully pulling it off. Midoriya, the kid who formed an alliance out of his testing arena, the kid who noticed Shouta while he was stealthing, who smiled at the threat of expulsion, who didn't hesitate when Shouta asked him for two hundred dollars.

 

Something feels off... Shouta just doesn't know what.

  

“I never said that,” Shouta answers.

 

All Might leaves after a quiet, almost dejected, “I see.”

 

- - -

 

Izuku sees their collective aura before he sees them. Greed. A pulsating purple. The press.

 

Izuku takes a grounding breath, glances at his reflection in the nearest window, runs his fingers through his hair even though he knows the action is useless, and walks up to the gates of U.A.

 

“Excuse me!” the closest reporter yells, sticking a microphone in his face like they’re afraid he’s going to run away. Honestly, he wants to.

 

“Yes?” he asks, batting his eyelashes and smiling up at the reporter. He doesn’t look at the camera, he looks at her.

 

She smiles a fake smiles and asks, “What’s it like having All Might as a teacher?”

 

All Might. Of course.

 

The question is extremely presumptuous--how does she know he's ever had All Might as a teacher? There are over thirty classes at U.A. There's no way All Might has managed to teach all of them in such a short period of time.

 

Two possible responses fly through Izuku’s mind immediately. The first one is a snarky, condescending: Unfortunately, U.A. has only been in session for two days, and as All Might isn’t teaching my homeroom, I haven’t gotten a chance to learn under him. I apologize. And then he’d bow and walk off. He doubts she’d try to stop him.

 

Izuku goes with his second option, “Ah, well, I’m not a hero student, you see.” He rubs the back of his neck and looks down a little bit, his smile fading. “I’m only in the general education course, so I don’t think I’m going to--going to ever get All Might as a teacher.” He holds his arm with his other hand, bites his lower lip, and lets tears well up in his eyes.

 

The reporter flounders for a couple seconds before sighing and setting a hand on his shoulder. “Sorry, kid,” she says curtly.

 

Izuku shakes his head and shuffles off. He hears the reporter whisper a harsh delete that footage to her cameraman. As he’s walking away, she asks someone else, “Are you a hero student?”

 

They reply with a confused, “No,” and she lets them go without interviewing them. 

 

 

Aizawa starts the class with a short, “We have another activity, today.”

 

The entire class tenses in anticipation.

 

“Class representative elections,” Aizawa says.

 

A majority of them erupt into excited cheering about something normal, for once.

 

“Now,” Aizawa starts, silencing them. “I don’t care how you decide, but by the end of this period, you need one or two representatives. I’m going to take a nap. Have fun.”

 

- - -

 

Shouta climbs into his sleeping bag and collapses into his favorite corner. Why is it his favorite corner? Simple. It’s relatively comfortable and it gives him a perfect view of the entire classroom. He can lay here, pretending to be asleep, and spy on them. It’s perfect.

 

The class is chaos for a solid thirty seconds until Iida stands up and announces, “Why don’t we handle this rationally? A vote is the obvious solution, isn’t it?”

 

“But we’ve only known each other for two days!” Kaminari exclaims. “We’re all just going to vote for ourselves!”

 

Midoriya says, “We could each give a speech. Maybe half a minute long?”

 

Ashido and Uraraka simultaneously exclaim, “That’s a great idea!” And the decision is made.

 

 

Aoyama starts first. He spouts some words about how he’s perfect and sparkly and if they vote for him, he’ll give them all a small jar of glitter.

 

The next two rows pass roughly the same way, no one really saying anything about policies or what actually makes them a good candidate. Bakugou doesn’t say anything other than, "Vote for me," while glaring intensely at everyone except, oddly enough, his own column of seats.

 

It’s so boring Shouta is tempted to actually fall asleep.

 

Asui’s speech is decent. She states that she has no experience, but that her policy of honesty makes her a good candidate. Kirishima’s charisma and energy might win him a vote or two.

 

And then Midoriya steps up.

 

“My name is Midoriya Izuku. I was class representative each year of junior high, so I do have some prior experience.” He does a good job of projecting his voice and making eye-contact with every member of his audience. He definitely has experience, at least with public oration. “As your representative, I’ll ensure to listen to all of your comments and requests and keep an open line of communication between the students and the council. I will act as your voice--not as some sort of dictator or external body. My job will be to make sure everyone in this class feels comfortable and has the same level of knowledge as everyone else. Please vote for me.” He smiles and bows. “Thank you.”

 

Uraraka stands up and cheers enthusiastically. “That was great! You have my vote, Midori!”

 

Midoriya turns red and shuffles back to his seat.

 

Iida’s speech is much like Asui’s, but louder.

 

Midoriya translates for Kouda and Tokoyami goes up there just to say he doesn’t want to be representative.

 

Mineta sort of skips up to the podium, a hop to his step.

 

“I’m Mineta! My quirk is this--“ he pulls one of the spheres off his scalp and sticks it to the surface of Shouta’s desk. “I can control how sticky they are! Now, my policies. As representative, my first order of policy will be to improve U.A.’s dress code! We’ll start by making the girls’ skirts shorter!”

 

- - -

 

Izuku has always been conscious of the dark lavender aura surrounding Mineta, swirling like a series of ropes knotted around each other. Sometimes it’s lighter--almost pink--just a single rope. Other times it isn’t even there at all.

 

But today?

 

It’s so thick the ropes are threatening to entangle Izuku, threatening to tie him up and pull him into the lavender haze of perversion.

 

“And I’ll make Yaoyorozu my vice-representative,” Mineta continues with a wide smile like he’s proud of the fact.

 

Izuku feels her startle. He knows she’s turning yellow with anxiety or fear.

 

“W-what?” she asks from two rows behind Izuku, her voice shaky and a little higher than normal.

 

The lavender only gets thicker. “Of course!” Mineta announces, hands on hips. “There isn’t a better candidate!”

 

Izuku slowly raises his hand, having to physically push through the cloud.

 

“Yes, Midoriya?” Mineta asks like he couldn’t care less.

 

Izuku turns to Aizawa, where he’s currently watching the interaction silently from the corner of the room. “Aizawa-sensei?” Izuku asks. Aizawa doesn’t stir. Izuku continues, “May I be excused to use the restroom?”

 

Aizawa grunts out a barely audible, “Fine,” which receives a shriek from Hagakure, who insists he’s supposed to be asleep.

 

Izuku doesn’t listen. He dodges Mineta’s aura and makes a beeline for the bathroom.

 

- - -

 

When Izuku finally comes back, he manages to hear the tail end of Todoroki’s speech through the door.

 

“Vote for me,” Todoroki says. “I’ll raise our class to the top.”

 

Everyone claps politely and Izuku sneaks to his seat while Yaoyorozu glides over to the podium. Despite some underlying anxiety, she still has the confidence of someone who’s comfortable being at the front of the class. She places her hands on the desk and raises her head. “My name is Yaoyorozu Momo. I was president of my middle school’s book club, so I have experience organizing a group, events, and coordinating with a school’s administration.” She smiles softly. Her eyes never reach Izuku’s--Mineta’s--column of seats.

 

Izuku knows Mineta is watching her, even if his back is to him.

 

“I will take it upon myself to keep communication lines open between us and administration. It will also be my duty to ensure everyone feels safe at all times. I will draw upon my prior experiences and all the knowledge I have gained throughout my life to make this a wonderful year for us all.” She bows her head. “I hope you’ll allow me the honor of serving as your class representative. Thank you.”

 

Mineta says something so close to Uraraka’s kind, sweet, “You have my vote, Midori!”, except lavender and twisted, that Izuku almost throws up again.

 

After Yaoyorozu takes her seat, Iida shoots to his feet. “Well! If that’s everyone, let us commence the voting!”

 

 

Jirou reads the votes aloud while Iida writes the tallies up on the board.

 

When they’re finished, Izuku is surprised.

 

He tied with someone.

 

Now, he voted for Yaoyorozu himself, so he isn’t that surprised, but five votes each is enough to get them both elected. No one else got more than two.

 

After discussing it with Aizawa, Yaoyorozu gives Izuku the representative position, taking the vice-representative position herself.

 

- - -

 

“Congratulations, Midoriya-san!” Iida announces as soon as the class is over.

 

Iida’s already told him congratulations four or five times--at the end of every class of the day--and Izuku’s starting to wonder why.

 

“Thank you, Iida-kun,” Izuku answers with the same smile he’s given him the previous times.

 

Iida places a hand on Izuku’s shoulder and makes eye-contact. Izuku pauses packing up his desk for lunch. “Honestly, Midoriya-san,” Iida continues with a soft smile that reaches his eyes. “You’ll make a great class representative.”

 

Izuku opens his mouth to say something about how Iida shouldn’t raise his expectations too high, but then Uraraka skips up from behind Iida and slams her hands on Izuku’s desk, smiling wider than Izuku’s ever seen from her. Iida pulls back in a sharp motion.

 

“It’s lunch!” she exclaims, her gaze switching between them faster than Izuku can keep track.

 

“Yes, it is,” Iida states simply.

 

“We can see Hano and Wakita and everyone else!”

 

Iida’s eyes brighten in recognition.

 

They’ve all kept in fairly constant contact through texts, except for Saza, who’s only been online once or twice, and Izuku himself. Izuku didn’t consciously distance himself from them, but there were many days when he was too busy to check in, and a number of conversations he felt too... personal for his input.

 

“That’s great,” Iida says, already turning to the door.

 

Izuku finishes packing up his stuff and stands up. “I’m excited,” he remarks offhandedly. He thinks he means it.

 

Uraraka smiles at him and hooks her arm through his elbow while the three of them walk to lunch.

 

- - -

 

As soon as they step into the cafeteria, a familiar voice yells, “Midoriya! Iida! Uraraka!”

 

“Wakita-chan!” Izuku exclaims.

 

Wakita barrels into him and hugs him so hard he struggles to breath for a moment. “You have no idea how pissed I was when I heard you showed up at Support yesterday and I wasn’t there! You should’ve called me or something! I would’ve run over!”

 

Izuku smiles up at her. “I just wanted to meet some other Support students. I already knew you, so I didn’t think about it. I apologize, I’ll reach out to you next time.”

 

Wakita pulls back and smiles a wide smile. “That’s great. Mei told me you met. How’d you like her?”

 

“She’s awesome! I’m really happy she’s my partner! She seems really enthusiastic about it.”

 

Wakita nods. “Yup, sounds like her.”

 

Izuku raises an eyebrow. “How long have you two known each other?”

 

Wakita laughs. “Like three days and change? Yeah, three days, babe. Sorry, time flies when you program until four in the morning. Ah! Iida! Uraraka!” Wakita wraps the two of them in hugs in turn and then asks, “Have you all said hi to Suda, yet? And Saza? Hano? Hitamoro? Come on, we have to go.”

 

Ochako chuckles. “We just got here, Wakita! We haven’t had time to get our food yet, let alone find all of them!”

 

Wakita smiles and takes one step back. She spins around, cups her hands around her mouth, and yells, “Oi! Arena failures! The three losers are heeeeeere!”

 

Half the cafeteria silences and stares at them; the other half ignore her.

 

“I’ll go save y’all some seats at Suda’s and find Saza and Mei,” Wakita tells them. She gives them a small mock salute and heads off.

 

“I’ll help her out,” Izuku says. “You guys get your lunch.”

 

Izuku jogs up to Wakita’s side. “Saza-chan doesn’t eat lunch with you all?” he asks.

 

Wakita eyes him for a moment before shaking her head. “Nah. She likes to sit alone and get homework done, the nerd.”

 

“And Mei-chan?”

 

Wakita waves a hand. “Different every day. She’s trying to make connections, I think.”

 

Izuku nods in approval. “Hitamoro-kun eats with you?”

 

“Yup.” Wakita smirks. “Surprised, ain’t ya’? So was I. Apparently Hano and they made some sort of bet. Hitamoro lost. And now--” she holds out a hand, showcasing the table of the three students. Suda and Hano wave at his arrival. Hitamoro raises an eyebrow in some sort of move of appraisal and immediately turns back to their plate of...

 

Izuku can’t even comprehend what it is. He thinks, just maybe, if his eyes aren’t playing tricks on him, it might be fried rice with chocolate syrup and bananas on top.

 

Hitamoro had sent pictures of their meals to the chat before, when no one believed them. But Izuku still hadn’t honestly believed it.

 

Hitamoro was serious.

 

“Midoriya-san!” Hano greets. “Have you gotten lunch yet?”

 

Izuku holds up his packed lunch.

 

“Ooo, traditional. I’m pretty sure Hitamoro tried to pack their own lunch, once, but the police arrested them for disturbing the peace.”

 

Hitamoro snickers and Suda chuckles. “That was a good one, Hano,” Hitamoro says as Izuku sits down. “But you’re totally ignoring the fact that you’re constantly arrested because the police mistake your big-ass ego for public quirk usage.”

 

Hano hides his laugh behind a hand. “You should take that back, before you regret it,” he says without any weight.

 

“Fuck you, pretty boy.”

 

Suda looks to Izuku and asks quietly, “How’ve you been?” Hitamoro and Hano silence at the sound of Suda's voice and immediately go back to eating.

 

“I’ve been pretty good. How about you all?”

 

“I told them about my quirk,” Suda says, “so it’s okay. You don’t have to lie for me.”

 

Izuku looks at Suda, tries to remember when exactly he lied for him, and can’t.

 

“Found Saza!” Wakita announces, dropping Saza on the bench next to Izuku.

 

“This is completely unnecessary, Wakita. Is there any reason for me to be here?” Saza grunts out.

 

“You’re our only friend in business, so yes!” Wakita exclaims. “Off to find Mei!”

 

Saza huffs out and pokes her food with her chopsticks.

 

“You gonna eat that?” Hitamoro asks.

 

“Gross. I’m not going to sacrifice my food to you, Hitamoro.”

 

Hano snorts. “She said sacrifice.”

 

“I’ll sacrifice you,” Hitamoro hisses. “Someone get me the chalk. I can kill him with a chopstick if it comes down to it.”

 

“Bet,” Hano says.

 

“Please,” Saza groans, dropping her head in her hands. “Sacrifice me.”

 

Uraraka plops down next to Hano and Iida sits down next to Suda. “Hano!” Uraraka exclaims. “It’s been--”

 

She’s interrupted by a loud siren along with the message by a pre-recorded Nedzu, “This is not a drill. Entering Lockdown Procedure C-twenty-nine. Please calmly make your way to the underground shelter. This is not a drill. Entering Lockdown Procedure C...” The message continues on repeat.

 

All of them except for Hitamoro and Suda shoot to their feet.

 

C-29.

 

Lockdown.

 

Izuku has a set of lockpicks in his hands before he realizes it.

 

“Lockdown?” Uraraka asks, having to yell over the siren, the announcement, and the chaos which has taken over the cafeteria. “What’s going on?”

 

Iida adjusts his glasses and says, “Code C-twenty-nine means that someone has broken into the property, but that it is a low-level emergency. The heroes have likely already taken care of the issue.”

 

Uraraka visibly calms down.

 

“Aw, darn,” Hitamoro says, still eating their lunch, “I was hoping for some real drama.”

 

Lockdown. Locked.

 

Izuku grips the lockpicks tighter as the crowd rushes around them to the nearest exit.

 

“Why is everyone still freaking out?” Hano asks.

 

Iida huffs. “Not everyone has memorized the student handbook, unfortunately.”

 

Closed door. Lockdown. Lock.

 

“Midori? Are you okay?”

 

Izuku tries to breathe. Everything is fine. It’s a low-level emergency, just like Iida said.

 

“We should let everyone know,” Izuku manages to say over his pounding heart. “They’re panicking. Someone could get hurt.”

 

The metal picks dig into his palms hard enough to draw blood, but Izuku doesn’t care.

 

“That’s a great idea!” Uraraka exclaims.

 

“It isn’t, really,” Saza says, looking Izuku right in his eyes. “Your risk is over fourty percent and the reward is minimal, assuming you mean using the P.A. system in the teachers’ workroom.”

 

A majority of the students in the cafeteria have already evacuated.

 

Izuku nods. “I do.”

 

Iida nods. “You would have to travel against the flow of the crowd. It sounds dangerous.”

 

“We split up. You all try to settle the ones over here and I’ll make my way to the workroom.”

 

Saza frowns. “This is stupid, Midoriya-san.”

 

Hitamoro steps up. “Did someone say high risk? That’s literally my vigilante name, guys. I’m in.”

 

Saza glares at them. “No.”

 

Hitamoro sticks out their tongue and grabs Izuku’s wrist.

 

“We’ll do it.” Izuku is sure. He’s sure he’ll do anything to avoid going to the lockdown shelter, even if it means this.

 

Iida places a heavy hand on both of their shoulders before they go and says, in all sincerity, “Good luck. Godspeed.”

 

“Don’t get hurt, Midori! Hitamoro!” Uraraka calls.

 

“Give me a cute nickname, Urachan!” Hitamoro calls out.

 

“Uh... crap, uh... Hitakun!”

 

Izuku power walks out of the cafeteria, Hitamoro half-dragging him, Izuku half-dragging Hitamoro, entire body jittery with nerves.

 

 

There are people. Too many people. All he can see is yellow. The yellow seeps into and past his skin, through his muscles and bones, into his bloodstream until he’s just as yellow as everyone else.

 

Fear.

 

He’s afraid.

 

Is he afraid or are they? He doesn't know anymore.

 

He has to--he has to get to the workroom. He can’t remember why. He can’t even remember why he’s afraid. All he knows is that he’s supposed to get to the teachers’ workroom.

 

Izuku is only semi-aware of pushing his way through the crowd, of trying to move against the flow.

 

The yellow suffocates him until he breathes it in instead of air.

 

The workroom is--it’s only a few doors away, Izuku thinks.

 

An elbow jabs into his face, but he feels the pain in his hands, instead, which is weird but he can see the room now so he doesn’t care. He shoves his way past another blob of yellow and slams into the door. People continue rushing past him, but he tries the handle regardless.

 

It’s locked.

 

Locked.

 

Lockdown.

 

Afraid.

 

Izuku chokes on nothing, bracing himself against the door, when he feels cool metal against the palm of his hand. He freezes and turns his hand around. Lockpicks. Of course.

 

He shakes as he picks the lock and someone jostles him every other second and he can barely see anything past the yellow and the knob turns and he pushes the door open, collapsing into the room.

 

The yellow is duller here, but just barely. It still weighs him down.

 

Now that he’s here, he’s sure he needs to do something. His brain races through what he knows, but all he knows is fear and I don’t want to be trapped and lockdown.

 

Lockdown. U.A. is in a lockdown. Low-level emergency. Panicking. Yellow. Fear.

 

Izuku rushes for the wall and opens the small P.A. box. He finds the controls easily, and turns it on. Instantly, the sirens stop and Nedzu’s voice cuts out.

 

“This is Midoriya Izuku of class 1-A,” he begins, the words falling out. “This is an announcement. Please calm down. Nothing is wrong. Everyone is safe. I repeat: you are safe. Nothing is wrong. Please--” his voice cracks, but he keeps going, “--please calm down. You don’t have to be afraid.”

 

His message echoes throughout the building for a moment before he’s encased in silence.

 

The yellow slowly seeps out of the room, but his skin still flickers with the color.
Notes:

    Scene 1 summary: basically, Mineta gives his “speech” (promises to change U.A.’s dress code to make the skirts shorter, will elect Yaoyorozu as his vice-president), Izuku gets contaminated by Mineta’s aura and has to excuse himself, afterwards Mineta tells Yaoyorozu that she has his vote
    Scene 2 summary: Izuku makes his way to the workroom but he gets pretty overwhelmed by his Empathy quirk and how afraid everyone is. He picks the locks to get into the room, then uses the PA system to make the announcement: "This is Midoriya Izuku of Class 1-A. This is an announcement. Please calm down. Nothing is wrong. Everyone is safe. I repeat: you are safe. Nothing is wrong. Please--please calm down. You don't have to be afraid."

Chapter Text

Nine Years Ago

 

 

The first time, Izuku is six.

 

He wakes up like it’s any other Saturday morning, none the wiser. He browses news headlines on his phone for five minutes before getting dressed in a sweater and jeans. Then, he heads out of his room to make coffee and breakfast.

 

Well, he tries to leave his room.

 

He can’t turn the doorknob.

 

At first, Izuku just thinks the door is stuck. Their house isn’t particularly old, but it’s still a possibility. Maybe the wood warped during the night? Yeah, that makes sense.

 

But, minutes later, the door still won’t open.

 

“Dad?” Izuku calls, panic rising into voice.

 

Izuku hears him walk to the doorway and stop in front of it. “What’s wrong, Izuku?”

 

“The--the door. It won’t open.”

 

“What do you mean? Are you sure you’ve tried?”

 

Izuku is sure he’s tried, but he tries again, jiggling the knob with enough force to rattle the entire door.

 

Dad hums loud enough that Izuku can hear it through the door. “Let me try,” he says. After a short jingling noise, the knob turns and Dad pushes the door open a couple inches. He frowns through the three-inch crack. “Look, Izuku. It opened just fine for me. Why don’t you try again?”

 

Before Izuku can protest that he doesn’t want to try, I just want to go downstairs and have breakfast, Dad closes the door and the knob jingles once again.

 

Izuku tries the door.

 

“It won’t open,” he whispers.

 

“Are you sure you’re doing it right?” Dad asks like there’s a wrong way to open doors. “It opened just fine for me a second ago.”

 

Izuku opens and closes his mouth for a couple seconds in disbelief. Then he finally places that jingling noise.

 

A key.

 

“Did you... did you lock me in?” he asks, voice cracking at every other word.

 

Dad is silent until he scoffs. “Lock you in? And why exactly would I do that, Izuku? Are you locking yourself in?”

 

“No!” Izuku cries out.

 

“Really? I can’t see any other explanation to this.”

 

But Izuku knows. He knows Dad is the only one with the key. He knows he can’t lock himself in.

 

“The other explanation is that you locked the door!” Izuku yells, pulling at the knob with frantic force.

 

“Don’t raise your voice at me, young man,” Dad hisses and Izuku cowers under his intensity. “I’m trying to have a civil conversation here and all you’re doing is yelling baseless accusations. Fine. If you aren’t going to discuss this with me like a mature adult, I’m not going to cater to your attention ploys.”

 

Izuku doesn’t say, I’m not an adult or this hasn’t been a conversation. Izuku is too overwhelmed by the thought of being left alone in a room he can’t get out of. Instead, Izuku says, “Don’t! Don’t leave me here, please!”

 

“I’m not going to indulge your temper tantrum, Izuku. I thought you were better than this,” Dad says as he walks away.

 

 

Izuku cries for three hours, maybe. After another hour, he accepts the fact that the door isn’t opening.

 

He tries passing the time on his computer, but it’s hard for him to focus knowing the door is locked and, for a reason Izuku doesn’t know, his dad is probably still angry.

 

When dinner time rolls around, Izuku tries calling out again.

 

Dad doesn’t respond.

 

 

By the time Izuku wakes up the next morning, the door is unlocked.

 

Dad doesn’t mention it over breakfast, so Izuku asks with a quivering voice, “What--what happened?”

 

“Hm?” Dad begins. “What do you mean?”

 

“Yesterday? With the--the door?”

 

Dad tilts his chin up and says, in a voice completely neutral, “I don’t know what you’re talking about, Izuku.”

 

“It... wouldn’t open.”

 

Dad raises an eyebrow. “Are you alright, Izuku?”

 

Izuku blinks up at him. No, he isn’t alright.

 

“I really don’t know what you’re talking about,” Dad continues.

 

“The door--you locked--“

 

Dad sets his silverware down. “I’m starting to worry for you, Izuku. Did you get enough sleep last night?”

 

Izuku stares at him, breaths shallower and shorter than they’ve ever been, trying to understand what’s going on. “But, yesterday--”

 

Dad narrows his eyes and Izuku reflexively flinches. Dad clears his throat and adjusts the positioning of his silverware. “Did you get any good studying done, yesterday?”

 

“What?” Izuku asks, not comprehending the question.

 

Dad sighs, but a small smile makes its way onto his face, even if it looks a little tense. “I asked if you got any good studying done, yesterday. I know you got a B in your most recent history quiz, so I was wondering if you got yourself caught up.”

 

Izuku freezes. “No, I--”

 

“No?” Dad frowns. “Then what were you doing all of yesterday, holed up in your room? You didn’t even come down for dinner. I assumed you were making up for that B.”

 

“I was...”

 

I don’t know what you’re talking about.

 

Izuku takes a deep breath and looks down at the table. “I was--I was pre--preoccupied. My door got... stuck.”

 

Dad hums for a moment. “I see. Well, hopefully you’ll make a more productive use of your Sunday than your Saturday.”

 

Izuku doesn’t respond.

 

- - -

 

The second time is four weeks later, another Saturday morning.

 

He doesn’t expect it, which makes it that much worse.

 

When he turns the knob and it catches instantly, Izuku’s heart drops.

 

“Dad? ” he yells out, already pulling the door hard enough to shake the frame.

 

“Yes, Izuku?” he responds from the bottom floor.

 

“It’s locked!”

 

There’s a moment of silence before his dad says, “Why don’t you finish that paper I assigned you, then? The one you were supposed to turn in yesterday after dinner?”

 

Izuku’s face flushes and he lets go of the door. “I--” his voice cracks. He takes a moment to keep himself from crying. “I had a test on Friday I had to study for. I told you.”

 

“I know. That doesn’t mean I changed your deadline.”

 

Izuku struggles to breathe. “You can’t--you can’t do this.”

 

From the other side of the door, Dad asks, “Do what, Izuku?”

 

“Lock--lock me in here. I need to eat breakfast... and lunch, and dinner.”

 

“I’m not locking you in there, Izuku, you are.”

 

 

 

 

Present Day

 

 

Etsu lost Midoriya. Fuck.

 

Saza had said there was high risk, but they hadn’t thought she was being serious.

 

Etsu doesn’t even know where the teacher’s workroom is.

 

And then Midoriya’s voice comes on the speakers and Etsu knows they’ve really fucked up.

 

- - -

 

“Please--please calm down,” Midoriya announces through the speakers. Shouta freezes at his tone--distressed, rushed, pained--and then everything falls into place when Midoriya continues with, “You don’t have to be afraid. ”

 

Midoriya has an empathy quirk.

 

Shouta is up the stairs within moments, not wasting time giving an explanation to Vlad King, who’s in the middle of trying to coral his class. 1-A has Yaoyorozu, and Iida if it comes down to it. They’ll be fine.

 

Shouta knows where the P.A. system is--the teachers’ workroom--but he doesn’t know how Midoriya got in because the room locks during an emergency. Shouta doesn’t care. Not right now.

 

What’s important is that Midoriya has an empathy quirk in a school of seven hundred students that was just thrust into a lockdown. That’s seven hundred kids panicking, seven hundred kids worth of emotions for Midoriya to absorb.

 

Shouta makes it to the workroom within a minute. The door is cracked ajar but Shouta resists the urge to immediately burst in. First, he takes a moment to calm his breathing and (hopefully) his emotions. Then, and only then, does he step through the doorway.

 

Midoriya sits under the PA box, back to the wall, knees pulled up to his chest, head buried. Every so often he jolts, like a dog having a nightmare.

 

“Midoriya,” Shouta starts quietly.

 

Midoriya’s head whips up, eyes wide with fear. The expression doesn’t falter.

 

Without wasting a moment, Shouta Erases Midoriya’s quirk.

 

Midoriya immediately deflates, the tension in his body dissolving away. His legs fall slowly to the floor, his eyes relax, and his fists unclench. Two metal pens--utensils? Knives? No, lockpicks--fall out of his hand, caked with blood. Shouta keeps his quirk active as he takes another step and sees the blood on Midoriya’s palm.

 

“Midoriya,” Shouta starts again. He’ll have to blink soon. He doesn’t want to, but he can already feel his eyes burning.

 

Midoriya takes a deep breath and wraps his arms around his torso. “I--I’m fine, Aizawa-sensei,” he whispers. “Thank you.”

 

Shouta blinks--just for a moment--but Midoriya's entire body flinches so he reactivates his quirk instantly.

 

“You’re not fine,” Shouta says, taking a seat on the floor a couple meters away, giving Midoriya space.

 

Midoriya frowns and shakes his head. “It’s alright. Really.”

 

Shouta tries to get a read on him, to understand what Midoriya is thinking behind his mask. But even like this, even with Midoriya half-broken and completely overwhelmed, Shouta still doesn’t understand him.

 

Shouta doesn’t understand why Midoriya is lying about being fine, why he feels a need to.

 

Midoriya slowly pushes himself to his feet and deftly picks up the lockpicks in one motion. “I just got overwhelmed,” Midoriya says with a shaky smile.

 

“If you need to go home--“ Shouta starts but Midoriya shakes his head and interjects, “I don’t,” a little too quickly.

 

The reaction makes Shouta frown, but he sets it aside for another time. Priorities.

 

Shouta stands up, temporarily dropping his quirk out of necessity.

 

Midoriya tenses, but he seems to be adjusting.

 

“Are you injured?”

 

“Ah,” Midoriya starts. He turns his palms over. “No, they’ve already healed.”

 

“We’re going to Recovery Girl,” Shouta says as he turns to the door, not giving Midoriya any opportunity to argue.

 

- - -

 

“Are you going to turn me in?” Izuku asks during the walk to Recovery Girl’s office.

 

“For what?” Aizawa asks without missing a step.

 

“The lockpicks.”

 

“Oh. No.” Aizawa reaches into the folds of his hero costume and pulls out a lockpick. He blinks at it for a moment before muttering, “Shit. I have the other one somewhere in here.” After roughly ten seconds of patting himself down, Aizawa pulls out the other one. He presents them to Izuku on his open palm.

 

Izuku looks at them with wide eyes. “You’re a hero,” Izuku says, something between a question and a statement.

 

“Doesn’t mean I don’t need them.”

 

“They’re illegal.”

 

Aizawa shrugs. “So are a lot of things. Guns. Tattoo parlors. Public quirk usage.” Aizawa closes his fingers around the picks. “Just don’t get caught, alright?”

 

Izuku watches Aizawa for a moment longer, looking for any trace of a lie, of a trap.

 

He knows Aizawa is analyzing him back. Izuku doesn’t mind; he’s used to it. He doesn’t know what Aizawa is looking for, which would usually concern Izuku. But for whatever reason, it doesn’t.

 

When he finds no hint of a lie, Izuku turns back to the hallway.

 

“You don’t have to be fine,” Aizawa says without any prompting.

 

Izuku opens his mouth to respond, but Aizawa cuts in, “Don’t say anything, just think about it.”

 

Izuku doesn’t understand, but he nods once anyway and commits the phrase to memory.

 

 

Recovery Girl is already in her office, a disappointed frown ready on her face, when Izuku and Aizawa step in.

 

“Oh dear,” Recovery Girl starts, stepping up to Izuku. “What happened to you?”

 

Izuku scrunches up his nose. “I scratched my hands when I fell during the evacuation.” He smiles. “But I have a self-healing quirk, so I’m fine!”

 

Recovery Girl shoots Aizawa a look over Izuku’s shoulder which can only mean something along the lines of what kind of self-destructive student have you gotten yourself this time, Aizawa?

 

Aizawa just says, “He also has an empathy quirk.” And he walks off without another word.

 

Recovery Girl clicks her tongue and shakes her head. “Not one for social pleasantries, is he?”

 

Izuku chuckles and shrugs.

 

Recovery Girl cringes. “Let's get you cleaned up, at least. It looks like you fell on your nose, too.”

 

 

Izuku’s phone starts dinging almost non-stop just as Recovery Girl is getting ready to dismiss him. The check-up hadn’t been long, seeing as all his injuries were already healed.

 

“Do you mind if I check this?” Izuku asks.

 

“Not at all,” she tells him with a sweet, albeit tense smile.

 

He wonders what she has to be tense about. It throws him off for a moment, but he pulls out his phone and ignores it.

“Midoriya-kun,” Chiyo starts from her seat at the desk.

 

“Yes?”

 

“Are you seeing a quirk therapist?”

 

“No,” he answers with an eyebrow raised.

 

Chiyo frowns and glances at the paper on her desk--Midoriya’s file, or what part of it she has access to. She clasps her hands together in her lap and looks back at him. “Usually, people with empathetic quirks see therapists to help them balance their emotions versus those of others. I understand you just recently developed this quirk, so the oversight is understandable.”

 

He smiles, but it looks a little too cheery. After all, she doesn’t really know what he has to be happy about.

 

“I see. Is this something that should go through the school, or my father?”

 

“Your parents, preferably. But if, for any reason, you’re unable to find adequate care outside of school, we’d be happy to provide it.”

 

Midoriya nods. “Will that be all?”

 

After a moment of hesitance--she isn’t sure what holds her back, because it’s gone almost instantaneously--she smiles back. “Yes, Midoriya-kun.”

 

- - -

 

“I heard there was a break-in,” Father says.

 

“It was just the press,” Izuku notes as he silently tugs off his shoes.

 

After a beat, Father states, “Was it.”

 

Izuku knows instantly that it wasn’t just the press--that, somehow, that was the wrong answer. He freezes, still gripping his second shoe, vision unfocused. He needs to--he needs to respond, to say the right thing. But Izuku doesn’t know what the right thing is, so he’s silent for a second too long while his brain attempts to sort through everything that happened today.

 

“You’re naive,” Father bites out.

 

Izuku squeezes the shoe and shrinks closer to the ground.

 

“Look at me.”

 

Izuku doesn’t want to--the last thing he wants is to meet his father’s disappointed frown--but he does. He finishes taking his shoe off, slowly stands up, and looks at him.

 

“You really believe the press are capable of breaking into UA?”

 

Izuku finds the answer Father wants. “No, of course not. UA’s defenses haven’t been breached in dozens of years. It would take a coordinated, well-planned attack and, seeing as there have been no reports of anything malicious happening, the press was probably a diversion.”

 

Father is silent for a moment, judging. And then his frown lifts into a soft smile.

 

Izuku lets out a silent breath.

 

“I’m sorry, Izuku, ever since I heard about the break-in I’ve been a little on-edge. I’ve been worried about you, is all.”

 

“It’s fine, Father. I understand. I never should have assumed it was just the press in the first place. That was my mistake.”

 

“Come here.” Father opens his arms. “You’ve had a long day.”

 

Izuku relaxes into his father’s hug, relieved--relieved that Father’s in a good mood, that Izuku won’t be banished to his room, that he’ll probably get dinner tonight. Maybe Father will even let them order dinner, instead of Izuku cooking it.

 

“Oh!” Izuku exclaims, bending his head to get a better look at his father. “I almost forgot! I got elected class representative!”

 

Father’s smile widens. “That’s great, Izuku. I’m so proud of you.”
Notes:

    Scene 1: A flashback to when Izuku is 6. Hisashi/AFO locks Izuku in his room, but attempts to convince Izuku he isn’t the one locking the door (this is gaslighting and it’s abuse and feckin terrible). The next morning, Hisashi/AFO pretends it never happened and it’s implied he did it because Izuku got a B on a test. It happens again four weeks later after Izuku doesn’t turn in one of Hisashi/AFO’s essays in time.
    Scene 2: Izuku goes home. Hisashi/AFO asks him about the break-in, Izuku tells him he thinks it was “just the press”. Hisashi/AFO does his creepy passive aggressive thing and gets Izuku to realize it was some sort of coordinate attack. Izuku is relieved when Hisashi/AFO relaxes, then says he’s proud of Izuku for becoming class rep.

    PSA: This is probably overdue, to be honest. I’ve written a lot of Hisashi and Izuku interaction scenes from Izuku’s perspective, and all of those scene are *extremely deliberate*. However, they can be dangerous if you absorb and accept them at face value, as they're written in the POV of a long-term abuse victim who has a multitude of conditioned traits.
    Firstly, Hisashi *is* abusive. Izuku makes excuses for him and blames a lot of Hisashi’s abusive actions on Izuku himself--this is a consequence of abuse and in no way meant to signify me forgiving or excusing Hisashi myself. Manipulation is a complex thing, in which the perpetrator (can) convince you it isn’t happening, or that it’s somehow your fault, or that *you’re* the one manipulating the perpetrator, etc.
    Izuku doesn’t know Hisashi is an abusive asshole because Hisashi has convinced him, over 15 years, that he isn’t--that he’s a loving father who’s just overprotective, or who’s overworked and has a bad temper, or who’s every action is meant to better Izuku, etc, etc. Hisashi could give him any excuse at this point.
    TL;DR--Hisashi is a manipulative, abusive fuckwad. Quite a lot of Izuku’s POV and actions reflect traits Hisashi has conditioned into him via years of emotional/mental abuse, including Izuku making excuses for Hisashi’s abusive behavior.
    Note: I’m not an expert on abuse or psychology or anything. I have a smidge of experience, but nothing compared to this fic. Also, I have done quite a bit of research for this fic.
    If you have any questions or notes, I’d love to see them in the comments!!

Chapter 13: Sharp as a knife
Notes:

    Warnings for: explicit gore/violence (the scene that starts with "Shigaraki bites out, the command echoing over the plaza") (summarized in end notes); less-explicit violence, but I don't think it's any more than canon-levels. I haven’t summarized these scenes, but if you’d like me to just shoot me a comment! (these are in most/all italicized scenes, for reference); AFO's presence at the beginning

    !!!! We broke a thousand kudos y’all aaaaaa!! Thank you everybody! I’m so happy!!!!!!

Chapter Text

Tomura lays sprawled over the couch, stretching out the gunshot wounds he was specifically ordered to rest. He stares at the handheld game he's been holding without playing for the last hour.

 

“Tomura,” Sensei’s voice abruptly cuts through the silence. The monitor in the corner crackles to life.

 

Tomura drops the device to the ground without a care and glides up to a seated position, eyes fixed on the monitor like there is nothing else in the room. Subconsciously, he leans forward towards it.

 

“Kurogiri,” Sensei continues. “You too.”

 

Kurogiri warps himself onto the loveseat, not wasting a second.

 

“I expected more from you both.”

 

Tomura flinches as the air fills with a silence so heavy it threatens to suffocate them. He clenches his teeth and his eyes fall to the wood floor, a thick shame settling into his gut. He wraps his arms around his torso in an attempt to make himself smaller.

 

“Of course, I’m disappointed that you failed to kill All Might, since that was the point of attacking USJ,” Sensei starts. Tomura just wilts closer to the ground. “But I’m more disappointed that you disobeyed direct orders. Tell me, Tomura, why did you think it was acceptable to try to kill a student?”

 

- - -

 

“My name is Midoriya Izuku.”

 

Tomura skids to a stop, his hand centimeters away from the... the child’s face.

 

His fingers twitch. Half of him craves placing them on flesh, to destroy. But the other half of Tomura knows better. The other half of him has made eye contact with Midoriya Izuku.

 

It has to be a trap--it can’t be anything less with Midoriya’s sharp, calculating look--so Tomura slowly draws his hand back, buying time for his mind to come up with a plan.

 

In response, Midoriya extends his own hand in some sham of a handshake.

 

“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Shigaraki-san.”

 

Tomura flinches and, before he can think better of it, takes the chance so graciously offered, grabbing the student’s hand with all five of his fingers.

 

Or, he tries, at least.

 

The world spins in a flurry of colors. Tomura lands on his back. The air knocks out of his lungs.

 

The grip on his wrist slides to his forearm, forcing his hand to the ground.

 

Midoriya’s bright green eyes bore into him. Fearless. Deadly.

 

“Nomu!” Tomura screeches. “Get him off!”

 

The child doesn’t have time to react.

 

- - -

 

“He wouldn’t stop,” Tomura groans, digging his nails into his thigh, scowling. “No matter how many times the nomu hit him, he just kept getting back up. And his quirk--” Tomura lets out a harsh noise from the back of his throat, something between a scoff and a growl. “--its level is high enough to counter the nomu.”

 

“You still haven’t answered my question.”

 

Tomura’s eyes dart over the coffee table while his mind runs like some cheap, old engine that’s almost out of gas. He can’t disappoint Sensei--not any more than he already has. But the honest answer? Tomura’s honest answer would be unacceptable. The words stick to the back of his tongue, and he almost says them for lack of a prepared excuse, but he knows better.

 

“Shigaraki-san,” Kurogiri whispers, a reminder and warning in one.

 

Tomura analyzes the chipped coffee mug, the television remote, the book on war tactics he still hasn't read. None of them give him the answer.

 

What does Sensei want him to say?

 

“He--he tried to take on the nomu before All Might even got there,” Tomura tries, bringing his eyes up to the monitor, watching for any tell of approval, or disapproval. “He was just supposed to be some random NPC, but he kept getting in the way. I needed--the nomu was for All Might, not him.” Tomura's eyes are those of a man waiting for judgement, wide and unblinking.

 

“I see...” Sensei starts, voice echoing throughout the bar. “So, you're saying the nomu was inadequate, that it was my fault.”

 

Tomura pauses for a moment, trying to rationalize how Sensei got that from what he said. After a moment, he gives up. “N--no! Of course not. I never said that!” His nails dig further into his skin. “If--if All Might had showed up when he was supposed to or--or if the child wasn’t so fucking OP,” Tomura growls, the last of his flimsy composure completely gone, "then none of this would have happened."

 

- - -

 

Tomura watches, his wide smirk hidden only by Father, as the nomu pummels Eraserhead into the ground.

 

It’s therapeutic. They aren’t allowed to kill the kids, but the heroes are free range, so he takes out his pent-up bloodlust on the only hero here.

 

The nomu draws its fist back for another punch but then it stutters, fist slamming into empty air feet above the target.

 

The nomu lets out a screech that has Tomura slamming his hands over his ears. It skids backwards, digging its feet into the ground, and lets out another shriek. The movement slows, but the Nomu stills inches backwards. No, something still drags it backwards.

 

Tomura flicks his gaze in the direction.

 

The child--the child who should be unconscious, who just took a hit from the nomu barely half a minute ago--is struggling to his feet, one hand extended out.

 

“Nomu,” Tomura orders. He points to Midoriya. “That one.”

 

The nomu doesn’t hesitate, and its enhanced speed combined with... whatever Midoriya is doing has Midoriya in the air before Tomura sees it happen.

 

Tomura smiles and turns back to Eraserhead. “Now back to the current boss,” he tells the nomu.

 

The nomu lets out a keening whine and a creaking noise that sounds like one of the older stools in the bar. The nomu moves in the wrong direction, despite digging both its feet and hands into the ground, leaving a trail of destroyed concrete.

 

Midoriya is on his feet--he shouldn’t be, it’s impossible, a fucking pro-hero was knocked out with one hit and this kid has tanked two--drenched in blood, his costume barely more than shreds. His smile is a threat, a feral baring of teeth that has Tomura’s quirk squirming under his skin.

 

“Shigaraki-san.” Midoriya’s sickly sweet voice hits the back of Tomura’s neck, right between his shoulder blades. Despite his tone, Midoriya's eyes are even sharper than before. “I would really appreciate it if you stop.”

 

“Kill him,” Tomura tells the nomu before he can think better of it.

 

- - -

 

Tomura forcibly bites down his honest answer: I wanted to destroy him, along with everything else.

 

Sensei hums--a placeholder. Then, in that tone Tomura dreads the most (fake, a pitch higher than usual that makes Tomura's back tense, passive aggressive), Sensei says, “You’re lucky you didn’t actually kill him.”

 

Tomura swallows and grunts out, “Yes, I am,” because there probably isn’t anything else he can say without making it worse.

 

“How do you think we should punish you, Tomura?” Sensei asks him.

 

 

 

 

Izuku jolts awake, having to literally bite down a scream from an already forgotten nightmare before it wakes up his father.

 

“Midoriya-kun?” someone asks. Someone who is not his father.

 

It smells like his home but--

 

It isn’t his room. Izuku’s in a hospital.

 

Yagi half-stands, half-sits on a plastic chair beside the bed.

 

Izuku doesn’t know what to do in this situation, how to act. He hasn’t been in the hospital before--not as a patient himself.

 

“Are you alright?” Yagi asks, still frozen in his half-position, in between deciding whether to move or not.

 

“I’m fine,” Izuku answers with a small smile. “A little bit disoriented, though.”

 

Yagi watches him for a moment longer before sinking into the seat, his aura pink with concern.

 

“You’re at the hospital,” Yagi says.

 

Izuku’s smile turns into a different smile. “I got that much. What--” his voice catches in his throat, and he has to swallow the words down unless he wants to throw up.

 

Yagi’s pink brightens in intensity. “Should I call a nurse?”

 

Izuku shakes his head. “No, I’m fine.” It was just a stupid question--too obvious--he should know the answer.

 

“It’s been eight hours since...”

 

Izuku nods in understanding, then freezes when the words sink in. Eight whole hours? Why was he unconscious that long?

 

Yagi must discern his confusion, because then he drops his eyes, wringing his hands. “They said your healing quirk--it tired you out, I think. You didn’t need surgery, or anything, but they wanted to keep you here to monitor your status... or something.”

 

What happened afterwards? Izuku needs to know. Is Aizawa okay? Katsuki? Todoroki? Kirishima? Thirteen? Everyone else? What happened after he passed out? After All Might dealt with the... nomu?

 

He stares at his lap, at his once scar-free hands that now might as well be checkerboards. He wills the question to his lips, but the responding nausea fights back--chains tying his tongue down.

 

If you hadn’t passed out--if you had been better--you’d already know the answer.

 

Something brushes up against his forearm and Izuku tenses, not expecting it. The something turns into a hand--Yagi’s.

 

Izuku lifts his eyes to meet Yagi’s, only to find he can’t see them past the thick pink aura.

 

“I’ll let the nurse know you’re awake,” Yagi says quietly before standing up to leave. He stops before the doorway and turns around. “If you ever need someone to talk with... I’ll always be here, Midoriya-kun. Or you can reach out to a professional. What you witnessed... what you had to go through...” Yagi falls into silence, squeezing his lips together in a tight line. “I’m--I'm sorry.” He leaves without another word.

 

 

After a nurse, another nurse, a trauma specialist who tells him everything he already knows about caring for scars, and a doctor who says Izuku is perfectly healthy but will have to stay an additional thirteen hours anyways, a man in a tan suit enters his room.

 

“Midoriya Izuku?” The man looks kind enough. His soft eyes remind Izuku of Yagi or Recovery Girl. His hands aren’t hidden--open body language. And his aura is a muted pink.

 

“That’s me,” Izuku answers with a short wave.

 

“I’m Detective Tsukauchi, the lead on the USJ case. If you don’t mind, would you be willing to answer some questions? Just to help us get a better picture of what exactly happened.”

 

“Sure.” Izuku beckons to the chair. “Please.”

 

Tsukauchi accepts the offer with a nod. After sitting, he pulls out a small notebook from his messenger bag. “Before we begin, I have to let you know that my quirk allows me to detect lies.”

 

Izuku places a smile on his face. “That sounds really helpful for detective work.”

 

Tsukauchi chuckles. “It is, definitely.” After a moment, he asks, “Is it fine with you if we start at the beginning? Or is there someplace else you’d rather?”

 

“The beginning’s fine.”

 

The detective flips through his notebook. “I’m told you were aware of the villains’ arrival moments before they appeared. Is this true?”

 

After a moment, Izuku answers a careful, truthful, “Yes.”

 

“How were you capable of this?”

 

- - -

 

Uraraka swings Izuku’s hand back and forth, practically jumping up and down. “Thirteen’s my favorite hero!” she whisper-yells.

 

Izuku smiles back at her.

 

Aizawa says something to Thirteen before they introduce USJ.

 

All Might isn’t here, which Izuku notes, but doesn’t dwell on. He probably ran out of time, or got caught up hero-ing.

 

“Our quirks can be weapons, used for harm,” Thirteen announces. “Just as easily as I can save a group of people, I can kill them.”

 

The group goes silent. Uraraka squeezes Izuku’s hand a little tighter.

 

“So, today, we are here to use our quirks as tools of protection, not as...” Thirteen keeps talking, but Izuku stops listening.

 

He smells... something in the air. Iron. Heavy. Blood.

 

A blood-red haze, so dark it’s almost black, ripples out in waves from the center of the plaza.

 

It starts slow, like a calm tide, but then it pushes up and grows and crashes over the steps and hits Izuku so hard he drowns for a few seconds.

 

He chokes on the aura. He chokes on it and he breathes it in and he swallows it down. He consumes it.

 

Izuku’s smile sharpens to expose his teeth. His eyes narrow. His back snaps straight. He clenches whatever is in his hand with a newfound strength.

 

Izuku takes a step forward. He knows what he has to do.

 

Before he can, before he can stride down those steps and kill every last--

 

Izuku takes a breath of air, choking on the emptiness, on the lack of blood-red haze, breathing in nothing but air.

 

His eyes meet red ones. Aizawa’s.

 

“Villains,” Izuku croaks out, finally back in control of himself. “Villains.”

 

- - -

 

“A part of my quirk, Empathy,” Midoriya starts, “it lets me see emotions as colored auras. The villains’ auras were so... potent that I was able to pick it up before they completely appeared through the portal.” Naomasa doesn't detect a lie.

 

Midoriya hasn’t yet mentioned what happened next, and the two witness accounts from Aizawa and Uraraka are both vague and concerning.

 

“What emotion, or emotions, were the villains feeling?” Naomasa asks.

 

Midoriya sits up a little straighter and he draws his hands tighter into his lap. After almost an entire minute, he meets Naomasa’s eyes and says the truth, “Bloodlust.”

 

Ah.

 

That explains quite a lot, actually. Aizawa and Uraraka’s accounts. The villains from the flood zone.

 

Naomasa makes a few notes before continuing, “I have a pretty good picture of what happened on the stairs next. You distracted the warping villain--Kurogiri--with a conversation. After Thirteen tried to use their quirk you, Bakugou, and Kirishima, attempted to hold the villain back. Then, a majority of the students were warped to various locations. You, as far as I know, were warped alone to the flood zone. Is this correct?”

 

“I believe so, yes.”

 

And this is where it gets tricky.

 

Because all Naomasa knows about the flood zone is what the villains have told him.

 

And what the villains have told him...

 

Naomasa clears his throat. He’s a neutral detective. The villains’ accounts don’t matter here.

 

“Do you have any idea why Kurogiri would have warped you individually? Everyone else was warped in groups of two or more.”

 

- - -

 

“Get back!” Thirteen yells. “I need space for my quirk!”

 

Izuku hesitates, his mind reciting back an analysis of Thirteen’s quirk.

 

Large area of effect. Uncontrollable. Constant.

 

Izuku turns to the warp villain. The warp villain.

 

His mind is working too fast--too many theories--too many options.

 

“We are the League of Villains,” the villain announces. “Apologies for our abrupt entrance. However, we thought All Might was going to be here. His absence is quite unfortunate.”

 

“All Might?” Izuku asks, clasping his hands behind his back, smiling, and taking a step forward. “He’s probably at U.A. We could take you there, if you’d like. Or send someone to get him.”

 

The villain eyes Izuku with wariness--the only reason Izuku recognizes the emotion is by his aura. He doesn’t really have a face or a body.

 

“Thank you for the offer, but I believe the plan is to pick off a number of you until he shows up.”

 

Izuku shrugs his shoulders and pouts. “Ah, that’s unfortunate. You don’t think we could come to some sort of compromise, do you?”

 

The villain is silent. He’s confused and suspicious--a shifting lime.

 

“Oh!” Izuku exclaims, smile widening.

 

The villain flinches, the purple haze which is his body spiking upwards for a short moment.

 

“Where are my manners!” Izuku extends his hand. “My name’s Midoriya. What’s yours?”

 

After a moment, the villain reluctantly answers, “Kurogiri--”

 

Izuku is barreled to the ground by something heavy, hard, all edges.

 

Kirishima.

 

Thirteen yells. The air turns cold, and then for a moment Izuku can’t breathe at all.

 

Someone screams. More than one someone.

 

Thirteen is on the ground. Kurogiri is on the other side of the platform.

 

Kirishima lifts Izuku to his feet right as Kurogiri moves.

 

Izuku reaches out with Pull, searching for any part of the villain that’s corporeal. He doesn’t find it fast enough. But then Katsuki is there, and Todoroki’s ice follows shortly.

 

Izuku Pulls Kurogiri towards him, just far enough to let the villain know he has him.

 

Kurogiri turns yellow with fear and then envelopes Izuku with his quirk.

 

- - -

 

Midoriya shrugs and purses his lips, lost in thought for a moment.

 

“No,” he lies. “I can’t think of a reason.”

 

He lies.

 

Naomasa almost drops his entire notebook, because if it weren’t for his quirk, he would have had no idea Midoriya is lying. No idea. Absolutely none.

 

Midoriya met his eyes. His hands never twitched, nor did his eyebrows or mouth.

 

He has zero tells --at least none of the generic ones that Naomasa is able to notice in passing.

 

Naomasa has never met someone with zero tells.

 

He seriously considers asking the question again, giving his quirk another shot, but he knows he’d just get the same answer.

 

Midoriya lied.

 

Naomasa scrawls down, reason for solo warp?--lie in his notebook as quickly and discreetly as possible.

 

“Moving on,” Naomasa starts, ignoring the bead of sweat rolling down his forehead. “Would you please tell me what happened at the flood zone?”

 

- - -

 

Izuku stumbles to his feet. A combination of disorientation, unstable footing, and even thicker bloodlust leaves him nauseous for a couple seconds. Then a yell of “Finally, the show’s begun!” shocks him into clarity like an alarm clock.

 

He’s on a boat. The flood zone, then. Villains litter the water, each and every one emitting the same aura.

 

Izuku closes his eyes and imagines Aizawa turning his quirk off, cutting the connection between Izuku and them.

 

When he opens his eyes, the aura is still there.

 

Fuck.

 

“Hell yeah!” another villain yells. “Now for the fun stuff!”

 

Even aware of it, fully knowledgeable that the feeling isn’t his own, Izuku can do nothing to stop it.

 

He steps atop the edge of the boat, wearing a wide smile he hasn’t seen on anyone but his father. “Fun?” Izuku asks in some sick parrot of Aizawa he’s only half-aware of. “This isn’t fun, now is it? This is very, very serious.”

 

He Pulls the unlucky villain into his grasp. With One for All spread through his muscles, Izuku is more than strong enough to hold up the villain with one arm. The villain squirms, eyes wide. Izuku taps his shoe against the boat, drawing out the spike.

 

“I’ll show you just how serious this is.”

 

He moves to kick the villain, with full intentions of kicking somewhere lethal, but he freezes halfway through the action.

 

“That looks very dangerous, Midoriya-san," Iida said.

 

Yellow. Fear. Uraraka.

 

“They’re for climbing," Izuku insisted.

 

Izuku clenches his teeth. He simultaneously slams his foot into the boat and his fist into the villain’s face, hard enough to knock them back into the water, but just not hard enough to kill them.

 

“Who’s next?” he asks, eyes flitting between the various villains, fists tight at his side, Pull already latching on to a dozen of them.

 

 

It gets a little tricky when the boat starts sinking, but it isn’t anything Izuku can’t handle. There are only six villains left, anyway, so it’s not like it really matters.

 

Something stabs through his left shoulder. A thick needle, made of some material in between ice and glass. Izuku removes it without hesitation, cringing when the wound starts stitching itself back together.

 

“This is impossible!” one of them yells. Their red has long turned into yellow, but the aura in the center plaza is stronger, anyway.

 

“Let’s retreat!”

 

“ That’s impossible! At least this kid probably won’t kill us! Shigaraki definitely will!”

 

Izuku ignores their chatter and Pulls one into a One for All-infused punch. They collapse to the ground, unconscious.

 

Five.

 

“Whatever! We have a chance back there!”

 

One turns to go--slight mutant quirk, gills, scales, wearing a breathing apparatus, probably can’t breath oxygen, removing it would--

 

Izuku replaces the idea with that of Uraraka--frightened, dyed a permanent yellow in his presence.

 

He Pulls the villain to him and knocks them out.

 

The remaining four don’t put up a fight.

 

- - -

 

Midoriya spins a rather believable lie about fearing for his life, about what he was forced to do in self-defense. Naomasa stops absorbing any of it after the first sentence, more motivated to scan Midoriya for any signs of the lie--for any tell.

 

But no matter how hard Naomasa looks, he can’t find any. Midoriya looks just the same as earlier: a little bit tense (but just the right amount of tense for someone in their first police interview), back perfectly straight (but just as straight as a rich kid, or someone often in the public eye), hands perfectly still in his lap, and often eye contact (but not too often, and not too little).

 

It’s almost, dare Naomasa think, too perfect.

 

“Tsukauchi-san?” Midoriya asks.

 

Naomasa clears his throat, eyes dropping to the notebook for lack of anything better to do. “Sorry. Where were we? After the flood zone, right. You fought with the big creature for quite a bit--the boss, Shigaraki, as well. Are you comfortable talking about that?”

 

Midoriya adjusts his seating position for the first time in the entire meeting. He intertwines his fingers and squeezes his lips together before answering. “Yes... After escaping the flood zone, I approached the center, the area around the fountain,” Midoriya states simply, without emotion.

 

It isn’t that unusual. Some people respond to trauma by distancing themselves from it, or who find it doesn't sink in for days, weeks, or even months later. Naomasa will respect it. At least for now.

 

“Why didn’t you retreat back to the entrance?” Naomasa asks.

 

“I had to save Aizawa-sensei,” he answers immediately--and it’s the truth, which might be the oddest part of this interview. Even odder than his zero tells.

 

“You had to save... a pro hero?” Naomasa clarifies, one eyebrow raised, pen tip bleeding onto his notebook.

 

“Yes.”

 

Naomasa stares at Midoriya for what doesn’t feel like that long, but then Midoriya starts speaking again.

 

“I hid behind a boulder. Just a couple seconds, maybe half a minute, after I got there Kurogiri warped to Shigaraki and told him one of us got away. Shigaraki--he said something about--” Midoriya takes a deep breath and squeezes his hands together. “--that maybe All Might would show up if he killed a hero student or two. He sprinted up to me. We fought.” Midoriya scrunches up his face. “I think. It’s sort of a blur. Everything after that is just... nomu.”

 

- - -

 

“Kill him,” Shigaraki bites out, the command echoing over the plaza.

 

A small part of Izuku knows the order isn’t for him.

 

That small part of Izuku is quickly drowned under the blood-red waves rushing off Shigaraki.

 

Kill him.

 

Izuku stares down the nomu as it rushes him, One for All crackling through his limbs.

 

He needs more--more strength--more everything.

 

One for All burns, screams (or is that him screaming?), and red lightning sparks across his skin, into his muscles and into his bones.

 

Kill him.

 

The Nomu doesn’t stop but that’s fine. Izuku doesn't need it to. Izuku pulls his fist back (tendons snap, his shoulder dislocates, but Regeneration is quick) and slams it directly into the nomu’s punch. The shockwave tries to push the Nomu back but Izuku holds it there with Pull. The creature gets sandwiched between the conflicting forces.

 

Izuku’s arm, from just below his elbow to his fingertips, weaves itself back together with the same lightning that helped destroy it.

 

The Nomu screeches and goes for a kick.

 

Izuku responds with one of his own, but the knee on his balancing leg shatters and he collapses to the ground.

 

Regeneration doesn’t have enough time.

 

The nomu kicks.

 

His ribs s h  a tt e r

 

His spine c  r a ck s

 

He tumbles feet, or yards, or miles, or inches, or hours, or gallons.

 

His knee snaps back into place.

 

His ribs creak, complain, boil, stretch until the pieces find each other and hot glue themselves back together.

 

His spine cracks itself back in place.

 

And then the nomu kicks him again. Stomps him straight into the ground.

 

He wants to be unconscious. He tries his best to let go, but Regeneration drags him back.

 

And then the nomu kicks him again.

 

And again

 

And again

 

And it doesn’t matter how powerful the sparkling of his body is because

 

Then the nomu kicks him again

 

And Regeneration pulls him back.

 

Then, without warning, it stops. Or at least Izuku thinks it stops. It’s hard to tell, with Regeneration still stitching him back up, trying to fix wounds that it had never gotten the opportunity to before.

 

He smells fear, concern, anger, bloodlust, and more fear.

 

Something touches him and Regeneration jumps at his skin--no, it’s the other quirk, the fancy one, One for All. He’s being lifted up, moved. One for All spikes with his anxiety and something breaks--maybe an ankle, or just a muscle sprain--Regeneration doesn’t give him time to figure out.

 

Someone says something in not-Japanese and then Izuku is placed carefully on the ground.

 

Aizawa lays next to him, red. Angry? Murderous?

 

No, Izuku realizes, it’s blood.

 

He reaches out--to check for a pulse or, maybe just to reassure himself that Aizawa is really there.

 

“Midoriya,” someone says quietly, taking his hand before he can finish the action.

 

Kirishima. Katsuki’s friend. Izuku shouldn’t get to close, Katsuki wouldn’t like that.

 

And then he feels a shock white pain worse than the minutes he spent with the nomu. He loses his breath for a moment and tracks the aura to the fountain.

 

To All Might.

 

Izuku Pulls the Nomu--just enough to buy time--before he can think better of it.

 

 

- - -

 

After a moment of silence, Midoriya continues, “The nomu didn’t have any emotions. None at all.”

 

“I... see,” Naomasa answers for lack of a better answer. He checks his notes for the missing information he needs. “Before Todoroki, Bakugou, and Kirishima showed up, you managed to hold off the nomu for an extended period of time. Do you have anything to add about that?”

 

This is the last question Naomasa wants to ask, but he has to, legally.

 

He knows how Midoriya... held off the thing. They all do.

 

Self-healing quirk.

 

Midoriya smiles sadly and shakes his head. “No, I don’t think I do.”

 

Naomasa smiles back and closes his notebook. “Well, unless there’s anything else you think I should know, that’s all I have.”

 

“Nope.”

 

Naomasa stands up and gives Midoriya a deep bow. “On behalf of the Musutafu Police Department I thank you, Midoriya-kun, for your help during the attack. I sincerely hope, if anything like this happens before you graduate, you’ll be able to leave the situation to the pros.”

 

When he rights himself, Midoriya is blushing. “Me--me too,” he says.

 

Naomasa gives him another short bow. “Thanks for taking the time to speak with me, today.”

 

“Thank you.”

 

Naomasa raises an eyebrow at that, but doesn’t comment, instead heading to leave.

 

“Tsukauchi-san?” Midoriya asks, voice restrained and tense.

 

Naomasa stops in the doorway. “What is it?”

 

Midoriya opens and closes his mouth a few times before asking quietly, “Aizawa-sensei? How is he?”

 

Naomasa startles. “No one’s told you?”

 

He shrugs. “I asked a nurse if I could visit, she just said that only family is allowed for now.”

 

Naomasa frowns before stepping back into the room. “You passed out after All Might defeated the nomu, right? Do you... Has no one told you what happened after that?”

 

Midoriya rubs the back of his neck and shrugs. “No, not yet. I’ve only been awake for three or four hours.”

 

Naomasa flinches and grips the back of the chair. “All the students are safe and healthy. Thirteen received some injuries, but nothing they won’t heal from. Aizawa may have some lasting damage, but it definitely could have been worse. He’s fine, Midoriya-kun. They all are.”

 

Naomasa watches the tension dissolve from Midoriya’s body. He leans back into the bed, resting his head against the wall. He lets his hands lay relaxed in his lap.

 

“You might be able to visit Aizawa now,” Naomasa says. “They took him out of the ICU quite a few hours ago. They even let me interview him, albeit reluctantly.”

 

Midoriya’s eyes light up, but then something immediately douses it. “Thank you for the offer, but I wouldn’t want to impose.”

 

Impose? Who would he be imposing on? The hospital staff? Or--?

 

Naomasa frowns. “Aizawa isn’t doing anything. He’s been stuck in a bed for hours longer than he’s used to. I’m sure he’s bored out of his mind.”

 

Midoriya just smiles up at Naomasa. “Thanks, but really, it’s fine.” A lie. Not that it matters. Naomasa doesn’t need his quirk or tells to gather that one. All he needs is common sense.

 

“He would appreciate it if you visit him, Midoriya-kun,” Naomasa tells him, trying to convey as much honesty as he can. He isn’t the most expressive person--he trained it out of himself for detective work--but he can do this much. “He asked about you, as soon as I stepped into his room. The first thing he did, actually.”

 

Izuku hesitates, humming quietly, then lets out a quiet, “I’ll think about it.”

 

Naomasa takes that as a win.
Notes:

    Scene summary: after Shigaraki orders the nomu to kill Izuku, Izuku gets consumed by Shigaraki's bloodlust. The nomu constantly attacks Izuku while Regeneration heals Izuku. Izuku is saved and taken from the fight. Then via Empathy he feels All Might's pain and Izuku instantly attacks the nomu again (using Pull).

    !!!!! I did it!! :D USJ has been the hardest arc for me to write so far. Like, no joke, I went through roughly twelve whole drafts before settling on this monster.
    Also, I hope this chapter made sense?? It’s unbeta’d (as all my chapters are) and I know this one is sorta unconventional so like, if it’s confusing or you have questions, please let me know!
    Also also, writing this arc made me realize how OP Izuku’s current build is. Like Pull by itself is feckin legit, and so is Regeneration. But Pull and OFA and Regeneration??? Badass.

    (edit 1/8/2021 for formatting and the transition between scenes 11-12)

Chapter 14: Lucky
Notes:

    Warnings for: AFO's A+ sensei'ing in the third scene, a sorta explicit description of pain in the third scene, AFO's A+ parenting in the fourth/last scene (like the ending is pretty rough tbh)
    I haven't summarized any of these scenes but lmk in the comments if you want me to!
    FYI: I made a small edit to the last chapter. AFO originally asked Kurogiri how they should punish Shigaraki -- now he's asking Shigaraki himself.

    We got fanart??? Aaaaaa I'm so fricken happy y'all have no idea! Big shoutout and Thank You to Itsumi for the art!!! It's of the scene in chapter 12, when Izuku is panicking in the teacher workroom (during the break-in)

Chapter Text

The next knock on Midoriya’s door is not a nurse, nor a doctor, nor the detective.

 

“Hey, kiddo,” Nemuri whispers from the doorway. Her smile is sincere, but simultaneously sad. “I’m Kayama-sensei, also known as Midnight. Shou--Aizawa sent me to check in on you. He's still tied to his bed.” She chuckles quietly, then nods to the room. “Is it cool with you if I come in?”

 

“Sure,” Midoriya answers as he adjusts his seating.

 

Nemuri pulls the chair away from the wall--the exact same chair that’s in Shouta’s room--the exact same chair she’s been sitting in for the past nine or so hours. Her mind quickly cycles through every position she’s tried--”normal”, backwards, perched, sprawled over it in an attempt to lay down. Oh! There’s at least one left she hasn’t tried yet. She sits down on the chair, criss-cross applesauce. “I’m not gonna ask you any of that how are you doing crap, because we both know what that answer is. But Aizawa wants proof that you’re alive, so I’m gonna text him real quick.”

 

“Alrighty!”

 

Nemuri takes her phone out and hums a random tune as she sends, ur kids alive and talking. idk about the kicking part yet tho.

 

“How’s Aizawa-sensei doing?” Midoriya asks.

 

“Honestly, this is probably the longest he’s ever spent in bed. He’s getting a little stir crazy, but otherwise he’s fine.”

 

“Yeah, I understand,” Midoriya starts. “I think I still have another ten hours before they let me go.”

 

Nemuri ignores the buzzing of her phone to suggest, “Well why don’t you come hang out in Aizawa’s suite for a bit? Hiza--Yamada's in there now. We've sorta been rotating in and out.”

 

Something in Midoriya... shifts. He tenses minutely, nothing more than a tightening of his jaw and fingers, really. It’s unlikely that many others would notice it--Nemuri only does because she spent her childhood training herself to notice her mother’s near-spontaneous mood flips.

 

“Thank you, but I think I should stay in bed. My quirk has left me pretty tired.”

 

“That’s fine,” she answers, hoping her smile is reassuring. “If it’s alright with you, I could just stay here for a bit? Get away from Aizawa's stuffy room and Yamada's constant rambling.”

 

“Yes, that's alright.”

 

She leans back in the chair and reads the message Shouta sent.

 

Thanks

 

His parents giving you any trouble?

 

Nemuri freezes, fingers wrapping around her phone in some excuse of grounding. She swallows, steadies her breathing, and reminds herself not to jump to conclusions.

 

“Hey, kiddo,” she starts, propping her elbow on her knee and resting her chin on her palm. “Where are your folks?”

 

Midoriya leans forward slightly. He looks her over for one second, two, then answers, “My father has a chronic illness, he can’t leave the house. My mom passed away when I was young.”

 

The words sound... Nemuri isn’t sure, but something feels wrong about the whole situation.

 

A fifteen year old left alone in the hospital? After a fucking traumatic villain attack?

 

What kind of father lets that happen? The bad kind, obviously. Or, Nemuri can trust the kid’s words at face value, and assume it's just the unhealthy kind.

 

“Well, I’ll be here from now on!” Nemuri exclaims with forced cheer.

 

He smiles and nods. “Thanks.”

 

Nemuri texts Shouta a quick, nope no one’s here. should i worry??

 

It doesn’t matter what Shouta tells her. She’s already worrying.

 

“Aizawa tells me you’re designing him a new costume,” she says just to say something. “How’s that going?”

 

Midoriya shrugs. “I only started a couple days ago, so it isn’t really going anywhere quite yet. I’ve met with Cementoss and all the support students I’ll be working with so we’ve gotten some brainstorming done, but that’s it.”

 

“You designed something for Yamada, too, right?”

 

He nods.

 

Nemuri throws her head back and lets out a quiet groan. “Luckies,” she whines. “I haven’t gotten an upgrade in years.”

 

Midoriya cringes, but quickly places a smile over it. “I could design something for you, if you want.”

 

Nemuri frowns in response. She watches Midoriya, the upturn of his lips that’s just barely a smile, the movement of his hands that would lead her to think he’s enthusiastic. But she also takes in the furrowing of his brows, the tension of his shoulders, the fact that he cringed.

 

He’s accommodating to her.

 

The realization makes her want to throw up.

 

“No,” Nemuri squeezes out, fixing on a smile. “You don’t have to.”

 

“I’d be happy to,” Midoriya tells her.

 

You wouldn’t, she wants to say, but instead says, "No, really.”

 

“It’s fi--”

 

“No," she snaps.

 

Midoriya tenses backwards. He completely closes himself off from her within a second. He purses his lips, brings his hands into his laps, draws his shoulders in even tighter.

 

Nemuri opens her mouth to apologize, to say something, anything, but Midoriya beats her to it.

 

“I’m sorry,” he says, eyes wide with--

 

She thinks it’s desperation at first, but no, it’s fear.

 

And there goes her backup theory, that it was just high empathy all along. No. This isn’t high empathy.

 

“Midoriya,” she starts, weaving as much honest emotion into her voice that she can. She uncrosses her legs and leans forward slowly. “I’m sorry.”

 

His eyes narrow after a beat.

 

“I’m sorry,” Nemuri repeats. “I let my emotions get the best of me and I snapped at you, that’s one hundred percent my fault. You did nothing wrong.”

 

He watches her silently--reading her. And in that moment, it all really sinks in. He’s been reading her, ever since she walked in. Reading and responding.

 

“You did nothing wrong,” she says again, quieter, hoping he’ll believe her.

 

A couple seconds later, his face falls into a perfectly neutral expression. “Thank you, Kayama-sensei,” he says with the most fake smile she’s ever seen. “I accept your apology and forgive you.”

 

He doesn’t forgive her--no, it isn’t that. He probably doesn’t believe her.

 

Nemuri smiles back--just as fake. “Thanks, kid. Right back at you.”

 

- - -

 

Shouta thought he'd be happy to be out of the hospital and, in some ways, he is. But in other ways this is worse. He's only been out a couple hours and Nedzu already has everyone gathered around his stupidly long conference table.

 

Nedzu doesn’t need to make a sound to catch Shouta's attention. All he does is tighten his shoulder blades, adjust his smile, and clasp his hands together in front of him.

 

Shouta must react somehow, because Hizashi breaks off mid-sentence, his rant about shitty hospital food ending much, much too late.

 

“USJ,” Nedzu starts, managing to sound cheerful, disappointed, and aggressive within the span of three syllables, “was a disaster.”

 

The silence in the room is heavy, likely out of respect for those heroes who were present at USJ.

 

Shouta wants to adjust his seating into anything more comfortable, but the head-to-toe bandages restrict his movements and leave him in a straight-jacketed state.

 

“But, we’ve all heard enough about USJ,” Nedzu says, tapping the inches-thick official report sitting on the table in front of him. “What we need to talk about now is how we allowed the attack to happen.”

 

An incomprehensible murmur rises quietly around the table, side conversations maintained to whispers. Then Hizashi’s face scrunches up in confusion and he blurts out, “What do you mean, allowed? No one allowed this to happen, it just... happened.”

 

Shouta sighs, the movement sending a rattling pain through his rib cages. He wants to tell Hizashi that nothing happens without cause, but in group environments like this, Shouta rarely speaks up. Another staff member is sure to do it for him.

 

“That’s where you’re incorrect, Yamada. These things don’t “just happen”--” Nedzu actually uses his paws to put makeshift air quotes around the words “--not at UA. Our security is supposed to be the tightest in Japan, second only to Tartarus. I helped design it myself.”

 

Hizashi purses his lips, but makes a surprisingly wise choice and doesn’t respond.

 

“So,” Nedzu continues, smile widening, “does anybody have any ideas as to how a new villain group managed to learn classified scheduling details as well as the teaching roster, break into USJ, and completely negate all of our security measures?”

 

Ten seconds go by, then thirty. When a minute passes, the silence is so awkward and suffocating Shouta starts debating saying something himself, even though he doesn’t have any substantial ideas.

 

“Maybe they hacked something?” Nemuri suggests, lacking any confidence.

 

Nedzu laughs. “If they’re capable of hacking into my system, USJ would have gone much differently.”

 

The silence returns, even heavier than before. Something has settled there... a realization. The realization that these villains were--are--competent. The realization that attacking UA is nowhere near an easy feat. The realization that, somehow, they got classified information.

 

Shouta glances around the table, at dropped gazes and shifting eyes, at clenched jaws and nail biting.

 

Snipe slowly leans back in his chair and takes off his hat in a dramatic, attention-grabbing motion. “We have a mole,” he states with such finality that for a single moment, everyone is the mole.

 

Shouta, himself, succumbs to the panic. To the blind paranoia that it could be anyone. Instantly, the people sitting next to and across from him--they aren’t heroes anymore, but potential spies, professional villains, planted here to tear down UA from the inside out.

 

But that’s idiotic. If--if --there is a mole, it’s unlikely to be a pro-hero. What kind of pro-hero is going to suddenly switch sides? Anyway, Shouta decided years ago--if he’s going to trust anybody, it’s going to be the people in this room. Save All Might, maybe. Not that he’s a fucking traitor.

 

Shouta snorts quietly, the thought of All Might being the traitor so improbable it completely shuts down the remaining panic.

 

“You can’t be serious,” Nemuri scoffs, rolling her eyes. Her arms are crossed against her chest--a defensive reaction, but right now everyone is attacking everyone else with their eyes, so she has an excuse to be defensive. “Who would ever betray UA--hell, who could betray the heroes? That’s a dangerous spot to be in.”

 

Nedzu probably has an answer, but he isn’t the one to speak.

 

Cementoss stands up, a calculated, respectful movement, and waits until everyone’s attention is on him before he starts. “I’m against putting any names out there without solid evidence, but before we start pointing fingers at each other, I want to suggest the possibility that it isn’t a staff member, but a student.”

 

Shouta tenses intuitively, jaw clenching down tight enough to make an uncomfortable click.

 

It’s logical. Children, teens especially, are a vulnerable demographic. But as a teacher... the accusation just doesn't sit right.

 

Vlad King nods a couple of times--of course he does--and flips through the police files like he’s looking for something. “That makes sense. Detective Tsukauchi wrote something about a student who lied multiple times during the--”

 

All Might erupts in a choking fit so intense his face turns red. It lasts at least half a minute. When he’s finished coughing into his napkin, he manages to squeeze out, “You don’t, uh, need to worry about him.” Which is the most vague and non-committed rebuttal Shouta has ever heard that All Might may as well have stayed silent.

 

Cementoss is still standing, and he uses his height to his advantage as he announces, “Midoriya Izuku.”

 

Shouta scowls and his entire body tenses like he’s preparing for a car crash. He really shouldn’t be surprised at Midoriya's name being thrown out there, but he still is. After USJ? It feels like a waste of time to even consider the possibility. Logically, Midoriya is the last of his students who would ever betray them.

 

But Cementoss doesn’t stop. “I’ve seen him. When he’s with Hatsume Mei--one of my students--he’s an entirely different person than when he’s with the other kids, or the teachers. It’s unnatural.”

 

All Might draws his shoulders back and narrows his eyes. Nemuri uncrosses her arms and places both hands on the table, fists. Thirteen sits perfectly still, save the tight wringing of their hands. Nedzu...

 

Nedzu’s smile is a threat, a promise that his teeth are weapons and he isn’t against using them to bite open your neck.

 

“Did you hear about 1-A's Battle Trials?” Snipe adds, ignorant to the silent war breaking down around him. “All the first years were talking about it. And he was in the workroom during the break-in on Tuesday. That’s pretty suspicious.”

 

“Yeah,” Cementoss answers quickly, and Shouta knows it’s almost too late, “Hatsume convinced herself the Bat--”

 

“Wow!” Nemuri exclaims, shooting to her feet, an obviously fake smile plastered on her fake. Her passive aggression is so biting it scrapes at Shouta’s ears. “Look at all this naive ignorance in one room! I just love it when we jump to conclusions without knowing anything! ” She claps her hands on her hips and then swings over to face Shouta. “Hey, Shouta, out of curiosity, did anyone ever visit Midoriya during his twenty-four-hour stay in the hospital? Like, oh, I don’t know, his father, maybe?”

 

Shouta blinks up at her, temporarily overwhelmed by her toxic energy. “No.”

 

“And, everyone! Care to tell me why Midoriya had to be hospitalized?”

 

Silence.

 

“Anyone know what went down at USJ? No? Did no one read the file?”

 

“Thank you, Kayama,” Nedzu interrupts. “I can take it from here.”

 

It takes Nemuri a moment to stop shivering, but when she does she collapses back into her seat, as tense as Shouta.

 

“What Kayama is trying to convey, is that Midoriya sacrificed more than any other student at USJ, and more than many of the heroes. It is unlikely that a spy would go to such lengths.”

 

“What about the lying? The Battle Trials?” Vald King asks.

 

Nemuri exhales, slams a fist down onto the table, and exclaims, “Have you ever talked to the kid for longer than ten seconds?”

 

After a moment, he reluctantly answers, “No?”

 

“Kayama,” Nedzu sighs, extending a placating hand. “How Midoriya presents himself is irrelevant to the issue at hand--”

 

“It’s not only that,” Cementoss interrupts, still standing. “His positioning during the break-in is shady enough--”

 

“No,” Shouta snaps, done with all the finger pointing, the arguing, the misunderstandings, the blame game. He pushes himself to his feet, which is a painful process, but he does it nonetheless. If he doesn’t, Cementoss will still be above him, and if he’s going to make this argument (which apparently he is) then they need to be on even ground.

 

Shouta meets Cementoss’ eyes.

 

Cementoss flinches and looks away.

 

“Everyone just shut up and listen,” Shouta starts, trying his best to keep his voice even, neutral, emotionless. “Midoriya went to the workroom to help dissuade the chaos, which he did. His announcement calmed the students down.” Shouta takes a breath between gritted teeth. “I found him there in the middle of an anxiety attack. Whenever I asked him how he was doing, he just told me he was fine. He was--fucking--in the middle of an anxiety attack and--” Shouta growls and takes a moment in an attempt to collect himself. “He spent entire minutes getting--stalling time for you lot to show up and save us. He only survived because his fucking quirk constantly healed him. Constantly. For minutes. So fuck you. I trust Midoriya over any of you idiots.”

 

Shouta collapses back into his seat with a grunt.

 

After a moment, Hizashi places a gentle hand on his knee, and Nemuri exhales sharply, something between a chuckle and a sigh.

 

“Well,” Cementoss whispers as he sinks into his seat. “If it isn’t Midoriya, then who?”

 

The silence is just as thick as before.

 

“Who knows!” Nedzu answers with a clap of his hands. “But now we have a theory! And one less possibility!”

 

- - -

 

“How do you think we should punish you, Tomura?” Sensei asks him.

 

Tomura gnaws on his bottom lip--not out of worry, but thought. He needs to decide on something Sensei will find suitable. Something harsh enough not to disappoint him, but not so harsh that Tomura can’t take it.

 

He’s gone days without food, but he’s healing, so that probably isn’t the best idea. He’s spent weeks locked in his room, without any outside contact. It’s... acceptable, but Sensei doesn’t seem to like it as much. He could do training, but he is injured. He--

 

His stomach churns just thinking about it, and something crawls under his skin. It’s the only option Sensei is sure to approve of that Tomura is sure to survive.

 

He digs one of his hands into his neck and holds the other in front of him, palm up. “Take it,” he chokes out.

 

Sensei’s smile is honest--approval --and Tomura relaxes instantaneously, the anxiety at losing his quirk melting away at the realization that Sensei approves.

 

Sensei places his hand on Tomura’s.

 

Tomura feels it in his skin first--a burning pain not unlike being flayed alive. Then it digs deeper, reaches under his skin, under his muscles, under and inside his bones until he's being pulled apart from the inside out, emptied like a pumpkin an hour before trick or treating, no time to waste.

 

Even when it's over, even when Sensei pulls his hand back and pulls Tomura out with him, the pain doesn't stop.

 

Tomura manages to stay conscious only because this isn’t his first time losing his quirk--it’s closer to his tenth. And even now it’s a close thing. He collapses to the ground, body shivering, cold despite the still-burning pain. Spots fill his vision until he can barely see anymore and the throbbing in his head drowns out most of the noise.

 

“It still feels insufficient,” Sensei notes casually, like they’re discussing the interior design of the bar, not Tomura’s redemption. “Any ideas, Kurogiri?”

 

If Tomura had any energy left, he’d probably react, but he’s too exhausted to do anything other than breathe and listen.

 

“Maybe room arrest, sir?”

 

After a moment, Sensei answers, “No, no. We’ll go with the opposite. You haven’t been to Australia yet, have you, Tomura?”

 

Australia? He wants to laugh, but he can't.

 

He’s quirkless. Sensei can’t seriously--

 

No. He seriously can.

 

“I don’t believe he has,” Kurogiri answers for Tomura.

 

“Perfect. Two weeks, then? Kurogiri, you can handle transportation.”

 

Fucking. Australia.

“Are you alright, Izuku?” Father asks before Izuku’s even closed the front door. “I meant to call you, but I was so busy coordinating with the hospital and the school and the police I never got around to it. I’m so sorry that I couldn’t visit you, but you know how it is with my injuries.”

 

Father reaches out a hand.

 

He knows Father’s intentions are good, but Izuku’s jaw still clenches and his muscles tense in apprehension.

 

Father places a hand on his shoulder, then pulls him in for a tight hug.

 

The contact makes Izuku’s skin boil, unwanted memories of USJ clawing at him for attention.

 

“I’m sorry you had to go through that,” Father tells him, but the words fall especially flat. “Do you want to talk about what happened?”

 

“No,” Izuku sputters out without thinking, even though the right answer is, indisputably, yes.

 

Father’s breath catches--surprise. “No?” he asks, taking a step back but leaving his hands on Izuku’s shoulders. “Why not?”

 

Izuku notices the gloves on his hands--only covering two of his fingers. They aren’t routine, which is the only reason they stick out. But he doesn’t have time to worry about gloves, of all things.

 

Izuku swallows and attempts to steady his heart rate. He shouldn’t have said no. He’s tried before. It never ends well.

 

“I just got back from the hospital,” Izuku says, hoping Father will accept a logical argument but not getting his hopes up. “I’m pretty tired.”

 

Father hums. He’s considering it. “You’ll at least tell me why you were hospitalized, won’t you?”

 

Won’t you?

 

He has no out for this one.

 

“It was just a legal precaution,” Izuku answers with a small smile. “I’m completely healthy now, and I was when I arrived at the hospital. They just needed to do some check-ups.”

 

“And the scars?”

 

Izuku spares a single moment to wonder how Father knows he has scars when he’s blind, but Father always knows things he shouldn’t, so the moment passes.

 

He can’t think of a passable lie, which sucks, because that means he’ll have to tell Father the truth. And telling Father the truth is one of the most dangerous things he can do. After a second of steeling himself, he whispers, “Regeneration.”

 

Father’s smile is a sight that makes Izuku's whole body tense in apprehension.

 

“So,” Father says, “you got hurt.” He sounds so pleased with it that Izuku knows he’s missing something.

 

“I--” Izuku starts too soon, before he even has any thoughts formed. “Yes?”

 

Father’s smile only widens. “You broke one of the three conditions.”

 

What three--?

 

Oh fuck.

 

Izuku’s heart rate spikes so quickly he gets dizzy and his vision loses focus.

 

This can’t be happening.

 

There were only three rules and he went and broke the second one.

 

No.

 

Father can’t pull him out of UA.

 

Izuku takes a breath so deep it almost leaves him coughing. He meets Father’s face. In the steadiest, strictest voice he has (some mix of Aizawa, Iida, and one of his middle-school teachers) he declares, “No. I was never in any danger. Regeneration was more than strong enough to instantaneously heal me. Even if it had only been me versus the entirety of the villains I would have been fine.”

 

It’s a lie. There were multiple close calls with Regeneration struggling to keep up. But Izuku isn’t going to give up his spot at UA just because of one villain attack. Father will have to kill him before that happens.

 

“You sound so sure of yourself, Izuku,” Father starts, smile unwavering. “Which makes sense, I suppose. That creature you kept at bay was supposed to be able to take down All Might, so it’s reasonable you’ve gained some confidence in yourself.”

 

Confident? Izuku? The idea is so unprecedented that he doesn't have a response. The thought of him ever being confident in himself is just... preposterous.

 

“But just because you survived doesn’t mean you succeeded.”

 

The words make Izuku’s chest tighten, his stomach churn.

 

It’s a directed attack, perfectly aimed right where Father knows it’ll hurt. And he doesn’t stop with just the single strike.

 

“All you did was waste time.” Father’s fingers tighten around Izuku’s shoulders--not enough to hurt, but a reminder of their presence. “You couldn’t attack, could you?”

 

If anyone else was asking it, it would be a rhetorical question. But no, Father wants him to say it out loud.

 

Izuku opens his mouth but nothing comes out, the weight of everything crashing down and constricting his throat.

 

He can’t.

 

Father erupts into laughter, which only makes Izuku crumble more.

 

“Pathetic,” Father spits. “You can’t even admit it to yourself.”

 

Izuku’s breaths come shallow, too shallow. He can barely breathe anymore. But he stands there, face perfectly expressionless, body as still as possible when he’s suffocating, knowing Father can feel every centimeter of his movements--every single one of his tells.

 

Father lets out a sharp exhale and lets go of Izuku, stepping away.

 

“Fine,” Father drawls as he drops onto the living room couch. “Since I'm such an understanding dad, I’ll give you a second chance. Depending on the quality of your written report of the event. I want a detailed analysis of all the villains. Heroes, too.”

 

Izuku should say, yessir, but he’s too busy trying to breathe.

 

“UA is giving you a four day weekend, so I’ll give you a week and a half to write it, until next Saturday. But add an event-by-event timeline to your report.” Father hums for a second. “Yes, that should be good. Until then, I expect you to be in your room, working, when you aren’t at school.”

 

Father doesn’t say the words exactly, but he doesn’t have to.

 

Izuku understands.

 

He’s grounded.

 

"You're lucky to have me," Father tells him. "A worse parent would have pulled you out of UA without a second thought. Or I could have used any number of quirks to hurt you. But I care about you, Izuku, and I know how important this school is to you. You should be thanking me."

 

He reaches for his lockpicks, for any form of comfort, of independence, of freedom.

 

But--

 

they

 

aren’t

 

there.

 

"Thank you," Izuku wheezes before stumbling off into his room.
Notes:

    I’m starting college!! Aaaa! Like, woah. So my update schedule (not that I ever really had one) is gonna get even more messy while I figure my new life out. If I don’t update in three months, sorry in advance, but please don’t be too surprised. If I update in three weeks, yay!!
    Hopefully, we should be starting the Sports Festival by ch16! But don't hold me to that :p

Chapter 15: A spoonful of sugar and cyanide
Notes:

    This might be the closest to a filler chapter I’ll likely ever post for this fic and shorter than most of my other chapters but... I just happened to write it and at least some of y’all expressed interest in this storyline. I wanted y’all to have something :)
    (Very minor manga spoilers if you squint -- aka I wrote this after reading some of the more recent chapters, like around 240, so it’s loosely inspired)
    (Warnings for: vomiting, fairly graphic self-harm per Shigaraki, All for One makes a caveat, non-graphic violence/mention of death)

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

He manages to hold it in until Kurogiri drops him five feet onto a pit of sand that’s not at all soft. But then it pushes up from his stomach and climbs through the inside of his throat. He stops holding back and lets it out—helps it out because he wants the nausea gone. But when he retches it’s nothing but a violent cough of air—an attempt to empty an already empty stomach.

 

That’s when he remembers he hasn’t eaten in days, too preoccupied with planning the attack, too anxious that everything will go wrong.

 

And the worst part is, everything went wrong.

 

Tomura vomits air onto the sand.

 

When he’s as done as he’ll be he collapses, body shivering with discomfort and pain and emptiness.

 

If he pays too much attention to what isn’t there he’ll try and puke again, so instead he pulls his body in as close as possible and claws at his arms in an attempt to make the pain go away. All it does is remind him what his hands can’t do. He passes out with his nails dug into his skin and his quirk in Sensei’s possession.

 

- - -

 

Tomura awakens half-melted with the sun cooking him from above and the sand burning him from below. He tries to stand up but his legs give out from underneath him and falls back into the oven. He lets out something between a whine and a groan in frustration.

 

Something whines back.

 

His head snaps towards the noise. A dog stares him down, barely a couple feet away. It bares its teeth at him—teeth sharper than Tomura’s nails but stained with just as much blood—and arches its back.

 

Tomura stares right back at it and growls.

 

The dog narrows its eyes and takes a hesitant step forward—testing how much authority it has.

 

Tomura pushes himself up to his knees and screeches. When he opens his eyes a couple seconds later, not even realizing he’d closed them, the dog is gone, nothing more than tracks in the sand.

 

He collapses back to the ground, already out of what little energy he’d gained by sleeping.

 

- - -

 

He understands it's supposed to be a punishment, but most of Sensei’s punishments have a purpose—most of them teach him something. And Tomura isn’t going to learn anything half-dead.

 

Then why is he here? He won’t learn anything and he isn’t—he isn’t useful here. The realization makes his stomach churn all over again, makes his breaths stutter until he struggles to breathe.

 

Quirkless, in the middle of the desert, surrounded on all fronts by absolutely nothing—he can’t do anything. Sensei can’t use him.

 

Is that the lesson he’s supposed to be learning? That he’s disposable? That as long as Sensei has his quirk he doesn’t need Tomura?

 

No, no. That doesn’t make sense. If he didn’t need Tomura he would have just taken his quirk and thrown him out years ago.

 

Right?

 

 

 

 

Years ago

 

 

Tenko stumbles through the streets—are they streets? He could be in the middle of a mall, or as far out as the countryside. He isn’t aware of anything except for the discomfort, the constant itching of every inch of his skin that scratching just makes worse.

 

But he still scratches, because if he just leaves it alone it festers, something dark he never should have let out in the first place. It’s safer trapped beneath his skin—safer for everyone else.

 

Occasional eyes land on him, hesitate on his blood-stained hands and clothes. But always, without fail, the eyes leave.

 

Tenko stumbles without destination or direction. It’s not like he’s trying to gain distance from something. It’s not like he’s running away from anything. He’s only picking his feet up and moving because he’s afraid of what he’ll do if he stops.

 

How long has he been walking? Hours? Days? Minutes? He doesn’t know. All he can think about it is the itch.

 

He walks and scratches, conscious of nothing, inputting no information and retaining even less.

 

If he continues like this, will he eventually dig through his skin? Into his bones and into whatever it is that ruined his life? Into whatever r u i n e d six lives?

 

He stops walking to dig it out.

 

A noise tries to interrupt his concentration but it underestimates his focus.

 

A hand touches his and he jolts at the contact, forcefully shocked back into reality.

 

“It’s okay,” the noise—a man—says. “You’re okay.”

 

Tenko’s fingers still for the first time since... since something terrible happened. He can’t remember what it was exactly, but it was really, really bad.

 

The man smiles and Tenko relaxes instantly, years-old tension disintegrating from his body. “You’re okay,” he repeats again. “I’ll help you.” He extends a hand of long bony fingers and watches Tenko like he knows exactly how he’s going to respond.

 

Tenko grabs onto the hand with the fervour of a starving child finding food for the first time in weeks.

 

The man’s smile widens, sharpens, turns from comforting into a smile Tenko knows to fear. His hand slowly crumbles away, dissolves between Tenko’s fingers, but his face doesn’t shift.

 

Tenko collapses backwards, entire body shivering. His breaths come shorter and shorter until he throws them up onto the pavement. He doesn’t know why. He doesn’t care.

 

“Now that that’s done and over with,” the man sighs, not caring that he’s missing an entire hand. “Why don’t you come with me?”

 

Tenko doesn’t want to. He’s barely here—hasn’t been anywhere in years—but what little of him remains knows that he just tried to kill this man.

 

“You don’t have to be afraid of me or yourself... That quirk of yours, the destruction?” His eyes shine with a darkness that Tenko can’t look at for longer than a couple seconds. “It’s useful.”

 

 

 

 

Present day

 

 

He knows there’s someone else nearby before he’s fully awake. Can tell by the sound of breaths, of quiet chittering. The smell of sweat and cooking meat and spices and cold air.

 

Tomura isn’t hot.

 

He opens his eyes and his palms, readies himself for anything.

 

A woman with pincers for a mouth and the tail of a scorpion stares at him with beady eyes. “Oh,” she starts. And in an English he can barely understand says, “You survived.”

 

She’s a side-quest. That must be it. Sensei sent him here for this.

 

“You were touch and go there for a while, kid. Thought you’d kicked the bucket for sure.”

 

She clicks her pincers together a couple times before turning around. “I made stew. It’s not the fanciest of shits, but there’s enough for the both of us.”

 

Tomura slowly sits up. His spine cracks with every movement.

 

She steps forward and reaches out a bowl. “Here you go.” When he doesn’t take it, she continues. “C’mon, eat. My treat.”

 

Her eyes soften and her tail drops, but Tomura knows better than to trust the smell of honey. Underneath it is poison.

 

Tomura doesn't see kindness. He only sees hostility painted a sweeter shade.

 

His heart rate spikes. Adrenaline fills him from the inside out. His bones boil and he knows if he had anything left in him he’d throw up again. But he’s empty, so he throws himself.

 

She falls backwards but his hand is already around her throat.

 

It’s supposed to disintegrate.

 

It’s supposed to disintegrate.

 

It's        supposed    to

 

It doesn't.

 

Tomura’s vision turns white with panic.

 

Her death is messy, sloppy, desperate, too close, dangerous, exhilarating.

 

Tomura remembers for the first time in a long time why he’s a villain. Not Sensei. Not The League. Him.
Notes:

    I have part of the next chapter written, however... I’m in a fiction writing class (it’s great and I love it, go creative writing minor!) but it’s taking up most of my writing time. So I’m not sure when I’ll be able to get the next chapter out :/
    Thanks to everyone who’s asked after me! I’m loving college so far! Still trying to find a balance between overworking myself and getting overwhelmed when I have nothing to do. I’ll get there sooner or later :P

Chapter 16: Say a word, do it soon, it's too quiet
Notes:

    Warnings for: references/mentions of forced starvation, mentions of AFO's parenting (but he doesn't show up! it's a miracle!)

Chapter Text

The realization comes a moment late, a couple seconds after the interaction has already passed. But when the realization does come it hits Shouto with the force of a punch to his gut, hard enough to make his teeth clench together.

 

Iida greeted Izuku first.

 

It’s their first day back to class and Shouto is already tense—Endeavor had been out of town which meant the last four days have been a waiting game. Which means the punishment for his poor performance at USJ will be that much worse when he gets back. Which means when Iida greeted Izuku first, Shouto noticed.

 

He hadn’t even known they had a routine until it broke, shattered, leftover pieces stabbing through his skin.

 

He watches the room with a careful apprehension, even more on-edge although he can’t pinpoint why.

 

They’re just words, nothing more than pleasantries. So why does it feel so wrong? Like everything they’ve built up to now is falling apart? Like he’s been dropped onto a stage without a script?

 

“Are you alright, Midoriya-san?” Iida asks, voice laced with that overbearing concern of his.

 

Shouto knows what Midoriya is going to say next: I’m fine, thank you, Iida-kun. Then he’ll smile that soft thing that’s somehow convincing.

 

Except Midoriya doesn’t do either.

 

“Huh?” Midoriya starts, too ineloquent, nothing but a syllable spilling from his lips. “Oh, I, uh, I’m fine, Iida.” No honorific. A smile that’s more a cringe.

 

It’s wrong. Shouto doesn’t know why but he knows that it’s wrong.

 

Iida doesn’t respond—he can’t, it’s more likely. So the room fills with an empty silence, interrupted only by Yaoyorozu arriving a few minutes later.

 

She fills the silence—which any other time Midoriya would be doing—and slowly sinks into the quicksand of realization that something is off. She gets trapped underneath the heavy weight until all conversation dies down, and they’re encompassed in nothing yet again.

 

Yaoyorozu shoots him a look which he neither understands nor responds to, so she switches to Iida, who responds with a similar-but-different facial expression.

 

“How was your weekend, Yaoyorozu-san?” Iida asks, the question unusually flat.

 

She smiles, though. “Relaxing. My parents took time off from work so we could hang out.”

 

Their stilted, forced conversation continues until Midoriya’s head slowly drops to his desk and the sound of slowed breathing is the only thing left.

 

“Is he sleeping?” Yaoyorozu whispers.

 

Shouto doesn’t respond—the answer is more than obvious.

 

The silence grows into something vaguely more comfortable over the next few minutes, no longer stilted by Midoriya’s lack of filling it.

 

- - -

 

1-A is quiet.

 

Shouta hesitates in front of his classroom, anxious for too many reasons.

 

Did he get the day wrong? Was there an extra day of vacation he missed? Is there a villain in there, right now? Are his kids so traumatized they aren’t talking to each other?

 

But his hesitation lasts only a moment before he steels himself and opens the door.

 

Yaoyorozu meets his eyes, her own widening for a moment in shock before she raises a finger to her lips and lets out a quiet, “Sh.”

 

That doesn’t quell his anxieties at all, and so he raises an eyebrow in silent question. Nearly half of his bandages were relieved, yesterday (they said his wounds could have been much, much worse. Shouta knows. He had front-row seats to the nomu’s treatment of Midoriya).

 

“He’s sleeping,” Yaoyorozu whispers, before tiptoeing back to her seat.

 

Shouta’s eyes scan the classroom before finding Midoriya, with his head laid uncomfortably on his desk and a blanket draped over his back.

 

Shouta frowns. It’s been four days. Why would he still be tired? Quirk exhaustion? Nightmares?

 

The reason is unimportant.

 

He stalks through the aisles, only stopping when Jirou reaches out to lightly grab him by the wrist.

 

“What are you doing?” she hisses.

 

Shouta sighs. “I’m going to wake him up and send him to the nurse’s office so he can get proper rest.”

 

After a moment, she nods, deeming his answer is satisfactory, and lets him go.

 

He approaches Midoriya’s desk then whispers the boy’s name. When that accomplishes absolutely nothing, he places a bandaged hand on his shoulder.

 

Midoriya jolts awake but doesn’t sit up until Shouta removes his hand and repeats his name.

 

“Go to Recovery Girl’s office and get some proper sleep, Midoriya.”

 

Midoriya doesn’t even try to argue, which is more concerning than the fact that he’d been napping in the first place. He stands up then catches himself on the back of his chair, eyes unfocusing and legs wobbling. He lets out a weak chuckle and the equally weak excuse, “Got up too fast.”

 

Shouta frowns and Ashido calls out, effectively breaking the cover of silence, “You need more iron, then, Mido.”

 

Midoriya shuffles out of the room without responding.

 

Shouta realizes just how tired the kid must be if he can’t even smile.

 

- - -

 

His alarm wakes him up fifteen minutes before lunch starts. Five minutes to get up. Five minutes to get to 1-A. And five minutes of extra time (just in case). Not that going to lunch is the best plan while he’s grounded, but there’s a student council meeting during lunch—the first one—and Izuku can’t miss it, even if Recovery Girl told him to sleep as long as he needed to.

 

He arrives at 1-A with, of course, nearly ten minutes to spare.

 

Time, however, is counting down—he’s already lost nearly four days—and so he pulls up the document on his phone. He tries to work on it, he really does. But the letters barely form words, and the words he can make out definitely don’t form sentences.

 

He only loosely remembers what he’s even trying to work on—an analysis, of course, but the details have been lost to sleepless and foodless days.

 

Izuku taps away at the keyboard, anyway, knowing he has to make progress today in case his father is observing.

 

- - -

 

Hitoshi knew, going into this, that he wasn’t going to be the only one taking a stab at 1-A, but there are over a dozen kids here. And he doesn’t think they’re all in Gen Ed, if their quirks and attitudes are anything to go by.

 

A kid leans against the wall, eyes attached to his phone, right next to 1-A’s door, opposite the crowd. Hitoshi spares a moment to wonder what he’s doing on that side before he sees the armband. Class representative of 1-A.

 

“What are you doing?” Hitoshi nearly growls out.

 

A moment passes, then another, and Hitoshi starts to think that the kid managed to not hear before he finally looks up.

 

Bags under his eyes. Pale. His eyes are dull, like the screen sucked all the light out of them, but looking at them for too long makes Hitoshi’s stomach churn, like he’s looking at something he shouldn’t be seeing.

 

He looks worse than Hitoshi does, which isn’t easy to do.

 

“Waiting for my friends to get out of class. Why?” He answers with an energy that doesn’t match his face. “Is there something I could help you with?”

 

Some entirely metal guy steps up and announces, “1-A won’t be basking in glory for much longer! Come the sports festival, the rest of us will knock you off your pedestal!”

 

The kid lifts his chin up, and despite being one of the shortest here, somehow the action alone makes him look taller.

 

Hitoshi takes a step forward, rising to the challenge subconsciously. “You all think you’re the shit because you’ve been getting some special attention after that villain attack. Just know you’re no better than us. The sports festival is the one chance for Gen Ed kids to get into the hero class, and we haven’t been pampered all our lives for our perfect quirks, so I’d watch your backs if I were you. One villain attack does not a winner make.”

 

The representative’s smile pulls taught like the string of a bow.

 

Hitoshi doesn’t stick around to see what it shoots. He turns around, content at having the last word, and starts stalking through the horde of observers. Someone grabs his upper-arm, halting his movement. He vaguely recognizes the silver-haired boy as a member of his class, but then he’s filled head-to-toe with enough adrenaline to threaten the strength of his knees.

 

Danger, his brain supplies, the sort of primal instinct you get when a villain attacks across the road and your subconscious knows it before you do.

 

Danger. It’s coming from behind him. He doesn’t dare turn around. Or take another step. Or even breathe. He knows if he does there’s a very high possibility he’ll be killed.

 

Danger. Instead, he stares at the other first-year students down the hall, who’ve frozen mid-word, eyes wide with his same fear, at the kid whose hand grips his arm with a new fervor. Hitoshi stares at them with a silent plea for help, for someone to save him. Because he stepped on a mine he didn’t know was there.

 

He’s going to suffocate if this lasts any longer, but at least he won’t live to be victim to... whatever this is.

 

Then the door to 1-A swings open and someone steps out.

 

“Midoriya. Come with me,” a man drones—fucking Eraserhead, Hitoshi would recognize that voice anywhere.

 

And just like that, the spell is broken.

 

Hitoshi can breathe.

 

“Wow, that was impressingly idiotic,” silver hair says, something in between a compliment and condolences.

 

“Midoriya?” someone else squeaks. “Shit, he’s actually real? I thought he was some ghost story Hano made up to sound cooler.”

 

Hitoshi doesn’t recognize the name, but if the murmuring of the crowd is an indicator, he probably should.

 

- - -

 

They sit in silence for two minutes until Izuku reminds Aizawa he has a student council meeting, and he’s reluctantly dismissed with the promise of future words. That’s not exactly what Aizawa says, but it’s what Izuku hears, and he swallows his heart in some attempt to brake its speeding.

 

A future conversation means one he has to prepare for—one that much more important, that much heavier.

 

But as he walks to the council’s meeting room the purpose of The Conversation is already slipping from between his sluggish fingers, sluggish from sleeping no more than a three hour nap and eating nothing more than chips and some peanut butter he’d stashed in his false drawer, sluggish from the caffeine withdrawal headache he’s had for... he doesn’t know when it started but it hasn’t stopped.

 

Izuku sneaks into the room as un-awkwardly as he can, fully aware the meeting has already started. Heads turn towards him for single moments, but Yaoyorozu smiles at him and lifts her bag from the chair next to hers. He slinks into it as one of the third years—representative of 3-B and one of the “Big-3” if Izuku’s information is correct—is saying, “The administration has decided that, yes, the sports festival will happen despite...” He meets Izuku and Yaoyorozu’s eyes. “Recent circumstances.”

 

“We understand this is quite unusual,” the young woman to his right, another of the Big-3, continues. “However, changing the status quo now would do nothing but show weakness.”

 

Nothing. Funny, that. Cutting out, or even just delaying, the sports festival would do a lot more than nothing.

 

Yaoyorozu shoots Izuku a look that reads pity and worry.

 

Shit. He might have actually laughed out loud.

 

“Midoriya, isn’t it?” the woman asks kindly, smiling softly. Her aura is warm and without ill intent. “If you have an opinion on this matter I’m sure we’d all love to hear it, although the issue is, unfortunately, above our authority as student council.”

 

Izuku sits up a little straighter, subconsciously counting the thirty-eight other people at the table. These are all the representatives, then. Every grade and every department. It should intimidate him, having to talk in front of all these people, but all he can be is grateful that he isn’t home.

 

“The sports festival is public,” Izuku begins. He wishes he knew how loud he was being. He feels like he’s talking underwater, or with headphones on, or both. He has to focus to get the words out, think carefully about every syllable. “UA is already under a villain group’s radar. I don’t see why we should make it easy for them to gather information on our students—their quirks, fighting styles, maybe even families. It’ll be like gift wrapping the key to taking us down.”

 

He should know. He’s analyzed the sports festival more than enough to know just how much information one can get from it—and he’s just a teenager. Imagine what a specialized analyst could do with that video.

 

No one says anything for the longest time.

 

Or maybe it’s only a couple seconds.

 

Izuku feels out of breath from saying that much in one go, and the next time someone speaks up—the male Big-3—every word is a stab through his skull.

 

“That is a good point. However, the decision has been made.” He clears his throat before continuing. “If no one else has anything else to say... Next order of business, Saza?”

 

Saza stands up, picking up a folder from the table as she goes. She adjusts her glasses and meets Izuku’s eyes—intention. Has he forgotten something?

 

She sighs and clears her throat before opening the folder. “We need to talk about Mineta Minoru,” she states.

 

Ah, right. That.

 

 

It takes the rest of the meeting to convince the entirety of the council that Mineta is expulsion-worthy—not that the student council has the authority to expel students, but Togata ends up promising to take their recommendation to Nedzu in an official capacity.

 

In the silence that slowly settles in after the conclusion of the meeting, Izuku is left only with himself—never a good idea. His mind reminds him, without pause, of everything he needs to do. Everything he’s yet to complete. His father’s project. Due in less than a week, now. But he knows better than to push it that close. The sports festival—god, the sports festival. He hasn’t prepared at all. Hasn’t gotten a chance with the villain attack and Father’s extra assignment. But failure isn’t an option and there’s still much to be done to ensure it’s taken off the board.

 

So much to be done.

 

- - -

 

Aizawa holds him back after class, which is nothing he hasn’t done before, but today is different. Today, Izuku is grounded.

 

He wonders how obvious it is in his face, in the way his hand finds his phone every couple of seconds (knowing a text isn’t a sufficient excuse but also knowing Father will want an answer as soon as possible), in the way he glances towards the door too often. He knows he’s doing these things but he can’t stop them.

 

The silence has gone on too long, the wasted time eating away at Izuku’s patience.

 

He doesn’t know what Conversation he’s walking into, can barely even remember what happened before Aizawa called him out of the hallway. There were some students from other classes. First-years, he thinks. Maybe even Hano.

 

“Midoriya,” Aizawa starts and Izuku instinctively stills, eyes raising and back straightening.

 

Right. The Conversation.

 

“Yes?” he asks as innocently as he can.

 

“Is there someone you can talk to?”

 

Izuku flounders at the change of subject, not following the train Aizawa took to get here. Expecting chastising but instead getting the aura of compassion. “Sorry?”

 

“Do you have anyone you can tell things, be honest with?”

 

Izuku raises an eyebrow. “Uh, everybody, sensei? Sorry, I don’t think I understand the question.”

 

Aizawa’s expression softens slightly, although he clenches his jaw underneath it. “Is there someone you can tell things you wouldn’t tell everybody? Friends from middle school, maybe? Friends here? Family?”

 

“My father and I are really close,” Izuku answers automatically, despite still not understanding the question.

 

Aizawa huffs out, then after a moment waves a hand. “Alright. Be free. But if you ever want to talk, I’m here, and I’m sure any of the other teachers would be happy, as well.”

 

Izuku shuffles out, bouncing the conversation around in his head in an attempt to deduce some sort of higher meaning from it.

 

- - -

 

Father, surprisingly, doesn’t mind too much that Izuku is late once he explains a bent truth (not that Izuku really knew what the conversation was about enough to give a whole truth). And it isn’t like there’s much more Father could do to him—take away one of his quirks, sure, but with the Sports Festival coming up Izuku isn’t sure how motivated he’d be to do that.

 

So he spends the rest of the day in his room, churning away at the analysis, and when day turns to night, nothing changes.

 

And when night turns back to day, the only reason Izuku knows is by the alarm on his phone.

 

 

The school day passes not unlike yesterday, with Izuku trying to stay awake and working on his father’s homework in his free time. Until lunch break, at least, when Yagi (in his All Might form) pops around the corner and announces, “Midoriya-kun! Would you like to eat lunch with me?” He waves two bento boxes in the air.

 

And, usually, Izuku doesn’t mind interacting with Yagi—enjoys it, even—but he wasn’t expecting to, and the invitation catches him off guard. His face isn’t prepared for Yagi, doesn’t have enough time to mold into whatever expression it usually would, and he’s stuck in some liquid equilibrium between phases, between people.

 

Weights start shifting in Izuku’s mind as milliseconds countdown. Which rule is more important to his father? Not eating or not getting found out? He knows that, if he can help it, none of the rules of grounding should ever be broken (that’s what rules are), but he sees no out to this situation.

 

Izuku makes an instinctual call and hopes it won’t get his punishment extended.

 

“Sure!” He answers, and waves goodbye to what feels like nearly half his class.

 

The walk is short but silent, and unusually awkward as a tense aura fills the air. Izuku tries to hide his anxiety as they sit in the empty office and Yagi deflates before offering him one of the bento boxes.

 

“Thanks,” he says, taking the meal and sitting down. He picks at it with chopsticks, not daring to eat, as Yagi’s anxiety grows until he finally clears his throat.

 

“So, the sports festival is coming up,” Yagi notes.

 

Izuku nods and smiles. “What about it?”

 

“Usually, the person who placed first in the entrance exam gives the keynote speech, but... if you’d rather not...”

 

Izuku shakes his head. “No, I’m totally up for it. Thanks for checking in, though.”

 

He still needs to write that speech. Usually, he already would have had a draft at this point, but he’s been too busy with, well, you know.

 

“Are you sure?” Yagi asks, finally finding the conversation. “You don’t have to force yourself, my boy.”

 

“I’m sure.” He would rather not be recorded publicly for all the villains to analyze, but he knows his father wouldn’t accept anybody other than him up there.

 

They fall into silence, while Yagi slowly eats and Izuku pushes the food around in the bento.

 

“How are you doing?” Yagi finally asks. “I mean, I know... Do you want to talk about it?”

 

Izuku bristles automatically, the question weighing heavy on his empty stomach. He knows the right answer, that of course his father wants him to talk about it, which is why a soft, “Sure,” leaves his mouth automatically.

 

Yagi’s eyes widen in surprise and then he smooths his face into something softer, a little more approachable. “Oh, um, alright then.”

 

And then no one says anything.

 

Izuku sits, waiting for the inevitable leading question, the inevitable accusation, the inevitable compliment twisted into an insult.

 

But Yagi doesn’t mention how badly Izuku failed or ask why he made one tactical choice over another. Yagi just continues eating his lunch with growing concern.

 

The silence is odd, nothing like the silence at home—the space between thunder and lightning—instead it’s... comforting?

 

Izuku frowns.

 

“We don’t have to, if you don't want to,” Yagi quickly says.

 

You don’t have to be alright.

 

Izuku smiles before he’s realized he’s done it and has just enough time to wonder how honest his expression was before it falls.

 

Yagi smiles back, though, and the silence settles in.

 

Izuku even manages to take a bite of lunch.

 

A couple minutes later, Yagi’s eyes catch Izuku’s hands and he cringes. “About, er, One for All,” he starts, looking down and away. “We probably should’ve had this conversation a while ago, but... the way you’re using One for All isn’t... safe.”

 

The accusation hangs in the air and Izuku has to fight himself to not get defensive, has to remind himself that this isn’t Hisashi accusing him of using a quirk incorrectly, but instead his mentor (the number one hero) warning him he isn’t being safe. He doesn’t need to argue that he isn’t wrong. In fact, there’s no argument here.

 

Izuku tries, then, to imagine Yagi arguing with him, and fails so hard he ends up smiling.

 

“How?” Izuku asks, a new lightness to his voice he didn’t know he could achieve with adults. “Please, I’ll take all the advice you can give.”

 

Yagi smiles back. “I’m actually, not the best suited for this subject, oddly enough. Which is why I think you should intern with—“ he flinches into a whole-body cough that lasts too long before continuing. “—with my, erm, mentor, Gran Torino.”

 

“Gran Torino was your mentor?” Izuku asks, failing to keep the surprise out of his voice. How did he miss this, in his years of research? Of data-gathering and essay-writing and project-making? How did he miss Gran Torino?

 

“You know him?” Yagi asks, nearly equally surprised.

 

Of course Izuku knows—he doesn’t think there’s a hero out there, dead or alive, popular or underground, that he doesn’t know. But he simply shrugs and says, “I know of him, sure.”

 

“Yes, well, he’s likely the closest person to an expert on One for All. Depending on your performance in the sports festival, he’s told me he’ll consider the possibility of an internship. Of course, you don’t have to take it, but if he offers I highly recommend it.”

 

Izuku waves a hand. “No, no, it sounds like a great opportunity.” Honestly, he’d forgotten the purpose of the sports festivals was to advertise students for internships and one more decision made for him is one less thing he has to worry about.

 

- - -

 

Days pass in blurs, separated only by the occasional check-in with his father, worried comments by his classmates, planning for the sports festival, progress on the project, and the thickening of the pink aura around UA that he’s grown used to.

 

The report is harder than he’d like it to be, in more ways than he’d like. For one, recalling USJ is not something he’d like to be doing—in fact, Izuku would like to permanently forget the whole event as soon as possible, but the event-by-event and player analyses force him to go deeper into USJ than just being there had. Also, there’s information he simply doesn’t have—parts of the attack he wasn’t at, entire sectors and minutes unaccounted for—missing data. But Father won’t accept the excuse I wasn’t there or I was passed out and so Izuku searches.

 

Hacking into the police database is one of the last things Izuku wants to do, but failing to meet his Father’s expectations is the last thing he wants to do and so Izuku hacks into the police database, copying both the official USJ reports and the witness reports. It makes him feel sick but the repercussions for failing would be much worse.

 

He emails a pdf of the completed, thirty-odd page document to his father and then stares at his finished product. A complete break-down of the members and strategies of the League of Villain. Multiple theories on the nomu (how does a creature survive with multiple quirks? Izuku tries not to think about the question too hard and if he starts avoiding mirrors...). A complete break-down of the members and strategies of class 1-A, the on-scene heroes, and those that arrived later.

 

There’s so much information here. Did the detectives notice the odd mix of careful planning and spontaneity in the League’s strategy? Did they notice that none of the students were permanently injured, despite there being multiple opportunities? Did anyone notice that the students were placed in random sectors, regardless of their quirks?

 

Izuku itches with knowledge, the print version of his report staring at him like a death sentence with its color-coded tabs and protective plastic armor.

 

They might know it all, they might even know more. They should, being the professionals. But if there’s even the slightest chance they don’t, that this information could help when someone inevitably clashes with these villains again? Well, Izuku’s father never forbade him from sharing the report.

 

- - -

 

“What’s this?” Shouta asks, taking the folder from Midoriya anyway. The kid looks a little better, today. Some color has returned to his cheeks and his eyes. He’s smiling the Midoriya-smile, finally (not that Shouta particularly likes the expression—it’s obviously fake—it’s just that it’s Midoriya’s).

 

“An analysis of the USJ attack. I don’t know how helpful it will be, but I thought someone should have it.”

 

Shouta tenses and flips through the dozens of pages, seeing psychological profiles of villains Midoriya hadn’t exchanged more than three sentences with, a break down of the theoretical power structure of the League, an ungodly amount of theories on the nomu, and then analyses on the heroes and students, which Shouta doesn’t even have time to get into.

 

“Is this what you’ve been working on the past week?” Shouta asks.

 

Midoriya frowns and opens his mouth, but Shouta raises a hand to stop him.

 

“Let me rephrase. This is what you’ve been working on for the past week.” He closes the folder. “Why.”

 

He doesn’t ask the questions he wants to because he knows Midoriya won’t answer them. Why have you been breaking yourself for this? Why is this important to you? Why don't you trust that the authorities could have figured this out? (They didn’t, but not the point) Why did you spend so much time thinking about the nomu?

 

“There were...” Midoriya pauses in what Shouta now recognizes as Midoriya trying to find the perfect words. “Gaps in what I knew and didn’t. Insufficient information. I don’t like not knowing things.”

 

And Shouta supposes that, in some twisted, completely unhealthy way, this could be Midoriya’s attempt to cope with the attack. To make it make sense. But this is still going overboard, and it’s too neatly put-together for such an in-depth report written in a week.

 

It raises the more pressing question: how many villain attacks has this kid analyzed? And why is he analyzing villain attacks?

 

“Why did you bring this to me?” He asks instead, another question he wants answered, but one he might actually get answered.

 

Midoriya opens his mouth, then closes it. For barely a moment an expression of pure panicked confusion overtakes his face but he shuts it down immediately with practiced precision.

 

“You’re my homeroom teacher? And a hero?” Midoriya suggests, and they both know he doesn’t know the answer.

 

Shouta nods and says a gruff, “Thanks,” which he knows fails to portray the weight of the gratitude he feels.

Chapter Text

Nedzu devours the fifty-two page report before Aizawa has a chance to leave the room.

 

He’s only aware of Aizawa’s presence in the most tertiary of perceptions, fueled by a necessity to be fully conscious of his surroundings at all time. If Nedzu could, he would devote one hundred percent of his attention to Midoriya’s gift. But unfortunately Nedzu’s mind is much too active for that. Even now, with Aizawa in his peripheral and Midoriya’s words in his forefront, his brain remains unsatisfied--sifting through unfinished projects, unsolved problems, and open jobs in a futile attempt to keep what’s left of him occupied.

 

Aizawa is just standing up to go when Nedzu shuts the last page. Aizawa says nothing, but Nedzu can read the anxiety and curiosity on his face as easily as he can read kanji.

 

Nedzu’s face splits into the smile he’s been perfecting for years. Aizawa is fairly normalized to it, after years of exposure, but his muscles still tighten in a natural response to the predator Nedzu is.

 

“He’s surpassed my expectations,” Nedzu says with feigned lightness, as if his expectations are anything short of his own capabilities.

 

Aizawa’s fingers twitch--a subconscious movement towards his capture weapon--and his eyes widen--quirk at the ready, but he won’t call on it, not here. Not that it would have any use against Nedzu, anyway.

 

What knowledge should Nedzu impart upon Aizawa? Whatever he says will be passed along to the detective, no doubt, along with Aizawa’s hero friends. There’s a lot of information Nedzu gained from these pages--a wonderful amount. Both about the USJ attack and Midoriya himself. Nedzu still has yet to meet the boy, but he will fix that shortly after the Sports Festival.

 

Nedzu thumbs the pages, finding the choice of a printed media more telling than Midoriya likely had intended. It’s almost archaic, in this day and age--especially for a piece that references so many other works.

 

Midoriya’s report is a careful thing, written and torn apart and written again and broken down and written again. His words flow more like rhetoric than the expected neutrality of a scientific article, as if he’s arguing for something. No, trying to prove something. But what? Nedzu can’t discern the answer from these fifty-two pages alone. And he can’t stand not knowing.

 

There is information here that Midoriya, in all logic, should not have access to. Pieces of the attack analyzed as skillfully as Midoriya’s own experience, except he was nowhere near these zones. The theory that Midoriya interviewed every single one of his classmates passes through and out of Nedzu’s head quicker than a moment. Nedzu may be unable to ascertain the complete nature of intent which threads through the spine of this paper, but he can smell urgency in the security camera footage of the last week.

 

This is a war Nedzu’s been invited to. It thrums beneath his fur and through his bones with a familiar energy that isn’t unwanted. It calls to him silently, in nothing more than a feeling, but he knows better than to question his instincts; Nedzu appreciates his subconscious as the unnamable response to observations that it is.

 

This is a war of information, of ink on a page, of words and sentences and paragraphs. It reminds Nedzu of having to fight for his freedom, both with and against the legal system. Nedzu only wishes he knew who Midoriya is fighting. The League of Villains is the obvious--but incorrect--choice, for this war, at least.

 

So, what knowledge should Nedzu impart? Should he allow Aizawa to know that the near-clinical recall of Midoriya’s timeline (laced constantly with self-deprecation disguised as advice for future self-improvement) does not match up with his retelling to the detective? Should he allow Aizawa to know that Midoriya analyzed portions of the attack he shouldn’t have any information on? And that he did it to the same level of detail as the others? Should he allow Aizawa to know that Midoriya’s second theory on the nomu’s creation is a quirk which can give and take other quirks (and that this is exactly the quirk of Japan’s worst supervillain, five years dead)?

 

Nedzu places his paws under his chin. Only seconds have passed since he finished reading, since Aizawa stood up, since he last spoke. It took him only seconds for his brain to completely digest Midoriya's fifty-two pages.

 

“This is incredibly valuable information,” Nedzu decides, raising his eyes enough for Aizawa to notice the action.

 

Aizawa huffs out an affirmative.

 

Nedzu slides the report towards Aizawa. It’s in his head, now, packed tightly in between unsolved problems, USJ, and UA. He’ll never forget it.

 

He continues, just as cheerily as normal, but with an extra weight that has Aizawa rising to his full height, “Just be aware of the possible consequences of handing this over to the police. Midoriya-kun is already in a precarious place.”

 

Aizawa opens his mouth, likely to ask what consequences? but he comes to the wise realization that Nedzu would have already divulged that information if he was going to. Instead Aizawa lets out a grumbled, “Will do. Anything else?” And picks up the folder.

 

“Nope! Good luck!” Nedzu gives him an energetic wave.

 

Aizawa tenses and leaves without another word.

 

 

 

Four days later

 

“Ah, fuck,” Katsuki grunts.

 

“What?” Kirishima whispers back, knocking their shoulders together so they’re close enough to communicate.

 

Katsuki naturally pulls away, an interaction both of them have become extremely familiar with, but the distance between them is slightly shorter than it was last time. “We better hope they gave him a fucking time limit. Otherwise we’ll never get to the actual festival,” Kastuki groans as Izuku struts up to the stage.

 

Katsuki can feel Kirishima’s eyes on him--Kirishima probably has that look he gets whenever Izuku gets brought up or just gets a little too close to Katsuki for comfort. Katsuki hasn’t been able to decipher it, yet, but he knows he doesn’t trust it.

 

“Thank you, Midnight,” Izuku announces as he takes the microphone with a short bow.

 

Katsuki doesn’t try to hide his scowl.

 

The last time Izuku gave a speech was just a few months ago, when their principal thought it was a good idea to pick Izuku for their middle school graduation speech.

 

It lasted nearly half an hour.

 

“Today, we welcome the next generation of students,” Izuku starts with a subtle, yet dramatic, flare. “Of future heroes... engineers, programmers, designers... analysts, executives... and all-around successful adults. The primary attention may be on the hero courses, but we should not forget that this is a holistic event. We should not forget the support students who have spent the last month creating just for this--”

 

A girl with bright pink hair lets out a terribly obnoxious, “ Yeah! ” that echoes throughout the arena.

 

Izuku continues with barely a pause, “We should not forget the management students, who will undoubtedly spend the event analyzing their fellow students. We should not forget the gen-ed students, as they fought tooth and nail for this chance, often facing greater adversity than many of us could ever imagine. We should not forget that, just as the hero course students are competing today, so are everyone else.”

 

There’s a heavy pause, his words cutting through the silence.

 

“The decision to hold the sports festival despite the recent attack on class 1-A was not an easy one, and despite the... dangers of publicity, I do agree there was no other choice. It is now that we all must stand strong, a united force against evil. Everyone from heroes to engineers to managers... police officers, doctors, teachers and parents... artists, writers, and everyone in between. This fight is not won by heroes alone, but by us all... Thank you.”

 

- - -

 

Izuku walks off the stage, stuffing the overanalysis of his performance to the back of his mind. He can watch the video later.

 

He’s still walking to his place when Midnight starts announcing the “random” selection process for the first game. Izuku knows that it’s impossible to leave something like this up to chance--that most of the games require too much set-up and their principal is too controlling.

 

Izuku is eighty percent sure he knows what game will be announced. It will be an individual challenge, something to quickly cull a majority of the students. If Mei was right about what she saw in Cementos’ office--

 

“An obstacle course!” Midnight announces as the giant screen displays the words.

 

Guess Mei was right.

 

 

 

Three days ago

 

It’s the best coffee he’s had in his entire life. Not because it’s particularly great, but because it’s the second cup he’s had in days.

 

Izuku can already feel his headache receding.

 

Hitamoro nurses a smoothie that would make anyone else puke as Saza stares at her phone like nothing else exists.

 

“Can we get down to business?” Saza drawls. “I have plans, later.”

 

Hitamoro scoffs. “You? What are you gonna do, study?”

 

Saza doesn’t respond save for a narrowing of her eyes.

 

Izuku finally relinquishes the possessive hold of his mug.

 

The cafe is a long way from UA and convenient for exactly none of them. It’s frequented most often by retired, older folks, or young adults who like a traditional aesthetic in concept, but not actuality. The chance of them running into any other UA students here is practically zero.

 

“Saza-san, thank you again for your help. What do you have?” Izuku asks, voice rich with honest appreciation.

 

She places a folder on the center of the table. “Basic profiles of Class 1-B: quirk, middle school, some training experience, score on the entrance exam, and whatever other random information they wanted to give me.”

 

“And what?” Hitamoro starts, arms crossed, suspicion clear. “They just gave this all to you? You aren’t even in their class.”

 

Saza sighs and just barely refrains from rolling her eyes. “I’m in the management course. I told them I was collecting statistics on the hero students so I could start determining who I’d be interested in for future endorsements. It isn’t exactly a lie and with the sports festival coming up, no one really questioned it.” She twists her lips into a condescending grimace. “I suggest you don’t question my capabilities again, especially as you already owe me.”

 

Hitamoro lets out a hiss before collapsing back onto their smoothie in reluctant acceptance.

 

Izuku watches the natural back-and-forth, trying to bury his feelings of otherness and failing.

 

Hitamoro and Saza had never really been close--in reality, Saza hadn’t been close to any of them--but after the break-in, the two had bonded. For some odd reason, something about Hitamoro owing Saza their soul. The two make an odd pair, on the surface. Hitamoro’s glowing neon blue eyes, chipped teeth, more piercings than Izuku can count, and blatant disregard for their own safety make them something next to punk. While Saza would be the embodiment of a class president stereotype with her grey-blue bob, put-together outfits, wide glasses, and blind confidence if it weren’t for her automatic disregard of the rules as soon as they stand in her way.

 

Izuku thumbs through the profiles, not with the intent of analyzing them, but just to double-check that the information he needs is there. It is. All twenty of them.

 

“Thank you, Saza-san, this is perfect.”

 

“Of course it is,” she states--not with pride, but like it’s an obvious fact.

 

Hitamoro scoffs. “I don’t have anything fancy like an entire folder, but it’d be pointless anyway. Only like a dozen kids out of all the gen-ed courses are gonna try, and only like three of them might stand a chance. Plus maybe this one guy who won’t tell anyone anything. We even sicc’d Suda’s puppy dog eyes on him and he just ran off.”

 

“Interesting...” Izuku starts. “Who are the three?” He would have liked data on all the gen-ed students, finding himself hesitant to trust the judgement of someone else. But Izuku tells himself that 1) he didn’t give Hitamoro a lot of forewarning and 2) Hano and Suda definitely helped out, as well.

 

“There’s this one kid, Shunichi something. His mouth isn’t on his face, it takes up his entire back. It’s weird but hella badass. He keeps it hidden so I don’t have more info on it, but he has some real potential. There’s this girl, uh, Yoichi Rea, who knows all the possible outcomes to a situation. Problem is, supposedly it’s all the possible outcomes, so I’m not sure how effective it actually is.”

 

“Why isn’t she in the management course?” Saza interjects.

 

“What, you gonna ask Wakita why she isn’t in the hero course, next?”

 

“Fair point,” Saza replies instantly.

 

“Yoichi says she’s in therapy and also getting quirk training so...?” Hitamoro shrugs. “Okino, I think the other’s name is, knows your honest answer to any question she asks you, which is totally underrated. Like, that’s honestly terrifying the government should just hire her tomorrow. I’m not sure how helpful it’ll be for the sports festival but it’s pretty OP.”

 

Analyses start bouncing around in Izuku’s head, possibilities and theories and hero costumes based on nothing but a quirk and a name. He can see it, already, a Sports Festival in which Shunichi wins--another in which Shunichi loses in the first round. There are so many factors to take into consideration. He’ll need more data before he can make any real predictions of note.

 

“Thanks, Hitamoro-kun, that’s very helpful.”

 

They wave a hand. “No problem. We all owe you basically everything, anyway. It’s literally the least I can do. I don’t think my debt will be repaid until I hide a body for you. Honestly it might make two.”

 

Before Izuku can decide whether to laugh, insist that’s definitely unnecessary and also illegal, or tell Hitamoro he has a body needing hid right now, Saza asks Izuku, “Did Wakita-san get back to you about the support departments?”

 

Izuku relaxes at the change of subject. “Yes, she did. The only student self-sufficient enough to actually compete is Mei-chan, and she only wants to advertise her gear. They don’t let the support students collaborate for the festival so they only really have a chance if they have skills in hardware, software, and engineering. They can only use gear they make completely themselves.”

 

“That’s stupid,” Saza states.

 

Izuku just shrugs. “Apparently it’s for fairness, or something. Administration is afraid if they let them work together, they’d create some over-powered tool and automatically win.”

 

“Still stupid,” Saza reiterates. “They just want to ensure someone from the hero course wins.”

 

Izuku neither refutes or affirms that statement.

 

 

 

Present day

 

Watch the Sports Festival, Sensei had said. It’ll be fun, Sensei had said.

 

And then the BBEG (the one who got Tomura exiled for two weeks) talked for three minutes like he was in a fucking cutscene. He also managed to make his speech into a call to war, for whatever reason.

 

Why Tomura has to watch this live, he doesn’t really know. There are dozens of news companies, not even counting the independent streamers, recording this. It would obviously be easier to analyze with the ability to, y’know, pause. But Sensei wants him to watch it live so watch it live Tomura does.

 

He’s sitting on his couch, a feed of the first-year festival on the flat screen, a different feed on his PC atop the coffee table, and his phone ready for “notes”. He’s never been one for note-taking, the act of sitting down and spending time to collect his thoughts utterly unproductive. Most of his planning happens in his mind, with half of it and his hands occupied by a video game.

 

Sensei knows this, of course, and has long given up trying to force him to organize his thoughts after seeing the incomprehensible chaos that is his written word, but sometimes Tomura keeps up the pretense.

 

Tomura has just enough time to think about texting himself the phrase call to war? when the first level starts.

 

An obvious division occurs immediately--the experienced players and the newbs. They’re funnelled into a tunnel which isn’t wide enough, AKA an obvious trap, but a handful of hero students still run towards it without hesitation.

 

When the entire hallway freezes over, thick enough to capture the feet of the unlucky ones, Tomura just snorts.

 

The rest use varying methods to pass or just... don’t, staying back in a sign of forfeit.

 

The ice kid is the first out, followed initially by no one and then a small, staggered group. Tomura is fairly certain most or all of them were at the USJ attack, but his short-term memory has always been crap and the “trip”, as Sensei is calling it, to Australia didn’t help.

 

It takes the explosion of a robot three times larger than the average person for Tomura to realize he hasn’t seen a single frame of Midoriya. The realization claws into his neck.

 

It doesn’t make sense. At USJ, once Midoriya appeared Tomura couldn’t get rid of him. Like some virus or a fucking Windows update. And Midoriya’s the only competent one there, he should be leading the pack by miles.

 

So where is he?

 

The frozen kid has already made it through to the next obstacle--nothing but tightropes--by the time Tomura catches a glimpse of Midoriya. Tomura sees him on the big screen, on UA’s official feed, which is somehow capable of showing names and real-time placements above the participants heads.

 

Midoriya Izuku is at fifteenth.

 

Tomura’s nails break skin.

 

He watches the official feed with a newfound interest, barely taking the time to blink. Most of the screen time is going to the head of the pack--ice kid--and kids fucking up. But when the camera does finally catch Midoriya again--

 

15th

 

Still? How is that possible? Tomura saw an ass in fifth drop to thirtieth in seven seconds flat, and some crazy girl who had been in twelfth stopped advancing to help a fellow support student with one of their inventions when it started malfunctioning. The order was nowhere near steady. There was no reason for Midoriya to still be at 15th.

 

Tomura’s fingers pause their search for the answer under his skin when the camera successfully catches Midoriya’s advancement through the minefield (the victor is announced as Todoroki Shouto but Tomura doesn’t care).

 

Midoriya is watching the girl in front of him and the boy behind him more intently than the actual mines. The girl jumps over the minefield as if she weighs nothing, and the boy runs straight through, eyes on the ground. Midoriya runs at the exact speed of the boy, but in a snaked path, keeping the other exactly a meter behind him the whole time. Midoriya’s fingers twitch in some tell Tomura can’t read.

 

Tomura growls at his ignorance as Midoriya ends the obstacle race in fifteenth place.

 

- - -

 

Ochako doesn’t really know what to think. She’s pretty proud of her placement. She had been aiming for top ten, so fourteenth is a little bit of a let down, but it isn’t bad. She’s competing against people like Midori and Todoroki, after all.

 

Which makes Midori’s appearances around Ochako throughout the entire race, well, confusing. Ochako had seen Midori tear apart a zero-pointer without hesitation at the entrance exam, with nothing more than a thought!

 

So how does he end fifteenth (behind Ochako) while Todoroki gets first? Not that Todoroki isn’t a formidable opponent, of course! She’d watched his performance at the battle trials.

 

“Midori!” Ochako greets, hoping her smile is convincing enough. She raises a hand for a high-five, which he slaps enthusiastically.

 

“Uraraka-chan, good job! I’m impressed you used your quirk on yourself so often. Your stamina is getting better!”

 

“You did great, too!” Ochako says, although it falls a little flat and her smile starts wavering. Iida’s advice bounces around in her head--be direct, honest, say what you mean. “I’m just a little, er, confused, I guess? I was expecting you to place higher. No offense, or anything! And I don’t want to be placing any expectations on you, it’s just you did so well in the entrance exam and...”

 

Midori chuckles; the sound is fond. “I understand, Uraraka-chan. But your expectations come from the assumption that this is a single event, and not part of a larger competition. In the long run, the only placement that matters is the final one.”

 

Ochako opens and closes her mouth for a few seconds, letting that revelation sink in. “But aren’t we supposed to be showing off for the hero agencies?”

 

Midori’s smile drops into a frown. “Heroes aren’t the only ones watching.”

 

The speakers crackle as Midnight takes the mic and announces the next event, including the value of Todoroki’s band--ten million.

 

Ochako wonders just how much of it Midori predicted, if that’s the real reason he didn’t get first place.

 

- - -

 

“Izuku! You made it!” Mei greets with a meaty smack to his back. “Us support students gotta stick together.”

 

“I’m not in the support department, Mei-chan,” Izuku replies. “But I’d love a team-up.”

 

Uraraka rings her hands together, looking between the two anxiously. “Hey, Midori. If it’s alright, I was thinking about teaming with someone else? I guess, I want to meet more people, if I can.”

 

Iida steps up beside her, nodding. “I was also planning on expanding my social circle. I do not want to keep relying on you forever, Midoriya-san.”

 

“That’s totally fine, guys! You do you.”

 

They leave him with smiles and wishes of good luck.

 

“Well then! We still need two more. Any ideas, planner man?” Mei asks, her attention already on one of her many inventions.

 

Izuku has many ideas, but they are all reliant on other people. Mostly, their willingness to work with him.

 

Considering that a lot of the inventions Mei brought (he recognizes them from the workshop and because she wouldn’t stop talking about them) rely on maneuverability, Sero or Ashido would be good choices. However, they’re both friendly with Katsuki, so Izuku would feel sort of weird trying to recruit them. He could try reaching out to 1-B, but he hasn’t gotten much of a chance to socialize there, yet, so chances are they wouldn’t care. He’d like to have someone with range, as well, which leaves... Aoyama, really.

 

Izuku clicks his tongue.

 

“Class rep,” Tokoyami suddenly says. “Are you in need of another soldier to assist you in the upcoming battle?”

 

Izuku smiles. A versatile quirk with some range, and Tokoyami’s skill in handling it is one of the best of the class’ (necessary, for if he couldn’t control it, it would control him). It has some obvious weaknesses, but they’re both well aware of them.

 

Izuku straightens his back, fixes his heels together, and raises his chin. “I am, Tokoyami-san. If you’ll have me as your commander, your assistance would be invaluable in the fight against darkness.”

 

Tokoyami stands up taller before bowing.

 

“Ooo, fun!” Mei exclaims, sparing a glance from the final touches on her invention. “If bird-guy’s a soldier and you’re the commander can I get a fancy title, too? Should I call you Izuku-kakka?”

 

“You’d be the engineer, of course,” Izuku answers without hesitation. “Tokoyami-san, do you have any recommendations for our final recruit?”

 

“There are few who could shine a light into the darkness... However, I may have an idea.”

 

 

Tokoyami comes back half a minute later with Asui.

 

“You’re intimidating, Izuku,” she says without cadence as they shake hands, “and I’m not sure if I trust you yet, but you’re strong.”

 

“Hey, Izuku-kakka,” Mei suddenly asks. “Isn’t one of your quirks like a telekinetic attraction or something?”

 

Izuku answers with a smile.

 

- - -

 

Plans are, of course, fallible things, and with so many other humans acting as independent variables, Mei isn’t really sure how long it’ll last. But she trusts Izuku--that he’ll have enough backups to get them through this.

 

The few teams who do give them any attention learn quickly that they’re playing a(n effective) defensive game, and don’t come back after a mix of Mei’s babies and Tokoyami’s partner thwart them with ease. Mei cackles about the specifications of her children as and after she uses them (although the only ones within earshot are her own team). Occasionally Izuku inputs some advice he has on improvement, or a compliment on her design, but otherwise they’re smoothly skirting along the edge of all action. They successfully deflect any focus off to the other teams. Izuku’s name only crosses the loudspeakers once, when Present Mic asks Eraserhead if he’s “surprised by Midorya-kun’s performance, or lack-thereof? He is the one who broke the record for the entrance exam, right?” Eraserhead doesn’t respond.

 

They’ve somehow managed to lose none of their original headbands. They got close, once, but the dude literally dropped it before he could put it around his neck, and Tsu licked it up with ease. The guy looked real confused for real long, though, so Mei silently questions whether he really did just drop it.

 

Izuku’s Crazy Turntable Plan (that isn’t the official title, but that’s what Mei’s been calling it in her head) starts without fanfare. Mei herself might not have noticed if it weren’t for the buzz that shocks throughout all four of their bodies in place of an alarm (she had meant to lower the voltage before the festival but never got around to it). It starts with a headband appearing in Izuku’s hand, and him draping it over his head casually, like it had been his all along.

 

Exactly four seconds later, it really starts. Yes, Mei counts them--she knows from here on out it will be exactly one minute, exactly sixty seconds that will make or break their success.

 

Mei knows very little about Izuku’s quirk(s)--she knows very little about Izuku himself--he keeps his cards close to his chest. But she assumes that, at the very least, using his quirk requires roughly the same sort of things picking an object up with his hand would, sans a hand. Quirk-pulling an object towards him most likely requires he thinks about the action and also that he expends some amount of energy. This is, of course, nothing but the hypothesis of a teenaged scientist whose specialty is engineering, but Mei thinks it makes quite a lot of sense.

 

So, when a wave of headbands converge upon their team faster, and in higher volume, than Mei can keep track of (even with her quirk-improved eyesight), it is either quite the feat, premeditated, or the most likely option: a mix of both.

 

Tokoyami and Tsuyu flounder to pick up the ones that don’t make it into Izuku’s hands, but looking around Mei knows it matters less that their team has more points, and more that the other teams have less.

 

Mei has never considered herself religious--except for that week in fourth grade, when she realized it’s impossible to prove something doesn’t exist and ergo a god could exist--but the only word that comes to mind in the wake of Izuku stealing nearly every single headband at once is: purge. Mei will likely introspectively psycho-analyze this thought, later, when they aren’t in the middle of uprooting the entire game.

 

As the other contenders attempt to render this abrupt change, lagging with shock, Present Mic’s voice rings throughout the stadium, “A game-changing play from Midoriya Izuku! He’s finally made his first move!”

 

“No,” Eraserhead calmly replies in a perfect contrast to Present Mic as the first adjusted group throws themselves towards Mei’s. Mei shoots her own group into the air with the help of her jetpack, and no doubt, the help of Izuku aiming them with that versatile telekinetic quirk of his. Tsuyu drags one of the enemies acting as a foundation with them, Tokoyami’s shadow knocks back the other, and the team falls as Eraserhead says, “Midoriya’s been making moves the entire time. You just didn’t see any of them.”

 

Mei’s senses are overwhelmed with chaos, the next twenty-seven seconds a blur of intuitive action and counting.

 

Mei had assumed Izuku took all the headbands, although it quickly becomes obvious he didn’t--he only took all the headbands from the hero course students. Todoroki’s group, however, had somehow managed to scrounge up three more headbands in those twenty-seven seconds.

 

Izuku says nothing but a quick, “Targeting Todoroki-san,” that wastes barely a second.

 

That leaves them twenty-eight seconds left.

 

They could finish while playing a defensive game, the six headbands around Izuku’s neck more than enough to win, but Mei knows that this is more than just about winning for all of them. This is about putting on a show, proving they (or in Mei’s case, her gadgets) are worth something (whether that be an internship or a sponsorship).

 

Their two groups meet sooner than they should--quicker than their initial velocities indicated their collision would be. It disrupts Mei’s expectations, leaves her rickety and attempting to balance to her jetpack.

 

She watches, unable to react, as a hand reaches for the headbands around Izuku’s neck. In response all three of Todoroki’s bands fly towards Izuku and then all Mei knows is fire.
Notes:

    I really enjoyed writing Nedzu’s POV!!! Like it was super interesting and fun! Hope y’all enjoy it and this entire chapter as well!
    Also, I finally started Welcome to Night Vale, like halfway through writing this chapter, so if the tone is a little inconsistent that would be why lol sorry.
    Pretty random but I have a couple recommendations for media that have similar themes/atmospheres or evoke similar emotions to this fic. The most obvious one (to me) is Bates Motel (the mother-son relationship has similarities to AFO and Izuku’s) although it is pretty challenging to watch with the heavy amount of emotional manipulation. Hannibal is another one (for its depiction of people manipulating each other, lots of lying, reading people, and also a high-empathy character) but keep in mind there is quite a lot of gore (it’s about a serial killer). If you have any recommendations of your own or have responses to these, I’d love to read them in the comments!

    Edit 1/27/21: replaced "ten years" with the more accurate "five years" in scene 1

Chapter 18: Don't blame it on the kids

    I'm back!! Thank you all for sticking with this despite my six months of radio silence! I really appreciate each and every one of you!!!

Chapter Text

Shouto stands completely still in the emptying arena, staring down his sizzling hand.

 

He’s suffocating with a feeling he recognizes all too well but refuses to name. It isn’t his to name, just another unwanted gift his father forced upon him.

 

He lifts his gaze just enough to watch Midoriya’s slowly retreating back. He’ll be unhurt, but Shouto’s afraid to find out if it’s due to his healing quirk or Shouto pulling back at the last possible second, redirecting his father’s flames into the ground the moment he became aware of them, the moment after he already grabbed the headband.

 

He should have reacted sooner. Scratch that, he never should have brought the flames out in the first place.

 

He can barely breath. Pathetic. He wasn’t the one nearly burnt.

 

Air abandons him but Shouto is all-too-familiar with anxiety attacks. Knows how to hide the fact that he’s dying behind blank eyes and clenched fists. Why should he get to breath, anyway?

 

Endeavor named this feeling shame, gave it to him for his fourth birthday. Shouto’s had it ever since.

 

 

Shouto follows the crowd of students out of habit, finding himself in the stuffy, crowded locker room 1-A’s laid claim to.

 

There’s so much noise that he can’t hear anything.

 

A hand on his upper arm sends a painful ringing through his ears and into his heart. Sharp clarity washes over him as he recognizes Yaoyorozu.

 

“Congratulations,” she says in her quiet, steady voice. “We did it.”

 

Shouto nods in acknowledgement and wills the beating of his heart to steady.

 

Iida steps forward. “Team leader!” he announces. “Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to be a member of your team!” He holds out a hand which Shouto blatantly ignores. “I was wondering... I thought your quirk was ice; where’d the fire come from?”

 

Shouto swallows down the nausea and walks past Iida to hide in a seat in the corner of the room. He pulls out his phone as a shield, absorbing none of the information as he idly scrolls through the news.

 

By the time his hands stop shaking, the door opens and Midoriya walks in.

 

Shouto hesitates a second, but then he’s up and weaving through the crowd of peers he’s vaguely starting to recognize. “Midoriya.” His voice cuts through the ambient chatter, silencing everyone. “We need to talk.”

 

 

“So, what’d you want to talk about?” Midoriya asks with a soft, welcoming smile that’s just as fake as the rest of his smiles. He leans against the opposite side of the hallway, infinitely more relaxed than Shouto—or at least appearing more relaxed.

 

Shouto can never tell with Midoriya—what really is Midoriya versus what Midoriya is showing him. For a couple seconds Shouto’s anxiety spikes with doubt, with all the reasons he shouldn’t talk about this. But he takes a deep breath.

 

If he’s going to tell anybody, it’s going to be Midoriya.

 

He isn’t sure why it has to be Midoriya, not exactly. But something about him feels... almost familiar. That smile of his is one Shouto recognizes. Everything about him perfectly measured, as if he’s constantly aware of every little thing he does, constantly weighing the possible repercussions of every single word he says.

 

It reminds Shouto of someone, he just doesn’t know who.

 

 

Roughly ten years ago

 

 

“What’s happening?” Shouto asks, watching his mom rush around the kitchen with a speed he rarely sees from her. He hovers at the edge of the room, somewhere between nervous and curious.

 

His mom pauses her dance to smile at him, although all it does is push him closer to nervousness. “Enj—your father is joining us for dinner,” she tells him before going back to action.

 

“Why?” he asks.

 

She doesn’t answer for what feels like the longest of times, although based on her progress, it likely wasn’t that long at all. “Because we’re family,” she finally tells him. “It’s what families do.”

 

He believes it because she says it and Shouto believes his mom.

 

Who else is he going to believe?

 

“Can I help?” he asks.

 

The smile she sends him this time makes him feel less-bad. She tells him, “Of course, my little snow lily,” and before he knows it dinner is cooked—the biggest meal Shouto has ever seen—and the table is covered with the prettiest dishes and fabrics, ones they never eat with.

 

They usually start eating as soon as everyone has sat down, so that’s what Shouto reaches to do. But then Fuyumi grabs his wrist, nothing more than gentle contact, before Shouto can touch the fork.

 

“Not yet,” Fuyumi whispers.

 

Shouto pulls his hand back. “Why?”

 

“We have to wait for Endeavor.”

 

Right. Endeavor is coming, for some reason. But why would that change anything? Every other night, the rest of them eat without him.

 

“Why?” Shouto asks again, confused.

 

Fuyumi twitches in her seat.

 

Across from Shouto, his mother lets out a quiet, “Shouto...” that silences him.

 

In a perfect mirror of her smile, Shouto frowns.

 

 

They wait.

 

The longer they wait the more restless Shouto gets, the bottled up energy of a four-year-old unused to such prolonged containment, even in the Todoroki household. He can’t even distract himself by listening, as there’s nothing to listen to. His mom and sister have been wrapped in a thick, warm blanket of silence, and breaking it would feel wrong.

 

Then, the door opens. Too loud. Footsteps. Mom stands up, fixes her dress, smiles the smile that makes Shouto want to cry. But he doesn’t. Instead he stands up, too, with Fuyumi following at his side. She stands tall, but watches the ground. Shouto looks too, wondering what’s down there that’s so interesting.

 

“Ah, welcome home, Enji!” his mom exclaims as the room raises in temperature.

 

“What’s for dinner?” Endeavor asks as he tears out his chair and sits down at the head of the table.

 

After Fuyumi sits down, Shouto follows.

 

“Your favorite, Enji. How was your day?” She’s still smiling. Why does she smile more when Endeavor’s here, but look less happy?

 

Chopsticks hit a plate. Shouto doesn’t look away from his mother but he hears it.

 

“This is cold,” Endeavor bites out. His mom flinches, stands up and throws herself into a rushed bow so deep and quick her hair hits the table.

 

“I’m sorry, Endeavor. It’s my fault. I didn’t time it right. I should have known—”

 

“It’s fine,” Endeavor snaps. “I can warm it up.”

 

Mom exhales, sits back down, and smiles.

 

“Shouto,” Endeavor announces.

 

Shouto looks up. All he sees is big. He sees sharp angles. Sharp eyes. Fire.

 

“How was your day?” Endeavor asks.

 

With a lot of effort, Shouto answers, “Good.”

 

Endeavor starts to frown but then Mom speaks up, “He got an A on his math quiz, the top grade in the class! And today he was incredibly helpful in the kitchen.”

 

“The kitchen?” Endeavor slams a hand onto the table. His fire swells. “You put my son in the kitchen?”

 

Fuyumi jumps and his mom tenses, but her smile doesn’t fade, only softens.

 

“Enji—”

 

“Don’t!”

 

Mom leans forward, rests a calm hand on Endeavor’s burning arm. “Why don’t we talk about this after dinner? It’s so rare for all four of us to be together.”

 

Endeavor looks at Shouto for a moment and grunts before collapsing into his seat. “Fine.”

 

Mom shakes as she sits back down, but the smile she gives Shouto tells him you’re gonna be okay.

 

 

Present day

 

 

“Todoroki-kun?”

 

Shouto startles, shaken out of his realization. Midoriya has his mother’s smile. That smile which expresses every emotion but happiness. Which acts as a shield, the last line of defense. A survival mechanism which Endeavor beat into her.

 

So where did Midoriya’s come from?

 

So who hurt Midoriya?

 

He looks Midoriya in his eyes and before he can convince himself out of it, says, “How much do you know about quirk marriages?”

 

The rest comes easily after that.

 

 

“You’re my greatest threat,” Shouto concludes, hands tightening into fists at his side. “If I’m going to prove I don’t need my father, I need to beat you without using his quirk.”

 

Midoriya has, over the course of Shouto’s monologue, been slowly closing off. His smile shrank into an unreadable, pursed lips and the light in his eyes (that Shouto hadn’t noticed before) died out.

 

Shouto doesn’t have anything more to say, so after a couple seconds of silence he moves to leave, the declaration hanging between them.

 

“But—” Midoriya interrupts, voice quiet and unsure, sounding nothing like the Midoriya that Shouto has come to recognize. His eyebrows are scrunched in confusion as he stares down at the palms of his hands. “You were born with that quirk, so it’s yours, right? It’s not like Endeavor took you by the hand when you were five and transferred his quirk to you. He has his own quirk, and you have yours. They’re unrelated.”

 

Shouto stares in silence for a moment, trying to understand what the fuck Midoriya is talking about. “Huh?” he ends up asking.

 

Midoriya finally looks up, the most honest expression Shouto has ever seen on his face—confliction, confusion, sadness. “No one gave you that quirk, Todoroki-kun.” He rubs his palms together and swallows. “You were born with it—both halves. It came in naturally when you were four.”

 

“I got the fire from Endeavor,” Shouto states, disconnecting himself from the spite the words bring him.

 

Midoriya cringes and completely intertwines his hands together. “You’re not—you’re not understanding me,” he whispers.

 

“You’re right,” Shouto bites out. This was a mistake.

 

He turns to leave, but Midoriya takes a sharp, deep breath and asks, “If you lose, what will happen? What will Endeavor do?”

 

Shouto freezes, the question catching him off guard simply because it’s the last thing he expected to be asked—because he’s never been asked the question before.

 

He doesn’t turn back to Midoriya, instead staring past the hallway at the near-empty arena. His first instinct is to lie—of course it is, that’s what Endeavor has ingrained into him—but he doesn’t want to lie to Midoriya. Or, rather, he feels he doesn’t have to. If Midoriya’s situation is even remotely like Shouto’s... then maybe he’ll actually believe him. Maybe he’ll even understand.

 

“He calls it training,” Shouto states matter-of-factly, pretending the words don’t hurt him. “The sports festival is rather important to him, so it would probably last until he’s called out again.”

 

Shouto’s expecting awkward silence, or maybe a sorry, but instead Midoriya says, his normal energy miraculously back, “You’re strong, Todoroki-kun. Don’t forget to be proud of yourself for making it this far.”

 

- - -

 

Izuku watches Todoroki’s back, swallowing down his nausea with practiced ease.

 

He’d seen the signs, of course. Todoroki came to school with an aura paled by pain more often than not, and he was unusually anxious around adults—heroes. Most people calmed around heroes, but Todoroki got tenser.

 

Izuku hadn’t known exactly why, but after learning about Endeavor... it all makes sense.

 

Izuku can’t imagine what it must be like, fearing for your safety from a parent, the one person who’s supposed to love and protect you unconditionally.

 

Izuku’s father is difficult sometimes but—no, putting his father even anywhere near Endeavor feels disrespectful to Todoroki and... selfish. Inaccurate. Hypochondriacal... if that even makes sense.

 

His father has never hurt him—would never. He may be challenging to communicate with at times, but that’s nothing—nothing —compared to what Todoroki goes through.

 

The thought of coming home and wondering whether you were going to be hurt or not? It makes Izuku’s stomach churn. It isn't right.

 

- - -

 

“Are y’all ready for our first one-on-one battle? Let me hear your cries of excitement!” Midnight announces.

 

Not at all surprisingly, the arena roars in response.

 

“For our opening act, we have quite the match-up! Midoriya Izuku, from the hero class 1-A, who everyone’s saying is a candidate to win this whole event. He broke Endeavor’s previous record in the entrance exam. He blew us all away with his team’s shocking performance in the cavalry battles. Let’s all give Midoriya Izuku a hot welcome!”

 

Hitoshi wonders how the fuck he's supposed to follow that introduction. How anyone thought it was a good idea to put some random Gen-Ed kid up against probably the best student in 1-A.

 

Hitoshi would be more surprised to learn this festival wasn't rigged than the other way round.

 

“And, on the opposing side is Shinsou Hitoshi! The first general education student to make it to the one-on-ones in fifteen years, he’s giving class 1-C the representation they deserve. He’s mysterious. He’s the underdog. He—”

 

Midnight continues her crowd-pleasing speech but Hitoshi’s no longer listening, distracted by the fact that Midoriya’s started talking.

 

“I’m sorry for my behavior last week. I was extremely rude and I regret that that was our first meeting.” Midoriya sinks into a deep bow. “I’d like to start over, if you’ll allow me. My name is Midoriya Izuku. I wish you the best of luck.”

 

Hitoshi watches for a moment, tries to figure out what the play is, tries to figure out what motivated Midoriya to say this before the match has started.

 

He knows next-to-nothing about Midoriya. The only thing he knows for sure is that he broke the entrance exam’s record, everything else are nothing but rumours. Gossip that Midoriya rigged the entrance exam so he couldn't lose. Gossip that he’s going to be one of his year’s Big Three. That no one actually knows anything of substance about him. That he’s actually a student of the support department. That he’s a vigilante, or a Hollywood actor from America, or even a villain mole.

 

So, in reality, it would probably be more helpful if Hitoshi knew nothing. Then at least he wouldn’t have all these conspiracy theories vying for time in his head.

 

Midnight shouts, "And let the first battle... begin!" and there's a loud sound that's something between a buzzer and a gunshot.

 

There’s only one thing Hitoshi can do in this situation. He reverts to his only weapon.

 

“Fuck you,” Hitoshi spits. It’s short, but more often than not enough to get a reaction. The cuss will bait those who care about that shit and the personal attack will bait the egotistical.

 

But all Midoriya does is rise from his bow slowly, one eyebrow raised. He almost looks... amused.

 

Hitoshi doesn’t have time to ponder, so he continues without hesitation. “You think I need luck? Do you realize how fucking patronizing that sounds? Just because I’m not a hero student I have to rely on luck to win?”

 

Hitoshi gives a seconds pause, space enough for a response, for Midoriya to defend his intentions and morals. But Midoriya just watches. Eyes never leaving Hitoshi, as if he’s analyzing him.

 

The second lasts too long, until it turns into more seconds, and Midoriya waves a hand as if to say continue.

 

Hitoshi bristles. He doesn't have any other options, though, so he says, “And what was with Ojiro giving up his spot? The coward. What was he, scared he was gonna lose to some gen-ed kid?” When Midoriya still doesn’t respond, Hitoshi switches gears. “And you—who the fuck are you? People are spreading rumours like wildfire, you know. Actor. Support student. Some hero’s bastard son. Villain—” it physically hurts Hitoshi to use that word against someone else, when it’s been used against him so many times. He’d literally rather pull out his own wisdom teeth with his own fingers. But he refuses to give up without a fight.

 

Midoriya’s face closes off. The raised eyebrow falls flat. The slight amused curve in his lips neutralizes until it looks like he doesn’t have any emotions left.

 

Midoriya steps forward. Hitoshi steps back, swallows down his anxiety uselessly.

 

Fuck.

 

Words flow from Hitoshi on impulse, the filter between his brain and mouth fled in desperation. He spouts accusations of villainy he’s heard all his life, already regretting each one before they leave his lips.

 

He’s out of bounds without ever seeing Midoriya’s quirk.

 

- - -

 

Izuku feels... weird.

 

On one hand, there’s this pit growing in his stomach that doesn’t belong there.

 

On the other, Shinsou Hitoshi feels familiar. Izuku’s excited to have met another student who doesn't rely on physical force, who understands the value of communication.

 

He smiles down at Shinsou’s spot, just outside the line, and extends a hand. “You did a really good job, Shinsou-kun! Your quirk is super cool and your rhetoric was pretty impressive."

 

Shinsou scowls but takes Izuku’s offered hand. “Yeah, well, it's pointless if it doesn’t work.”

 

“Ah, it’s just...” Izuku frowns, unsatisfied with the first thought to pop into his head. He’s used to worse? What does that mean?

 

Izuku shakes off his frown and fixes on a smile. “I think I may be more experienced, no offense or anything!”

 

Shinsou watches him with a raised eyebrow.

 

Izuku looks back to see Midnight shooing them off, so he motions for Shinsou to follow and starts walking away from the arena.

 

“If you want advice, I’d be more than happy to give you some,” Izuku tells him.

 

“No thanks,” Shinsou answers without another thought.

 

Izuku stutters, caught off guard. “Oh, alright. Well, the offer’s still open if you ever change your mind.”

 

Shinsou stops before they get to the entrance, so Izuku stops at his side, curious.

 

Shinsou looks off to the distance, eyebrows furrowed in confusion, and asks, “Who are you?"

 

“Huh?”

 

“Who are you? Why—where—” he sighs.

 

“I’m... Midoriya Izuku?”

 

Shinsou just sighs even longer.

 

Izuku ponders the question for an extra second. He looks into Shinsou's eyes. “I’m a hero.”
Notes:

    I just wanted to stress that Izuku's inner monologue in the fourth scene, in which he states that his father is not abusive, does not reflect their actual relationship. AFO is definitely 100% abusive. Izuku, however, does not know this, mostly because AFO has conditioned Izuku to believe their relationship is completely normal.

    I'm, uh, unfortunately, back to living with my parents (thanks corona) which hasn't been great for me, and is part of the reason this chapter is so late. I'm not sure how healthy it'll be for me to work on this while I'm actively living with them, so I might take a break (not that I've been updating consistently anyway lol). So, for the foreseeable future, my updates are likely to be even more sporadic :/

    I just want to thank you all again!!! Honestly y'all are so great! I'm sorry I don't respond to more of your comments but I read and appreciate all of them!! I hope y'all are doing as good as you can and staying safe and healthy during this weird time!

Chapter 19: Who are you?
Notes:

    Surprise! It’s me, Nearo! I honestly had no intention of getting this chapter out in a reasonable amount of time, but I’ve had nothing to do over the summer, and writing Shouto & Izuku interactions has been pretty therapeutic so, here ya go!

    Warnings for: Endeavor in the 2nd scene (yikes!); some minor but explicit gore in the 3rd scene; plus the expected trauma and survival skills that come with Izuku and Shouto

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

Staring down Bakugou Katsuki, Ochako doesn’t really know what to expect. He’s remained distant from pretty much the whole class, except she thinks Kirishima and his group has tried hanging out with him. Ochako may never understand why they’re all so motivated to break through Bakugou’s impenetrable walls.

 

Despite his removed, quiet air, Ochako has seen hints of spark peaking through. She noticed it first at USJ and again just earlier today during the obstacle course and cavalry battle.

 

She thinks he and Midori knew each other before UA, though the extent of their relationship remains a mystery.

 

Bakugou begins cracking his knuckles, one after the other. “I’m going to win this,” he states very matter-of-factly, with a bite of threat underneath.

 

Ochako smirks to hide her nerves and stretches one of her arms. “You can try.”

 

“No, I’m going to win,” he continues in that same tone. “The only person I’ll lose to is Izuku.”

 

Ochako doesn’t have time to digest that declaration, because then the match starts.

 

 

It’s a good fight--close, even--but Ochako still loses. She swallows back tears, wants to wait until she has some modicum of privacy before she falls apart. She attempts a smile, tells herself it was a good fight, she’s happy she made it this far, that she’s proud of herself.

 

She ignores the tightening of her chest and extends a hand to Bakugou. “Good fight! Thanks!” Ochako exclaims, hoping her play at cheerfulness masks the wavering in her voice.

 

Some small, quiet part in the back of her mind wonders if this is what Midori is doing constantly.

 

Instead of shaking her hand, Bakugou spits out, “Why are you friends with him?”

 

“What? Who?” Ochako asks.

 

Bakugou snarls. He spits, “Midoriya Izuku,” as if it were poison on his tongue.

 

“What?” Ochako asks, flabbergasted. Her arm drops and her back straightens. She wonders what she’s stepped upon, what rivalry or misunderstanding or childhood drama must have spurned this hatred. “He’s the most selfless, kindest, strongest, hard-working person I know. There’s no one I’d rather have as a friend.” She realizes, as she speaks, that she means every word.

 

“That’s what he wants you to think. He’s a fucking liar. He’s playing you.”

 

“I know,” Ochako replies decisively. “I don’t care.”

 

Bakugou flinches backwards as if she’d physically slapped him. “You don’t care? He’s a lying, manipulative, selfish, evil--”

 

“No. You can talk about his actions, but you cannot speak of his character, Bakugou. Midori may manipulate, but that doesn’t make him manipulative. He may lie, but he is not evil. He is one of, if not the best guy I know. Whatever... bias you have against him, check it.”

 

Bakugou snorts and scowls. “Just wait. You’ll see what he’s really like sooner or later.”

 

Ochako turns her back and stalks away, feeling more loyal to Midori than she did five minutes ago.

 

- - -

 

Sitting in the waiting room, Izuku half-watches the match on the TV. With the other half of his attention, he runs through what he knows about Todoroki in preparation for their match. He knows more now than he did yesterday. Todoroki has experience fighting, a consequence of Endeavor’s training, and impeccable control of his quirk--or, half of it, at least.

 

Todoroki’s refusal to use half of his quirk is understandable, but concerning. If their class is attacked by villains again (an event which would not surprise Izuku) it would be much safer to have everyone at their highest potential. Also, considering that Todoroki’s only at half capacity (no, less than that, if you take into account how the two halves may interact) and still one of the most powerful students in the class... Izuku can only imagine how powerful he’d be at full capacity.

 

But, none of that matters right now. All that matters is that Izuku beats Todoroki, and whoever comes afterwards, and wins the Sports Festival.

 

Todoroki will likely have little patience for conversation--Izuku learned as much from the Battle Trials--which means this will have to be the second type of battle, unfortunately.

 

The intercom in the room buzzes. “Contestant, please begin making your way to the stage! ” the automated, pre-recorded voice of Nedzu announces.

 

Izuku stands up, stretches down to reach his toes for a couple seconds, and then struts out the door.

 

Todoroki may have years of training and half a powerful quirk, but Izuku has years of training and four quirks.

 

Izuku hears the footsteps before he sees the person. They’re heavy, intentional, measured.

 

There’s a certain flip that switches the moment Izuku finds himself in the company of an adult or authority figure. Panic hits first. Irrational paranoia washes over him. He nearly drowns in it. What did I do wrong? What do you want with me?

 

Endeavor is no different. If anything, as the Number 2 Hero and accompanied by a familiar black aura, the appearance of Endeavor around the corner has Izuku freezing in his tracks, fixing a smile over his terror, and bowing faster than usual.

 

Izuku doesn’t dare raise his head until Endeavor huffs and says, “You’re the kid who got first in the entrance exams.”

 

“Yessir!” Izuku replies.

 

Endeavor lets out a vaguely amused huff of air, before the half-second of good mood disappears under the pervasive black aura.

 

Immediately, Izuku runs through how he stood up from the bow--was he too fast? Was his smile too wide? Did it not reach his eyes? Was his yessir too enthusiastic? Not enthusiastic enough?

 

What did he do to worsen Endeavor’s mood?

 

Endeavor scowls, a look of disgust. “Your performance so far has been a joke.”

 

Izuku stops breathing.

 

“You think you deserve to stand on the same stage as Shouto? Shouto will surpass All Might. He will achieve the unachievable. He will make me proud.”

 

Something claws at the back of his mind, digs into his brain. It’s something familiar--a memory, he thinks. It scares him. He turns away from it, locks it back behind walls. Whatever it is, Izuku knows he doesn’t want to think about it.

 

All the energy Izuku had been using for panic and anxiety and watching his every move... he takes that energy and bottles it up and uses it instead for resolve.

 

“No,” Izuku declares, a single syllable that he wouldn’t have been able to say to an adult a month ago. He looks past Endeavor’s eyes, too afraid of what he’ll see there. “Shouto isn’t you. He isn’t your weapon. He’s a human being--a child.” Izuku stands on two solid feet. A different switch flips within him. He meets Endeavor’s eyes (anger, irritation--but beneath that, confusion, insecurity, fear). “No,” Izuku repeats, as if that one word can carry everything he can’t say. Combined with his sharp eyes and curled lips, he thinks it might be able to.

 

Izuku turns around and walks calmly down the hallway to the arena, head held high, heart beating too quickly in his chest.

 

The decision is a conscious one, and he wears it as Atlas wears the world.

 

And yet, it was not a hard choice to make, not really. When it comes down to it, Todoroki’s risk is infinitely higher than his own.

 

If Todoroki doesn’t get first place, he’ll be hurt--physically. Izuku doesn’t know how far Endeavor would go, but he wouldn’t put it past the man to approach permanent damage.

 

If Izuku doesn’t get first place, all that’ll happen is an uncomfortable Conversation. He’ll probably be grounded for another couple days, at the least, but that isn’t a big deal. Father may take one of his quirks, or all of them, but Izuku’s been expecting that to happen for months. Honestly, he’s surprised he’s had them this long.

 

Worst case scenario, Father will try to pull Izuku out of UA. Izuku may be able to talk him out of that, like he did last time, but he’s already had one strike--one more than he usually gets--so he doesn’t have high hopes. If it comes down to it, Izuku can try to take legal action to stay, but the chances of that going well are very slim. Father has money and connections. Izuku does not.

 

Even if Izuku’s grounded, quirkless, and pulled out of UA, he’ll come out unscathed. He can’t say the same for Todoroki, which is why the decision is an easy one.

 

And, if he can maybe help Todoroki reach his full potential... that not only betters Todoroki, but the whole class, doesn't it?

 

Stepping out into the arena, being greeted by a cacophony of cheers, Izuku feels an odd mix of light and heavy.

 

- - -

 

The moment the match starts, Shouto encases the field in ice.

 

Midoriya meets it with a punch--Shouto had almost forgotten one of his quirks was strength enhancement--and the wave of freeze cuts neatly down the center. Undeterred, Shouto aims another, smaller one, directly at Midoriya, but something tugs at his ankles and he tilts, pulled forward just enough that he misses Midoriya, freezing the ground uselessly.

 

“Why do you want to be a hero, Todoroki-kun?”

 

Shouto grits his teeth. He knows Midoriya’s plays. Shouto won’t let him pull something like what he did at the Battle Trials.

 

This is a fight—of quirks and fists and blood and sweat and life and death. Words have no power, here. Midoriya can say whatever he wants, but none of it matters if Shouto wins.

 

Shouto lets out another wave of ice, this one wide and flat and hitting the walls of the arena with a shattering crack. Before he can figure out whether it caught Midoriya or not, his feet are pulled out from under him and he lands flat on his back, the impact knocking the air from his lungs.

 

“Who are you, Todoroki Shouto?”

 

Staring up at the bright blue sky, the answer comes to Shouto without his permission.

 

Endeavor’s voice echoes, my son--my prodigy--All Might’s unbecoming.

 

He freezes the ground without getting up, without checking where Midoriya is.

 

He can feel the chill. Feel the bone-deep itch that threatens to wreck him.

 

He stands up on shivering legs and freezes his own feet to the ground, ensuring he won’t be pulled again.

 

Shouto isn’t sure exactly what Midoriya’s telekinesis is, but he refuses to let it win.

 

Midoriya is standing roughly a third of the stage away from him, his breath visible. Green sparks lick across his body, where the freeze had just settled.

 

Shouto recognizes the sparks from USJ—Midoriya’s healing quirk, then.

 

This’ll either be a battle of stamina, brute force, or Shouto will have to knock him out cold.

 

“Who are you?” Midoriya asks, still panting.

 

Shouto doesn’t mean to answer, but he’s irritated, and there’s a sharpness to Midoriya’s gaze, and at this rate he’s going to freeze himself to unconsciousness.

 

He shoots off a ray of ice, this one smaller, a little off-center, a little too far to the left. “Endeavor’s son,” Shouto grits out.

 

Midoriya dodges it, but doesn’t have time to dodge the second one Shouto shot immediately after.

 

Midoriya yells, “No!” and a shockwave shatters everything, including the ice around Shouto’s feet, and he’s thrown backwards. He’s caught just before he reaches the edge by Midoriya’s strange telekinesis.

 

He sees Midoriya, arm extended, and it’s only then Shouto realizes the shockwave had been from a punch.

 

Blood drips onto the frozen ground. Bone sticks out from Midoriya’s elbow and shoulder. Midoriya raises his head and smiles as his arm snaps back in place with a green spark.

 

Shouto is locked in place. He wants to look away but he can’t. He watches as Midoriya’s skin literally stitches itself back together.

 

“You aren’t Endeavor’s son. You aren’t Endeavor’s,” Midoriya says calmly, like his own quirk hadn’t torn him apart then put him back together again.

 

With power like that, Midoriya could easily beat Shouto. Although, it’s obvious he’s holding back--playing a defensive game for reasons Shouto doesn’t know. The fact that Midoriya saved him from getting knocked out doesn’t make any sense. Is Midoriya trying to lose?

 

To what end? What would Midoriya gain by losing?

 

Shouto tenses. It doesn’t matter. He’ll still try his hardest to win.

 

Midoriya flexes his hand as the last of the green sparks die down. His smile turns solid and he stares Shouto down. “You’re Shouto. You're you,” he declares with such confidence and finality that Shouto can’t do anything but listen.

 

Something stirs in his stomach. He can’t tell if it’s apprehension or excitement.

 

“It’s your quirk.” Midoriya slides his left leg back in a tight sweeping arc, bends his knees, and holds up fists in front of his chest. Shouto thinks it’s the first time he’s ever seen Midoriya in a fighting stance. For a split second it looks wrong, but then he sees the bite behind Midoriya’s eyes and the threat in his teeth. “It’s your power, Shouto. ” Midoriya glows green. “Beat me, for yourself, with everything you have at your disposal. Win. ”

 

Something clicks.

 

Some feral instinct roars to life from the pit of Shouto’s stomach and consumes him.

 

That’s right, he remembers why he originally wanted to be a hero, years and years ago, before... before his mother left. He wanted to help people, to save those the heroes inevitably missed, and the ones the heroes hurt. He wanted to make sure no one would ever hurt his sister or his mother or him or anyone like them ever again.

 

At some point, he’d forgotten. At some point Endeavor had gotten so far into Shouto’s head he’d corrupted that, too.

 

But Midoriya’s right.

 

Fuck Endeavor.

 

Shouto will be a hero not to spite him, but in spite of him.

 

Shouto dons a smile not unlike Midoriya’s, easily slides into a fighting stance, and announces, “Bring it on.”

 

Then, there’s fire.

 

- - -

 

As soon as the medal ceremony concludes, Shouto walks directly to the infirmary. The medal burns accusatory in his pocket. He doesn't know if Midoriya is still there, but there's a chance he still is. And it's a good excuse to put off going home for a little longer.

 

He opens the door and--“Shouto!” Midoriya greets with an easy cheer and energy Shouto was not mentally prepared for, though should've expected.

 

Shouto scans the infirmary, checking that they’re alone, then he closes the door behind him and stands awkwardly in the entrance, unsure of where to go from here. He came here with a vague mission--demand answers, ensure Midoriya’s safety--but now that he’s face-to-face with the real live Midoriya, words fail him.

 

Midoriya waves a hand, gesturing to the entire room. “Sit wherever you’d like. Or stand. I don’t care.”

 

He opts to sit on the edge of the empty bed next to Midoriya's, a couple feet away.

 

Just as he works up the courage to ask why did you let me win?, Midoriya says, “You got silver! Congrats!”

 

It hits him harder than a punch to his gut.

 

Silver.

 

They both know second place means nothing, that he may as well have gotten last.

 

Midoriya sits up a little and looks at the ceiling, then he brings his gaze down and bores those bright green eyes into Shouto. “Can I do anything to help you?” he asks.

 

Reflexively, Shouto bites out, “No,” without thinking about it.

 

Midoriya smiles softly. “If there’s anything I can ever do for you, just let me know. I’ll be there.”

 

Shouto doesn’t know what to do with that, so instead of responding like a normal person, he blurts out, “Why did you let me win?”

 

Midoriya frowns a little. “I didn’t. You won fair and square, with your own power, Shouto.”

 

Shouto grinds his teeth together and stares down Midoriya. “You should have won that. I should have been outside the arena at the first shock wave. Why did you let me win? ”

 

Midoriya sits up a little straighter, pulls his legs under him and turns so his body is fully facing Shouto. “You couldn’t lose.” He states it simply, as if it were an obvious fact. “I knew what would happen if you got anything less than first and I refused to participate in that.”

 

Shouto’s head drops. He can hear his heartbeat in his ears.

 

He wants to disappear.

 

Midoriya let him win to--to protect him and Shouto still lost, still didn’t get first place.

 

And--fuck--if Midoriya’s household is anything even remotely like Shouto’s... what’ll happen to him since he gave up first place? Midoriya didn’t even medal.

 

He feels like he betrayed Midoriya more than himself, by failing and getting second. Midoriya gave him a chance, and he wasted it.

 

He drops his forehead to his knees and wishes his quirk were making himself as small as possible.

 

He should have done everything he could’ve to beat Bakugou. But he hesitated--he’s still afraid of his fire.

 

Maybe if he had won, Midoriya’s sacrifice wouldn’t have been in vain.

 

“Shouto,” Midoriya starts.

 

Shouto tenses in apprehension.

 

“You did great. You can’t just undo years... in one day. The fact that you brought out your fire, of your own conscious will, at all is a big step.”

 

Shouto knows he’s right, of course, but it doesn’t ease the guilt that’s corroding him from the inside out. He takes a deep breath then sits up.

 

In his carefully neutral voice, Shouto asks, “What’s going to happen to you?”, fully aware that he’s parroting the same question Midoriya asked him a few hours ago.

 

Midoriya scrunches up his eyebrows. “What do you mean?”

 

“What’s going to happen to you, since you didn’t get first place?”

 

Too many emotions cross Midoriya’s face at once. The ones Shouto can identify--surprise, confusion, fear --are quickly locked underneath a smile.

 

“Nothing,” he answers with a calm shake of his head. “I mean, my dad might give me a talking-to, but that’s it.”

 

It’s very obviously not it, from the fear Shouto witnessed, but Shouto knows not to push. If Midoriya isn’t going to talk about it, he isn’t going to try and force it--that will only end badly.

 

But, they don’t have to talk about it. Words have never, and will never, be Shouto’s strong suit. And sitting across from Midoriya, he feels extremely outmatched in the charisma department. He was taught to attack first, ask questions later, or never.

 

However, he needs to say something. He finally meets Midoriya’s eyes and says, with a decided conviction, “If you ever need anything--anything--you can reach out to me, as well.”

 

Midoriya watches him, and Shouto gets the pointed impression he’s trying to decide whether Shouto means it, whether he’s telling the truth or not. So, he specifies, “I mean it. I’ll help with what I can, as long as I’m free.” He pulls out his phone after a moment of hesitation. “Should we exchange numbers?” he asks, although he means is it safe to?

 

Midoriya looks at him for an extra second before grinning. “Thanks, Shouto! I appreciate it. And sure.” Midoriya pulls out his phone, and they exchange numbers.

 

Shouto stands up to go but Midoriya lets out a quiet, oh. Shouto pauses.

 

Midoriya chews on the inside of his cheek for a couple seconds, probably literally chewing over his words. “You’re going home.”

 

It’s something in between a statement and a question. Shouto doesn’t answer it.

 

Midoriya continues, “Can I help you, now?”

 

Shouto wants to ask Midoriya the same thing, but he doesn’t. He looks at the door. Past it is the stadium, then Musutafa, then home, and, inevitably, Endeavor. “No,” Shouto answers without any weight. “I medalled, and I did use my fireside, both of which he’ll like.” Talking about this so openly, to someone not-Fuyumi, is still so foreign to Shouto. He has to force the words out. He can create them in his mind, but making them come out of his mouth is a challenge. “No, I have to face him. There’s something I want to tell him.”

 

Midoriya’s smile is a frown.

 

After a few seconds of silence, Shouto moves towards the door.

 

“Stay safe, Shouto,” Midoriya calls out, the words weighing heavily in the space between them.

 

Without turning around, Shouto replies, “You too, Mi--Izuku.” He means it more than Izuku will know, most likely.

Chapter Text

Katsuki slams Todoroki against the wall, his hand a threat on the other’s shoulder.

 

Half-and-Half just watches him with blank eyes, unamused and unperturbed.

 

“Why’d Izuku let you win?” Katsuki hisses. “What deal did you make, huh?

 

Todoroki’s eyes narrow. “Ask Midoriya.”

 

Katsuki tenses, his grip tightening. He can’t ask Izuku, that’s why he’s here. “Izuku doesn’t lose, so why the fuck did you win?”

 

It doesn’t make sense. Katsuki can barely remember the medal ceremony and the past five (maybe even ten) minutes since then. None of it feels real, like the floor is gonna be pulled out from under him any moment, like Izuku’s gonna jump out with that creepy-ass smile and jeer, “Gotcha! ”

 

There must be some explanation—some bigger, better game Izuku won by losing this one. But Katsuki doesn't know it. He can’t make sense of any of it so he watches himself fall apart from a few feet away through a thick veil.

 

“I’m late,” Todoroki says. Katsuki watches Todoroki knock his hand away.

 

His first-place medal sits in some trash can somewhere, half-melted.

 

Todoroki walks away. Katsuki watches himself watch him.

 

He hears, from far away, someone say, “Izuku doesn’t lose.” It almost sounds like him.

 

 

- - -

 

 

Izuku opens the door and announces, “I’m home!”

 

His father replies, “Welcome home,” from the living room, voice deceptively sweet. He turns off the volume on the TV.

 

After taking off his shoes, Izuku finds Father watching replays of the sports festival. He sits down on the couch, unwilling to broach the subject but as prepared as possible to address it. He’s been wound up with tension since Shouto left, worried about Shouto and also himself.

 

He should have done more, should have somehow ensured Shouto got first place. Maybe then he could rest easy, could confidently sit next to his father. Maybe then he wouldn’t be worrying about what Endeavor is doing to Shouto right now.

 

“How do you feel about your placement?” Father asks, turning away from the TV and towards Izuku.

 

“I wish I had done better,” Izuku starts, every word intentional, scripted on the train-ride from the festival to home, “but I’m satisfied with my performance. Other than first place, I accomplished everything else I wanted to.”

 

“Oh?” Father asks. “What were these other goals?”

 

Izuku just needs to convince his Father these other goals are more important than getting first place. Then, maybe, he’ll be allowed to stay at UA.

 

“One was minimizing public exposure,” Izuku begins, carefully reciting his script. “As the sports festival is a public event, I knew villains would have access to it. So I wanted to minimize the information they’d get, to protect myself and my class and give us an upper-hand if we ever conflict again.”

 

Father hums for a moment, digesting the argument. “That explains your performance in the obstacle course and first one-on-one battle, but not the second one-on-one.”

 

“I had a different goal when battling Todoroki Shouto.”

 

“And these goals were exclusive?”

 

Izuku flinches. “I had to prioritize. Todoroki’s only been using half his quirk. I saw a chance to improve his abilities. The better each individual in our class is, the better we’ll be as a whole, especially when it comes to encountering villains.”

 

“I see...” Father begins, sounding unconvinced. “However, Todoroki-kun did not use his full quirk in his next battle, so I wouldn’t call yourself successful.”

 

Izuku doesn’t back down, sitting up a little straighter. “It’s a process. I argue we made significant progress.”

 

After a dreadfully long moment which fills the thick air with apprehension, Father says, “Continue. How else are you readying your class for future conflicts with villains?”

 

Izuku answers easily, “I led the movement to expel Mineta Minoru, an immature, unprofessional child with immoral motivations.”

 

Father nods approvingly. “And who will be taking his place?”

 

Izuku’s jaw clenches, surprised by the question even though the moment he hears it, he realizes he should have expected it. He doesn’t have the wiggle room to come up with an excuse—every word counts, for or against his chances at staying at UA. So, Izuku answers with the first, and only name, that he can think of, “Shinsou Hitoshi.”

 

“Oh? An interesting choice. Why him?”

 

Despite being unprepared for this conversation, there are reasons he finds reasons quickly. Izuku analyzes quirks (and people) naturally... habitually. Despite having only officially met Shinsou a couple hours ago, Izuku is already relatively familiar with his quirk, fighting style, and personality. Out of all the non-hero, first-year students who participated in the festival, Shinsou is, really, the only option. While Izuku momentarily considers some of his friends from the entrance exam, none of them were as successful in the festival as Shinsou was.

 

Izuku confidently says, “He has a unique, versatile quirk. His drive is commendable. And his fighting style is incredibly interesting; his strength is in conversation rather than brute force."

 

Father leans forwards, clasps his hands together. “I like him already,” Father says, a proclamation that strikes more fear in Izuku than you're grounded.

 

Izuku has made a grave mistake. Father’s never been interested in any of his peers other than to prove they're bad influences or not worth Izuku’s time. Izuku has no idea what Father will do with someone he actually likes. It terrifies him. And knowing he brought Shinsou to Father's attention...

 

“Write me a formal report on why Shinsou-kun deserves that spot, please. As soon as possible.”

 

“Of course,” Izuku answers in between the heavy beats of his heart.

 

In the silence that follows, Izuku’s apprehension spikes. Father’s yet to impose his judgement—yet to suggest a punishment for his placement. Izuku knows Shinsou's recommendation doesn't count. A paper of that magnitude is child's play to him.

 

“What should we have for dinner?” Father asks with a casual smile, turning the sound on the TV back on.

 

And like that, the Conversation is over.

 

 

- - -

 

 

Shouto sneaks into his house through a back window. He’s stuffed his shoes into his backpack; walking without shoes is always quieter. He uses this entrance more often than the front door.

 

He knows, by the warmth of the windowsill under his palm, and the dreadfully familiar sound of anger breaking things, that Endeavor’s home.

 

There are times when Shouto can completely avoid Endeavor, when Endeavor’s ire will tire itself out, or he’ll be called in to work before he can find Shouto. But then there are times that waiting will just make it worse, that Endeavor will only get angrier the longer he sits.

 

Shouto stands at the door of their gym. His resolve wanes like smoke.

 

He could just walk away. Maybe even keep walking, walk right back out that window. Running away has always been a temptation of his, but he appreciates a roof over his head and three meals a day too much to ever go through with it. The rent Shouto pays is fear. The price for having a home is Endeavor’s fire and fists.

 

It was much easier to imagine talking to his father when he was, rather, talking with Izuku.

 

And that’s it, isn’t it. Shouto can’t just forget what Izuku sacrificed to protect him. He can’t just ignore that and could never walk away from it. Izuku gave him a second chance. Shouto may not have gotten first place, but he can still make use of it.

 

His phone buzzes silently in his pocket, yet is still too loud. He holds his breath and luckily hears no change from within the gym. He pulls out his phone, reads a text message from Izuku: Did you get home safe? He deletes the text and buries his phone in his backpack, knowing he can’t give an honest answer until he’s faced Endeavor.

 

Shouto opens the door, leaving his backpack outside the room.

 

The gym, fire-proofed with only the most expensive materials, has become a sauna. Endeavor stands in the middle, wrecking a punching bag. Stuffing falls to the floor with each punch. Endeavor doesn’t pause between punches to say, “Shouto.”

 

Shouto closes the door behind him and says, “Endeavor,” in the same flat tone.

 

Shouto barely dodges the jet of fire aimed for his head, skidding to a fighting stance a few feet away.

 

Endeavor watches him with hard eyes, as if trying to decide whether that was an acceptable response or not. “You didn’t use your fire in the finale,” he accuses.

 

Shouto thinks because it’s mine, but says nothing.

 

“You won’t win against All Might like this.”

 

“You’re right,” Shouto states, continuing to hold his defensive position.

 

Endeavor scowls and begins stalking up to Shouto.

 

Shouto doesn’t move, just stares down Endeavor. “I’ll become the number one hero,” he declares. Endeavor stops in his tracks. “But not for you. Not to beat All Might. I’ll become the number one hero with my quirk.”

 

Endeavor breaks into the closest thing to a smile his face can make, a wide showing of teeth that looks almost like a grimace. He continues to approach Shouto, each step echoing through the room, kicking up a cloud of smoke and threatening to melt the floor. Shouto’s apprehension rises the closer his father gets. It threatens to boil him from the inside but fear is weakness, so he shows none of it.

 

Endeavor stops directly in front of Shouto, smile enduring.

 

Cornered, Shouto can’t help but feel like prey.

 

Endeavor raises his hand. Shouto flinches.

 

Endeavor drops the hand on Shouto’s shoulder. “Good,” he says. Flames flicker from his face, his shoulders, his back.

 

Shouto tries not to suffocate.

 

Endeavor continues, “So show me your fire.”

 

Shouto has just enough time for his heart to drop before Endeavor picks him up, throws him over Endeavor's back, and tosses him onto the ground.

 

 

Endeavor gives up trying to beat out Shouto’s flames after over an hour, leaving Shouto half-unconscious in the gym. He takes inventory of his state and determines it went relatively well. Other than exhaustion, a few bruises, mild hypothermia and some charred skin (always an interesting combination), he’s fine.

 

He’s fine.

 

After chugging water and taking a few moments to just breathe, Shouto stumbles out of the gym and picks up his backpack. He goes to his room, shoving his chair under the door handle to offer nothing but an extra second or two of warning if needed, and collapses onto his bed.

 

He texts Izuku, yes, and tries to fall asleep.

 

- - -

 

Nedzu gets an email long after he’s clocked out. Not that Nedzu ever stops working, of course. But checking his email is usually a low priority when it’s almost midnight. However, the notification tune is in B-major; his inbox program flagged the message as important.

 

So, Nedzu pauses evaluating and proof-reading the preliminary media coverage of the sports festival to check his email.

 

The message has been automatically forwarded to him via UA’s admin mailing list, with the subject line Recommendation to Transfer Shinsou Hitoshi to Class 1-A. Nedzu is not at all surprised to discover Midoriya Izuku is the sender. The only other person he could imagine recommending Shinsou is Aizawa, who would communicate such a decision over a cup of coffee, not via a pdf in an email.

 

Nedzu’s body clock is terrifyingly accurate, likely a consequence of how his brain runs constantly. So, he notes curiously that he received Midoriya’s email exactly seven hours, fourty-six minutes, and eighteen seconds after the students were dismissed from the sports festival.

 

Of course, this number only holds significance if Nedzu assumes Midoriya decided to recommend Shinsou Hitoshi during, or after, the festival. It would not surprise Nedzu if Midoriya picked Shinsou days, or even weeks ago. Midoriya, after all, played a large part in the expulsion of Mineta Minoru. It is more likely these two events are related than independent.

 

However, if—on the other hand—Midoriya picked Shinsou only during or after the festival, then that would mean he wrote and compiled this recommendation in less than eight hours.

 

Nedzu isn’t sure which would impress him more.

 

Midoriya's attached document is nine pages long, written in his already-familiar format and rhetoric. He outlines a straight-forward (yet incredibly keen) analysis of Shinsou, an argument of how Shinsou’s presence could enhance 1-A (on the individual and communal levels), and the argument that 1-A will simultaneously better Shinsou.

 

It also includes an offer from Midoriya to personally train Shinsou on "applied charisma". Knowing what Nedzu knows about the two—very little and yet more than enough—Nedzu finds the offer tantalizing. He can think of very few active individuals in Japan with a style even remotely similar to the two. A villain is the first to come to mind, but he quickly finds a few underground heroes and vigilantes within his mental archives. Unfortunately, mental attributes have been long overshadowed by the flashy, physical quirks. Maybe he should offer a workshop—

 

Nedzu is getting ahead of himself, though. A rather common occurrence for one of his capabilities. Shinsou Hitoshi is, after all, still a general education student.

 

Shinsou is the only real candidate for transfer. Mei Hatsume, the only other non-hero student who made it to the one-on-one battles, has no intention of becoming a hero. While a couple other general education students made it to the cavalry battles, none of them showed the same skill and drive Shinsou had.

 

Nonetheless, Nedzu sincerely appreciates Midoriya’s formal recommendation. He appreciates it less for the content and more for its significance. (Not that it is poor content—on the contrary, Midoriya’s analysis of Shinsou and 1-A is insightful and constructive.) After all, it is not everyday that Midoriya Izuku asks for something.

 

While transferring a student usually requires at least six work days (a formal proposal, a vote by the teachers, and paperwork for both UA and Shinsou), with the approaching internships and Midoriya’s personal recommendation, Nedzu is incredibly motivated to speed the process along.
Notes:

    It’s been two years since I started posting this fic! Thank you all for your unwavering support!!! I hope y'all are doing well <3

    I am now officially an English major (rather than a minor)!! I’m actively applying for the Creative Writing specialization/concentration for the major! Super excited.

    Next chapter should hopefully be out in a reasonable amount of time, as I’ve already written a decent chunk of it, but no promises :p

Chapter 21: The dark side of the silver spoon
Notes:

    Warnings: mentions of life as an orphan/foster kid (passing references to bad foster parents, bad group homes, and life on the street), canon-typical violence -- both for the second scene

    Disclaimer: I am not current on the manga, so much of my characterization of Shinsou Hitoshi is based on my own HC’s and other fanfictions I've read. I also have no personal experience with foster care, so I apologize if I misrepresent it.

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

Izuku gets the news alert when he’s on his way to school: Ingenium (Iida Tensei) injured in fight with The Hero Killer, Stain. The more he reads the worst he feels. Izuku’s heart clenches in sympathy for the Iida’s and anger at Stain.

 

Izuku drafts a text message to Iida, first in their group chat then privately. Everything he writes feels insufficient, though, so when the train arrives at his stop he’s just staring at a blank screen.

 

As he walks to his classroom, Izuku tests words on his tongue. He doesn’t know what to say to Iida, which makes him uncomfortable. By the time Izuku stops in front of the classroom, he still isn’t sure.

 

Iida’s tie-dyed, dense aura is visible through the wall. A mottled ball of anxiety, fear, and anger. 

 

Izuku enters the classroom. Shouto acknowledges him with a nod and a relaxing of his aura--his pale yellow discomfort dulls. Izuku’s rote good morning dies before it reaches his lips. After all, it isn’t a very good morning, is it?

 

“Iida-kun,” Izuku finally settles on. “How are you doing?”

 

Iida clenches his jaw, doesn’t look away from the spot on his desk he’s been watching for who-knows-how long. “I’m fine,” he lies.

 

Izuku frowns, but doesn’t push. He fills the silence with discussion of the sports festival and up-coming internships. Well, it’s less a discussion and more a speech, seeing as Iida is preoccupied with the imaginary spot on his desk and Shouto participates only with the occasional head nod, shake, or confused twitch of his eyebrow.

 

As students trickle in, Izuku guides all conversation away from Ingenium and Stain in an attempt to soothe Iida’s tie-dyed emotions. Uraraka arrives with tightly pursed lips, holding back tears. She hesitates between approaching Iida and running away, settling on silently mouthing I’m sorry and retreating to her desk. Kaminari nearly makes an ill-timed comment about vigilantes, which Izuku quickly turns into a safer discussion about underground heroes.

 

The moment the bell rings Aizawa steps through the door, his presence instantly silencing the room. He watches the class for a moment, likely gauging if there’s anything he needs to chastise them about, before stalking up to his desk. “A new student is joining our class,” Aizawa announces.

 

An excited chitter fills the room, quiet questions and guesses that are all wrong.

 

Ashido speaks up, “Uh, Sensei, what happened to Mineta?”

 

“Who?” Aizawa deadpans, looking everywhere but the empty seat behind Izuku.

 

Yaoyorozu raises a hand and announces, “Mineta-kun was expelled for inappropriate behavior.” Which surprises absolutely no one.

 

“Moving on,” Aizawa drones with a surprisingly authoritative wave of his hand. “Shinsou?”

 

The door opens and Shinsou Hitoshi steps into the classroom, donning the hero course armband and Shinsou’s own unique brand of eye bags.

 

Izuku smiles and waves; Shinsou perfectly ignores him.

 

“My name is Shinsou Hitoshi,” he drones. His hands are deep in his pockets, slouched in a defensive way that makes him just a tad smaller. “I’m not here to make friends.”

 

 

Yesterday

 

Standing awkwardly in the middle of Principal Nedzu’s office, Hitoshi is a kind of uncomfortable he isn’t used to. His greatest idol, Eraserhead, nurses a cup of coffee on one of the couches. Another one of his idols, arguably the most successful individual without a physical quirk, watches him with terrifyingly sharp eyes from behind his too-big desk.

 

“Welcome, Shinsou-kun, please take a seat," Nedzu says. "Would you like some tea?”

 

Hitoshi eyes Eraserhead’s cup of coffee with jealousy. When he sees no other source of the drink in the room, Nedzu pipes up, “Ah, unfortunately we have a policy of not supplying addictive drugs to our student body, so all we have is tea.”

 

Eraserhead rolls his eyes and clutches his mug a little closer.

 

Hitoshi sighs and sits on the couch across from Eraserhead. “I’m good, then.”

 

“Alrighty!” Nedzu continues with that impeccable cheer. It almost, dare Hitoshi think it, reminds him of Midoriya, though turned up another ten levels. “We’re here to discuss your transfer into 1-A.”

 

He got the letter informing him of the opportunity last night. It was sent to his favorite cafe rather than his foster home--which, in a way, makes sense, considering he spends more time there than “home”. But what’s most disturbing is that Nedzu knew that.

 

In his corner of the cafe, the letter had projected a hologram of Nedzu which nearly gave Hitoshi a heart attack. And, the cherry on top of every-fucking-thing else, the recording of Nedzu was able to predict all of Hitoshi’s responses--external or not.

 

Eraserhead looks at Hitoshi with half-lidded eyes that don't disguise his alertness. “Will one of your guardians be joining us?”

 

Hitoshi’s current foster parents, who he maybe sees once a week, haven’t even watched the sports festival. As far as Hitoshi is aware, they don’t know--not that they would even care--that he made it to the one-on-one battles. Their interest with Hitoshi starts and ends with their monthly stipend. They aren’t terrible people--in fact they’re surprisingly decent. However, like every other family he’s bounced around, they’re sure to get rid of him in a few weeks when they realize he’s more trouble than he’s worth.

 

However, Hitoshi simply says, “Nah,” with an easy indifference he mastered years ago.

 

“So many problem children,” Aizawa mutters under his breath.

 

“That won’t be an issue!” Nedzu says without pause. “If you decide to transfer, you can take the forms home with you to get signed. Once they’re returned, your transfer will be official.”

 

“I’ve decided,” Hitoshi says immediately.

 

Nedzu laughs. “We must first go over the technicalities and ensure 1-A is the best fit for you.”

 

Hitoshi scowls, digging his fingernails into the couch.

 

“Now, now, Shinsou-kun,” Nedzu starts. “We are not questioning your capabilities, nor the fact that you deserve to be in the hero course. Both of these were determined before we offered you the spot. Rather, we want to ensure you are fully aware of what being a student of class 1-A will entail. Aizawa?”

 

Aizawa grunts an affirmative. “The students of 1-A have a jump-start. They’ve been training for a month, at least. And they all survived a real villain attack.” Aizawa leans forward and meets Hitoshi’s eyes. “Can you keep up?”

 

Hitoshi leans forward as well, elbows on either knee, hands clasped inbetween. He smiles with teeth--an expression that occasionally scares off small dogs. “Yes. Can they keep up with me?”

 

Aizawa smiles. Nedzu laughs, claps his paws, and exclaims, “Just what we wanted to hear!”

 

Hitoshi leans back. Nedzu takes a sip of his tea. “On the topic of 1-A’s experience with villains, there is a reasonable chance, sixty-one-point-ninety-four percent, approximately, that 1-A encounters these villains again. While we will try our best as educators and heroes to prevent this, it is a possibility to keep in mind. Are you prepared to face a villain tomorrow, with the intent of protecting yourself and, if you can, your peers?”

 

Hitoshi doesn’t mention the numerous back-alley fights he’s had over scraps of food, nor how many of his group homes were battlegrounds, nor how many creepy evil asshole adults he’s fought off. He can recall each fight for his life, or for someone else’s life, with disturbing clarity. While none of his opponents may have been professional villains, he’s already prepared everyday to fight for his life.

 

He answers, “Yes,” with a heavy seriousness.

 

Aizawa sighs, collapsing into the couch. Nedzu’s smile widens threateningly. “I would like you to answer the question again, after watching this video.” As Nedzu clicks around on his computer, he continues, “I’m sure you’ve seen hero-villain fights on TV, but those are only the curated scenes which pass media inspection. Most of these are scripted fights, flashy and simple, in which the heroes always win. Unfortunately, real life is rarely so perfect, and a majority of fights are nothing like that.”

 

Aizawa closes his eyes and starts, at least in appearance, napping.

 

The monitor taking up the wall behind Nedzu flashes to life and a grainy video takes up the screen. “So,” Nedzu continues, “I’d like you to watch a real fight--one of those pesky little videos that didn’t make the cut. This particular one is of Eraserhead’s second fight post-graduation.”

 

At that, Aizawa’s eyes snap open, and pure annoyance takes over his face before he shuts it down, replacing it with his signature deadpan. He mutters a near-silent, “Motherfucker,” that Hitoshi can hear perfectly.

 

Nedzu just laughs. “This is a new prerequisite for transferring into the hero course. However, considering class 1-A’s unique circumstances, administration added this requirement. If you don’t feel comfortable watching this video--after all, there is a reason it didn’t make it to any news station--you may decline. And-or file a complaint. However, you won’t have enough information to consent to joining the hero course, and we’ll likely have to reconsider your admission.”

 

Hitoshi tenses into a scowl. That isn’t a choice. Hell, if the prerequisite were pulling off a fingernail or two, he’s still pretty certain he’d do it. Probably. Maybe. “I’ll do it.”

 

Nedzu smiles and claps his paws together. “Wonderful! Then, without further ado--”

 

A sharp, high-pitched scream pierces Hitoshi’s eardrums. On the grainy security-cam footage, a man paces around a shop--some dollar store or gas station. The merchandise closest to him melts.

 

“He called himself Run Hots,” Nedzu starts, a disturbingly cheery commentary for the subject, “Killed fourteen people before apprehension.”

 

The familiar form of Eraserhead crashes into the scene, rolling to his feet, a pained grimace barely visible in the low-quality footage.

 

“His quirk was rather simple--not to understate its complicated power and applications,” Nedzu continues without pause. “The man’s body temperature was more than 100 degrees hotter than the average human--that’s Celsius of course--putting his resting temperature at around 150 degrees Celsius.”

 

On screen, Eraserhead’s scarves wrap around the villain. The fabric melts almost instantaneously.

 

“It’s a mutation quirk,” Nedzu says much-too-easily. “Which means Eraserhead’s quirk was useless.”

 

Run Hots grabs Eraserhead’s neck. Eraserhead twists out of the grip. Even in this low-quality footage Hitoshi can make out the discoloration on his neck. The sight, combined with the persistent screams and Nedzu’s uncomfortably pointed commentary, make Hitoshi’s gut drop.

 

Eraserhead pulls out a knife.

 

“Really, Eraserhead was very unsuited to deal with this particular villain, which he was fully aware of.”

 

Eraserhead strikes out, a wide slash far away from his body which manages to nick Run Hots forearm. Eraserhead jumps back. Run Hots’ laugh, sharp and haughty, makes every one of Hitoshi’s muscles tense.

 

“Ah, yes. A fun consequence of his quirk. Certain wounds cauterize automatically.”

 

In the echoes of Run Hots laugh there’s a heavy, hot silence. Hitoshi’s sweating from his eyebrows to his toes.

 

On-screen, Eraserhead strikes again--a perfect slash across Run Hot’s abdomen but the man doesn’t flinch. Eraserhead strikes again. And again. And each time he does he looks worse and worse for wear--sweat soaks through his costume, dripping onto the floor and landing with an audible sizzle --his skin turns redder and redder.

 

Something in Eraserhead clicks. He adjusts his stance and hold on the knife, crouching closer to the ground. In a flash, the knife is deep in Run Hot’s skull. Eraserhead retreats. Halfway to the exit he collapses to the ground.

 

The video pauses. Eraserhead--sitting right across from Hitoshi--is staring blankly at something that doesn’t exist. Nedzu rests his chin on his paws and holds a casual smile.

 

In the heavy silence Hitoshi tries to memorize this feeling. The suffocating heat of his own body. The tension threading through his muscles with nowhere to go, hesitating beneath his skin, antibodies threatening to attack themselves.

 

It’s starkly different from the fight-or-flight adrenaline he’s familiar with. No, this is a simmering apprehension. A fear of something that can’t be solved by fighting or flighting. A fear of the unwinnable, of the unknowable...

 

He sits with it, drenched head-to-toe in it, and watches his hands shake. He doesn’t want to feel this way ever again, and so he takes it, pushes it to the deep recesses of his mind with every other emotion he's deemed unnecessary. Now that he knows it, he can ignore it.

 

“Now," Nedzu starts, "that was relatively tame compared to the brutality of USJ. I’d estimate it’s about one-tenth as bad.”

 

Hitoshi snaps to awareness. A feeling--too much--explodes in his stomach. Hitoshi just barely manages to suppress it before it consumes him. He blinks away Nedzu’s words and refuses to think about the consequences.

 

“So, Shinsou-kun,” Nedzu starts, “considering everything, are you prepared to face a villain tomorrow?”

 

For whatever reason, Midoriya’s voice replays in Hitoshi’s head--the last, and arguably first, conversation they had--his assured, confident declaration.

 

Hitoshi meets Nedzu’s eyes straight-on. “I’m a hero,” he declares. “I’m ready.”

 

Nedzu gives him a thumbs up. “Perfect. Aizawa?”

 

Eraserhead turns to Hitoshi, eyes focused back to reality. “I’d like to get you caught up with some supplemental lessons outside of class. I can offer combat and hero training. We’ll find someone to cover your quirk training.”

 

Before Hitoshi can react to the idea of personal lessons from Eraserhead, or flinch at the thought of his quirk, Nedzu pats something (a folder?) on top of his desk and exclaims, “Don’t forget our wonderful volunteer, Aizawa!”

 

Eraserhead scowls. “He already has too much on his plate and you know it. I’ll find someone else.”

 

Who volunteered to help him? The fact that Eraserhead offered is already shock enough--but it makes sense considering he’ll be Hitoshi’s teacher. Who else would have volunteered? He can’t think of anyone. A little afraid of the answer (though he’d never admit it), he doesn’t ask who.

 

“Internships are coming up,” Eraserhead continues, “which will be a good opportunity for real-world experience. A number of underground heroes gave you an offer. I can help you figure out which would be the best fit.”

 

Hitoshi nods. Nedzu picks up a packet and slides it across the table until it balances, perfectly, over the edge closest to Hitoshi. “Once a guardian signs these and they’re returned, you’ll officially be a member of 1-A.

 

Hitoshi stands up, picks it up, and says, quietly, “Thanks.”

 

“Don’t thank us!” Nedzu says, which makes little sense but Hitoshi doesn’t dwell on it.

 

“We’ll talk later about scheduling supplemental training,” Eraserhead tells him.

 

Hitoshi nods and turns to leave but, before he does, curiosity gets the better of him (and hopefully won’t kill him). “Why?” he asks. “It’s been fifteen years since a gen-ed student made it into the hero course.” He looks at Eraserhead, the last transfer, pointedly. “Why me?”

 

Nedzu watches Hitoshi intently, his eyes bright and a serious, unreadable expression on his face. “Someone gave me a very compelling recommendation.”

 

“What? Who?” Theories pop into his head, each unequivocally shut down. He can’t think of a single person who’d seriously recommend him, and definitely not one who’d get Nedzu’s attention.

 

“I do so want to tell you, but I must respect the privacy of the individual.”

 

Hitoshi huffs out, then leaves without another word.

 

It still hasn’t sunk in--that he’s actually going to be in the hero course--that he’s actually going to become a hero. And he doesn’t think it will until he sits down in Class 1-A. Or maybe not even until he gets his provisional hero license, or he's holding his diploma in his hands.

 

It feels like a dream. Like one of those dreams that could turn into a nightmare at any moment.

 



Present day



Uraraka, Iida, and Izuku walk to lunch in a tense silence. When they near the dining hall, Iida suddenly stops; Uraraka nearly trips to not run into him. Iida stares at the door to the lunchroom.

 

“Iida-kun?” Izuku asks as softly as he can, afraid that the littlest thing may shatter whatever’s left of Iida.

 

In an uncharacteristically empty voice, Iida drones, “I think I’ll skip lunch, today.”

 

Uraraka grabs Izuku’s sleeve, so quickly and sloppily Izuku questions if she’s aware she did it. “Oh-okay!” she exclaims, her cheer convincing no one. “Where do you wanna go, then?”

 

“Alone,” Iida says instantly, still not looking at either of them. “Sorry, I-I need to be alone.”

 

“Uh, are you sure?” Uraraka asks quietly, but Iida’s already walking away from the lunchroom. She moves to follow him, but Izuku stops her.

 

“We should respect his wishes, don’t you think?" Izuku starts. "I’m worried about him, too, but this might be what he needs right now.”

 

Uraraka shoots him a weak smile. “Who thought your roles would be reversed?”

 

What? Izuku isn’t sure what she means, but he doesn’t ask. Fears he's supposed to already know the answer.

 

- - -

 

Midoriya is walking towards him.

 

Hitoshi’s had the corner table of the cafeteria to himself since the first day of school. With nothing to his back and the two entrances in clear view, he’s as close to comfortable as possible in a room stuffed full of teenagers.

 

He’s incredibly aware of what happens in his corner--nothing, usually. He can count the people who've approached his table on no hands--zero. The closest person to him is Todoroki, who’s sitting alone at the next table. Everyone else has given them a relatively wide berth. Except for Midoriya, who’s walking straight towards him--and it isn’t a mistake nor coincidence, as he made eye-contact three steps ago, complete with a not-awkward smile.

 

Hitoshi automatically pulls his lunch tray closer, draws his elbows and arms up around in a defensive habit he learned at one, or all, of the group homes. He quickly pockets the granola bar and applesauce he’d gotten as sides.

 

Midoriya walks up to his table with a soft smile. “Can I sit here?”

 

Although he’d much rather eat alone, to maintain his careless persona Hitoshi mutters, “Do whatever you want.”

 

Midoriya smiles and sits down, setting down a bento box and thermos--neither of which are Lunch Rush’s. He waves to the next table over--Todoroki’s--and says, “Shouto, do you wanna join us?”

 

Hitoshi watches as Todoroki does the unthinkable--he stands up without a single moment of hesitation and sits down on the opposite end of Hitoshi’s bench. Todoroki, who’s never said a single word or shown a single emotion as far as Hitoshi is concerned, sits down next to him. Todoroki doesn’t say anything and returns to eating like nothing happened at all.

 

“You both probably already know each other, but Shouto, this is Shinsou Hitoshi. Shinsou-kun, this is Todoroki Shouto.”

 

Todoroki acknowledges Hitoshi’s presence with a small nod which Hitoshi doesn’t return.

 

Hitoshi states, “I thought I made it clear already. I’m not here to make friends.”

 

“Perfect!” Midoriya exclaims with more than enough cheer for the three of them. “Neither is Shouto! I think you’ll both get along great.”

 

Hitoshi glares at Todoroki particularly hard. It’s obvious, their differences. None of them could be friends even if they were the last three people on Earth, Midoriya should be fully aware of this, but if he needs a refresher, Hitoshi will give it.

 

“Neither of you will ever understand me, let alone get along with me.” He points his chopsticks threateningly between Todoroki and Midoriya. “You both have perfect, flashy quirks. You silver-spooned privileged assholes couldn’t even imagine my life.” He jabs his chopsticks into his rice. “We’re from different worlds.”

 

Midoriya laughs a hollow sound and a chill runs down Hitoshi’s spine.

 

“I think...” Midoriya starts slowly, carefully. “That we’re all more similar than you think.”

 

“You don’t know anything about me,” Hitoshi grits out.

 

“You’re right,” Midoriya admits easily. “And you don’t know anything about us, so stop pretending that you do.”

 

Hitoshi just stabs at his food, but the cold, sharp gaze Todoroki’s been boring into Hitoshi softens ever-so-slightly.

 

Midoriya unscrews his thermos, wafting their corner with the smell of fresh miso soup. “I’m not allowed to train you outside of school, Shinsou-kun,” he starts out of nowhere. “But I was thinking we could do something in between classes, like during lunch.”

 

Hitoshi scowls. The fact that Midoriya thinks Hitoshi needs his help, hell, that Midoriya thinks he knows enough about the curse of his quirk, is so incredibly offensive Hitoshi almost laughs. “I already told you. I don’t need or want your... help .” He spits out the last word like a cuss.

 

“Your quirk has a very specific activation requirement,” Midoriya continues without pause. “Your greatest hurdle right now is making sure that you can activate it.”

 

“So?" Hitoshi bites. "What do you know about verbal manipulation?”

 

Todoroki chokes on his noodles, looking at Hitoshi with wide eyes.

 

Hitoshi just continues, “You and your flashy, heroic quirk just punch things ‘til they work out.”

 

Midoriya’s smile widens, one of his eyebrows raise as if he’s confused and amused.

 

Todoroki suddenly says, “Shinsou,” a two-syllable warning that has Hitoshi on-edge.

 

Midoriya holds up a hand and Todoroki relaxes minutely--more like a lessening of his tension--and turns back to his soba.

 

“Shall I prove to you that I can help train your communication skills?” Midoriya asks innocently.

 

Hitoshi scoffs.

 

Midoriya continues, “You try to stay silent. I’ll try and get you to talk. Easy, right?”

 

This is a pointless exercise. Midoriya knows nothing about the can of venomous snakes he’s about to open. Hitoshi’s lived with this quirk for over ten years. He’s lived with the discrimination, the fear. He’s spent entire months completely silent at the threat of a passing guardian, afraid of Hitoshi’s quirk.

 

But if it finally gets Midoriya off his back, go for it. “You win, I’ll let you train me," Hitoshi says. "I win, you leave me the fuck alone. Forever. Got it?”

 

Midoriya nods. “Got it. Then why don’t we set some ground rules? If you say anything, verbally, no matter the cause, you lose. We’ll end the game when the lunch period ends. Sound good?”

 

Hitoshi shrugs, then nods once.

 

“Shouto, do you want to give us some space?”

 

Todoroki’s eyes narrow. He doesn’t get up.

 

“Alright,” Midoriya says with a casual shrug. He turns to Hitoshi. “Then, let’s start!” He claps his hands together. “Do you have any more rules you want to set up?”

 

Hitoshi snorts. Yeah, no. He ain’t falling for that. He narrows his eyes and raises his chin in an attempt to portray, nope, fuck you, silently.

 

Midoriya raises his hands and chuckles. “Alright. Well, Shinsou-kun, how’s your day going? Are you liking the hero course so far?”

 

This is stupid. Hitoshi forces some rice down his throat, unimpressed.

 

“Do you have a crush on anyone?” Midoriya asks, drawing at straws.

 

While it might have gotten a reaction out of someone who flustered easily, or who actually got crushes, Hitoshi simply keeps eating.

 

“Maybe...” Midoriya starts with an amusing glint to his eyes. “Do you have a crush on Shouto?”

 

Todoroki visibly stills, chopstick half-way to his mouth, soba noodles dropping dramatically onto his plate. He looks to Hitoshi with an expression that’s hard to read--barely any different from his resting stoic face. Maybe he’s disgusted. Or offended. Or just curious.

 

Hitoshi, really, honestly, gives zero fucks what Todoroki thinks. Maybe, if he did care, he’d jump to clear any misunderstandings. Todoroki could think Hitoshi’s a mass murderer or the reincarnation of Jesus Christ and it wouldn’t change anything.

 

Hitoshi, because he can’t help but throw oil onto the fire to see what burns, stares back at Todoroki with an equivalently stoic expression and winks.

 

Sadly, Todoroki does nothing but twitch an eyebrow and turn back to his lunch.

 

Midoriya pinches his lips and shrugs like he’s run out of ideas already.

 

At least it’ll be an easy win.

 

Midoriya begins chatting mindlessly about nothing in particular. He starts walking them through what he packed for lunch, speaking confidently into the silent void which is Hitoshi and Todoroki.

 

Hitoshi is simultaneously impressed and disgusted at Midoriya’s ability to talk without any response or engagement. Midoriya transitions smoothly into explaining how he made the lunch, from the temperature of the oven to how he went about cutting everything.

 

Hitoshi easily blocks him out, Midoriya’s voice laying somewhere in between a teacher’s recitation, those free mediation apps tehrapy is outsourced to, and ASMR. It’s surprisingly relaxing--though Hitoshi would never, ever admit it. It’s a nice switch from his usually silent, boring lunches, although he simultaneously looks forward to when he’ll be alone again.

 

Minutes pass smoothly under Midoriya’s monologue. At one point Todoroki speaks up--says something about coriander that Hitoshi tunes out.

 

Then, Todoroki stands up, picking up his tray in one quick, fluid motion.

 

Midoriya startles, frowns, and pulls out his phone. He visibly deflates a little before laughing awkwardly. “Ah, lunch is over already?” He turns to Hitoshi, awkwardly fumbling with his dishes. “It looks like you've won, Shinsou-kun. That’s a bummer... Well, at least we had fun, right?”

 

Hitoshi wants to say you didn’t do anything at all you fucking idiot, but instead, as he’s cleaning up his lunch, he bites out, “Keep your end of the deal. Leave me alone.”

 

Midoriya splits into a wide smile that doesn’t make any sense and turns his phone screen towards Hitoshi. He isn’t sure what he’s supposed to be looking at; Midoriya’s background is surprisingly boring, black and white lines intersecting. That small part of his mind that’s occasionally, against all odds, smart supplies the word fractal, although Hitoshi has no idea what it means. In big, white letters, the time takes up a third of the screen: 11:58 am.

 

But then Midoriya says, “The lunch period isn’t over yet,” and Hitoshi’s heart stops.

 

Todoroki has long left the lunch room, and most of the tables around them are packing up.

 

Technically, legally, lunch ends at noon.

 

But--it was just a trick. Midoriya got lucky. He didn’t even do anything, didn’t even try to make Hitoshi talk. All he did was ask some dumb questions and talk food with Todoroki. The fact that Hitosh did say something had nothing to do with Midoriya--he just thought the game was over already. Yeah, Midoriya just got lucky. Nothing else makes sense.

 

Midoriya is still smiling as he’s packing up his lunch. He starts, with a venomous cheer that reminds Hitoshi too much of Nedzu, “My win was not a mistake, nor luck, nor a coincidence, Shinsou-kun. If you don’t know how I won, then figuring that out is your first homework assignment.”

 

Hitoshi glares, grits his teeth. The audacity. Assigning homework? Like he'd do whatever Midoriya says just because he got lucky.

 

But then he remembers their first meeting, outside of 1-A. Midoriya has those same eyes, even if they're hidden beneath his smile, even if he no longer has those dark bags. That Midoriya was something else, something powerful and dark and (though Hitoshi tries to deny it) scary. He'd almost forgotten, what with Midoriya's cheery smiles and disposition.

 

Midoriya stands up. “See you in class, Shinsou-kun. I look forward to lunch tomorrow.” And he walks away.

 

Maybe he underestimated Midoriya Izuku.

Chapter 22: Extra scenes from chapter 21
Notes:

    I wasn't gonna post this but then I was like, fuck it why not
    (Hitoshi gets his letter from Nedzu; Todoroki's POV of the last scene of ch21)
    I think this counts as a filler chapter, tbh.

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

The streets are cold and dark and quiet and too loud. Every sound echoes against the silence. The city, nor Shinsou Hitoshi, never sleep. The noise comforts him—reminds him that he’s alive and the world actually exists. Yet he doesn’t feel safe walking around without a pocket knife and pepper spray. That’s just the give and take of the city.

 

He’s already library-hopped three times—surpassed his attention span for mangas he’s already read, college-level psychology textbooks, and cheesy self-help books on communication that never actually teach him anything. He’s learned more from religiously reading mangas like The Tomodachi Game and The Liar Game than any public speaker or professor could ever teach him. But there are only so many times you can re-read the same chapters and still learn something new.

 

With his go-to libraries exhausted, Hitoshi heads to his go-to cafe. He takes an indirect route, because it’s (marginally) safer and so he can listen to all of Grimes’ last album.

 

He manages to make it there—safely—halfway through his second playthrough of the album. The cafe is on the edge of a college campus Hitoshi’s yet to identify. It’s small, known only to college kids, the local gangs, and the local homeless population. (Hitoshi considers himself some sort of combination of all three.) It remains safe from petty crimes only because there are rumors it’s owned by a crime lord. It’s open 24/7, has decent coffee for cheap, and won’t kick Hitoshi out even if he stays there all night. It’s all he could ever ask for in a place.

 

When he opens the door and sneaks in, the barista welcomes him with a, “Mornin’, Shinsou!”, despite it being three a.m.

 

Shinsou responds by tugging out his earbuds. By the time he’s made it to the bar, a cup (decorated with a cute drawing of a black cat) is set in front of his seat and filled to the brim—literally—with black coffee. It’s so full he can’t pick it up without losing some of the prized substance, so he awkwardly bends down to skim a bit off the top, reminding himself that these strangers’ opinions of him don’t matter.

 

“Oh, Shinsou!” the barista calls as he’s sitting back up, the cup finally safe to pick up. They search around the cabinets beneath the cash register before pulling out a thick, brown packet and passing it to him. “I’m told this came for you—“ they check the clock before continuing, “about ten hours ago.”

 

Hitoshi scrunches his nose in confusion. The packet is fairly heavy, and went through the legit postal system by the front sticker-label. It’s addressed to him and this location. Specifically.

 

Anxiety and paranoia electrifies his body. What if a mob he pissed off found him? Not that he’s pissed off any mobs to his knowledge, but what if?? What if it’s blackmail? He has no idea what someone would use to blackmail him, but what if??? What if someone put out a hit for him and this is the warning? Or, worse, what if it’s his birth parents, sending him some sick reminder that they still hate him?

 

“I didn’t know you go to UA!” the barista tells him, and Hitoshi finally sees the return address.

 

His anxiety quells minutely. Whispers instead of screams, you’re being expelled.

 

His fingers hesitate above the seal before he rips it open, dumping the contents onto the table. A heavy metal disk lands with a clunk, and a few stray pages fall to the floor. Then the disk flashes a bright light which makes Hitoshi flinch, and the rest of the nearly-empty cafe silence. The light morphs into a projected image and then Hitoshi is making eye-contact with a hologram of Principal Nedzu.

 

The image smiles and waves and chirps all-too-loudly, “Good evening, Shinsou Hitoshi! Or should I say morning? The hours between midnight and four a.m. are challenging to define. That’s a problem for another day, though. I’d like to formally offer you the opportunity to transfer to the hero course—Class 1-A, specifically!”

 

Hitoshi frowns, begins examining the device and packaging, searching for any hint as to who created this stupid prank.

 

Nedzu continues without pause, “To clarify, this is not a prank. The official documents have been attached. Page three will be enough proof.”

 

Hitoshi startles, watches the hologram with a new kind of suspicion.

 

“And, no, this is not a live video. Nor am I capable of reading minds, nor seeing the future!”

 

The barista breaks into a wide smile and pulls out their phone. Hitoshi seriously hopes they aren’t planning on uploading any video. He can imagine the caption: villainous loser reacts to getting into UA hero course PRANK!

 

“I’d like to thank Niikara and Miyano for ensuring this message made it to Shinsou-kun.” The barista squeaks, points to themself with a big smile and mouths, that’s me! Nedzu continues, “You both have my sincere gratitude... To finalize your transfer, you will meet with me and Class 1-A's homeroom teacher, Aizawa-sensei." Hitoshi nearly drops the paged he'd been flipping through. That's Eraserhead! The real-life, actual Eraserhead might (maybe, probably not, hopefully) be Hitoshi's homeroom teacher.

 

Nedzu says, "Come to my office at noon, later today. I know you're free."

 

Hitoshi startles, though at this point isn’t surprised. Nedzu, after all, is right. Hitoshi is free.

 

“While not required, we recommend you bring a guardian with you, as well. I also suggest you get some sleep. It’s an action necessary for the successful functioning of your human body and brain. We’ll see you in approximately nine hours!” And then the video cuts out with a blip, leaving Hitoshi in the cafe.

 

There’s a moment of silence before the barista—Miyano, Hitoshi’s remembering—and the old lady both erupt in conversation at once. Their words mesh and intertwine, and like conflicting frequencies he can’t understand any of it. When the old lady stands up, Hitoshi starts shoving the papers and disk back into the packet, and mapping out the best escape route.

 

He’ll never be able to come here again. They know too much of him, now.

 

“What’re you gonna do?” he manages to parse out, though he can’t tell which one said it.

 

Even if it is a prank, he’d rather embarrass himself by showing up to Nedzu’s office rather than, if it’s not a prank, embarrass himself by not going. Actually, that wouldn’t be embarrassing, that would be missing the chance of a lifetime.

 

In approximately nine hours, Hitoshi will be in Principal Nedzu’s office.

 

- - -

 

Lunch Rush’s cold soba will never be as good as what his mother used to make. He’s failed to perfect a copy of her recipe, can’t even figure out if it’s the noodles or the dipping sauce he has wrong. Lunch Rush’s cold soba is good—Shouto will not deny that—but it’s different. The balance is off. Some flavors too strong while others are too weak.

 

He’s taking a bite of soba when Izuku walks past his lunch table—the table he and his (large) group claimed on the first day of class. This anomaly is the only reason Shouto becomes aware of Izuku's presence, and the fact that Izuku is now walking towards him. Or, more accurately, by the way Izuku’s eyes pass him over, Izuku is walking to the table next to his: the semi-comforting radius of silence which has always housed the transfer kid.

 

When Izuku sits down at the next table over, he waves to Shouto and asks, “Shouto, do you want to join us?”

 

If it was anyone else, he’d answer with a glare and pointed silence. But, it’s Midoriya Izuku who asks, and Shouto’s walking over before he’s made any decision.

 

Izuku introduces him to the transfer student—Shinsou Hitoshi—and he only remembers the name because Izuku says it.

 

Shouto may know little about Izuku, but he knows that Izuku does not do pointless things—from the words he speaks to each breath he takes—Izuku is intentional about everything. Which means that there’s a reason Izuku is approaching Shinsou. And another reason as to why Izuku’s invited Shouto. Shouto may not know what the reason will—and likely never will—but that doesn't bother him, because he trusts it nonetheless. Against all odds, Shouto finds himself trusting Izuku.

 

Shouto nods at Shinsou in greeting—more acknowledgement than he’s given anyone in years. Shinsou doesn't return it, instead bites out, “I thought I made it clear already. I’m not here to make friends,” in a tone which makes every one of Shouto’s muscles tense.

 

Izuku expertly ignores Shinsou’s antagonism and says, just as friendly as ever, “Perfect! Neither is Shouto! I think you’ll both get along great.”

 

Shouto feels Shinsou’s glare, but ignores it. For a fleeting moment he questions Izuku's intentions—wonders if he honestly expects Shouto and Shinsou to get along, or if there's some other meaning behind his words. Shouto immediately gives up and, rather, decides to accept Izuku at face value. And in that case...

 

Shouto can’t begin to imagine being friends with anybody—other than Izuku, he supposes, but he isn’t sure whether it’s friendship or comradery between them. He isn’t even really sure what friendship is.

 

But then Shinsou bites out, with an ignorant confidence, “You both have perfect, flashy quirks.”

 

Shouto tenses. His bones grind at the all-too-familiar words, echoes of Endeavor.

 

He isn’t surprised. He’s used to it. Yet objectifying him to the value of his quirk still hurts.

 

Then Shinsou twists the knife with, “You silver-spooned privileged assholes couldn’t even imagine my life. We’re from different worlds.”

 

Shouto flinches. He sits up so quickly he's nearly half-standing. His quirk jumps at his skin, freezing the bench beneath him. He’s tempted to freeze Shinsou too but then Izuku lets out a dangerous laugh.

 

Shouto sits back down. That's right. Shinsou Hitoshi doesn't matter to him; neither do his misguided opinions.

 

Izuku, with the most serious voice Shouto’s heard from him since USJ, carefully says, “I think... That we’re all more similar than you think.”

 

Shouto snaps to awareness. He looks at Shinsou in a new light—actually looks at Shinsou for the first time.

 

He’s tall. And thin. And the UA uniform doesn’t fit him quite right—too short in the sleeves yet simultaneously too baggy. His face is pale—everywhere except his eyes, which are embedded in circles so dark Shouto seriously questions if it’s bad goth makeup.

 

He’s been hunched over since before Shouto got here, and while he subconsciously assumed it was simply since he was too tall for the table, Shouto now sees how close his tray is. The way his elbows hug the tray. Like he’s trying to hide it—or—protect it.

 

And while Shouto doubts this is what Izuku intended, Shouto can make out similarities in the shadows of their homes.
Notes:

    Was this chapter just a shameless ad for one of my favorite mangas, "The Tomadachi Game"? Maybe. Seriously though it's great, a little convoluted and shark-jumpy at times but I still love it. Sometimes when I'm in a slump and can't write Izuku, Nedzu, or AFO I ask myself--what would Yuuichi? (Yes, this is how I finally managed to write the final scene of ch21)

Chapter 23: Everything is nothing is wrong
Notes:

    Warnings for: social anxiety, low self-esteem, Tomura's violent personality (scenes 3 and 4), Nedzu is a little creepier than usual (scene 2)

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

“Midoriya Izuku,” Aizawa calls the moment class is out.

 

The room slowly empties, leaving Izuku and Aizawa alone... again.

 

Izuku isn’t as worried as he was the last time Aizawa held him back. He isn’t sure why. Anxieties still whisper in the back of his mind, but quieter than usual. Izuku can still hear his heart beating in his ears, but he’s comfortable enough to sit down at one of the front row seats and ask, “What’s up?”

 

Aizawa’s face softens; his aura grows a deeper pink. “Don’t worry,” Aizawa says—and Izuku is instantly worried. What shouldn’t he worry about? What’s wrong?

 

“Nothing’s wrong,” Aizawa continues—he’s speaking quietly, slowly, in a calming tone that sounds wrong coming from the stoic, irritable man. “You’re not in trouble. Everything is fine. Understood?”

 

No. “Yes.”

 

Aizawa cringes. “Nothing is wrong,” he repeats like Japanese isn’t Izuku’s first language. “Do you understand?”

 

Izuku finds himself relaxing. There’s something in Aizawa’s eyes—how they’re a little bigger than usual—that makes Izuku want to trust him. Something in his aura that implies he’s telling the truth.

 

“Okay,” Izuku whispers. He nods and smiles softly. Nothing is wrong. Okay. He can handle that. “Yes, I understand. What’s up?”

 

Aizawa lets out a small, relieved smile—nothing more than a crinkling of his eyes. “Principal Nedzu would like to speak with you.”

 

Izuku’s heart drops until he reminds himself nothing is wrong. He repeats it like a mantra until he can breathe again.

 

“He just wants to meet you," Aizawa continues. "This is nothing more than an introduction. If you’re uncomfortable, we can postpone or cancel it. If you’d like me there, I will be there. Heard?”

 

Izuku nods automatically. The muscles in his upper back loosen.

 

“Would you like me to come with you?”

 

“No,” Izuku answers. He doesn’t want to intrude, can’t expect Aizawa to waste his time babysitting Izuku.

 

“Is that because you don’t want me there, or because you think it’ll inconvenience me?”

 

Izuku flinches. “I don’t not want you there,” he starts, struggling to find the right answer. But the thought of both Nedzu and Aizawa in the same room—two people he has to consider... “It’s just—”

 

Aizawa holds up his hand. “It’s fine. I won’t force you. He’d like to meet with you after school today. Is that acceptable?”

 

That’s so soon. It gives him so little time to prepare. “That’s fine.” He’ll have to let his father know.

 

“Alright. Just remember, if he—when Nedzu makes you uncomfortable, you are free to leave. You are not a prisoner in his office. If you feel like you need an excuse, you can tell him we have supplemental lessons.”

 

Izuku frowns. But that’s lying. Is Aizawa really suggesting lying—to the principal of UA, of all people?

 

Aizawa doesn't pause. “If it’ll help, I’ll invite you to join Shinsou’s lesson today. I’m sure there’s a lot you both could learn from each other.”

 

Izuku chuckles to hide his confusion and says, “Thanks, Sensei.”

 

Aizawa nods and shoos him off with, "Go have fun in English, or whatever it is you kids have next."

 

- - -

 

Stress can express itself in many different forms. For example, Aizawa Shouta shuts down. Isolates himself and refuses to sleep. Yamada Hizashi, on the other hand, stores his stress in energy—he keeps moving, keeps talking, keeps doing something, anything.

 

Nedzu likes to think he successfully compartmentalizes. That he replaces anxiety with logic and rational thought to solve whatever is inducing the stress. This, of course, is mere theory—the ideal. Nedzu holds the self-awareness to know he gets obsessive. When something stresses him out, he can’t think about anything else until it's solved.

 

Nedzu recognizes Midoriya Izuku’s anxiety in his smile—in the careful facade that he is not stressed. It intrigues him, and—as Midoriya continuously does so—reminds Nedzu of his days in captivity, when he was forced to pretend that nothing is wrong.

 

Curiosity slithers under Nedzu’s skin with the same pervasiness as his blood. He can’t not be curious. If he weren't, he wouldn't be Nedzu anymore.

 

He wants to know what Midoriya does when he’s more stressed—will he build up his facade like a wall? Or will it crumble, leaving a vulnerable child behind? Nedzu wants to know. He wants to push and prod at Midoriya’s limits. Wants to find his breaking point. Wants to know what makes him tick.

 

It’s been so long since Nedzu met a puzzle he couldn’t solve quickly.

 

Nedzu recognizes this impulse as bad. He identifies it as an intrusive thought—one he will not act upon. Because psychologically torturing children—anyone—is not a good thing to do. Because he has other, more important priorities. Like making sure Midoriya trusts him enough to confide in him—or, at least—to let his guard down enough for Nedzu to find whatever it is he’s hiding.

 

“Welcome, Midoriya-kun!” Nedzu greets barely a second after Midoriya closes the door behind him. “It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, sit.” He gestures to the couch across from him. He prefers to sit behind his desk—prefers the obvious display of dominance. But his goal, today, is not to intimidate Midoriya. “How would you like your tea?”

 

“The pleasure is mine, Principal Nedzu,” Midoriya answers with a polite bow of his head and a smile that only barely betrays his anxiety. It’s a little too wide and doesn’t quite meet his eyes. “I’m fine, thank you.”

 

Midoriya Izuku sits down. He perches on the edge of the seat like he’s afraid to take up space.

 

Nedzu files away the evidence of low self-esteem—stores it in a recess of his mind to be analyzed later—and pours a cup of tea. “Cream or sugar?”

 

Midoriya clenches his jaw but answers, “Cream, please. Thank you.”

 

Midoriya takes the cup with another bow of his head and takes a small sip.

 

Nedzu sits back, enjoys his own tea, and watches. He says nothing. Midoriya is obviously uncomfortable with the silence and after a minute, interrupts it with a quiet, “What is this meeting regarding?”

 

“Nothing in particular,” Nedzu lies. “I just wanted us to meet. You’ve garnered quite the reputation, Midoriya-kun.”

 

“Sorry,” Midoriya replies.

 

“No need to apologize, Midoriya-kun! It’s not a bad thing—quite the opposite, actually.”

 

Midoriya settles back into his forced smile.

 

Nedzu wants to ask questions—wants to—no needs to know. There are too many mysteries regarding Midoriya Izuku. Too many unanswered inquiries, unsolved problems. Too much unknown. Nedzu wants to force the answers out of the boy—and he could. Nedzu is fully confident in his abilities to manipulate human beings. However, now is not the time. No, Nedzu has patience. He will play the long game, because breaking Midoriya is not what he wants—is not right.

 

And, anyway, getting Midoriya to trust him would be a much more satisfying accomplishment, wouldn’t it? Nedzu has never been one to take the easy route, especially not when faced with such an engaging challenge. So, he will play the long game. He will gain Midoriya Izuku’s trust and then—only then—will he get his answers.

 

“Thank you, Midoriya-kun...” Nedzu starts with a smile.

 

Midoriya’s eyebrows scrunch up in a clear sign of confusion.

 

Nedzu mentally flips through the list of things he has to be gracious for, before settling on the most important—or, more accurately, the most confusing. The biggest conundrum. “Thank you for your analysis of the attack at USJ.”

 

Midoriya flushes, looks away, but before he can protest—put himself down, most likely—Nedzu continues, “It was extremely enlightening.”

 

Midoriya flinches and, for the first time, he looks scared. It lasts barely a moment, but Nedzu memorizes the expression—widened eyes, dropped smile, held breath.

 

What is he afraid of? What did Midoriya hide in those pages—intentionally or not—that could make him so afraid of Nedzu finding it?

 

Nedzu wants to tear apart that report one more time, but remains content to recite it within his own mind. He hesitates on a few parts, but the one that sticks out to him the most—he can’t stop himself from bringing it up. He continues, “Especially the theories on the nomu. What inspired the idea that there may exist a quirk which can give and take others?”

 

It’s the barest of things, but Midoriya flinches—his lips quirk for barely a second, barely a centimeter. But Nedzu notices. He notices but he isn’t sure what it means. Does it mean that Midoriya’s hiding something? Or does it mean that he’s so insecure he can’t believe Nedzu’s praise? Or is he simply uncomfortable sitting in the office of UA’s principal?

 

After a moment Midoriya answers, “Quirk Chaos Theory." He speaks with a confidence he’s lacked so far, and it gives Nedzu the impression that he’s lying, or attempting to manipulate him, or, at the very least, hiding something.

 

Nedzu does find it a little ironic that Midoriya is more suspicious the less anxious he looks. The usual tell of no eye contact works in the opposite direction, for him.

 

“Dr. Adiputra’s Quirk Chaos Theory?” Nedzu prompts. “Or Dr. Kucharski’s?”

 

Midoriya tenses at the mention of the latter, but answers, “Adiputra. Also known as Quirk Rule #34. If you can imagine it, there’s a quirk of it. Or, at least, there could be.”

 

“An interesting application, then,” Nedzu starts—although he’s much more interested in Midoriya’s reaction to Kucharski. “Let’s suppose you’re right—that there exists an individual who holds such power. If they did, in fact, help create the nomu, that means they’re a villain. More significantly, it means said quirk is being used to accomplish villainy. Why create incompentent creatures when they could, potentially, become the strongest human—the strongest villain—in the world?”

 

Midoriya sits on the question like he’s being tested—which, in multiple ways, is true. Nedzu is testing him—has been since the moment he walked into this room. No, that’s inaccurate. Nedzu’s been testing Midoriya Izuku since the entrance exam.

 

Nedzu has had his inklings, no matter how hard Yagi tries to deny it, that All for One is alive. Nedzu has entertained this possibility since Yagi's claim of his demise. It’s only now, after the debut of Shigaraki Tomura and the nomu, that he considers it a legitimate possibility.

 

Midoriya’s theory could simply be that—a theory based on the idea that anything is possible—but there’s also a significance, a level of detail to it that suggests more—that maybe Midoriya knows about All for One.

 

Nedzu likes to think that he suspects everyone, to a certain degree. Even those few he trusts, he does not forget the fact that they are humans—illogical, fallible creatures vulnerable to making mistakes. He may trust Aizawa as a fellow educator and hero, but he does not trust that Aizawa could take down another nomu on his own, or that Aizawa would not crack under torture.

 

It is in this sense that he suspects Midoriya Izuku. After the attack on USJ, Nedzu has not questioned Midoriya’s morals, values, or loyalties. However, Nedzu cannot rule out the possibility that, unknowingly or unwillingly, Midoriya has (or will) betray them.

 

If the boy knows of All for One, by name or not—in a capacity more than theoretical—that implies some sort of connection. A tie between the two which could lead to betrayal. Even if Midoriya Izuku is unaware of it himself.

 

Nedzu understands that this possibility is slim. The chances of such a connection being hidden from All Might—no, from Nedzu himself—are negligible.

 

And, since Nedzu fully trusts Midoriya’s intelligence, Ockham's Razor suggests that the simplest possibility is the most likely. Midoriya Izuku simply applied Adiputra’s Quirk Chaos Theory to hypothesize the existence of a quirk much like All for One. Yes, while the more simple and likely option, it is a little boring.

 

“It’s possible their quirk does not work on themself,” Midoriya starts carefully. “As in, they can take and give quirks but not use them for themself."

 

An interesting theory, Nedzu thinks, but irrelevant in the case of All for One. “What if they can? They could be holding dozens, hundreds of quirks. They could be as powerful as a god, for metaphor's sake. Why not just take care of everything themself?”

 

Midoriya watches his cup of tea like it’ll give him the answer. “For Shigaraki Tomura. For some reason, Shigaraki Tomura is important—he must be the one in the spotlight, not... not this theoretical villain.”

 

Nedzu smiles. “Yes, so then it comes down to... why Shigaraki Tomura? ”

 

It’s a question Nedzu has been pondering since USJ—assuming All for One is behind this, what does he have to gain by hiding behind Shigaraki Tomura? Why did he choose such an immature child to take place as his face?

 

Nedzu’s phone buzzes—reminds him in his own morse code that he has a meeting in five minutes. He flashes Midoriya the biggest smile he can. “It was lovely meeting you, Midoriya-kun. I sincerely enjoyed such a lively discussion. You’re free to stop by anytime to continue this—or a separate—line of inquiry.”

 

- - -

 

Tomura, unfortunately, fully understands the merits of having a party. He’d much rather continue in single player mode, but the next quest can only be beat with allies—with a high-level party.

 

Which is why, despite being the opposite of a team player, Tomura is sitting at the bar, nursing an energy drink and half-playing GTA LI, waiting for The Hero Killer Stain to show up.

 

Tomura was annoyed twenty minutes ago, when Stain was supposed to arrive. Now he’s dangerously furious, killing his character over and over and over again in a failed attempt to relax. Tomura isn’t really sure what being relaxed feels like, but the idea of it is addicting, and he pursues it with a violent rigor.

 

He’s about to blow up his favorite strip club when the bar door squeals open.

 

For a moment, Tomura feels like the protagonist of a classic Western film, interrupted by the squeaky floorboards announcing his nemesis’ arrival. But Stain is not Tomura’s nemesis, oh no. Stain is just a tool, an NPC Tomura needs to recruit to move the plot forward. That’s the only reason he doesn’t kill Stain on sight.

 

Stain stands, unmoving, in the doorway. He observes the bar with an unamused boredom, then announces, “I think I’m in the wrong place.”

 

Tomura shoots to his feet. Plan be damned. Sensei be damned. Tomura’s going to fucking kill him.

 

Before he knows it, he’s on the ground. Stain holds him down. Tomura catches the blade aimed at his neck, hovers his fifth finger just barely above it.

 

Tomura bares his teeth even though Stain can’t see it past Father.

 

“What do you want?” Stain hisses.

 

Right now all he wants is Stain dead.

 

Stain doesn't give him a chance to answer. “What’s your goal with this silly little league? ”

 

“To destroy—” everything, everyone “—hero society,” Tomura seethes. He drops his fifth finger and the blade crumbles. “I’m—we’re—gonna dissolve it all to dust. No matter who gets in my way. And I’m gonna start with All fucking Might.”

 

Stain watches him for a moment before pocketing what remains of his sword. He stands up and levels Tomura with an intense gaze. “I respect your conviction, even if it’s for such an impossible goal.”

 

Tomura growls and jumps to his feet. This NPC is really pushing his fucking limits.

 

“I’ll help you.” Stain sits down casually at the bar, like he owns the place—Tomura’s place. (It’s Sensei’s, technically, but Tomura doesn’t care about that little detail right now.) Stain continues, “At least for now. And not with All Might. He’s the only true hero out there.”

 

“That’s more than enough,” Kurogiri says just to stop Tomura from lashing out. “We sincerely look forward to your assistance.”

 

Reluctantly, Tomura sits on a stool a few down from Stain.

 

“So,” Stain starts. “What’s the plan? And none of that vague destroy shit.”

 

- - -

 

Shigaraki rifles through a messy, unorganized stack of papers that threatens to give Chizome a headache. After too long, he pulls out a small note-card sized piece of paper and slides it over to him.

 

A picture of a boy, with carefully curly green hair and bright eyes and a brighter smile, looks up at him. “What?” Chizome asks and because he sincerely hates Shigaraki he continues with, “Is this your kid brother?”

 

Shigaraki grimaces and flinches backwards like he’s about to throw up. “What the fuck no. He’s a fucking roadblock. You're too low-level to beat him. His CR’s too high.”

 

Chizome looks between the photo of the boy—possibly the most innocent looking being Chizome’s ever seen—and Shigaraki Tomura—who looks like a raisin that would kill its own kid if it looked at him wrong.

 

Shigaraki is eyeing the picture with an emotion Chizome can’t place... until Shigaraki clenches his jaw and looks away.

 

Chizome lets out a loud, deep laugh as he drops the photo. “You’re afraid!” He announces like it’s the best news in the world. “You’re afraid of a fucking tween-aged bunny rabbit! ”

 

Shigaraki scowls with his entire face. “Am not,” and he sounds like a petulant teenager. “I’m just fucking—god dammit motherfucking pissed off that it’s against the rules to kill him.”

 

That makes Chizoem pause. “What? Why?”

 

Shigaraki makes a gagging sound. In a mocking tone which suggests he's been told the line many, many tiems, Shigaraki says, “We’re not allowed to kill kids.”

 

“You don’t kill kids?” The concept is so foreign coming out of Shigaraki's mouth. The idea that this man—an evil, psychopathic son of a bitch who murders for the heck of it—the idea that Shigaraki Tomura has morals doesn’t make any sense. Chizome almost laughs.

 

“Unfortunately,” Shigaraki hisses, and Chizome can hear the eye-roll.

 

- - -

 

It bothers Izuku all day. His mind keeps summoning up that question like it’s an assignment his father gave him that he still needs to finish.

 

Why Shigaraki Tomura?

 

He knows it’s just a hypothetical—the chances of another individual with the same quirk as his father are so incredibly slim. Just as Adiputra’s Quirk Theory suggests the existence of any and every quirk, Kucharski claims that no two quirks are exactly the same. And Izuku hypothesizes that both could be true.

 

But Izuku knows—theorizes—that there is someone bigger, badder, smarter, and stronger than Shigaraki pulling the strings. But why would someone stronger and smarter need a face? Why would they need to hide behind Shigaraki Tomura?

 

Izuku drafts theories on his phone, researches structures of organized crime groups, and accomplishes nothing but raising more questions. He's missing something. He knows it, he just doesn't know what.

 

When he gets home, he almost expects his father to greet him with the question—to ask him himself why Shigaraki Tomura? But Father just smiles and asks, "How was your day, Izuku?"

Chapter Text

 

A couple days ago

 

“What do you want?” Shouta asks, stopping in his tracks. He recognized the hop in her step four minutes ago. Leading her into this witness-less alleyway was much too easy.

 

She giggles a sound that haunts his nightmares and exclaims, “Always so rude, Eraserhead!”

 

Shouta narrowly dodges her attempt at a hug, side-stepping and spinning around so they’re face-to-face.

 

Ms. Joke is smiling, of course. “Is that any way to greet your girlfriend?”

 

“We aren’t dating,” Shouta says automatically. He already has enough happy-go-lucky, extroverted optimists in his life.

 

“But darling,” Ms. Joke whines as if she isn’t a thirty-year-old pro hero. “This is important!”

 

Important—coming from Ms. Joke—could mean anything from new hero merch release to the literal end of the world.

 

She grins too-wide, mischievousness dark in her eyes. “It’s about our son!”

 

Shouta can’t help it. He chokes on his spit and flinches backwards. Even though he knows she’s joking—she’s always joking—this is a new low. “I—we—I don’t have a son.”

 

Ms. Joke snickers. “Of course you do, silly! And I’d like to file for joint custody. You can have the rest of the school year, but I get the next two weeks! Deal?”

 

Two weeks? It takes Shouta a moment to recognize the significance. His class’s upcoming internships last two weeks. “You’re poaching one of my—” he just stops himself from saying kids “—students?”

 

Which one? The idea frightens him. Oh god, what if it’s Aoyama? Or Tokoyami? Fuck, she could create a monster.

 

“Isn’t it obvious?” Ms. Joke asks.

 

Present day

 

The bell is still ringing when Shouta announces, “Midnight will be taking over today’s class.”

 

Nemuri interprets the following silence as her cue to enter. “Good morning, kiddos!” she exclaims with a wave, settling comfortably behind Shouta’s desk (Shouta has, of course, curled up in the corner of the room in his sleeping bag).

 

She has to actively temper her energy. She’s spent so much time and effort honing her hero persona that it’s easy to forget how to be a real human being—a teacher. And interacting with teenagers—especially ones so traumatized—requires a different set of skills than talking up the media.

 

She gives a short pause for the responding good morning’s, letting the kids adapt to her presence in their homeroom. “Who’s ready to pick your hero names?”

 

The classroom erupts into a carefully contained cheer one can only find in Shouta’s classroom.

 

It’s moments like these that make teaching worth it. Getting to be a part of such a formative decision—one that will likely influence these kids for the rest of their lives. That’s why she became a teacher. And these kids are all so wonderful—strong and smart and empathetic—no matter how much Shouta tries to deny it.

 

Nemuri takes a moment to appreciate the big smiles and instant brainstorming before she starts the activity with, “Who can define public image? ”

 

She delivers a concise spiel about public image and relation, then distributes whiteboards to every student. “Now’s your time to shine, kiddos! I’ll be here to answer any questions and help out as much as I can!”

 

Some of them jump right into it. Kaminari, for instance, is immediately caught in a loop of scribbling and erasing and scribbling and erasing. Kirishima has already written down Red Riot and has turned to Bakugou, who’s staring at his whiteboard like it’s poisoned. There are a few other students who don’t make any moves—Iida Tenya, Todoroki Shouto, and Shinsou Hitoshi—most notably.

 

Nemuri slowly makes her way over to Shinsou, shooting Midoriya a small wave and smile as she passes. She purposefully ignores his whiteboard, excited to be surprised whenever Midoriya decides to share it with her.

 

“Hiya, Shinsou-kun!" Nemuri starts, crouching down next to his desk. "Do you have any ideas? Anything you’re debating between?”

 

Shinsou scowls at her and bites out, “No.”

 

Nemuri pouts a bit, but doesn’t give up—one of her best friends is Aizawa Shouta, after all. “Do you want help brainstorming, kiddo?”

 

His scowl deepens and he glares at her like she’s Mineta. “I’m not a kiddo,” he grumbles. And, ironically, that’s the most immature he’s ever sounded, so Nemuri can’t hold back her chuckle.

 

That just makes him growl—or seethe, maybe—and spin back to his whiteboard with a fervor. He gets more and more tenses as he glares at it, but then the tension evaporates off his skin. Replacing his scowl is a smirk ten times worse. He hastily scrawls something down in a handwriting Nemuri can’t read, then holds it up to her face.

 

It takes her a few moments to comprehend it, and when she does she isn’t quite sure how to feel.

 

It reads Brainstorm.

 

He drops the board, exposing his threatening smile that looks exactly like Shouta’s. He asks, “Happy?” with a toxic cheer. Then his face falls and he deadpans, “Now leave me alone.”

 

Nemuri smiles—god she loves these kids. She wants to praise his choice of name, wants to try and chip away at that cold exterior like she did with Shouta, but she respects Shinsou’s wishes.

 

She shoots him a thumbs up, exclaims, “Yup!”, and hops off.

 

 

When a majority of the class have at least something written down, Nemuri stands back at the front of the room. “Alrighty! If you feel comfortable, let’s share our names with the whole class! Remember, kiddos, to be respectful of everyone—even if you don’t like their idea!” She’s so excited. God, she’s actually jealous of Shouta. How did he get such a great group of kids? “Midoriya-kun, would you like to come up here and start us off?” she announces a little softer than usual—hyper aware of Midoriya in the most empathetic of ways.

 

Midoriya matches her smile, picks up his board, and stands up. “Sure,” he starts. “I’d be honored.”

 

The room silences in expectation. Midoriya gracefully walks up to the desk and flips his board around.

 

“Peacekeeper,” he announces. “A symbol of peace.”

 

The class oo’s and ah’s and Uraraka starts applauding.

 

Nemuri smiles. “That’s perfect, Midoriya-kun. Question, though, why a symbol of peace and not the symbol of peace?”

 

“Because I won’t be the only one,” he answers simply.

 

She’s filled with a sort of pride she hasn’t felt in years. But underneath that is a thin strand of dread. She’s worried for these kids—for Midoriya and everyone else. Worried because they shouldn’t have to pick their hero names at the age of fourteen. Worried because no teenager should ever have to go through what they did. Worried because Nedzu is convinced it isn’t over—that they’re going to encounter villains again.

 

They’re just kids. She really hopes no one—especially themselves—ever forgets that.

 

- - -

 

Shouta is worried about three of his students. No, that’s a big fat lie, he’s worried about all of his students. But in this moment three stand out like they brought fucking red flags to class show and tell. Iida, Todoroki, and Bakugou failed to choose a hero name, falling back onto their first names like a samurai committing seppuku. This is especially concerning because Todoroki and Iida are both from hero families.

 

While Shouta is aware of what happened to Ingenium and how that could be impacting Iida, Todoroki does not have such an excuse.

 

Does that mean Shouta will do anything about it? No. At least, not yet. They're still kids; he can't expect them to have their whole life planned in front of them, even if they have already decided to be heroes.

 

Nemuri says her goodbye with an expertly tempered fanfare and his students whine their disappointment to see her leave. Shouta slowly takes back his spot behind the desk. He pulls out a stack of twenty folders and drops it onto the surface.

 

“Now that that’s over with,” he grumbles. “Everyone needs to decide who they’re going to intern with. You can pick anyone from your list of offers.” He starts depositing each folder onto the corresponding desk, some (like Todoroki’s and Bakugou’s) obviously thicker than the rest. “If you need help deciding, ask the person sitting next to you. I’m gonna take a nap. When you’ve decided, fill out the form and put it on my desk.”

 

- - -

 

Izuku already knows who he’s interning with—Gran Torino—and he’s relieved the decision has already been made for him. His stack of offers is pretty thick. He recognizes and respects every single hero there. Izuku fills out his form quickly, places it on Aizawa’s desk, and then sits back down at his seat, turning around to Shinsou with a small smile. “Who are you picking, Shinsou-kun?”

 

Shinsou frowns and doesn’t look up from his papers. He sits hunched over them, arms guarding the edges, in a way which means Izuku can’t read any of it. Shinsou hisses, “Nobody,” but his aura is a wobbly bright green—he’s proud.

 

Izuku wants to know who requested Shinsou—wants to bounce pros and cons with him—but he knows not to push. So he says a simple, “Congrats,” and walks to the back of the classroom.

 

“Izuku,” Shouto greets neutrally. He hands Izuku his folder without another word and watches as Izuku flips through it.

 

At the top of the stack is Endeavor himself. Nearly half of Shouto's offers come from other heroes within the Endeavor Agency, which could simply be because most fire quirk users are there, or Endeavor manipulated it.

 

“Do you know who you’re picking?” Izuku asks as he hands the folder back.

 

Shouto says nothing, but picks up the top paper and hands it over. Endeavor.

 

Izuku cringes. His heart drops into his stomach like a bowling ball. That’s a bad idea. God, it’s such a bad idea but Izuku knows. He knows that Shouto probably doesn’t have any other choice—that if he went with anyone else Endeavor would...

 

Is there nothing he can do? Izuku hands back the paper with shaking hands and a weak smile. “Are you sure?” he asks quietly.

 

Shouto says, “Of course,” and his aura spikes, jumps like it’d been slapped. He’s lying.

 

“Awesome,” Izuku tries, but it sounds hollow even to his own ears.

 

He wants to reassure Shouto he’s here for him. He wants to ask so many questions, wants to try and ensure Shouto’s as safe as possible. But Izuku can’t, here. Those questions aren’t safe to ask, here.

 

Where is safe, though? Izuku cannot trust text messaging or email—his father can (and has) accessed them, and it’s highly possible Endeavor does the same. But they only ever interact at school. Izuku is momentarily tempted to invite Shouto to hang out after classes, but the idea riddles him with anxiety. Maybe Shouto wouldn’t want to hang out—doesn’t want to interact with Izuku more than necessary. Shouto probably has other friends—real friends—that he’d rather talk with. Just because Shouto was a little vulnerable once doesn’t mean they’re suddenly the best of friends.

 

And, anyway, Izuku would have to come up with an excuse for his father.

 

So, Izuku says, “Awesome,” and goes back to his seat.

 

- - -

 

Shouta would not say he enjoys being surrounded by teenagers, but there is something relaxing about the constant chatter—about existing in a space with other human beings that he (mostly) trusts. He listens, secretly, to his students make rash, illogical decisions while others carefully weigh pros and cons. He listens and says nothing while Yaoyorozu picks Uwabami and Iida picks Manual. He listens until Shinsou Hitoshi walks up to his corner.

 

“Eraserhead,” Shinsou starts. There’s a nervous timbre in his voice, an unsteadiness that Shouta’s never heard from him before. Shinsou’s always worn the mask of indifferent cockiness without fail.

 

So Shouta feels completely justified when he growls, “What’s wrong?” and reaches for his capture weapon.

 

Shinsou hands over a sheet of paper—the contact information for his internship offers—and asks, “What the fuck is this?”

 

Shouta relaxes, minutely—as much as he can relax—and takes the page.

 

There are six names on the list, but the first five are scribbled out with a sparkly pink ink, complete with frowny faces and scathing puns. The last one is circled more times than Shouta can count, with arrows pointing to it, surrounded by smiley faces and little hearts. The last agency’s phone number is crossed out, replaced by a personal number Shouta unfortunately recognizes.

 

It’s Ms. Joke. The last name on Shinsou's list is Ms. Joke.

 

A couple days ago

 

"Isn't it obvious?" Ms. Joke starts. She skips up to Shouta, pokes him in the chest, and looks up at him with a terrifying brightness in her eyes. “Shinsou Hitoshi!”

 

His stomach flips. For a moment he tastes bile at the back of his throat. That’s a terrible idea. How could he have missed it? It’s perfect. Terribly perfect.

 

“Hah! His quirk is so similar to mine, darling. And he’s the mirror image of his father—”

 

Shouta has no idea what Shinsou’s father looks like, let alone if he even exists.

 

Ms. Joke pokes him in the chest. “—You!”

 

“I am not his—” Shouta tries to deny, but Ms. Joke places a finger over his lips and shushes him.

 

“No use denying it, darling. Even if you weren’t before, you are now.” She hops backwards, finally leaving his personal space. “Now, back to business.” She points between Shouta and herself. “Your son? My internship? Huh? Huh?”

 

He drags his hand down his face. What is his life.

 

He wants to say no. God, how much he wants to say no.

 

But the rational, logical part of his brain—a large majority of it, unfortunately—insists that it’s a good idea. They do have similar quirks. Ms. Joke would be able to teach Shinsou things Shouta can’t—like how to fight and talk simultaneously, or how to incite a response from a villain, hell, how to fucking talk to people.

 

Shouta mutters, “If he agrees—”

 

Ms. Joke squeals in delight, spins in a couple quick circles, then throws herself at Shouta.

 

Shouta freezes. He cannot handle a hug right now. He snaps, “Fukukado,” and she freezes immediately, managing to switch directions mid-air and nearly ram herself into the wall.

 

“And that’s why consent is important, kiddos!” she says to no one as she picks herself up. She shoots one last smile at Shouta. “See you tonight at my place, honey! I’ll have a nice tiramisu waiting!”

 

“No you won’t,” Shouta grumbles as she skips off.

 

Present day

 

“Why—” Shinsou starts, then scowls and tries, “How?”

 

“I’m sure you don’t wanna know, kid,” Shouta answers with a twin scowl.

 

“What does she want with me?” Shinsou asks. There’s a fear in his voice, a distrust that Shouta recognizes all too well.

 

Shinsou’s afraid—if only Shouta knew what of.

 

“To train you,” Shouta answers.

 

Shinsou’s face cycles through various emotions quicker than Shouta can keep up with. He scowls, smiles, frowns, before pinching his lips together. “But she’s—and I’m—” He snaps his teeth together before glaring at Shouta. “Who should I pick?” he asks.

 

Shouta ignores the obvious change of subject to look back at the list. They’re all good heroes. A few of them, though, just aren’t capable of offering Shinsou what he needs, which narrows the list down to just two: Wordsmith and Ms. Joke.

 

Wordsmith is a fantastic underground hero, but she's... particular. She's much better with college students than she is high schoolers. There's a level of convoluted intricacy which paints her every word. Shinsou would get more from an internship with Wordsmith in a year or two than he would now.

 

Which leaves... a sour taste in Shouta’s mouth. He doesn’t want to say it, but his priority right now is Shinsou’s education. His students. Reluctantly, like someone’s holding a gun to his head, Shouta says, “Ms. Joke.”

 

Shinsou spits out, “Fine.” Then he spins on his heels and stalks over to his desk. Shouta watches from afar as Shinsou speed-runs through his form.

 

What the fuck has Shouta done?

Chapter Text

Izuku is not sure what he’s doing standing in front of this dilapidated building. He last saw traces of civilization fifteen minutes east. As far as he knows, this part of town is completely uninhabited. Yet no matter how many times he checks the address, he still ends up here.

 

He understands that Gran Torino is retired. Izuku had not been expecting a twenty-floor hero agency, or even a building dedicated solely to Gran Torino. He had been perfectly prepared to train at a public gym. He was not prepared for this abandoned, crumbling building.

 

Izuku takes a step forward. He’s already wasted too much time second-guessing. Now he’ll only be three minutes early—assuming this is the right place. He swallows down his anxiety and knocks on the door. It creaks open under his knuckles, slowly exposing the inside of the building—

 

Gran Torino is laying on the floor. Covered in blood.

 

Izuku freezes. Panic wraps around his throat. Was this an accident? A villain attack? He needs to make sure there isn’t an active threat but first Izuku drops to his knees and wrenches the first-aid kit out of his backpack. Izuku cannot see the pulsating purple of Gran Torino’s mischievousness past the red of blood. He reaches out to check Gran Torino’s injuries and Gran Torino

 

jumps to his feet, spits out some blood, and announces, “I’m not dead!” He stares at Izuku for a moment before asking, “Who are you?” much too loudly.

 

He’s not dead. Good. Okay. That’s good. But, is Gran Torino alright? What happened? Is there still a villain nearby? Is Gran Torino under the effects of a quirk? Izuku reaches out, eyebrows furrowed in concern. “We should get those checked. You might have a concussion.”

 

Gran Torino purses his lips, runs a finger through the blood soaking into his hero costume, and licks it off. “It’s ketchup, boy. Good for your eyes.”

 

Ketchup? Why would there be ketchup? Is it poisoned? Does someone have a nefarious ketchup-manipulating quirk?

 

Gran Torino blinks once, looks at Izuku and, with the exact same tone as earlier, asks, “Who are you?”

 

Izuku still isn’t sure what happened—what’s happening, so he asks, “Are you sure you’re alright, sir?”

 

Gran Torino steps up closer to him. “Who are you?”

 

Izuku has to stop thinking. None of this makes sense. He can’t make it make sense so he has to stop thinking about it. “Midoriya Izuku,” he answers, standing up. He extends his hand for a handshake as if everything were okay.

 

Gran Torino looks at it and repeats, “Who are you?”

 

Izuku flinches, but answers again, “Midoriya Izuku.”

 

“No you’re not,” Gran Torino says with such confidence it makes Izuku stutter.

 

He’s not? Oh, god. What if he isn’t Midoriya Izuku?

 

Izuku’s hands shake. He clutches at the idea of himself, scrambles for the proof that he is Midoriya Izuku. It doesn’t help. Maybe someone altered his memory with a quirk. Maybe everyone has been lying to him this whole time. Maybe he isn’t Midoriya Izuku.

 

“Who are you?” Gran Torino asks again and Izuku can no longer feel his heart beating.

 

What’s the right answer? If it isn’t Midoriya Izuku, what is it? What does Gran Torino know that he doesn’t? If he gets this wrong—no, he can’t be wrong. He can’t.

 

Gran Torino frowns and juts his finger at Izuku’s briefcase—the one carrying his hero costume. “Get dressed.”

 

Izuku does. Getting dressed is something simple—something he knows how to do. He knows the right answer. He just has to get dressed.

 

He stands in front of Gran Torino in his suit, skin shivering with nervous adrenaline.

 

“Who are you?” Gran Torino asks again.

 

Izuku flinches and blurts out, “I’m sorry,” because he can’t say I don’t know.

 

A light flips on behind Gran Torino’s eyes. An awareness settles there that he’d lacked before, like he’s actually seeing Izuku for the first time. Gran Torino stands up straighter, settles a serious frown on his face, then gently pokes Izuku in the chest with his cane. “Don’t let anybody tell you who you are, boy.” He slams his cane onto the ground with a bam, lifts his chin in such a way that, while still being shorter than Izuku, Gran Torino is looking down on him. “Now, tell me. Who are you?”

 

Izuku swallows. He spares a moment to breathe again, to relax as much as he can. He closes his eyes and lets himself feel the pounding of his heart, the tension in his joints. Yes. He knows this body. He knows himself. “Midoriya Izuku,” he answers with a confidence that might not be false. “A hero. A symbol of peace. Peacekeeper.”

 

Gran Torino smiles for the first time, a thin, wide expression that dominates his face. “It’s nice to meet you, Peacekeeper.”

 

- - -

 

Sorahiko has one goal for the next two weeks—make Midoriya Izuku a better hero. Nothing else, within reason, matters. Which is why Sorahiko does not apologize for tricking Midoriya. He learned invaluable information from the encounter, and would do it again if the situation arouse. He is not here to make the boy comfortable. Sorahiko does not need Midoriya to trust him.

 

As long as Midoriya learns how to use One for All properly—as long as he becomes a great hero—Midoriya’s feelings do not matter. If the boy needs a shoulder to cry on, he can find one elsewhere—in his father or Toshinori.

 

This is a war, and everyone has their roles to play. So, Sorahiko will play his role and make Midoriya the best goddamn hero.

 

It’s the only way Sorahiko will ever be able to forgive himself for pushing Midoriya too far.

 

Sorahiko leads Midoriya into the dining room. He announces, “Now! Try and catch me, Peacekeeper!” and throws himself at the ceiling.

 

 

If Sorahiko did embarrassment, the five seconds it takes Midoriya to catch him would be high on his list. However, Sorahiko simply claps Midoriya on the back and announces, “I’m impressed! I underestimated you. Let’s kick things up a notch.”

 

“It wasn’t that impressive,” Midoriya starts, face flushed and staring at the ground. “I have four quirks so I have—”

 

Sorahiko slaps him gently across the face. “When someone compliments you, you say thank you. Trying to argue is disrespectful.”

 

Midoriya frowns, but after a moment he nods.

 

“Alright, let’s try this again," Sorahiko says. "I’m impressed, Peacekeeper. You did a great job. I underestimated you.”

 

Midoriya mumbles out a quiet, “Thank you.”

 

“Now, let’s kick things up a notch.”

 

Sorahiko leads Midoriya up the creaky, crumbling staircases to the roof. He points to the next building over. “Get yourself over there,” he says. “However you want. As long as you go directly from this rooftop to that one. Don’t get smart with me.”

 

- - -

 

Izuku makes it across the roofs once, twice, twelve times—he tries different strategies each time. He Pulls himself over the distance. He jumps across with One for All. He pushes himself off the wall.

 

After the twelfth time, Gran Torino nods, frowns, and silently walks back down the stairs. Izuku follows him back into the kitchen.

 

“I thought so,” Gran Torino announces as he opens the fridge. “You’re using One for All incorrectly.”

 

Izuku flinches.

 

“Or, more accurately, you’re using all your quirks incorrectly.”

 

Impossible. He’s been training with most of these quirks all his life. His father would have told him—

 

“Explain it to me,” Gran Torino instructs the refrigerator. “Step by step. How did you get to the other rooftop?”

 

“Well, I turned on One for All to—”

 

“Wrong,” Gran Torino announces as he takes some taiyaki out. “You didn’t turn it on because it’s always on.” He tosses the package onto the countertop and leans towards Izuku. “Just like your brain—” he pokes Izuku’s forehead with his cane “—or your heart—” now he pokes Izuku’s chest “—it’s always on. Just sometimes you’re conscious of using it and sometimes you aren’t.”

 

But One for All is not like his brain or heart, because One for All is something separate. It’s more like a pair of glasses, isn’t it? Because it isn’t a part of him, it’s just something he’s borrowing. Like every other quirk he has.

 

Gran Torino frowns as if he can read Izuku’s mind and turns back to the taiyaki. As he’s putting it in the microwave he says, “Tell me, boy, how do you use your brain? Do you have to flip it on to start using it? No... Your quirks are the same.”

 

In the heavy, uncomfortable silence that follows, Izuku thinks. He thinks. He thinks about thinking. He thinks about thinking about thinking in a convoluted, ouroboros fashion that just makes him more confused.

 

“It’s not the same,” Izuku mumbles. “One for All isn’t a part of me. I’m just borrowing it.”

 

A heavy, dangerous silence settles in between them. Izuku can hear the tension in the quiet grinding of Gran Torino’s teeth, in the flexing of his knuckles atop his cane, in the echoing hum of the microwave.

 

The microwave beeps; Izuku jumps and Gran Torino pulls out his phone, punches in a few numbers, and slaps his ear with it.

 

Gran Torino growls, “Toshinori. I’m gonna beat your ass so bad All for One will look like a cute little puppy." After a short moment, he snaps, "You’re not fit to be a teacher.” He chucks his phone across the room.

 

Izuku swallows.

 

Gran Torino bares his teeth. “Alright. Let’s backtrack then. Peacekeeper, One for All is your quirk.”

 

Izuku opens his mouth to argue but Gran Torino pokes his chest and leans forward until their faces are inches away. “One for All. Is. Your. Quirk. Do you understand?”

 

Izuku nods.

 

“I see you still don’t believe me, so let’s prove it. Sit.” Gran Torino leads Izuku to a spot on the carpeted floor. “Stay.” He hastily leaves, comes back within the minute, and hands Izuku a set of heavy headphones and a blindfold. “Put these on. Think about One for All and nothing else."

 

Izuku hesitates. He’s scared. He does not want to trap himself—let alone in his own body.

 

“I’ll keep you safe,” Gran Torino states. Izuku believes him. If anyone can protect him it would be the man who mentored All Might, wouldn’t it?

 

Izuku nods, wraps the blindfold around his eyes, and slides on the headphones.





 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I’m alone.

 

It’s my fault. I don't know. No one likes meI'msorryallalone

 

You’re not       whispers a voice that is not quite his—that is his and numerous other voices.

 

He doesn’t know who they are—what they’re doing in his head—but the interruption quiets his anxiety, gives him space.

 

 

 

 

 

One for All. He’s supposed to think about One for All. He searches for it, flips it on slowly. It feels like he’s finally breathing after holding his breath. He turns it off, but can still hear the echoes of it, like a shadow between his ribcage. He follows it.

 

Toshinori is not your father, it—he—they saythink. His heart jumps and One for All jumps with it.

 

Yagi is nothing like his father. No, Yagi is kind and honest and selfless and caring and doesn’t have any expectations of Izuku. He told Izuku that One for All is his quirk, now. Izuku trusts Yagi—trusts All Might—so he has to trust that One for All is his quirk.

 

You are One for All.

 

A heavy weight lifts from his body. Of course. It's so obvious. He feels like he's known it forever, but had just forgotten it.

 

He is One for All.

 

An electric hum skitters across Izuku’s skin. Sparks hop off him in little waves. As he exhales, One for All settles throughout his body. The headphones fall from his head and he tears the blindfold off. When he opens his eyes it’s like he’s in another world.

 

Gran Torino's aura is a bright proud aqua. But past that Izuku can sense the aura of a street rat—hungry and confused. He can just barely sense someone else, bored, nearly ten blocks west. He knows exactly how far away they are because Pull has already grabbed onto everything it can. Because Pull is already—always—at the ready.

 

Izuku himself is a blue speckled with gold flecks—confident and content. His color taints the edges of his vision. But underneath that Izuku can make out the scarred white stripes, his constant core of yellow.

 

Gran Torino shoots him a big honest smile and suggests, “Run.”

 

Izuku runs. He runs so quickly he finds himself on the roof before he can remember taking the stairs. One for All thrums throughout his body alongside his heartbeat. Izuku can feel the quiet whispering of Regeneration—a surprising constant alongside his nerve endings. It heals things Izuku didn’t even know were broken. It threads through his muscles as he uses them.

 

Izuku does not have to use Pull to get himself to the other side, just as he does not have to use his lungs to breathe. It all happens automatically.

 

Izuku leaps across rooftops without thinking, without a destination, without a plan. For the first time in years, Izuku’s mind is quiet.

 

 

He isn’t sure how long he’s out there, but by the time he seeks out Gran Torino’s aura and makes it back, the sun is setting. Gran Torino slaps him on the back and pulls Izuku into a tight hug, disregarding Izuku’s thin layer of sweat.

 

 

“You need to get used to it,” Gran Torino instructs. “You may have technique, but you’ll never be able to make the most of One for All if you don’t live in it, if you don’t let it become a part of you.”

 

So Izuku does. He brushes his teeth with One for All skittering along his skin. When he breaks the toothbrush Gran Torino readily supplies him with a new one. He sits at the desk, scribbling down analysis notes, with One for All humming in his bones. He goes to the grocery store while One for All settles in between his cells. He takes a nap on Gran Torino’s old, dusty, comfortable couch as One for All breathes.

 

It is only after three days of simply existing with One for All that Gran Torino declares they can start patrolling.

 

 

“Where are we going?” Izuku asks five minutes into the train ride. 

 

“Teizo,” Gran Torino answers simply. “It’s just past Hosu, but should be a little quieter, considering all this Hero Killer business. Don’t worry, it won’t bore us.”

 

Iida and Shouto are both in Hosu, which Izuku knows because he’s incredibly worried about the two of them. Iida’s decision to intern with Manual is, undoubtedly, influenced by Stain’s presence in Hosu.

 

And Shouto’s interning with Endeavor.

 

Izuku would like to stop by, to just check in and make sure they’re both surviving, but he doesn’t want to ask Gran Torino to change his plans. So, instead, he shoots them both a text message. To Iida he sends, What can I do for you? And to Shouto, How are you doing?

 

Shouto responds near instantly with, Fine.

 

Iida doesn’t. Izuku gives him a minute, then another, then another before he lets the anxiety sink in. Iida is usually quick to respond if he isn’t actively in class, so Izuku tries to convince himself that he’s just busy with his internship.

 

Izuku’s checking the news to make sure Stain hasn’t made another appearance when the lights in the train flicker off. There’s a moment of apprehensive silence before the train creaks. An entire wall rips off and a large, hulking, inhuman creature screeches.

 

Gran Torino doesn’t hesitate. He orders, “Stay here!” to Izuku and throws himself at the creature, knocking them both off the rails and tumbling into the city.

 

It’s a nomu.

 

It’s a nomu.It’sanomu.

 

Izuku can’t stop himself from jumping out of the train to the nearest rooftop. Staying there doesn’t even cross his mind as an option.

 

The city is burning, smoldering in rooftops, alleyways, courtyards. From here he can spot three main conflicts. A nomu—a different nomu—soars through the sky like a vulture. Gran Torino is tumbling with not one, but two nomus. The center of the city is chaos.

 

Izuku isn’t sure he wants to know how many nomus in total there are.

 

Izuku runs across rooftops. He looks, he listens, he feels. The city is soaked in yellow, a fear which nips at Izuku’s ankles and threatens to pull him under it. He fights back, finds the little pockets of blue strength and wraps himself up in it like armor.

 

He picks through the yellow with a fine tooth comb—searching. Searching for what, he isn’t sure. Maybe Iida, or Shouto, or Stain, or Shigaraki.

 

Instead he finds a lost little girl, separated from her mother in the chaos. Izuku knows where her mother is before the girl’s finished talking. He reunites them within minutes, but doesn’t stick around for the mother’s thanks, or her pleas that he get to safety. He doesn’t hear her because Manual is running past them yelling, “Iida-kun?! Where are you, Iida-kun?!” And a few alleyways east there’s a heavy blood-red haze that Izuku, somehow, recognizes as The Hero Killer’s.

Chapter Text

Tenya does not make rash or impulsive decisions. Everything from what he eats for breakfast to his every move in a fight is carefully calculated. When he was younger, he would write down the pros and cons of every option before he could make a decision. Now, he naturally computes those in his head on a subconscious level.

 

The only pro he recalls for this plan of action is vengeance. It’s the only pro that matters.

 

Laying on the hard concrete and half-dead in a dark alley, Tenya still does not regret his decision. He only wishes he could have succeeded. Regret is pointless; he made his choices. Anyway, if he dies at the hand of the man who maimed his brother, that’s a kind of poetry too, isn’t it?

 

“You’re a fake,” Stain spits out from a few feet away.

 

If Stain wasn’t so dedicated to those monologues of his, Tenya would probably already be dead.

 

“You think you can be a real hero, child?” Stain continues. “Revenge? Don’t be selfish. You’re no better than all those fucking villains.”

 

Tenya hisses, “You’re the villain,” even though it takes too much effort. Every movement of his jaw pounds at his head. It’s a miracle he can move his mouth at all, considering the rest of him is paralyzed.

 

Stain lets out a bellowing laugh that echoes across the empty walls. Then it abruptly cuts off.

 

Tenya’s heart stops when a familiar voice announces, “Iida-kun! Manual is looking for you!”

 

- - -

 

Izuku does not have time to think. He does not get a chance to plan, to refresh himself on what little he knows about Stain. He does not get to scope out the alleyway or count the number of weapons Stain is carrying or ensure Iida's still alive. He barely has enough time to send his location to the class group chat.

 

Izuku takes in the situation as quickly as he can—Iida and Native on the ground, Stain relatively unharmed—and announces his presence to distract Stain from executing his friend.

 

“Iida-kun!” Izuku greets with a cheer that’s anything but relaxed. Carry a clipboard and act like you belong, his father likes to say. If you act confident you can get away with anything—you can accomplish anything. “Manual is looking for you!”

 

Iida croaks out a quiet, “Run... The blood—when he licks it—”

 

Stain barks out a sharp laugh. “What, you’re trying to play hero, bunny rabbit? Leave this to the pros. Go, run away. Shoo. Shoo.” Stain waves him off with a short dagger.

 

“Are you alright, Iida-kun?” Izuku asks instead, taking a slow step forward. He remains aware of Stain with all of his senses—tentatively grabs onto him with Pull and prods him with Empathy.

 

“Get out of here,” Iida groans. “Please.”

 

Izuku makes eye contact with Iida and smiles. He smiles like he can protect Iida with it, like his smile alone will knock out Stain. He smiles like it may be the last thing he ever does.

 

Stain throws himself at Iida with an impressive speed—except one which does not even begin to compare with Gran Torino's.

 

Izuku jumps at him, kicks at Stain's legs. Stain blocks it mid-air with his katana, flying backwards, then kicking off the wall.

 

Izuku never turned One for All on, no, because One for All has been on since before he woke up this morning. His quirk blankets around him like it’s always been there, like he was born with it. He dodges Stain’s strike with what's nearly ease.

 

Stain growls. “You’re serious,” he accuses. “You can’t be serious.”

 

Izuku stands above Iida, a protective wall between him and Stain. “You call yourself a vigilante,” Izuku accuses right back. He slides into a loose fighting stance. “How does this fit into your vision?”

 

Stain scowls. “They’re all fakes!” he spits, fingers flexing over his weapons. “Fake heroes! All they want is money or fame or revenge. They’re all corrupt.”

 

Stain throws himself at Izuku—no, Native.

 

Izuku struggles to catch up in time, has to pull Stain off-course so they meet head-to-head. In a flurry, Stain lashes out with at least two weapons. Izuku dodges them both but one strike nicks his costume.

 

Izuku takes a step back and holds up a hand. He relaxes, minutely, stands up straighter and says, "Wait."

 

- - -

 

Chizome isn’t sure why, exactly, he pauses. Maybe it’s the immense authority this boy carries—like he’s years older, like he’s the most powerful person in the room, like he's holding back. Maybe it’s Shigaraki’s warning, still echoing around Chizome’s head—a fucking roadblock... his CR’s too high.

 

He’s curious, Chizome thinks, as he stills, raises an eyebrow, and tilts his head in a universal message of go on.

 

Midoriya continues, “You’re trying to tell me Iida-kun is a fake hero?”

 

“Of course,” Chizome hisses. The boy wasn’t here to save, or even protect, Native. He cared only about revenge.

 

“So,” Midoriya starts with a haughty condescension that reminds Chizome of his mother, “this fifteen year-old is old and mature enough to already have failed at being a hero? What’s the cut-off, then? Do you go around killing three year-olds who steal each other’s toys? Or babies who cry too loud?”

 

The accusation punches Chizome in the gut. He yells, “What? No!” before he can register the words leaving his mouth.

 

Of course not. He kills fake heroes—the corrupt—the evil—those who deserve it.

 

“No?” Midoriya continues with an insidious toxicity that makes Chizome’s stomach churn. “You’re confusing me. It’s okay to kill a teenager, who isn’t an adult yet, but not a child? Why?”

 

Because, “He’s a hero student,” Chizome insists.

 

“Yes.” Midoriya draws out the word like he’s talking to a toddler. “He is. He’s a student. Do you know what that means? It means he hasn’t finished training yet. It means he isn’t a hero yet. So, tell me, Stain the Hero Killer—how can someone who isn’t even a hero be a fake hero?”

 

Sweat soaks through Chizome’s skin. He adjusts his grip on his katanas.

 

He’s doing the right thing.

 

He hasn’t felt this tense since he became Stain. Fear eats away at him, quietly—a fear not for his life, but for his righteousness.

 

He’s doing the right thing.

 

He cannot question himself. If he questions himself this will have all been for nothing.

 

He’s doing the right thing.

 

“Well?” the boy asks and Chizome snaps. He sinks into a low fighting stance and snarls.

 

He needs to see this through. He needs to kill the fakes. He needs to do the right thing. It's all he has left.

 

Before he can throw himself at one of the fakes, he’s enveloped in heat.

 

- - -

 

“Shouto,” Izuku exhales quietly. They make eye contact across the flames.

 

In the presence of Shouto, Izuku feels more like himself. He lets out the breath he’s been holding, lets go of the toxic condescension that had begun eating him alive.

 

His own words echo across his memory, except he sounds exactly like his father.

 

He hates it.

 

“Izuku,” Shouto says. He looks the most worried Izuku’s ever seen him—eyebrows furrowed with a bright yellow tainting his aura.

 

Stain throws himself at Shouto.

 

Izuku doesn’t think when he pulls Stain towards him instead, doesn't even recall making the conscious decision to do so. But as Stain is hurtling towards Izuku, Stain smirks—that’s what I thought—and then a dagger sinks into Izuku’s arm.

 

Izuku prepares for another attack as Stain hurtles towards him, but instead Stain rips the dagger out of Izuku's arm and in one fluid moment, drags it across his tongue.

 

Izuku has just enough time to question why, to theorize that it must have something to do with his quirk, to remember Iida yelling the blood—when he licks it—

 

Izuku collapses to the ground. He doesn’t feel the impact, but hears it. He moves to stand up but

 

He can’t move. He can’t move. He can’t feel anything. He can’t move. Can’t move anything.

 

He’s stuck. Hecan’tmove.He’strapped.Ohgod,thisisbad. Hecan’t breathe. He gasps for air but can’t find any. His throat isn’t working. His lungs aren’t working. The door is locked he locked it even though he doesn’t have the key he’s trapped. He can’t get out.

 

He can't get out he’s sorry so sorry it won’t happen again.

 

Please, Father, let me out.

 

- - -

 

“I’m sorry,” Izuku begs from the ground. He hasn’t moved since he dropped. “So sorry. It won’t happen again.”

 

A gut wrenching nausea overwhelms Shouto. The words take him back to his house—to the kitchen—to the gym. He’s said those words too many times before. He’s heard his mom and Fuyumi say those words too many times.

 

“Please,” Izuku cries, and something inside Shouto shatters. “Father, let me out.” Shouto swallows down bile. His heart stops, speeds up, pounds against his chest like it’s trying to get out. He can’t breathe but he’s breathing too much.

 

Shouto gets the urge to kill himself just long enough to twist it into the visceral desire to murder Izuku’s father. Izuku’s father is not in his vicinity, but Stain is.

 

Shouto doesn’t hesitate. He thrusts thick spikes of ice at Stain.

 

Stain dodges with a feral grace—the moves of a man experienced in surviving.

 

But Shouto, too, is experienced in surviving.

 

Shouto aims a spike straight at Stain's chest. Stain blocks it with the flat side of his katana. The sword shatters against the impact, but successfully blocks the ice.

 

“Are you trying to kill me?!” Stain exclaims. “You fake.”

 

“Get out of here!” Iida yells, reminding Shouto that he’s still here.

 

Shouto does not have time for this. He throws out a thin wall of scalding white-hot fire between him and Stain, giving Shouto just enough time to tell Iida, “Don’t disrespect Izuku. He’s risking his life to save yours.”

 

Stain cuts through the wall and bursts through.

 

Shouto yells at Iida, “Finish what you started!"

 

- - -

 

What do you... can’t fix it? a quiet voice whispers—so quiet Izuku can only barely make out words—so quiet Izuku isn’t sure he didn’t just think it. It’s familiar in an unfamiliar way. Like he’s looking at the palm of his hand for the first time.

 

It’s not...

 

He can still see the oranging sky, can still make out the sounds of a fight, but it all feels far away—slow. But the voices get closer, clearer.

 

Izuku. This voice is even more familiar, comforting like a cup of hot chocolate on a rainy day. Izuku, honey.

 

Pull reaches out and tugs delicately at Stain, like it's testing the connection.

 

You need to move, kiddo.

 

He can’t feel his muscles but he can feel Regeneration jumping uselessly over his body.

 

IZUKU!

 

Light flashes. Everything goes silent. When Izuku can see again, there’s a face just inches above his own. His eyes meet mirrored green ones—a young woman with full green hair looks down at him.

 

She smiles and chokes back a sob. “Izuku, honey,” she whispers. “I love you so much.”

 

She slowly morphs into someone else—a young boy with no hair and grey eyes. Izuku knows he’s never seen the boy before, but he still recognizes him. “I’m sorry,” the boy says as Regeneration runs through his body. “I can’t help you with this one.”

 

The boy’s face morphs back into the woman’s, back into someone else, back into everyone at once. You need to move, eleven voices say. The sound reverberates throughout his skull, his skin, his body. You need to move. And then arms reach out, caress him, hug him, and lift him up to his feet.

 

He becomes aware of the world with the realization that he’d always been aware of it. Shouto is barely holding off Stain, Iida and Native are still on the ground, everything is too hot and too cold. Izuku grabs onto Stain with Pull, and Empathy, and Regeneration, and One for All.

 

Stain freezes, eyes wide, and Izuku knows he’s afraid, can almost hear Stain’s whispering thoughts of what the fuck is happening. Izuku knows that Stain’s left wrist is sprained, that he has a mild concussion, that scar tissue is building up along his skin, that he truly believes he’s doing the right thing.

 

And then Stain passes out.

 

- - -

 

The paralysis leaves Tenya’s body like it was never there. As Stain collapses to the ground, Tenya jumps up to his feet.

 

He watches Stain with an apprehensive silence, prepared to fight at any moment. After a terrifying minute, Todoroki drops his quirk. It’s only then that Tenya lets himself relax.

 

He doesn’t understand how Stain was defeated. He doesn’t understand how Midoriya stood up so quickly. So, Tenya asks, “What happened?”

 

Todoroki’s expression doesn’t change, but Tenya still gets the feeling he’s being glared at.

 

Midoriya glows a green which sometimes looks yellow or red, and he answers, “Are you both alright?” He sounds far away.

 

“Yes,” Todoroki answers simply.

 

Tenya isn’t sure he is so he says nothing.

 

Another long pause rattles Tenya’s hackles. He feels like they’re waiting for something. He just isn’t sure what.

 

He’s still so confused, feels like he missed something.

 

And then, without preamble, Midoriya stops glowing. He turns to Tenya, makes eye contact for the first time, and smiles. It’s only a tad comforting.

 

“I’ll restrain Stain,” Midoriya says, pressing a button on his belt and pulling out a rope. “Will one of you check on Native, please?”

 

“Of course,” Tenya answers as he and Todoroki both walk towards Native.

 

Todoroki leans against the wall next to Native, not taking his eyes off Stain. Or maybe Midoriya.

 

Tenya crouches down to check Native over. He’s unconscious, has a few cuts and, probably, a sprained ankle. But he’ll be fine.

 

“Don’t tell anyone what Izuku said,” Todoroki suddenly says.

 

Tenya blinks up at him. “What do you mean?”

 

“When he dropped. Don’t tell anyone what he said after Stain cut him.”

 

Izuku’s words echo throughout Tenya’s head without his permission. No matter how much he wants to, Tenya won’t ever be able to forget it.

 

He needs to tell someone—some adult in authority. His plan is to, once this is all cleared up, tell Aizawa. It’s the logical thing to do—the right thing.

 

He can’t just ignore it.

 

“Why?” Tenya asks, because Todoroki must have some reason. He trusts that Todoroki, of all people, has a reason.

 

Todoroki finally looks at him, makes eye contact in a clear message that this is important. “He’d get in trouble,” he says simply.

 

Tenya frowns. Aizawa would not punish Midoriya—he has no reason to. Tenya’s positive Aizawa would help him—that’s his job as a teacher—as a hero.

 

Todoroki stares at him for another moment before clarifying, “You’d endanger him with his father.”

 

Tenya does not understand, but there’s a heaviness to Todoroki’s words and a weight behind his eyes. Todoroki speaks with a powerful confidence that makes Tenya believe him. Tenya trusts that Todoroki is speaking the truth—or at least what he believes to be the truth. He may not understand, but he trusts that Todoroki does. And, after today, Tenya feels like he owes Todoroki his trust—or that Todoroki's earned it. Either way, Tenya trusts Todoroki.

 

“Okay,” Tenya says as he stands up. “I won’t,” he promises.

 

And then sirens careen into the alleyway.

 

- - -

 

An officer exits the police car with a rushed hurry. She’s already sweating—anxious in a way that makes Shouto tense.

 

“What’s going on here?” she asks, eyes moving quickly over the scene.

 

Izuku doesn’t move from his guard next to Stain, but he still shoots the woman a smile. “We were attacked by The Hero Killer, Stain,” he says like it's no big deal. “We knocked him out and restrained him.”

 

The officer lets out a short, sharp laugh that rises Shotuo’s hackles. Immediately he’s on the defensive, quirk at the ready.

 

In the resulting silence, the officer’s condescending smile drops. She stares at Stain. After too long, her eyes widen and her mouth makes a silent oh. She rips out her radio and calls out codes Shouto doesn’t understand.

 

She collects their names and insists Izuku distance himself from Stain. None of them say anything more than necessary, even though Shouto is pretty sure they should be getting their stories straight. Knowing Izuku, Shouto has no idea what Izuku will be telling the detectives. Worse, Shouto doesn't trust Iida to follow Izuku's lead.

 

It takes less than a minute for two ambulances, three police cruisers, four heroes, and Endeavor to arrive.

 

Before Native can be hauled away in an ambulance—before Endeavor can publicly chastise Shouto—before any of them can be questioned by Detective Tsukauchi—a nomu hurtles down through the crowd.

 

Just as quickly as it appeared, it drops. And it's only as Izuku tumbles to the ground that Shouto realizes he'd been grabbed. At the last moment, the nomu picks itself back up and flies off.

 

A heavy, dangerous silence fills the air, a tension so thick Shouto can’t move. He has no idea what it is until Stain spits a glob of blood onto the ground. He stands in the middle of the road, inbetween the heroes and Izuku. “The idiots have come out, huh?” Stain says. Each word is the cut of a knife, each syllable hits Shouto’s fight-or-flight response but he can’t do anything other than freeze. He has to quiet his breathing because he’s afraid of drawing any attention to himself.

 

Danger, his body is telling him, his every instinct is screaming. You’re going to die here if you aren’t careful.

 

“You fakes,” Stain spits. His hands flex into fists. “I must make things right—create a just society. I will take back what it means to be a hero!” Stain yells.

 

Stain may as well have activated his quirk on everyone in the vicinity. Even Endeavor stands stock still and pale faced.

 

“Come!” Stain yells. He takes a step forward. “Try and get me, you fakes!”

 

Nobody moves. Nobody can move, even though they all know they should, they have to. Someone has to take down Stain but no one can, They’re too afraid.

 

But then Izuku walks forward, casually, like Stain isn’t paralyzing everyone with his presence alone. Shouto wants to reach out and stop him but he can’t. Izuku keeps going, walks straight up to Stain until they’re toe-to-toe, face-to-face.

 

“Stain,” Izuku says like a death sentence. He flashes green—a light so bright it threatens to blind Shouto. “Stop talking.”

 

Stain’s smirk betrays his fear. “He was right about you.”

 

Izuku slowly reaches out towards Stain, obviously broadcasting his every motion. “You are not a vigilante, child killer.” He gently taps Stain on the chest. The man falls backward, unconscious—except he keeps falling through the ground. A dark puddle swallows him up and disappears inside itself.

 

Izuku turns around slowly. Rainbow light radiates off him in waves powerful enough to knock Shouto off his feet. He’s filled with more emotions than he can identify—fear, anger, confidence, anxiety, sadness...

 

Laying on the ground, Shouto feels dangerously vulnerable—like Izuku could kill him without a second thought—like every thought Shouto’s ever had is leaking out through his skin—like he’s lost every secret he’s ever kept.

 

Shouto thinks with Izuku’s voice—a voice more threatening and grim than Izuku's ever actually used—A real hero would never hurt a child.

 

Shouto knows, despite the fact that all he can see is a swirl of colors, that Izuku is staring directly at Endeavor.

 

Then the tie-dyed haze disappears and Shouto can breathe again.

Chapter Text

Laughter grates at Chizome’s ears, pokes goosebumps atop his skin. It has him on edge; he throws his limbs out blindly except he can’t feel them. He can’t feel anything save a quiet pain itching across his scalp.

 

The laughter rises in pitch and volume. A too-hot breath against his ear officially jolts Chizome into awakened awareness.

 

Where is he?

 

The ceiling is moving—or—no—he’s moving. Someone is dragging him across the floor—by his hair. Pulling strands out of his scalp.

 

Chizome growls, “Get off—let go—I’ll kill you,” in between heavy breaths.

 

The laugh sputters off, but sick humour remains in the silence.

 

“You broke the rules, cheater,” Shigaraki fucking Tomura sneers, tightening his grip on Chizome’s hair. “You’re not allowed to break the rules.”

 

He drags Chizome over the ground without care but with an excited speed. Shigaraki lets out a single, sharp, high-pitched laugh. “Sensei’s gonna kill you!” he exclaims like he just got the best birthday present ever.

 

Chizome has never seriously feared for his life before this.

 

He doesn’t want to die. More than anything. More than his desire to fix the world, he doesn’t want to die.

 

Shigaraki sing-songs, “He’s gonna kill you!”

 

The ceiling is crumbling, dripping drywall like it’s seen too much Shigaraki. Bright lights flicker across wood walls. Chizome counts eleven doors then loses track. Despite the persistent smell of dust and death and rot, the place is disturbingly clean.

 

Shigaraki drops Chizome’s head and he hits the ground like a sack of bricks. His ears scream with a high-pitched ring. He feels like he was dumped overboard. Dizziness clouds his vision.

 

A door opens, far away. Through layers of water Shigaraki whispers, “Welcome to your epilogue, Stain the Child Killer.” And then Chizome is kicked halfway across Japan.

 

He isn’t sure where he is anymore. His vision keeps waning out, but never back in.

 

He’s dying. Or maybe he’s already dead.

 

He grasps for something to ground him, but even the sharp soreness of his scalp is out of reach.

 

He’s tired. So tired. A small part of him is relieved to be dead. He can pause, now, take a break. Hopefully someone will pick up his mantle and fix the world in his place.

 

He just wants to sleep.

 

 

 

 

 

“I don’t appreciate it when people disobey me, Akaguro Chizome.”

 

For a fleeting moment, Chizome is sure he’s in hell and that this is the voice of the devil. But then he becomes aware of the incessant beeping of hospital equipment, the sharp smell of antiseptic, and the too-bright white of LEDs beating against his eyelids.

 

He opens his eyes to a hospital room—white walls lined with complicated, expensive machines Chizome can’t identify. Cthulhu wires lead into a hospital bed that sits in the center of the room like a throne. The outline of a suit is barely visible beneath the thick quilt of wires and equipment. And beneath that, lies a man.

 

“You violated my trust, Chizome,” the man says. Sensei, Shigaraki had called him. Whatever the fuck that means.

 

His voice echoes across the walls. Though he speaks with a casual, even cadence, the voice is loud enough to penetrate Chizome’s temples. His effortless tone tells Chizome, without a doubt, that Sensei could kill him at any moment.

 

“Tell me, Chizome,” Sensei starts. Every syllable is a threat, weighs Chizome down, steals the air from his lungs. “Why I should not kill you, here and now.”

 

His heart stops. Like a mouse in front of a nuclear bomb, Chizome is intimately aware that he does not stand a chance.

 

But the nuclear bomb just offered up an off switch, and Chizome is no idiot.

 

He knows nothing of this man—of Sensei—does not know his values or mission or desires. Does not know what would convince him to let Chizome go. But Chizome broke a rule—what rule? He was given free reign of Hosu. Shigaraki just said The League would cause some chaos whilst he killed Native. Simple. Stain knew only what was necessary.

 

It’s against the rules, he remembers Shigaraki whining, we’re not allowed to kill kids, Stain the Child Killer.

 

“I didn’t,” Chizome whispers instantly. His heart stutters. “I didn’t kill anyone—any kids. I didn’t.”

 

“No, but you would have...” Sensei declares. “I do not hand out second chances to just anyone.”

 

Chizome’s heart stops. This isn’t working. He’s going to die. He doesn’t want to die. He can’t.

 

Desperate, Chizome yells, “Why do you care about some kids, anyway?!”

 

“I don't,” Sensei answers instantly; Chizome has no choice but to believe him. The bright lights shine off Sensei's toothy smile until it’s all Chizome can see. With a dejavu familiarity, that smile portrays more hostility than happiness. “I do not care about some kids.”

 

What does that even mean? Why—Chizome refuses to believe these villains have morals. That the dissolve it all to dust villains want to protect children. So why? Why the fuck do they care?

 

Some kids.

 

He doesn’t care about some kids.

 

Sensei’s smile widens.

 

It’s Midoriya Izuku’s smile.

 

It’s Midoriya Izuku’s smile.

 

Oh god he has Midoriya Izuku’s smile. Midoriya Izuku has his smile.

 

But—how—that doesn’t—

 

Midoriya’s the closest thing to a true hero Chizome’s seen since All Might, despite—or maybe even because of—his brutal, unorthodox methods.

 

He doesn’t want to—can’t believe that the bunny rabbit that scared Shigaraki Tomura is—

 

some kids

 

Chizome throws up. A man reaching for an olive branch but instead grabbing the noose, he mutters, “He’s your—you’re his—”

 

 

- - -

 

 

Through the monitor, Sensei asks, “How are you going to take advantage of this situation, Tomura?”

 

Tomura really wants to impale Stain’s head on a stake and plant it in front of the bar, but he’s pretty sure Sensei would not approve.

 

He nudges Stain’s dead body with his foot. Unfortunately, it’s still in one piece, despite Tomura’s desire to obliterate it.

 

Tomura has no idea what he’s supposed to fucking do, now—what Sensei wants him to do. Buzzwords pop into his head—reputation, co-opt, recruitment—but he can’t form them into a single thought, let alone a coherent plan.

 

He has no idea but he can’t just say that. I don’t know is not an answer.

 

The point of all this was to start a party. They’re entering phase two of the game, co-op mode.

 

Tomura scratches at his wrist.

 

He does not want to work with others—refuses to rely on anybody—but that’s why he’s the leader, right? This isn’t cooperation, this is a dictatorship. Yeah, Tomura can work with that. He’ll be the commander to the foot soldiers, the king to the peasants, the boss to the minion.

 

After all, he’s the leader of The League of Villains.

 

Tomura breaks open his skin and says, “We need to start building our party.”

 

Silence fills the moment until Sensei prompts, “What’s your next step?”

 

Tomura stares at Stain’s dead body. He doesn’t know. Reach out to Giran, maybe? Put an ad on Herolist? Stick up flyers in the bad parts of town?

 

It all sounds so stupid, so meandering, so boring.

 

Stain’s body stares back at him, forever frozen with a face of condescending judgement.

 

He needs to take advantage of this situation. He needs to take advantage of Stain, of Stain’s following, of Stain’s dead body.

 

Tomura nudges the body with his foot. “With this,” he says with false conviction. Maybe if he sounds confident enough, Sensei will trust that he has a plan.

 

This feels like the perfect time for a cutscene—the last line in a movie before the time jump. It sounds like a two-word summary of a legitimate plan.

 

Tomura waits for the cut, waits for the monitor to click off and the scene to end.

 

But then Sensei asks, “How?”

 

How? Tomura digs his nails into his flesh. How? He doesn’t know. Threaten someone? Ransom note? Display the body like he’s a Hannibal villain?

 

His eyes bounce around the room. He stops breathing. He’s going to get it wrong. He doesn’t know the right answer.

 

He doesn’t want to be sent to Australia again. He can’t lose his quirk again.

 

He really should have eaten something earlier today.

 

Tomura makes eye contact with Kurogiri, or at least what he hopes to be eye contact. Kurogiri’s face is as vague as his personality.

 

Kurogiri pulls out his phone.

 

Tomura can’t be punished again.

 

“My apologies,” Kurogiri begins. “Giran says he has a time-sensitive message for you, Sensei.”

 

The silence is the lethal lifting of a guillotine.

 

“Apology accepted, Kurogiri,” Sensei says. “Tomura, I expect you to present an executable plan next we meet.”

 

 

 
Notes:

    This is sorta a filler chapter but it was a lot of fun to write so :)

    Also, the scene where Shigaraki is all "he's gonna kill you" was highly inspired by this scene of S1E1 of Legion: https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/82207eaa-76c5-4020-8135-7e67e04ebe2f

Chapter Text

Izuku hasn’t woken up since passing out right after his speech, so for the last hour, Shouto and Iida have sat in silence. The hospital room is too big for the three of them, but Shouto’s just glad he’s in the same room as Izuku. He isn’t sure what he would’ve done if someone had tried to separate them.

 

Shouto’s kept himself occupied by reading the scrolling headlines on the silenced television. Every headline is practically the same—Stain: The Vigilante, Martyr Stain sheds light on hero corruption, Vigilante Stain on corruption in the hero commission.

 

And yet, somehow, not one of them mentions Midoriya Izuku. Someone managed to get video of Stain’s speech, but cut it off right before Izuku shows up. Or, for some sick reason, every reporter refuses to show Izuku’s speech.

 

Shouto’s gut burns with an uncomfortable tension—like he needs to throw up but hasn’t eaten anything solid in the past 24 hours—a sensation he’s much too familiar with.

 

The entire world needs to know that a real hero would never hurt a child. Those words will never leave Shouto—he’ll never forget them. Even now, against the beeping backdrop of Izuku's heart rate, he can hear them.

 

A real hero would never hurt a child.

 

A real hero would never hurt a child and yet every reporter is still calling Stain a vigilante.

 

For the first time, Shouto seriously considers using his position as son of the number two hero to get himself on air.

 

The bright hospital lights flicker once—just enough for Shouto to panic and prepare for the worst. The lights tint yellow and Shouto is afraid. Endeavor’s footsteps thunder against tile. He’s right outside the door. The room is too hot. Too yellow. Smoke itches at Shouto’s nose. It’s so hot. He’s so afraid—

 

But then Iida says, “Good morning,” and everything is fine. The spell, whatever the fuck it was, is broken. Midoriya Izuku is awake and smiling. As the room dims back to its natural white lighting, Shouto relaxes.

 

For the first time since Shouto got Izuku’s text, he can seriously relax.

 

Izuku is halfway through saying a familiar, “Good morning,” when the door opens and a nurse walks in.

 

“You’re up! How are you feeling?” she asks Izuku, and then proceeds to ask him more pointless questions—pointless because Izuku only knows one answer. Izuku could be half-dead and still convince a professional doctor that he’s fine.

 

The nurse attests that Izuku is perfectly healthy, save some exhaustion.

 

Shouto almost asks the nurse if this diagnosis of health extends to Izuku’s mental state, but, of course, he doesn’t.

 

She then requests that Izuku take it easy for the next week, which is just as pointless as asking him how he is.

 

Iida and Shouto have already been cleared—they both got away with a few sprains and bruises—Shouto’s gotten worse injuries from training—but she checks in on them anyway.

 

As she’s leaving the room, she says, “The police are eager to ask you all some questions. I’m going to send them in, if that’s alright.”

 

She doesn’t wait for an answer. Before the door can completely close, it opens. Two people walk in—a detective Shouto recognizes from USJ and an individual who can only be the police chief, based on his clothing.

 

The police chief displays his badge and announces, “I’m the chief of the police force, Tsuragamae Kenji. Woof.”

 

“It’s a pleasure to meet you,” Izuku starts with that same tone he always has, perfected to sound like everything is fine. “I’m Midoriya Izuku, hero name Peacekeeper. This is Shouto and Tenya.”

 

Shouto acknowledges the chief’s nod with a sharp glare.

 

In a tone much too similar to Endeavor’s, the chief says, “To begin with, what you all did today was extremely irresponsible.”

 

Shouto bristles. Every one of his muscles freeze as he’s back in Endeavor’s gym. His quirk cocoons his bones, dances across his skin. He’s ready.

 

The chief continues, “You put yourselves and others in harm's way without consulting any adults. This was an extremely dangerous stunt, and the fact that you all made it out relatively safely was pure luck.”

 

Luck? Shouto lets out a snort. Luck? That wasn’t luck. That was Midoriya Izuku.

 

“Do you have something to say, Todoroki-kun?” the chief asks.

 

Shouto sharpens his glare and ice skims along the metal bed frame. He’s still deciding whether he’s going to flip off the officer or jump out the window when Iida speaks up, “I take full responsibility. Midoriya and Todoroki-kun did nothing wrong. They were just protecting me.”

 

The chief’s face doesn’t move and he says, “Midoriya-kun and Todoroki-kun should have contacted professional heroes, rather than attempting to handle the situation themselves.”

 

Shouto stops breathing. Every muscle in his body tenses like he’s preparing for a fight because he is. He doesn’t move from his seat but ice spreads from the bed frame along the floor. His hands are fists underneath the blanket and he’s going to do something with them but then Izuku sits up straighter, looks at the chief, and says, “You’re right, it’s all my fault.”

 

Shouto’s standing before he recognizes he’s moved. “Kenji,” he deadpans. The room freezes. He stares past the chief’s eyes. “Shut up.”

 

The chief’s fur stands on end. After a moment, the other detective chuckles. Iida throws out apologies and excuses like they're water and he's trying to set out a fire.

 

After too long, the detective places a hand on the chief’s arm and steps forward. “Alright, well it sounds like we’re all well aware this situation could have gone better, so let’s move on. I’d like someone to tell me what exactly happened, please.”

 

Iida opens his mouth but Shouto glares at him until it shuts. After a moment, Izuku expertly recalls the events. To Shouto’s knowledge, Izuku tells the truth, while omitting a few details—namely whatever the fuck happened when Stain used his quirk on Izuku.

 

The detective takes notes, looks pleasantly surprised, and the police chief says nothing more until the questioning has finished.

 

“Now,” the chief starts, “we will refrain from pursuing charges of vigilantism and illegal quirk usage if you all agree not to disclose the details of these events.” He pulls a few pieces of paper out of his briefcase and hands them out. The chief continues, “We will tell the media that Endeavor—”

 

Shouto can’t help it. The bed frame shatters. The police chief opens his mouth, closes it, sighs, and continues, “—resolved the situation.”

 

Iida nods like this all makes sense. Izuku frowns, but doesn’t say anything. Shouto wants to say something—wants to punch too many people in the face—but he doesn’t.

 

 

They all sign the documents, the officers leave, and shortly after a nurse informs them they’re all discharged. Iida is promptly collected by Ingenium, who spends nearly half an hour profusely thanking Izuku and Shouto.

 

And then Izuku and Shouto are alone in a hospital room. Again.

 

Neither of them say anything, which is perfectly fine with Shouto. The shared silence is comforting, and he’ll sit in it for as long as he can. He doesn’t want to go home. And, more than that, he doesn’t want Izuku to go home.

 

Alongside the memory of Izuku’s a real hero would never hurt a child lies Father, please, let me out. Shouto won’t ever forget that, either, and he vows to do everything that he can’t do to Endeavor to Midoriya-senior.

 

When the door opens, Shouto fears it’s someone coming to kick them out and he begins drafting excuses and lies that would be much more effective coming from Izuku.

 

Instead, Aizawa ambles in, looking exactly as he always does. He stares at Izuku and Shouto for a moment before deflating with a long sigh. He says, “I’m proud of you both.” And then he walks back out.

 

- - -

 

Mirai is a creature of habit. It is one of his greatest strengths and one of his greatest weaknesses. Every weekday, at seven a.m. sharp, he arrives at work.

 

It is six fifty-five when a needle breaks his skin, a bag is shoved over his head, and the unfortunately familiar voice of Nedzu says, “What did the electrician say to calm himself down? Ohmmmmmm.”

 

- - -

 

Mirai awakens to the smell of sweat, blood, and tea. Without the blood. He’s sitting on a surprisingly comfortable couch and staring directly at Toshinori.

 

“You’re probably wondering why I’ve gathered you all here, today,” Nedzu says.

 

Mirai replies, instead, “You mean kidnapped?"

 

Nedzu just smiles, takes a sip of tea, and casually says, “I am 87.216 percent positive that All for One is alive.”

 

Toshinori looks away, like he already knew this but refused to admit it to himself.

 

Mirai just says, “No shit.”

 

Naomasa, who’s sitting to Mirai's right, continues, “We believe he is working with the League of Villains or, more accurately, that the League of Villains is working for him.”

 

“So,” Mirai starts. He makes eye contact with Toshinori, which is just as hard as it sounds. “What are you going to do about it?”

 

Toshinori flinches, coughs, and leans forward until he’s half his size. “I was hoping I wouldn’t have to do this, especially not so soon... but... I’m going to tell Izuku.”

 

- - -

 

Father says nothing about the fight with Stain, which is infinitely worse.

 

Izuku refuses to bring it up even though the waiting is torture. At dinner, they manage to discuss his internship without broaching Stain. Izuku discusses his newfound understanding of One for All, without once bringing up the eleven voices he heard. It all goes relatively well, but Izuku knows better than to relax.

 

As Izuku finishes cleaning up from dinner, Father says, "Come. Sit with me," and pats the couch.

 

Izuku puts away the last dish and sits down next to his father. He casually asks, “What’s up?” despite the heavy beating of his heart.

 

Father says, “I’ve been meaning to do this since the Sports Festival—” and Izuku’s heart stops. He fixes a smile over his terror and tries not to think. Father continues, “How would you like a new quirk?”

 

He doesn’t. He doesn’t want a new quirk. He’s just started understanding One for All, still isn’t comfortable with Empathy, doesn’t yet know the new range and limits of Pull. He doesn’t want a new quirk but his father is already extending his hand. He doesn’t want a new quirk but he doesn’t have a choice.

 

Izuku takes Father’s hand. A sharp pain skitters past his skin and into his bones. He doesn’t recognize it—it’s a quirk he’s never had before. Like always, that means he knows nothing about it—what it does, how it activates.

 

An anxiety settles in his stomach but Izuku still says, “Thank you, Father. Which one did you give me?”

 

Father just smiles.

Chapter Text

Izuku is incredibly relieved to be back in classes. While his experience with Gran Torino (and Stain) were invaluable, there’s just something... comforting about this classroom. He can relax--honestly relax--here, and he thinks this might be where he feels safest.

 

The underlying chatter of his classmates threatens to lull him to sleep, but Izuku manages to stay awake in time for Aizawa to step into the classroom. The moment the door closes behind him, the room is already silent, and Aizawa immediately begins, “The next time you encounter a villain, you are to do the following.” He picks up a piece of chalk and starts inscribing on the board as he speaks. “One, run away. Once you are relatively safe, contact a hero or the police. You all have my phone number. If running away is not possible, you will be permitted to use your quirks in a defensive manner. If you believe you, a peer, or a civilian are in lethal danger, you will be permitted to protect yourself and them using any means necessary. If anyone tells you otherwise, refer them to me or Nedzu.”

 

Izuku wants to ask where a defensive strategy of verbal de-escalation fits into this, but he supposes that counts under “permitted to use your quirks in a defensive manner” and "any means necessary". After all, from a legal standpoint, it would be better for them not to use their quirks.

 

Aizawa continues, “Your first priority is your own safety. Your second priority is the safety of your peers. Your third priority is the safety of any civilian bystanders. Under no circumstance are you to prioritize the safety of a pro hero, police officer, or other professional. It is their job to protect you, not the other way round.”

 

Izuku frowns, but takes notes without complaint. My first priority is my own safety feels foreign to his fingertips--aren’t heroes supposed to prioritize others?

 

“You will be quizzed on this in forty-eight hours. If any of you violate these policies, there will be repercussions. I will consider expulsion if I do not believe you can comply. Questions.”

 

Kaminari raises his hand to ask, “Does this have anything to do with Stain?”

 

“Yes,” Aizawa answers. After a moment, he erases the board and says, “In about four weeks, we will be participating in a month-long training camp with Class 1-B. This will take place off-site. You must bring the following items with you or you will be unable to participate and will fail this grade.” He passes out a sheet of paper detailing everything they need.

 

Izuku skims it. He has almost everything, but there are a couple things he'll need to buy.

 

“Sir?” Iida asks. “What about final exams?”

 

“Due to the unique circumstances of this semester, general written exams will take place shortly before the summer camp. If you fail any test you will spend all your free time at the camp doing remedial studies. Your hero course practical exam will occur at the conclusion of the camp. More information will become available closer to the start of the camp, so I will not take any further questions.” Three hands fall from the air. “Do whatever you want for the rest of the period. Quietly.” Aizawa drops to the floor, wraps himself in his sleeping bag, and passes out.

 

- - -

 

As the last class of the day comes to a close, Shouto debates what he’ll do this time to procrastinate going back to Endeavor’s house. While incredibly boring, he could loiter around the school library doing homework. The last time he did that, he accidentally got the whole week’s homework done in one sitting. Which was pretty nice until he realized he’d lost that excuse to stay out.

 

Uraraka skips over to Izuku’s desk, followed shortly behind by Iida. “Let’s go shopping!” Uraraka tells Izuku as she bounces from one foot to the other. “For the summer camp!”

 

Shouto doesn’t want to spend any amount of time with two of his loudest classmates, but if Izuku were to go, Shouto would consider following along. Just so he doesn’t have to go home yet, obviously.

 

“Yes,” Iida continues. He pushes up his glasses and shows off the paper Aizawa handed out earlier. “We already have a list.”

 

“Alrighty!” Izuku answers with a smile. “Let me just check-in with my father.”

 

Shouto senses movement behind him and turns towards it. Yaoyorozu smiles down at him before asking the others, “Can we join?”

 

Immediately, Uraraka and Iida answer, “Of course!”

 

Shouto just blinks.

 

Inbetween him and Izuku, Shinsou stands up, shoves in earbuds, and pushes past Uraraka. She lightly grabs his wrist and insists, “Shinsou-kun! Come with us.”

 

Shinsou immediately shakes her off, says, “No,” and stalks off.

 

Izuku watches Shinsou go with a small frown, and Shouto is back in that alleyway, where Izuku is sobbing I'm sorry. I so sorry. Please, Father.

 

Shouto jerks up to his feet. He refuses to let Izuku be sad again. He promises--not while he can help it--Shouto will do whatever he needs to make sure Izuku is never sad again. He grabs his backpack and starts walking after Shinsou.

 

Izuku interrupts him with, “Shouto, are you coming?”

 

Shouto barely pauses to ask, “Are you?”

 

“Yup!”

 

“Then yes,” he answers before walking out the door.

 

Shinsou is just turning the corner when Shouto calls out, “Come with us.”

 

Shinsou pauses, turns around just enough to glare, and spits, “Why the fuck would I do that?”

 

Shouto pulls his father’s credit card out of his wallet and holds it up. “I’m paying.”

 

- - -

 

As they’re waiting at the bus station, Iida and Yaoyorozu plan out the optimized route through the mall. Uraraka occasionally interjects with thoughts, opinions, and places she wants to go.

 

Izuku is incredibly relieved when Shouto and Shinsou catch up with them in time to make the bus. He lets out a breath he hadn’t been holding and smiles as he waves at them.

 

“Just to keep things clear,” Shinsou says, slouched ever-so-slightly with his hands in his pockets. He takes a moment to glare at each and every one of them. “We are not friends. We will never be friends. I’m only here because this guy--” he jerks his head towards Shouto, then bares his teeth in an unfriendly smile, “is my new sugar daddy.”

 

Uraraka lets out a sputter while Yaoyorozu’s eyes widen.

 

When Shouto deadpans, “I am too young to be your father,” Uraraka devolves into uncontrollable laughter.

 

Iida looks around, adjusts his glasses, and says, “I don’t understand. What’s a sugar daddy?”

 

Uraraka collapses against Yaoyorozu, who’s shaking in an attempt to stop herself from laughing.

 

Izuku smiles. He’s happy. He should be happy. He wants to be happy. But--but there's this tension in his stomach. It doesn't feel real. It can't last. None of them really care about him, they're just bringing him along out of obligation, or pity, or because he's useful to them in some way. He doesn't belong here.

 

Izuku joins in the laughter so he doesn’t cry and they all board the bus.

 

- - -

 

They’re only on store three out of eight and Hitoshi’s already exhausted. There’s just so much--so much talking, so much laughing, so much walking, looking, trying, buying. Even with his headphones in, blaring sweet silence, and lingering as far behind Todoroki as he can manage, Hitoshi can’t avoid the overwhelming stimulus.

 

He wants to go home but he doesn’t have a home so he stays. Plus, Todoroki was serious. He won't stop buying Hitoshi shit, which is pretty handy, but he refuses to stick to clearance, which is fucking ridiculous.

 

“I don’t need the newest model,” Hitoshi insists, putting the thermos back on the shelf. “Just get me this one.” He picks up a smaller, uglier one that’s less than half the price.

 

Todoroki doesn’t even acknowledge him and picks the newer one back up. “If we’re going to spend Endeavor’s money,” Todoroki states, “we’re going to spend it.”

 

He's got a point. Hitoshi feels no guilt stealing money from the Number Two Hero, Number One Asshole.

 

Midoriya steps up, takes one look at the thermos, and says, “Oh, that one’s the best! My father bought me one just a few weeks ago.”

 

Hitoshi sighs, defeated. Todoroki looks at him, and although his face doesn’t change at all, Hitoshi can still hear the silent told you so.

 

Midoriya frowns and looks over his shoulder. After a moment, he turns back and says, “I’m gonna use the restroom. I’ll be back shortly.”

 

Now that’s a good idea. Hitoshi should have thought of that earlier. That’s an easy way to get a break from socializing with a horde of teenagers.

 

Todoroki asks, “Should we come with you?” as if Hitoshi will suddenly do whatever he says.

 

Midoriya just smiles, waves, and says, “I’m good, thanks though."

 

- - -

 

Tomura fucking hates fetch quests.

 

It’s why he fails at most point-and-click games. He doesn’t have the attention span, nor the patience to go that long without violence.

 

Once, a few years back, Kurogiri got really tired of him destroying the bar, so suggested he played Stardew Valley.

 

Tomura would have murdered Kurogiri if Sensei had let him.

 

As Tomura stares up at the giant map that fails to show the important things, like where his enemies or the save point are, Tomura picks and pulls and tugs and scratches at the skin behind his ear.

 

This is so stupid.

 

Shigaraki Tomura does not go grocery shopping. He is a villain, the villain. But the only person who could ever convince him to go--Sensei, obviously--really, really likes tea. Which is why Tomura is desperately trying to find Timeless Delights so he can pick up the leaves or beans or whatever the fuck, finish the quest and get the fuck home.

 

There must be a cheat code to end this quest quickly, right? There’s always a cheat code. Maybe he could disintegrate some NPCs or pull the fire alarm or threaten someone into doing it for him. And he would—Shigaraki Tomura could and would do all those things, but Sensei said that this was a stealth mission. That Tomura could only win if he doesn’t get discovered and if he doesn’t make a scene.

 

The map isn’t helping so Tomura growls and storms off in a random direction. Well, more like sulks because storming would be too conspicuous. Luckily he’s played every single Assassin’s Creed game there is, so he knows a little something about going unnoticed. Even if it isn’t his style. At all.

 

Kurogiri did always make fun of Tomura for how he liked to play Assassin’s Creed--after all, if all the witnesses are dead, there aren’t any witnesses.

 

Tomura wanders in between NPCs with his hood up and his head down, scanning the storefronts for the stupid café.

 

Stain’s face stares out at him from behind glass--still alive and rendered on shirts, bags, phone cases--what the fuck. What the fuck did Stain do to warrant all the attention? He caused zero property damage. He killed zero civilians. He hurt a single hero and a couple snotty children.

 

The League destroyed a good twenty five percent of Hosu. Tomura can’t remember the other numbers, but there was a good amount of civilian deaths, injuries, property damage, and whatever. Stain—who is literally dead—does not deserve any of this. Tomura wishes he could have killed him with his own hands.

 

Tomura is holding a chunk of wall in his hand before he registers his quirk. The plaster dissolves between his fingertips, and then a too-familiar voice digs into the back of his shoulder blades as Midoriya Izuku says, “Shigaraki-san? Is that you?”

 

- - -

 

Izuku does not go to the bathroom. Instead, he detours towards the sphere of dark red. He takes a deep breath and reminds himself, these are not my emotions. He tries to picture an invisible wall between him and the aura, a bubble enclosing around the aura. These are not his emotions.

 

Izuku is expecting a robber or a disenfranchised employee or an abusive boss.

 

Izuku is not expecting Shigaraki Tomura, a dangerous villain and leader of The League, to be glaring at a tote bag like his quirk is laser eyes. Izuku  knows, probably better than anyone else how potentially dangerous Shigarkai's actual quirk is--it could, potentially, if trained and utilized correctly, destroy the entire mall before anyone could stop him.

 

The calm silence in the air feels entirely out of place, and Izuku can't help but wonder if this is the calm before the storm. Nothing has escalated. No one is panicking, no one is running away, no one has been hurt. Which means Izuku might be able to talk his way out of this one. Maybe he can stop whatever Shigaraki is planning before it happens. That’s his job, isn’t it? Peacekeeper?

 

Izuku only has the inklings of a plan when he cheerfully asks, “Shigaraki-san? Is that you?”

 

- - -

 

This can’t be happening. How is this legal?

 

Tomura’s just on a stupid side mission--a fucking fetch quest--how can a boss show up here? Now?

 

That’s against the fucking rules. Especially since the rules for this mission include don’t get notice and don’t stick out and don’t make a scene and how in hell is Tomura supposed to do all that with Midoriya fucking Izuku here?

 

This is absolutely the worst possible scenario. Because Tomura still isn’t allowed to kill kids and Midoriya is like the second-toughest boss after All Might.

 

But maybe--Tomura remembers Midoriya’s play style from the USJ, the sports festival, and what little he got to see of his fight with Stain (if you can call it a fight). The kid has a penchant for talking, which is--he hates to admit it--good for Tomura, because talking doesn’t get you noticed. Maybe Tomura will still be able to complete this mission.

 

“Midoriya Izuku,” Tomura hisses. He flexes his fingers once before grabbing onto the boy’s wrist and pulling him close. “Pretend we’re friends. Make a scene and I’ll kill the closest twelve NPCs before you can blink. Don’t test me.”

 

Midoriya looks up at him, confusion arching his eyebrows before he settles his face into a calm smile and says, much too cheerfully, “Okay!” He relaxes, stands next to Tomura with an impressive ease, and asks, “Where do you want to go? We could grab some tea.”

 

Tomura narrows his eyes. What is this, a game hint? Tomura’s rarely so lucky, but he won't look it into the mouse, or whatever that saying is. “Timeless Delights,” Tomura says. He lightly shoves Midoriya in a random direction. “You lead.”

 

And so Midoriya Izuku drags Tomura through the mall. Tomura tries to ignore the repeated faces of Stain in shop windows, but he can’t help growling at one or two or five of them. This is ridiculous. Stain didn’t even do anything! The League were the ones who destroyed nearly a fourth of Hosu!

 

Before Tomura knows it, Midoriya’s stopped in front of the tea shop. Thank goodness for skippable cutscenes. The shop is so small Tomura could dissolve it in less than a minute. It’s completely empty save for a lone NPC, who activates at the entrance of Tomura.

 

“What would you two like?” the NPC asks.

 

Midoriya says a lot of words that don’t mean anything then turns to Tomura. Tomura pulls out his quest details--Kurogiri wrote them on a post-it for him. “Uh... a pound of... white fujian loose tea...?”

 

“Make that two pounds!” Midoriya exclaims. Then to Tomura he says, “That’s my father’s favorite!”

 

“Fuck your father,” Tomura hisses reflexively.

 

“Anything else?” the barista asks.

 

“I’ll take a cup of your tuh-zan of the day. Sugar and milk, please,” Midoriya answers, even though Tarzan is definitely not a drink.

 

The NPC looks at Tomura for a moment before continuing its script. “Alrighty, that’ll be thirty seven and nineteen.”

 

Tomura scowls. Under his breath, Tomura hisses, “I don’t pay, I steal.” But this is a stealth mission! Mother fuck! He hates this so much.

 

Midoriya stares at him with a palpable disappointment that threatens to activate the boss music. Tomura is back at the bar, and it isn’t Midoriya but Sensei sighing and narrowing his eyebrows and shaking his head.

 

“Fine.” Tomura slaps a handful of bills onto the counter, grabs his bag of tea leaves, and drags Midoriya to the corner booth. They both sit on the same side, right next to each other, because Tomura refuses to let go of Midoriya’s wrist. They have a perfect view of the door, so Tomura will know the instance a hero or cop or one of Midoriya’s annoying little friends shows up.

 

- - -

 

Izuku’s been trying to figure it out, but he can’t make sense of it. Why is Shigaraki Tomura here? Now? This is a well-populated, high-profile location, but he doesn’t appear to have any plans of violence. He isn’t here to kill anyone, or incite chaos. Could he be here to recruit someone? Or buy something?

 

Izuku can’t make sense of it, so he works up the courage to ask, “What are you doing here?”

 

“I’m going to destroy the entire mall.”

 

Izuku almost laughs. “No you’re not.” If he was going to, he would have already.

 

“Yes I am!”

 

Izuku frowns, then stares at the small bag Shigaraki’s been protecting. Is that really tea? Izuku wasn't lying when he said it was his father's favorite, but he did buy a pound in case it isn't tea. “What’s that?” Drugs? Is something being smuggled through tea?

 

Shigaraki frowns, scoffs, and spits, “Tea, dumbass.” And he's telling the truth.

 

“You’re... grocery shopping?”

 

“No!” Shigaraki spits. “It’s a--very important quest--a fetch quest... yes, I’m fucking grocery shopping.”

 

He appears to be telling the truth, but, what are the chances of that? That Shigaraki Tomura just happens to go grocery shopping the same time Izuku and his friends are here? That can’t be a coincidence, can it?

 

Izuku shakes his head. A problem for another time. Right now, his priority is making sure Shigaraki leaves without hurting anybody.

 

“Then what do you want from me?” Izuku asks.

 

Shigaraki scowls, shoots a strong look of disgust at Izuku, and spits, “What do I--” he slams his jaw shut and scratches at his neck. After a moment, he drops his hand, sits and straighter, and makes eye contact.

 

There is a sharpness in Shigaraki’s eyes that Izuku hasn’t seen in over ten years, and a twist to his smile that Izuku sees nearly every day, in the mirror and across the dinner table.

 

Shigaraki says, “Tell me how to recruit more supporting characters into my league.”

 

Izuku isn’t thinking, or maybe he’s thinking too much, when he answers. Because he knows what happens when he doesn’t answer, and he can’t be grounded again. He can't.

 

This is not something Izuku has considered, explicitly, and yet the right answer finds his tongue. He knows The League, understands the psychology of villainy, and is familiar with forming allies.

 

“Based on the information I have access to, you have three options. One, pick up Stain’s mantle. Two, advertise the fact that you killed Stain. Or, three, claim you’re better than Stain.”

 

- - -

 

Tomura is not expecting a legitimate answer, and so he stares at Midoriya in silence for a moment--long enough for the boy to continue, “By picking up where Stain left off, you can recruit his followers and sympathizers. You might even want to frame Stain’s death on the heroes. On the other hand, advertising that you killed Stain would recruit villains who didn’t agree with or respect Stain--you could also use this route to threaten Stain’s followers into joining you. Claiming you’re better than Stain, for instance that you don’t try to kill children, could recruit both his sympathizers and enemies.”

 

What the fuck? Did Tomura accidentally unlock some cheat code?

 

No. Of course he didn’t. His life doesn’t work like that. This must be a trick, yeah--Midoriya’s trying to sabotage him by giving bullshit advice. That must be it.

 

But then, why does it sound so... correct?

 

Tomura doesn’t like this one bit.

 

He digs his fingernails into his thigh before leaning towards Midoriya and slamming his hand down onto the tabletop, cornering Midoriya. “What are you doing,” Tomura hisses.

 

Midoriya blinks, then smiles a wide thing that sends shivers across Tomura’s spine.

 

“Shigaraki-senpai,” Midoriya starts, effectively knocking Tomura off guard. “I'm helping you out. That’s what friends do.”

 

Tomura flinches backwards.

 

Pretend we’re friends.

 

Okay!

 

“That’s not--” Tomura tries to insist, but Midoriya’s smile is so real. “We’re not--”

 

- - -

 

Out of the corner of his eye, Izuku more feels it than sees it--familiar colors. The colors of his friends. They’re coming this way, towards them, towards Izuku and Shigaraki Tomura. Izuku chokes on a yellow panic. He feels like a child caught with a fork in the outlet, filled unanimously with a suffocating guilt. For a sharp moment it really sinks in, what’s happening, what this must look like to an outsider--but Shigaraki has four fingers on Izuku’s wrist and more hostages than Izuku can count.

 

Yes, Izuku didn’t have a choice. It's not his fault that he gave Shigaraki advice. He was threatened. He was trying to protect the hundreds of people in the mall. It was probably useless advice, anyway. He didn't have a choice.

 

But he has a choice now--a choice to let this turn into a potentially dangerous conflict or have everyone walk away like nothing happened.

 

“Do not be alarmed,” Izuku says calmly.

 

Shigaraki’s eyes widen and tightens his grip against Izuku’s wrist. “What is it,” he hisses.

 

“There is no threat to you. Everything is fine. A few of my friends are coming this way.”

 

Shigaraki growls.

 

“If you exit quietly, right now, I promise I will not tell anybody that you were here or what we discussed.” Izuku stares into Shigaraki’s eyes and twists his hand until he’s practically holding Shigaraki’s. “Nobody. Promise.”

 

Shigaraki lets out a long scoff from the back of his throat before he digs his fingernails into Izuku’s skin.

 

Izuku winces, even though it doesn't really hurt, not compared to everything else he's been through.

 

Shigaraki lets out a quiet yelp and rips his hand away, shaking it a little. “What was that,” he growls, looming over Izuku.

 

“What was what?”

 

“It--an electric shock--or it burned--I don’t fucking know, that’s why I’m asking you.”

 

Izuku holds his hands up in surrender. “I didn’t do anything. Promise. Trust me. We’re friends, right?”

 

Shigaraki growls and jerks towards Izuku until their faces are inches apart. “We’re not friends,” Shigaraki hisses. “I’m the predator and you’re the prey. I’m the protagonist and you’re some shitty little NPC. The only reason I haven’t killed you yet is because it’s against the rules.” Then Shigaraki jerks backwards. He stands up, shoots one last glare, and then stalks off.

 

Izuku holds his breath as Shigaraki slinks out of the shop. He quietly skulks past Izuku’s friends and everything is fine until Shinsou pauses, starts to turn around--

 

“Hi guys!” Izuku greets with a smile and wave. Shinsou turns back towards him and continues walking inside. “Sorry, I got distracted by tea.”

 

Shinsou frowns with his eyebrows before collapsing into the seat across from Izuku. Shouto doesn’t hesitate to sit next to Izuku.

 

“Where’s everyone else?” Izuku asks.

 

“After you left to use the bathroom--” Shinsou puts air quotes around the phrase “--this guy--” he flips off Shouto “--and I split off. He got sick of your perky little friends.”

 

Shouto nods, silently backing up Shinsuo.

 

And that’s a lot to unpack. Izuku wants to respond to all of it--the air quotes, how his friends are “perky” and “little”, the comfort with which Shinsou flipped Shouto off... Izuku settles to say, “I’m glad you’re both getting along.”

 

“We’re not,” Shinsou and Shouto say simultaneously.

 

Izuku smiles.

 

Shinsou scoffs, leans back, and says, “Get me a coffee, richboy. Five espresso shots, milk, no sugar.”

 

Shouto gets up and walks up to the counter.

 

“Impressive,” Izuku starts. “How’d you do that?”

 

“Not with my quirk.” Shinsou watches Shouto out of the corner of his eye. “He has more compassion than he lets on.”

 

After a couple moments of silence, Shinsou makes eye contact. “Has anyone told you that you’re really untrustworthy?”

 

Caught off guard, Izuku smiles. He tilts his head a little and answers, “Yes.”

 

Shinsou just huffs.

 

- - -

 

“Thank you, Izuku,” Father says with a smile as he takes the bag of tea leaves. He ruffles Izuku’s hair. “Who’d you go out with, again?”

 

“Just a few of my classmates: Todoroki, Yaoyorozu, Iida, Uraraka, and Shinsou.”

 

“Ah, Shinsou-kun. He was up to some interesting stuff during his internship.”

 

“Yes, he was,” Izuku responds even though he knows nothing about Shinsou’s internship, other than that it was with Ms. Joke. He had not time to keep in touch with his other classmates, what with Gran Torino and Stain.

 

“He should join us for dinner,” Father says.

 

What. That's not--no. That's not what he's supposed to say. Air catches in Izuku's throat. Father is supposed to say that Shinsou's a bad influence on Izuku, or that Shinsou isn't really his friend, or that Izuku shouldn't hang out with him anymore.

 

Father isn't supposed to say, “Why don’t you invite him over. Any evening this week is fine.” But he does.

 

 
Notes:

    If you hadn’t noticed, I’m going to cut/postpone the final exam arc -- mainly because I’m getting impatient and really want to get to the summer camp!! :P
    That also means that we probably only have about 5-7 chapters left instead of 10! (I've brought our chapter estimate down to 37, to give us a more accurate estimate) We’re almost there!!

Chapter Text

Everything is going fine. Well, as fine as it can be while Hitoshi’s lunch is interrupted by not only Todoroki, but Midoriya as well. He just can’t catch a break. First he’s bribed into going shopping, now he has to talk for the entire lunch period. Gross.

 

Hitoshi’s been playing their game, trying and failing to make Midoriya respond to him. But—not that Hitoshi’s the local Midoriya expert—he’s pretty sure Midoriya’s acting weird. It wouldn’t be concerning (Hitoshi doesn’t care enough about Midoriya to be concerned for him) but Todoroki’s also acting weird, and the tension is contagious in a way that makes Hitoshi want to leave. He doesn’t leave—partially because he’s trapped in between a rock and Todoroki and a hard place and Midoriya—and partially because (although he’d never never admit it) Hitoshi’s curious. He does, sort of—just a little bit—want to know what’s wrong with the two top hero students. The only upside to this whole situation is that Hitoshi may have front row seats to the disasters of 1-A.

 

About halfway into lunch, Hitoshi gives in to his curiosity. And, anyway, “This is pointless. You’re distracted.” Midoriya finally looks up from his lunch, blinking into awareness. “As Todoroki is my witness I forfeit this round.”

 

Midoriya looks between the two, smiles, and says, “Okay. Alright.”

 

Hitoshi momentarily considers pulling a gotcha! but he’s sure the only reason Midoriya spoke up was because they both know he meant it when he forfeit. “What’s up. You’ve been acting weird enough that even Todoroki’s noticed.”

 

Todoroki nods once, and says, “That’s correct.”

 

“So spill, golden child.”

 

When Midoriya finally opens his mouth, Hitoshi has zero chance of ever guessing the words that come out. “Shinsou-kun,” Midoriya starts with a forced ease. “My father’s invited you over for dinner, tonight.”

 

Which is weird and a lot too fast and something Hitoshi has zero interest in ever doing.

 

But the temperature drops so quickly it makes Hitoshi’s skin itch and Todoroki fucking stops breathing.

 

“I’m busy tonight,” Hitoshi lies.

 

Midoriya frowns and says with full confidence, “No you’re not.”

 

“How do you know?” Hitoshi snaps.

 

Midoriya leans backwards and pouts. “It’s—one of my quirks.”

 

Of course it is.

 

“Fine. I don’t want to.”

 

Midoriya tries to smile, but it doesn’t come across right.

 

“Shinsou,” Todoroki states, and although he says nothing else Hitoshi hears the threat perfectly clear.

 

Hitoshi is going to refuse. He has no reason not to, but then Midoriya says, “I’m making omurice.”

 

Which just so happens to be Hitoshi’s favorite food, and sure he’s never had it homemade before but, whatever, he can steal a pre-packaged one from somewhere and it’ll probably taste just as good. Probably.

 

“Plus, we have a Jamaagaana espresso machine.”

 

Hitoshi starts. That’s practically impossible—the Jamaagaana is one of the most expensive machines on the market. Honestly, Hitoshi didn’t even think an individual could buy it—he thought it was reserved for the best of coffee shops. 

 

Hitoshi knows he is being manipulated, but knowing that means he is the one in control. Anyway, he’s curious about why this is such a big deal—why Todoroki’s so tense and Midoriya’s so distracted. “Fine,” he grunts out with a strained apathy. “I’ll always take free food. And coffee.” 

 

- - -

 

Todoroki pulls Hitoshi aside after classes are out and drags him off campus to a too-expensive cafe in a too-good part of town, with no words other than let’s go.

 

Hitoshi stares up at the fancy, handwritten menu, trying to figure out if the decimal places are really there or it’s just a trick of the eyes. “You’re paying.” It isn’t a question.

 

Todoroki nods, takes out his wallet, and orders a caramel frappuccino for himself and five espresso shots with milk.

 

Hitoshi doesn’t mention the fact that Todoroki knows his coffee order by heart, though pockets the information as prime blackmail material for the future.

 

They have their drinks before Todoroki gets the receipt.

 

Todoroki walks to a back corner table and sits down like he owns it. “We need to talk about Izuku.”

 

Of course this is about Midoriya.

 

“What, so this isn’t a date?” Hitoshi retorts, as he collapses into the chair across from Todoroki.

 

Todoroki—the worst person in the world to try and rile up—simply blinks, takes a sip, and says, “No. If it were you’d be aware of it beforehand. And I wouldn’t take you here.”

 

Hitoshi snorts. “So, this is about my dinner date with Midoriya-senior, I’m guessing?”

 

“Be careful...” Todoroki starts, which he easily could have said in the 1-A classroom. “Don’t trust Izuku’s father.”

 

“What are you, his boyfriend?”

 

“I am his friend and male.”

 

Hitoshi really hates Todoroki sometimes. How has this boy survived this long? Privilege, probably.

 

Hitoshi chugs half his drink, the buzz skittering along his skin—the only serotonin he can get nowadays. Then Todoroki says, “This is serious.”

 

Hitoshi rolls his eyes. “Yeah? And? What do you know about shitty dads?”

 

One of Todoroki’s eyebrows twitch and he leans back, sitting up a little straighter. “You can’t see it?” Todoroki starts “I thought, since it’s you...” He looks blankly at Hitoshi before continuing, “What did you think Izuku meant when he said “we’re all more similar than you think”?”

 

Hitoshi scowls. “Nothing,” he answers. “He didn’t mean jack. It was just some more of his manipulative bullshit.”

 

Todoroki tenses. “You know the answer,” he states with unwarranted confidence.

 

“This isn’t going anywhere,” Hitoshi says. “Thanks for the coffee, but—”

 

“You know Izuku and I better than anyone else does, just as we know you better than anyone else ever could.”

 

“No you don’t.” Hitoshi wraps himself up with a sharp tension, builds a wall between them.

 

Todoroki tilts his head a bit. “You don’t want to see it, so you can’t.”

 

Hitoshi jumps up, slams a hand on the table, and yells, “Shut up!” Then he storms out the building.

 

Luckily, he’d subconsciously grabbed his coffee beforehand.

 

- - -

 

Hitoshi’s wearing the best clothes he owns, which isn’t saying much—a pair of black (unripped, unstained jeans), a dark purple button-down that’s a little too small, his better pair of Converse (he has two), and the leather jacket he stole from his last foster “father”.

 

While Midoriya’s house isn’t particularly big or fancy, nor is it in a particularly rich part of town, it emanates white picket fence vibes, and that’s almost more intimidating. It looks exactly the same as every other house on this street. And yet, something about it feels different—unapproachable—like it’s too perfect.

 

He hovers on the sidewalk in front of the house. He’s seventeen minutes late, despite having left like half an hour early. He walked, alright? And he had to take a detour to avoid a flashy robbery.

 

Maybe he should just go. This was a bad idea.

 

Hitoshi was not designed for picket fences or family dinners. Every house he’s found himself in that touted perfection had simply painted over the rot. But, he supposes, that’s just how the foster system works, and this is not another foster parent he’s meeting.

 

He’s just about to turn around, but the promise of free food makes him hesitate long enough for the house door to open. Midoriya Izuku steps half-out, waves, and says, “Shinsou-kun! Come on in!”

 

Hitoshi waves weakly back and trudges up the pathway to the door. No, this isn’t another foster parent he’s meeting. This is much worse. This is Midoriya Izuku’s father—his real father, who probably loves him and spoils him and is proud of him.

 

Midoriya smiles at him as Hitoshi takes off his shoes and slips into surprisingly comfortable house slippers. Midoriya is always smiling, but there is something off about it—more off than his usual attempt at the expression. Hitoshi can’t put words to it, but as he hovers momentarily in the foyer, he realizes it isn’t only Midoriya.

 

There is something wrong with the house. Hitoshi can’t pinpoint it, either, but he can feel it subtly underneath his skin, like the lights are just slightly the wrong hue, or the AC is set just a degree too low. There’s a sharp smell he doesn’t quite recognize, hiding behind the mouth-watering smell of a home-cooked meal—like, bleach, maybe.

 

Imposing at the head of the dinner table, is a man who fills the entire room—not literally, although the tubes and wires slithering from his body do crisscross across the floor. The top half of his head is encased in some sort of medical helmet, Hitoshi guesses. This man must be Midoriya Hisashi.

 

Despite the fact that Midoriya Hisashi looks like he’ll struggle to lift up a pair of chopsticks, Hitoshi’s flight-or-fight reflex itches beneath his ribs.

 

Midoriya Hisashi smiles, a relatively warm and normal expression, and says, “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Shinsou-kun.”

 

Hitoshi wants nothing more than to walk right back out and isolate himself in some alleyway or library, but if he can’t even handle a normal dinner in a normal suburban house with a normal dad, how is he ever gonna face real villains?

 

He manages a quick, “You too,” even though it makes his tongue burn.

 

Midoriya Izuku leads him to the seat to Hisashi’s left. Hitoshi reluctantly sits down, suddenly aware of the fact that he’s never been to a real family dinner. Those facades the group homes and foster parents put up were just that—facades—and everyone knew it. But this is a real family, and suddenly Hitoshi feels more out of place than he ever has, which is saying something.

 

Midoriya steps into the kitchen and Hitoshi has to swallow down a sudden pang of betrayal. With Midoriya out of the room, Hitoshi feels even more out of place. As Hitoshi watches Midoriya’s back, Hisashi asks, “How is the hero course treating you?”

 

Hitoshi says, “Just perfect,” with too much sarcasm, considering he doesn’t actually many complaints.

 

“You’re planning on becoming an underground hero, yes?” Hisashi asks.

 

It isn’t really a question, but Ms. Joke was a terrible influence on him, which is probably why Hitoshi says, “No, I’m planning on becoming the number one hero, actually. Gonna start my own musical radio show and sell tote bags with my name on it and show off my quirk to—”

 

Hisashi lets out a single bark of a laugh, and Midoriya nearly drops the plates as he walks back into the dining room. Hitoshi wouldn’t have even noticed the slip, Midoriya was so careful and smooth about it, but for a short moment there was something like a dull flash of yellow that drew Hitoshi’s gaze.

 

“Yes, your quirk is quite unique,” Hisashi says as Midoriya sets a plate of (delicious looking) food in front of Hitoshi. Hitoshi has just enough time to wonder how much Midoriya told Hisashi, how much Midoriya even knows about his quirk, how Midoriya knows anything about his quirk, before Hisashi continues, “I am very curious how it came to be. What are your parents’ quirks?”

 

Hitoshi bites out a “No,” then picks up his chopsticks.

 

“My apologies,” Hisashi says. “That was an insensitive question… Do you forgive me?”

 

Hitoshi raises an eyebrow. He has no idea how he’s supposed to respond to that. He doesn’t usually go around consciously forgiving people, but an unidentifiable tension settles in the air. Hitoshi feels like he’s back in the lunchroom, playing that stupid game with Midoriya. Like there’s something he’s supposed to say, or not say, but he doesn’t know what.

 

Midoriya subtly nods at him, smiling a not-smile that makes Hitoshi spit out, “Sure. Whatever.”

 

And the tension floats away like it was never there, so smoothly Hitoshi starts to question if it was ever really there, or it was just his trauma-induced social anxiety fucking with him.

 

“Wonderful,” Hisashi says, then takes a bite. Hitoshi takes a moment to try the food, too, and the moment it touches his tongue he knows it’s the best thing he’s ever tasted.

 

“How is it?” Midoriya asks, lightly.

 

Hitoshi is too busy eating to answer some snarky lie like, tastes just as good as McDonald’s.

 

Hisashi answers, “Nearly perfect.”

 

Midoriya’s face drops, just barely, and Hitoshi’s positive he never would have noticed if they hadn’t spent the past few weeks eating lunch together and psychologically manipulating each other.

 

“It could use a tad less salt, next time,” Hisashi continues.

 

Midoriya nods, smiles, and says cheerfully, “Alrighty!” But none of it even begins to reach his eyes.

 

Hitoshi is not sure what motivates him to say, “It’s perfect. Literally the best food I’ve ever tasted in my life,” but he tells himself it’s because he likes being contrary to adults, and ignores the honest happiness brightening Midoriya’s face.

 

“Why did you decide to become a hero, Shinsou-kun?” Hisashi asks.

 

“Spite,” Hitoshi answers automatically, which is only like 10% of the reason, but that sounds cooler (and fits his image better) than I don’t want anyone else to suffer like I have.

 

Hisashi smiles. “A perfectly legitimate answer,” he says to Hitoshi’s surprise. “I respect your honesty. I’ve never trusted spotlight heroes like, say, All Might, who put on such an obvious facade of righteousness.”

 

Hitoshi almost laughs. That's the last thing he’d expect the father of Midoriya Izuku, future number one hero, face of righteousness, and spotlight hog to be saying.

 

“Don’t you agree, Izuku?” Hisashi asks.

 

Hitoshi raises an eyebrow and watches Midoriya answer, “Of course,” without any hesitation.

 

Hitoshi quite nearly throws up. He has to swallow down the mushy rice and cheese which lurched back up his throat. He doesn’t know why his body reacts so viscerally, why he very suddenly does not feel safe, anymore.

 

He shoots to his feet and bites out, “Restroom.”

 

Midoriya’s face twists with concern and he says, “Upstairs. First door on the left.”

 

Hitoshi doesn’t hesitate, taking the stairs two at a time and slamming the bathroom door behind him.

 

Todoroki flinched.

 

Hitoshi collapses. He throws up into the toilet. Egg and soy sauce coat his throat, his tongue, his lips.

 

Todoroki flinched when Hitoshi yelled shut up. He had ignored it because he didn’t want to see it. Because he didn’t want to consider the implications. Because he didn’t want to know this. But he can’t unknow it, anymore.

 

It all makes sense. Terrible, horrible sense. So much sense that he wishes he never showed up. He munched preferred ignorance.

 

He knows, now what Midoriya meant when he said we’re all more similar than you think. And he hates it. He doesn’t want to know. How is he supposed to go back down there without punching Hisashi in the face? 

 

Hitoshi can’t pretend that nothing is wrong, he can’t smile when Hisashi makes passive aggressive jabs. Hitoshi isn’t Midoriya.

 

Oh, god, Hitoshi isn’t Izuku.

 

He finally understands Izuku’s smile. Worse, he knows what Midoriya meant when he said I have more experience, back at the sports festival. Of course he has more experience with psychological manipulation if his dad's a fucking narcistic abuser.

 

Hitoshi should have seen it sooner—no, he did see it, he just ignored it. He didn't even have to be in a room with the man to know he was a manipulative son of a bitch. Everything Midoriya's ever done has proved that.

 

How is he supposed to leave Izuku here? He knows that confronting an abuser only ever makes it worse for the victim when they aren’t capable of going no-contact. He knows that if he says anything now, Hisashi will just use it against Izuku later. Even worse than that, Hitoshi is dreadfully afraid that if he were to talk to Izuku about it, Izuku would simply deny everything and push him away.

 

All the books and articles and web pages and experts say that the best thing he can do for Izuku is offer support and be there for him and make sure he knows you’re here for him, which, knowing Izuku, will accomplish exactly nothing. The only other potential option would be informing an adult, but Hitoshi can’t think of a single one he trusts enough to not make the situation worse.

 

He knows he will not be able to sit at that table without escalating things, without making life harder for Izuku.

 

So he flushes the toilet, washes his hands and splashes water over his face. He walks down the stairs and bites out a quick, “Gotta go.”

 

Izuku stands up, turns towards the kitchen. “Take some coffee with you?”

 

Hitoshi doesn’t even shake his head, he just walks to the door, throws off his slippers, and begins the painful process of trying to get converse shoes on.

 

“Before you go,” Hisashi starts, still sat perfectly at the dining table. “Shinsou-kun, have you ever considered being a villain?”

 

Hitoshi pauses, then resumes tying his shoes. “Every fucking day,” he growls.

 

He slams the door behind him.

 

- - -

 

“That was quite rude,” Father says with a frown. “He didn’t even finish his plate.”

 

Izuku looks at the door. “I don’t think he’s been feeling well, lately. Aizawa-sensei might be overworking him.”

 

“You should pick better friends,” Father starts and Izuku freezes. “His quirk has potential, but his personality... I don’t think he’s hero material.”

 

Izuku stops breathing. His quirks tense his muscles, and power threads through his whole body, enough power for him to say, “No.”

 

He doesn’t let Father respond, bulldozing into, “Hitoshi's going to be a great hero one day. Today, he's my friend, and nothing is going to change that. Not even you."

 

Izuku is shaking, with fear and tension and One for All. He stands up. He isn’t thinking, not really, and it’s been so long since his head was this clear, since the only thought in there was his own. “I’m going to my room,” he states with a confidence that might not be false.

 

He makes it halfway up the stairs before Father calls, “Izuku.”

 

He stops, out of habit, out of fear, and he suddenly feels so small. Oh, god, he shouldn’t have. Father’s going to ground him, now, and he’s going to miss final exams, and the summer camp, and even if he doesn’t he won’t have any quirks, and everyone will realize how much of a fraud he is, and he’s going to be expelled from UA and—

 

“Izuku," Father continues. "I’m so proud of you.”

 

 

 
Notes:

    big shoutout to Shinsou Hitoshi, who just told All for One that he considers villainy "every fucking day" :P

    I absolutely love writing (this characterization of) Hitoshi! He's so self aware and knowledgeable when it comes to abuse, trauma, and psychology.

    As always, thank you all for your support and patience! Summer break's started so I'm hoping to get the next few chapters out soon!

    Next up: All Might finally tells Izuku about All for One.

Chapter Text

Izuku is, somehow, not grounded. He only found out this morning, when Father asked him what they were having for breakfast through his unlocked bedroom door. Which means Izuku was allowed to pack lunch. He packed two—one for him and one for Yagi-sensei, who is looking down at it with a big smile and tears welling up his eyes.

 

“I can,” Yagi starts with a sniffle, “I can eat everything in here, Izuku.”

 

Having only half a stomach means the list of foods Yagi can eat is relatively small, and Izuku memorized that list months ago.

 

“You’re so kind,” Yagi continues, before taking a bite of Izuku’s homemade rice porridge.

 

They eat in a comfortable silence for a few minutes. Izuku actively ignores the question itching at the back of his skull: what did you want to talk about?  He never asks it, because he trusts that Yagi will get there, and that if it was something he needed to be concerned about, Yagi would tell him.

 

“Izuku, I—” Yagi swallows. “Nothing is wrong, my boy, I just—I need to tell you something.”

 

Nothing is wrong. Izuku has to consciously stamp down the panic that crawls up his throat. Nothing is wrong.

 

Yagi fixes a smile on his face and continues, “You’re already a great hero, my boy. I’m sorry we’ve both been so busy and haven’t gotten to talk much, lately, but I want you to know... I’m so proud of you.”

 

Izuku smiles, whispers a near-silent thanks, even though Yagi's words feel flat. Almost as flat as they did last night, but Yagi is not his father.

 

“Nedzu told me about your reflection on the USJ attack. He was... impressed.” Yagi cringes with his entire face, so intensely he coughs. “Which is more than a little terrifying, but also the highest compliment he’s capable of.” Yagi sets down his spoon and tries to make eye contact, but fails, and instead stares at Izuku’s eyebrows. “He mentioned you had some theories about the Nomu... that there’s someone—a villain—with a quirk that can give and take other quirks...” He meets Izuku’s eyes. “You were right.”

 

Izuku freezes.

 

Yagi sits up straight, and solidifies his face into a serious expression that makes him look like All Might. “I fought him, six years ago. We thought he was dead—I thought he was dead. But, now... we think he’s alive. That he’s creating the nomus. That he’s the leader of the League of Villains...” Yagi drifts off, but his expression doesn't change.

 

“Why are you telling me this?” Izuku asks, because surely it’s classified information. But more than that—because he doesn’t want to know. Every cell in his body is screaming at him to leave, to run away, for Yagi to stop talking. But Izuku doesn't move. He can't.

 

Yagi’s features only intensify. “His name is All for One.”

 

Izuku only half-listens as Yagi tells him about the 200-year-old villain, the brother of One for All’s first holder, how One for All was born with his help, how One for All is the only quirk which stands a chance against All for One. Izuku only half-listens because it's just a coincidence.

 

It’s just a coincidence. It’s just a coincidence that Father’s quirk is similar. It’s just a coincidence. What’s he even doing, thinking about his Father right now? It’s impossible. It's just a coincidence. Father might be related—a great-great-grandson, or something, or, more likely, it’s just a coincidence. There are billions of humans on this planet, billions of quirks. Any number of them could be similar to Father’s.

 

It’s just a coincidence that around that time, Father got injured. Maybe he was collateral. Maybe All for One hurt him. Or maybe it’s just a coincidence.

 

A voice yells Izuku!  It sounds like All Might's voice even though it's a woman's.

 

Yagi is staring at him, face only a foot from Izuku’s, concern tinting his skin pink. “Are you alright, my boy?”

 

“Of course!” Izuku answers with a smile, even though his heart is pushing against his throat and chest. Even though he can feel it beating against every vein in his body.

 

How long did he miss? What is Yagi thinking? Does he know?

 

“Sorry," Izuku starts. "It’s just... that was a lot of information. There’s a lot to think about.”

 

“Of course...” Yagi leans back, turns to his lunch, and they settle back into what should be silence.

 

But Izuku’s head is not silent. There is a chatter so loud he can’t understand it, some of it his own voice—worries, anxieties, fears—some of it voices he doesn’t recognize.

 

After a couple minutes, Yagi speaks up again, “I’m not going to force you to do anything, Izuku, but when I retire... you’ll be the only one left who stands a chance at defeating All for One. In any other circumstance, I would never ask you to take on such a burden, but... when the time comes—" Yagi meets Izuku's eyes. "—will you pick up my mantel? Will you defend the world against All for One?"

 

“I’d be honored, Yagi-san,” Izuku answers with a big, picture-perfect smile, despite the incessant whispers of that's not a choice. "I’ll defeat All for One.”

 

Yagi smiles back, relieved.

 

But some small voice, barely a whisper, contends, even if he’s your father?

 

And in the shadow of a reflection of an echo, a woman with green hair sobs, I’m sorry, baby, I’m so sorry. 

 

- - -

 

As the bell rings, Shouto packs up his bag and dreads going home. Before he can stand up, Shinsou steps in front of his desk and says, “Todoroki.”

 

It’s the first time Shinsou’s ever initiated a conversation with him, and Shouto finds a smile settling onto his face before he can stop it.

 

Shinsou pales and his eyes widen. He looks like he’s about to run away but then his face relaxes and he sighs. “Buy me a coffee.” It almost sounds like a question, like Shinsou’s way of saying please is making eye contact and speaking a little softer than he usually would.

 

Shouto nods, stands up, and tries to stifle the smile that’s frozen on his face. They walk to the cafe without saying another word, until Shouto orders both their drinks and they sit down at the corner table.

 

After taking a sip that’s more like a chug, Shinsou looks into Shouto’s eyes and says, “I’m sorry.”

 

For a moment, he doesn’t look like Shinsou. But then Shouto realizes that this is what Shinsou really looks like, under his mask of indifference and sarcasm and antagonism, this is Shinsou Hitoshi. A subtle, smooth frown. Eyes soft with vulnerability—with fear. A loneliness in his loose shoulders.

 

“What for?” Shouto asks.

 

“Dismissing your experience of abuse,” Shinsou answers automatically. And while it sounds a little practiced, Shouto can hear the authenticity in the barely-perceptible shaking of Shinsuo's hands. “I made assumptions about you based on my own expectations, not who you really are. I don't want your forgiveness. I just want you to know I've recognized my mistake and will work to never do it again.”

 

Shouto is flooded with relief and he feels like can relax for the first time in weeks.

 

“Thank you,” Shouto says, “Hitoshi.”

 

Hitoshi pales again and nearly chokes on his espresso. After a moment, his face settles back into his familiar smirk, although maybe it’s a bit softer, this time—more open. “Slow down there, lover boy. It’ll take more than a couple coffees and some groceries to buy my heart.”

 

- - -

 

“To further ensure the safety of everyone involved,” Shouta begins, “we are changing the location of the summer camp. You and your parents will be informed of the new location, day of.” Shouta doesn’t give his students time to react. “Now, your final exam scores.”

 

He finishes passing out the exams and returns to his podium, small spots appear in his vision. Shouta questions whether he’s had enough iron recently, but instead of dissipating with long blinks and eyedrops, they grow brighter—yellow—and—is this a villain attack? Shouta is immediately on-guard. Something is wrong. A vague anxiety races his heart as he grabs hold of his capture weapon. The yellow is only thickening, further disrupting his vision, and Shouta struggles to keep an eye on his class. They all look equally concerned, on-edge, ready for a fight—except for Midoriya.

 

Midoriya is staring at his scoresheets, face blank, and glowing yellow. Although his mouth isn’t moving Shouta can almost hear him saying, I did my best. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I did my best.

 

Out of habit, Shouta activates his quirk. The yellow lights immediately fade, as does the fear, so quickly that if Shouta were a lesser adult he may have mistaken it for a panic attack of his own, but now Midoriya is choking, struggling to breath as if Shouta didn’t stop his quirks, but his lungs.

 

Shouta does not have the time or luxury to question how any one of Midoriya’s quirk could do this, because Midoriya is in the throes of a panic attack. It, somehow, looks worse than the one Shouta witnessed a couple months ago. Before he can get there and walk Midoriya through it, Shinsou Hitoshi is kneeling beside his desk, a hand on his shoulder, whispering quietly, a gentle expression on his face Shouta didn’t believe the boy capable of.

 

In front of them, Bakugou shoots to his feet, roughly grabbing his bag. He mutters something too quiet for Shouta to understand, but it sounds almost like attention whore. As he stalks to the door, for a short moment, he interrupts Shouta’s line of sight and he’s nearly blinded by the sharp yellow fear.

 

This is how Midoriya feels? Shouta hopes that his Empathy quirk is elevating the feeling, somehow, though he doesn’t bet on it. Is this because, for the first time this semester, he didn't place first in the class? Because he got a 99% on the Chemistry final while Yaoyorozu got a 100%? If this is how scared Midoriya feels from getting second place on a test—what in the hell is scaring him so much?

 

He blinks, manages to find Midoriya again and activate his quirk but the class is already panicking. He hears concerned conspiracies about a villain attack, poison, quirk. The room is at least ten degrees colder than it used to be. A flock of birds peck at the windows as Kouda hides his head under his arms. The lights flicker; Kaminari sparks with lingering static. An uneven hum comes from Iida as he stands at the ready, engines revving.

 

Shouta had no idea Midoriya’s Empathy quirk was capable of this—of transmitting his own feelings to those around him. Because that's the only explanation for this—for the fear, the yellow lights, the fact that Shouta can Erase it.

 

Shouta maintains line of sight and keeps his quirk active. “Settle down,” he orders his class. “Everything is alright. Everyone is safe.”

 

“Bullshit,” one of his students yells, but he doesn’t have the bandwidth to identify who.

 

How is he supposed to explain this without breaching Midoriya’s privacy? Without telling the whole class he’s having a panic attack? Without making the claim that this has something to do with his Empathy quirk, of which he has no real evidence for.

 

“What’s wrong?” someone asks quietly. It might be Uraraka. “Is Izuku alright?”

 

“I believe it is a panic attack,” Aoyama answers with a surprising astuteness, even though he looks like he’s about to throw up.

 

“What about the lights? The yellow?”

 

Yaoyorozu speaks up, with a subtle waver in each syllable, “He has an Empathy quirk. I recall him mentioning he sees emotions as colors—auras.”

 

His students are so astute it threatens to frighten Shouta. Or maybe that’s the lingering of Midoriya’s fear.

 

Midoriya’s breathing has stabilized, and his eyes are focused on Shinsou.

 

To test the water, Shouta blinks.

 

There is no flash of yellow, no fear. Shouta relaxes minutely and turns to the rest of the class, canceling practically everyone’s quirk. The room silences, save Shinsou’s persistent gentle mumblings. “Everything is fine,” Shouta repeats. “Midoriya’s Empathy quirk is flaring up.”

 

His class does not protest, this time, so he begins walking towards his problem student.

 

Todoroki Shouto stands in front of him, silent and expressionless. Shouta starts to move around him but Todoroki blocks him without a change in expression. There is a sudden bite in the air, a chill that makes him pause in place.

 

“Don’t make things worse,” Todoroki states.

 

Shouta immediately bristles at the accusation, but he gives himself a moment to wonder what makes Todoroki so confident that Shouta will make things worse.

 

After a short moment, Iida stands next to Todoroki, and while he looks a bit uncomfortable and confused—he keeps re-adjusting his glasses every two seconds and glancing at Todoroki—he stands tall.

 

“I am a hero and teacher,” Shouta states. “I am trained to handle these kinds of situations, Todoroki. Let me help him.”

 

Todoroki doesn’t budge. “You’ll only make things worse.”

 

“I won’t. Trust me.”

 

“No.”

 

Iida sputters, but to Shouta’s surprise he doesn’t speak up.

 

Shouta is sure he has not done anything to Todoroki to garner such distrust. Which means there is another person out there who completely shattered Todoroki’s trust in adults.

 

Shouta’s always thought Enji would make a terrible father. Maybe he was right.

 

Shouta stares at Todoroki. He does not say, After the summer camp I will be having a discussion with your father, but he means it.

 

The tension hangs heavy in the air, neither of them budging, until Iida says, “Might I suggest Recovery Girl or Hound Dog?”

 

Shouta is temporarily impressed by Iida’s conflict resolution skills, but doesn’t have a chance to linger on the moment.

 

“Recover Girl,” Todoroki states.

 

Shouta nods and tells Iida, “Bring her here.”

 

Iida leaves with a respective bow and one last glance towards Midoriya.

 

Shouta abandons his stare down with Todoroki to check on the rest of his kids.

 

Shinsou stands up slowly. He turns around and says, still with an uncharacteristic gentleness, “Uraraka. Come talk to him.”

 

Uraraka flounders, leaning backwards and waving her hands. “M-me?” Her eyes are wide. “I don’t—what should I say?”

 

“Distract him,” Shinsou answers immediately, and Shouta is yet again struck by how well this kid is handling this. “Just be yourself. Be nice.”

 

After a moment the panic falls off her face and Uraraka smiles. She stands up with a confidence she seemed to lack a moment ago and takes Shinsou’s spot beside Izuku’s desk. Shinsou steps back, but remains close.

 

No one else speaks as Uraraka rambles nothing of consequence. She talks of her small middle school, of her favorite thrift store, of helping her parents with the company, of the limits of her quirk, of her dog. And the tension in the room slowly dissipates, until there are smiles, and even the occasional laughter.

 

Todoroki still does not move, and neither does Shouta, mainly because he isn’t sure where he’d move to.

 

By the time Chiyo and Iida arrive, an outsider might mistake his classroom as back to normal.

 

“Midoriya, dear,” Chiyo calls quietly. “Why don’t we get some air?

 

Midoriya nods at her. As he stands up to go, Uraraka asks, “Can I give you a hug?”

 

After a moment, Midoriya smiles, nods, and they hug.

 

“See you at the summer camp!” Uraraka exclaims.

 

Something settles across Midoriya’s face. Something that, in another context, Shouta might have identified as resolve. Midoriya states, “See you there,” with a weight that does not make sense, like there is hell.

 

- - -

 

In the stark silence of Izuku’s absence, Yaoyorozu whispers, “Is Midoriya-kun okay?”

 

Nobody answers, likely because they all know the answer already.

 

Shouta stands back behind his podium. He needs to debrief. He needs to somehow reassure his class. He needs to make sure everyone is actually okay.

 

Maybe he should go back to university and get a degree in psychology. Or maybe Nedzu just needs to offer a program for teachers titled what to do if a student has a panic attack mid-class.

 

Shouta lets out a heavy sigh. Class was over four minutes ago. “How are you all feeling.”

 

No one says anything. Fine. "Uraraka," he starts. "How are you feeling?"

 

She jumps, then after a moment, says, quietly, “Relieved, I guess. That Izuku’s okay, or, well, okay enough.”

 

After a moment, Shouta says, "Iida."

 

Iida answers, “Worried for my friend," but his voice lacks his usual boisterous confidence.

 

Shouta continues, "Kaminari."

 

Kaminari's eyes widen, then he says, “Uhhhh, what?"

 

"How are you feeling?"

 

"Right. Overwhelmed, and lots of other emotions I don’t have the words for.”

 

"Shinsou."

 

Shinsou doesn't hesitate. “Pass.”

 

One of Shouta’s eyebrows twitch. After a moment, he decides to let it go, but then Shinsou checks his phone and says, “Actually, I’m outta here. Class ended like five minutes ago.”

 

As he stands up, so does Todoroki, and shortly behind, Uraraka.

 

“Wait, Shinsou-kun!” she calls across the room. “Can you teach me how to do that?”

 

“No,” Shinsou answers immediately. Then, he adds on, “Do what?”

 

“Whatever you did to calm Izuku down.”

 

Yaoyorozu stands up. “I would also like to learn how to do that.”

 

Iida, “As would I.”

 

Shinsou lets out a heavy sigh. “Google how to help a friend with a panic attack. You’re welcome.”

 

Shouta speaks up, “I will coordinate a workshop post-summer camp on panic attacks.” Honestly, he's going to do much more than that when he gets the chance.

 

That seems to relieve Uraraka, Yaoyorozu, and Iida, but Shinsou just keeps walking to the door.

 

“Shinsou,” Shouta says as he passes him.

 

Shinsou pauses.

 

“I’d like you to stay,” Shouta says, quietly. “We can chat in my office once I’m done here.”

 

Shinsou looks into Shouta's eyes and says, “No,” with absolutely zero inflection. He turns his head ever so slightly and tells Todoroki, “Let’s go, Romeo.” Then the two walk out. Together.

 

 

 
Notes:

    This chapter got so big I had to split it in two, hence the increase in total chapter count :P

    I have a lot of fave interactions from this chapter, but “Trust me.” / “No.” may be at the top of the list. Tied with “Thank you, Hitoshi.” / “Slow down there, lover boy.” Both have Todoroki Shouto in common

    (Most characterizations of Hitoshi: accidentally calls Aizawa 'dad' and gets super embarrassed
    My characterization of Hitoshi: would purposefully call Aizawa 'dad' to see how he reacts)

    With this chapter we've passed 100k words!!!!!!!!

    Next up: Izuku tells his dad how he did on the exams :)

Chapter 32: Your prison's not my home
Notes:

    title borrowed from the wonderful song "ANTIHERO" by AViVA

    warnings for: AFO's terrible parenting in scene 3; claustrophobia in scene 5; mild body horror in scene 5; moment of suicidal idealization in scene 5

Chapter Text

Hitoshi leans against the wall, pretending to scroll through his phone, but really just staring at the home screen. His thoughts are running so quickly he can’t keep hold of any of them, like white noise that turns out to be a hundred people screaming.

 

A few feet to Hitoshi’s left, Shouto stands perfectly still and straight, with a discipline Hitoshi will never have. 

 

Across from them sits the door to the nurse’s office, where Izuku is surely deflecting all of Recovery Girl’s concerns and questions.

 

Hitoshi wants to tell Shouto about Hisashi, or maybe he never wants to think about Izuku’s father again.

 

His mouth is dry. He’s probably just imagining it but there’s still a yellow tint to his skin.

 

Does it count as a panic attack if Izuku’s fear is perfectly valid? When Hitoshi has anxiety attacks he usually asks himself: what’s the worst that can happen? But he couldn’t ask Izuku. Hitoshi can’t even begin to imagine what the worst is when it comes to Izuku’s father.

 

Hitoshi doesn’t want to think any longer, so he turns to Shouto and says, “If you ever wanna run away, I can point you in the direction of some five-star dumpsters.” It’s a joke, but he means it.

 

Shouto smiles just ever-so-slightly, and says, “Hitoshi” instead of thank you.

 

Hitoshi doesn’t have time to linger on that because the door to the nurse’s office opens. Izuku and Recovery Girl step out. She looks at the both of them and smiles that smile that keeps getting more popular around UA—the smile that isn’t happy at all.

 

Recovery Girl says, “You boys make sure he gets home safe, alright?” then steps back into her office.

 

A million and one snarky retorts fight for Hitoshi’s voice, but instead he turns to Izuku and asks, “How you doin’?”

 

Izuku answers, “I’m fine.”

 

“No you’re not. Try again.”

 

This might be the first time Izuku’s ever been speechless.

 

“I—I’m sorry?” Izuku finally stutters out.

 

“You see emotions as colors, right? What color are you?”

 

“I can’t see my own,” Izuku answers.

 

Hitoshi has absolutely no idea if he’s telling the truth or not. “Well,” Hitoshi starts. “I’m not fine. Ice ice baby ain't fine. And you’re definitely not fine. But whatever.”

 

Izuku checks his phone. “Sorry, but, I’m already running late. I really should be going.”

 

Hitoshi says, “We’ll walk with you.”

 

“Thank you, but that really isn’t necessary.”

 

Fine, then. Hitoshi will pull an Izuku on him. “Aizawa and Recovery Girl both insisted we walk you home. We aren’t doing you a favor; we’re just doing what we’re told.”

 

After a moment, Izuku smiles. “Alrighty, but I can’t offer you any coffee, this time. My father’s very sick, and probably shouldn’t be having any visitors.”

 

“Sick in the head?” Hitoshi retorts under his breath. Shouto glares at him with something that might be fondness, and Izuku just looks confused.

 

Without a word, Shouto starts walking towards the exit. After a beat, Hitoshi and Izuku follow him.

 

Hitoshi tries his best to distract Izuku during their walk to the bus stop, the bus ride, and the short walk to Izuku’s house. He isn’t sure how well he’s succeeded, but by the time they reach his neighborhood, Izuku is ten minutes into a monologue about non-traditional heroics that has Hitoshi jotting down six book titles and rethinking the entirety of society.

 

When they reach the sidewalk in front of his house, though, Izuku cuts off mid-sentence. He transitions into goodbyes, but Hitoshi cuts him off: “Midoriya.” Once he’s sure he has Izuku’s attention, he continues, “What can we do for you?”

 

Izuku starts to say, “Thank you, but—” but Hitoshi interrupts him with, “That’s not how this works. We are going to help you. Tell us how.”

 

“Really, I’m fine—” but Hitoshi snaps his fingers in Shouto’s directions and says, “Hot stuff, give us some suggestions.” After a moment of silence, Hitoshi turns to Shouto and says, “I’m talking to you.”

 

Shouto blinks and lets out a quiet, “Oh." He continues, "My name is Shouto, not hot stuff.”

 

“Sure, whatever. Suggestions.”

 

Shouto says nothing more, which is just about what Hitoshi expected.

 

“How...” Izuku ponders. Then, he looks smaller than Hitoshi’s ever seen him and drops his eyes to stare at the ground. “How about... do you want to be friends?”

 

Friends?

 

Hitoshi takes a step back.

 

Friends?

 

Every instinct is screaming at him to run away. Get as far away from them as he can—as far away from people as he can. Hitoshi knows the way to the nearest abandoned warehouse better than his mother’s face.

 

The last person who asked to be Hitoshi’s friend was getting paid twenty bucks to humiliate him. The one before that posted video of him on HeroTube.

 

Hitoshi should be scowling, spitting out the words why the fuck would I do that? before stalking off. But his body isn’t moving. Despite everything Hitoshi’s learned over the past fourteen years, despite the years of bullying and abuse, his body doesn’t move.

 

There is a vulnerability in friendship that Hitoshi has not been willing to risk since fifth grade. Friends is nothing but a word held against his back, ready to skewer him when the joke’s gone on too long.

 

No one can hurt him if he never lets anyone close enough.

 

But his body doesn’t move. Instead there is something burning in his chest. He doesn’t want to leave. He should, but he doesn’t.

 

Shouto places a gentle hand on Hitoshi’s shoulder.

 

Hitoshi relaxes. Against everything that’s ever been beat into him, Hitoshi relaxes. Against every survival tactic he’s learned, Hitoshi relaxes.

 

It is with a dreadful horror that Hitoshi realizes it is too late.

 

He feels safer when Shouto’s in the room than he does when he's alone.

 

“We’re already friends,” Shouto says.

 

Hitoshi wants to deny it, but a knot forms in his throat.

 

Izuku lets out a big smile. “Perfect. Okay, I really gotta go. See you both tomorrow!” Then he walks up to his house and disappears past the door.

 

“Fuck,” Hitoshi says, defeated.

 

Shouto smiles. “Let’s go.”

 

Hitoshi does not ask where to.

 

- - -

 

Despite wanting nothing more than to hide in a dark closet and pass the fuck out, Shouta heads straight to Chiyo’s office. He spent the last hour in a pseudo group therapy until his final students (Uraraka, Iida, Yaoyorozu, Aoyama, and Kouta) headed home.

 

Midoriya is long gone by the time he gets there, which doesn’t surprise him one bit.

 

Chiyo looks nearly as exhausted as Shouta feels, holding her face in her hands.

 

Shouta collapses onto one of the empty cots and stares up at the tiled ceiling. “How’s Midoriya doing?” he asks, more out of habit than anything else.

 

Chiyo lets out a long sigh. “I have absolutely no idea... That boy is a master of deflection, Shouta-kun.”

 

That's pretty much exactly what Shouta was expecting. After a moment, he asks, “What would you suggest for next steps?”

 

Chiyo frowns. “Honestly? I think someone needs to have a talk with the boy’s father.”

 

It’s been on his to-do list ever since Midoriya’s first panic attack. But with the persistent villain attacks, he’s never gotten around to it. At this point, he definitely won’t be able to before the training camp.

 

“And his quirk?” Shouta asks.

 

Chiyo shakes her head. “If he had any insights he didn’t share them. I asked him, again, if he would see a quirk therapist, but he deflected, again. I’m not a specialist, but—Random Quirk Generator? None of us have gotten a chance to think too seriously about it. The boy could have quirks we don’t even know about—hell—”

 

That makes Shouta sit up. Chiyo rarely cusses. As he does, she makes eye contact. “He could have quirks he doesn’t even know about.”

 

- - -

 

He wants to get this over with.

 

He wants to walk straight into his room, lock it behind him, and ground himself. Izuku knows it’s going to happen. What threatens to scare him is what else Father will do. But it doesn’t scare him. Because he knows, no matter what, even if he’s quirkless, even if he’s weak from not eating or sleeping, even if standing up makes him pass out—

 

He’s going to summer camp.

 

There is nothing Father can do that will stop him. Because Izuku is going to become a hero. Because Izuku has friends.

 

He shoves open the front door, throws off his shoes. He’s ready to take whatever it is Father throws at him this time. “Good evening, Father,” Izuku says, forcing a smile onto his face. He slides into his house slippers. “How was your day?”

 

Father sighs and Izuku's whole body tenses. “I’ll be honest with you, Izuku,” which is never a good sign. “It was unfortunately stressful.”

 

The guilt crawls across Izuku’s skin. He’s only going to make Father’s day worse. He’s only going to make him feel worse.

 

“I’m looking forward to some good news,” Father says. “How’d your final exams go?”

 

Izuku can’t speak. No matter what he says, he can’t fix this. The guilt threatens to swallow him whole. It's his fault. He can’t make his father happy.

 

See you at the summer camp!

 

That’s right.

 

None of that matters right now.

 

There’s no way he can avoid this. He doesn’t want to avoid this. Like ripping off a bandaid, or re-locating a shoulder Izuku says, “I placed second in my class.”

 

The silence is unbearable, but Izuku stands unflinching in the dining room. Just get it over with, his mind screams at him. Just get it over with.

 

As long as—no, even if Father pulls him out of UA, Izuku will still go to the summer camp.

 

“Are you feeling alright?” Father asks, mouth falling into a concerned frown. “Are you sick?”

 

On the surface, the question appears to be an out—an escape hatch—but Izuku knows better. His father does not need more excuses. Izuku shakes his head, “No, no. I’m feeling fine. Healing quirk, remember?”

 

Father’s frown doesn’t move. “This is unlike you. Maybe UA is too much for you, after all.”

 

“We still have the practical finals,” Izuku says. “I’ll place first, then.”

 

“I have already given you a number of second chances, Izuku. Remember my conditions?”

 

“Of course. I have not broken any—”

 

“You’re grounded.”

 

Izuku can handle being grounded. He lets himself relax, just a bit, just enough to loosen the tension in his shoulders. “What about—”

 

“I will decide what to do about your enrollment in UA later. In the meantime, you will not be attending school. That, of course, includes the training camp.”

 

That’s alright. That’s fine. As long as Izuku is still enrolled, he can find his way to the camp. Even if it means lying to Aizawa and Nedzu. That’s fine, he can break out of his room without issue. He can handle this. It's fine.

 

“I’ll do my best in the practical finals,” Izuku says with a forced smile. “Shall I write a paper regarding the question I missed on the written exams?”

 

“No,” Father answers immediately. Izuku freezes, no longer relaxed to any degree. Father never turns down a paper. Izuku doesn’t question it, though. He can’t. He stands up straight before offering Father a small bow.

 

“Give me your phone,” Father says, holding out his hand. Izuku swallows, but doesn’t hesitate, placing the phone in his hand. Usually, Father doesn’t bother. The computer in Izuku’s room has access to all the same things, so there isn’t really a point.

 

Izuku starts walking towards his room, but before he can make it up the first step, Father says, “Not that way.”

 

Izuku freezes, and slowly turns around. Father is pointing down, at the ground.

 

Izuku stops breathing. Not the basement. Anywhere but the basement. The room tilts and blurs around him. One for All flitters against his skin, catches him right before he falls. Not the basement. Izuku can’t breathe. He’s going to throw up. Not the basement.

 

Izuku’s eyes are wide, his body shivering. Not the basement. He opens his mouth to beg, to plead. Take the quirks back. Take them all. Just not the basement.

 

But Father’s face is flat, unmoving, his mouth turned downwards in a frown. Izuku knows better than to beg. He can hear Father's response too loudly in his head: I have already been lenient with you, Izuku, don’t make me make it worse.

 

Not the basement.

 

Every inch of his body is shivering. One for All is pounding against his skin, trying to get out. Or maybe that’s his heartbeat. Not the basement.

 

Father opens his mouth. “Don’t make me repeat myself.”

 

Izuku flinches backwards.

 

He doesn’t want to move but his body’s on autopilot, taking him to the door beneath the stairs. He watches as his hand opens the heavy door—too heavy to be wood despite its appearance. It’s been years since he’s been down here. Years since he’s been locked down here. He opens the door. He’d nearly forgotten how strong the smell of bleach is. The lights turn on, white LEDs so bright Izuku has to close his eyes. Izuku steps onto the first step.

 

The door begins creaking shut and Izuku has to bite down bile, bite down his urge to run away. He can’t run away. His father is waiting for him up there.

 

Father calls, “While you’re down there, learn to control that Empathy quirk before I take it back. I may be blind, but I’m not an idiot.”

 

The door slams shut. The lights turn off. All Izuku hears is the heavy clanking of locks.

 

- - -

 

Shouta throws open the door to Nedzu’s office. He can’t take it anymore.

 

Nedzu perks up upon his arrival, flashing a big smile.

 

Shouta states, “I am formally requesting that a UA staff member meet with Midoriya Hisashi as soon as possible.”

 

Nedzu’s smile only widens. “I wonder what happened,” he says, even though Shouta is positive he knows exactly what happened. “Chiyo-chan just made the same request.”

 

“Good,” Shouta says.

 

“The moment Midoriya Izuku is confirmed to be at the training camp site, I will dispatch Naomasa-kun and Toshinori-kun to the Midoriya household.”

 

“Yagi?”

 

“As Izuku’s homeroom teacher will be indisposed, it makes the most sense to send the boy’s mentor.”

 

“Sure, but, Yagi?”

 

“Additionally, Toshinori-kun has met Midoriya-senior.”

 

Shouta flinches with his whole body. “He’s what?”

 

Nedzu holds up a paw. “Before you ask, he had very little meaningful insights regarding the experience.”

 

“So you’re sending him back to get even more meaningless insights?”

 

Nedzu laughs.

 

“At least send someone unbiased," Shouta suggests.

 

“Like who? Name one unbiased staff member.”

 

After a moment, Shouta stares at Nedzu. “You.”

 

Nedzu smiles. “Unfortunately, not even I have managed to remain unbiased in the face of Midoriya Izuku. Furthermore, I am ninety-three point seventeen percent positive that putting me in the same room as Hisashi would end well for nobody... Toshinori-kun is there to get Naomasa-kun through the door.”

 

Shouta huffs. Fine.

 

Nedzu picks up a flash drive and gently tosses it towards Shouta, who effortlessly catches it. He raises an eyebrow.

 

“This is exactly what I gave to Naomasa. It contains what little data I have on Midoriya Hisashi.”

 

That makes Shouta frown. He didn’t think there was a single person on the planet whom Nedzu didn’t have a disturbing amount of information on. It would be less concerning if Nedzu had information on Hisashi’s criminal record, or history of domestic abuse. 

 

“We will keep you updated, Shouta-kun."

 

- - -

 

The concentration of bleach is so strong his eyes can't stop watering. All Izuku can see is the white of the walls, the ceiling, the floor. There is absolutely nothing down here. No windows, no electrical outlets, no pipes—just Izuku. He paces the room, trailing his fingers against the cold, seamless cement.

 

He's trapped. His next breath catches in his throat. He's never getting out.

 

The last time he was down here, it was for two and a half weeks. There had been two gallons of water left for him. Now, there is nothing.

 

He’s been so spoiled. Getting grounded in his room might as well have been a vacation.

 

The pockets of his UA uniform are empty, save a piece of scrap paper, and the four sets of lockpicks he has on him are utterly useless. Even if he could access the lock from this side of the door, he’s positive it isn’t a traditional mechanical one. And then, even if he could pick it, he would not be able to walk through the dining room without his father noticing.

 

And, even then, does he really want to escape? If he’s caught, all that’ll do is push his punishment to another day and make it worse.

 

His fingers catch against a mark in the wall. Thin, surface level scratches. His fingertips burn with the memory.

 

That week, he tried so hard to get out, but no matter what he did it didn't matter. That week he lost four fingernails.

 

The memory of the sound echoes against the walls, worse than nails on chalkboard only because of the accompanying screams.

 

After a moment, they're drowned out by more pleasant voices.

 

See you at the summer camp.

 

We’re already friends.

 

 

Izuku takes a deep breath and tries to ignore the burning sensation that scratches at his throat. That’s right. Izuku is going to the training camp. He decided that already. No matter what happens, no matter what he has to do, even if it's impossible, he’s going to the training camp.

 

Izuku traces the marks on the wall.

 

No matter what it takes.

 

He promised Ochako and Shouto and Hitoshi.

 

He walks to the northmost wall, the only one that lines up with the perimeter of the house. If he were one floor up, he’d be facing the backdoor. If he were one floor up, he could take a step out and into the backyard.

 

But he is not one floor up.

 

Izuku breathes in and out. His breaths are shaky, but he holds onto them. As long as he’s still breathing, as long as he’s still alive, he’ll be okay.

 

He has to be.

 

He solidifies One for All against his skin like a layer of armor.

 

He is not nine years old anymore. He is not powerless. He is not alone.

 

Midoriya Izuku is a hero.

 

He punches. His knuckles crunch against the concrete, bones shattering, but Regeneration fixes them. His arm glows green and he punches again. Cracks spiderweb across the wall and his bones. He punches again. It is not quiet, but Izuku knows intimately how soundproofed this room is. He punches again. A chunk of concrete breaks off as his pinky snaps back in place. He punches again. It hurts, but not as much as it would hurt to spend the next week down here, to abandon his friends. He punches again. The jagged edges of broken wall scrape against his skin, but his knuckles hit something soft.

 

Dirt.

 

He grabs onto the exposed edges of the wall. With a combination of Pull and bloodied fingertips, he makes a hole in the concrete big enough to walk through. Behind is dirt and clay, packed too tightly.

 

He holds his breath and trusts in his healing quirk, trusts that it will not let him suffocate.

 

A young boy appears next to him, nothing more than a vague afterimage. He grabs Izuku’s hand. We can do it, the boy says. We can do it.

 

Izuku shovels at the dirt with his fingertips. It’s packed and hard but One for All sparks across Izuku’s body and he claws until it gives way. One or two or three or more of his fingernails snap off but they grow back instantly. He has no way to tell how much time is passing, but he doesn’t slow down.

 

He digs. He’s shoulder-deep in the dirt, has to keep his eyes and mouth squeezed shut but he doesn’t stop. He crawls through the dirt until he’s completely surrounded by it, head-to-toe, and his fingers crack against something hard and he’s stuck. He's trapped. Oh god what was he thinking he’s trapped. He’s going to die here. He hopes he dies here. Because if he doesn’t, Father is going to find him and the punishment will be worse than anything he’s endured before.

 

He opens his mouth to scream but a hand covers it, soft and familiar.

 

Izuku, a woman says. It’s okay, baby, we’ll take it from here. Go to sleep, you’ll need the rest for tomorrow.




 
Notes:

    y'all never should have let me listen to The Magnus Archives *and* take a class on writing horror... the first draft of this chapter was like 10 times more horrific than this lol

    also! my favorite scenes from this chapter include: "Sick in the head?" and "I'll be honest with you" / "which is never a good sign"

    Next up: summer camp...?

Chapter 33: The best lies are based on the truth
Notes:

    Chapter title is a quote from Cassandra Clare.

    I can't think of any specific warnings, but there are Words as Weapons-typical depictions of anxiety, trauma, and abuse. Instead of a specific warning, I'll give you a heads up! I cried while writing the final scene of this chapter :)

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

Izuku awakens slowly, letting the comfortable warmth of the sun lull him into consciousness. For a blissful moment, he feels safe. The smell of fresh air is so much more pleasant than the harsh bleach of his home. But it doesn’t take long for awareness to shoot him awake. He breathes too deeply, too fast. His breath catches in his throat. The air sticks. He chokes on something chalky, then sputters out brown dust. Dirt.

 

He is no longer in the basement. He’s on a rooftop in downtown Mustafa. Based on the orange of the sunrise it’s around seven in the morning and he’s going to be late. Oh god, he’s going to be late.

 

His heart pounds against his chest. Izuku spins around in desperate circles, trying to find his bearings. Where is he? He is no longer in the basement, but he doesn’t know where he is. How did he get here? He can’t be late, not today. He promised.

 

The skyline is a blur of orange and gray. He’s so tired. Every breath takes effort, as he still coughs up dust. He can’t be late. He pauses, closes his eyes, and takes as deep a breath as he can. In. Out. Inhaling just as much dust as air.

 

He opens his eyes.

 

There—two blocks south is UA’s campus.

 

Izuku sprints to the stairs, the quick action dizzying him. He nearly runs into the door, catches himself on the knob. When did he last eat? Did he even have dinner last night? He can’t remember. The doorknob refuses to turn—locked. He could break it down, but he has no idea what building this is, what he’d be walking through. How’d he get here, again? He doesn’t have time to ponder the question. First, he needs to get to UA. Once he’s on that bus, once he’s on his way to the training camp, then he can worry about it.

 

He walks to the edge of the roof, still struggling to breathe right, vision refusing to focus, and looks down.

 

The drop is eight, or maybe even nine floors.

 

Izuku's never been especially afraid of heights, but looking past his toes to the flat asphalt makes his stomach turn.

 

It’s alright. He can do this. He did this during his internship with Gran Torino. Sort of. The buildings were much, much shorter, and Izuku wasn’t alone.

 

You aren’t alone.

 

Sure, he has his quirks, but there’s only so much they can do if he falls nine stories.

 

He swallows, slowly sits down on the edge, feet dangling. He grips the edge of the wall, afraid he’ll get dizzy again and tumble over. It’s just like climbing a tree, or a rockwall, both of which he is fully capable of doing.

 

He takes a deep breath in and lets another out, but his heart rate refuses to lower, pounding incessantly against his chest. How the hell did he get up here? He remembers the basement. The Dirt. The makeshift tunnel. Remembers a voice. At least one voice. Then nothing. What happened after he passed out? Did someone find him? Did he dig all that way? Did anyone see? Oh god, does his father know he left? He's gonna be expelled. He's gonna lose all his quirks even worse he's gonna lose all his friends.

 

A hand slides into his, warm and comforting.

 

I got you, a woman says. All Izuku can see is her soft smile, shoulder-length black hair, and the yellow glove holding his hand. I’ll catch you. Promise.

 

Izuku nods, smiles, and silently says, thank you.

 

He grips the hand tighter, and just focuses on his breathing until he stops shaking. Then, he turns around, and starts climbing down. The hand never leaves. It is right beneath him, ready to catch him. Izuku knows this even if he can’t see it.

 

He doesn’t need it. He makes it down the nine stories safely.

 

Once his feet find solid ground his legs threaten to give out like jelly, but a boy, young and bald, catches him, and says with the same voice as the woman, We got you.

 

The green sparks of Regeneration settle across his skin until Izuku can feel his legs again, until his breaths come naturally, and his heart relaxes. He feels better. Not great, but good enough to jog to UA.

 

On the short trip, Izuku tries to figure out what he's going to tell everybody, but his brain is so jumbled. Distracted by the hazy memories of last night, all the questions he still has. He's too tired to think right, his thoughts floating away from him, refusing to sit still. Regeneration still hums beneath his skin, but this isn't an injury it can fix. What is he going to tell them? Maybe no one will notice. He's managed to brush off a good portion of the dirt and dust, but there's still some left. What is he going to tell them? How did he get on that rooftop? Does Father know?

 

The closer he gets to UA the faster his heart beats, the harder it is to hold onto his thoughts. It will be fine. It has to be. He promised he'd be at the summer camp, no matter what. So, no matter what, he'll be going.

 

It isn't until he steps through the UA gates and makes out the purple of Hitoshi's hair that he knows what he's going to say.

 

Midoriya Izuku is not alone.

 

- - -

 

Shouta still has mixed feelings about this training camp. It’s too late to do anything about it, though, so Shouta rebels by letting Yaoyorozu and Iida steal his job of wrangling the class. Laying on the top of the bus fulfills his cat-like instincts, but more importantly, it gives him a perfect vantage point to watch his class from a distance. Luckily, Nemuri forced him to put on sunscreen this morning.

 

Shouta is half-asleep, which means he is fully aware of everything happening around him, but lacks any thoughts of his own. That is, until Todoroki and Shinsou walk through the entrance gates together. From this distance Shouta can just barely make out their faces, and to his absolute horror they’re both smiling.

 

Even worse, they’re both holding drinks from the same coffee shop, which carries implications Shouta has no desire to consider. For a brief moment, Shouta’s reminded of him and Hizashi in high school, but the moment passes quickly. Neither Todoroki or Shinsou fulfill the role of Hizashi. It’s more like if Shouta became best friends with himself, instead, which is impossible. He can't wrap his head around it.

 

Watching them together doesn’t help him at all, as they appear to exchange zero words, finding a spot still within eye-sight, but pretty distanced from the rest of the class. Uraraka seems to consider approaching them, but decides (smartly) against it, returning to a conversation with Aoyama and Kouda.

 

And then Midoriya walks through the campus gate.

 

Shouta is on his feet and across the lawn before he can fully process the action. Heart in his throat, capture weapons in hand. Midoriya is caked in a thick layer of dirt, from head-to-toe. Up close, it looks even worse. It’s in his hair, down to the scalp, underneath his fingernails, in his ears.

 

“Are you alright?” he asks quickly, but hushed. He’s afraid that if he’s too loud he’ll scare Midoriya away. He looks past Midoriya, to the public street and buildings, looking for a villain or—“What happened?”—anything to explain why the problem child isn’t at least half-an-hour early, as he always is, and is absolutely covered in dirt.

 

Midoriya looks at him with an expression Shouta can’t identify. He tries to wait patiently, but the pounding of his heart hurts his ears. Then Midoriya chuckles, a quiet sound that could be mistaken for a hiccup, which quickly devolves into laughter. It’s one of those laughs that, if you were to hear it from another room, you might mistake it for sobbing.

 

Midoriya’s laugh dies down, and he says, “Sorry, Sensei, it’s just—you looked so serious.”

 

Of course he looks fucking serious. "Are you alright?" Shouta asks again.

 

"Yes, of course," Midoriya answers, and Shouta remembers that it is pointless to ask Midoriya that question. So instead he asks, "What happened?" and tries to ignore the shaking in his voice.

 

Midoriya looks unhurt. There is no discernable villain chasing after him, or watching him from the alleyway. Shouta is sure that if there were, Nedzu has taken care of it already. Midoriya is in no immediate danger. He is behind UA's walls. He is safe. He is telling Shouta that he is fine. Shouta does not believe him, but it is comforting nonetheless.

 

He takes a deep breath. He needs to think about this rationally. There is no point in getting emotional now. He can do that later, once they're all safe at the training camp. "What happened," Shouta repeats.

 

Somehow, Midoriya manages to say the last thing Shouta was expecting: “It was just a prank.”

 

A prank? Does Midoriya really think Shouta will believe that? What kind of prank? Who pranked him?  Why?

 

Rationally. Shouta takes a deep breath. He needs to think rationally.

 

He settles on asking, “Who?”

 

Midoriya pouts. The relaxed, calm, childish expression on his face makes him look fourteen. It might be the first time Shouta's ever looked at Midoriya and thought he looked his age. It calms Shouta down, just a little bit. He's seen Midoriya panic, on multiple occasions. This is not Midoryia panicking. Relative to his normal, Midoriya is probably fine. And if he isn't, that is something Shouta can address once he's sure there is no action he needs to take now.

 

Midoriya says, “I don’t want to get anyone in trouble.”

 

Please get someone in trouble, Shouta silently begs. He hopes Midoriya says something like my dad, only so Shouta can text Tsukauchi that his visit is no longer a friendly one.

 

Shouta stares at him. “Who?” he repeats.

 

“Promise they won’t be in trouble.”

 

“As long as no one is in any danger, no one will be in trouble. Who?”

 

Midoriya says, “Hitoshi.”

 

Shouta is so shocked he almost laughs. Hitoshi? Shinsou Hitoshi? He doesn't believe it, but then he reflexively turns around, sees Shinsou standing next to Todoroki, just as he was a minute ago. Shouta can't help but think: if anyone was going to be pranking someone, it would be Shinsou, wouldn't it?

 

Is this what Shouta gets for letting the boy intern with Ms. Joke?

 

But this is—what kind of prank looks like this?

 

“It was my idea,” Midoriya continues. “It ended up being pretty funny, actually. You should’ve—”

 

Shouta doesn’t let Midoriya continue. He can’t. He can't trust Midoriya to tell the truth. He can't imagine what Midoriya would be covering up, or how this lie helps him, but he can't communicate with Midoriya like this.

 

He turns to the rest of the class and calls, “Shinsou, get over here.” After a moment, Shinsou starts walking over, but Shouta stops him. “No, wait.” He looks back at Midoriya. He can’t talk to Shinsou with Midoriya right there. He needs to hear Shinsou’s story without any of Midoriya’s influence. He can’t believe Midoriya, but if Shinsou tells the same story Midoriya does without ever hearing it, maybe he can.

 

Shouta doesn’t want to leave Midoriya alone. So he turns back to the class and says, “Uraraka and Iida, join Midoriya. Shinsou, stay there. I’ll come to you.”

Eraserhead starts herding Hitoshi away from the loose crowd of kids, who’ve grown quiet in response to the unusual bite in their teacher's voice. Hitoshi wants to hold his ground, wants to reply with a sharp no like he did the last time Eraserhead called him out, but Izuku is signing something. He’s pretty far away, so it’s not easy to make out. Something about a prank. Izuku looks at Hitoshi with an expression he can just barely identify—he looks how he does during their lunchtime “trainings”. Worse, he looks how he did during dinner.

 

Enough pieces fall into place for Hitoshi to morph his scowl into a smirk. He pranked Izuku. Alright. He can do this. He will do this. He isn’t exactly sure what he’s doing or why, but Hitoshi can lie for Izuku. He can move onto Unit 2 of his lessons. He can protect Izuku from Eraserhead.

 

Hitoshi follows Eraserhead without complaint and even footsteps trail behind him. Hitoshi turns to find Shouto. After a moment of deliberation, he makes eye contact with Shouto and shakes his head. Shouto stops in his tracks and nods once.

 

Eraserhead stops far enough from the rest of the class that they’re all in eye-sight, but shouldn’t be able to hear their conversation. Eraserhead stares him down with an intensity that has Hitoshi stopping an awkward distance away—just a little too far for comfortable conversation—and crossing his arms. “What?”

 

Eraserhead cuts straight to it. “Tell me what happened.”

 

Hitoshi snorts to give himself time to think. That is the question, isn’t it? What happened? And Hitoshi is curious, terrified, but also curious about what actually happened to Izuku. But that isn’t important right now, because Izuku just asked Hitoshi to lie for him. Not in so many words, of course, but Hitoshi got the memo nonetheless.

 

The best lies are based on the truth. If he’s learned anything from Ms. Joke and Izuku, it’s that. So, this time Hitoshi will play the part of himself, but a little to the left. He'll play the part of the Shinsou Hitoshi Izuku needs right.

 

“I plead the fifth,” Hitoshi says.

 

“This is Japan, not America," Eraserhead states.

 

“Fine,” Hitoshi retorts. “I plead Article 38.”

 

Eraserhead scowls. “This is not a joking matter.”

 

Hitoshi stifles a fake laugh, which is harder than it sounds. “Actually, I’m pretty sure it is.”

 

“Tell me what happened.”

 

Hitoshi crosses his arms. It’s quite obvious, now, that he’s the one in power here. Eraserhead has no idea what’s going on. And, technically, neither does Hitoshi, but he can pretend he knows. He can give Eraserhead exactly what he wants. “Why should I tell you?”

 

Eraserhead looks at him for a moment, then says, "It’s perfectly fine to tell me that you don’t know what happened." While Eraserhead's managed to neutralize pretty much every ounce of emotion from his voice, Hitoshi still gets the impression that that is what Eraserhead wants him to say, or at least expects him to. Whatever Izuku told him, Eraserhead did not believe it.

 

Hitoshi splits his face into a smile, this one the disturbing love child of Ms. Joke and Nedzu. “What did you think Ms. Joke was teaching me over the past week?”

 

Eraserhead flinches, just barely. It’s so subtle Hitoshi almost misses it, but it’s nowhere near as subtle as Izuku’s flinches. “Elaborate,” Eraserhead orders.

 

The best lie is based on the truth. “I was practicing,” Hitoshi says, and then says nothing else, for no reason other than to annoy the man.

 

Eraserhead growls under his breath.

 

Hitoshi laughs. “Midoriya said it was time I graduated from our lunch-time lessons.”

 

“Your what?” Eraserhead asks with the most emotion he's shown yet. His eyes are wide and his mouth stays open a little longer than it should.

 

And that's when Hitoshi knows he's won. He's got this in the bag. "Oh, you didn’t know?” he asks, with a sharp undercut of mockery. “Midoriya’s been helping me out with my quirk during lunch. We play this game where one of us must stay silent and the other has to get them to talk. We’ve been alternating roles each day. I’ve only won once, but I guess he thought I was ready.” That last sentence was a straight-up lie. Hitoshi's never beaten Izuku in that game, and he expects he never will.

 

Eraserhead frowns, opens his mouth, then closes it again. After a moment of furrowed eyebrows, he says, “What exactly did you do to have Midoriya looking like that?”

 

And this is the challenge. Hitoshi peaks over Eraserhead’s shoulder, but Izuku is trapped in conversation with Iida and Uraraka. Hitoshi’s heart beats against his chest. The adrenaline rush is, for once, exhilarating. Any residue of his social anxiety is gone, replaced with an intoxicating thrill. He’s going to get away with it.

 

He’s going to lie to Eraserhead: an adult, a teacher, a fucking pro hero, and get away with it.

 

“It was just a prank,” Hitoshi states.

 

And for some reason, at that, Eraserhead relaxes, just enough to lower his shoulders, but he still looks expectant so Hitoshi continues, “What more do you want from me? A twelve-page essay? A three hour-long HeroTalk?” Hitoshi smirks, pulls out his phone and shows Eraserhead the home screen. “The bus is supposed to leave four minutes ago.”

 

Eraserhead doesn't budge. He stares at Hitoshi with a flat expression. “You’re telling me that you pranked Midoriya, of your own volition.”

 

“Yup.”

 

Eraserhead smiles, all teeth, and anxiety rushes over Hitoshi so fast he forgets to breathe. All the previous elation gone, the void filled immediately with fear. Eraserhead’s caught him. He knows.

 

Erasehead looks him in the eyes and says, “Why in hell would Shinsou Hitoshi take responsibility for that?”

 

Shit. He’s right. The Shinsou Hitoshi of two weeks—no, two days—ago would have been entirely uncooperative, wouldn’t have given Eraserhead an inch. But Hitoshi is no longer that boy and the best lie is based on the truth. Hitoshi meets Eraserhead’s gaze and smiles back. Except this time his smile is soft, closer to what he thinks his face would look like if he were to actual experience happiness. He says, “Because Izuku is my friend.”

 

Eraserhead watches him for another moment before closing his eyes and sighing. "Fine," he says. “Fine. We’ll continue this discussion later. If I find out you’re lying in any way, there will be consequences.” With that, Eraserhead walks back to Izuku. Hitoshi looks at Izuku, nods once, then turns and makes his way to Shouto.

 

- - -

 

Shouta wants to drag Midoriya into Hound Dog’s office and make him talk. But he knows that would accomplish nothing. In actuality, it would probably do the opposite of what he wants—push Midoriya further away. Alternatively, he also wants to storm Nedzu's office and insist the principal do something. But Shouta's already done that. Yagi and Tsukauchi are on their way to Midoriya Hisashi right now. That's the only reason Shouta feels comfortable going to the training camp like this. There’s nothing more he can do right now, except offer Midoriya support and keep a close eye on him.

 

- - -

 

Tenya hates this. Hates all this unknowing. He doesn’t have enough information to make the simplest of decisions. He doesn’t even know if mentioning Midoriya’s state of dress is a good idea or not. He hates this. He wants to consult Todoroki, but he wouldn’t know what to say.

 

Tenya, yet again, is infinitely grateful that Uraraka exists. She’s effortlessly engaged Midoriya in a conversation about the training camp—what they think the schedule might look like, as Aizawa’s yet to give them that information. Yet another thing Tenya does not know.

 

He hates this.

 

But then Uraraka asks him how he wants to train his quirk, and Tenya smiles, and he adjusts his glasses. They continue chatting about training for a couple minutes, until Aizawa walks over. “Midoriya, go wash up,” he says. “Be quick about it.”

 

“I’m fine,” Midoriya says. “It’ll take too much time. We’re already behind schedule.”

 

“You are not a burden to anybody,” Aizawa says with that same matter-of-fact tone. “I will not force you, but there is time for you to clean yourself up.”

 

“I’m fine,” Midoriya repeats, as if the more he says it the more any of them will believe it. Of course, it is the opposite that is true. “I’ll take a bath and change once we get to the training camp.”

 

"I am here for you," Aizawa continues. "If you ever want to talk, I'll be here." Then Aizawa turns around without another word, and walks to the bus. They all follow him, and Midoriya asks, “Iida-kun, do you want us all to line up before we get on the bus?”

 

Tenya smiles and raises one of his hands, then chops it back down. “Why, of course! It is the prudent decision to organize ourselves to minimize chaos!”

 

It’s alright. Tenya doesn’t have to know everything. He just has to be here for his friends.

Momo has always existed on the outskirts of social circles. She walks the perimeters of them, without ever stepping inside. She’s never minded this, really, but that is probably because she is not positive what she is missing out on. Anyway, walking the perimeters allows her to travel between circles, rather than be constrained to a single one. She likes to consider it one of her strengths. She gets along with everybody. She recognizes that this is an absolute, but she does not make that claim without evidence. She has, quite literally, never met someone she didn’t get along with. Now, this does of course exclude villains like Shigaraki Tomura or Stain, but she’d argue that she’s never actually met either one. She’s never interacted face-to-face with either, nor exchanged a single word. So, Momo’s point still stands.

 

However, while she can get along with everybody, she’s never had a single close friend. She’d hoped, idly, and only in the theoretical, that UA would be different, but it’s not. This is how she finds herself on the bus, sitting next to Iida, across from Shinsou and Todoroki, and behind Midoriya and Uraraka. This is how she overhears Uraraka ask Midoriya, with a gentle, soft quiet, “Midori, where’s your bag?”

 

For the shortest of moments Midoriya freezes, then he laughs an awkward, self-deprecating laugh.

 

To Momo’s surprise, Shinsou speaks up. “That’s totally my bad,” he says, but he doesn’t sound apologetic at all, nor does he look it with that sharp smile on his face. “I pawned it for fifty bucks.”

 

Momo has no idea if he’s being serious or sarcastic, and from the resounding silence filling their two rows, she gets the sense that no one else can, either. But then Iida speaks up. “Only fifty dollars?" He asks. "Shinsou-san, I regret to inform you of this, but you have been scammed.”

 

And then, after a moment of silence, everyone starts laughing. Momo, Midoriya, and Uraraka. Shinsou even lets himself smile, and although she can’t see him from this angle, Momo expects Todoroki has as well. Iida watches them all for a moment then breaks into laughter, as well.

 

As the laughter dies down, Momo tries to shut down her anxiety that they don’t care about her. That the only reason she’s sitting with them is because Iida happened to sit next to her. That if she spoke up right now she’d just be a bother. No, none of that matters, even if it's true, because this is something only Momo can do, so she’s going to do it.

 

“I got this,” Momo says with a smile. “Iida-san, will you please read me the packing list?”

 

Iida raises an eyebrow, but he does it anyway. “Sleeping bag,” he says, and Momo forms the necessary atoms, then the materials, then the sleeping bag itself, and pulls it out of her skin.

 

Iida’s smile is big and honest, and Uraraka’s matches. Midoriya’s is softer, but just as grateful. He starts to tell her that she doesn’t need to do this, but Uraraka interrupts him with a playful, gentle slap to his shoulder. Then she turns around to look Momo in the eyes and say, “Thank you so much, Yao!”

 

Momo tries to suppress the warmth fluttering into her cheeks. It’s the first time she’s ever been called a nickname.

 

Iida continues reading the packing list, and Momo creates something for each one. Every time, Uraraka and Midoriya tell her thank you, until Midoriya falls asleep with his head on Uraraka's shoulder. Then Uraraka's appreciations turn into silent gestures Momo vaguely recognizes, as Kouda and Midoriya have used them before.

 

Maybe, just maybe, Momo can step past the perimeter and into this circle.



 
Notes:

    Haha, gotcha! I starting crying while writing the final scene because it was so wholesome :P this is the first positive ending to a chapter we've had in a long time (or at least it feels that way to me!) also - first Momo POV! I wasn’t planning on ever having one of her POV’s in this fic but then bam! it happened and I loved it

    for those of you begging me for the horrific draft of the previous chapter, I have good news and bad news. Bad news: that draft only exists in my head, so it would take more work to share it than I think it's worth. Good news: I will instead share with you three drafts of the USJ incident (chapters 13-14 in Words as Weapons I think) which were at least 10x more horrific than the posted chapters :D you can read those here: https://archiveofourown.org/works/41410818/chapters/103847478

Chapter Text

It is quiet. There is no hum of air conditioning, or the usual persistent beeping of his father’s medical equipment. Izuku can just maybe hear the cricket chirp of bugs, but he could be imagining it. It smells like fresh air. Then,

 

“How’d you sleep?”

 

Izuku is on a bus. That’s right. They’re on their way to the training camp. But, the bus is stopped and empty except for Aizawa, who’s sprawled in the seat across from Izuku, wrapped up in his yellow sleeping bag.

 

“Where’d everyone go?” Izuku asks. He sits up from the position he'd slept in: slouched against the window.

 

Instead of answering, Aizawa asks, “How’d you sleep?”

 

“Fine,” Izuku answers. “I slept pretty well.” Every muscle in his body screams with soreness, but he had no nightmares, so he isn’t lying. He slept pretty well.

 

Izuku starts to stand up, mainly because he wants to stretch, but Aizawa says, “We’re not in a rush.”

 

Izuku frowns, but doesn’t leave his seat.

 

After a moment, Aizawa finally tells him, “The rest of class is walking to the camp facilities.”

 

A subtle tension wraps around Izuku's heart. “Why didn’t anyone wake me up? How far away are they? I can catch up.”

 

“They left five hours ago.”

 

Five hours ago

 

“This is a very reasonable activity,” Hitoshi says, voice dripping with sarcasm. He stands at the edge of the street, arms crossed, glaring at the chaos in the forest. Next to him, Shouto stands completely still and expressionless.

 

“Considering how many encounters you all have had with actual villains, we don’t have the privilege of being reasonable,” Eraserhead states.

 

Everyone else has already begun storming through the forest. Uraraka had tried to pull an Izuku and get everyone to stick together, to take a beat and team up, but she lacks his confidence--his charisma--and so they all bounded down the mountainside without hesitation. Except for Hitoshi and, by proxy, Shouto.

 

Hitoshi lets out a heavy sigh. This is unachievable for him. There’s no way his stamina will last at a jog for that long, and at his normal walking speed it would probably take him nearly ten hours to cross that distance. He sighs, again. He’s already so tired. He's always tired.

 

He can feel someone looking at him. Eraserhead, probably, but Hitoshi doesn’t turn away from the chaotic tree line.

 

“Shinsou-kun,” Eraserhead says in a tone not unlike the one he used this morning to interrogate him. “We should talk. You can take the bus to the campsite with us.”

 

Hitoshi bristles, feels his abdomen clench with tension. There’s no way in hell he’s doing that. The last thing he wants is to be underestimated, pitied. He’d rather crawl to the campsite on his hands and knees then take the easy route out--than be babied.

 

If Eraserhead was anyone other than his favorite hero he’d say fuck off, but Eraserhead is his favorite hero so Hitoshi instead waves at Shouto and says, “Let’s go.”

 

Shouto doesn’t spare a second. He paints the mountainside with ice and jumps, gliding down like it’s a slide except on his two feet. Could Hitoshi do that, too? Will he be able to balance? His alternative is shuffling down in a half-climb, and that by itself would take way too long, and be way too embarassing.

 

“Shinsou-kun,” Eraserhead says, again. “All I want is the best for you and Midoriya.”

 

Decision made. Hitoshi raises a middle finger as he jumps onto Shouto’s slide, just barely managing to catch his balance by dropping into a crouch. The soles of his Converse glide against the smooth ice. It’s been a while since he did anything like this. He used to navigate the streets of Mustafa on a skateboard, until someone snapped it in half over his skull.

 

Air breezes past his face, hitting him with a refreshing cool. Husks of the man-made “enemies” litter the path on either side, some freezer burnt and others charred.

 

Fuck. His hands clench into fists at his side as his shoes catch on something and he nearly topples over. Fuck. He could never do that. He’ll never be able to do anything like this. That sheer output of power. Could he even take down a single one of these things? They aren’t human, won’t respond to any of his dialogue, and he’s never fought anything bigger than a normal man before. And Shouto’s disabled how many already? Izuku and Shouto are both capable of so much and Hitoshi--Hitoshi isn’t even good as good as Izuku at the one thing he has to be: talking.

 

Fuck. How did Hitoshi even make it into the hero course? On some rando’s recommendation?

 

He growls. God damnit. This isn’t the way he wants to be thinking about his friends. He doesn't want to be thinking these things so he shoves them down into a dark cubbyhole in the back of his mind. He'll just ignore them. He distracts himself by focusing on the wind hitting his face and watching Shouto's back as gravity tugs them both down the hillside. But then Shouto stops and Hitoshi nearly runs into him, only managing to slow himself down by grabbing onto a tree branch.

 

Shouto looks at him with a blank stare that somehow manages to be incredibly intense. “Can you ice skate?” he asks.

 

“Yeah,” Hitoshi says, and it’s only half a lie. He’s roller bladed before, and wasn’t half-bad, but he’s always preferred the solidity of a skateboard.

 

Shouto points down, at his feet, where he’s applied on ice skates literally made out of ice. Then he points at Hitoshi’s feet.

 

Hitoshi’s whole body tenses. “I don’t need your help,” he growls before he can stop himself.

 

He regrets it immediately, guilt curdling his stomach. He looks away, turn around so he doesn’t have to face Shouto. He hates himself, sometimes. Oftentimes. A lot of times.

 

Shouto doesn't say anything so Hitoshi asks, quietly, “Why do you tolerate me?” He’s a terrible friend, a terrible human being. He can’t be a good hero, let alone a good person. He can’t do anything for Izuku other than lie for him. He can’t even be relatively nice to Shouto.

 

“Because we’re friends,” Shouto says, matter-of-factly, like Hitoshi didn’t just spit on his kindness.

 

“Why in hell would you be my friend?” Hitoshi whispers. A wetness collects at the corner of his eyes. Fuck. Goddammit. What is he doing here?

 

After a moment of listening to the vague sounds of combat surrounding them, Shouto says, “I don’t know.”

 

Hitoshi spins around to see Shouto looking exactly as he always does.

 

“Do I need a reason?” Shouto asks, and he sounds genuinely curious, like he really doesn’t know. And then he begins, slowly, “I suppose... I trust you.”

 

Shouto is so authentic it shocks Hitoshi into a serene calmness.

 

Hitoshi lets out another sigh, but this one falls between a smile. “You’re an idiot," he says, and he means them both.

 

“Most likely.”

 

Hitoshi lets out a snort, then says, serious, “I’m sorry. I’m not used to...” he waves a hand vaguely. “Having friends.”

 

“Me neither,” Shouto responds.

 

“Guess we’ll both have to figure it out the hard way, then.”

 

Shouto nods, once, then points at Hitoshi’s feet again.

 

“Yeah, yeah, go for it,” Hitoshi says, as he balances on his left foot, holding his right one up.

 

When Shouto finishes, Hitoshi stands up straight, only to promptly lose his balance. Shouto catches him with a hand on either shoulder, and Hitoshi is forced to realize that they’re practically the same height--with Shouto’s face barely inches from his own.

 

Because he can’t help it, Hitoshi looks into Shouto’s eyes and says, “Hot.”

 

Shouto frowns in confusion, then says, “It’s cold. We’re surrounded by ice."

 

Hitoshi lets out a laugh that doesn’t stop, nearly falling over again. By the time he gathers his bearings, Shouto is smiling. Shouto lets go of his shoulders and Hitoshi manages to find his balance.

 

“But, seriously,” Hitoshi starts. “If I’m ever an asshole to you, just let me know. I want to be a good friend.”

 

“Okay,” Shouto says.

 

“Now let's beat those other losers to the campsite.”

 

Present

 

“Five hours?” Midoriya mouths, the words coming out silent. Shouta’s a pretty fluent lip-reader. When you live with Hizashi, you don’t really have any other choice.

 

Midoriya looks a little confused--lips pursed and eyebrows twisted. It’s very rare that Midoriya lets such an expression on his face, and it makes Shouta question: why now? What is different about this situation that Midoriya either a) feels comfortable showing such emotion or b) doesn’t realize that he’s showing it?

 

Reflection can occur at a later time, though. Now, Shouta’s priority is making Midoriya feel safe and comfortable.

 

Shouta continues, “Everyone agreed that you should get as much rest as you can.”

 

Well, everyone who spoke up. Bakugou in particular had looked unsatisfied at the decision, and in conjunction with his disposition and some of his previous actions, poses another issue to add to Shouta’s neverending list of things he needs to address post-camp.

 

Midoriya says, quietly, “I don’t need special treatment.”

 

Shouta watches him from half-lidded eyes. Did Shinsou really prank him? Midoriya’s looked unusually small since this morning, and his exhaustion is doubly concerning. “This isn’t special treatment,” Shouta tells him. “If another student was obviously sleep deprived and prone to overworking themself, I would have done the same thing. I offered Shinsou a ride back."

 

Midoriya does not look satisfied with that answer, and Shouta suspects he will not be satisfied until given something to do, so, “I expect they’ll start arriving in a couple hours. You’re going to clean yourself up, then if you’re bored, you can help us prepare their dinner.”

 

Midoriya brightens immediately. “Okay! I could start now, actually! I don’t need--” but Shouta levels him with a soft glare. After another moment, Midoriya says, “Alright. I’ll shower and change, first. How far away are we from the campsite?”

 

“We’re already here.”



 

The Cats had wanted to help prepare dinner, but understood when Shouta said he didn’t want to overwhelm Midoriya. So, Shouta waits on a stool next to the kitchen island, collapsed against the countertop, resting his head on his crossed arms and not sleeping. 

 

Midoriya steps into the kitchen and immediately stands up straighter. For the first time today, his smile appears to actually reach his eyes. His hair is still a little damp, only exacerbating his ratsnest of curls, and he wears a button down over sweatpants--an interesting combination that is somehow perfectly Midoriya.

 

“What are we going to make?” Midoriya asks.

 

Shouta shrugs without getting up. “Whatever you want. We’ve stocked up on ingredients, but if there’s anything else you need, Mandalay will grab it. We just need food for twenty-five people.”

 

“Twenty-five people,” Midoriya whispers, drifting off. He doesn’t hesitate to familiarize himself with the kitchen, starting with the refrigerator and the pantry. He begins mumbling under his breath, so quiet that it takes Shouta nearly half a minute to recognize the sounds as words, and even then he can only make out a couple: rice, paprika, garlic, for instance.

 

Shouta didn’t know Midoriya mumbled. The boy was always so put-together, so intentional about which parts of him others saw. This is not that. This is an authenticity Shouta was not expecting. He does not want to break the spell, but he doesn’t want to force Midoriya to make the whole meal by himself. Shouta compromises by quietly saying, “You like cooking.”

 

Midoriya flinches, pauses for barely a moment before continuing to gather what tools and ingredients he needs. “Yes,” he says, quietly. “Do you?”

 

No, Shouta almost says, but he doesn’t. That isn’t the full truth. He hates cooking by himself, but, “I enjoy it as a communal activity.” When they have time, when they all aren’t busy teaching or saving the world, Hizashi and/or Nemuri often drag him into the kitchen. None of them are any good at cooking, but with the right recipe they can make something edible--even occasionally something good.

 

Midoriya smiles at him. “I’m thinking about curry: one with beef and one vegan.” He places an onion on a cutting board then holds out a knife, handle towards Shouta. “Would you like to cut the onions?”

 

Shouta smiles softly and uncurls himself, like a cat, to his feet. He steps around the island to take the knife. After a moment of deliberation, he says, “If you teach me how.”

 

“Of course!”

 

Shouta already knows how to dice onions, but he wants to get Midoriya talking.

 

Midoriya’s a pretty good teacher, which doesn’t surprise Shouta a single bit. He maintains a good balance of helpfulness without ever being condescending.

 

After Shouta’s diced the onions, he asks Midoriya about his process--how he can help--how much water he should use to cook the rice--how much paprika to add to the stew. He’s never seen anybody cook without a recipe before. Midoriya understands the ingredients and their chemistry with an impressive proficiency, and Shouta learns more about food in that half-hour than he ever has in his entire life.

 

Midoriya looks happy--relaxed--comfortable, smiling softly and floating around the kitchen with a relaxed ease, like for the first time since Shouta’s met him he isn’t worried about what other people think of him.

 

Shouta wants to ask--to push--but he doesn’t want to break this spell--but this might be the only chance he has to get through to Midoriya. Nothing he’s said up to this point has worked, but he doesn’t know what else to try. There’s only so many times he can tell Midoriya that he’s here for him, that he wants to help.

 

The oven clicks as it warms up and Shouta stops breathing.

 

The heat itches across his skin. He knows it isn’t that hot, not really, but he feels it anyway. He can’t help but be reminded of that convenience store. Of that villain. Momentarily he’s back there, melting into a puddle of sweat and failing to breathe. It’s hot. Shouta wants to die. He wants to kill someone.

 

He’s having a flashback. He takes a deep breath. He’s sweating, even though he knows the kitchen isn’t actually that hot. He’s at the lodge. The summer camp. He’s safe. He takes another deep breath, and calms down enough to become pissed at Nedzu. This is probably happening to him because Nedzu played that fucking video for Shinsou a couple weeks back. That seriously rehashed some stuff Shouta would have liked to forget.

 

Shouta takes another deep breath.

 

Asking Midoriya to talk to him hasn’t been working.

 

Shouta does not often opt-in to vulnerability. He has no qualms discussing his feelings, emotions, or experiences when prompted to, but very rarely does he initiate such interactions with anyone other than Hizashi or Nemuri. But he’s hit a wall with Midoriya, and it’s obvious that he isn’t getting anywhere—or, at least, he isn’t getting far enough fast enough. He cannot trust Shinsou's insistence that he pranked Midoriya, because he’s positive Shinsou doesn’t trust him. The boy could be covering for Izuku under the (absolutely false) presumption that any interference from Shouta would only make the situation worse. A sentiment that Shouta can, unfortunately, empathize with, but that is simultaneously 100% incorrect.

 

Talking about himself is not his strong suit, but maybe it would be helpful. Shouta walks up to the oven, raises his hands to feel the heat. It’s barely warm.

 

He’ll try it.

 

- - -

 

“I’ve fought a lot of villains,” Aizawa starts.

 

The nonsequitur catches him off guard, but Izuku continues grating the ginger nonetheless.

 

Aizawa continues, “There are some that my body won’t let me forget and others that my brain won't.”

 

Izuku doesn’t say anything even though his instinct is to ask a question. Or try to answer one that doesn’t exist. What does Aizawa want from him?

 

No. Nothing. Aizawa doesn't want anything specific from him, he’s made that very clear. Aizawa isn’t his father and there’s a quiet vulnerability in his teacher’s voice that Izuku’s never heard from him before. When Izuku turns, Aizawa’s back is to him, standing in front of the oven. “A few years back, I fought a man who called himself Run Hots. He wasn’t a particularly powerful villain in the grand scheme of things, but I still can’t forget him.”

 

Izuku has heard of the villain before, of course. There are very few villains in Mustafa that his father hasn’t had him research. The name is descriptive enough that Izuku can place his quirk instantly: his body temperature ran incredibly hot. It’s likely that Aizawa’s quirk would be useless against it, and thus Eraserhead would not have been well suited for such a fight.

 

A bead of sweat drips down the side of Izuku’s face. Is the kitchen getting hotter? Or is he just having an empathetic response to the idea of Aizawa trapped in the same room as Run Hots?

 

Aizawa continues, just as quietly and just as slowly, “He didn’t leave any scars, but... sometimes I wish he had. That way, I’d feel a little more justified when it still hurts.

 

Izuku doesn’t know what he’s thinking. His brain feels fuzzy, distant. He’s thinking too many thoughts but he’s also thinking none at all. What is he supposed to say? What does Aizawa-sensei want from him? He doesn’t know. He doesn’t know but he does know that Aizawa is being incredibly vulnerable with him, that this must not have been easy.

 

Izuku doesn’t know what he’s thinking when he says, so quietly he isn’t sure he’s actually said it out-loud, “Cooking’s always been my thing, for as long as I can remember.”

 

- - -

 

Shouta holds his breath. There’s something in Midoriya’s tone that sounds a little vulnerable--he’s quieter than he usually is, practically a whisper.

 

“The kitchen... the kitchen is where I’ve always felt safest,” Midoriya settles on. His smile is a little sad, but it’s honest, and Shouta recognizes this as the most honest Midoriya’s ever been to him.

 

“Thanks, kiddo,” Shouta whispers at the same volume as Midoriya. “For telling me.” He doesn’t say the million other things he wants to: you can tell me more, does that mean you don’t feel safe in the rest of your house? who is your father to you? I’m here for you, you don’t have to be okay. Instead, Shouta settles on, “You’re safe here,” and then he rustles Midoriya’s hair.

 

Midoriya freezes, and then he looks up at Shouta with a soft, honest smile.

 

And then, from outside the building, muffled but still perfectly audible, Mandalay yells, “Your kids are arriving, Shouta!”

 

- - -

 

The rest of Class 1-A arrives within a half-hour of each other, Shouto and Hitoshi first, while Uraraka, Iida, and Yaoyorozu took up the rear, probably collecting any stragglers and ensuring everyone made it to the campsite. Izuku feels a little out-of-place next to the rest of class. Everyone else is covered in dirt and sweat and little branches of trees and he’s wearing an apron. He should have been out there with them. What do they think of him? He didn’t mean to take the easy route out. If any one of them had woken him up he would’ve gone without complaint.

 

Before they can settle down to eat dinner on the picnic tables, Uraraka lets out an excited, “Oh!”, and points to one of the windows of the lodge. Izuku doesn’t see anything, but Mandalay starts clapping her hands before jogging inside. Barely half a minute later she comes out dragging a young kid who looks like this is the last place he wants to be.

 

She stops in front of their amorphous grouping on the lawn. “This is my cousin, Kouta!”

 

Kouta stands with his arms crossed over his chest and eyes fixed in a permanent glare. He says nothing, so Izuku walks closer to him, extends his hand, and says, “Hi, Kouta! It’s nice to meet you! My name’s Midoriya Izuku!”

 

Kouta takes a step forward, his eyes narrow even more, and he twists his mouth into a scowl. Izuku has more than enough time to dodge the kick to his crotch, twisting out of its way. All that accomplishes is Kouta letting out a half-scream in Izuku’s face, “Fuck you! You’re all fucking nuts! Calling yourselves heroes and villains or whatever and going around killing each other like idiots! All just to show off! Go fuck off, instead!”

 

There’s a beat of silence before someone starts slow-clapping and then Hitoshi deadpans, "Amen. Encore."

 

Everyone else remains silent, and Izuku’s trying to decide how best to apologize--what he even needs to apologize for--when Mandalay steps inbetween them and says, quietly, “Kouta-chan.”

 

Kouta just lets out a half-scream, half-growl and yells, “I hate you all!” then runs off into the woods.

 

Izuku starts to go after him, but Mandalay shakes her head. “It’s alright. He’s just going to the hillside--he needs space. His parents...”

 

Izuku frowns, but says nothing more than, “Water Hose.”

 

Mandalay smiles sadly. “Yeah.”

 

“Alright,” Aizawa says. “It’s already late enough as-is. Let’s eat. Midoriya made two curries: beef and vegan.”

 

“Aizawa-sensei helped!” Izuku makes sure to add on.

 

 

 

Izuku’s curries are both hits with the class, and he listens to their stories about the trek to the campsite. It was exhausting, but they were never in any real danger. Compared to USJ or the Hosu incident, it was a breeze. When everyone starts wrapping up, Izuku asks Mandalay, “Does Kouta have any dietary restrictions? He hasn’t come down yet; I’m gonna bring him some curry.”

 

“Oh, thank you, Midoriya-chan, but you don’t have to. I can do it.”

 

“It’s alright. I feel like I should apologize, anyway.”

 

Mandalay smiles. “You have nothing to apologize for, but no, he doesn’t. He’ll eat anything you put in front of him.”

 

“Perfect.” Midoriya says. He pours a serving of the beef curry into a to-go container, and fills another with rice. He stops by Aizawa, who’s spent dinner in his sleeping bag laid across one of the empty picnic tables. Izuku lets him know he’s going to find Kouta.

 

Aizawa doesn’t open his eyes to say, “Don’t go by yourself.”

 

Izuku’s about to insist that he’s fine when Hitoshi slides up next to him. “We’ll go.”

 

At that, Aizawa peels one of his eyes open to stare Hitoshi down for a moment, but then he lets out a sigh and says, “Fine. Be back before sunset.”

 

Hitoshi doesn’t respond, instead grabbing the tupperwares out of Izuku’s hand, stalking towards the mountain, and saying, “Let’s go.”

 

Shouto steadily walks up to follow Hitoshi. Izuku joins after telling Aizawa, “Thanks! We won’t be long!”

 

- - -

 

Izuku spends the walk pointlessly rambling, and Hitoshi recognizes it as a distraction tactic. It’ll take more than that to distract him, though.

 

Once they’re far enough from the lodge to have a semblance of privacy Hitoshi stops in his tracks and says, “So. What happened?

 

Izuku stops talking and stands still. “What do you mean?” Izuku finally asks, but it lacks the usual lightness Hitoshi’s come to expect from him. It sounds like he doesn’t mean it.

 

“I didn’t prank you, so what happened.”

 

“Nothing,” Izuku says, turning back to show off his smile, but it falls immediately and Hitoshi turns just enough to see Shouto clenching his jaw, the most expression Hitoshi’s seen from him in awhile.

 

Izuku must cave to Shouto’s expression because he adds on, “It wasn’t a big deal. I was just grounded.”

 

Grounded. And Hitosh can see, clear as day, Izuku stumbling onto UA campus, covered head-to-toe in dirt. Grounded. It was in his fucking hair. Grounded. Hitoshi lacks the self-control to not spit out, “What, six feet under in the fucking ground? ” Like ninety percent of what Hitoshi says, he’s simultaneously joking and perfectly serious.

 

Izuku pouts. “No, of course not. The basement,” Izuku clarifies, as if that’s a totally normal thing. It might be. Hitoshi’s never had a normal family before, but. The basement.

 

The basement.

 

The dirt was under Izuku's fucking fingernails.

 

Hitoshi should stop talking. He really should. But there’s this growing weight in his stomach and he fears if he doesn’t open his mouth right now he’ll never be able to fall asleep again. He’s mostly joking; he wants to be joking when he hisses, “And, what, you dug your way out?”

 

For a sharp, single moment which might as well have lasted an entire lifetime, Izuku hesitates. He stops breathing. His eyes widen and he just fails to stop himself from flinching backwards.

 

Hitoshi nearly trips despite standing perfectly still, and at first he expects it’s the classic combo of malnutrition, caffeine, and undiluted panic at realizing one of your only two friends had to literally dig his way out of his own fucking basement what the fuck--but then he looks down and the ground is frozen solid.

 

Shouto’s face is devoid of any expression, and yet he practically glows red with anger.

 

Izuku fixes a wide smile over his face but it’s too late. “No, of course not,” he says, again, even less convincing this time.

 

Hitoshi looks at Shouto, but Shouto’s hands are clenched in fists and Hitoshi’s afraid if anything startles him Shouto’s going to destroy something. So Hitoshi forces down nausea and says, quietly, “Midori... Izuku.” He doesn’t know what else to say. Hitoshi is massively underqualified for this. He’ll admit it. No hesitation this time. This is above his pay grade.

 

He has to tread a thin tight rope. He can’t push too hard or he’ll push Izuku away. He wants to say: you realize how fucked up that is, right? But he knows that will get them nowhere. So instead he asks, “Would you ever lock your kid in the basement?”

 

Izuku frowns, starts to shake his head then stops. “It’s different,” he says.

 

Hitoshi holds up a hand to stop Izuku. “I’m sorry but I don’t want to hear your rationalizations. Would you ever lock your own child in the basement? And if not, why? Don’t answer, just think about it.”

 

Izuku, surprisingly, stays quiet, and the ground finally thaws. Shouto takes a deep breath in and another out.

 

Hitoshi can only do two more things, here and now. “We’re here for you, Izuku,” he says, then nods to Shouto.

 

“Yes,” Shouto says, voice tense, but still as honest as always. “We’re your friends.”

 

Hitoshi’s final move is to try to smile and tell Izuku the same thing he told Shouto: “No pressure, but if you ever look to relocate, I know some legit five-star dumpsters that’d take you.”

 

Izuku’s smile softens into something a little more convincing. “Thanks,” he says, quietly, which Hitoshi considers a definite win. Izuku isn’t trying to convince them all it didn’t happen, or that he’s okay, which is significant progress. “Thank you, really,” Izuku continues. “Let’s find Kouta-kun.”

 

They spend the rest of the walk in silence until they reach a clearing at the top of the hill, Kouta standing near the edge of the cliff, tossing down pebbles.

 

“You guys wait back there, I’ll talk to him,” Hitoshi says.

 

“But--” Izuku starts.

 

“We don’t wanna overwhelm him. Consider this my Unit 3 exercise, or whatever we’re on, now.”

 

Izuku relents. “Alright. If you need any backup we’ll be here.”

 

- - -

 

Izuku and Shouto sit down next to each other on the log of a felled tree. They’re far enough from Hitoshi and Kouta that they can’t hear their conversation, but if one was to, say, start screaming, they’d be able to tell.

 

Izuku is quiet, and Shouto wonders if he should be trying to fill the silence. Even if he is, he knows himself well enough to know he’s incapable of doing so in a manner that would be beneficial to Izuku.

 

Shouto may not be able to make small talk, but there are other ways to provide company. Shouto may not be able to fill the silence, but he can hold out his left hand--the warmer one--towards Izuku and ask, “Would you like to hold hands?”

 

Izuku looks at him with wide eyes for a couple moments before squeezing his lips together, nodding, and intertwining his fingers with Shouto’s.

 

Shouto watches the leaves bristle and sway and turn in the wind. He’s content to stay like this, with one of his best friends, forever.

 

Izuku suddenly whispers, “I’m sorry,” and his voice sounds strained, wet, and then he takes a choked breath. He’s trying not to cry. “I’m sorry,” he says again. He drops his head to his knees and squeezes Shouto’s hand.

 

“You aren’t a burden,” Shouto says, squeezing back. “It’s alright to cry.”

 

Izuku does. His cries start out stifled, but after a few moments he gives in. In between sobs Izuku keeps whispering, “I’m sorry,” and each time Shouto tells him, “You have nothing to apologize for.”

 

Shouto can feel tears build in his own eyes. He feels so relieved. Like he can finally breathe. Izuku is finally letting himself feel--finally opening up to them. Maybe, one day soon, he’ll even ask for help. Real help.

 

Shouto feels so relieved and hopes this is just as relieving for Izuku, too.

 

When Izuku’s breathing starts to even out he whispers, barely loud enough for Shouto to hear: “I don’t remember. I don’t remember how I--got out.”

 

“You don’t have to remember,” Shouto tells him, and then Kouta sprints past them, back down the path to the lodge.

 

Hitoshi appears a few seconds later, after Izuku’s collected himself enough to sit up again.

 

“How’d it go?” Izuku asks, wiping the remaining tears off his face.

 

“Fine,” Hitoshi answers. “I’m not a therapist, so I couldn’t really accomplish much. But at the very least I doubt he’ll try to kick you in the balls, again, so I consider it a win.”

 

Izuku smiles an expression that doesn’t attempt to hide his sadness. “Let’s head back,” he says.

 

“If you’re ready,” Hitoshi insists.

 

Izuku stands up and uses his grip on Shouto’s  hand to drag him to his feet. “I don’t want to worry Aizawa-sensei,” Izuku says.

 

Shouto holds out his right hand towards Hitoshi.

 

Hitoshi raises an eyebrow, then appears to seriously ponder the offer before his eyes light up and he stuffs his hands in his pockets. “I’m gonna have to give you the cold shoulder this time, hot stuff. It wouldn’t be right otherwise.”

 

Oh. He wasn’t considering the offer. He was pondering the best joke.

 

Izuku laughs. Hitoshi smirks and Shouto smiles.

 

And so they head back, following the same path Kouta just took, Izuku and Shouto holding hands and Hitoshi walking just in front of them, practicing impressions of other students and teachers. His impression of Aizawa is so good Shouto can’t help but wonder if they’re secretly related.

 

- - -

 

It is 8pm when Shouta’s phone rings: a quiet, high-pitched beeping that means drop anything and answer. It means Nedzu is calling him.

 

Shouta drops everything (a bowl and the sponge he’d been using to clean it) and steps outside of the lodge for some privacy. “Aizawa,” he answers out of habit.

 

“Thank you for your patience!” Nedzu greets some like passive aggressive customer service rep.

 

“It’s been thirteen fucking hours just tell me how it went.”

 

“I would’ve called earlier, but we’ve been quite busy and didn’t want to tell you anything inaccurate.”

 

“Nedzu, I swear to fucking god. What did you get out of Midoriya Hisashi.”

 

“Well...” Nedzu starts.

 

Thirteen hours ago

 

“You’re sure this is the right place?” Naomasa asks, even though he has no logical reason to doubt that the house before him is Midoriya’s. Naomasa can’t pinpoint it, but he trusts his instincts. From the sidewalk, something feels off.

 

Toshinori nods. “This is it,” he says, but neither of them move to walk towards it.

 

For the sixth time, Naomasa checks his pockets. Phone, taser, radio, pepper spray, house keys, car keys, the receipt from his morning coffee, multi-tool, Nedzu’s USB drive, recording device. Everything is still there.

 

He should not be this nervous for a house call, but he supposes it was the way Nedzu framed it that has him on edge. Nedzu told him to be careful, don’t trust anything he says, and don’t rely on your quirk. And Nedzu never says anything unnecessary, so Naomasa is being very careful.

 

“Hisashi is a very kind man,” Toshinori says, again. He keeps saying it, and although Naomasa doesn’t detect a lie, it sounds like Toshinori is trying to convince himself. “He’s sick--chronic illness--I’m sure this is all just a misunderstanding.”

 

Naomasa really hopes so--that Midoriya Hisashi’s lack of contact with UA is simply a consequence of his poor physical health. But Naomasa has interacted enough with Midoriya Izuku to fear there’s more to this.

 

“Let’s go,” Toshinori says, and begins walking to the house.

 

Naomasa takes a deep breath, lays his right hand on his taser, and follows.

 

The neighborhood is quiet, which is not unusual considering it’s 7am on a weekday, but still has Naomasa on edge. Toshinori rings the doorbell, the sound echoing across the white picket fences.

 

Naomasa recites his script in his head, and waits.

 

And waits.

 

And waits.

 

Toshinori shoots him a look of confusion and rings the bell again.

 

The silence is terrifying.

 

Toshinori says, quietly, “I didn’t think he ever left the house.”

 

“He might need medical attention,” Naomasa says, and even though he believes it’s a possibility his quirk still tells him he’s lying.

 

Naomasa reaches for the doorknob.

 

“Are you sure?” Toshinori asks.

 

The doorknob turns. It’s unlocked.

 

The door swings open without a sound. The house is completely silent, save a barely audible hum of what’s probably the AC. There are no slippers in front of the door. That stands out to him, but Naomasa doesn’t know why, yet.

 

Naomasa opens his mouth to call out, but something stops him, some primal warning to stay quiet.

 

Toshinori does. “Midoirya Hisashi? It’s Yagi, Izuku’s mentor. Are you alright?”

 

The house remains silent.

 

Naomasa steps further into the building, finding himself in a combined dining/living room. Though, calling it a living room feels like a stretch, considering the only sign of life is a couch against a wall, covered in plastic, and the television in a corner. There are no photos or pictures, no knick knacks, no collectibles, just an empty bookshelf. It’s so clean it doesn’t look like anyone actually lives here, more like the house has just been sold, or is just about to go on the market. Maybe they’re in the process of moving. Naomasa doesn’t remember reading anything about extra properties on Nedzu’s USB drive, but he might’ve missed something.

 

“Did Midoriya-kun tell you they’re moving?” Naomasa asks, quietly. Still quiet.

 

Toshinori frowns. He doesn’t say anything, only shakes his head.

 

Naomasa shoots Nedzu a quick text because he wants to minimize the sound he makes. Does MH own any other properties?

 

Nedzu’s reply is near instant: Nope! And no recent credit checks either, so they aren’t moving anytime soon.

 

Nedzu got the gist from Naomasa’s six-word text alone. That man still scares him.

 

Naomasa ventures into the kitchen. Maybe he’s overthinking this. They could be redecorating, or maybe Hisashi is just really, really into minimalism. But the kitchen is the same. Too clean and very empty. There’s nothing in the fridge. Nothing in the drawers. Not a single utensil or plate or appliance. Not even a single speck of dust. Naomasa is convinced that, were he to bring in his team of forensic experts, they would find nothing. Not a single fingerprint or strand of hair. There’s no evidence that anyone lives here.

 

What does that mean?

 

Toshinori shakes his head. His face is pale and a bead of sweat drips down his forehead. “I got the sense... Hisashi is hooked up to so many medical machines, I can’t imagine he could leave them for very long.”

 

“Where’s his room?” Naomasa asks as he reaches for the closet door.

 

“Upstairs, probably,” Toshinori says, uncertain.

 

Naomasa’s hand rests atop the knob of the door under the stairs. Just a closet. He’s 99% sure it’s as empty as the rest of the place. “Let’s go,” he says, instead, and they head upstairs. More of the same. Two empty bedrooms with nothing but bed frames. Not a single medical device of any kind.

 

Something is wrong. Naomasa bites the bullet and dials Nedzu. Nedzu will be faster than any of Naomasa’s people. “Do you have records of any recent activity? Credit cards?”

 

“Nope!” Nedzu says with the same cheer he always has.

 

Shit.

 

Toshinori looks at him, concerned, so Naomasa shakes his head.

 

“There’s nothing there, then?” Nedzu asks, ever perceptive.

 

“Correct,” Naomasa states, trying to keep his nerves out of his voice as he walks back down the stairs. "The house is empty." This doesn’t make any sense. Where would he have gone? How could a man with severe physical illness just disappear and take his entire house with him?

 

“We should file a missing person’s report,” Toshinori says. His hands are fidgety in his pockets and his weight shifts from one foot to the other.

 

Naomasa doesn’t have any better ideas. “Under normal circumstances, we’d have to wait, but due to--”

 

Nedzu pipes up, so Naomasa puts him on speaker phone, “Hisashi does not have a registered disability.”

 

So that loophole won’t work. Naomasa adds, “We don’t have enough to officially suspect him of child... endangerment.” Which means, unless Izuku will testify that he last saw his father more than forty-eight hours ago, “We’ll have to wait.”

 

“We should talk to Izuku,” Toshinori says. “This could all just be a misunderstanding.”

 

“It could,” Naomasa admits while Nedzu says, “I sincerely hope not! That would be incredibly boring. And I am ninety-seven point eight percent sure this is something much more interesting. Unfortunately, at this time, all I have are eleven and a half theories as to what this could be.” After a beat, Nedzu continues, “No one is to contact Midoriya Izuku unless it is an absolute emergency. We intentionally scheduled this during the training camp to minimize his risk. I will update Aizawa once we have more details. Have a great day!” Nedzu hangs up.

 

Naomasa stares at the phone for a moment before pocketing it. Despite having known Nedzu for a number of years, Naomasa still fails to predict him.

 

“I suppose we should get our warrant,” Naomasa says, though the anticlimacticism of this endeavor has him exhausted. This is not what he was expecting. He suspects this isn’t what any of them were expecting, except for maybe Nedzu. All they’ve gained from this visit is more questions. This is, perhaps, the least reassuring outcome possible. Naomasa would have rathered meeting Midoriya Hisashi to discover a psychotic drunk, or the most perfect human being imaginable. Anything other than this nebulous limbo that stretches off in all directions. Toshinori doesn’t say anything, but worry nibbles away at his bottom lip and he looks even less steady on his feet than he normally does. Unfortunately Naomasa doesn’t have anything reassuring to say that isn’t a lie, and Naomasa hates lying.

 

It is as they are walking out of the front door that Naomasa hesitates. Something is wrong. What is it? He feels like there’s something itching at the tip of his tongue. He saw something that registered in his subconscious but not his conscious. He turns around, sees the dining room and past it, the kitchen.

 

There. Under the stairs. The one door in the place they haven’t checked.

 

Naomasa bolts through the house. It might be nothing. But if Nedzu is right (and Nedzu is always right) there’s a ninety-seven percent chance that it’s something. He grabs onto the knob and turns.

 

It doesn’t budge.

 

It’s locked. The only locked room in the entire house. This is it.

 

“What is it?” Toshinori asks, jogging up behind him.

 

“It’s locked,” Naomasa says. He probably sounds too excited. He unlocks the taser from his belt, lays a hand on it. He doesn’t have a warrant. Naomasa should probably care about that, but he doesn’t. When it comes to the safety and well-being of children, Naomasa often stops caring about the law. There’s probably a smarter way to go about this, but Naomasa’s too overwhelmed with adrenaline to care. He takes out his taser and slams the butt of it against the knob once, twice, and on the third time the handle snaps off and drops to the floor and Naomasa swings the door open and--

 

 

 

Nothing.

 

Just an empty closet. A little smaller than he was expecting, with recently redone wood paneling along the walls, but that’s it.

 

Nothing.

 

There’s absolutely nothing.

 

Present

 

The other end of the line is silent for so long Shouta resolves to punch Nedzu in the face the next time they meet. But then Nedzu finally says the last thing Shouta was expecting to hear--a sentence which fills him with more dread than he could have expected:

 

“Midoriya Hisashi is missing.”

 

 

 
Notes:

    I was thinking a lot about spiders as I worked on this chapter. Namely, the fear of spiders and how they aren't scariest when we can see them, but that they become infinitely more terrifying after we've lost track of them. AFO is the spider in this metaphor.
    I sincerely hope those final scenes filled you with as much dread as they did to Aizawa :)

    Thank you all so much for your patience and support! I love each and everyone of you! I sincerely appreciate all your support, kudos, bookmarks, and especially comments!

Chapter Text

Hitoshi likes the dark. He’s always found comfort in the way it envelopes him. There is a power to darkness that Hitoshit has always worn like a suit of armor.

 

But here, in the middle of the woods, the darkness is unfamiliar, endless, hostile. There are no corners to guide him, no streets that he knows better than the back of his hand. There is just empty space and invisible trees for miles. He feels trapped in it, in the darkness, and so he doesn't step off the lodge’s porch like he’d initially planned to. Anything could be out there.

 

This darkness is not his friend.

 

How could the rest of 1-A relax? When they have no idea what could be out there? Villains could be crouching in the shadows of trees right now. Hitoshi has never considered himself superstitious, but staring into the endless void of the forest, he understands the allure.

 

He came outside to relax. To get away from the sweaty crowd of teenagers trapped in a shared bedroom. How could they all sleep like that? He came out here to feel safe. But that failed miserably. He’s never been in such a wide open space before, but he knows now with confidence: he hates them. He misses the city. The familiar alleyways and shop fronts and abandoned buildings. He could navigate that city blind. He always knew where he was, even when he was being chased by petty robbers or gang members, or even when he was getting beat up to a pulp, he knew where he was. He knew where he could go next. He knew how to escape. He knew how to feel safe again.

 

But out here, the only thing rooting him down is this single building, filled with adults he doesn’t trust and children who don’t know the first thing about life.

 

“Beautiful,” a voice suddenly says from behind him.

 

If Hitoshi had been sitting he would’ve jumped up to his feet, but instead he just flinches with his whole body. He spins around to find Uraraka standing in the doorway. She’s looking upwards, neck craned uncomfortably. After a moment, Hitoshi looks up, too.

 

He’s never seen anything like it.

 

The sky is not the muddled, empty black he’s used to. It’s freckled with little white dots, each of different sizes and luminosity. Stars. Hitoshi can see the stars. He stops breathing. There are so many of them, and as his eyes adjust he realizes that the spaces he thought were empty are just as filled with stars as the rest.

 

Uraraka continues, quietly, “It’s been so long since I was far enough from the city to see them.”

 

Hitoshi’s never seen them before, not like this, and he can’t look away. It’s so big. This darkness is not a blanket, no, it is even more endless than he could ever imagine. How many stars are up there? Planets? Galaxies? People? He almost laughs. They are all so small. Hitoshi is so small. None of this matters in the grand scheme of things, not when he is just one boy on one planet in one galaxy among millions, billions, and that is the most comforting thought he’s had in years.

 

None of this matters.

 

Hitoshi lets out a deep exhale, feels his body relax.

 

“Can’t sleep?” Uraraka asks.

 

And he’s tense again, the spell broken.

 

While he was distracted, Uraraka had stepped off the porch to lay in the grass on her back, staring up at the sky with a soft smile. “Me neither,” she continues despite Hitoshi’s silence. “I’m too excited. Plus, I wanted to see this.”

 

Hitoshi doesn’t say anything. He sits down on one of the porch stairs and pulls out his phone for the sole purpose of having a shield against Uraraka. He’d go back inside but there are even more people in there, and he absolutely refuses to go any further into the darkness, so his only option is to remain on the porch.

 

“What’s keeping you up?” Uraraka asks.

 

“Insomnia,” Hitoshi answers, flatly.

 

Uraraka lets out a snort before her face falls into an expression slightly more serious. She’s still laying in the grass, but turns her head slightly to look at Hitoshi. “You wanna talk about whatever’s keeping you up? That usually helps me.”

 

Hitoshi just stares at her. Is she serious? Why would she try to engage Hitoshi of all people in conversation? Izuku and Shouto must have made him soft. He’s failed to scare her off. If she hasn’t given up already despite his intentional unapproachability, then maybe he should try something else.

 

- - -

 

Shinsou scowls down at her, but it looks more sad than it does threatening. Ochako isn’t convinced he’ll say anything, and she’s just accepted the fact that they’ll spend the rest of however-long in silence when Shinsou says, “I can’t sleep anywhere I don’t feel safe.”

 

His scowl falls into a more neutral expression and he looks into her eyes. They’re purple and sharp and it looks like he hasn’t had a good night’s rest in years. He continues, “Had too many experiences in foster care with people touching me in my sleep.”

 

Ochako’s heart lurches into her throat. “You mean--” she can’t get the rest of the words out, but she doesn’t need to.

 

“Yeah,” Hitoshi answers.

 

Ochako is the first to look away. Her adrenaline’s spiked. She’s read about foster care, in passing, from third or fourth-hand sources. She’s heard stories, but it’s so different when it’s someone you know, when it’s someone sitting just a few feet away, when it’s someone you might call your friend one day.

 

It’s hard to think about, and makes Ochako’s stomach curl, but it’s real, and Shinsou Hitoshi is sitting just a few feet away. After her heart rate’s settled into something less drastic, she turns back and finds Shinsou’s eyes again. “Thank you... for telling me,” she says, just above a whisper. She smiles because it’s the only thing she can do. “I know that couldn’t have been easy.”

 

Something hardens in Shinsou’s expression but it fails to deter Ochako from saying, “You’re one of the strongest people I know.”

 

After a moment, Shinsou lets out a sharp laugh. It sounds sad and angry and hopeless and Ochako does not believe him when he says, “I was lying, obviously. I can’t believe you fell for it. Why the fuck would I tell you anything of consequence?”

 

- - -



But Uraraka just keeps looking into his eyes. She says, “Okay,” before smiling softly and turning back to the stars. “I know we’re not close--”

 

“And we never will be.”

 

She continues without hesitation, “But I want to be your friend, Shinsou. You’re such a good friend to Todoroki and Midori--and they’re such good friends to you. And I’ll be honest, I’m a little jealous, but I’m happy for you all. Really. So if there’s anything I can do for you, or Todoroki, or Midori, just... I wanna be here for you all.”

 

“Yeah, right,” Hitoshi says because he doesn’t know what else to say.

 

Uraraka takes a deep breath, closing her eyes. Her hands clench into fists at her side but when she exhales they relax. “Please don’t insult my kindness or my intentions, Shinsou. I will not push you, but I will be here for you.”

 

Hitoshi frowns. A retort tickles the tip of his tongue but he doesn’t let it out. There’s a tiny knot in his stomach, a feeling he can only barely recognize: guilt. He hates it, so he shoves his earbuds into his ears and blares whatever his phone starts auto-playing. He leans back, the stair behind him digging into his back. But he refuses to move. He can’t let Uraraka win. So he stares up at the stars.

 

He isn’t sure how long he sits there, but he makes it through two albums before Uraraka says another word. He tries to ignore her, but makes out the word Midori, so reluctantly turns down the volume.

 

He doesn’t say anything, but when he looks down at her she smiles softly. “How is Midori doing?” she asks. “I’m worried about him.”

 

He should probably go back to ignoring her, but he says, “You’ve known him longer than I have.”

 

“Sure, but I get the sense that he can tell you things he can’t tell me. What can I do to help him? I know I’m not qualified to, like, be his therapist or anything. But the way you handled his panic attack... how can I be a good friend to him?”

 

“You really wanna ask me for advice?”

 

She stares at him for a moment before stating, with a voice of confidence, “Yes. Because you’re a good person, Shinsou-kun.”

 

Hitoshi scoffs. “What the fuck gave you that impression?”

 

“I trust Midori’s judgment,” Uraraka answers. “He wouldn’t be friends with you if you weren’t a good person. And I’ve witnessed you being a great friend to both Midori and Todoroki.

 

Before he can stop himself, Hitoshi spits out, “You’re a better friend than I’ll ever be.”

 

It’s supposed to be self-deprecating, but then he realizes what he actually said, and then he realizes that he means it.

 

Uraraka smiles, wide and happy, and she starts saying something else but Hitoshi doesn’t want to hear it so he closes his eyes and turns the volume up as high as it goes.

 

- - -

 

Hitoshi wakes up.

 

Hitoshi wakes up, which means he fell asleep.

 

He fell asleep. Oh god. Hitoshi throws himself to his feet, spins in a quick circle to try and catch his bearings but his eyes won’t focus because he got up too fast not enough iron not enough calories when was the last time he ate and his stomach lurches and he pats himself down. All his clothes are still on. That’s good. That’s good, at least, but he fell asleep. He senses movement in his peripheral -- where is he again? -- and jumps backwards. He can’t breathe.

 

“Shinsou-kun,” Uraraka whispers, her voice full of pity and concern.

 

He’s on the porch of the inn and Uraraka is standing on the yard a few feet away. He’s on the porch of the inn at the training camp and Shouto stands in the doorway wearing pajamas (a matching set of thin flannel) and Uraraka is staring up at him with sad eyes.

 

“Fuck you,” Hitoshi hisses at her.

 

“Asshole,” Shouto states, and despite the word it's said with zero hostility. If anything, it's the opposite.

 

Hitoshi takes a deep breath. He’s having a minor panic attack. Fuck. He’s at the training camp. He’s fine. He’s as safe as he can be. All the adults are inside. He lets out the breath. Counts. In. Counts. Out. He’s safe, probably. In. Out.

 

When his breath has steadied he tells Shouto, “I don’t care if I’m an asshole to her,” but he isn’t sure if he means it or not.

 

Uraraka somehow doesn’t look at all disturbed by that sentiment, and that just makes him feel worse. Fuck. Not again. Why does he keep feeling guilty whenever she's around? He rummages through his backpack before pulling out the one physical book he brought. He turns around and tosses it, gently, at Uraraka. “I stole it,” he tells her in hopes it puts her off, but it doesn’t. “You can have it.” It’s a book on how to support people with anxiety disorders.

 

He lugs his backpack over one of his shoulders as Uraraka beams up at him and says, “Thanks!” with too much cheer for six in the morning.

 

Hitoshi just looks at Shouto and says, “I need coffee.”

 

 

 

Hitoshi slides into the kitchen, slowly closing the door behind him so it doesn’t make a sound, but--

 

“Breakfast is in the dining hall,” Eraserhead says. He’s standing right in front of the coffee machine, clutching a large, steaming mug to his chest.

 

Hitoshi doesn’t say anything, instead nodding towards the coffee machine. He takes a step towards it but then Eraserhead says, “Yeah, no.”

 

Hitoshi freezes in place, fixing a scowl on his face. “What do you mean yeah, no?”

 

“I mean none of my students are having caffeine.”

 

Hitoshi’s hands clench into fists as Eraserhead takes a large gulp of his coffee.

 

“What are you gonna do? Stop me?” Hitoshi takes another step forward.

 

“Yeah,” Eraserhead answers in that same exhausted, noncommittal tone. “You’re about to do intense physical activity. You need calories, protein, and water. Not caffeine.”

 

Hitoshi takes another step forward. Eraserhead doesn’t react.

 

“If I don’t have coffee, I’ll be literally nonfunctioning all day.”

 

“Then you have an addiction problem.”

 

“You’re one to talk.”

 

“Shinsou,” Eraserhead says, more quietly. His expression softens. “All I want is the best for each of you.”

 

“Sure, whatever you say. Let me have a cup.”

 

Eraserhead doesn’t move.

 

“What if I promise to eat breakfast?” Hitoshi tries.

 

Eraserhead levels him with a look that means he doesn’t trust that one bit. Rightfully so. If Hitoshi were to eat right now he’d throw up immediately.

 

Eraserhead sighs, then dumps his cup out in the sink. He rummages through his pockets before tossing something at Hitoshi. Hitoshi just barely manages to catch it, fumbling for a couple seconds before it settles in his hands. It’s a small packet, like one of the ones that holds applesauce for kids to squeeze directly into their mouths, but silver.

 

“A liquid meal. Flavored like coffee,” Eraserhead says. “It’s got caffeine in it.”

 

Hitoshi frowns, turns it over in his hands. The other side reads naturally coffee flavored and decaffeinated except, “You’ve just sharpied over the D-E.”

 

“Trust the placebo effect,” Eraserhead tells him.

 

“I’m pretty sure that’s not how the placebo effect works.”

 

“Try it,” Eraserhead says, anyway.

 

Hitoshi doesn’t want to let Eraserhead win, but he knows the man is right. If he’s going to get stronger he needs calories, no matter how nauseous he is. “Fine,” Hitoshi says as he unscrews the lid and dumps the substance in his mouth.

 

It tastes like coffee. Black coffee. It isn’t great, but Hitoshi isn’t a coffee snob at six in the morning. It’s an interesting texture, but it doesn’t curdle in his stomach like most other foods do. It’s just a slightly thick liquid, like a smoothie, that just happens to taste like coffee.

 

Eraserhead is staring at him with a wide grin. “How is it?”

 

“I hate it,” Hitoshi lies as he takes another swig.

 

“Shinsou,” Eraserhead says with that tone that means he’s getting serious again.

 

Hitoshi turns around and heads for the door.

 

“You remind me of myself,” Eraserhead says before the door slams shut behind Hitoshi.

 

- - -

 

Hitoshi is exhausted. His body is not used to consistent, high-intensity physical exercise, which is all he’s been fucking doing for the past nine hours. The other kids get to work on their quirks, but not Hitoshi. Hitoshi has to work on his fucking stamina, which means he spends ten minutes sprinting up a random hillside, fifteen walking back down, another ten lifting weights, five for a water break, and then the cycle continues anew.

 

He wishes he could say it was pointless, that he could spit in Pixie Bob’s face and insist that he should be doing anything else--combat or even (god forbid) practicing his quirk--but he can’t. He knows they’re right. His weakest point is his body.

 

He does all this with one of Eraserhead’s capture weapons hanging from his neck. He hasn’t been trained to use it yet, so it just sits there, limply, adding a couple extra pounds. Eraserhead said he had to get used to it before he could try it out, but Hitoshi doesn’t see how this counts as “getting used to it”, as all it does is sit like a scarf around his neck. Hitoshi keeps wearing it, though, because it’s one of Eraserhead’s capture weapons.

 

Hitoshi’s ten reps into twenty of jump squats when Pixie Bob yells out, “Alright, everybody! Five minute break!”

 

Hitoshi doesn’t hesitate to approach (whilst keeping his distance) where everyone is gathering around Pixie Bob. He stands silently next to Shouto, who’s still shivering and dripping wet like a cat. It would be funny if it weren’t a little sad. Shouto still isn’t comfortable using the fire half of his quirk, and they had him doing some intense quirk training.

 

Pixie Bob continues, “We’re all super proud of how you’ve done so far, and so to wrap up our first day of training we’re gonna do a fun team-bonding activity: a test of courage! Shouta is very sad that he can’t be here right now (I am lying. He is actually very relieved) but he’s given me the pairings for your team-ups!” Pixie Bob pulls a handful of notecards out of her pocket. “First up, Todoroki-kun and Shinsou-kun!”

 

Shouto turns to Hitoshi and nods once, which on anyone else would have appeared like sterile professionalism, but on Shouto it’s equivalent to pumping a fist in the air in joy. So Hitoshi responds in turn by slapping Shouto lightly on the back and saying, “Time for our mandatory filler episode. Maybe you’ll finally fall for my seductive charm. You know that trope, right? Kimodameshi?”

 

After a moment, Shouto states, “I do not know that trope.”

 

“Even better. You’ll get to experience it first hand.”

 

Shouto says nothing, and Pixie Bob continues listing off Eraserhead’s pairings, concluding with, “And sadly we have an odd number, since some of your classmates are stuck doing remediation work, so our last match-up will be Midoriya-kun and Shino--Mandalay!”

 

Izuku gives Mandalay a high-five, but only after a moment’s hesitation.

 

“Midori could join us!” Uraraka announces and her partner, Iida, adds on, “Yes. I’m sure Aizawa-sensei would find that solution acceptable.”

 

But Mandalay easily responds with, “If that’s what Aizawa wanted, that’s what he would have written down. This way, no one group has any advantage over another.”

 

Hitoshi makes eye contact with Izuku and asks in a quick, sloppy sign, “r u ok?”

 

Izuku smiles and nods and so Hitoshi shrugs, shoves his sweaty hands in his pockets and starts walking towards the forest edge.

 

“Looks like someone’s excited!” Pixie Bob says. “Do you want any more information before you head in? I have a whole spiel prepared.”

 

“No,” Hitoshi answers. “I like a challenge.”

 

 

 

They’re a full minute’s walk into the forest and Shouto is still shivering, so Hitoshi asks, “Do you want my jacket?”

 

Shouto spares a glance, then his lips curl ever-so-slightly downwards into an almost-pout. “You don’t have a jacket,” Shouto tells him, because Hitoshi doesn’t have a jacket.

 

“I know,” Hitoshi says with a smirk. “I’m hot enough for the both of us. Wink. Wink.” He still hasn’t mastered the art of actually winking, so saying the words out loud will have to do.

 

Shouto lets out a sigh, but otherwise doesn’t react.

 

Another minute passes without fanfare and Hitoshi starts to regret not listening to Pixie Bob’s spiel. He has no idea what kind of “test of courage” this is gonna be. Who even is gonna scare them?

 

But then Shouto stops, dead in his tracks, staring at something sitting in the path.

 

It’s a hand. A hand completely unattached to the rest of a body, let alone an arm. It lays there. And then it twitches.

 

Shouto freezes--literally--and then the hand starts crawling towards them. A muffled laughter snickers from behind a few nearby bushes, until Shouto encases the hand in ice.

 

“Aw, c’mon!” a girl calls out from the bushes, and then a 1-B student steps out, her left hand missing. “That’s so not fair! Could I have my hand back?”

 

The small block of ice melts and then the hand scuttles back up to her wrist. “Well, whatever! My name’s Tokage! Did I scare you?”

 

“No,” Hitoshi says while Shouto deadpans, “Yes.”

 

“Haha, good enough! It was nice to meet you both, good luck on the rest of the test of courage!” and then she drops both her hands back on the ground and walks back behind the bush.

 

The next ten minutes pass roughly the same way: with half-assed jumpscares that each, without fail, absolutely petrify Shouto. And then a long, thin white spike juts down in between them.

 

“Ooooo,” Hitoshi deadpans, “spooky.” When he pokes it, it draws back upwards, into the night. He can’t tell where it came from, not that it matters. Hitoshi just keeps walking, Shouto half a step behind him.

 

A voice calls out, deep and oddly wet, “Meeeeeat. Young meat. Tender meat.”

 

Hitoshi nods, shrugs, and says, “Alright, this one’s actually pretty good. I’m impressed.” He didn’t think those 1-B toddlers had it in them.

 

And then another spike comes hurtling towards his legs. He only dodges it because Shouto drags him out of the way.

 

“Not supposed to...” the voice continues, “play with my food.” And then a figure clad in an all-black straight jacket launches into the air. The only identifying feature Hitoshi can make out is his mouth, open wide, drooling, and teeth that are too long. Teeth that curve into thin spikes, or blades, or whatever that the man is using like stilts to hover above the trees.

 

“You aren’t from 1-B,” Hitoshi says because he has to say something.

 

The man gurgles out a yell of “MEAT!” and too many blades shoot towards them. Something shoves Hitoshi to the side. He stumbles. Why is that tree trunk so close? A sharp pain bursts through his head. He sees black.

 

- - -

 

“Are you sure you don’t want to be out there?” Kurogiri asks from behind the bar.

 

Is he sure he--of course Tomura wants to be out there. What kind of question even is that? He would love to claw his fingers into someone else's skin and rip them to shreds, watch them crumble to dust between his palms, but that’snot what’s happening out there. He still isn’t allowed to kill any fucking kids. So, sure. Whatever. No, he doesn’t want to be out there. He’d have an even harder time curbing his bloodlust in front of live bodies.

 

Tomura slams a six of spades on top of a seven of diamonds. He really does not like Solitaire, but he needs something more solid than a controller in his hands--something he can break without getting chastised by Sensei for it. “I’m sure,” Tomura hisses. “The mission succeeded the instant we discovered the location of the training camp. Everything after that’s just bonus points.”

 

“What about the student?” Kurogiri asks. Another pointless question. Was he even listening when Tomura told everyone the mission parameters?

 

“If our main goal was to kidnap him, we would’ve just sent you and Compress. Everyone else would just get in your way. The quest this time is to scare them, to remind them who the protagonists of this game are. We’ll win. No matter where they go, we’ll find them and--”

 

Tomura flips over the next card. A two of diamonds. Useless. Fucking useless. He rips the card in half, then the halves in half, then again, shredding it until the pieces are too small to fit between his fingertips. He picks up the rest of the deck then disintegrates it in his hand, watches as the molecules of dust tumble onto the countertop.

 

“We’ll win.”

 

- - -

 

“Wait,” Mandalay suddenly announces, thrusting out an arm to stop Izuku from stepping into the forest. They’re the last pair to head out, the rest of the class already in the woods. “Something is wrong.”

 

Izuku tenses, slides one foot back just enough to pass as a casual fighting stance. She’s right. It smells like fire, and the first tendril of smoke drifts towards them from in between the trees. Izuku should’ve noticed it earlier; he can’t see the aura of any of his classmates. The smoke must be hiding it.

 

“Ryu--” Mandalay starts, turning back towards the clearing, but she stops mid-way to grab Izuku and toss him behind her.

 

In the middle of the clearing a large, purple, familiar portal swirls into existence.

 

The League of Villains.

 

One for All pulses through Izuku’s body. He should have expected this. He should have seen this coming. But he was distracted.

 

Two villains step out and the portal closes immediately behind them, disappearing. A half-turtle man carrying more weapons than could ever be effective and a woman lugging around a large object hidden underneath fabric.

 

The next time Mandalay speaks, it is directly into Izuku’s head and, he expects, the heads of everyone else: “This is not a drill. Villains have attacked the training camp. Do not engage. I repeat: do not engage.” Then she tells Izuku, quietly and quickly, “Get out of here.”

 

“I can fight,” Izuku insists.

 

“I know,” she says as Pixie Bob and Tiger intercept the two villains. “But you shouldn’t have to. That’s our job.”

 

Ragdoll bursts out of the lodge. “Kouta!” she yells at Mandalay. “He isn’t here!”

 

Izuku’s head shoots towards the cliff--Kouta’s hiding place.

 

It’s a black hole of blood red aura.

 

Izuku runs.

 

- - -

 

Hitoshi’s head spins. He must have hit it against something. The tree, probably.

 

If he has another concussion--

 

Shouto stands in front of him, back to Hitoshi, vibrating from head-to-toe with energy or fear or hypothermia--Hitoshi doesn’t know. He tries to sit up but he can’t find his own hands. His vision wanes. He tries to focus on Shouto’s back but he can’t see him well over the high-pitched dialogue of the villain. The man won’t stop talking, muttering half-sentences that Hitoshi can understand only enough to be disturbed. Something about meat. Something about eating flesh.

 

Their flesh.

 

The villain balances a good dozen feet in the air, using his spikes as spider-like feet. They come from the villain’s mouth. Teeth.

 

Shouto barely manages to block one of the villain’s onslaughts, redirecting it with a thick wall of ice so the sharp spikes stab a tree instead.

 

The villain mumbles, loud enough for Hitoshi to hear, “No. No good. Mustn’t get distracted. This is work. Job. Need to find... Need to distract... No good. So alluring!”

 

Hitoshi needs to get up.

 

Shouto shoots a wave of fire at the villain but it scatters against the hard surface of teeth and flickers out.

 

Hitoshi needs to get up.

 

The villain yells, “Just a taste!” before shooting too many blades at Shouto. At Hitoshi. Shouto should dodge. Shouto could dodge. But he doesn’t move. He continues standing right in front of Hitoshi. Shouto throws up a wall of ice. It shatters against the attack. He throws up another one. It shatters.

 

“Run,” Hitoshi manages to say. “You fucking idiot run.”

 

Shouto does not run.

 

A tooth-blade strikes Shouto’s shin. It goes straight through. Hits the ground just inches in front of Hitoshi. Shouto barely flinches. The villain lets out a sloppy laugh, then finally lets himself down onto the ground. He slowly scurries over towards them like a crab, continuing to use his teeth like legs.

 

Hitoshi needs to get up.

 

This isn’t how it’s supposed to go. This isn’t fair. This isn’t right. They can’t--they can’t die here.

 

The villain approaches them slowly. Shouto can’t move. The wound to his leg is too big, too deep and the villain is muttering to himself, “Just a taste. No one has to know. Just a taste.”

 

Hitoshi needs to get up but he can’t. He remains slouched against the tree, barely conscious, as the villain practically crawls over to them.

 

Shouto says, quietly, “Hitoshi,” and those three syllables are filled with more emotion than Hitoshi’s ever heard from him: fear, sadness, dread, and hope. Shouto has hope--Shouto has hope in him--in Hitoshi.

 

Ah. That’s right.

 

Hitoshi doesn’t need to get up.

 

All he needs to do is open his mouth.

 

Hitoshi can barely keep his eyes open but he can say, “Hey. Creepy crawly motherfucker. You like human flesh, right? What’s your favorite cut?”

 

The villain’s mouth curls into a smile and he answers “All--” and Hitoshi’s quirk activates. The villain freezes and Hitoshi orders, “Don’t move.”

 

He doesn’t.

 

Shouto relaxes--just enough to collapse onto his left knee. He’s breathing heavily and blood trickles down from the wound in his leg. Hitoshi doesn’t know what to do. He could have the villain remove the blade, but he’s concerned about resulting blood loss. Is freezing it a good or bad idea? Is it too big to cauterize? How is he supposed to help Shouto when he feels like he’s hungover and actively drowning. This isn’t good. He can’t fall unconscious now. If he does his quirk will deactivate.

 

“Hotstuff,” Hitoshi says at Shouto’s back. “You gotta keep me awake.”

 

For a moment Shouto doesn’t say anything but then he says, “Okay. Can you remove it?”

 

“Yeah.”

 

“Hand me the scarf.”

 

It takes him probably at least half-a-minute, though time has become something thick and liquid that slips between his fingers so he isn’t sure how long it really is but he finally manages to wrap his fingers around the end of the capture weapon and hold it out. “Here.”

 

Shouto twists just enough to grab the scarf and asks in a tense voice, “How do I keep you awake?”

 

“Talk. I need--something to focus on.”

 

“About what?” Shouto begins wrapping the scarf around his thigh, just above the wound. Hitoshi wishes he could help but his head is so heavy he can barely stay sitting up. He feels, distantly, something warm trickle down the side of his face. Head wounds do bleed a lot.

 

Anything, Hitoshi doesn’t say, because he knows Shouto honestly, actually wants a prompt. After a moment of swimming through quicksand Hitoshi finally comes up with, “When we... get back... what’d’ya wanna do?”

 

Shouto pauses, then returns to binding his leg. Hitoshi can’t see his face but every so often his shoulder blades tense up in pain. “We’ll take Izuku to that cafe you like,” Shouto says, quietly. “I’ll get a caramel frappe, you’ll get five shots with a splash of whole milk, and Izuku will judge their tea selection.” Shouto lets out a hiss, then ties the capture weapon tight. “It’s open twenty-four hours. We won’t ever have to leave. Izuku won’t ever have to go back to his father’s house.”

 

Hitoshi can picture it. Every day after class gets out, they just head to the cafe and spend the whole night there. He knows the evening baristas and they know him. He could probably even convince them to lend the kitchen for a few minutes, and Izuku could cook them all dinner. Maybe they could even get jobs there to make it easier. The future is so close that Hitoshi can smell the espresso in the air but then Shouto turns to face him and says, “Have him take it out.”

 

Hitoshi stares at the long, jagged tooth-blade jutting through Shouto’s leg. It’s going to hurt. Is Shouto sure? They could just stay here, in the cafe, until a hero comes--hah. What is Hitoshi thinking? No one’s going to save them. No one’s ever saved them. They have to save themselves. That’s how this world works.

 

Shouto makes eye contact and Hitoshi can see his determination and trust, palpable. Shouto nods once.

 

“Okay,” Hitoshi says, then activates his quirk to order the villain to, “remove the tooth from his leg.”




 

 

 

Shouto screams.

 

- - -

 

Izuku runs. He doesn’t think. He runs towards the sickening red haze. One for All pulses through his legs and he sprints up the mountainside, leaving a trail of lime-green light behind him. He doesn’t even have time to think, to plan, because he should have expected this but he didn’t and he arrives at the top of the mountain to find a hulking man standing above Kouta.

 

Izuku recognizes the white hockey mask: Muscular. The villain who killed Kouta’s parents.

 

“Oh, hello there,” Muscular says. He doesn’t move from looming over Kouta, but does turn towards Izuku. “This is lucky. Hey, aren’t you the one--actually, nevermind. First off, do you happen to know where a, uh, Shizu Hitoshi is?”

 

Shizu--Shinsou Hitoshi?

 

What do they want with him?

 

Izuku doesn’t answer. Not yet. First he looks at Kouta and tells him, “You’re going to be okay.”

 

Muscular lets out a deep, loud laugh. And Izuku takes the opportunity to Pull Kouta towards him. Muscular reacts fast--too fast--grabs onto the back of Kouta’s shirt and Izuku has to drop his quirk so Kouta doesn’t get trapped in a brutal tug-of-war.

 

“Woah there, not so fast,” Muscular says, all condescension. “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. You haven’t answered my question yet.” Muscular tightens his grip on Kouta’s shirt. “Where’s Shizu Hitoshi?”

 

This isn’t good. But that’s alright. For now, all Izuku needs to do is waste time--to make Muscular underestimate him as much as possible, which shouldn’t be that hard at all.

 

“Shizu-kun?” Izuku asks. He lets a waver into his voice, lets himself sound afraid. “I don’t know. We all got separated--”

 

“You’re the kid with the weird quirk, right?” Muscular interrupts. “You have like three or whatever but one of them’s strength enhancement. Right?”

 

Izuku does not warn Muscular don’t interrupt me, even if he wants to. That can come later. For now, Izuku has to keep up this ruse. “Yeah, but--”

 

“Good,” Muscular interjects again and for a moment all Izuku can see is a blood-red. Muscular’s bloodlust is seeping out, contagious. Muscular wants to kill Izuku. Izuku wants to kill him. Muscular simply continues, “Let’s see who’s stronger then. I’m gonna kill this kid and if you stop me, you win.”

 

“Or,” Izuku starts, “we could fight fair-and-square.” He takes a deep breath. “You’re really so scared of me that you need the kid as a shield?”

 

Muscular laughs, again, as his bloodlust grows even darker. He throws Kouta behind him, who tumbles too many times, then settles a few dozen feet back. “Sure,” Muscular says. “I like the sound of that. Fair-and-square. The winner is the one who lives.”

 

Muscular does not hesitate. Before Izuku can even tense up, Muscular’s fist is in his gut and Izuku is sliding backward. Something in his torso cracks--a rib, maybe--and he struggles to breathe for the half-second it takes Regeneration to kick in. Muscular kicks a roundhouse to Izuku’s head. Izuku blocks it with his forearm, but the force shoves his balance off. He just manages to stay on his feet.

 

Muscular sends another punch Izuku just manages to dodge.

 

“Disappointing,” Muscular deadpans. Izuku takes the offered second to pump One for All throughout his body and punch Muscular.

 

Muscular lets out a grunt, slides backward a few feet, and then smiles. “Just kidding.”

 

The next punch hits Izuku’s last-second block, shattering both his radius and ulna. Regeneration stitches them back together, but not in time for him to block the next one. As Izuku’s heart skips a beat (literally) and he stumbles backwards too many feet, he is only subconsciously aware of how close he is to the cliffside. Barely a dozen feet away.

 

Muscular kicks, again, and Izuku tries to catch it but it’s too strong and too red and his heart is still behind the rest of him and now the edge of the cliff is right there.

 

Izuku can take him. Izuku should be able to take him. Muscular is nothing compared to the Nomu. Muscular is nothing compared to his father.

 

But Muscular pulls his hand back for a punch and Izuku is ready with a counter. But then Muscular smiles. Something hits Izuku’s ankle. He loses balance. Muscular’s fist opens into a palm strike. He doesn’t punch. He pushes and Izuku is falling. The edge of the cliff is right there. Below him, now.

 

Izuku is falling.




 

 

Until he isn’t.

 

Izuku stands on thin air like it’s solid ground.

 

A yellow-gloved hand squeezes his own. A ghost of a woman with dark hair and a flowing cape stands next to him. He can’t make out any more of her features except for the wide smile that reminds him of All Might’s. It’s comforting. And without any words she insists that everything’s going to be okay. She’s only half-there, like a hallucination or a hologram, but Izuku can feel her hand in his, can feel her quirk keeping him afloat.

 

I promised, didn’t I? she says without moving her mouth, still smiling. I’ll always catch you.

 

“That’s new,” Muscular notes offhandedly, still on the cliff, outside of punching distance.

 

You’re going to be okay, the woman tells him with the voice of a dozen-or-so people. Whose voices are they? Izuku should probably be concerned about seeing and hearing things that aren’t there, but he isn’t. He turns to Kouta, smiles, and repeats, “You’re going to be okay.”

 

Muscular flinches backwards and, for some reason, the tiniest dot of yellow sparks against his bloodred aura.

 

Izuku should take a few steps forward, back to solid ground, but the woman says again, I got you.

 

Instead, Izuku takes a step backward, then another, walking across the air like he isn’t hundreds of feet above ground. He takes another.

 

Muscular lets out a sharp laugh. “What? You’re gonna leave the kid behind? You disappoint me.”

 

“I will never leave him behind,” Izuku states as he continues widening the distance between them.

 

“Then come back here and fight me like a man,” Muscular growls. “Or I’ll kill the kid.” Muscular turns and takes a step towards Kouta.

 

“No,” Izuku tells him, and grabs onto Muscular with Pull, stopping him in his tracks.

 

There are several feet between Izuku and the edge of the cliff when he begins Pulling Muscular towards him.

 

Muscular’s eyes widen and that dot of yellow fear sparks into a flame. Muscular thrusts his feet into the ground, all the way to his ankles, in an attempt to stop his momentum. But Izuku just takes another step back and continues Pulling Muscular towards him.

 

Muscular lets out a growl and finally amplifies his muscles until they break through his skin. He pushes back against Pull, uses the leverage of the stone in the ground to take a step backwards. Izuku grits his teeth, Pulls even harder but Muscular refuses to budge.

 

The villain barks out a laugh. “Is that the best you’ve got? The brat was hyping you up like you were some monster, but you’re nothing.”

 

I’m so sorry, baby, another woman says, this one with green hair. She fades out of existence so quickly Izuku’s sure he must’ve imagined her.

 

Muscular’s little orb of yellow fear is finally snuffed out by an overwhelming haze of bloodlust. It emanates out of him in waves so thick it weighs Izuku down. He nearly chokes on it.

 

They aren’t his emotions. What did Recovery Girl suggest again? He wants Muscular dead. This isn’t how the training camp was supposed to go. This isn’t why he dug himself out of the basement. This isn’t what he defied his father for. This isn’t what he’s risking everything for.

 

“Thanks for putting up a fight,” Muscular says as he cracks his neck. His muscles have grown to the point that he’s twice the size as he was before, and despite Izuku continuing to tug on him with Pull, Muscular barely even reacts. “But it’s time to stop playing and start killing. Starting with the orphan.”

 

Muscular’s bloodlust spikes in anticipation and it’s blinding.

 

Izuku wants him dead.

 

I’m gonna kill him, another voice says, this one a man’s--gruff and yet full of energy. This fucking asshole doesn’t know anything. Fucking prick. Let’s kill him.

 

A hand slams down on Izuku’s shoulder even though it isn’t really there. It’s attached to a man that Izuku can’t see--he can only make out the outline of goggles set on his forehead.

 

Muscular winds up for a punch aimed at Kouta. The man (or maybe Izuku himself) screams out with redhot anger. Something like a tentacle--or a whip--shoots out of Izuku’s extended left hand, glowing red, and wraps around Muscular’s arm so tight the muscles bulge.

 

The hand on Izuku’s shoulder tightens, reassuring.

 

How dare you, the man who isn’t there doesn’t say. Muscular struggles against the whip but it doesn’t budge.

 

After everything he’s been through to--

 

“What the fuck are you?” Muscular screams.

 

"Do not interrupt me," Izuku says, finally, with a voice that is not just his own.

 

Muscular's panic is a visceral yellow. “You aren’t human! You’re just another one of those science experiment freaks! A nom--”

 

Another whip wraps around Muscular’s mouth.

 

You should not have come at us with such hostility, the man says--or maybe it’s Izuku this time. He can't really tell the difference anymore.

 

And then the whips Pull Muscular towards Izuku--off the edge of the cliff.

 

"We have an empathy quirk."

 

Muscular drops.

 

- - -

 

Tomura hears the monitor crackle to life and he automatically spins on top of the stool to face it.

 

“Tomura,” Sensei says, voice half-static. “Muscular just tried to kill one of the students.”

 

Tomura throws himself to his feet, wide smile broken across his face before he’s conscious of it. “Really?” he asks, grinning. “Really?” Oh god, that's fantastic. He’ll have to die. Muscular will have to die. It’ll be so cool.

 

“Yes,” Sensei says, his voice curt and sharp. He doesn’t sound happy. Why doesn’t he sound happy? “I expect you to take better control over your tools in the future. I’ve already given you a second chance, Tomura. Don’t make it a third.”

 

Tomura stumbles backwards against the stool, nearly losing his balance. “Wait--” he starts, swallowing down bile. “It wasn't me. It was Muscular!”

 

 “Muscular is one of your party members, therefore he’s your responsibility.”

 

“You can’t--”

 

“Can’t I?” Sensei interrupts and Tomura bites down hard onto his bottom lip, tastes the iron of his own blood. This isn’t fair.

 

For a few seconds all Tomura can hear is his heart pounding against his eardrums and the staticy hum of the monitor. This isn’t fair. He didn’t do anything wrong! It wasn’t him!

 

He did everything Sensei told him to do! He built a stupid fucking party. He talked to people! Tomura hates talking to people! And he attacked the stupid fucking training camp. He did everything!

 

But Sensei is saying, “I was impressed with how you utilized Stain’s death to recruit party members.”

 

How he...? What did he do, again? He said some words, some of it he believed, some of it he didn’t. Ah, that’s right. He did what that brat Midoriya suggested he do.

 

“But now I’m thinking that might have just been a fluke.” The disappointment in Sensei’s voice threatens to choke Tomura. Sensei continues, “You can deal with Muscular how you see fit. I hope you can take just as much advantage of Muscular as you did Stain.”

 

Wait. How in hell is he supposed to do that?

 

There are too many seconds of silence before Sensei says, “Are you going to apologize to me?”

 

Apologize? Apologize for what? He didn’t do anything. That two-bit hack of a villain Muscular did! It isn’t his fault! This isn’t fair! Tomura wants to destroy something. Wants to kill something. But the only thing within distance is himself so he carves his fingernails deeper into his neck, lets his quirk pick at the top layer of his skin. It hurts, but not as much as Sensei’s disappointment does.

 

“I--” he starts. Bile teases at his throat and he struggles to swallow it down. He drops his head, stares at the hardwood flooring as blood trickles down his neck. “I’m sorry.”

 

“Apology accepted,” Sensei says. What he doesn’t say is I forgive you. He doesn’t say it. Instead he says, “We’ll discuss your punishment at a later time, pending how you deal with Muscular. I have more important business to attend to.” He doesn’t say it.

 

Tomura whispers, “Do you--” The monitor clicks off. “Forgive me?”

 

Tomura collapses against the stool, but at the wrong angle so it tips over beneath him and he collapses to the floor. He can’t breathe. How is he supposed to breathe again?

 

He digs his fingernails into the scab on his neck. Picks prods pulls at it until his nail slides underneath he rips it off. He picks at the edges of the wound, digging his nails into the exposed flesh. It hurts. He wants to stop it hurts. He wants to keep going. He rips off a small strip of skin. It needs to be perfect. He needs to be perfect. Maybe if he keeps going, sheds his outer layer like a snake, whatever’s left over will be good enough. Maybe if he peels off an entire layer of skin, every inch, Sensei will finally be proud of whatever remains.

 

This can’t be happening. This isn’t fair. He did everything right! This isn’t fair! He lets out a guttural scream, throws himself onto his feet. His vision stumbles for a moment. Picks up the stool throws it across the room. It needs to die. Someone needs to die. He needs to die. Everything needs to die Tomura picks up the next stool slams it over the countertop. Again. Again splinters fly into his face again! The leg snaps off in his hands disintegrates it with his quirk he screams .

 

Fuck!

 

“Tomura,” Kurogiri says, quietly.

 

Tomura is half-way over the bar before he realizes it, palm inches from Kurogiri’s collar. He was going to kill him. Tomura would kill him if Kurogiri wasn’t so fucking useful. But he’s Tomura’s special skill.

 

Instead of killing him, Tomura growls, “Get me Muscular. Now!”

 

“Where do you want him?” Kurogiri asks, an unusual waver to his voice. It takes a lot to scare Kurogiri.

 

Tomura smiles. At least he was successful at something. At least someone’s scared of him.

 

“Here,” Tomura orders. “Right here.”

 

 

 
Notes:

    Thank you all, again, for your patience with this update! I've been struggling a lot with perfectionism in my writing - I'm still not super happy with this chapter, but I am happy that I can get it out to y'all! I hope the fact that this one is pretty long (like 7.5k words) makes up for the delay :)
    I did something a little new/experimental with Tomura's POV there at the end so feel free to lemme know if it didn't work very well!

    In this chapter Shinsou sorta makes a joke about sexual assault -- I want to be clear: sexual assault is NOT a joking matter.

    As always, thank you all for reading, leaving kudos, comments, and bookmarks!!! <3

Chapter 36: Two types of games
Notes:

    Warnings for: Words as Weapon's typical depictions of violence and anxiety

    I had also considered titling this chapter "No matter what", if you were curious :)

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

Izuku spares a single glance at the view, but from the cliffside all he can see of note is fire and smoke. The boy on his back is still crying, so Izuku reminds him, “I’ll get you somewhere safe, promise.” Kouta stops shaking, but Izuku can still feel his tears. He needs a distraction, he needs a mission.

 

“When you get safe, I want you to do something. It’s something only you can do. It’s incredibly important.” Izuku waits a couple seconds for Kouta’s breathing to calm down to continue, “Can you work on putting out the fires?”

 

After a moment, Kouta nods, and his sobs finally die down.

 

“Thank you.”

 

Then Izuku runs. With Kouta on his back, Izuku sprints down the mountainside, so fast it’s more like a controlled fall. Except Izuku can’t fall; there is someone there to catch him. Sometimes, when the hill is steeper, he hovers above a small drop for a moment before his feet settle to the ground.

 

During his sprint Izuku is aware, vaguely, of the area around them. He keeps an eye out for strong emotions with Empathy. It offers him a three-second heads up that there’s someone on the path in front of them. There’s no hatred or bloodlust, just worry and determination, with a hint of anger, so Izuku doesn’t slow down until Aizawa’s right in front of them. The teacher is a little singed, but otherwise appears unharmed.

 

Before Izuku even comes to a full stop, Aizawa asks, “Are you both okay?”

 

Izuku spares a single syllable for, “Yeah,” then sets Kouta on the ground. “Take Kouta. I’m going.”

 

“Midoriya--” Aizawa starts, but Izuku can’t stay still for too long. He fears the adrenaline will wear off. Like an object in motion, if he stops for one second he might not get moving again. There is something fleeting about whatever power is currently electrifying him, like a cup full of water sitting right on the edge of the table. It could fall over at any time.

 

Exhaustion is right around the corner.

 

“They’re after Hitoshi,” Izuku says. He’s buzzing in more ways than one, bouncing lightly from one food to the other, just to keep moving. Just to keep his momentum up.

 

Aizawa’s eyes widen in surprise for a moment, then his expression softens.

 

“I’m going,” Izuku repeats. He starts to walk past Aizawa but the man gently grabs Izuku’s upper arm, gently.

 

“I know,” Aizawa tells him quietly. “I’m not going to stop you. Would you like me to temporarily erase your Empathy quirk?”

 

Izuku almost says yes automatically, but he hesitates. This is Aizawa Shouta. He isn’t his father. Aizawa would respect Izuku if he said no. And Izuku isn’t sure if he’d be able to keep going without it. He isn’t sure if this motivation powering him is his, or Muscular’s. So Izuku says, “No, thank you.”

 

“Okay,” Aizawa says, and doesn’t try to convince Izuku otherwise. “Don’t forget: you can always run away. You aren’t alone. We’re doing everything in our power to protect you.” Aizawa holds eye contact until Izuku nods and steps away.

 

He manages two steps before Aizawa says, “Izuku. No matter what happens, I’m proud of you. No matter what. ”

 

No matter what. Something his father would never say. Something no one’s ever said to him before and meant it.

 

No matter what. The only time his father was proud of him was when Izuku did what he wanted, when he did well, when he followed Father’s rules.

 

But Aizawa says no matter what and Izuku doesn’t have to see his aura to know he means it, because it’s Aizawa who says it.

 

No matter what. Maybe it’s the adrenaline. Maybe it’s the smell of dirt surrounding them. Maybe it’s the fact that barely 24 hours ago Izuku defied his father in a manner that will never be forgiven. The next thing he knows, Izuku’s arms are wrapped around Aizawa’s torso in a hug, and his face is buried in the capture weapon.

 

Aizawa does not hesitate to return the hug. He’s warm and comfortable and Izuku feels the safest he’s felt in a long time, if not forever.

 

Aizawa whispers into Izuku’s hair, “I’m going to keep you safe.”

 

Izuku believes him.

 

The hug does not last long because a breeze blows the smell of smoke towards them. Aizawa steps back, but for an extra moment he leaves a hand on Izuku’s shoulder. “If you see Mandalay before I do, have her relay this message: Eraserhead authorizes students to use their quirks to protect themselves and others. I’ll catch up to you as soon as I get Kouta and the rest safe. Promise.”

 

“Okay,” Izuku says, because he believes him.

 

“Now go,” Aizawa orders.

 

Izuku runs.




There is a new power to his step as Izuku sprints towards the lodge. He’ll need to go past it to get to the other side of the forest where Hitoshi should be. Over the sound of the wind blowing past him, Izuku can just make out a whispered dialogue, somewhere in the back of his mind.

 

I like him, a woman says as Izuku practically floats down the mountain. Eraserhead.

 

Same here, says the man from the fight with Muscular, and those weird whips clear branches out of his way without Izuku having to consciously direct them. And it isn’t often we agree on something, Seventh.

 

I just wish... another woman starts as Izuku picks up even more speed, Pull latching onto trees to propel him forward. That they met years ago. Maybe then everything would’ve been different... better.

 

The voices trail off and Izuku keeps running without stopping--without thinking--until he gets back to the clearing at the center of camp. There’s combat between the Pussycats and a few villains, but he doesn’t have time to worry about the professional heroes, so he simply steps between Mandalay and one of the villains, blocking some attack with a parry that may or may not have incorporated those whips.

 

Mandalay looks at him with wide, confused eyes while the villain behind him vocalizes complaints Izuku doesn’t care about. The attacks don’t bother him, and Izuku pauses just long enough to relay his messages to Mandalay. They’re after Hitoshi. Aizawa has authorized quirk usage. Izuku is coming to help him.

 

Despite her confusion and hesitance, Mandalay projects the message to everyone. She tries to stop him from leaving, as does the no-name villain, but neither of them stand a chance against his determination.

 

Izuku runs, again. This time into the forest, through the smoke that battles with Regeneration over his lungs. Izuku runs towards where his class should be. Towards Shinsou Hitoshi. Towards Todoroki Shouto.

 

Izuku runs towards The League of Villains.

Tomura sits on the surface of the bartop with his feet propped up on one of the stools. He’s been idly picking at a loose splinter of wood, bored. He smells it a second before it shows up--the unique, unnamable smell of Kurogiri’s quirk. Then that dark purple swirls into a portal in the middle of the room.

 

Tomura smiles. He’s ready for a fight, on his feet with his quirk itching at his fingertips. He’s been waiting for Muscular to arrive for four minutes too long. He’s already planned out the order in which he’ll decay Muscular’s limbs: right leg, right arm, left leg, left arm. Tomura won’t kill him, not yet. No, he’ll save that for when he has an audience. For now, Tomura will have to be satisfied with making Muscular wish he were dead.

 

Muscular tumbles out of the portal onto the floor.

 

He’s an unconscious pile of bruises and blood and broken bones,

 

Muscular is unconscious. How dare he.

 

Tomura stomps up to the body and kicks it, hard. It doesn’t even react.

 

“He’s alive,” Kurogiri says.

 

Thank god. “What the fuck,” Tomura hisses.

 

“I found him like this,” Kurogiri insists, as if Tomura thought there was any chance in hell that Kurogiri had taken out Muscular.

 

Tomura kicks it again. It still doesn’t react. “Where?”

 

“The bottom of the cliff.”

 

“What? He fell? That’s stupid.” Tomura kicks it once more, this time in the face, and it twitches. Muscular is really still alive. Fucked up and in no condition to fight, unfortunately, but alive.

 

Kurogiri answers, “I’m not sure.”

 

Tomura growls, stares at the unconscious Muscular. They’re supposed to fight. Tomura’s supposed to let out some of this itching energy that skitters across his skin. Tomura’s supposed to cause Muscular pain. Tomura’s supposed to torture him. Tomura’s supposed to decay each of his limbs over an extended period of time, until this Vanguard Action Squad Shit is finished and it’s his turn in this game. Tomura’s supposed to have fun except Muscular is fucking unconscious and half-dead already and if Tomura does any of that now the NPC will just die and Sensei won’t like that and Tomura will disappoint him and

 

“Shigaraki-san,” Kurogiri interrupts.

 

and Tomura’s missing a small chunk of his left forearm. It hurts in a way that grounds him, brings the current quest goal back into focus. “Get a nomu or two to restrain him,” Tomura orders.

 

He doesn’t like it, but he doesn’t have to. Tomura may hate waiting, but waiting is a kind of game, too, and Tomura always wins.

 

- - -

 

Through the smoke and trees, Izuku follows a pulsing white aura. It moves very, very slowly in a direction vaguely towards Izuku himself, and the lodge further behind him. Izuku isn’t sure how he knows--it could be a quirk or just his instinct--but he knows who the white aura belongs to. He knows who’s hurting, so he picks up more speed.

 

There’s an energy burning him away from the inside, powerful and yet dangerous, somehow connected to those tentacle-like whips that continue to propel him forward. But Izuku can’t pause long enough to even question where this quirk came from, let alone the strength it’s giving him. He’s moving too fast to even see properly, some instinctive combination of Pull and those whips keep things out of his way for him. All he can see is that white aura in the distance getting bigger--closer--and then it’s right in front of him. He’s moving too fast and he doesn’t realize it until he runs into Hitoshi, literally.

 

Izuku nearly knocks Hitoshi over, but manages to catch him with a hand on his upper arm. Shouto’s right next to him.

 

The first words out of Hitoshi’s mouth are, “I don’t know how long my quirk will last,” which quickly and succinctly explains the situation: Hitoshi has managed to restrain some dangerous villain with his quirk.

 

What this does not explain is the blood dripping down Shouto’s leg and Hitoshi’s face, nor the fact that they’re both barely standing. Izuku looks at them, at the blood and sweat and the white aura of pain that pulsates around them both. Izuku looks behind them, at the simmering black hole of bloodred that can only be the villain who did this to his friends.

 

“Who is it?” Izuku asks, still looking past them both. They were moving too slowly to put any real distance between them and the villain. It’s only a couple hundred feet away.

 

“I don’t know,” Hitoshi starts. He sounds exhausted, more exhausted than he usually does, like he’s staying awake through sheer willpower alone. “But his teeth--”

 

Ah.

 

Izuku knows who it is: “Moonfish.”

 

- - -

 

For a short, blissful moment, Hitoshi is so relieved to see Izuku that he nearly passes out right then and there. But then Hitoshi sees Izuku’s eyes, and his adrenaline is back.

 

Izuku’s eyes are bright red, glowing with a hostility that reminds Hitoshi of that hallway where they first met, right before the sports festival. The boy in front of Hitoshi barely looks like Izuku anymore. His whole body is shaking, moving, shivering and sometimes it looks there is something under Izuku’s skin, but it must just be his imagination. Izuku’s splattered in blood and he’s smiling and every cell in Hitoshi’s body is telling him to get out of Izuku’s way.

 

Next to him, Shouto tenses. They’re supporting each other’s weight without supporting their own, somehow. Shouto’s been hobbling with Hitoshi’s left leg while keeping them up, and Hitoshi’s about ready to topple over at any second.

 

“Okay!” Izuku says, in the same way he always does, except he’s looking past Hitoshi and his hands are balled into tight fists. “I’ll be right back!”

 

Izuku takes a step around them, but Shouto grabs onto his arm. “Where are you going?” It’s the first Shouto’s spoken since they managed to stand up, and his voice is too quiet. Shouto’s supposed to sound exactly the same in every situation, no matter what, but now he sounds like he can barely get the words out.

 

It disturbs Hitoshi more than either of their wounds, and reminds him of that scream he’d much rather forget.

 

“I’m going to take care of Moonfish,” Izuku answers with a cheer so toxic it makes Hitoshi want to throw up even more than he already did.

 

Hitoshi doesn’t get a chance to try and convince Izuku not to, because then Izuku’s eyes wide and glow a little brighter and nothing could have ever prepared Hitoshi for the red tentacles that burst out of Izuku’s right arm.

 

Shouto automatically tries to drag Hitoshi backwards, except Hitoshi has one more head injury than him so instead they both collapse. Frost plays at the ground around them, but Shouto’s long too exhausted to use his quirk effectively, so all it does is make Hitoshi shiver.

 

In front of them, Izuku struggles against the half-dozen tentacles that have taken his arm.

 

- - -

 

As Izuku tries to hold this mystery quirk back, an essay forms in his head, automatically.

 

Times New Roman. 12-point font. Double-spaced.

 

Just as his father would have wanted.

 

Title: Ways to Incapacitate Moonfish

Authors: Midoriya Izuku, et al.

USE BLACK WHIP USE BLACK WHIP USE BLACK WHIP IS FUELED BY RAGE USE BLACK WHIP USE RAGE GET STRONGER WITH HATE BLACK WHIP IS RED BLACK WHIP IS BLACK WHIP IS USE BLACK WHIP IT’S BEEN TOO LONG USE EMPATHY IS TOO STRONG IS TOO RED FIVE STOP USE BLACK WHIP USE BLACK WHIP DON’T USE BLACK WHIP USE BLACK WHIP STOP USE BLACK WHIP USE

 

The essay is loud and red and sounds like the man at the cliff who doesn’t exist. But Shouto and Hitoshi are right in front of him and they do exist. They both look half-dead with fear and that sobers Izuku as well as Aizawa’s quirk could.

 

Not now, not here. He needs to control it. For Shouto. For Hitoshi. For Uraraka and Iida and the rest of 1-a.

 

He doesn’t have the time for this, so he swallows it back down.

 

He can still feel Black Whip writhing under his skin, screaming in Times New Roman. He can use this. He can use this anger that suffocates him. How dare Moonfish. How dare they hurt his friends.

 

The essay is right. As long as he’s careful, he can use Black Whip. 

 

- - -

 

“Hitoshi,” Izuku says after the whips disappear, just as quickly and inexplicably as they had appeared. Izuku’s eyes are wide and his teeth are grit and it looks like he’s about to fall apart at the seams.

 

“I can do this,” Izuku continues. “I can control it for a couple minutes. Maybe three. It’ll be long enough. I just need you to do one thing, Hitoshi.”

 

Izuku pulls the both of them back to their feet. If Hitoshi looks at him too closely, he can see Izuku skin shivering, like there’s something underneath that wants to get out.

 

“I’m barely... conscious,” Hitoshi admits. He’s feeling a little better than he was five minutes ago, but his vision still blurs and he still feels like he’s on a boat instead of solid ground.

 

“You can do it,” Izuku states with confidence.

 

“But what if I can’t?”

 

“You can,” Shouto says, still too quiet. “I’ll help you.”

 

There’s nothing Hitoshi can say to Shouto’s sincerity. There never has been.

 

“I need you to stop me,” Izuku says. He looks into Hitoshi’s eyes, but Hitoshi has to look away. They’re too red and too dangerous and too not Izuku. “I will kill him if you do not stop me.”

 

Hitoshi’s first thought is: then I won’t stop you. He deserves to die. But his second thought is: Midoriya Izuku does not deserve to kill him.

 

“How?” Hitoshi asks.

 

“After I’ve incapacitated him, but before... you need to use your quirk. Order me to take control of the emotions. Word it exactly like that. Okay?”

 

After a moment, Hitoshi says, “Okay.”

 

- - -

 

“Uggghhhh,” Tomura whines. He collapses onto the couch, limbs sprawled out randomly. “I’m bored. I wanna fight. Kurogiri, do we have any spare nomu I could kill?”

 

“We do not, Shigaraki-san.”

 

“Fuck!” Tomura slams a hand against the back of the couch. At the last second, he lifts up his pinky finger. “This is so stupid! I hate this! Who’s idea was it to keep me trapped in this shitty-ass bar the whole time anyway?”

 

“Yours, Shigaraki-san."

 

“Fuck you! I know!”

 

He lets out another groan, grabs the closest object from the coffee table--a glass of some sort--and decays it between his fingers.

 

If he were to go out right now, he’d kill someone he shouldn’t, and Sensei would get mad.

 

But still, he really wishes he could’ve at least kept one of those other NPC party members with him to keep him entertained. But this is their debut, their test. They all get to be out there having fun so he and Sensei can--

 

That’s right! Sensei wanted to observe this Vanguard Action Squad group to collect data or some shit. That means he’s watching them somehow. He’s probably getting everything on video! Tomura has no idea how that works, but he doesn’t care.

 

He sits up. “Kurogiri! Those videos! Are they live?”

 

“I’m not sure--” Kurogiri starts, but then the TV screen clicks to life in time with Sensei’s corner monitor.

 

“I recommend this feed,” is all Sensei says before his monitor clicks off again.

 

The actual TV plays a surprisingly high-quality video of the forest. The lighting’s so cinematic it feels like a legitimate movie, with a dramatic red glow that casts sharp shadows against two figures. Wait a second. “Is that...” Tomura leans forward towards the screen as far as he can, so he’s nearly folded in half of the waist.

 

It’s Moonfish and Midoriya Izuku.

 

Tomura holds his breath.

 

The video begins with Moonfish on the ground, but shortly after Midoriya stepped into frame, the NPC sprang to his feet.

 

It doesn’t even last a full minute, but the whole time Tomura’s eyes are glued to the screen. He doesn't make a sound. He doesn’t move a single inch.

 

There is a ruthlessness in each of Midoriya Izuku’s strikes that makes Tomura’s heart jump each time. He’s using a quirk Tomura doesn’t recognize. At least one. As if he wasn’t already OP enough. He has some tentacle-like whips that drastically increase his range from close combat to a 15-or-so foot radius.

 

Will Tomura be able to keep up? Midoriya is stronger each time he sees him, but all Tomura’s done is collect some fucking Pokémon.

 

But it isn’t even about Midoriya’s increased D.C. This Midoriya is wholly different from the one who handled USJ and Stain, where he was all charisma and manipulation and conversation. This time, Midoriya’s pressed Esc thorough all the dialogue options and started round one with his Special.

 

It should be out of character. It shouldn't make any sense for Midoriya Izuku, the hero of peace, to snap Moonfish’s teeth off just a couple inches from his gums. It shouldn’t make any sense for Midoriya Izuku, who always tries talking first, to wrap a whip around Moonfish’s neck while smiling down at him.

 

And yet, it does make sense. Tomura gets the impression that this is more Midoriya Izuku than anyone’s ever seen before. This is the boy when he thinks no one is looking. This is the boy when he thinks he doesn’t have a choice.

 

Sensei’s always said there are two types of games: those you play, and those you win.

 

Midoriya is not playing this game. He’s winning.

 

The video starts again from Midoriya's entrance.

 

Tomura doesn’t care to question who’s controlling it or why because he can’t look away.

 

Beautiful.

 

He doesn’t realize he’s thought the word, but he has. Nothing’s ever made Tomura feel like this before. He wishes he were there. He wants to be there. More than anything in the world.

 

There is something comforting about the video, somehow. Something familiar in a way that makes Tomura experience longing for the first time. There is something in that frame Tomura wants to have. There is something in that frame Tomura wants to disintegrate between his fingertips.

 

He should’ve been there.

 

“Speedrun stats,” Tomura compliments automatically. Then, “I wanna see it.”

 

He should’ve been there. He should’ve been the one fighting Midoriya Izuku. Tomura would’ve put up a real fight, unlike that low-level red shirt NPC. Tomura might’ve even won. Tomura might’ve even lost.

 

He doesn’t look away from the third replay to order, “Kurogiri! Teleport me there right now!”

 

“Shigaraki-san, I don’t think that’s a good--”

 

Without looking, Tomura picks up the nearest object and throws it at Kurogiri. It just so happened to be a pillow that falls three feet short from even touching Kurogiri.

 

Tomura screams, “Fuck! I don’t care! I wanna see it!”

 

Kurogiri continues, “Sensei said--”

 

Sensei, Sensei, Sensei! Everything’s always about Sensei! But when is it ever about Tomura, huh?

 

He screams, again, but then a trick of the light makes it look like Sensei’s corner monitor is turning on, so he settles down.

 

“It’s a stupid rule,” Tomura mutters under his breath, too quiet for anybody to hear.

 

And yet the screen keeps playing those same sixty seconds and Tomura’s legs bounce up and down and up and down and there is an itch inside his wrist that he can’t scratch no matter how deep he goes and he needs to kill something, but not just anything.

 

Tomura needs to kill Midoriya Izuku.

 

- - -

 

To call it a fight would be rude exaggeration. It’s more an execution.

 

Hitoshi’s control over Moonfish drops and Izuku does not hesitate. There is a flurry of blows between those terrible teeth and those mysterious tentacles, too fast for Hitoshi to follow. It can’t last more than thirty seconds. Then a snapping sound echoes across the forest. Moonfish screeches, so loud it pounds like a nail into Hitoshi’s head, and most of Moonfish’s teeth are broken into short stubs, rendered useless.

 

It’s hard to believe this is the same villain who wounded both Hitoshi and Shouto. In front of Izuku, Moonfish looks like the child.

 

Barely a second after somehow snapping those teeth, Izuku’s whips are wrapped around Moonfish’s neck, and the villain can’t do anything about it.

 

And this is the hard part: how is Hitoshi supposed to know when to speak up? On average, it takes about seven minutes to strangle someone to death, but that’s for someone with normal human strength, not Midoriya Izuku. Hitoshi somehow has to find the time in between incapacitation and death.

 

Does he play it safe, or the other way round? Which would be worse, Izuku accidentally killing Moonfish, or Hitoshi stopping him too early and them all dying?

 

It feels obvious, but yet again it doesn’t.

 

Hitoshi opens his mouth, but Shouto shakes his head. Not yet.

 

But Izuku doesn’t look like he’s going to stop. He’s emanating a red haze that glows through the smoke. Through the red lighting, its hard to tell where the blood starts and ends. And Izuku stands above Moonfish, watching him suffocate with a smile and glowing red eyes.

 

Midoriya Izuku is, by far, the most terrifying person Hitoshi’s ever met. More so than Moonfish, more so than Nedzu, more so than that one foster “mother” who poisoned his coffee.

 

Hitoshi hates to admit it, or maybe he doesn’t, because instead of putting him off, it’s actually a comfort. The scariest person Hitoshi knows is also his best friend.

 

Moonfish finally stops his futile struggling, eyes open and unblinking, when Shouto nods.

 

“Izuku,” Hitoshi starts.

 

His friend does not react.

 

Hitoshi’s never won this game against Izuku before, so he can only hope that whatever’s going on in that head of his will distract him. Hitoshi should’ve planned this better--how to get Izuku to react--but he’s distracted and concussed and all he can see is red, just like... “Izuku, I like your shoes. Where’d you get them?”

 

Izuku turns, still smiling, and exclaims, “Oh, thanks! My father--”

 

Hitoshi activates his quirk: “Take control of your emotions. ”

 

The red glow drops instantly, as do those whips, like neither were ever there in the first place. For a moment, Izuku’s face is frighteningly blank, perfectly expressionless, as he steps over Moonfish’s body towards Hitoshi and Shouto.

 

Izuku says, “We need to reunite with the rest of the group. Let’s head back.” Then he takes a deep breath, looks between the two of them, and smiles--a real Midoriya Izuku smile, which is to say it isn’t happy at all, but it’s undoubtedly Midoriya Izuku.

 

Moonfish is unconscious. Izuku is here. Shouto is injured, but nothing life threatening.

 

They did it.

 

- - -

 

Izuku wants to stand in between Hitoshi and Shouto, to give them both a strong shoulder to lean on, but he can’t. He needs to protect them, to be ready to fight at a moment’s notice. Who knows how many villains are still out there?

 

So Izuku becomes Shouto’s right leg, as a compromise. Shouto’s in pain, but he’s more conscious than Hitoshi, so Shouto’s capable of supporting him with his left side. Like this, progress is slow, but it’s steady.

 

The further they get, the more Izuku’s head hurts. He can feel Regeneration trying it’s best to keep up with his body, but there are certain things it just can’t fix. Like exhaustion, something Izuku doesn’t have the privilege of feeling. So he keeps going, even if he has to pump One for All through his legs just to take another step. That fight with Moonfish took more out of him than he expected, both physically and mentally.

 

They make progress like that, quietly and carefully, until Izuku senses something creeping up behind them. A subtle turn of his head exposes a well-restrained medley of curiosity and hostility a hundred or so feet behind them.

 

“Don’t react,” Izuku whispers to Shouto. “Keep going ahead. I’ll stall for time.”

 

Shouto hesitates for a moment, but doesn’t complain as Izuku takes a step back. He turns around, smiles, and says in the general direction of the aura, “Hello! My name’s Midoriya Izuku. What’s yours?”

 

There is a rustling of leaves and then a man appears, balanced perfect atop a branch a few dozen feet away. He’s wearing an elaborate mask and is wrapped up in a purple cloak that makes him look like a stage magician. “Oh?” the man starts. “You don’t recognize me? I’m a little offended, to be honest, though your social pleasantries more than make up for it. You’re a rather respectful young man despite that terrifying expression on your face.”

 

Izuku should recognize him. He knows he should. But everything is too loud and despite Hitoshi’s quirk Black Whip is starting to scratch at the underside of his skin again and his vision is starting to blur and he can’t even tell how far away Shouto and Hitoshi have gotten. He can’t be exhausted. He needs to stall for time.

 

As long as Hitoshi and Shouto can reunite with the heroes, everything will be fine. Aizawa is out there somewhere, trying to keep them all safe. As long as they can get there. As long as Izuku can get them there.

 

“You speak of pleasantries, but you’ve yet to introduce yourself,” Izuku says.

 

“Ah! My sincerest apologies, Midoriya-kun. I do tend to speak around myself. It’s a bad habit. You can call me Mr. Compress.” He takes a flourished bow from his branch, a hand on his chest and legs crossed. “I’m with the League of Villains’ Vanguard Action Squad. Now, it’s my turn to ask a question. That boy over there with the purple hair wouldn’t happen to be Shinsou Hitoshi, would he?”

 

Damn. They haven’t gotten far enough away yet.

 

“Shinsou-kun?” Izuku tries for an awkward smile. “No, that’s a student from 1-B. I think his name is Hitamoro.”

 

Izuku cannot see Mr. Compress’ face, but he can hear the smile as the villain says, “You are a good liar, Midoriya-kun, but unfortunately for you, that was a rhetorical question.”

 

Izuku says,” I see. That is unfortunate,” and slides into a fighting stance.

 

Mr. Compress jumps backwards onto a further branch. “You wouldn’t mind keeping your distance, would you? You see, I’d be at quite the disadvantage trying to fight you in close quarters.” Then something launches at Izuku. At first it looks small, like a bullet, but as Izuku’s about to dodge it, it suddenly turns into a twenty-pound lifting weight, just as fast. His dodge had been calculated for a much smaller object, so it grazes his shoulder with enough force to dislocate it.

 

His left arm hangs limp for a few seconds longer than it should. Regeneration is struggling. It’s still working, but slower, and because of how long it lasts it hurts ten times more,

 

Izuku should recognize this villain, but he doesn’t. The correct wires aren’t firing. The right switches aren’t getting flipped. He doesn’t know if this is a bluff or not. Which should he go for? Close combat or ranged attacks?

 

It doesn’t take him long to decide. He doesn’t want to use Black Whip again if he can help it. Not when his heart rate is this high.

 

So Izuku sprints towards Mr. Compress. He wishes he could see his face for the reaction--was it the right move or not? But that mask is covering up any expression he might be making. At his heels, Izuku feels a biting cold. Shouto’s trying to help him. He should be running away, instead, but just knowing his friend is back there gives Izuku the strength to keep running and dodging.

 

Mr. Compress keeps throwing objects that change in size and weight as he retreats backwards across the trees. Despite dodging, Izuku’s still faster, and at some point Mr. Compress’ feet freeze to a branch, so Izuku catches up to him in just a couple seconds.

 

He readies a punch, still with a distance between them to be safe, but instead of dodging Mr. Compress leans into it.

 

“Caught you,” Mr. Compress says, and places a palm on Izuku’s shoulder.








 

 

It is dark and quiet and cold and Izuku is alone.

 

Where is he?

 

He can’t move. It’s like there’s nothing to move, or nowhere to move.

 

Where is he?

 

He tries to speak but no words come out. He tries to scream but no sound comes out oh god where is he?

 

He must be...

 

Izuku screams. Not again. Not again. He must be in the basement. Izuku screams and it doesn’t make a sound but his ears still bleed. Izuku is in the basement’s basement, a little closet that’s horizontal and six feet underground this must be his father’s punishment. He found out that Izuku escaped the first time around. This coffin is a sphere that Father has the key to except Izuku’s the one who locked the door from the inside. How’d he do that again? Where’s the key again? He’s sorry.

 

No, wait.

 

He isn’t.

 

Calmness washed over him like an ocean wave.

 

Izuku isn’t sorry.

 

He doesn’t regret leaving the basement. The only thing he regrets is that he didn’t get to spend more of the training camp with his friends, that he can’t keep protecting Shouto and Hitoshi.

 

That’s right. He isn’t sure where he is, but he needs to get out. Hitoshi’s still in danger. The League of Villains are still here. He needs to do something. He needs to help. He needs to be a hero, even if he has to do it alone.

 

You aren’t alone, a voice says, except it’s over a dozen voices in one. You have us.

 

And then there is a flash of rainbow light, and a violent shattering, and Izuku can breathe fresh air again.

 

Izuku opens his eyes just in time to watch Shinsou Hitoshi get dragged into that villain’s purple portal.

 

Izuku doesn’t have time to fight back. He doesn’t even know where he is right now, let alone who’s in his immediate vicinity. There could be a villain right behind him. God knows where Shouto is.

 

He doesn’t have time so he does the only thing he knows how to do. Izuku opens his mouth and says, “Take me instead!”

 

Hitoshi is halfway through the portal, but he’s no longer getting dragged in. He stays there, apparently unconscious, until a head pokes out next to him--gray hair and a disembodied hand covering the face.

 

Shigaraki Tomura takes off his mask to expose a face split into a smile that’s much, much too wide.

    Hope you enjoyed this chapter and its cute lil cliffhanger :)

Chapter 37: What would Midoriya Izuku do?
Notes:

    Warning for some relatively explicit gore plus character death (of a minor/side character) in scene 4

    As a treat, here were some alternative titles I was debating for this chapter: "Tomura-senpai" and "The first rule of improv"

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

“Take me instead!” shouts a voice from the other side of the portal.

 

Tomura recognizes it. He would recognize that voice anywhere.

 

Midoriya Izuku.

 

The purple-haired boy is still on the other side. Dabi’s in the process of dragging him through, so Tomura shoves Dabi out of the way and growls, “My turn.” He grabs a hold of the purple brat by the neck and takes half a step out of the portal, just enough to see and be seen.

 

There’s a forest on the other side, fresh air that Tomura hasn’t smelled in years. He scans the area, but it's only trees and a couple hero brats Tomura doesn’t care about and Midoriya Izuku.

 

Tomura pulls the hand off his face to make eye contact with Midoriya, finally getting to see that dangerous red in-person. Midoriya meets Tomura’s eyes without hesitation, without fear. 

 

“Tomura-senpai,” Midoriya says, and it sounds like an order.

 

There aren’t many people cocky enough to call him by his first name, and Midoriya’s the only one who’s ever tried senpai. It should piss him off, but instead it just reminds him of the last time they met, at that tea shop in the mall. It wasn’t that long ago, but it feels so very far away. Because Midoriya looks nothing like he did back then. He looks angry, but not desperate. Despite the fact that Midoriya’s shivering head-to-toe, he’s impressively composed.

 

Midoriya maintains their eye-contact and commands, in a confident tone that rivals Sensei’s, “Take me instead.”

 

There is no room for argument, all of it replaced with a heaviness in the air that gives Tomura goosebumps. If he were anyone else, he’d probably be afraid right now. Luckily he isn’t anybody but Shigaraki Tomura, so all he feels is excited.

 

Tomura smiles—or tries to, at least. He isn’t familiar with the expression at all, so he isn’t sure how it comes out.

 

The offer is tempting. Take Midoriya Izuku instead of this random, low-level hero NPC wannabe? If he turned Midoriya... If Midoriya were to become a villain... If Midoriya were to join him...

 

For the first time in his entire life, Tomura would seriously consider playing multiplayer. However...

 

Tomura stares into Midoriya’s eyes and states, “No.”

 

Tomura throws the hero student behind him, through the portal, back into the bar.

 

Letting Midoriya into the hideout right now would simply be suicide. Tomura knows better. Like this, right now, he’d have no chance if this turned into a dialogue, into a game of strategy and allegiances and words and smiles and lies. As he is, Tomura can’t win that game. But he can win a different one.

 

Midoriya’s expression does not change, but his body goes still.

 

There is a moment of silence while Tomura’s mind is blank—or maybe he’s thinking too much. It’s always been hard for him to tell.

 

He can’t help it. There is something about Midoriya that calls to him like a magnet. He can’t identify it, can’t name it. But it’s there.

 

It may be impossible to kidnap Midoriya, but he can’t help it. Tomura takes a step forward.

 

From the other side, in the bar, he can hear someone yelling at him to come back. The portal threatens to close, but Tomura waves at them with five fingers and takes another step forward, onto the forest floor.

 

Red lightning flickers across Midoriya’s skin and his eyes narrow. That look—one Tomura would never have expected to see on Midoriya Izuku’s face just an hour ago—that look is perfect. It’s familiar and terrifying and comforting and murderous and Tomura can’t look away.

 

The space between them crackles with bloodlust, and this time, Tomura knows it isn’t all his.

 

Tomura smiles, wide, and he slides into a fighting stance, hands ready. This is how it should be. Screw All Might. Screw The League. Screw Sensei.

 

This is what he’s been looking for his entire life. 

 

All Tomura wants is to fight Midoriya Izuku to the death.

 

He doesn’t care whose death it’ll be.

 

He’s been waiting for this forever. So he smiles wide and says, “Game start, Izuku.”

 

Midoriya’s eyes widen, and for half a moment he looks scared and confused, but it doesn’t last long.

 

Because the lightning disappears and Midoriya crumples to the ground.

 

Tomura stares for at least six seconds before it truly kicks in.

 

Midoriya is unconscious.

 

“That is so not fair! Fuck!”

 

Tomura spins around and stomps back into the bar, the portal closing behind him.

 

- - -

 

Hitoshi’s half-consciousness finally drifts closer to consciousness with the help of getting splashed with cold water. He comes to just in time to hear someone ask in a surprisingly polite tone, “Is anyone going to mention the elephant in the room?” He thinks he recognizes the voice as the last villain Hitoshi really remembers. The one who made Izuku disappear and trapped Hitoshi in some sort of prison bubble. Was it... Compress?

 

As Hitoshi’s vision finally settles into some sort of focus, he finds himself gagged and tied to a chair in the middle of a bar that’s sending massively mixed signals. The building itself is old and rotting in places and everything is covered in at least one layer of dust. And yet there’s a fancy flatscreen TV and the couch in front of it looks new and everything smells a little like bleach.

 

Oh, and the room is filled with villains.

 

“Hey!” a girl in a high school outfit, covered in blood, exclaims. “That’s offensive to elephants! Don’t compare them to Muscular!”

 

They must be discussing the large man held hostage a dozen feet in front of Hitoshi. He’s in a similar position, except he’s restrained by two of those purple beasts that Hitoshi thinks are called nomus. Muscular’s awake and gagged and shaking with fear, and he looks pretty messed up. His nose is broken, at least one of his shoulders is probably dislocated, he’s covered in bruises and dirt and blood and little broken twigs and burn marks.

 

“Before we can start the next level,” hisses a voice that instantly activates Tomura’s fight or flight reflex to flight. The voice is packed full of annoyance and violence, and comes from the man sitting at the bar, covered in hands. Shigaraki Tomura continues, “You all have to watch a cutscene.”

 

“Oh fun!” the girl exclaims. Another villain groans, “Boring,” then, in an entirely different tone, “I love cutscenes!”

 

“Do you have lines?” Shigaraki asks in a voice deceptively calm, in sharp contrast to his earlier annoyance. Somehow, it’s even more frightening. The leader of the League of Villains stands up slowly, then walks up to the villain in the black and gray getup that makes him look like an off brand Deadpool. Shigaraki takes off that weird hand-mask. He’s an inch-or-so-shorter, but he does not hesitate to stare the other villain directly in the eyes. “Do you have lines?” he repeats.

 

“What?” Twice barks. “Yes! No! I mean—what?”

 

Shigaraki raises a hand, slowly, and the villain scurries backwards as far as he can. “Sorry! Sir!” he salutes from the other side of the room.

 

Shigaraki takes a deep breath and turns around so Hitoshi can see his face—it’s the first time he’s seen it, and if it weren’t for the gag he’d have to stop himself from making a retort about dry skin and Eucerin.

 

“If you don’t have any lines in the cutscene,” Shigaraki starts in that same tone, even and in-control but then his face twists into anger and he suddenly yells at the top of his lungs, “Shut the fuck up!”

 

The room is silent, salient with fear.

 

This is the leader of the League of Villains. A man capable of controlling a room of some of the most dangerous villains in Japan. A man capable of scaring them. 

 

Shigaraki slowly walks up to Muscular. He places a hand on Muscular’s shoulder—four fingers only—but nonetheless Muscular starts thrashing against his restraints and screaming past the gag.

 

- - -

 

With four fingers on Muscular’s shoulder, Tomura declares, “We are The League of Villains, and we have one rule.” It’s stupid as shit and he hates it, but he can’t let these NPC’s know that. He needs them to respect that rule as much as they’re fucking capable of. Because it’s what Sensei wants. And all Tomura wants is for Sensei to be happy...

 

For some reason that thought settles with less oomf than Tomura’s used to, but he doesn’t have the luxury, let alone the desire, to think about that, so he just announces: “No killing kids.”

 

Across from him, the Shinsou brat flinches, and his eyebrows scrunch up in confusion.

 

“That’s right, brat,” Tomura says even though the words make him want to kill himself, “we may be villains, but we aren’t heartless monsters.” Except for Tomura, of course, and he’d take pride in that heartlessness if Sensei let him. “Isn’t that right?”

 

“That’s right!” Spinner yells.

 

“I said shut up!” Tomura instinctively digs his fifth finger into Muscular’s skin and the man  convulses and screeches as his shoulder decays for just a moment before Tomura lifts it back up.

 

The room settles back into a silence and Tomura continues, “We aren’t like those background NPC thugs on every street corner.” This is his moment. He just needs to pretend like he’s playing some Telltale game where everything he says matters to these idiots in front of him. Propaganda.

 

He hates this, but he doesn’t have a choice. All he wants is to kill something— someone— anything— but he has to do this for Sensei, so...

 

What would Midoriya Izuku say?

 

He’d use Stain, he’d use everything he could. He’d say what these losers want him to say, even if the words threatened to poison him from the inside.

 

“We’re better than Stain,” Tomura declares. “We don’t kill kids. We’re better than those petty criminals and those villains who have no purpose in life, who are simply lashing out. Because we do. Because we have a mission.” Tomura may not know what it is, but Sensei has one, and everyone in front of him thinks they know what it is—thinks it’s whatever they want it to be. “And we will do anything we can to achieve it, except kill a child. You’re allowed to beat them up, you’re allowed to break their bones. Hell, you’re allowed to put one in a fucking coma or cut off a leg. I don’t care. As long as you don’t kill them. You can’t even think about killing one. You can’t even try to kill one. Because you know what’ll happen if you do?”

 

Tomura hesitates one moment before lifting up his hand to decay Muscular’s gag.

 

Muscular spits out blood then starts pleading. “I’m sorry. I wouldn’t have actually—I couldn’t have actually done it. That kid’s a monster. Do you even know how many quirks he has?”

 

Tomura’s eyes widen. “Don’t tell me—you tried to kill Midoriya fucking Izuku?”

 

After a moment, Muscular nods. Tomura can’t help it. He laughs. Long and loud except there’s no joy in it. The elation doesn’t last because Tomura should’ve been there. Why the fuck do all these low-level loser NPC’s get to fight Midoriya but as soon as he tries the kid logs off? Is Tomura playing on hard mode? Did someone turn PVP off?

 

If Muscular fought Midoriya, that answers the question of how he ended up at the bottom of the cliff. “That explains how you ended up—”

 

“I wasn’t going to—” Muscular interrupts. “I wouldn’t—”

 

Tomura’s blood boils. Fury fills his body. How dare he. How dare this insignificant pile of—! He got to fight Midoriya and he sure as hell didn’t even appreciate it. Such a waste. And now he fucking interrupts! How dare he?

 

Tomura leans forward until his mouth is right next to Muscular’s ear, then whispers, “Don’t you dare interrupt me.”

 

Muscular’s eyes widen, and he starts stammering out nonsensical half-phrases, “Wait. Wait wait wait. You? Him? I don’t. This is crazy!” He devolves into a twisted laughter that’s half sobs. “You’re all crazy! You’re—Midoriya’s—”

 

Tomura digs all five of his fingers into Muscular’s thigh and that laughter finally turns into sweet, sweet screams.

 

Above the screams, Tomura tells the bar, “You all better watch my cut scene or you’ll be next. No looking away. No closing your eyes. No cheating. That applies to you, too, hero brat. This is what happens if you piss me off.”

 

- - -

 

Hitoshi wants to look away. Hitoshi wants to close his eyes. Hitoshi wants to dissociate.

 

This is torture, not just for Muscular, but for him too.

 

Shigaraki has a precise control over his quirk that is in sharp contrast to his volatile personality. Somehow, against all odds, Muscular is still alive. Shigaraki decayed his right leg over a span of too many minutes, laughing the entire time. Muscular is still conscious, screeching and screaming and screeching and screaming and screeching until Shigaraki moves on to dig his quirk into Muscular’s right arm, and he finally quiets.

 

Dust fills the air. Human dust.

 

Hitoshi nearly throws up—his body lurches forward until all he can see are his shoes—but he fights to swallow it down since he’s gagged. His eyes water and he can taste the weird coffee meal supplement drink Eraserhead gave him that morning. Or was it the morning before?

 

When he sits up again his whole body freezes. Shigaraki is crouched right in front of him, staring him dead in the eyes. Those eyes are bright red, and they remind Hitoshi of something, but he’s too distracted with trying not to die to place it.

 

“I said don’t look away,” Shigaraki whispers. He’s smiling. It’s worse because he actually looks honestly happy, like he’s having the time of his life. “Your free trial is over, now. From here on out, you only have one heart left.” After another full minute of eye contact, Shigaraki steps back and returns to decaying Muscular’s right arm.

 

The whole thing takes way too long. Hitoshi isn’t sure exactly how the time passes, but Muscular must survive at least the first twenty minutes. Shigaraki keeps going though, pacing his quirk dangerously slow, eating away at Muscular’s body from the limbs in. He leaves the head for last, and then there’s literally nothing left but a pile of dust.

 

After staring at it for a moment, Shigaraki kicks it, puffing the dust into the air. Hitoshi tries to hold his breath but he can only do it for so long, and then he’s breathing in a human being.

 

After another minute, Shigaraki turns around. He’s frowning, and scratching at his scalp with the same hand that disintegrated Muscular. He grumbles, “Well that was anticlimactic.” Shigaraki throws his arm down, exasperated, and continues in that apathetic tone that somehow conveys a primal danger, “Whatever.” He looks over the room of villains with a confident haughtiness. “Any questions?” he asks.

 

Perhaps it’s because his heart rate is the highest it’s ever been in his entire life, or because he’s actively breathing in human, but Hitoshi almost wants to laugh. It’s crazy. This is crazy. Any questions? Really?

 

There are a couple seconds of silence before someone starts applauding, then more join in. The high school girl runs up to Shigaraki but at the last second decides not to give him a hug, instead opting to join the applause and cheer, “That was awesome Shigaraki-kun! Best cutscene ever! Can I have your autograph?”

 

The tonal whiplash makes Hitoshi’s head spin. Is this really happening? Is this real? How’d he end up here, again? How is this happening? Just a few hours ago he was having the time of his life, failing miserably to make Shouto laugh. And now Hitoshi’s here. Breathing in a human body, watching a teenage girl who’s probably killed people fangirling over a criminally insane gamer incel.

 

Muscular was right. This is crazy.

 

“No,” Shigaraki states. Then, “Everybody out.”

 

There’s a moment where nobody reacts, until that highschool girl whines, “Awwww. That so isn’t fair, Shigaraki-kun! Aren’t we party members now?”

 

Shigaraki sighs. “Fine. Whatever. But you guys stay over there—” he beckons towards the TV “—and leave me alone. This side quest is single player only.”

 

All the villains in the room dutifully shuffle to the couch setup.

 

Then Shigaraki steps up to Hitoshi. “We know how your quirk works,” Shigaraki states. “You say something, someone responds, you get to control them, or whatever. The counter is physical pain.”

 

How in hell do they know how his quirk works?

 

Shigaraki continues, “So go ahead. Try to escape. It’ll be fun, for me of course.”

 

And then Shigaraki reaches a hand towards Hitoshi’s face and decays the gag out of his mouth. Hitoshi spits out the dust that managed to get in, then takes a second to stretch out his jaw. His whole body is shaking with fear. This tonally-insane situation combined with his concussion has probably made him a little delusional, because Hitoshi can’t stop his mouth from saying, “Tomura, right? That’s your name? I’ve been wondering about this for a while now. It’s incredibly important. Perhaps it’s the most important question you’ll ever be asked...” He looks up, tries to meet Shigaraki’s eyes but can’t force his body to do it, then continues, “Why do you have the same shoes as Midoriya Izuku?”

 

“Huh?” Shigaraki asks as he looks down at his own feet.

 

Hitoshi can feel the thread of his quirk, but he isn’t far gone enough to try to activate it. He’s surrounded by more villains than he’s aware of, and they all know how his quirk works. There’s no way he can use it in this situation.

 

“Whatever,” Shigaraki snarls. He looks at Hitoshi to say, “Join us. Become a villain, Shinsou Hitoshi.”

 

Maybe he is going crazy, because Hitoshi wants to laugh again.

 

Shigaraki says it with such weight, a glint in his eyes, as if Hitoshi hasn’t been hearing those words his entire life. It’s crazy, really. Hitoshi’s spent his entire life denying villainy, why would he flip now.

 

And yet, in the seconds of heavy silence, Hitoshi manages to recognize this for what it is—a thread, a string, an opportunity.

 

He can’t just say no—that’s the first rule of improv, never say no. If Ms. Joke taught him anything, that was it. Hitoshi knows what would happen if he did—if he’s lucky, it will only hurt. He witnessed first-hand how good Shigaraki is at keeping people alive.

 

While every cell of his body is screaming at him to stick to his morals, to insist he’d never be a villain, that he’s a hero through and through, Hitoshi knows what he’s supposed to do.

 

He can’t be too eager, nor too reluctant.

 

He hopes this doesn’t last long, that he’ll be rescued in a few hours, but the pessimist-realist in him must plan for more—for the long-term—the long con.

 

What would Midoriya Izuku do?

 

Hitoshi stretches his lips into a smile that says fuck you silently.

 

Ah, he’s terrified. Shigaraki Tomura is much, much scarier than Moonfish.

 

But there’s at least one person Shigaraki isn’t scarier than: Midoriya Izuku. And that is what gives Hitoshi the strength to spit out, “Why the fuck would I do that?”

 

Shigaraki’s smile matches Hitoshi’s. He’s standing a few feet away, but the distance does nothing to comfort Hitoshi. “Other than keeping your life?”

 

“Threats? Really?” Hitoshi rolls his eyes, leans back in the chair like he’s comfortable being handcuffed in the middle of a villain den. But he doesn’t try to hide the nervous shaking of his hands, the sweat dripping down his face. He wants Shigaraki to recognize his confidence as fake, to notice Hitoshi’s fear. Not like he has a choice. “And I’m a minor, anyway. You can’t kill me. Wasn’t that what your whole little cutscene was all about?”

 

Shigaraki smirks, stands up a little straighter.

 

“Sell it to me,” Hitoshi says as if he has control over the situation, as if he isn’t terrified for his life. “Why should I sacrifice everything, betray the institutions of heroes, for you?”

 

Shigaraki laughs, a grating sound that’s absolutely already traumatized Hitoshi indefinitely. 

 

“I see it now,” Shigaraki grunts out, and Hitoshi’s terrified of whatever he sees. “I see why Sensei likes you.”

 

Hitoshi’s heart stops. He doesn’t know who Sensei is but he can tell by the shift in the room that he’s important, that Hitoshi does not want to be liked by this man. As soon as Shigaraki said the title, the room got suddenly cold. Based on the subtle shift in body language from the other villains, Hitoshi can tell that this Sensei holds more power than Shigaraki.

 

“What would you stay for?” Shigaraki asks. He walks back to the bar and sits down, but maintains eye contact with Hitoshi. “You have no friends, and it’s not like any of those other hero brats will ever understand you. You’re different from them. Everyone knows it.”

 

Shigaraki is right—or he would’ve been—and that thought is what scares Hitoshi the most. That if Shigaraki had pulled him aside a year ago—hell, three weeks ago—Hitoshi might have ( might have) turned. Just for the promise of comradery—of friendship—something he’s never—no, he had never had.

 

Hitoshi wants to bite back. He wants to brag about the friends he has. Shouto and Izuku. He wants to retort something like, And what, you have friends? But he doesn’t, because the first rule of improv is yes, and so instead Hitoshi lies, “You’re right.” This lie comes easy, because it is one he’s believed his entire life, up until just a couple days ago.

 

- - -

 

This is not the kind of game Tomura usually plays, but it is a little fun - just a little. As much fun as, perhaps, League of Legends, but nowhere near the levels of Dark Souls, for obvious reasons. The hero brat is playing the game, which makes it more bearable, and perhaps that’s why he’s given the guy so many second chances. Also because he wants to win this fucking side quest, even if it’s annoying as shit. And that requires an actual conversation, unfortunately.

 

If Sensei hadn’t suggested Tomura use his Charisma stat for this, he would’ve simply tortured the boy into submission. This side quest is two-pronged: recruit the kid, and get information. Tomura is infinitely more interested in the second goal, but to get the most XP, to 100% this, Tomura has to do this talking stuff he hates so much, which is why he keeps asking himself: what would Midoriya do?

 

But it’s a hard question to answer because Tomura is sure that if Midoriya were a villain trying to turn Shinsou, he wouldn’t have kidnapped him in the first place. Midoriya would have approached him, seemingly by coincidence, months back. Midoriya would’ve befriended him, convinced the NPC that Midoriya was his only friend in the entire world. And by then, it’d be too late for Shinsou to say no.

 

But Shigaraki is Tomura and this is just a side quest for extra points, so he’ll have to compromise.

 

He won’t hurt him, yet. He’ll save that. For when it’ll make the most impact. The final nail in the head, or whatever the saying is.

 

For now, Tomura will play the game, and see how far he can get without violence.

 

- - -

 

Before Hitoshi realizes it, Shigaraki’s decayed the ropes tying Hitoshi to the chair.

 

Shigaraki nods his head towards the bar and the portal-man standing behind it. “What’ll you have?” he asks. Shigaraki returns to his seat, then kicks the stool next to him expectantly.

 

Hitoshi can’t keep up with these tonal mood shifts. He has no idea what to expect next from this man, but it doesn’t matter. The first rule of improv is don’t say no, so Hitoshi stands up. His legs are so wobbly with fear, exhaustion, and a probable concussion that he nearly falls over immediately. But he manages to catch himself and shuffle over, sitting down directly next to Shigaraki. Being this close to the villain is more than a little concerning, and it makes him sweat even more than he was earlier, but it’s not like a couple feet matter. Shigaraki could kill Hitoshi in a heartbeat even if he were across the room.

 

What would Midoriya Izuku do now?

 

Hitoshi needs to keep this ball rolling. Yes, and.

 

Hitoshi does not like drinking—maybe it's a side effect of his quirk but he hates how out of control it makes him feel. Anyway, there’s a different substance he’s addicted to, and he knows it’s a long shot, but he can’t help but ask the man behind the bar, “Do you have coffee?”

 

A light shines in the villain’s eyes, and even though he doesn’t really have a mouth, it looks like he’s smiling. “Yes, sir. Of course. We have an espresso machine.”

 

Hitoshi takes this opportunity to simultaneously stall and maybe gain some information. So he asks, “What kind? Manual or automatic?”

 

“The Jamaagaana Super Automatic. We just got it in a few days ago.”

 

That’s... weird. Not only because the bar looks like it’s about to fall apart, but also because, well... it’s just a coincidence, but something about it makes Hitoshi’s skin crawl. It’s a hard machine to get, but for some reason Hitoshi’s seen it twice in one week. Here, and at... it’s just a coincidence.

 

He needs to stall. Get information. Improv. Hitoshi asks, like Shigaraki Tomura isn’t sitting right next to him, “One: how in hell can y’all afford that and two: why?”

 

The man behind the bar starts to answer, but Shigaraki groans out, “Borrrring. What is this, an ad break?” Shigaraki places one of his hands on the bartop and leans closer to Hitoshi. He lowers his voice to ask, “You know him, right? Midoriya Izuku?” His tone is much too conversational, like they’re old friends exchanging gossip.

 

Why? Why in hell would Shigaraki Tomura be asking about Midoriya?

 

“Uh, not really,” Hitoshi starts. He leans backwards to get as much space between them as he can. “We hang with different crowds. He’s a popular kid and I’m, y’know, me.”

 

Shigaraki stares at him then says, “Considering your quirk, you really should be a better liar.”

 

Hitoshi’s blood runs cold. Other than Midoriya, he hasn’t met anyone yet who’s been able to catch him in a lie. While he’s sure Nedzu could, not even Eraserhead can. So how can Shigaraki? He’s good at scaring people, but Hitoshi just can’t believe he’s better than Eraserhead when it comes to emotional intelligence. Maybe he’s just taking a shot. Maybe he doesn’t really know.

 

But maybe he does.

 

Hitoshi is a gambler. And he refuses to spill any info about Izuku. No matter what it takes.

 

This is not what Midoriya Izuku would say, but Hitoshi is not Midoriya Izuku, so he retorts, “Considering you’re the leader of a bunch of manic villains, you really should have better EQ.”

 

Shigaraki just lets out a sharp laugh. “Your level’s so low you can’t even see the CR, kid. You have potential, but you’re nowhere near my level. Not in this game.”

 

Maybe it’s because Shigaraki just brought him up, but his phrasing reminds Hitoshi of what Izuku said right after their battle at the sports festival: I have more experience than you.

 

There is something in Shigaraki’s eyes, something dark, twisted, that looks familiar, but Hitoshi still can’t place it.

 

“Tell me about Midoriya Izuku,” Shigaraki says, and this time it’s not a question.

 

He wants to say no. He wants to spit in Shigaraki’s face and swear he’ll never betray his friend. But that’s not the Shinsou Hitoshi that Tomura wants to see. And if Hitoshi lets slip that he and Izuku are actually friends, that could turn into something Shigaraki can use against them both. So Hitoshi says, “If you wanted to know about him so bad why didn’t you take him instead? Hell, he offered, didn’t he?”

 

Shigaraki just raises an eyebrow. “Fuck that. I’m not an idiot,” he says. “The moment I let him in here, it’s game over.”

 

There is hostility in his voice, anger, annoyance. But underneath it, Hitoshi can sense a little baby seedling of fear, wrapped up in a surprising layer of respect.

 

Yes, and.

 

He’s poking a bear with a short stick, but Hitoshi still says, “You respect him.”

 

Shigaraki growls, his eyebrows furrow, and he scowls in a perfect rendition of offense.

 

He must still be in denial. Why would an adult villain respect a teen hero? Well, calling Shigaraki an adult is a little bit of a stretch, but the point still stands.

 

“Respect?” Shigaraki hisses out, leans a little closer. This button Hitoshi’s pushed is a little cliche, but it’s interesting to see how riled up he’s getting.

 

But then Shigaraki says, “Respect? Of course I fucking respect Midoriya Izuku.”

 

Huh?

 

That is... not at all what Hitoshi was expecting, so he just stares blankly at Shigaraki’s red eyes—still familiar, still unplaceable.

 

Hitoshi feels like he has a handful of puzzle pieces, all of the pieces he needs to finish it, he just has no idea what the final image is, nor even where the edges are. But he has all the pieces he needs to solve it, and he’s one epiphany away from pulling an Isagi from Blue Lock. There have been too many coincidences for them to be coincidences. The shoes. The espresso machine. More experience. Shigaraki’s eyes. Respect.

 

There is something here, something so close that will allow him to see the puzzle’s picture, but he just can’t reach it.

 

“Pardon me,” the portal man interrupts. He sets a small mug on the countertop. “I didn’t know what you wanted, so I just made an americano, black.”

 

It smells good, and Hitoshi picks up the distraction and takes a sip. It tastes good, too, good enough to give him a small burst of confidence. He needs to keep going, to keep Shigaraki distracted from whatever the fuck he wants with Izuku.

 

“This sensei of yours, he’s the one in charge?” Hitoshi asks.

 

Shigaraki’s eyebrow twitches. He leans back and starts scratching at his wrist.

 

A weakness? Something he can exploit? How?

 

“Yes,” Shigaraki hisses out.

 

For want of anything better to ask, “Can I meet him?”

 

Shigaraki stills, then breaks into a wild laughter. “Meet him? You wouldn’t last two minutes.”

 

“What, he’d kill me? Isn’t that against your rules?”

 

“Kill you? Don’t underestimate him. He’d open his mouth and three sentences in you’d wish you were dead, but he wouldn’t kill you... he wouldn’t have to.”

 

Again, again, something that feels so important but Hitoshi can’t unravel it. If he weren’t exhausted, if he weren’t concussed, if he weren’t terrified for his life, he’d probably be able to figure it out. But he is all of those things, so instead the only thing he can do is store the information somewhere in his liquid brain, and keep asking questions. “Huh. What’s his quirk?”

 

Shigaraki smiles, then after a moment, “What isn’t?”

 

Data, data, data. Hitoshi still doesn’t know what to do with any of it. That’s alright. He doesn’t have to. He just needs to bring it back intact to the heroes. To Nedzu and Aizawa and Izuku. They’ll know how to decipher it.

 

No killing kids. A mission. Stain. Money. The Jamaagaana. Same shoes. Eyes. Midoriya. Sensei. Talking. Quirks.

 

It’s going to drive him crazy, if Shigaraki doesn’t do so first.

 

“You can’t press dodge forever,” Shigaraki grumbles. “Tell me about Midoriya.”

 

This obsession is dangerous. Hitoshi isn’t sure what Shigaraki’s deal is, but whatever it is, it definitely isn't good.

 

Hitoshi must hesitate too long because Shigaraki continues, “I tried playing this game your way.” Despite the fact that Shigaraki’s looking directly at him, Hitoshi knows whoever your is, it isn’t him.

 

Shigaraki props an elbow up on the countertop and rests his chin in his hand. “But it’s getting boring.”

 

Before Hitoshi can react, Shigaraki’s free hand is on his neck, four fingers burning Hitoshi’s skin. Hitoshi doesn’t breathe, doesn’t move a single millimeter. He can’t. He doesn’t even blink. Four fingers. If the fifth drops...

 

Shigaraki trails his fingers down, across Hitoshi’s shoulder, down past his shortsleeves, gripping onto the bare skin of his upper arm.

 

The only reason Hitoshi hasn’t thrown up is because he’s too afraid to. It’s been months since anyone’s touched him, and normal physical contact already disturbs him, let alone when it’s so threatening.

 

Four fingers.

 

For the first time Hitoshi considers praying, but he has no idea who to.

 

Shigaraki leans in close enough for Hitoshi to smell his breath. It smells like a wet dog’s dead body with a hint of, unfortunately, Jolly Ranchers. Green apple flavor.

 

“Tell me about Midoriya Izuku or I’ll do it.”

 

Despite his heartate, despite the nausea that eats away at his stomach, despite his life flashing before his eyes, Hitoshi maintains eye contact. Yes, and. Stall for time. Stall. That’s all he needs to do. Stall.

 

“You don’t believe me?” Shigaraki asks, with a tilt of his head and that wide smile like a hyena’s.

 

No. That isn’t the case at all. Hitoshi believes him. With every goosebump across his skin, Hitoshi believes he’ll do it. But it doesn’t matter, because no matter what, Hitoshi isn’t going to give Shigaraki anything he can use against Izuku. He’d bite his own tongue off first.

 

But before it comes to that, Hitoshi has more things in his arsenal that he can stall with. “You want to know about Midoriya?” Hitoshi asks. “Fine, I’ll tell you something you don’t know...”

 

Shigaraki smiles.

 

Hitoshi lies the first thing that comes to mind, “Midoriya's single. And rumors have it he’s into wrinkly villains with a fetish for video games, so you actually have a chance. I can give him your number the next time I see him, if you let me go.”

 

Shigaraki’s smile twitches, but it doesn’t disappear. “Okay,” the villain says, and it sounds more like a threat than anything else he’s said.

 

Hitoshi holds his breath for that fifth finger to come down except—

 

There’s a knock on what must be the front door. Two, pristine knocks.

 

Shigaraki freezes. From the other side of the room that girl in the school uniform cheerfully announces, “Come in!”

 

And then the door opens.

 

And Midoriya Izuku steps into the bar.

Chapter Text

Thirty minutes earlier

 

Someone is saying his name.

 

Izuku.

 

He can’t tell who it is. Sometimes it sounds like Shigaraki Tomura, sometimes it sounds like his father, sometimes it sounds like a dozen voices at once.

 

The first thing he notices, as he drifts slowly awake, is the smell. It smells like home, but Izuku can tell by the temperature that it isn’t. And then he opens his eyes. A hospital.

 

He doesn’t recognize the ceiling, and perhaps that’s why he stares at it long enough to notice. Or perhaps he never had a choice.

 

The ceiling is a series of large, beige tiles, each splattered randomly with small dots of charcoal gray paint. It’s a perfectly normal ceiling, but Izuku notices anyway. Breaking the randomness of those paint splotches is a pattern. A pattern Izuku recognizes as a code. A code his father taught him.

 

The code is incredibly subtle, and by design versatile, but Izuku’s been trained to detect it against natural patterns. It’s nothing more than scattered, discolored splatters—a slightly sharper black than the rest. Their location in each square, how far away they are from the center, tells him the correct order to read them in. Their orientation, relation to other splatters, and shape tell him which character they represent.

 

Still half-asleep, Izuku translates the code automatically.

 

For some reason, it says Shinsou Hitoshi is here, an address for somewhere on the edge of town, and come alone.

 

Izuku lets out a small breath. Thank god.

 

He doesn’t have the luxury to question what the address is doing on the ceiling of his hospital room. It’s almost definitely a trap. But if there’s any chance at all that Hitoshi’s there, Izuku will go. Without hesitation.

 

He sits up. Luckily, there’s no hero or teacher in the room and he finds his backpack on a chair next to the bed. His hero costume is still in there, right where he left it, and his boots are placed on the floor. He quickly gets changed into the costume, then considers the notepad on the nightstand.

 

Come alone.

 

For a moment, he debates leaving a note, but decides against it.

 

Instead, he clicks the button on the bed frame that contacts the nurse, and opens the window.

 

- - -

 

Shouta does another round through the floor. They’ve commandeered the entire fourth floor of the hospital for the students and heroes involved in the training camp fiasco. Shouta has his own room, since he got a little banged up, but that doesn’t stop him from circulating.

 

He’s worried. In theory, the attack is over, but because Shinsou Hitoshi is missing, it doesn’t feel that way. It leaves him on edge, ready, waiting. So he peeks his head in every room, checks on every student.

 

He’s walking through the hallway when a nurse jogs towards him. “Room 415,” she says, a little out of breath, and she doesn’t have to say anything else for Shouta to run there with her.

 

When he throws open the door to Midoriya’s room, his heart drops into his stomach.

 

Midoriya’s sitting on the windowsill, one leg already draped over the edge. He smiles something sad when he says, quietly, “I’m glad it was you.”

 

Shouta stops breathing.

 

Midoriya continues, “I know you won’t approve, but this is something I have to do.”

 

“It isn’t,” Shouta says, even though he isn’t even sure what Midoriya’s talking about. But Shouta can guess.

 

Shinsou Hitoshi is still missing.

 

“I’m here for you, Izuku. Please.”

 

Midoriya’s still in the windowsill, still talking, “I know, but I have to do this alone. I just wanted to say goodbye. I expect I won’t ever see you again—”

 

What? Shouta takes a step forward, automatically, only for Midoriya to flinch back.

 

What the hell is going on in that head of his?

 

Has everything Shouta’s done up to this point been for naught? He thought they’d made progress. He thought Izuku was opening up. They even hugged, and yet…

 

There’s still this distance between them that Shouta can’t cross alone.

 

“You don’t have to do this,” Shouta pleads. He hasn’t felt this desperate—this lost—in over a decade. He needs to be rational to effectively communicate with Izuku. He needs to think. Logic. What’s happening? How can he stop this? But his brain is drowning in salt water and all that comes out is emotion: “You can survive this, just let me—”

 

“Survive?” Izuku lets out a sad laugh and shakes his head. “That isn’t the issue. Even if I survive...” Izuku looks like an eighty-year-old man who has already come to terms with the fact that he only has two months left to live. “I doubt my father will let me come back.”

 

Come back where? UA? Japan? Why not? Why wouldn’t his father let him?

 

“Izuku, talk to me.” There is a desperation in Shouta’s voice that doesn’t belong there. His vision wanes, blurs, all he can focus on is the image of Izuku sitting on that windowsill, smiling like he’s about to kill himself. “Please, let me help you.”

 

That’s all Shouta wants. Please.

 

Izuku shakes his head. “Could you let my friends know—all of 1-A? These past two months have been the best of my life. Thank you.”

 

And Izuku starts to tilt backwards. Shouta knows he won’t be able to restrain Izuku with force, so he yells the only thing he can think of—he isn’t sure if it’ll work or not, it might make this whole situation infinitely worse—but he yells it anyway:

 

“Your father is missing!”

 

Izuku freezes, and the lamp in the corner next to the window starts flickering yellow. For half a moment, he looks absolutely terrified: eyes wide and lips quivering.

 

But Izuku stays in the windowsill, and for now that’s all that matters.

 

“I’ll protect you,” Shouta insists. He takes a step forward, slowly, carefully; god his heart is pounding against his throat so hard he can’t breathe right. “I’ll do whatever it takes. If you want to stay at UA, in 1-A, I’ll make it happen. I don’t care who stands in my way, whether it be your father or the devil himself, I’ll make it happen. I swear . Please, Izuku, just talk to me or—” He’s just rambling at this point, trying anything he can. “I’ll go with you. Just us. I don’t care. Whatever this is, we can do it—together. Please.”

 

“Together...” for some reason, Izuku looks up at the ceiling. “I’m sorry, Aizawa-sensei, and... thank you for always being there for me. I mean it.”

 

And Izuku smiles.

 

And Izuku falls.

 

By the time Shouta’s sprinted to the window, Izuku’s already gone.

 

Shouta calls Nedzu before he’s conscious of the action. He can hear his own voice like it’s someone else speaking, flat and dead and empty, “Midoriya Izuku just left the hospital. Find him.”

 

“Oh?” Nedzu starts, a sick curiosity in his voice. “You don’t think he’s following the tracker?”

 

“I don’t know,” Shouta says, even though he means no. If Izuku were doing that he wouldn’t need to go alone, because heroes are heading in that direction anyway. But Shouta has no idea where else he’d go. “Just find him.”

 

“Even for me, that’s a tall order,” Nedzu admits. “Midoriya-kun is both intelligent and fast enough to elude nearly anyone, and that list, unfortunately, includes me. Would you like me to list the reasons why my chance of finding him is approximately seven-point-four percent?”

 

“I don’t care. Find him. You should’ve heard him...” Shouta grips the windowsill so hard one of his nails breaks. “He was saying goodbye, Nedzu.”

 

“Well, that is concerning.”

 

“No shit.” And then Shouta hangs up.

 

He turns to the nurse, who’s still standing with wide eyes in the doorway. “Last checked, how was his condition?”

 

She swallows, wipes sweat off her forehead and says, “Practically perfect. He has no injuries, just a fever.”

 

“A fever?”

 

“Yeah, considering his healing quirk it’s a little unusual, but we expect it's due to overextension of his quirk...s.”

 

That’s a tad concerning, but not Shouta’s priority. Yes. First, he has to find Izuku. And he expects the problem child’s friends might have the answer, so he hightails it to the prime suspects: Todoroki, Iida, and Uraraka. For a minute, he’s utterly terrified that they’re gone, too, but he finally finds them all in Todoroki’s room, alongside Yaoyorozu.

 

Shouta scans the room, then makes eye contact with two of them in turn. “Iida, Uraraka, step out with me for a moment.”

 

“Is something wrong, Aizawa-sensei?” Iida asks, but he still stands up without hesitation.

 

Shouta simply says, “Come with me.”

 

Iida exchanges glances with the other students, but at Uraraka’s smile, they both join him in the hall. Shouta closes the door behind him.

 

“What is it?” Uraraka asks. Although she’s smiling, it betrays her concern.

 

“I trust you both to do the right thing,” Shouta says. After a quick deliberation, he places a hand on each of their shoulders and looks closely at their faces, searching for any sort of tell. “Where is Midoriya Izuku?”

 

Iida’s eyes widen. Uraraka’s brows scrunch up, and tears form near-instantaneously in her eyes. “Huh?” she asks, quietly.

 

“He’s missing?” Iida asks. He tries to keep any emotion out of his voice, but fails, and it bleeds through into every syllable.

 

“If you know where he is, tell me. All I want is to help.”

 

Uraraka shakes her head incessantly.

 

“No, I,” Iida starts. “If I knew I’d tell you. Of course. But I don’t. I—”

 

Shouta looks into Iida’s eyes for an extra second before he’s convinced. He believes them. “Okay,” he says, “stay out here for a minute.”

 

Shouta walks back into the room and directly up to Todoroki, who’s sitting on the hospital bed. His leg’s in a cast, and there’s some minor visible bruising, but the expression on his face is the same as always. In theory, he’s nearly back to prime health.

 

Shouta looks into his eyes, tries to get a hint of anything, but the boy is utterly unreadable. After Recovery Girl healed him as much as she could, the hospital had him on painkillers, but at Todoroki’s insistence he’s been off them for a few hours. And yet there’s no indication of any pain on his face or in his body language, despite the fact that it must be there.

 

Shouta has to be more careful with this one. Todoroki does not trust him, so Shouta doesn’t trust Todoroki in this moment. If Todoroki knows where Izuku is, there’s a strong chance he won’t tell Shouta.

 

“Todoroki...” Shouta starts. “All I want is the best for you all. I’m your teacher, but it’s more than that. Each and every one of you are my problem children, and I’ll do whatever it takes to keep you all safe. Do you understand?”

 

Todoroki just frowns and narrows his eyebrows, which is honestly more of a reaction than Shouta was expecting, but he still isn’t quite sure what it means.

 

“I want to help Midoriya, but I need your help to do that.”

 

Todoroki’s eyes widen, just a hair.

 

Shouta debates sitting on the bed, but he decides against it. “Todoroki.” He tries to keep his voice calm and soft. Without any accusation. With nothing but curious compassion. “Where is Midoriya?”

 

It is only his decades of real-world, battle-honed instincts that allow Shouta to simultaneously Erase Todoroki’s quirk and throw himself in front of Yaoyorozu quick enough to block the shards of ice. Despite canceling the quirk near-instantaneously, Todoroki’s ice has already covered the entire room: floor, walls, and even the ceiling. And yet simultaneously the blanket on top of Todoroki burned up into a pile of ashes.

 

Todoroki’s jaw is clenched and his eyes are wide and he looks absolutely horrified.

 

He doesn’t know.

 

Shouta is confident Todoroki has no idea where Izuku is.

 

- - -

 

Shouto doesn’t know.

 

His two first friends. His two only friends. His two best friends.

 

Both gone.

 

And he doesn’t know where either of them are.

 

Shouto’s never felt like this before, not since... not since Endeavor took his mother away.

 

Aizawa is talking to Yaoyorozu, telling her that he has to go somewhere, that there are other heroes on this hospital floor to protect them, that they’re safe here.

 

Safe? Safe? What’s the point of safety if he’s all alone? If his two best friends in the entire world are not safe? 

 

All he can hear is the blood pumping past his eardrums like a metronome. The sound of Hitoshi turning into a marble, like a pop. Hitoshi’s last words to him, right beforehand: thanks for the ride, hotstuff. Izuku yelling, take me instead! Fire sparking. Ice creaking. Silence.

 

This can’t be happening.

 

It doesn’t feel real.

 

It feels like the most real thing that’s ever happened.

 

Shinsou Hitoshi is gone.

 

Midoriya Izuku is gone.

 

Todoroki Shouto is all alone.

 

Again.

 

 

At some point Aizawa tries talking to him, but Shouto isn’t listening, so he finally leaves the room. But then a hand lands on Shouto’s shoulder and he smacks it away instinctively.

 

Uraraka stands next to the bed, and although she looks a little sad, she isn’t hurt at all, so that’s good. He should say sorry , but he’s afraid if he opens his mouth he’ll throw up.

 

Uraraka just bites her lip and steps back a few feet.

 

Aizawa’s left, but the other three are still here. No one says anything for at least a minute until Yaoyorozu starts, “As vice-representative, protecting this class is part of my responsibility…” She pulls something out of her pocket—a small electrical device with a screen. “I put a tracker on one of the nomus. While I can’t promise that Midoriya or Shinsou will be there, it’s possible.”

 

Shouto throws himself to his feet so fast he nearly falls over. When Uraraka reaches out to either help him up or insist he stays seated, his glare freezes her in place.

 

“I’m going.” He doesn’t say anything else, but they all know he means with or without you.

 

“Your leg—” Uraraka exclaims.

 

“I’m fine,” Shouto says. It’s the truth. He’s fine enough to do what he has to. He’s fine enough to do whatever it takes.

 

“I don’t think this is a good idea,” Iida says, reluctantly. He’s looking down, and it lacks his usual self-righteous confidence. “We should let the heroes take care of this.”

 

Shouto doesn’t care. He looks Yaoyorozu straight in the eyes. He doesn’t say anything. He doesn’t have to.

 

She nods, once, and picks up her bag. “I’m ready.”

 

Uraraka lets out a long sigh, then smiles. “If you guys are going, then so am I.”

 

She looks at Iida, who frowns.

 

When he doesn’t say anything, Shouto starts walking towards the door. Right as he’s about to open it, Iida interjects, “Wait! If we’re going to do this, we need a plan.”

 

Shouto turns back around. He’s willing to wait for a plan, as long as it doesn’t take too long.

 

After a moment, Iida continues, “Yaoyorozu-san, where is the location of the tracker?”

 

“It’s still on the move, and it isn’t heading in a straight line so it’s hard to predict the destination.”

 

“I’d like to propose, then, that we use the time before it stabilizes to come up with a plan that minimizes our risk.”

 

“Oh!” Uraraka exclaims, and she actually looks a little happy. “We could call Saza!”

 

“Who is this Saza-san?” Yaoyorozu asks.

 

“She was in our arena for the physical part of the entrance exam! She’s in the management school, now. But she has this really cool quirk that lets her measure the probabilities for a bad outcome versus a good outcome–the risk versus the reward! I’ll call her up right now.”

 

Uraraka doesn’t hesitate to grab her phone, dial the number and put it on speaker. For half a minute, all that echoes across the still frozen walls is the hollow ringing, but then someone picks up: “Ah, Uraraka-san, I’ve been waiting for you to call.”

 

“Really?!” Uraraka exclaims.

 

“No, not really. What can I help you with?”

 

“Well, there’s this rescue operation...”

 

- - -

 

There is a knock on the front door, and Tomura hesitates instead of decaying the hero brat, Shinsou. No one should be knocking. Every party member and tool he has is either in this room, at the nomu warehouse, or named Giran. And while Giran might knock, there’s no chance he’d come to the bar when he knows that shit’s going down.

 

But Toga cheerfully invites, “Come in!”

 

There is a moment of complete silence. Tomura’s four fingers dig a little harder into the NPC’s arm, but he doesn't yet activate his quirk.

 

And then the door opens.

 

And Midoriya Izuku steps into the bar.

 

He’s alone, wearing the hero costume Tomura hasn’t seen since USJ a couple months ago: a dark green-black suit that practically shines in the bar lighting. Midoriya stands with a straight back and the confidence of someone who is absolutely assured that they are the strongest person in the room. This, plus the dangerous look in his red eyes, makes Midoriya look five or so years older than he really is.

 

And despite being the second-smallest person in the room (the only person beating him in that regard is Toga, of course), Midoriya instantaneously commands everyone’s undying attention. At his entrance, no one makes a sound, no one moves. They can’t. Because Midoriya’s confidence is not uncalled for. Because each and every one of them, even those who have never met him before, wholeheartedly agree:

 

Midoriya Izuku is the most powerful person in the room.

 

A room of capable, unstable villains simply watch, hypnotized, as Midoriya carefully shuts the door behind him and then turns back to say, “Hello, everybody. If we haven’t met yet, I’m Midoriya Izuku, also known as Peacekeeper.”

 

He places a hand on his chest and gives a short bow before turning to make eye contact with Tomura. “Tomura-senpai, could we have a quick chat, please?”

 

Something primal activates inside Tomura. It’s almost like Sensei walked into the room. Every fiber of his being is insisting he do whatever Midoriya asks of him.

 

But stronger than that is Tomura’s burning desire to destroy, to fight, to kill, to decay.

 

And while that look in Midoriya’s eyes may be frightening, Tomura is sure it’s nothing compared to what Moonfish saw, and that’s so offensive it overwrites any fear Tomura had been feeling.

 

“Nah,” Tomura growls. He can’t move yet, his body still frozen in an attempt to protect itself, but he can smirk, at least. “I was just telling your little friend… I’m not playing that game anymore.” 

 

It’s starting to wear off, enough for Tomura’s pinky to twitch. That’s all he needs: a fifth finger to make Midoriya take him seriously. And then it twitches again, and Tomura finally drops the last finger onto Shinsou’s shoulder, but—

 

Some telepathic force drags Tomura’s hand away before he can decay anything other than fabric. He thrusts his other hand towards the purple brat, but Tomura’s entire body is tugged towards Midoriya and off the stool.

 

Fine.

 

Alright then.

 

If Midoriya insists.

 

Tomura sprints at Midoriya, who hasn’t moved from his spot in front of the door.

 

Behind him, Tomura senses movement. The kidnapped brat? No; his party members. He must’ve snapped them out of their frightened condition, because they all seem to be powering back up.

 

“Stay back!” Tomura yells. He spares a single second to glare at them. “He’s mine!” And Tomura continues charging.

 

Without turning around, Midoriya re-opens the door. Just in time for Tomura to throw them both through it and out of the bar.

 

- - -

 

“Where?” Shouta asks Tsukauchi through the phone. He’s spent the past half-hour scouting the area around the hospital in a widening spiral, failing to find any clues about where Midoriya might have gone. But then Nedzu “accidentally” let slip that the tracker had finally settled down, with a text to the “wrong number”. Nedzu refused to give up the location, so Shouta’s turned to the next best option.

 

Tsukauchi says, “You’re supposed to be in the hospital. Resting.”

 

“Where’s the tracker,” Shouta deadpans, not trying to hide the annoyance in his voice.

 

Tsukauchi sighs. “We can take care of this, Aizawa. We have practically every hero in the vicinity mobilized. We’ll—”

 

“Midoriya is missing,” Shouta interrupts, and there’s a desperate anger that has been building in his stomach that finally crawls out of his throat. “So if there’s any chance that my problem child is there, I’m going. Tell. Me. Where.”

 

After a moment, Tsukauchi reluctantly starts, “I don’t... we’ve received intelligence that The League has two bases. We have the address for one, via the tracker, but we’re failing to find the other. We’re sending a majority of our forces to the warehouse, but we’re keeping a small reserve—All Might and a few others—in case the other location surfaces.”

 

Shit.

 

Another location.

 

Knowing Midoriya, he’s much more likely at the unknown base, but Shouta has to do something, so he repeats, “Tell me where.”

 

Tsukauchi does. He starts to say something else after, but Shouta hangs up the phone and starts sprinting towards the Kamino ward.

 

- - -

 

Tomura and Midoriya fight. Finally. Except...

 

It lacks... something.

 

Despite the red in Midoriya’s eyes, he’s missing that ruthlessness that so captivated Tomura in his fight with Moonfish.

 

Midoriya fights, and he’s good—good enough that they’re sixty seconds in and Tomura still hasn’t gotten five fingers on him—but he isn’t great. Midoriya blocks most of Tomura’s blows and avoids the rest, but he hasn’t even taken out those weird whips, so Tomura knows: Midoriya isn’t taking him seriously.

 

It’s like he’s just going through the motions.

 

It’s like he isn’t even looking at Tomura.

 

It’s infuriating. How dare he?

 

 

How dare he?

 

- - -

 

Two minutes into the fight, Shigaraki suddenly screams and punches a building instead of Izuku. The entire thing, all three stories, crumbles to rubble after a few seconds, and Shigaraki screams at it again before spinning around and glaring. “How dare you?” he growls. He scratches deep into his neck. “Stop holding back and come at me like you did Moonfish! Don’t you dare tell me you hate that NPC more than me!”

 

How does Shigaraki know about Moonfish? Why would Shigaraki want Izuku to try and kill him?

 

These are probably incredibly important questions, but Izuku’s mind is distracted. By Shinsou Hitoshi. By his father (who can’t be missing. He just can’t). By this fever that threatens to burn him from the inside. By the dark red flurry that surrounds Shigaraki Tomura.

 

So Izuku tells the truth: “Well, you didn’t hurt Hitoshi.”

 

Shigaraki screams, again, and it probably should sound threatening but it just sounds like a toddler throwing a tantrum. “And whose fault is that? I was going to! I will right now if that’ll help!” Shigaraki turns towards the bar for a moment, but seems to think better of it, because he takes a step towards Izuku instead. “Fuck you! I ruined your little training camp, doesn’t that count for something?”

 

Oh.

 

He’s right.

 

That does count for something, because Izuku defied his father to go to that training camp. Because that was perhaps the last opportunity he’ll ever have to be a part of 1-A. Izuku wanted to hang out with his friends, to fulfill his promise, and he threw his future away for that. Father won’t let him go back. Izuku’s broken too many rules. He’s gotten too many second chances already. He accepted that when he decided to dig his way out of the basement. He accepted that when he dragged himself to the training camp.

 

But instead of looking at the stars with his friends, Izuku is fighting Shigaraki Tomura.

 

This isn’t how he wanted to go out. This isn’t how he wanted to say goodbye.

 

Shigaraki continues, a little quieter, just a tad more reserved, “You can feel it, can’t you? I think the rising action went by a little fast, but... doesn’t this feel like the point of no return?”

 

Izuku expects Shigaraki is saying something else, but he’s right.

 

Izuku can never return to UA.

 

Even if he survives this, Izuku will never get to try that coffee shop Hitoshi and Shouto love. He’ll never get to take the physical part of the final exams. He’ll never get to help Ochako study again. He’ll never get to finish Aizawa’s new costume. He’ll never get to know Yaoyorozu better. He’ll never get to help Tenya and his older brother.

 

Even if Izuku survives Shigaraki Tomura, his life as he knows it will be over.

 

Which means this is his last act as Peacekeeper, as a hero student, as a member of 1-A.

 

Which means he has to make it count.

 

Which means only one thing matters: helping as many people as he can.

 

Shigaraki yells, “So just fucking kill me already!”

 

- - -

 

Midoriya’s head tilts back, and he looks up at the sky in silence. There is something somber about it, and if this were a cutscene from a video game, no doubt the animators would have made a few droplets of rain fall down onto his face. But this is not a cutscene from a video game, and the sky is clear, and Midoriya’s face remains completely unobstructed from Tomura’s view. He looks calm, body perfectly still, standing there in his suit and his red shoes.

 

Midoriya looks like a villain.

 

There is something about the sharpness of his jaw, the dark light in his eyes, the way his hands lie relaxed at his side like he doesn’t even need them to take you down.

 

He looks, almost, sort of, maybe, blasphemously, like Sensei—in his prime, before the accident. 

 

Midoriya keeps his head tilted up towards the sky, but he brings his eyes down to stare at Tomura with a chilling look.

 

And then Midoriya says, “Okay. Sure.”

 

And those tentacle-whips finally fly at Tomura.

 

- - -

 

Izuku lies. It is hard to keep track of them sometimes. Sometimes he isn’t even sure when he’s lying. But this one he holds close to his chest, in front of him like a shield.

 

Izuku is not going to kill Shigaraki Tomura. He is going to do everything in his power except that. He is going to do the opposite.

 

Midoriya Izuku is a hero. Midoriya Izuku is Peacekeeper. At least for today. At least for right now. And so he’s going to save as many people as he can.

 

That includes Shigaraki Tomura.

 

Izuku holds this up like armor as he dives head-first into Shigaraki Tomura’s bloodlust.

 

It’s the second time he’s accepted the emotion willingly, though his experience with Moonfish was different—there, he let it take him. This time, Izuku will be the one in control. He knows he can’t escape it, so he embraces it. He remembers how it felt when Hitoshi ordered him to take control of the emotions. It wasn’t like a wall; it wasn’t a separation, but the opposite. So Izuku swims.

 

And as Izuku swims through the dark-red, breathes it in, there is one belief he holds tight—one thought that he will never let go of.

 

Midoriya Izuku wholeheartedly believes that Tomura is not murder all the way down.

 

Izuku accepts the bloodlust because he believes there is something deeper, something past it, and if he can just find that...

 

For a minute, or maybe two—Izuku can’t really tell because his brain is too hot and his body is moving to a tune that is not his own—Izuku lives in Tomura’s bloodlust, and he searches. He thinks the two of them are fighting, too, but his body can take care of that. Meanwhile, Izuku’s mind searches, fights through the red, and finally finds it.

 

There are nothing but speckles, at first, of varying colors. The dark red brightens to an anger, peppered like a sunset with yellow and orange. Anxiety. Izuku isn’t sure who Sensei is, but he can taste Tomura’s desperation to make the man proud. Just like—

 

And what’s Father going to say when they see each other next? After everything Izuku’s done, will he ever forgive him? He’s sure to—

 

But Izuku doesn’t stop, he keeps pushing forward, and even deeper is a bright yellow. Pure fear. And there is so much of it. Izuku can’t dissect it all, there’s too much. Tomura’s afraid of being alone. He’s afraid of being abandoned. He’s afraid of being out of control. He’s afraid of being weak. He’s afraid of—

 

Izuku keeps going. The fear is deep and strong and powerful and despite the way it claws at Izuku’s skin, tries to scare him away, Izuku doesn’t stop. He knows that there is more. This fear is just hiding something else, something that Tomura is afraid of feeling ever again.

 

- - -

 

The fight is a blurred flurry. Tomura’s body keeps up automatically, but his brain is always a couple seconds behind.

 

Midoriya has so many different tricks up his sleeve it’s hard for Tomura to keep track, but he’s always been good at identifying a boss’ attack pattern. It’ll take time, but he’ll get used to it and find the opening. There’s always an opening.

 

And then Tomura finds it. Finally . Midoriya cannot quite control those weird whips, and Tomura manages to get around them, to get close, to get four fingers around Midoriya’s throat and to shove the boy to the ground.

 

But—

 

Midoriya looks up at him with a softness Tomura’s never seen before, let alone when Tomura has four fingers around his throat. Midoriya does not fight back. In fact, his whole body relaxes, and he lays there like it’s his own bed. Midoriya looks up at Tomura and offers a small smile. “I trust you,” Izuku says, and despite everything, Tomura believes him.

 

- - -

 

Past the black and the red and the yellow, past the bloodlust and the anger and the fear, deep down in Tomura’s heart, there is a little boy. He has messy black hair and a smile that makes Izuku want to cry and he’s standing in the middle of a field. Tall, green grass that flows alongside a non-existent breeze. The boy is smiling at a pink flower—the only one here. The only one left.

 

When he notices Izuku, he looks over, laughs and waves. He’s far away, but Izuku can almost hear him saying: This is so much fun! I haven’t had this much fun in ages! I wanna keep playing with Izuku forever!

 

Izuku reaches out a hand, over the green field of hope and towards the pink flower. The last standing pink flower:

 

Compassion.

 

Izuku grabs onto it—the little boy, the hope, the compassion—and he breathes it in.

 

And he breathes it out, fans the flames of that hope as hard as he can.

 

Izuku isn’t sure how he’s doing it—he isn’t even sure exactly what he’s doing—but he tries to convey the single most important message in the world to Shigaraki Tomura using every cell of his being, every quirk he has:

 

You are allowed to hope.

 

And that hope—a soft green, like grass—reverberates between them, back and forth, thumping like a metronome that gets faster and faster.

 

You are allowed to hope.

 

Izuku meant it for Tomura, but he needed to hear it just as much.

 

You are allowed to hope.

 

And Izuku means it—god, does he mean it.

 

He hopes that after this fight is over, after Hitoshi is safe, Izuku will get to go back to UA. It’s unlikely, nigh impossible, but that hope is the only thing getting him through this hour, this minute, this second.

 

Izuku has to have hope that he will see his friends again, because otherwise he might as well die.

 

He has to have hope for the little boy inside Shigaraki Tomura.

 

He has to have hope that Shigaraki Tomura will have hope.

 

So he says, “I trust you.”

 

- - -

 

Tomura throws himself backwards, skids as far as he can go until he hits a wall. His hands are shaking; his whole body is shaking. He feels something he hasn’t felt in over a decade—it makes him feel sick. He might throw up.

 

“What did you do to me?” he bites out.

 

This feeling is a poison. It’s dangerous. It’s threatening to open the door and let other things in. There’s a reason he hasn’t let himself feel this. It’s addictive. It’s a false promise. It’s something Tomura isn’t allowed to have.

 

Midoriya doesn’t even stand up to say, “I trusted you, and I still do.”

 

“How—how dare you?” Tomura hisses.

 

Midoriya stands up, then slowly starts walking towards him. Tomura’s back is still against the wall. Perhaps he could decay it, or run to either side, but his body won’t move.

 

Midoriya walks towards him with absolutely no malice, with nothing but kindness, and it’s the most terrifying thing Tomura’s ever seen. Tomura wants to argue against it, wants to convince himself that it’s all a lie, because that’s what kindness has always been for him. Because anytime Sensei smiles, it’s to cover up something that will hurt him.

 

He’s never believed kindness before but Tomura knows, with perfect clarity, that Midoriya Izuku is the walking embodiment of it. The grass is soft, and the flowers are pink, and Tomura finally understands what the word compassion means. It’s a word Tomura thought he’d never understand, that he’d never actually use, and the fact that it’s staring him right in the face terrifies him more than anything else in the world.

 

He might throw up. Worse than that, he might cry.

 

He’s afraid of feeling this, of believing it, because he knows that it never sticks. Shigaraki Tomura isn’t allowed to have nice things. Tomura isn’t allowed to feel this way.

 

Tomura tries to bury it, but he won’t realize until it’s too late that seeds need to be buried to grow.

 

“Stay away from me,” Tomura hisses as Midoriya approaches.

 

The boy slows, but doesn’t stop, and Tomura can’t look away. Those eyes are, somehow, so much more terrifying when they’re green instead of red.

 

Mainly because they look somewhat familiar.

 

And then Midoriya stops. And he is right in front of him. And there is no red fog between them, no field. There is nothing.

 

Except a memory. A familiarity. Something sinks through Tomura’s throat like a rock and stops at his heart. He doesn’t know what it is—he can’t see it yet, but he can taste it—and so he asks, “What game are we playing?” But what he means is:

 

What do you see when you look in the mirror? Is it the same thing I do?

 

Did I skip the prologue? I no longer know when this game started. I think it started a long time ago. I think we started a long time ago.

 

Do you feel the same, Izuku?

 

Midoriya reaches out a hand and Tomura flinches back, though he has nowhere to go. He’s scared. The last time someone touched him outside of a fight it was Sensei taking his quirk. It hurt. It always hurts. The only time anyone ever touches him, it hurts.

 

Except Izuku’s hand stops less than an inch away from Tomura’s cheek. It hovers there, and, despite the distance, it’s still surprisingly warm.

 

- - -

 

There is something in Tomura’s eyes that looks like Izuku’s responsibility. 

 

So Izuku says, “You are allowed to hope.” Because he is not cruel enough to say:

 

I am sorry someone convinced you that you are a weapon. I am sorry someone took advantage of you.

 

I am sorry no one ever told you that you didn’t have to be a villain.

 

I am sorry those who played with you were not gentle. I am sorry no one ever trusted you.

 

I can save you, too.

 

Izuku reaches out, slowly, for a hug but then

 

 

 

the space between them fills with a black liquid that shoves its way down both their throats and then

 

 

 

they’re falling.

 

- - -

 

Tomura throws up the black liquid and finds himself on asphalt. He just barely recognizes this place: the nomu warehouse in Kamino. Except it’s been utterly destroyed. There are bodies of heroes strewn about, some unconscious, some dead. Further out along the outskirts, there are a couple still conscious, including a few he recognizes from USJ and his files on UA, like Eraserhead.

 

The rest of The League has been transported beside him. And across the ruins, Tomura finds Midoriya with four of his hero friends, plus, for some stupid reason, the Shinsou brat.

 

Even though they were right next to each other a second ago, Tomura and Izuku are on opposite sides again.

 

And the only thing between them is Sensei, hovering in the air like a nuclear bomb.

Chapter Text

The first person to realize is not Midoriya Izuku, nor Shigaraki Tomura, nor All Might.

 

Of all people, the first to the epiphany is Shinsou Hitoshi, because he recognizes the villain hovering a dozen feet in the air, in the middle of a recently-leveled city block. The dust is still settling and all Hitoshi can smell is iron—like lightning, or blood, or both at the same time.

 

This is the solved puzzle, the final image, the connected dots.

 

Because Hitoshi recognizes Midoriya Hisashi, Izuku’s father.

 

Midoriya Hisashi, Izuku’s father, radiating the danger of a hurricane.

 

Midoriya Hisashi, Izuku’s father, a villain.

 

Midoriya Hisashi, Izuku’s father, Shigaraki’s Sensei.

 

Midoriya Hisashi, Izuku’s father, and the man behind The League of Villains.

 

Everything makes sense now. This is the epiphany.

 

Unfortunately.

 

Hitoshi’s legs give out and he crumples. He knows it’s coming—the thin connection between his brain and his body finally snaps—but he can’t stop it. All the trauma (plus, you know, the concussion) finally catches up to him. He drops, but someone catches him—a strong hand under his armpit—and when he sees Shouto standing there, tears well up in his eyes.

 

He wasn’t sure they’d see each other again, so in his exhausted relief he wants to say something witty like marry me, but he can’t get any words out. A heavy pressure suffocates him—the pressure of a man Hitoshi instinctively recognizes as the most powerful villain in all of Japan—Midoriya Izuku’s father.

 

- - -

 

The second person to the epiphany is Todoroki Shouto, who requires only one look at the faces of his two best friends to recognize the terror there and what it means.

 

He isn’t sure how Izuku and Hitoshi even got there, but he doesn’t care. One second, Shouto was cowering with his classmates behind a wall. The next second, that wall was a pile of rubble, and now Izuku and Hitoshi are here.

 

Izuku doesn’t say anything, but he doesn’t have to. He silently mouths a word Shouto would recognize anywhere: father. And Shouto knows. His reaction is just as strong as Hitoshi’s but in the opposite direction. All Shouto feels is anger. Pure, righteous anger.

 

This is the man who hurt Izuku. The man who lies, who manipulates, who uses.

 

And it shouldn’t be possible to get any worse than that, but somehow even worse—this man is a villain.

 

If his anger wasn’t being effectively smothered by an even stronger terror, Shouto would have already attacked the bastard. But Shouto can barely move enough to catch Hitoshi before he falls. His body is stuck in survival mode, frozen. It knows, innately, without any centimeter of doubt:

 

Shouto does not stand a chance against this man.

 

Not a single one of them do.

 

Except...

 

He doesn’t want to think about it, but—

 

Not a single one of them do—except, perhaps, Midoriya Izuku.

 

- - -

 

The third to this understanding is Aizawa Shouta, who, fifteen seconds prior, witnessed the arrival of the leader of The League of Villains. Shouta arrived late, because he wasn’t formally invited, so he was far enough away that he was only knocked off his feet, rather than completely unconscious. And despite seeing clearly the single attack that wiped out all the top heroes in the vicinity, Shouta could not describe how the man did it. A bright light—yet dark—pure power, pure output. Something undefinable. Something powerful. Something dangerous. Something nearly omnipotent.

 

Despite the blood-curdling terror that freezes Shouta down to his bones, the first thing he does is scan the surroundings for his kids. There’s no reason for them to be there, but Shouta is not as driven by reason as he always claims, and he finds them—Todoroki, Iida, Uraraka, Yaoyorozu, thank god Shinsou and Midoriya—a couple dozen yards away, taking ineffective cover behind a collapsed wall. So he’s watching clearly as Izuku takes a step forward.

 

Forward, toward the leader of The League. Forward, despite Iida trying to hold him back. Forward, despite the suffocating pressure in the air, despite the incontestable fact that this man is the most dangerous villain Shouta’s ever seen.

 

Despite this, Izuku takes a step forward and says, in a quiet voice that still projects across the ruins, “Father?”

 

And it all makes sense.

 

Here he is. Finally.

 

The mystery man.

 

Izuku’s father.

 

The leader of The League of Villains.

 

Because of course he is.

 

It all makes terrible, nauseating sense that curdles in the bottom of Shouta’s stomach.

 

- - -

 

And the fourth to realize is Shigaraki Tomura, who is dragged into understanding despite how hard he clings to his last thread of denial. Those two syllables Midoriya said—that single word—Tomura wants to throw them up. It doesn’t make sense. It’s impossible. It goes against everything he’s ever believed. It threatens—no. It isn’t true.

 

It can’t be true because Sensei saved him. Sensei gave him purpose. Sensei gave him a life and Tomura’s devoted it to him. Everything Tomura’s ever done has been for Sensei. Because he always thought—because he knows that he’s important to Sensei. Sensei loves him, more than anything else in the world, that’s what he always says, but if Midoriya—

 

Tomura refuses to know. Not this. Not like this. It doesn’t make sense. He doesn’t want to know but he doesn’t have a choice when Sensei looks down at Midoriya Izuku and says, in a familiar tone, conversational, the same one that Sensei uses when he’s talking to Tomura, “Ah, there you are, Izuku—” Izuku?  “—I’ve been worried about you.”

 

Izuku???

 

And Tomura doesn’t have a choice when Izuku replies, in the same exact tone, like Sensei isn’t Sensei, isn’t All for One, isn’t the leader of The League, “You shouldn’t be away from your medical equipment, Father. Let’s go home.”

 

Home?

 

Home???

 

They have a home? Where is it? What does it look like? It doesn’t make sense. No, Tomura doesn’t want to know.

 

“Oh, Izuku,” Sensei continues, though this time he sounds a little sad, in that condescending way that tells you he isn’t sad at all, “No one told you? People were poking around in our business; I didn’t want to spoil the surprise, so I had to clean it up. That place doesn’t exist anymore. You understand, don’t you, Izuku?”

 

This tone—this dialogue—Tomura’s heard it countless times. And yet. And yet it’s only ever been for him. Sensei doesn’t talk to anyone else like this. He isn’t supposed to talk to other people like this. He’s only ever been this soft with Tomura. He’s only allowed to be this soft with Tomura.

 

And Midoriya called him—father—no. No, Tomura doesn’t believe it.

 

It must be one of Sensei’s ploys or—maybe—one of Midoriya’s. This is just a trick. A ruse. A cutscene that won’t have any actual influence on the plot of the game. This isn’t real. It doesn’t make sense. It isn’t real.

 

 

Except it is.

 

There’s a small voice in the back of his head that’s always been there, and it’s getting louder. Realization scratches at the surface with sharp nails.

 

Tomura can see it now. He’d seen it before, but now it’s something impossible to unsee. He doesn’t have a choice.

 

Midoriya’s always reminded him of Sensei. In small ways. In big ways. The same “fashion” sense. Same taste in tea. Same charisma. Same power. Same—

 

NO.

 

No no no because that would mean—because that means Sensei lied to him. This whole time. For years. For ever.

 

Sensei isn’t—it can’t be like that, it can’t, but—

 

What was Sensei really doing when he wasn’t at the bar or on the monitor or in the hospital? Was he at some suburban four bedroom house with a white picket fence and a dog and a wife and Midoriya Izuku, sitting around some dining room table blowing out candles on a birthday cake? Was Sensei patting Izuku on the head? Giving him hugs? Was Sensei folding his laundry for him? Was Sensei buying him birthday presents that weren’t knives or nomus—was Sensei praising him without any sort of poison underneath—was Sensei loving him? Because Tomura never got any of that. Not for real. Not for him.

 

Tomura got Sensei’s time, only sometimes, just a couple hours a week. He got a Playstation. A new couch. But none of it—it wasn’t the same. It wasn’t a home.

 

But none of that mattered to him before because Tomura is special. Because Tomura hasn’t needed any of that shit to know he’s important to Sensei. Because Tomura has always thought Sensei was doing as much as he could to show it but—but if Midoriya has been getting a home this whole time and all Tomura gets is a phone call once a week and a dingy bar—

 

What does that make Tomura?

 

What does that make Tomura to Sensei?

 

What does that make Sensei to Tomura?

 

He can’t take this. He didn’t want to know. He wants to go back. When was the last checkpoint? Can’t they just go back to that? It doesn’t make sense. This isn’t real. He wants to dig it out of his skin. He’s all Sensei’s ever needed. He’s Sensei’s successor. He can’t take this anymore. His whole body itches. His heart is trying to claw its way out of his chest. His stomach is pure acid. He can’t take this anymore so he closes his eyes and screams and yells, howls, wails, as loud as he can, loud enough to drown out his own thoughts, thoughts he never wanted in the first place. He pulls tugs yanks at his hair something needs to get out there’s something wrong it’s inside him he’s wrong everything is wrong no no nonononoNONONO NO

 

SHUT UP!!!

 

- - -

 

Tied for fifth are Todoroki Touya and Toga Himiko, as they were both unlucky enough to be warped directly next to Shigaraki Tomura, and now have front row seats to him screeching “shut up!” at the top of his lungs, so loud and long that his voice cracks into a high pitch.

 

Shigaraki then grabs his head with both his hands, digs his nails into his scalp and tugs at his hair. “Shut up!”

 

They’ve all heard Shigaraki angry before—it’s practically his default state—but this time it’s different. Because this time, the anger is just hiding a terror they can clearly see on his face. The anger is hiding a broken boy, blinking back tears, gnawing on his lips, throwing a tantrum.

 

Shigaraki looks like he’s fourteen years old. He looks exactly like Touya did when he broke, when he abandoned the Todoroki name and ran away to become the thing he is today.

 

Shigaraki looks like Himiko’s first crush. She’s always liked him, ever since they first met, but she’s now realizing he’s even cooler than her first impression.

 

She’s always thought Shigaraki was adorably authentic—it’s one of her favorite things about him—but she feels like she’s seeing the real him for the first time. The Shigaraki they’ve seen up to this point has only been the surface level—a deep surface level, to be fair, but still mostly a facade.

 

Himiko usually doesn’t fall into the trap of falling in love with an ideal, but truthfully, she’s never really seen Shigaraki as human. He’s been anger and violence incarnate, but nothing more than that. He’s always been a bit flat.

 

But this? Oh, Himiko may have liked him before, but in the same way one has a crush on their favorite anime character. She liked the idea of him more than she actually liked him. But now?

 

Oh, now?

 

Himiko finally sees the human Tomura, who’s more than just anger and impulse and death and video game references and decay and potato chips and murder. He is, undoubtedly, still all of these things, he’s just also so much more.

 

That face he wears to hide the truth is pretty hot, but the truth is even hotter.

 

Because Tomura is Himiko’s type: scared, broken, traumatized, dangerous, gorgeous.

 

He’s gorgeous.

 

Himiko looks at Tomura’s face—tears fighting to stay in his eyes—and she smiles something wide, something that would undoubtedly disturb anyone who took a single look at her. Because that broken expression on Tomura’s face is the sexiest thing Himiko’s ever seen in her whole life. If she weren’t frozen in terror by the old villain man floating ominously a few yards away, she’d try to kiss him.

 

Tomura looks so human and it makes her want to whine: you’re beautiful.

 

But she doesn’t want to die, nor ruin the moment, so she holds herself back and instead silently watches as Tomura falls apart.

 

- - -

 

The seventh person to the epiphany is

 

not Midoriya Izuku. Because Izuku refuses to know.

 

He has spent his whole life in denial, and he refuses to give up now. Stopping here would be impossible. Stopping here would mean that everything up to this point has been for nothing.

 

Anytime a semblance of realization scratches at the surface, Izuku forces it down, just as he always has. It hurts. It burns. But he’s been doing this forever, so he can do it for another hour, another day, another year. He doesn’t have a choice. It can’t be true. This can’t be true. Izuku’s father is—

 

Izuku’s father is looking down at Shigaraki Tomura and apologizing, just as he has to Izuku all his life. “I’m sorry, my boy. I’m sure this must be very confusing, but I had to move the timeline forward a little before either of you spoiled the surprise. In just a moment—”

 

All Might appears.

 

A flurry of strength and smiles and bright colors, like a meteor.

 

All Might appears and it should be a relief, but instead Izuku’s heart drops.

 

Because All Might appears and he’s throwing an Oklahoma Smash directly at Izuku’s father.

 

Before he’s conscious of it, Izuku yells, “Wait!” and All Might freezes, an inch before landing the punch. Despite the wide smile on the hero’s face, his confusion is clear as day.

 

And Father says, “Hello, Yagi-kun. It’s been a while, hasn’t it? Though not as long as you’d expected, I’m sure.”

 

- - -

 

The seventh person to the epiphany is Yagi Toshinori. Because Toshinori knows, down to his very bones, primally, that the man in front of him is All for One. He can taste it in the air; it smells just like it did ten years ago, during the “Toxic Chainsaw” fight, where he supposedly defeated All for One.

 

That familiarity is two-fold, because All for One also smells like bleach—like the Midoriya household—and even with the helmet over the top half of his head, Toshinori cannot deny the identity of the man in front of him. The man who is All for One. The man who is Midoriya Hisashi.

 

Toshinori should panic. He should be feeling something. But there’s nothing, just a hollow emptiness. Disappointment, perhaps. Numbness.

 

He’d seen the signs. Izuku’s lies. Izuku’s charisma. Izuku’s strength. Izuku’s quirk. Izuku’s quirks.

 

Oh. Were they even Izuku’s in the first place? Or was his father—All for One—simply giving and taking them away?

 

Toshinori even met the man. He went to his house.

 

It should have been obvious.

 

But he was cocky. Toshinori believed he’d already won, that even if All for One wasn’t dead, he was never going to come back.

 

He was wrong.

 

And now, here they are.

 

Izuku’s father, Midoriya Hisashi, is All for One.

 

Oh.

 

- - -

 

Over the next few seconds, everyone else in the vicinity falls into the realization like dominoes. Even if they don’t have the whole picture, they get the idea. Iida, Uraraka, Yaoyorozu, the few standing heroes—including Endeavor—Tsukauchi Naomasa, the rest of The League. Anyone conscious and within earshot understands.

 

Everyone except for Midoriya Izuku, who is still fighting back like his life depends on it.

 

Because it does.

 

Because Izuku’s brain will not allow him to realize, because he already knows. He’s known for a long, long time. But the knowledge was too cruel—is too cruel—so it’s been buried, even deeper than the basement. As deep as it can go.

 

Izuku cannot know. Not if he wants to continue being Midoriya Izuku.

 

Nobody moves. Nobody can. Not even All Might.

 

So nobody stops Father from saying, “Now that everyone is here, we can go ahead and get started. Hello.” Father smiles. It’s wider than his normal smile, longer, like there are more teeth in his mouth now than there were three days ago. “My name is Midoriya Hisashi, also known as All for One, the name of my quirk, which allows me to steal—and redistribute—other people’s quirks. I am All Might’s nemesis, a villain of 200 years, Izuku’s father—say hi, Izuku—and All Might’s nemesis.”

 

Izuku isn’t listening. He isn’t listening. He isn’t listening. He isn’t listening he isn’t listeningheisn’tlistening.

 

“Shigaraki Tomura, the face of The League, the villain who’s been terrorizing UA and Japan as a whole, is my successor, my adopted son, and also just so happens to be the grandson of All Might’s mentor, Shimura—”

 

Izuku has never interrupted his father before, but something deep down, like a sob, builds inside him with someone else’s voice and he can’t stop himself. Even though he isn’t listening—he isn’t listening—he says, “What are you saying, Father? I don’t understand. This isn’t funny. I don’t...”

 

He’s hot. Feverish. His whole body is shaking. Or is it the ground? The whole word? Everything is falling apart around him. Izuku feels like he’s in a dream. A nightmare. A coma. Anywhere but here.

 

Except his father doesn’t hesitate to continue, in the same conversational tone that’s permeated the dining room table his entire life, “Let me reintroduce you both. Izuku, this is your adopted brother, Tomura. I took him in when he was four, shortly before you were born. Tomura, this is your little brother, Izuku.”

 

Silence. Deafening silence, like a heartbeat stopped. Like a bomb in-between the final tick and the explosion.

 

Nobody moves. Nobody can. Not even All Might.

 

But Izuku’s father doesn’t stop. “I wanted to do this in a more private setting, but my hand was forced a little earlier than I was planning. I’m not mad, it’s just a little unfortunate. Oh well. Izuku, dear, my baby boy...” Father smiles down at him, softly, and it’s so familiar, so comforting. “I love you so much, Izuku. More than anything in the world. You know that, right?” Father slowly holds out his hand, palm up. “Now... give me One for All.”

 

 

 

What?

 

Something snaps.

 

Where Izuku had been shivering panic before, now he’s a perfectly still confusion.

 

Give Father One for All?

 

His muscles want to say yes. He can feel his body moving in that direction, it wants to give it over. Because that’s what Izuku’s always done—whatever his father wants. It isn’t a choice, anyway. It’s never been a choice. Father will just take it if he wants it...

 

So why hasn’t he already?

 

Izuku stares.

 

Beads of sweat drip down his face.

 

Give me One for All.

 

But One for All isn’t Father’s quirk it’s—

 

No, it isn’t All Might’s, either, it’s—

 

One for All is Izuku’s quirk. Isn’t that what Gran Torino taught him?

 

Izuku’s eyes drift. Next to him, Shouto’s still supporting Hitoshi. Again. Directly behind them, Iida looks more terrified than he ever did when they were battling Stain. Uraraka isn’t moving, but tears stream steadily down her face. Yaoyorozu’s clutching Uraraka’s hands with her own, like they’ll die if they let go of each other.

 

Further down, a few dozen yards away, Aizawa is staring directly at him. His expression is stern, yet anxious. Terrified, yet confident. Logical, yet emotional. Aizawa Shouta, Izuku’s teacher, mentor, and perhaps the first adult he’s ever truly trusted, makes eye contact, and he hears Aizawa’s voice clearly in his head:

 

You aren’t alone.

 

So Izuku looks back. At his father. It’s alright. None of this makes sense, anyway. It probably isn’t even real, so what harm could it do?

 

Izuku already dug his grave when he dug out of the basement. There’s no turning back.

 

Father’s already mad at him.

 

Father already won’t forgive him.

 

He made his decision. Izuku already picked his side.

 

Give me One for All.

 

So Izuku can do this. He can say a single syllable. The least he can do is say:

 

“No.”

 

 

 

After half a moment, Father frowns. The air grows charged as he says, “That was not a request, Izuku.” His voice is harder, now, exactly like it sounds whenever he’s trying to hide his anger.

 

Izuku is drowning in yellow, but perhaps that’s why it comes easier than it otherwise would. Because the yellow drowns out anything else, any hesitation. He may not understand what’s happening, but he already knows where he stands. He can’t go back, anyway. He promised he’d do this. His swan song. His last day as Peacekeeper. He’ll do whatever it takes to save as many people as he can, and that means repeating:

 

“No.”

 

Past the yellow, Izuku watches Father drop his hand back to his side. “Are you sure?” Father asks, slowly. When Izuku doesn’t respond, Father says, “Alright, you leave me no choice, then.” Father curls his hand into a fist, and Izuku’s temperature rises.

 

Then, for some god-awful reason, Father turns toward Shouto and says, “Todoroki Shouto, do you like poetry?” He doesn’t give a chance for a response. “I was inspired by Izuku’s... disappointing display at the sports festival when I decided to give him this quirk in particular.”

 

Maybe it’s the smothering, terrifying stress, but Izuku’s temperature keeps rising.

 

Father continues, turning back to him, “You have to realize, Izuku, that you cannot defy me and win. This is not a world you’ll ever succeed in without my support, just as this is not a quirk you’ll ever be able to control without me... I know you’ve heard of the villain Run Hots, Izuku, but have you ever wondered why he became a villain in the first place?”

 

Run Hots? Why is Father bringing him up now, here of all places?

 

Does it have anything to do with the constant heat that’s been building inside Izuku’s chest for days, if not weeks?

 

“A sad story,” Father resumes, “albeit a tad boring. The man had a daughter, who inherited a quirk not unlike his own. Her resting body temperature was incredibly, incredibly high, and as she grew up, it only rose. Except... her body could not properly handle it. Perhaps it came in too early, or perhaps it was incompatible with the traits she inherited from her mother’s quirk, but that isn’t important. In a last-resort attempt to save her, her father begged me to take her quirk. So I did.”

 

The moment of silence is warm.

 

Izuku wants to stop listening, but he can’t.

 

“There are certain... complications that sometimes arrive with quirk removal, especially in a body so young. To be blunt, she got sick—dreadfully slow—but worse than that, neither were prepared for the social repercussions of being quirkless. Her father never figured out if it was suicide or illness that took the girl before her tenth birthday, but after that, he became Run Hots.”

 

Izuku is sweating. It soaks through his hero costume. He feels like he’s in a sauna.

 

“Friends can be a strength, Izuku, but they can also be your greatest weakness. These...” Father scowls and waves a dismissive hand toward his friends. “These immature, ignorant, powerless children are only holding you back. You need to let go of them, before they let go of you. Do you really think they’ll still be your friends after this? Now that they know who you are? Now that they know where your quirks really come from? You are my son, Izuku—the son of a villain. And what does that make you? 

 

“Give me One for All, Izuku. Come with me, and I won’t have to prove it to you. You won’t have to watch them abandon you.”

 

Abandon?

 

Izuku has been ready to abandon them the instant he escaped from being grounded.

 

But them abandon him?

 

Izuku can’t imagine it, so he lifts up his chin and defiantly looks directly at his father’s face, even though it’s half-covered by his helmet.

 

Father sighs. “I didn’t want to do this, but you leave me no choice. You brought this upon yourself, Izuku. I can’t be held responsible anymore. I’m going to let go of my control over this quirk, and you’re finally going to see that you can’t do anything without me. You never could.”

 

Father extends his arm, squeezes his hand into a fist, then lets it go.

 

 

 

It burns hotter, from the inside, from everywhere. Izuku’s skin starts to tint pink, then red.

 

He feels like he’s filling with smoke—suffocating—like it’s burning through all the air. He can barely breathe. Sweat drips down his forehead except he hears it sizzle—feels it sizzle, boiling at the contact. He takes off his jacket but it doesn’t help. It just keeps burning. And then his shirt starts smoking, and one of the sleeves actually catches on fire—just a bit—and it burns. Regeneration fights against it, like a tug-of-war with his own skin, and he feels it stabilizing—but it still burns.

 

It still burns but worse than that—Shouto reaches out with his right hand, places it on Izuku’s skin and it sizzles. Despite his quirk—the cold side—Shouto’s palm still burns. It burns and Izuku can’t stop it. Regeneration can control it inside Izuku—enough to keep him from dying—but no more. Regeneration can’t stop it from burning the air, from burning Izuku’s friends.

 

It’s only getting hotter and Izuku whispers, “Let go.” But he looks in Shouto’s eyes and all he can see is determination—the determination that Shouto’s always had.

 

He isn’t going to let go.

 

And Shouto says, like the air isn’t visibly wavering with heat, like he isn’t already sweating from head to toe; “I do like poetry.”

 

“I can’t control it,” Izuku whispers. Not enough. Not like this. It’s a part of him now, a part he can’t turn off, because that’s not how a body works. He can’t just will his heart to stop pumping blood. He can’t will this quirk to stop radiating heat.

 

But what he can do is protect his friends. What Izuku can do is distance himself.

 

But then Hitoshi places his hand on Izuku’s shoulder, despite the audible sound it makes. He cringes, but Hitoshi still says, “You can control it.”

 

They’re both sweating, but neither move back. Izuku tries to pull away but from behind someone wraps him in a hug. There’s a stifled scream—Izuku isn’t sure if it’s his or someone else’s—and then Uraraka lets out a quiet whine, but she doesn’t let go.

 

Stop it.

 

“Let go,” Izuku orders. His eyes are wide. He’s trying to fight off the quirk and his friends. They’re just going to get hurt. He’s just going to hurt them. This isn’t—

 

This isn’t why he did this. This isn’t why he dug out of the basement this isn’t why he told his father no. They’re supposed to be safe. He’s supposed to protect them. They’re supposed to let him go. “Go away!” he yells, but all that happens is Iida and Yaoyorozu stepping closer, placing their hands on his other arm, burning.

 

Izuku tugs and pushes but they don’t let go. He should be able to fight them off with One for All but the fever’s making everything foggy and One for All isn’t working right. They don’t let go, so Izuku turns to his father and screams, “Take it back!”

 

It’s only getting hotter. Izuku can sense Shouto trying to cool the air down with his own quirk, but there’s only so much he can do. How much hotter is it going to get? Is it ever going to stop?

 

This isn’t fair.

 

None of them will let go no matter how hard he tries to shove them off. Not Shouto, not Hitoshi, not Uraraka, not Iida, not Yaoyoruzu. They might die at this rate, but none of them let go.

 

“Take it back!”

 

 

Father smiles.

 

 

“I can’t,” Father says, with an out-of-place lightness. “I’m sorry, son, but that’s the tricky thing about One for All. It’s the only quirk I can’t take and, well... it’s completely absorbed every other quirk I’ve ever given you. So I can’t take it back.”

 

Oh.

 

So he can’t take One for All. That’s why Father’s doing all this. He can’t have it unless Izuku gives it to him.

 

But that doesn’t matter right now.

 

Everything is so loud. The burning. The yellow. The screaming.

 

In his ear someone is whispering. Over and over again. It’s Shouto, and it’s the same thing Izuku told him once: “It’s your quirk.”

 

Except, “It isn’t,” Izuku sobs. It was some poor little girl’s quirk and Father probably killed her and now it’s stuck inside him. It isn’t his. None of them are. Not really. Even if he tries to tell himself they are. They never were and they never will be. Not Pull. Not Regeneration. Not even One for All. Not really.

 

“Izuku,” someone says, voice quiet. He can’t tell who it is. There’s so much happening and it’s so hot and a sharp pain bounces across his cheek.

 

Everything comes into focus.

 

“Izuku,” Hitoshi repeats.

 

Izuku tells him, “Get away—” and then Hitoshi’s quirk kicks in. It silences everything else. Comforting. Quiet. Release. In that moment, nothing exists except for Izuku and Hitoshi.

 

“It’s your quirk.” Hitoshi orders: “Control it.”

 

 

 

Everything disappears.

 

Izuku finds himself in a perfectly white landscape—white hot—infinitely large—and completely silent, save for a quiet sobbing.

 

Izuku turns around.

 

A little girl is laying there, curled up into a small ball. She’s crying, actively on fire, and tied to a set of thick chains that trail off infinitely into the white expanse.

 

- - -

 

This silence is of a different caliber, sharp enough to snap most people out of whatever paralysis All for One had trapped them with.

 

Toshinori can move, now, but as he takes a single step forward All for One turns to him with a disturbingly wide smile—undeniably a mockery of All Might’s signature—and says, “Hello again, Yagi-kun.”

 

Toshinori can move. He should move. But he has no idea in which direction to go.

 

He’s supposed to attack this man, isn’t he? All for One? Except—

 

Except Midoriya Izuku is right there and—

 

How much of it was true?

 

Toshinori has always known how good of a liar Izuku is. It scared him at first, but then he got used to it, and now it scares him again. Izuku’s a great liar. So… how much has he lied to Toshinori? How much of the past year was true?

 

Toshinori should feel something. He looks over. Izuku’s struggling against that quirk All for One gave him.

 

Or is he?

 

No. Toshinori bites back the distrust. No—this is exactly the rabbit hole All for One wants him to fall into. Toshinori can see it clearly in All for One’s twisted, familiar, evil smile. All for One wants Toshinori to start doubting, to lose hope, to break.

 

And for that reason, Toshinori refuses. He won’t fall into the trap. He won’t let All for One win.

 

This is how All for One’s always done it. He’s always used anything he can to break you: his fists, his quirks, a bullet, a knife, a hostage, civilians, words, silence, your mentor, her grandson, your mentee, Izuku.

 

Toshinori refuses. He won’t break. He won’t doubt. Because no matter what, Toshinori is still a hero—a teacher—and Izuku is still a child and it doesn’t matter if—

 

It doesn’t matter if—

 

Doesn’t it?

 

All for One is a villain, a public enemy, a murderer—the worst man alive in the entire world. So doesn’t it matter? Doesn’t it matter that this man is Izuku’s father? That for the last fifteen years—

 

NO!

 

Toshinori grits his teeth and slaps himself across his cheek.

 

All for One laughs. “Yagi-kun,” he continues with that sickening smile, “I can see those gears stuttering inside your head like a broken record, struggling to spin.”

 

Toshinori is All Might. All for One’s nemesis. The eighth holder of One for All. His connection is slipping, but it’s still there, for now.

 

So for now, Toshinori will fight All for One.

 

He throws a quick Oklahoma Smash to make up for the one he didn’t use earlier, but it lacks his usual strength, and he knows it. Toshinori doesn’t even announce it, and All for One blocks it with an array of dark spheres that absorb the impact before disappearing.

 

“Let me ask you one thing, Yagi-kun...” All for One smirks and spreads out both of his arms in a familiar showmanship. “Do you really think this has all been a coincidence?”

 

All for One needs to stop talking, so Toshinori kicks wide with 500% strength, sending a powerful shockwave at him, but the villain—Izuku’s father—dodges by shooting lightning downward to levitate him in the opposite direction.

 

“I’m impressed at the persistence of your naivety, Toshinori,” All for One declares as an extra set of arms grow out of his back. “You still think Izuku’s your successor?” All for One’s twenty fingers turn dark red, and then shoot like bullets at Toshinori.

 

Toshinori dodges with One for All, but it grazes his costume.

 

“Do you really think you found Izuku by chance? That the disgusting, cheap, weak, subpar slime villain just happened to attack my son? That you just happened to be there? That you just happened to pick my son to be your successor?”

 

This isn’t good. Toshinori’s successfully blocking All for One’s attacks, but failing to block out his words. It’s impossible. It’s impossible because All for One is right and Toshinori’s connection to One for All is waning. He doesn’t have much left in him, so he’s going to have to make the next one count. 1,000%—no, 10,000%. Maybe even more. As much as he has left.

 

Toshinori stockpiles. Starts powering up.

 

“No,” All for One continues. His voice is loud and deep and powerful and irrefutable. “No, from the moment he was born, I have been crafting Izuku to become the next holder of One for All. To hand me the quirk of his own volition.”

 

Toshinori doesn’t have the luxury to think about what that means, to think about what life must have been like for Izuku all these years, but the worry simmers in the pit of Toshinori’s stomach.

 

United...

 

“I have been crafting Izuku to become my successor alongside Tomura, who—don’t forget—is the grandson of your mentor. What was her name again?”

 

States...

 

“Shimura Nana.”

 

Of...

 

“That’s why I let Izuku nurture his little seedling of heroism. To get One for All back in the family. But more importantly, to get to you.”

 

Toshinori’s fist is inches from All for One’s face when his connection to One for All snaps and his body starts deflating. It feels different than he thought it would. He thought it would hurt, but in reality it feels more like taking off a jacket—like it’s something he already lost.

 

His willpower wants to disappear with it, as if All for One were sucking it out of Toshinori like a black hole. It’s so tempting. It would be so much easier to give up here. To admit that this was a battle he lost fifteen years ago, when All for One decided to raise Izuku as his son.

 

But Toshinori refuses.

 

None of that matters.

 

It doesn’t matter if he’s lost One for All.

 

It doesn’t matter if All for One scripted this past year—the past fifteen years.

 

It doesn’t matter if Shigaraki Tomura is Shimura Tenko.

 

It doesn’t matter if Midoriya Izuku is the son of All for One because right now there are only two things in the whole world that matter:

 

Yogi Toshinori will always be All Might.

 

But more importantly: Toshinori already decided to put his faith in Izuku—both figuratively and literally—and that is not a decision he regrets. It’s a decision he’ll stick by no matter what. Izuku is already the best hero Toshinori’s ever met, and nothing will ever change that, especially not All for One.

 

Even if he’s quirkless again, this time for good, he’ll continue protecting what’s important to him.

 

His fist still hovers in the air, deflated, an inch away from All for One, and Toshinori coughs up blood. Vomits something. A portion of his stomach lining, perhaps. It’s happened before. It’ll likely happen again. But he still stands. He still stands in between All for One and his students.

 

If all Toshinori can do now is buy them an extra couple seconds, then he’ll do it. He’s a hero. He’s All Might. He’s Yagi Toshinori.

 

He’s close enough to All for One to see the thick scars peeking out from underneath his helmet.

 

“I chose months ago,” Toshinori says. His voice comes out quieter than he wanted it to, and a little wet as blood continues to creep up his throat. “I’ve put my faith in Izuku. Nothing you say will ever change that. He’s still Izuku. He’s still my successor. He’s still the best goddamn hero I know.”

 

All for One laughs again, and Toshinori is close enough now that his body wants to take a step away from it, but he manages to hold his ground.

 

Then All for One lifts up his right hand and Toshinori feels the strongest fear he’s ever felt. Standing in front of All for One, quirkless, Toshinori feels like an ant—like a single fleck of dust. The only thing he can think to do is blurt, “You can’t kill me. Izuku will never forgive you.”

 

All for One hesitates before saying, “Impressive. I didn’t expect you to be capable of trying to manipulate me.”

 

“I’m not manipulating you,” Toshinori says with a growing confidence. “I’m simply stating a fact.”

 

“Call it what you will, but you definitely hold a serious misconception about what it means to be a father. It means I know what’s best for him—for both Izuku and Tomura. Not them, and certainly not you. It means I don’t care if he’ll forgive me or not.”

 

Toshinori’s stomach drops in an unfortunate combination of chronic illness and utter disgust. He scowls and musters up as much strength as he can to declare, “You’re a cruel man, All for One. But even worse, you’re a terrible father.”

 

All for One’s smile drops, and he looks serious for the first time. “I am not going to kill you, Toshinori, because you still have further to fall.”

 

And then All for One hits Toshinori in his side.

 

Toshinori tries to block it, but he just goes flying—tumbling across the ruins as rocks and rubble and sharp corners dig into his body. His consciousness wanes, but he forces himself to stay awake. As long as his kids are here and they’re in danger, Toshinori refuses to pass out. He doesn’t care if it will kill him.

 

All for One spares him another glance, but nothing more, and then turns around. He starts walking toward Shigaraki Tomura—toward Shimura Tenko—toward Nana’s grandson.

 

- - -

 

But Tomura isn’t looking at Sensei as he walks over.

 

Instead, Tomura is staring past him at Midoriya Izuku—who’s half unconscious, half on-fire, and being fully supported by a huddle of five hero brats.

 

Tomura’s mind spins in circles, carried aloft in a whirlpool, except wherever the final destination is—whatever’s at the center—Tomura doesn’t want to know.

 

He doesn’t understand.

 

He won’t ever understand what Sensei was thinking—what he’s thinking right now—but more than that, he doesn’t understand:

 

Why is Izuku over there, while Tomura’s stuck back here? 

 

With Sensei as his father, how’d Izuku manage that? How’d Izuku make it there under those circumstances? Under the same circumstances as Tomura?

 

How’d Izuku make it into the light?

 

Why’d Sensei give him the option, but not Tomura? Or...

 

Did Tomura have the option this whole time? Could he have been over there, as well?

 

In another world, is Tomura holding Izuku’s hand, too?

 

He doesn’t understand.

 

Why is Tomura here? Why did he have to be a villain? 

 

Did he have to be a villain?

 

Izuku didn’t. Did Tomura?

 

He doesn’t understand.

 

Tomura’s stuck over here and... and Izuku looks like he’s having so much fun. He has friends. Friends to play with.

 

But it’s too late. It’s too late for Tomura. He thought it had always been too late, since the beginning, for as long as he could remember, and yet...

 

It isn’t too late for Izuku.

 

In another world, are he and Izuku on the same side?

 

In another world, is Tomura having fun?

 

If Izuku could, why couldn’t Tomura?

 

Was it really that close this whole time?

 

This isn’t fair.

 

This isn’t fair. This isn’t fair. This isn’t fair this isn’t fair this isn’t fair this isn’tfairthisisn’tfairisn’tfairisn’tfairisn’t—

 

Oh.

 

This is all Sensei’s—

 

Sensei places a hand on Tomura’s shoulder; he flinches with his whole body, but it doesn’t hurt. Yet. So Tomura looks up at him.

 

There is a softness in Sensei’s face that Tomura recognizes, that instinctively relaxes him. That’s right. This is Sensei he’s talking about.

 

Sensei smiles something small, then wraps both arms around Tomura and pulls him into a tight hug. Tomura melts into it, grabs Sensei’s shirt with both hands as tight as he can. He takes a deep breath in, another out. It smells like Sensei. It smells like home.

 

After a moment, Sensei runs his fingers through Tomura’s hair, in that way he hasn’t in a couple years, since he said Tomura had outgrown that stuff.

 

That’s right. 

 

Tomura isn’t alone. He has Sensei. He always has. That’s all that matters.

 

Things will be different, now, but not so different. Even if... even though Sensei lied, it isn’t really that important. Sensei’s always been like that. He knows what’s right, not Tomura. He just has to trust Sensei.

 

It doesn’t mean anything. Midoriya doesn’t mean anything.

 

It’s alright. It’ll be alright. Because Sensei is here.

 

Because Sensei loves him.

 

 

Right?

 

- - -

 

The man—Midoriya Hisashi—All for One—is distracted.

 

It’s a risk, and every remaining line of rationality in his brain is begging Shouta not to do it, but he doesn’t have a choice. He can’t not do it, not when his kids are right fucking there.

 

He starts slowly, at first. Crouches low to the ground, even though most of the cover’s been utterly obliterated, and takes a small step forward. His entire body feels heavy, like his heart is trying to ground him in place. Every cell is screaming not to move, that there are no second chances—in more ways than one. This may likely be Shouta’s last chance to get over there, to see his kids before—

 

Shouta has no idea what’s going to happen from here. He can’t make a single prediction.

 

So there’s a possibility—it makes him sick to his stomach—but there’s a possibility that this is the last chance Shouta will ever get to see Izuku again. That’s the only thing that matters. Even though he understands, just as a mouse does before an elephant, that if All for One wants him dead, Shouta will die.

 

It doesn’t matter.

 

Shouta runs.

 

- - -

 

In the white landscape of a place that doesn’t exist, Izuku takes a step toward the little girl, who similarly doesn’t exist. But despite that, she’s still sitting there, crying and on fire and covered in chains.

 

Izuku kneels down next to her, but despite the flames she doesn’t feel hot at all. At least, no hotter than Izuku.

 

“I’m sorry,” she sobs, “I’m so sorry. I’m not—I’m not in control. Not like this. I’m so sorry. I don’t want to—I’m sorry.”

 

Izuku reaches out a hand to try to comfort her, ignoring the flames, ignoring the fact that, when he gets close enough, they spread to him, too—lick up his arms, catch his clothes and skin and hair on fire. But he doesn’t feel it. Because it isn’t real. So he places a hand on her shoulder.

 

She startles, tries to jump backward but the chains pull taut. Despite how long they are, they give her no wiggle room.

 

“It’s okay,” Izuku tells her, as if he believes it. Hitoshi helped. Izuku feels a little calmer than he was a minute ago, a little more stable. “We can do this.”

 

She shakes her head, back and forth. God, she can’t be much older than six. “No,” she sobs. “We can’t! It isn’t! I don’t want to hurt anybody but I can’t control it!”

 

“It isn’t your fault,” Izuku says first. Then, “We can control it—you—the quirk.” That’s what Hitoshi said, so that’s what Izuku will do.

 

She tugs at the chains, swings her head up to stare into his eyes. “He controls it. He controls me!”

 

“He doesn’t,” Izuku tells her. “He let you go, remember?”

 

“He lied!” she yells, and Izuku flinches back like he’d been slapped. “He always lies! He always has!”

 

No his father is—his father isn’t—it isn’t like that—his father isn’t like that—

 

But then the white landscape collapses around them into four walls, a ceiling, a perfectly made bed, a desk empty save for a monitor. Izuku’s bedroom. He automatically spins around to find the door except—it’s covered in those same chains, holding it locked, and when Izuku tries the knob it doesn’t even budge.

 

He’s trapped. He’s locked in his room. Again. Where are the keys? Where are his lockpicks?

 

He can’t get out. He can’t get out he can’t get out he can’tgetouthecan’t—

 

A hand settles on his Izuku’s shoulder, warm and familiar, and next to him stands a woman, a little shorter than him, with shoulder-length green hair and soft eyes. “I’m sorry, baby,” she starts, quiet. “But you can’t deny it any longer. You can’t hide from this forever. It isn’t sustainable. You deserve better.”

 

“It isn’t—it isn’t like that,” Izuku insists, as he tugs at the chains covering the door.

 

“Isn’t like what?”

 

“My father isn’t like that. I love him. He loves me.”

 

“That doesn’t change what he’s done to you, baby. He locked you up, he lied to you, your whole life—”

 

“It isn’t like that!” Izuku exclaims. “He only ever wanted what was best for me! He never hurt me. He never would.”

 

The woman brushes Izuku’s bangs out of his eyes and looks into them. “What he put you through, Izuku, it’s like... grains of sand.” She holds out her hand, and a small pile of sand appears in her palm. 

 

“Individually, one grain appears harmless, but when they add up, over time...” More sand appears, out of nowhere, and the pile grows, until it’s too big, and it starts tumbling past her fingertips. Onto the floor, exponentially, and the sand starts to fill the room, covers the carpet, and then it reaches Izuku’s knees. He can’t move, hypnotized, as the room fills with so much sand that the woman is buried under it, and it reaches his chest, and then it’s tall enough that the next breath he takes is more sand than air and—

 

She continues, “you’ll drown.” All the sand disappears, like it was never there in the first place, because it wasn’t. “He may not have hurt you physically, Izuku, but the way he treated you... it wasn’t healthy. It isn’t healthy. You heard what he told All Might, didn’t you? I’m so sorry, baby, but he’s been using you—manipulating you. You know it, baby, you always have. You just need to accept it.”

 

“I can’t!” Izuku yells. “Because that means—! Because if that’s true, then I knew. I should’ve known. This whole time. And I should’ve—I should’ve done something. I could have helped all those people, I could have—my father loves me. He isn’t a perfect man, but he loves me.”

 

“That doesn’t make it okay,” she insists. “That won’t ever change who he is.” She takes Izuku’s hands in her own. 

 

“A couple days ago, Hitoshi asked you a question: would you ever treat your own kid that way? It was a good question, but not the right one. Look out the window, Izuku.”

 

But there isn’t a window—yet, past the chains covering the door, there’s a small window carved out that doesn’t belong there. He can just about make out the ruins, further away, where his father stands next to Shigaraki.

 

Father towers over him. Has he always been that tall? He has a hand on Shigarki’s shoulder, and he leans down to say something.

 

Before he does, the woman continues, “The right question is this: what if someone else was treated the same way you were?”

 

Father whispers something Izuku should not be able to hear, since there’s a door and a wall and dozens of yards in between them. But Izuku hears it anyway, because Shigaraki Tomura stands there like a mirror. Father says, “I love you, Tomura, but...”

 

But...

 

Even though it isn’t directed at him, the word makes Izuku’s heart sink. Father says it to him all the time, and yet it’s never once lost its edge. And Izuku can no longer deny it. The but always precedes a request, a manipulation, a Conversation, something that needs to be done, something that needs to be fulfilled, or else... this part is always silent, but it’s always there. If you don’t succeed, that love might disappear.

 

This is how he gets you to do something you don’t want to do. He convinces you, with only four syllables, that if you don’t do it, he won’t love you anymore. That’s all it takes.

 

That’s how he’s been talking to Tomura all these years.

 

That’s how he’s been talking to Izuku.

 

I love you, Tomura, but...

 

Father declares, “Izuku’s my son,” like a bullet. Worse than a bullet, because Tomura’s despair is palpable in his wide eyes, the devastated blue that permeates the ground below him.

 

Father built him up, then tore him down.

 

What if someone else was treated the same way you were?

 

Father keeps going, without letting up, “and he always will be. That means, Tomura, from here on out... you’re going to have to prove yourself to me. You’re going to have to show me that you are fit to be my successor.”

 

Wait! Izuku wants to yell, but he’s still trapped behind his bedroom door. It doesn’t have to be this way!

 

But Father just keeps driving the wedge in. “I want it to be you, Tomura. But you see it, don’t you? You of all people understand how capable Izuku is. So you have to prove that you’re better.”

 

It doesn’t have to be like this.

 

But Tomura is only getting further away, the space between them a tie-dye of blue and red.

 

This isn’t right. It doesn’t have to be like this. They don’t—

 

Oh.

 

They don’t have to be on opposite sides.

 

Izuku can see it now: the mirror. Clearly.

 

What if someone else was treated the same way you were?

 

What if a little boy named Tomura were locked in his bedroom, then convinced it was all his fault?

 

What if a little boy named Tomura were trapped in the basement for days, with nothing but water?

 

What if a little boy named Tomura had his own quirk ripped out of him whenever he did anything wrong?

 

What if a little boy named Tomura wanted nothing more than to make his father figure proud of him? What if it was impossible?

 

How could Father treat Tomura like that? How could Father do something so despicable to a little boy—alone and vulnerable. How could father be so cruel to Tomura?

 

How could Father do that to them?

 

To the both of them?

 

 

Izuku looks at the woman with the green hair. He knows who she is. He always has. The shadow of his mother, Inko. Her quirk, Pull.

 

And he feels so small. And he feels the strongest he’s felt in his entire life.

 

Because this isn’t something he can walk away from. This isn’t something he can ignore. This isn’t something he can let go.

 

Izuku knows the truth, now. Nothing else matters, only this: he and his father are never going to be on the same side.

 

His mother places a kiss on his forehead. “Oh, Izuku,” she whispers. “I am so, so proud of you. You can’t ever forget: you have so many people around who want to help you.”

 

Someone else takes his hand—the little girl on fire. She’s still wrapped up in those chains, just like his bedroom door. 

 

Izuku knows what he has to do, now. It’s something only he can do, since All Might’s connection to One for All is gone, since:

 

“It’s your quirk,” Izuku tells her, because that’s the last thing Hitoshi said to him. Then, “It’s our quirk. Not his. Not anymore.”

 

He smiles down at her, though he’s trembling with fear. “We can do this. Together. You and I.”

 

She looks up at him, and smiles back.

 

And then the bedroom disappears, and over a dozen figures surround them. Quirks. Those that his father’s given him, and those he now knows must have come with One for All. They chorus, “All of us.”

 

And the chains shatter.



 

Izuku takes a sharp breath as everything snaps back into focus.

 

It feels cold—cold! He did it. The quirk still warms him from the inside, but in a way that’s comforting, rather than dangerous. Because he can control it, now. Intuitively, he can sense the heat, has an inkling of what he’d have to do to raise it higher, or drop it lower.

 

There are so many experiments he wants to do with it, in the future—

 

Maybe in the future—

 

What future?

 

Nothing will ever be the same again, even if he survives.

 

The place he’s called home his whole life doesn’t exist anymore. Where will he go? Where will Father take him—

 

Father is a villain.

 

This is something only Izuku can do.

 

Nothing will ever be the same again and yet, from behind him, Ochako laughs quietly, and exclaims in a whisper, “You did it! Midori, you did it!”

 

None of his friends have moved from his vicinity, even though they’re all drenched in sweat, including Shouto. Ice creeps up their legs, but Izuku can tell by how melted it is that it wasn’t very effective. How much did he hurt them?

 

How much did Father hurt them?

 

Izuku knows what he has to do.

 

He doesn’t want to do it.

 

He’ll almost definitely fail.

 

But it doesn’t matter.

 

Because Midoriya Izuku is a hero—is Peacekeeper—is All Might’s successor—is best friends with the kindest, nicest, strongest people in the world—is a student at UA—is taught by Aizawa Shouta—is the son of Midoriya Inko—

 

is the son of Midoriya Hisashi: All for One, All Might’s archnemesis, the leader of The League of Villains, and a terrible, manipulative, abusive father.

 

Midoriya Izuku is One for All.

 

Which is why he has to do this.

 

Izuku looks at his father, who’s halved the distance between Tomura and Izuku, standing right in-between them, in the middle of the block. Izuku’s hands shake. His eyes water. He reaches for the closest hand to his, and he grabs it. Aizawa’s standing right next to him, tall and strong and stable. He’s dyed the same yellow as everyone else, but that doesn’t stop him from squeezing Izuku’s hand in reassurance.

 

Quietly, Izuku whispers, “I’m scared.” He feels so small. Like he’s four years old again. “I can’t… I can’t do this by myself. I need… I need help.”

 

Aizawa stares into Izuku’s eyes and says the same thing he’s been saying for months: “You are not alone.”

 

Izuku nods, then turns back to the clearing, and despite it all, despite fifteen years of fear, Izuku says in a clear voice, loud and projecting; “You are right about one thing, Father: this is not a quirk I can control on my own. But you were wrong about something else...”

 

Izuku finally means it, Izuku finally says it with confidence: “I am not alone.”

 

Father—no—All for One sighs. “I see... that is a rather unfortunate lesson to have learned from this, but—oh well. I will say it nicely only one more time, Izuku.” All for One extends his hand again. 

 

“Give me One for All. If you do, I’ll allow you and these friends of yours to continue this happy-go-lucky charade. Neither I nor The League will ever interrupt you again. You can go back to UA, and you can all pretend like none of this ever happened.”

 

It’s a lie.

 

Izuku knows, intuitively, immediately: it’s a lie.

 

He knows because it’s too good to be true. It is exactly what he wants, so it has to be a lie.

 

“Or,” All for One continues, “you can say no and I will be very, very disappointed in you.”

 

Izuku stops breathing. The pressure in the air grows tenfold, hundredfold, like radiation. This is his father. This is the man with many quirks, so many that Izuku doesn’t even know how many. At least a dozen. Probably more.

 

But Izuku can still say:

 

“No.”

 

And slide his feet into a fighting stance, even though his legs won’t stop shaking.

 

“I see,” All for One says, voice saturated with condescension. “Do you really think you stand a chance, Izuku? Even with One for All? Even with a couple ‘friends’? All you’re doing is putting them in danger.”

 

Perhaps. Perhaps they don’t stand a chance, but that doesn’t make this the wrong choice.

 

This is something Izuku has to do if he ever wants to live with himself.

 

This is something Izuku has to do to stay Midoriya Izuku.

 

Past All for One, Izuku makes eye contact with Tomura, but there’s an invisible wall between them that wasn’t there before, and Izuku understands. Tomura can’t see it yet—he might have recognized the man between them, but Tomura isn’t sure yet which side he’s on. It’ll take time before he recognizes who their real enemy is.

 

To the side, a relatively safe distance away, Yagi lies collapsed on some rubble. He’s conscious—alive—but he’s in his deflated form, and he fails to stand up no matter how many times he tries.

 

One for All pumps through Izuku’s muscles, bones, cells, atoms. He stares at his father’s face, half-covered by that unfamiliar helmet, and he wants to throw up.

 

Next to him, Aizawa nods. Iida’s engines rev quietly. The air grows colder. Hitoshi whispers something under his breath that’s probably a joke.

 

And they charge forward.

 

 

With One for All in his legs, Izuku sprints directly toward All for One. So he watches clearly as the man grows in size—muscles bulge—a third set of arms, gray, like metal grow—dark lightning skitters across the field—small black orbs hover in the air like bombs.

 

Izuku can’t feel anything. There’s an empty numbness as he approaches, as he powers up a punch with One for All.

 

How is this happening? How did it come to this? How is this real?

 

It doesn’t matter.

 

Izuku can’t think about it.

 

So when he gets within a couple feet, when he gets close enough, he pulls back his arm and

 

 

there is an explosion

 

 

a shockwave that threatens to throw Izuku off his feet but he stands strong.

 

Everyone else, though, was knocked backward, to the ground.

 

Electricity in the air buzzes around him. Static. Like sharp little knives. But Izuku stands strong. The wind forces tears from his eyes. He wasn’t going to cry.

 

Izuku stands strong.

 

He pulls his arm back and yells and

 

All for One—Father—yells,

 

“Stop! ” in that tone that means he’s serious, that there’s going to be punishment later, that if Izuku doesn’t stop he’s going to regret it but Izuku doesn’t want to stop but his body freezes without his permission and he stops.

 

Father stares down at him, and he’s Father again. Two arms, a button-down shirt, and a concerned frown.

 

Izuku can’t move. He feels like he's back in the dining room and Father’s about to send him to the basement.

 

Then Father’s expression softens, and Izuku can breathe again.

 

“Izuku, my boy...” Father starts. “You are my son, after all. Stubborn, defiant, confident. I tried to ignore it, but you really are in your rebellious phase.”

 

Izuku should do something. But what? Father’s close enough to hit—but hit him? Could Izuku really?

 

His friends have all been knocked down, still conscious, but not in fighting condition.

 

This isn’t something Izuku can do alone.

 

“You are my son, Izuku,” Father continues, “and I love you, so I’ll respect whatever decision you make.”

 

Huh?

 

“Of course, if this is your final decision, then from here on out, we’ll be on opposite sides.”

 

This isn’t—this is the last thing Izuku was expecting.

 

This is, perhaps, more concerning than if Father had hit him.

 

“We’ll always be family, Izuku, no matter what, even if you insist on defying me. But like this... my boy, you don’t stand a chance. So, as your father, let me give you a helping hand.”

 

Father takes a step closer.

 

“You’ve both grown up so fast. I can’t deny it any longer, so I suppose it’s time I let you and Tomura take it from here... but Izuku, if you really want to do this, if you really want to stay on that side, and put up an actual fight... you’re going to need more power than you already have.”

 

What does that mean?

 

What does that mean?

 

Izuku’s heart rate spikes and he takes a stumbling step backward, but Father immediately grabs his shoulder, hard enough to bruise.

 

“I want to help you, Izuku,” Father says, but his smile is a threat. “So, this time, I’ll give you four more quirks.”

 

Four?

 

Someone else might have been ecstatic. Someone else might have cheered. But Izuku begs, “Wait—” and struggles against Father’s grip.

 

Izuku can’t deny it anymore. He knows his father well enough to see this for what it really is: Father exerting more of his control, deciding which quirks Izuku gets. Father isolating him from his friends. Because if he does this, Izuku will have eight quirks, and everyone else in the world will only have one.

 

Izuku will be something different.

 

Izuku will be more like a nomu than a human.

 

Izuku tries to pull himself backward. He doesn’t want it. “Please—” This isn’t what he wants. But Father’s grip is strong and he’s never cared about what Izuku wants. “Stop—”

 

From behind, Izuku can make out screaming. Aizawa yelling “stop it! ” Hitoshi rambling insults to try and get Father to react. But they’re so far away, and they can’t do anything and Izuku can’t do anything when Father places his other hand on Izuku’s shoulder—the crook of his neck.

 

Father’s hand is big enough he could strangle Izuku’s throat with just the one, but Father doesn’t. Instead, Father smiles, and shoves four quirks into Izuku.

 

It’s an insane pressure, suffocating, like Izuku’s getting crushed under a car compactor but, somehow, from the inside out. It hurts. He doesn’t know what quirks they are but he knows they hurt. 

 

Izuku’s only ever gotten a single quirk at a time before, and Father doesn’t even pace these out. He forces them all into Izuku at once and he’s drowning, he’s being ripped apart from the inside.

 

The moment is only a moment but it’s the longest one of Izuku’s life.

 

He throws up but the quirks don’t come out. They curdle in his stomach. It hurts. His vision blurs, his consciousness wanes.

 

Izuku’s legs drop from under him, but Father maintains his grip on Izuku and holds him up by the shoulder.

 

Izuku hangs, limp.

 

Father looks down at him, then lets out a long sigh. “I suppose that will have to do,” he says. Without turning away from Izuku, Father continues, “Tomura, unfortunately I can’t give you any more quirks as you are, but you are about to inherit a different kind of power, to keep the playing field fair. Now...”

 

Father tosses Izuku backward.

 

He stumbles, rolls, and at the last second Aizawa catches him. The hero stumbles, but manages to support Izuku’s weight. And then—

 

 

And then Father—Midoriya Hisashi—All for One—Sensei raises his hands and

 

 

puts them behind his head and

 

 

says,

 

 

“Take me to Tartarus.

 

 

“I surrender.”

 

 

 
Notes:

    OMG FOLKS I'M LITERALLY CRYING POSTING THIS. this chapter is SO important to me and I hope it hits y'all just as hard as it did me writing it :)

    I consider this to be the final chapter of Words as Weapons (Part 1), although there WILL be a chapter 40 which acts like an epilogue / setup for Part 2 (War of Words). This chapter is the one which concludes the major character arc of Words as Weapons, which is why I consider it the end :)

    i'm getting so emotional I started this fic like five or something years ago (crazy) as a senior in high school. I've now graduated from college and am currently pursuing my master's degree!! thank you all for following and supporting me on this ride so far. y'all mean so much to me and I couldn't have asked for better readers. this fic is super personal to me so I really appreciate all of the kindness <3
    love y'all so much! thank you all for all the kudos, bookmarks, and especially comments! i absolutely love reading your reactions, thoughts, hypotheses, and analyses!

    hoping to drop chapter 40 (tentatively titled "Nothing will ever be the same again") within 4 weeks, or end of April at the latest <3

Chapter 40: Nothing will ever be the same again
Notes:

    thank you again to platy for beta'ing this chapter!!!!!!!!! they are legitimately the god of grammar <3

    warnings: there are some cops in the first scene (they don’t do anything terrible, but they exist); the second scene is another Toga POV which sexualizes Tomura in such a way that platy “physically gagged at some points and had to take a break reading specifically from this pov” and insisted I “SPECIFICALLY warn the viewers ab this portion”... lmao have fun; Endeavor gets a POV in scene six; scene seven takes place in a hospital and has some medical stuff going on

    (as always, if you want more specifics about trigger warnings or summaries for a scene you’ve skipped, hmu in the comments or discord!)

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

Silence.

 

 

 

No one says a thing as the greatest villain in Japan slowly drops to his knees. No one can, even though everyone can sense it: this doesn’t feel right. It feels like a trap.

 

But right now, Shouta doesn’t care about the monster kneeling with his hands behind his head. Right now, all Shouta cares about is Midoriya Izuku, who’s still half in his arms, shivering, drenched in sweat. Izuku’s still radiating heat, though at this point it’s dangerous only to himself, not Shouta. He can’t imagine what it must’ve felt like—what it must be feeling like—suddenly and against his will receiving four quirks at once.

 

Shouta can make out pale, neon green lights that occasionally flare along Izuku’s skin—he can only hope it’s Izuku’s healing quirk, and that it will keep him stable long enough to get to an actual hospital.

 

Shouta wants to kill him. The monster is still kneeling there with a smile on his face, and there’s nothing Shouta can do about it. The only thing Shouta can do is whisper, “You’re gonna be okay,” and mean it. He can brush Izuku’s bangs off his sweat-soaked forehead and whisper, “It’s gonna be okay,” because it has to be.

 

Movement catches Shouta’s attention; his eyes lock on Detective Tsukauchi as he walks through the ruins, so slow that each step echoes clearly, every centimeter marked by the crunching of rubble. Tsukauchi’s face is blank but sweat drips down his forehead. His face is blank but he trips over a rock and nearly falls over. His face is blank, but he must be absolutely petrified as he carries a pair of quirk-suppressing handcuffs—Shouta recognizes them as the newest model, still in the testing phase, not yet legally certified for humane use. Tsukauchi walks slowly through the ruins, up to All for One.

 

The closer Tsukauchi gets the faster Shouta’s heart beats, and he holds Izuku a little closer, as if that’ll protect him from the villain. Tsukauchi similarly speeds up, like he wants to get this over with, like he’s afraid—understandably—that there’s a time limit, and if he doesn’t make it this spell will end.

 

But as Tsukauchi walks up, nothing happens. All for One doesn’t react, he just keeps kneeling there on the debris, smiling. Like he’s won.

 

Tsukauchi pauses right in front of the man, and says with a shaky voice, “You are being arrested.” He sounds so small, looks so small, next to All for One, even though the villain’s on his knees.

 

All for One simply holds out his hands and keeps fucking smiling.

 

Tsukauchi doesn’t say any of the other things he’s supposed to say, and instead starts to put the handcuffs on All for One’s wrists.

 

The man does not resist, but Shouta holds his breath until the cuffs snap shut.

 

Then, everything seems to happen all at once. A horde of heroes floods the area—led by Endeavor—swarming All for One, guiding him toward a heavily armored black van.

 

Shouta wants to be there. He wants to see All for One get locked up for eternity with his own two eyes—but right now, all he needs to look at is what’s directly in front of him. He lightly taps Izuku’s cheek to make sure he’s still awake, then whispers, “I got you,” before picking him up.

 

After a second of hesitation, Izuku wraps his arms around Shouta’s neck and buries his head in his shoulder. The boy’s fever is only getting worse, and he’s still shivering. Honestly, it’s a miracle he’s still conscious. Shouta won’t ever forget the scream of pure devastation Izuku let out when his father forced the quirks on him.

 

He needs to get Izuku to a hospital.

 

Shouta stands up, turns around, and sees five of his other kids. They’re alive and conscious and right now that’s all that matters. Shinsou’s doing just as bad as he already was, but Todoroki’s got him covered, and the rest are relatively fine—that’ll have to be enough.

 

All Might—Yagi Toshinori—is there, looking skinny and half-dead, being supported by Iida on one side and Yaoyorozu on the other. Shouta makes eye contact with him and All Might simply nods a silent you take it from here.

 

More heroes arrive; it's such a relief to see Hizashi and Nemuri that Shouta almost relaxes, but he doesn’t have that luxury yet. Nemuri asks if he’s okay, Hizashi asks if he can take Izuku, but Shouta just tells them, “Look after the rest of my kids.” They don’t complain, even though it’s obvious they’re worried. Good. If they take care of the rest of 1-A, Shouta can look after Izuku.

 

Two medics in tactical black vests with a red cross on the front carry a small cot up to Shouta, alongside two heavily decked out officers who must be part of a special assault team. One of the officers unclips a set of quirk-suppressing handcuffs from his belt as the other says, “We’ll take it from here,” and reaches forward to grab Izuku.

 

Shouta tightens his grip.

 

The handcuffs—the special assault uniform—we’ll take it from here.

 

Shouta takes an instinctive step back. “I’ll take him to the ambulance,” he says.

 

The officer doesn’t budge. It isn’t supposed to go like this.

 

If the officer keeps looking at Izuku like he’s All for One himself, Shouta’s going to become violent.

 

But instead Shouta states, through gritted teeth and with as much authority as he can muster, “I am the pro-hero Eraserhead and I am going to carry him to the ambulance. You may escort us there.”

 

After a moment, the officer says, “Fine,” and, alongside the two medics, guides Shouta away. He glances back once more to make eye contact with Hizashi and Nemuri and mouth I love you before he’s walked to the nearest ambulance. The medics step in first and secure the cot inside the van, while both officers stand on either side of Shouta.

 

It’s going to be okay.

 

Shouta steps up into the ambulance, and tells Izuku in a quiet, soft voice, “We’re in the ambulance. I’m going to put you down on the bed.” But before he can Izuku shakes his head against Shouta’s shoulder and whispers, “I’m scared.”

 

Shouta’s heart leaps into his throat. He instinctively turns back, to take a scan of the Kamino ruins, but nothing looks amiss. In the distance, he watches as Endeavor tosses All for One into the back of the armored van and steps in, closing the door behind them.

 

“They’re just going to take us to the hospital,” Shouta says. “They’re going to help you.”

 

But Izuku shakes his head again. “I want to go back to UA.” His voice is so quiet, so vulnerable, so broken. It’s quiet, but Izuku’s crying. “I want to go back to 1-A.”

 

“You will,” Shouta says, as he watches one of the medics fill a syringe. “I promise. You will go back to UA. You’ll be back in 1-A as soon as possible.” This time, Shouta makes eye contact with the medic as he threatens, “I promise.”

 

After a moment, Izuku’s grip on his neck relaxes enough for Shouta to gently deposit him onto the cot, and the medic says, “I’m going to give you some decasartyphiol. It’s a quirk suppressant. It should make you feel better.” Izuku doesn’t complain as the medic injects the drug into his arm.

 

“Sir,” one of the officers says, “We’ll take it from here.”

 

“No you won’t,” Shouta says, and he walks as far back into the ambulance as he can. There isn’t a lot of space, but he makes it an extra half foot from the exit.

 

“Only a legal guardian is allowed in the ambulance. You have to step out so we can take him to Tartarus.”

 

“To where? ” Shouta asks, voice louder than he wanted it to get with Izuku right there.

 

They can’t be serious. They’re talking about Midoriya Izuku. In Tartarus?

 

“The second floor is a hospital,” the officer says, “for individuals with... dangerous quirks.”

 

The officer is right. The first few floors of Tartarus—those closest to the surface—are separate from the prison. They simply use the same name and basic security infrastructure.

 

“I’m going,” Shouta says. He isn’t going to leave Izuku. Not like this—not after what happened.

 

The officer repeats, “Only a legal—”

 

Shouta interrupts, in his hero voice, “UA takes temporary legal guardianship of their students via a staff member proxy. That’s me. Principal Nedzu will fax over the necessary documents by the time we reach location. If you stall us any longer you are placing a minor’s life at risk and we will not hesitate to pursue legal action. If you know anything about this world, you know you do not want to be on the other side of Nedzu in a fucking court of law.”

 

After a moment, the officers close the door, and Shouta immediately grabs one of Izuku’s hands. “It’s going to be okay,” he says again. “The doctors are going to help you, and when you’re all better we’ll go right back to UA. I promise.”

 

Izuku looks up and tries to smile and says, “Thank you,” before finally passing out.

 

- - -

 

Tomura looks so lost as the heroes swarm his sensei.

 

He’s utterly adorable.

 

Behind them. Mr. Compress and Kurogiri are facilitating the withdrawal. Most of The League have this curse called common sense, so they don’t hesitate to turn tail and run when the heroes start heading toward them.

 

But Tomura? Tomura just stands there, staring at the space his sensei used to be.

 

And in turn, Himiko stares at him with a hungry smile on her face.

 

Dabi says, “I’m going,” except he doesn’t go. He continues standing next to Tomura. He waits.

 

Maybe Dabi likes the look in Tomura’s eyes, too: blank, like he’s completely out of tears to cry, like there’s nothing left inside him.

 

They should go. Himiko can hear the heroes getting closer, but she doesn’t want to ruin the moment. She doesn’t want to ruin Tomura’s moment, so she nudges Dabi with the tip of her knife (he dodges, boo). Himiko whispers, “Just give us a sec, babe.”

 

Dabi lets out a soft groan and—instead of giving them a sec, babe—he grabs Tomura’s upper arm.

 

 

 

Tomura screams

 

and—aw—the spell is broken.

 

But Himiko has to admit, this look isn’t bad either—Tomura’s face scrunched up in pure, beautiful rage—teeth bared and lips snarled, like an animal.

 

“Let go,” Tomura growls as he wrenches his arm away, but Dabi—hot, sexy Dabi—doesn’t budge. He only tightens his grip on Tomura’s arm.

 

Himiko’s never shipped them together more than she does now, and she finds herself licking her lips instinctively.

 

Tomura’s responding anger is sexy, but now Himiko can see what’s underneath—she’s primed for it, like a tiger on the scent trail. She knows it’s there, so now she can find it easily. Underneath his rage, Tomura’s afraid. It takes Himiko a second to recognize what of, but Tomura’s glare is directed at Dabi’s hand—the one on his arm—and Himiko pounces.

 

She wraps herself around Tomura’s other arm and says something she’s been wanting to try ever since Izuku said it. Himiko whines, “Tomura-senpai,” elongating each syllable as much as she can, milking it. Himiko looks up into Tomura’s eyes, pushes herself up onto her tippy-toes so she can get an extra inch closer—close enough that she can tell Tomura’s no longer hiding his fear. It’s staring directly out of his wide eyes.

 

Himiko continues, batting her eyelashes, “It isn’t safe here, Tomura-senpai.” She smiles wide, “Let’s go.”

 

Dabi looks at her with narrowed eyes, not trying to hide his disgust and disappointment. Joke’s on him: people being disgusted with her just turns her on. So Himiko shoves more of her body against Tomura’s side, tries to maximize their contact.

 

And it works. It has the exact reaction Himiko was hoping for, and this is the final proof she needed for her theory, because Tomura chips—breaks just a little bit more.

 

You see, there was something Himiko realized when she saw Tomura fall apart in the arms of his sensei, when he flinched away from Dabi’s hand.

 

Most people break with violence. Most people go more insane the more pressure they’re under. Most people shatter with pain and hurt, with despair and trauma.

 

But not Tomura.

 

Oh, no—not Tomura.

 

And Himiko is so fucking excited—so hot and bothered.

 

Tomura is already violence. Tomura is already insane. Tomura’s already spent his entire life under immense pressure, in pain, despair, and trauma.

 

He’s already at the bottom of the barrel.

 

Now there’s only one direction left. The only place for Tomura to go from here… is up.

 

Tomura will break with softness. Tomura will break with kindness. Tomura will break with love.

 

And it will be glorious. And hot. And Himiko will be there, holding one end of the rope, dragging him up by force—whether he wants it or not. Breaking him down until there’s nothing left but something that is loved, that feels compassion, something that can regret.

 

Himiko sees it in Tomura’s eyes.

 

If this is going to work, Himiko’s gonna have to mean it. No ulterior motives, only kindness. To make this work, she’s gonna have to channel Izuku. She’s going to need his help.

 

But not yet.

 

Right now, Himiko is staring up into Tomura’s eyes so she says, as softly as she can, as sweetly as she can, “You’re gonna be okay, Tomura.”

 

Tomura freezes in shock, in fear.

 

Has anyone—other than his sensei—ever told him that? Has anyone ever meant it before?

 

Himiko means it. Himiko will do anything to make it the truth.

 

This time, Tomura does not resist as she and Dabi drag him through Kurogiri’s portal, landing in some run-down, empty warehouse Himiko’s never seen before, but is hopefully far, far away from Kamino.

Katsuki sits on the couch in his living room, in front of the television, without moving, breathing, or thinking. All he can do is watch, from miles away, as his entire world falls apart—shatters like he wishes the glass screen of the television would. His father’s been in the kitchen making dinner, so he hasn’t heard the news yet.

 

Not like Katsuki could tell him what the news is.

 

Because he thinks if he opens his mouth he might throw up. If he moves a single inch his quirk might explode and take him with it. If his father steps into the room he might—God forbid—cry.

 

Katsuki recognizes the villain under the helmet. Even if he hadn’t, the news feed picks up enough of what’s said at Kamino for him to understand what’s going on. Unfortunately.

 

It makes Katsuki feel sick, but he can bear it as long as he doesn’t think about it too hard—as long as he doesn’t think about who’s who and what this means and how long he’s—that they were—are—his neighbors—and—

 

From the blindspot behind him, Katsuki’s dad says, “Isn’t that Midoriya Hisashi?”

 

The television screen shatters—Katsuki shatters it. He can’t see any more. He can’t think about it. He needs to go. Get out of here, get out of this neighborhood where—

 

His dad wraps him in a hug. Katsuki tries to resist it, but he never can. “Katsuki, what’s wrong?” 

 

Katsuki says, “It was all a lie,” and what his dad hears is Hisashi’s always been a villain, but Katsuki means I’ve been wrong this whole time. He isn’t sure how yet, but there are two possible realities.

 

One: Izuku’s known, this whole time, that his father’s a villain. He’s been complicit. Izuku’s been a villain this whole time and Katsuki didn’t once notice. 

 

Would that make Katsuki complicit, too? Shouldn’t he have noticed? Couldn’t he have done something, then, to prevent all this terror from happening? Told someone, at least? Or even if he couldn’t—because Izuku had already won—at least Katsuki wouldn’t have felt guilt for all these years. Katsuki never stood a chance. He never did. Even if he’d tried, how could he defeat a 200 year old villain and his perfect son with ten quirks or whatever the fuck? At least Katsuki could have relaxed, then.

 

Or, even worse, two: Izuku didn’t know. And for fifteen years there’s been a villain next door, who’s cooked Katsuki dinner before and babysat him and tutored him. It’s been years since Katsuki spent any real time with the man, but when he was younger he and Izuku would have play dates all the time, with a villain. And Izuku never knew, which means Katsuki could’ve been trying this whole time. 

 

Izuku hasn’t ever been perfect. Izuku’s always been losing—to his father—this whole time. And Katsuki… Katsuki stood a chance.

 

Either way, Katsuki’s been living a lie this whole time.

 

He just doesn’t know which lie it is.

 

But his father says, “It’s all gonna be okay. You don’t have to worry. Izuku’s gonna be okay.”

 

And Katsuki decides, even if he doesn’t believe it, that it’s the first one.

 

Because that’s the only way he’ll be able to live with himself, even if he doesn’t believe it.

 

- - -

 

Nedzu, very abruptly, has a lot of paperwork to do. He’s not mad about it. In fact, Nedzu finds filing paperwork rather relaxing, as it requires very little of his brain power, allowing him to multitask very efficiently.

 

For instance, as Nedzu signs the form to formally declare Aizawa Shouta the representative of UA in terms of Midoriya Izuku’s legal guardianship, he replays the Kamino incident in his head (and on one of his six monitors). It had taken him exactly eighty-nine seconds to find an intelligible video feed of the Kamino attack after All for One’s initial entrance, which is when he finally figured out the identity of Midoriya’s father.

 

Nedzu had previously considered, though for only approximately two and a half seconds, that Midoriya’s father could be All for One. Nedzu’s biggest regret is that such a consideration didn’t last half a second longer, for if it had, perhaps he would have figured everything out before having the answer spoon-fed to him.

 

This is, perhaps, the biggest embarrassment of Nedzu’s career since being locked up and experimented on like an animal.

 

It’s frustrating, and if he were a less intellectual being, he might have devoted the next few minutes to pondering what would have happened if he did figure it all out on his own, say, a week ago, or even earlier. But Nedzu does not care for hypothetical pasts, so he faxes the necessary forms to the second floor of Tartarus and returns to the public statement he has to compose within the next thirteen minutes.

 

Nedzu is always careful, but he is especially aware of how intentional he must be with this statement in particular, considering the precarious position in which Midoriya Izuku now finds himself. Because it is not just the heroes, 1-A students, police officers, medics, and unlucky few civilians who witnessed the Kamino incident first-hand who now know the identity of Midoriya Hisashi. No, the last few minutes of the incident were aired live on national television, and instantly went viral, so it is the better part of Japan—and a significant percentage of the entire world—who know that Izuku’s father is a villain.

 

And they will all have their own opinions about it.

 

And Nedzu will be the first person to speak publicly about the incident to the nation of Japan. He will be the one to address these opinions before they go too far, before they get out of hand. Because Nedzu understands the Japanese populace terribly well—well enough to know that, left to their own devices, they will demonize Izuku as if he were All for One himself.

 

While Nedzu is, on an intellectual level, curious to see how that would impact Izuku and Class 1-A, he recognizes that this is objectively not what he should allow to happen. It is Nedzu’s responsibility to protect his students, and thusly he is writing this public statement with six primary goals:

    To mitigate public panic following the defeat and deflation of All Might.
    To mitigate public panic following the reveal of All for One as a 200 year old villain who can give and take quirks.
    To re-emphasize the security of Tartarus as a prison.
    To re-emphasize the safety of UA by announcing that the hero classes of 1-A and 1-B will be moving into dorms as soon as possible.
    To inform the public that all UA students are—or likely will be—fine, without lying (Nedzu has to continuously remind himself of that one).
    To declare, unequivocally, that Midoriya Izuku is an innocent child who was not at all involved with the dealings of his father, and that he is and will remain a hero student at UA.

 

Nedzu has been granted a ten minute segment to accomplish these objectives. It would be more than enough time, except for the fact that his last bullet point will require at least four sub-bullet points to address the most likely and dangerous reactions he suspects the public will have. He is Nedzu, however, so he will be able to say everything in eight minutes and twenty three seconds, leaving approximately a minute and a half for precisely two questions.

 

After completing his outline for the public statement, Nedzu begins his next most important project.

 

After all, Nedzu designed the security for Tartarus. He understands how it functions, intimately, so he knows exactly what it means for Midoriya Izuku to have been admitted to the second floor.

 

The second floor is a hospital, and it is completely closed off from the prison floors. Legally, it is unrelated to the Tartarus Prison. However, it is more secure than any Japanese prison or bank, with security beaten only by the lower prison floors. This means that, while the first four floors of Tartarus—one: entrance and screening, two: hospital, three: short-term and long-term housing, four: storage—are not technically prison floors, that is, in reality, how they function.

 

This means that Midoriya Izuku being admitted to the second floor is, to put it in modern terms: a red flag. More often than not, those admitted to the second floor never come back up to the surface, and instead are moved one floor down to housing.

 

For a large number of reasons that Nedzu does not feel necessary to list, Midoriya Izuku will return to the surface. Nedzu will assure it. Such is the letter he is drafting right now to the Prime Minister and the Minister of National Security, both of whom are directly in charge of Tartarus.

 

This letter, in combination with his public statement arranged to occur in ten minutes and forty-six seconds, has a 71% chance of successfully ensuring Midoriya’s future release from Tartarus. Most likely, Nedzu will next have to meet with them both face-to-face and leverage the blackmail he’s been saving for a special occasion.

 

No matter what, Nedzu will stop at nothing to ensure Midoriya is not trapped down there any longer than he has to be.

Shinsou’s hospital room is cold. Ochako can’t tell if it’s the AC or Todoroki or a combination of the two. Either way, she sits in the corner chair, bouncing her legs up and down while Iida paces. He likes to keep moving when he’s stressed. And right now, he paces back and forth and back and forth across the short perimeter of the hospital room. Barely six steps either direction. It makes her dizzy to watch, but it’s also comforting in the same way watching the ocean is.

 

In the chair next to Ochako, Yaoyorozu keeps fidgeting with her quirk—she creates a paper clip, unwraps it with her fingers and throws it out, then creates another paper clip, unwraps it, and throws it out.

 

On the other hand, Todoroki stands perfectly still in the opposite corner, staring at nothing in particular, barely breathing. Shinsou lies on the hospital bed, doing something on his phone.

 

The silence is suffocating and lasts too long. Izuku never would have let it last this long. Ochako wants to say something but the only thing she can think of is the truth, so she whispers, “Nothing will ever be the same again.”

 

Iida stops pacing and Yaoyorozu pauses unwrapping a paper clip.

 

“Not for us,” she continues, “but especially... not for Izuku.”

 

She swallows down her anxiety. At everyone’s silence, she asks the question that’s been gnawing away at her sanity. “Are they even gonna let him back in UA after all this?”

 

“If they don’t, I’ll drop out. Without hesitation,” Shinsou says. “But Nedzu did just declare Izuku’s innocence.” He shows them all his phone screen which displays the headline: Principal of UA’s Statement Regarding the Kamino Incident. “And that Izuku will be rejoining UA as soon as he can.”

 

Ochako lets out a breath and allows herself to smile. “Thank god.”

 

“It doesn’t matter,” Todoroki says, suddenly, the first thing he’s said since Kamino.

 

They stare at him in confusion until Iida asks, “What doesn’t matter?”

 

“That nothing will be the same,” Todoroki answers, and, after a few quiet seconds, adds, “Because no matter what, we’re Izuku’s best friends.”

Enji is furious as he escorts All for One through Tartarus. The elevator ride is long and silent and only gets colder the deeper down they go, so as the counter ticks up (in meters instead of floors since the prison is nearly 2 miles deep), he similarly raises the temperature of his quirk.

 

The four Tartarus guards, each hand-picked for their quirklessness, do a subpar job at hiding their discomfort. It’s only them, the Number Two—no, he’s technically, god fucking damnnit this is so stupid—the Number One Hero, and All for One. It would be weirder if they weren’t afraid, but fuck, they’re goddamn professionals—they should at least be able to hide it. Enji growls. The altitude counter hits negative 2000 meters. Next to him, All for One stands perfectly still. He’s contained in every single security measure Tartarus had on-hand, from the experimental quirk-suppressing handcuffs to a full-body straitjacket to a gag to chains tying his limbs down to the metal gurney he’s propped up on.

 

For some reason, none of it makes Enji feel any safer, so he tests out his quirk, fans the flames off each of his shoulders. All for One doesn’t react, though he isn’t really in a position to, but the four guards each flinch.

 

Fucking amateurs.

 

The elevator slows down as it approaches 3000, then smoothly clicks to a stop. Thank god. Enji just wants to get this over with so he can go punch All Might in the face and get some fucking answers. And figure out where the hell he’s going to go from here, since nothing’s ever gonna be the same after All Might deflated on live TV. Where does that leave Enji? If that’s it for All Might, he’s gonna be fucking pissed.

 

But right now Enji has to spend his valuable time escorting this All for One bastard through the surprisingly well-lit halls of Tartarus to a solitary cell, where a different set of guards—these ones actually capable of acting professional—triple-check the restraints before securing All for One—gurney and all—to the floor and ceiling, right in the middle of his cell. The cell is contained within at least a foot of concrete, with a single window made out of the strongest glass to allow guards and visitors—not that he’ll be getting any visitors other than Enji and an interrogator or two—line-of-sight. Entrance to the cell is only accessible by first passing through two separate doors with independent security measures that change every hour—or so one of the guards tells him.

 

All for One looks no smaller in the cell than he did in the center of Kamino, despite being indisputably trapped. It doesn’t matter how many quirks the man has, because they’re being suppressed in at least three different ways: handcuffs, drugs that will be injected into his bloodstream at least once a day, and a gas that will fill the room as-needed.

 

Not even Enji would be able to escape from that cell. All for One is, objectively and unequivocally, trapped.

 

And yet.

 

“Call me before his next injection,” Enji orders no one in particular. “And don’t let anyone interrogate him without me here.”

 

All for One can’t move an inch. He can’t even smile, let alone speak. This is his end. He doesn’t pose a threat anymore. He’s utterly trapped.

 

And yet, Enji can’t deny a sense of foreboding. As he steps back into the elevator, as the doors close and leave All for One two miles underground in a concrete box—all the air in Enji’s lungs is replaced with dread.

 

Because Enji can’t help but feel like two miles underground in Tartarus is exactly where All for One wants to be.

The second floor of Tartarus is not at all what Shouta was expecting. It looks like a perfectly normal hospital, just with infinitely more security and fewer windows. But after his paperwork clears (apparently Nedzu did fax over everything Shouta needed), they strip him of anything that could potentially be a weapon—aka everything on his person except for his clothes and his phone, which doesn’t have any service down here anyway—and they give him a wristband to track his location that he can’t take off without some special tool. Only then do they allow Shouta to accompany Izuku to his hospital room. 

 

A doctor does a quick checkup and tells them what they already knew: Izuku’s body, mind, immune system, and quirk factor are all in hyperdrive trying to adjust to the physical trauma of receiving four quirks at once and—as is left unsaid—the mental trauma of finding out his father is a 200-year old supervillain.

 

Shouta spends the whole time sitting right next to Izuku’s bed, holding his hand.

 

The doctor’s impressed—and simultaneously concerned—that Izuku’s still conscious, considering his fever and incredibly high heart rate. Since he doesn’t have an actual injury, and the only thing physically wrong is an overextension of his quirk factor and brain, there’s nothing the doctor can do except try to treat the side effects with pain medication, beta blockers, and fever reducers, a cocktail they inject through an IV.

 

After the doctor leaves, with promises that a nurse will check in on them soon, Izuku whispers, “I don’t like hospitals.”

 

“I hear you,” Shouta says. “And I’m so sorry you have to be here.”

 

“They remind me of—” Shouta can almost hear the home that sits in the air, silent. “—my father.”

 

“You’re safe now,” Shouta says. “Don’t forget what the guard said.” Shouta grips Izuku’s hand a little tighter. “You’re safe now. Your—he’s two miles underground, locked in a cell of concrete. He’s officially trapped down there, for good. He can’t hurt you anymore. You’re safe.”

 

“I don’t—” Izuku’s face scrunches up in pain.

 

Where the fuck is the nurse? Shouta mashes the button to summon one again. These painkillers are wearing off way too fast. The doctor said this sometimes happens with healing quirks—sometimes the quirks can fight off the sedatives, too. Which means they might have to try something stronger, something strong enough that Izuku’s healing quirk can’t counteract it.

 

“I’m still scared,” Izuku says, instead.

 

“It’s okay to be scared,” Shouta tells him. “How’s the pain?”

 

Izuku turns away, which is a big red flag. “I’m fine,” he says, but after a second, more quietly, “I feel like I’m falling apart from the inside.”

 

A nurse finally steps into the room, but shortly after she does the machines start beeping frantically, and Shouta knows enough to recognize that Izuku’s heart rate is only increasing, and that it should not be that high.

 

The nurse fiddles with Izuku’s IV and double checks the machines.

 

“What’s going on?” Shouta asks as the doctor walks in.

 

Instead of answering, the doctor looks at Izuku and asks, “On a scale of 1 to 10, how’s your pain?”

 

After a moment, Izuku says, “Eight,” and Shouta immediately adds, “Double that.”

 

The doctor nods, then whispers something to the nurse, who scurries off.

 

“Considering Midoriya-kun’s symptoms are only worsening, despite medication, I suggest we induce a coma.”

 

“Is that safe?” Shouta asks.

 

“Yes,” the doctor answers, without hesitation. “It is a relatively routine procedure. We often induce comas in patients who develop quirks that their body has challenges adjusting to. Taking into account Midoriya’s powerful healing quirk, I have no serious concerns. It should allow his body to adjust and heal safely.”

 

Shouta opens his mouth to ask another question, but Izuku interrupts with, “Let’s do it. My regeneration quirk thinks it will work.”

 

Shouta would like to figure out whatever the hell that means, but he’ll save it for another day. For now he stares at the doctor, and feels like a dad for the first time in his life.

 

He doesn’t like it, but it makes sense. This will be the best way for Izuku to get better, so he turns back to the boy and brushes the bangs off his forehead. “You’re going to be alright, Izuku,” Shouta insists. He’ll say it as many times as he has to.

 

But, unexpectedly, Izuku smiles at him and says, “I know. You’re gonna stay here. The whole time. I trust you, Aizawa-sensei.”

 

“No matter what,” Shouta says. “You’re gonna be okay.”

 

Izuku smiles as the doctor puts him under.

Tomura vaguely recognizes the warehouse as one of the many properties Sensei owns across Japan. He isn’t sure exactly where this one is located, but he doesn’t care.

 

Tomura shoves Dabi and Toga away, then collapses against a large box nearby—half-leans against it and digs his fingernails into the soft wood.

 

This isn’t how it was supposed to go, and he knows exactly why.

 

“This is all that brat’s fault,” Tomura growls.

 

“Which brat?” Mr. Compress asks.

 

The rest of the party is spread out, in varying states of shock and confusion. Mr. Compress looks composed, comparatively, but he does temporarily take off his mask to wipe the sweat off his brow before continuing, “If I recall, there were quite a few.”

 

Ugh. Compress really needs to work on that condescension if he doesn’t want Tomura to fucking rip off his face one day.

 

“Midorya,” Tomura spits out, and just saying the name makes his quirk start eating away at the wood. But Tomura still feels like he has to say it. “Izuku.”

 

This is all his fault. Fuck. If that fucking OP roadblock brat didn’t exist then everything would have been fine. Then everything would be fine. Instead—shit—instead now Tomura has to prove he deserves to be Sensei’s successor? Like that isn’t how he’s spent the past sixteen years of his fucking life? He has to compete with some fifteen-year-old hero brat?

 

Fine.

 

Whatever.

 

Then there’s one easy solution to this. One way to win automatically.

 

All Tomura has to do is kill—

 

Toga interrupts, with a wide smile and a dangerous glint in her eyes, “You mean your brother?”

 

 

 

Tomura screams. Launches himself at her, hands forward, palms out. Toga dodges, devolves into a playful laughter that just pisses Tomura off even more. She pulls out a knife—that’s better. Tomura would much rather Toga wield a knife at him than ever call Izuku his—

 

But that’s what Sensei said—

 

Brothers.

 

Tomura tries to grab onto Toga—anything he can get five fingers on—but she’s always just out of reach.

 

He can’t. If they’re brothers—because if—

 

Toga blocks Tomura’s arm with the knife and—and it doesn’t hurt. That bitch—she’s using a fucking dull knife so Tomura growls at her but Toga just licks her lips and—

 

Tomura can’t call Izuku his brother because they’re on opposite sides. Because Tomura wants to kill him. Because if Tomura accepts that—that he and Izuku—that they—that Sensei—

 

Tomura manages to get four fingers around one of Toga’s messy buns, drags her face up to his. She only giggles as he hisses, “How dare you.” Then he chucks her into the wooden crate, and it finally falls apart under her.

 

The warehouse settles into silence, so Tomura glares at all the NPCs and bites out, “Who’s next?”

 

After a moment, Dabi steps up, cracking his knuckles. “I’ll go,” he says.

 

Tomura smiles. Good. He’d love to let off more steam. He needs to let more of this anger out.

 

Except footsteps alert them to someone entering the warehouse, and everyone goes alert.

 

 

 

Giran steps forward, says, “Hope I’m not interrupting,” and lights a cigarette.

 

They all relax, except for Tomura, who can’t relax.

 

“You got here fast,” Twice says. “Yeah, I don’t even know where here is.”

 

Giran explains, “All for One told me where to go in case, well, that happened.”

 

“How much do you know?” Tomura hisses.

 

“Not much,” Giran admits with impressive nonchalance, considering the current situation and everything that’s gone down in the past twenty-four hours. “I’m just the messenger.”

 

He takes another huff of his cigarette before holding up a large, metal briefcase. “Shigaraki, All for One meant it. He left all his material assets for you to inherit. You’re about to become the most powerful man in Japan... 

 

“Are you ready?”

 

If they were alone, perhaps Tomura could have answered honestly. He wants to. All he wants right now is to disintegrate Japan into a pile of fucking dust, then sleep for a week.

 

But they aren’t alone, and despite how much Tomura wants to self-destruct, quit the game without saving first, he knows he can’t.

 

And that’s so much worse. If he were just another centimeter too far gone, then he could throw a tantrum. He could succumb to the urge and rip out each strand of hair on his head one by once. He could scream at the top of his lungs and level this stupid warehouse but—

 

But if he did that, all of this would be for nothing. Heroes would show up and his party would disappear and he’d lose the game.

 

Tomura isn’t alone, and the rest of The League is staring at him with expectation, with a little bit of fear, with way too much pity—he’ll work on that—and with respect.

 

Tomura is Sensei’s successor. He is.

 

And Tomura has a future, so he lies:

 

“Of course I’m fucking ready.”
