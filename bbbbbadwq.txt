Summary:

    Izuku Midoriya was born with rabbit ears poking out of his head and wings sprouting from his back.
    This...changes a lot more than one would expect.

    Or: A story in which Izuku is the little sibling of Miruko and Hawks, raised by the Hero Commission, and kind of just wants to be a normal kid.

Chapter 1: Beginnings
Chapter Text

Beginnings

 

“Again,” the handler commands, and so he does. Lunging forwards, Izuku spins through the air, tucking his wings in close before flaring them out, hitting the training dummy before bouncing backwards, landing effortlessly on his feet. His right ear twitches, and then he leaps back, avoiding the real trainer who jumps in close, fists swinging his way. But whenever they get close, he gets farther, ducking and darting out of the way before swooping in close, letting his own kicks finish the match, sending the man flying.

The man who is twice his age, has three times the amount of muscle as him, and was only supposed to be giving him advice . Izuku sneezes, nose twitching. He hates when they do this, but he knows it’s to keep him on his toes. 

“You need to be faster, Midoriya,” his handler admonishes. “Half a second slower, and he would have gotten you.”

Izuku knows. He knows , and his handler doesn’t need to remind him. Luckily, she doesn’t seem inclined to continue lecturing him- she never has said more than she has to, it’s both a blessing and a curse-, instead nodding her head towards not the dummy, but the trainer. 

“Again,” she repeats, and Izuku nods, wings stretching out, ears listening for any sudden noises, and he lunges once more. Over and over, he moves on instruction, moves on instinct, moves on whatever they tell him to move on. He spars with the trainer, the man who he may have learned the name of, once, but no longer recalls, and maybe never did. He spars for the handler, who has never introduced herself since their initial meeting, over ten years ago, back when he was just a little fledgling, with tiny green ears poking through his hair and matching green feathers sprouting from his back. He spars, and spars, and-

“Izuku!” 

He stops, barely remembering to dive out of the trainer’s way before turning to face the entrance. And then he’s perking up, ears twitching and feathers ruffling as he catches sight of his big brother waiting in the doorway- waiting for him !

“Keigo!” Izuku chirps, and Keigo beams at him. 

“Come on, songbird, let’s go get some food. Rumi’s already waiting on us, I bet, and you know she’ll eat everything if we don’t get there in time.”

“Right!” Izuku nods, remembering the last time his sister was left alone with their food. It had only been ten minutes, but that had been enough time for half of his meal to magically ‘disappear’ on him. Izuku won’t make the same mistake twice, no way. He races over to the side of the room, picking up his water before moving to Keigo’s side, and he’s out of the room before his handler can even protest a thing.

“Let’s get out of here,” Keigo whispers as they race through the halls, and the moment they find a window they’re pushing it open and flying. 

The trip is a quick one, which is both a wonderful thing and a disappointing one. Wonderful because Izuku hasn’t seen Rumi in a week , and Keigo a week and a half, but upsetting because he doesn’t get to fly often. Well, he does, but it’s always in closed off training rooms, and never the open skies that make him feel so free .

In no time at all, Izuku is landing on the familiar balcony, Keigo a step before him and already pushing open the unlocked door. The balcony is only used by three people- Keigo, Rumi, and Izuku himself. ‘The colony’s exit’ is what it’s dubbed by Rumi’s coworkers, and the name makes Izuku smile every single time.

It’s something that is theirs and theirs alone, and Izuku likes that. He likes it a lot, having something that he can claim. He can’t claim much, after all. Not when his room belongs to the Commission, his training is run by the Commission, and he is the ward of the Commission. No, Izuku does not possess much, and as such he holds his possessions close to his heart.

Like his notebooks, in which he dissects interesting Quirks and fighting styles, using heroes and villains alike as references and examples. In which he comes up with potential strategies for all sorts of terrain, makes backup plans for completely hypothetical fights that he’s never faced. In which he comes up with ways to use his Quirk, and ways for his siblings to use theirs.

He treasures his Quirk, too, and his body along with it. Because while he belongs to the Commission, while he follows their plans and lessons to the best of his ability, he is still his own. He is still in command of his body, of his entire being from the tips of his fuzzy green ears to his wings and tail and all the way down to his toes. He takes pride in his ability to fly at speeds of sixty miles per hour, takes pride in the way he can leap high and see far. He takes pride in himself, and how he’s able to recreate some of the greatest feats of his siblings.

But Izuku’s greatest possessions aren’t his notes, nor his abilities. It’s not even his intelligence that he treasures most, although that’s been refined by the Commision along with his analysis skills. No, that’s not it.

It’s his siblings. It’s Rumi Usagiyama, Pro Hero Miruko, who gets a thrill from fighting the worst of the worst, who can kick ass with a giant grin and then come home to brag about it. It’s Keigo Takami, Pro Hero Hawks, who’s risen his way to the top, even surpassing their big sister, quicker than anyone has ever seen, but doesn’t let the rankings affect his kindness at home. It’s his siblings, who he’s been raised with for as long as he can remember, the only family he’s ever known. It’s his siblings, who have watched over him and inspired him and encouraged him his entire life. It’s his siblings, his colony, and they are his greatest treasures.

And Izuku will treasure every moment he can get with them, as he can never be sure when he’ll next see them. With three hectic schedules, and two of the three being active Heroes who risk their lives for the people every single day, Izuku can’t assume that he’ll see them the next day, or even the next week. It’s just how life is, and it makes Izuku hold them tighter whenever he can.

Unfortunately, a moment can’t last forever, and a few hours later Izuku is returning to the Commission, Keigo flying beside him. The sun is setting in the sky, a sign that he’s been gone for far too long, and Izuku sighs as he lands on his balcony, waving goodbye to his brother before heading into his room.

The room is not empty, his handler waiting patiently at his desk chair.

“Welcome back,” she says, not unkindly but also not kindly either. “Did you enjoy yourself?”

The question should be nice, but the way she says it- toneless, as if out of nothing but obligation- makes Izuku wither, wings curling around him like a blanket, or perhaps a shield.

“I did,” Izuku says. “We compared how far I’ve progressed to how quickly they had. I’m moving along at a faster rate.”

They had discussed this...for a total of three minutes, but the statement is still true. At the very least, this answer makes his handler nod, accepting his sudden leave.

“We have been tracking your progress,” his handler starts, her tone indicating nothing. “And we’ve noticed that your progress, while still good, is no longer at the same rate as it used to be. You have slowed down, Midoriya, on the physical portion of your training.”

She glances up at him, as if she thinks he will answer. Izuku knows better, and she knows this.

His old habits of talking back have been gone for years. It only upset people, even when he only wanted to respond or explain himself, and so Izuku has completely forgone it. It’s easier for everyone, this way.

After all, no one cares why he made a mistake, only that he did and that he needs to correct it. Izuku understands this, accepts this, and has adapted to this. 

The pause only lasts two and a half seconds before she continues. “We’ve decided to alter your training schedule, giving it a complete overhaul.”

Izuku feels his ear flicking, curiosity flooding through him. He wants to know what the changes are.

He doesn’t expect the answer.

“We’ve decided to send you to a hero school. You’ve shown to improve immensely whenever allowed outdoors, and seem to benefit from working with your siblings. As such, we’re going to have you focus on training at school on weekdays, with weekends for training here. Additional lessons on weekdays will be added as we deem necessary, and will most likely occur at least once a week. We will measure how quickly you improve, and if we see you are progressing more quickly with this method, we will continue to use it. Failure to improve at an adequate rate will lead to your removal, and we will find a new method to replace it.”

A...hero school? With new teachers, and students his age , and set lesson times and plans?

“Like Rumi?” Izuku asks, and his handler nods.

“Like Miruko did,” she agrees. “Although you will have more training with the Commission than she ever did.”

Rumi has told stories about hero school- about having fun and friends and looking forwards to what was to come. Keigo never had that, always focused on nothing but improving, on making his way to Pro Hero status quickly so that he could help others.

And now...now, Izuku will have both. Both origins, just like he has a mix of both of their Quirks. 

The idea is exhilarating , and Izuku can’t help but flutter as he asks, “Which school will I be applying to?”

“Yuuei,” is the automatic response, and then, “You will be taking the Recommendation Exam in three days.”

It looks like Izuku has some preparing to do, but he can’t help but look forward to it as his handler exits the room, leaving the boy alone with his thoughts. 

A hero school. 

A school . It sounds so normal, a chance to be young and childish . 

Izuku knows that the year will be one he won’t forget, and he can’t wait for it to start.

And it all starts at Yuuei.
Chapter 2: The Recommendation Exam
Notes:

(See the end of the chapter for notes.)
Chapter Text

The Recommendation Exam

 

Three days pass quickly, and Izuku finds himself standing before Yuuei’s gates before he knows it. He cannot help but take a moment to admire the layout before him, eyes roaming over the large building and endless stretch of campus before him. He’s heard about Yuuei, in passing and in the news, with its glory and prestige. It’s known as the best hero school in all of Japan, the alma mater to heroes such as the Symbol of Peace, All Might.

And according to his handlers, Izuku will be next. He just has to pass their exam and impress the teachers.

For a second, Izuku wonders what will happen if he fails the Recommendation Exam. Will the handlers have him take the normal exam? Will they send him to a different school, applying and applying until he succeeds? Or will they retract their kind offer and continue to train him on their own?

He doesn’t want to risk losing his chance to go to a school. He has to pass this exam, no matter what. 

With this thought in mind, Izuku passes through the gates. He wanders in, quickly spotting another person. With blond hair that sticks up in an odd, swooping curve, and an odd gadget around his neck, it’s obvious that the man is a Pro Hero- and as such, a teacher here at Yuuei.

“Well good morning, little listener!” The man cheers as Izuku approaches, and the phrase sounds rather familiar. 

“Good morning,” Izuku responds politely, and the man’s grin grows.

“You’re here for the Recommendation Exam, yeah?” When Izuku nods, the man claps and continues on. “Great! I’ll lead you to the testing room- you’re going to be doing the written test first, and then the fun happens after!”

What, exactly, ‘the fun’ stands for, Izuku doesn’t know. All that he knows for sure is that the Recommendation test takers will have to beat some sort of...challenge? Test? Something has to be beaten. It’s different from the normal Entrance Exam, where students apparently fight robots, but how different it is, Izuku isn’t sure. 

As they walk, the hero continues to talk, asking him questions like, “So what brought you to Yuuei?” 

To which Izuku easily responds, “A car.” 

He had, after all, been driven to the school- his handler said he could not afford to be late, so Izuku sat with his wings awkwardly curled around him, sitting upright so that the back of the seat wouldn’t irritate the feathers. Honestly, Izuku would have rather sprinted the entire way there- he’d be less uncomfortable in the end.

The hero seems to like this answer, or at least finds it funny, because he laughs. Izuku likes the man’s laugh, it’s loud and unashamed, like Rumi’s. 

“Good one, listener,” the hero says, and the nickname- the one the blond has used twice already- confuses Izuku.

“Why-” He cuts himself off immediately, snapping his mouth shut with a flustered squeak. It’s not polite to question this man on his choice of nicknames, however bizarre they may be.

Or maybe it’s okay , because the man turns to him and urges him to speak up, asking, “What were you saying, little listener?”

Hearing it a third time is enough to make Izuku ask, “Why do you keep calling me that?” A second of pause, and then, “I- I just mean, of course I’m listening? Do people normally not listen to you, sir? Because that’s...that’s not very kind.” Izuku doesn’t like it when people purposely ignore him , after all, so why would someone ignore this nice man?

The man looks at him oddly, then lets out another laugh, although this one is more muted. Izuku doesn’t know if he likes that. “Sorry, little lis- little buddy, it’s a habit of mine.”

“Oh!” That makes sense. “Is… is it part of your hero persona?”

He knows about personas. Knows that Keigo acts a lot more carefree when on the job, knows that Rumi thinks they’re for people who are afraid of showing their true thoughts. Knows that he doesn’t know what he thinks about personas, doesn’t know if he needs one, should want one, or how to even make one. But he knows about them, and as such the question can exist. 

The kind hero smiles at him, nodding his head. “You got it!” He confirms. “I run a radio show, Put Your Hands Up , and I started calling my fans ‘listeners’ because, well, they tune into my talk segments.”

Izuku perks up, finally able to place the man. “Oh! You’re the man with the Voice Quirk! Present Mic, right?”

“That’s me!” The man, Present Mic, answers, and Izuku can’t help but let his wings flutter with excitement. Izuku has listened to the show for years, the man’s voice a pleasant background noise during long hours of training and working out. He’s probably tuned into every show, and found old recordings of the ones he missed- thank kami for podcasts. It’s nice to meet the face behind the voice, although Izuku can’t help but feel embarrassed- it took him far too long to realize who the man is, after all.

Izuku almost wants to ask more questions, because Present Mic seems to enjoy them so Izuku doesn’t think it’d be a bad thing to do so, but before he can speak up, the Voice Hero is clapping him on the shoulder and stopping him in his tracks...right in front of a giant door.

“Here’s your stop, little listener!” Present Mic says. “Good luck on the exams, and I hope to see you in my classes come the new year!”

Watching Present Mic walk away, Izuku hopes so, too. 

His determination to pass the exams rises.

Izuku steps into the classroom, quickly taking in the people in the room. There are nineteen kids, and one open desk left. A few look at him with interest as he moves to the final desk, but most either ignore him or analyze him- sizing him up in their heads, trying to figure out how he’ll act. 

Trying to decide how much of a threat he is.

Izuku isn’t foolish, he did his research. Of the thousands of kids who apply to Yuuei every single year, only forty of them get in. Four of those spots are reserved for Recommendation students, which means that Izuku is competing with at least nineteen others for a spot. Which isn’t quite so bad as being one of the thousands fighting to get one of the remaining thirty-six seats, but this exam is far more focused on strengths, weaknesses, and the like. 

Izuku will have to shine among stars, and he’s not sure how bright he can be. 

Luckily, he doesn’t have much time to worry about standing out, because the written exam starts only a few minutes after his arrival. A teacher comes in- who they are, Izuku has no clue- and soon enough he’s being handed a booklet and is told to begin. 

The written test is easy enough, Izuku thinks. While there were a few questions that were a little odd, and some that Izuku wasn’t sure of his answer on, his years of studying seem to be paying off. He’s the first one done in the room, a fact that makes some students glare at him, and causes one girl to glance at him nervously as she shuts her own booklet a few minutes later. He doesn’t react to these looks, instead facing ahead and staring at the blank chalkboard on the wall, letting the remaining time tick away.

As soon as time is up, the teacher clears their throat and begins to speak. “Alright, everyone, please exit the room and follow Ectoplasm. He’ll be leading you to the locker rooms to change, and afterwards you’ll head to the designated testing grounds. Good luck.” 

Izuku could almost swear that the teacher mutters ‘you’ll need it’, but he chooses to keep silent, not saying a word about it to the other contestants as they follow Ectoplasm to their respective changing rooms, and staying mum as they all head to their testing grounds. It seems that all twenty are going to be in the same area, which is fine, except some of the examinees are still eyeing him oddly and Izuku doesn’t know why . 

Well, it’s not something for Izuku to worry about. No, he should be focusing on his exam. 

“The test will be a three kilometer obstacle course race,” Ectoplasm explains. “You’ll be sectioned off in groups of four or six people. After everyone has gone through the race, you’ll be interviewed by the principal and a few other teachers. You have ten minutes before the practical exam begins, please look to the hologram for when you go, and remember to go beyond.”

When Ectoplasm disappears, off to who knows where, the examinees begin to move. Izuku flutters his wings, flying over the others in order to see when he’ll be up without interrupting the others. After seeing that he’s in the final race, against three other examinees, Izuku lets his feet touch the ground once more.

As soon as he does, a voice reaches his ears.

“You like flying too, huh?” Izuku turns around, head tilting up so that he can make eye contact with the tall male before him. “You’re lucky- I have to use my Quirk to go airborne- and even then I barely get off of the ground!”

“So do I?” Izuku responds. “If I didn’t have my wings, I wouldn’t...I wouldn’t be able to fly, either?”

The brunet pauses, then laughs. “Yeah, I suppose you’re right! But yours has the extra style, you know?”

“Th- thank you,” Izuku responds, adamantly ignoring how his wings flutter from the praise. “What- what’s your Quirk, if you don’t mind me asking?”

Just like Present Mic, it seems that this boy also doesn’t mind questions, because he smiles and cheerfully explains, “Mine is called Whirlwind! I can control the air around me and use it to my advantage. If I get the momentum right, I’m able to fly, but it’s not easy to do on my own.”

“So if you had the right support gear on your costume, you could go flying?” Izuku asks, and the boy perks up.

“Yeah! I could!” He nods his head enthusiastically, almost like he hadn’t thought up the idea yet. “Thanks, man- oh, wait, what is your name?”

“Izuku Midoriya,” he responds automatically. 

“Nice to meet you, Midoriya!” Thumping a hand onto his chest, the brunet introduces himself. “I’m Inasa Yoarashi.”

“Nice to meet you, too,” Izuku responds politely, smiling back at Yoarashi. “I hope that we both do well today.”

“Me, too! You’re a nice one, Midoriya.” Laughing loudly, Yoarashi adds, “And here I was, starting to question if I actually wanted to come here or not- if I got accepted, that is! Some of these people suck , but I guess it’s not everyone, yeah?”

Izuku...supposes that that makes sense? “I haven’t really...talked to anyone else, yet.” He admits awkwardly. “I’m sure that there are plenty of nice people here, though!” There have to be- after all, both of the people Izuku has talked to have been nothing but wonderful.

“I like your optimism! After the tests, come find me! I want to exchange numbers with you.” 

“Oh! Alright!” 

“Great. I’ll-”

“If everyone in the first group could line up at the starting line!” A cheerful voice cuts in, and Izuku perks up when he sees Present Mic, perched up on a looking area that raises up high above them all. “That’d be wonderful! The rest of you, please move out of the way. Thanks!”

“That’s my cue!” Yoarashi says cheerfully. “Wish me luck, Midoriya.”

“Good luck!” He offers immediately, and Yoarashi lets out a cheer before moving to his spot. Izuku slips over to the side with the rest of the group, ending up beside a girl with black hair that’s pulled up into a high ponytail. For a moment, he considers chatting with her...and then wonders if she even wants to talk, or if she’s mentally preparing for her turn, and Izuku doesn’t want to risk messing anyone up so he focuses on himself.

The first race begins, and Izuku watches as a boy with red and white hair quickly speeds ahead of the rest, leaving a trail of ice as he goes. Yoarashi is seconds behind him, and the other four are quick to follow. It only takes a few moments for all six of them to disappear from view.

As the race goes on, Izuku turns his attention to his wings, stretching them out so that they won’t be stiff during his round. It’d be rather foolish of him to go in unprepared, so he’s going to make sure that he’s ready.

The first race ends with Yoarashi taking the lead, sliding over the line a mere second before the ice user can. Izuku perks up when Yoarashi comes over to him, dusty and out of breath but still smiling widely.

“Thanks for the luck!” Yoarashi exclaims, and Izuku nods happily.

“Of course! You did great!”

“And you will, too!”

Boy, Izuku hopes so. He focuses on his stretching as the second round goes on, moving from his wings to the rest of his body. By the time the third round is underway, he’s halfway through his usual leg routine.

He finishes just as Present Mic calls for their attention, and looks up to Yoarashi for some parting words.

“Good luck,” Yoarashi offers, and Izuku will take all the luck the boy can give him.

And when the test begins, he puts it to use, soaring past the competition. 

-----

Momo Yaoyorozu.

Her name is written on the front, marked with Yuuei’s seal, and despite Momo’s need to know her results, she can’t help but stare at the closed envelope.

All she needs to do is open it. Open the envelope, read the contents inside, and she’ll know. It’s probably the very first page. She doesn’t even have to read the entire letter if she’s too impatient, she can just skip to the final line!

She doesn’t want to skip to the final line. She’s too afraid of what it will say. A dreaded ‘we thank you for your time, but…’, one that will be polite but condemning, a sign of her failures.

No, Momo needs a moment. A moment to make her best guesses, to go over the day and see where she might land on the cutting board. 

Momo closes her eyes, the memories of the testing day coming back. 

She’d done well on the written exam. She’s almost positive of that. She’d been the second one done in the room, with only that boy with the rabbit ears and bird wings to beat her. That...that had to mean something, right? 

But then again, being the second done doesn’t mean she was the second best score. She might have been third, or fourth, or even the very worst . She knows that she’s studied adequately, that the test only felt moderately difficult to her, but what if the others felt like it wasn’t too hard? What if some of them breezed right through it? The boy who had finished first...he had seen content. Relaxed. Not at all the expression she thinks someone who struggled would have.

Momo shakes her head. She’s getting too hung up on that green-haired boy, which is foolish of her. Although, looking back on it, there were a few others who had seemed rather at peace with their results when closing their books. The green-haired girl, whose Quirk allowed her to split her body into pieces. The boy who could soften things. A girl who could turn her hands into lava.

Momo shoves past these thoughts, moving on to the second portion. The practical exam, an obstacle course three kilometers long. She had been in the fourth round, and had performed to the best of her ability. She had stretched during the ten minute waiting period, and then applied her Quirk as well as she could when the race started.

She had gotten second out of the four of them. The winged rabbit boy had gotten first. Momo wants to brush this off, because, well, the boy had the perfect Quirk for such an exam. Who cares about obstacles when you can fly over them? He didn’t, and Momo had been jealous as she watched the teen soar ahead.

He was already talking to a friend when Momo finally reached the finish line. Somehow, that made everything seem worse.

So he had a more suitable Quirk. So what? The interview had gone well, Momo believes. Principal Nedzu had been intrigued by her Quirk, had been delighted to hear the complexities of it. And since Momo knows nothing of how the other interviews went, she can delude herself into believing that she had stood out- and she must have, because she knows that Nedzu was interested in her Quirk, in her brain, and such a being like Nedzu couldn’t be intrigued by everyone , could he?

No. No, that would be...absurd. 

Right.

Momo takes a deep breath, and opens the envelope.

A small discus falls out. It hits the table, and a hologram flickers to life. Principal Nedzu’s face fills the screen.

The video begins to play.

“Momo Yaoyorozu,” the being’s voice seems to fill the room, and for how cheerful it sounds Momo cannot stop worrying. “I will be brief, as I know many students do not like to be forced through endless, trivial nonsense before hearing the important bits.” He claps his hands together, not making much sound at all, likely due to his fur. “To start, I must say that you’ve impressed me! With a Quirk like yours, it takes an abundance of persistence and dedication to gain a proper handle on your abilities. Here at Yuuei, we strive to find those who will consistently go above and beyond, as is our Plus Ultra nature. I’m pleased to see that you have a similar set of traits, and even more pleased to delve into your results.”

“For the written exam, you scored a remarkable result of ninety-five percent, making you our third best scorer out of all of the applicants.”

Third. Third isn’t...isn’t bad , necessarily. In a competition, it would still earn a medal.

And Principal Nedzu is impressed with her. 

Momo begins to hope.

“For the practical exam, you did well. Out of the twenty examinees, you placed sixth.”

Six out of twenty. Three out of ten. She’s in the top thirty percent. That isn’t the best, but it’s not the worst. Especially when the top five were likely people with Quirks most suited for such an exam.

“And during our interview, you were marked as one of the ten students with the most potential to go pro!” Principal Nedzu chirps, smiling even wider. “So with all of that in mind, I’d like to congratulate you for passing the Recommendation Exam, and making it into Yuuei!”

She passed. Oh kami, she passed . Momo tears up, a hand coming up to cover her open mouth despite the fact that she’s alone in her room. She can’t believe it. She- she made it! She got into Yuuei, she’s going to be in 1-A and-

“We look forward to seeing you in class 1-B!” Nedzu says, cutting off the celebratory cheer in Momo’s head. “Welcome to your hero academia!” With that final line, the hologram disappears, the discus shutting off.

Class 1-B. Not 1-A. 

1-B.

She must have misheard. Clearly. She...she got into Yuuei, how can she not be in 1-A? 

“I’ll just watch it again, and I’ll hear him correctly this time,” Momo murmurs to herself, already clicking the button once more with a shaking hand.

But he says it again. 1-B. 

Accepted, but not enough for 1-A. She’s just barely made it, hasn’t she? 

Momo lets her eyes dart to the holographic screen, gaze fixing on the image presented. Four faces fill the screen, two for 1-A, two for 1-B. The green-haired boy is in 1-A, his smiling face filling her sight. The other two, Momo recalls. A powerful wind Quirk user, and one with ice. Both are strong. All three with amazing Quirks that the world will love. None of them are like her. None of them are like the girl who could split apart her body, or the boy who could soften anything. She’s just barely made it, and she’s the only one.

You are nothing more than an act of inclusion. Something whispers in her mind, venomous and foul, and yet Momo can’t object to it. She took the Recommendation Exam, knowing it would be easier for a Quirk like hers...and yet she still wasn’t at the top. She wasn’t the smartest, nor the strongest, and she has a Quirk that is hard to use. She is the odd one out, closer to a charity case than a true Recommendation student. 

Suddenly, the victory doesn’t feel like one.

-----

“You passed. You will be in class 1-A.” His handler doesn’t bother leading up to the results, simply spelling them out and dropping a pre-opened envelope onto his desk. She turns to walk out of his room, grabbing the door handle, then pauses for a single moment.

“Congratulations for getting the top spot, Midoriya.” And then she’s gone. 

Izuku waits two whole seconds before lunging over to his desk, nearly ripping the envelope in his haste. He ignores the papers, only caring for the little round disc that is clutched in his hands. With an insatiable haste, he taps the button, eyes lighting up as a video begins to play.

“Izuku Midoriya,” the principal greets, and Izuku has to tamp down the urge to greet him in turn. His ears do flick, though, so that counts for something. “Let’s hop right into your results, as I’m sure you’re eager to hear them.”

Oh kami, is he ever. 

“To start, I’m glad to announce that you got a nearly perfect score on the written exam, getting ninety-nine percent on the test. This makes you our highest scorer for the written portion. As for the practical portion, it is unsurprising to say that you also got first, having the fastest time by flying over the entire course.” Izuku giggles as the creature’s smile grows, the mammal adding, “Admittedly, your result has only given a colleague of mine further ammunition to point out ways the exams could be fixed, but change is lovely in certain circumstances, and as such this is not an issue! Finally, there’s your interview to be discussed. From our short talk-” in which Izuku had done his best to not ask too many questions, because Principal Nedzu is exactly that, a principal , and as such likely has less patience for his silly inquiries- “I’ve decided that you were in the top ten examinees with the most potential for growth!”

Oh. That’s really nice of him!

“So with all of that said, congratulations! You, Midoriya, have passed the Recommendation Exam with flying colors, getting first place overall! Welcome to Yuuei, and we look forward to seeing you in 1-A of your hero academia.” 

The screen flickers into nonexistence, and Izuku stares at the wall.

He got into Yuuei.

He got into Yuuei .

He got into Yuuei.

“I’m going to a school,” Izuku realizes, and a burst of joy explodes in his chest.

Izuku lets a smile slip onto his face, and he plays the video again.

-----

‘ We are sorry to announce that you did not meet the forty-five point minimum needed to enter Yuuei’s Hero Course. We wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors, and hope that you will find a new way to reach your full potential.

Best of luck,

Yuuei. ’

Seventeen points. Six more three-pointers would have been enough. Nine more two-pointers would have saved her. Seventeen one-pointers was what she needed.

Her hand clenches, the paper held tightly in her grasp becoming crumpled and warped.

Good.

It...it’s because of the zero-pointer. Because she was stuck under the rubble, and too sick, too scared, to move. Because the robot was coming, and everyone else was fleeing but she couldn’t . 

She could have made it in. She was already halfway to the needed amount. 

But she was trapped. She was trapped and no one came to save her. No one defeated the massive robot, or pulled her out so she could find other bots to defeat. They left her there, until the zero-pointer shut down on its own, standing mere feet from her.

It could have crushed her, had it not had a failsafe program in its code. It could have crushed her, and she would have died , and the other applicants had left her there .

She rubs at her eyes, forcing away the tears that are falling freely. She can’t focus on that. She doesn’t have time to focus on her failures.

She needs to find a new school. 

Most would stay at Yuuei. Most would go into General Education, work their asses off and pray that they can get far enough in the Sports Festival to transfer up. 

But she doesn’t care about the prestige of Yuuei. She cares about becoming a hero , because she needs the job so she can make the money needed to give her parents a nice, comfortable life.

“I hear that Shiketsu is good,” she mutters to herself, pulling up the exam date on her phone. It’s in a week, she has time.

She takes a deep breath, and lets it out slowly. With this single breath, she gathers up all of her disappointment and throws it out, replacing it with a new round of determination.

She will pass Shiketsu’s exams, and she will get into their Hero Course.

And she will become a Rescue Hero, like her idol Thirteen, and she will never leave someone like the Yuuei examinees left her.

Ochako Uraraka takes one last look at her rejection letter...and then she throws it away, leaving a

dream behind, and making a new one.

Chapter Text

The First Day

 

Izuku is forced to take the car to Yuuei again, but he can’t even be upset about it because he’s going to school . School, with teachers and classmates and daily assignments. School, with cafeterias and lockers and desks with chairs that Izuku probably won’t like but won’t complain about either. School, with-

“We’re here,” his driver says. They’re not his handler, but rather a different person. A male, with dull, unalert eyes and a scowl as they press a button, unlocking the backseat doors. “Get out, skvader.”

Some of them only call him that. Skvader. Izuku doesn’t know if it’s because they don’t know his name, much like he never knows theirs...or if it’s because they don’t think he deserves to be more than his Quirk.

Kami knows how most of the Commission will only call Keigo ‘Hawks’. 

Either way, the name doesn’t ruffle Izuku’s feathers nowadays, just another term associated with who he is and who he will become, and so Izuku gets out of the car, black messenger bag slung over his shoulder, and a little bounce in every step. He enters the building, ears perking up to catch the noises. It’s rather quiet, so far, likely because he’s early enough to not earn his teacher’s ire, but late enough that the students here are already at their respective homerooms. Izuku likes it this way, not too overwhelming as he roams the halls until he finally manages to reach class 1-A.

Izuku stares at the massive door, somewhat intimidated by its sheer size...yet also thrilled. It’s larger than life, and for some reason that only boosts Izuku’s spirits more. A smile set on his face, Izuku nods to himself and opens the door.

He’s greeted with harsh voices nearly shouting at each other, and instinctively takes a step back. His ears flicker back, and he can’t help but wrinkle his nose at the noise.

And unfortunately for Izuku, the two boys continue to bicker.

“Keeping your feet on the desk like that- you’re being disrespectful to every hero who has sat here before you!” A blue-haired boy shouts, arm chopping in an odd, robotic motion. The other one, who has blond hair, red eyes, and seems to have completely forgone his tie- lucky him, Izuku’s tie has been bothering him since he put it on- lets out a snort.

“Like anyone cares about their high school desk! Don’t keep such a stick up your ass- or do, it’ll be fun to rip it out of you during training.”

“Such profanity! Do you really want to speak in that manner in such a fine institution like-”

“Institution? The fuck kind of rich kid school did you go to?”

The blue-haired boy takes a deep breath, standing up straight and fixing his glasses before speaking once more. “It appears we have gotten off on the wrong foot. Forgive me. I am Tenya Iida, from Somei Academy.”

“Can’t even stick to your guns, huh?” The blond smirks, leaning back into his seat further as he adds, “And an elitist, too. Can’t wait to blast your ass to dust.” 

“Blast my- are you sure that you want to be a hero?”

Izuku frowns at the question, and steps forward. He doesn’t see how the blue-haired boy- ah, Iida, can ask such a thing. To be honest, he doesn’t think the blond has done anything to warrant such a mean question. So the boy has his feet on his desk, didn’t wear a tie, and has a penchant for swearing. What of it? What about that is so bad that Iida doubts him so quickly? Rumi swears all of the time, especially at villains. Keigo stands on tables when he’s trying to make a point. And Izuku really wants to ditch his tie, and plans to ‘lose’ it the first moment that he can. 

But the second Izuku tries to speak, someone brushes past him. Izuku startles, wings flaring, accidentally hitting the person who bumped into him. Izuku turns to face them, to apologize.

He recognizes the dual-haired boy.

“Oh!” Izuku squeaks. “I’m so sorry, Todoroki.”

“How do you know my name?” Todoroki asks, but then his curiosity fades into annoyance. “Let me guess- my father.”

“Your father?” Izuku asks, head tilting to the side. “Who is...oh!” Keigo’s favorite, of course. “The man with the flames. Endeavor?” 

Todoroki gives him a funny look, lips pressed together but eyes betraying his confusion. “Did you not know that?”

“I’m not very knowledgeable on heroes,” Izuku admits bashfully. “I’ve always been more interested in, uh, Quirks. And scenarios. Not the people themselves…”

It may be the wrong thing to say, or maybe it isn’t, but either way Todoroki is still looking at him oddly.

“How did you recognize me, then?” He asks, and Izuku perks up. This is a question he knows the answer to!

“I saw you at the exam! You were really cool, your ice is amazing!”

Todoroki nods curtly. “Thanks.”

And then he walks away, finding his desk and sitting down. Izuku figures he should do the same, and moves to find his spot. 

He makes it two steps closer to the desks before he hears a gasp.

“Fumi! He’s a bird, too!” 

Izuku blinks in surprise as a shadow darts around his side, staring him in the eyes. Izuku stares back, eyes wide and unblinking. Is- is this his peer, or…?

Oh. It’s not. A boy is attached to the shadow- or is the shadow attached to him? It’s probably that way around, if Izuku is being sensible- and he has a bird’s head and a hand tugging at a stray feather in exasperation.

“My apologies for my Quirk,” the shadow wielder says, bowing his head. “Dark Shadow sensed someone of a similar nature, and is a curious one.”

“That’s alright!” Izuku assures. “They’re not wrong , I- I am kind of a bird!”

And kind of a rabbit. And boy does that mess with his instincts. 

“Either way, it was rather impolite,” the bird boy states. “But if you believe it is fine, I will not force you to say otherwise. I am Fumikage Tokoyami.”

“Oh! I’m Izuku Midoriya.” 

Tokoyami nods, and Izuku beams, and opens his mouth to, what, say something? But just as he does, he hears a rustling noise in the doorway.

“If you’re just here to chat, get out of my classroom,” a new voice states, and Izuku turns around to find the source.

And the source is a man laying in on the floor, wrapped in a yellow sleeping bag. As Izuku stares at the figure, the man slips a hand out, bringing a jelly pouch to his lips and slurping loudly, eyes completely uncaring as he does so. 

Izuku thinks that he just found his new role model. 

“You all took eight seconds to settle down,” the man goes on, somehow standing up without any struggle despite the sleeping bag limiting his range of movements, and Izuku decides right then and there that this man is his new favorite hero, teacher, and perhaps even person, because holy fuck he has no qualms about what others think.

“Every second wasted is a second that could be used for something useful,” the man states, slipping the bag off. “A person saved, a villain defeated...isn’t that what you’re here for? To prepare?” Letting out a sigh, the man reaches into his yellow cocoon, pulling out a gym uniform and tossing it to Izuku. “Get dressed, and head straight to Training Field A. If you’re not there in ten minutes, you’re expelled.” The man turns to leave, the only thing stopping him being a quick question from Iida.

“Who are you, sir?” The robotic boy asks, arm chopping, and the man hardly spares a glance back.

“Shouta Aizawa. Your homeroom teacher for the year...if you can stay for more than a day, that is.”

With Aizawa’s disappearance around the corner, Izuku lets his wings flutter as his grip tightens around the uniform.

“Wow,” Izuku breathes out in awe, and then he’s racing through the halls, searching for the boys’ locker room.

He’s halfway through changing when the rest of the boys arrive. A few of them greet him, but Izuku is too focused on getting dressed to give them much more than a quick ‘hello’ back. After thirty seconds of struggling to put on his shirt, and finally deciding to forgo it for the time being, holding it in his hands and simply wearing his tank top that he always has on underneath his shirts, Izuku is leaving the locker room and heading out to find his teacher. 

Izuku isn’t too surprised to find that he’s the first one there, although he is somewhat disappointed when he sees that Aizawa-sensei doesn’t have his sleeping bag with him. He shrugs it off, however, instead just enjoying the silence and the warmth of the sun.

Aizawa doesn’t let the silence last long, however, instead asking, “Why are you holding your shirt?”

“It won’t fit over my wings, sensei,” Izuku says. “I need to cut holes in- ah, if I’m allowed to, of course.”

Aizawa raises an eyebrow at the remark. “It’s your shirt, I won’t get upset that you’re adding the necessary openings.” 

Izuku blinks in surprise, then smiles. He had assumed that he might get in trouble, but if Aizawa-sensei is encouraging him…

“Do you have a knife?” Izuku asks, then slaps a hand over his mouth. Again with the questions!

Aizawa doesn’t say anything, instead pulling out a pocket knife and tossing it to Izuku, who once again catches what the man tosses at him. Izuku sends a grateful smile his way, then moves into a kneeling position. He spreads the shirt out, mentally mapping where his wings need to emerge from, and begins to cut through the fabric.

He’s startled halfway through the first slit by his teacher, who asks, “Why didn’t you have your uniform adjusted for you?”

“I- I’m sorry?” Izuku asks, and Aizawa frowns.

“Your uniform. In the forms you got, you were able to ask for necessary adjustments and accommodations. Why didn’t you ask for openings for your wings?”

“I was never given the chance,” Izuku answers simply, still looking up to his teacher. When the black-haired man gestures for him to continue, he adds, “My handler, ah, must not have thought I needed any adjustments? I- I would have to ask.” 

And he doesn’t ask. No. No, because Present Mic and Yoarashi may accept questions, and Aizawa-sensei seems to be alright with them as well, maybe, but his handler?

No.

“Your...handler.” Aizawa says the word like it’s unusual, slipping off of his tongue in an almost funny sort of way.

“I suppose you could call her my guardian? Care...caretaker?” Izuku offers, giving the second option when Aizawa just continues to stare at him. It’s kind of odd, how the man doesn’t accept the answer straight away, but before the silence can go on for too long, the others finally start to arrive. 

“Dude, you’re fast!” A redhead exclaims, and Izuku chuckles even as his ear twitches at the sudden remark.

“Ah, thank you?” Unsure how to continue the conversation, Izuku diverts his attention to his shirt, quickly cutting out the holes for his wings and slipping the shirt on as the last few show up. He hands the knife back to his teacher as the final student makes an appearance, and Aizawa begins immediately.

“The ball throw, standing long jump, fifty meter dash...you’ve done these tests each year without your Quirks, because the world is afraid to admit that not everyone is equal.” Eyes sweeping over the class, Aizawa says, “Today, you’re going to change it up. Eight tests, Quirks allowed. I’ll be testing to see who can do the best. Bakugou.”

Aizawa tosses a softball to a boy with spiky blond hair, who catches it in one hand. “Throw the ball. Do whatever you like, just stay in the circle.”

Izuku watches as the blond, Bakugou, steps into a white circle. His eyes stay trained on the teen as he pulls back his arm, and then throws it forward- an explosion shooting from his palm and sending the ball high into the sky. A beeping noise follows, and Izuku looks at the phone that Aizawa shows off.

The ball went over seven-hundred meters. Wow.

“That looks like so much fun!” A girl who is entirely pink shouts, and Aizawa turns his sharp gaze on her.

“Fun, huh? Well, how about this? The person who ranks last will be expelled.” 

Izuku blinks in surprise. Huh. He didn’t know that teachers did that. How odd.

His peers seem to be complaining about how unfair that is, but Izuku holds his tongue. It’s not a matter of fair or not, the world-

“The world isn’t fair,” Aizawa scolds, and Izuku nods, understanding. “Fires, earthquakes, murders...do you think the world is fair? No, it isn’t, and neither are we. Yuuei has a rather lax policy on education, and that works for the teachers as much as it does the teachers.”

Ah. So the constant threat of expulsion is just a thing here. Izuku files that tidbit away, it’s clear to him that he’ll need to keep this in mind.

And so with his class suddenly silent, and expulsion hanging over their heads, the eight tests begin. 

They’re...actually not bad, if Izuku is honest. Well, not bad for him . Most of the tests focus on running or hopping- and Izuku is great at both of these things. But even then, he’s able to simply soar through a majority of the tests, literally, flying through the events. 

The fifty meter dash, standing long jump, and distance run are all handled by kicking off of the ground with a horizontal leap, using his wings to continue with the momentum and carry him to a high score. The repeated side steps are fun, reminding him of a competition he once had with Rumi to see who could keep hopping for the longest time. Izuku may accidentally binky a few times during the test, caught up in the memory, but that’s fine.

Sit ups and the seated toe-touch aren’t bad, either. Izuku manages to end up as the final one going, likely because his trainer makes him do sit ups and other basic drills whenever he messes up a maneuver or exercise. For the seated toe-touch, well…

“Bro,” the redhead whispers. “How are you doing that?”

‘That’ is Izuku practically collapsing on himself, his stomach touching the floor as his hands reach in front of him. 

“Oh,” Izuku murmurs. “Well, I was trained to focus on kicks, so I need to be able to kick high to make up for my punches.” His arms are muscular, sure, but he’s definitely a kicker. He’s just...made for it, really. “So I do a lot of stretching!”

His peers seem impressed, at least. 

The only tests that aren’t as wonderful are the grip strength test and the ball throw. Izuku does well with the first, considering that he doesn’t have a strength Quirk, managing to get over seventy kilograms. It looks like his literal years of training have been for something at least.

Finally, Izuku goes to the ball throw, where he frowns before lighting up, ears perking straight up. The skvader bounces a few times before throwing the ball lightly into the air. Once it starts to drop, he jumps up and kicks the ball, beaming widely as it soars through the sky. He gets just under two-hundred meters, and wiggles in delight. 

When the eighth test is finished, and all of his peers have gone, Aizawa puts up the results. Izuku looks for his name, and beams at the hologram.

‘ Izuku Midoriya- first .’

Izuku perks up at the placement, glad that he’s proven himself so early. At the very least, now he’s shown his teacher that he’s good enough to stay, and staying means less time with his handlers and their disappointed looks!

But Izuku does feel bad for the invisible girl, who is sniffling and presumably tearing up, not that Izuku can really be sure. She has a few of the girls patting her on the back, consoling her, and Izuku feels himself taking a step closer to her. Maybe she’ll be comforted if he drapes his wings over her? He met a little kid, once, who had enjoyed the feathery hug. They had described it as a personal blanket, shielding them from the world...and it looks like she needs a shield right now.

However, just as Izuku goes to offer a wing, Aizawa shuts off the hologram and smiles widely.

“I lied,” Aizawa states simply, and the class freezes. Izuku does so too, confused. “No one is going home. This was just a logical ruse to convince you all to do your best.”

Izuku watches as some of his peers freak out, yelling about how he had tricked them and they had been terrified. The invisible girl, for her part, is laughing in a somewhat hysteric manner, and Izuku averts his gaze, offering her a semblance of privacy instead.

He ends up locking eyes with a girl with blonde hair and horns. The girl gives him a confused look, and asks, “Was that not obvious? I thought it was just a joke.” Her words are spoken somewhat awkwardly, as if the accent is unfamiliar. Izuku doesn’t want to pry, though, so he doesn’t.

Instead, Izuku admints, “I, uh, assumed schools were just like that .” 

“Are you also not from around here?” She asks, eyes widening with excitement. Izuku feels bad when he shakes his head.

“I’m, ah, homeschooled. Or I was. But now I’m here!”

“I am also now here!” The girl says, delighted. “I am Pony Tsunotori! From America!”

“Izuku Midoriya, from...Japan,” Izuku responds, and Tsunotori smiles so brightly at him, he can’t help but return it.

He walks out of the first day of school with his head held high, and a new friend to treasure.

He wonders what tomorrow will bring.

Chapter Text

Day Two

 

‘Tomorrow', as it was called the day before, brings quite a bit to Izuku.

The day starts the same as the day before, with Izuku arriving not too early, not too late, and only a little annoyed from the ride. (He wants to ask when he'll be able to just walk to school, the Commission isn't even that far from Yuuei after all, but the driver doesn't look like he likes questions either. So Izuku keeps his lips shut, and hopes that the answer is soon .)

Iida is already in the classroom when Izuku arrives, and so are Todoroki and Bakugou, but Tsunotori is there too and she is as eager as he is to talk once more.

"I never asked for your number! For the telephone!" Tsunotori exclaims as soon as she sees him, racing to stand in front of him. Izuku lets out a nervous laugh, because he had also forgotten.

"It's a good thing we're classmates, then," Izuku comments as he pulls out his phone, opening up his contact and handing over the phone. When Tsunotori does the same, his eyes widen at the sheer amount of names her phone has listed. Izuku himself only has around fifteen, and only three of those are ones he wants in his phone. Other than Rumi, Keigo, and Yoarashi, Izuku’s contacts are nothing but tutors, trainers, and handlers. Contacts for people who only send messages on what he must do next, and never anything else.

So when Tsunotori hands back his phone, and it’s still open on her contact, Izuku takes it with a smile. 

His smile only grows when Tsunotori says, “Let’s go sit before the teacher arrives! I think your spot is behind mine!”

And it is. But that’s not even the most amazing part, no.

The best part is that Izuku’s seat is different. 

It wasn’t before. Izuku knows this. He saw the desks yesterday, looked at all twenty seats and saw that they were the same. Blue padded seats, with a backing that would support even the tallest of his peers, that could roll around for easy access. Perfect for those who are especially tall, and armless to help those with extra limbs like the boy with six arms in his class.

But not for those with extra appendages coming from their back . Not for people like Izuku.

But this chair is .

It’s a rollable chair, just like the others. It has blue padding that will keep him from becoming uncomfortable. It’s large enough for him to sit on, even if he was sitting with his legs crossed over each other, his shoes resting on the cushion and all.

And most importantly? It’s backless. 

Izuku can’t help the spark of joy that flits through him as he sets down his bag, grateful for the accommodation. He wonders who made the change. Was it Aizawa-sensei, who questioned him yesterday when he couldn’t wear his shirt? If so, the man is living up to his title as Izuku’s new icon, and Izuku can only hope that he’ll be able to thank the man sometime today.

For now, though, Aizawa isn’t in the room, so Izuku just takes in the sight of his peers. Tsunotori is playing a game on her phone, and Izuku hums softly as he spots the little English encouragements that pop up. He makes an internal note to ask her if she prefers speaking in English, but decides to wait until he’s sure that she wants to answer a question rather than springing it upon her.

The rest of the room is filling rather quickly. Tokoyami takes a seat in front of Todoroki, who is beside him but not speaking. Tokoyami offers him a quick greeting, Dark Shadow a longer one, and Izuku returns both gratefully. A few others smile his way, but Izuku doesn’t speak up. 

Their smiles are enough, at least.

The bell rings, starting the day, and Izuku keeps quiet as Aizawa enters the room. His peers fall silent only six seconds after the man walks in, to which Aizawa nods before starting the day.

And the day flies by, much faster than Izuku would have expected. Izuku has heard people talk about school, after all, on the radio. Most say it takes forever to get through a single day, but Izuku feels like he changes periods with every blink. One moment, he’s in English class, listening to Present Mic- Present Mic! - talk about sentence structures, and the next he’s being taught math by a guy who calls himself Ectoplasm. 

And lunch! There’s lunch time, where Tsunotori takes him by the arm and pulls him to a table, nearly making Izuku drop his lunch but that’s fine ! Because Izuku gets to sit with a friend, a friend his age , and talk!

Only two others join them at their table, but Izuku doesn’t think that’s a bad thing. He’s happy when Tokoyami joins them, murmuring that Dark Shadow wouldn’t quit pestering him before taking a spot. He’s ecstatic when another person joins, a pink-haired and skinned named Mina Ashido, who Tsunotori befriended in the changing rooms yesterday.

“You’re mister first place!” Ashido realizes after a moment, and Izuku blushes before nodding. He doesn’t speak, but he doesn’t have to- she stated a fact, after all.

Ashido continues to speak, luckily, so the conversation doesn’t drop off there. She talks about how excited she is to be here, and how she’s looking forward to their afternoon lesson.

“The morning was all of the boring stuff!” Ashido declares. “But afternoons are for heroics ! I can’t wait to show off what I’ve got, you know?”

“And I as well!” Tsunotori agrees. “This looks like it will be a fun year!”

Izuku thinks heroics will be...fun? He supposes it will be, if it’s getting his peers so riled up. 

He just hopes it isn’t the same training as he does with his trainers, or on his own. He does enough lifting, he’ll be happy if there’s some variety.

Then again, at least he’ll have people with him. That’s bound to be better than just listening to a radio show, right?

Yeah!

With this in mind, Izuku isn’t all too upset when lunch ends, happily following half a step behind Ashido and Tsunotori, Tokoyami beside him. He sits on his seat, wings stretching into the open air, angled so that he doesn’t accidentally knock Todoroki. As he stretches, he can’t help but hear someone racing through the hall, and tenses up when the door slams open. 

A blond hero races into the room, one of the few that Izuku can recognize by name.

All Might, the Number One Hero. His handlers want him to act more like the man- strong, confident, able to calm civilians with a smile. 

Izuku will do what he can, he supposes. 

It’s rather odd, seeing the man in person. The man who is usually just a symbol of what he should become, an idea more than a reality, stands at the front of the classroom decked out in a shiny hero costume. 

All Might hops right into the lesson, sending everyone off to grab their hero costumes, and telling them all to head to Ground Beta before racing away. Izuku nods to himself, the directions are easy enough to follow. Without a word, Izuku grabs case number twenty and heads to the locker rooms.

He...likes his costume well enough, he supposes. Izuku never got a say, but he’s glad that it’s so familiar .

The Commission, at the very least, lets him have a piece of home in his outfit. It’s a mixture of

his colony, and makes Izuku smile as he puts on each piece in the locker room.

First is the shirt. It’s sleeveless, and clings to his body, much like Rumi’s costume, but the black fabric has the same markings as Keigo’s shirt, just in a dark green that matches his hair. Black pants come next, with dark green stripes on the outside to make a pair of the first two pieces. Third is the coat, similar to Keigo’s but green instead of the tan color Keigo sports. It’s lined with a warm material, meant to allow him to fly higher without getting too cold. They even have wing slits, same with the shirt, and Izuku is happy that his handlers thought about that detail for this- he’d rather not have to cut his costume, after all.

The rest of the costume isn’t as exciting or comforting. Black boots are slipped onto his feet, a matching utility belt goes on his waist, and white gloves are pulled up to his wrists. 

Izuku leaves the locker room as quickly as he entered it, heading down to the correct training ground. He’s the first one out once again, and All Might seems surprised by his early arrival, but Izuku doesn’t bat an eye, instead turning his gaze upwards. 

All Might must be surprised by this, because he clears his throat, the sound oddly wet. Izuku wants to ask, but refrains, instead giving the man his privacy. Perhaps he choked on his own spit? Izuku has done that before during training, he won’t judge the hero.

“You must be young Midoriya, yes?” All Might asks, and Izuku startles before nodding. All Might smiles, but the expression starts to strain when the silence stretches. 

‘ Was I supposed to say something? ’ Izuku wonders to himself as All Might stays quiet. He doesn’t think so, he nodded after all. But All Might is waiting for him to say something...maybe he thinks Izuku doesn’t know who he is?

“And you’re All Might...I think,” Izuku says hesitantly, probably way too late because All Might startles yet again . 

“You think?” All Might asks after a moment, and Izuku nods again. All Might opens his mouth, probably planning to say something, but he’s cut off by the sound of footsteps.

“Midoriya!” Tsunotori cheers. “I am so excited! You are as well, right?”

“Right,” Izuku agrees instantly, because doing otherwise feels rude. Tsunotori brightens up all the more, proving Izuku’s response to be the right one, and he smiles back.

The rest of the class gathers not long after Tsunotori arrives, and Izuku marvels at all of their hero costumes. He can’t help it, they all look so cool .

And apparently All Might agrees, because he lets out a laugh and proclaims, “They say the clothes make the hero, and you lot look like a bunch of new herolings! Now, let’s get onto our first lesson!”

Iida raises his hand, and speaks before being called on. “Sir, I see that this is the same grounds as used for the exam. Are we performing cityscape maneuvers?”

“Not today!” All Might rejects. “Today, you’ll be fighting indoors! The action may seem to only ever take place in the streets, but the truly nefarious villains know to hide in the shadows. That’s why your first lesson will be a battle against your peers, to see how battles truly go!”

“But isn’t that dangerous?” A girl with green hair asks. “We haven’t even learned the basics.”

“The basics are best taught through experience,” All Might declares, and so everyone accepts his answer.

And, to Izuku’s surprise, more questions are asked in a rapid flurry.

“How will teams be decided?”

“How much can I hurt the other people?”

“Are we going to get expelled if we lose?”

“Isn’t my cape marvelous?”

Izuku stares at his peers as they continue to inquire about the exercise, shocked by their boldness. So shocked that he nearly misses All Might’s words.

But he’s learned what happens if one isn’t observant, and so he tunes in at the perfect moment.

“We’ll be using lots to determine partners, and then to decide who will be the hero team and who will be the villain team. Come grab your lot while I explain the scenario.”

Izuku follows the man’s instructions, picking up a slip that has the letter ‘F’ on it while All Might describes the exercise. It seems simple enough, and Izuku can’t help but be excited to train for what must be the first time in ages.

A chance to spar with new people, all while trying to either defend or get access to a fake bomb? Izuku’s wings are already fluttering.

Izuku glances around, trying to find his partner. Tsunotori stands next to a boy with a tail, Ashido with a guy who has a cool black streak in his blond hair, and Tokoyami with a boy who has on an orange bodysuit and soft beige hair. His face is hidden by a helmet, but Izuku is pretty sure that it’s the boy with giant teeth that remind him somewhat of a skull. One by one, everyone else seems to know who their partner is. So who is remaining?

“Hey! You’ve got ‘F’, right?” Izuku jumps, whirling around to face a redhead with a sharp yet kind smile. He nods quickly, showing his slip, and the redhead lets out a happy laugh before showing off his matching paper.

“It looks like we’re a team! I’m Eijirou Kirishima, what’s your name?”

“I’m Izuku Midoriya.” 

Kirishima grins wider at the response, nodding enthusiastically. “Nice! We’re gonna do great, man, I just know it!”

Izuku hopes so.

All Might calls the first match, team B versus team C. Team B, composed of the boy with the additional limbs, Shouji; and Sero, who can shoot tape out of his elbows, are the heroes. Team C, which is the girl with earphone jacks hanging from her earlobes, Jirou; and the frog girl Asui, are picked to be the villains. Izuku sighs with relief, glad that he doesn’t have to be the very first to go, and watches as the battle begins.

And oh, what a battle it is. Not one of explosive force and unwavering strength, but rather one focused on stealth and subtlety. Izuku watches with unblinking eyes as both Shouji and Jirou listen to their surroundings, and while the audio isn’t available, he can still tell that the two are telling their respective teammates what is changing. When the heroes start to get closer, Asui gets into position, hiding right next to the doorway.

She pounces the moment that someone enters the room.

The problem is, she lunges on Shouji, who uses one of his Dupli-Arms to smack her away. Sero uses the moment to shoot tape at her, effectively trapping her to the wall she landed against. 

Jirou tries to defend the bomb, Izuku can tell, but it only takes one moment of her being distracted by Shouji for Sero to sprint over to the bomb, tapping it and earning the heroes their win.

The second fight is sort of funny, if Izuku is being quite honest with himself. The members of team G, Hagakure and Kouda, are the heroes. Meanwhile, team H, Bakugou and Satou, are the villains. Izuku watches the cameras, paying special attention to where Hagakure is when she takes off her shoes and gloves.

And he can’t hold in his laughter when the match starts, and she manages to walk right past Bakugou in the first three minutes of the match.

“What’s so funny?” Kirishima asks, and Izuku answers obligingly.

“Hagakure passed Bakugou,” Izuku informs, and gets an odd look in return.

“How do you know that?” Kirishima asks. “She’s, you know, invisible!”

“She messes up the light,” Tokoyami says, joining in the conversation. Dark Shadow nods behind him, and Izuku joins in.

“Oh! Is it a bird thing?” Kirishima asks, and Izuku giggles again.

“I can see Ultraviolet Light, kind of. It’s not the best, but I can tell where Hagakure is because of it.” Not very well, of course, because while his normal vision is well past impeccable, he doesn’t rely enough on UV lighting to have fine-tuned vision...but it’s enough that he can see the bizarre wrongness that moves where Hagakure is, messing with refractions and absorptions that simply don’t occur when she interferes. 

It’s rather fascinating, as much as it is unusual. But it’s well worth it, to be able to laugh at the shocked face that Satou makes when All Might calls for the heroes’ victory.

The teams return, with Bakugou looking rather angry as he slouches against the wall, and the third match begins. Now team A, Iida and Todoroki, as the heroes against team D, Tokoyami and Honenuki, Izuku looks forward to seeing what will happen.

And he’s not disappointed. Iida and Todoroki start off strong- or, rather, Todoroki starts off strong, a wave of ice covering the entire building. Izuku gasps at the show of power and precision, amazed as the cameras show how every wall and floor is lined with the frozen substance. Todoroki enters the building calmly, confidence obvious in his set shoulders and upturned jaw. Iida, flustered, tries to move across the ice, but only manages to skid around. If one were to only follow the heroes, they’d assume that victory was assured for the duo, the villains already immobilized. 

But Izuku lets his eyes drift to the cams focusing on the villains, and his smile only grows. Because Honenuki is doing something- what, Izuku isn’t sure- to the ice, and after making contact with it in a ring around the room, he settles back into place next to Tokoyami, who was freed by a much larger Dark Shadow. 

When Todoroki enters, there’s chaos. Chaos, because first Todoroki steps on his own ice, but rather than effortlessly sliding over it, he sinks . 

‘ A Softening Quirk of sorts, ’ Izuku realizes, eyes widening as the ice wielder seems to struggle in his stance.

And the moment Todoroki begins to struggle, Dark Shadow moves for the final blow. Todoroki’s ice means nothing against the shadow, who winds around his blasts and knocks him down, tying him up and rendering him immobile.

Iida never even makes it, unable to climb the stairs without slipping back down. The villains win, leaving Izuku’s peers in silent awe. Dark Shadow is practically shining with joy when he comes back, as impossible as it sounds.

The fourth round pits teams E and J against each other. Team E is Aoyama and Monoma, who are the villains against Ojirou and Tsunotori. 

They’re defeated rather quickly, although Izuku does note that Monoma seemed to be using the exact same Quirk as Aoyama, a bright laser shooting from his stomach. 

“I hate going against mutant Quirks,” Monoma mutters upon his return, and Izuku blinks as the pieces click into place.

He has a copying Quirk. Huh.

Izuku wonders what the applications of such a Quirk could be, but doesn’t have any time to ponder the thought, because it’s finally his turn.

Izuku and Kirishima are set up to be the heroes, with Kaminari and Ashido as the villains. Izuku watches as his peers enter the building they’ll be fighting with, then lets his eyes trail down to the blueprints All Might had given him.

He can’t help but notice how many windows there are...but nobody else has entered through the windows, so does that mean he shouldn’t?

“What’s on your mind, Midoriya?” Kirishima asks, and Izuku startles. Kirishima...wants his thoughts?

Yuuei is full of surprises, isn’t it!

“No one has gone through the windows yet,” Izuku points out. When Kirishima just nods his head, Izuku runs a hand through his hair before adding, “Most of the rooms seem to have windows. The room with the bomb likely has them, too.”

“Oh! So you want to fly on in? That’s so cool, man! I wouldn’t have even thought about it.” Beaming, Kirishima asks, “Do you think you’d be able to lift both of us into the room?”

“I think so,” Izuku says, a plan coming together. Head tilting, he asks, “You have a Hardening Quirk, right? How do you feel about throwing rocks at glass walls?”

Kirishima lets out a loud laugh, eyes wide with delight. “Let’s do it!” He cheers, and that’s all of the approval that Izuku needs.

When time runs out, Izuku flies away, quickly scouting the room to find where the bomb is. Seeing that both villains are still in the room, he dives back to Kirishima, who’s fists are clenched with anticipation. 

“Ready?” Izuku asks, and Kirishima nods. Swiftly, Izuku grabs the boy carefully, making sure to get a proper hold on him, and then flies back up. He stays out of view, keeping to a blind spot, and clears his throat.

“On three,” Izuku whispers. He begins to swing the boy, and on the count of three, throws the boy with a forward motion. He grins as Kirishima hardens his entire body in midair, crashing through the window and moving into a roll the second he hits the floor. Izuku flies in after him, and immediately goes on offense, knocking Kaminari away from his partner.

“I’ll get the bomb!” Kirishima shouts, and Izuku hops into action, diving at the villains.

The fight is the quickest one yet, Izuku knows, when Kirishima gets a hand on the bomb not thirty seconds later. Izuku giggles as he sets down Kaminari, who he had been dangling by a shoe, and lets his wings fluff up with pride as Kirishima cheers. 

“That’s how we do it!” Kirishima cheers, holding a fist at Izuku. Izuku blinks at the gesture, and glances curiously at Kirishima.

Is he playing that one game...rock, paper, scissors? It seems fitting, for his Quirk, but Izuku doesn’t think that’s quite right.

“Are you going to leave him hanging?” Kaminari asks, and Izuku frowns at the phrasing. 

‘ Leave him hanging…? Oh! ’ 

Now understanding what he has to do, Izuku takes his hand and grabs Kirishima’s fist so that it’s no longer hanging in the air. He must have done something right, because Kaminari and Ashido are laughing, and it sounds like happy laughter, and Kirishima is still smiling...so Izuku smiles too, proud and confident. 

And when he gets back to the watching room, the rest of his peers seem impressed by his plan, so Izuku thinks his second day has gone wonderfully. 

He wonders what happens next. 
Notes:

    So now we know who all is in 1-A!

    To make it easier, here's the official changes for 1-A.
    1. Yaoyorozu went to 1-B.
    2. Mineta went to 1-B.
    3. Uraraka went to Shiketsu.
    4. Izuku takes the second Recommendation spot. He is now student number 20, seated in the back row.
    5. Tsunotori gets into 1-A.
    6. Honenuki did not get in on Recommendations, but he passed the normal Entrance Exam and made it into 1-A.
    7. Monoma takes the final spot in 1-A.

    I hope that this helps! Let me know if you have any comments or questions, and I'll see you all next time. <3

Chapter 5: Day Three
Chapter Text

Day Three

 

Izuku gets the vote for class representative. It’s...not necessarily exciting, nor is it something Izuku plans to decline. It just...is.

Izuku doesn’t mind it, at the very least. He has no doubts that the Commission would want him to take up the role. 

On the bright side, he’ll likely need to show up to school earlier, and stick around later! Maybe he can use this to convince his handler that he can bring himself to Yuuei?

“Congratulations on earning the role as Class Representative!” Iida praises, and Izuku blinks up at the tall boy. 

“Thank you,” Izuku responds. “And congratulations on becoming the Vice Representative.” Iida definitely seems to be much more enthusiastic about the position, smiling and nodding sharply at the reminder. 

That little conversation aside, Aizawa instructs everyone back to their seats. Izuku perches on his chair, wings stretching in the open air before laying back down. Class starts, and Izuku lets his attention be fully pulled in by the subjects.

Lunch arrives rather quickly, and Izuku hums with pleasure when Tsunotori leads him back to the same table as the day before. He takes his spot, right at the end, where he can stretch out a bit more, and smiles as Tsunotori sits on his left. Ashido quickly steals the spot across from Tsunotori, and Tokoyami sits across from him calmly. And then, as if that wasn’t great enough, Kirishima joins them! And so does Kaminari, the boy he faced yesterday, who waves cheerfully before plopping down into a spot.

“First place on the first day, mastermind behind your fight yesterday, and the class rep. today? Midoriya, you’re killing it!” Kaminari exclaims, and Izuku smiles shyly at the praise. 

But it is rather odd, Izuku thinks, how so many of his peers had actively wanted to become the class representative, and yet still voted for him. He wonders why.

“I’ve just been lucky, that’s all,” Izuku says, and gets a round of confused noises and objections in return. Embarrassed but sure, he says, “The initial test was simply in my favor. It didn’t account for anyone with a wing Quirk, as they’re pretty rare. I was just lucky to have Kirishima with me as my human rock yesterday, and today...ah, admittedly, I’m not sure how I got the spot.”

“Well, I don’t know about them ,” Kirishima starts, jabbing a finger at the rest of the table, “but I voted for you! You’re really manly, Midoriya!”

“I voted for you, too!” Ashido chimes in.

“And I as well!” Tsunotori agrees.

“I almost voted for myself, but I thought you were the better candidate,” Kaminari adds. “I’d probably overwork myself into short-circuiting, but you seem to like being here a lot.”

Short-circuiting? Izuku frowns. That doesn’t sound very safe...there must be a way to fix that, right?

Tokoyami pulls him out of his thoughts with a somewhat exasperated, “Dark Shadow filled out my vote, writing your name on it. Which was rather unnecessary, as I also had plans to vote for you…”

Izuku blinks in surprise, and then smiles more sincerely. “Thank you, guys. I hope that I’ll live up to your expectations.”

He thinks that his friends (friends!) are opening their mouths to reassure him, or something, but he doesn’t hear a single word before loud alarms begin to blare through the cafeteria, making him wince and flinch back, hands reaching up to cover his ears.

The noise is barely muffled, the alarm shouting out, “Level three security breach. Please make your way to the designated safe zone. Level three security breach. Please-”

Izuku does his best to tune it out, listening to a third year as they exclaim, “Level three? That means that someone has gotten in past the gates! That’s never happened before!” 

Izuku lets his eyes flicker around, taking in the sights around him as Kirishima pulls him to the exit- the rather crowded exit, Izuku notes. His eyes widen as he gets close to the window, seeing a bunch of people storming through the gates. Gates which have disappeared, turned into dust from what he can see.

He spots their cameras, and he understands.

“It’s just the media,” Izuku says, but no one can hear him over the panic. He tries to explain, but no one looks. He’s too insignificant, lost in the crowd like this.

So Izuku does what he does best, and flies above the rest.

“Yuuei!” Izuku shouts, raising his voice more than he ever has before. It seems to work, his green wings gaining the attention that he needed. “It’s just the press! You don’t need to panic, there is no threat!” Eyes scanning the crowd, he focuses on a student in a third year’s uniform. “You! You should be leading them by example! A hero leads with confidence, don’t they? Use that to make your way safely to your classes!”

The third year nods, smiling brightly. “Got it! Let’s go, everyone! Nice and calm!” The blond leads some of the herd away, and Izuku sighs in relief as the crowd dies down, giving him room to land. The moment his feet touch the ground, his confidence seeps away, leaving him shaking.

He’s never raised his voice like that. 

Kirishima offers an open hand when he reaches Izuku, and Izuku takes it gratefully. The redhead leads him back to 1-A, praising him for his quick thinking all the way. Izuku doesn’t respond, just smiling, but Kirishima doesn’t seem to mind.

When he gets to the classroom, the praise becomes worse, his peers cheering him on.

“That was so cool!” Sero compliments. “Dude, you were hella fierce for a moment there.”

“You calmed them all so fast!” Hagakure says. “I was nearly trampled in the rush, and then you just stopped them all. It was amazing.”

“You acted like a proper hero, as expected of the Class Representative in such a prestigious school!” Iida chimes in, and Izuku...Izuku winces back at that one. The words sound praising, yet, for some inexplicable reason, Izuku can’t help but recoil as if the words are scathing.

He doesn’t understand why , though, and that makes him cautious. He nods at the words, and then turns when he hears footsteps on the other side of the door. The door opens a second after, and Aizawa walks in. The two make eye contact, which Izuku quickly breaks.

He misses the way Aizawa studies him before speaking.

“I heard how you dealt with the alarm,” Aizawa says. “Good job, Midoriya. The rest of you, take his words to heart. You need to know how to act in the face of fear, got it?”

“Yes, sensei!” The class cheers, and Izuku burns brightly from the praise. He moves to go back to his seat, but Aizawa raises a hand up. He stops.

“In just a moment, you’ll be heading to the locker rooms to get dressed before we head out to Training Ground C. Before that, however...the class representative needs to choose his council members.”

Izuku blinks in surprise, then nods hurriedly. Not wanting to waste any time, he asks, “How many members do you want me to choose?”

“Three will be plenty,” Aizawa states. “You just need them for votes, or if you or Iida are absent for the day.”

“Right!” Turning to the class, he says, “Please raise your hand if you’d like to be on the council.” 

He doesn’t want to choose someone who doesn’t want to be picked, after all. Luckily, three of his immediate choices raise their hands, so Izuku is quick to call out their names.

“Tsunotori, Ashido, and Kirishima. Please.” Izuku glances to Aizawa, who nods and marks it down.

“Alright. Go get dressed, everyone.”

Izuku won’t make him say it again, racing out with the rest of them.

Once again, he’s the first one out on the field. Aizawa nods in approval, then looks away, finishing up with, well, whatever he’s doing.

The man begins to speak the moment the last student arrives, and Izuku listens attentively as he does so.

“Heroes need to be able to evade as much as they need to be able to see what’s hidden. For today’s exercise…” Here Aizawa sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Well, simply put, you’re going to be playing Hide and Seek Tag.”

Izuku watches as his peers begin to perk up, Kirishima pumping his fist in the air and turning to him with an eager expression.

“I love tag!” Kirishima cheers. “I haven’t played that since elementary.”

“It’s impressive, that such a well-known game can be applied to a training setting!” Iida exclaims, and Izuku blinks in surprise.

“Are you excited?” Tsunotori asks, and Izuku lets out a nervous laugh.

“Not particularly?” Izuku admits, albeit hesitantly. “I...do not know what ‘tag’ is?”

The field goes silent, and Izuku looks to Aizawa, assuming that he’s the cause of the silence. But Aizawa is just looking at him, and when Izuku looks around, he sees that his peers are staring back.

Is he the cause of the silence?

“How do you not know tag ?” Kaminari asks, and Izuku winces. 

“I, ah, was taught on my own?”

“Homeschool,” Ashido says, nodding sagely, and Izuku relaxes when his peers look away.

“For tag, you have one person who is ‘it’, and their goal is to make contact with someone else who is playing. The person tapped is the new ‘it’, and they have to try to tag someone else,” Tokoyami explains calmly.

“And for hide and seek tag, you get to hide first!” Dark Shadow chirps. Izuku nods, grateful for the explanation, and Aizawa clears his throat.

“For this, however, you are not a hider once you’ve tagged another person. Your goal as a hider is to be one of the last ones remaining, or to stay out of range once found without leaving the area. Those who are tagged become fellow seekers. If all of the hiders are found, we’ll begin a new round. Understood?”

Izuku nods along with his peers, and Aizawa continues, explaining that the students can not leave the area- a forest, with random forts in trees and places to hide beneath- before announcing the first seekers. “Up first is Satou and Ojirou.” 

And so the lesson begins. Izuku watches as his peers race off, then does the same. Wings fluttering, he glances around, seeing how his classmates hide in the tree forts, among piles of crates, or even in bushes.

For a moment, Izuku wonders where he should go- and then he remembers something very, very important.

His wings are green.

His hair is green.

His costume is also green. (Maybe he wears too much green? Costume changes are allowed, right? [Is Izuku allowed to ask for costume changes, even if the staff is okay with it?])

Izuku flies above the trees, and then slips away to an area that he knows no one else is in. Then he wraps his wings around himself, the color blending in with the leaves that he perches within. And then he waits.

And waits.

And waits.

Izuku listens as his peers move around, the occasional cry of frustration reaching his ears, or a cheer of delight. Sometimes there is a terrified scream, and Izuku wonders who is being startled, the seeker or the hider, but they never seem to be close to him. 

Did he go out of bounds? No, he’d been careful. He’s still in the forest. He’s fine!

His belief is proven when he hears footsteps come closer, one of his peers approaching his tree. A second pair joins, and Izuku listens as they speak.

“Who all is left?” One asks, and Izuku thinks the voice sounds like Sero’s. 

The other one sounds like Kaminari, who says, “Just Midoriya, I think.”

“Huh. He lasted longer than the girl who is literally invisible?”

“I think Iida tripped over her?”

“Ah.”

Their voices fade away as the two walk further and further from his spot, and Izuku blinks in surprise. Did they...not see him?

Apparently not, because some time later, he hears a call through the trees.

“Midoriya!” Aizawa shouts. “You can come back to the starting point, you’ve outlasted everyone else already.”

Izuku chirps in delight at the teacher’s comment, unfurling his wings and jumping off of his branch. He soars back to the entrance, landing gracefully beside his teacher. His peers all look at him, some smiling, others exasperated.

“Where were you?” Jirou asks. “I listened for you everywhere !”

“I was in a tree!” Izuku responds, to which Ashido mutters, “Oh kami, he’s a bird , of course he was in the trees.”

Izuku wonders if he should remind her of his rabbit side, but figures it’d be rude to do so. He chooses to keep his mouth shut instead, looking to Aizawa for further instruction.

“You’re the next seeker, with Kouda,” Aizawa says, and Izuku nods before staying rooted in his spot, giving his peers the proper time needed to hide.

Instead he looks at Kouda, who waves nervously. Izuku notices how a bird is sitting on the boy’s head, and perks up. Kouda is the boy who can speak to animals, isn’t he?

Izuku chirps at the bird, keeping the tone soft, and the bird chirps back. Kouda stares in awe.

“Do you understand them, too?” Kouda asks, voice barely a whisper, almost like Izuku’s own when he speaks with his handler. 

Izuku shakes his head, smiling somewhat sadly. “No. But I have their, ah, instincts? It’s easier to understand their tone, if...if that makes sense?” 

It must, because Kouda nods along. Emboldened by their similarity, Izuku says, “I- I have a plan, if you’d like it.” 

Kouda nods, and Izuku grins.

“How many birds do you think we can use as scouts?”

The round ends in five minutes. The forest may be vast, but birds are fast travellers. 

Aizawa starts sending out more seekers after that, and Izuku isn’t allowed to be one of them. Neither is Kouda, after their teamwork.

Somehow, Izuku never once gets found. 

He delights in the frustrated yells, even if he really shouldn’t.

Keigo and Rumi have always encouraged mischief, after all.

Shouta Aizawa watches as each of his students go, taking special note as a certain boy with wings exits the room, wings stretching out as he walks behind the others. His eyes narrow when the door shuts, and then he stands up, pushing aside the lesson plans he had been fixing up. He picks up a file and walks through the massive door of 1-A.

Shouta heads down to Nedzu’s office, giving no warning as he opens the door. He knows well by now that Nedzu will be prepared to see him, the creature always is.

And Shouta is correct, being greeted by the cheerful chirp of his name and a cup of tea being set for him. 

“To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?” Nedzu asks, and Shouta frowns before setting down the file. He slides it closer to Nedzu, who opens it up with interest. “Oh? You’ve been looking into your student’s file? What about it, Aizawa?”

“Is Midoriya being raised by the government?” Shouta asks, not willing to beat around the bush. “Is he being raised by the Hero Commission?”

“I’ve been wondering the same thing,” Nedzu admits, setting down the file. “When he took the Recommendation Exam, I was interested. The boy is well above his peers in terms of intelligence and education, he excelled in the practical portion, and it’s clear that he’s been pushed hard to become the best hero that he can be. I looked into his files a bit deeper, and it’s...interesting.”

“I couldn’t find much about his family,” Shouta states. “It mentions a brother and a sister, but no names were actually listed. There are no parents referenced at all, and the guardian information is nothing but a telephone number.”

It had been...rather unsettling, how sparse the boy’s information had been. With the few odd comments and actions Midoriya had slipped, Shouta was beginning to create a picture in his head.

“I need to cut holes- ah, if I’m allowed to, of course.” It’s as if he’s not used to being allowed much, with how clearly he hesitates to work around his Quirk.

Midoriya, slapping his hand over his mouth after asking for something, as if asking questions is wrong .

“I was never given the chance...My handler-” ‘Handler’ was Midoriya’s first term for his guardian, the instinctive reaction for choice of words. The boy had stumbled over calling the woman a caretaker.

Midoriya beaming at him from on top of his new chair, as if Aizawa’s simple switch of furniture was worth a smile of pure sunshine. As if he wasn’t used to people changing anything for his sake.

Yes, Shouta is beginning to create a picture in his head.

And it isn’t one that he likes very much.

Nedzu’s smile doesn’t change, but his eyes do seem to darken, the only visible sign of his

discontent. “Yes,” he admits. “I had noticed that sparsity. That’s one of the things I looked into.” Reaching into his desk, Nedzu pulls out a file of his own and places it on the desk. Flipping it open with one of his paws, the creature begins to read.

“Izuku Midoriya has two siblings, a brother and a sister. The brother’s name is unfindable, and was hidden behind H.C. walls that I did not think were worth attempting to break at the time. His hero name, however, is one you will recognize. I’m sure that you know the Wing Hero: Hawks, yes?”

Hawks. A daylight hero that is considered kind and aloof, yet not much is known about him. He’s already the Number Three Pro Hero on the rankings, despite being in his early twenties. 

It makes sense, Shouta supposes, that Midoriya is related to the hero. Their Quirks are , after all, very similar, and wing-related Quirks are rare. Having a Quirk that grants him birdlike wings would make many suspicious of his lineage, it should have been fairly obvious that Midoriya would be related to the man in some way.

But if Midoriya’s brother is Hawks, then where does he get the rabbit half…?

Wait.

“Hawks and Miruko, are they related?” Shouta asks, and Nedzu chuckles.

“It appears so! Miruko is the older sister of Hawks and Midoriya!” 

What a family. The number three and number seven hero, with a little sibling following in their footsteps with a Quirk that blends many of the greatest aspects of their powers together. 

He wonders if it’s just coincidence, that all three have chosen the same career...or if being raised by the Hero Commission has ingrained the idea into his student’s head.

Either way, it’s something that he will have to keep an eye on. Midoriya is someone to keep an eye on.

Shouta won’t stand by if a student is being mistreated, after all. Especially not in their own home.

Chapter Text

U.S.J.

 

Izuku gets to school extra early, pleased as he walks up to the entrance of Yuuei. He’d spoken to his handler- spoken up , too!- about his new position as Class Representative, and after pleasing her with his accomplishments, he made his request to be free of the car rides he was stuck taking. He must be on track with the results that his handler and the board wanted, because his handler left a note on his door saying that he could go to school on his own- so long as he has his phone on him, of course, which he always does.

Aizawa is already napping on the ground when Izuku walks in, and Izuku whispers a soft ‘good morning’ to the otherwise empty room before taking his spot in the back. He lets out a pleased whistle as he pulls out his things for the day, looking forward to what’s to come.

Iida is the next to arrive, and he seems surprised to see that Izuku has already arrived.

"Midoriya, good morning!" Iida greets. "I didn't expect you to be here before me, but I suppose it does make sense! You are truly striving to be a great Class Representative, aren’t you?"

Honestly, Izuku just prefers being at Yuuei back with H.C., but he doesn’t know how to say that to Iida, so he just smiles and nods. Iida takes the answer and sits down, pulling out a notebook and beginning to study like a model student.

Izuku, on the other hand, pulls out his phone and slips in his earbuds, then turns on Present Mic's channel. It’s the Voice Hero's English Hour, where the blond has a mix of English songs to play. Izuku likes listening during this time when possible, it's a fun way to brush up on his skills so that his handler doesn’t get annoyed.

Izuku perks up as a familiar song begins to play, bobbing his head to the rhythm as he pulls out an analysis notebook and begins to mark notes on a Quirk he'd been assigned to break down. The normalcy of the moment makes him relax, and Izuku begins to hum along softly, forgetting for a moment that he's not in his room.

But then Tsunotori is in his face, eyes wide and smile bright as she says, "I know that song! It is in English!"

"It is," Izuku agrees, embarrassed as Tsunotori cheers.

"Do you know English?"

"Yes." Summoning his courage, Izuku asks, "Do- do you prefer to speak English? I can, if you want."

"Not always," Tsunotori starts. "I do need to become more fluent here. But we can talk in English for fun!"

' She thinks talking with me is fun, ' Izuku thinks, and that makes him ruffle with excitement.

"Of course!" Izuku agrees, and then offers an earbud to his friend(!) when their conversation begins to die down. He's happy when she accepts it, and the two listen to the radio until the bell rings.

As Izuku shoves his phone away, Aizawa begins to speak. "We'll be going on a field trip today," the man starts, and is immediately cut off by cheering.

Izuku watches as the man sighs, waiting out the cheers before saying, “Right. We’ll be focusing on rescue training, and how to act in different environments. When you go to get changed, I advise you to think carefully on whether or not you want to wear your costume or PE uniforms. You aren’t likely to be used to your costumes yet, but you’ll be doing a lot of movement. Is that clear?” After receiving a round of nods, Aizawa nods once and says, “Right. Go get changed, then, and meet in ten minutes in front of the school.”

Izuku grabs his case the moment he can, already looking forward to the exercise. He’s pretty sure that he’ll do well in rescue training, since both Rumi and Keigo have shown that they’re good at that field of heroics. While he may not have the telekinetic feathers that his brother possesses, he can fly, and that’s always useful- it never hurts to have an eye to search from above. And he’s like his sister in his ability to run quickly and hear soft noises, which always helps when searching for stragglers over large terrains. 

Yeah, Izuku is looking forward to this, and he can’t help but beam as he pulls on his costume before racing to the front. 

Aizawa gives him a look when he shows up first yet again, and the man asks, “Do you always race around like that?” 

Izuku is pretty sure that he does, so he nods. Aizawa lets out a hum in response, and Izuku enjoys the silence until his peers arrive, mostly in one giant clump.

"Everyone, please line up according to your student number, so we can enter the bus smoothly and efficiently!" Iida cries out as he approaches, hand chopping sharply, and Izuku winces. Is that really something they need to worry about? Seating charts? 

For some reason, Izuku can’t help but be annoyed at how Iida corrals everyone into perfectly symmetrical lines.

"We're taking more time getting into lines than it would take for us to just...board the bus," Sero points out, and Izuku can't help but agree mentally. Externally, however, he just keeps his mouth shut.

Still, a piece of him feels oddly pleased when he sees the bus's open seating arrangement, which effectively ruins the seating plans Iida had. 

Izuku watches as his peers get into the bus, and claims an end spot, sitting next to Asui. Kirishima gives him a little wave from Asui’s other side, smiling widely, and Izuku can’t help but return the gesture as he turns, angling his body so that his wings can drape over the open end. It’s a little odd, he’ll admit, since it means he’s staring at his peers, but it’s far more comfortable and Izuku will never pass up the chance to have a comfortable bus ride.

Asui seems to take his position as an invitation to question him, saying, “Midoriya?”

Izuku snaps his gaze to her, ears raising to listen better. She blinks at him for a moment, then continues. 

“I like to say what’s on my mind, so I tend to be rather blunt. Your Quirk...it’s a bit odd. You’re a mix of a rabbit and a bird, aren’t you? What is your Quirk even called ?”

“Oh! I call it Skvader,” Izuku chirps. When Asui just blinks at him, he tentatively adds, “Skvaders are a mythical creature, basically just winged rabbits and, well…” Izuku extends his left wing, feathers ruffling as he stretches it, and he points to one of his ears to finish the gesture.

“I see,” Asui says. “So, am I right to assume that your parents had a rabbit and bird Quirk, kero?”

“Probably!” Izuku agrees, nodding, only to hesitate when he notices the confused looks that he’s getting.

“Probably?” Kaminari asks, an eyebrow raising. “Can’t you, you know, tell?” Kaminari makes a gesture of his own, pointing at his head and back. 

“Well, if I could see them, I probably would be able to, yes,” Izuku responds, and Kaminari blinks dumbly before inhaling sharply, cringing into his seat as if trying to become a part of it.

“Oh! Oh, uh...sorry, man. That was super uncool of me,” Kaminari apologizes, and Izuku shrugs. It’s really not a big deal to him, he’s just...never known his parents. It’s nothing to worry about, or cry over, it just is . 

That’s why Izuku doesn’t have to fake his smile as he says, “It’s quite alright! That’s a normal question to have, I’m sure.” And to make Kaminari feel better, he turns to Asui and asks, “So, were both of your parents frogs, or..?”

“They are, kero,” Asui affirms. “And my sisters.”

“That’s so cool!” Kirishima cheers. “You two have super cool Quirks, origins or not! They’re super manly, I wish my Quirk was that interesting!”

“But it is?” Izuku says before he can help himself, and then he continues when Kirishima falters. “A Hardening Quirk like that has so many applications, Kirishima! You can be a weapon of your own right, or a shield of support! Don’t underestimate yourself!”

“It may not be as flashy as mine, but it certainly has its perks!” Aoyama joins in, to which Ashido comments, “And it doesn’t try to break your stomach every single time!”

“Which brings up another question,” Asui states, turning to look at Monoma. “If Aoyama’s Quirk hurts his stomach, to the point that he needs a belt on just to regulate it, how did your body handle it?”

“It didn’t,” Monoma grumbles, a hand reaching to touch his stomach as if he’s remembering the pain. “Recovery Girl scolded me for twenty minutes about using his Quirk- as if I had any other option.”

Izuku winces sympathetically, but his attention is stolen by Kaminari, who says, “Well, I think there’s a lot of people with really cool Quirks on this bus! But I think we can all agree that Midoriya is the closest to pro.”

“I mean, what about Bakugou or Todoroki?” Ojirou asks, to which Kaminari scoffs.

“Please! They may be strong, too, but look at him!”

“He has wings?” Tsunotori offers, and Kaminari shakes his head wildly. 

“No! Well, yes , but I mean! Personality matters too, guys!”

“That’s the nicest way to insult two guys at once, I think,” Hagakure states, and Izuku watches with wide eyes as Bakugou begins to shout at Kaminari, calling him a ‘dunce face’ for his comments. Todoroki, for his part, seems unphased, but Izuku isn’t really sure that Todoroki has been listening at all since they sat down, which, fair, because Izuku is starting to get lost in his own thoughts, too.

Izuku supposes that Kaminari is right, at least, in his observation. Izuku probably is the closest to pro out of his peers. With an entire lifetime of training to look back on, he thinks it’d be a poor testament to himself if he was anything less.

‘ As if the Hero Commission would accept less than what I’ve offered, ’ Izuku thinks, lips tempted to pull into a wry smile but stopped, kept purposely blank. 

The trip ends not long after Izuku falls silent, Aizawa waking up just as the bus stops and getting up immediately, gesturing for them all to follow. Izuku listens obediently, slipping out of the bus, happy to have land beneath his feet. He looks up at the massive, dome-like building, eyes widening as he takes in the view.

“It’s so cool!” Someone shouts, and Izuku nods automatically in agreement. 

But when Aizawa leads them through the front entrance, excitement suddenly shifts into apprehension, and Izuku feels his shoulders stiffen as his ears perk up, feathers fluffing ever so slightly instinctively. Izuku glances around, eyes tracking everything.

But nothing seems wrong. 

And isn’t that alarming.

Izuku’s ear twitches as he watches Aizawa speak to another hero, who wears a spacesuit as their costume. Izuku wonders who they are, they look kind of familiar. Maybe he’s studied their Quirk?

The feeling gets worse as the space hero lifts up three fingers, and Izuku lets his wings ruffle, displeasure uncontainable. 

“Are you cold?” Kirishima asks him, and Izuku frowns, shaking his head. He’s not cold, his suit makes sure of that.

No, his brain is just yelling at him, screaming more and more the longer Izuku waits. The hero begins to talk, introducing themself as Thirteen, but Izuku can’t listen past that, only hearing the repetitive chants of ‘Flee! Flee! Run, hide, get to safety now !’ and ‘Protect, save, defend them.’ It’s confusing and disorienting, the way his instincts have always been when the conflicting halves of his Quirk have to work at once, but Izuku knows one thing.

He always trusts his instincts. And when his instincts are at war with each other, it only means one thing…

And so Izuku slips over to his teacher’s side, hesitantly tugs on Aizawa’s sleeve as his class is enamored by Thirteen, and whispers, “Something is wrong , sir.”

And something is.

A swirling, purple vortex begins to open up by the fountain, a mist spreading around it. Izuku watches with growing worry as something steps out, misty and undefined by the normal, shapely figure that one would expect. A man covered in hands walks out next, followed by a hulking beast that makes Izuku’s instincts shriek , and then more portals are opening up, dozens of people walking through.

No.

“Is the activity starting?” Kirishima asks, and Izuku spreads a wing automatically to block the redhead from moving forward.

Those aren’t just people. They’re-

“Villains,” Aizawa says, goggles being pulled over his eyes and scarf beginning to levitate. “Thirteen, get the kids out .”

And that’s all the man says before he leaps into the fray, taking down two villains on the way. Izuku watches him go, kicking and punching and never faltering, and he forces himself to wrench his eyes away when Kirishima takes his hand, saying, “Come on, Midoriya, we need to go ,” before pulling him along.

They don’t make it to the entrance. The man of mist appears before them, wispy arms spreading out like he’s a servant come to greet them.

“Greetings, hero hatchlings,” the mist speaks. “I’d like to announce our company formally, to the young who are caught up in our endeavors. We are the League of Villains, and we have one goal today...to kill All Might, and end the reign of the Symbol of Peace.”

No. There’s no way.

Izuku’s mind flashes an image of the black monster with bulging muscles, and he shudders. If there’s a way, it must be that.

“Where is he?” The purple shadow asks. “Our information said All Might would be here, but he’s not present...I wonder if he will show up if we hurt his students.”

“No!” Thirteen shouts, but Kirishima and Bakugou are faster, the redhead ripping away from Izuku to try taking down the mist. Izuku watches with wide eyes as Bakugou sends a massive explosion at the mist.

Only to flinch when the dust dies down, and it’s clear that the man is unscathed.

“You nearly got me,” the mist murmurs, but Izuku can hear it loud and clear. “I see, you truly are the golden egg of heroes. Nevertheless, I do have a task to complete. Farewell.”

“Move!” Thirteen shouts, but it’s too late , and Izuku watches with wide eyes as portals begin to appear underneath the feet of his peers. A few go right away, Kirishima, Bakugou, and Iida all disappearing in their respective circles of purple mist. Izuku darts into the air, flapping his wings and flying over Thirteen’s head at the mist. His mind yells at him, half screaming to attack the villain while the other wants to run. 

“Don’t fight!” Thirteen shouts, making up his mind for him. “Get help !”

Izuku nods, once, and then he swerves around, diving out of the villain’s way and saying, “I will!”

As he soars at the gates, he thinks, ‘ I’ll be back before you know it, just...stay safe, please . ’

He doesn’t know what he’ll do if they get hurt. 

Purple portals begin to appear in the air, but Izuku weaves around them with a practiced familiarity. He hears a grunt in the background, and the portals stop forming, and Izuku doesn’t look back, instead shooting right at the doors and out into the open.

He just hopes that he can be fast enough.

(And as Izuku flies, Bakugou and Kirishima fight their way through a hoard of villains. And as he soars, Asui, Iida, and Sero find their way back to shore. And as he races against time he doesn’t know if he has, his peers are stuck against villains they’re unprepared to fight, unprepared to defeat, and he can only pray that they’ll make it through.)

Izuku spots the window to Nedzu’s office, and doesn’t think before diving right through, glass shattering as he rolls to a stop. When he untucks himself, standing back up, he finds himself with an audience consisting of the principal and an odd, skinny blond man. 

With no time for curiosity or niceties, Izuku blurts out his explanation, frantically saying, “The U.S.J. is under attack. There’s so many villains, Principal Nedzu, we need help .”

Nedzu doesn’t waste time, slamming his hand on a button that makes an alarm ring through the school, a different one from yesterday. 

“I’ll get All Might for you,” the blond man promises, already standing up, and that’s enough for Izuku.

“Midor-” Nedzu starts, but Izuku doesn’t have time to listen, instead shooting through the broken window and flapping his wings as hard as he can, flying right back into danger.

‘ Rumi will be proud, ’ Izuku thinks, and despite it all he smiles for a brief moment, even as he zips right past the Symbol of Peace.

But that smile wipes away the very moment that Izuku gets back inside the U.S.J., because the first thing he sees is that giant creature that makes him shake standing above Aizawa, holding him by the arm.

And then the creature breaks it, and Aizawa lets out a pained sound.

Izuku sees red, because Aizawa is family important. Aizawa is his idol, his teacher, someone who has been nothing but good , and he is hurt .

So it’s of no surprise to Izuku that his instincts finally stop warring, the predator side finally taking over and sending him lunging at the beast, snarling as he spins into a kick that lands true to its neck. 

And it doesn’t move . Not even an inch, not even a touch does it budge. 

If Izuku could focus, could think of anything but his rage, he’d wonder why the hulking creature could take such a strong hit without even stumbling. But he can’t focus, can’t focus on anything but his teacher, his homeroom teacher who is bleeding out on the goddamn floor -

“How interesting,” a raspy voice says, and Izuku’s eyes automatically flicker to the source. The man covered in hands seems to watch him as he tugs at the grip the beast holds on Aizawa, if the way his head is turned is any sort of sign. 

“You’re more than the typical NPC, aren’t you? Flying into action the moment you see someone hurt, how noble .” A hand- a real one- reaches up, the man beginning to scratch his neck in an oddly relaxed way. “I’ll have fun crushing you. Noumu.”

And before Izuku can question who ‘Noumu’ is, he’s being knocked through the air, something cracking as he smacks against the wall of the U.S.J.. The second he looks up, he sees the creature racing at him, and Izuku can only think two things.

The first thought is, ‘ Oh. That’s Noumu. ’

And the second, ‘ At least Aizawa-sensei is out of danger. ’

And just as Noumu grabs Izuku for the second time, the doors slam open. All Might has arrived.

He isn’t smiling, and for some reason, Izuku thinks that’s important to note. 

Izuku blinks, at some point, and in between the time where he closes and opens his eyes, All Might manages to rip him out of Noumu’s grasp, carrying him to the entrance in a single jump. Another blink, and an unconscious Aizawa is placed beside him. Izuku, quite honestly, can’t tell if All Might is moving really quick, or if his eyes are struggling to stay open.

But then he’s watching All Might fight against the Noumu, and he’s shaking as he watches how his peers show up, Bakugou and Kirishima and Todoroki, all to protect All Might from the beast. And he’s keeping an eye on nearby villains, those unconscious and the two that stand at a distance.

The man with the hands and the man of mist, who both watch him.

“I see that All Might is having fun with the anti-symbol,” the hand man says, and Izuku has to strain to hear his words. “So why don’t I have some fun of my own? Kurogiri?”

The man of mist, Kurogiri, responds. “Of course, Shigaraki.” And then a portal is opening up, and Shigaraki hops right through it, and Izuku reacts on instinct alone as he whirls around to protect Aizawa from the man, kicking Shigaraki’s open hand away. 

“Do you have cheats on?” Shigaraki asks, tilting his head as he does. “Your senses are on a higher setting, aren’t they? I wonder if that means your pain receptors are more reactive, too.”

They’re not, but Izuku doesn’t want to find out what the man plans to do. He ducks around the man’s hits, keeping an eye on how the man reaches for him more than punches, hands wide open.

‘ Hand-related Quirk, ’ Izuku decides. ‘ Five point activation, most likely, or he wouldn’t have his fingers spread like that. Something that will cause pain- maybe that’s where some of Aizawa’s injuries came from? ’

For some reason, the gate comes to mind. Turned to dust, but quickly enough that it was able to be fully destroyed without the user getting caught.

Izuku thinks he’s found the source, and he gulps as he just barely dodges the hand that reaches for his face, instead catching on his coat.

Izuku rips off the jacket as it turns to dust around him, throwing it at Shigaraki to distract the man before aiming a kick at his gut, sending him tumbling to the ground. A portal catches him, and Izuku looks for the man, untensing somewhat when he sees that the villain is back by Kurogiri.

“He has cheats!” Shigaraki shouts, only to scream in rage as All Might sends Noumu crashing through the ceiling. “They both do! All Might and his little pet !”

“We should leave,” Kurogiri says, completely ignoring the complaints in a way that Izuku would appreciate if he wasn’t more focused on how the lights seem oddly brighter. The lights are out , aren’t they? So how…

Something else is said, Izuku thinks, because suddenly Shigaraki is racing at All Might, who for some reason is beginning to have steam form around him, and Todoroki sends out a wave of ice as Izuku lifts himself in the air once more to fly at the villain-

Only to stop when a gunshot rings through the air, and Shigaraki jolts back. Another, and another, and Izuku watches as Kurogiri whisks Shigaraki away, the two disappearing as a dozen Pro Heroes enter the scene.

“We’ve brought backup!” Nedzu proclaims, and Izuku sighs in relief, letting his feet touch the ground again only to stumble, vision blurry as he tries to regain his footing. 

‘ My head hurts ,’ Izuku thinks, and he lifts a hand to the back of his head. It’s covered in red when he pulls it back, and Izuku hums.

“So that’s what cracked,” Izuku murmurs, and then his legs give out and he collapses to the ground next to Aizawa, eyes closing before he knows it.

And everything fades away, with the green-haired boy unconscious next to the teacher who has unofficially become a part of his colony. 

-----

Toshinori sits in Recovery Girl’s office, watching over the green-haired boy that sleeps peacefully on one of the beds. He had offered to do so, when Shuzenji had said she needed to step out for a bit. It’s not that young Midoriya needs watching over, necessarily, what with his injuries already healed and nothing needed but some time to rest...but Toshinori cannot help but stick around. 

The boy has definitely left an impression on him, that’s for sure. 

The first time he saw the boy was during the Quirk test Aizawa put them through, and Toshinori had been impressed by his scores and abilities. The boy had shined during the test, and Toshinori could see how he moved with ease with his wings. He was someone to have high hopes for, surely.

And then the second day of school, with the odd introductions that Toshinori couldn’t help but sputter over. The way young Midoriya remained silent for nearly a minute of silence, only to say that he thought Toshinori was All Might, as if it was only a guess, had been puzzling. Toshinori has, admittedly, never met someone in Japan who didn’t recognize him on sight- well, when he’s in his muscle form, of course. So to have this young heroling, who had gotten in on Recommendations, no less, not recognize him.

Well, it had made him more memorable!

But today...today’s actions take the cake. Toshinori can’t decide what was more startling- the way that Midoriya dove right through the glass to get help just a touch quicker; seeing Midoriya face down the Noumu, only to go toe to toe with the leader while All Might was busy with the beast; or how Midoriya collapsed into an unconscious heap the moment the ringleaders disappeared- but he does know that Midoriya’s character has shone today. 

Yes, young Midoriya will be a fine hero. He already has the intelligence, the power, and the personality to back him up. 

If Toshinori is to be honest with himself, the boy would make the perfect successor.

It’s a shame, then, that it’s already too late. His decision has already been made, his old sidekick’s choice having agreed to take the legacy.

If only he had met this boy just one year earlier...oh, the things Midoriya could have done, the Symbol he could have become.

Toshinori will just have to settle for encouraging the boy from the sidelines, and making sure his actual successor can go far as well.

Somehow, he feels like he’s won a consolation prize, and he can’t help but wonder what if .

But what ifs change nothing, and neither will his wishing.

As is life.

 
Notes:

    I hope you enjoyed this chapter! I'm having a lot of fun writing this one out, and I've got a good amount outlined so far.
    However, there are some pieces in the timeline that I'm not completely sure of yet. With that being said, I'm considering finding someone to go over the plot with. So, if there's anyone who doesn't mind the idea of having the story spoiled *well* in advance, and would want to discuss variations of how Skvader could go, leave a comment below! (That said, I'm not sure if I will actually be taking anyone up on the offer. I have a tendency to hoard my favorite plot ideas as a secret, so that I can surprise *everyone*, so I may decide to just do this on my own.)

    Alright, with all of that said, thank you for sticking around for yet another chapter, and I hope to see you soon! <3

Chapter 7: Not Done Yet
Notes:

    Just finished this, and went 'alright, let's throw it onto ao3!'
    Sorry that it took so long to post this, inktober decided to take over more time than I expected! (And it doesn't help that it's been tech week for the play I'm in...which is tonight, oops.)
    Anyways, here's 4k more for you all! I'll see you next chapter! <3

Chapter Text

Not Done Yet

 

Izuku walks into the halls of Yuuei, tired and wondering if he can sleep before class. Not from injuries, no, just training. Since Recovery Girl had healed him before he went back to his handlers, that meant weekend training commenced as usual. The incident at U.S.J., of course, was no reason for them to halt his progress. If anything, it had given them more reason to, as school had been cancelled on Friday because of the attack. 

At the very least, his siblings made sure to steal him away yesterday evening for dinner. It’d been nice, getting to sit down with them and enjoy a meal. Rumi had been proud of him, too, when he’d told them about his version of events.

“A window! You broke through a window!” Rumi crowed, an odd move as she was the only non-bird person in the room. “Izuku, you genius!”

“Good job,” Keigo praised. “You’re already soaring high, little brother.”

Izuku had been on cloud nine from the praise, and the quick flight he went on with Keigo afterwards had only made him feel even lighter.

But now Izuku feels like he’s back down to earth, footsteps dragging more than usual as he slips into 1-A. He’d left earlier, to avoid his handler on the way out. He’d been worried that they’d make him get back into the car, and just...he doesn’t like the car. So getting to school even earlier than usual, even though he was the first one there on Thursday?

It’s worth it. 

Aizawa isn’t in the room, Izuku quickly notes. Which makes sense, he supposes. Aizawa had been hurt , badly, by the time that Izuku returned. There’s a good chance that the man won’t even show, not today. With how exhausted the man always looks, Izuku won’t be surprised if his homeroom teacher decides to just sleep the day away.

It’s a tempting idea, Izuku thinks, and with that thought he sits in his chair, messenger bag dropped to the floor before he curls his knees to his chest and rests his head on his knees, letting his wings wrap around him. 

He’s out in seconds. 

Some time must pass, too, because soon Izuku is being stirred back into consciousness, ears picking up soft conversations that go on around him.

“Look, he looks just like this bird picture!” Ashido whispers loudly, and a cooing noise follows a short silence.

“How is he able to stay up like that?” Kaminari asks. “I’d fall off without something to support me. Is it a bird thing?”

“Probably?” Kirishima responds, and Izuku’s ear twitches when he hears someone stepping closer.

“Oh!” Tsunotori exclaims, voice rising. “He’s waking up!”

Izuku raises his head, blinking the sleep out of his eyes as he unfurls his wings, letting them lay against his back instead. He smiles softly at his friends, and they smile back.

“Good morning!” Tsunotori says when Izuku looks her way, and Izuku hums happily.

“Good morning,” he responds, and then the door slams open.

And Aizawa enters the room. 

Izuku does not binky in his spot. He doesn’t.

Okay, maybe he does. But who can blame him? Aizawa is back, after all! And sure, the man is bandaged up, but he’s here ! 

Aizawa blinks at him, and Izuku stills, freezing as the man stares at him before slowly drawing his eyes away. Izuku curls into his seat ever so slightly, embarrassed at having been caught in his excitement. 

Luckily, Aizawa doesn’t say anything about his instinctual action, instead distracted by the students who ask, “Are you sure you should be here? Shouldn’t you be resting?!”

“I’m able to move, so I’m able to work,” Aizawa says, and Izuku is left wondering if the man can become any cooler. “Besides, you’re not out of the clear. You’re not done yet.”

Izuku blinks in surprise at the panic that grows around him, his peers tensing up. Do they think Aizawa is talking about villains? Would Aizawa even know about an upcoming attack, or-
“The Sports Festival is approaching,” Aizawa finishes.

Oh. 

‘ What the fuck is a sports festival? ’ Izuku wonders, but he keeps his mouth shut as his peers begin to comment.

“So soon? We were just attacked by villains, mon professeur!” Aoyama cries in dismay. 

“This is going to be epic !” Kirishima cheers.

“I’ve watched the Sports Festival for years!” Hagakure cheers. “I’ve always wanted to be in it!”

Oh! Izuku perks up, finally realizing what his peers are talking about. The Sports Festival! Present Mic has talked about it every year on his radio show, and Izuku remembers that because his handler always wanted him to listen to those segments.

“Write down every Quirk you hear him mention.” He’d be advised. “And then break them all down, one by one.”

Izuku would spend hours just analyzing the Quirks Present Mic spoke of, occasionally searching for video proof if there was a really cool one. 

He wonders if his handlers will want him to analyze this year. He wouldn’t be surprised if they expect him to do so while in the middle of it all. He’ll just have to keep his eyes open.

Aizawa hushes the class, quelling their concerns by saying, “There will be five times the security as previous years have had, in light of recent events. You’ll have two weeks to prepare, and there will be gyms open after school. If you want to train in a more specialized gym, you’ll have to go through your class reps. Got it? Good.” He doesn’t wait for a response before turning around, picking up a piece of chalk. 

Just like that, class begins. 

And oh, how class flies by, lessons a blur of note taking and assignments being handed out. The excitement of his peers feels contagious, and Izuku can’t help but flutter when the bell rings for lunch. He gets up, Tsunotori already chattering about how she’s eager to do her best, but the simplicity of the action is cut short.

Because the entrance is blocked, dozens of other students waiting outside of the room. Izuku blinks at the living barrier, then glances up. Technically, he could just...fly over them.

He’s distracted by a purple-haired boy, who makes his way up to the front of the crowd just as Bakugou storms past, calling the others ‘extras’ as he shoves his way out. A few others follow, Kaminari, Ashido, and Sero using his exit as an opportunity to escape. But Izuku doesn’t move, focused on the boy who begins to speak.

“This is what 1-A has to offer?” He asks, voice dry as he scans the room. “I’ll admit, I expected more. But I guess it’s nothing but people like him who make up this group, huh?”

Izuku wants to speak up, and he almost does, but then another voice is cutting through the crowd.

“You must think you’re so high and mighty, having faced down a bunch of villains so soon!” A boy with silver hair and matching eyelashes shouts. “But I never expected you to be such arrogant assholes, making us 1-B kids look so bad!” 

Does….does he think that they’re glad to have been attacked by villains? To...to have seen Aizawa get so hurt, trying to protect them? Do they think Izuku was happy to come back to the U.S.J., only to see his teacher sprawled out on the floor, held down by Noumu?

Is that what they think being a hero is all about? 

Izuku wants to ask him, so so badly. He wants to know if this boy knows that his teacher almost died, if he’d care if he knew Izuku was thrown across a room by a beast created by unnatural causes. He wants to know so much.

But his lips stay shut, and Izuku can only blink at the boy. He doesn’t speak, only staring as the purple-haired one speaks again, saying, “If a student from general education does well enough, they’ll get moved into the hero course. And someone else will get kicked from the course.” His eyes lock with Izuku’s, and Izuku is too cold to react. “Consider that my declaration of war, then.”

And the boy leaves, and the rest of the crowd starts to disperse. Still, Izuku stands, watching on with unseeing eyes as they go. He feels someone take his hand, and his gaze slips over to Kirishima.

“Let’s go to lunch,” Kirishima says, a smile on his face, and Izuku fixes one of his own onto his lips. The redhead drags him away from their classroom and down to the cafeteria, filling the silence with Tsunotori’s eager help. 

Their conversation helps Izuku focus back on the present, and he’s able to genuinely smile as Kirishima leads them to a table.

It’s not their usual table, but rather one a few spots over. Izuku blinks in surprise as he’s pulled into a seat across from Bakugou, Kirishima happily plopping down on his left and Tsunotori sitting on Kirishima’s other side. Ashido, Kaminari, and Sero all greet him happily, and Izuku nods in return. 

“We were in the same zone,” Kirishima explains, and Izuku blinks at the admission. The same zone?

Ah, at the U.S.J..

Izuku watches as the rest of his usual tablemates join the table, no one questioning why they’ve switched away from their normal place. Izuku listens along to the conversations that surround him, occasionally answering when spoken to, but mainly sitting in silence. Across from him, Bakugou is quiet, and almost seems to be ignoring the group.

Still, Izuku thinks it’s a rather nice lunch. And when it comes time for hero training, Izuku is content. 

Training isn’t bad, either. Aizawa is in charge of the lesson today, and he has them doing Quirkless spars. It’s something Izuku is familiar with, his trainers having made sure he’d never be a liability in the event that his Quirk was, well, unavailable.

But it’s nicer, this time. Izuku doesn’t even get told to bind his wings up! And if Aizawa isn’t going to ask him to, Izuku is going to keep mum and not remind his teacher. 

Aizawa doesn’t make anyone bind up their Quirked features, surprisingly, and Izuku can’t help but bounce on his toes with joy at the realization. 

He ends up going against Ojirou, and the blond smiles goodnaturedly as he approaches.

“Ready?” Ojirou asks, and Izuku nods. 

Izuku finds himself enjoying the matches, impressed by Ojirou’s skill level. He’s really experienced, that much is clear in how he moves with perfect forms and puts power into his hits at the right time. The biggest issue, if anything, is that Ojirou has moments where he moves to use his tail, only to pause midway as he remembers that he’s not supposed to.

“Shoot!” Ojirou exclaims as he gets up, Izuku having kicked the boy to the ground during a moment of hesitation. “I’m not used to Quirkless spars.”

“They’re not always the greatest,” Izuku admits, and Ojirou laughs.

“Sensei must have known what he was doing when pitting us against each other! You’re really good, Midoriya, did you go to a gym?”

“I had trainers,” Izuku confirms, and Ojirou hums.

“That’s pretty cool! And they had you practice without your wings?” When Izuku nods, Ojirou asks, “How did you get used to not using them? I use my tail without thinking!”

“They bound my wings,” Izuku says simply, and he can’t help but wonder why Ojirou’s eyebrows furrow at the statement. 

“Oh,” Ojirou murmurs, and then they’re resuming, hopping right back into training.

Izuku never does find out why Ojirou had made that expression.

Training ends, and the day does, too. Izuku is stopped by Iida in the changing room, the spectacled boy saying, “We have a meeting with the 1-B representatives in ten minutes.”

Izuku nods, dressing quickly before following his peer back to their classroom. They sit down, and the 1-B representatives enter the room only a few moments later. The first to enter is a girl with orange hair and blue eyes. The second one is Momo Yaoyorozu, who Izuku recognizes from the Recommendation Exam.

"It's a pleasure to meet you!" Iida proclaims the moment that the two girls enter, standing up and chopping his arm excitedly. "I am Tenya Iida, the Vice Representative of Class 1-A!"

"My name is Itsuka Kendou," the orange-haired girl responds. "I am the Class Representative of 1-B."

"Momo Yaoyorozu," Momo says, voice soft. "Vice Representative of 1-B."

"Izuku Midoriya, the Class Representative," Izuku introduces, feeling somewhat out of place with his meager introduction. But no one makes any comment, and the meeting begins.

The meeting itself is simple, the four simply discussing what days would be best for their classes to have some of the specialized gyms reserved. They go on a back and forth pattern, each class getting a week total for the gyms. Truthfully, it doesn't even take twenty minutes for the four to make their decisions, and Izuku smiles as Kendou and Yaoyorozu stand.

"It was nice to meet you," Kendou says warmly. "I look forward to working alongside you this year."

"You as well!" Izuku says, and Kendou’s smile grows brighter at the response. She turns to leave, Yaoyorozu only a step behind.

"I'd say that our first meeting went well!" Iida declares once the two leave. "I'm glad that there is no anymosity between us, despite the hostility some of the 1-B students offered to us earlier today!"

Izuku grimaces at the reminder, and Iida promptly moves on from the subject.

"I will be heading home now. My family asked me to return straight away. Would you like to walk out together?" Iida turns to Izuku as he asks this, his bag already on and body positioned to walk right out of the door. It's clear that the boy is eager to go home.

Izuku wonders if he's ever been so excited to return to the Commission, to his handlers and trainers and endless lessons and not getting to see his colony for weeks on end at times.

He doesn't have to wonder. He knows the answer well.

"I think I'll stay behind a bit longer, thank you," Izuku says, and Iida accepts this answer and goes on alone.

And Izuku sits in the empty classroom, listening as his peer’s footsteps grow more and more distant, softer and softer until he can’t hear a sound. 

Only when there is nothing but silence in Izuku’s ears does the boy get up, picking up his bag and stepping out of the room. He glances in the direction of the exit.

He goes the other way, deciding that now is the perfect time to explore. With most students not around, already long gone for the day, he’s able to stroll through the halls without worrying about getting into anyone’s way.

And it’s nice, Izuku thinks. The halls are vacant, and Izuku only spots a few students in their classrooms. No one pays him much mind, and he’s able to simply go on his way, letting his feet take him wherever they wish. 

It’s just after Izuku passes the support hall, where he hears what seems to be explosions and

maniacal cackling, that Izuku runs into the skinny blond man from Nedzu’s office. 

The man seems just as surprised to have run into him as he is, letting out a choked cough that makes Izuku worry, because he’s pretty sure that the man just spat out some blood, is he okay?

Is Izuku allowed to ask if the man is okay? 

He also wonders if he’s allowed to ask the man if he’s, somehow, related to All Might...because the longer he stares at the tall man, the more he notices just how many similarities the two share. The hair color, the length that their blond hair is- and really, this man has two long locks that look like All Might’s signature ‘v’ shaped bangs, if the hair were to drop down-, they’re both the same height, they even dress the same way! Honestly, Izuku can’t even tell if he’d rather ask ‘Are you related to All Might?’ or ‘Are you All Might?’, because in this day and age, he wouldn’t even be surprised if All Might can somehow change what he looks like.

With as much of a symbol All Might is, Izuku doesn’t know what the man can and cannot do. So who is he to say what’s a part of the realm of possibilities?

But Izuku knows it’s not his place to ask, not his place to ask any of the things running through his head, so instead he just...stares up at the blond man before him.

And the blond man stares back for a moment, and then he coughs again, this time sounding nervous, before saying, “You made quite an impression, young man.”

Izuku feels his face warm up immediately at the reminder, knowing that the man is thinking of the shattered window. Is he angry?

“Luckily, it was a very good one.”

Oh. That’s good to hear! “Thank you, mister…”

“Ah,” the blond smiles, the expression sheepish. “Just call me Yagi, young man.”

“Alright. Thank you, Yagi!” Izuku smiles back, and the man chuckles.

“It’s good to see passion in the new generations. Keep up the fire, why don’t you?”

“Will do, sir!” Izuku promises, wings fluttering to emphasize his words, and Yagi chuckles again.

“That’s good to hear, young Midoriya. I’ll see you around.” And just like that, Yagi walks away.

Izuku wonders how Yagi knows his name, despite him never having said it.

Again, he chooses not to ask.

Later, when Izuku is asked why he was gone so long, Izuku simply claims that his meeting took a while. His handler nods along, and leaves him to do his homework.

For some reason, the lie feels as relieving as it does condemning. Izuku doesn’t know if he’ll lie again, over something so simple.

Another part of him thinks that he will, and that part is just a bit bigger.

Even so, Izuku cannot help but smile as he sets his sights on his schoolwork.

-----

Momo sits down at her desk, setting her bag on the floor beside her. Quietly, she pulls out the notebook she’d been writing in not half an hour ago, taking notes on the meeting she’d just been in.

Her parents are proud, Momo knows. She’s heard their delight, both to her face and when they don’t know she’s nearby. They’re proud of her, for following in their footsteps. For trying to be a hero, just as they are. Her mother especially so, praising her relentlessly for making it into Yuuei.

Her mother had never gotten in. She had actually met her father, a Yuuei alumni, out on the field during their first years out of school. But her mother had ended up at Ketsubutsu, a school known for creating great heroes out of people with atypical Quirks for the career path. Which was the perfect place for her mother, considering that her Quirk was so...precise.

Momo is lucky, she thinks, to have a Quirk like Creation. It’s rather complex, yes, and it’s reliant on her intelligence being up to par...but she can make anything that she wants. It’s rather close to her father’s Quirk, who could make weapons out of his fat cells so long as he knew the size and material it was to be made of. Her mother, however, had to know the molecular composition of a substance in order to control it. She could not make anything.

That did not stop her mother from becoming a hero, though. She still became a rather great one of her own, with a special move that relies on her ability to control the very elements around her so long as she focuses well enough. And if her mother can’t be stopped, neither can Momo.

And if her mother believes in her, Momo should feel the same way.

Except she doesn’t. She’s not proud like her mother is, she doesn’t fully believe that she’ll make it as well as her parents did. Because her parents are looking at their own past and her future, while Momo is in the present.

And the present isn’t enough . 

She is not enough. 

The first day in 1-B was...rather lackluster, Momo will admit. Their homeroom teacher, Vlad King, had whisked them away to orientation right away. That had lasted hours, and Momo had quickly noticed that 1-A had not even come to the entrance ceremony.

“Where were the 1-A kids?” Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu, a boy who could turn his skin to steel, asked when the ceremony was finally over. And it was Inasa Yoarashi, the boy who controlled wind during the Recommendation Exam and used it to race ahead of his competition, who answered.

“Oh! My buddy, Midoriya, said that their teacher had them do a Quirk test!” 

Momo remembered, then, how the green-haired boy, Midoriya, had spoken with Yoarashi during the exam. 

She left school with a frown that day.

And again on the second day, when she saw a few students enter 1-A. She could not help but be jealous, seeing them go into the class that she had been eager to get into. The class her father had gotten into.

On the third day, they voted for class representatives. And Momo hoped for a chance to prove herself, a chance to show her worth.

She was chosen vice representative. Another girl, Itsuka Kendou, took the top spot. Kendou tried asking if she wanted to have a say in who their three council members would be, but Momo...Momo didn’t care enough to choose. So Kendou chose, and that was that. And then there was the alarm that blared through the cafeteria, and Momo couldn’t help but watch in envy as Midoriya, once again, took center stage.

And then Thursday arrived. And it was calm, and Momo was simply filling out her notes. She’d heard that they’d be having a field trip, that afternoon, and was interested in what it would be.

And then the alarm rang out, a different one. And Vlad King disappeared before Momo understood what was happening.

Then she found out what had happened, and she couldn’t help but wonder. 

Villains had attacked the class of 1-A. The class that Momo had so desperately wanted to be in. 

Momo wondered if she would have been of use, if she would have been able to make it out safe and unharmed. She heard the reports, she knew that only one student was greatly injured, although she didn’t quite know who it was. 

Would she have made a difference? Or would she have been dead weight?

Momo had no clue, and it scared her. 

School resumes on Monday, and Momo took the distraction with eagerness. Vlad King’s announcement of the Sports Festival gave her something to focus on, something new to look forward to. A chance to prove herself to Japan, to show her skill. To tell the world that she is a force to be reckoned with, that she deserved to be in 1-A.

Then there’s the meeting after school. Only she and Kendou went, because they’re just meeting up with the representatives of 1-A.

Truthfully, Momo should have expected to see Midoriya waiting for her. But she hadn’t expected it, and so she couldn’t help but stare in surprise, stilling in the entrance. 

Kendou walked to one of the desks, sitting down and spinning the chair around so that she’d be facing Midoriya and the boy beside him. Momo recognized him, Tenya Iida, the second son of the Iidaten family. 

The top Recommendation student, and a legacy child. That was the face of 1-A.

Momo ran on autopilot, as the meeting commenced, jotting down notes and keeping her gaze off of Midoriya as well as she could. Not that it was always easy, his bold wings and constantly twitching ears were excellent distractors, but Momo was persistent. She left the moment she could, slipping away the moment Iida said the meeting was over.

And now here she is, staring at the notes she can barely remember taking. More focused on ‘what ifs’ and ‘should have beens’ and the boy who seems to have everything she ever wanted. 

The perfect Quirk, simple yet strong. The Recommendation spot in 1-A. A role that shows his worth. 

Midoriya is the picture of what Momo always wanted.

She wonders if she will ever reach his position, or if he’ll continuously fly out of reach, soaring as she sinks.

She hopes that the Sports Festival will be her moment of clarity, both for herself and for others.

Oh, how she hopes...

Chapter Text

Make Your Mark

 

Two weeks pass more quickly than Keigo can soar from the Commission’s main building to his own agency, which, in Izuku’s opinion, is really quick. But the days soar like his brother does, and just like that, Izuku is pulling on his gym uniform, awaiting the start of the Sports Festival. The rest of his peers linger around the room that they’ve been sent to, some in groups, others on their own. Izuku sits in his own corner, content to watch his peers as they hype themselves up or wait patiently for their cue.

And then Todoroki calls his name, walking towards him.

“Midoriya,” Todoroki says, and Izuku turns to face the heterochromatic boy.

“Todoroki,” Izuku responds, standing up as he does so. Todoroki stills, eyes appraising him before he speaks again.

“You may be strong, but I have more power than you,” he states, and Izuku nods because, well, he’s right. Skvader may be a cool Quirk, and Izuku knows that it can be a powerful one- both of his siblings are in the top ten, after all, and the Commission wouldn’t train him so diligently if they didn’t know he’d be able to be something special- but it’ll never truly compare to a powerhouse Quirk like Todoroki’s.

“You’re right,” Izuku admits easily. “But I won’t let something that simple take me down.”

“Good. I look forward to fighting you.”

The bold declaration seems to have garnered the attention of their peers, and Izuku is surprised when Kaminari speaks up, saying, “Oh, shit! It’s a battle for the crown!” 

“Is now really a good time to be starting fights?” Kirishima asks, and Todoroki shrugs.

“I’m here to compete, not to make friends,” the boy states.

“Well then compete with me, freezerbrain!” Bakugou complains. “Why go after the fucking bunny boy?! He’s not even a proper threat.”

Todoroki just blinks at Bakugou, unbothered, and Bakugou seems to grow angrier. So Izuku speaks up, tentatively asking, “Ah, Bakugou, would you like me to challenge you? Since Todoroki didn’t?”

Bakugou huffs, crossing his arms as he says, “Fine! I better see you at the top, you fucking rabbit! Since the fridge is too fucking stupid-”

“It’s the moment you’ve all been waiting for!” Present Mic’s voice cuts through the air, and Izuku sighs in relief. “The Sports Festival of the first years, let’s get these contestants out here!”

“Come on!” Iida cries, pulling open the door, and Izuku follows his peers as they slip through the exit to the tune of Present Mic’s cry.

“The students who faced a hoard of villains and came out on top, give it up for the class 1-A!”

The crowds cheer, wild and free, and Izuku looks at the packed stadium with awe. He’s seen the recordings, of course, and has heard Present Mic talk about the event year after year.

But hearing and seeing are two different things, and Izuku can’t help but stare at the crowd they’ve gotten. 

And then he sees a flash of red, and his eyes widen with delight as he focuses on two figures in particular.

Because sitting in the stands is Keigo and Rumi, there just for him.

Izuku waves at them, preening when they spot him and wave back, completely missing the announcement of the other classes. 

And then Midnight is speaking, pulling his attention away from his siblings. 

“It’s time for the student’s oath!” Midnight says. “From the top scorer of the Entrance Exam, Katsuki Bakugou!”

“The top student from the hero exam,” someone murmurs, and Izuku blinks in surprise. Is that really how it was chosen? Huh.

Nevertheless, Izuku watches as Bakugou walks forward, stepping onto the raised platform and leaning close to the mic. And then, with a calmness that Izuku has never seen in the boy before, he says, “I’m going to win.” A pause. “You’ll all be great stepping stones to my victory.”

Izuku blinks at the uproar, watching as Bakugou shrugs and saunters back down to join the rest of the class. A part of him is amused, because wow , Rumi will get a kick out of a speech like that, he’s pretty sure she’s already laughing.

But another part? 

Well, that part knows that Bakugou just angered all of their opponents, and he can’t help but be nervous.

“Alright!” Midnight exclaims, slashing her whip through the air. “Let’s find out what our first event is, shall we?” 

Midnight gestures to a lottery wheel, then gives it a spin. Izuku watches as it cycles, colors blurring together until finally the wheel stops abruptly, landing on the event of choice.

“Our first event: the Obstacle Course!” 

Instantly, a few of Izuku’s peers let out groans. Izuku, however, is delighted .

Because he knows exactly how this event will go.

-----

Shouta knows exactly how this event will go, and so he sighs and slumps into his chair.

“What’s that sound for, Eraser?” Hizashi asks, and Shouta snorts.

“You’ll see.”

“Ominous! I like it!”

Shouta huffs at that, keeping his eyes on the students as they line up at the starting point. Some cameras reposition, focusing on groups that seem more interesting. 

But when the race begins, Shouta knows exactly who to keep his eyes on. 

Izuku Midoriya, who, as expected….flies over every single thing.

It’s amusing, admittedly, how panicked Hizashi gets the moment he realizes what is happening. Because Hizashi always announces the different sections the moment a student reaches it. And Midoriya is already soaring right through them.

“And here we see Izuku Midoriya of 1-A reach the first obstacle, the Robo Inferno! Will he fight or- oh, he’s already passed them all! Just like that, we see the second part- the Pit! Students will be able to travel by ropes or by traversing from one pillar of rock to the next, just don’t fall!”

“He’s already flying over it, Mic,” Shouta points out, and Hizashi makes a noise that sounds both distressed and excited. 

“Right! And here Midoriya is reaching the third part, the Minefield! And, uh, he’s still flying! Oh, look, he’s nearing the exit! Ladies and gentlemen, in first place we have Izuku Midoriya! I really should have seen that coming!”

“He has wings, what did you expect ?” 

“Who knows!” 

Shouta huffs again, watching how Midoriya waves shyly to the nearest camera now that he’s landed, a bashful yet proud expression on his face. The boy seems to look for someone, and he perks up when he finds them. Glancing into the crowds, he spots a pair of red wings that can only belong to Hawks, and sees Miruko beside him. The two are leaning over the railing, and they seem to be cheering Midoriya on.

It’s the happiest that Shouta has seen his student so far. 

A good change, in his opinion.

Shouta finally looks to the other contestants, tuning back into his husband’s eager commentating, the man now focused on Todoroki and Bakugou as the two compete for second. Behind them trails the rest of 1-A, and further back Shouta can recognize the 1-B students following close behind. A few students from the other departments seem to be making gains of their own, including a pink-haired girl covered in gear, a purple-haired boy who is sitting on another person’s back, and a few others who slip in among the rest. 

And soon enough the round is ending, and Shouta isn’t at all surprised to see that all of his students have advanced to the next round.

He just hopes that the next round will be at least a little challenging to Midoriya.

Then he remembers what the next event is, and he sighs.

The Sports Festival, apparently, is a challenge to anyone who can’t fly.

And those who can...well…

The event speaks for itself, honestly.

Kami, Shouta needs a nap.

-----

Izuku vibrates with leftover glee from his win. Sure, it hadn’t been especially impressive, but he knows his handler won’t be upset. She’s always engrained efficiency into his head, getting the most out of the least! Showmanship comes second to surviving, after all, and Izuku had given the cameras a smile for her sake even when he’d rather flinch away.

But all in all, he’s happy. And his siblings are cheering him on! They had even chatted with him while he waited for the other forty-one open slots to be taken by others, singing his praises and telling him, in their words, to ‘kick ass and take names’. 

And when Midnight announces that the next round will be a Cavalry Battle, Izuku has an idea.

“Two to four people,” Izuku murmurs, eyes scanning the students around him. “Two to four.”

Izuku isn’t foolish; he knows that most of the contestants will be trying to take him down. He’s worth ten million points, after all, it makes sense to try to fight him. His headband alone will be an automatic guarantee for first place, and not many will want to join him. Not when everyone else sees him as a target.

Izuku has two options. The first is to fight everyone head on, doing his best to avoid losing his points while actively hunting down more.

The second is to flee, staying out of reach. And what better place to flee than in the air, where only a few will be able to reach him?

The rules only said that a team has to be two to four people, and that he can’t get out of bounds or have the rider fall off. 

So if the rules say two to four, Izuku will follow their minimum, and keep himself safe.

Mind made up, Izuku turns around, looking for the perfect teammate. Someone light enough that he can carry them for the entire ten minute round, yet strong enough to defend where he cannot. Preferably someone who can be ranged or up close, considering that Izuku’s arms will be full from carrying them.

He spots the perfect person, and lights up with a grin.

-----

Tenya moves to follow Midoriya, an idea in his head. He knows most people are avoiding Midoriya, afraid of the amount of points that he carries and becoming a target, but Tenya believes that they, together, would be able to avoid danger while still being able to gather more points if they wished. After all, Tenya and Midoriya are the fastest students in 1-A, and his peer is light enough that he’d have no issue carrying the teen. With two others, they could become the most impressive group, easily securing a win.

A pink-haired girl reaches Midoriya first, getting in his personal space as she shows her inventions to him. Tenya chooses to stay back, as is polite, content to simply watch and see what Midoriya chooses to do. If Midoriya accepts the offer that she is obviously making, then he is sure that they’ll be able to make a plan that includes her. She seems to have well-made gear, which wouldn’t hurt to have, surely. And if Midoriya declines her, well, Tenya has a few people in mind that they could pick. 

After a moment, the girl nods and walks away, apparently taking rejection in stride, and Tenya takes the chance to approach.

“Midoriya!” Tenya calls, and Midoriya’s eyes dart up to meet his. “Would you like to team up with me, and be partners for the Cavalry Battle?”

Midoriya smiles at him, that small, shaky smile that seems to appear on his classmate’s face more often than the wide grin that Tenya will sometimes see.

But then he shakes his head.

“Thank you, Iida,” Midoriya says. “But I’ll have to decline. I already have a plan.”

“I see,” Tenya says, and he cannot help but be impressed. Only a few minutes have passed, but it seems that Midoriya already has a fully-fledged plan. As expected, of the boy who became Class Representative! “Well, then I look forward to being your rival! I do hope that I will be able to prove a proper challenge to you, Midoriya.”

Midoriya offers another small grin, and then races off. Tenya notes how his peer automatically heads towards Tokoyami, then heads off to find his own team.

Todoroki makes a fine teammate, even if not the most amiable one.

Still, Tenya will do his best.

-----

Ten seconds remain before the second round begins. Students race to get into position, riders getting in place and fastening their headbands securely, lest they fall off.

Nine, and the camera flickers from group to group, showing the different teams.

Eight. Katsuki Bakugou lets out a shout, drawing eyes to his group. He is the rider, his teammates Eijirou Kirishima, Mina Ashido, and Hanta Sero.

Seven. Next the camera looks to Shouto Todoroki, who is supported by Denki Kaminari and Tenya Iida. It seems that they could not find a fourth member in time, or perhaps did not want one.

Six. The view flickers to a group not from 1-A. Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu, Ibara Shiozaki, Itsuka Kendou and Hitoshi Shinsou. The 1-B students look oddly dazed as the 1-C boy is held in their grasp as their rider.

Five. Pony Tsunotori is on all fours, Tooru Hagakure on her back.

Four. Mashirao Ojirou, Juzo Honenuki, Neito Monoma and Yuga Aoyama are together. They seem to be debating whether or not Honenuki can be counted as a true blond, or simply an ‘honorary’ one for the event.

Three. Inasa Yoarashi and Yosetsu Awase hold up Momo Yaoyorozu, who has her eyes trained on a group out of sight. 

Two. A group of three make up a group, two girls and a boy. The boy is passing a piece of gear to the other ‘horse’, who seems nervous as she slips it on. A girl with wings sits on their back. This trait makes people remember the boy worth ten million points, and the cameras flicker to…

One. Izuku Midoriya holds onto Fumikage Tokoyami’s back, wings flared out like he’s protecting his teammate.

Zero. The second rounds begin, and everything turns to madness.

-----

Keigo perks up as the fight begins, watching with eagerness as the first years begin to turn on each other. The only one who hadn’t gone to a hero school- or, really, a school at all -, Keigo has never gotten to experience things like the Sports Festival. 

But oh, is he enjoying this one. 

The kids are feisty, he’ll give them that. And Keigo can recognize who some of them are from Izuku’s recollections. The girl who runs on all fours must be Tsunotori, the girl who seems to have taken Izuku on as a close friend. The redhead is clearly Kirishima, the boy who helped Izuku when he was scared during the first week. The tall boy with the wind Quirk is Yoarashi, the boy had texted Izuku a bit during their last dinner. Here and there, Keigo can spot the people Izuku has grown to care for.

And he recognizes the teachers who are in the announcer’s booth, too. The loud one is clearly Present Mic, but Keigo would know that no matter what. He knows how long Izuku has listened to the man, and has spent multiple hours hearing it in the background because Izuku wanted to hear the newest segment. 

Aizawa, however, is a new voice. 

But not a new name. Because Izuku has made the man one of his icons, and Izuku has never been afraid to share his interests with him or Rumi. If that means sitting through excited ramblings about how nonchalant and unabashed the teacher is, then Keigo is happy to listen.

Kami knows the boy doesn’t get to ramble often. Keigo doesn’t, either. 

And as Aizawa speaks, offering the occasional comment thanks to Present Mic’s prompting, Keigo can also tell that the man is not as uncaring as he acts. His comments are well-placed, understanding his students and their actions in the way that a teacher could not if they did not pay attention to their pupils. 

Keigo is glad that Izuku has such a good teacher. His little brother deserves all of the good that he can get.

“Keigo!” Rumi shouts, pointing at a girl with wings. “Look! She just stole all of the bands from a team!” 

Keigo laughs, his sister’s energy infectious. He lets his thoughts turn away from the path they’d gone down, instead enjoying the hustle and bustle of the Cavalry Battle.

And then he laughs again as a blond boy shoots himself in the air with explosions, knowing exactly where he’s heading.

And knowing that the boy won’t get what he’s after, not when he’s after Izuku’s points.

But it’ll still be fun to watch!

------

“Enjoying the weather?” Izuku asks, as chaos reigns below. Tokoyami looks up at him, exasperation evident on his face.

“It is a mad banquet of darkness below us,” Tokoyami says. “And Bakugou is approaching on our left.”

“Right!” Izuku looks at the shadowy Quirk that circles around them. “Dark Shadow, if you would?”

“My pleasure!” Dark Shadow crows, and Izuku giggles as Dark Shadow dive bombs Bakugou, forcing the boy to drop back to his group. Dark Shadow cackles, an odd sound but pleasant despite its abnormalities. 

Izuku thinks that the second round is rather peaceful, all things considered.

Although that may just be because the war is beneath him.

Oh well.

-----

The fight ends, and Shouto is only in second place. Second place for the first round, and now he’s taking the same spot once again.

He can feel his father’s anger from here, and he doesn’t like it. 

Endeavor wants him to be better. To use his fire. To become the ultimate weapon, someone to take All Might’s spot as the Number One Hero since he, himself, could not.

And yet Shouto refuses to use that half, and as such is stuck in second place.

And so far, it is Midoriya, his opponent, who comes out on top.

Shouto doesn’t know what compels him to approach Midoriya, but he does.

“We need to talk,” he says, and Midoriya obliges, withdrawing from his friends, following him passively. They move to an empty room, and Shouto moves to the opposite wall. He notices how Midoriya keeps his distance, but isn’t hurt by the fact.

Midoriya seems to keep his distance from anyone he is not close to, after all.

Shouto watches as Midoriya eventually settles, wings tucking behind his back and ears no longer

flicking this way and that. The green-eyed boy stares up at him, attentive and curious. The emotion is clear in his gaze, even if he doesn’t vocalize it.

He reminds Shouto of himself, in an odd way. Silent, not speaking until spoken to...but Midoriya is cheerier, happier, full of hope and wonder. 

Similar, but not the same . It’s a bitter understanding, how little they are alike. How Midoriya seems like him, if only he didn’t have to worry quite so much, and didn't have all of the same steps taken beforehand. It drives Shouto to speak, words falling from his mouth with a restlessness Shouto has never fully known before.

“You’re always out of reach, aren’t you? Getting first for both events, maintaining your position at leagues ahead of me… it’s a pattern of yours, huh? You placed first on the Recommendation Exam. You were first during the test Aizawa-sensei gave us on the first day. When the villains attack, you were the one to act first, and the one to face the biggest threats as soon as you saw them.” Midoriya, oddly, turns red at the statements, as if it’s praise instead of pure fact. 

His reaction isn’t relevant, not yet at least.

“You’re like an All Might of your own style,” Shouto decides. “Right beyond my grasp...but I will take you down with only my mother’s ice. I will prove to my father that I don’t need his fire to be a hero.”

Midoriya’s expression changes, and for a moment Shouto doesn’t understand why he looks so lost until Midoriya softly utters, “Fire?”

Shouto blinks at Midoriya, who blinks right back.

“I...you did say you know my father is Endeavor, didn’t you?” Shouto asks, and Midoriya blinks again.

“Yes? Do...do you have a temperature regulation Quirk?” Midoriya asks, and it’s clear to Shouto that he still doesn’t get it .

Oddly enough, Shouto wants Midoriya to understand what he’s saying, to explain the reason he’s going to become a hero with his mother’s half alone.

Because Midoriya is two steps to the left, maybe, of who Shouto has become, but maybe he will still understand .

And that’s why Shouto asks, “Have you ever heard about Quirk marriages?”

The look he gets in response...Shouto looks away.

“My father has always wanted to be the Number One Hero,” Shouto says, eyes trained on the clock as he speaks. “But as time went on, he quickly realized that he couldn’t surpass All Might. His Quirk just...wasn’t strong enough for the job. So...so he married my mother. Practically bought her away from her family. She had a strong ice Quirk, powerful.”

“My eldest brother wasn’t strong enough. He had a better fire Quirk than my father, one that burned hotter….hotter, too, than his body could handle. My sister got a weak ice Quirk. My next sibling didn’t manifest a Quirk at all...and then there’s me.” Shouto clenches his hands, shutting his eyes. “I got both halves. My mother’s ice, my father’s fire. I was everything he wanted. His perfect tool, the ultimate weapon built and trained for the sake of becoming the best. But...I refuse to use his fire. I refuse to be what he wants, not when he is the reason my own mother hated me, rejected me, scarred me.” Shouto lets his hand rise up, tracing over the long familiar scar around his eye. “I will not be his tool, and I will rise to the top with my mother’s ice alone .” 

Shouto finally looks at Midoriya, who is still staring at him with an unwavering gaze. Meeting green eyes with his own, he states, “And that is why I have to beat you. Because if you are the All Might of our grade, then beating you shows that I will never need him or his Quirk.”

Midoriya makes an odd sound, something that Shouto can only compare to a bird crooning. And then, gently, Midoriya says, “I- I haven’t gone through a life quite like that. I don’t know much about my parents, but if your training has been like mine, and your father is like my handler...it’s tiring. It feels like you’re just...constantly expected to be better, at a rate that feels almost impossibly terrifying. Right? But...I think there’s one thing I don’t understand. Your Quirk. It’s not your parents’. It’s yours , Todoroki. Unless your parents can somehow activate your Quirk, or manipulate the output? I...sorry, that may have been insensitive. I just...it’s up to you, to decide what you plan to do. But I think your father has no say in what you do, and you should...you should do what seems best to you.”

Midoriya looks bashful when he finishes speaking, face darkening once more before he turns away, feathers ruffled as he says, “I’m going to go head to lunch. I’ll see you in the tournament?”

Shouto watches as Midoriya exits the room, shutting the door behind him with a nearly inaudible click. And Shouto stands there, thinking over what his peer has said.

“It’s yours , Todoroki.”

“Do you have a temperature regulation Quirk?”

“You should do what seems best to you.”

Midoriya’s words resonate in Shouto’s heart, but he doesn’t know what to do with them. 

Shouto thinks, though, that he’ll keep them tucked away, kept for when they count.

He doesn’t know what to think about the fact that Midoriya has been trained , too...or the fact that Midoriya has a handler .

He wonders who truly has it worse. He wonders what Midoriya’s story is, why the boy is so skittish and silent despite having such great power.

And a bit of him is afraid to know the answer.

Shouto takes a deep breath, clears his mind, and heads to the cafeteria.

The third round is on its way, and Shouto has to be prepared.

Chapter Text

Show Them What You’ve Got

 

The world began not with a crash, but with a bang . So, too, does the third round of the Sports Festival, with a blank being shot into the air for dramatic purposes and the match beginning.

But before Katsuki Bakugou can move, Hitoshi Shinsou speaks. 

“So, you’re the representative of what the Hero Course has to offer, huh?” Tilting his head, Shinsou asks, “What, they couldn’t find anything better than a yappy pomeranian with an obnoxious bark?”

Shinsou smirks.

And Bakugou falls for the trap.

“Hah? What the fuck did you say you little-”

Bakugou falls silent, eyes going blank as he stands still. 

“Walk out of bounds calmly,” Shinsou says, and Bakugou heeds his command.

And just like that, the first battle reaches its conclusion.

What a way to start.

-----

Izuku doesn’t know why Bakugou wandered out of bounds the moment the match began, but he’s pretty sure it’s because of his opponent’s Quirk. Izuku recognizes the purple-haired boy from a few weeks ago, when the boy had given his declaration of war, so to speak. Izuku isn’t surprised that the boy ended up in general education- he’s too scrawny to fight robots, it’s clear that the boy was planning to rely on his Quirk but couldn’t- but it is a shame.

Luckily, it seems that Shinsou plans to earn his spot in the Hero Course. He’s done well, making it so far in the Sports Festival. Actually….

Izuku glances at his notebook, where he sketched out the tournament roster. Sixteen names cover the page, in pairs for the first round of fights.

There are nine students from 1-A. Six students from 1-B.

And Hitoshi Shinsou is the only student from a nonhero course. 

It’s impressive on its own, the fact that Shinsou has come so far. Without any formal training, he’s at a disadvantage. Despite this, however, Shinsou is making his way through the ranks with a Quirk that isn’t the typical powerhouse one that most people are eager to see.

Izuku is more than able to make up any lack of interest, luckily, and he looks forward to seeing how far Shinsou will make it. 

But there are seven more matches until the 1-C student has another match, and so Izuku tunes in as Present Mic announces the second round of opponents.

Kirishima and Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu. The boy who had called their class arrogant, who had assumed that they were happy to be attacked by villains.

Izuku isn’t a spiteful person. With that said, he hopes that Kirishima wins.

And perhaps a small part of him, too, hopes that Kirishima will crush his competition.

But the match is a slow one, a fight that draws out as an immovable object meets an immovable object. They end in a tie, and Present Mic announces that a tiebreaker will be done at the end of the first round. Izuku has no doubts that Kirishima will win in the end, and is content as the third match begins.

At ease, Izuku watches with attentiveness as Todoroki faces off against Ibara Shiozaki, a girl with vines for hair that she’s able to control.

It’s a bad match from the start.

And it only lasts twenty seconds.

“Todoroki has trapped Shiozaki in a glacier!” Present Mic announces, and Izuku wonders if it was necessary to point it out, because, well... .

Quite bluntly, it’s impossible to miss the giant mass of ice that surrounds Shiozaki.

He wonders what the repercussions of that act are, and a single glance at Todoroki shows that the boy is shivering, his right hand shining with frost. Izuku twitches at the sight, and there’s a part of him that urges him to get up, to go to Todoroki and ask ‘why aren’t you using your fire? It’s just hurting you, to do this.’

But…

No. Izuku will just have to hope that he and Todoroki both make it far enough to go against one another as opponents. Maybe, maybe , he will be able to help Todoroki through his doubts. 

A quick glance at his roster tells Izuku otherwise, and Izuku worries for his peer.

But what can he do?

Izuku doesn’t have a clue.

“Up next,” Present Mic starts, and Izuku emerges from his thoughts. “We have the boy who can get in and out of any sticky situations, Hanta Sero of the Hero Course! And against him we have Inasa Yoarashi, one of the Recommendation students of the Hero Course!”

Izuku chirps with delight as he sees Yoarashi walk up to the arena, the tall male giving a quick bow to Sero before Midnight calls for the match to begin.

And oh , how it begins! Sero makes the first move, eager and ready as he lets out a reel of tape, aiming to hit Yoarashi. But Yoarashi is fast, and he is powerful, and Izuku grins as Yoarashi sends out a gust of wind, whipping the tape away. 

And then Yoarashi is moving, quick and ready as he whisks himself into the air and across the arena floor, crashing right into Sero before using a larger blast of air to send Sero tumbling over the boundary lines.

“Hanta Sero is out of bounds!” Midnight cries out, looking delighted by the quick pace of that match. “Inasa Yoarashi advances to the next round!”

Yoarashi moves over to Sero, helping him up before the two walk off, and Izuku leaps out of his seat the moment that Yoarashi disappears from view. He races out of the 1-A seating section, missing the confused looks of his peers and barely catching Present Mic’s voice as he announces that the next fight is between Yosetsu Awase and Itsuka Kendou.

Izuku darts down to the waiting rooms, finding Yoarashi walking down the halls. 

“Midoriya!” Yoarashi cheers. “I won!” 

“You did!” Izuku agrees, tongue just a little bit looser than normal as he responds without much prompting at all. “Congratulations!” He’s glad for his friend, truly! It’s nice to see that the boy is excelling in 1-B, even if they do not get to see each other often due to their different classes.

“It was your text,” Yoarashi jokes, holding up his phone, and Izuku giggles. 

“A single good luck text isn’t more important than all of your hard work,” Izuku denies, but Yoarashi shakes his head energetically.

“Nope! Must have been the text! Here, I’ll prove it!” And just like that, Izuku’s phone buzzes. “Go on! Open it and see!”

Izuku does so, smiling at the text that reads, ‘ Good luck!!! ’

Izuku giggles again, turning his phone back off and slipping it into his pocket. “Thank you,” he says, and Yoarashi nods.

“Yeah! Come on, let’s go back to the matches! Yours isn’t until the end, right?”

“Right!” Izuku confirms. “There are still three more matches to go!”

“And just like that, Kendou takes the win, slapping her opponent right out of bounds! Ooh, that’s bound to leave a mark!” Present Mic exclaims, and Izuku blinks.

“Ah. Make that two matches?”

“Two matches!” Yoarashi confirms, and together they head to the 1-B section, gaining a few odd looks.

“Isn’t your section right there?” A boy with braided black hair asks, pointing to the divider that separates 1-A and 1-B, and Izuku nods. Blinking, the boy shrugs, turning away. Izuku turns his gaze away as well, watching as the next two people enter the stadium.

“Oh, it’s Yaoyorozu’s turn!” Yoarashi points out. “She was in my team! And look, that’s your teammate, Midoriya!”

And it is. Izuku watches as Tokoyami stands across the field from Yaoyorozu, both with determined expressions on their faces.

“Start!”

The moment the word is shouted, Dark Shadow springs forth, rushing straight at Yaoyorozu the second Tokoyami points in her direction. And Yaoyorozu reacts quickly, a shield manifesting, being created out of her arm. She blocks the Quirk’s first blow, and the second, and the third.

But each time, she is knocked back. Further and further, the shadow sends her reeling, and Izuku realizes that Dark Shadow is trying to knock her back, rather than simply harm her.

By the time that Yaoyorozu has made a staff, it’s too late. 

She’s already been pushed out of bounds.

-----

“Momo Yaoyorozu has been knocked out of bounds!” Midnight cries out, and Momo wants to cry. “Fumikage Tokoyami advances!”

She...lost. 

Weeks of training, of pushing herself to the limit.

And it was for nothing. Absolutely nothing , because Momo lost right when it mattered most.

Her peers congratulate her for getting so far, when she returns to her seat. They’re impressed by how she managed to get into the third round at all, especially since only six of their class managed to do so. And so does Midoriya, who, for some reason, sits in the 1-B section, offering her a bright smile and a cheerful thumbs up.

It feels...mocking. Like they never expected her to even reach the third event. Does it surprise them that she managed to do so? Is it really worth celebrating, when she couldn’t even defeat her first opponent?

Momo feels foolish, and she turns to watch the match.

In the arena, there are two students from 1-A. Present Mic announces them as Mina Ashido and Denki Kaminari.

And when the match begins, Momo can’t help but frown. Because the boy, Kaminari, incapacitates himself at the very start. He overwhelmed himself, letting loose a giant electric attack that apparently left him temporarily brain dead. When Ashido is able to simply nudge him out of the ring, Yaoyorozu can’t help but feel bitter.

How could someone with such poor control of their Quirk get into 1-A, while she was stuck in 1-B? If she had gone through the normal Entrance Exam and passed, would she have that boy’s spot? Or would they still put her in 1-B, because he had a flashier, more exciting Quirk?

Midoriya leaves the section, drawing Momo’s attention, and he appears a few moments later in the arena below, facing off against Iida. 

The class representative up against his vice. Momo has a feeling that she knows who will win. 

And he does. Iida may be fast, with a great Engine Quirk that allows him to move at impressive speeds, but Midoriya is faster and can fly. And fly he does, soaring out of reach before swooping in low, a well-timed drop enough to trip Iida up, sending him sprawling. From there Midoriya pins the boy, swift and merciless.

It’s not one of the quickest matches, and yet it is impressionable. Impressive. 

Momo looks away when Midnight announces the boy’s victory, and slips away as the second round begins.

She decides that she needs some fresh air.

She knows that it is not true, but she is far too upset to care if anyone else realizes the truth.

-----

The second round begins, and ends, as quickly as the first round of the third event did. Shouto watches as Kirishima passes by, clearly disappointed but still not upset as he goes. Despite having lost to the boy from 1-C, the redhead still smiles as he walks back to the 1-A seats.

Shouto doesn’t understand, but he supposes that he doesn’t have to.

Right now, all he has to do is focus on winning.

“And here we see a battle of two Recommendation students!” Present Mic announces as Shouto walks out into the open air. The stadium roars around him, the hero’s voice surpassing them thanks to his microphone and Quirk. “From class 1-A, we have the ice prince Shouto Todoroki! And from 1-B, the one who can sweep you off of your feet, Inasa Yoarashi!”

Yoarashi smiles at him, when Shouto approaches. 

“Best of luck to us both,” Yoarashi says. “May the best man win!’

Shouto doesn’t bother with a response, instead moving into a ready stance as Midnight calls for the match to begin. 

Not having to be told twice, Shouto swipes out his right hand, a wave of ice following the motion. And that should be it, Shouto assumes. That should be the end of the match.

But then the ice shatters, and Yoarashi grins a dangerous grin at him.

“Did you know that even a little bit of wind could shatter glaciers?” Yoarashi asks, tilting his head. “Midoriya taught me that one! The right amount of force, in a small, central point… why waste strength when I can shatter through either way?” 

Shouto sends a larger attack, spikes of ice jutting into existence. This time, Yoarashi sends a much stronger blast of wind.

“Flashiness matters too, though!” is all Yoarashi says. “So let’s go big or go home, huh?” 

That’s the only warning Shouto is given before Yoarashi goes on the offense, whipping up gusts and sending them in Shouto’s direction, pushing him back and forcing him to make a wall of ice behind himself, if only to stay within bounds. Yoarashi is relentless, destroying glacier after glacier, entire walls of ice decimated into nothing in seconds. 

He’s cold. He’s so cold. He can feel that he’s slowing down and none of his attacks are hitting, and Yoarashi hasn’t looked phased whatsoever. 

An especially strong attack sends Shouto stumbling, and for a moment Shouto concedes, is ready to give in and give up.

And then a shout can be heard from the stands, from a voice that Shouto has only heard rise once before, back when the students of Yuuei were panicking from an alarm.

A voice that holds a passion, a conviction, a belief that Shouto has never heard in that voice before.

“Todoroki!” Midoriya shouts, and Shouto spares a glance at the green-haired boy. In a single glance he sees the boy’s ferocity, wings flared wide as he leans over the railing, all pretenses forgotten as he declares, “It’s your fire!”

He looks like a spark, wild and determined, and Shouto...Shouto remembers.

“Mama,” Shouto said, once, when it was just him and his mother, sitting on the couch. “Mama, I want to be a hero.”

“Then become one,” his mother said, and Shouto had frowned.

“But...but I have dad’s fire. And Natsuo says dad’s fire isn’t good, and you’ve said that, and-”

“Shouto,” his mother cut in, voice soft but steady. “Shouto, the fire you hold isn’t your father’s. It’s your fire, Shouto, and no one else can control if and when you use it.”

Shouto ignites, and for once he feels wild and free . The ice melts around him, off of him, and Shouto grins widely, reveling in how Yoarashi grins back.

“That’s what I’m talking about!” Yoarashi cheers. “Let’s go, like men! No! Like heroes !”

Shouto obliges, sending a wave of fire at the boy, one that’s met with an even larger blast of air. The fire is dispelled, but Shouto simply sends another.

Blow after blow, wave after wave, Shouto feels like he’s on cloud nine. In the back of his mind, he can hear his father, but louder still is Midoriya’s cheers. The boy is louder than ever before, and Shouto focuses on that.

And even when Yoarashi surpasses him, with a blast so strong that it knocks Shouto right past the boundary line, too fast for him to catch himself with ice...Shouto is proud, happy, and feeling untethered at long last.

He may not have passed the second round, but he still feels like a champion as he walks to the exit.

And for now, that is plenty.

-----

Izuku slumps into his seat, wings drooping as he slouches. Kirishima chuckles beside him, patting him on the back.

“Man, it’s always so epic to hear you get so pumped up!” Kirishima says. “Gets me all hyped!”

“Got Todoroki hyped, too!” Kaminari points out. “I didn’t even know he could use fire! Talk about strong !”

“I’m surprised that you were so loud,” Asui says. “You don’t raise your voice often.”

Izuku offers a small smile to the frog girl, because he has no good explanation.

(How could he explain that he’s not supposed to yell? That he’s not allowed to, not at the place he resides in. Not when that would be disruptive and annoying and impolite. Not when he’s not even expected to speak, most of the time.)

(There is no way, so Izuku just widens his grin.) 

“Ooh, look!” Tsunotori cheers. “The next round is starting!”

And it is, with Tokoyami going up against Kendou. Izuku glances at the girl, taking a second to recall her Quirk- Big Fist, which allows her to, well, enlarge the size of her hands- before standing up.

Already knowing that Tokoyami will win, Izuku decides to head to the waiting room. And indeed, Tokoyami passes by a few moments later, looking satisfied and proud as he goes, feathers ruffled gleefully.

And Izuku goes out to face Ashido.

The fight isn’t hard, admittedly. Not when Izuku can fly out of his opponent’s range, gliding around her acid attacks and sending her spinning in circles. All that it takes is one shot, a good kick that sends her flying, flying right out of bounds as she slips on her own acid.

It’s almost disheartening.

But mainly, it’s relieving.

Because Izuku can at least guarantee that he’s in the top four, which means that, no matter what, he won’t be punished too harshly should he fail in the future.

Still, Izuku can only hope that he continues to succeed, so that he doesn’t have to face whatever reprimands come if he does anything else.

Because there would be consequences, and Izuku knows this well.

He always has.

-----

Hitoshi lives, and will likely die by the phrase, ‘if it’s not broken, don’t fix it.’

Sure, maybe that’s lazy, but hey. It got him through the first two events of the Sports Festival, and now it’s carried him through three of the four rounds of the one-on-one competitions alone.

To be fair, it helps that he’s been up against talkative people. With that mouthy explosive boy in the start, and then the friendly redhead, and now the loud and proud airhead...yeah, Hitoshi hasn’t struggled much so far.

Now he just has to watch, wait, and see who will be victorious. Because whoever comes out on top is his opponent, and that is the deciding factor on what lines Hitoshi has to say in order to coax a reply out of his enemy.

It’s between the emo bird and the bunny bird boy. For one, Hitoshi would probably just have to make an edgy, depressing comment. But for the green one?

Honestly, Hitoshi can’t get a good read on him. He’s too fast in his fights, too quiet most of the time. But then he’s shouting from the stands to cheer on his peer, and...yeah, Hitoshi doesn’t have a damn clue what to say.

But it seems like the boy is the victor, with the shadow wielder thrown out of bounds. Great…

Then Hitoshi notices how the boy moves over to his opponent the moment the match is ended, helping the raven stand. 

Huh...so if a greeting doesn’t work, a comment on his class probably will.

Hitoshi just hopes that it’ll work.

After all, Izuku Midoriya is the only thing standing in his way to a complete victory, a guaranteed way to get into the Hero Course.

It’s not like Midoriya needs the win, anyways. The boy is already in the course, what more could he want?

-----

Izuku shifts nervously as he waits for Present Mic’s cue, ear flicking back and forth as he listens intently. 

There’s only one match left, and then everything is over. 

“And here we have the final match, the moment you’ve been waiting for!”

For better or for worse.

Izuku steps out into the open.

“The underdog who we don’t know much about, the mysterious Hitoshi Shinsou from 1-C!” Shinsou walks with a casual gait, hands tucked into his pocket as he ambles up. It’s a far cry from Izuku’s tense walk.

“And on the other side, the Recommendation student who has soared to great heights, leaving everything behind him, our first place champion of the first two matches, Izuku Midoriya from 1-A!”

The crowd cheers for them both, willing them to do their best. Izuku can see the way that Keigo and Rumi wave to him from the stands, a beacon of belief.

“Start!” Midnight cries, and Izuku flies up into the air, eyes tracking Shinsou’s every move. 

And Shinsou, for his part, tilts his head, a wry smile on his face as he says, “Right into action, huh? Well, aren’t you the poster child of heroics!” 

Izuku doesn’t speak, instead swooping down into a lunge. Shinsou darts to the side, stumbling over himself ever so slightly as he does so. Izuku lunges again, twisting to try grabbing the boy, but it seems that Shinsou is a good dodger. 

“Silent, huh?” Shinsou asks. “I guess you aren’t as foolish as your friends, who all make the same mistakes less than a minute into each match.”

“They’re not foolish ,” Izuku says, and that is his mistake.

The world goes fuzzy, and Izuku feels his limbs lock up. For a moment, all Izuku can see is the victorious smirk on Shinsou’s face.

Then he falls to the ground, because he stopped flapping his wings, and the fuzziness breaks away abruptly.

Shinsou blinks at him, surprised, before murmuring, “Yeah, I should have expected that.”

Izuku stands, and Shinsou fixes his expression, donning an annoyed look. “So you’re that much of a golden child, huh?” He asks, and Izuku bristles before catching on to the panicked undertone in the boy’s words, fear growing with each additional step that Izuku takes. “Got a great Quirk like that, yeah? That lets you do anything you want, no matter what? I saw how you shot through the rounds, flying ahead of everyone else! It must be so easy, for someone like you. Did you even need to train to get where you are, or did you just breeze right through the exam, too?”

Izuku narrows his eyes, but holds his tongue. It’s a verbal response, he knows now, that Shinsou needs. 

“You don’t know what it’s like!” Shinsou cries out as Izuku continues to advance. “To have to fight for what you want, to have it all held right out of reach!”

The comment resonates, somehow, but Izuku can’t figure out why. He continues to walk, only a few yards away. Calm and steady, he knows better than to speak. Shinsou doesn’t know him, he doesn’t know what to say.

Shinsou knows enough, apparently, because he says, “Yet for how high and mighty you are with your Quirk, you still let your homeroom teacher get so hurt.”

And that is the straw that breaks Izuku.

Izuku growls at the comment, feathers ruffling as he moves into a fighting stance.

And just like that, the world goes fuzzy once again.

“Holy fuck,” Shinsou murmurs, a distant sound in Izuku’s ears. “I can do that? I can take control of people for making noise instead of words?!”

Meanwhile, all Izuku can think is, ‘ Holy fuck I can do that? I can growl ?! ’ Where did he get that ability from? Is the growl a bird thing, a rabbit thing...or is that just a human thing? Do...do humans growl normally? Izuku has never heard a human growl, and ah, it feels really weird to refer to people as ‘humans’ instead of, well, people.

His internal crisis- can it be labelled as a crisis, or merely a revelation?- is cut off by Shinsou’s voice, his opponent commanding, “Turn around and carefully walk out of bounds.”

And, well…

Izuku has always listened to the commands his handlers and trainers gave him. Could he have ever hoped to break free of a Quirk-infused order?

No, not as he is, not with who he is, and so Izuku walks right out of bounds, and the Sports Festival ends with his loss.

-----

Not long after, Izuku finds himself standing on a raised podium, a perfect smile painted on his face as he waves, the second place champion of the first years. Shinsou stands a step above, eyes glistening with unshed tears that seem rather out of character for the purple-haired boy, not that Izuku would ever judge him for being emotional in a moment like this. 

Tokoyami and Yoarashi share third place, having refused the offer to see who would place and who would not. Izuku doesn’t know why, exactly, but he thinks it’s because they’re both just eager to celebrate...or something.

They seem satisfied, at the very least. Proud to have made it into the rankings. And Izuku has a feeling that he, too, should be excited.

And he is. And his smile does become real when All Might places the silver medal around his neck, and it stays real as he hears his siblings cheering in the stands, matching the eager cries of his peers.

But his shoulders droop the moment he is out of sight, fear and dread taking the spot that his joy had held.

Because while Izuku is more than satisfied with second place, he knows that his handler won’t be.

Suddenly, the four day weekend doesn’t sound half as nice as it did, and Izuku can only hope that Monday comes quickly.

(He knows that it won’t, but there’s nothing to be done about that.)

Chapter Text

Of Hero Names and Work Studies (Who Will You Become?) 

 

Izuku is tired. That’s all there is to it. His muscles protest, his wings ache, but he has nothing to say against it. It’s his fault for losing, after all, for only being good enough for second place. He should have been more prepared, should have known to stay quiet.

“I thought you were trained to be better,” his handler said. “I suppose we will have to add some additional lessons, Skvader.”

They did. Mental, physical, all that lays between. The four day break was supposed to be a chance to rest and recuperate after a day of activities. A chance for the first years to relax, maybe go to see how the second and third years fared if they pleased. 

Izuku didn’t get that, of course. But the weekend is over, now, and his trainers know his limit. 

They never push him too far over it, and so Izuku knows that he’s not at risk of collapsing.

That does not mean, of course, that Izuku is fully awake. No, he’s ready to fall right back asleep.

And that’s exactly what Izuku does, upon reaching the empty classroom. He tucks himself into his chair, burrows into his wings, hides from the world and dreams of absolutely nothing.

(What even are his dreams? Are they even his?)

-----

When Izuku wakes up, it’s to the bell ringing and a class full of people. His friends smile at him, some seemingly amused by his awakening.

“Good morning!” Tsunotori says in a cheerful little whisper. “Did you enjoy your nap? You looked very comfortable!”

Izuku nods, and nearly opens his mouth to admit that he was, but-

“You’ve been growing more talkative, as of late,” his handler noted, eyes giving away nothing for Izuku to work with. “Why is that?”

‘Because I’m happy,’ Izuku wanted to say, and that surprised him.

Wasn’t he happy already? He was happy with Keigo and Rumi, was that not enough for him?

Or is he simply becoming selfish? Wanting, taking...he’s not supposed to want.

Izuku stayed quiet. His handler seemed satisfied with his lack of an answer. 

Izuku decides to keep his mouth shut, in the end. If Tsunotori thinks that this is odd, she doesn’t point it out, instead turning around as Aizawa stands up to speak. 

“Internships are next week,” Aizawa says, straight to the point like usual. He’s efficient with his words, Izuku notes. Better than Izuku is when he speaks. “Heroes and agencies have sent recruitment offers based on your performances at the Sports Festival. These work studies will last the entirety of next week, so choose wisely on who you want to be with. This is a chance to figure out what kind of hero you want to become.”

“Sensei!” Ashido shouts, and Aizawa pauses. “What if we don’t get any offers?”

“We have forty agencies who already agreed to take on any students who don’t have any offers, or simply didn’t want the offers given to them,” Aizawa informs. “But before you get your offers, you have to pick out your hero names. These are temporary for now, but you should be careful when creating them. Most people end up using their temporary choices, simply because they become known with that name. So if you choose poorly…”

“Your life will become a living Hell!” Midnight cheers, slamming open the door and strutting in. “And that’s why I’m here!”

“I’m unqualified to help with names,” Aizawa states, then steps into his sleeping bag. “Just don’t be stupid.”

And just like that, Aizawa is napping. Just like Izuku wants to be.

Oh, well.

Midnight passes out whiteboards and black markers, smiling as she says, “Go ahead and put down the name that you think will best suit your image! Make it your own, you know? Plus Ultra style, kiddos! Fifteen minutes, and then we start presenting!”

Fifteen minutes? Izuku furrows his eyebrows, glancing at the board. It won’t take fifteen minutes for him.

Although that may be because his hero name has always been known.

Wasting no time, Izuku writes down his name before curling back up, eager for a quick nap. And as such, the next fifteen minutes pass in the blink of an eye, with Izuku being coaxed back into reality by a gentle tap from Dark Shadow, the Quirk eyeing him oddly as it does so.

“You’re like the teacher,” Dark Shadow declares, and Izuku hears Todoroki let out an odd huff beside him.

Oh. That’s a laugh.

“If everyone is ready,” Midnight says, drawing the class’s attention back to her, “who would like to present their name first?”

“Oh, me! Pick me, s’il vous plaît!” Aoyama cries, and Midnight waves him up. Standing behind the podium, Aoyama shows his whiteboard with a dramatic flourish, announcing, “The Shining Hero: I Cannot Stop Twinkling!”

“It’s a whole sentence!” His peers cry, and Izuku can’t help but agree that it’s, well, a bit too long.

“It’s a bit too long,” Midnight says, more gentle, and Izuku watches as she walks over, taking a marker and making corrections. “If we cut out the first part...and make this a contraction...there we are! Can’t Stop Twinkling, how about that?”

Izuku, personally, doesn’t know if that’s really much better…but Aoyama is sparkling happily, so it must be good enough. Either way, Aoyama prances back to his seat, and the naming continues. 

“I’m King Explosion Murder!” Bakugou shouts out, and Izuku blinks. 

He has a feeling that, well...the commission wouldn’t approve of a name like that.

(Izuku loves it.)

Midnight does not. “That...no, Bakugou.”

“Why not ?!” Bakugou asks, and Midnight sighs.

“That’s too violent. Pick a new one.” Midnight gestures for Bakugou to head back to his spot, and Bakugou does, grumbling all the while. Izuku would grumble too, he likes the name.

Shouji walks up next, holding up his whiteboard and saying, “The Stealth Hero: Tentacole.”

“Ooh, I like that!” Midnight says, then looks at the class. “Take note! A nice, normal name!”

“The Stealth Hero: Invisible Girl!” Hagakure cheers, and Midnight nods.

“That really suits you!” Midnight encourages. “Now who wants to go next?”

“Me!” Ashido cheers, and races up before Midnight calls on her. Slamming her whiteboard down, she declares, “My codename will be Alien Queen!”

“Hold on,” Midnight says, eyes narrowed. “Like that monster with the acidic blood? I don’t think so. Try again, Ashido.”

Izuku watches as Ashido walks back to her desk, dejected as she slumps into her seat. Izuku thought it was pretty nice, so it’s somewhat disappointing that she’s been shot down.

Especially when Todoroki chooses his first name as his hero name, simply saying, “Shouto.”

Midnight seems disappointed by Todoroki’s decision, too, at least. Is...is that something Izuku should take consolation in?

Jirou comes up next, saying, “The Hearing Hero: Earphone Jack. That’s who I’m going to be.”

“Now that’s a good one!” Midnight approves, and then she says something similar a few moments later when Kaminari introduces himself as the Stun Gun Hero: Chargebolt.

On and on, his peers introduce themselves, and Izuku pays attention to each announcement. Asui introduces herself as the Rainy Season Hero: Froppy. Honenuki is Mudman. Sero is the Taping Hero: Cellophane, and Ojirou is the Martial Arts Hero: Tailman. Satou is the Sweets Hero: Sugarman. Tokoyami is the Jet-Black Hero: Tsukuyomi, and Kirishima is the Sturdy Hero: Red Riot. (Izuku thinks it’s a reference to a previous hero, from Midnight’s comment, but Izuku doesn’t remember the hero.)

Ashido gets her groove back, taking on the name Pinky, and Monoma follows her up, introducing himself as Phantom Thief. 

Iida takes on his first name, Tenya. It’s...odd. Not what Izuku assumed the boy would pick. Then again, Iida has been acting oddly, stiffer than normal. Did something happen?

Izuku doesn’t have a clue. 

Kouda chooses to be the Petting Hero: Anima. Tsunotori cheerfully announces her choice as the Horsepower Hero: Bariki. 

Bakugou gets rejected on Lord Explosion Murder, and just like that, Midnight is looking right at him.

“And that just leaves Midoriya! Come up here and show us what you’ve got!”

Izuku listens to the command, standing up from his seat and picking up his whiteboard. He slips to the front of the room, unveiling his choice without much bravado.

“Skvader,” Izuku says, because that’s who he is. It’s who he’s always been. 

Who he always will be, a decision concluded before he could even say the word, from the day that he was born with feathers sprouting from his back and ears poking from the top of his head rather than the sides.

Izuku has been Skvader longer than he has even been Izuku, and so that is the name he presents.

And Midnight accepts it, letting him go back to his seat as quickly as he left it. Izuku listens once more, content to watch on, a viewer as Aizawa stands up and ushers Midnight out, before picking up a giant stack of papers in one hand and showing a display on the board. 

“As I said earlier,” Aizawa starts, “you were sent offers based on your performances at the Sports Festival. Usually, offers are more evenly spread out, but recent...incidents….have caused more people to keep an eye on your class. As such, some of you have much higher offers being presented to you than your peers.”

Izuku glances at the board, quickly noting the top three students in terms of offers received. Tokoyami came second, as the only other one who made the final rankings. Third was Todoroki, who seems almost resigned to the number- as if he knows that not all of them are truly for his potential, but rather for his legacy.

Not that Izuku feels much different, glancing at his own results. Because he, he is the one with the most offers. Undoubtedly attributed to his Quirk and second place ranking, but likely influenced by his handlers.

And perhaps even by his own legacy. Because Izuku isn’t...he isn’t really hidden , not fully. The commission doesn’t broadcast him, doesn’t post the reports they make regarding his progress and skills, but...they let him see Keigo and Rumi, and let him be seen with them. They let him fly with Keigo, and head to Rumi’s agency. If they wanted to keep him secret, they would.

If someone wanted to know about him, they absolutely could.

So Izuku sees the thousands of offers being attached to his name, and he can’t help but wonder just how many are due to his family and trainers.

“Work studies begin next week,” Aizawa continues, passing out stacks of papers to certain students, and single sheets to others. “Your decision needs to be made by Friday, and your form must be submitted by then as well.” Aizawa sets down a stack, the largest, on Izuku’s desk, and doesn’t move as he says, “You will have the rest of the period to look through your offers. Your form is attached to the offers.”

That’s all that it takes for his peers to start looking at their choices, eager eyed and excited. Izuku doesn’t feel that same enthusiasm, instead toying with the top page.

Glancing down at Izuku, Aizawa says, “You may want to consider checking the section under ‘e’.”

Then he walks away, and Izuku blinks in surprise.

E?

Shrugging, Izuku decides to heed the man’s advice, skipping straight to the section. It’s not the lengthiest section of the packet- not many heroes start their name with the vowel, interestingly enough- skimming through the list.

The first name his eyes catch on is Endeavor’s, Keigo’s favorite hero and Todoroki’s personal nightmare. Izuku hesitates on the name, knowing that he should want to go with such a high-ranking hero.

But his eyes continue scanning the list, until his eyes catch on a much more interesting option.

Eraserhead .

That...that’s Aizawa’s hero name. Aizawa sent him an offer.

Why did Aizawa send him an offer? Aizawa is an underground- no, the Underground Hero. Aizawa hides away from the media, and stays out of the spotlight. Izuku isn’t meant to do that. He’s supposed to be flashy and bright, attention-grabbing in the best of ways. He thought that he's been clear enough, showing his peers and teachers alike that he’s supposed to be a daylight hero. 

So why would Aizawa be interested in mentoring him?

Or is there another reason? Is...Is Izuku not doing well enough? Does Aizawa think that he needs extra help, is that why he even went out of his way to tell Izuku to skip straight to his section? 

Izuku chances a glance at Aizawa, but the man is already fast asleep. His face gives away nothing, smoothed out and expressionless. 

Maybe Aizawa does believe that Izuku is lacking, in some aspects. Maybe he’s disappointed in the fact that Izuku placed second, rather than first. Or perhaps he sees something in Izuku that he can encourage, strengthen, and better.

Whatever it is...Izuku knows that it is only Aizawa’s opinion that influences the availability of this offer. Because Aizawa is not the type to be swayed by legacy, or familial connections, or government handlers, or, well, anything . Aizawa is simply Aizawa, who trusts in himself and knows just what to do without relying on the approval of others.

And so Izuku makes his choice without hesitation, filling out the form with a smile without sparing a single look at the other offers that have been presented to him.

Because it is only Aizawa who Izuku can say, with certainty, wants to train him for who he is.

That is enough for him, in the end.

-----

The morning passes quickly, after that. Not quite so much a blink, but more like a montage that one would see in a show. First period fades away, English comes and goes, math is a blur of equations and notes that Izuku has already taken before. The morning is gone before Izuku realizes it, and then the bell is ringing for lunch and Tsunotori is leading him to the cafeteria, filling the silence by talking about her weekend. 

Because Tsunotori, unlike Izuku, had gone to see the other Sports Festivals. Well, she went to the third year festival, at least.

“It is the most exciting one!” Tsunotori explains. “They are all very powerful; it is impressive!” 

And it sounds impressive, Izuku thinks, as Tsunotori talks about a girl who used waves of energy to fly around, and another who used support gear to outshine her opponents. The third years are somehow more competitive and yet more carefree, confident in themselves in ways that the first years aren’t always able to be. 

It’s because they’re more experienced, Izuku decides. They know what’s coming, they know that the Sports Festival is important, but they also know that they are ready, they know what they can do with their Quirk and their body and their mind. The third years have seen the world, have trained for years, and they know how to overcome their setbacks and make a situation work for them.

The thought of setbacks makes Izuku pause, and he glances ahead of him, where Kirishima and Kaminari walk just a few feet before them. Lips pursed, Izuku makes up his mind and speaks.

“I need to go to the Support Department,” Izuku states, voice soft but still cutting in through her words. He feels bad for interrupting, but Tsunotori just nods along.

“Alright! Do you want me to come with you?” She asks, and Izuku shakes his head. He doesn’t want to cut into her lunch period, or her chance to talk to the others, and tells her this. She accepts his answer, and the two go their separate ways.

And so Izuku finds himself standing in front of a large door, taking a deep breath before pushing it open.

There are only three people in the room. One is the teacher, clearly, the man sitting at his desk and filling out some sort of paperwork. His head is covered by an odd metal contraption, and Izuku wonders if he’d be able to recognize the man if his face was uncovered. 

Likely not, so Izuku glances to the next person. A boy with brown hair is hunched over one of the workbenches, glasses skewed as he glares over them at the laptop he’s furiously typing on. Beside him is one of the biggest travel mugs that Izuku has ever seen, and Izuku can’t help but be impressed.

And then the boy takes a drink from the mug and promptly disappears, a bolt of lightning that darts into the computer.

How...odd.

And that leaves the last person. With pink, dreadlike hair and patches of oil covering his arms, Izuku immediately recognizes Mei Hatsume from the Sports Festival.

And she, too, recognizes him.

“Ten Million!” Hatsume greets, looking cheerful despite the fact that he rejected her offer to join his team. “Have you come to see what my babies can offer you?”

Izuku would blush, if he didn’t know that Hatsume was simply referring to her gadgets. Instead, he offers a hesitant smile and says, “Well...it’s not for me , but I think you could help my friend?”

Hatsume doesn’t even blink, nodding happily and asking, “What can I do for ya?”

“My friend has an electricity-based Quirk,” Izuku begins, and Hatsume nods along.

“Like Gijutsu,” she says, and Izuku has...no idea who that is.

“I- I don’t know?”

“I’m Gijutsu,” a new voice pops in, and Izuku squeaks as the brown-haired boy falls out of the laptop, dusting himself off with a smile. “Kenji Gijutsu, at your service! Or something like that.”

“He’s the only one who can match my genius!” Hatsume explains. “Although he likes coding more than creating the robots themselves!”

“It makes us a decent duo,” Gijutsu admits. “Although Power Loader-sensei doesn’t really... let us team up.”

Izuku chances a glance at the teacher, apparently Power Loader. Even with his face covered, Izuku can feel the exasperation he’s letting out. 

“But anyways,” Gijutsu continues. “My Quirk lets me control technology, not electricity. I doubt your friend is as similar to me as Hatsume assumed.”

“He isn’t,” Izuku agrees. “He can generate electricity and cover himself in it. He can emit the energy, but once it goes too far he can’t control it. If he exceeds his limit, though, his brain short-circuits.”

The room falls silent, Gijutsu’s smile falling. “Short-circuits,” he repeats, and Izuku nods. “What the fu-”

“I’m assuming that’s why you’re here?” Hatsume asks, and Izuku nods.

“I think it’d be good for him to get a better method of controlling the direction of his discharges in the future, but for now I’m just worried about him hurting himself,” Izuku admits. “Is...is there anything you can do?”

“Surely!” Hatsume cheers. “You’ve got me, Gijutsu, and sensei to help you out!”

“Tell me,” Gijutsu starts, “does your friend wear any metal in his costume?”

Izuku blinks, trying to recall Kaminari’s outfit. “Ah...he wears an earphone over his right ear, with an antenna sticking out of it? I don’t know what material it’s made out of, though.”

“Fuck,” Gijutsu murmurs, then shakes his head. “Hatsume, let’s go make some rods.”

“Rods?”

“Lightning rods!” Hatsume says, already racing to grab things. “Think about it, Ten Million! If we don’t want the electricity reaching his head, we need it to go somewhere else! Having metal up by his head isn’t going to help us, but I doubt we want to get rid of the device! So we’ll add more metal, and see if that redirects the energy!” 

Oh. That makes sense...he thinks. 

“We’ll have it done soon enough,” Gijutsu reassures, back to typing. “Your friend is in good hands.”

“Who is the friend, by the way?” Hatsume asks.

“Kaminari.”

“Ooh! He has a good outfit, appearance-wise, we’ll make the metal look cool enough for that!” With that said, Hatsume begins to usher Izuku out of the room, shoving him out without hesitation.

“Oh, and I’m going to be changing your hero costume! That coat got trashed during your fight, maybe I’ll make you a brand new one! You’re in need of some upgrades, Ten Million!” Hatsume announces. “I’ll get those to you soon, though! See you then!”

And then the door is slammed shut, and Izuku is left in an empty hall. 

Confused, and mildly concerned, Izuku decides that it’s in his best interest to simply grab a quick lunch and head back to class.

So he does, and the rest of the day is calm and normal.

Shouta only needed one look at Midoriya to see that the boy was tired, and not quite there. Whether it’s because he had only just woken up, or because of something else, Shouta wasn't sure. 

Either way, he chose to pay attention, keeping an eye on the boy. 

And it was...odd, how Midoriya acted. A little vacant when Aizawa set his stack of offers on his desk, a hint of unenthusiasm in his voice when he presented his hero name.

That’s another thing, too. His hero name.

Skvader.

Now, Midoriya isn’t the first student Shouta has had that made their name relate to their Quirk. He’s not even the only student in this current class.

But Midoriya is the only one who has ever seemed resigned as he announced it.

And that...that isn’t right. There are many ways students have spoken when announcing their names, many emotions that he’s seen flitter across their faces, many times hidden from the surface but screaming openly in the eyes. 

Resignation has never been one of those emotions. But there was Midoriya, one of his brightest, happiest students, presenting his whiteboard without as much as an upturned lip, tone blank as he offered the name he’d be known by for what would likely be the entirety of his career.

And then with the internship offers. He had expected Midoriya to be excited by the vast number connected to his name, thrilled at the literal thousands of offers sent his way. 

Yet Midoriya had only ducked his head at the sight, and had barely even touched the packet that Shouta gave him. It wasn’t until Shouta guided him, telling him to look in the very same section that his own offer was listed, that Midoriya began to look.

Midoriya seemed a bit better, when the period ended, a small smile on his face as he finished filling out his form. But by the time Shouta next saw him, at training, he didn’t look quite so excited. First the boy just seemed confused, and Shouta wondered about that until he overheard that the boy had gone to the Support Department during lunch- something about helping a peer. And Shouta was sure- is still sure- that the confusion was simply the same that most hero students deal with, upon finding one of the more...eccentric Support students.

But then, as training began, Shouta could not help but notice how exhausted Midoriya seemed.

Not that his training suffered, no. Midoriya clearly put one-hundred percent of his effort into his training, and it showed. It always did, with the boy, when he gained a determined expression and let nothing falter him. 

It was whenever the boy paused. Because when Midoriya was not moving, was not training, was not working to the edge of his limit and then some...he collapsed. Not really, not physically, but it was as if watching someone deflate, losing their spark and falling in on themselves.

Midoriya collapsed with every pause, eyes meeting the ground, wings drooping ever so slightly, and Shouta just wanted to know why.

But the day ended, and Shouta still doesn’t know the answer. Just that Midoriya is tired, and resigned, and exhausted. He has no explanations, but he has a guess as to who the source is.

Shouta is just glad that Midoriya took up his offer. It’ll give Shouta a chance to try figuring out his student more, and how to help him.

Because for all that Midoriya is willing to help others, spending his time searching for solutions to the problems his peers face, he never speaks up for himself. 

Shouta supposes that he’ll just have to be a little louder. Hizashi will be so proud.

-----

“You’re going to intern under Endeavor,” his handler says, and Izuku freezes.

Because Izuku...Izuku has already turned in his slip, with his homeroom teacher’s name written on it.

His handler sees the pause, and the lack of a nod, and her eyes narrow at him immediately. “What is it?” She asks, and the question is one that Izuku has to answer.

“I already turned in my slip,” he admits, and her eyes narrow more.

“Who for?”

“Eraserhead.” She doesn’t recognize the name, it’s clear in her expression. “He’s an...underground hero.”

“You don’t plan to be underground,” she states. He doesn’t, no. It’s not in the plan that life has set for him.

But....

Oh.

Izuku knows what to say, now.

“Eraserhead relies on stealth and being silent. You-” no, wrong word, “ I need to be quieter. I need to learn when. Eraserhead is strict, and his lessons are efficient and decisive.”

Strict, efficient, silent. 

His handler’s eyes do not soften, but the glare lessens. She hums, a short note, and then nods curtly.

“Then I suppose there is no issue. I expect that you will choose Endeavor, next time that you have the chance. Unless there is a better option by then.”

A better option? Who else is better, other than All Might?

Izuku doesn’t know, but his handler is already walking away, leaving him in silence.

It’s a small thing, but it feels like a victory nonetheless.

And now Izuku can’t help but look forward to interning under Aizawa. 

He just hopes that he can meet his teacher’s expectations.
Notes:

    There are just a few little things I'd like to say!
    1. As mentioned above, I'm grateful for everyone who has enjoyed this story so far! As I've mentioned in a server I'm in, I am a sucker for the butterfly effect, and I'm glad that so many of you like the changes I've made.
    2. To the one person who asked for Izuku to intern with Endeavor...I hope you know that you nearly changed a *lot* of the story. Alas, I chose to stick with my original plans...but god, did it hurt to do that! (With that said, keep your thoughts coming, mes amants! Sometimes *you* are my inspiration to try something out!)
    3. You may have noticed that I'm adding a couple of OCs! I don't make a habit of doing this, actually, but this story is an exception! I have three OCs that I've added in to this story that will have a bit of influence on the plot- not much, of course, but I do have plans for them in the future- over time. I'll give more information if anyone is curious (and they will each be introduced in their own time!), but don't worry too much about them! I just needed certain roles filled, and didn't know of anyone in canon who could fill them the right way!

    With that said, I will see you next time! <3

Chapter Text

Work Studies, Work for Your Future

 

The day begins with Izuku heading to the train station, despite the fact that he is likely heading to Yuuei for the beginning of his own work study. But Aizawa said for everyone to meet there, so that he could make sure they were all going to the right places, and Izuku doesn’t think he could disobey the man’s orders.

Nor anyone else’s, but that’s neither here nor there.

So Izuku stands with the rest of the group, a suitcase in one hand. Not one for additional inefficiency, Aizawa had told Izuku, on Friday, to leave his costume case at the school. And so Izuku listened, and now he’s here, watching his peers as they converse with one another. 

They’re excited. Well, most are. It’s clear, to Izuku, that he is one of the few who has resided in the same area that they were trained. And the only other stands a short distance away from the others, expression normal but eyes radiating the resignation that the boy holds inside.

Izuku glances at his friends, who all talk to each other, and then forces himself to move, walking up to the dual-haired boy.

“Midoriya,” Todoroki says, voice blank but eyes now curious.

“Todoroki.” Izuku offers a hesitant smile, but it drops quickly. “Are you working with…”

“Endeavor,” Todoroki fills in, and Izuku isn’t surprised. Disheartened, perhaps, but not surprised. 

“My handlers...wanted me to choose him,” Izuku says. “I had already submitted my slip, though.”

“For Aizawa, right?” Todoroki asks, and Izuku wonders if it’s as special for Todoroki to ask questions as it seems to be for him to do the same.

“Yes.”

“Why?”

“He...he’s good.” There’s no other way to explain it. And yet, somehow, Todoroki understands perfectly, eyes flashing with comprehension.

“I had other offers,” Todoroki says. “But I need to control my fire. There was no better option.”

And really, isn’t that what it comes down to? Comfort or quality, there can never be both. 

Izuku glances at Aizawa, and adjusts his thoughts. Perhaps there can be a teacher that is good, without making someone want to give up just by entering the room.

“Next time,” Izuku murmurs, “we could...look at offers together?”

Todoroki seems surprised by the suggestion, perhaps because Izuku is the one who spoke. But then his eyes calm, and he says, “I think that’d be nice.”

Izuku perks up, but he doesn’t get anything out because Aizawa decides to speak before he can.

“Alright, let’s get this over with so you can go to your work studies,” Aizawa says, and the class falls silent. “Everyone has their costume and their belongings, correct?”

“Yep!” Ashido chirps, and Aizawa sighs. For a moment, it looks like he’s going to correct her informal tone, but then his shoulders droop and he shrugs it off.

“Don’t cause property damage, listen to your mentors, and no illegal actions.” There’s a pause, and Aizawa raises an eyebrow when nobody moves. “What are you waiting for? Go?”

His peers react instantly, many racing off the moment Aizawa tells them to. A few wave as they pass Izuku, calling out quick goodbyes- as if they hadn’t done so just minutes ago- before darting away. Izuku watches all nineteen of his peers go, some with excitement, some with nerves, one with resignation, and one with a stiff gait and downturned lips.

Izuku’s eyes track that last one, Iida, for a moment longer than the others. But Izuku has nothing to do with the boy’s anger, doesn’t know his peer well enough to try making it something he has to do with, and so he turns to face Aizawa.

“Ready?” Aizawa asks, and Izuku nods quickly. “Let’s go, then.”

The trip to Yuuei is quick and unexciting, but Izuku isn’t phased as he follows the man to school. 

His interest is piqued, however, when Aizawa leads him to a basic training gym after having Izuku grab his costume case.

Because someone is standing in the gym, waiting for them.

And when they turn around, Izuku blinks in surprise.

Hitoshi Shinsou blinks right back.

“You two will be working together roughly half of the time,” Aizawa states. “For the other half, you will be working individually to hone different aspects. For now, go get dressed into your PE uniforms. Ten minutes.” Eyes trained on Izuku, he says, “Just leave your case in your chosen locker, you won’t be needing it yet.”

Izuku nods, then speeds away to get dressed. Shinsou gives him a guarded look as he changes, but Izuku just offers a smile before racing back out.

Aizawa gives him the same look he usually does, when Izuku is just a little too fast at returning to be normal, but he’s far too used to it to say anything by now. So the two wait in silence, Aizawa with a tired expression, Izuku enjoying the quiet, until Shinsou joins them once again. The boy gives him an odd look, one that seems to be a mix of exasperation and annoyance, but he doesn’t say anything to Izuku.

Maybe that’s because Aizawa speaks up immediately. 

“To see where you two stand right now in terms of skill, I’m going to have you spar against each other. First you’ll fight without Quirks, and then with them. No biting, breaking, or anything of the sorts. Understood?” The two nod in sync, and Aizawa turns his gaze onto Shinsou alone. “I don’t expect you to be on the same skill level as Midoriya. Midoriya is one of the best fighters in my class. This is simply the best way to observe what you need to learn, and find out what you already know.”

Izuku blinks, surprised by the compliment, but hides his smile when he sees the despair in Shinsou’s eyes. But along with that worry is another hint of irritation, and that makes it a bit easier to quell his joy, hiding it away.

Izuku moves automatically when Aizawa gestures to the center of the room, stepping onto the training mats, slipping into a defensive position automatically.

“Remember,” Aizawa says, “this is a Quirkless spar. Shinsou, do your best. And Midoriya?”

Izuku looks to Aizawa, and the man grins.

“Don’t go too easy on him.”

Shinsou’s face falls the moment Aizawa says that, and only a few seconds later the boy’s body is following his expression, Izuku pinning the boy to the ground, wrists caught in his grasp and lower body trapped with his own. His wings rest calmly on his back, not having moved since Aizawa spoke. 

Shinsou stares, eyes wide as he realizes what happened. “Really?” He murmurs, and Izuku takes that as his cue to get up, fixing his stance once again, this time more offensive.

“Midoriya is quick,” Aizawa warns. “Again.”

And Izuku heeds his command.

-----

Over and over again, Aizawa has them spar. Hitoshi is breathless by the time that Aizawa backs off of the Quirkless rule, but half of his air is gone from the times he’s been knocked to the ground, mere seconds after Aizawa called for him to start.

And he can’t even be mad at Midoriya! Irritated? Oh, definitely, because Aizawa’s little comments have reminded him of just how great of a life he missed out on by being born with a ‘villainous’ Quirk. But mad? No. No, he can’t even be pissed right now. 

Because damn, it’s clear that Midoriya has training for fights. How many gyms did he hit , to get hits quite so hard? 

Midoriya is ruthless during the Quirkless sparring sessions. Or, maybe ruthless isn’t the best choice of wording, because Midoriya isn’t dragging the rounds out. He’s not toying with Shinsou, he’s not hurting him any more than he has to. 

Perhaps efficient is a better choice, because that’s what Midoriya is. Quick, precise, no movement unneeded. Everything has a purpose, but Midoriya moves from step to step fluidly, like it’s a dance he’s done so many times, it’s permanently etched into his memory.

Kind of like Aizawa seems to be. Huh. 

But it’s worse, somehow, when Quirks are allowed. Because Hitoshi, well…

Quite frankly, Hitoshi assumed that he’d be able to get Midoriya to speak again, or even growl like he did last time.

Yet for the entirety of their Quirked sparring, Midoriya doesn’t make a single sound. 

Not. One. Noise.

Hitoshi tries everything. He tries insults, both against Midoriya and his friends. But it’s like Midoriya doesn’t even hear him, and the green-haired boy is diving at him in seconds, knocking him down for what feels like the hundredth time today. So he moves onto what worked in the Sports Festival, reminding Midoriya about the U.S.J., about Aizawa’s injuries.

All that had done was earned him suspiciously teary eyes, and an odd look from Aizawa. 

Hitoshi doesn’t use that trick anymore. It feels...wrong, using it against Midoriya. Especially with the man in question as the only one watching them.

He tries jokes, but they don’t land right and half of the time Midoriya just looks confused. He tries asking questions about the weather , god damn, but Midoriya just moves and fights like it’s the only thing he knows. He tries and tries and tries , and sometimes he just tries lashing out, but even his hits don’t land.

And finally they’re on their final match, and Hitoshi can’t help but snap, can’t help but open his mouth and ask, “What, you don’t have a loose tongue anymore? Too good for something like a weakness?” 

And Midoriya is on him in seconds, knocking him down and knocking the air right out of him. It’s a harder impact than the other times, as if Midoriya lost control of himself for just a split second. 

Hitoshi catches his breath, but then he’s distracted by the way Midoriya stares at him. Because Midoriya is, well, still on him, oddly still.

It’s only when Aizawa calls out Midoriya’s indisputable win that the boy stands up, his smile strained as he murmurs, “I’m not supposed to talk much. My handlers didn’t like it.”

And that...that’s a sentence that Hitoshi decidedly does not like. Because what the fuck does that mean?

Needless to say, sparring ends on a rather jarring note, one that Hitoshi can’t shake even as Aizawa hands over a training plan for Hitoshi to follow. 

And a part of him can’t help but wonder who these ‘handlers’ are, and why they are making such statements. 

He’ll have to ask about that, he supposes.

-----

Izuku watches as Aizawa sends Shinsou across the gym, handing off a packet before walking back over to him. Izuku stands up, finishing the stretches that he had been doing during his wait, and Aizawa nods to him.

“Good job on sparring,” Aizawa says. “We’ll be working on stealth now. I want to see how quiet you can move, to start.”

How...quiet he can be?

Oh, Izuku can be quiet alright. 

And so the next forty minutes are a blur, with Aizawa soon realizing that Izuku already knows exactly how to move when he needs to hide his prese
