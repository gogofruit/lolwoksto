        Predictably, Izuku nodded, almost hopping in place, confusion already forgotten.

        “Can I seek, Mama?” He leaned forward, lips pressed in a pout, hands propped against her arms while still hopping in place, “Kacchan never lets me seek.”

        “Sorry, Izuku,” Moving her hands to grasp his, Inko squeezed them reassuringly, “I want you to hide for me. It’s important, alright?”

Chapter Text

Mama had told him to hide.

Izuku hadn’t understood at first, insisting that they should find a hero if there was danger. But his Mama was an Adult and usually knew what was right and she had said that the heroes would not be able to help them. She had given him his yellow backpack and sent him off after he had just gotten home.

He was a good boy and though he wanted to go hide in the playground that he and Kacchan visited often, he knew that it was a place that his Mama could easily find him.

He walked.

No one seemed to see him. No one stopped him.

He kept walking.

He walked past the playground. His daycare. The elementary school that Mama had said he would attend next year. The corner shop where the nice Quirkless (like him!) granny worked, who always gave him a small piece of strawberry candy when he came with his Mama when she did her shopping.

He waved at her. She waved back.

He continued walking.

Izuku didn’t know how long he had been walking.

He was starting to not recognize the stores around him and it was getting darker every minute. Mama had never taken him this far from home. The buildings seemed to get taller and taller as neon lights lit up the storefronts, flickering occasionally with a buzzing sound.

He was tired.

The green haired boy carefully looked around him before making his way into an empty alleyway. Shadows seemed to deepen as he walked past bags of garbage, an overfilled dumpster, and the rattling of air conditioners. This was okay, right? No one was here. He could hide here. Carefully moving the cables so he could duck under them, Izuku found himself in a small space next to a broken unit. He took off his backpack and carefully sat down on the ground clutching it to his chest.

Mama had told him to hide.

Izuku always won in the games he played with his Mama. He was going to be a hero, so this would be good practice. Even though Mama had said sorry to him when he asked.

He would hide. Hide even better than All Might could.

Izuku was hungry.

The green haired boy had been hungry for a while now. He had checked his backpack early on, only finding a copy of his family’s registry, his hero notebook, a few granola bars, and a bottle of water.

The granola bars hadn’t lasted him too long and the water had barely lasted an afternoon in the summer’s heat. He was lucky that there was a nearby leaky drainpipe and that it rained yesterday. He had put his empty bottle out to collect the rainwater hoping to save it for later.

It was all gone now though. He buried his face into his now empty arms. His backpack had been stuffed as far as he could push it on the top of a broken unit. He didn’t want it to get wet when the rain was falling.

Days had passed.

Izuku was hungry. He was so hungry.

He hurt.

He clenched his fists into his shorts, almost biting his lip when he irritated one of the small feathery bumps on his forearms. They had started appearing on his arms and face a few hours ago. Izuku had thought he had known what pain was. How it felt. But Kacchan’s explosions were almost nothing compared to this. Even his eyes hurt. It was his back that hurt the worst though.

His stomach grumbled and he clutched at it, curling up in a feeble attempt to stifle the noises. He’d only been by himself for a few days and already, he’s learned that it’s better to be silent.

He was dying, wasn’t he? Was this how people died?

He hurt all over.

The scrabble of nails against a plastic bag, the twitching of whiskers. A rat. His Mama’s whispers in his ears, memories that he loathed to let go.

Izuku, those are dirty, if they bite you, you can get very sick.

His back itched ferociously; he wanted to scream. But he loved his Mama and she told him. She said to him while ruffling his curls, giving him a (final) kiss on the forehead.

You need to go, Izuku. You need to hide. Promise me to hide.

He remembered nodding his head. It was only two days after his first errand after all; he could take care of himself for a few hours. Mama’s voice sounded much more worried this time though. Her eyes were shiny and looked like how his eyes did right before he would cry.

Mama, don’t cry. I’ll be back. I’ll hide and then you’ll find me. You said hide and seek, right?

She gave him a watery smile, eyes crinkling, and nodded.

I love you, Izuku, okay? Never forget that. I love you.

Scurrying snapped him out of his thoughts, his eyes quickly finding the plump rat. Izuku could not have known this, but in that moment, his pupils dilated, leaving only a sliver of green visible.

He was hungry. He had to hide, but he was so so hungry.

His fingers clenched at the ragged shirt he was wearing. Rats were animals, right? And animals were meat, he knew that. Pigs made the pork of his favorite katsudon after all.

However, Mama always cooked the meat she would buy at the supermarket. Mama wasn’t here though. Would he be scolded if he didn’t cook meat? He wasn’t even allowed to use the stove at home.

But if he ate, would he stop dying?

He had to live if he wanted to hide.

Mama won’t be able to find me if I’m dead.

Izuku clumsily stood, his back twinging and eyes intently tracking the rat’s minute movements. He needed to do this. The itching got worse and it took all he could to not crumple to the alley wall, to lay against the cold metal of the bricks, for some measure of relief.

He breathed in, the same way he did after Kacchan would sometimes punch him, doing his best to push away how much he wanted to scratch away at himself.

He leapt forward, teeth gritted and fingers held like claws.

He

f l e w.

Downy wings exploded out of the boy’s back, flight feathers barely half grown. A flap, another flap. The bloody ragged remains of his shirt were left behind along with his shoes (his favorite shoes) as he extended his talons and struck, skidding across the ground.

The owl who was once a boy gorged, sharp beak tearing into the warm flesh and swallowing. In a few minutes, the entire rat was gone and the owl tilted his head, sounds of footsteps coming to his ears. He had fed now and now that he was sated, he had to find a roost.

He had to hide.

Inko sat at her dining table. It had been almost three days since she had told her son (her poor son) to leave, to hide. It was three days since she had seen her son. It was also three days since Hisashi had last come home.

Three days since she had found out about the corruption of the police. Of the heroes who had refused to get involved in ‘family matters’ when she had told them that her husband was a villain. They had told her that she was being dramatic. Hisashi had never gotten physical with her, but would that have even mattered? A villain was a villain.

It was an accident that she had even found out.

She had been sorting the laundry when she had found two small coins left forgotten in a pair of Hisashi’s slacks. The imprint of birds were barely visible on their surfaces. She had absentmindedly placed them aside in her apron pocket as she continued on with the chores, the news providing some pleasant background noise. The washer had only just been started, the detergent not even put away yet, when the television suddenly blared with the sound of breaking news.

It was the last thing she expected. Finding out that the small bird coin was a trademark left behind whenever suspected buildings were set on fire, well, it was unpleasant to say the least.

Hisashi had come home that night smelling of ash. Izuku had scrunched up his nose slightly, but had retreated to his room with minimal urging.

The next morning, Hisashi had left bright and early with only a narrow glance at Izuku. Inko could almost feel the proverbial burn of the coins in her apron pocket.

That afternoon, she had sewn a little pocket hidden in the lining of her son’s yellow backpack, carefully slotting the coin in. She had updated her will, taking Hisashi off and leaving everything she could to Izuku. She made sure Hisashi could never have custody of her son. Making sure that she had it signed and notarized, she sent it off in the mailbox across the street.

The green haired woman quickly packed her son’s bag, in a rush to finish before Izuku could get home. As she zipped up the bag, she could hear a small knock on the door.

“Izuku! It’s open!”

As the door slowly swung open, she could clearly remember his toothy grin, the floppy hat he held in an arm, hugging it to himself. The green of his hair (her hair) ruffling from the blast of the air conditioner. The red sneakers that they had gone together to buy only last week for his birthday.

“I’m home!”

This could be the last time you see him.

She did her best to smile through her morbid thoughts.

“Welcome home, Izuku,” She bent down taking his hat and school bag, swapping them with the backpack she had prepared for him, ignoring his confused look, “You remember the rules for hide and seek, right?”

“Uh huh,” He nodded guilelessly, carefully looping his arms into the straps of the bag, “I played that with Kacchan yesterday. He never found me though.”

“You must be very good at it then, if Katsuki-kun couldn’t find you,” Inko managed a small laugh (oh, she loved him), “Do you want to play a game with Mama?”

Predictably, Izuku nodded, almost hopping in place, confusion already forgotten.

“Can I seek, Mama?” He leaned forward, lips pressed in a pout, hands propped against her arms while still hopping in place, “Kacchan never lets me seek.”

“Sorry, Izuku,” Moving her hands to grasp his, Inko lightly squeezed them reassuringly, “I want you to hide for me. It’s important, alright?”

“But why?” His green eyes (her eyes) gleamed with unsuppressed excitement, “Is it like a hero mission?”

“Izuku, listen to me, okay?” She let go of his hands, resting her own on his shoulders (still so small, so narrow), “We’re both in danger. That’s why you need to hide.”

“But Mama, we can tell the heroes,” He pointed a finger at a poster hanging on the wall behind her, “Heroes help people.”

“The heroes won’t help us, honey,” Inko breathed out, shaking her head when her son tried to interrupt her, “I asked, and they said no.”

“You need to go, Izuku,” She blinked away the tears that wanted to fall, shifting just forward enough to brush a kiss on her son’s forehead, “You need to hide. Promise me to hide.”

He’s still so young.

Izuku nodded uncertainly, and then nodded again, more certain.

“Mama, don’t cry,” He began, and Inko startled, blinking away more tears just hearing that, “I’ll be back.”

I hope so.

“I’ll hide and then you’ll find me.”

Please.

“You said hide and seek, right?”

Good boy. Smart boy. My boy.

She nodded, giving him the biggest smile she could muster.

“I love you, Izuku, okay?” She hugged him tightly, trying to etch the moment in her mind, “Never forget that.”

He’s still so small.

She loosened her hug reluctantly and lightly turned him around to face the still open door.

“I love you.”

I love you.

One small push to his back.

“Go hide.”

Please live.

And with that, Inko had closed the front door, fingers shaking as she locked it, the click resounding in the empty entryway. It was like a bell toll to her ears, chiming an announcement to death.

It had been three days since then.

Three days since she had seen Izuku.

She wonders if anyone had realized anything.

She wonders if anyone had found him.

No. Not yet. Not while Hisashi is still out there.

It wasn’t the best of ideas, she knew. But what else could she have done? She had panicked. Badly. She had just wanted Izuku to be as far from home as possible. Hisashi had never wanted a child, usually just ignoring Izuku when they shared the same space. But now that she knew that same Hisashi was a villain… A real villain. Not just a common street criminal like those that ran rampant in the area they lived in.

She wasn’t as stupid as to think that Izuku could hide for long. Izuku was a smart boy, but he was only six. If there was anything she knew about her son, it was that he loved heroes. They were his joy, his passion. It was only a matter of time before he would go search one out. She hoped it wouldn’t be the ones that she had met on their patrol nearby.

What could she do?

What more could she-

“I’m home.”

Ah.

He’s home.

This is it then.

“Welcome home, Hisashi,” Inko spoke, her voice fragile and thin, “How was your day?”

“It was pretty great,” A small puff of smoke escaped his mouth as he chuckled, “Not bad at all.”

She stood up and took a step towards him. Hisashi (her husband) looked at her, eyes glinting in a manner which she had never seen before. A wry smile tugged on his lips, another puff of smoke dissipating between them. (She had married a villain.)

“Is there something wrong, Inko?”

This is it.

“Mnm,” She shook her head, a nervous laugh falling from her lips, “Nothing’s wrong.”

If he’s here with me, he’s not out there where Izuku is.

“I made dinner,” Impulsively grabbing his hand in hers, Inko tugged him closer, lightly pushing him towards a chair, “It’s your favorite. It’s warming in the oven. I’ll go-””

“Inko,” Hisashi quickly pulled her back, interrupting her, “Dear. There’s no need to fuss like this.”

“After all,” The scent of smoke wafted under nostrils as he leaned down to rasp, “I already know.”

Oh.

“Did you think you could fool me, my dear?”

It’s over.

“I almost can’t believe it,” His hand was gripping hers like a vice grip, immoveable despite her best attempt to shake him off, “You should have kept your nose out of my business.”

I’m going to die.

“You should have left my tokens where you had found them,” Hisashi growled out, eyes flaring like embers, “You’ve signed your own death warrant, Inko.”

I’m going to die.

“It’s alright,” Leaning forward, he caught her other hand, encasing it into his, “I might even make it painless.”

Can I stop him?

“You’ve just got the worst luck, don’t you?” Hisashi (a villain) mockingly continued, “Even trying to snitch to the co-.”

“I-I loved you,” Inko whispers, cracked lips twisting painfully, “Hisashi, please.."

What can I do?

“Oh, Inko,” Hisashi (her husband, a villain, her husband) chuckled, smoke now stinging at her eyes, “I did too.”

“But, I’ve always found the things that I loved, they burn the brightest.”

Inko opened her mouth to scream, her voice not even making it out before Hisashi’s lips met up with hers, curled in a smirk.

He

b l e w.

I’m sorry, Izuku.

The last thing Inko saw was fire.

Please live.

I love you, Izuku.

The owl didn’t know much of the world that he was a part of, but he knew that he had to live, to hide. His wings unfurled and he flapped a few times, jumping up and wedging his talons into the slits of a nearby air conditioner unit until he could clamber on top of it himself. Shuffling himself deeper into the small crawl space until he could feel the soft fabric of his bag, he wiggled himself in further until he no longer could. Only then did he let himself relax.

He hid.

The owl ruffled his feathers before settling to rest. Tomorrow was another night.

He would live.

Chapter Text

It was a nice night.

Izuku perched himself on the windowsill of his newest home, eyes sweeping the streets below. It was different from his last roost. His last one was an appropriated bird’s nest in a tree by the wooded area near where he (human him, at least) had used to live. He wasn’t human anymore though. He was an owl now.

It was his quirk.

It had to be.

Izuku hadn’t paid it too much mind and it had taken him a while to get used to living as a bird anyways. He could barely even fly when he first started. He barely even knew what was going on when he first realized he no longer had fingers.

Everything was scary. Things were so much bigger when you were smaller. The air conditioner alley that had been his home for those days had been so loud, the rumbling noises never stopping. He spent most of his time huddled against the wall, only coming out to hunt the rats that were attracted to the remnants of food that littered the alleyway.

He had left as soon as he could reliably fly, making his way back to his house under the cover of night. Hiding was easier done when there were less people around. He found that he preferred the night more now.

Izuku had stayed in the area for a long time. Had checked his house every night. But he had never seen his Mama again. No one at the windows. No one going shopping for groceries. No Kacchan asking him to come play.

Izuku spent his time listening instead.

He heard many things. He had quickly realized that owls had really good hearing. Hiding in the branches of a tree, he listened.

“Matsumoto-san! Are you headed to the shopping street?”

“Of course! The super sale starts this evening! I’m hoping to stock up on ingredients for sukiyaki!”

“Ishihara-kun! Let’s go to the arcade together!”

“If it’s with you, Kotori-chan, I’m happy to spend a few hours there!”

“Headed home, Tokiya?”

“Nah, I’ve got cram school.”

And then one early evening, he heard it.

“Hey, did you hear what happened to the Midoriyas?”

“Mm, yeah. Spontaneous combustion, right? Scary!”

“Keep it to yourself, but I heard the son is gone too.”

“Do you think the house is going to get sold?”

“I hope not! Living near a house where someone just burned to death like that is creepy..”

“Right? They should just tear it down and rebuild over it.”

Izuku had flown off in a flurry of feathers right after that.

It was that night that he figured out that owls couldn’t cry.

The very next night, he started flying further than he ever tried. He didn’t want to stay there. He didn’t want to see the destruction of his house. If he couldn’t live there with his Mama, he couldn’t stay there at all. It was no longer his home.

It was hard to resist turning back when the sun started to slowly rise, painting the sky in a motley of pastels. He had hidden himself in an empty planter, the overhang of the balcony covering him from sight.

He had continued flying during the night, diving for rats whenever he sighted them with no humans in the vicinity. Izuku didn’t even have to think about gobbling down rats now with his instincts leading him. The guilt he once felt for not cooking his meat had been pushed aside. Izuku didn’t even know if owls ate cooked meat. He eventually did spend a few hours with an outdoor yakitori stand in view and didn’t feel the urge to grab one even when he was hungry. He had left soon afterwards, sighting a rat which he had gleefully dove on top of and finished before making his way back to the sky.

That had been a long time ago too. Snow fell and then it got hot again. Izuku wondered if he was seven yet. Did owls even celebrate birthdays? He didn’t know. It was at these times that he wished he could find out, but he was pretty sure owls weren’t allowed in libraries. And that was fine! Owls didn’t need libraries! All he needed was a home and food. And he had that now.

Izuku had made his roost in the top floor of an abandoned building, the open windows providing easy access for entering and exiting. His yellow backpack (the last thing his Mama had given him) was stashed in a corner, along with other bits and bobs that he would sometimes pick up that piqued his interest. So far, he had a few bottle caps, his molted feathers, pencils, and the erasers that were picked off carefully from the pencils. He hooted lowly to himself in satisfaction, the sound echoing in the otherwise bare room.

Pushing himself off his ledge, he quickly made his way up to a taller building, his wings easily catching an updraft. He landed, talons carefully grasping the guardrails. He had learned his lesson early on when he nearly slipped off trying to hold onto the metal. He would have preferred a brick and mortar, but those tended to be too low for what he wanted to see.

As he bobbed his head slightly, eyes taking in everything below him, he felt a small bubble of protectiveness. This was all his. This was his new home. His territory.

Well.

Mostly his territory at least.

After all, there was a hero that patrolled here at night sometimes.

And Izuku loved to watch him from afar.

He had nicknamed the hero ‘Owlman’ at the beginning (those ambush attacks looked just like how he caught his meals!), only learning that his actual hero name was ‘Eraserhead’ when he had flown in closer, hearing the man calling in villains that he had taken down. That was when he started picking up pencils.

Izuku wasn’t sure he wanted to be a human again, but if he ever did, he’d like to write in his notebooks again. It’s not as if being an owl was bad! Being an owl was better than being dead! Like Mama is.

Of course there were things he did miss from before.

Like his fingers! And his room! Maybe even Kacchan!

But most of all.

Izuku missed watching All Might’s super cool debut video.

(But now he could watch Eraserhead running and hopping across roofs all night if he really wanted to - It was like live hero TV!)

So, Izuku supposed, being an owl was fine.

He could live without fingers and his old room. He could definitely live without Kacchan (who had called him names all the time now). He could even live without All Might’s video (Mama would never be there to open the video for him again).

Like this, he didn’t need anyone. He had food, water, and a home.

No one would be able to find him.

People thought he was dead.

Izuku was an owl now.

He was safe.

Aizawa Shouta was tired.

Granted, he was often tired. But working in the depths of the seedy Underground always seemed to drain whatever energy he did have, spit it out onto the ground, and then stamp on it a few times for good measure. Heroics was a dangerous occupation as a whole, but Underground Heroics was a different species on it’s own. The worst of human nature seeped through the cracks of society and made itself apparent in the darkness of night.

Despite that, he could never regret choosing to go Underground.

He wanted to save and help others.

Taking out the scumbags that facilitated danger out in the streets was just a bonus.

Sure it was never-ending work, but there were times where he could grab a minute or two for himself, pour a cup of coffee down his throat, and then relish the caffeine for another minute before swinging himself back up to continue his patrol. Occasionally, he’d even have time to enjoy a jelly pouch while out and about.

That was what he found himself doing right now. Shouta perched himself on the roof of an apartment building and unscrewed the cap off of the pouch, immediately sucking up the contents with a slurp. Leaning lightly against the guardrails, he looked down over the city.

Everything looked so much more innocent from up here. The streetlights were like pin pricks against a dark canvas, their incessant buzzing undertone unable to be heard from a distance. Buildings jutting up towards the sky, like a road of puzzle blocks for him to traverse on. And more regularly than ever, the hooting of an owl.

That owl was an elusive thing.

In the last few months, he’d been hearing it more and more frequently. Seeing the bird however, was a different story. It may as well have been a ghost, leaving nothing behind but the reverberation of its call. Shouta had never been that interested in owls, not like he was cats, but he had ended up checking out small video clips of them in action one lazy afternoon and decided then and there that yeah, they were pretty cool.

He agreed with a comment he had seen on an owl compilation video.

Owls were like cats with wings.

Uu-hoo

Shouta snapped his eyes up in the general direction at which the hoot came from, scanning buildings for anything vaguely owl-shaped. He had nearly passed over the blob, a stark black against the white of the full moon, eyes continuing to travel the roof of another building, but a small shift in movement tugged his attention back.

He squinted.

That was an owl, alright. He could just make out the two tufts of feathers on the head swaying from a small breeze. It was too dark to make out specific details, but that was fine. It would be nice to give Hizashi an update on the mysterious owl that he had been hearing when he was on duty.

And in a blink, the owl leapt down from its perch, body seamlessly blending into the dark with wings open and flew off, quickly disappearing from his line of sight.

Shouta huffed into his capture weapon, pushing himself away from the railings and tossing his empty jelly pouch into the dumpster parked right by the apartment building.

That owl had the right idea.

It was time to get back to work.

Crime waited for no one.

Had Eraserhead seen him?

Izuku had fled as soon as he realized that the hero was looking in his direction. He promptly made his way to the nearest park and into a tree’s branches. The owl dared not to even move a muscle. Thoughts raced through his head, feeding into one another and blurring.

Mama said to hide.

He can’t find me.

What if he finds me.

Does he know it was me.

I need to hide.

I need to hide.

Izuku stayed there until the sun started rising, the dark of night being slowly chased away. He spent that time trying to settle his thoughts. He couldn’t see or hear any people yet, but he could hear the morning warbles of songbirds and the coos of pigeons welcoming the new day.

He couldn’t stay out any longer.

This was too out in the open.

He breathed in.

Once. Twice.

Flinging himself off the branch that he had been occupying, Izuku flapped, wings barely wavering as he soared up. He was thankful that flying came so easily with practice. With how he felt right now, he wasn’t entirely sure he’d be able to fly without outright slamming himself into something. He still did his best to not stray into the widening patches of sunlight.

By the time he had made it back to his roost, Izuku was exhausted. Sunbeams were streaming in through his window, so the owl laid himself out on his stomach, wings splayed out, finally able to relax again. He soaked in the warmth, eyes sliding half shut, already getting drowsy.

Was this okay?

Did he need to leave?

He didn't want to leave. It had taken him so long to find a place like this. There was even a small lake in one of the bigger parks a few minutes from here! Good water was hard to find, especially since he didn't want to drink from dirty puddles on the streets. People stepped on dog poops sometimes after all.

This was his territory.

He shared it with Eraserhead. And Eraserhead was a hero. A really cool hero.

He knew that Mama had said that the heroes wouldn't help, but he had been watching Eraserhead for so long now.

Izuku’s mind wandered idly as he finally dozed off, talons curled up snug underneath him.

If Mama had asked Eraserhead for help, would the hero have given it to her?

Shouta had gotten home just before the sun had started to rise, shedding his capture weapon and flopping himself onto the couch for a quick nap before his husband would wake up to start his day. It felt like he had just closed his eyes, merely having a long blink, before he heard the shower turning on and the consequent trill of English lyrics.

He pushed himself up, reminding himself that he could get some actual sleep after Hizashi left for the radio station. Breakfast was one of the few times where they could spend some time together considering their conflicted work schedules.

Shouta quickly put together a simple and light breakfast of scrambled eggs and toast, serving them on two plates which he then placed on the kitchen table along with a bottle of ketchup. He shook it and squeezed out the cherry red condiment onto Hizashi's eggs. Two dots for eyes. And a shallow arc for a smile.

Perhaps it was a bit silly of a tradition, but it was harmless, and Hizashi tended to be more upbeat on days he sent him off with a smile. Even if it was made of ketchup on his eggs.

As he put the finishing touches on his own eggs, with just a shake of salt and pepper, Hizashi walked in, his blond hair already tied in a half ponytail.

"Shou!," He exclaimed, a grin splitting his face, "Is that a smile just for me?"

"Shut up," Shouta scoffed, the faintest of blushes marking the tips of his ears, "Who else would it be for."

Hizashi only laughed in response, making kissy lips at him before pouring out a cup of coffee to bring with him to the table. Lime eyes studied him carefully, flicking to his torso and then to his legs, peering out from behind prescription red rimmed glasses.

"Your patrol went well?" The blond man finally sat down at the table, another grin tugging at his lips as he looked down at his scrambled eggs again, "No knife fights at least?"

"I saw the owl last night," Shouta said instead as he forked up a bite of scrambled egg, (he won the knife fight, thank you very much), "It was kinda far from me, but it's definitely out there."

"Ohhh, that's neato!" Hizashi replied, easily accepting the change in subject, eyes gleaming in interest, "Next time, you should snap a photo or something. Owls aren't exactly common in the city, ya know."

Shouta hummed, the tone noncommittal.

"I wanna see the owl too, Shou!" Hizashi whined, lips in an exaggerated pout, his fork waving and nearly flying out of his grasp, "The only birds I ever see are pigeons that keep shitting on the balcony."

“I don’t see them,” He mumbled as a reply, “They must like you.”

“You know what’d be cool?!” Hizashi exclaimed as he swallowed the last of his toast. Not waiting for a reply, he continued, “If your owl came by and just ate those fuckers! Like BLAM-KABAM! Then I wouldn’t have to spend any of my precious time cleaning up pigeon shits! And your owl would have dinner!”

“Not my owl,” The dark haired man rolled his eyes, “And I’m pretty sure owls don’t blam any kabams, ‘Zashi. They’re silent predators.”

“Geez, you party pooper,” The blond grumbles with fondness still apparent in his voice, “It’d be kickass though.”

“Yeah, yeah, whatever,” Shouta returns quietly, “Don’t you need to leave?”

“Oh shit!” Hizashi glanced over at the clock with wide eyes, and swiftly swept the remains of his eggs into his mouth, “Shoulda said that sooner!”

“I’ve got the dishes,” Waving away the radio host who was hovering over the empty plates, Shouta hip checked him as he made his way to the sink, “Don’t be late.”

“You’re the best!” Hizashi gave him a dazzling grin as he smacked a loud kiss on his cheek, “Thanks for the smile!”

“Oh shut it.”

“I’m headed out!”

“Mm, see you later.”

God, he loved that man.

Notes:

    Did you know that owlets sleep/nap on their stomachs because their heads are too heavy and their bodies can't support them yet? Had me a giggle when I learned that and then I saw that I already had Izuku sleeping on his belly in this chapter :D Big brain moment!

    Thanks for all the love! I was ecstatic to see that this was well-received! I hope you enjoyed this chapter! Haha Izuku sure didn't have a good time, but Shouta did c:

    If you've got the time, please let me know your thoughts and opinions! ngl when I found out I made a few of your hearts break last chapter, I rubbed my tiny gremlin hands together with glee xD

    Next chapter update will be April 10th :D See you there!

Chapter Text

It had been a few nights since Izuku had watched for Eraserhead.

Don’t get him wrong! He still thought that the hero was awesome! He was even more awesome than he first thought actually! Izuku hadn’t seen or heard anyone looking for him even though he was sure that Eraserhead had at least caught a glimpse of him perched on the building!

That meant that either Eraserhead didn’t know the owl was Izuku or he didn’t care that the owl was Izuku. Both were good options.

Izuku was glad.

He and Eraserhead could co-exist without any issues if it was like this. Plus, he really missed his nights of hero watching; it reminded him of when he would watch All Might’s debut video or when Mama had allowed him to watch hero fights on TV. That wasn’t something he could do again, but this was close enough for him. It was enough.

Izuku’s Mama was gone. She had said that heroes and police wouldn’t help.

Izuku shouldn’t expect any help.

Izuku didn’t need any help.

It would have to be enough for Izuku to watch Eraserhead help others.

Because Izuku didn’t know what else he could do.

With a finishing nibble to one of his soon-to-be molted feathers, the owl flew off into the night ready to once again seek out the pro hero that he wanted to see again.

Shouta hadn’t heard any hoots in the last few nights. He wasn't exactly worried, per say, but he knew that wild animals like owls didn't always fare well in the busy city. It was already a fair amount of luck that owls tended to be nocturnal, already avoiding a lot of the general populace.

He ended up checking Hero Network for any alerts on missing animals from nearby zoos. Honestly, he wasn't sure he was relieved or not finding that all the zoo animals were accounted for and that the local owl wasn't a wanted escapee. The owl had to have come from somewhere. However, zoos were not the answer. But where else could it have come from?

It was entirely possible that it could have been someone's pet. An owl that was human-reared could likely be well adjusted to living in the city. Shouta didn't think it was a pet though. If it was an escaped pet, he's certain that there would have been measures to track, capture, and return it back to the owner. If it was a released pet, he's sure that it likely would have originally gone to some animal rehabilitation shelter to prime it to release back into the wild.

He was sure it was a wild owl.

But deliberately choosing to make a home in the human-infested city when the sky offered endless roads to better, and probably cleaner, places? Illogical.

The decision made was one he didn't mind though.

It was such an insignificant thing, but he had grown fond of the nightly hooting that accompanied his patrols.

At least there's plenty of food in a place like this, Shouta mused as he turned a corner, peeking into a silent side street, catching a naked rat tail disappearing into a trash bag. Those things could get huge.

Uu-hoo

He spun, eyes already scanning for the owner of the hoot.

It only took a few seconds to place where the sound had some from. The owl, who was perched on some craggy overhang, hooted once more before flying off, presumably to catch their meal.

Ah. I forgot to take a photo for Hizashi.

Maybe next time.

Shouta turned, using his capture weapon to pull himself up onto a nearby roof. He would never admit it aloud, but his heart did rest a touch lighter, knowing that owl was fine and not dying some horrid death in a dumpster or something. It wasn't as if he could really keep an eye out for a wild creature that could fly about as it wished.

And if he had volunteered to be on the task force of an exotic animal smuggling ring the next day, well, no one but him had to know about his reasoning.

Izuku had a patrol route of sorts.

It depended on how hungry he was and if he felt dusty or not. If he did feel in need of a bath, he would visit a bird fountain that was located in one of the smaller parks. He’d then hunt in the park for stray pigeons that weren’t with their flock. He had also noticed that there were mice in the park, which were a nice snack if they came out scrounging for food where he could hear them. If he was already clean, preening and all already taken care of, he’d take up watch near one of the dumpsters that he had already marked down in his memory as one that was almost consistently very full. Izuku always made sure that he never hunted at the same dumpster too often before moving on to another. He didn’t want the rats to start avoiding the area.

After he had eaten his fill, he’d fly up to one of the taller buildings to watch the city. It was usually around this time that he would catch his first glimpse of Eraserhead. He doesn’t know how long he spends up there, but when he knew the sun was going to rise soon, he would leave, making his way back to his roost.

Early on when he was still new to the area, he would go exploring every night. It only made sense to figure out the best places to find his next meal, or where to get fresh water to drink or bathe in. It also helped to figure out places he should avoid. It was a weird instinct he had, one he had to fight, to avoid humans altogether. He was thankful that being an owl let him hear and see so much better. It was much easier to live alongside people when they never noticed him around in the first place.

Sure, Eraserhead knew he was around, but so far nothing had ever happened even with the hero knowing about his existence. Izuku was relatively certain the dark haired pro was safe. Izuku wasn’t sure he’d ever find someone safe again. Mama was gone and Kacchan had stopped being safe ever since he had told him that he was Quirkless. Daddy.. Hi-sa-shi.. Izuku carefully sounded out the syllables in his mind; he had never been safe either. He remembered telling Mama about his thoughts and while she hadn’t been too happy to hear what he thought, she had told him to trust his instincts, to believe in his gut feeling.

Izuku knew he wasn’t wrong in saying that his instincts were what allowed him to live. It had taken him a long time to properly figure out the differences between the owl instincts and his own (human) thoughts and urges. It had taken him even longer to accept that both were just himself, just the new Izuku.

That was the reason why Eraserhead was safe. The very first night he had sighted the elusive hero, he was torn between excitement and moving to leave the area immediately. His owl instincts had screeched at him, recognizing the man as a predator, an apex predator. It was obvious at that time to him, that this hero had already claimed this territory as his own and that he’d be trespassing if he remained. Two more nights had passed before he had convinced himself to stay. That things would be safer with a hero in the area.

Izuku was glad he did stay.

He didn’t even really know Eraserhead. All he did was watch and occasionally hoot to catch the hero’s attention for a few seconds, only when he wasn’t fighting and when he was alone, of course. Izuku knew they had something in common though. They both protected the city at night. Eraserhead patrolled and took down baddies while Izuku caught rats and sometimes pigeons, so they couldn’t make a mess in dumpsters or multiply so quickly that they would be everywhere.

Izuku knew that Eraserhead did much more than he did, but that was alright. Izuku was only an owl. And owls couldn’t be heroes. That really didn’t stop him from watching the hero as he did his work though. He was careful to not perch onto tall buildings so as to not give away his location by his silhouette and also not get too close so that his eyes would be visible to the man. Izuku had been pleased to find out that he had kept the color of his eyes as an owl, but even he knew that owls didn’t have green eyes.

It was one of his already clean nights; Izuku had been awake since the early evening, the sky streaked in orange. He had spent his extra free time preening his feathers and nipping off the erasers from a few new pencils he had picked up the previous night.

When the sky had finally turned dark, Izuku had left his roost and gone hunting by a dumpster. It didn’t take him long to catch a few rats, the ravenous owl devouring them quickly while still on the ground. When he had finally been sated, Izuku left to go find Eraserhead.

It didn’t take long, especially since it was so much easier to find things, like that cool scarf that Eraserhead used, when you were higher up.

Eraserhead was fighting today, Izuku noted. He had seen a few of the hero’s fights, but rarely did he see him going against more than three people at the same time. He was going up against five this time. Well, four now. Eraserhead really was cool.

Izuku watched as the pro swung around hooking his scarf to an adjacent fire escape, slamming his booted foot into the face of one of the remaining men. A flash of silver caught the owl's eye. Izuku recognized it as the glare of a knife under light. Eraserhead had a knife he would use to cut the people he captured loose from the main portion of his scarf.

This wasn’t Eraserhead’s knife though.

Eraserhead wasn't even looking in that direction, currently preoccupied with the two that were double-teaming him, forcing him against a wall.

Izuku might not need any help.

But it looked as if right now, Eraserhead did.

Before he could think of anything else, he found himself pushing off from his perch, eyes were already locked onto the knife in one of the goon’s hands. As the pro ducked under a punch, Izuku dove and screeched at the same time. The armed man startled, the blade of the knife only slashing lightly into the hero's shoulder. With his talons outstretched, Izuku easily snatched the knife away from its owner.

"What the fuck, my knife!" He heard from behind him, "You have an attack bird?!"

Izuku flew upwards, landing with one clawed foot and balancing onto the neck of a lamppost, the other foot still grasping the stolen knife.

While the owl carefully shifted the knife so that he was gripping onto the handle instead of the blade, Eraserhead quickly took down the other three, Izuku being ample distraction.

The owl watched cautiously as the pro squinted up at him, his blood shot eyes clearly visible.

He pulled his phone out, calling in his take down, before fiddling with it and quickly snapping a photo.

"Hizashi is never going to fucking believe this."

Izuku bobbed his head, cooing. Who was Hizashi and why did Eraserhead want a photo? The owl wasn't sure, but he was still curious enough to not fly off straight away like he wanted to. The hero did get injured after all. Maybe if Izuku had seen the knife earlier or if he had flown faster, Eraserhead wouldn't have gotten hurt. Izuku really hoped he was okay; he could see the blood that stained the knife he still had.

"Thanks."

The owl blinked in reply before cooing again. Izuku hadn't been expecting thanks, but it gave him a warm fuzzy feeling. He liked it.

"Could I have the knife?"

Izuku dropped the knife immediately, the metal clanging against the ground. As the pro hero bent to pick it up, Izuku made his escape, flapping silently into a planter filled with flowers.

It was irrational to worry about the hero, Izuku knew, but he couldn't stop himself from worrying. He would follow the hero home tonight. Just to make sure he would be alright.

Shouta had a fucking night.

He didn't know what was more absurd. The owl involving itself into a fight (his fight) and stealing a knife? Or him talking to the owl afterwards as if it could understand what he was saying.

It didn't take long for the police to arrive, and after a quick statement (where he didn't mention any knife-stealing owls, thanks), he continued with his patrol. Thankfully, the rest of his shift passed by uneventfully and he made his way home ready to bandage his cut and get some rest.

The rest of the night was a blur as he treated himself in the bathroom and collapsed gracelessly into his and Hizashi's shared bed and fell asleep as soon as his head touched his pillow.

When he woken up in the morning, he wondered briefly if he had hallucinated up the whole night. Perhaps it was a quirk he didn't manage to cancel in time? A bleary-eyed check into his phone's gallery only confirmed it was no hallucination.

Hizashi was already humming in the bathroom, getting ready for the day. At times, Shouta still couldn’t believe he had married his high school sweetheart. But even he knew that what they had together was something he never wanted to be rid of. But, by the gods, if Hizashi left his loose hair clogging the shower drain again, he would make the blond eat it.

Shouta made himself get out of bed, meandering his way to the kitchen. Setting the kettle to boil for some tea, he quickly fell into the practiced motions of cooking a traditional Japanese breakfast.

Aizawa Shouta had grown up in a very traditional family. With a strict father at the helm of the household, Shouta had ended up spending large portions of his childhood in the kitchen watching his mother at the stove creating their meals. As he had gotten older, he started helping out more and more. The length of time to bake fillets of salmon. The ingredients that best complemented a miso soup. The flick of the wrist to make the nicest shaped tamagoyaki. He learned it all right at his mother’s elbows. Even now, when he very rarely had the time to create a meal like this, he enjoyed it when he had the chance to.

Today, Hizashi had an afternoon patrol and a night shift at the radio station. It left their morning free for once, without having to rush through breakfast. The dark haired man made sure to bake an extra salmon fillet for onigiri that Hizashi could drop off at the radio station for midnight snacking.

“What’s cookin’, handsome?” Hizashi sashayed himself into the kitchen with a grin, his hair bundled up in a rainbow scrunchie, “Smells tasty!”

“Just the usual,” Hizashi raised an eyebrow looking at the simmering soup full of tofu and seaweed, “Well, my usual.”

“Your patrol go well?” The blond squinted at him, “You’re in a suspiciously good mood today and it’s still morning. You hate mornings.”

“I saw the owl again last night,” Shouta grinned unabashedly as he stirred his soup, giving a nod to his phone that he had left on the coffee table, “Even got you that photo you wanted.”

“Oh shit!” The radio host whooped in glee as he hurried his way to the phone, tapping the passcode in with no pause in motion, “You da man!”

A beat of silence passed as Hizashi stared at the photo that was taken.

“That’s a big bird, Shou.”

“Mm.”

"What's it got there?"

"A knife."

"What the fuck." Hizashi’s eyes very nearly bugged out before he repeated himself in quirk activated English, "What the fUCK."

Shouta spun with ladle in hand, eyes flashing crimson, Erasure activating in annoyance, causing the blond man to sputter and sheepishly apologize. The dark haired pro turned back to the stove with a frown to check in on the salmon. Hizashi continued his questioning with just a touch more hysteria in his voice.

“Why’s it got a knife??”

“Stole it from one of the thugs I was going to take down.”

“Did you get stabbed?!

“No.”

“Did anyone get stabbed??”

“No.”

“.. Do you think the big bird has a quirk? I don’t think this is normal bird behavior.”

Shouta paused in the middle of removing the baking tray from the oven.

Was it possible?

Sure, he had thought it odd that a wild animal would choose to live in the city, but would a wild animal with a quirk feel the same way? It hadn’t done anything to him, despite him sighting it more often than ever now. Now that Hizashi had brought it up, he couldn’t think of anything else but that possibility.

That owl did have bright green eyes. He had never seen any owl with that kind of eye color. Was it just the color of the eyes that was a quirk? Or was it something like… an intelligence quirk?

Shouta groaned; this was really not how he wanted his morning to go. He had wanted a nice quiet morning with his husband, not intense thought experiments about the possibility of a quirked predator making its home in the city.

A wild animal that seemed to prefer the cityscape instead of anywhere else it could travel? That knew to take a knife away from someone else? That also seemingly understood human speech?

There was a quirk involved. Shouta was sure of it.

Was there anything he could do in this situation?

If it was any sort of intelligence quirk at play, then all he had to do was gain the trust of the wild owl.

Anything else could be reasoned out later.

Chapter Text

Izuku was lonely.

It was something he experienced often enough even when he had been a human, but on some nights, it just really got to him, making everything feel worse. It was like a cold flame inside him, infecting everything it could get it’s greedy little fingers into.

Back then, it was manageable. During the day, even if Kacchan wasn’t nice to him anymore, the boy would at least talk to him (even if it was mostly about how he was a Deku and how he could never be a hero). At night, he would either work on his hero notebook with his Mama or help with drying the dishes. She would hug him afterwards. She gave really good hugs.

But Mama was no longer there to comfort him. Kacchan wasn’t there to insult him. All he had was the cold and silent emptiness of his roost and the bright lights of the city when he flew over it.

Izuku knew that he couldn’t always just keep flying over the city when he got lonely. Not only was there a chance that someone could see him, he’d have to hunt more often since he’d be much more hungry afterwards.

Visiting Eraserhead was reckless. He knew that. He did.

But Eraserhead had talked to him. Thanked him.

Izuku didn’t realize that someone just acknowledging him would give him this sort of feeling. Even after he had ‘escorted’ Eraserhead back to his apartment building, the owl had ridden the high off of that encounter for a while, doing his best to do barrel rolls in the sky during overcast nights.

But soon enough, the loneliness set in again.

He had continued watching Eraserhead during his patrols, the man in question frequently checking the skies when he wasn’t taking down people breaking the law. Despite that, Izuku stayed hidden; he wasn’t sure what to do after getting so up close with the pro hero.

Did he trust Eraserhead?

He supposed he did. That wasn’t what the issue was though. Izuku had always loved heroes. Had always trusted heroes. Had always trusted that they would do the right thing. To save people. To help others. That was what a hero was to Izuku.

Eraserhead was a good hero. Izuku knew that from watching him. He patrolled at night and fought crime. He comforted others after they were attacked. He did all of this without a visible quirk.

Izuku was pretty sure he liked Eraserhead more than he liked All Might now.

The issue was that Mama said that the heroes didn’t want to help them. Izuku would like to think that Eraserhead would have helped them. But it was something he would never know now.

It would be fine, Izuku reasoned with himself, Eraserhead had no idea who Midoriya Izuku was. And Midoriya Izuku was dead. He was just Izuku now. Izuku the owl.

Mama had told him to hide after all.

He would win this final game for his Mama.

As long as Eraserhead never found out who he really was, everything would be alright.

Shouta had not seen those green eyes in over a week. It was slightly unnerving, as much as he hated to admit it. Hizashi had insisted that the owl liked him. But seeing as he had not seen even a faint owl-shaped silhouette recently, he sincerely doubted the blond’s words. How was he supposed to earn the trust of a wild animal if said animal wasn’t even around for him to try?

If it was anything like the feral or stray cats he would sometimes see in the streets, he knew he was in for a future of sharp claws and nipping beaks. He’d take that over the knife carrying though. Hizashi, after he had gotten over his shock at the contents of the photo, had taken the photo and run away with it, saving it as his phone’s lockscreen and then creating memes. Shouta couldn’t help but think that the raptor and Hizashi might actually get along as he imagined the owl perched on Hizashi-as-Present-Mic’s wild cockatoo-like crest of a hairdo. He hid his amusement behind his capture weapon. If he ever had the chance, he knew he’d have to try to get that to happen.

He made his way home on the empty streets, shadows long and distorted by the sporadic blinking of the street light. It was yet another patrol over with no owl sighting.

Uu-hoo

Shouta immediately looked up when he heard the echoing hoot, eyes already scanning for the owl. It didn't take long before he located the bird who was watching him from a tree, the darker-toned autumn leaves helping it blend in almost seamlessly. However, those big green eyes were a big giveaway to its position, he mused.

He hadn't realized that there was a chance he'd be seeing the bird of prey right by his home. Did the owl follow him back before? He had never noticed anything like that, but he supposed it was just an owl doing what an owl does. They were notorious for being silent fliers and Shouta could say with confidence that he had never heard the owl without first being alerted beforehand.

"I'm Aizawa Shouta," The hero gave a shallow bow in the tree's direction. He really hoped no one was watching him right now. If he had to explain his actions to anyone, he was going to be annoyed.

A chirp and a tilt of a feathery head was the reply given. Nice. This really could be an intelligence quirk.

"As you may know, I live in the building right here," Shouta continued, "If you'd like, you could come visit sometime?"

This time, a clack of the beak. Right.

"I'll go in and show you where our balcony is," The hero quickly finished and speed-walked towards the entrance and called over his shoulder, "Please don't fly away yet."

Shouta started running as soon as he hit the stairs, completely ignoring the elevator. By the time he had reached his floor, he was locked in a dead sprint. Almost tripping as he stopped at their door, he hastily unlocked it, shoving it closed once he entered. A quick turn and the door was locked once again. Hizashi would never forgive him if he forgot to lock the door, even if it was to show an owl where they lived.

He kicked his boots off, forgoing house slippers and glided straight to the sliding glass doors that led to their small apartment balcony. Shouta stepped outside, the cool night wind blowing into their living room. Peering over the edge, he hoped that the owl was still there. Almost straight away, green eyes met his own.

The owl had stayed. Shouta almost couldn't believe it. They stared at each other, no words or vocalizations passing between them. The hero took a deep breath and whispered.

"Thank you."

One second passed. Two seconds. Three.

Uu-hoo

The owl finally replied. And with that, the bird dropped out of the tree, wings already spread out and gliding silently away.

The dark haired man watched as the owl got further and further away, the dark shape blending expertly into the shadows of the night.

Shouta sighed.

How was he going to explain this to Hizashi?

It had been a few nights after Izuku had met with Eraserhe- no, he introduced himself as Ai-za-wa. It had been a long time since he had learned someone’s name. Owls didn’t speak like humans, so he’d never have the chance to say the pro’s name, but it was a principle for him. Ever since he hadn’t been able to pronounce Kacchan’s name when he was younger, he would practice pronunciation on his own. He had his own I-zu-ku. Mama was I-n-ko. And there was Hi-sa-shi. (And Ka-tsu-ki). And now Ai-za-wa. And while he couldn’t say them out loud to make sure they were correct, he could still try with his imagination.

Izuku was excited. It may not have seemed as much, but the opportunity to see Aizawa-san’s home really was tempting. And he had an invitation too! That meant the hero wanted to see him more often, right?

He was a bit worried though. Should he bring something with him? It was only proper, bringing a small gift on the first visit to someone’s home. Izuku didn’t think Aizawa-san would be pleased if he brought over a nice rat though, or even a pigeon. He wasn’t even sure if humans ate those? He was pretty sure his Mama had never let him have those back then at least.

Izuku clicked his beak in annoyance. Was it really that hard to figure out a small gift for someone else? Could he give the pro hero an eraser? He had a few of those and plus, erasers for Eraserhead made a lot of sense. And they were very helpful if you needed to erase anything. Owls had no fingers or thumbs, so it’s not as if he could write anymore.

Yes, he decided. Erasers would be perfect for a gift.

Plucking up a few of the small erasers, Izuku quickly winged his way to Aizawa-san’s home. He wanted to make sure he dropped them off before he had to go hunt later that night. The sky was already turning dark, so the owl felt comfortable leaving his roost earlier than he usually did.

The balcony was empty when he arrived. He glided down, dropping the erasers as he swerved and immediately retreated back into a nearby tree. Izuku wanted to wait until the sun fully set before he started hunting for his meal to lower the chances of him being seen. This area that Aizawa-san lived in had a fair amount of people living in it. While the hero was alright with him, he didn’t know anything about anyone else who lived here.

Minutes passed, the sky steadily getting darker and darker. Izuku could hear so many people. Their footsteps, their voices. This was the closest he had been to so many humans in a long time. He was glad that he was hidden in the tree. The owl made sure that his eyes were semi-lidded as well. It would be horrible if he had gotten seen because of his un-owl-like eye color.

A coo.

Izuku perked up. A pigeon! He tilted his head from side to side, triangulating the pigeon’s location. The most acute sounds of claws clicking against concrete were heard by his ears. The slight sound of a beak preening feathers, and then the ruffle of the same feathers were as well. The owl swept his lidded gaze across his current vicinity, which was thankfully devoid of humans for now. He then directed his gaze up, directly honing onto Aizawa-san’s balcony where he knew the pigeon was located. Izuku slowly made his way up the tree’s branches, keeping close to the trunk while he was at it. He had never tried to catch anything starting from a lower position before and with how the balconies were organized, he was afraid he might accidentally crash into something. It was too bad that no tree here was tall enough to be eye level with the balcony. That would have been perfect. Pigeons on their lonesome were much easier to deal with. The amount of noise pigeons would make if he tried snagging one when they were grouped together was absurd. He had tried it only once and never again.

Faced with such an easy meal, how was he supposed to resist?

By the time Izuku had made it to the topmost branch of the tree, still stories below where the pigeon was nesting for the night, the sky was much darker, now in shades of dusky purple.

He was glad. Night was the safest for someone like him.

Izuku hopped off the branch, flapping his wings a few times to gain necessary height. As soon as he had that, he swerved, wings angling to allow him to reposition himself mid-flight if he needed to. Carefully making sure he wouldn’t knock himself into the landing of the balcony above Aizawa-san’s, Izuku dove, talons thrusting out.

It took less than a second for him to strike into his meal.

The owl chirped happily, nudging the erasers closer to the doors before digging the claws of one leg deeper into the now dead pigeon. With a cautious flap, Izuku leapt up, bracing himself on the ledge with his free leg. Not waiting to fully balance, he pushed off with the pigeon still clutched tightly in his grip.

With only a slight wobble from the additional weight carried that he quickly was corrected, Izuku flew off, as if he was never there.

It was rare that Aizawa Shouta had the entire day off.

In this particular case, he had gotten his ankle sprained the previous night, the hospital ordering him to take it easy on that ankle for the next couple of days. Hizashi had immediately forced him into compliance with his wibbly lips. Shouta spent his suddenly freed up hours taking all the naps he could and reading a bit up on owls. Any extra knowledge could only help him at this point.

Hizashi had already left for the studio hours ago and so far, nothing substantial had happened. He was relaxing in bed, eyes drooping when he heard a small thud. But after waiting a second with no change, he had ended up pulling his laptop from his desk to his lap. Opening the security camera program he had installed when he and Hizashi had moved in together, he quickly clicked into the past records of the security footage. He couldn’t just ignore a sound like that, especially if it was on their balcony. What if it was a villain? They lived relatively high up, but there were definitely villains with quirks that allowed them to easily climb walls or leap great distances.

Shouta was always careful not that nobody followed him home and he impressed that onto Hizashi as well. In fact, the only time he’d actually let someone know where he lived was when he had shown the owl their balcony. He was hoping it was just the owl popping by for a visit; that was something he had been looking forward to.

He carefully rewinded the footage back a few minutes, and pressed play.

He watched.

Had a sip of his decaffeinated tea (ugh, thanks ‘Zashi).

And sighed.

At least it was just the owl.

Shouta relaxed back into his pillow for a bit and then froze.

It was the owl.

He scrambled out of bed, taking the laptop and his tea with him to the living room. Placing both down on the coffee table, he hurriedly drew open the curtains to the balcony windows. Dark eyes inspected the landing, quickly drawn to the small.. objects laying there, a stark white against the concrete.

Shouta squinted. Were these what the owl had dropped off before helping itself to that balcony pigeon that Hizashi complained about so much? (At least there would be no more complaints about pigeon shits now.)

He slid open the glass door just a smidge to pick one up.

It was an eraser.

Was this some sort of threat?

Wouldn’t it have been more effective if the dead pigeon had been left on the balcony as well?

Shouta grumbled as he picked up the rest of the erasers, noting that they had been chewed on before, bits of it very crumbly and already falling onto the floor. If he was correct, and he was pretty sure he was, then where were the pencils the erasers came from? Did the owl know how to write? Why just bring the heads.. of .. the .. pencils.

They were eraser heads, Shouta marveled to himself. The only other way to easily convey this would have been to literally drop them on his head. The pro was glad that was not the choice the owl had made in the end. With this though, it was almost obvious that the owl had some sort of intelligence quirk. Knowing he was Eraserhead and being able to identify erasers and equate them with him? That was some next level thought process.

He sank back onto the couch after sliding the door closed, tugging his laptop closer. He quickly cut out the portion of footage with the owl, saving it and then switched to a tab already open to the Hero Network.

Shouta frowned to himself. Should he be using the Hero Network for this? He wasn't trying to earn the trust of the owl for some official hero mission. And while he was trying to ask for assistance, it was more of an advice sort of thing. Plus.. he didn't really want other heroes to know about the owl. It would be a mess if others found out. Probably.

He groaned, opening a new tab for his personal email. He wanted a private conversation and by the gods, he was going to make sure he had one. Even if it meant using his personal email to contact his old teacher.

The underground hero typed, the sound of the keys clacking filling the room.

    Subject: Owl Living in Musutafu (Quirk)

    Greetings Principal Nedzu,

    Recently I have come in contact with an owl. After a few separate encounters, I have come to believe that it is possible that this owl could have some sort of intelligence enhancing quirk.

        It is a wild animal choosing to live in an urban area.
        It once stole a knife from someone trying to stab me when I was on duty.
        It seems to understand what I say, including up to an invitation to my balcony.
        It brought me the eraser heads off pencils, showing that it understands my code name.

    I have been trying to befriend and gain the trust of this owl. If you have any sort of advice for my situation, I would be thankful.

    Attached is some supplementary material.

    Regards,

    Aizawa Shouta

Glancing through the email for typos, Shouta sent it off when he saw he had none. He hadn't wanted it to come to this, but he was just so out of his depth here. It was only logical that an animal with a quirk be asked about an animal with a quirk.

Barely half an hour passed before his laptop pinged with an email notification. Fast. Nedzu hadn't slowed down at all. He clicked into it, a small spike of anxiety leaping into his throat. Even after all these years, emails from the principal could still make him feel this way. This wasn't even school-related, he reasoned to himself. Shouta started reading.

    Subject: Re: Owl Living in Musutafu (Quirk)

    Dear Aizawa-kun,

    I am pleased you have decided to contact me in regards to the owl living in the area. I have already been keeping an eye on him, but more eyes are always welcome.

    With the addition of your video, I can confirm he is a juvenile of the eurasian eagle owl species! Quite a rarity in these parts, I must say. The last official sightings in Japan were many years ago, before even the age of quirks! And only ever in Hokkaido!

    As for the matter of a quirk, I do believe there is a high possibility. Do continue to keep an eye on him, Aizawa-kun. I would, myself, but I shall have to content myself from a distance.

    Owls are notoriously wary of humans, so the fact that you have already had multiple encounters initiated by him can only be a good sign!

    When you do gain his trust, I should like you to come visit U.A. with him! Perhaps we can all share a nice cup of tea.

    A dog, a mouse, or a bear? I am the Principal!

    Nedzu

Shouta frowned as he read the reply; he hadn’t realized that Nedzu had already been keeping tabs on the owl. It wasn’t that surprising though; the principal of UA primarily dealt in information. Knowledge was power, especially in the dangerous career of a pro hero. It was what made the world go around down in the deep nastier parts of the world. There was a reason why informants were highly coveted resources.

Speaking of information, Nedzu had given him some new scraps at least. Plus if the smartest creature in the country agreed there was a quirk involved, that was good enough for him.

He had settled into the couch, opening up articles on the species of owl that Nedzu had identified as his balcony visitor. A lot of them reiterated the same information, but there were some facts that made his mind boggle. He hadn’t realized owls could get that big? And the sheer amount of force they could exert with their talons? Bone chilling.

Shouta was about to doze off when he heard an odd barking sound. He blinked in the direction of the balcony, only just the bit startled when he saw the owl perched there.

With the light already turned on in the living room, he was finally able to appreciate the tawny-buff coloring of the owl’s feathers.

“Hey there,” Shouta leaned over with a small smile on his lips, motioning over to the closed doors, “Thanks for visiting. Do you mind if I open this a bit?”

A blink was his reply, and the pro hero slowly reached his hand to the door, breathing out in relief when the owl didn’t move away or fly off.

He slid the door open as quietly as he could, leaving enough room for the owl to come in if he wanted to. Shouta dragged one of the fold-up chairs that they kept around for visitors and unfolded it, sitting right by the doors.

“Thanks for the erasers,” He blurted out, hand rubbing the back of his neck, “You’re a smart guy, aren’t you?

Shouta considered himself decent at reading body language, but all the head bobbing the owl tended to do really put his observation skills to the test.

“You know..” The hero started, a chuckle escaping his lips as the owl tilted his head at him, shuffling just a bit closer, “It’s getting weird just calling you ‘the owl’ in my head.”

The bird chirped at him, big eyes staring at the compression bandage wrapped around his ankle.

“Oh, this?” Shouta grumbled, “Got hurt last night. Had a healing quirk used on it at the hospital already. I’ll be fine.”

A peep.

“Are you judging me?”

Another tilt of the head.

“I can’t believe an owl is judging me.”

Uu-hoo

“Yeah, yeah. Laugh it up.”

Shouta could feel himself relaxing even further as he made smalltalk with the owl before he realized that he was still calling him ‘the owl’.

“Hey, do you have a name?”

As soon as the words passed his lips, he could feel the sharp gaze of the owl on him, ratcheting up the tension in the room. Was that a taboo question? Did owls have names? Did they not? Was he trodding over some owl tradition?

“If you don’t mind, I could give one to you.”

At that, the owl seemed to untense, blinking and responding with a chirp.

“Your species is known as the washi-mimizuku in this country,” Shouta begins, “You’re still growing, but it’s pretty likely your wingspan will be longer than how I am tall.”

“Can I call you Mimizuku?”

    \o/ When I found out that Izuku's species was called the washi-mimizuku, I couldn't not have Aizawa name him Mimizuku??? Plus, it's cute :P (Also Mimizuku, by itself, just means an owl with ear tufts.) But yes! Izuku is an Eurasian Eagle Owl! They're known as one of the biggest owls and have very striking orange eyes usually! Also a bigger owl's grip strength is no joke.

    This chapter was originally gonna just have the short Aizawa comic, but I ended up scribbling that other pic for this chapter as well at the last minute!

    Thank you for reading! Please let me know what you think of this chapter :D

Chapter Text

Izuku enjoyed flying immensely.

Not only was it good exercise, it gave him a sense of freedom. If he really wanted to, he could probably go anywhere he wanted in the world!

He didn’t want to leave though. Things for him had been steadily going well, and he would hate for that to change.

Izuku may not have his Mama anymore, but now he had Aizawa-san.

Did Kacchan even miss him?

He had all the food he could eat.

He didn’t even remember what katsudon tasted like anymore.

He had a home.

The memories of his old room were getting dimmer and dimmer every day.

This was his life now. Every single night he spent as an owl seemed to make it more permanent.

Normal kids (Kacchan) would be going to school and learning all the things school kids had to know. Izuku slept through most of the day, only waking to preen and clean his toes with precise nibbles. Normal kids (Kacchan) would be practicing with their quirks and maybe even start learning how to be a hero. For Izuku, his quirk was his life. Izuku thought about it long and hard. He would rather stay this way forever than to go back. This way, no one could call him names. No one could beat him up for protecting others.

If he got lonely, he could visit Aizawa-san.

He really liked spending time with Aizawa-san.

The pro hero always seemed grumpy with a neutral expression on his face, but Izuku always enjoyed their semi-one-sided conversations.

Aizawa-san had even given him a name!

Mimizuku.

Izuku had thought it strange that it sounded so similar to his actual name, but he liked it a lot. It did make responding to his new name easy to get used to.

When he would visit, Aizawa-san would always pull up a chair to the balcony and just spend time with him. Occasionally, he would read eagle owl facts to him. There were even a few times where they both just listened to the radio. However, most of their time together was spent in silence, just the two of them occupying the same space. The pro would even fall asleep sometimes if he had just gotten back from his patrol. Izuku would try to wake him up before he left. He didn't want the hero to catch a cold.

It wasn’t often that he visited two nights in a row, but Aizawa-san had said he wanted to introduce someone to him. Izuku was wary and a bit curious about who this someone was. Aizawa-san wouldn’t try to have him meet someone mean, right? The pro hero usually worked alone when he was out, the owl knew. So who could it be?

Izuku hoped they were nice.

Shouta was looking forward to tonight.

It had been over a month since Mimizuku's first visit and since then, the owl had visited every few days.

After the third time, Shouta had taken a little step stool they had and covered it with a towel for the owl to stand on. He had noticed that Mimizuku hopped off his perch and onto the landing pretty frequently during his visits. This way, at least his talons wouldn't get blunted. The first time that Shouta had left it out on the balcony for him, the owl had promptly landed on it, his feathers all loose and ruffled in relaxation. The pro wondered if the owl knew if it was for him. Nowadays, Shouta could leave the glass door open with the stool parked right by the entrance and Mimizuku would still land on it.

On this particular visit, he was planning to introduce Hizashi to Mimizuku. His husband had laughed in his face when he had told him that he gave the name Mimizuku to the owl. It was a good descriptive name; it could have been worse. Plus, Mimizuku seemed to approve of it, responding to the calls of his name with coos and clicks of his beak.

It had taken a few days, but Hizashi had finally managed to get the night off for this; he had been excited to learn that he was going to meet 'the knife owl' in person.

Shouta just hoped that Hizashi listened to him and didn't get too close. He knew from previous visits that Mimizuku liked his space, clacking his beak and moving a few steps away if he ever got within arms length. He also knew that the owl disliked loud noises. Frankly speaking, Hizashi seemed to be made of traits that Mimizuku didn't enjoy.

He really did hope they got along though.

A small thud brought him out of his thoughts, a small gust of wind ruffling his hair. He looked up to see the owl ruffling the feathers on his wings, rearranging them to lie down flat.

“Thanks for coming.”

A chirp.

Shouta smiled.

“Have you started to hunt yet tonight?”

One tap. Two taps.

“Thanks for coming tonight. The person I want you to meet is coming soon.”

A tilt of the head.

“He’s a pretty excitable person, but he doesn’t mean you any harm.”

A quieter peep.

And as if his husband had timed it, he bursted in through the door, hair still up in it’s do.

“Yeah! I’m home!”

Mimizuku immediately puffed up at the sudden yell, ear tufts perking up with his broad wings flaring out behind him. He clicked his beak and swayed, appearing almost double his actual size.

Hizashi was frozen at the sight, his eyes wide in suppressed panic and gazing over at the other pro.

“Hey, hey,” Shouta did his best to hide his terseness, keeping both his tone and body language relaxed, “Hizashi didn’t mean to be loud. I warned him that you didn’t like loud noises. He’s sorry, right?”

A crimson glare was edged at the still frozen radio host.

“Y-yeah! I’m really sorry! I was just really excited to meet you!”

A few seconds passed, Shouta deactivating Erasure before he looked back to see the owl’s reaction. Mimizuku was squinting, looking like he was judging them and then he deflated back down, feathers already laid back again.

“Yamada Hizashi,” The blond bowed in greeting right afterwards, still standing by the entrance, “I’m Shouta’s husband and the pro hero Present Mic. It’s really nice to finally meet you!”

To Shouta’s surprise, the owl bowed in reply. His mind raced with questions. Did an intelligence quirk enable understanding of human customs as well? To his knowledge, Mimizuku didn’t really spend much of his time around people, with the lone exception of himself. Where else would he have picked something up like that? Or was he just mimicking what Hizashi did?

Mimizuku bobbed his head a few times, looking not at the blond man, but at his hair. He hopped onto the nearest arm of the couch, none of the talons piercing into the furniture only to continue to peer over at Hizashi’s hair.

“You curious about this?” The blond made an elaborate gesture at his slicked up hair with a pleased look, continuing on when Mimizuku tapped a talon against the couch arm, “It’s for uniform, ya know. For when I have hero patrols and stuff.”

The owl cooed and hopped back onto his stool, wings spreaded open slightly for balance.

“Whoa, that’s gotta be a pretty wild wingspan,” Hizashi toed his way to the living room, finally, “You’ve told me a lot about him, but it’s really cool to see him, like in front of me.”

“He’s still growing too,” Shouta smirked when Mimizuku fully extended his wings as if on cue, a chirp escaping his beak, “Eagle owls like Mimizuku are one of the biggest owls in the world.”

“You’re so proud of him,” Hizashi grinned unabashedly, “It’s like you’re a happy bird dad!”

“What.”

“Does that mean I’m a dad too??”

“Hizashi.”

Izuku liked Yamada-san.

He had been scared of him at first. The man was all loose gestures, loud voice, and tall crested hair, but he was really nice actually. Yamada-san talked a lot more than Aizawa-san, and Izuku enjoyed hearing him talk about his day. From things like how the radio agency was run, to things like how he had to cross the street when he saw this huge bug on the tree by the convenience store, Izuku listened to it all.

Yamada-san would even tell him about his hero patrols and which heroes he would do team ups with. He had even shown him how he was dressed in his hero uniform. Izuku still thought the hair was a bit silly though. It always startled him for a second, before he realized it was just Yamada-san.

The first few times, Aizawa-san always made sure to also be there when Yamada-san was, but he couldn’t always stick around. Eraserhead still had a job to do after all. Izuku was glad that Aizawa-san had clarified for him to tap out replies for yes and no questions. It was a simple one tap for yes and two for no, but it helped a lot if he wanted to make his opinion known.

Izuku found himself visiting their apartment more and more. Ever since Yamada-san had made that comment about being a “happy bird dad”, the owl had been pondering over that statement more and more. Was it possible that he was thinking too deep into it? Very likely, yeah, but it made him feel all kinds of warm and fuzzy inside. Maybe it was just a joke, but Izuku did think Aizawa-san and Yamada-san would be nice parents.

Truth be told, Izuku had grown immensely fond of the both of them and he knew they both liked him back. But all they knew was that he was a smart bird. They thought he was a bird with a quirk.

He was lying to them.

But it’s not as if he could tell them the truth.

Could he tell them?

Would Aizawa-san and Yamada-san even want to help him if they really knew who he was?

Izuku hated this.

He wanted to trust them. But.. Mama had told him to hide.

How was he supposed to decide what to do?

Izuku loved his Mama.

He had been so lonely when he was hiding though.

But if he didn’t listen to his Mama’s last words, then what kind of son was he?

A few low voices brought him out of his silent pondering. Izuku closed his eyes immediately, making sure he was as invisible as he could make it on such short notice.

It only took a few minutes before the people cleared out, leaving the owl alone once again. Izuku wondered what they were talking about. It made no sense to him why people would try to sell other people things near a dumpster in an alleyway. Especially if it was bad things like drugs.

Izuku worried. He knew drugs were bad. All Might’s Say No to Drugs campaign had been played a few times on the tv at daycare and he had always paid attention to it. He had wanted to be a hero, and heroes didn’t do things to their body that would make it harder for them to be heroes.

People selling drugs in alleyways couldn’t be good.

Was this something he could let Aizawa-san know about?

Izuku flew off, intent on finding a different dumpster to hunt from tonight. He could figure out how to tell the pro hero later. It wouldn’t be right to know about this and let it happen.

Trigger.

Shouta frowned as he scanned through the recent reports cc’d to him by the detective he was currently working with for this case.

Trigger again.

It wasn’t exactly rare for these types of cases to pop up on a one to one basis, but so many? And all around the same time? It was definitely suspicious. And dangerous.

Hizashi had already almost gotten blown through a building today due to some villain with a wind quirk being hopped on Trigger. The blond was usually pretty good about staying out of harm's way with his emphasis on long distance attacks, but Trigger tended to introduce an unpredictable element to the fight.

The worst thing was that it seemed to be one of those American brands that were being distributed. Hours of quirk enhancement? It was hell to go against. Especially if the villains planned well.

Finding the distribution site would be the highest priority. If they could track it down, they could nip the rest of this in the bud. Obviously some had already been sold, but it was only logical that the dealers were still around. Previous cases noted that a few of villains that were arrested in Trigger cases were all broken out, never to be seen again. Shouta would bet anything that the dealers were involved.

He rubbed at his eyes, blinking one open when he heard the now familiar thud of Mimizuku landing onto the stool. A smile tugged at his lips; it was always nice to see the owl.

"It's nice to see you again."

Mimizuku tapped out a 'yes' before hopping onto the couch arm, peering at the screen of his laptop.

"It's work," Shouta sighed, swallowing a yawn, "And it's classified, probably."

He didn't exactly know if telling an animal with an intelligence quirk this sort of thing was illegal, but he didn't want to risk it. There was a reason why he never told law enforcement about The Knife Incident.

The internet was not helpful when he tried to find a clear answer about having to arrest owls for vigilantism. He had given Mimizuku a small lecture later on though and the owl had seemed contrite at the time if nothing else.

Mimizuku gave a peep at his reply, hopping onto the back of the couch this time with his eyes still on the laptop, talons not even breaking through the fabric.

Shouta held himself very still at the owl's closeness. This was the first time he'd been so close to the owl. Mimizuku usually would have moved himself away by now. He held up a finger close to the owl's head, groaning just a bit in his mind when it was ignored.

Mimizuku then jumped onto the coffee table, balancing effortlessly with only a small flare of his wings and tail. He tapped four times.

"Hizashi?" Shouta could feel his mood drop at the reminder, "He got hurt during his patrol. You were looking forward to seeing him today, huh?"

The owl seemed to deflate at the knowledge, tapping out a 'yes'.

"He was lucky he didn't get hurt worse. Don't worry about him, alright? He just has to stay overnight at the hospital."

Mimizuku cooed, jumping back onto the couch next to him. To Shouta's surprise, the owl then clambered onto his forearm, his weight a comfortable pressure and talons barely prickling through his sleeve.

"What are you doing?" The pro would forever deny the fondness that dripped into his voice whenever he talked to the owl.

The next words that were going to be said were forgotten as Mimizuku reached up and nuzzled his cheek. The glossy feathers were cool to the touch and soft as well, Shouta marveled.

He smiled.

Was the owl trying to comfort him?

"Thank you, Mimizuku."

    Shouta > Hey Google, can you arrest an owl for vigilantism?

    Shouta > Thanks for nothing :/

    Izuku was absolutely scared off by Hizashi's hair at first. Poor Hizashi :c It's not your fault that your hair sets off primal instincts :v

    But!! Now that they've met, there will be more Hizashi + Izuku moments!! They have such a good dynamic! I'm very excited about this :DD

    Also!! Happy bird dads!!! Heh, if Aizawa like.. just looked over at Izuku just a second earlier, Izuku would be very human right now xD But plot demands me not have the reveal here so :3c

    Also, I found out about that weird ao3 time bug thing? Where apparently if you draft/post something at this specific time window, the time stamp gets dated back a day? And the issue will follow the fic for forever (until they fix it?) even if you post outside that time window now... Guess who started the chapter one draft in that time window :') Though that explains why I saw the timestamp on this as last updated April 16th instead of the 17th (and then it changed to saying 17th during that weird time window xDD I was like ???)

    I hope you guys enjoyed the very floofy Owlzuku! Him going into defense mode was something I was always planning on including at least once!

    Thank you for reading! Please let me know what you thought! <33

    Next chapter comes out on May 1st! Hope to see you there! :D

Chapter Text

It had been a long time since Izuku had been comfortable with touch.

He could remember his Mama’s hugs and how he could sink into them. Could remember the stickiness of Kacchan’s hands when they crossed the streets together back when they were still the best of friends. Could remember the bursts of heat popping against him. Getting pushed back. Getting knocked into the ground. All because he hadn’t manifested a quirk.

The memories of his Mama only grew dimmer and dimmer as each night passed; being an owl now also didn’t exactly give him any chances to get close to others (not that he wanted to either).

Not until Aizawa-san, at least.

And even with Aizawa-san, he was careful to keep his distance. Maybe it was silly of him, but he just didn’t want to get hurt again. Kacchan wanted to become a hero and.. Kacchan had hurt him. Was it too far to assume that another hero would do the same thing?

Izuku wasn’t even sure what Aizawa-san’s quirk was. It had caused him to be wary at first, making sure that he always had an escape route ready if something happened that he didn’t like.

But night after night passed, and nothing happened.

When Izuku had started visiting Aizawa-san’s balcony, and still nothing happened, the seed of trust had been planted.

And that was where Izuku found himself now.

When he had heard Yamada-san had gotten hurt, worry had flooded him. He knew Aizawa-san felt worse than he did though; they were married to each other after all. Hisashi had been married to Mama too, but the two married couples were nothing alike.

Izuku didn’t exactly have arms to hug Aizawa-san with, but he just couldn’t bear to not try to give some measure of comfort to the man. It was what his Mama would have done for him, so it was only right to try his best for the man who had become so important to him.

From the very first touch, Izuku realized a few things.

He was warm.

He liked this.

And he had missed this so much.

Izuku let out a trill, eyes slipping close as he nuzzled Aizawa-san’s face again. The man let out a chuckle, leaning his head down just a bit closer, giving more access to the owl, who now didn’t have to extend upwards to get to his target.

Eyes still closed, he jolted upwards when he felt a light stroke down his back. As the strokes lengthened, going from the top of his head to the tip of his tail, he could feel himself relaxing into it.

This was nice. Really nice.

“Thank you for trusting me,” Aizawa-san murmured lowly, “I know how hard it can be to trust someone.”

Izuku carefully tapped out ‘yes’, very aware that he was still standing on the pro hero’s forearm. He didn’t want to accidentally harm Aizawa-san; Izuku knew full well how sharp his talons were.

“Huh,” The man huffed, “A reply like that makes me wonder what kind of life you led before all of this.”

Izuku peeped as he gingerly jumped back down onto the couch. To be honest, the owl didn’t really think he was all that interesting before everything had happened. It wasn’t as if he was telling Aizawa-san about his life though. That was something Izuku hoped that Aizawa-san would never find out.

This was enough. What they had between the two of them was enough for Izuku.

He didn’t know what he’d do if Aizawa-san ever found out about the real him.

“Alright, keep your secrets,” The pro hero had a look of amusement on his face, “I’ve got to finish going through these reports though, so you keep yourself amused, alright?”

Izuku fluffed up instead of replying, content to stay near the man. This was how they spent most of their time together anyways, in peace and silence.

And in the meantime, Izuku could try to figure out how to let Aizawa-san know about the drug selling. While Izuku loved his quirk, he couldn’t help but to think that being a talking owl would have been so much more helpful in this specific situation. Or maybe even a telepathic owl; that would have been cool as well. Anything that let him communicate easily would have been wonderful.

"Villains on Trigger are a pain in the ass to take down."

Aizawa-san mumbled, interrupting Izuku’s thoughts. Trigger? Izuku remembered hearing that word. Was that the name of the drug that the guy was trying to sell? He was sure of it. The owl clicked his beak, reaching up to tug at the man’s sleeve until he got his attention.

"Is something wrong?"

'Yes.'

"Is this about Hizashi again?"

'No.'

"Is this about what I just said?"

'Yes.'

".. Villains on Trigger?"

'Yes.'

Aizawa-san gave him a funny look, a small crease appearing between his brows.

"Why do you know anything about Trigger?"

Izuku chirped at him before jumping over to the coffee table where Aizawa-san’s laptop was. He could see the pro’s aborted movement towards him, but the owl ignored that, continuing to look at the keyboard.

He didn’t really know how to type what he saw, he had only just gotten to writing down the types of weather and the seasons back in daycare, but he did remember the time and date that the seller had given the buyers.

Izuku reached out with a talon and carefully poked at one of the number keys, before looking over at the pro. He tapped it once again.

He really hoped that Aizawa-san understood what he was trying to say.

Today was a day of many firsts.

Not only had Mimizuku gotten close enough to initiate contact, but he had even allowed Shouta to do it as well. His heart had felt like it could explode. But not only that, the owl seemed to want to use his laptop. And apparently knew about Trigger?

He leaned forward, opening the notepad application and gestured to the waiting owl, who chirped at him before slowly typing out a series of numbers. Mimizuku stretched out a foot after looking at the screen, clicking down on the backspace, and continued typing.

Shouta was bewildered. Sure Nedzu could use a computer, but he didn't expect Mimizuku to have that capacity as well. Nedzu's High Specs was a rarity in itself. Just how smart was this owl?

The typing continued for about a minute before the owl stopped and peeped at him. The pro blinked while looking at what was typed.

“Looks like a date and time,” He murmured, “What does that have to do with Trigger?”

Mimizuku only tapped out ‘yes’ as a reply, tapping it out again when Shouta didn’t reply.

“Don’t tell me owls can get hopped on Trigger,” Shouta grunted, “What the fuck.”

The owl hopped towards him, flaring his wings slightly and clacked his beak.

“Okay, okay,” Shouta was sufficiently cowed by the display, offering his finger to the owl, “Sorry for insinuating that you took drugs.”

Mimizuku, to his surprise, did not nip him and only just nudged his finger with the side of his head, then nibbled it, leaving no mark behind.

“Glad you know drugs are bad, at least.”

A tapped ‘yes’ was his reply.

“This is a date and time then?”

‘Yes.’

“And it has to do with Trigger? You’re sure?”

‘Yes.’

“Alright then,” Shouta sighs, “This is as likely a lead as anything else we’re going to get.”

Mimizuku ruffled his feathers, another peep escaping his beak.

“You know where you heard this, right?”

‘Yes.’

“Can you take me there now?”

“Yes.’

“Will you be hanging around for this?”

‘No.’

Shouta raised an eyebrow, but he supposed that made sense. Mimizuku had given him a time and a date. The pro didn’t even know if owls had a sense of time comparable to a human’s. He even doubted that the bird even knew the current date, or god forbid, the time. Shouta was relatively sure that no owls owned calendars, clocks, or smartphones. Time was wholly a human construct after all.

“Stop by in two nights and I’ll let you know how it works out.”

Mimizuku bobbed his head while also tapping a ‘yes’ out.

“Cheeky brat,” Shouta snorts, fondness lacing his voice, “Come on, you have to show me where this happened.”

“Meet me by the tree?”

‘Yes.’

Shouta had contacted Detective Tsukauchi with the new lead as soon as he was alone, Mimizuku already a speckle in the sky. The man had been curious about where the new lead had come from, and that gave Shouta a pause.

He couldn’t exactly tell him that it was an owl with an intelligence quirk who may have overheard a Trigger deal going down. He was still actively working on gaining Mimizuku’s trust and something in him gnawed ferociously at telling Tsukauchi the whole truth.

“A new informant,” Shouta hummed. It was close enough and wasn’t exactly wrong; a just in case he ever had to say this where the good detective was able to use his quirk.

“Ah, well I know how you underground types are about your informants,” Tsukauchi replied easily, “I’ll have someone on standby if you need backup tomorrow night.”

Shouta thanked him before hanging up; always paid to be on the good side of law enforcement after all. He carefully scoped out the alleyway, carefully mapping out the location in his head. The pro had to give it to Mimizuku. This alleyway really was out of the way for others; you’d have to know about it beforehand to get to it without some measure of confusion. He left the area with nothing moved, intent on starting on his own patrol.

And before he knew it, the next day had arrived.

Shouta had escorted Hizashi back from the hospital in the late afternoon, relief loosening up his chest when he saw the blond give him a cheesy grin and finger guns in the waiting room. As they walked back to their apartment, the dark haired man took the chance to tell the radio host about the previous night.

“... and then he let me stroke his back.”

“What! No way!”

“Heh,” A smirk played on his lips, “Yes way.”

“It’s not fair how our bird son loves you more than me!”

Shouta had to hide his widening smirk into his capture weapon.

“Guess you’ll just have to be the second-best dad, huh.”

“Shou!!” Hizashi’s grin was blinding and his tone teasing, “You’re admitting you’re a dad! I’m so proud of you!”

“Oh shut it, you cockatoo.”

And just like that, the blond squawked, like the nickname suggested he would. Hizashi really could be predictable at times.

By the time they got back, the sky was starting to purple. As Hizashi relaxed onto the couch, he peered up at Shouta who was reheating up some of the leftover miso soup he had made last night.

“There was something you left out earlier, yeah?”

“Mm,” Shouta muttered as he reached into the fridge for a slice of cheese, a loaf of bread already in one hand, “Mimizuku might have given me the date and time of a drug bust.”

“What the fuck?”

“Yeah,” While the skillet was starting to heat up, the dark eyed man started to cut into the loaf, producing impeccable slices of bread ready for grilling. Learning how to properly handle a knife was probably one of the things from his job that he got the most use of in everyday life. “He used my laptop to type it out.”

“... Huh. We knew he was smart, but I didn’t realize that… computers?” Hizashi tapped a finger against his chin, “Is the information valid? How did he even get it?"

“It’s tonight, so I guess we’ll find out soon. And I’m guessing he overheard it while he was out doing whatever he does at night.”

“Shou.. This is like.. Mimizuku is really smart…” The blond mussed his hair, fingers tangling into it, voice getting more and more incredulous as he continued, “He understood your hero name. He recognized the name of a drug when hearing it again and could give you the date and name he heard probably at least an hour before coming over here. And he knows how to type?”

Shouta half-heartedly shrugged.

“Are we sure it’s just an intelligence quirk?” Hizashi looked completely serious as he spoke, “And not like, some owl transformation quirk?”

“Hizashi.. I’ve seen Mimizuku hunt rats before. We’ve both seen what happened to your balcony pigeon. Plus, he’s been in this area for over half a year now. And remember, Nedzu said he’s a juvenile. I doubt any good human parent would let their kid run wild like that at night eating rats from a dumpster.”

“You haven’t ever caught him in your Erasure yet though.”

“Nedzu’s High Spec is a mutation quirk,” Shouta grumbled, “He made me attend his private lessons that one time I used my quirk on him. I’m not risking the trust Mimizuku has in me just to check if I can erase his quirk.”

“You’ve got a point there,” Hizashi admitted, “Well, we can deal with whatever his quirk is later. Nedzu’s sure to be a help when we can take him to UA.”

"Mimizuku's going to stop by tomorrow night if you can make it," The dark haired pro slid over a freshly made grilled cheese sandwich along with a bowl of soup over to his husband, "He was worried about you when I told him you got hurt."

"The cutie," Hizashi cooed as he took a big bite of the sandwich, yelping as the hot cheese dripped onto his finger, "Such a good bird son!"

Shouta snorted at that, ending the conversation in favor of having a light snack before leaving to stake out the alleyway. It wouldn't do to have his position betrayed because of a hungry stomach.

The dark haired man left soon afterwards, now donning the identity of the underground hero Eraserhead.

It was now, in the slowly darkening city, that he felt most at home. He hoped Mimizuku's tip would end up being fruitful. While Trigger on the streets was never good, having long strings of cases was even worse. People get hurt. People end up going missing. And the suppliers get to skip town with no one the wiser. That wasn’t even mentioning how it’s lingering presence on the streets gave it a chance to get trafficked into another prefecture. All in all, it culminated into many injured pros and so much fucking paperwork.

The alleyway was dark and empty when he finally reached it. He leaped, using his capture weapon to loop onto the railing of a balcony, making his way onto one of the lower roofs. The advantages of being close by far outweighed the dangers it could pose. Short-length ambush tactics were what he specialized in after all; it was only logical for him to be at a short distance as well.

Shouta waited.

Patience was a virtue, particularly in the world of Underground Heroics.

Soon, the sun fell completely, washing the city in darkness. It was a quiet neighborhood that Shouta was currently in. Not the cleanest, but he had seen and smelled worse. He tamped down the background lighting on his phone before checking the time.

Ding

Shouta narrowed his eyes at the sudden peal of a bicycle bell. Dropping his phone into his back pocket, he leaned forward just enough to see a man in a cap with a trash bag. A civilian? The pro kept quiet as the man pried open the dumpster lid, dropping his trash in.

More movement. Shouta could feel his muscles tense in anticipation when another capped man arrived at the dumpster. This one had a briefcase tucked under one arm as well as a small bag of trash in the other. He swung his trash into the dumpster, a sneer on his face.

“Just in time.”

“Quickly please.”

“Yeah. Here it is. Don’t lose it. Or else.”

Shouta could recognize Trigger like the back of his own hand. With that, he quickly slid his goggles on and jumped down.

A split second passed as the wide eyes of the briefcase man met his own before he activated Erasure, quickly ending whatever quirk may have been used. The first man yelped at his sudden appearance, his fists turning a violent glowing red. Shouta quickly glared at him as well before snapping a leg out to catch an ankle and sweeping it to the side. As the man crashed into the wall, briefcase sliding from his grasp onto the concrete, Shouta immediately kicked it further away so that it was out of reach.

Ducking down, the pro neatly dodged the upcoming punch to his head, blinking and reactivating Erasure on the man left standing. The man cursed, staring at his hands, before slipping out a thin knife from his pants. Shouta merely shot his capture weapon over, the tendrils looping around the wrists and pulled tightly. One roundhouse kick to the face sent the remaining man sprawling, knife slipping and spinning away.

Shouta hummed, quickly tying up the first man who was still groaning from the hard hit to the head. The other had hit the wall hard enough to knock himself out, which worked out well for him.

He propped open the briefcase, peeking in to make sure that the vials weren’t compromised. It would have sucked if they had broken in the small scuffle; not to mention that Tsukauchi would have made him eat his own paperwork if he had ruined important evidence. He’s eaten paper before and he really would like to avoid having to do it again in the near future.

It seemed that Mimizuku’s tip did end up panning out.

He would have an interesting story to tell the owl tomorrow. For now, he had to get these drug traffickers processed before continuing his patrol.

The night was still young and Shouta knew that this was just the start of a long night.

Chapter Text

Curiosity really was hard to resist, Izuku knew.

It was even harder to resist once he had started living his life as an owl. With the ability to just fly anywhere he wanted, he had so many new opportunities open to him. Even so, Izuku very rarely left his own territory. Perhaps it was just an owl instinct given to him by his quirk, but he hated feeling like he would be leaving his territory unprotected if he left.

After he had passed on the time and date he overheard, it took everything he had to not return to that dumpster the following night. Sure he didn’t know what the current date was, but Aizawa-san had asked him to come visit in two nights, which would mean that that night in between was the date drugs might have been being sold! And that date was in March!

(Izuku had tried to keep track of the passing months at first, but grabbing trashed newspapers only served to make him feel inadequate. There was almost nothing he could read in it.)

Izuku didn’t really know what to think about the knowledge of the current month except that it was a lot of months from his birthday in July. Just how long had he been like this? Just how long has Mama been gone?

He shook his head, feathers getting ruffled in the process. It didn’t matter now. He had something to look forward to later and Yamada-san should be back from the hospital as well!

Izuku was practically bouncing by the time night fell, making his way to Aizawa-san’s balcony. He hoped that the information he passed on had helped. He really didn’t want to be wasting a hero’s time. Especially if it was Eraserhead's time.

Eraserhead now solidly placed number one in his list of best and coolest heroes. All Might was still really high up there, right next to Present Mic! Izuku wasn't able to watch any of Present Mic's patrols but Yamada-san always told him about them. About the heroes he worked with, the people he saved, and the quirks that he saw in action. He was really good at telling stories; he even did sound effects for them!

It kind of reminded him of how his Mama used to read bedtime stories to him. Except the stories she told came out of books and were about saying goodnight to the moon. Izuku said hello to the moon now, if he could see it.

He landed onto his stool, talons sinking into the towel. Izuku was glad that Aizawa-san had thought of a way for him to not put holes into the furniture. It's not as if he had any money to buy a new stool. Plus, he didn't think a store would allow an owl to buy furniture anyways.

Aizawa-san was already sitting on the couch as if he was waiting for him. There was a small black strap with buttons that he was fiddling with, but Izuku ignored it in favor of chirping a greeting.

"Mimizuku," The man gave him a tired smile, "Good to see you."

Izuku thought it was pretty good to see him as well, though he did think the pro looked even more exhausted than last he saw him. Did something happen?

He tilted his head, doing his best to convey his worry, but he was pretty sure it didn't work because Aizawa-san only looked like he wanted to take a nap even more.

Then Izuku heard footsteps and a familiar voice coming from the hallway. He perked up at the sight of the long hair and peeped when he saw the funny little mustache that Yamada-san had.

"Mimizuku!" Izuku puffed out his chest hearing his name, "Hey there, big bird! Heard you were worried about yours truly?"

Izuku tapped out ‘yes’ before stretching his body upwards to properly see the man. Yamada-san was really tall, especially compared to him. He was actually pretty sure that Yamada-san was even taller than Aizawa-san! It was hard to see how tall Aizawa-san was though since he slouched so often and he spent most of his visits sitting down instead of standing. Izuku couldn’t complain; a sitting Aizawa-san was much easier to relax with than a standing Aizawa-san.

“I’m pretty much all better now!” Yamada-san bent down slightly, fingers tapping the bandage around his head, “Thanks for worrying, buddy!”

The owl hopped off the stool, gliding past the dark-haired pro to land on the back of the couch right by the blond. Izuku had been really worried, alright? He wanted to be completely sure that Yamada-san was really alright! Chirping at the blond man (who chirped back at him! Aizawa-san was right in saying that Yamada-san was like a bird), he leaned in, flicking strands of long hair away with his beak.

“Aww, Shou! I think he’s fussing over me!”

Izuku ignored the two of them, the words merely background noise to him. He had a mission here! He wanted to make sure Yamada-san was all better! Heroes had to take care of their health, after all! Plus, Mama had always allowed him to put on bandages on her fingers if she had accidentally cut herself with the kitchen knife. Izuku knew how to keep wounds clean and to stop them from getting worse.

He nudged the bandages, making sure that they weren’t wet. Careful not to touch them with his beak (it was very sharp!), he nuzzled his cheek against them instead.

“Is this a bird kiss?” Yamada-san loudly whispered, which Izuku was very thankful for. He knew that Yamada-san’s quirk could make him very loud and didn’t want to be anywhere near if that happened, “I got a bird kiss from our bird son!”

Izuku was satisfied after a thorough look at the bandages, shuffling towards Aizawa-san, who was watching them both.

He chirped, tilting his head at the dark haired man. The man looked even worse close up, and that was saying something considering Izuku knew his eyesight to be pretty great. Cooing in worry, he hopped closer and nudged his head against Aizawa-san’s chin. Trying to comfort people with no hands was surprisingly hard, Izuku decided. At least now Aizawa-san seemed to have a small smile on his face.

If Aizawa-san could smile again, Izuku would consider this a job well done.

It only lasted for a few seconds before Yamada-san came to sit on the couch as well, giving the other man a poke.

"Don'tcha have something you wanted to tell our son?"

"Oh, right," Aizawa-san blinked, covering a yawn with his hand, "Mimizuku, that information you gave me, it was good. We actually arrested a supplier and a dealer, both involved with Trigger."

Izuku chirped with happiness, glad that he was able to help.

"About that," The man continued, "I told Tsukauchi, the detective I'm working with on this, that you were an informant and he asked me if you had any other information to pass on this."

Izuku thought to himself for a minute before tapping a 'no'. He was sure that if he did hear anything else about this, he would have remembered. But now that he knew that this information was helpful, he would make sure to pay more attention to conversations by dumpsters when he was out at night. If he could help out in such a way, he wanted to at least try. It would be saving people like Yamada-san from getting hurt when villains used the drugs.

"I'm telling you right now, I don't like it," Aizawa-san frowned, eyebrows scrunched together, "But the information you gave me really did help us a lot. If you do hear anything else like this, please let me know."

Izuku quickly tapped 'yes', knowing that even if Aizawa-san didn't ask him, he would have done it anyways.

"You're eager, aren't you?"

Izuku decided to not reply to that question, turning his head to the side instead. Yamada-san giggled as he watched them.

"Mimizuku is too cute, Shou! He's acting like a petulant kid!"

"Hizashi…" Aizawa-san grumbled, elbowing the blond man before picking up black strap on the table, "Anyways. I got something for you."

Izuku wondered what it was, jumping down to the couch seat to examine it more closely.

"It's an audio recorder and a tracker," He tapped the two buttons visible, "Press this button to start recording and press it again to stop. The tracker works the same way, just with the other button."

Izuku was a bit confused; he could see why something like a recorder would be helpful. It could be used to record conversions he overheard, and since he couldn't exactly speak, this would make it so he didn't have to use the laptop to type. But the tracker? He really wasn't sure.

"The recorder is for us, so it's easier to relay information and we'll get it word for word," Aizawa-san paused, the tired smile returning, "The tracker is for me, so if you ever get hurt or if you need me, I can find you. This is a dangerous job, Mimizuku. I don't want you getting hurt."

Izuku could feel his heart swell. Aizawa-san really was nice.

"Can I put this on you?"

'Yes.’

"Can you get onto the table and give me your foot?"

Izuku hopped onto the coffee table instead of replying, easily balancing on one leg and offering the other to the pro.

Aizawa-san was careful when strapping it to him, going slow and making sure it was comfortable for him and wouldn't get in the way of his hunting.

"There we go,” He leaned back afterwards, “Feel alright?”

‘Yes.’

“How about you give it a test run? To make sure you can reach the buttons.”

Izuku tapped a button with one of his talons carefully. It would be bad to break Aizawa-san’s gear. Jumping a bit when he heard it make a small whirring noise, he looked over at the pros before tapping it again, the noise dying down almost immediately.

Aizawa-san pulled out his laptop, checking something quickly.

“Looks like it works fine,” Izuku blinked at him, looking down at his leg. Didn’t he need to give the recorder back for Aizawa-san to find out what was recorded? “This specific recorder uses bluetooth to transmit the information to my laptop once you’re in range. If you don’t record anything, nothing gets transmitted.”

It was pretty cool, Izuku decided. It was like his own hero gear!

"Mimizuku, just promise me you'll be careful when you do this," Aizawa-san continued, looking very serious as he spoke; it was rare that he wasn't serious, but after so long, Izuku felt he could understand when the man was his usual-serious compared to being Eraserhead-serious.

'Yes.'

Izuku chirped as well, making his way to a couch cushion to nudge at one of Aizawa-san’s hands which then stroked the top of his head. He wasn't sure why he did it; perhaps it was a reassurance to the man that he would be careful, a promise he knew he would try to keep. For himself. For his Mama. And now for Aizawa-san.

Shouta could feel Hizashi's gleeful eyes on them, could see those fingers reaching for his phone. He rolled his eyes, but didn't stop him.

Hizashi had always been fond of taking photos, insisting it was one of the best ways to record memories. He actually had a stash of photo albums packed in their spare room that he occasionally took out to look through. Shouta already knew that this photo was going to end up there, along with that photo of Mimizuku with the knife.

"You two are so adorable!" Grinning as he snapped a photo, the blond shot his bright eyes over to his own, "Shou, do you think he'll let me try?"

"Shouldn't you just ask him?" He returned with a raised eyebrow, "Mimizuku is perfectly capable of deciding that on his own."

"Yeah, but he likes you more!" Hizashi whined, gaze changing targets, "How 'bout it, buddy? Can I pet you too?"

Mimizuku blinked his eyes back open, their vivid green color visible once again. The one obvious oddity about this owl at first glance. It had been months since he had met this strange owl, he realized. Months that he spent building up a relationship with Mimizuku. Months that Hizashi insisted that he spent slowly metamorphosing into a dad.

Shouta found that he didn't really mind it. He had followed the jokes for Hizashi's sake, but he didn't think what he did was equivalent to what a father would be doing. It was just now that he was finally starting to understand what the blond had meant. But only a bit. It wasn’t as if he was responsible for Mimizuku, not in the way that mattered. Mimizuku was his own individual that just had a fondness for their small family. Shouta was mature enough to admit that the same fondness was replicated. However, it was more complicated than before now.

When Tsukauchi had contacted him after interrogating the men he had brought in with Mimizuku’s information, he had told him that not only was one a dealer, one was a supplier.

A big fish.

That information that Mimizuku had overheard and passed on to him could potentially topple a pillar of drug trafficking in their and other surrounding areas. This was leading up to be a bigger case than he and Tsukauchi had anticipated. The detective had ended up asking again about who he had gotten the lead from and though Shouta had rebuffed every effort for more information, the man had asked if his informant had any other information on this case. His gut had sunk when Tsukauchi had given him actual good reasoning behind his asking. Information like this, the police would pay good money for. This case was only getting bigger from here. Drugs were already a major issue, with Trigger cases only getting more common in the last few weeks.

And Mimizuku had stumbled into this mess. An owl. A kid owl. (Nedzu’s comment had unfazed him when he had first read it, but now with this situation? It was coming back to bite his ass.)

Did it matter how smart the owl was when he still had those soft downy feathers on his head and trailing down his back? He was the equivalent of a young teenager! He didn’t like this at all.

Shouta knew he was compromised when it came down to making a decision for Mimizuku’s future involvement in this case. He had ended up requisitioning a recorder for the owl, the tracker added to it for his own peace of mind.

Shouta wished he could say he was surprised when Mimizuku agreed to trying to find more information. He kind of wished that the owl didn’t. Owls shouldn’t be doing the jobs of police informants. They should be out there, doing what owls did with their time!

Mimizuku was only an owl. He was almost frail compared to a human and definitely smaller. He had the advantage of flight, true, but one well aimed gunshot could easily snipe him from the sky.

Shouta would never be able to forgive himself if Mimizuku got hurt trying to find information for the police, for him. Just imagining the owl’s bright eyes dulling, his body broken and bleeding on the ground, the pro could feel his heart rate speeding up.

A small nudge brought him out of his thoughts.

Mimizuku stared up at him, eyes big and watching him. The owl nudged his entire head under one of his hands, pushing up against it this time. Were owls also sensitive to emotions like cats were?

Shouta could feel his heart rate slowing back down. Mimizuku was here. He was fine.

He lightly scritched at the back of the owl’s neck, the feathers soft and warm to the touch.

“Be careful out there, Mimizuku,” He whispered, trying to forget the vivid images of a dying bird that his brain had given him, “Your life is more important than any information you bring us.”

The world wasn’t a nice place.

Shouta knew that better than most.

He hoped that Mimizuku wouldn’t find that out the hard way.

Notes:

    [x] - blood/death warning - Shouta’s imagination is not treating him kindly :c

    Hizashi > Awww, he’s acting like a kid! :D
    Izuku >
    Izuku > òvó;; Hehe I’m in danger.

    Originally, I was gonna put that above pic in with the chapter, but I thought people wouldn’t like the bloody surprise at the end xD Also it would be weird to warn for it at the beginning notes cause that’s spoilers. I debated on just linking it in the fic but tacking a warning in the chapter itself breaks immersion? So I ended up compromising with it being linked and warned in the endnotes, since I didn’t want to trash this art.

    Hizashi gets to bond with their bird son! Dadmic is so good, I love it so much. Hizashi is gonna be more present in the fic starting from now :D I plan on there being the Hizashi & Izuku tag for this fic eventually/soon!

    We get to learn more about Shouta’s thoughts on Mimizuku’s new job and Izuku’s own thoughts on it. In the most basic ways I can show them, Izuku is essentially :D and Shouta is like >:|

    Thanks so much for reading! Let me hear your thoughts on this! :D

    Next chapter comes out May 15th! What is this? An email from Nedzu?!

Chapter 8: ARC I: Chapter 8: Care
Notes:

    Chapter Warnings: N/A

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

Izuku usually ignored what the people around him talked about.

When he had been Quirkless, he ignored a lot of what Kacchan said.

Ignored most of what Hisashi had said.

Ignored all of what his classmates would say.

But he still heard it all. He had listened to it. He just never listened to them. He had gotten very good at ignoring people.

It helped him a lot when he started living as an owl, though he spent most of his time just avoiding people in general. Owl hearing really helped with that. People tended to walk and talk loudly. However, if it was quiet enough, Izuku could even hear their hearts beating. It made it easy to avoid places where people tended to gather.

But, it was different now.

Izuku could not ignore words or people anymore, not if he wanted to find more information for Aizawa-san.

It wasn't as if he purposely went looking for people to listen to. Izuku knew that would be dangerous and not something he should do if he wanted to stay hidden. It would be best if no one saw him at all.

After all, Aizawa-san had told him to be careful. Izuku planned on keeping his promise.

The owl found that he heard a lot, even on an average night. It really wasn't useful information for the police though and usually had nothing to do with drugs or Trigger.

For Izuku though, it wasn't bad. True the information had no use to him as well, but it gave him a sense of normalcy to know things like the blueberry muffins from the bakery on the corner were really delicious, or that there was a sale on winter coats at the shopping mall. They were the sorts of things he would hear from conversations in the streets back when he was human.

It made him miss being human.

Izuku knew that human Izuku wouldn't be able to do this though. Human Izuku had nothing left in the world except for his yellow backpack and faded memories. Owl Izuku on the other hand, could hunt for his own food, had a home, and could fly.

Owl Izuku had Aizawa-san and Yamada-san.

He couldn’t let them down.

If only that was as easy as it sounded though.

Days had passed and he’d heard nothing even drug-related in the streets. Sure he knew that Minamoto-san down the street from the bowling alley was getting married in the summer, and that Takahashi-san was expecting her first grandchild soon, but it really didn’t help him at all. Not to say that he wasn’t happy for them; he thought it was nice that their families were growing bigger.

He wasn’t jealous.

He had Aizawa-san and Yamada-san now. Even though they didn’t really know about him, the time that he spent with them was easily growing to be his most cherished parts of the night. It was getting harder and harder to push away the guilt gnawing away at his insides every time he visited them.

Izuku had thought about it and he supposed this was why he wanted to help Aizawa-san so badly. It was something to make him feel less guilty about lying to their faces, just pretending to be a smart bird.

Sometimes, he suspected that they knew he wasn’t just a plain old owl. They always treated him like he was his own person and not like a pet, always asking before even attempting any sort of contact with him. They even apologized to him if they did something he didn’t like! It was nice, if not a bit disconcerting at times. They were still good and polite to him regardless. Izuku wanted any chance to help them out. Just being around them, even just sitting next to them in silence drove his loneliness away.

He couldn’t help his Mama anymore; she was long gone now. The days of being Mama’s little helper were impossible to get back.

But this was a way he could help Aizawa-san. The Aizawa-san who thanked him, who invited him into his home, who treated him so kindly. The same Aizawa-san who worried about his safety despite knowing nothing else about him except that he was an owl.

Izuku wished that Mama had gone to Eraserhead to ask for help that day.

Maybe she would have found him with his help.

Maybe she would still be here with him.

It wasn’t the first time Izuku had thought about telling Aizawa-san the truth and he knew it was likely to not be the last. He just felt so guilty all the time.

Guilty for not telling Aizawa-san the truth.

Guilty for not hiding like his Mama had said.

Guilty for pretending to be someone he wasn’t.

Izuku hated feeling this way. This was way worse than how Kacchan used to make him feel.

He couldn’t bring himself to regret anything he did though. It was selfish of him. All he did was take, take, and take.

Take up the precious freetime that pro heroes probably didn't have much of.

Take up their attention that they could be spending on other, better things.

Take advantage of Aizawa-san’s and Yamada-san's kindness.

And if Izuku had the chance to do this again, he’d make the same choices.

Did that make him a bad person?

He just missed being around people who liked him. People who would listen to him. People who would call his name.

Being with them made him feel loved. Made him feel cared for.

The problem was that he didn't want to put them in danger.

Mama never told him what the danger they were in was, but Izuku knew he was a smart boy. He already had all the clues. Someone burning to death meant a fire quirk and Hisashi had a fire quirk.

It meant that Hisashi was a bad person, a villain.

In all honesty, the owl didn't know what to feel about that. Izuku had never liked Hisashi and Hisashi had never really liked him in return. When the doctor had said that he was Quirkless, Hisashi had made it clear that he never expected much from Izuku and that it was no surprise that even a quirk was too much to expect from him.

Mama had gotten really angry with Hisashi that night, still crying after she had apologized to him about his dreams of being a hero.

Mama had loved Hisashi though. But she was still dead. Burned alive.

Hisashi was still out there somewhere and he was dangerous.

Telling Aizawa-san the truth would put him in that same danger. Yamada-san too.

Izuku just didn't know what to do except to continue what he had already been doing.

Continue lying, continue hiding, and hope that maybe one day, Aizawa-san and Yamada-san would be able to forgive him.

He ignored the sinking feeling that told him that expecting forgiveness after lying for so long?

It wasn't reasonable.

Illogical.

Shouta was busier than he had ever been in a while.

Between his nightly patrols, the Trigger case reports, and contacting his actual human informants, he's barely been able to grab a few hours of rest every so often. He was exhausted.

There was just so much to do and not enough hours in the day for those things to get adequately done. And they had to be adequately, if not, well done. He was not willing to compromise on the quality of his work. Heroics was a career which dealt in lives, something every pro hero was aware of. What was lost sleep compared to a life saved?

Knowing that didn’t stop the yawn stretching his jaw though. He got up and made his way to the kitchen, snagging his empty cup as he went. More coffee wasn’t what he wanted right now, but it was what he needed if he wanted to finish going through the rest of those reports and then reply to Nedzu’s email.

He had been surprised that Nedzu had emailed him, though the surprise lessened when he had read it and saw that it was an invitation for him and Mimizuku to visit U.A. The timing was suspicious, Shouta knew, but that sort of thing was what Nedzu did best. He had known that Nedzu held an interest in Mimizuku, but to know that the trust between him and the owl right now was at an all-time high? He groaned. Fucking rat.

As he refilled his cup and returned back to the couch, he wondered if Mimizuku would be amenable to visiting the school. It was not the first time he thought about the extent of the owl’s intelligence. Did the owl know what a school was? Would the owl understand what a school was? Did animals have any sort of understanding about quirks? Nedzu was an outcast on those fronts, with High Spec being such a powerful quirk.

Animals with quirks were still decently rare. Did Mimizuku even know that he was different from most owls?

So many questions and next to no answers. It's not as if the owl could speak the human language, but then he'd just be looking at another Nedzu. The world didn't need another Nedzu.

Shouta huffed as he scanned through another report only looking up when he noticed movement from the corner of his eyes.

He could feel a smile twitch unbiddenly onto his lips as he stood to open the glass door for the owl.

Mimizuku flew in, landing onto his stool and chirping.

Ever since he had given Mimizuku the recorder, the bird had been out and about more than ever, his visits now shorter and rarer.

Shouta had mixed feelings about that. He enjoyed Mimizuku's company when he could have it, the owl now comfortable enough with him to try to preen his hair. The other night, he had even seen Hizashi tickling under the owl's chin with his fingers still intact. Things just felt more right with Mimizuku around. The owl was a part of their little family.

He worried though. It wasn't often, but Mimizuku had ended up using the tracker function multiple times. Every single one of those times had taken place during his patrol and was relatively nearby to his location. Of course he had gone to check it out. The first time it happened, he had rushed off, images of a hurt owl bleeding into his imagination.

When Shouta had arrived, it was to a muzzled kid sitting by the alleyway, tears falling silently down his cheeks. Mimizuku was perched on the railing of a balcony, only chirping when he caught sight of him.

That had been the start of Mimizuku using his tracker to report on lone children in the dark streets. It quickly escalated to being used to report petty crime and even a few villains that had been looting stores. Thankfully, it seemed that the owl remembered his previous lecture on interfering in crimes and usually stayed out of range of most weaponry and quirks, choosing to perch nearby instead. It didn’t stop him from snatching away any knives that were taken out though. That just meant that Shouta had a pretty sizable and growing collection of knives now.

The knowledge that Mimizuku was out and about more than ever because of his own request for information wasn’t something that sat well with him. The owl was still young and likely impressionable despite his obvious intelligence. For him to be taking advantage of that… He didn’t like it.

Owls were predators of the night sky, silent and quick with both superb sight and hearing. They were essentially naturals at picking up information. With the addition of an intelligence quirk in the mix, Mimizuku was almost unfairly stacked in terms of beneficial abilities aiding his informant side-job.

Logic dictated that Mimizuku’s help was the optimal choice.

He could only hope that the owl kept safe as he did this.

Before he could continue down his rabbit hole of thoughts, he could feel his pants leg being pulled at.

Shouta blinked down at Mimizuku who only blinked back at him after letting go of the piece of fabric in his beak.

“You’re going to grow up to be a little shit,” The man chuckled, a wry smile crossing his lips, “I just know it.”

The owl only peeped in reply before tapping the side of the recorder with a talon.

“You’ve got something for me?”

‘Yes.’

Shouta was intrigued, immediately leaning forward to download what was recorded. What could it be? Could Mimizuku have actually managed to get another lead on the Trigger case? Or was it something that the bird might have witnessed and wanted to share? The pro had no idea; anything was possible.

When the recording was done downloading, Shouta clicked on it, playing the sound file.

Nothing.

He clicked on it again. This time, straining his ears, he could hear a couple of low murmurs. Shouta had really underestimated how keen an owl's hearing was if Mimizuku could make any sense out of that. He’d have to really amp up the volume if he wanted to actually hear what was being said.

“I’ll have to listen to it later,” Mimizuku cocked his head at the laptop and looked up at him, “It’s a bit too low for human ears, so I’d have to turn up the volume to listen to it now.”

The owl only squinted at the laptop again and Shouta chuckled before switching back to his email.

“You’ve got an invitation, by the way.” The pro closed out of the report he had been reading earlier and opened up Nedzu’s email to him, “I’ll read it to you.”

    To: aizawa.s@hmail.co.jp
    From: nedzu@ua.ed.jp
    Subject: Invitation to U.A.

    Dear Aizawa-kun and Mimizuku-kun,

    Would you like to have a spot of tea with me sometime during this weekend? I can assure you that this will be completely safe with no threats.

    Also, I have been upgrading U.A.’s defences recently. You will both have to use the main gate to gain entrance.

    I look forward to your response.

    A dog, a mouse, or a bear? I am the Principal!

    Nedzu

Mimizuku looked fascinated at the email, ear tufts fluffed up and sidling even closer to look at the screen.

“U.A. was the high school I graduated from,” The owl looked up at him as he started speaking, “Nedzu was my old Hero Ethics teacher. And you can see he’s the principal now. He’s been interested in meeting you for a while, but things have been busy recently for all of us.”

The owl peeped, head tilting to the side.

“Golden Week starts soon, so things get a bit less busier,” Sighing, Shouta waved a hand at his unread emails, “No such thing as vacations for a pro hero, but this comes as close as it can get which is why I’m guessing Nedzu has the time for a tea party.”

Or Nedzu had found out about the recent surge of trust between the two of them and finally decided to stick his nose and paws into their business. He wasn’t going to tell that to Mimizuku though. The owl had enough on his plate and didn’t need the extra stress of knowing that a rat was watching them.

“Nedzu is an animal with a quirk,” The pro opened up U.A.’s website and clicked into their faculty page, tapping the topmost image with a knuckle lightly, “Please don’t try to eat him. I would have to actually arrest you if you tried.”

Mimizuku gazed at the static image and chirped, ruffling his feathers before leaning to pull at Shouta’s sleeve. The pro gave him a fond look, carefully dislodging the fabric. He really didn’t want to sew up any tears later.

“Do you want to go visit him?”

‘Yes.’

The answer came very quickly, with almost no pause. Shouta’s eyebrows rose at that, but the man supposed the owl was just really interested in meeting another animal with a quirk. It made sense to him.

"Saturday is three days from now. Does that work for you?"

'Yes.'

"You'll have to come here early. Since you've never been to the school, I’ll be leading you for the most part. Will you be alright with me carrying you into the school?"

'Yes.'

Mimizuku chirped. He raised a clawed foot up and placed it against the pro hero’s hand before looking up at him, chirping again.

Shouta blinked back, a few seconds passing before he finally picked up on what the owl seemed to be telling him.

"I’ve got a glove for this," An expensive glove, but as long as it did what it was advertised to do, that was fine. It had surprised him when he found out the price tags on those types of specialty items, but all of the reviews had been stellar and the company itself had a good reputation. Made sense for quality products to have a corresponding price tag.

Speaking of money, he had told the owl about the check passed to him from the precinct for the panned out tip, had even explained the concept of money and spending to him, but the bird had held no real interest in it.

It had taken almost half an hour of talk and nibbled fingers, but they had finally agreed on Shouta taking the money. It wasn't as if the pro was planning to use it for anything, but the owl didn't need to know that. If anything, it was going to be a separate fund for future medical bills if Mimizuku ever got hurt or sick.

He had eventually decided to invest in a raptor glove not too long after that whole debacle. It was something he had been thinking about getting previously when he had noticed that despite Mimizuku getting comfortable enough with him to sit on his forearm a few times, he never tried climbing onto his capture weapon covered fist even when it was offered.

Shouta hadn’t shown the glove to the owl yet, but he supposed now would be a good time to test out to see if Mimizuku would perch on it. It was the most logical way of bringing him into U.A.

“We can test it out now actually,” The pro had tried it on before at Hizashi’s urging, just to make sure it fit his hand, but with the whole reason he had even purchased it here, he may as well take the chance to try it out properly, “I’ll go grab it.”

He had left the glove hanging by the entryway of the apartment right next to the hook where his own support weapon hung when he bothered to even hang it up. Grabbing it and returning to the living room, the pro hoped that Mimizuku would approve of it. In a practiced motion, he had the glove pulled onto his left hand, the hide soft against his bare skin.

“Mimizuku,” Shouta made sure the owl could see the glove before holding out his hand for the examination that was bound to happen, “This is a raptor glove. They’re specifically made so birds like you can perch on them without harming human hands with your talons.”

Mimizuku didn’t disappoint, hopping closer to him and butting the glove with the side of his head. He then laid a clawed foot against it, leaning in slightly before looking up at Shouta.

“I’m fine,” He wiggled the fingers of the glove, “Why don’t you try standing on it? It’s only logical to test this out before using it out in the open.”

The owl hooted and with a small hop and a flap of the wings, he perched on Shouta’s hand.

Mimizuku was hefty. The pro had previously read up on the weights of the eurasian eagle owl species, but it still surprised him. They were known to be one of the heaviest owls. Shouta thought that the owl weighed just under the weight of his smaller cast iron skillet probably. Definitely easier to hold though, he mused.

As Shouta shifted slightly, he could feel the strength of those talons even with the protection of the gloves. It was a slight pressure, nothing bad or harmful, but it was an attestation to the quality of the product that it could hold up to the grip strength of an owl. Of course, the pro knew that Mimizuku was likely not exerting all the strength he could, but he was grateful that he didn’t have to worry about numb fingers later.

“You like it?” Shouta hummed as he marveled silently at this new display of trust, “When we get to the school, this is how I’ll be taking you in with me through the front gates and inside the building. I don’t think flying in the corridors would be suitable given that there aren’t exactly many things you can perch on in the hallways without scratching them up.”

‘Yes.’

“I’ll make sure Nedzu has something proper for you to perch on in his office, so you won’t have to sit on my hand the entire time,” Shouta continued, “As for the journey there, you can follow me from the sky. You’ve got a ton of experience doing that already.”

Mimizuku only chirped at him. The little shit.

“Will you be alright around so many people? We’ll be traveling earlier than you usually like to be active and it’ll be noisy before we get to U.A.”

The owl paused before answering with a ‘yes.’

“You don’t have to worry about this. If anything happens, I’ll protect you, Mimizuku,” Shouta whispered, knowing full well that the owl’s keen hearing would be able to pick up whatever he was saying, “I promise.”

    If Shouta hadn’t been waived off by the requirement of a residence card/general proof of existence for a bank account, the new (joint) account made would have gone under the name ‘Aizawa Mimizuku.’ :D

    Izuku’s guilt is finally rearing its head in a more in-your-face manner; poor Izuku, but at least he gets to explore his feelings on things xD Shouta, on the other hand, well, his heart is doing that lurching thing every time that tracker goes off! Also Izuku loves his knives, yes.

    For people who are worried about Izuku’s education, please don’t worry about him. While he is behind-ish, he gets educated in the form of whatever Shouta/Hizashi decides to talk to him about, which can range from what currency is/how to use it to 'please stop disarming all these criminals from their knives, they’re sharp'. Izuku’s even picked up a bit of English vocabulary via osmosis because Hizashi enjoys talking to him so much!

    Thanks so much for reading!! Please let me know your thoughts on this!

Chapter Text

Izuku was very excited.

He was going to visit U.A. today!

The U.A.!

The high school that All Might went to!

The high school that Aizawa-san and Yamada-san went to!

The owl almost couldn't believe it. Him! Izuku! Getting to visit U.A.!

It was almost beyond his wildest dreams! (Except for that one dream about getting a quirk, because that actually did happen.)

And even better news was that a conversation he recorded and passed over to Aizawa-san might have been useful! Izuku hadn't been entirely sure it would have been good information, but he knew that the man he had seen was acting very suspicious. It was like how Kacchan acted that one time he got caught punching him in the face. Even though he didn't get in trouble for it anyways.

Izuku hoped that it helped with Aizawa-san's current case. The pro hero always looked so tired whenever he visited him. It made him feel bad that the man could be wasting his time spending it with him instead of using it to take a nap.

Yamada-san had told him before that Aizawa-san was always more relaxed after his visits, so he hoped that he was right. He would have to try to visit more often if that was the real case, despite his guilt.

Aizawa-san was such a nice person after all. He deserved all of the good things he could get. Izuku couldn't do much for him, but he'd do his best for what he could do for his favorite person.

Izuku thought that his Mama would agree with him. She always did tell him to treat people how he’d like to be treated himself.

He was nervous too, of course. That sickly feeling was bubbling underneath his excitement and he did his best to squash it down even more. Izuku didn’t like spending time out of his roost when the sun was still high in the sky. Not only was it against his own instincts, but it left him in full view of any bystanders.

Aizawa-san said that he’d protect him, and it wasn’t as if he didn’t believe the pro hero’s words, but even Aizawa-san couldn’t really protect him from being seen. The only thing really protecting him from being found was his quirk.

As long as he was an owl, he was safe.

And as long as he was an owl, Aizawa-san and Yamada-san would care for him.

Izuku knew it was a bad thing to lie, but was it really lying when he was planning to be an owl for the rest of forever?

It didn’t stop his guilt, but that was something he knew he would have to continue living with. He liked the two heroes too much to stop visiting them.

He didn’t even want to think about spending all his time alone again.

Izuku shivered slightly, feathers ruffling in the warm breeze.

Aizawa-san had made their meeting with Principal Nedzu as late as he could, but it was still pretty early compared to when he usually was awake. His excitement for visiting the school had woken him up even earlier though and he was afraid that he might oversleep if he tried to take a small nap.

He had ended up arriving at the apartment before Aizawa-san had even put on proper pants. These were a bright pink that Izuku had never seen before. It was almost unreal. The owl had even tried to pull on the drawstring with his beak just to make sure he wasn’t actually dreaming this up, but the hero had shooed him away from his pants. Yamada-san laughed while taking a photo of this.

Izuku hadn’t really heard much laughter like Yamada-san’s. His Mama had laughed, but it was never loud and she definitely never ended up on the floor while doing it.

When Aizawa-san went to get dressed, Yamada-san pulled something out of a nearby shelf, the last of his chuckles fading into a smile.

“Mimizuku!” He motioned Izuku over, patting the spot next to him on the couch when he sat down, “Come see!”

The owl was curious, flying over and landing right where the pro’s hand had been just a few seconds ago. Izuku blinked, recognizing it as a photo album. The kanji on the front of the cover was the same as the one back at his old home.

Izuku chirped, wondering what kind of photos were in there. Maybe photos of U.A.? Or was it more like Aizawa-san and Yamada-san as kids? He butted his head against Yamada-san’s hand, now eager to see what was inside.

“Gosh, you’re impatient, ‘Zuku,” Izuku looked up at the man, eyes wide. What did he say? Did he say his name? Did he say ‘Izuku’? He peeped, using his beak to pull at Yamada-san’s sleeve, making the blond man groan, “Mi-mi-zu-ku. No pulling!”

“Mimizuku,” Aizawa-san’s voice called out from down the hallway, “Don’t pull.”

Izuku let go and clacked his beak in annoyance. He had only wanted Yamada-san to repeat himself. Had he heard wrong? Or was it just his nerves making him mishear?

"Geez, must be the cranky teenage rebellion owl stage," Yamada-san sighed, "I feel more like a dad than ever now."

Izuku grumbled to himself, but the sight of the still closed photo album was enough to distract his fading ire. He tapped the album, chirping at the blond.

Yamada-san obligingly opened the photo album for him, the first photo immediately snagging his attention. Izuku could easily recognize Aizawa-san and Yamada-san in the photo.

“That’s U.A. there in the background,” The pro pointed at the large building in the photo, “It’s hard to miss in-person, but I figure it’d be helpful to at least know what it looks like. If you somehow lose Shou along the way, just find the big building, yeah?”

‘Yes.’

Izuku then chirped, tapping the photo album again. He really wanted to see more of the photos.

“These are photographs,” Yamada-san continued and Izuku wanted to groan. Not being able to speak like a human really was rough sometimes, “You can take them with a phone or a camera and then have them printed out like this. It’s like freezing a moment of time you can then revisit later on.”

“Shou and I both have photo albums back from when we were kiddos, but this one is mostly a family one, just me an’ him together,” The blond flipped to the next page, showing him a photo of Aizawa-san napping in a tree’s branches, “Most of them are ones I took, since I’m a bigger fan of taking photos, but there are a few that he took of you in here too.”

Izuku peeped, looking up at the man. Did they really? Yamada-san had just said it was a family album though. They really put him in their family album?

“See? Here’s you with a knife,” Yamada-san chuckled, pointing at the photo. Izuku blinked; it really was a photo of an owl with a knife. He blinked again. It was the first time he had seen himself so clearly actually. Sure he saw his reflection in pools of water or the windows of buildings, but it was always dark in spite of his owl vision. Figuring out what he looked like when he had meals to hunt for instead didn’t make sense. Izuku wasn’t surprised at all though; he looked like an owl. It was just about what he expected.

“And here’s you getting stroked by Shou,” Another page was turned, “And here’s another of you getting stroked by Shou. And another! Ooh, this one Shou took! See? It’s you looking all floofy! And here’s one where you were yawning. Oh man, some of these are great.”

Izuku was growing embarrassed; he really hoped that owls didn’t blush or else he might just go hide under the coffee table somehow. Sure it was a bit low and he may not even fit, but he had never been that big of a fan of direct attention anyways.

“Oh here’s one where you’re both napping,” Yamada-san’s voice turned into a coo, “Just look at the two of you! My sleepy boys!”

It was a weird feeling of both embarrassment and happiness mixing together within him. If he could cry, he knew that tears would already be falling down his cheeks with his voice already choked up. He really wanted to hug Yamada-san, but satisfied himself with a nuzzle to the cheek, careful to not poke the hero with his beak.

“Cute,” Aizawa-san had his phone pointed at them, the movement of the shutter catching Izuku’s eyes, “Another photo for the album. I think this one might be the first one we have with both you and Mimizuku in it.”

“We should get a photo with all three of us in it!” The blond grinned as he lightly nuzzled back against the owl’s head, “We don’t have one of those yet either!”

“Mimizuku?” Aizawa-san waved a gloved hand, beckoning him as he came closer and handed his phone over to Yamada-san, “Family photo?”

Izuku didn’t tap out an answer, only hopping onto the arm of the couch and then onto Aizawa-san’s hand.

The dark haired man let out a small laugh, his breath ruffling the owl’s plumage. Izuku peeped in indignation, immediately starting to preen the misplaced feathers back down, even using a clawed foot to nudge them back into place. Izuku thought it was very rude that Aizawa-san would do this right after suggesting a family photo. He really didn’t want to look sloppy in the photo. It was enough that they had a photo of him yawning; they didn’t need one where he looked like he was just blasted by a fan.

“I think he wants to look pretty for the camera,” Yamada-san held the phone out, the front facing them, “You two good?”

Aizawa-san nodded, hefting his hand slightly higher up so the three of them could fit in the frame. Izuku chirped, puffing out his chest slightly, the white feathers a stark difference against all the tawny browns.

“Say cheese!”

Yamada-san smiled widely as he tapped the screen to take the photo. Aizawa-san also had a small smile on his lips. Izuku.. Izuku was an owl. Izuku hoped he looked like a happy owl at least.

"Do you like it, Mimizuku?" Yamada-san tapped into the gallery to see the photo again, showing it to the bird, "If you like it, I'm gonna get like two of these babies printed out."

Izuku tilted his head, slightly confused on why they would need two copies of the same photo, but tapped out a 'yes' nonetheless.

"We've got a frame somewhere in a box, so I think this'll be perfect to hang up," Yamada-san handed the phone back to Aizawa-san, "Just gotta find it and figure out the dimensions."

“You do that,” The dark haired pro slid the phone into his back pocket before sliding open one of the balcony doors, “Mimizuku and I are heading off now.”

“Gotcha!” Yamada-san shot them a thumbs up and a wink before heading down the hallway, “Love you! See you two later!”

Izuku chirped back at him before focusing back on the fading daylight of the outside.

Was this really alright?

Being happy with Aizawa-san and Yamada-san?

It felt right. He liked this.

A new family.

Shouta was making his way to U.A.

It felt a bit nostalgic even though the route he was taking was different from the one he used to take back when he still attended that school. Perhaps it was just the knowledge that he was returning back to high school.

He had been tempted to make the trip shorter by taking the train, but asking Mimizuku to follow a train was just not logical. Not only was the train full of people during this time of day, but it was noisy. Shouta had known about the owl’s distaste for noise for a while now, but the aversion to being seen was something he had only identified recently. He had thought it was some sort of animal instinct, some drive that pushed Mimizuku to avoid humans because of how dangerous they could be, but the owl was comfortable enough around people to live in the city. If he had wanted to flat out avoid humans in general, he had every opportunity to just fly off north where there were more forested lands and smaller towns.

The owl was fine living around people, but didn’t like people seeing him? There was a story behind that, he knew it. Now that he thought about it, Mimizuku had fled after their initial encounters with him - both that time where he had seen that silhouette against the moon and after The Knife Incident.

He had previously established that the owl had some sort of issue with trust; it would make sense for those two things to be connected somehow. Association didn’t always result in causation though and he was wary of bringing anything up that might break the trust between him and the bird. They weren’t at the stage where he could pull off a logical ruse. He might even get bitten for it.

Shouta didn’t even know if an intelligence quirk would allow Mimizuku to understand the concepts behind a logical ruse. He would assume so, but he also knew that intelligence quirks tended to vary in degree. Not every one of those quirks could result in a Nedzu-level of intelligence. Thankfully.

It was a fact that Mimizuku was smart. However, every single article he had read on owls had stated that compared to most other species of birds, owls usually never ranked that high up on intelligence. That seemed to be the norm, even in the current Quirked society.

That meant that Mimizuku was an exception in terms of brains. He could understand human speech, human technology, and even replicate human etiquette. Even being able to act as an informant was beyond most animals.

He was hoping that Nedzu would be able to shed some light on this.

Mimizuku really was a bird of mystery.

Izuku was glad that Aizawa-san made it very clear where he was heading. It also helped that he already knew what the building looked like from the photo that Yamada-san had shown him, so if he did lose Aizawa-san below in the streets, he could still try to make his way to the school. He really didn’t want to lose sight of the pro hero though. The area they were in was not one he had been in before and he didn’t want to waste Aizawa-san’s or Nedzu-san’s time if they had to go find him if he got lost.

He just wished the sun would fall faster. Aizawa-san had mentioned that it was a weekend where lots of people went on vacation and had days off, and he was definitely seeing it. Families of all sizes were together in the streets, all doing their own things. He hoped they were all heading home, so that there wasn’t a chance of them seeing him later that night when he had to fly back.

The sunlight did feel nice against his back, but it made him even more conscious of the fact that if one person looked up and saw him there, they’d see him.

Izuku didn’t know how long he had been following Aizawa-san but he did note that less and less people appeared the further they went. Instead of buildings, there were trees now. There was much less noise here as well, reminding him of empty parks at night.

Aizawa-san had stopped walking, looking around him, his eyes looking through the trees. Was he looking for him? Izuku chirped once, stepping out on a branch away from the trunk. He knew that his feathers helped him blend in pretty well, so it did make some sense to him if Aizawa-san couldn't find him at first glance.

“Mimizuku,” He blinked, “I thought that I might have lost you somewhere. I really underestimated how long it’d take to get here.”

Izuku chirped again. Silly Aizawa-san; it wasn’t his fault that so many people were around or that U.A. was so far away from the apartment.

"U.A. is on top of this hill, so you can go on ahead if you want."

It was tempting. He didn't really like the thought of being separated from Aizawa-san when they were both so far away from their territory, but he was feeling a bit hungry from all the flying he had already done today. Izuku could hear the minute footfalls of creatures scampering about. It would be a good chance to get a snack in. Especially since he knew he'd have to fly back later.

Izuku cooed and tapped out a 'yes' before pushing himself off the branch, flapping to make his way over the trees. He wasn't as worried about people seeing him now compared to earlier even if the sun hadn't fully fallen yet. Aizawa-san was the only person around anyways.

He decided to get near the top of the hill first, making sure he had the time to spare to hunt. It would be rude to make Aizawa-san and Nedzu-san wait.

As he flew over the trees, Izuku made sure to keep an eye on the road stretching up the hill. Remembering landmarks was important. This was the first time he had even left his territory ever since he had first arrived there. If he couldn't get back, it was practically giving up on his territory!

Izuku did think the forest was nice though. There were a lot of trees full of leaves and branches. It probably would have made a good home for him if he didn't already know that it surrounded U.A. and had lots of teachers and students going there all the time. He would have definitely been seen eventually even if he only came out during nighttime. It was probably hard to sneak around pro heroes.

It didn't take long for him to reach the top of the hill, the school building impossible to miss. Izuku took a moment to admire the building. It looked much bigger in person than it did in the photograph.

He was still nervous yeah, but who wouldn’t be? This was U.A.! The top hero school in the country!

Izuku quickly retreated back into the forest, intent on hunting something down. Hunting in a forest was different from hunting in the city. There were just so many trees and he had to be careful that he didn't clip himself on branches while maneuvering. It didn't take long for him to find something to sate his appetite, quickly pouncing upon and then gulping the critter down.

He didn't stay long on the ground, taking back to the sky once he had finished eating, wings open to catch an updraft back to the top. Landing onto a branch in view of the road and the school entrance, Izuku waited.

As the minutes passed, the owl nervously nibbled at his toes, making sure no animal bits were left on his talons. Aizawa-san had mentioned that Nedzu-san was an animal with a quirk after all. And to try to not eat him. The picture of Nedzu-san on the website did kind of look like a rat, so it was understandable.

It really was best that Izuku ate before the meeting. Then there would be no temptation to even try, hopefully.

Aizawa-san appeared not too long after, much to Izuku’s delight, a small coo leaving his beak. The pro looked up at the sound, black eyes meeting green.

"Mimizuku, you ready?" He beckoned with his gloved hand, "Get down here."

Izuku obliged, hopping off his perch and landing safely onto Aizawa-san’s fist, his talons clutching at but not piercing through the glove. He tapped once for a 'yes', before chirping, his excitement bleeding through his nervousness. Aizawa-san’s dark eyes looked amused before fading back down into its usual neutral state. Turning, the pro made his way closer to the entrance, holding down a small button by the gate, a small light flashing on.

"Aizawa Shouta and Mimizuku here for a meeting with Principal Nedzu."

    Izuku > o h n o

    Izuku is finally realizing some very important things while he and his bird dads fall further into domesticity. Hizashi calling him ‘Zuku really did startle him pretty badly though. He thinks he’s pretty much thrown away his life as Izuku and is 100% ready to be Mimizuku. :c

    This chapter was supposed to include Nedzu! At least that’s what my outline said. But it was not meant to be, so I ended up shifting the entire meeting to the next chapter. We had cute family fluff this chapter though, so I’m happy!

    Shouta is starting to figure out some things about his bird son as well. They’re all doing their best! >w<

    Thank you for reading! Please let me know your thoughts!

    Next chapter comes out May 29th. It’s here! The meeting with Nedzu!

Chapter Text

Aizawa Shouta did not expect the first visit back to his old high school after he graduated would involve his own free will and an owl. He had expected it might involve bribes from Hizashi or Nemuri, or maybe some case that Nedzu had requested him for, but nothing like this.

He was careful to not show any of his wariness with his expressions. Mimizuku had picked up on his emotions more than a few times over the months and having to bring an uppity owl to a meeting with a dog-mouse-bear creature? Sounded like an utter train wreck.

Mimizuku did seem interested in the school itself at least, barely sparing Shouta any of his attention. Instead, the owl was bobbing and turning his head, eyes wide at the main building.

Like a kid at a candy store, Shouta mused, watching him fondly. He wasn’t sure he could understand the type of wonder the owl was going through right now, but it reminded him of his own first day of high school. Just the experience of walking through the front gates and then to the entrance, all the while with the towering school looming over everything. It was a pity that hanami season was already over for the year; that would have been the cherry on top of the figurative sundae.

Mimizuku was even more vocal than he usually was, peeps, chirps, and even the occasional whistle leaving his beak. Shouta could only indulge him, speaking in a low voice about whatever his eyes met, his voice echoing slightly in the empty hallways.

“That’s the front desk. Hizashi took a selfie laying down on it once when the secretary went to refill her coffee.”

“That’s the auditorium. Too many speeches. I can’t even imagine how long they are now since Nedzu is the principal.”

“Cafeteria. Didn’t really spend that much time in there. I ate on the roof.”

“That’s the room for 1-C, the homeroom I started in. I didn't spend too long in there either.”

“1-A, Hizashi’s homeroom back during first year. I joined this class after I won the Sports Festival.”

“Teacher’s lounge. Probably where the coffee machine is. It’s only logical.”

“And that’s the Principal’s office. Only been in there once and that was when my transfer to the hero course was being finalized.”

Shouta stopped there, the door in front of them. He would admit he was just a bit nervous, but who wouldn’t be? Meeting up with his old teacher who was now principal? Not exactly what he signed up for when he decided to go into Heroics. But Nedzu was the premier expert in animals with quirks, to the surprise of no one, so his fate was sealed the very moment that Mimizuku had snatched that knife away from that thug where he could see it. He didn’t regret anything about his relationship with the owl though, the avian proving to be extremely lovable and affectionate underneath the veneer of mistrust.

“Mimizuku,” The owl blinked at him at the sound of his name, “You ready to meet him?”

‘Yes.’

Shouta nodded and steeled himself, bringing his ungloved hand up to knock the door, blinking when it opened by itself right as his knuckle brushed against it. Mimizuku didn’t seem surprised, only swivelling his head to look at the hinges.

Typical Nedzu-like thing to do. Rat should be glad that the owl didn’t scream bloody murder instead.

He strode in, turning to close the door behind him when it closed by itself. Right. Should've expected that too. Mimizuku peeped, his ear tufts fluffing up, eyes trained on a long white tail swaying from behind the large desk in the room.

“Am I a mouse? A dog? A bear?” A familiar chipper voice rang out while two white paws propped themselves up onto the chair. Two ears and beady black eyes then followed, “I’m the Principal of U.A., Nedzu!”

Shouta wanted to go home already.

Izuku was having a wonderful time.

From the walk to the Principal's office, to Aizawa-san’s descriptions of places they passed, everything so far had been so cool.

And now they were meeting Nedzu-san!

While Izuku had known what the Principal looked like, the tail, of all things, had caught him by surprise. It made him think of a long wiggly worm. Honestly, he was just glad that he had no sudden urge of hunger. Plus the description of a mouse-dog-bear was confusing him enough.

"Please! Take a seat!" A paw gestured at the empty seat in front of the desk and then to a large tree branch, "As for Mimizuku-kun, I have a perch ready for you!"

Aizawa-san sat, lifting the hand that Izuku was standing on closer to the branch, making the distance for him to cross easily done with a small hop. It was a sturdy branch, Izuku noted, his talons digging into the wood. Must have come from a really big tree.

“Aizawa-kun, tea?” Delicate tea cups had been already filled, steam still rising from the lightly colored liquid. Izuku couldn’t exactly smell it, but he was sure it smelled nice.

"Thanks," Aizawa-san nodded, ignoring the paw pointing out the milk and sugar available and instead swishing the tea in the cup, breathing in the aroma, "Chamomile?"

"Yes!" Nedzu-san seemed delighted, ears pricked up and tail wagging, "A recent purchase that I've been very much enjoying."

The two sipped their tea in unison. Izuku watched while remembering Aizawa-san telling him that Nedzu-san was his old teacher. This must have been something they did often back then. Like a tradition.

"Let's cut to the chase," The man sighed, placing his cup back onto it's saucer, "What's your reasoning behind calling this meeting?"

Izuku perked up; he was curious about that as well. While he had been enjoying his visit so far, it did seem odd to him that he got invited along with Aizawa-san.

"Why curiosity of course!" Izuku could see the minute twitch of the man's eyebrow, "It's not often that I meet someone like Mimizuku-kun after all."

Aizawa-san only sighed. Izuku, who had heard many of the pro hero’s sighs, recognized it as the one that meant ‘of course, I don’t know why I would have thought otherwise.’ He hooted lowly, trying to mimic a laugh, the sound coming out as a stuttered uu-hoo-hoo-hoo.

The white creature then turned towards him, teeth bared in what Izuku figured might be glee. While Izuku had always been very observant, the ability even strengthened with the enhanced senses of his quirk, he had a hard time figuring out what the Principal of U.A. could be trying to express. Yamada-san was usually very open about his feelings. Aizawa-san didn't show them as much or as often, but Izuku had spent so much time with the man that he was getting very good at picking out the subtle undertones of his moods.

Nedzu-san… Nedzu-san was a lot harder to understand. It was probably because he was an animal, Izuku reasoned to himself. He hunted for his prey every night, but he rarely studied how they acted. He usually struck too quickly for anything like that and his hunger took precedence. His eyes also caught sight of the scar crossing over one of those black eyes. Izuku didn't really know much about Nedzu-san’s past or hero career, but he hoped that it wasn't caused by an owl like him. That would be awkward.

"Mimizuku-kun!" His furry head dipped into a shallow bow, "I am Nedzu! Principal of U.A High School! It is a pleasure to finally meet you!"

Izuku blinked, chirping and bowing back in return. If anything, those manners that his Mama instilled into him still held strong, the bow coming naturally to him. He tapped out a 'yes' and turned to the one human in the room, hoping he'd translate. Aizawa-san sighed again. This one meant 'of course I will.'

"Mimizuku agrees on it being a pleasure to meet you," The man grumbled out, "And before you ask, Mimizuku knows he can tap a certain amount of times for specific replies. Once for 'yes', and twice for 'no.' Those are the two that only really apply here."

Izuku tapped 'yes' again, ear tufts erect. While he was usually much more wary of meeting new people nowadays, Nedzu-san didn't set off his instincts much. Even meeting Yamada-san at first made his feathers ruffle, his loud voice and tall hair instantly making him flare up in response. On the other hand, Nedzu-san looked soft and shiny, and while he was bigger than the rats that Izuku hunted, he wasn't that much bigger than Izuku.

"Thank you, Aizawa-kun," Nedzu-san clapped his paws together once, twice, before pulling out a pile of cards from a drawer, "However! I have already prepared a method of communication!"

The cards were fanned out, words and pictures printed on each of them. They reminded Izuku of the posters that hung on his daycare walls that taught them colors or food groups.

He still felt a bit bad that he hadn't had any fruits or vegetables in so long. Mama would have been so upset with him for having meat for every single meal. He did try to eat a leaf once, but he couldn't get himself to swallow it. Maybe veggies just weren't for owls.

He could read some of the cards, but it had been a long time since he had actually practiced his reading. The pictures there were much more helpful. The owl examined the cards carefully as they were put down one by one on the desk, none of them overlapping with one another.

Aizawa-san looked interested as well, his eyes also scanning the cards before looking over at him. Izuku chirped back; he thought it might be fun to be able to express himself other than using yes or no questions for once.

“Allow me to start, Mimizuku-kun,” Both his and Aizawa-san’s gaze returned to the principal and then to the desk, “How was your journey to U.A? Feel free to choose any of these cards as descriptors!”

Izuku already knew which cards he wanted to pick for answering this specific question; he hopped off of his perch and onto the desk, talons clicking against the wood. Wondering if he should try to pick up the cards with his beak, he quickly decided against that when he ended up chasing the card on the desk for a few seconds, not even managing to pick it up due to it’s slippery surface. He ended up using a talon to tap the cards, being careful to not slide them over the edge of the desk.

‘Sunny’, ‘Loud’, and ‘City’ were what he ended up choosing. Nedzu-san seemed pleased at his reply, continuing to ask him questions about what he thought of U.A (‘Big’ ‘Hero’ ‘School’) and what he thought of Aizawa-san even! (‘Tall’ ‘Quiet’ ‘Hero’). Honestly, there weren’t enough words that Izuku could choose to describe Aizawa-san. To Izuku, the pro hero was not only just any hero, he was Izuku’s hero. He tapped the ‘Hero’ card a few more times to try to make it clear.

He continued looking over the cards, determined to find more words he could label Aizawa-san with. 'Eraser' and 'Head' were quickly tapped, with 'Scarf' also chosen after a moment of thought. Eraserhead’s scarf was too cool to not be included. It also made for a surprisingly good nest to sit in. He had spent many evenings sitting in the piled scarf next to Aizawa-san, dozing off in the soft and warm material with Yamada-san talking on the radio.

When he thought he had finished going through all the cards on the desk, he noticed one he had missed. It was half covered by another card. Izuku figured he might have shifted them over each other when he was shuffling around to tap at cards, so he nudged the top card away, revealing the last card.

His talon reached out, tapping the card twice before he could even think it through.

'Father'

It was true, wasn't it?

It hurt for his Mama to be gone.

He still missed her.

But Aizawa-san meant so much more to him than just a hero or a friend now.

It was weird. Hisashi had never really been like how Aizawa-san was to him.

He could hear the rustle of a sleeve from behind him. Izuku turned, intercepting the fingers with his head, nudging against them. Aizawa-san chuckled, giving his head a few short strokes.

"A father? Well if you don't mind that I'm not an owl, I don't see why not."

Izuku peeped at him, before stepping away to tap 'Bird' and 'Son'.

"That you are," Aizawa-san had an amused look on his face, "To Hizashi too."

He felt warm, like he had just eaten a large bowl of homemade katsudon. His memories of what it tasted like were all gone by now, but he never quite forgot how it made him feel inside. Izuku continued answering questions with a new vigor, eager to show off what else he knew.

It was going well and Nedzu-san seemed to enjoy asking him questions. He also seemed to enjoy going off into tangents. Izuku didn’t mind that at all, more than happy to listen to the impromptu lesson on how animals adapted to living in the city. It was like being back in daycare again!

Brrrrinng!

Izuku startled slightly as the shrill sound went off, swiveling his head to see Aizawa-san taking his phone out with a small grimace on his face. He stood, a flash of surprise crossing his eyes.

“I need to take this,” He made his way to the door, calling behind him, “Be good, Mimizuku.”

Ruffling his feathers, Izuku only turned his attention back to the principal.

“You are a very good child from what I can tell so far, Mimizuku-kun,” Nedzu-san chuckled to himself, “I wonder why Aizawa-kun would think you would act otherwise.”

Izuku peeped indignantly, clacking his beak as well. He was always good. Well, he tried his best to be good and that had to count for something. Nedzu-san only laughed at his actions, tea almost spilling from his cup. Izuku chirped in surprise, unsure how to react to this, but before he could do anything, Nedzu-san stopped to pour a new cup of tea, his smile not leaving his face.

“Well, enough of that! We can continue the lesson at a later date perhaps,” Nedzu-san took a sip of tea, his ears wiggling in what seemed to be delight, “It has been a while since I’ve had such a rapt audience. Perhaps on your next visit, we can discuss more! You seem very bright and I’d be more than happy to meet with you again!”

Izuku tapped out ‘yes’, extremely pleased with himself and cooing in agreement. Meeting with Nedzu-san had been so fun so far! And while he loved spending time with Aizawa-san and Yamada-san, he didn’t exactly want to get to know more people (it was dangerous!), really. Nedzu-san was only the third person he had actually met since starting his owl life, but so far, it was going really well!

Maybe meeting others was okay, as long as they thought he was just an owl.

"How about one last question to finish this off?" A gesture at the closed door, "I have a feeling that Aizawa-kun will have to leave soon."

Izuku blinked in surprise, but tapped out a 'yes', wondering how Nedzu-san even figured out something like that. He tilted his head; he couldn't even hear anything from behind the door besides some murmurs.

"Tell me, Mimizuku-kun, what do you know of Aizawa-kun's quirk?"

An easy question! Izuku had seen him use it on patrols and even at home on Hizashi-san; it was a pretty cool quirk. It reminded him of how he could puff out his feathers and spread his wings to scare others away. Aizawa-san managed to scare people so badly that they stopped using their quirk!

'Eyes' and 'Red' were the first two he tapped. After some quick consideration, 'Hair' and 'Up' were also chosen. For the final card, he went for 'Scary'.

Izuku wished that he could write about quirks in his notebook again, before pushing that thought away. Putting down what he knew about Aizawa-san's quirk would have been fun, but it wasn't something he could do anymore now.

A small click caught his attention, head turning to see the pro hero return to the room, the tired look back on his face. He was immediately concerned; did this have to do with the phone call from earlier?

"Sensei, we have to go," Aizawa-san began, already beckoning to him with a finger, "Mimizuku, come on."

Izuku pushed off the desk carefully, a slight flap of his wings allowing him to land right onto Aizawa-san’s glove.

"Sorry for the suddenness of this," He bowed; Izuku also quickly bowed right after, following his lead, "Thanks for the invite. And the tea."

"It's no problem. The job of a pro hero never waits after all," Nedzu-san waved a paw at them, "It was a pleasure seeing you again, Aizawa-kun. And it was a pleasure meeting you, Mimizuku-kun. Perhaps you will have some tea with me next time we meet! We'll see each other again, I'm sure!"

Izuku quickly nodded before Aizawa-san did, the man quickly making his way out of the room, his long legs taking them down the hallways and out the front doors. Were owls allowed to have tea? He didn’t know about that.

Izuku watched the pro hero carefully for any signs of bad news. He really hoped that Aizawa-san hadn’t gotten bad news on the phone. What could have been so important that they had to leave in such a hurry?

It wasn't until they were halfway down the hill that the man spoke up.

"That information you passed on to me just got corroborated by another source. It's something big."

Izuku chirped in surprise. So it was good news?

"We might finally be seeing the end of this case here in Musutafu."

Izuku hoped so.

"I'm going to be heading straight to the precinct from here, can you make it back home on your own?"

'Yes.'

"Alright then. Off you go, Mimizuku."

And Izuku jumped, taking off into the dark sky.

He still heard Aizawa-san’s whisper from behind him.

“Stay safe.”

It was a promise.

He would.

Notes:

    Izuku > You are my dad! You’re my dad!
    Shouta >
    Shouta > I'm not an owl but ok

    Ah, Nedzu is as cryptic as ever. You guys already know though, owls don’t drink tea. Izuku doesn’t quite realize that. Nedzu absolutely does know about Izuku's little 'predicament', but he's also an animal who did not grow up with human social conventions. Remember, this takes place years before canon starts, so while he is one of (if not the most) intelligent beings in the country, he falls a bit short when it comes to proper child procedures still. Plus, he mostly deals with teenagers and those are pretty much a different species compared to kids. :P

    Basically he went, ah the kid seems healthy and happy and he sees Aizawa-kun as a dad! Very cute! I'm sure the truth will come out eventually, even without my help. :)

    In the meantime, Izuku has claimed his dad in full witness of another person. Shouta is very touched. ;v;

    Also we find out what Izuku thinks Shouta's quirk is! An Intimidation quirk!

    Thanks for reading! Please let me know your thoughts! :D

Chapter Text

Izuku was bored.

He found himself bored pretty often nowadays. He could only hunt so much during the night and it was never good to hunt more than he could eat. It wasn't as if his roost had a refrigerator so he could store extra meat in there for later. Also, he really doubted that Aizawa-san and Yamada-san would let him put stuff in theirs either.

They might be pro heroes, but dead rats and pigeons in their fridge? It was a one-way ticket to getting a lecture from Aizawa-san about germs and diseases. Plus, Yamada-san would probably scream if he saw those in there and he really didn't want that to happen.

Izuku sighed in his head. Aizawa-san was visiting the police precinct a lot more often recently and that was one place he made sure to steer clear of, so it wasn't as if he could go visit him. He was tempted to visit Nedzu-san, but U.A. was far from his claimed territory and he didn't even know if the creature lived at U.A.? As for Yamada-san… He'd actually never been to where Yamada-san worked, but he knew that it had a lot of people and tended to be super noisy, so that was a big no.

Maybe Yamada-san wasn't working tonight? It would be fine to pay a visit to the apartment just to check, if nothing else. And he could keep an ear out while flying for any other bits of information he could deliver to Aizawa-san. He hadn't really found anything worth recording in the last few days, but he supposed that was good, in a way. If there weren't people talking on the streets about it, that meant it wasn't happening anymore, right?

Izuku really didn't know. Daycare had never taught him anything about this sort of thing, so he was just making assumptions. All he could do was hope for the best and maybe he'd get lucky overhearing something important.

He couldn't even go tell Aizawa-san about bad things happening on the streets now. Finding it on his own was useless since he didn't dare try stopping it by himself. The only thing that would happen if he showed himself like that would be more people knowing about him and that was not a good thing. Plus, he really didn’t want to really get lectured again. Aizawa-san had even said that though he hadn’t found previous cases of owls getting arrested for vigilantism, he would absolutely do his best to try to get him in for a night if he ever tried fighting crime. Izuku knew he was being serious, and it wasn’t as if he wanted to get arrested either. Getting arrested would involve more people! And that was what he was trying to avoid!

But he still liked to help people. It was just more tricky now than just getting in the way of others getting hit on the playground. Izuku didn’t know what exactly would happen if he got hurt while trying to save someone. He just knew it wasn’t something he wanted and if it ever did happen, Aizawa-san would probably give him that ‘why do you do this’ sigh and Izuku really didn’t want to disappoint the man.

And if he did get really hurt… The first thing that came to mind were doctors. Animal doctors? Whichever kind they were, he wasn’t eager to meet them. The memories of that doctor’s appointment still stung even now, even when he knew that the doctor was wrong all those years ago.

Izuku continued to fly, finally nearing the apartment. Before landing, he decided to check the windows for any lights. To his surprise and glee, the living room light was already on, the small movements of someone moving visible to his eyes. He perched onto the railing before hopping down, a chirp already leaving his beak.

Yamada-san was in the living room with a feather duster and a rag cleaning some ornaments on a shelf when he turned.

Izuku could see his eyes brighten up and a smile pulling at his lips.

"Big bird!" He greeted, putting down the duster on the table, the rag already stuffed into the waistband of his pants, "Hope your night is going well!"

The sliding door was opened for him and Izuku chirped his thanks as he entered, immediately hopping onto his stool.

The radio was already on, the low music a perfect background to the sort of dance Yamada-san was doing as he picked up his duster to continue cleaning.

The shelf was full of books. They were all ones he had never read before, (not that he had read that many before becoming an owl), but he didn't expect them to have books he could have read anyways. There were even some that had English titles! He couldn't even hope to even sound those out, despite recognizing the letters. Izuku wondered if any of the books had to do with heroes. If there were any, maybe he could somehow ask Aizawa-san or Yamada-san to read it to him? If they weren't busy at least. That sounded like a good time to him.

It would have to be something he tried on another night though; Yamada-san was busy cleaning after all and Izuku knew a lot about how much time cleaning could take up. He didn't mind just spending his time here silently.

Just being together with Yamada-san right here, right now, made him happy.

Hizashi considered himself a smart man. He had managed to get married to Shouta after all. Not that it took that much convincing after he pulled out some logic of his own. (Small tax cuts aside, his agency's health insurance policy beat out Shou's by a shitton!)

Despite all the respect and love he had for his husband, he really was frequently baffled by all the odd situations that Shouta got himself involved in.

It wasn't a bad thing.

Case in point.

Mimizuku.

The strangely intelligent owl was a feathery wrapped mystery in and of itself.

To be frank, Hizashi had never expected the bird to make that much of an impact in their lives. But looking at where they were now? Mimizuku really had carved out a little (or big!) owl-shaped space in their hearts.

Hizashi really did hope that Mimizuku was here to stay. He hoped that the owl did understand that he was accepted as part of their small family. Having done some of his own research on owl behavior, he knew that the species tended towards solitary living, but Mimizuku seemed to enjoy spending some of his waking hours with him and Shou. Just meant that the owl was an exception to the rules, probably.

He was a pro hero though. And being a pro hero meant thinking outside of the box.

His eyes told him that Mimizuku was an owl. A large green eyed owl, but an owl for sure. That was non-debatable.

But there was a niggling thought in his mind that was convinced that this surface portrait wasn’t the whole story.

It had been a problem when he was a kid as well. Curiosity was such a pain sometimes. He just wanted to know! More information was never a bad thing, especially considering the careers that he had eventually ended up in.

Despite his suspicions, he also had a feeling that Mimizuku didn’t mean them any harm. It was the only reason why he hadn’t insisted they call in the proper authorities to deal with this once he had found out about the whole knife thing, especially after he had also found out that Shouta had basically told a wild animal where they lived.

Once he had that straightened out, it was clear to him that the owl held a distinct affection for the two of them. Honestly, being around Mimizuku reminded him of the times he spent babysitting his neighbor’s kids back in high school, weirdly enough. Just less scribbling on walls and more blinking and napping. Kind of like Shou, if he really thought about it. Cute.

As a matter of fact, Mimizuku was napping right now, eyes closed, his face looking like he was smiling. Hizashi had to stop himself from cooing, instead quickly whipping out his phone for a photo. His phone’s gallery had so many photos of Mimizuku now! Sure, some of them were more silly (like that one where Shou had convinced Mimizuku to sit on his hair when he hadn’t washed out his hair gel yet), but some of them were heartwarming snapshots of bird kisses or of Mimizuku just chilling in Shouta’s lap while he was on his phone, his feet all tucked up under him.

He’d have to get those printed out soon. It was hard enough already to not go bragging about his and Shou’s cute bird son when he was hanging out with Nemuri or Tensei for some drinks on the weekend. Tenya was a cute kid, true, but! Hizashi was sure that if Mimizuku was an actual kid, he’d be adorable as fuck, okay? It was a real pity that Shouta didn’t want him to tell any other people about Mimizuku yet. His fingers itched so badly whenever Tensei took out all his wallet-sized photos of his baby brother. He wanted to share photos too!

Hizashi knew he would just have to satisfy himself with the photos he had at home for now. He had already shown all of them to his husband, though it wasn’t as if Shouta fought that hard to not look at them. He knew that Shouta had a few photos of Mimizuku on his phone as well. It was so cute how hard he tried to say that he didn’t care. His actions betrayed him every single time.

If he had to be honest, Hizashi had never thought Shouta would have been able to get along with an animal that well. Well, minus cats. Mimizuku had always seemed rather taken with Shouta though, so that was something to keep in mind. From stealing knives to bringing him information on Trigger? It wouldn’t be a stretch to say that the owl saw Shouta as someone he cared for and trusted to an extent. And lo and behold, (and let it be known that it was not to his surprise), Shouta had come back home after that meeting with Nedzu all sparkles in his eyes because Mimizuku had, in his words, “labeled him a parental figure”.

Mimizuku clearly only had good intentions; Hizashi only wished that the owl was more open with them. He did have to admit that being more open was a difficult thing to do when one couldn’t use the human language to communicate. He knew that the owl was hiding something. Of how big it could be, he didn’t know. He just knew that it wasn’t something the bird trusted Shouta with yet. Hizashi hoped that it would be soon, but he knew better than most that trust was something that only came with time. Forcing Mimizuku on this issue would only serve to push the owl away, and.. Well.. Mimizuku was an owl. He could easily fly away and never come back. Owls were so good at stealth that it would be practically impossible to even track him down. And if he chose to continue to hide, it was as good as never seeing him again.

Kind of a scary thought, really.

Hizashi hoped it would never come to that.

There wasn’t much he could do but keep doing what he was doing and hope that Mimizuku would come to them when he was ready to do so. That was what family was for after all.

“Mimizuku,” He called as he finished wiping down the coffee table, “I found that picture frame I mentioned the other day.”

Hizashi watched as the owl blinked awake and yawned, beak clacking before directing his gaze over to him.

“Would you like to go see?”

‘Yes.’

Izuku had been starting to wonder if he should be worried.

It was very rare for Yamada-san to not be constantly talking to him even while he was working on other tasks. It was more common of him to be humming along to whatever music was on than just silence. It was weird, he had to admit. He had gotten used to Yamada-san’s ramblings, whether they be about hero work or the cute dogs he got to pet while at the supermarket. It wasn't like being with Aizawa-san. Aizawa-san didn't talk much about his hero work with him (though he did mention feeding stray cats a few times).

The best way to describe time spent with Aizawa-san would be quiet time. It could be him making a simple dinner, or reading reports on his laptop, or even just napping on the couch. It would mostly be quiet, Yamada-san’s radio show on low volume, only interrupted by the occasional grunt or chuckle. It was peaceful. During those times, Izuku even managed to drown out his ever-present worries, taking comfort from the pro hero being nearby.

The absence of the talking he had expected had actually made him drowse off, the rhythmic sounds of the duster swooshing over the shelves and smooth music lulling him into closing his eyes.

He didn't know how much time had passed, only that he had napped the rest of the time it took for Yamada-san to finish cleaning and to call out to him about seeing the picture frame.

Izuku was excited to see it! He chirped, eyes already looking up at the walls, hoping that perhaps Yamada-san had placed it there while he was napping.

“Silly ‘Zuku,” Izuku puffed up at hearing that name again. So he hadn’t been mishearing the other time? “Hmm? You don’t like that name?”

He clicked his beak and tapped out a ‘no.’ It was too close to ‘Izuku’ for comfort. Sure ‘Mimizuku’ was similar as well, but it was different enough for him to not be reminded of his old life.

“You’re such a weird bird,” Yamada-san hummed, kneeling and wiggling a finger in his direction. Izuku’s eyes zeroed in on the finger and he leaned forward to nibble at it, “Still cute though.”

He cooed as a finger reached to stroke the top of his head, allowing his eyelids to fall. Head pats were one of the absolute best things in his owl life. His minute distress about the nickname melted away and he shifted his head up a bit, nudging against the finger. Another coo. It was another reason why Izuku liked Yamada-san; telling how he felt about things was usually pretty easy. His memories of Hisashi were mostly of stone. His face never changing, his voice flat. He had only ever been playful with Mama.

Yamada-san was never afraid to say what he felt. Izuku wished he could be more like that. He used to be, he knew. But getting hit with Kacchan’s Explosion hurt and it made his Mama worry when she saw him hurt. Slowly, he stopped talking as much. Kacchan enjoyed talking over him anyways, so it wasn’t as if there was a difference in their interactions.

However, Yamada-san talked almost all the time! He wasn’t afraid of what people seemed to think, not like Izuku was.

If he weren’t so afraid, he would be able to tell them the truth. By now, he knew that both Aizawa-san and Yamada-san were good people, were good heroes. He wanted so badly to tell them, with his own voice who he actually was. But there was just that lingering fear of Hisashi hanging over everything he did. What if telling them only put them in danger?

However, Aizawa-san and Yamada-san were both pro heroes. He had to think about this logically. (Like how Aizawa-san would.) They were in danger every day when they did their pro hero jobs. And they both knew how to fight. Izuku had watched Eraserhead in action for so long and he knew that the hero was very capable. He had to be, if he wanted to be a successful hero. Yamada-san too. Izuku had still never watched Yamada-san work like he had Aizawa-san, but he was a hero too. And his quirk was so strong! And he was good at controlling it! Aizawa-san had assured him of that long before he had even introduced Yamada-san to him.

He was just so afraid.

What would happen afterwards?

Would they hate him for lying to them for so long?

Would they get mad that he had been taking advantage of their kindness?

He didn’t want Aizawa-san and Yamada-san angry with him.

Izuku knew he was a worrier (like his Mama had been).

Would the police come and take him away for lying to pro heroes?

That would be bad.

So bad.

He had changed his mind about two specific pro heroes, not the police!

What if they put him in jail?

Izuku really didn’t think he’d survive in jail!

“Hey, hey,” Yamada-san moved his finger down, sliding it to the tip of his beak and tapping it lightly once, interrupting his flow of inner thoughts, “What’s going on in that noggin of yours?”

Izuku only peeped back at him, turning his head away, instead choosing to stare at the wall.

“Still nothing, huh? Come on,” He could almost hear Yamada-san’s smile, “How about I show you that photo now?”

Peering over at him, Izuku bobbed his head, tapping out a quick ‘yes’ before Yamada-san could change his mind and continue asking him questions he still kind of didn’t want to answer.

Yamada-san pulled out a leather glove, slipping it onto his hand. It was nothing like Aizawa-san’s raptor glove. If he was correct, then that was the kind of glove that Yamada-san used as Present Mic.

“Up you get, Mimizuku,” He held out his fist, “Be gentle, okay?”

Izuku chirped, carefully hopping onto the proffered hand. Izuku knew he was actually very good at controlling the strength of his grip. It was the only reason why he had felt comfortable enough to stand on Aizawa-san’s forearm before he had even gotten that raptor glove. The memory of Aizawa-san telling him that his gripping force could break bones was a reminder that he always had to be careful where and how he stood.

When he had adjusted his footing to his liking, he peeped again. Yamada-san only grinned and quickly snapped a photo of the two of them before making his way to the entranceway of the apartment. It was an area that Izuku hadn’t seen yet. He had no need to enter the apartment using the front door, so it only made sense.

“And here it is!” Yamada-san announced, using his free hand to gesture at the frame that stood on the small cabinet next to the door.

It was a rectangular black frame. Decorating opposite corners were a simplified cat and bird. The photo in it was the one he remembered being taken the day he and Aizawa-san went to visit U.A.

"It's a good family photo, yeah?" Yamada-san grinned at him, "It's special 'cause it's the first one of all three of us in it, so I knew I wanted to use a one-of-a-kind frame for this baby."

Izuku felt conflicted again. This was concrete proof right in front of him that they saw him as family! Him! He wanted to cry. Or throw up. Or both.

He really was lying his way into their family.

And worst of all, he liked the warm feelings he got from being a part of their family.

"I don't know what you're thinking right now, Mimizuku," Yamada-san murmured, a finger stroking down his back, "I can't even pretend to be able to understand what kind of things go through your head, but doing work as a pro hero these last few years, I like to think I can recognize someone in distress by now."

"What you're distressed about, it's as good as anyone's guess really, but I can tell you that if it has to do with either me or Shouta or all of us as a family… Don't worry about it. Please. I mean, yeah, the two of us care about you and you're basically our bird kid that lives outdoors. We love you, plain and simple. And that's not changing anytime soon. We're family."

"If you're in some kind of trouble, you can always come to us," Yamada-san continued speaking, "Dunno what kind of troubles you could be having, but I’m sure Shou would come running for you if you ever needed his help.”

"Me too," He added on, like an afterthought, "Well, unless it's murder. I hope it's not murder. I'm pretty sure Shou knows how to hide a body though, so if it's somehow murder, you need to go to him and skip me. Plausible deniability."

"Anyways, back to the point," He cleared his throat, "You can depend on us, I promise. Through thick and thin, a family sticks together, yeah?"

Izuku didn't know how to reply to this. How was he supposed to reply to this?

Was it really alright to trust the two of them with his secret?

He wanted to.

If it was just the two of them and no one else, then it should be fine.

But not now. Not when Aizawa-san was still so busy working on the Trigger case.

Maybe after it was over?

Izuku chirped, reaching up to nuzzle Yamada-san’s cheek. A silent thank you for his words.

He would tell them soon.

He promised to himself.

Soon.

Notes:

    Shouta > He labeled me a parental figure.
    Hizashi > He called you Dad!
    Shouta > Parental Figure
    Hizashi > DAd!!
    Shouta >
    Shouta > whispers he called me dad :’)

    Izuku made a really big decision this chapter, I'm so proud of him ;v;

    Also, yes, Hizashi does have little wallet-sized photos of his bird son in his wallet as well. No one but him and Shouta have seen them so far though. He'll get to show them off one day!

    Haha, if Izuku managed to get jailed, he'd be a jailbird. *winks*

    This chapter was a lot of introspection and I thought it was about time that Hizashi got his own POV! I was honestly super excited for this chapter. It marks all the growth that Izuku's been leading up to!

Chapter Text

It was finally ending soon.

Tsukauchi seemed rather confident about that at least. Shouta was ready for this whole Trigger case to be over and hopefully done with. Until the next time it’d happen at least; these sorts of things always tended to surface up again in the future. But a break from having overpowered villains around sounded wonderful to him nonetheless.

The end of this case also meant the end of Mimizuku's informant job (hopefully), which would do wonders for his worries about owls on the opposing end of guns. He couldn't deny how helpful the information that had been passed on to him had been, but it didn't mean he had to like how he had gotten the information in the first place. It still rubbed him the wrong way that he had even asked Mimizuku to do this for him.

But, soon, this would end.

He would be able to go home to Hizashi and Mimizuku knowing that they would both be safe from further dealings involving Trigger in the near future.

Were these high hopes?

Yes, definitely.

But Shouta knew his skills were something he worked hard for to gain and to maintain. This wasn't something he was jumping feet first into.

He passed his eyes over the other pro heroes attending the briefing, all listening intently to Tsukauchi, who was leading this particular meeting. His own packet had already been looked over and reviewed; a hefty chunk of the information in it was what he had compiled in the first place, so unless they had some last minute tip come in, he knew that this was all they had.

The information they did have wasn't comprehensive, much to his and Tsukauchi's chagrin. It was why they had enlisted pro heroes from other prefectures that had previous experience combating against others who had taken Trigger. His own quirk, Erasure, was a shoo-in for this confrontation. He had checked his utility belt earlier that night, making sure he had his prescription eye drops with him. Tonight was going to be hell on his eyes.

What they did have was the element of surprise. The roster of pros here, the plan of attack, and this briefing? All put together and shared at the last minute. Tsukauchi, himself, was the only one to know anything else beforehand, preventing any sort of leak from being passed onto their current targets.

This case had gone on for too long for them to be hasty on their actions.

Tonight, they would be intercepting shipments of Trigger straight from the suppliers. They had no room for any missteps or shoddy work. Shouta knew he was as ready as he could be. He just hoped that everyone else was as well.

Izuku was at the docks again.

He had visited almost nightly ever since he had made up his mind about finally telling Aizawa-san and Yamada-san the truth. He had been too scared to go near the precinct, but the dock was where he had heard people talking about Trigger. Aizawa-san hadn’t mentioned anything about the case during the times he was home, preferring to nap instead if he could. Izuku knew that Aizawa-san was working very hard on the case, so he hadn’t tried to push him on information. It wasn’t as if there was a ‘Trigger’ or ‘drugs’ flashcard in the pack of flashcards that Aizawa-san had brought home the day after the visit to U.A. either.

Izuku just wanted to make sure Aizawa-san was okay.

The harder that Aizawa-san worked, the more worried he got. Was it healthy to work this much? When Izuku still had his Mama, she insisted that he sleep at least nine or even ten hours every night! Somehow, he didn’t think Aizawa-san was getting even close to that much sleep. Adults really were something else to be able to go through the day with that little sleep. Izuku knew that he slept a lot even now. He would sleep as the sun rose until the sun set. It wasn’t as if he had daycare anymore.

(Every so often, he’d get the urge to visit his daycare to find Kacchan.)

(Would Kacchan even care if he had a quirk now?)

(Did Kacchan even miss him?)

(Would Kacchan even have let him play with him again?)

(Would Kacchan still hit and burn him even when had a quirk?)

It was fine.

Izuku wasn’t sure he wanted to be friends with Kacchan anymore anyways.

After not seeing him for so long, Izuku found that he didn’t really miss having to put bandaids on every afternoon. He didn’t exactly have the hands and fingers for that either, but that wasn’t the point! Being an owl kept him the least hurt he had been ever since starting daycare!

He did hope the kids that Kacchan were usually mean to weren’t getting hurt still.

Maybe Kacchan had started being nicer to the other kids because he wasn’t there anymore?

He didn’t know, but he didn’t really want to find out either.

Because what if that was true?

Then that would mean he just hated him. Just Izuku. Just Deku. And everyone had gotten hurt because Kacchan just hated him that much.

It would be best if Izuku just stayed away.

It would be fine.

Izuku had Aizawa-san and Yamada-san now. A whole new family just for him. And they didn’t even live close to Kacchan’s house! So there was no way that they would ever meet each other too!

Izuku wondered what would happen after he told them about himself.

How would he even tell them?

He would probably need to use Aizawa-san’s laptop. ‘Izuku’ was something he still knew how to write. Type? Was that similar enough? He also had his backpack and though he hadn’t exactly looked at the contents in a while, he was sure his name was in his hero notebook. And it was definitely in the copy of his family registry that he had. That would be more than enough.

He still didn’t know how to change back into human Izuku though. Could he even change back? Maybe he really was stuck as an owl now?

While Izuku knew he liked being an owl, (how could he not when he could fly?), he also knew that being an owl stopped him from doing a lot of things.

First of all, owls had no hands or fingers. Izuku missed writing in his notebook. He could have written so many things about Aizawa-san’s quirk or Yamada-san’s Voice by now! (He had actually tried holding pencils with his talons and all he did was manage to snap the pencils in half.) Also, he wanted to hug Aizawa-san. And Yamada-san. Mama always did say he gave the best hugs. So he wanted to give them the best hugs ever.

Second of all, owls couldn’t go to daycare or school. Izuku liked learning and he had enjoyed daycare for the most part. He may not have been too sure how much time had passed since his last time going to his daycare, but it was definitely a lot of months! The rest of the kids probably knew a lot more than he did now. Izuku had even fished out newspapers that had flown into trees to try to learn by himself and he could barely read any of it!

And thirdly, but definitely not lastly, owls couldn’t speak like people could. Izuku had so many things he wanted to ask and to say! He wanted to tell Aizawa-san and Yamada-san that their quirks were so cool! He wanted to ask them questions about being heroes! He wanted to thank them properly for letting him enter their lives and not just with gifts of erasers or nuzzles to the face. He wanted to tell them about himself. He wanted to ask them if they really meant what they said. He wanted to know if they would really care about Izuku the human like they did Mimizuku the owl.

Izuku was tucked in the shadows just watching the docks and wondering in silence how his life would change after Aizawa-san and Yamada-san knew the truth. He kept his ears open, already knowing that there was a lot more movement in the area tonight compared to any other night he had spent here, and he wondered if tonight was the night.

Was Eraserhead going to catch the people giving out drugs this very night?

Well, he knew Eraserhead was out there already; his scarf was easy to spot even from where he was perched. But there was more than just him. He didn't recognize any of the other people that arrived with him though. Were they also heroes?

Izuku perked up. It had been a long time since he had seen other heroes besides Eraserhead in action. He wondered what sort of quirks they had.

Did any of their quirks help them be sneaky? They were pretty good at being sneaky. Izuku thought they were definitely quieter than rats looking for food in dumpsters. And much much more better at sneaking around than pigeons.

Izuku watched as they continued further along the dock, reaching the warehouses. The cars that they had arrived in didn't move, staying where they had dropped the heroes off. There were still people in the cars though. Izuku could see a man in a hat sitting in the driver's seat. He could also see his mouth moving, talking into something. Izuku switched his attention to the other person in that car, his instincts already making him puff up slightly.

It was a cat.

Izuku squinted. That had to be a quirk. He tamped down his instinct to immediately fly away or to hoot to proclaim his hold on this territory. It was a mutant type quirk, right? Maybe it was a quirk like Nedzu-san’s? Or was it just a human with a cat mutant quirk? Izuku knew cats could see in the dark, but could the cat-human see him? Izuku did his best to not tangle with cats. He liked cats back when he was human and he knew firsthand how vicious they could get if they felt they were threatened.

He sidled further away. The urge to just screech was high, but Izuku also knew that Eraserhead was on a hero mission right now. He had to be quiet. There were too many people around for Izuku to freely do what he wanted anyways. He supposed it did make sense.

Eraserhead was a really good hero, but if they had to fight a lot of people, it would be a lot harder for him to do what he usually did. Izuku knew this very well. It was the same reason why he only ever targeted lone pigeons after all. When you could go one on one, it was easier to catch them by surprise. But with more than one, it became more difficult. Not only was it louder, but they could warn others of his approaching. There was a park that he couldn’t even hunt in anymore because all the pigeons stopped roosting there at night after he had foolishly tried to pick one off when there were several more nearby. It was a mistake he never made again.

Izuku directed his attention back to the warehouses. He could hear sounds of fighting now. He couldn’t distinguish any words that were being said but there was a lot of yelling. Honestly, it was hard to tell what was happening since most of it seemed to be happening inside the warehouse. He swiveled his head to look back at the cars, checking if anyone was looking in his direction. When he had confirmed that both were busy and focused on something else, he jumped, flapping his way onto a higher perch.

There weren’t many tall buildings in this area, but Izuku just wanted someplace higher than where he was before and also behind the cars. Unless the hat-man or cat-human left their car or could somehow see through it, they wouldn’t be able to spot him.

By the time he had settled on his new perch, the noises had already died down, barely even audible over the crash of the waves.

Was it all over already?

He hoped it was.

The sudden sound of doors being opened and slammed shut made him turn his head in the car’s direction, startling him. What was going on now? Big green eyes studied the two men as they left where the cars were and walked towards the warehouses.

The cat-human was part of the police! That uniform couldn't be mistaken for anything else. Did that mean the hat-man was as well? He wasn't wearing the same thing but maybe he was in disguise? It would be good to avoid both of them just in case. For now, he’d just watch them carefully. There was no need for them to know about him. It would be best if they didn't even suspect he was there.

Izuku forced himself to stop staring at them, instead focusing his attention back at the warehouse again. He perked up when he saw the telltale pale coloring of Eraserhead's scarf. He was leading a bunch of wrapped up people out of the building. The other heroes were doing the same. A few were carrying cases. Izuku wondered if those were the drugs. If it was, well, that was a lot of drugs.

From what Izuku could see none of them seemed too hurt either. They were still able to walk out after all, and they didn't even call an ambulance. He was sure he would have heard one by now if they did.

(He always avoided ambulances. The police and ambulance people seemed to appear together a lot of the time. Luckily for him, they were also very loud, so he was always able to avoid them when they were around.)

This was good.

Izuku was tempted to leave now while everyone else was distracted by all the drugs and bad people, but this was the first time he had seen so many heroes in one place. It wouldn't hurt for him to stay just a bit longer. Just until they all left, and then he could go home.

He wanted to follow Eraserhead home, but he had the feeling that after finishing this mission, the pro hero would have to go back to the precinct again to sign papers or something. Aizawa-san complained about paperwork at home sometimes and Izuku did not envy him. It sounded very boring.

Sitting there, Izuku continued observing the policemen and heroes. They were all very efficient, the owl had to admit. He had counted nine bad guys there and all of them were in cuffs already. Izuku turned to look at the empty police cars. He didn't know how they were going to fit that many people in there without someone getting squished. Were they going to have to get more police cars? That would mean more police then and while that was good for them, it wasn’t really for Izuku. The last thing he needed were more opportunities for the police to see him.

It was a good thing that he was very good at staying still for long periods of time. He might be very quiet when he did fly, but anyone with eyes would be able to see him in the sky, especially on a clear night like tonight. (Considering one of the pro heroes there had four visible eyes? He was being cautious.)

At least the moon was out, Izuku mused. It provided more than enough light for him to see almost anything he wanted even from the distance he was at from all the people. Eraserhead separated from the rest of the group, saying something about checking the pe-ri-me-ter. Izuku wasn’t sure what that was, but it had to be important if he had to go check it, right?

It was the moonlight that helped him catch sight of movement on the rooftop of one of the warehouses. Izuku watched quietly as the person (it was person-shaped, at least) made their way to the edge, fishing out something from inside their jacket before aiming at Eraserhead. The dull glint of metal was harder to spot, but by then, Izuku had already pushed off his perch.

He couldn’t let it end like this.

The mission had gone smoothly, much to Shouta’s grim satisfaction.

There had been a few injuries but there hadn’t been any casualties. They had even managed to grab all the suppliers and dealers that had been on location. While Tsukauchi and Tamakawa put them in suppressant cuffs, he parted with them temporarily letting them know he was going for a perimeter check to see if they missed anything. They had only hit the one warehouse after all and there were quite a number of others in the vicinity.

His footfalls echoed in the empty ways between the stout buildings. Traveling by roof would have been better, but with the material that they were made of? He’d be announcing where he was every single time he landed after making a jump. This whole area was not great for his general mobility. It was far too spaced out, making it nigh impossible to maneuver between buildings with his capture weapon.

Shouta checked building after building, getting splashed occasionally by the waves. For something that counted as a pillar of underground crime, this had been far too clean-cut and easy. There was no way. They had to be missing something. Something important.

Honestly, he ought to be thankful that this mission didn’t get turned over it’s head, but his gut certainly didn’t agree. He had a bad feeling about this and he knew it would only get worse if he left the situation untouched.

Keeping his guard up, he stalked his way around the immediate area, determined to suss out anything or anyone out of place.

It was then that he heard it. A faint click.

Shouta spun around, pinpointing where the sound had come from, eyes already flaring red with Erasure. With one fluid movement of his arm, his capture weapon had been flung out, snaking around a limb. He yanked down, pressing his body weight into it, attempting to unbalance the person. He really didn’t want to take any chances with a gun at play.

And then something dark slammed into the gunman.

It happened all at once.

Shouta looked at Mimizuku.

Mimizuku looked at him.

A gun shot rang out.

Shouta sprinted.

Izuku fell.

Notes:

    Tsukauchi + Tamakawa > exists
    Izuku > Oh. Oh no.
    Izuku > Don’t like that.

    Oh! Ohohoho! Well. Izuku is not having a good night. Shouta can concur. But at least they have the Trigger now? :D Izuku really was looking forward to a 'nice' reveal and this is definitely not what he wanted. Poor kid.

    Izuku!! He just really cares for Aizawa’s safety ;o; Hero brain has never been turned off, just put to the side xD

    Shouta now knows! It's the start of the reveal! \o/ It's here!

Chapter Text

Izuku hadn't been thinking.

The gun had gone off.

And now he was falling.

He felt numb. Sound was lost and everything was blurry to his eyes with the wind rushing past him.

Where were his wings?

What had happened to him?

Was Eraserhead okay?

He clenched his eyes shut.

Where were his wings?

Despite knowing that he was falling, it felt like it was taking forever for him to hit the ground.

He didn’t want to look.

And then he felt someone grab a hold of him, clutching at him tightly, an arm cushioning the back of his head.

They crashed into the ground, even rolling a couple of times before coming to a stop.

Izuku didn’t realize he was holding his breath until he gasped out for air, his fingers desperately grasping at the fabric of the shirt his face was pressed into. He was shaking, he realized.

“Mimizuku?”

He looked up at the concerned face of Aizawa-san. His eyebrows were creased, a small look of confusion just barely visible in his eyes.

“Ai… Aizawa-san..” It took everything he had to not burst out in tears. It was too much. He had nearly smashed his head into the ground and now Aizawa-san knew it was him. How could this go so wrong? He had wanted to tell them. But not like this, “’m so sorry! I wanted to tell you.. I was going to tell you..”

He started to sniffle, burying his face back into Aizawa-san’s chest. He didn’t want to see how mad Aizawa-san would be, how angry he would be, about Izuku lying to him for so long. However, he didn’t hear yelling (not that Aizawa-san really yelled in general). Instead he felt firm hands sit him up, then patting at his head, shoulders, and back.

“Are you hurt?” There was a touch of frenetic energy in his voice, something Izuku rarely heard.

It wasn’t anger.

Was it worry?

For him?

"I'm okay," He managed to mumble, face still smooshed in an attempt to hide. He felt bad that he was essentially using Aizawa-san’s hero uniform as a big tissue, but he really didn't think he could look the pro in the face at the moment, "It didn't hit me."

While Izuku couldn't see the relief on Aizawa-san’s face, he could feel the tense form of his body loosening up just a bit, a hand stroking down his back before landing back on the top of his head, fingers lightly tangled in his curls. Against his will, Izuku began to relax, curling up against the hero's warmth, his face finally not trying to actively disappear into the void of Aizawa-san’s black shirt.

"Mimizuku," Aizawa-san began, and Izuku shook his head. His voice was still muffled, but nonetheless, he corrected him.

"Izuku."

Aizawa-san paused, nodding and then tried to meet his eyes.

"Are you safe, Izuku?"

Izuku froze for a second before quickly breaking off the attempted eye contact. Memories of Hisashi came to mind, of small spurts of fire and smoke dripping out a fanged scowl. Of finding out his Mama had died a fiery death. Of that gut feeling that made him want to avoid that man as much as possible.

“Izuku?”

He shook his head. He wasn’t safe.

How could he be safe?

He could feel Aizawa-san’s grip on him tighten. And despite knowing that Hisashi was still out there possibly looking for him, (if he didn’t already think he was dead at least), he still felt comforted in the arms he was in.

He wasn’t safe, but Aizawa-san made him feel safe and for now, that was what really mattered. He was still confused about why the hero wasn’t angry with him, but that was a good thing, wasn’t it? Izuku had never liked angering people. Had never liked seeing the spark of hatred in their eyes.

“Do you hate me now?” He asked, voice trembling and small.

It really was weird to hear his own voice after not even using it for so long, but he did his best to keep talking.

This was something he needed to know, after all.

“I lied to you and Yamada-san for so long and now that you know who-”

Step

Izuku looked up, interrupting his own babbling, eyes searching for what made the sound he had just heard. Aizawa-san looked confused, one arm now draping itself over his shoulders, pulling him close, while the other was on his capture scarf.

The hat-man was approaching them. Izuku had to blink a few times to see him properly with how dark it was.

“Izuku?”

Aizawa-san was also looking in the same direction, his mouth dropping into a frown.

"Eraser? That you?" The hat-man spoke, getting closer, his own eyes squinting, a hand in his jacket, "We heard a gunshot."

"Yeah, it's me," Aizawa-san spoke, shoulders lowering and grip loosening on his scarf, "Could you get that guy over there? I think he's knocked his head against the ground. He was the source of the gunshot."

"Sure thing," The hat-man made his way to the gunman, taking out a pair of handcuffs from his belt and quickly cuffed him, "I'll have Sansa come by to take him away."

While they spoke, Aizawa-san stood up, helping him up as well. It was an odd feeling, standing on human legs again. He didn't have any shoes. He supposed they might still be back in that alleyway. He still had his shorts though, and whatever fabric was left of his shirt that only hung loosely around his neck. Did they transform with him when he used his quirk? That was helpful since he didn't have to worry about being naked if his quirk stopped working.

That had to be what Aizawa-san’s quirk was. He had gotten it wrong apparently. He hadn't ever been afraid of Aizawa-san, so it couldn't be fear that made him stop using his quirk. He didn't even really know how to use his quirk. It didn't take any actual effort to stay as an owl when he had already been an owl.

“Is that a kid?” Izuku shrunk back slightly at the attention now directed to him, “Hey there, where did you come from?”

He clutched to Aizawa-san’s sleeve, trying his best to convey that he didn’t want to answer any of the hat-man’s questions. He had told himself before. Only Aizawa-san. Only Yamada-san.

Izuku knew he would have to depend on Aizawa-san right now to protect him. The hat-man undoubtedly worked with the cat-human policeman.

He wasn’t safe here.

Another movement caught his eye even as he continued to ignore the adults talking over him in whispers. Izuku supposed that Aizawa-san didn't want him to overhear whatever they were talking about, but he wasn't that interested in what they were talking about right now, especially since he would much rather keep his eyes on whoever was coming closer.

Another slight movement.

Izuku squinted.

Ah. It was the cat-human policeman.

Izuku had to stop himself from trying to take steps back. The only thing stopping him from running to hide behind a warehouse was Aizawa-san’s presence. He had a feeling that if he separated from the pro hero right now when the other two were still there… It just wasn't a good idea. It couldn't be.

And then something exploded.

Multiple things happened after that split second.

The side of a warehouse blew out, flaring bright yellow and orange-red, a wave of heat distorting the air visible to the eye.

Aizawa-san shoved him behind his own body, standing tall and firm, covering him from any bits of wall that came their way.

The hat-man started to bark orders and the cat-human policeman seemed to be at the ready. For what, he didn't know.

Izuku though.

Izuku saw fire.

Logically, Izuku knew he hadn’t witnessed his Mama’s death. Knew he hadn’t seen the fire that had taken her life. Known he hadn’t smelled harsh smoke that would sting his eyes.

But all the same, Izuku knew.

And that was enough.

His breath hitched and unwittingly he let go of the sleeve he had been clinging to, taking a step back. And then another.

He couldn’t breathe.

More steps. Quicker this time.

He couldn’t breathe.

Everything was on fire.

He couldn’t hear anything. It was weird. He had gotten so used to being able to hear even the slightest sound from over a street block away.

Aizawa-san had turned towards him, eyes wild and mouth in motion.

Izuku could only watch.

Was he saying something?

It was like static. Like when you sometimes turned the television on and it wasn’t connecting that well to channels.

Except it was in his head.

He could only stare blankly at the man.

Another explosion.

The air grew even thicker.

It was hot.

Aizawa-san looked mad, turning his head away to yell something at the hat-man before rushing forward.

Izuku was frozen.

Everything looked like a blur to him. The collapsing warehouses, the bright flames, the night sky.

It was all on fire.

Unwittingly, Hisashi came to mind.

It all went downhill from there.

Izuku couldn’t stop thinking about it. About Hisashi. About Dragon's Breath. About Mama’s death.

He couldn’t do this.

What if Hisashi was here?

What if he had found out about Izuku?

What if he was coming after Aizawa-san now?

He couldn’t do this.

Izuku took yet another step back.

Aizawa-san looked so far away now.

A small touch to his shoulder jerked his attention away from the blurry image of the pro hero.

It was the hat-man. He was saying something, but Izuku still heard nothing but static.

He bent down, a look of worry on his face, and before Izuku knew it, he was picked up. The hat-man called something behind him as he hurried away with him in tow.

All Izuku knew was that he could no longer see Aizawa-san.

That Aizawa-san had disappeared into the fire.

And that this man was taking him away.

Before he could dwell on that, another explosion rocked the pier.

Izuku couldn’t do this.

As another wave of ash and smoke came at them, debris getting flung in their path, Izuku tried to push himself out of the hat-man’s hold with no success.

Frustration bubbled under his skin.

Why couldn’t he do this?

He dug his nails into the large coat that the hat-man was wearing, wishing that he had his talons. Without thinking, he leaned forward, biting into the coat. His human teeth didn’t really affect the thick material, but it seemed to surprise the man enough that his grip loosened.

Izuku kicked out against him, managing to break loose, clumsily landing on his feet, ignoring whatever he stepped onto.

He ran.

The hat-man ran after him.

Izuku could finally hear.

His footfalls and the hat-man’s voice.

The crackle and pop of the flames surrounding them.

His own heartbeat.

Everything was loud again.

Izuku turned, catching the movement of an arm from the corner of his eye.

He had to get away.

Izuku jumped, panic overtaking his thoughts.

He couldn’t get caught.

In an instant, he was in the air.

He flew.

Strong wingbeats took him quickly out of the hat-man’s range, his voice calling after him, the intense heat of the area providing him ease in gaining height.

He couldn’t do this.

So, Izuku did what he did best.

He hid.

Shouta had known the night was going to shit.

But, he had really underestimated how fucking shit it could go.

It had been over an hour since the appropriate personnel had arrived in their bright red trucks and hoses. They had even brought Backdraft along since he was on call tonight.

It had been over an hour since he had regrouped with Tsukauchi, who had no Izuku with him.

It had been over an hour since he had even found out that Mimizuku was apparently a kid. One whole child.

He refused to let himself drown in those thoughts for now, knowing that he was still on duty.

It really was a stroke of luck that the warehouses didn’t seem to have people in them, no lives being lost in this mess of a mission. The other pros had been able to get back to the cars with the Trigger intact so there was that at least. Tamakawa had even managed to round up the arrested beforehand so none of the suppliers had managed to escape with the massive distraction that had been explosions.

Tsukauchi came out fine as well, the only loss being his hat which he had been told was blown away by the buffeting winds caused by one of the explosions.

Even he had only gotten superficial injuries, the most serious being some minor smoke inhalation which he had already gotten treatment for.

Frankly, it could have gone a lot worse.

They were lucky they had been able to capture the suppliers and secure the Trigger so quickly and move them out. If they had been a couple of minutes slower, those explosions would have undoubtedly done a lot more damage.

Shouta lurked in the back of the room as the debriefing went on. Tsukauchi looked tired as well, the mug of coffee in front of him already half empty. He knew that the detective was going to get next to no sleep tonight. Shouta couldn’t find it in himself to feel that bad for him. Perhaps it was just pettiness, but when he had found out that Tsukauchi had lost Izuku… Had lost Mimizuku...

The smoulder that had been his rage had almost erupted full force.

He had pushed it aside, but even now, he could remember those familiar green eyes. Of course he hadn’t expected them to be in a child’s face, but he couldn’t not recognize those eyes. Even if he hadn’t watched Mimizuku fall into Izuku due to Erasure, there was no way he wouldn’t have recognized those eyes.

And what a shock that had been.

Hizashi had brought the possibility up before, so it wasn’t entirely something he hadn’t at least contemplated for a moment once, but the way his heartbeat had rang in his ears had spurred him into action despite his initial surprise and horror.

The next thing he registered in his mind was how small Izuku was. In his arms, Izuku was small and Shouta knew, had the bullet hit, Izuku could have very well been bleeding out instead of just crying into him.

He had never been so thankful that a gun had missed its mark.

And then Izuku had been so afraid.

What had he been so afraid of? Was it really just hiding that he was a kid to him and Hizashi? Was it something more complicated? And Izuku’s own admittance that he wasn’t safe. What could have happened to that kid to put that kind of look on his face?

“Eraserhead,” Tsukauchi called out to him as he came up to him after finishing up the debriefing and dismissing everyone else, “I have questions.”

Watching the other pros leave without a visible worry, Shouta could only sigh as he missed his chance of dodging Tsukauchi’s inquisitive nature. He should have expected the man to corner him after that whole debacle that had happened.

“Just telling you now that I can’t answer them all.” There was no doubt that Tsukauchi would want answers to things even he didn’t know. It was better to make certain his position on this particular matter.

“The kid,” Tsukauchi continued as soon as the room was finally emptied out, “He seemed very attached to you.”

“That’s not a question,” Shouta deflected.

“Eraser, I’m going to be blunt here,” He narrowed his eyes as a frown pulled on his lips, “Is that kid involved in the Trigger case?”

“What,” His mouth dropped open, “No.”

“Lie.”

“...” Fuck Tsukauchi’s quirk, “Fine, but we’re going to your office. You need to keep this to yourself. I don’t know the whole story either.”

At the other’s nod, they left the debriefing room, Tsukauchi only going to retrieve his now empty coffee mug before closing the door behind them. It was a short distance to his office, but all Shouta wanted to do was to go home. After everything that had happened tonight, he just wanted some fucking sleep. He knew that he wasn’t going to be getting what he wanted though. Mimizuku, no, Izuku. He was still out there.

Was it too much to hope that Izuku would just show up at his apartment later?

“Well?” Tsukauchi interrupted his thoughts as he fiddled with buttons on the coffee machine he had in his office, “I’m listening.”

“He’s Mimizuku,” Shouta went for the most relevant piece of information he had regarding the Trigger case, “The informant who passed me the tips.”

And didn’t that make him sick to his stomach now. He had asked a literal child to spy on drug dealers for him. Had allowed a child to accompany him on his patrols. Had confiscated a ridiculous amount of knives from the same child.

A child.

"That was a kid, Eraser," Tsukauchi raised an eyebrow as if he didn't just state the obvious, "You're going to have to give me more than that."

"I only knew him as an owl for months," Shouta wearily shook his head, "I only found out he was a kid tonight. I didn't know."

"You're telling me this owl visited you for months and you didn't realize he was a human kid?"

"I'm telling you he visited me for months as an owl and as far as I could tell, lived as an owl," Shouta had to stop himself raising his voice, "I've watched him catch rats and pigeons for dinner. I've watched him eat the rats, Tsukauchi."

"Even before we met, he spent months just living his life in the city doing his own thing," Shouta couldn't stop himself, the words tumbling out of his mouth, "I'm not talking late evening times. I'm talking two, three, even four in the morning."

"For all intent and purposes, he led a perfect owl life," He gritted his teeth before continuing, "So yes, I thought he was just an animal with an intelligence quirk."

Tsukauchi was silent before heaving out a sigh, hand massaging the bridge of his nose.

"I guess I can see where you're coming from. So, what can you tell me about him?"

"His name is Izuku," Shouta crossed his arms, tapping an impatient finger against a bicep, "He has a transformation quirk that he can use to be an owl. And he told me he wasn’t safe."

And honestly, that was all the hard facts he could readily share. Everything else was pure speculation based on previous observations. He didn't even know how old he was. Under ten for sure, but older than four. Quirk manifestations tended to happen at or after the age of four, so that was an easy benchmark.

“He might have had a bad experience with fire.” It wasn’t something he knew for certain, but it was hard to mistake that kind of look on someone’s face. What could have happened? He had looked like his entire world was crumbling just at the sight of the licking flames. He had stopped responding to him, had fled from Tsukauchi even. From an objective standpoint, the detective wasn’t exactly fear material. His plain looks lent to his profession well actually.

“I’ll go through the quirk registry and some records,” Tsukauchi sighed again, making his way over to his desk, his mug finally refilled with coffee, “I’ll contact you if I get any hits. I’ll also keep him out of the official report, for now.”

Shouta could feel something settle inside him. Was it relief? Having Tsukauchi on his side in this was only logical. They could do this.

Shouta was a pro hero.

Saving people was what he did for a living.

He wanted to save Mimizuku. To save Izuku.

Nodding his thanks, he left Tsukauchi’s office and with a nod to Tamakawa who was manning the front desk, left the precinct.

Shouta made a beeline home.

He knew Hizashi was going to get back late tonight, so he couldn’t ask his husband to check for him, but he hoped that he was going to find Mimizuku, find Izuku, back at the apartment.

He arrived home to an empty apartment.


No owl appeared on his balcony that night.

Notes:

    Izuku > I came out to have a good time
    Izuku > points at fire, trauma, and Tsukauchi + Tamakawa
    Izuku > >:(

    No Tsukauchis were harmed in the writing of this chapter; also he got no hazard pay for the attempted chomp from Izuku xD aaand rip Tsukauchi’s hat

    Izuku gets his hug!! There was a hug! :D eagerly gesturing at the hug! And I didn’t get him shot! :DD

    Also, if anyone knows the right tag for whatever Izuku's quirk is, please tell me xD I got a suggestion from a comment to add a ‘Izuku is a bird’ or ‘Bird Izuku’ type of tag, but I think they’re both unofficial tags? Should I just add that? I have no idea. If you know, feel free to drop it in the comments <3 Also I added the Hizashi & Izuku tag into this, finally, because I remembered.

    Thanks for reading! Please let me know your thoughts! :D

    Next chapter comes out June 26th! Hizashi and Shouta have a long talk over breakfast.

Chapter Text

Shouta was tired.

He had spent the entire early morning in a daze, nodding off every couple of minutes, only to shake himself awake to shoot a glance out at the balcony.

Hizashi had not been pleased with him when he had gotten home, immediately shoving him into bed, telling him that he was going to refuse to listen to anything he said until he had gotten some rest.

He fell asleep, much to his chagrin. His last coherent thought was a small hope that if Mimizuku came by as he slept, that he would wait for him to wake up.

His dreams that night were full of teary green eyes pleading with him to save him. Of gunshots and not being able to catch the falling boy in time. Of Mimizuku speaking with Izuku’s voice and asking him why he didn't save him.

He had startled awake when he heard a loud clang, feet swinging out of the empty bed and rushing into the kitchen area. Hizashi looked up at him apologetically from the floor, the chopping board he had apparently dropped already back in hand. Shouta felt his heart rate slow down again.

What a way to start the day.

He stumbled his way into the bathroom to clean himself up, knowing he had forgotten to do that last night. He’d have to have the blankets and sheets cleaned as well. He really must have looked horrible if Hizashi had insisted he sleep in the bed last night despite still smelling so heavily of smoke.

After a long shower and brushing his teeth, he changed into one of Hizashi’s large hoodies and a pair of sweatpants. Being a Spotlight Hero, the blond had recently signed off on the creation of multiple pieces of merchandise. This hoodie had been a prototype that he had been allowed to keep, much to Shouta’s delight. He didn’t like the idea of signing off on merchandise deals, being an Underground Hero and all that, but he did like how comfortable this hoodie was.

Inexplicably, the thought of Izuku in one of these large hoodies came to mind and Shouta immediately felt his mood plummet. It had been dark, but the moon had been bright enough for him to see enough details to corroborate his theories.

He wanted to go out and find him right now, but that simply was not logical. It was still morning. Mimizuku was probably sleeping and would probably stay asleep until the early evening, when the sun was just about to fully set.

It would be impossible to find a sleeping owl in the city. Flat out impossible. He didn't even know the general area of where Mimizuku set up his roost.

"Shou?" Hizashi called out as he washed some baby spinach, a peeled onion and a pile of mushrooms already on the chopping board, "Could you slice up the baguette and pop it into the oven for me?"

He grunted his assent, pulling out the bread knife when he arrived at the kitchen. The baguette was the last of the batch that Hizashi had purchased the other day at the farmers' market. The blond enjoyed visiting those when they were open, frequently touting the various reasons why they should support the farmers and buy their produce.

Slicing up the baguette into uniform pieces was a simple thing. He then pulled out the olive oil, drizzling it over the slices after he had placed them on the baking tray. Thankfully, Hizashi had already preheated the oven so he didn't have to wait to put them in to toast.

"The onion and mushrooms too, please," Hizashi passed him a different knife, taking the bread knife from him and setting it aside. Shouta only nodded, taking the chopping board with the ingredients and started on his task.

He did his best to keep his mind focused on dicing the onion, but he knew that Hizashi had probably already noticed something was wrong. The blond had always been attuned to his moods, able to identify them with just a look. Shouta knew that keeping things from his husband was useless, not that he did. They rarely keep secrets from each other, finding that the truth was generally the best way to go.

"He's a kid," He spoke up before Hizashi could attempt to prod answers out of him, "During the mission last night, Mimizuku saved me from getting shot and I used Erasure on him."

He watched Hizashi’s eyebrows jerk up before a contemplative expression overtook his features.

"That itself wouldn't have caused you this much grief though," He pointed out, pulling out eggs from the refrigerator, "What else happened?"

"The mission went sideways and he flew away."

The 'Away from me' went unspoken, but Shouta knew that Hizashi likely had picked it up anyways.

The blond shot a look out the balcony before pulling out a clean bowl to crack the eggs in.

"And he didn't stop by last night?"

"And he didn't stop by last night."

"Do you know why he flew away?" Hizashi asked as started to whisk the eggs with a pair of chopsticks.

Shouta paused as he remembered those fear filled eyes, his knife stopping in motion before hitting the wood with a sharp thunk.

"He was scared, Hizashi," Admitting it gave him a bad taste in his mouth, "He was so scared."

"He was in tears, telling me that he was sorry, that he was going to tell us that he wasn't really an owl. He didn't even want to look at me. Just cried on me a bunch."

Shouta had to stop to take a breath. This really was getting to him and by the look on Hizashi’s face, he knew it as well. He couldn’t help it. Now that he knew that Mimizuku and Izuku were one and the same, things changed. There were some things that could have been waived aside on the accounts that this was a wild animal (despite the obvious above average intelligence) that just couldn’t be anymore.

What was he supposed to do now that he had all of this new information? His mind was racing, connecting all the previous hints of peculiar behavior that now made so much more sense.

"Shou," Hizashi hummed as he added in a pinch each of salt and pepper into his bowl, "Mushrooms please."

Shouta blinked, staring down at the mushrooms that he hadn't even started to slice. Today was going to be one of those days. Picking up the knife again, he started slicing as his husband started heating up the skillet to wilt down the spinach.

He kept his focus on the knife and the rhythmic up-down motion. Hizashi’s sense for interrupting his thoughts when they went spiraling was as good as ever.

"There were explosives," He eventually continued as he finished with his portion of the ingredients, sliding the chopping board over, "He wanted to run, I know that. I asked Tsukauchi to take him to safety, but I fucked up. Tsukauchi lost him. He managed to fly away using his quirk."

"It isn't your fault, you know," Hizashi started, holding up a finger threateningly when his mouth opened to interrupt because what was he talking about, of course it was his fault, "Let me finish, Shouta."

He grumbled, but nodded.

"It isn't your fault," He repeated, as if repetition would forcibly drill that phrase into his head, "You said he was scared. Scared kids don't act rationally. You don't know any of the reasoning behind any of his actions right now. "

Shouta worried at his bottom lip, but he couldn't deny anything that was being said. And it was true that Hizashi knew how kids generally functioned a lot better than he did.

"Plus, now you know he's a kid. We both know. Just because you couldn't help him before, doesn't mean you can't now."

Hizashi nodded to himself as the spinach wilted, emptying out the skillet into an empty bowl, then refilling the still-hot pan with the diced onions and mushrooms so they could cook.

"And he trusts you, thinks of you like a dad," Shouta flicked his gaze to the box of flashcards on the coffee table, remembering their visit to U.A., "For a kid, I don't think there's a higher honor than that."

"It was Mimizuku who thought that though," Shouta insisted, the tips of his ears tinged with red, "We don't know if Izuku thinks the same."

Shouta didn't want to admit that he hoped that Izuku did. Didn't want to face the possibility that the cheeky owl that he had grown so fond of didn't see him as a trusted parental figure.

"Izuku is his name?" Despite the asked question and his answering nod, Hizashi didn't seem that surprised, "I honestly should have expected something like that. 'Zuku and Izuku sound plenty alike."

"'Zuku?"

"Remember that afternoon when I took out our photo album? I called him 'Zuku, 'cause Mimizuku is so long, ya know, and he started pulling at my sleeve. Totally wigged out. And the other night, one of those nights you were at the precinct I think, I called him that again and he completely puffed up and told me he didn’t like that name."

Shouta supposed it was just another puzzle piece that they could fit into the jigsaw of haphazardly placed clues that was Izuku.

"It's kinda creepy how you got so close to his name actually," Hizashi chuckled as he poured out the now cooked onions and mushrooms into yet another bowl, "Also kinda funny."

"Regardless of that, Mimizuku and Izuku are one and the same. His actions and his feelings both." Half of the whisked eggs were poured into the sizzling skillet, the knob of butter placed already melting into foam. Hizashi’s eyes were focused on the pan, his wrist tilting it to make sure the eggs were evenly spread.

"Besides the obvious hiding the fact that he was an actual human child, I don't think he really hid much of anything else about himself."

Hizashi separated the cooked vegetables into two portions as he hummed the jingle to his radio show under his breath. Shouta leaned over to grab two clean plates from the dish cabinet, knowing that the blond would have asked him to do it later anyways. He also grabbed them each a fork and knife. Having an omelet with chopsticks always made Hizashi pout, claiming that his ‘western’ sensibilities were being played with. (Shouta knew that was nonsense though; Hizashi just liked using forks more. Weirdo.)

Shouta thought about what Hizashi said as he ran the utensils under water, flicking the droplets off in the sink before giving them a good wipe with a clean kitchen rag. He knew that his husband wasn’t wrong in what he was saying. It had been a good eight or nine months since he had met the initially untrusting owl. As they had gotten to know each other better over the first couple of weeks, Shouta had already been able to recognize the earnest personality peeking out from behind the layers of mistrust Mimizuku usually upheld.

As the months had passed, as Mimizuku grew to trust them more and more, he had gotten more sweet and playful with them, more child-like, in a sense. In retrospect, it seemed really obvious. Hizashi had even mentioned the possibility to him before. He just couldn’t help but think, if only he had tried using his quirk on Mimizuku (broken trust be damned!) earlier, would things be different now?

“Hey, ‘Zashi,” Shouta opened his mouth, the questions spilling out before he could stop himself, “Do you think I should have tried using Erasure on him? Like earlier?”

“Well, if you had, we would have known about his being a human kid earlier,” Hizashi admitted, “But, chances are that things would be pretty different now.”

“But we’d have known, and we’d have been able to help him,” Shouta grounded out, “He wouldn’t be living on dumpster rats at least.”

“We can't change the past, but we can still help him now, Shou,” The blond shot him a raised eyebrow as he poured out half of the vegetable mix into the semi-cooked omelet before carefully flipping it over so the other side could cook.

“He told me he wasn't safe, Hizashi,” Shouta murmured, bitterness lacing the tone of his voice, “Who knows how long he was out there in danger before we even met him.”

“You’re forgetting that he’s an owl,” Hizashi laughed as folded the omelet down the middle, sliding it out of the pan, immediately getting started on the second omelet, “He could have gone to anyone at any time. And he didn’t exactly try to hide his smarts from us. He knows this.”

Well, now that he thought about it, that was also true.

“But he chooses to come back here. To come see me an’ you.”

Hizashi using logic against him; would wonders never cease? It was working too.

“I think you’ve already taken the first step to saving him actually.”

Shouta furrowed his brows. Had he? He had barely done anything except catch him when he had been falling out of the sky. Any hero would have done the same. What did Hizashi mean?

“Trust was the first step. He’s different from back when we first met, ya know.”

Hizashi finished with the second omelet, quickly pulling out the rest of the cherry tomatoes from the fridge to wash for a quick side dish. He slid the omelet onto the other empty plate, decorating the side with the tomatoes. The full plate was handed to him with a wink and grin.

“We’re family,” Hizashi shooed him to the table before pulling out the toasted baguette slices out of the oven. He tumbled them all into a small bread basket before picking that and his own plate up, ferrying both with a satisfied expression, “Izuku knows this as well.”

“But what if-”

"You've already asked Tsukauchi to check the database for him, yeah? You're already doing all you can for now.”

“I gue-” He cut himself off as his phone vibrated, the notification flashing onto his screen, “It’s Nedzu.”

That was it. Nedzu was the only other one that knew about Mimizuku. Maybe he would have an idea on where Izuku was. Opening up the email, he skimmed through the short contents.

“That fucker.”

“What?”

“Nedzu knew.”

He honestly didn’t know how he felt about that bit of new knowledge. Shouta knew he should at least feel some anger at this, but all he felt was a spike of annoyance and a bit of relief. They had a lead now and while it didn’t help them figure out where Izuku roosted during the day, it was more than enough for them to start figuring out what had happened to the kid. The more information they had going into this, the more they would be able to help him.

“Well, what did he know?”

“His name is Midoriya Izuku.”

“Text Tsukauchi,” Hizashi mumbled around a bite of baguette, “It’ll be better to go through the official channels eventually if we want to save him from whatever he’s in danger from.”

Shouta grumbled, but he knew that Hizashi had a point. Instead of responding to the email, he sent the name that he had gotten from Nedzu to the detective. He hoped the man was awake to see it, but he also knew that chances were that Tsukauchi had finally clocked out at his desk or something. Which was understandable. Didn't mean he wasn't tempted to call him to wake him up instead though.

"I don't see his name anywhere on The List." Hizashi frowned as he scrolled down on his own phone. The List, as it got commonly referenced as, was essentially an online database of missing people that was shared between the police force and pro heroes.

It was weird that Izuku didn't show up on that though. The List tended to be thorough and was updated frequently as new information came along. Frankly, if he wasn't so worried that adding Izuku’s details into the database might compromise whatever situation he was in, he would have done so while still in the debriefing room.

Shouta sighed, finally starting on his breakfast. The omelet was good, he had to admit, and the cherry tomatoes were fun to bite through.

His phone vibrated again, the notification appearing on his lock screen.

It was Tsukauchi.

[7:54] Call me.

Hizashi watched as his husband immediately stood up, unlocking his phone and walking into the hallway to their bedroom. He could hear the call tone blaring before it cut off, their bedroom door getting closed and leaving the apartment silent.

It wasn't anything new. Despite their best efforts to not bring work to the kitchen table, there were times where it just couldn't be helped. Hopefully it was either Nedzu or Tsukauchi with more information on Izuku, because with what they had now, they were basically floundering on what they could do next besides just searching the entire city for him.

He knew that Shouta had been shaken by this turn of events and if it were him this had happened to, he knew that he would have been absolutely livid as well.

Hearing about this even now made his blood boil. Having to keep his initial reaction tamped down so he didn't feed into Shouta’s guilt complex made him want to scream.

It felt awful knowing that so many chances to help had passed by them without them even realizing. Hell, it felt kind of awful knowing that the level of trust they had achieved so far still hadn't been nearly enough for the kid to ask them to help. He didn't blame Izuku though. Something or someone had to have utterly shattered the kid's sense of trust before they had ever met. Recovering from that was no easy feat. Honestly, seeing broken kids was the actual worst.

He wished that he had worked harder on fostering that trust though. If he had, maybe Izuku would have trusted them enough to help him. Trusted them enough to save him. Maybe Izuku would have come home.

It was useless thinking about all the maybes though. The past wasn't something they could change. All they could do was learn from it and focus on what they could do now and plan for the future.

Planning for the future though. It was something he and Shouta did together, knowing that they wanted to spend the rest of their lives together. They were both pro heroes after all and compared to most other careers, heroics was one where they never knew if they would be able to come home from. It made no sense to wait to marry.

And now there was Izuku.

Things did get more complicated with the knowledge that he was a kid. It was one thing to let a wild owl stop by their place every so often and leave every time to do his own business, but it was completely different knowing that this was a child that spent hours on end in the city alone, only able to provide for himself because his quirk allowed him to hunt his own meals.

Hizashi knew that it was impossible for a hero to save everyone. Well, maybe All Might could, but neither he nor Shouta were anything like that guy. But Izuku was someone he wanted to save. Perhaps it was selfish of him. But knowing that the sweet owl that spent time with them, that ended up giving them a chance even after his trust had been broken before, that made himself his own little space inside their family, was out there all alone and in danger and was scared? Well, it made him want to cry big fat ugly tears. Because it wasn't fair.

This was just a kid. A smart and sweet kid that worried about them when they got hurt, that basically volunteered to be a police informant (oh, he knew Shouta was beating himself up for even asking that now), and thought of his husband as a dad.

The world was cruel. It was something all pro heroes knew. Heck, it was something Shouta had intimate knowledge on, with his choice of going into Underground Heroics. It was why he wanted to go into radio hosting even as he did his pro hero work. But, it was up to them to lift the veil of despair and give others hope. Heroes had the job of trying to make the world a better place, after all.

Hizashi sighed, jabbing one of the cherry tomatoes with his fork and groaned as it bounced off his plate and onto the table instead. He really hoped that today would end better than how it started because this? This was actual shit.

He shifted his eyes over at the door to their bedroom before grabbing his own phone out, checking over The List yet again. Was he being just a bit obsessive over this?

Perhaps.

Well, yes.

But it was for an important cause, so that was fine by him. Hizashi really wished that Shouta had given him a physical description at least. It would be easier to filter through the entries that way.

It was awful, wasn’t it? While The List was certainly helpful in these regards, just scrolling past name after name really bore down the knowledge into his head that all these people were just missing. These people could very well be dead by now and no one would be any the wiser because there was no body to identify. All these people had family and loved ones as well and they were just all gone, only leaving behind old memories. It was this sort of information that was the hardest to swallow about his chosen career. It really drilled into him that not everyone could be saved.

“‘Zashi.”

Hizashi looked up, blinking up at Shouta. He had been so busy with his semi-morbid thoughts that he hadn’t realized that Shouta had left their bedroom.

“Didja get more information about Izuku?”

Shouta huffed out a sigh, but he nodded.

“We still don’t have the full story and this information can’t even be used to locate him, but we have some theories now.”

“It’s the second step.”

“We can’t even use what we know for th-”

“You need to trust Izuku more.”

“What does that have to do with anything?”

“I trust Izuku will find a way back to you, Shou,” Hizashi was adamant on this. He had to be. For himself and for Shouta. “He may be a kid, but he’s a smart cookie.”

“But what if he hates me now?” He reached up to tangle his fingers with his husband’s, giving them a slight squeeze, “What if he doesn’t want to be saved by me? He flew away from me!”

Hizashi only pulled him in closer, standing so he didn’t have to crane his neck. Shouta had never been a fan of openly showing his emotions, but right now, Shouta’s usual neutral facade had been cracked open, distress bleeding into his voice and eyes.

“Let him have some time to gather his thoughts. He’s probably still sleeping now. Might be recovering from quirk exhaustion even.”

Shouta only slumped at his reply and Hizashi felt a pang in his chest at his worried expression.

“Just, trust him,” He let his voice soften just a smidge, “We’ll find him or he’ll find us.”

Hizashi allowed his eyes to wander where he knew the family photo album was, and then to the picture frame by their entranceway.

“We’re family after all, Shou. Izuku knows this, knows us.”

Hizashi hoped so.

He really did.

“He’s our kid, ‘Zashi,” Hizashi had to strain to hear the low voice, “I don’t want to lose him.”

“I know.”

I know, Shou.

I don’t want to either.


Notes:

    Television > It’s 3AM. Do you know where your children are?
    Shouta >
    Shouta > activates Erasure
    Hizashi > arrived home just in time to see this

    No Izuku in this chapter (despite me wanting to add him in), but he’s taking a well deserved nap while his dads get to plan and stress out about him so it’s okay lmao #LetIzukuNap2k21

    Speaking of the dads! Shouta! Believe in the Hizashi that believes in Izuku!

    Also Shouta got punched in the gut with his guilt complex, while Hizashi gets just a bit morbid. Can’t blame him :c I mean, at least, they had a good breakfast?

    Nedzu’s reaction to the reveal was essentially ‘ah, that could have gone better.’

    Also, added the Winged Midoriya Izuku tag to this! Thanks for all your suggestions! (It will reflect in Izuku's future, but I mean, owls have wing rights too xD)

    Thanks for reading! Please let me know your thoughts! :D

    Next chapter comes out July 3rd! Izuku wakes up from his nap and does some thinking!

Chapter Text

When Izuku woke, the sun was still up.

Immediately scrabbling to his feet, careful to not make too much noise with his talons, he made his way over to his old yellow backpack in the corner. It was a ratty thing now, the color no longer vibrant and cheery as it once was. But it was all he had left as a reminder of back then.

He hopped onto it, his memories of last night flooding back to him, mixing with the nightmare he knew he had last night. They weren’t all too clear. Izuku knew that he had forgotten things, but he remembered enough to know that Aizawa-san now knew. It wasn’t even just the pro hero. The cat-human policeman and the hat-man, both of them had seen him as well.

That had never been a part of his plan.

What was he supposed to do now?

The police knew about him, there was no doubt about it.

Was he even safe here anymore?

Izuku thought about it.

He should be.

Izuku was pretty sure that no one knew about his roost. He had always been careful not to be seen when returning back there, his sight and hearing helping him out immensely in that regard.

So it should be fine, right?

He didn't have enough information to even guess at what they knew about him.

He just didn't know.

It had been hours since he had made it back, only to collapse into sleep. Despite resting for so long, he was still exhausted. It wasn't the usual type of tiredness he knew he could fix by having a nice flight outside with the breeze against his face. It was a different kind of tired. Not even the nice kind of tired he would be after a good night of hunting or when he would nap with Aizawa-san.

Oh.

Oh no.

Aizawa-san.

He clenched his feet involuntarily as his heart skipped a beat, talons easily ripping holes into the worn material. What had happened to Aizawa-san? Was he okay? The last he remembered of the hero, he had been running towards all the explosions and fire. His memories only got fuzzier after that.

Izuku clicked his beak in annoyance before freezing.


He shouldn’t have done that.

It was too dangerous right now to make any noises that people might hear!

He… He had to be as quiet as a mouse!

Well, that wasn’t a good saying at all.

He had heard Yamada-san use it once when he was trying to not wake up Aizawa-san from his nap. Yamada-san’s hearing probably wasn’t as good as his, so he guessed that it made some sort of sense. He didn’t remember ever hearing any mice when he wasn’t an owl. But as an owl, he knew that mice heartbeats tended to be very quick and obvious. It was like a small but fast drum. But other than that, and their loud paw steps, he guessed they could be quiet. Probably.

But, Izuku wanted so badly to peek out the window, just to check if there were people in his line of sight. However, he knew that was not a good idea at all. Aizawa-san would even say that ‘it was not lo-gi-cal.’

Maybe it was just paranoia.

Was it because it was still daytime?

The last time he had seen proper daylight was on that day when Aizawa-san took him to meet Nedzu-san at U.A. The sun hadn’t been as high up though and it had been slowly falling by the time they had left.

He hadn’t been out in proper daylight in a long time. For as long as he had been an owl probably. It was just so much more dangerous out there when the sun was high in the sky.

Was it possible that his owl instincts were influencing him?

Izuku didn’t really know much about his quirk, now that he thought about it.

He knew that he could turn from a human into an owl. But that was about it.

It was kind of embarrassing, honestly.

If it had been a quirk of one of his old classmates in daycare, he knew he would have asked a lot of questions about it and tried to draw it in his notebook. Izuku supposed it was because so much happened to him at that time, he didn’t even try thinking of much besides just trying to survive on his own.

A transformation quirk was pretty cool, now that he thought about it.

It wasn’t a quirk his Mama had.

But, it was not one like Hisashi’s either.

Thankfully.

While it would have been nice to get his Mama’s Small Pull, he was glad he hadn’t.

He was doubly glad that he didn’t get Dragon’s Breath.

Izuku loved his quirk.

It let him hide. It let him live.

Why wouldn’t he like it if it let him do all the things his Mama had asked of him?

And he had even met Aizawa-san and Yamada-san with this quirk.

He knew that Mama had told him to hide, but when he was with them, he didn’t feel like he had to do that.

Was that a good thing?

Maybe.

They were pro heroes after all. And he trusted them.

But in the end, he had still flown away.

Izuku didn’t understand why he did that. After the explosion was when it really started getting fuzzy for him. That wasn’t normal, was it? He had just been so scared. He had only seen the fire and the smoke and immediately thought that Hisashi had been there.

Had he been?

Was it possible?

Just another thing that he didn’t know. If Hisashi was in this territory, his territory, he didn’t know what he would do. He was torn between continuing to hide from him, tracking him down and attacking him, or leaving and finding a new place to call home. He didn’t want to do that last one though. And going against Hisashi’s Dragon Breath would be really hard. And it was a fire quirk. He didn’t want to go against one of those, not when he knew it was likely what took his Mama away from him.


Izuku didn’t know what to do.

But while he didn’t know what to do, he did know what he wanted to do.

He really wanted to see Aizawa-san.

Was that the right decision though?

Or did Aizawa-san hate him now?

He had never replied to him last night, only asking if he was safe instead. But, Izuku was pretty sure that that was something he was required to ask. Heroes were supposed to keep other people safe, after all. It was their job. Now that Aizawa-san knew who he really was, could he have changed his mind? What about the police? What if they told Aizawa-san that he couldn’t help him?

That’s what Mama had said after all.

The heroes and the police wouldn’t help.

Right?

He had always believed in what his Mama had told him, but for this, he didn’t want his Mama to be right. He wanted to believe that Aizawa-san would help him. That Yamada-san would help him.

Yamada-san had called him family and a family always stuck together. Mama had said that before as well. It was something she had told him after they had gone to the quirk doctor and he had asked her if she hated him for not having a quirk. It had made him feel warm inside when he heard that from her.

Mama wasn’t here anymore though.

She hadn’t been for a long time.

And those days that Izuku had once spent alone weren’t fun at all. They made him feel sad a lot and sometimes he would even feel angry. Those sorts of days didn’t happen very often now and he knew it wasn’t exactly Mama’s fault that she was gone. He knew it didn’t make sense to get angry at her for leaving him, for never finding him.

Had Izuku managed to hide so well that she couldn’t find him?

All he knew was that his Mama had wanted him to hide and then she had died.

Was it alright to feel both angry and sad about that?

Izuku had won their game of hide and seek in the end; had it been worth her life and his quirk?

He was just so tired. Last night had only made him more tired. Izuku huddled into his backpack, curling his toes in such a way so that he wouldn’t put more holes into it.

What was going to happen to him now?

If the police recognized him, they would probably tell Hisashi. That was what they learned about the police back in daycare. If you got lost, the police were supposed to help you find your parents and bring you back to them. He didn’t really know much more about the police except for what he heard from Aizawa-san. And it wasn’t as if Aizawa-san told him any specifics. So, he was really no better off from what he learned back then.

He hoped the police would just ignore what had happened last night, but he knew Aizawa-san wouldn’t ignore it and because of that, he’d probably ask the police if they knew anything about him.

Except Izuku didn’t know what the police knew about him. He knew that at least some people thought he was probably dead. But he didn’t know if that included the police or not. He had told Aizawa-san his real name; there was no way they wouldn’t find out eventually who he really was. And when they did find out, well, it was really obvious that he wasn’t dead.

All this worrying and thinking was giving him a headache. Maybe he should just try to get back to sleep? It was a tempting idea and something he wanted to do, but despite being that, he knew he would never get to sleep until he knew for sure that he wasn’t being searched for.

Well.

Unless it was Aizawa-san.

If it was Aizawa-san, then that would be alright.

That was a game of hide and seek he wouldn’t mind losing.

Hizashi knew that dragging Shouta out for shopping after his needed nap wasn’t exactly a great idea.

But, it was better than watching his husband nearly tear out his hair in frustration at finding out about the sheer incompetence of the officers who had handled Izuku’s case. ‘Handled’ was loose phrasing, because from what he had heard, they had pretty much washed their hands off of it once they had learned that Midoriya Izuku had been quirkless and put him down as dead on the same day they had processed Midoriya Inko’s death.

It had been a lot to take in.

The poor kid.

He wondered if Izuku knew about this.

Was this the reason why Izuku had never gone to the police and had only shown himself to Shouta after months of just watching from a distance? Goodness knows anyone wouldn’t have trusted the police either if they had been given up on so easily. Did they not send anyone to find him? Izuku would have been only six at the time.

Just how long had Izuku been on the streets before manifesting his quirk? It was blatantly obvious that this quirk was stress-induced. Something had happened to him to have forced his body to develop a quirk. Izuku had told Shouta that he wasn’t safe. What could be putting him in danger? Was he still actively in danger?

Finding out more about Izuku had only brought about more questions.

Hizashi hoped that he would come home soon.

They had a guest room that he had already started to clean up a bit when Shouta had been taking his post breakfast nap. He had bookmarked some sites for online clothes shopping and furniture shopping even. Hizashi had even pushed their processing paperwork forward as prospective parents looking to adopt. It had only been a few hours since he had even sent them in, but gosh, he was just impatient. He and Shouta had emergency fostering licenses already, but he knew that wasn’t going to be enough if they wanted to permanently take Izuku in as their family.

There had been something bugging him the entire time when Shouta had been relaying the information that he had learned from Tsukauchi’s phone call. The mother was dead and the son labeled as dead. However, there had been a father in that family as well. Had the father also given up on Izuku that easily? There had been no body. No evidence that Izuku had perished alongside his mother.

A father like that, who hadn’t bothered looking for his own son, who gave up on his own son, didn’t deserve Izuku at all. And Hizashi was sure, if Izuku had cared a whit about Midoriya Hisashi, this whole situation would have never happened in the first place. He didn’t know if the man would try anything, didn’t know what his feelings were about all of this. But Izuku hadn’t gone to his father in his time of need and frankly, that was telling enough. Especially since this was just a kid. If a kid didn’t trust one of their parents, then there was something wrong.

Hizashi knew that he and Shouta were willing to fight tooth and nail to be able to keep and raise Izuku, to prevent him from potentially being sent back to his father who obviously didn’t care about him. They already saw him as family. It would only make sense if they took him in like family. It was something they had thrown around before, jokingly, back when they only knew him as an owl. But now that they knew that he was just a kid? Plans had to be consolidated and expedited.

Their apartment also wasn’t exactly fit to be raising a kid. There was so much work to do! And was he drowning himself in these domestic tasks so he’d have less time to worry his socks off?

Absolutely!

Honestly, Shouta worried more than enough for the both of them. And his husband wasn’t the type to think about things like appropriate clothing and food for a kid. While he didn’t think Izuku would be served up jelly pouches as meal replacements, (Shouta took too much pride in his traditional Japanese dishes for that), he was sure that Shouta would see nothing wrong with putting Izuku into little black jumpsuits or something.

It was up to him, as the person who actually had a sense of fashion in this family, to make sure that Izuku didn’t take to Shouta’s idea of clothes. They didn’t even need many clothes! Just a few outfits so he’d have something to wear and not have to swim in whatever they had at home. Sadly, Shouta’s old clothes were at his parents' place (it was even that hideous googly-eyed cat brand that Shouta enjoyed so much) and his own had been donated forward a long time back.

He felt like he was getting ahead of himself, really. They didn’t even know if Izuku would want to stay with them.

They hadn’t even found him yet.

They didn’t even know if they would find him.

All Hizashi could do now as he scanned through racks of children’s clothes with Shouta’s mumbled words on the approximation of Izuku’s clothing size, was believe in Izuku.

Believe in the bond of trust that surely connected all three of them.

Believe that despite this setback, they could go beyond it.

Together.

The sun was still up and Izuku still hadn’t managed to get back to sleep.

Every suspicious sound he heard made him freeze up, the worry that it could be the police here to take him back to Hisashi being the most prominent. Of course, Izuku had more than that to worry about. What if it were Hisashi himself? Or what if it was a villain?

Being awake during a time when he usually slept was the worst.

There were just too many sounds and too many people around.

Even though he knew not many people even visited this particular area (it was why he chose this building as his roost, after all), it wasn’t as if it were completely empty. A few streets over, there was construction going on and while he usually slept through all that racket, it was proving to be much more difficult this time.

He blamed the headache. He had never gotten one of these as an owl before, so he hoped it would go away by itself because there wasn’t much he could do about it otherwise.

Footsteps and heartbeats would pass by every so often and Izuku found himself thinking again.

He wondered if Aizawa-san was looking for him.

Would Aizawa-san even realize he was here if he walked past this building this very second?

Izuku immediately shook his head.

What was he even thinking?

Wanting to be found?

That wasn’t the point of hide and seek!

That was wanting to lose on purpose!

Except.

He really would like to see Aizawa-san again though.

Maybe get another hug.

Or twenty.

Surely that was alright.

Izuku was so tired of hiding.

He just didn’t want to hide anymore.

Was that alright, Mama?

Was it alright for someone to find me now?

He didn’t want to play hide and seek anymore.

Izuku was tired.

He wanted Aizawa-san to find him.

But how?

How could he get Aizawa-san to find him?

His roost wasn’t even along Eraserhead’s patrol route. There was no way that the hero could just… find him.

Except there was.

The tracker he had on his gear.

The one that Aizawa-san had given him and asked him to use if he was ever hurt or needed him.

If there was any time he ever needed Aizawa-san, it would be now.

Izuku carefully tapped the button.

He could only wait now.

If Aizawa-san wanted to come, he would.

And if he didn't, he wouldn't.

So Izuku waited.

Izuku hoped.

Hizashi had been frowning at the small display of kid’s shoes for a while now.

It was the last thing on his mental list of essentials. It was hard to decide on what to get though. Shouta couldn’t exactly judge shoe size like he did for everything else. Not that Hizashi blamed him. But hell, shoes were important too! Maybe they could just get him a pair of those one-size-fits-all socks for now and then come back later when they actually had the kid with them.

Turning, he picked up a pair of black and orange socks with a dubious look on his face. These were right up Shouta’s alley, the orange markings coming together to create a cat’s face and paw prints. On the other hand, there were these yellow ones with rockin’ music notes! Decisions, decisions.

“‘Zashi,” Shouta had taken his phone out, eyes looking at it with laser focus before quickly swiping over the screen to take a screenshot, “I gotta go.”

Hizashi had recognized the tone he had taken. He reached to take the bag that his husband had been carrying for him as he searched for footwear.

“Is it Izuku?”

“I think so.”

“Then go.”

They traded a look between them, words unspoken, but Shouta nodded the same before rushing off.

Bring our son home.

Bring him home.

    Izuku wants them hugs and he wants to see his Aizawa-san ;o; okay, Izuku. You don't know yet, but he's coming!! The kid's just gonna like... wait until next week to know xD

    Hizashi is keeping busy and is very determined that Izuku not go for Shouta's clothing choices. He's also having some big thoughts on the situation as a whole.

    Shouta wasn't really in this chapter until the end, but I promise he was there for all the shopping. As a matter of fact, he didn't really want to go shopping, but he was determined that Izuku not somehow end up in Hizashi's preference of bright and gaudy clothing xD

Chapter Text

Shouta ran.

It was a good thing that he was familiar with the streets of Musutafu. Alleyways made wonderful shortcuts and they were less populated so he didn't get as many weird looks as he barreled onwards, only pausing to check the still blinking dot on his tracker app. While he would love to travel by rooftop, the middle of the afternoon had to be one of the worst times to do so. Too many eyes were about and he didn’t need any potential photos of him getting out.

The location of the GPS signal wasn't too far for him to make it on foot thankfully. He didn't even need a train ride to get there. But if he was correct, his mental map placed that area as mostly abandoned and flagged for future demolition. It wasn’t a place his own patrol covered, but he knew that Hizashi had a route that went right by it.

If this was where Izuku lived, then it made sense why no one had ever seen him. It was in a location with no nightlife and was hazardous enough that most people avoided the area due to paranoia of the shoddy make of the buildings. And during the day, when there would actually be people around, Izuku would be sleeping.

It surprised him, just a bit, to know that the place where Izuku may have called home wasn't even that far from their apartment.

How had he missed this?

Well, he knew how he missed this.

An owl's silent flight was really nothing to sneeze at. And with how Izuku tended to camouflage with some of the more craggier buildings, people would walk right by under him, none the wiser.

Was it frustrating and crushing to know that the kid stayed a mere ten minute walk from their apartment instead of coming home?

Yes.

Did he blame him?

Even if he wanted to, he couldn’t.

Last night was a mess of the highest order. The gunman, that fall, and then those explosions? The mission had ended up a success, but it may as well have traumatized Izuku, again. He was just a kid. He didn't deserve all this shit happening around him.

Knowing what he did now, it made sense as to why Izuku had fled. With a quirk that allowed him to fly, it was only logical for a child to flee from something that had affected him so deeply in the past.

He did wonder though. How much control did Izuku have over that quirk of his? The chances of it being a stress-induced quirk were pretty high. However, it was possible that it was just a late blooming one instead. But with what they knew now, he really doubted it.

A stress-induced quirk manifested to keep their user alive, pain and trauma being the most common triggers. Human evolution at its finest, he supposed. It still made him feel sick to his stomach to know that a kid had to endure all that. Surviving in the streets was not an easy task, and for a six year old, it must have seemed insurmountable at the time.

Tsukauchi had confirmed to him that at the time of Midoriya Inko's death, Izuku had not been registered with a quirk. Had he been a witness to his own mother's fiery fate? Was that what had triggered a quirk manifestation? Or had Izuku gained his quirk later on?

While the streets weren't usually that dangerous during the day, they definitely were at night. There were a lot of options there. Had Izuku gotten in the way of a villain? Or perhaps he had been cornered by a feral dog. Maybe he had almost been snatched by an underground fighting ring. It wasn't as if criminals hesitated to target unattended kids in the streets.

He would have to ask Izuku later.

It was probably going to suck.

But to be frank, a lot about this situation sucked. It wouldn't change anything if he avoided the topic or danced around it. And if his initial impression of the kid was true, tears were likely a guarantee anyway. He'd just make sure Hizashi was there with tissues on standby this time, just in case.

Shouta just had to know who or what was making Izuku feel unsafe. He hoped that Izuku would be willing to tell him. The kid did trust him, to a degree. Enough to still activate the tracker he had given to him at least. But with the events of last night fresh in mind and potentially also reliving his trauma? There was even a chance the slow and precious trust that he had been previously nurturing had been shattered, or even smashed into smithereens.

He just wanted his kid safe.

Was that too much to ask for?

Shouta knew he would just have to take to it with his bare hands, tearing what needed to be torn down. Something like this, he couldn't ask Tsukauchi to do. He didn't doubt that man would find his way into the situation anyways, but for now, until he had Izuku safe in his arms again, that could wait.

It didn't take long for him to reach where the abandoned buildings stood, the emptiness of the area almost jarring compared to the bustling crowds only a few streets away.

He checked his phone again.

To his relief, the little red tracking dot was still there.

Izuku was still there.

Shouta pushed aside the thoughts of the possibility that the tracker could have been taken off and left behind, and made his way to the building that the tracker was in.

There was no way to differentiate which floor Izuku was on, but it only made sense for him to be on the top floor. He would start on the ground floor though, if only to figure out if there were any areas that deteriorated more than the others.

Having part of a building fall down while they were both in it?

No thanks.

He’d take the extra few minutes needed to survey his surroundings. Cutting corners was a sure way to set himself up for failure. Hizashi would probably trash all his jelly pouches if he returned home with both Izuku and an injury.

He did his best to stave off his impatience, neatly falling into the mindset he kept when he was on duty. Taking a deep breath to ground himself, Shouta entered the building. He knew he had to be careful, and it was just as well that this sort of building situation was one he had previous exposure to. Rescue was something all heroes had to be familiar with, and while his Erasure didn't exactly lend to the typical rescue hero archetype, he knew more than enough to be able to navigate his way in and out of dilapidated buildings safely.

Thankfully, the stairs were still stable, as was the flooring. The walls, on the other hand, looked ready to crumble if he aimed a kick at it. He made a note to himself to not lean on any of the walls. Falling through a wall was not on his agenda for today.

With the stairs viable, he carefully made his way up the building, eyes peeled for anything shaped like an owl. Or a kid. Mostly likely an owl though. From what he could remember, what the kid wore was likely the remnants of what he had on him before he manifested this quirk. The tracking band had been nowhere in sight then, but for it to have been used now meant it had somehow returned when Izuku had used his quirk. It also meant that Izuku was stable enough and in the right state of mind to contact him. He couldn’t have pressed the button accidentally, right?

Well, Shouta was glad that the button was pushed.

Be it purposely or accidentally, it had been pushed.

End of story.

With a nod to himself, Shouta finally arrived on the top floor.

To his surprise, the top floor consisted of one giant room. Some sort of storage space probably. He could hear muted chirps from the corner and Shouta’s heart ached, knowing that this was the kind of place that his kid had called home for over a year. Making sure to broadcast his footsteps, he called out.

“Izuku?” His voice echoed against the walls, “It’s me.”

(He knew that Izuku likely had heard him getting nearer the entire time, but he didn’t want to overwhelm him. Not now. He had to be rational about this.)

There was a small rustling sound and then louder chirping. It was then that Shouta couldn’t stop himself from making his way to the corner where all the noise was coming from.

He just wanted to see his kid.

Heart racing, Shouta had to force himself not to run straight there. He could see the familiar shape of an owl—his kid—sitting on a bag. A bag? He squinted. A backpack, probably. It looked old and worn. Was it something he had picked up as an owl? Or was it a remnant from his previous life? He had a feeling it was the latter.

When he had gotten close enough, he bent down into a crouch.

“I’m here, Izuku.”

Izuku wouldn’t say he was good at recognizing heartbeats.

But if it was Aizawa-san’s or Yamada-san’s, that was a different story.

After spending so much time with the two of them, he could easily recognize theirs even from a distance if it was quiet enough.

That's why he had known it was Aizawa-san the moment the construction sounds had died down for a minute. Izuku had sat there listening, tilting his head every so often to keep track of Aizawa-san’s whereabouts. There was the temptation to leave his roost to go meet up with him, but Izuku knew he couldn't do that.

He had to let Aizawa-san find him.

Or else it wouldn't count.

That was how a game of hide and seek worked, after all.

And so he stayed put, allowing his nerves to grow as that familiar heartbeat got closer and closer to where he was. When he started hearing footsteps instead, he couldn’t help his chirps. Izuku just wanted to see him again. It hadn’t even been a full night since he had last seen him, he knew that, but he wanted so badly. And Aizawa-san was so close now.

But then he heard his name being called. Izuku had to cling to his backpack to remind himself that Aizawa-san had to come to him first. That Aizawa-san had to find him before anything else.

But Izuku knew.

Once Aizawa-san had gotten close enough, he knew that he wouldn’t be able to stop himself from going over to him.

Izuku was fine with that though.

If Aizawa-san had come, had searched for him, and then had found him, that meant that he did still care for him. It meant that even with what happened last night, he didn’t hate him.

That was all Izuku could ask for.

So when Aizawa-san finally came over, bending down so he was face to face with him, Izuku nearly tripped jumping off his backpack in his eagerness to run over to the man. A trail of peeps left him as he nearly slammed himself into Aizawa-san’s knees. He jumped, wings flapping only once to give himself enough lift to perch onto his thighs instead. Careful, as usual, with his talons, Izuku shifted his way up, using his beak to pull at the capture scarf hanging around Aizawa-san’s neck.

“Izuku.” Aizawa-san’s voice was odd, Izuku noted. It wasn’t his usual neutral or tired tone. (He did look tired though. So so tired.) And it wasn’t the way he talked around Yamada-san either.

“Izuku,” He repeated. Izuku chirped back questioningly, blinking back at him, “Let’s go home.”

It wasn’t phrased as a question, though Izuku knew it was one. Aizawa-san was very good at making questions sound like not-questions. But that was fine, since Izuku had gotten very used to how Aizawa-san spoke.

Plus, it wasn’t anything he didn’t want.

Izuku wanted to go home.

His Mama could no longer be there with him, but he thought... Izuku thought that she would be happy with what he was choosing in the end.

This game of hide and seek really was over now.

Izuku could finally go home.

(And if home was a different place now, with Aizawa-san and Yamada-san, then that was alright.)

He cooed out his agreement, tapping out a 'yes' while also butting his head against the chin in front of him.

Izuku could recognize the look on Aizawa-san’s face now; it was a look of sheer relief. He didn't really understand why he would be relieved though. Did Aizawa-san think Izuku wouldn't want to go home with him? Had he done something to make him think that?

Well, that was possible.

He had flown away from him last night.

But it hadn't been Aizawa-san’s fault at all! It was his! He had just been so scared that he couldn’t stay there. So scared that Aizawa-san had run deeper into all the explosions. So scared that the hat-man was trying to take him away from Aizawa-san. It had just been a bad night. The worst in a very long time.

It would have to be something he would have to try to explain later to him, he realized. Izuku didn’t want Aizawa-san blaming himself for what he did. He would have to be human again to tell them. And while he had gotten very used to communicating as an owl, this whole situation would be impossible to explain as one.

Being human again though.

He didn’t quite know what to think of that.

Of course he knew he had been human for a bit last night, but so much had been happening at the same time, he hadn’t thought too much about it. Izuku had been much more worried about Aizawa-san at the time. And also about what Aizawa-san had thought about him now that he knew the truth.

It was different now.

Aizawa-san already knew and he didn’t seem to care that much. Not enough for him to not look for him at least.

“Izuku, I know you don’t like going out during the day, but we can’t stay here until the sun goes down.”

The owl personally saw no problem with this, but he did understand what Aizawa-san was talking about. Izuku was still young and he didn’t have a job or anything, but Aizawa-san was an adult and he probably had hero work later. He would be wasting his time if he stayed here until the sun was no longer up. And it wasn’t as if he had a couch for Aizawa-san to nap on either.

“Together.”

Izuku swiveled his head to look at Aizawa-san, a small questioning chirp leaving him.

“Let’s go home together.”

He tilted his side to the side. Izuku wasn’t sure how they would do that. The raptor glove that Aizawa-san had wasn’t even with him right now. How would they go home together? His talons were too sharp for him to even think about standing on Aizawa-san’s bare fist the entire time. The last thing he wanted was to hurt him.

Izuku watched as Aizawa-san untucked the end of his scarf from the rest of it, winding the material around his forearm. He then tied the other end around his shoulder. It looked like one of those things that people wore if they broke their arm. The word for it was slipping his memory, but it looked like one of those.

“Izuku,” Aizawa-san tapped at his capture scarf-covered arm, “Stand here.”

He looked at the arm, unsure if he should.

“Trust me.”

Izuku did his best to sigh, it coming out as a small uhu instead. He would trust Aizawa-san in this as well, but the moment he heard anything that sounded like it was causing pain, he would be getting off.

Getting to the arm was easy. It was right next to where he was already perching, so he could just step onto it without even having to hop. It was odd being this close to Aizawa-san, he had to admit. Even after knowing him for so long, being so close to his heartbeat was a bit overwhelming.

But it wasn’t a bad thing.

Aizawa-san’s heart beating meant that he was still alive.

It brought him comfort to know that.

After all, Mama’s heart wasn’t beating anymore.

“Turn around,” Aizawa-san instructed as he carefully stood up, “Your back towards me.”

Izuku obligingly turned, talons still clenched down in order to keep his balance since he didn’t want to accidentally smack anything with his wings. When he was fully turned, Aizawa-san brought his arm even closer to himself. Izuku could feel his back flush against Aizawa-san’s heartbeat. He could feel the movements behind him. What was he doing? Izuku resisted the urge to turn around again to look. Whatever Aizawa-san had been doing, it was done fast.

He blinked as he was lifted into the rest of the scarf, the layers of it still shiny even from where he was. It was very warm and Izuku found he liked it. It was different from when he used it as a nest, but still comforting all the same. Wiggling his head through what was in front of him, he managed to get his beak out, though the rest of his vision was still blocked by the scarf.

Aizawa-san chuckled, shifting the material down enough for him to see.

“Better?”

Izuku cooed at him, tapping out a ‘yes’ while propping his beak up against the scarf so it wouldn’t get moved back up.

“Do you want your bag?”

‘Yes.’

Aizawa-san bent down in a smooth movement and picked it up. Izuku was slightly confused why they had to take his bag with them, but this just meant he could take the opportunity to show Aizawa-san his hero notebook later!

“Is there anything else you want to take with us?”

‘No.’

Did Aizawa-san think it was sad that this was all he had? Izuku wondered as he tilted his head to the side. It really wasn’t that bad. An owl didn’t need as much as a human to live. And in a way, it was much easier to be an owl compared to being human.

It was different for him though.

Izuku could be an owl.

Aizawa-san couldn’t.

He continued to wonder even as Aizawa-san started to walk, leaving his roost behind. The sun was still up, and while it was still loud outside, it wasn’t too loud if he returned his head back behind the scarf. And if he wiggled his head just right, though he couldn’t see everything, he could see enough of what was happening as Aizawa-san continued to make his way through the streets.

After a couple of minutes of just watching, he decided to stop. It would be awful if someone stopped Aizawa-san on the streets to ask about the green eyes peeping out from his scarf. Izuku would make sure that could never happen.

With the semi-darkness around him again, Izuku fell back into his previous thoughts.

Izuku knew he would have to be human to answer questions. He’d have to stay human for the entire conversation probably. There was a lot he had to tell them about. Hisashi came to mind. His Mama as well.

He also had to apologize.

Aizawa-san didn’t seem to hate him, but he didn’t know about Yamada-san. He didn’t think Yamada-san would. Really. But he would definitely apologize despite that. It was the least he could do for lying to them for such a long time. And if they still chose to forgive him, well, then Izuku would be happy.

Really really happy.

“Izuku.” Aizawa-san’s voice was low and sounded rumbly at this distance. Izuku peeped, tilting his head back to look up at him. “We’re almost there.”

Fast.

Long legs like Aizawa-san had were very good at going fast. Like his wings. But. Legs.

Izuku could feel himself getting more nervous as Aizawa-san climbed up the stairs. He knew he had decided on telling them the whole truth, but even then, being faced with the upcoming questions he knew he would be asked soon, he was still nervous.

All he could do was hope he was making the right decision.

He wanted it to be the right decision.

The keys in Aizawa-san’s hand jingled against one another as he unlocked a door. The front door, probably.

“Shou?” Yamada-san called as his footfalls got nearer and nearer, “Did you find him?”

Izuku immediately popped his head out of the scarf when he heard the worried voice, a chirp leaving his beak in an attempt to reassure the worried man.

“Did you fi-Oh!” Izuku could hear the relief in Yamada-san’s voice, “You found him!”

“Mhm. We’re home now.”

Yamada-san laughed, though izuku could see the start of what appeared to be tears in his eyes.

“Then welcome home, you two.”

Izuku felt warm hearing that.

They were words he had never thought he would hear again.

They were words he knew he’d never hear from his Mama again.

But this was good.

This felt right.

He was home.

Chapter Text

Shouta was home.

He had Izuku with him and he was finally home.

It hadn’t even been a full twenty four hours since the absolute shitshow of last night, but he was more than ready to lay down for his second nap of the day.

That wasn’t something he could do though.

While he hadn’t expected to find Izuku this afternoon, having the kid with him now meant certain things had to be moved forward. And depending on what Izuku told him, what new information he would gain from the coming conversations, Tsukauchi may have to be contacted sooner than he had initially anticipated.

Kicking his boots off, he switched into his house slippers, carrying Izuku with him into their apartment. He carefully shifted the loops of his capture weapon up and over Izuku, resting it back around his own neck.

Shouta made his way to the kitchen area, immediately using his foot to tug out Izuku’s stool from under the table, lightly kicking it forward into the living room area.

“Alright, down you go.”

Izuku hopped down easily with his wings unfurling just enough to help keep his balance, talons sinking into the somewhat ragged towel. The raggedy backpack was dropped down next to him, a small thump sounding against the floor.

What could be in there, he wondered.

“I have the clothes!”

Hizashi stepped into the living room, bag swinging in hand, green eyes darting to meet his own before looking back at the now preening owl. Shouta shrugged and hummed as his fingers easily picked apart the knot he had tied into his own capture weapon, retreating back into the kitchen to start up the coffee machine. He was going to need it.

“Um,” Shouta could hear Hizashi sink into a crouch, the bag crinkling as it hit the flooring, “Izuku, can you turn back?”

The coffee machine was arguably the device most frequently used by the two of them, though he knew his husband preferred tea in the evenings. (They had a whole section of a cabinet just for all the tea blends he ended up purchasing. Some weren’t even half bad. He would never refuse a good cup of green tea.)

“You can’t?” Hizashi’s voice floated up from behind up, “Well, Shou can help with that at least.”

Half in a daze, he moved on autopilot, the coffee machine dutifully doing it’s job, a freshly brewed cup of coffee soon appearing in his hand. He gulped down a mouthful as he returned to the living room, a myriad of thoughts bouncing through his head.

Was Izuku hungry? Thirsty? They had clothes. Hizashi would be hankering to put him in the shower or tub, he bet. With how he smelled last night, there was no way he was going to tolerate it on Izuku either. Did kids know how to shower at Izuku’s age?

“Have you ever tried to turn back into your kid self?”

Shouta perked up, pushing his own questions aside for the moment. That was a question he’d like the answer to as well.

'No.'

Huh. Well if that wasn't an absolute punch to the face. A peek at Hizashi's face only made the feeling in his gut feel worse. There was a lot to unpack from that one answer. Did it have anything to do with why he was in danger? Shouta had to admit, becoming a completely different species was a great idea if you had to hide away from danger. It was like an elaborate form of identity change for witness protection, but not even close to official and more heart breaking than anything else.

A kid that really thought that staying as a bird was the better and safer option than trying to live as a human; just thinking about it made him want to kick something. How could a situation like this have happened? If Izuku had stepped into any police station, his identity could have been tracked down. His supposed death could have been easily disputed and proven false.

He could have gone to find a hero.

He could have gone to anyone.

It all boiled down to a single question.

Why did Izuku feel like he had to do this all on his own?

“Izuku,” Shouta finally spoke up, placing his cup on the table, “Can I use my quirk on you?”

There was a moment of hesitation and he could feel his heart start to quicken before settling down again when Izuku tapped out a ‘yes.’

This was a child, he reminded himself.

But this was also Izuku.

And with that thought in mind, he activated Erasure.

In the blink of an eye, he and Hizashi now had a small child sitting in their living room. It was something they both already knew, had come to terms with, but this was really it. They had a whole small child in their home. He could hear Hizashi’s breath catch at the sight. And oh, what a fucking sight.

It had been dark last night and while the moon had helped in discerning a few features, there had been a lot he hadn’t noticed. It was a different story now. Not only were the lights all on, but the natural light from the afternoon sun was spilling in from the balcony doors. There was nothing that could be hidden away anymore.

Izuku was small. Were kids supposed to be this small? He didn't seem too visibly malnourished, but Shouta knew he ate his fill of rats every night. However, he knew that owls were strict carnivores. Did his quirk affect his diet in any sort of way? That was something they'd have to find out before they gave him any food.

(He didn't exactly know any quirk specialists, but he did know that Recovery Girl was still working at U.A. And while he wouldn't say Nedzu owed him a favor for not informing him of Izuku's identity earlier, he was owed a phone number at least. Chances were that Shuuzenji-sensei wouldn't know as well, but what he wanted was her vast network of contacts. There had to be at least one who specialized in animal transformation quirks, right?)

Shouta dropped his hold over his quirk, and then slowly lowered himself onto his knees, making sure to telegraph his movements. It was easy to see Izuku's nervousness. While those green eyes shared the same color between owl and human kid, it was much easier to parse his emotions now than it had been before.

His questions could be saved for later. Right now, what was important was reassuring their kid that it had not been a mistake to trust them with himself.

"Do you-"

"Do you want a hug?" Hizashi blurted out, interrupting his own offer of a hug, arms already open. Shouta could see his husband's lips wobble as Izuku stared at him, relief blatant on his face. Hizashi nodded and Shouta could see the moment Izuku's face crumpled, tears welling up in the corner of his eyes.

He could only make an aborted movement when he noticed Izuku jump off the stool, tripping over one of the legs. Hizashi dove forward, one of his knees banging against the floor as he caught him. Izuku only buried his head into Hizashi’s chest, small sniffles punctuating a litany of apologies. Hizashi only tightened his grip around him, pulling him even closer and down into his lap.

This was a good thing, Shouta told himself. It was good to cry things out sometimes. If anything, the kid seemed to need it. He reached out to lightly pat Izuku’s hair, the curls unruly and tangling with his fingers. Izuku only pushed his head against his hand and Shouta only looked at him fondly, giving him another pat before standing.

“I’ll be right back, alright?” Teary eyes looked up at him and Shouta couldn’t help himself, giving Izuku’s head one last pat before retreating back into the kitchen. He could hear Hizashi coo over the kid. Shouta knew he would be fine with Hizashi. He trusted his husband with his life.

Hell, he could already hear Hizashi cajoling Izuku into taking a bath, the kid even giving a mostly audible reply. It would be the perfect chance to get some things out of the way.

He contacted Tsukauchi first, the man picking up on the first ring. He sounded relieved hearing that Izuku was in Shouta’s current custody, and at his insistence, agreed to stay away for now. Izuku’s case wasn’t urgent, and in the law’s eyes, he was still dead. Tsukauchi could wait for his answers while he and Hizashi got their own first.

Nedzu was next on his list to contact and that was a simple email sent just asking for Recovery Girl’s number. Thankfully, the rat seemed rather charitable today and he received the information quickly along with another invitation for tea. Ignoring the invitation, he sent his thanks back (he had manners, even for stingy rats that kept important information to themselves) before immediately dialing Recovery Girl’s number.

Perhaps she had been alerted by Nedzu beforehand, but she also picked up on the first ring. It was almost creepy, but in this particular scenario, it was honestly great. The quicker he could get more information, the better it was for Izuku.

He didn’t exactly want Izuku going out there again tonight to fucking eat a rat or three. Not when he and Hizashi could provide for him, not when they didn’t know if he would want to fly off into the distance, never to be seen by them again.

That reminded him.

They needed to get Izuku seen by a doctor as well. He’d also need a trusted pediatrician that had experience with transformation quirks. And what about school? If they could manage to keep Izuku (they would; he would make sure they would), did they have to send him to school as well?

There was a lot to keep up with if they wanted to keep the kid. This was their kid though. Shouta knew he would do anything for him. And from what he had seen of Hizashi with Izuku, his husband would as well.

Shuuzenji-sensei’s voice interrupted his thoughts.

“One thing at a time, Aizawa.”

Shit. Had he been talking aloud? It was the exhaustion. He knew it.

Groaning, he took another large gulp of his coffee, swallowing it before taking a deep breath.

“So, I have a kid with a transformation quirk.”

He didn’t have that much time, and he was determined to make the most of it.

Izuku was sitting in a bathtub.

He had very firmly insisted Yamada-san stay outside after he had shown him where everything was in the bathroom. The fluffy towel he had been given was hanging on the door knob along with the bag of clothes.

It was fine!

He was a big boy.

If he was old enough to catch his own food, then he was definitely old enough to take his own bath. It was embarrassing enough that he had cried all over Yamada-san just before, but he already did the same thing last night to Aizawa-san. That was two whole adults he cried on in two days!

He couldn’t help it though.

Yesterday had been so scary. And today. Well, today was less scary so far. But then Yamada-san had offered him a hug and Izuku couldn’t refuse a hug. Yamada-san had been so big and warm and he kind of smelled like some sort of fruit. Izuku hadn’t been able to smell something nice like that for a long time. It was really weird, suddenly being able to smell again. That meant he could also taste again, right?

He would have to try that later. It had been so so long since he had tasted something properly.

As he thought about what Aizawa-san and Yamada-san could have in their fridge that was tasty, he cleaned himself. It wasn’t as simple as preening anymore. He had to use soap now. Staying clean as an owl was way easier, he had to admit. It made sense though; it wasn’t as if he could have gone into a store to buy soap as an owl.

But since he had the chance now, he was gonna take it. He was gonna be the cleanest Izuku ever! With that in mind, he scrubbed at everything he could reach until he felt like he couldn’t scrub anymore. The water in the bathtub was all gross. Ick.

The only thing left was his hair now.

He had never been that good at washing his own hair, but it wasn’t gonna wash itself. He picked up the shampoo, squeezing it carefully. He had dropped the bar of soap multiple times earlier, still getting used to having fingers again. His claws would have been so good for holding soap, but human him didn’t exactly have those. Putting the shampoo bottle back down, he picked up the soap again, squinting at it.

Now that he thought about it, his claws probably would have poked holes right through the soap. Alright, so maybe no claws was a good thing here. He put it back into its spot, only dropping it twice this time. Why was soap so slippery?

He didn’t have time to complain about soap though.

It was shampoo time.

Izuku rubbed the shampoo into his hair, eyes closing every time water would drip down his face. It had only been a few small drops so far, but more and more kept coming and soon, he couldn’t even keep his eyes open anymore.

This was bad.

If he couldn’t open his eyes, then he couldn’t see. And if he couldn’t see, he couldn’t get all the shampoo out of his hair and if he couldn’t do that… He’d never be able to leave the bathtub. He’d have to live in Aizawa-san and Yamada-san’s bathtub forever.

Frantically he tried to wipe off the water out of his eyes with a hand, a small yelp leaving his mouth at the stinging sensation that came right after.

“Izuku?” Yamada-san’s voice came from through the door, “You alright in there?”

Uh oh.

He wanted to say no, that he could handle himself. That he was definitely fine. But he had been lying to them for so long now, it felt wrong to continue to do so.

“I-I think I got shampoo into my eye,” He murmured, the words falling strangely out of his mouth, voice echoing in the room. He was trying to move his lips as little as possible. Shampoo in his eye was enough; he didn’t want it in his mouth as well.

“Do you need any help?”

He nodded, tapping a finger against the rim of the bathtub once.

“Uh, Izuku?”

Oh! Yamada-san probably couldn’t hear that from out there.

“Mm, yes please.”

Hearing the door slowly open and then close, he tilted his head in that direction. Sadly, tilting his head didn’t seem to help him hear better. While getting to smell again was great, his hearing and sight were… less than great. They weren’t horrible, but compared to his owl hearing and sight, well. He would rather have those back again. Not being able to hear the sorts of things that he had gotten so used to hearing was so weird.

“Does it hurt?” Yamada-san’s voice was a lot closer now.

“Little bit,” He resisted the urge to rub his eye again.

“I’ll help you flush it out, alright?”

Izuku nodded, just wanting the awful sensation to go away.

Yamada-san was really gentle and for that, Izuku was grateful. It didn’t exactly feel good to basically wash the shampoo out of his eye. It took all his strength to not move his head away.

Thankfully, it didn’t take very long, and soon the stinging was all but gone. Yamada-san stood and took a few steps somewhere, but returned with the fluffy towel, drying off his face.

“There you go! It’s a bit red still, but nothing a good night’s rest won’t heal.”

He nodded again. Sleep did sound nice.

“‘Zuku?”

“Hm?”

“Do you want any help with your hair? You’re still covered in shampoo.”

Izuku blinked, immediately closing his eyes again when water dripped down his face again. He clutched forward for the towel, bringing it up to wipe at his face, only to groan when more water continued to drip.

“Help please.”

Yamada-san immediately took the towel from him, lightly dabbing at his forehead. Izuku could hear him stand and open another bottle. Was it more shampoo? There was probably more than enough shampoo in his hair already. But Yamada-san didn’t squeeze any out, and just started working his fingers into his hair. Izuku kept his eyes closed, relaxing as Yamada-san got to work.

“You really are a polite kid.”

“Mama told me I should always treat people how I want to be treated. So if I’m polite, then the other person would be too.”

Not that it had ever worked with Kacchan.

“Your Mama, huh.”

“Tell you about her later…” Izuku mumbled his reply, eyes still closed. Kind fingers continued to dig into his scalp and Izuku was warm. Was it just the bathroom steam? Maybe. But maybe it was Yamada-san. Izuku liked that idea better. His headache was almost completely gone now and he was feeling so sleepy. Mama always said not to sleep in the bath though, so he tried his best to not actually fall asleep. However, it was proving to be really hard since Yamada-san was really good at washing hair and making him relax. Aizawa-san would say that it was logical. Yamada-san had so much hair that he had to be good at washing it.

“Well, I’m glad you think so.” Yamada-san hummed as he gently rinsed off the shampoo from his hair. Izuku tried to blink open his eyes. Had he been speaking his thoughts? Hearing a bottle being squeezed, he paused. It made the room smell really nice. What was that scent? It wasn’t what Yamada-san smelled like. Maybe flowers? Or another type of fruit?

"What's that?" He asked, "More shampoo?"

"It's a little something called conditioner," Yamada-san explained as he rubbed it into the ends of his hair, "It helps protect your hair from damage and it'll prevent it from being too frizzy."

“Smells nice.”

“Oh?”

“Owls…” Izuku started, pausing as he fiddled with his fingers. He brought one up to tap his nose, wrinkling it when he realized that his hands were still sudsy. “Owls can’t really smell anything, so. It’s nice to smell things again.”

Yamada-san stopped for a moment, silent, before continuing what he was doing before.

“I think Shouta has watermelon flavored jelly pouches actually. You should ask him for one later.”

Izuku hummed in reply. He had always wondered what the jelly pouches that Eraserhead had during his hero patrols tasted like. Maybe he would. If anything, if it smelled like this con-di-tion-er, it would probably taste just as nice.

“Alrighty then!” Yamada-san announced, “Now we just have to wait three minutes and then I can wash it out.”

Perfect.

That meant he could just relax in this warmth for now. He nodded, eyes still closed and propped his head over the rim of the tub. It was cold and hard, but it was enough for him. Being warm and happy made it very easy to fall asleep, especially since he had been tired ever since waking up earlier today.

It was almost completely quiet except for Yamada-san’s low humming, the music making him relax even further. Izuku didn’t know how much time had passed when Yamada-san called his name.

“Izuku? It’s time to wash out the conditioner,” A hand lightly brushed against his shoulder, tapping it once before giving it a small shake, “Izuku?”

“You can do it,” He grumbled sleepily, wanting to continue his impromptu nap.

“Keep your eyes closed, yeah?”

Izuku nodded, remembering the sting of the shampoo in his eye from before. Never again.

“Lemme just pull the stopper on this thing, so we don’t accidentally overflow the tub,” Yamada-san leaned forward to do just that, the old water immediately glugging away. He then reached up. Izuku could feel the small gust of wind from his actions, making him shiver.

“Cold?”

Izuku shrugged. Truthfully, it wasn’t that cold. It was just that he had gotten so used to having feathers all over his body. He had always been very warm as an owl, even when there was snow falling from the sky. But now, he had no feathers at all and all the warm water was gone. Just another thing he’d have to get used to, for now.

Warm water started trickling down against his arm, and he lifted his head up before remembering that he had to keep his eyes closed.

“It’s just water from the showerhead,” Yamada-san was quick to reassure him, “It’ll be easier to get everything off this way.”

And with that said, he had Izuku tilt his head back, finally washing out all of the conditioner from his hair.

“There we go!” At Yamada-san’s cheerful voice, Izuku blinked open his eyes to see a bright grin, “Would you like any help toweling off?”

He nodded, still somewhat sleepy. The quicker this got done, the quicker he could ask for a jelly pouch and then tell Aizawa-san and Yamada-san about everything. And maybe if they had some extra time, he could take a nice nap. Now that his headache was gone, he was finding it more and more difficult to actually stay upright.

Izuku felt like he was falling asleep on his feet as Yamada-san toweled him off, making sure to get most of the water out of his hair. It was still damp. He could feel it stick to the back of his neck, but it was not dripping on the floor, so Izuku thought that was good enough.

Clothes though. He was determined to do that himself, pointing at the door until Yamada-san finally left with a small wave. Izuku tugged on the first pair of underwear he saw, not really caring what they looked like. But clothes! He was curious to see what sort of clothes he could choose from.

His expectations did not betray him and he found a Present Mic shirt, the logo matching the poster on the living room wall. Hero merchandise! And it was for one of his favorite heroes! Did that mean there was something with Eraserhead on it in the bag as well?

He had to know.

Izuku picked through the bag, but sadly, he didn’t find anything that resembled Eraserhead. After a few minutes of deliberation, where he continued to keep nodding off, he pulled on a pair of pants that had cats on it. Aizawa-san did like cats after all. He’d probably like these pants.

Toweling off his feet again, (he didn’t want to get water all over the floor after all), he finally exited the bathroom, not closing the door behind him. It didn’t feel right to leave the light on, but he couldn’t exactly reach the light switch as a human. He’d have to ask someone to turn the light off for him.

The way to the living room was not one he remembered, but there were only so many ways he could go and doors he was stopped by. It only took him a minute to make his way there and once he was there, he climbed onto the couch, leaning his head against one of the pillows there. Aizawa-san and Yamada-san were probably both in the kitchen. He didn’t want to disturb them, so maybe a nap now? A short one. Or maybe just one looong blink.

“Izuku?”

“Hrm?” That was Aizawa-san’s voice.

“Have this jelly pouch and then you can go back to sleep, alright?”

Something crinkled in front of him and he yawned, reaching out to hold it. He shoved it into his mouth, surprised by the flavor. He sniffed at it to make sure.

“It’s watermelon.”

“Hizashi told me you wanted to try one.” Aizawa-san sounded amused as he spoke, the warmness in his voice impossible to ignore, “Do you like it?”

Izuku slurped at it again. It was sweet, but not too sweet. He liked it.

“It’s tasty,” He took an even longer slurp, making sure to chew up the jelly pieces properly. (Owls didn’t have teeth and he knew that humans shouldn’t just swallow their food in one go. Right?)

“You can have as many as you like,” Aizawa-san said to him, making it sound like a promise, “There are a lot of different flavors.”

He’d like that.

He really would.

It didn’t take long for him to finish what was in the pouch. He returned the empty pouch back to Aizawa-san, hugging the pillow to himself, dipping his head down into it.

“There’s a lot I wanna tell you…”

“Sleep first,” Aizawa-san gave him a kind look, “We can talk later.”

“Really?”

“Yes.”

“C-can I have another jelly pouch later too?”

“Any flavor I have, you’re welcome to.”

“Okay, then later.”

Izuku drowsed off easily afterwards, tucking his feet into the couch’s crevices. Right before he fell asleep, he heard Yamada-san talking.

Oh!

He had wanted to ask him to turn off the light in the bathroom.

As he opened his mouth to call out to him, he heard Yamada-san step into the living room, immediately walking past him and into the hallway, his words making him wonder if he was actually already asleep and just dreaming now.

“I’m gonna buy our kid a whole watermelon, Shou!”

It had to be a dream.

Izuku relaxed.

It was probably the best dream he's had in a while.

He wouldn't mind having this dream again.

It was nice.


Notes:

    Hizashi > He’s so cute, Shou… Just look at his clothes!
    Shouta > *quietly wondering if there’s an adult size for those cat shorts*
    Shouta > I can’t believe you put your own hero merch in there.

    Izuku finally gets his nap! And he gets to choose his clothes out of a very, uh, biased selection of clothes xD But at least he’s squeaky clean now! And he got another hug!!! This time from Hizashi! >u< Poor Shouta, maybe next time.

    Also he is completely okay after having that jelly pouch, if you were worried about that :D Aizawa asked a reputable source before offering it to Izuku!

    And while we are on the subject of Izuku; you may be wondering how he is able to speak so well after a year, nearly two, of not speaking. He has an easier time with it if he doesn’t think too much or is just very tired and lets his mouth run with it. It’s when he has to focus, choosing what he wants to say, that it gets more difficult with him. For Izuku, though he will stumble on words he doesn’t know as well, it isn’t as if he hasn’t been listening to Shouta + Hizashi speak during his visits with them. It is because of his being around them that he manages to speak confidently, even now. :D

    Shouta and Hizashi are really feeling the ‘dad’ status effect catching up to them. It helps that Izuku is very tired (showing off his inherent cuteness) and also very attached to them both.

    Thanks for reading! Please let me know your thoughts! :D

Chapter Text

Izuku woke up warm.

Blinking his eyes open, he looked around himself and immediately noticed that he wasn’t where he was supposed to be.

Where was he?

Why wasn’t he in his roost?

He tried standing up and to his surprise, his legs got tangled with something, making him fall off whatever he was on, landing face first into something that was definitely not the hard floor of his roost. Groaning, he pushed himself up, pausing when he saw arms.

Arms.

“Kid?”

Izuku looked up.

It was Aizawa-san.

A very visibly worried Aizawa-san.

He cooed, trying to reassure him that he was alright, a hum coming out of his throat instead.

He paused again.

Oh.

He wasn’t an owl right now.

Looking down at his very human fingers, he pinched himself.

(It was what Aizawa-san did when he woke up from naps to make sure he was actually awake. Izuku was sure that he wouldn’t mind if he borrowed this idea.)

He blinked.

Everything was still there.

Huh.

Yesterday hadn’t been some wild dream of his after all.

“Kid?” Aizawa-san repeated, his eyebrows scrunching up together, “Are you alright?”

Izuku nodded at him, reaching out a finger to tap on the coffee table.

‘Yes.’

Aizawa-san didn’t say anything, just looked incredibly sad for a moment, before crouching down, offering a hand to him.

Izuku took it, quietly marveling at the new size difference. His foot as an owl was as big as Aizawa-san’s hand, but his human hand was so small in comparison. Quickly untangling the blanket from his legs, Aizawa-san tossed it back onto the couch before standing and pulling him up as well.

Ouch.

He winced, nearly falling over again.

“Kid?” Aizawa-san sounded alarmed this time, “Are you sure you’re alright?”

Izuku hummed, pointing at his feet. He vaguely remembered that he had been running last night. He must have stepped on something. There were probably a lot of things to step on when he had no shoes.

Aizawa-san blinked at him before redirecting his gaze to his feet. Izuku shuffled back onto the couch, glad that it was low enough for him to get onto easily.

He raised one of his feet in Aizawa-san’s direction, wiggling his toes.

It was then that he remembered again that he was human right now and humans could speak actual words.

“Last night,” Izuku started before a frown crossed his lips (lips!), “Last night, I ran on the ground without shoes.”

“It doesn’t hurt a lot,” He insisted, seeing Aizawa-san already reach for the first aid kit stored under the coffee table, “It just surprised me! ‘Cause it didn’t hurt when I was an owl. And I didn’t notice it when I took the bath.”

“Let me see,” Aizawa-san insisted right back at him, “Please.”

He pouted, the motion tugging oddly on his lips. How could he say no to Aizawa-san when he asked so politely? And it wasn’t as if he was asking for something unreasonable. He knew Aizawa-san was just concerned for him.

Izuku knew this.

Izuku knew Aizawa-san.

Aizawa-san was nothing like Kacchan.

Aizawa-san was someone he had already decided to trust.

Silently, he let Aizawa-san have his foot. He received a nod in return. It was quick, thankfully and his foot was released within a few seconds.

“A small scrape,” The first aid kit was reached for anyways, a small tub of something being taken out, “In all likelihood, it’ll heal on its own, but some petroleum jelly wouldn’t hurt.”

What was pe-tro-le-um jelly, Izuku wondered. Was it like one of Aizawa-san’s jelly pouches? Why would you put jelly on scrapes?

“Can you eat it?” He just had to know, “Is it like the kind of jelly in the jelly pouch?”

Aizawa-san paused as he popped the lid open, using his finger to scoop some of it up.

“While it’s possible to eat it, I’d recommend you don’t,” Aizawa-san smoothed the jelly at the scrapes on the bottom of his feet, the quick touches feathery soft, making his toes curl up, “It doesn’t taste good and it’ll keep you glued to the toilet until it gets out of your system.”

“Just stick to the jelly in pouches, alright, kid?”

Izuku nodded. He didn’t really want to get glued to the toilet in any way, shape, or form.

“Now that that’s out of the way, we have a lot to talk about, don’t we?”

Nodding again, Izuku picked up the blanket next to him, fiddling with the tassels on the edges. Aizawa-san reached over, giving him a small pat on the head before turning to pull the stool closer to him.

“I want to help you.” He sat down, “We want to help you.”

“What do you want to know?” Izuku grew warm inside hearing that, “There’s a lot. And where’s Yamada-san?”

“Hizashi’s putting something into the oven for us later. It won’t take him long.” Aizawa-san breathed in. And then out. “Izuku, we want to know everything.”

Everything? That was a lot. Didn’t Aizawa-san have to go do his patrol? And didn’t Hizashi-san have work as well?

“It’s gonna take a long time,” Izuku warned him.

“Hizashi took the day off and I’m free tonight as well,” Aizawa-san shrugged, “We have all the time we need.”

“Could I have some water first?” Izuku could feel his mouth already getting dry and he hadn’t even been talking that much yet.

Aizawa-san nodded, standing and disappearing into the kitchen only to reappear with both a large cup of water and Yamada-san.

“Kiddo!” Yamada-san greeted him, all bright eyes and smiles, “How was your nap?”

“Good,” Izuku replied, before pausing and then continued, “I forgot I had long legs now and fell off the couch.” At Yamada-san’s alarmed look, he also quickly added, “I’m okay though. The carpet’s soft.”

Aizawa-san handed him the cup, and after making sure he had a good grip on it, Izuku sipped at the water. He handed it back afterwards, watching it get placed on the coffee table. Yamada-san sat next to him on the couch, giving him a grin when their eyes met.

Izuku gave him a smile back, blinking in surprise when the blond clutched his chest, mumbling something about new wallet photos. Aizawa-san sighed before lightly tapping his knee, bringing his attention away from Yamada-san.

"Do you mind if I write some of this down?" He picked up a small notepad along with a pen, twirling it with a flourish. So cool.

"I don't mind," Izuku shook his head, "But I don't know where to start."

"It's best to start from the beginning, isn't it?" Yamada-san leaned back, tapping his chin with a finger, "What exactly happened to make you end up on the streets, Izuku?"

Izuku thought.

He knew the answer to this.

This was it.

"It was hide and seek."

Shouta furrowed his brows.

Hide and seek? Like the children's game? It had to be, but it also made no sense. He quickly scribbled it down anyways.

"We're gonna need more of an explanation for that, 'Zuku." Hizashi cut in with a small frown.

Izuku paused again before starting, fingers tangled into the blankets tassels.

"I was playing hide and seek with my mama. I was supposed to hide and she was supposed to find me."

Shouta could feel the pit in his stomach sink.

"She didn't find me."

"Oh, kid." Hizashi crooned, tugging the boy into his side.

"I waited for her, you know" Izuku continued speaking, voice stilted, shaky fingers latching onto Hizashi's shirt, "I waited for days."

This hurt to watch.

This hurt to listen to.

What kind of parent? Izuku had been six at the time.

"Izuku," His husband spoke in a light tone, though Shouta could see his eyes were hard, "Do you happen to know why you two were playing hide and seek?"

"Yeah," Izuku frowned, his eyes darkening ever so slightly, "Mama said that we were in danger. So she told me to go hide."

Shouta jotted that down, mind racing. Were they finally going to find out what that danger was? Would they be able to protect Izuku from whatever it could be?

"Did your mama tell you what the danger was?" Hizashi continued, "Why didn't she go to the police? Or find a hero?"

Yes. Why hadn’t she done that? That was what they were here for.

And while they knew that the officer who had dealt with Izuku's case afterwards was absolute trash, it had happened after Midoriya Inko's death. Was there a connection? Or was it just blatant discrimination?

“Mama said that the heroes wouldn’t help us,” Izuku even looked guilty as he admitted this, eyes darting between him and Hizashi, “She said she asked them and they said no.”

“What about the police?” Shouta asked, trying his best to not to break the plastic casing of the pen in half. It was harder said than done. He could almost feel it giving way against his thumb. Not good. Forcing himself to relax, he pushed away his irritation with this situation. They didn’t have the entire story yet. He couldn’t judge a dead woman this early on. “Did she try contacting them?”

Somehow, Izuku only looked more nervous hearing those questions.

“She… She didn’t tell me,” He finally managed after a long bout of silence, “I don’t know.”

“Did you try contacting them at all, kid?”

Shouta was sure he didn’t, but it didn’t hurt to ask. Perhaps they’d find out why Izuku hadn’t gone to the police in the first place. And now that he thought about it, did Izuku even know his mother was dead? It was possible, but the kid hadn’t mentioned anything about that. If he didn’t know, they would have to tell him. It would be cruel to keep this sort of knowledge away from. If there was anyone that deserved to know the truth, it would be Izuku.

A slow shake of the head was Izuku's reply. Shouta resisted the urge to groan. It was only what he had expected, but having the confirmation on this didn’t exactly make him feel any better.

“Can you tell us why?” Hizashi pressed on.

And wasn’t that the crux of the whole situation.

Why had Izuku chosen not to trust law enforcement?

Why had he not gone to a responsible adult with this?

Why had he chosen to live on his own in the streets for over a year?

“Promise not to hate me?” And oh, if hearing that didn’t rankle Shouta’s soul. Hizashi bit down on a half formed protest, Izuku looking alarmed as he heard it. He exclaimed, “I was gonna tell you anyway!” His voice only got lower as he continued speaking, petering out into a barely audible mumble. “But I just… I just don’t want you to hate me.”

“Never!”

Shouta wished he could have said he was surprised when Izuku started to sniffle after hearing Hizashi’s vehement denial. He couldn’t fault him though. This was just a kid. A kid that had spent over a year and a half living on his own, him and Hizashi (that he knew of) being the only ones he chose to interact with. It was logical that Izuku would latch strongly to their opinion of him.

“Kid,” He leaned forward to speak, elbows propped up against his knees, trying to lace as much earnestness into his voice as he could, “We could never hate you.”

Hearing that must have been the final straw for Izuku, because in the next moment, he burst into loud tears. Shouta shot Hizashi a look, but the blond was blowing his own nose as well (in camaraderie, or what?). Reaching over to pluck up a few tissues from the box on the table, he softly dabbed at the tears falling down the small face in front of him, tucking the other tissues into those equally small hands.

It seemed wrong to try to push Izuku into answering his questions right now, so instead he lightly shoved his husband further along the couch, the man shifting over without a complaint, pulling the kid along as he went. He moved himself over to the now available space, Izuku now sitting snugly in between him and Hizashi.

Honestly, he wasn't quite sure what to do with a crying child, but Izuku seemed to enjoy physical affection more often than not, so that was what he would offer.

And it seemed that he was right to offer. As soon as he lifted an arm up, Izuku wiggled his way under it, nestling himself up against his side. Tears were still falling down his cheeks, though not as many as before, his sobs interspersed with hiccups. Shouta could only hold him closer.

If he thought about it (which he was really trying not to do), this was probably the most physical contact Izuku had had in the last year and a half. It made sense that he craved some sort of touch. Was it to the degree of touch starvation? He didn't know, but he was sure they'd find out eventually.

He lightly rubbed his hand against Izuku's shoulder, finally noticing that the little cat faces on Izuku’s shorts had varying expressions. (Very cute, if you asked him.)

Hizashi was wiggling his eyebrows at him, the tip of his nose flushed from all the blowing he did, pointing at Izuku's shirt and he squinted. That was a Present Mic shirt. Did he seriously put some of his own merchandise into that bag? Hizashi did seem over the moon about it, so he didn't mention that there was a chance that Izuku had chosen these specific articles of clothing just to please them.

Shouta waited until Izuku stilled, until even the smallest hiccups stopped, before patting his arm.

“Do you want to go wash your face?”

He nodded, eyes rimmed with red. If Shouta were a betting man, he’d put money on the sheer stickiness of Izuku’s face right now.

“Go on then,” Nudging the boy off the couch, he nodded at the direction of the bathroom, “There’s a footstool by the tub if you can’t reach the sink.”

Izuku nodded again, sliding off the couch carefully, looking up at him and Hizashi, clearly stalling.

“We’ll be right here when you return,” Hizashi smiled, his grin just a bit too bright. Shouta grunted, sharply nodding his agreement.

Izuku looked a bit more relieved after that, the nervousness in his eyes fading away to be almost unnoticeable. He’s had practice with this, Shouta thought. It couldn’t be something he had picked up as an owl. Something in his life previously had taught him how to hide his emotions.

Hizashi's grin disappeared as Izuku finally left and entered the bathroom, the slide of the footstool against the tile still audible from where they were in the living room. It wasn't until the faucet was turned on, the water loudly gushing out, did his husband move over to sit next to him and start speaking.

"What kind of mother sends their kid out like that?!” And though his voice was much lower than it had been before, the sheer vehemence almost brought goosebumps to his skin, “I just, I just can’t believe-”

“We can’t judge before hearing the whole story,” Hizashi’s lips twisted hearing that, looking far from the family-friendly image he usually pulled off for the public, “I’m not exactly happy with what I’ve heard so far as well, you know. But I can’t pass judgement until I’ve heard it all.”

Even if what he really wanted to do was raise Midoriya Inko from the grave and personally demand the reason why she had Izuku purposely avoid going to anyone who could have helped him.

Bringing back people from the dead was impossible though. He had never heard of a quirk that could do such a thing.

What Midoriya Inko had been thinking in choosing to do this was lost. They would never know why she had chosen to go about this in such a way.


… Or could they?

Was it possible?

Had Midoriya Inko left behind an updated will at all?

If she had told Izuku to hide away, thinking they were in danger, would she have changed anything in her will? Would she have even thought of that?

Midoriya Inko’s plan was rushed. Shouta could see that easily. But from what he knew now, there had to be a block of time between when Izuku had left his old home and Midoriya Inko had died. He just couldn’t imagine that a mother, one that Izuku clearly cared for so much, would have actually abandoned a kid for days. Had whatever danger they had been in caught up to her? Had Izuku waited for her to come find him, not knowing that her corpse was already lying in their home?

Could they build a timeline off what they knew now?

Shouta slipped out his phone to text Tsukauchi. Wills and death certificates were public records after all and if they didn’t have copies of it already, then it should be simple enough for them to obtain them. Had Izuku attended some sort of school? Did six year olds go to school? Had his absence been recorded if he did attend school?

He had so many questions.

Even if these leads amounted to nothing, it wouldn’t hurt to chase them for now.

In the end, it wouldn’t change what he wanted for Izuku.

Just then, the sound of water stopped. Shouta continued his text, wanting to send it off before Izuku returned. He could hear Hizashi scoot away from him, leaving the space between them open again.

And there.

Sent.

It was up to Tsukauchi to track those files down now.

“I’m back,” Izuku announced quietly as he stepped into the living room again, eyes quickly flashing between him, Hizashi, and then the empty space between them, “I put the footstool back where I found it.”

“Thanks, kid,” Shouta nodded, “Are you feeling up to answering that question now?”

He nodded.

“Alright, but drink some water first,” He picked up the cup and held it out to the still-standing Izuku, “Don’t want to get dehydrated after that.”

“It’s a lot of water,” Izuku commented, accepting the cup and taking another sip, “I didn’t have to drink this much water as an owl.”

“Oh?”

“Maybe because owls can’t cry?”

Oh.

“And I’m sorry for crying so much,” Did Izuku think Shouta would dislike him based on something so trivial? “I didn’t think, I just, I’m so used to not crying ‘cause owls can’t cry, but humans can cry, and I couldn’t stop-”

“Izuku,” Hizash interrupted gently, “You don’t need to apologize for something like that. Crying isn’t inherently a bad thing, you know.”

“Hizashi’s right,” Shouta patted the empty space on the couch with a raised eyebrow, “It’s a way to help express your emotions and it can even relieve stress.”

“So stress is a bad thing?”

“It can be.”

“What is it?”

“It’s the feeling of pressure on you, of being overwhelmed,” He explained, only belatedly remembering that Izuku was one whole child, “Like when you’re worried or uncomfortable about something.”

“I think it did lower my stress then,” He blinked and Izuku must have taken that as a gesture to elaborate, “I cried a lot today and yesterday. I was really worried about telling you about me. But now I feel a lot better about it.”

That was right. Izuku had probably stressed his head off about this entire situation. How long had it been since they had properly met? Over half a year by now. How long had Izuku been stressing about everything? So much stress could not have been good for a child’s growth.

And while it was good that Izuku was no longer under that particular type of stress, he knew there would be longer reaching consequences that would eventually crop up in the future. For now, he would be happy that Izuku was no longer worried about confiding in the both of them. For now, it was enough.

Shouta patted the empty space on the couch again after placing the cup back on the table, Izuku finally climbing up to sit in between them.

“Ready?”

“Mhm.”

Hizashi visibly softened at the determined note in Izuku’s voice. If this weren’t such a serious conversation, he knew that the blond would have already tried scooping up the kid into his arms for another hug.

In the meantime, Shouta honestly wished he had more coffee.

Watching Izuku start on a word, only to stop almost immediately, was troubling and while he wanted to help, he wasn’t sure what he could do except allow him to take his time. He didn’t blame Izuku for the trouble he had with speaking, hell, he was impressed by how he was still able to talk after not using his voice like that in so long.

Coffee was not the solution for Izuku, but a cup of coffee would work wonders to help hide whatever expressions he may inadvertently show on his face. He didn’t exactly need Izuku to know of his growing dislike for Midoriya Inko.

“So,” Shouta blinked as Izuku suddenly spoke up again,”You know how the police are supposed to return you to your parents if you get lost?” He started, only to pause, continuing after he and Hizashi both nodded, “Mama’s dead. And I didn’t want the police to give me back to my… to him. To Hisashi.”

Well.

That answered his question of whether or not Izuku knew about his mother’s death.

“Do you not like him?” Shouta asked. While it was true that he had his own opinions about Midoriya Hisashi’s actions, or rather, lack of actions, Izuku was someone who had lived with him, presumably. His thoughts on this would be important.

“Mama died because she burned to death,” Izuku said bluntly, “Hisashi has a fire quirk, you know.”

Ah.

They didn’t know.

Everything was starting to make some horrible sort of sense now.

“He’s a bad man, Aizawa-san,” Izuku’s voice took on a more plaintive tone, desperation leaking into it, “You can’t let the police take me back to him.”

Abusive perhaps? He couldn't be sure of that, but he was sure that Midoriya Hisashi hadn't treated Izuku well. For a kind child like Izuku to not even call that man his father and to resort to using a given name? There was definitely something wrong.

All Shouta knew was that there was no way he would allow custody of this child, of his son, to go to someone like Midoriya Hisashi.

"We'll both do our best to not let that happen," He reassured Izuku, who was looking up at him, hope shining in his eyes, "Can you tell us a bit more about when you were waiting for your mom to come find you? Where did you hide?"

"I walked for a long time and I found this alleyway and I stayed there when I was hiding," Izuku paused, eyebrows furrowed in focus, "I don't remember where it is though."

An alleyway.

That didn't help at all.

“It was really loud there too,” He added after some more pondering, “I don’t really remember a lot of what happened back then, sorry.”

“No, don’t apologize, okay?” Hizashi ruffled Izuku’s hair with a hand, “It must be hard telling us all of this.”

“I want to tell you though,” The kid responded softly, “If I don’t tell you, you could get hurt.”

“Kid, we’re both pro heroes,” A fact that he knew Izuku was more than familiar with, “We’re both capable of taking care of ourselves.”

“I know, I just,” Izuku seemed to struggle, biting out the next words, “Hisashi took Mama away. I don’t want him to take you and Yamada-san away too.”

“Oh, kid.” Hizashi crooned, apparently done with trying to keep his arms to himself, holding them out again.

Izuku immediately scrambled into them, letting out a surprised ‘oomph’ as he was gently pulled up to sit in Hizashi’s lap instead. Shouta waited a few seconds to see if he’d try to get back down onto the couch proper, but Izuku seemed more than happy to stay where he was, peeking up every so often, an unreadable expression on his face.

This was proving to be a long conversation.

He really should have gotten another cup of coffee.

Chapter Text

Shouta would be a liar if he said this wasn’t pulling at his heartstrings.

The sight of the small child in Hizashi’s arms made him feel all kinds of funny inside. Izuku was gripping onto whichever arm was closest to him, hugging it close to his chest. He looked up at Hizashi every so often, alternating between loosening and tightening his grip after staring at the blond’s facial expressions.

It was a cute sight.

Shouta wished he could let it continue on for longer.

However, allowing Izuku to continue to think this way was only going to hurt him. It would continue to stress him out.

Therefore, it wasn’t logical to allow him to continue.

“Izuku,” He placed down his notepad and pen as he caught Izuku’s attention, “You know what my quirk is, right?”

“Yes!” Izuku seemed to brighten at the question, “It can make someone else’s quirk stop working! It’s so cool!”

“It’s called Erasure,” A small and eager nod. Such eagerness. Was this what all kids were like? “If I can stop other people’s quirk from working, what do you think would happen if I met Midoriya Hisashi?”

“You could stop his quirk?”

“Exactly.”

“And he wouldn’t be able to hurt you?”

“Not with his quirk at least.”

“And you could stop him from hurting Yamada-san too?”

“Hizashi is perfectly capable of fending off villains as well.”

To be frank, Hizashi proved to be just as brutal, if not even more than he was. During takedowns when the fight wasn’t being broadcasted on television for everyone to see at least.

Izuku seemed deep in thought after his reply, eyes narrowing. It was an odd expression to see on a kid, Shouta decided. From what he had seen when he was on grocery duty (which wasn’t a whole lot, he could admit), kids were generally easy to smile and impulsive. Nothing like how Izuku acted with them. It was worrying to think about, but it wasn’t anything he hadn’t thought might happen. Children weren’t meant to support themselves at this age, and Izuku had been thrown straight into the deep end with having to find his own shelter and food.

There was his quirk at least.

The quirk that had no doubt saved Izuku’s life. With how seriously Izuku had taken his mother’s words, Shouta found it hard to believe he would have gone to anyone in the early days of living as an owl. It made him wonder how he and Hizashi had managed to be the exception to this though.

It also made him wonder what had happened for Izuku to have even manifested this quirk.

Was it morbid to want to know?

Perhaps.

But it did more than fulfil his curiosity, it would give him insight on Izuku’s mental state.

It was likely going to be a touchy subject, he knew, but he would ask anyway.

“Izuku,” He called out, green eyes immediately darting up to meet his own, “Do you feel comfortable enough to tell us about how you got your quirk?”

“My quirk?”

“Kid,” Honestly, he hadn’t been sure whether or not he should even mention this, but it was no use cultivating a bond of trust if it didn't go both ways. He had to be willing to tell Izuku what they already knew about him, “You know you worried me last night, right? So much that I ended up trying to find more information on you. I wanted to help you. The more information I had, the better I would be able to help. Does that make sense?"

Izuku nodded, looking worried that Shouta had been worried about him. He really was too good of a kid. Shouta was glad that he had managed to keep hold of that amidst the entire situation he had gotten swept into.

"That means both Hizashi and I, and a couple of others, know about your past." Izuku still looked confused, tilting his head eerily like how he would do as an owl. He carefully softened his voice, "It means we know that you used to be Quirkless."

A look of surprise flew across Izuku's face.

"You know?" His voice held a tone of sadness. Hizashi only hugged him tighter, Izuku not even protesting the closeness.

"We know."

"Who else knows?"

"Nedzu," Another small flicker of surprise, "And Tsukauchi. He's the detective from last night. With the hat."

"The hat-man," Izuku whispered to himself.

Hat-man?

A name which Izuku used to identify Tsukauchi by, in all likelihood. Funny though. Knowing that Tsukauchi had been reduced to just his hat to Izuku and that he had lost his hat last night… Well, he was just ‘man’ now, oddly enough.

“The hat-man,” He confirmed, “Nedzu was the one to provide your full name, and Tsukauchi was the one who looked through all the reports for us.”

“Do… Do you trust him?” Izuku looked uncertain, “He works with the police…”

“Tsukauchi’s a good man,” They weren’t exactly friends or anything of the sort, but Shouta had been working alongside him enough to be able to judge something like that, “I won’t say you have to trust him, but I do think that he’s the best option to go with if you want to guarantee not having to return to your father.”

What he was surprised about was that Izuku seemingly had no complaints about Nedzu knowing. There had been that moment of surprise, but nothing other than that, nothing.

“If Aizawa-san thinks he can help, then I guess it’s okay?”

“You’re too cute, Izuku!” Hizashi cooed at the reply, “Don’t you worry your little head! Tsukauchi’s a nice guy. We’ll make sure you don’t have to go home with that man, yeah?”

“Ye-yeah.”

English? It was a bit shaky, but coherent enough.

“You know how to speak English?” His husband squealed, eagerness flooding his expression, “Where did you pick it up?”

“It’s ‘cause you speak it at home sometimes,” Izuku murmured while looking away, peeking up at him as if he’d interrupt the conversation happening right now. “And I only know a little bit.”

Shouta nearly startled when he heard Izuku refer to their apartment as ‘home’.

Was it really already home to him?

Honestly, he would not fault him if he did see it as home. Shouta was no owl, but even for as minimalistic as he could be, an empty room in an abandoned building was not a good place to live if you could go anywhere else. While he was not as social a creature as Hizashi, even he enjoyed being around people every once in a while. Preferably on the other side of the room while he did paperwork or something.

“You know, learning a new language is much easier as a kid,” Hizashi grinned unabashedly, still chatting with Izuku, “Maybe you’d like to learn some more with me?”

“Can I?” Izuku gasped, eyes shining, “Really?”

“Of course!”

Shouta couldn’t help the burst of fondness he felt for them at that moment. This was what he wanted, he knew. It hadn’t even been a full day since finding out about all of this, but seeing the two of them interact, he knew this was something he didn’t want to let go of.

“Hey, Aizawa-san?” Shouta blinked at the call of his name, looking up from his notepad where he was scribbling down plans for the upcoming days (a meeting with Tsukauchi on the top of that list), “Do you still wanna know about how I got my quirk?”

“If you feel comfortable telling me, then I’d like to know.”

“It’s nothing special,” He shrugged, “But if you want to know, I can tell you.”

It was far from nothing special, but Shouta kept his mouth shut for now. This sort of knowledge, this was the sort of thing he didn’t want to bring up if not necessary. It all depended on what happened to the kid for him to manifest that quirk.

“Remember the alleyway I was hiding in?”

“Yes.”

“I got my quirk in there.”

“In the alleyway?” What could be happening in there that would have forced a quirk manifestation? Or could Izuku truly just be a late bloomer?

“Mhm.”

“Did anything happen in the alleyway?”

“What do you mean?”

“Like…” Shouta hummed, mind spinning to think of kid-friendly ways to describe pain and trauma, “Did you get hurt while there? Did anyone, or anything, hurt you?”

“I was the only one there,” Izuku paused to think, “Oh! There was a rat too.”

“A rat?”

He was starting to get a bad feeling from this.

“Yeah,” He nodded, raising a hand up, fingers held in a way that they looked like claws, “I ate it.”

“You ate it.” Shouta repeated, almost in disbelief, “You ate it.”

“I was hungry, Aizawa-san,” Izuku blinked at him, clearly not seeing anything out of the ordinary here, “I was so hungry and you’re supposed to eat when you get hungry.”

“So you ate it.”

Izuku nodded.

“Please tell me you were an owl when you ate it.”

“I was an owl when I ate it.” Izuku parroted back to him, looking up at Hizashi’s weak laughter.

“You’re completely sure about that, ‘Zuku?” Shouta could see his husband’s grip tighten minutely, a tinge of sadness entering his voice. “One hundred percent sure?”

He could see Izuku’s eyebrows scrunch up at the word 'percent', a puzzled look crossing his face, before it disappeared.

“I’m sure,” Nodding and reaching to pat Hizashi’s face, he cooed. It sounded much more odd coming from human vocal cords, “I remember ‘cause it hurt a lot.”

“So you did get hurt?”

“No?” Izuku sounded confused, “I wasn’t hurt.”

“You said it hurt though.”

“Yeah, but I wasn’t hurt,” He huffed out, “It was using my quirk that hurt.”

“Using your quirk hurts you?”

“It didn’t hurt last night!” Izuku insisted, “Just the first time.”

“Okay, okay,” Shouta cut in before Hizashi could continue his sudden questioning. He really didn’t need either of them to raise their voices any higher, “Let’s start over from the beginning before we go any further. I want to see if I have everything right so far.”

It would also help him either confirm or deny his suspicions regarding Izuku’s quirk manifestation.

He waited for Izuku’s nod before speaking.

“Alright, so you were in the alleyway.”

Another nod.

“You were hungry.”

Yet another nod.

“And then you ate the rat?”

A final nod.

“Izuku, you said that you were hungry, but you also said you ate the rat as an owl,” Shouta hoped, desperately, that his theory on this was wrong, “Before you used your quirk, how were you feeling? What were you thinking?”

“How was I feeling?” Izuku frowned, a few seconds of silence passing between them before he brightened up again, “I know I was really hungry… and I was scared? I was waiting for my Mama for days and I ran out of food really quickly, so I know I was really hungry. Like the kind of hungry that hurts?” He tilted his head waiting for his nod before continuing on, looking rather adorable while speaking of, frankly, horrifying things, “So, I saw the rat and rats are meat, and you know Mama told me to hide. If I was so hungry that it hurt that much, I wouldn’t be able to do what Mama told me to do. ‘Cause if I die, I can’t hide anymore, right?”

Shouta could feel himself nod woodenly, invisible puppet strings jerking his head up and down, his stomach clenching at the nonchalant tone Izuku was using.

“So, I was gonna eat the rat,” Izuku nodded to himself, not noticing Hizashi pale even further, “But when I tried to catch the rat, I turned into an owl.”

So, he was right.

Starvation.

Izuku had gotten so hungry, that the sensation of gnawing hunger had forced his body to manifest a quirk for survival.

“I don’t really remember too much of what happened after that though,” The kid managed to even look apologetic after the retelling of his quirk manifestation, “I just know I left after I learned how to fly.”

“That’s fine,” Shouta reached out, Izuku’s head shoving out to meet his hand once it had gotten into range, “Thanks for telling us.”

He spent a couple of seconds ruffling the curls, watching as Izuku’s eyes slid closed, a small croon audibly leaving his mouth. Hizashi only relaxed slightly at the sound, traces of worry still easily seen in his eyes.

“There’s something else I need to tell you.”

Izuku hummed, nudging his head against his hand still, and Shouta had to bite back a hoarse chuckle. Laughing in any sort of capacity in this situation would only serve to remind him how messed up things turned out to be.

(He also knew that if he cracked, Hizashi would likely follow soon after.)

(His husband was already only a couple steps away from picking Izuku up and never letting him go.)

(He didn’t need to make anything worse.)

They really wouldn’t be able to explain if they both started the waterworks, Izuku not even noticing how fucked up his quirk manifestation sounded to anyone who heard it. It would have to be something they had to revisit at a later date.

“Izuku,” He called, letting his hand slide down to tap at his shoulder, “Can you look at me?”

Izuku did just that, his head tilted once again.

Shouta had a feeling that this was going to be a common sight.

“I want to apologize.”

“To me?” He wrinkled his nose, “But why?”

“Izuku, you have to realize that I put you in a lot of danger with what I asked you to do, yes?”

“I don’t think you did.” Izuku shrugged, fingers reaching to fiddle with one of the loose tassels from a couch pillow. Shouta vaguely remembered lightly scolding a very non-repentant owl for pulling at it until it was sticking out much more than the others.

“Kid, it’s illegal for kids under the age of fifteen to work,” Eyebrows flew upwards at his statement, and Shouta pressed on. He needed Izuku to understand where he was going with this, “What I made you do is hazardous child labor.”

“But you didn’t make me do anything!” What could only be described as a whine escaped Izuku. He almost looked insulted, “I wanted to do it!”

“Izuku,” Shouta made sure to speak calmly, “If I had known you were a kid, I never would have allowed you to do anything of the sort. I would have never even asked in the first place. I would have never even gotten you involved.”

“But I helped,” Izuku hiccupped, lips already wobbly, “I did, right?”

“You did,” He confirmed, “You did help, but that’s not the issue here.”

“I don’t get it,” Accepting a tissue from Hizashi, Izuku’s lips continued to wobble, “If I helped, why do you need to say sorry to me? Helping is a good thing.”

“Do you…” Shouta did his best to not let out the sigh building up in his chest, “Do you remember what I told you about vigilantism?”

“You said that it was getting involved in crime? And you could get arrested for using your quirk for doing a hero’s job.”

It was good to know that Izuku had at least listened to what he spoke to him about earlier on, but that was beside the point.

“Good,” He praised, “Now tell me what you did last night.”

“I was watching your hero mission and then I saw someone aiming at you, so I tried to stop him.”

Shouta raised an eyebrow.

Izuku blinked before he looked up with his eyes wide.

“I did vigilantism!”

That… was not what he was aiming for specifically, but it would have to do until he could get Izuku caught up with other laws.

“Aizawa-san?” He looked up to see tears already welling up, “Am I gonna get arrested?”

“No!” Hizashi blurted out, “No one here is getting arrested!”

“You’re not getting arrested,” Shouta agreed, “There are extenuating circumstances for you.”

“But what about Aizawa-san?” Izuku looked even more distressed at the thought that it was him, Shouta, potentially getting jailed, “And what does ex-te-n-u-a-ting mean?”

“It means that there are reasons that could not be helped in that situation,” He finally let out that sigh, “Kid, I’m an adult. I need to take responsibility for this.”

After all, Izuku had nearly gotten shot last night, the gunman likely only missing its target because of the sheer shock factor that could only be brought by an owl flying into him.

“Aizawa-san has those too!” The kid protested, “I didn’t tell anyone I was a human, so it can’t be Aizawa-san’s fault if he didn’t know.”

“And I still feel awful for it, Izuku,” Awful didn’t even describe how he was feeling about this, but he didn’t need to be so descriptive with his words that it might finally push Izuku into another round of tears, “You’re just a kid.” His voice broke, but he pushed on, “You could have died out there and if you didn’t tag me on the tracker, I wouldn’t even know what had happened.”

Shouta could feel his eyes burn and he shook his head.

He could not lose his composure with the kid here.

“Kid, I just want you to be safe,” Forcing his voice back to it’s previous calm, he held out his hand, palm up, “Do you understand that?”

Shouta was no praying man, but for this, he would pray a thousand times over. So far, Izuku had gotten away with no physical injuries, but he couldn’t count on that to last forever.

He was still a kid.

If Izuku decided to pursue a career in heroics later on, then that was his choice. But right now, there was absolutely no way he could endorse this. Even putting aside the whole child labor issue, if Izuku had gotten injured while out gathering information on his behalf, he would have never been able to forgive himself.

That blood would have been on his hands.

A child should never have to do an adult's job.

And that was what Izuku was.

A child.

Izuku stared at his hand, lips pursed, before wiggling his way out of Hizashi's arms. He traveled the short distance between them, taking his hand into his own smaller one and lightly squeezed it.

"If I promise…,” Izuku gazed up at him, a look of concentration on his face, “If I promise to be super careful and not do any more vigilantism, will you be less sad?”

Shouta could practically hear the coo Hizashi wanted to let out. All he needed to see was the soppy look on his face at Izuku’s words and he knew that his husband wanted to pluck up the child and hug him again.

It was understandable though.

He wanted to do the same.

But what if…?

Carefully lifting their held hands, Shouta brought up his free hand around Izuku’s smaller one and gave it a light squeeze in return.

He didn’t want to scare Izuku off.

It was one thing to bring him back here, but another thing to get him to understand that this could be his home as well.

They already had their emergency foster licenses and he knew that Hizashi had already kickstarted the process for them to become prospective adoptive parents.

It was purely up to Izuku now.

He and Hizashi already knew that they were willing to take Izuku in.

To provide him with a home, raise him, and love him.

But was Izuku willing to allow this?

If Izuku decided not to, well, he didn’t want to think about that.

It was only logical to find out how Izuku felt about staying with them before things could get more complicated. Before Hizashi bought more child-sized clothing and completely redecorated their guest room. Before they both got too attached to the idea of having their son living with them.

(He knew they were both already too attached though, and so he hoped. He hoped that Izuku knew what he meant to them.)

“If you can be careful,” Izuku nodded, “And not roam the streets by yourself.” A head tilt now, “And also stay inside during the night, unless supervised outside, then I would be more than happy.”

He watched Izuku's eyebrows furrow as he quietly repeated what he had just said under his breath.

Had he been too vague?

“Izuku, do you understand what I’m saying?”

Green eyes gazed back at him. Izuku tilted his head again, to the other side, not saying a word, but he could feel a small finger tap twice into his palm.

A ‘no.’

Well, he should have expected that.

Izuku was still only a child and children didn’t exactly learn too much about logical reasoning until later on in life, if ever.

“What I meant was,” He quashed the nervous tingling in his stomach, “I would be really happy if you would stay with us.”

Izuku couldn't believe what had just come out of Aizawa-san’s mouth.

Did he really just hear that?

“Shou!” He turned to see Yamada-san looking at Aizawa-san with wide eyes, his jaw even dropping down, “Are you really asking that now?”

Now?

Did that mean Yamada-san knew that Aizawa-san was going to do this? Ask Izuku to stay with them?

That meant that they had discussed this before! When? During his nap? Before his nap?

They had only known about him being human for less than a day!

How did they manage to agree with each other about this so quickly?

Izuku knew he was just a kid compared to them, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t observant.

Hisashi had talked about it many times. About how having a kid was so expensive and not worth the sheer amount of money it took to bring one up. He wasn’t quite sure if Hisashi was right about it or not, but he knew it did cost money to buy things like food. And Aizawa-san had mentioned before that money could be used to pay for things like water, electricity, and gas. And bills and in-sur-ance.

Izuku could already hunt for his own food and there was water in the lake that he visited sometimes. And he didn’t need gas or electricity because he could see in the dark! And he didn’t need to cook his food! So he supposed that he was a very not-expensive kid. Plus he didn’t take up much space! Maybe that was why Aizawa-san and Yamada-san agreed so quickly on this?

It did make him wonder though; what had brought this on?

Was it because he had flown away when all those explosions happened?

Did Aizawa-san think he got hurt from that and wanted to make sure he was okay?

Or had Aizawa-san just felt bad when he saw Izuku’s roost?

Sure it was a bit empty, but he didn’t really need anything but a safe place to rest in. Owls didn’t exactly need much to have a good life.

It was tempting though.

So tempting.

If he said ‘yes’ to this, that meant he could see Aizawa-san and Yamada-san even more than he already did! He could see them every single day! And Aizawa-san’s Erasure meant that he could give them hugs with his human arms! He would be able to listen to more of Yamada-san’s stories and even learn more English!

…

It was unfair.

How could he refuse something like this?

He liked spending his time with them. Liked it when they treated him so nicely and kept offering him more hugs even if he kept crying on them. And Aizawa-san promised him more jelly pouches as well.

This wasn’t a choice at all.

Not one he could refuse and not feel absolutely awful over, at least.


Was it really so bad to do what he wanted though?

Aizawa-san had never lied to him, ever.

He wouldn’t have offered this at all if he didn’t also want to do this.

It just wouldn’t be logical to offer something he wasn’t prepared for, even if Izuku did manage to be expensive.

And if Aizawa-san was the one who wanted this and Yamada-san agreed with him… Then it should be fine, right?

Because Izuku wanted this.

An actual chance to be with his new family.

It was right there.

All he had to do was say ‘yes.’

“Izuku?”

He’d be making Aizawa-san happy too.

“‘Zuku?”

He liked making Aizawa-san happy.

“Kid?”

He looked up to a pair of worried eyes. Izuku could feel his cheeks warm (how strange was that?); he hadn’t meant to ignore them!

“I was just thinking!”

“Oh?” Aizawa-san hummed, “What kind of thoughts?”

Izuku wondered if he should tell them about his reasoning. It could be a good way to figure out what they really thought about this whole situation. It wasn’t the issue of him not wanting to stay with them (because he did!), it was if they really wanted him to stay with them.

“Are you sure?” He paused to think about the best way to say this, continuing after a couple of seconds of contemplation, “Are you sure you would be happy if I stayed with you?”

“What makes you think I wouldn’t be?”

“Hisashi said that kids are expensive though,” The words fell out of his mouth, surprising even himself, “I mean! You have bills! And you have to buy things for yourself and you need to cook your food on the stove! I’m an owl! I don’t need to have my food cooked and I can catch my own food and I can get my own water outside, but! I just! I can take care of myself already. You don’t need to take care of me. You don’t have to,” He paused, unsure if he should continue, but he pushed himself, knowing he had to, “Not if you don’t want to. Not if you’re not really gonna be happy.”

His voice cracked at the end of his small rant, he coughed and grumbled, turning to find his cup of water only to see it already being offered to him by Yamada-san. He wiggled his hand out of Aizawa-san’s to take the cup with both of his hands, almost dropping it when it didn’t stay in his hands without him focusing on it. It was usually the other way around as an owl. It took more effort to let go of something than to hold onto it. Thankfully, Yamada-san had his hand at the ready and helped him keep it from falling. It would have gotten the couch wet, and he didn’t know how to dry a couch.

“You okay there, kiddo?” Yamada-san looked worried again, “Do you need more water?”

He shook his head, returning the now empty cup back to him. He made sure to only let go once he saw Yamada-san actually hold it.

“Kid,” Aizawa-san called once the cup was placed back onto the table, looking tired again, “Firstly, we’re adults. Managing expenses is what we’re supposed to do. This isn’t something you should worry about.”

“Shou’s right, you know,” Yamada-san nodded, “Plus, do you think Shouta would have offered this if we weren’t sure we could support a kid financially?”

“Financially means with money,” Aizawa-san cut in with a raised eyebrow, “Is that really what you think of me, Izuku?”

“Aizawa-san is too lo-gi-cal to do that,” He carefully sounded out the syllables of the word, wanting to make sure he got it correct. Aizawa-san really liked that word, so he didn’t want to mess it up, “Aizawa-san doesn’t do things that don't make sense.”

Yamada-san stared at him, eyebrows scrunching up before sending Aizawa-san a look. Izuku wasn’t quite sure what kind of look it was, but Aizawa-san did laugh a bit, so it probably wasn’t bad.

“You’ve known me for quite a while now, Izuku, so you know I would never do something I don't mean to wholeheartedly,” Izuku nodded to that, because well, it was true, “So when I offered this, I did so knowing that we'd be taking responsibility for you in every way. I offered this because I wanted to. Because we wanted to."

That made sense. Though it only confirmed what he had already known.

Why was he so hesitant about this?

Was it because if he agreed to stay with them, things could change?

But things already did change. Aizawa-san and Yamada-san knowing about his quirk was a big difference.

Aizawa-san had been so upset that he had asked him to bring him information; he'd probably never ask him to again! Izuku wasn't sure if that would be a good or bad thing. Finding information was really boring a lot of the time, but he liked being helpful. And it wasn't as if he had anything better to do with his time.

But if he couldn't do that anymore, what else was there left to do?

"Kid?"

"I want to," Izuku quickly assured Aizawa-san. He didn't want him to think that he didn't want to stay with them. Because he did! He really did! "I really do! I don't know what will happen after that… What happens to me if I stay with you?"

"I know you don't want me to go get more information and you don't want me to be outside at night alone anymore," He knew he was rambling, but he couldn't stop himself, words just tumbling out, "And I want to stay with you and Yamada-san. I want to! But I'm useless if I'm just at home all night. I don't know what you want me to do instead!"

“Oh, kiddo…” He heard Yamada-san say, but he couldn’t stop the words from leaving his mouth.

“I just, I don’t know how much will change,” He finally admitted, voice lowering back into a croak, “I didn’t really think about what would happen after I told you everything.”

“Of course there will be changes,” Aizawa-san brought a hand up to rub at the back of the neck before dragging the side of his palm down his jaw, “It would be illogical to assume otherwise. But, not all changes are necessarily bad. And I think these can be good if you give them a chance.”

“You really think so?”

“I’ll make sure of it.”

Change was scary.

But, if Aizawa-san and Yamada-san were there with him, then maybe it wasn’t as scary as he thought it might be.

It would be alright if it was the three of them together, right?

He wanted to believe that.

“Izuku,” Aizawa-san looked at him kindly, asking again, “Do you want to stay with us?”

“Yeah.” He replied with no hesitation, tears already welling up in his eyes, “I do.”

“Then that’s all that matters, isn’t it?” Yamada-san spoke as he pressed another tissue into his hand, “We’re more than happy to have you with us, ya know. We’re already family.”

“... And a family sticks together.” Izuku murmured, remembering the photo that still sat on the cabinet by the door, “Through thick and thin, a family sticks together.”

“Right on!”

A small smile made its way onto his lips.

This could work.

It really could.


Notes:

    Izuku > I ate it!
    Shouta + Hizashi > *both knew this from the very beginning but still having a crisis*
    Izuku > :D

    Oh boy! Lots of conversation in this chapter and many realizations! Hizashi would have kept Izuku in his lap for the rest of his chapter if Izuku hadn’t crawled off to try to comfort Shouta xD

    Shouta bemoans that logical reasoning is not something kids instinctively know and understand xD Poor Shouta. Izuku is well on his way though, just by being around you.

    As for Izuku’s quirk manifesting with the trigger of starvation (that Shouta thinks), it’s not true starvation. While the Midoriyas weren’t as well off as the Bakugou’s, for example, Izuku has never gone hungry before. It was a shock to him. And he’s a kid, still growing, body needing those important nutrients. His body really wanted some nutrients…

    This entire conversation was basically Izuku punching both Hizashi and Shouta in the gut multiple times. (Enlisting canon Izuku w/ OFA do to the punching though) xD

    Thanks for reading! Please let me know your thoughts! :D

    Next chapter comes out August 7th! A new day has arrived and Izuku wakes up at home.

Chapter Text

Shouta woke up the next morning to an empty bed.

It was already such a contrast to the previous morning despite it starting the same way.

No sudden noises in the kitchen.

No nightmares.

Just the faint sounds of cars honking and the occasional tweeting of songbirds.

He blinked at the empty spot next to him before remembering that Hizashi had left before the sun had even risen, determined to finish all his paperwork for some new segment of his radio show as soon as he possibly could.

They had business to conduct later this afternoon and it was best that both of them were present. With any luck, their presence would offset any wariness that Tsukauchi's presence in the apartment would bring to Izuku.

There had also been the choice to make the journey to the station together, but Izuku had quickly refused that option once the choices were all laid out on the table. While he didn't like the other option they had gone with either, saying that it would feel like Tsukauchi would be invading his territory, he preferred it over entering an entire building full of police officers.

Shouta wondered how connected those owl instincts were to Izuku. He hadn't seen any signs of quirk activation from the kid during their conversation yesterday, but he wouldn't have been surprised if he had still been too exhausted from the events of the mission. It also helped that Izuku didn't seem to know how to purposely activate his quirk.

It felt like he was caging Izuku in their apartment, in a way. Instead of bars in the windows or locked doors, there was the knowledge that Izuku had no reliable method to use his quirk and thus, couldn't actually leave.

Izuku would inevitably learn more about his quirk; Shouta was willing to help in whatever way he could too. He just hoped that the chance Izuku had given them wouldn't go to waste. This was their chance to show the kid that they could care for him. All they had to do was prove it. Prove that the worries that Izuku had about their offer were unfounded.

(Though he really did regret that conversation months ago regarding money and it's uses in human society. Who would have thought that explaining things like bills and insurance to an owl would have come back to bite his ass?)

It was worrying that Izuku had still pulled on the previous statements of one Midoriya Hisashi though. One would think that with the knowledge of the atrocious acts done by this man’s hands, he would disregard anything that had ever left his mouth.

He went through his morning routine quickly. Though he would have loved to catch another hour or two of sleep, he also knew that was something he couldn’t do right now. Breakfast wasn’t going to prepare itself and considering the time of day it was right now, he wasn’t sure if Izuku would wake up on his own either. The poor kid had pretty much fallen asleep in his bowl of ochazuke and only with some gentle prodding did Hizashi convince him to brush his teeth and then get into bed.

He peeked into the guest room that Izuku now occupied. The curtains were drawn up, sunshine bathing the room in a warm light, but Izuku was still buried under a blanket and sound asleep.

Shouta could feel himself only grow fonder at the sight.

Carefully leaving the door slightly ajar, he made his way into the kitchen. Armed with the advice he had gotten from Recovery Girl’s colleagues, he started on breakfast—miso soup with chicken breast and mushrooms. The additional protein was a must. It was likely that Izuku’s quirk required something as fuel, and protein was the obvious choice for most animal-type transformations.

Izuku’s stomach was likely still sensitive, especially after over a year of just rats and pigeons, supplemented by whatever else may have caught his eyes. He’d have to arrange for a doctor’s appointment eventually just to see what sort of essential vitamins and minerals he might be missing out on.

At first glance, Izuku did look healthy, if a bit too gaunt for his liking. There were still the remains of baby fat on his cheeks, but his ribs were defined enough that he had to stop Hizashi from running out immediately to buy supplements. He supposed spending over a year—nearly two—as an owl brought little to no benefits to actual growth on the human side of things.

Izuku was tiny.

Tensei’s younger brother wasn’t this tiny and they were in the same age group, weren’t they?

Maybe it was just genetics?

Shouta wondered about this as he removed the stems off the mushrooms after washing them, the chicken already cleaned and sitting in it’s own tray.

It didn’t take long before the kitchen was filled with the scents of the kitchen of his childhood. He dissolved a large spoonful of miso paste into the simple soup stock he had already prepared, the mushrooms already having been placed into the pot just a few minutes earlier. Chicken and mushroom was a combination that his mother tended to make when he was sick and couldn’t keep much down. It was nutritious, mostly to easy to digest, and tasty as well. Toast was also a good pick, but they had finished their last loaf yesterday and hadn’t bought more during their short shopping trip either. He lowered the heat to a simmer before returning to the living room to pick up his phone, sending a text to Hizashi.

[10:47] Pick up a loaf of sourdough on your way back? Thanks.

He then returned to the kitchen.

After the chicken breast was carefully placed into the simmering soup, he started clearing up whatever mess was left, leaving a clean cutting board by the stovetop so he could shred the chicken after it was finished cooking. Usually, he’d cube the chicken, but yesterday had proven that Izuku (understandably) had trouble remembering that he had human limbs now, instead of owl ones. Shouta didn’t want to take any chance that he’d forget to chew his food and choke on a piece of chicken. Owls did swallow most of their meals whole after all.

Hizashi would call him paranoid if he saw how much thought had gone into just breakfast. He’d also call him soft. It pained him to say that his husband was not wrong in either of those statements.

He just didn’t want to do something wrong.

Didn’t want to do anything that could do any further harm to his kid.

Izuku deserved a nice life after the clusterfuck that was that game of hide and seek.

It was just that children were a mystery to him. He had even rarely treated Mimizuku as a child, despite knowing the owl was not yet a fully-grown adult. Kids, in general, didn’t like him very much either. Izuku, with the way he tried to stick so close to him, seemed to be one of the few exceptions.

Parenting was proving already to be a very daunting and thought provoking task.

However, Izuku deserved him at his best and that was what Shouta was going to give him.

He would have to purchase some parenting books or find a reliable parenting blog online.

But first, he would have to wake Izuku up for a late breakfast.

As he made his way back to the guest room, which he should really start referring to as Izuku's room, he hoped that waking the kid up wouldn't be any hassle.

When he arrived, he knocked on the door, stepping in after he got no response.

Not that he had expected a response, really.

“Izuku?” He called out as he took the steps to stand next to the side of the occupied bed, “I made breakfast. Time to wake up.”

The kid blinked his eyes open after a few seconds, immediately closing them again and wrinkling his nose as a sunbeam traveled across his face.

Shouta waited for more movement, but it was clear that Izuku had drowsed off again. He leaned down to tug the blanket off, only for Izuku to curl up into a ball, eyes still closed.

"Come on, kid," Leaning down once more, he lightly tapped the tip of Izuku's nose, green eyes slitting open to stare at his finger before closing yet again, "We can do something fun after eating if you want."

This time, Izuku yawned, arms stretching up above him, nearly knocking into the headboard. He rolled onto his stomach, blinking a few times before getting up on wobbly legs, knees bent.

Was he going to jump off the bed?

Shouta caught him by the upper arms before he could even attempt, exhaling audibly with relief when Izuku didn't try to jump anyways.

"Izuku, you're not an owl right now," He quickly switched his grip around, picking him up from under his arms, placing him onto the floor, and then made sure that his feet were firmly planted before letting go, "Don't jump off things until you're fully awake."

Hizashi might actually pour all his coffee down the drain if he came back home to a sprained ankle on the kid. He wanted to avoid that if possible.

"I'm going to go set the table," A light nudge to Izuku's back had him inch forward, "Go brush your teeth. There are extra toothbrushes and disposable cups in the bottom cabinet. Do you remember where the bathroom is?"

Another blink, this time accompanied with an outstretched arm, a finger tapping an answer against his thigh.

'Yes.'

"Alright," Did Izuku forget he could speak again or was he just too tired to focus on speaking with words? "You know where I am if you need me."

‘Yes.’

He nodded and with a parting ruffle of his hair, made his way back to the kitchen. Busying himself with shredding the now cooked chicken, pulling out clean bowls, and dishing out portions of miso soup and white rice, he nearly missed when Izuku emerged from the hallway, still looking half asleep.

Izuku stood there unmoving, a vague look of uncertainty crossing his face, eyes passing from the couch to the chairs at the table and then back again.

"You can sit at the table," He carefully made sure no mushrooms were in Izuku's portion of soup. While they were nutritious and all, they weren't as easy on the stomach compared to everything else. "I'm almost done."

Shouta couldn't hear a reply but a quick turn of his head showed him that Izuku was climbing into a chair. There was an inkling of worry that he would somehow topple the chair over or fall off, but he was glad his paranoia, in this case, was unfounded.

He returned his focus to plating up their meal, placing the bowls of soup and rice on serving trays along with spoons and pairs of chopsticks. The distance from the kitchen to the table was short, thankfully, and before he knew it, his feet took him straight there, trays in hand. Izuku looked more awake now, eyes bright and staring curiously at what was on the tray placed in front of him.

“Miso soup with chicken and mushrooms and white rice,” Shouta hoped that it was to Izuku’s taste. He didn’t exactly know what the kid would like, so he had gone with something basic that nearly everyone he knew enjoyed and had often. “I took the mushrooms out of yours. Since we don’t know how sensitive your stomach is after switching from digesting uncooked… rats, to something cooked, at least.”

Last night’s ochazuke had been served lukewarm and as far as he could tell, Izuku had only managed a few spoonfuls of it before nodding off at the table. He seemed alright, Shouta thought. And while he wasn’t an expert in children’s health, it didn’t take an expert to look at a child and determine if they had been sick recently. Probably.

“How’s your stomach feeling?”

It was only logical to ask him. If Izuku didn’t feel too well, Shouta could just put together a plain okayu instead.

Izuku stared down at his stomach, eyes not even blinking as he did so. After a few seconds, he nodded, looking satisfied and returning his gaze to the food, giving him a thumbs up.

“Good,” Shouta was glad. Izuku didn’t need digestion issues on top of everything else he already had to deal with. “If you start to feel unwell, let me know right away, alright?”

‘Yes.’

This time, it was tapped against the edge of the table.

Shouta placed down his own tray, taking a seat across from Izuku. He clapped his hands together, a smaller set of hands clapping half a beat behind.

Itadakimasu

It was a pleasant surprise to hear Izuku’s voice join his, the kid even looking the part after realizing that he did indeed speak out loud.

“Remember to chew your food,” He quickly reminded Izuku who was already holding his spoon in a focused grip, “Please.”

“I will,” Izuku managed, though his eyes were still glued to the bowl of soup, “Promise.”

Shouta hummed his acknowledgement, though he still planned on keeping an eye on him. It was why he chose to sit across from Izuku, after all. He watched as Izuku took his first spoonful, a small amount of trepidation in chest.

Would he like it?

Would he not?

Hizashi liked his cooking, but he was his husband; it was practically required for him to like it. But Izuku? No matter how much he saw the kid as his own, this was new territory for them both.

“It’s tasty, Aizawa-san,” Izuku’s eyes were glassy, though he quickly blinked them away, “Like Mama used to make.”

Shouta could feel the tips of his ears burn, relief sinking into him at the same time.

“I’m glad, kid,” He averted his gaze, the tiniest of smiles perking up the corners of his lips, “Eat up.”

“Mhm!”

Breakfast was delicious.

It might have been simply rice and miso soup, but it was also something he hadn’t had for such a long time. The miso soup brought back memories of his Mama’s soup, and though he knew that the ingredients in it were not the same, (his Mama preferred tofu and napa cabbage), it gave him the same warm feeling when having it.

He had asked his Mama once before about what she added into her miso soup to make it so much better than the soup they served at daycare for lunch.

She had told him that the secret ingredient was ‘love’, saying that she did her best to make it every morning because she loved him and wanted to watch him grow up healthy and strong.

Did this mean that Aizawa-san had put ‘love’ into his miso soup as well?

It was possible.

Was he going to ask?

Not a chance.

It sounded silly even in his head.

Izuku quickly followed up the sip of miso soup with a spoonful of rice, making sure to chew properly. He had promised after all.

The rice was warm and fluffy. Izuku never thought he’d miss having rice, but now that he had had some, he found that he did. He returned his attention to the miso soup though, (it really was delicious), alternating between sips of soup with shredded chicken and bites of rice.

Maybe when they were sure his stomach wasn’t sen-si-tive, he could ask Aizawa-san to make tamagoyaki as well! Izuku felt fine so far, but he was glad that his bowl had less rice than Aizawa-san’s bowl. He was already starting to feel full.

“Just ask if you want seconds,” Izuku looked up to Aizawa-san who was already finished eating, standing with his tray in hand, “I wasn't sure how much you wanted, but there’s plenty.”

He shook his head.

There was no way he would be able to finish another bowl of anything. Aizawa-san was nice for offering though. Maybe once he got better with not dropping things accidentally, he'd be allowed to help out in the kitchen. It would be a way he could thank Aizawa-san for asking him to stay here. He had only dropped his spoon twice so far, so that was a really good start compared to yesterday and the bar of soap. An improvement already!

Speaking was still proving to be something he had some difficulties with though. It wasn't that he couldn't, it was just easy to forget he could, despite knowing he was a human right now. He had been using the tapping system with Aizawa-san for so long that it felt more natural to use it if it was a question that could be answered that way.

He still wanted to speak though. Tapping didn't exactly allow him to ask his own questions, and he had so many things he wanted to know. Talking more would have to be something he focused on. He knew he would have to eventually. Detective Tsu-ka… hat-man was supposed to come over today and he knew that he would have to apologize at the very least. Biting people wasn’t very polite.

Sliding out of the chair when he had taken the last sip of soup, he carefully picked up the tray the bowls were on.

Right. Left. Right. Left.

He marched himself to the kitchen where Aizawa-san was at the sink, already washing the bowls used.

"I finished," Lifting it up a bit higher, he slid the tray onto the counter, though the chopsticks did fall to the floor, "Oops."

He quickly picked them up, offering them to Aizawa-san who had turned at his voice.

The chopsticks were accepted with a nod and grunt. It was Aizawa-san’s way of saying 'thank you' when he was tired. Izuku had heard it many times before, so he nodded back. He really wasn't sure what to do next though. Should he go back to the table? Go to the living room and wait for Aizawa-san to finish washing things?

He must have looked really confused or something because Aizawa-san then spoke up.

"You can wait for me in the living room," He turned away, rag back in hand scrubbing away at a bowl, "Figure out what you want to do and we can spend some time with your choice of activity before Hizashi gets back."

Izuku nodded, excited as ideas raced in his head. As he walked to the living room, he thought of all the things he wanted to do. Maybe he could ask Aizawa-san to read to him? It was probably better to wait for Yamada-san to come back for that though. He did the voices better.

Or he could finally work on his hero notebook! He could finally add Eraserhead and Present Mic into it! There was still a lot he didn’t know how to write, and it really didn’t help that he hadn’t gone to daycare for such a long time, but he could probably ask Aizawa-san for help with that.

Izuku passed the couch in the living room, heading back to the guest room. If he remembered correctly, Aizawa-san had told him last night, before he actually fell asleep, that it was now his room. That he could treat it as his new roost. So he guessed he was heading to his room and not just the guest room.

He turned the knob of the door, pushing it open.

Now where had he left his backpack last night?

It was in the room, somewhere.

He stepped in a bit further, turning a full circle, hoping that he’d be able to spot it quickly. Aizawa-san was still washing things, but he could be finished any time now! Izuku didn’t want to make him wait in the living room by himself. Luckily, he noticed it sitting on the floor next to the bookshelf.

The bookshelf, itself, was empty of books, but that just meant there was plenty of space for other things.

(Maybe he would be able to get books to put on the shelves. He’d like that.)

Unzipping his backpack, he slid out the notebook that was inside. He took a few seconds just to stare at the cover. On the top right corner, written in his Mama’s neat print, was his name.

Was it strange that he didn’t even want to touch it?

What if he ruined it?

He really didn’t want to do that.

His Mama had been gone for a while now.

He wouldn’t be able to ask her to write his name on things anymore.

Maybe it was best if he just… didn’t touch his hero notebook.

Carefully, he slid the notebook onto the shelf in front of him. He wished that he had a better place for it, one where he knew it would be kept safe, but as long as he was careful, it should be fine, right?

He then pulled out the copy of the family registry he had, setting it on the shelf as well.

Admittedly, he didn’t know if it was important or not, but it had to have some sort of meaning to it if his Mama had packed it into his bag. He’d have to ask Aizawa-san later if he needed it for anything.

Finally, he picked up his backpack by the straps, plopping it on the opposite end of the shelf his notebook was in.

Clink

What could have made that sound?

The metal zipper pull?

As he took hold of the zipper pull and knocked it against the wood of the shelf a couple of times, just to check, he heard something else.

“Izuku?” He turned to see Aizawa-san standing at the entrance of his room, a puzzled look in his eyes, "What…?"

"Nothing!" Dropping the pull, he took a step away from the shelf, "Actually, um, I have a question."

“Go ahead.”

“Do you have notebooks?”

“Oh?” His eyes flit over to the shelf, “Isn’t that a notebook right there?”

“Yeah, but,” Izuku looked away, not wanting to see the kind of look that would be on Aizawa-san’s face, “My Mama wrote my name on that one.”

And he would really really like to not use that notebook. He hoped Aizawa-san would understand that.

“Kid,” He heard Aizawa-san sigh after a few seconds of silence between the two of them, “Yeah, I’ve got notebooks.”

A couple of steps and Aizawa-san was now in front of him; his taller body was hard to miss, even if he wasn’t looking directly at him. A hand landed on his head, ruffling his hair. Izuku couldn’t stop the small smile from appearing on his lips.

“Come on,” Aizawa-san’s hand slipped off his head, travelling down to his shoulder, giving it a pat as well, before returning to its owner, “I’ll get you your notebook and you can tell me about what you want it for.”

He left the room after that, crossing the hallway and opening the door to another room. Izuku quickly hurried after him, curious as to what room that was.

“This is the office,” Aizawa-san started speaking as soon as he peeked his head into the room, “Well, we call it that, but it’s mostly used for storage.”

“If Hizashi brings home his work, he tends to use the kitchen table,” He crossed the room, getting onto his knees to pull out a large cardboard box that was under the wooden desk that occupied the furthest corner from the door, “And you know I like to do my work in the living room.”

Izuku nodded. He did notice that Aizawa-san spent most of his time in the living room whenever he had his laptop out, but he had assumed that it was because he, as Mimizuku, spent all his time there and Aizawa-san wanted to be sure that he didn’t poke holes in the couch cushions or something. (Not that he would! Not on purpose, at least!)

Aizawa-san opened the box. Izuku stepped closer to see what could be in there, unable to contain his curiosity.

Inside the box was a mess of supplies. Notebooks, packs of pens and pencils, and also erasers. There were even pads of sticky notes!

“We were planning to use this room as an office when we moved in,” One of the notebooks was taken out and handed to him, “Hizashi even went and bought a bunch of things he thought were ‘office-like.’ We never really ended up using a lot of it though, so we just left it in here just in case we needed it eventually.”

Aizawa-san pulled out a few pencils as well, plucking out an eraser not too soon after. He dug his hand into the box, pulling out a glue stick (which went right back into the box), a pair of scissors (which he placed on the desk), and a box of paper clips (also back into the box) before pulling out a small pencil sharpener.

“Come on,” He got back onto his feet and left the room, waiting at the door, a finger beckoning at him, “I need to show you something real quick.”

Once he had exited the room, Aizawa-san closed it behind them.

“So that was the office,” He stepped further down the hallway to the room at the end, tapping the eraser end of the pencil against the door, “This one is mine and Hizashi’s bedroom. If you need us and we're in there, knock before entering, alright?”

Izuku nodded.

"Good," Aizawa-san gave him a kind look, lightly patting the top of his head as he walked by, heading down the hallway, "Come on. Living room now."

His shorter legs really were no match compared to Aizawa-san's long ones. He had to take at least two steps to cover the distance of one of Aizawa-san’s strides. But maybe if he ate all his vegetables (now that he could), he'd be as tall as Aizawa-san one day?

He entered the living room, notebook in hand. Aizawa-san was already seated on the couch. He was sharpening the pencils, taking the sharpened end out every few seconds before putting it back in to continue sharpening. Every time he deemed one sharp enough, he placed it on the table, picking up another unsharpened one and repeating his actions.

Izuku sat himself down on the rug, placing the notebook onto the table as well. He picked up one of the sharpened pencils, holding it very carefully. He was relatively sure that he wouldn't break it, but it never hurt to check. Too many pencils had been snapped in half by his talons for him to let up on checking.

To his delight, the pencil held strong.

He hummed as he thought about what to do first. His older hero notebook only had All Might in it. He had drawn the hero and written down as much as he could about him. There were also many pages where he just drew the villains he saw All Might fight against on the television. There were even more pages where he just put down how cool he thought All Might was.

It was different now.

He still thought All Might was really cool.

It was just that… Eraserhead was even cooler. Eraserhead was his hero. Just like how Aizawa-san was his hero as well!

So, it only made sense that the first page in this notebook would be for Eraserhead.

And next would definitely be Present Mic! Yamada-san was really nice and he didn’t doubt that Present Mic was also really cool, even though he’s still never really seen him in action.

“So what are you planning on doing with the notebook?” Aizawa-san asked as he placed down the final sharpened pencil on the table.

“A hero notebook,” Izuku carefully opened the notebook to the first page, before flipping it back to the cover, “I think heroes are really cool; quirks too!” And that was still true, but if he really thought about it, the reason why he started his first notebook was…, “And back then, I didn’t have my quirk yet, and the doctor said I’d never get one…”

“But! I still wanted to be a hero, you know?” He turned, looking up at Aizawa-san, wanting him to understand, “Even though Mama didn’t think I could be one, I still wanted to try. So I started a hero notebook. I thought if I learned more about other hero’s quirks, how they used them and things like that, then maybe it wouldn’t matter if I didn’t have one.”

“You took initiative,” Aizawa-san started, clearing his throat before continuing, “You took initiative when you knew you were at a disadvantage compared to your peers. And you were what, four? When this happened?” Izuku nodded; it was one of his clearest memories even now, “It’s more than any other four year old that I know would do.”

“I want to keep doing it,” Izuku admitted, “I have a quirk now, but I really liked working on my hero notebook.”

“Nothing’s stopping you from doing it. It’s a good skill to nurture, especially if you still plan on going into heroics when you get older.”

Izuku made a noncommittal sound as he flipped the notebook open to the front page again, thinking about what he wanted to do in the future. He still wanted to be a hero, that was certain. He just didn’t think he could be like All Might with his quirk though. But that was alright, wasn’t it?

He loved his quirk.

This quirk that had saved his life and kept him hidden for so long, it would be nice if he could save lives with it.

Aizawa-san had said he was just a kid though. Multiple times. So this wasn’t something he had to decide right now. At this moment, he was more than happy to just spend time with Aizawa-san and Yamada-san being a kid. He wasn’t quite sure if the time he spent as an owl counted for that, so he had lots to catch up on.

He wrote his name on the inside cover, frowning when the result looked all crooked.

Erase, erase, erase.

Yeah.

A lot to catch up on.

But maybe?

“Aizawa-san?” Izuku turned to tap at the leg next to him, “Could you write my name on the cover for me?”

His Mama wouldn’t be able to do it anymore, but he had Aizawa-san now, right?

And he knew Aizawa-san.

Trusted Aizawa-san.


He could grow to love Aizawa-san.

“Sure, kid,” Aizawa-san leaned over, pulling out a pen from out of a mug, “Your whole name?”

His whole name: Midoriya Izuku.

After so long of only thinking of himself as ‘Izuku’ and then responding to ‘Mimizuku’, thinking of himself as ‘Midoriya’ again was odd. It didn’t sound wrong, but he didn’t like it as much. It was the name his Mama had, but it was also the name Hisashi had shared with her, and then also him as well.

He didn’t want to be connected to Hisashi in this way.

“Izuku,” He nodded after making his decision, “Just Izuku.”

Aizawa-san wrote his name neatly on the cover.

He couldn’t help but think, it looked nothing like his Mama’s writing.

But that was alright, wasn’t it?

It was written by someone who cared for him and that was what mattered here.

Izuku was sure that his Mama would think the same.

He thanked Aizawa-san with a nod, to which Aizawa-san only nodded back at him. (It was like a nodding language!)

Opening the notebook, yet again, he picked up his pencil.

Just as he was about to place the tip of the point to the paper, he heard the unmistakable sound of a keys jingling. A few seconds later, the door opened. He looked up, smelling something really nice in the air. What could it be?

“I’m home!” Yamada-san called out from the entranceway, “I’ve got the bread!”

It was bread!

“Welcome home,” Aizawa-san replied, though much less louder than Yamada-san.

“I’ve got a watermelon too!” Yamada-san enthusiastically entered the living area with a large cloth bag slung over his shoulder, “Check it out!”

“You what.”

“It was on sale and it’s watermelon season,” A grin was directed at Aizawa-san, “Izuku deserves a watermelon.”

He could feel his eyes widen as Aizawa-san sighed.

“You can’t use that excuse for everything, you know.”

“Or so you say.”

”’Zashi.”

Izuku couldn’t stop his giggles as Yamada-san laughed, placing the bag down onto the kitchen counter.

“You think that’s funny, kid?” Aizawa-san’s words seemed mean, but Izuku knew better to judge by that alone by now.

“Mhm,” He continued to giggle, “Yeah.”

He could see the small grin on Aizawa-san’s face.

This would work out.

Izuku was sure of it.

“Hey, Aizawa-san?”

“Yeah?”

“How do you write ‘Eraserhead’?”

Chapter 21: Interlude: Chapter 21: Naomasa
Notes:

    Chapter Warnings: N/A

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

Tsukauchi Naomasa was a busy man.

But he also liked to think he was a considerate man as well.

And that was why he was standing on the doorstep of a coworker (of sorts) instead of dealing with his sizable mountain of paperwork back at his desk.

It had been a hectic twenty four hours, to say the least, and his paperwork reflected that. His lack of any good sleep did too.

This was something he had to do though. The police had failed Midoriya Izuku enough, and Naomasa refused to allow it to happen again.

However strong his convictions might be, it didn't stop him from being nervous. Midoriya Izuku may just be a child, and a traumatized child at that, but he had still been a child attempting to bite him. Naomasa really didn't want a repeat of that.

Eraserhead, or Aizawa, as he insisted on being called while off duty, had mentioned in a text that the kid was "very well-mannered and polite, if a bit oblivious on topics for polite company."

And frankly, he had no idea what that even meant.

He was undoubtedly about to find out though.

As he rapped his knuckles against the unassuming door, he took in a deep breath. Aizawa had requested he not wear a hat, oddly enough. He wasn't sure how the man knew of his plans to wear one on this excursion, but it was a simple enough request and one that had no bearing on what the conversations to be had would bring, so he acquiesced. (It did make his head feel a bit bare though.)

It didn’t take long for the door to crack open, a familiar and tired face staring blankly at the top of his head before nodding, the crack of the door widening into a space that he could actually enter.

“Aizawa,” He greeted, “Always a pleasure.”

“If you say so,” Aizawa stepped aside, beckoning him in, “Sorry for making you come all this way.”

“It was for the kid’s comfort, right?,” Naomasa stepped in, toeing his shoes off, swapping them for a pair of guest slippers, “Sorry for the intrusion.”

An affirmative grunt was his reply.

Ah. Eraser. Never change.

Speaking of the kid though, he could hear voices from further into the apartment. One noticeably louder than the other.

“Do you have a guest over?”

Aizawa turned to look at him, eyes feeling like they could bore into his soul.

“My husband.”

He couldn’t help the surprised twitch of his eyebrows, his quirk telling him that it was the truth. That was something he hadn’t expected of the surly and serious pro hero he had gotten to know over the last year or so. He doubted anyone who wasn’t in the know could have guessed something like that.

“My lips are sealed.”

“Good.”

Aizawa gave him another look and for a split second, Naomasa knew how it felt to be under the scrutiny of a fiercely protective Underground Hero. He had a feeling that if any news concerning the home life of Eraserhead surfaced any time soon, his door would be the first one knocked on and then possibly broken through.

“Head on to the kitchen table,” Aizawa gestured to the left side of the entryway, fingers flicking back, “I’ll go fetch them.”

Nodding, he took his first proper step into Aizawa’s home, only for a photograph to catch his eye. In it, Eraser was smiling. That was enough reason for anyone to pause and take it in.

It seemed to be a family photo consisting of Eraser, a blond male (who had to be the husband) and a familiar owl. The blond also jiggled his memory. Something about that shade of yellow…

He shrugged, continuing on. There was no use in straggling behind; it’d only get Aizawa cross at him and well, he would prefer if he could keep their work relationship amiable.

The kitchen itself was brightly lit and tidy, pots and pans all in order. He sat himself down in one of the chairs, silently taking in the sheer neatness of the space. Eraserhead looked scruffy even on the best of nights, but apparently his kitchen was the complete opposite? Was one of his logical ploys at play here? Surely the man wasn’t trying to psych him out with a clean kitchen. That made no sense.

“Where’s his hat?”

The whispered voice brought Naomasa out of his musing and he blinked, his attention now directed on the small child who was almost attached to Aizawa’s leg. Confused green eyes were searching the top of his head, as if waiting for a hat to appear on his head.

Aizawa had the look of a vaguely bemused cat on his face, a smirk tugging on his lips.

“Can’t be a hat-man without a hat, now can he?”

Was he missing something?

“He’s just a man now.”

The child–presumably the very not-dead Midoriya Izuku–finished, an odd look on his face.

“I’m Tsukauchi Naomasa, a police detective,” When in doubt, just introduce yourself, “It’s nice to finally meet you, Midoriya-kun.”

Silence.

“I’m Yamada Hizashi!” A bright laugh and grin was then shot in his direction, probably saving them all from the forced awkwardness of that interaction, “You can call me Yamada!”

It was the blond from the photo. Eraser’s husband.

“It’s a pleasure.” A polite smile was sent back.

It wasn’t just that hair, but that voice sounded familiar as well.

Where had he heard it before?

“... Midoriya Izuku,” A small voice followed up a few seconds afterwards, “But call me Izuku.”

“Alright,” He allowed his smile to loosen up a bit; it was no good if he scared the kid, again, “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Izuku-kun.”

“C’mon, ‘Zuku,” Yamada ushered a clearly reluctant Midoriya to an empty chair, pulling out another to sit right next to the kid, “Let’s sit!”

Aizawa only sighed, heading over to the counter where there was a coffee machine, the carafe already filled to the brim.

“Can I get you anything to drink, Tsukauchi?” He asked as he poured out some coffee into a mug, “Hizashi? Izuku?”

“Coffee, please.” He had a feeling that he was going to need it, “Black.”

“Water for me!”

“Water for me too, please.”

Another grunt.

It seemed that communication with grunts was an actual thing Eraser did not just as a pro hero, but in his domestic life as well. Both Yamada and Midoriya seemed unphased by the behavior, which only supported his thoughts.

“Coffee.”

A small thunk accompanied the word, a mug of steaming coffee placed in front of him.

“And water.”

Yamada accepted the glass from Aizawa with a smile, the second glass being placed on the table in front of Midoriya.

“Thank you, Aizawa-san.”

The kid gave a small smile to Aizawa, his hands twisting in front of him, only stopping when Aizawa patted him on the head, pulling up another seat so that he was also seated next to Midoriya.

Was it anxiety he was seeing?

The image presented in front of him and the impression he had gotten a day and a half ago in the field were almost bone-chillingly different. Objectively, he knew that this was the same child that would have successfully bitten him, if not for his coat being in the way. But other than that, that sharp panicked edge that he had that night was gone, leaving behind a nervous kid that didn’t want to even face in his direction.

It was rare that he had the opportunity to work with kids, but the few kids he had met on the job, had never looked at him like this before. Or to be more accurate, they usually looked at him.

Eraser hadn’t told him much about the situation, just texted him regarding documents or records he wanted him to try to obtain. He had mentioned that Midoriya didn’t really trust the police, but he hadn’t thought it was going to be as bad as the text had made it seem.

He was wrong.

It was bad.

And worse?

It was understandable.

After what he had found out regarding the entire Midoriya case and how it was handled? Suffice to say, Midoriya had every reason to not think highly of any member of the police force again. But while he may not be able to change what had happened in the past, he would take this chance offered to bring this child justice.

It wasn’t right, what had happened to the family.

“Um, ha-I mean, Tsu-ka-u-chi-san?” Midoriya spoke slowly, separately sounding out the syllables of his name, gaze flitting up presumably to watch for his reaction, “Sorry for biting you. It was rude.”

“No harm, no foul, Izuku-kun,” He acknowledged the apology with a nod, “Just try not to do that again, alright?”

Midoriya shrugged, a noncommittal hum being his only reply to him. Yamada looked appropriately shocked at this while Aizawa’s face was mostly blank, the only giveaway being a small upward twitch of his lips.

He knew that Aizawa had only had custody of Midoriya for only about twenty four hours, maybe even less than that, but it was abundantly clear that he was who Midoriya chose to emulate in behavior. It was a pity that it wasn’t Yamada that the child had chosen; he seemed much more personable. But, in the end, Naomasa was just glad the child was safe and not on the streets anymore. That was really all he could ask for.

Picking up the mug of coffee, he took a sip of the liquid. It was good. Very good. It would probably completely spoil break room coffee for him. And that was less good, but it wasn't as if he drank coffee for the taste. All he needed was caffeine. Coffee just happened to be the perfect receptacle for that.

He placed it back down.

It was time to do what he came here to do.

"I'm unsure as to what Aizawa has already told you about this situation," He was careful to keep his voice neutral, "But, Izuku-kun, do you know why I'm here?"

"Aizawa-san says that you can make it so I don't have to stay with Hisashi if he tries to get me back."

A truth. Huh, maybe his work relationship with Eraser was not as bad as he thought it might be now.

"Well, I do have some good news on that front," Midoriya perked up, straightening in his seat, "Midoriya Hisashi didn't contest the contents of Midoriya Inko's will regarding you when it was executed."

"What's a will?" Midoriya looked to Aizawa and then to Yamada, "Is it good?"

"It's a legal document that declares someone's wishes upon their death," Aizawa summarized with a patient tone, "Usually deals with property and if there are children that aren't of legal age, their guardianship."

"What did my Mama's will say?" This time, the question was directed towards him, "You said it was good news, so does that mean my Mama didn't want Hisashi to take me?"

"In a nutshell, your mother tried to prevent Midoriya Hisashi from gaining custody of you after her passing," Naomasa delicately said, "However, without a divorce, it is usually extremely difficult to prevent custody of children from falling to the surviving parent."

He could see Yamada's lip curl, though he said nothing aloud.

"But in this case, Midoriya Hisashi did not want custody, so Midoriya Inko's will was carried out."

Midoriya did not look fazed at all hearing that his father did not want custody of him, only breathing out in relief.

"Wait, wait," Yamada interrupted, "If she deemed her husband unworthy, or whatever, of Izuku's custody, then did she appoint someone to take over the guardianship of the kid?"

"She didn't," Naomasa admitted, "Usually then the court would appoint one. A member of the extended family or along those lines. Midoriya Inko didn't have any family on record though."

"How was this still going on when Izuku was already pronounced dead?" Aizawa frowned, "It takes months for something like this to follow through."

Ah.

He should have known Aizawa would have picked that up.

"You're right," A sigh followed his statement, "This happened months after the reported deaths. Midoriya Hisashi didn't contest the issue of Izuku-kun's custody, likely because there was no child to even have the custody of. What he did contest was the part of the will where she tried cutting him out entirely in favor of leaving everything to Izuku-kun."

"He won," Midoriya's voice cracked as he spoke, "Didn't he?"

"He did," Naomasa lowered his gaze, sympathy lacing his tone, "I'm sorry, Izuku-kun."

"So he has everything but Izuku then," Yamada's eyes were flinty, "Do we know if he'll try taking custody of Izuku if he finds out that he’s not dead?"

"It's on record that he doesn't want custody of Izuku-kun, so it's unlikely," Naomasa hummed, "But he may try contesting. I don't know."

"What if he did something bad?" Midoriya asked, eyes shining with something hard, "Like, what if he's a bad person?"

"In that case, I'm legally required to tell you that my quirk, Lie Detector, allows me to differentiate between truth and lies," He recited the words from memory, doing his best to not sink too far into his professional persona, "May I record what you tell me?"

"Record?" Midoriya echoed back.

"The recording will be usable in court to some degree if you or he chooses to pursue this further."

Green eyes immediately looked over to Aizawa, who only gave a small nod. Midoriya took in a breath and exhaled, intertwining his fingers with Yamada’s and tugging their hands off of the table. Yamada smiled encouragingly, leaning over to whisper something in Midoriya’s ear, ignoring Aizawa’s stare in their direction. Midoriya looked thoughtful.

For a moment, he wondered what words Yamada had passed onto Midoriya, but before he could start thinking too hard about it, Midoriya spoke.

“It’ll help if you record it, right?”

“It will,” He concurred, “I’m sure of it.”

“Then, okay,” The kid nodded at him, “You can record it.”

“Thank you, Izuku-kun,” Naomasa pulled out the voice recorder he kept in his jacket, “I'll make sure this is put to good use.”

He quickly began his check-up routine for the device, making sure it would work as intended.

“And you consent for Aizawa and Yamada to be present during this interview?”

“Yeah, of course,” Midoriya gave him a slightly puzzled look, “Why wouldn’t they be?”

“Because this is your interview and you are a child,” His voice recorder was placed onto the table, “And these interviews have to be in your best interests.”

A blink.

“That means that I have to consider your age, current circumstances, and also the length and nature of the relationship you have with Aizawa and Yamada before it even starts,” Naomasa explained patiently, “It also means I have to be certain you understand what is being asked of you every step of the way.”

“Aizawa-san treats me better than Hisashi ever did,” Midoriya grumbled near waspishly, “Yamada-san, too. I want them to stay.”

He nodded, stomach slightly sinking, knowing that it was the truth that Midoriya had said.

“Alright,” He didn’t think Midoriya would have asked them to leave anyway, but he had to ask, just in case, “I also need you to know that you must verbally reply to questions. If you need a break any time during this, that can also be arranged.”

“Is it ‘cause of your quirk?” Green eyes brightened up, “You need to hear someone speaking to know.”

“That is one reason, but this is just a voice recorder,” Naomasa shifted it in a circle, showing all the sides of the device to him, “No camera. It wouldn’t record anything if you just nod or shake your head.”

“If we were doing a proper interview at the station, it would be a video recording,” He slotted in a memory card; the extra memory couldn’t hurt, “But especially due to your circumstances, it… would be better to just stay here and do an audio recording.”

Midoriya nodded, eyes wandering over to Aizawa again, their gazes meeting. And to Naomasa’s surprise, the man’s expression softened, eyes crinkling and all, while Midoriya let out a smile.

He could see it then.

Aizawa and Yamada would go to the ends of the earth to protect the child under their care.

Naomasa almost felt bad that he had to interrupt this admittedly cute moment between them, but he did have to get back to his paperwork soon and him staying for hours would feel as if he were infringing on Aizawa’s hospitality.

“Are you ready to start?” He asked, finger hovering over the button.

“Yes.”

“Alright.”

Click

“This is Police Detective Tsukauchi Naomasa of the Musutafu Police Station. Today’s date is June 15, 2X23. The current time is 14:33. I am here with Midoriya Izuku-kun, and his current emergency foster guardians, Aizawa Shouta-san and Yamada Hizashi-san in an undisclosed location,” He rattled off the necessary starting information and then nodded at the group of three across the table, “Please, introduce yourselves.”

“Aizawa Shouta. Pro hero, Eraserhead.”

“Yamada Hizashi. I’m the pro hero, Present Mic.”

What.

“I’m Midoriya Izuku.”

Naomasa had to shove away his surprise at the new information, though he was unable to stop himself from sneaking a glance at the bright blond locks of hair that did match what he knew of Present Mic.

“Can I have your date of birth, Izuku-kun?”

“Um, that’s like a birthday, right? It’s July, on the fifteenth.”

“Do you know what year you were born in?”

“I don’t remember it, but…” Midoriya paused to think, “I think I have it in my room. I can go get it and show you if you want.”

“That would be great, Izuku-kun.”

He nodded and watched as Midoriya slid out of his seat, untangling his fingers out of Yamada’s and trotted into the living room and down a hallway.

It was a bit awkward, sitting in the silence that permeated the kitchen. Protocol demanded that interviews like these stay on topic with minimal interruptions, so it wasn’t as if he could do anything until Midoriya was back.

Thankfully, it did not take long for Midoriya to return, a laminated piece of paper in his hand.

“It says I was born on July 15th of 2X15, see?”

The paper was offered to him and he accepted it with a small ‘thanks’.

To his surprise, what was handed to him was a family register. He nodded as his mind raced to think on how Midoriya even had this, but that was irrelevant for what the topic of the interview was, so it could wait.

He slid the family register across the table back towards Midoriya, who was now seated again.

"Alright, let's begin. What can you tell me about Midoriya Hisashi, Izuku-kun?"

"He's a bad person and I think he killed my Mama."

"... Truth," Naomasa voiced out what his quirk told him, stomach sinking, "Can you tell me more about this?"

"I… I wasn't there when it happened, when Mama died," Midoriya started nervously, his fingers fiddling with Yamada's proffered hand, "But I heard the neighbors say she died because of fire. That Mama burned to death."

Naomasa nodded, remembering the report he had read over before contacting Aizawa the other day.

“Hisashi’s quirk is called… Dragon’s Breath,” He could see Midoriya gulp, a flash of teeth worrying against his lip before he breathed out again, “It lets him breathe fire out of his mouth.”

“Truth,” The usage of a fire-type quirk instead of a spontaneous combustion made much more sense, “The quirk can be confirmed by the family register.”

Now that this information was known to him, the aftermath of the recent Trigger bust… Well, a traumatized child trying to bite him was the least that could have happened.

“Can you tell me a bit more about the relationship between Midoriya Hisashi and Midoriya Inko?”

Midoriya nodded, eyes flashing with something he almost couldn’t recognize as unease.

“Mama really loved Hisashi.”

The statement rang as the ‘truth’. And while a declaration of love usually gave him a warm feeling, this time, he couldn’t help but to feel pity.

“Mama loved me too,” Midoriya added abruptly, voice insisting, “She did.”

Naomasa could only nod, doing his best to encourage him to continue speaking.

“Hisashi didn’t like me though and they would argue about me sometimes when Mama thought I wasn’t listening,” He paused, a distressed look in his eyes, “I don’t remember a time where I ever liked him or he liked me. But I had Mama and she loved me, so it was alright.”

“And it wasn’t even because I was Quirkless.” Midoriya murmured, his voice croaking, fingers grasping for his cup on the table. Yamada reached out to pull it closer to him. A small smile was offered to Yamada before he took some sips of water. His knuckles were visibly white, and while Naomasa did feel bad at dredging up some clearly distressing memories, it had to be done if he was to protect the future of this family.

“Before Mama even brought me to the doctor who said I was Quirkless, he never liked me,” It was said so matter-of-factly, that it brought an queasy feeling to his stomach, “I don’t think he wanted a kid, but I know Mama wanted one. She told me that she always wanted me, even after the doctor said I was Quirkless.”

“But Mama loved Hisashi so much that whenever he came home, she would make me go to my room,” Midoriya gave a slight shrug, “I didn’t like him, so I always went to my room anyways, but she always spent her time with him when he was home and he was nice to her usually.”

“I thought it was just how our family was supposed to be,” Another shrug, this time more slumped, “Hisashi didn’t like me and I didn’t like Hisashi. But Mama loved us both. So it was okay.”

“I see,” And what a mess of a family dynamic it was, “Thank you for telling me all of this, Izuku-kun.”

“You’re welcome.”

“You mentioned earlier that you weren’t there when your mother died,” Naomasa readied his next question, “But that you heard about her death from neighbors. Can you tell me some more about that?”

“What do you mean?”

“The reports I looked up concerning your mother, and by proxy, you, state that after her death was processed, you were also presumed to be dead, as no one had seen you for days… and because of your previously perceived Quirkless status, there were… assumptions made,” Naomasa winced, as he spoke, unable to meet neither Yamada nor Aizawa in the eyes, “Can you tell me more about the time between last seeing your mother and finding out about her death?”

“Can Aizawa-san or Yamada-san tell you instead?” Midoriya asked, his tone almost sulky, “I already told them last night, so they can tell you.”

“I’m sorry, Izuku-kun,” And he really was sorry; the last thing he wanted to do was force a traumatized kid to speak about something they were uncomfortable with, “It would be best if this was heard from you. We could take a small break, if you’d like and continue afterwards.”

“No!” Midoriya yelped, making both Aizawa and Yamada straighten up and look worried, one much more openly than the other, and then repeated in a lower voice, “No. No break. I can tell you what happened.”

“Izuku, are you sure?” Both Aizawa’s voice and the ruffle he gave Midoriya’s hair were gentle, “If you need a break, then we can stop for one.”

“No break,” Midoriya shook his head, a stubborn look on his face, “I wanna continue now.”

“Alright, Izuku-kun,” Naomasa was careful not to let out his exasperated sigh, “We can continue, but if you want to stop for a break at any time, please let me know.”

“Okay, I’ll let you know.”

Lie

Naomasa didn’t let the expression on his face change as his quirk pinged him, his inner exhaustion almost doubling. Maybe issuing a mandatory break needed to be a thing when doing interviews with children.

“I saw my Mama after I got home from daycare,” Midoriya started speaking, eyes slightly glazed over as if he was recalling that moment, “I remember that she sounded really worried and that she even looked like she wanted to cry.” He paused for a second before continuing, “She said that she wanted to play hide and seek with me, and that we were in danger. I promised her that I would hide.”

Naomasa could see Yamada’s smile go brittle, his eyes hardening. Aizawa was much the same, his frown only deepening as Midoriya kept talking.

“Then she gave me my backpack and I left,” Midoriya nodded with finality, “And that was the last time I saw my Mama.”

Naomasa felt faint just listening to this, knowing that everything said was ringing true.

He could understand why Midoriya had initially wanted Aizawa or Yamada to pass on this information for him.

“I’m sorry to hear that, Izuku-kun,” He murmured, bowing his head slightly, “I was unaware of this.”

Midoriya shrugged again, as if he didn’t just figuratively slam down some very concerning remarks.

“I found an alleyway and hid there for days,” He continued on, almost mulishly, “I don’t know how many days I was there though. I didn’t count them and I was hungry. I got my quirk when I was in the alleyway and then I ate a big rat so I wasn’t hungry anymore.” Midoriya looked thoughtful, a finger tapping the edge of the table, “I stayed there until I learned how to fly and then I went back to go find Mama, ‘cause she didn’t find me yet. I heard the neighbors talking when I was hiding in a tree and that’s how I found out about Mama dying.”

Naomasa had to give it to him. It was a rather concise statement that ticked off most of the boxes of what he had asked of Midoriya. It was also jam-packed with horrifying and true information.

Focus.

"Truth."

Focus, he told himself. Steady does it.

“Did your mother ever elaborate on what danger you were both in?”

He had to keep his calm and figure out what he could.

“She didn’t say anything about it to me, but she did say that she asked for help from heroes,” Midoriya let his hand fall from the edge of the table and reached out to grab Aizawa’s, linking their fingers together, “And that the heroes said no.”

It was just truth after truth, one after another; Naomasa wanted to break something as he confirmed everything verbally for the recording.

“Hisashi has a fire quirk,” His voice shook minutely before cutting off. Naomasa could see Aizawa’s thumb rub soothing circles into Midoriya’s hand. He felt the tinge of guilt surge up into his throat before he pushed it back down again; this information was something they needed if they wanted to keep the kid out of Midoriya Hisashi’s hands. After a minute or so, Midoriya finally continued, “Mama… Mama said we were both in danger. But she made me go hide. And then she died because she burned to death. It makes sense.”

And it did make sense, didn’t it?

The only thing that didn’t was Midoriya's admission that Midoriya Hisashi had been at least fond of Midoriya Inko, if not more. But he knew better than most that there were definitely some twisted people out there, so there was no reason to think that even love could stop a person from being murdered.

At the very least, with the information he had now, he could start an investigation looking into Midoriya Hisashi. If it all went as Midoriya assumed, Midoriya Hisashi would have no chance of obtaining custody of Midoriya Izuku. While the courts usually did their best to keep a family together, even if one was a convicted felon, it was very different if the crime they were convicted of involved the murder of their spouse.

“Thank you for sharing all of this information with me, Izuku-kun,” Naomasa almost felt relieved that this interview was nearing a close; he didn’t think he could take anymore blasé statements regarding this entire situation, “Is there anything else you want to say before we end?”

“No.”

“Very well,” He nodded, “This interview is concluded. Time is 15:12.”

Naomasa reached out a hand to end the recording, the red light on it dimming until it was no longer visible. He picked it up, sliding it into his inner jacket pocket where it would be safe until he could make a backup. Maybe even two backups. While he would like to believe that his fellow police officers at the station wouldn’t discriminate, Midoriya’s past case had left a horrible aftertaste in his mouth, betrayal stinging his heart. For now, at least, he would try to do as much as he could on his own. And perhaps when he had built up a more solid case later on, he could bring in Sansa.

Midoriya deserved that much from him.

It had been his life that had been upturned, after all.

He still had plans to travel to the precinct of Midoriya’s old home and find out the names of who managed to get a death certificate signed off with no identifiable body to prove it. That was illegal. The police had no power to determine that a death had occurred. That case should have stayed open until the kid or his body had been located.

Naomasa was determined to get to the bottom of this.

And it would all start with Midoriya Hisashi.

“Can I ask you a question, Tsu-ka-u-chi-san?”

He looked up to see Midoriya glance at him, though he averted his gaze again when their eyes met. Small steps, he reminded himself as his heart panged.

“Of course you may,” Naomasa managed a small smile, “I’ll do my best to answer.”

“What happened to your hat?”

Aizawa snorted, hand halfway to his mouth, unable to muffle the sound in time. Midoriya looked up at him, eyes big.

“That’s not funny, Aizawa-san!” His voice was louder now than it had been for the last hour or so, “It’s not!” Aizawa only patted his head, a lopsided grin on his face, “He’s supposed to have a hat!”

If he hadn't had so much experience with understanding the intricacies of his quirk, he honestly would have been appalled that Midoriya's statement rang with 'truth.'

“Ah, I,” Naomasa was honestly at a loss for words. How had this conversation gotten derailed on the basis of the hat that he hadn’t even worn? He glanced over at Yamada who wasn’t even trying to hide his amusement at the situation. The small petty part of him wanted to rat out Aizawa, but he had no idea how that would go, so it would be best to play it safe. “I forgot it at home.”

Midoriya frowned at him.

It really was quite odd to see such a serious expression on a child. Was it a part of his own personality or a part he had adopted from Aizawa? Either could be correct, considering he knew that children were absorbent sponges and also tended to mimic the adults they were closest to.

He picked up his now cold coffee and gulped the rest of it down; the stare was a bit unnerving and he wasn’t even sure if the kid was doing it on purpose or not, but he didn’t want to meet that gaze. Was it a strange thing to think that Midoriya might be staring into his soul?

The longer the silence continued, the more awkward it got.

Naomasa was sure he had overstayed his welcome by now.

“I want to thank you for speaking with me, Izuku-kun,” He nodded his thanks to the boy sitting in front of him, “I know it was hard,” And he knew it was; watching Midoriya practically force words out of his mouth at times made him want to cancel the interview preemptively a few times even, “And I want you to know. I’m going to do my best to bring you justice. For you and your mother.”

Midoriya looked up at him then, the intensity of those green eyes nearly making him audibly gasp. He swallowed the sound that almost escaped his mouth, and only just managed to keep himself from darting his gaze away. Barely a second passed before those eyes looked away, redirecting their gaze to Aizawa.

Aizawa seemed to understand what the gaze meant, his own softening, and he nodded, helping Midoriya out of the chair and steadying him when he wobbled on his feet.

“Hizashi can show you out, Tsukauchi,” He gave a small nod of his own even as Midoriya dragged him off by the hand back to what he presumed to be the living room area, “Thanks for coming over. Contact me if you find anything.”

Yamada shot a thumbs up at the retreating Aizawa before turning back to him, an apologetic look on his expressive face.

“I don’t suppose you’d like a cup of coffee to go?” He offered as he got to his feet, “We’ve got disposable cups.”

“If you don’t mind, I’d love one,” Naomasa couldn’t help it. That coffee was easily one of the highlights of the entire trip, “It may have spoiled me for anything else.”

Yamada let out a short laugh and for a mere moment, Naomasa could hear Present Mic. It still boggled his mind knowing that Eraserhead and Present Mic were a thing. Hell, it still surprised him that Eraserhead was married in the first place. But to Present Mic? That was just wild.

Naomasa stood, taking the time to check that he had everything with him, sighting Midoriya leaning his head against Aizawa’s side. His face was relaxed and eyes closed, making him look like a child that hadn’t just tried staring him down with a predator’s intensity. Aizawa was holding a book and reading from it aloud. He turned away; it felt like he was intruding in a private moment of sorts.

As Yamada returned, a small cup of coffee in hand, he could hear their low voices petering off behind him as he stepped down the hallway.

“Yamada-san does the voices better.”

“Do you want to wait for Hizashi to get back then?”

“No.”

“Thought so.”

Naomasa gratefully accepted the cup, breathing in the strong bitter scent of the coffee, plopping away the truth of the knowledge that Present Mic evidently did better storybook character voices than Eraserhead did. Yamada laughed again as he unlocked the front door, beckoning him out, only to follow right behind him as the door closed.

“Yamada?”

“I know Shouta thanked you already, but I wanted to thank you as well,” He looked sheepish, but bowed his head all the same, “What you’re doing, it’s a lot, and we’re very grateful for your help.”

“It’s my job.”

“I know,” Yamada shrugged, a strand of his hair falling out of the bun his hair was up in, “You didn’t have to come all the way here though. And you were patient with Izuku. Thank you for that.”

“He’s just a kid,” Naomasa murmured, “He did his best with what he could. He did better than I honestly expected.”

“He's a good kid, yeah," Yamada agreed, "And I’m pretty sure he doesn’t hate your guts or whatever you might be thinking,” He then continued, a tired smile on his lips, “He’s just not a fan of people in general right now. It’s probably only me and Shouta that he will even stay around and communicate with voluntarily."

"A lot must have happened to him on the streets," He took a small sip of the coffee, relishing the taste of it, "I wouldn't blame him if he did hate my guts."

"Oh, you don't even know half of it," Yamada sighed, an exhausted look appearing on his face for a split second before it disappeared, buried under a polite smile, "But I'm not going to take up more of your time. Thanks again, Tsukauchi!"

And with that said, along with a parting wiggle of fingers, Yamada left, retreating back into his and Aizawa's apartment.

Huh.

Naomasa stared at the door only for a second before making his way to the elevator. Holding coffee while going down stairs was not something he enjoyed doing. Thankfully, the elevator did not take long to arrive, the doors opening up for him. He pressed the button for the ground floor. The doors closed, giving him some privacy. And as he waited to get to his destination, he also let out a sigh.

That meeting really was something.

It was awful; learning what Midoriya experienced on the streets and then having to find out about his mother's death in such a callous way?

He remembered what the death certificate had deemed Midoriya Inko’s cause of death.

Spontaneous combustion.

With Midoriya Hisashi having a fire quirk and a personal connection to the victim, why had no one questioned him? Even allowing him to figuratively skip away with everything his deceased wife had not wanted him to have.

There was something rotten afoot and Naomasa predicted many more sleepless nights ahead of him. Tracking down possible reports that Midoriya Inko may or may not have tried getting filed, obtaining a warrant so he could arrest and take Midoriya Hisashi in for questioning, and also keeping up with his usual work as to not rustle up any suspicion.

It was going to be a lot.

But it was something he had to do.

It was something he wanted to do.

For the future of this child.

For the child that had looked up at him with suspicion in his eyes, but had still spoken with him, despite having a better reason than most to hate him on sight.

For the child who had smiled as Aizawa read to him from a storybook.

For the child who had a peculiar image of him in his head that could not be reconciled when he had no hat on his head.

Even after all of this time, of being Aizawa’s elusive and secret informant, he was still just a child.

Naomasa left the building determined.

It was time for him to get back to work.

    Hizashi > *whispers*
    Hizashi > I’ll read you a story later if you’ll be good for Tsukauchi, with all the voices too ( •̀ ω •́ )✧
    Izuku > Oh no, my one weakness! (＃°Д°)

    Tsukauchi finally gets to meet the child and learns of some... not-great things that have happened. But now that he knows, things can finally get put into motion!

    Hisashi sure is something, huh :v But at least he doesn't have Izuku!

    Shouta absolutely did ask Tsukauchi to not wear a hat in an attempt to throw Izuku off from his preconceived notions of the "hat-man" xD

    And Tsukauchi gets a peek of this family's current dynamics and he thinks it's pretty cute :D Also! Izuku wanted no break because he wanted this man out of his territory as soon as possible xD

    Thanks for reading! Please let me know your thoughts! :D

    Next chapter comes out August 21st! The second arc starts--Izuku finds out more about stress-induced quirks.

Chapter Text

Izuku sat quietly on the carpet.

The only sound that could be heard was the scratching of the tip of a pencil against paper and Aizawa-san’s relaxed breathing behind him.

Izu-ku

Izu-ku

Izu-

A twinge jolted through his hand, forcing him to drop the pencil. It hit the table and rolled off the edge, landing into the carpet. Izuku wanted to sigh, but Aizawa-san was napping, and he didn’t want to risk waking him up. If there was anyone in the world that needed naps, it was Aizawa-san.

It was still early in the afternoon, the sunlight coming in through to the living room from the balcony doors. Izuku couldn’t help but to look out, even standing up and getting closer so he could pull the curtains over just a bit to get a better view, the buildings in the distance sharply jagging across the skyline.

He could see other birds flying around, though they didn’t land anywhere near their balcony. Izuku imagined it was probably because they knew it was his territory and that he would probably eat them if they tried landing there.

Well, they weren’t wrong.

Except for the fact that he hadn’t actually managed to turn back into an owl at all for the last few days! It was a bit frustrating. In exchange though, he had been able to spend a lot of time with Aizawa-san, listening as he talked on the phone to Recovery Girl.

Aizawa-san had offered him a new home, a new roost, and Izuku did not regret agreeing to it. He just missed being able to fly. Flying was one of his favorite things to do, and it sucked that he couldn’t do it right now. He was used to flying nearly every single night, wind gliding off his wings and through his feathers, the night’s stars and the moon providing him with light for him to see.

Another issue that had come up was that he couldn’t reach anything that was placed high up.

He had to ask for help if he couldn’t reach something, and if he didn’t ask and tried to get to it himself?

Well, Yamada-san had made it very clear to him after he had plucked him off of the bookshelf he had been climbing.

“Please don’t climb onto shelves, ‘Zuku,” He had said, his eyebrows all scrunched up in worry, “You could fall and break something!” Yamada-san then placed him back onto the floor, “Remember what happened to Humpty-Dumpty in the nursery rhyme?”

“Hump-ty Dump-ty had a gr-eat fall?” Izuku had replied with shaky English before switching back to Japanese, “He fell and they couldn’t put him back together again.”

“Very good!” Yamada-san had praised, “Exactly! Even if they’ll heal up eventually, broken bones are no fun, ya know?”

They had then spent the rest of the evening reorganizing the book shelf together so that he could reach the books he wanted without having to climb anything.

There wasn’t much that he couldn’t reach now in the living room now due their efforts, but that wasn’t the point. He just didn’t want to bother them too often. Aizawa-san and Yamada-san were both heroes and Yamada-san also worked at the radio station. They were busy people. He couldn't go bother them every time he wanted a glass of water.

If he could turn into an owl again, he was sure he could just fly into the sink and get water for himself. Lake water was also a possibility, but he had promised Aizawa-san that he wouldn’t go outside alone.

He ended up letting out a small sigh as he let go of the curtain, the fabric shifting back into place.

“Izuku?” Aizawa-san’s tired voice mumbled out, "What are you doing?"

Turning back to see Aizawa-san shifting into a sitting position, he returned to the coffee table, remembering to pick up the pencil he had dropped just before.

“Izuku?”

He climbed onto the couch, not protesting when Aizawa-san tucked him into his side, looking down with just barely visible concern in his eyes.

“I was making sure the other birds weren’t coming too close,” Izuku finally murmured, lips tugged into a pout, “And it looks nice outside.”

It was still too bright for his liking, but the blue sky with big puffy clouds was pretty. On a day like this, there were probably a lot of people in the streets. It was June still and that meant that July was almost here. It meant that summer was almost here.

At least that also meant he didn’t have to worry too much about being cold. Having to adjust to no feathers on his arms and legs meant that he was almost constantly in long sleeves and sweatpants. When Yamada-san saw him, he said that it looked like he was going to grow up to be like Aizawa-san in his fashion choices and tearfully promised that he would somehow save him. Izuku wasn’t even sure what he was talking about.

He had sat down with Yamada-san though, watching him open up tabs upon tabs of shopping websites. They were almost all for clothing; the few that weren’t, were for furniture. Izuku really hoped that he wasn’t expected to get that much clothing. He didn’t need that much clothing; owls had feathers. Telling Yamada-san that though, had only given him a sad look on his face, so Izuku had ended up choosing a few new shirts, shorts, and even a long gray knitted scarf. (It reminded him of Aizawa-san’s capture scarf and Yamada-san said it was on sale, so he was more than happy with getting a good deal.) The things they had purchased hadn’t arrived yet, but it would be soon. He was looking forward to them coming.

“Do you want to go outside?” Aizawa-san asked, his voice interrupting his thoughts, “We can, if you want to.”

Izuku shook his head.

“I miss flying,” He admitted, “I want to go flying.”

He could feel Aizawa-san’s sigh more than he could hear it, his head shifting out and then back down as Aizawa-san inhaled and then exhaled.

“I don’t have any complaints about you going flying, you know that,” He started, and well, Izuku did know that! Aizawa-san had said that he could go flying if he wanted, but only in places where quirks were allowed to be used and with adult su-per-vi-sion. Aizawa-san said that meant that he or Yamada-san had to be there to watch so he wouldn’t get into trouble. “But you need to be able to use your quirk properly first.”

Izuku only pouted again.

It wasn’t as if he didn’t know that as well.

And it wasn’t his fault that turning into an owl was apparently hard! He only had two previous examples to go by too! And when he had asked Aizawa-san if he could try being really hungry again… Well, Aizawa-san had given him a very serious look and said no, never.

(And he would really rather not surround himself with fire and explosions again, so he didn’t even bother asking Aizawa-san about trying to make that happen for him either.)

“Why is using it so hard?” Izuku groaned, “I’m pretty sure no one else back in daycare had this much trouble using theirs.”

As a matter of fact, he remembered that Kacchan even got his while at daycare, the sparks popping in his palm, the sound even initially startling him.

“Well, there can be a lot of reasons why it would be difficult to control a quirk,” Aizawa-san hummed, “In your case, it’s likely a mixture of the conditions it manifested under and because it’s a transformation quirk.”

“Why are trans-for-ma-tion quirks harder to control?” Izuku wrinkled his nose, “And what do you mean by the con-di-tions?”

“Transformation quirks, in general, require a high degree of focus. You're physically changing your body, Izuku," Aizawa-san explained, "And while your body knows the form that it can take, it will require a lot of practice to do it. Especially for you."

He tilted his head, peeking up to meet Aizawa-san’s eyes.

What did he mean by that?

"The two previous times you transformed into an owl, you were either starving or scared, right?"

Izuku nodded.

"You can't rely on circumstances like that to use your quirk."

Aizawa-san seemed to realize that he was about to protest, shushing him with a small pat on the head. He pouted instead. It was a bit unfair, Izuku thought, that Aizawa-san was so good at distracting him with headpats.

(Was it because he practiced with the cats that lived in the streets? He bet that those cats loved Aizawa-san’s headpats as well, if they let him do it.)

If he had to be more accurate though, it was less of a distraction and more of an apology. An apology for not letting him talk about why going hungry was probably fine if he wanted to activate his quirk to go flying. And it wasn't as if he would stay hungry either! He knew he was very good at catching his own food. And there was even a whole cabinet full of small snacks that Aizawa-san had him pick out of if it wasn’t time for a big meal yet.

Which was why it made no sense!

But he swallowed his protests, prompting Aizawa-san to give him another pat on the head.

"I know you don't like it when I tell you not to do something without some reasoning behind it," Aizawa-san began, his voice sliding a bit towards Eraserhead and further from Aizawa-san, "So just listen for now, alright?"

Izuku nodded.

"If you plan on using your quirk on a regular basis, either at home or in places where quirk use is allowed, then depending on a negative emotion to spur on the activation of your quirk will only eventually prove to be a hindrance."

What was a hin-dr-ance?

"A hindrance is something or someone that gets in the way of your goal and slows things down," Aizawa-san explained, breaking down the new word into easier words, before continuing, "Of course negative emotions can kickstart a quirk into action; I'm not saying they don't. However, becoming dependent on a method like that for just using a quirk, unless there is no other choice… It isn't logical."

"You want to be able to have access to your quirk at all times.”

Izuku guessed he could agree with that. And it was true that always counting on himself to be really hungry, just so he could use his quirk, would get annoying after the first few times.

“Also, it worries me,” Izuku blinked up the sudden shift in tone from Aizawa-san, eyes big and wondering what could worry someone like Aizawa-san, “If you keep depending on something like hunger or fear as a crutch to use your quirk, it won’t be good for your health. The way you manifested your quirk, it… It just isn’t a reliable method, Izuku.”

Aizawa-san took a deep breath, his hand still a steady weight on his shoulder.

“Have you ever heard of a stress-induced quirk?”

Shouta hoped he wasn’t making a mistake.

In choosing to tell Izuku the truth about his quirk, he would be opening a can of worms that he had previously avoided even touching.

Partly, it was because every time Izuku brought up wanting to go hungry, so his quirk would activate again, his heart would lurch, would ache, in the knowledge that Izuku saw nothing wrong about starvation, willingly choosing to go hungry if he could fly again. That sort of mindset was not good, especially not for a child.

Izuku tapped on his knee.

‘No.’

Alright.

There was no going back on this now.

“A stress-induced quirk, as the name implies, is a quirk that manifests due to stress,” Izuku hummed at that, nodding, and Shouta couldn’t help but feel a tinge of amusement at his serious expression, “It’s called that, but it would be more accurate to say that it’s one that manifests to keep the user alive.”

“They’re rare, considering the way that they manifest,” He made sure to keep his arm relaxed around Izuku, voice light, as if they were talking about what to have for dinner tonight, “A majority of the people that do gain them, they don’t do well in the end.”

A small tug on his sleeve had him looking down, Izuku’s worried eyes meeting his own.

“Do you want to know why?”

There was a small pause, seconds passing before Izuku hesitantly tapped again.

‘Yes.’

“It isn’t because of the quirk, if you were wondering,” Izuku seemed to relax at that and Shouta couldn’t help but to give him another pat on they head, “A lot of the time, what they experienced before manifesting their quirk, the pain or trauma that caused that quirk to even manifest in the first place, it isn't always fixed just by getting a quirk."

"Trauma?" Izuku whispered out, the lilt of his voice marking it as something he wanted clarification on.

"Trauma happens when someone experiences an intense event that threatens or causes harm to them," He explained, hoping that the words he chose were simple enough for Izuku to grasp the meaning of, "It doesn't even have to happen you; it could have been something you found out happened to someone you cared about."

He paused there, giving Izuku a chance to think about his words. To connect the figurative dots.

Izuku only nodded after a few seconds, a small frown twisting his lips

"A stress-induced quirk is harder to control as well, compared to the usual," He continued after he was sure Izuku wasn't going to further reply, "Because of the circumstances of the manifestation, at first, those types of quirks tend to be easier to activate later again under similar conditions. The users only have that as their reference after all, unlike others who had theirs manifest in a normal setting."

Shouta knew he was getting horribly sidetracked from the original point he was trying to make, but nevertheless, he pressed on.

"What I'm trying to say is," Shouta sighed, “Stress-induced quirks only manifest because of something terrible happening. And forcing yourself to go through that trauma again to use your quirk, it’ll only hurt you in the long run.”

Izuku gave him a teary glance, and Shouta wanted to pick him up, soothe him in some sort of manner. And while he wasn’t usually a man to fall to impulses, he went ahead, tugging Izuku into his lap, his arm bracing the small of his back so he wouldn’t topple off accidentally. It seemed to be a good move, Izuku even leaning the side of his head against his chest, the rise and fall of his breathing likely providing a grounding effect.

"You're still a kid, Izuku," He whispered, voice rough, "You've gone through a lot already in the time you were out in the streets, experienced more than most people twice your age. I'm here now. Hizashi too. You don't have to continue alone on this anymore. We'll figure out a way together for you to activate your quirk without going hungry again or setting off any explosions. Alright?"

"You promise?" Izuku croaked out, "That I'll be able to fly again?"

"I promise," Shouta found himself saying back, knowing full well that he would even crawl to the fucking rat on his knees to beg advice from if he had to, "I promise that you will."

Shouta could feel Izuku’s nod more than he could see it, and then he finally fully relaxed, glad that this conversation had gone well. Glad that Izuku wouldn’t try possibly retraumatizing himself just to activate his quirk.

Almost a minute passed between them, the silence only broken by their breathing and the faint calls of sparrows in the distance. Not even the air conditioner was on, despite summer already being here. He had seen Izuku shivering before even with the currently warm temperatures, always choosing to nap under the cotton blanket that Hizashi had purchased for him.

“Snack cabinet!”

Izuku rocketed up, nearly slamming the top of his head against his chin. Shouta grunted, careful to keep his grip around Izuku, lest he somehow fling himself off his lap and couch and straight into the coffee table.

“Do you want a snack?”

It was still early enough in the afternoon that having a snack now wouldn’t spoil dinner. Plus, getting Izuku to eat enough was a chore in and of itself. It wasn’t that he didn’t eat; Izuku seemed more than happy to eat, always making sounds of delight at whatever meal was put in front of him. He just didn’t eat as much as Shouta would expect of a kid.

To be frank, Izuku still ate about as much as he would have as an owl.

Which would have been fine if he were still an owl, but he wasn’t right now. And humans, especially human children, needed the food to facilitate growth. He wasn’t completely sure whether it was just a carryover trait from his time as an owl or a sneaky attempt at trying to force activate his quirk. It could even be a byproduct from Izuku thinking he was too expensive to raise and feed, much to his displeasure. But Shouta wasn’t going to stand for any of that.

“Mmn, maybe later,” Izuku shook his head, dismissing his offer, but still looked plenty excited, “I figured something out.”

“Oh?” Shouta hummed, curious about what it could be, “What is it?”

“The snack cabinet,” He repeated, eyes shining, “You made a snack cabinet because of me.”

“And what makes you think that?”

“‘Cause you don’t want me to be hungry,” Izuku spoke with confidence, doubt completely absent from his voice, “So you put the snacks there since I can’t go outside to catch food.”

Well, he wasn’t completely wrong. Hizashi had come up with the idea initially, worried that Izuku wasn’t eating enough during their sit-down meals, and had insisted on clearing out one of their cabinets to store easy-to-reach snacks for Izuku that he could have if either of them were too busy to make something for him. They didn’t like it, but that was par for the lives of pro heroes. Thankfully, Izuku didn’t have any allergies, so they had relative freedom to choose what would go in, always asking said child for input before actually going out and purchasing anything.

(Izuku seemed to enjoy those packets of seaweed the most, next to fruit jelly pouches at least. He would even try to wrap pieces of it around spoonfuls of rice to no avail, though he seemed satisfied enough by the taste, if not the sticky mess he had on his hands afterwards. Shouta would have to put together some sushi rice for him some day. Perhaps on his upcoming birthday? Izuku would probably like that, he thought.)

“Good thinking,” He praised, fond amusement piercing his heart at Izuku’s grin, “Are you sure you don’t want a snack? I’m going to have a snack.”

“Me too, then!”

Izuku wiggled out of his lap and off the couch, waiting for him to stand and follow before he headed to the kitchen, not stopping at the snack cabinet, but at the refrigerator.

“We have edamame, right?” He turned to look up at him, “Can we have that?”

“Sure.”

Shouta pulled out the container that had the edamame stored in it, releasing the latches on the side and then the lid that kept it’s contents fresh, pouring out some of the contents into a smaller dish before handing it over to Izuku. He and Izuku had spent a while deshelling them last night after salting them and then boiling them in water. They were in season and nutritious, so Hizashi had bought them, thinking they’d make for a good snack or an ingredient in a salad.

While Izuku retreated back into the living room with his prize carefully, Shouta poured out two glasses of water. They were bound to get thirsty with this sort of snack. And while he would usually be much more wary of allowing Izuku to have edamame as snack, despite their many good points, Izuku hadn’t had any trouble with the food they had cooked for him so far, his stomach seemingly well enough to even digest half a choco pie with no negative consequence. It was a good thing. Though honestly, why Hizashi had given Izuku half of that sugary mess he was having was beyond him.

Izuku looked up as he entered the living room area, glasses of water in hand. Placing them onto the coffee table, he sank back down into the couch with a sigh, only leaning forward to snag a couple of the beans to toss into his mouth. They were good, though he had never doubted that. If anything, Hizashi always managed to get the best deals for high quality produce whenever he did the shopping.

As Izuku picked up the glass closer to him for a sip, Shouta could see his pursed lips. It was obvious to him that Izuku had something he wanted to ask. He didn’t press him, opting to have a few more of the edamame instead, enjoying the small burst of flavor as he bit into them.

They ate in silence, only punctuated by the occasional sip of water. Izuku picked up his pencil again after finishing the last of the edamame, tapping it against the table. Shouta watched him, eyes wandering to the sheet of paper which Izuku had been practicing his writing on earlier, though now it was hidden underneath another sheet of paper, one which had some odd sort of character drawn on it. It was common to see him with paper during the afternoons which they spent together. Usually he'd be napping or catching up remotely with his paperwork while Izuku worked on his handwriting or doodled out whatever came to mind.

"Aizawa-san?" Izuku finally spoke, turning to face in his direction, eyes betraying his nervousness.

"Hm?" Shouta grunted, "What is it?"

"You said we could go outside earlier…"

Was this what it was about?

"Yes," He nodded, "I did."

Izuku approaching him with this gave him a sense of relief. He had been worried about a lot of things recently. Potential doctor appointments, possible school enrollment, and Izuku’s eating habits were only a few of those things. And along with Izuku's general lack of interest in social interaction and engagement with anyone that wasn’t him or Hizashi… Well, it would be weird if he didn't worry.

"There's a nice playground a few minutes away from us," Shouta said after a moment of thought, "Do you want to go?"

"Can we visit U.A. instead?" Izuku asked as politely as ever, though his eyes were begging, "Can we?"

"U.A.?" He echoed, "Is there a specific reason or…?"

"Nedzu-san is really smart," Izuku picked up his paper to show him what he had drawn on its surface. It was Nedzu. Or at least he was relatively sure it was Nedzu. He didn't know any other rats that wore ties and bore a distinctive scar over an eye. "I think, if I ask him nicely, he might give me a hint about a way to activate my quirk."

"I'll… ask him," Shouta already knew the chances were high, the previously ignored tea invitation coming to mind, "The school year is still going on though and U.A. probably won't be as empty as the last time we visited. Are you prepared for that possibility, Izuku?"

Izuku faltered, eyes darkening with doubt before clearing up again, determination taking its place.

"I want to drink tea with Nedzu-san."

Shouta fought the urge to sigh.

"I'll let him know," He made a show of typing out an email on his phone, sending it out within minutes and placing his phone back onto the table, "While we wait for a reply, do you want to help me with dinner tonight?"

Izuku nodded excitedly, putting his pencil and Nedzu picture back onto the table.

"Go wash your hands," Shouta waved him off in the direction of the bathroom, "We're making tsukune."

He watched as Izuku zoomed down the hallway, steps much more sure compared to the ones he had taken a few days ago.

Izuku seemed to be adjusting well to living with them.

Shouta was glad.

The rest of their afternoon was peaceful, the two of them sitting around the dinner table putting together skewers of chicken meatballs for tonight’s dinner.

Shouta was glad that Izuku didn’t show any interest in eating any of the raw ground chicken meat they were working with, though he was less glad that Izuku seemed to really enjoy poking things with the bamboo skewers he had elected to use for this endeavor. Metal skewers worked better for this, but he also knew that Izuku held some odd fascination with sharp and pointy objects as an owl. And now that he saw this, he was sure the knife fixation was purely an Izuku thing.

(Those knives he had ended up confiscating from Izuku earlier on were still stored under his and Hizashi’s bed. He would have to clear those out when Izuku was with Hizashi or something. The last thing they needed was an Izuku in their apartment armed to the teeth with knives.)

By the time they were done, the sun was setting and they had a couple of trays filled with small skewers, ready for pan-frying later in the evening.

As he washed his hands at the sink, his phone pinged with an alert for his email. Izuku immediately perked up, eyes wandering over to where the phone was in the living room.

“Wash your hands with soap,” Shouta reminded Izuku as he dried his hands with the towel that hung by the aprons, “At least thirty seconds since you want to get rid of the germs after handling raw meat.”

Izuku nodded, though he did keep peeking around him, clearly more interested in whatever reply Nedzu (presumably) had sent back.

“Go on,” He nudged Izuku to the sink, tugging over a foot stool so he would be able to use the sink properly, “The email isn’t going to unsend itself. Wash your hands first.”

With the extra encouragement, Izuku started to wash his hands. As he reached over for the soap, Shouta finally left the kitchen for the living room. While he wasn’t as obviously excited as Izuku was about Nedzu’s potential reply (and it was Nedzu’s, the notification coming up as he tapped at his lock screen), he knew he would have to face it eventually. Nedzu knowing about Izuku, showing blatant interest in him, was a sure sign that he would have to pay attention to their interactions closely.

Shouta scanned through the short message.

Read it again, just to make sure he didn’t miss anything.

He sighed.

It looked like another visit to U.A. was under the horizon.

    Principal Nedzu,

    I hope you are well.

    Izuku is interested in meeting you again. (He has transformation quirk related questions.)

    If your previous invitation for tea is still open, we would like to accept it.

    Dear Aizawa-kun,

    I would be more than happy to host the two of you again for tea! As for the questions, I shall do my best to answer what I can. Perhaps if Izuku-kun is feeling up to it, I can introduce one of our students to him. She also has a transformation quirk and I believe that she may be able to give him some good advice.

    Does the Saturday of this week sound good to you?

    A dog, a mouse, or a bear? I am the Principal!

    Nedzu

    P.S. Consider also taking this chance to introduce Izuku-kun to Recovery Girl.


Notes:

    Shouta > Do you want a snack?
    Izuku > No.
    Shouta > I’m having a snack.
    Izuku > Me too!
    Shouta > ( •̀ ω •́ )✧

    Hooo boy! Bit heavy for the first chapter of a new arc maybe? xD But it was going to happen eventually and Izuku is too inquisitive to allow something like this lie for long, especially since he wants to use his quirk and he wants to use it now.

    Nedzu gets to appear soon though! How exciting! It seems Izuku will get to have tea with the principal in the near future! :3

    And something to keep in mind for this arc: Shouta and Hizashi are both relatively inexperienced with kids, Shouta much more so. Hizashi can at least call upon babysitting knowledge, but Shouta doesn’t even have that! They’re going to make mistakes and wrong assumptions, ya know? Despite that, they’ll keep trying their best :D For themselves and for Izuku.

    Thanks for reading! Please let me know your thoughts! :D

Chapter Text

Izuku was starting to wonder if he had made a mistake.

Aizawa-san had left right after breakfast to go see Tsukauchi-san, leaving Yamada-san at home with him. Under most circumstances, he wouldn’t mind that. He liked Yamada-san a lot and having him alone for a couple of hours usually meant they would get to read something together.

Sometimes, Yamada-san would teach him English nursery rhymes and songs. Izuku didn’t think he was very good at it, but it was fun singing along, especially since some of the songs that he was learning were ones he already knew back from daycare.

(His favorite so far was ‘Twinkle Twinkle, Little Star.’)

However, this time, Yamada-san had managed to convince him to go out shopping.

It wasn’t even at night.

It was in the morning.

All Izuku had wanted to do in the morning was listen to Yamada-san read to him and maybe take a small nap. He didn’t want to go out when the sun was high up and follow Yamada-san around as he very slowly examined vegetables and talked with the stall owners, only buying the ones he thought were the best quality.

Except that was exactly what he was doing.

Yamada-san was very good at convincing him to do things he thought he probably wouldn’t choose to do if given a choice. In this case, Yamada-san said it was like practicing for going outside and being around people before he and Aizawa-san went to visit U.A. again and have tea with Nedzu-san. It made sense, so he had agreed to go with Yamada-san.

The place they went to was barely a ten minute walk away, and Yamada-san had held his hand the entire way there, pointing out his favorite shops as they walked past them. A bakery, a flower shop, and another small bakery. Yamada-san sure liked bakeries. Izuku had to admit though, the smells coming out from the bakeries were really nice. It hadn’t been long since breakfast, but he thought he wouldn’t mind having something from one of Yamada-san’s favorite bakeries if it tasted as good as it smelled.

It only got louder as they got closer and before long, they arrived at the entrance of a shopping street.

Izuku could remember visiting one like this, though at that time, he had gone with his Mama.

This one didn’t seem much different with its vibrant colors and liveliness. It wasn’t very busy, thankfully, but it was still loud, the vendors all too eager to talk when someone showed interest in whatever they were trying to sell. And Yamada-san seemed to stop at many stalls, greeting each stall owner by name and asking for their recommendations of the day.

And while it wasn’t horrible, standing out in the sun as Yamada-san chatted with people, it got boring fast.

“Is that your son, Yamada-kun?” One of the stall owners that Yamada-san seemed to know very well, a very small grandmother, asked, “He must take after you with those green eyes.”

Izuku could feel his cheeks warm up, hand latching into Yamada-san’s pants.

“Yeah! This is Izuku!” Yamada-san replied with a grin, chest even a bit puffed out, “He’s only started staying with us recently, so I thought I’d show him around a few of my favorite places.”

"Well, he will always be welcome here," She nodded in his direction. He bowed his head slightly in return, relieved when she returned her attention to Yamada-san, "What are you looking for today?"

"How are the cucumbers?" Yamada-san asked, finger tapping his chin, "Though if you have some nice eggplants, I won't say no to them."

Izuku quickly lost interest in the conversation as the two adults in front of him haggled over small baskets of vegetables. He hoped that Yamada-san wouldn’t take too long.

It was a lot to expect from Yamada-san, someone who he knew really enjoyed talking, so he wasn't surprised when they didn't move on to browse other stalls.

Instead, he tried to not let his face get even redder than it already was. Just thinking about it too much made his face go warmer.

Yamada-san hadn't denied that he was his son.

“Did you hear? Yamada brought his son over!”

“Just look at those eyes!”

“What an adorable child!”

The surrounding stall owners all spoke to each other, all excited whispers and coos.

His face only grew warmer and warmer as he heard more.

Izuku knew that Yamada-san and Aizawa-san would refer to him as their bird son at times, but this was completely different! Being called their bird son was like a nickname! But there was really no mistaking what the grandma had asked Yamada-san. And Izuku knew his hearing wasn't as good as a human compared to an owl, but he knew he didn't mishear anything.

While Yamada-san hadn't said that he was his son, he hadn't said he wasn't, and that was the thing! It would have been easy to say he was just a kid they were fostering.

(At least that was what Aizawa-san had told him. E-mer-gen-cy fostering was the exact wording he used.)

Izuku had thought about it a lot.

He had a lot of time to do that now, especially since he didn’t have to go out to hunt for food or go find information for Aizawa-san. Never mind the fact that he was pretty sure Aizawa-san would be really upset if he did and that was the last thing he wanted to cause!

However, going outside on his own was something he was used to doing every night; it had become a routine for him and now that he couldn’t do it, it made him feel a bit sad. It wasn’t all bad though. Izuku was finding Aizawa-san and Yamada-san had their own routines and they always tried to make him feel included.

It was a nice feeling, to be included.

Izuku just wished breakfast wasn’t so early in the day.

(He knew that Yamada-san usually had to have an early start a lot of the time for his work at the radio station or his pro hero patrols, but still!)

Either Aizawa-san or Yamada-san would wake him up every single morning just so they could have breakfast together, even when they both didn’t have to go in for any work. And though he was always tired at that time of day, in the end, breakfast together was nice.

Another new routine of his was practicing his handwriting every afternoon. It was more of a way to get used to holding a pencil again, but just holding a pencil and not doing anything with the pencil made no sense! It wasn’t logical!

(One day, he would find out why Yamada-san made those weird expressions with his face every time he used that phrase. Aizawa-san seemed to like it, so it couldn’t be that he was using it wrong. Very odd.)

Aizawa-san usually took his afternoon nap around the same time, but sometimes he would stay up and go through reports on his laptop. And when he finished, they would get a snack together from the snack cabinet or the refrigerator.

His absolute favorite new routine was one that Aizawa-san and he did two or three hours after dinner. Aizawa-san had his patrols and before he left, he would always make sure to do stretches. Izuku had only watched the first time, but the next time, he tried joining in. He wasn’t very good at it, but Yamada-san would cheer him on as he watched from the couch. They would both make sure he was doing them in a way that wouldn’t lead to him hurting himself, though he couldn’t exactly touch his toes or do a split like Aizawa-san could.

Aizawa-san seemed happy to see him try though, never neglecting to give him a pat on the head after they finished. He would then get dressed in his hero clothes and capture scarf, ready for his job.

“Izuku?”

He blinked, hearing his name being called, and looked up.

“There you are,” Yamada-san had a small smile on his face as he spoke, “I thought you might have fallen asleep on me for a moment there.”

Yamada-san chuckled as he saw his nose wrinkle. Izuku was pretty sure he couldn’t fall asleep while standing up and he poked Yamada-san’s leg for even thinking he would do that in the middle of a street.

What a silly adult Yamada-san was.

Hizashi resisted the urge to coo at the adorable sight Izuku made.

How was it possible that Izuku was such a cute kid even when he was pouting and jabbing his leg with a finger?

It was a good thing though; this was normal Izuku behavior. He had been worried a bit, afraid he had been too pushy about it, but this little trip to the local shopping street was going better than he expected. This was Izuku's first venture out in a while, as a human at least.

He had chosen this place specifically because he knew it tended to be less busy early on the weekdays. It helped that it was a location he visited frequently for the fresh produce and thus, already knew most, if not all, of the stall owners. Knew they were safe, and protective of their own.

Izuku hadn't seemed too overwhelmed, thankfully, though he had kept carefully to his side, never straying more than a step or two away, a finger always clinging to his belt loops as an alternative when they couldn't be holding each other's hand.

Small steps.

This was a good start.

"I've got our vegetables for the next couple of days," Hizashi patted the bag sitting on his shoulder, the contents of it peeking out, "Anything you want while we're here?"

Izuku shook his head, reaching up to hold his hand again, now that it was free.

"Not even snacks?" He mused as he waved his goodbyes to Hyoutan-obaa-san, "We could always use more snacks at home."

The existence of the snack cabinet was honestly a blessing. It had started out as a method to have a location where snacks were readily available to try and get Izuku to eat more often, but both he and Shouta found that they enjoyed having it around anyways as an excuse to try out things they usually wouldn't buy.

They hadn’t even had Izuku for even a full week yet, and Shouta had already brought home a box of miniature taiyaki with different fillings. It wasn’t exactly healthy, but Izuku had been very eager to have bites of the fish-shaped snacks, not wanting to have an entire one on his own.

(Shouta hadn’t looked surprised when Izuku chomped off the heads of the poor things, leaving him and Shouta with the custard and red bean paste filled bodies respectively.)

The snack cabinet had even curbed Shouta’s tendencies to buy bulk boxes of protein bars. It was wonderful! Those things tasted like cardboard, so he was more than happy to not have to see them again staring down at him from a shelf when he was just innocently looking for something to snack on.

(It hadn’t stopped Shouta from trying to get Izuku to try a bite though, but while Izuku wasn’t too picky about food, he clearly had standards, and those protein bars just didn’t pass them.)

“How do you feel about senbei?” Hizashi hummed as he tugged Izuku’s hand lightly, signaling him to start walking again. The shopping street was starting to get into it’s groove, and soon, the other locals would be showing up to do their shopping. While he enjoyed the hustle and bustle of busy mornings, he knew that Izuku wasn’t ready for anything of the sort, “I know a good place to get fresh ones!”

Izuku seemed to take his suggestion to heart, brows furrowed in thought as he walked, taking two steps for every one of his.

Hizashi could feel the tap of the small fingers against his palm.

‘Yes.’

“Alrighty then!” He cheered, ignoring the looks from shoppers on the street who probably thought he was being too loud too early in the morning. Izuku gave him the same look, though the one he gave was tempered by an adorable pout, “C’mon, ‘Zuku! To the senbei stall!”

As they made their way back to the front entrance of the shopping street, Hizashi made sure to keep Izuku in conversation, though his replies were mostly just taps and the occasional nod or shake of the head. The entrance tended to be where most people were, only popping in to purchase a quick meal before heading out on their way again. He wasn't sure how Izuku would react to a sudden increase in noise and people around him, but so far, it seemed to be going as well as could be expected.

And by that, he meant that Izuku had crowded even closer to him, his knuckles white as he tightened his grip.

“Izuku?” He made sure his voice was low as he spoke, not wanting to potentially alarm him while he was already wary, “We can leave if you’d like.”

Somehow, Izuku looked even more distressed at his offer, his cheek puffing out in protest and he shook his head. Hizashi could see his eyes darting about as they walked, his nerves clearly fraying.

Thankfully, it was a short walk back to the senbei stall which they had passed earlier. There wasn’t much of a line either, much to his relief. During late afternoons, this particular stall was notoriously popular among students who liked to pick up a healthy snack before heading off to cram school.

“Yamada!” Jagako-san greeted him as they stepped in front of the stall, “What will you be having today?”

“A nori senbei for me,” He ordered, eyes peering down at Izuku next to him, who was gazing at the colorful array of rice crackers in front of him behind the glass display, his nervousness seemingly forgotten for the moment. A finger excitedly pointed at the taped picture of seaweed and Hizashi couldn’t help but to chuckle, “Make that two nori senbei!”

“Aizawa-san too,” A whisper came from his side, “Which one does Aizawa-san like?”

And if that didn’t make his heart melt.

“You wanna get some for Shouta?”

“Mhm.”

“You’re really too sweet, ‘Zuku,” Hizashi was well aware that Jagako-san was watching them, amusement at his antics, “Of course I’ll get some for Shouta.”

He was sure that Shouta was going to be over the moon when he found out about this, in his own way.

“We’ll take two shoyu senbei as well, Jagako-san! Bagged, please!”

“I’ll have your order out in a moment then, Yamada!”

And in a few minutes, two piping hot nori senbei wrapped in paper were handed to him, money exchanging hands, and a small bag with the others he ordered following suit. He passed one of the senbei over to Izuku before accepting the bag. It was heavier than he thought it would be. He peeked into the bag, spying a little packet of arare in it along with the two shoyu senbei he had ordered.

That man!

“Really?” He huffed, a brow raised at the grinning senbei stall owner, “I can’t accept this.”

“For your kid,” Jagako-san waved a hand dismissively at him, “Kids love arare.”

Hizashi wanted to argue, or at least get the man to accept payment for the extra snack, but Jagako-san was someone he had been acquainted with for almost three years by now, and he knew how stubborn he could be at times. Plus, he didn’t want to put up a fuss with Izuku there with him.

“You win this time, Jagako-san,” With a sigh, he tucked the little packet back into the bag, “Thank you. I’m sure he’ll enjoy them.”

Crunch

Hizashi looked down at the loud sound as Izuku looked up, eyes shining with delight.

“No doubt about it,” He chuckled, “Well we’re off, Jagako-san. Thank you again for the treats!”

Taking Izuku’s free hand, he tugged him along lightly. Izuku didn’t protest, more than happy to follow, his complete focus directed at the snack in his hand.

It didn’t take long for them to exit the shopping street, the difference in noise level and crowdedness immediately apparent. He continued walking, taking a bite of his own senbei. It did not disappoint, the crunch of the sheet of seaweed and the cracker itself giving it an unique and deep flavor. Jagako’s stall really was one of the best in the business, not that he expected any less from a fourth generation family-run stall.

He finished the rest of his in three big bites, crumpling the wax paper it came with his fingers and tucking it into his pocket to throw away later.

“Are you enjoying that, Izuku?” Hizashi asked, already knowing the answer to his question. He was curious though, if Izuku was willing to speak up again now that they weren’t near crowds anymore, “Remember to chew, yeah?”

“Mhm,” Izuku nodded as he licked his lips free of crumbs before taking another bite out of his, “It’s tasty. I like how crunchy it is.”

Well, he could understand the appeal of a good crunch. It coming from Izuku though, made him pause and think of things he probably shouldn’t be thinking of after eating. Pushing those thoughts away, because yeah, he really didn’t want to think about that, he lightly patted the curls on Izuku’s head.

“Are you having a nice time outside today?”

Izuku didn’t answer, choosing to have another bite of his senbei instead, chewing it with a pensive look on his face.

It made him a bit nervous, waiting for a reply from him.

Despite that, Izuku seemed pleased, even swinging their hands together as they walked down the streets back to their building.

As Izuku finally finished his senbei, he handed the wrapper over to him. Taking it, he placed it into his pocket with the other, reminding himself to keep an eye out for the nearest garbage can.

“Yeah,” He nearly startled at Izuku’s voice, “Being outside again was nice.”

Hizashi saw a small smile form on Izuku’s face.

Something rose up in him.

Protectiveness?

Joy?

He squashed it down, not wanting to yell and disturb others in the street in the morning, replying with a playful wink and smile.

“Then let’s have lots more days together like this, yeah?”

“Mm!”

Izuku smiled back at him.

It was a good day.

    Izuku > Aizawa-san says it’s got the most nutrients :O
    Hizashi > (((( ;°Д°))))
    Hizashi > *turns a bit green*

    Izuku only knows this because of the random owl-related facts that Shouta used to read off to him while they were chilling in the living room together xD

    Hizashi is the proudest bird dad!! Izuku is the embarrassed bird son!!

    The Hizashi-and-Izuku duo get to have a pretty great morning while Shouta goes off doing adult things, boo! At least he has senbei waiting for him when he gets back! Izuku also gets to learn that being outside in the mornings can be good too ;u; (also snacks!)

Chapter Text

Midoriya Hisashi.

Shouta tapped on his laptop’s touchpad, the files appearing back on the screen. Tsukauchi had sent them to him a few days ago and while most of the information he now had access to were things that he already knew and was informed of earlier, it was good to have the original files in an easily accessible location. And this way, he wouldn’t have to keep messaging Tsukauchi if he needed something clarified.

A low murmur called to his attention as he started to scroll down to where he had been reading before his coffee break. Izuku was napping next to him, all curled up with his blanket covering him from the shoulder down. His eyes were closed, though his brows were fraught with distress.

Was it a nightmare?

While he tended to be home for Izuku's naps during the day, he hadn't been around much for whenever Izuku slept through the night. Assuming he slept through the night, at least.

Hizashi was pretty sure that Izuku spent hours awake after midnight staring out the window and only went to sleep when he heard the front door open, signaling Shouta's return from his patrol.

It was possible.

Hizashi usually sent him to bed every night, reading to him from a book of translated English fairy tales, before retiring to bed himself. But if Izuku stayed up, waiting for him to get home… It would explain all the naps during the day and his failing attempts to slowly switch around Izuku's sleep schedule. He had done his best to tire him out before his bedtime as well, hoping it would help him sleep soundly through the night. But he guessed he had underestimated how much energy a child could have. Especially for a child who was used to flying every single night. He would need to figure out an activity to help Izuku deplete all that pent up energy he must have.

He ran his fingers loosely through Izuku’s curls, before shifting him over a bit, propping his head onto his thigh as a makeshift pillow. Thankfully, Izuku settled with no further fuss, relaxing in a matter of seconds.

It was a regular enough occurrence for him when he was on the couch. Izuku seemed to sleep best with a source of warmth nearby, preferring to nap next to whoever was home with him.

To be honest, he should probably wake Izuku up. Allowing him to continue to nap like this every morning would only further enforce his nocturnal tendencies. For someone like him, that wasn’t an issue. But for a growing child like Izuku, it was less than optimal.

However, today was also the day they would be traveling to U.A. again. And though Izuku had been looking forward to it, nearly bouncing with excitement last evening, even sheer enthusiasm couldn’t make up for lost sleep.

It was going to be a busy afternoon for the two of them, and they would both need to be at their best.

So for now, he would leave Izuku to his nap while he reviewed files.

Shouta sighed.

A nap did seem incredibly tempting though, but…

He shifted his gaze back to Izuku’s peaceful sleeping face, feeling his lips curve into a smile. Izuku was depending on him and Hizashi to keep him safe. Had trusted them to keep him safe. Shouta was determined to do just that.

And it all started with locating Midoriya Hisashi and getting him into an interrogation room.

Returning his attention back to his screen, he resisted the urge to let out another sigh.

If only it were that easy.

Tsukauchi had told him the other day that the current address they had for Midoriya on file had been a dead end, a confused elderly man answering the door instead. When asked to answer a few questions about a possible previous occupant, Tsukauchi had found out that no ‘Midoriya’ nor ‘Hisashi’ had ever even lived there at all, the man being the sole occupant of the small apartment for the last ten years.

Furthermore, when Tsukauchi had stopped by the Midoriya’s old house near Shizuoka prefecture, he had discovered it had been sold a few months prior. The neighbors had confirmed that Midoriya had been living there until the sale was finalized though, so there was that, at least. Asking further questions gave them no additional information, though Tsukauchi did sound rather frustrated by all the shit the housewife that lived across the street said.

“It was ridiculous, Eraser!” He had groaned, “I could tell she didn’t mean it maliciously, but she was Midoriya-kun’s neighbor! Saying things like that, it could do real damage to a child!”

Shouta remembered that he had stayed silent while Tsukauchi ranted, wondering what that lady could have said to have incurred this type of reaction.

“It’s too bad that poor Inko-san had to leave that way, but at least her son is in a better place now,” Tsukauchi had scoffed as he repeated what was told to him, derision in his voice, “Quirkless in a world like this, it’s not a life worth living.”

In a way, it really was better that Tsukauchi had been the one doing the investigative work. Shouta knew he wouldn’t have been able to thank that lady for answering his questions like Tsukauchi did and leave without letting his fist meet her face first, probably.

He had seethed his entire way back, angry on Izuku’s behalf, only letting it slip free from his grasp when he had finally gotten home.

After all, how could he have stayed angry at the state of the world when Izuku greeted him with a chirped ‘welcome home!’ and handed him his favorite type of senbei, regaling him with the tale of his visit with Hizashi to the local shopping street.

When Izuku had curled up on the couch next him to take his nap, he had quietly relayed the sparse bits of new information to Hizashi, getting treated to a quiet snarl on his husband’s face.

And apart from that, he hadn’t heard from Tsukauchi since. Not that he expected quick updates, but he had hoped that this case would be easy to resolve. Izuku’s safety was their prerogative after all, and the longer Midoriya Hisashi stayed at large, the more likely it was for him to catch wind of Izuku’s survival.

As it stood, their current status as Izuku’s foster parents was as airtight as it could be, Izuku's former status as a police informant actually helping in that regard, affording him some extra protection he might not have had otherwise. Izuku’s special circumstances had even allowed him and Hizashi to skip past the entire process of contacting social services about Izuku, for now at least. Frankly, he was hoping that their applications for becoming prospective adoptive parents would get approved before social services had to get involved.

While Izuku was generally a very sweet child, this was the same child whose first reaction to being carried away by a stranger was to bite them. And somehow, Shouta didn’t see some social care worker being exempt from that sort of behavior.

As he scrolled through more of the files, he slowed down as he arrived at where he had last left off the previous evening.

At Izuku’s death certificate.

It made him angry, looking at the scanned document on his screen.

    Cause of Death [Enter only one cause per line for (a), (b), and (c)]

    Immediate cause:

    (a) Presumed immolation

    Due to, or as a consequence of:

    (b)

    Due to, or as a consequence of:

    (c)

    Other Significant Conditions: Conditions contributing to death but not resulting in the underlying cause of death

    Quirkless

    Manner of Death:

    Accidental

Shouta forced himself to take in a deep breath, huffing it out a few seconds later, his ire still bubbling under his skin.

Accidental.

How anyone could have decided whether someone was dead in the eyes of the law just like that, without any evidence, not even circumstantial, was horrifying to him.

And the fact that they had put down ‘Quirkless’ as a condition contributing to that supposed death?

Utterly disgusting.

It was a good thing that disputing a death certificate was easy with Izuku himself being physical proof.

Tsukauchi had warned him that once he had Izuku's death certificate rescinded though, if they weren't careful to keep the information quiet, news of it could spread among the general populace. If there was any way that Izuku's survival could make its way to Midoriya Hisashi's ears, it would likely be this way.

He also doubted Izuku would want that much attention directed at him. He knew how the media would react. A Quirkless child surviving on the streets only to appear again over a year later with a quirk? It was the exact sort of story the media would love to dig their claws into, regardless of what sort of trauma they could kick up in their never-ending crusade for the highest ratings.

Would ‘Midoriya Izuku’ even be a safe name for him to use in official settings anymore?

Shouta shook his head.

It was too early to be thinking about things like name changes.

But now that he was thinking about it, Aizawa Izuku did have a nice ring to it, didn’t it? It was entirely possible that Izuku would go with Hizashi’s former surname though. Yamada Izuku also sounded nice.

(It wasn’t a well known fact outside of their parents and closest friends, but when they had gotten married, they had ended up taking his name. It was something his parents had insisted on if he wanted to marry Hizashi and bring him into their family. Hizashi hadn’t put up any fuss, agreeing easily to it. He still defaulted back to ‘Yamada’ when introducing himself to people, but on official documents, his name was Aizawa Hizashi.)

Would Izuku want to even take one of their names though?

He hadn’t seemed too fond of being called ‘Midoriya’, even giving permission to Tsukauchi to use his given name the other day. And if he thought about it a bit more, he could recall other instances of Izuku avoiding his surname.

When Izuku worked on his handwriting, he would only write out 'Izuku.'

The notebook that he often carried around the apartment with him was labeled with just 'Izuku' as well. Izuku had asked him specifically to not write his full name that day.

He let out another sigh as he tapped the down arrow key, not wanting to look at some doctor’s false record. As a matter of fact, he was sure it was illegal in some way to sign off on a blatantly false death certificate. He would have to nudge Tsukauchi to track down the doctor who signed off on this thing. After Izuku was legally alive again at least.

That was another reason why seeing Recovery Girl today was important. She would be able to confirm Izuku’s physical wellbeing as well as his ‘alive’ status. Afterwards, they would just have to show up at a local government building with proper identification and paperwork, and that should hopefully be the end of it. He’d have to take Izuku to a quirk registration office eventually to register his quirk as well.

There was a lot he had to do in the near future.

Shouta tapped open a new file on his notes application, quickly listing out what needed to be done in the next couple of months. Summer holidays for students would start soon and streets always got busier at that time of year, day trips to the beach or whatnot clogging up public transportation. He’d prefer if all the paperwork for Izuku’s reentry to society got cleared up before that happened.

While Izuku seemed alright with short distance ventures outside, this visit to U.A. would be different. U.A. was a lot further away compared to the local shopping street and while it was a walkable distance for him, it wouldn’t be for Izuku.

He had offered to call a taxi for the two of them, but Izuku had refused, not wanting to get in the same space for so long with a random stranger. And bringing Izuku onto public transportation would be even worse. At the very least, with a taxi, you could ask the driver to stop and pull over. You couldn’t exactly do that on a bus or the train, unless you wanted to inconvenience every other occupant there.

In the end, Nedzu had contacted him, offering to send a faculty member out with a car for them, reassuring them that said faculty member was already going to be out doing some business on his behalf, so it would really be no trouble if they stopped by to pick them up before heading back to the school.

Shouta hadn’t wanted to do this, hadn’t wanted to be put into some odd form of debt to Nedzu, but there really was no other option that didn’t involve having Izuku do something he was still uncomfortable with doing. He had pondered asking if Hizashi could take the afternoon off to drive them there, but he knew that the weekends tended to be the busiest for him. Plus, Hizashi was banking on this new radio segment to give him that boost he needed in order to get that funding he needed for some new equipment the agency had been hoping to acquire. He couldn’t mess with that.

After asking Izuku his opinion on this and receiving a positive reply after reminding him that all U.A. faculty members were pro heroes, he had agreed to Nedzu’s offer. And depending on how long their visit was, it was likely that Hizashi would be able to pick them up afterwards. It all worked out.

He checked the time.

Half an hour before the car would arrive.

Tempted as he was to allow Izuku to continue his nap until they had to leave, he knew that if he did that, Izuku would spend the entire car ride napping as well. And while that didn’t seem like a bad idea, he knew that Izuku had been looking forward to meeting another pro hero. He hoped that whoever Nedzu had sent out to do his bidding today would be alright with the almost blatant staring that Izuku was bound to do for at least part of the ride there.

“Izuku,” He lightly shook at Izuku’s shoulder, “It’s time to wake up. We have to get ready.”

Izuku only gave him a tired hum, readjusting the position of his head before stilling again.

“Izuku.” Shouta tried again, “We have to get ready to go to U.A. You don’t want to keep Nedzu waiting, do you?”

“Ne-Nedzu-san..” Izuku murmured, voice still thick with sleep, “Tea…”

“That’s right,” He encouraged, a hand helping to prop Izuku into a sitting position, “I’m sure Nedzu will have some tea out for us when we get there.”

“‘m awake,” A small yawn escaped him even as he covered his mouth, nearly muffling the tiny squeak that also came out, “Ready for tea.”

"I'm sure you are," Shouta chuckled as he stood. He did some quick stretches; sitting in one position and having a child nap on your thigh wasn’t exactly conducive to good blood circulation. Izuku watched him silently, still blinking away the signs of sleepiness in his eyes. “Izuku, why don’t you get dressed first? It’ll be warm today; you don’t need a jacket.”

With a small nod and hum, Izuku slipped off the couch and padded away into the hallway. Shouta could hear a door open before creaking partly shut. He’d have to remember to oil that hinge later; that sound could get grating quickly.

He left the living room, heading to the entryway to pick up his messenger bag. Knowing that Izuku would likely want to take his notebook with him, bringing along something that could carry it was for the best. This way, he could even pack some jelly pouches for if Izuku got hungry as well. There was no doubt that Nedzu would have tea (decaffeinated tea at that) on the table for them, but as for snacks that were suitable for children? It was harder to imagine.

Pulling out muscat grape and peach flavored jelly pouches, he quickly tucked them into his bag’s front pocket. They were both flavors Izuku hadn’t tried yet, but had expressed interest in trying, so they were good choices to bring with him.

Shouta left the kitchen, dropping off his bag on the couch before heading into his and Hizashi’s shared bedroom. While he usually wouldn’t care what he wore outside, showing up at U.A. in his favorite pink sweats was probably pushing it. It was too bad; they were comfortable and easy to wear.

He quickly changed into something more suitable, remembering to grab his wallet from the nightstand, shoving it into his pocket. It was unlikely he would need to intervene into any situations this afternoon, but better safe than accidentally being arrested for using his quirk in public without his hero license in his pocket to back him up.

He could already imagine Izuku’s distraught look if that happened. He could also imagine Izuku choosing to bite yet another member of law enforcement. It really was for the best of both of them that he brought it along. There was no need for both of them to get arrested. Hizashi would be beside himself if he had to bail two people out. And given that Izuku wasn’t even legally alive in the eyes of the law yet? It would be a whole lot of trouble that could possibly alert Midoriya Hisashi of his son’s survival. No thanks.

By the time he had filled up some water bottles and tucked them away as well, Izuku came out of his room, the door’s creaking giving away his current location. Green eyes peered up at him, and Shouta couldn’t help staring at Izuku’s choice of clothing. It was something Hizashi had picked up the other day, impulse striking him again after he had bought that watermelon.

Izuku looked adorable in it, there was no doubt about that, but a hoodie in the summer was probably not a great idea.

“I thought I said you didn’t need a jacket?”

“A hoodie isn’t a jacket though,” Izuku had a bit of a smug look on his face, “And U.A. has air conditioners.”

Shouta chose not to mention that they also had an air conditioner at home, not that it had even been turned on once ever since Izuku had started living with them. But it was a good thing that Izuku was starting to feel more confident around him, enough to push against his suggestions at least.

“Alright, but if you get too hot, take it off, okay?”

“I’m not gonna get too hot,” Izuku insisted with a pout, “But okay... I’ll take it off if I get too hot.”

“Good,” Shouta knelt down, patting away some of the wrinkles and fixing the hood so that it wasn’t inside-out, “And there we go.”

“Oh!”

He paused as he stood, waiting for Izuku to elaborate on whatever he wanted to say. Izuku stared at him, eyes bright.

“Yes?”

“I’m gonna get it!”

Izuku rushed back down the hallway and into his room, reappearing in just a few seconds, his notebook in one hand and a loose sheet of paper in the other. The notebook, he could understand, but what was the other thing?

“It’s Nedzu-san,” Izuku turned the paper over so he could see that indeed, it was that picture of Nedzu that Izuku had drawn. The very thing that had even prompted this entire visit, “I’m gonna give it to him.”

To Nedzu?

Had Izuku really gotten that attached to the rat already? Enough to want to give him one of his drawings?

The one they had hanging on the refrigerator was actually one he had caught Izuku trying to slide into the trash can. He had managed to snag it though, holding it over Izuku’s head in order to see what it was.

It was a drawing of him, Hizashi, and Izuku together, all holding hands.

It was also adorable, full of charm. Even the sun had a smiley face on it.

So he had asked Izuku, who had given up jumping to get his drawing back a few seconds ago, why he wanted to throw away something like this.

“I don’t know how to draw shoes, so I drew grass to hide it, but I put it too low… And now it looks like we’re all floating,” He had whined, “Give it back, Aizawa-san.”

“You were going to throw it away though,” He had hummed, wiggling the drawing in his hand, “If you don’t want it and I do, then it’s only logical to let me have it.”

Hizashi had cried upon seeing it later that night.

“Happy tears,” He had reassured Izuku, who looked ready to burst into his own set of tears, “I love it! Thank you, Izuku!”

Hizashi’s positive reaction really must have affected something inside Izuku, because the very next afternoon, he had shown him a drawing of Present Mic he was working on.

“Is he fighting a villain?”

“Mhm.”

“Is he winning?”

“Yeah.”

“Nice.”

A crinkle of paper brought him back to the present, eager green eyes watching him.

“I’m sure he’ll enjoy it,” He chuckled, and oh Nedzu had better enjoy it, “Why don’t you put that into your notebook so it doesn’t get folded and you can put it into my bag?”

“Yeah!” Izuku beamed at him and Shouta found himself smiling back, “Are we gonna bring snacks too?”

“I have some jelly pouches packed,” He patted the front pocket lightly, “Is that alright with you?”

“I like jelly pouches,” Izuku nodded, “Is it watermelon again?”

“I have a grape one and a peach one.”

“You remembered!”

“I did,” Shouta nodded, carefully sliding Izuku's notebook into the main section of his bag, after it had been handed over to him, making sure the drawing wouldn’t slip out while it was in there, “Is there anything else you’d like to bring?”

Izuku hummed before giving a quick shake of the head.

“Do you need to use the toilet before we go?”

Another shake of the head.

“Alright,” He slid the strap of his messenger bag over a shoulder, piling his capture weapon over that as well, “Let’s go downstairs then. Whoever Nedzu sent should be here soon.”

Shouta tugged on a pair of well-worn sneakers while Izuku slid into the pair of sandals that Hizashi had bought him. He hadn’t wanted to decide on any other type of footwear without Izuku there next to him, so sandals it was.

They both exited the apartment; Shouta made sure to lock up behind them before stashing his keys away. While he would usually take the stairs, Izuku seemed to have his own idea on what to do, marching straight to the elevator, peeking behind him as if he was making sure he followed.

Hizashi must have brought Izuku down to the ground floor using the elevator the other day.

It was a good call.

While Izuku had only been getting more confident in his steps, even jumping up and down at times, stairs were something he didn’t want him trying on his own until they had some spare time where they could wholly focus on practicing.

“Do you want to push the button?”

Izuku nodded, his finger already reaching out to tap the down arrow button. The elevator arrived to their floor quickly, and just as quickly as they boarded, they got off. Being residents of an apartment building that housed mostly salarymen really was a blessing. It was already rare that he even saw anyone else in the building proper unless it was the morning or evening, but that they didn’t even have to wait to collect other passengers while going down to the ground floor? It was honestly great.

By the time they had exited their building, Izuku was already attached to his side, looking around cautiously, thankfully not in any sort of panic. The area they lived in was relatively quiet compared to some other places, and it was best illustrated now, when most people were not home.

“You doing good?”

Izuku tapped against his leg.

‘Yes.’

“Good,” Shouta gave his hair a light ruffle, “Tell me if you start feeling uncomfortable, okay?”

‘Yes.’

Honk

Izuku jolted at the sound, eyes searching for the culprit.

“Come on,” Shouta offered his hand to him, crossing the street when Izuku took it, careful to look both ways first, “Let’s not keep them waiting.”

In a matter of seconds, they arrived at the car. It was quite appropriately decked out in the subtle greys and desaturated blues. Especially for a pro hero looking to not attract any unnecessary attention, this was a good thing. He could recognize the pro sitting in the driver’s seat.

It was Ectoplasm.

He could see Izuku already ogling at the distinctive set of teeth that Ectoplasm had. There was no disgust or revulsion, but mostly admiration.

Did Izuku recognize him already?

Ectoplasm was dressed for duty right now, so his trademark trench coat and helmet combo were both easy enough to recognize.

Shouta opened the passenger door, giving Izuku a light nudge, directing him to enter first and then sliding in after him, closing the door and then buckling them in.

The gasp was easily heard in the small space of the car.

He turned to look at Izuku who now was wearing a look of faint worry, eyes still trained on Ectoplasm.

“Izuku?”

“Where are his eyeballs?”

Eyeballs? Did he mean pupils?

Shouta shot the most apologetic look he could over to Ectoplasm, not even sure if he could actually apologize for the tactless question from Izuku.

“You can drive with no eyeballs?”

“Pupils.”

“You can drive with no pupils?”

Shouta wanted to bury himself alive under a rock for a week.

“Sensei, I’m so sorry.”

“There’s no need to apologize,” He chuckled, “He is still a child, and a child’s curiosity is a powerful driving force.”

Izuku continued to watch them both, eyes big with wonder.

“He doesn’t mean any ill will with his questions,” Ectoplasm tilted his head, starting the car back up, “I can tell.”

“What is your name?” He directed the question to Izuku, pulling out of the temporary space he was parked in, “You may call me Ectoplasm.”

“I… I’m…” Izuku trailed off, clearly nervous when suddenly put on the spot, “I’m Izuku.”

“It’s very nice to meet you then, Izuku,” Ectoplasm replied, “And to answer your previous question, yes, I can see perfectly fine, so my driving is not impacted at all.”

“That’s so cool,” Izuku managed to whisper out, tapping at his arm, “Isn’t that so cool, Aizawa-san?”

“Yes,” Two weeks under a rock, please, “Very cool.”

“Could I ask another question?” Emboldened by the quick answer, Izuku continued on, stumbling on Ectoplasm’s name, “Ec-to-pla… plas-m-san?”

“You may.”

“Are your teeth for chewing?”

“They can be.”

“You must be really good at chewing.”

“Yes.”

Idly, Shouta wondered if it would set a bad example for Izuku if he threw himself out of a moving vehicle.

This was going to be a long car ride.


Notes:

    Izuku > *opens mouth*
    Shouta > (‘﹏*๑);;;;
    Shouta > *silently suffering*

    Oh Shouta, yes, it would set a bad example for Izuku :v The poor man!

    Everyone is trying their hardest, though it does vary in intensity. Aizawa had to try his hardest to not track down a certain doctor who signed off on certain things, Tsukauchi had to try to keep his composure because acting out would have brought more eyes to what he was trying to keep on the down-low, and Izuku was trying his hardest to draw the perfect picture for his Aizawa-san and Yamada-san ;v;

    Izuku really thinks Ectoplasm is cool though! He's just very blunt about it and Izuku isn't the best judge of his whispering volume at times xD

    But they're making their way to U.A. now! How fun! c:

    (In the previous chapter, there was so much crunching in the comments that I ended up doodling a short comic on Izuku cromching things xD It's not canon to the fic exactly, but! It could be in the future :D)

    Thanks for reading! Please let me know your thoughts! :D

Chapter Text

Izuku was having a great time.

While Ectoplasm’s name was really hard to pronounce, he was really nice, even giving him permission to call him ‘Ecto-san’ since he kept stumbling with the syllables of his name.

The car ride was nice as well. His hoodie kept him warm even with the cool air of the air conditioner blowing in his and Aizawa-san’s direction. He wasn’t sure Aizawa-san was having as nice of a time as he was though; he kept looking out the window with a strange look in his eyes.

Maybe Aizawa-san just didn’t like car rides?

He had offered to call a taxi for him though, so that couldn’t be it.

Or maybe Aizawa-san was nervous for some reason?

Izuku wasn’t sure why someone like Aizawa-san would be nervous, but that was alright. He got nervous about things pretty often. Like going outside, or trying to pronounce really hard names, or even accidentally missing his teeth with the toothbrush when he was brushing them.

He sidled over, having to wiggle quite a few times to get to where he wanted to be. One day, his legs would grow longer and he wouldn’t have to wiggle on car seats anymore if he wanted to move. He just knew it.

“It’s okay,” Reaching out with a hand, he patted Aizawa-san’s knee, repeating something that Yamada-san told him when he was nervous, “You’re doing great.”

Aizawa-san looked at him, eyes darting to where his hand was still patting, and then back to him.

“Thanks, kid?” He ducked his chin into his capture scarf, voice getting muffled, “You’re doing great too.”

Izuku couldn’t help the chirp that came out of his mouth, bumping his head affectionately into the shoulder next to his.

He was glad he could reassure Aizawa-san.

The rest of the car ride was spent in a comfortable silence.

Izuku spent most of that time wondering about Ectoplasm. With his big coat and teeth, he looked really cool! If he could bet, (which he couldn’t, for the rest of forever, according to Yamada-san), he would bet that Ectoplasm kept snacks in his coat. It would be such a good place to hide them; no one would ever think to go looking through a pro hero’s coat for snacks!

He also wondered what sort of quirk Ectoplasm had. He knew that a lot of the time, the name a pro used usually gave a hint to their quirk, but he had no idea what ectoplasm was or could be. It sounded like a foreign word, so perhaps he could ask Yamada-san later when he came to pick them up? He also had the option of asking Aizawa-san, or even Nedzu-san. It was nice to think about. He had a whole three people he could ask his questions to now.

Back then, it had just been his Mama. Asking Hisashi was never a good idea. And asking Kacchan… Asking Kacchan anything hadn’t worked ever since the results of that doctor’s appointment had been shared among their ‘friend’ group, though it wasn’t as if that information stayed within it for long.

“Izuku,” Aizawa-san’s voice murmured to him, “We’re here.”

They were?

Had he been thinking for that long?

He scooted over to one of the windows, peering out to see the familiar tall building that was U.A.

There it was!

Izuku couldn’t help the small pleased hum that left him. Was it odd that he was almost as equally as excited for this visit even though he and Aizawa-san had visited together once before? Maybe it was because he was visiting as human Izuku instead of owl Izuku?

Aizawa-san leaned over him, unlocking the door on his side, murmuring to be careful as he exited the car. Izuku nodded, turning and sliding out of the seat backwards and then sliding further down so his feet hit the ground. It was a perfect exit, if you asked him, despite Aizawa-san’s blank stare that tracked his movements.

This time, he would be able to talk to Nedzu-san instead of just tapping out answers to the questions he was asked! He'd be able to ask his own questions! That, in itself, was super exciting. Nedzu-san was super smart, (even Aizawa-san said so), so he had to be able to give him some sort of hint about using his quirk, right?

Well, he was pretty sure Nedzu-san’s quirk wasn't a transformation quirk like his, so he wouldn't be able to give him a hint based on his own experiences, but Nedzu-san mentioned in his email that he knew there was a student that had one…

He didn't want to admit it, but while he was interested in what that student might have to say about their own transformation quirk, that was probably the part that was looking forward to the least.

Aizawa-san had told him that there were three things that were likely going to happen today during their visit if all went as planned: the meeting with Nedzu-san, the one with Recovery Girl, and then also the meeting with that student with the transformation quirk.

There were going to be a lot of meetings in one day, but meeting again with Nedzu-san was something he had been really looking forward to for a while now. Even before he started to live with Aizawa-san and Yamada-san, if he had plucked up the courage to go visit U.A. and Nedzu-san again on his own, he would have tried. Probably.

Recovery Girl was a pro hero he remembered hearing about on the television before, known for traveling all across the country, helping people where she could.

(He also remembered asking his Mama if his quirklessness was something that could be healed with a quirk like Recovery Girl’s.)

(Mama had cried hearing his question.)

(Hisashi had laughed.)

Aizawa-san had spent a lot of time on the phone with her though, mostly talking about him and his health, stuff like that.

If he had to be truthful, his interest in what they talked about (or at least whatever he heard from Aizawa-san’s side of the conversation) had been lost once he had found out it was about him and his health.

He was pretty healthy, he thought. Sure, he was a bit cold sometimes, but it wasn’t anything a blanket and sweaters didn’t fix. And while having the chance to meet Recovery Girl was cool, (this was a pro hero, after all), she was still a doctor.

And thinking about doctors just reminded him of that doctor’s appointment, then of that question he asked, and finally of his Mama crying.

It just wasn’t something he liked thinking about, especially since he had a quirk now.

So it was like his Mama was crying in his memories for a reason that no longer existed.

(He knew it wasn’t possible, but he would have liked showing Mama his quirk at least once.)

"Izuku?"

Looking up at the call of his name, he saw Aizawa-san watching him and he wrinkled his nose as their gazes met. Aizawa-san should be watching where he walked instead of watching him! That was what Yamada-san reminded him of every time he bumped into things when he wasn’t paying attention to his surroundings.

What was it that Aizawa-san called it again?

Oh, right!

Si-tu-a-tion-al awareness.

Yeah, Aizawa-san needed more of that.

Because if Aizawa-san tripped or something, he wasn’t sure if he was strong enough to pick him up, so it was better if he didn’t trip in the first place.

It would be awkward though, to say things like that in front of someone who was still a stranger, though it was a pro hero stranger.

Because even after Aizawa-san had already nodded his thanks to Ectoplasm when they had parted ways at the entrance, Ectoplasm was somehow still nearby!

Did he have a quirk that made him go super fast?

That was the only way he could have both put the car away and then walk all the way from where all the cars were to where he and Aizawa-san were walking now.

It was odd; Izuku had thought that Ectoplasm would be going where teachers went whenever they weren’t teaching, but he was going in the same direction they were.

Was he also meeting with Nedzu-san?

It made sense.

Nedzu-san was the principal of a big important school like U.A.; it was logical that he had a lot of meetings every day, even on the weekend.

It was really nice of him then, to agree to a meeting that wasn’t really related to his job. Nedzu-san was probably a very busy person.

Still, he couldn’t wait to try Nedzu-san’s tea.

Walking was a novel thing when you were a parent, Shouta realized.

He had to keep in mind that Izuku’s legs were much shorter than his own. Was this a thing that all new parents had to keep in mind when out and about with their kid?

Hopefully no one still on campus had a mind-reading quirk or something along the lines of that. It would be embarrassing for these thoughts to be broadcasted in any way, shape, or form. Especially since his thoughts kept bouncing between ‘take smaller steps so Izuku can catch up’ and ‘is this what it’s going to feel like when he had to bring Izuku to school in the mornings?’

It wasn't even the first time he had held Izuku's hand, though it was the first time he was doing it in a public location.

Thankfully, it seemed that Izuku hadn't noticed his preoccupied thoughts.

There was a curious melancholy look in his eyes though, so he had called out his name, worried, only to have a wrinkled nose directed at him.

This was one of those times where he was abruptly reminded that Izuku was still a child, and a young child at that.

While It was true that he tended to treat Izuku as a small adult, much to Hizashi’s exasperation at times, he held no expectations for Izuku to act like one. It was just how he had always treated Izuku, even when he had only known him as Mimizuku. Despite all of that, Izuku did seem to flourish under his attention that way, asking him to clarify if the wording he used was too complicated, but never asking him to simplify his word usage.

“Izuku,” He repeated, “You seem distracted.”

And was that an affronted gasp?

That was definitely an affronted gasp.

“You’re the one distracted, Aizawa-san!” Izuku pouted at him, the sad look completely absent from his eyes now, “Not me!”

He couldn’t help the chuckle that left him, heart lightening as well. And while he was curious about what had been on Izuku’s mind, this wasn’t the right place to talk about it. Plus, Ectoplasm’s clone was still in earshot and Izuku’s past wasn’t something he wanted to be aired like dirty laundry.

(Not that they aired their laundry; Hizashi had been afraid pigeons would shit on it, and even after the timely demise of the balcony pigeon, there had been the distinct possibility that Izuku might have flown into it while coming to visit. And he really didn’t need more holes in his hero uniform.)

He would have to ask later, when they were home again, what Izuku wanted as his cover story. But for now, it was best to keep everything on a need-to-know basis.

“See?” Izuku puffed out his cheeks, looking remarkably like a squirrel that was trying to hoard nuts in the face of a disaster, “You’re distracted!” He peered behind them, lowering his voice as he continued to speak, “If you trip and fall, I’m gonna tell Yamada-san, and he’ll probably laugh at you.”

What a fucking adorable child he had.

Adorable and observant enough to realize that yes, Hizashi likely would laugh at him if he tripped due to distraction, especially since he always touted the virtues of situational awareness at all times.

“You’re doing it again,” A finger poked him in the leg, once and then twice, “What’s distracting you?”

Izuku looked around them again, as if something would suddenly pop up, declaring itself a distraction, but alas, they were only surrounded by the trees that lined the path to U.A.’s front door. The sound of the fountain’s rushing water and the distant murmur of student’s voices surrounded them.

“Just thinking about things,” He mused, tugging back Izuku’s hand so he didn’t trip into the fountain looking in, “Be careful. Or else I’ll be the one telling funny stories to Hizashi later tonight.”

Shouta let out a bark of laughter when Izuku’s sole response was to bump the side of his head against him. If Izuku were an owl right now, he was sure his fingers would be getting nipped at.

“Come on, Izuku, we’re almost at the school,” Izuku swung his gaze up at his words, indignance immediately forgotten and eyes big, “Ready?”

‘Yes.’

He could feel a finger tap his palm, Izuku humming and nearly bouncing in anticipation next to him.

The stairs were thankfully an easy climb, Izuku stepping up onto one step fully before continuing onto the next one. It was a bit trickier since there were no railings he could hold onto, but Shouta supposed the steadiness of his hand did enough to help.

They entered the school together, Izuku immediately shrinking into his side at the sight of the secretary sitting at the front desk. Shouta gave him a reassuring look, as reassuring as he could make it anyways, and stepped forward.

“We have an appointment with the Principal Nedzu,” He fished out his residential registration card from his wallet, sliding it forward onto the desk, “Aizawa Shouta and Izuku.”

Eyes quickly scanned his card, their owner giving him a curt nod, allowing him to take it back into his possession. They returned their focus back to the screen of the computer they were working off of, fingers tapping quickly on the keyboard.

“The principal is ready to see you two,” They were waved through with a smile, “Do you need an escort?”

“No need,” He shook his head, “But thanks for the offer.”

A gentle tug was all it took to get Izuku to follow him, his steps lacking any uncertainty. Did Izuku remember the way to Nedzu’s office from the previous visit? He was tempted to allow Izuku to lead them there instead, but potentially having to travel from the other end of the school back to Nedzu’s office would definitely make them late. Maybe if they came back for yet another visit in the future, he could ask Izuku to try, but not this time.

By the time they walked past the teacher’s lounge, Izuku was practically vibrating in place. The sheer amount of energy a child could have was amazing, he had to admit. Especially since this was Izuku in the afternoon when he usually wanted to nap instead.

The door of the principal’s office creaked open as he brought his hand up to knock, surprising Izuku, if his gasp was any indication. He sighed, nudging Izuku into the room as he also walked in, the door closing silently behind them.

“Am I a mouse? A dog? A bear?” Nedzu sat at his desk, a paw raised in greeting, “I’m the Principal of U.A.!”

“It’s Nedzu-san!”

Izuku beamed, hand tugging at his pant leg as he whispered loudly to him. And from the small twitch of Nedzu’s ears, he was sure Nedzu heard as well.

“Sensei, thanks for hosting us,” He nodded, “I hope we aren’t causing you any trouble.”

“Of course not,” Shouta shrugged at the reply as he sat, pulling the other chair close to his own so Izuku could sit right next to him, “Please make yourself at home!”

Izuku clambered into the chair as Nedzu pushed forward a tray already occupied with cups of chilled tea. He snagged one up, breathing in the faint toasty scent before taking a small sip.

Barley tea.

“I promised you tea the next time we met, didn’t I?”

Green eyes met beady black ones.

“Izuku-kun?”


Notes:

    Izuku > Tea time at Nedzu-san's!
    Shouta > We have tea at home.
    99% of the tea at home > *caffeinated*
    Shouta > 눈_눈;;; Fine.

    Izuku thinks a lot this chapter, about Shouta, about his past, and about the near future. He has a lot of things on his mind right now, though Shouta's also thinking about things, but on the more typical end, like being a parent and walking with a child next to him.. Still important things to think about, yeah.

    And yes, Izuku is currently a firm believer of "teachers live at school; what do you mean they have lives of their own". He'll figure it out eventually xD

    Nedzu has finally made another physical appearance! And with him, he has a nice cool refreshing drink, perfect for summer. And it has no caffeine xD He did some research on human children this time :P

    Thanks for reading! Please let me know your thoughts! :D

    Next chapter comes out September 18th! Many questions are asked and Nedzu is faced with a gift!

Chapter Text

Nedzu-san was just as he remembered him.

Very fluffy and strange, but in a good way. Every time that white tail swayed though, he couldn’t help but watch it and he was pretty sure Nedzu-san noticed this because he kept it on the move while he was greeting Aizawa-san, only to rest it in his lap when greeting him, like he was trying to get his attention.

The barley tea that Nedzu-san had served them was chilled with only a hint of sweetness.

It was really good, smelling kind of like nuts! And it didn’t even have caffeine in it!

(Nedzu-san had reassured him of this when he had asked.)

Aizawa-san didn’t let him have much tea at home, explaining that caffeine (which was in both his coffee and tea) wasn’t very good for kids, that it would make him sleep less and possibly give him headaches, along with a bunch of other bad health things.

(He even explained that they did have decaffeinated tea, but it was ginger tea, and he knew that Izuku didn’t really like the sharp spicy taste it had.)

Once he had found out about that, he did his best to not even smell Aizawa-san’s coffee, covering his nose when a cup of it was placed on the table, scared that smelling it would make his head hurt. Yamada-san had thought that was hilarious and had offered to bring home some nice drinks that didn’t have caffeine in them.

(Izuku hoped that barley tea was one of the ones that Yamada-san would bring back.)

Nedzu-san really was so smart though, choosing to brew a tea that had no caffeine for their visit. Was he also looking out for his health? Headaches really were horrible things.

It was then that he remembered.

“Aizawa-san,” He carefully patted at the bag Aizawa-san had placed next to him, balanced precariously on the edge of the seat, “My notebook, please.”

“Sure,” His notebook was pulled out and handed to him, Aizawa-san taking his tea in exchange, “Here you go.”

He nodded his thanks, opening it up and taking out the drawing he had done of Nedzu-san.

“It’s for you.”

Nedzu-san looked surprised as he placed the sheet of paper down onto the desk, poking it forward as much as he could. Izuku sort of wished his arms were longer; he’d be able to hand it to Nedzu-san directly instead of sliding it slowly in his direction.

“Oh?” A white paw picked up his drawing, “Why, Izuku-kun, this is delightful!”

“It’s a gift for you,” Izuku could feel his face get warm, his voice getting lower as he spoke, “For inviting us to U.A. and sharing your tea.”

“You… are a very sweet child, Izuku-kun,” Nedzu-san had a small smile on his face, the tip of his tail flicking upwards, “Are you sure you wish to give this to me?”

He nodded.

“You’re the principal of U.A., so that means you must be really busy all the time…” Izuku did his best to not hide his face in Aizawa-san’s arm, no matter how tempted he was, “And you still made time to see us,” His voice was just barely above a whisper now, “I also… I also think you’re a cool hero.”

Nedzu-san was one of the heroes he had asked Aizawa-san about, after putting Eraserhead and Present Mic in his notebook. Mr. Principal was a funny hero name, but he liked it. Plus, even though Aizawa-san would make strange faces whenever he talked about Nedzu-san, he still spoke about him with approval. That meant that even Aizawa-san thought he was a good hero, and if Aizawa-san thought so, then it was probably true.

Izuku liked hearing about heroes that didn’t just rely on strength.

(He still did like All Might, but his quirk was nothing like his. And that was okay too.)

Before getting his quirk, he had wanted to use his brain to be a hero, so Nedzu-san doing that made him feel like he could have done it too. Now that he had his quirk, even though he couldn’t use it at all, his dream of being a hero was given new life.

There was only one thing that didn’t change; he was sure he’d still have to use his brain. His quirk didn’t give him explosions like Kacchan or overwhelming power like All Might; all he could do was transform into an owl. And it was a normal owl at that, probably. He would definitely need to use his brain to think of ideas on how an owl could be a hero.

If there was one thing he was sure of, it was that he knew his abilities as an owl very well. He knew how much grip strength he needed to exert to stand on someone’s arm without breaking anything. He knew how to sneak up on prey and catch them so they didn’t even see him coming. And owls could fly! Most humans couldn’t fly. So that was another ad-van-tage he had with his quirk.

“That makes me happy to hear,” Nedzu-san chirped, his ears wiggling, “I shall gladly accept your offering!”

‘Offering’?

Did that mean the same thing as ‘gift’?

Aizawa-san made a small coughing sound, and Izuku turned to look up at him again.

“Drink tea, Aizawa-san,” He urged, “It’s good for coughs.”

Well, he was pretty sure it was at least.

It didn’t hurt to try.

“Speaking of tea, Izuku-kun,” Nedzu-san said, pulling open one of the drawers of his desk, placing the drawing in, “How are you enjoying the tea I prepared?”

“It’s really good,” Definitely better than the ginger tea back at home, “I like it a lot.”

Nedzu-san looked very pleased to hear that, ears flicking forward just a bit.

“Hydration is important in the summer, after all,” His tail slipped off his lap, wagging almost, “Now, to get down to business. I believe you have questions for me, Izuku-kun?”

“Oh, I, yes,” He did have questions. Big important ones that he really needed to find out the answers to, “I wanted to ask you if you knew how to activate transformation quirks that ma-ni-fest-ed ‘cause of stress.”

“Stress-induced quirks…” Nedzu-san hummed as he refilled Aizawa-san’s empty glass, “An interesting subject, to say the least.”

He didn’t sound confused hearing his question, so that meant that Nedzu-san knew about them, right?

“A method of quirk manifestation that is unknowingly invoked by its user in order to survive, so they can live to fight another day,” He paused, taking a sip of his own tea, “There are those that would argue that these types of manifestations are how quirks truly originated, enabling the survival and evolution of the human race.”

“I thought that the first quirk user was the glowing baby?” Izuku was puzzled, “How would glowing help someone survive?”

“How much do you know about pregnancy, Izuku-kun?”

What was that?

He turned to stare up at Aizawa-san, hoping for a definition of what preg-nan-cy was.

”Sensei!” Aizawa-san groaned instead of explaining to him, “He’s a child! They don't learn this at his age!”

What did him being a kid have to do with that?

Nedzu-san only tilted his head to the side, his ears twitching.

“I see,” And with a clap of his paws, he returned his attention back to him, “Well, let’s approach this from a different angle!”

Izuku nodded, not knowing what to even say in response.

Maybe he’d ask Yamada-san what preg-nan-cy was later, but for now, he’d just keep wondering in the back of his mind.

“Where a baby comes from, it is very dark and warm. This darkness and that warmth is all the baby knows. When that baby emerges into the world that we live in, they start to cry. It’s a shock to their system after all. Out here, compared to where they once were, it is bright and cold. But they are resilient, crying out for help, for warmth, for their mother.”

Izuku sat there listening, trying to figure out what Nedzu-san could be trying to teach him.

If a baby was in a dark and warm place… And it was what they were used to… And then things happen and a baby appeared… Wanting their mother…

Oh!

He raised his hand up. It was one of the few things he did remember from daycare. You had to raise your hand before you spoke when questions were being asked.

“Oh, go ahead, Izuku-kun,” Nedzu-san waved a paw at him, “No need to raise your hand. You’re not in class right now.”

He put down his hand, pouting. U.A. was a school, so it made sense to raise his hand to answer a question. But since this was Nedzu-san’s school, it meant that he made all the rules. So no more raising hands for Nedzu-san’s questions.

“I was thinking…” Izuku resisted the urge to kick his feet out as he spoke, his dangling legs not even reaching the floor, “If the baby was looking for their mom… Then glowing would be good, right? If the baby was glowing, then the mom could find the baby and give hugs. And the baby wouldn’t be cold ‘cause hugs are warm.”

“Very good!” White paws clapped happily at his answer, “That is indeed reminiscent of the argument that is made in regards to the first widely documented quirk! You demonstrate quite the impressive logical thinking for your age, Izuku-kun!”

Izuku could feel himself flush at the compliment.

“Aizawa-san is really good at thinking with logic,” He murmured, hand looping itself around the elbow next to him, “I learned it from him.”

“Oh?” Nedzu-san hummed, “Would you say then, that Aizawa-kun is a good teacher?”

“The best teacher.”

Izuku nodded as Nedzu-san chuckled, his tail moving like a worm behind him.

“It’s not like I taught it to him specifically, you know,” Aizawa-san grumbled, though Izuku could tell he wasn’t truly annoyed, “Izuku is a bright kid; he probably picked it up from all the watching he did.” A gentle calloused hand patted his head, “You’re getting off track though, sensei. We’re here for Izuku’s quirk in particular, not a brief history on how the first stress-induced quirk manifestation might have happened.”

“Oh, very well,” If Izuku didn’t know better, he would say Nedzu-san was a bit put out from Aizawa-san’s words; he was a teacher after all, right? He must have taught so many students, all of which were probably bigger and smarter than he was, so it made no sense if Nedzu-san was even the least bit sad that he couldn’t continue with talking about things with Izuku, “You’ve always been a stickler for these types of things, Aizawa-kun.”

“And for good reason,” A sigh left Aizawa-san’s mouth, though soon his chin was hidden behind the material of his capture scarf once again, “You’re long-winded even on the best of days.” Dark eyes peered over at him, crinkling kindly when they met his gaze, “But Izuku’s a kid. You can’t treat him like one of your high school students.”

Was Nedzu-san treating him that way?

He hadn’t really noticed, but then again, he didn’t really have much to compare to. What little he still remembered from daycare was almost useless for that. High school was high school and daycare was daycare after all. They were two very different things! What the students in high school learned was probably a lot harder than things they focused on in daycare. Like… multiplication… or taxes…

“See?” Something tapped his shoulder, “Izuku’s already lost focus.”

He turned to look up at Aizawa-san who only raised his eyebrows up at his confused expression.

“I see I still have much to learn about human children,” Nedzu-san mused before clapping his paws together once, though it didn’t exactly produce a sound that he could hear, “But let us get back on subject, transformation quirks!”

Izuku perked up.

Was this it?

Was this where he would figure out how to activate his quirk again?

“I’m afraid I cannot offer any personal advice for quirk activation,” White ears tilted downwards and he also slumped down as well, “High Spec is a mutation quirk, so all advice I can potentially offer you would be from second-hand accounts.” And in a flash, his ear flicked back up again, “However! I am an educator at heart, so do not worry, Izuku-kun. I am still very much capable of giving you more general advice and enabling you to be on the path of success!”

Success?

That meant Nedzu-san thought he could do it, right?

“I really do believe a first-hand account would be the most beneficial, but as classes are still in session, that will have to wait,” Nedzu-san tilted his head, eyes trailing to look at the small digital clock on his desk, “But if I am not mistaken, U.A.’s very own Recovery Girl is just about to make an appearance!”

Just as he announced that, (and yes, Izuku was sure he was announcing this and not just making a statement), the door behind them swung open.

Izuku spun around at the creaking sound the door made, very thankful that Aizawa-san was sitting next to him because if he wasn’t, he probably would have slipped off his chair instead of being caught like he had been. He knew he was getting better at not startling at sudden noises, but it did get old the first few times. His owl hearing would have been so helpful in letting him know that there was someone behind him.

(Home was usually pretty quiet. And he always knew if someone was home. Both Aizawa-san and Yamada-san usually announced their presence to him if they knew he was in the room. It was something they started doing after that one time where Aizawa-san accidentally snuck up on him in the kitchen and tapped his shoulder, surprising him enough that he dropped his cup of water.)

“Oh dear,” Recovery Girl stood at the entryway, “Did I come at a bad time?”

"It's Recovery Girl!" He whispered to Aizawa-san, still hanging from his grip, "It's really her!"

“It sure is,” Aizawa-san said as he placed him onto the floor, making sure he was standing before letting go, and giving him a small nod, “Why don’t you go introduce yourself?”

Izuku gave him a small nod in return. It was just introducing himself. That shouldn’t be too hard at all! He could do this!

“I… I’m Izuku,” He bowed, “Call me Izuku please.”

“You’re just as polite as I was told,” Recovery Girl chuckled, giving him a nod, “I am Shuuzenji Chiyo. Feel free to refer to me with whatever you’re comfortable with, alright?”

With what he was comfortable with?

“Shu-u-zen-ji-san?” He watched her face carefully, wanting to make sure she really didn’t mind being called that. Even if Recovery Girl was a pro hero, (a really cool pro hero at that), she was still a doctor. And doctors could ruin your life with only a few words, he knew that all too well. It was better to be on her good side.

“That’s fine with me,” She gave him a small smile and he did his best to smile back, though he wasn’t sure he succeeded, “You have a very nice outfit on. Do you like cats?”

Oh!

He had forgotten to show Nedzu-san his outfit!

This visit to see Nedzu-san at U.A. was the whole reason he wanted to wear this hoodie in the first place!

But first he had to answer Shuuzenji-san’s question.

“Aizawa-san likes cats. I like owls more, but cats are cool too.”

And with that taken care of, he spun around, excitement making him hop in place a bit.

“Nedzu-san, look!” He pulled up the hood of his hoodie over his head, the ears that were previously unnoticeable sticking up proudly now, “Ears like yours!” When he was sure that Nedzu-san had seen the ears, he made a small half-turn, twisting to show him the back of the outfit, “And a tail like yours!”

“This is why you wanted to wear that on such a hot day?” He heard Aizawa-san exhale, amusement in his tone, “I could have just taken a photo of you in it and sent it by email or something.”

He could have, but it was different showing it in-person. Nedzu-san wouldn’t be able to see how soft it was just from a photo. And it was important to show that it was soft. Because Nedzu-san’s fur also looked very soft.

“Actually, since we’re here,” Aizawa-san turned, shifting in his seat, now able to face him without twisting himself like one of those pretzels that Yamada-san liked to share with him when he got them fresh and still soft, “Sensei, would you like to take a photo with Izuku? I think he’d like that.”

He would!

Izuku nodded, making sure that his agreement was obvious.

“Well now, Nedzu,” He could hear Recovery Girl laugh behind him, “You can’t refuse something like that.”

“Indeed!” Nedzu-san said as he slid down from his chair, “What sort of hero would I be to refuse a request like that?” He chuckled to himself, “Barring the arrival of a villain attack or a world-ending event, at least, but that is not an issue we have to face here today, now is it?”

He shook his head as Aizawa-san sighed.

As Nedzu-san came closer to him, Izuku could feel himself straighten up.

He was bigger than Nedzu-san now! Owl Izuku was smaller, but human Izuku wasn’t! It made a part inside of him feel satisfied knowing this.

By the time they were standing next to each other, Aizawa-san had already aimed his phone at them.

“Sensei, can you sit?” He moved the empty chair to them before returning to his own seat, “Izuku, stay standing.”

Aizawa-san grabbed his phone again from the desk where had left it right before, waited for his instructions to be obeyed, and started to presumably take photos.

“So, Izuku-kun,” Nedzu-san grinned, though he wasn’t facing him, but towards Aizawa-san, “Do you think I’m a mouse, a dog, or a bear?”

A mouse, a dog, or a bear?

Izuku knew what mice and dogs looked like, had seen them in parks often, and he was sure Nedzu-san wasn’t one of them. A bear though… He wasn’t even sure what a bear looked like.

(If he thought about it, Aizawa-san always called Nedzu-san a rat at home, but he was pretty sure that wasn’t the answer either. He’s eaten a lot of rats. Nedzu-san wasn’t a rat.)

Did it really matter what Nedzu-san was though?

It was like him.

There was him as an owl and him as a human.

But in the end, he was just Izuku to Aizawa-san and Yamada-san.

“You’re Nedzu.”

He could hear the click of the camera go off on Aizawa-san’s phone.

“Pardo-” A small cough interrupted the word being said, “Could you repeat that?”

“You’re… Nedzu?”

There was a pause.

Izuku began to count the seconds.

One.

Two.

Three.

A sudden burst of laughter broke the silence, soon muffled by a white paw.

“I do think, Izuku-kun, that you and I are going to get along very well in the future!”

“Thank you?”

“And that’s the photo. I’ll send you a copy later if you’d like.” Aizawa-san stood, making his way over to them, “We going to have our talk with Shuuzenji-sensei now though, since she has some free time.”

He took Aizawa-san’s outstretched hand, waving to Nedzu-san with his other hand.

Recovery Girl had already left the room, though he could still hear the sound of her cane hitting the tile of the floor, which told him that she wasn’t very far away from them.

“By the time you finish up there, classes will have ended for the day,” Nedzu-san waved back at him, “I’ll see you two soon!”

Izuku followed Aizawa-san out of Nedzu-san’s office, the door silently closing behind them.

Soon.

He told himself.

Soon.

He just had to get through the meeting with Recovery Girl first.

If he wanted to learn how to fly again, it was what he had to do.

He could do this.

    Izuku is also gonna finagle their copy of the photo into the family album :P

    And Nedzu’s little tackboard has his new photo, his first piece of official merchandise (the sticker), an article published in a local newspaper when he became principal, and a knock-off All Might calendar.

    Thanks for reading! Please let me know your thoughts! :D

Chapter Text

Shouta was glad to be out of Nedzu’s office.

Not that it was stifling or anything of the sort, but he could recognize that gleam in Nedzu's eyes and it had been a knee-jerk reaction to get Izuku and himself out of the immediate way of whatever plans that were no doubt being constructed right that second.

Being in the infirmary really wasn't much of an improvement either though.

Not when Izuku kept glancing up at him as Recovery Girl did his checkup, giving him uncertain looks every minute or so. It made him feel guilty that he couldn’t help him out more in this situation. There was only so much he could do beyond offering his presence and insisting that Recovery Girl explain every single thing she was doing and the reasoning behind it.

So he stayed close by, or as close as he could be without getting in Recovery Girl’s way; after all, getting in the way in her office was a sure way to get his knees smacked by her cane.

(Shouta was infinitely glad that Izuku was already up-to-date with all his vaccines. They wouldn’t have to worry about those for another year or two.)

The medical forms he had sent to Recovery Girl before their visit were a huge help in that regard. With them, they were able to know if Izuku had any pre-existing health conditions or if there was any medications he might have an adverse reaction to. Thankfully, Izuku had been a perfectly healthy child at the age of six. The date of his last medical checkup had only even been a couple of days after his birthday, so there was practically a nonexistent chance he had gotten any medical care since he had gone into hiding.

On the other hand, that meant that Recovery Girl had to start from scratch with a physical, updating his records as much as she could. It was a good thing that Nedzu had clearly spared no expense at outfitting Recovery Girl with whatever she wanted or needed; this meant that unless Izuku needed to see some sort of specialist for something, the majority of what needed to be done could be done here.

They had discovered some interesting things, if not mildly worrying, as well.

Like the fact that Izuku had barely grown in height since his last checkup. He was more worried about that than Recovery Girl was, to be honest. Kids were supposed to grow taller usually at this age, right? Tensei’s younger brother seemed to get taller every single time they saw him. And he was pretty sure he had grown in height at this age.

Also, things like bone density differences were apparently common enough in animal-based transformation quirks that Recovery Girl had thought it warranted checking out. Seeing that it might affect what they cooked for Izuku, he agreed to get it done.

Shuuzenji-sensei had insisted on a blood test first though and Shouta had to suppress a shiver when he had heard that. He was more desensitized to things like that nowadays but he had hated blood tests as a kid. There was something about seeing your own blood leave your body that made him want to wriggle out of his own skin.

Izuku was a braver kid than he had been, though he did insist on holding Shouta’s hand with his free one and turned away so he didn’t have to look. For a kid that usually shedded tears at the drop of a hat, there weren’t any during the blood test. When Recovery Girl had allowed him to choose what bandaid he could have, he had been disappointed that there weren’t any Present Mic or Eraserhead bandaids. In the end, he had gone with one with Best Jeanist on it, claiming that ‘Yamada-san thinks he’s cool and fashionable’.

(That was an alright opinion, but Shouta stood by the fact that if Hizashi ever tried to dress like Best Jeanist? Well, no one was going to like the results of that situation. Best that it never happened.)

She had actually saved the bone-density test for last, mentioning quietly to him that she had seen the x-rays of Izuku’s foot in the files sent to her, and had assumed that having one taken might potentially bring back bad memories, even though what they were testing used his forearm.

It had been a nerve-wracking ten minutes for him, even though he could see Izuku through the large window there. Recovery Girl had even laughed at him, saying that he was experiencing a core part of being a new parent.

He grumbled, pulling out his phone, checking for any new updates from Tsukauchi on the Midoriya case instead.

Nothing.

Instead, he scrolled through his text notifications, most of which were from Hizashi, but there were a couple from Tensei and Nemuri, both asking if he had plans for Hizashi’s birthday this year yet.

That was right.

Hizashi’s birthday was coming up.

Usually the four of them would meet up for a night at a bar for a few rounds together, but this year, that wouldn’t be possible.

They had Izuku now.

It wasn’t just themselves they were responsible for anymore, but Izuku as well, and that made all the difference.

Shouta didn’t want to be the sort of parent who would dump the responsibility of a child onto someone else just to go drinking, not if it involved leaving Izuku at home all alone, and definitely not if it involved having to face the likely disappointed face of Izuku in the morning after.

Even if they had someone trustworthy babysit, the amount of people on that list was tiny. And half of the people on it wouldn’t even be available since they would also be at the bar with him and Hizashi. The other half… The other half was tentative. They were up there in his preference of people he could probably trust, but only time could really tell for something like that.

It just wasn’t enough for him to let them watch Izuku for a night.

Plus, Izuku didn’t even like Tsukauchi that much. And though Izuku did like Nedzu, there was no way he was leaving Izuku with Nedzu unsupervised.

Bad idea.

Never happening.

Illogical.

He sighed.

It would have to be something he would discuss with Hizashi later and perhaps Izuku as well.

“And there we go,” Recovery Girl murmured, tapping at her computer, “We should have everything we need now.”

“We’re done?”

Shouta barely even registered that he was the one speaking, already sliding his phone back into his pocket.

“For now,” She replied, “Though I do suggest making an appointment with a nutrition specialist sooner rather than later. Transformation quirks can be tricky that way.”

“Do you have any recommendations?” He asked as she left her seat, making her way to the door that separated this room from the one Izuku was in, “For nutritionists?”

“I’ll send you a list later.” She opened the door, stepping in and minutes later, coming back out with Izuku, “I’ve brought you back your child, Aizawa.” She gave Izuku a light push forward, “Go ahead, Izuku-kun.”

In mere seconds, Izuku attached himself to his side, hand curled into his shirt, acting as if they had been separated for months instead of minutes.

He could understand it though.

Was this what Recovery Girl meant earlier?

Core part of being a new parent, huh.

She was off her rocker.

Izuku rushed forward as soon as he could.

While Shuuzenji-san was right in that the test she had him do didn’t hurt, it was still a cold in that room. Aizawa-san was warm though, so he couldn’t help but to latch on to him, stealing a bit of that warmth for himself.

“You alright?” Aizawa-san asked, a hand landing on his shoulder as he nodded to him, leading them back to the chairs by Shuuzenji-sensei’s desk, “Let’s sit down while Shuuzenji-sensei goes over the results with us.”

He sat down next to Aizawa-san.

Shuuzenji-san sat on her big chair in front of them, turning to open a drawer in her desk, revealing the contents to be candy. Lots and lots of candies, all sorted by color in little rectangular sections.

“Would you like one, Izuku-kun?” She asked, “As a thank you for all the patience you’ve shown us while I got your medical files updated.”

He couldn’t help but lean forward for a better look, bracing himself against Aizawa-san’s knee so he wouldn’t fall down. There really were so many; it was possibly the most candy he had ever seen in one place. Just how many did she keep in there? Were they all for the students? What flavors were there?

“Izuku, you’re mumbling,” Aizawa-san said as he easily swept him up, placing him so that he was sitting on his lap, an arm around his middle so even when he did lean forward, he didn’t fall, “Slowly, one by one, if you want them all answered.”

Izuku paused to think, a small hum leaving his lips.

Did he want to ask all his questions?

Not really.

Not if it only extended the amount of time they had to be in here.

And Shuuzenji-san hadn’t even started going over the results yet!

He didn’t want to spend forever in this cold room smelling that same scent all the time. Aizawa-san had called it dis-in-fec-tant when he had asked, saying that it was what people used to make things clean of bad germs. And if there were bad germs in the air so often that they made the place smell like this, then Izuku really didn’t want to stay here for too long.

But there was one question he wanted to know the answer to though, so just one question should be alright.

“Do you have lemon flavor?”

“Of course I do, dearie,” Shuuzenji-san smiled at him, picking out a candy wrapped in a pale yellow wrapper, “Here you go.”

He opened his hands to accept it with a small smile.

“Thank you, Shu-u-zen-ji-san.”

He then turned a bit to pat Aizawa-san on the arm, looking up to meet slightly confused eyes.

“Aizawa-san?” He murmured, tilting his head to the side as his thoughts raced, “Is something wrong?”

“No, nothing’s wrong,” Aizawa-san replied with a shake of the head, “I thought you didn’t like lemon though? You told me lemons were too sour the other day.”

“Yamada-san likes lemons,” And that was a fact. He had seen Yamada-san peel one open and eat the wedges inside. Yamada-san had offered him a bite too and he had tried it, but… they were really sour. He didn’t understand how Yamada-san could eat something like that, “I’m gonna give it to Yamada-san.” He patted Aizawa-san’s arm again, “Can you put it in your bag for later?”

“Why didn’t you choose something for yourself?” Aizawa-san unzipped the front pocket of his bag, holding it open for him, “Hizashi is fully capable of getting his own lemon-flavored goods.”

“So Yamada-san won’t feel as bad for not being able to come with us,” He dropped the candy in, “He looked a bit sad this morning when he left for work even though you made him a bento.”

“Well, that just won’t do,” Shuuzenji-san tutted, “Choose one for yourself.”

“... Salty li-cor-ice?”

“Izuku,” Aizawa-san sighed, “You can’t just choose something for me either.”

“Aizawa-san deserves candy too,” He looked up at him, eyes imploring, “Please?”

“Now, now,” Shuuzenji-san chuckled, handing him another candy, a black wrapper twisted around it, “Another extra candy isn’t going to hurt. But this time you need to choose one just for yourself, alright, Izuku-kun?”

He nodded, already knowing which flavor he wanted.

“Watermelon.”

“Oh?” She turned to look in her candy drawer, “Well, you’re in luck. I’ve got gummies and hard candies that are watermelon flavored. Which would you prefer?”

“Gummy, please.”

A brightly wrapped candy was placed in his hand, the contents soft and squishy when he lightly squished it between two fingers. He turned to drop them both into Aizawa-san’s bag, now satisfied with the situation. They could all have candy together when Yamada-san came to pick them up later!

“Now, let me go through the results with the two of you,” Shuuzenji-san tapped at her keyboard, navigating whatever program she was using for her doctor things until she arrived at where she wanted to be, “Let’s start things simple, shall we?”

“Please,” Aizawa-san bowed his head slightly, his chin bumping against the top of his own, “We’re in your care.”

“I’ve mentioned this to you earlier, Aizawa, but I don’t believe Izuku-kun’s current stagnation in height is a cause for worry. In these times, both height and weight are more arbitrary when quirks have to be taken into account.”

“You think this was caused by his quirk?”

“I think that it’s a possibility,” She replied, “He did spend a long time under his own quirk’s effect. We don’t know enough about the particulars of his quirk to rule it out.”

Izuku watched as they spoke. Aizawa-san sure did seem concerned about this whole thing. He didn’t realize he had stayed the same height, if he had to be honest. Going from kid to owl and then from owl to kid was already a change in heights, and it wasn’t as if he could remember how tall he used to be.

“I’ll leave a note on his file about this,” She tapped on her keyboard, “By the time we check again, we should hopefully know more about his quirk and possible side effects. And in the meantime, if he does grow in height, then it’ll be a non-issue.”

“There’s actually something I want to bring up before we continue,” Aizawa-san said as he took one of his hands, holding it in his own, “Izuku’s mentioned being cold for days now. Hizashi and I both thought it was just a readjustment to not having feathers anymore, but I’m a bit concerned that it might not be just that.”

“There was a small dip between the last recorded body temperature and the most recent, now that you mention it,” Izuku perked up; now this was something he was interested in listening to. “How odd.”

“Izuku-kun?” She turned to him after a few moments of skimming, “There’s a note in your files that says that above average temperature readings can be put aside. Do you happen to know what that refers to?”

He blinked at her.

Did he?

Was something like that ever mentioned to him?

Actually, there was something he remembered, if only vaguely.

“I think… it was because of Hisashi,” He paused at the name, a frown pulling at his lips, “His family had a lot of fire quirks, so their bodies always had a high temperature, and I got that.” The words tickled the edge of his memory. What had that doctor said again? Oh, right. “It’s a mutation, but not a quirk.”

“A mutation, you say,” Shuuzenji-san quickly typed onto her keyboard, rows of new words appearing on her screen, “If it was just a mutation, then it shouldn’t have been affected this way unless you’re currently sick.” She opened up a separate tab, looking as if she was searching for something specific, “I think this might be related to the height issue actually.”

Izuku could feel his eyebrows scrunch up. How could his height have anything to do with his temperature?

“Could you explain?” Aizawa-san sounded just as confused as he was, “You lost me at the whole temperature-height thing.”

“Of course,” She nodded, “If Izuku-kun is correct in that an above-average body temperature is normal for him, and that it’s a bodily mutation, then the only change that his body has experienced so far is from starving in his early street days. That can lead to a lower metabolism, which in turn can lead to lower body temperatures. It can also cause a slower growth rate.”

“I see,” Izuku could practically hear Aizawa-san frowning above him, “And what can we do to fix this?”

“Continue doing what you’ve been doing, for the most part,” Shuuzenji-san replied as she continued typing, “And go see a nutritionist. These sorts of issues aren’t ones that can get corrected in a week.”

“Hear that, Izuku?” Aizawa-san sounded relieved, “We’ll be able to get you warm again with some work.”

He nodded, also a bit relieved.

It wasn’t as if he minded being cold right now, really. But autumn followed summer, and then winter followed that. If he were an owl again by winter, it would be fine. He never had any issues with the cold as an owl even when there was snow falling down from the sky. But right now, he couldn’t even get his quirk to activate. Who knew how long it’d take to be able to use it again? And in a way that didn’t make Aizawa-san sad, or worse, disappointed!

“That brings me to the next thing I wanted to bring up,” Shuuzenji-san continued as she pulled up images on her computer, “The results of your bone density test came in just now. I had it expedited to a colleague of mine that owes me a favor.”

“And the results?”

“Izuku-kun’s bones are indeed denser than average human bones,” She scrolled slightly, “They’re also full of spaces, likely for storing more air.” Aizawa-san held up one of his hands, eyes studying it, even turning it a few times before letting go, “On the whole, they’re comparable to a bird’s bones.”

“Is this also a bodily mutation like the increased body temperature?”

‘It isn’t,” Shuuzenji-san shook her head, “This is a new development for his body. When comparing the new images with the ones we have on record, there is a clear difference.”

“Then it was his quirk that caused this,” Izuku could feel Aizawa-san’s grip tighten against him, “And what does this mean for him? For his health?”

He patted Aizawa-san’s arm, both to reassure him that he was here and okay, and also to tell him to not squeeze so tightly cause he had to breathe. Thankfully, it seemed that Aizawa-san knew without him actually having to say so, loosening his hold and mumbling an apology.

“For Izuku-kun, very little. He’ll have to be more careful, of course, having denser bones usually comes hand-in-hand with some minor enhanced strength,” Shuuzenji-san hummed, looking thoughtful, “But it shouldn’t affect his health in a negative way.”

Enhanced strength?

Did she mean like his owl strength?

He was very good at controlling his grip strength as an owl though, so this shouldn’t be that big of an issue.

“Seeing a nutritionist is more important than ever now, Aizawa,” She closed out of the images she had on the screen, “You don’t want him developing brittle bones due to low intake of calcium.”

Izuku had no idea what cal-ci-um was, but he was sure Aizawa-san knew, so he’d leave that up to him. However, this was the second time that Shuuzenji-san mentioned a nu-tri-tion-ist. It sounded like nutrition, which he knew was what you ate to make you healthy and grow. Something like that. So maybe it was someone who told you what to eat so you were healthy.

All he knew was that he really didn’t want to have brittle bones, whatever that was. He liked his bones just how they were. Not brittle, just normal.

He wasn’t too happy about having to see yet another person soon, but it was better than getting brittle bones probably.

“And that’s all I have for now,” Shuuzenji-san turned towards them, “Any follow-up questions?”

“Not at the moment,” Aizawa-san bowed his head, “I’ll contact you if I think of any. Thank you.”

“Thank you.” He repeated, also bowing his head, as Aizawa-san shifted him off his lap with an arm and onto his feet. Wobbling slightly, he grabbed at the hem of Aizawa-san’s shirt to steady himself.

“We’ll be heading back to the principal’s office now,” Aizawa-san lightly pulled his hand off his shirt, allowing him to hold his hand instead, “Thank you again.”

“It was no problem,” Shuuzenji-san waved them off as they headed out the door, “I’ll send you that list by the end of the day.”

They left, door closing behind them.

Izuku was glad that it was over. It didn’t go as badly as he thought it might, but he was still relieved that he was out of that room. Shuuzenji-san was alright for a doctor. And she had lots of candy. That was pretty cool too.

Aizawa-san let him swing their hands as they walked, though he looked slightly grouchy the entire time, eyes always narrowing at any student that looked at them for more than a second. No one stopped them, though one student did ask where they were heading. Hearing the reply of ‘the principal’s office’, the student paled and walked quickly away. Weird. Did they think Nedzu-san was scary or something?

It didn’t take them very long to reach the door of Nedzu-san’s office.

However, by then, Izuku was slightly regretting drinking the entire cup of tea.

He tugged at their held hands, telling Aizawa-san he had to go. Aizawa-san shrugged, starting to lead them back down another hallway. Thankfully it wasn’t a long walk to get there and within minutes, he was done. He stepped back out, eyes peering around for the familiar sight of Aizawa-san.

It wasn’t supposed to be so hard to find him in an empty hallway.

Turning around in a circle, he wondered where Aizawa-san might be.

He was sure that Aizawa-san wasn’t lost in the school; Aizawa-san did go to U.A. for high school, after all. But then where could he be?

Where was the Aizawa-san that he couldn’t see?

“Excuse me,” A voice interrupted his search, “Are you looking for something?”

“Someone,” He corrected almost immediately, paling when he realized that it wasn’t Aizawa-san that was talking to him, “I… No.”

“If you are, I could help,” The speaker spoke in a gentle tone, “I’m training to become a hero. Helping is what we do.”

Izuku wanted her to go away, but she had a point, and he hated that she did. Heroes did help people, and right now, Izuku was a people. And he needed help to find Aizawa-san. Probably.

“I’m looking for my…” He began, though he paused soon after. If he just said ‘Aizawa-san’, there was no way she’d be able to know who that was. And if she didn’t know who Aizawa-san was, then how could she help?

But maybe he could use a different word, one that was a better description. It was more logical that way, even though he didn’t know how true it was. (Even if he wanted it to be.)

He hoped Aizawa-san wouldn’t be angry if he heard him right now.

“I’m looking for my dad.”

    “I’m looking for my Aizawa-san” is honestly such a great sentence, even though he never voiced it out xD But Izuku has the right idea!

    The candies Izuku received from Recovery Girl did boost his opinion of her, to no one's surprise. Though the ensuing conversation afterwards was pretty boring in his opinion, but hey, can't win them all the time xD

    I will find a way to stick Hizashi into chapters even if he’s not physically there, yes.

    Thanks for reading! Please let me know your thoughts! :D

    Next chapter comes out October 2nd! 'Finding' Aizawa-san and meeting someone new!

Chapter Text

“I’m looking for my dad.”

Shouta paused midstep as he heard Izuku’s voice slightly echoing down the hallway, phone still in hand. He had stepped around the corner to answer a call from Tsukauchi, not wanting to broadcast the call to whoever might walk past. He had only planned to be away for a couple of minutes, but it seemed that Izuku had finished up quickly. He hoped that he remembered to wash his hands.

“He’s tall with black hair,” Izuku’s voice continued, a bit quiet, but with the echo, it didn’t matter, “And he has a long scarf.” There was a pause. “He’s really tall.”

“I see,” Another voice, an unfamiliar voice, spoke, “And where did you see him last?”

“Right here.”

His mind raced.

Izuku had called him ‘dad’, albeit not in his immediate presence. Hizashi was going to murder something for not being able to witness this in person. Yes, Izuku had referred to him as ‘father’ once before, but that had been with a flashcard. Even after that, when he was human again, he had always just called him ‘Aizawa-san.’

And that was alright.

Both he and Hizashi knew that Izuku thought of him as a father figure. And that was enough for him.

(It didn’t stop Hizashi from pouting about how they didn’t know what Izuku thought of him though. But he had seen the two of them interact, had seen Izuku’s small but bright smiles at Hizashi’s antics, had seen Hizashi softly hum to lull Izuku to sleep. He wouldn’t be surprised if Izuku thought of Hizashi the same way as well.)

This was the first time Izuku had ever voiced it out though, and to a stranger no less.

Shouta stepped closer, angling himself in a way that he could see around the corner of the hallway he was currently occupying. The reflection off the windows weren’t perfect for what he wanted, but it were adequate enough for him to recognize U.A.’s heroics department uniform.

“I didn’t see anyone with that description before I came to this hallway,” The student spoke again, “But I can try finding him for you.”

He could practically feel Izuku’s nerves even at this distance, the silence from him very telling. It was time he stepped in, now that he knew he didn’t have to ambush anyone trying to do anything untoward to Izuku.

Still, he took a second to take it in again.

‘Dad.’

‘My dad.’

That was him.

He was dad.

Right.

He was careful to make his steps heard as he approached, a few strides taking him around the corner, his phone finally returned to his pocket.

A couple of things happened as he rounded the corner.

Izuku perked up, relief visible in his eyes.

The student turned to step forward in front of Izuku.

Good instincts, Shouta took note of as he raised his eyebrows. Prioritizing civilian safety, but not escalating the situation in any way. He was no teacher, but this was the sort of behavior that he’d like to see being nurtured in more pros.

“Aizawa-san!”

And he was back to being called ‘Aizawa-san’.

But how could he feel any bit bad about that when Izuku looked so relieved to see him?

Shouta couldn’t.

“I had to take a call from our favorite hat-man,” No need to give more information than needed in front of strangers, “You ready to go?”

Izuku nodded, skirting around the student, though he did pause as he passed her.

“Thank you for offering to help.”

It was a small murmur, but Shouta could hear it, and from the small smile on the student’s face, she did as well. He gave her a silent nod as Izuku arrived to his side, taking the hand offered to him.

And with that, they made their way back to Nedzu’s office.

Izuku seemed happy enough, though there seemed to still be a trace of nervousness in his eyes.

“Are you alright?” He asked, “It’s been a lot today so far.”

“Dunno…” Izuku’s voice was low, “I think so?” It got even lower, “I just, I was a bit scared when you disappeared, Aizawa-san.”

“I didn’t mean to scare you like that,” He apologized, “I thought I’d be back before you’d notice.”

“You’d come back for me, right?” Izuku looked up at him, eyes big, “If we ever got separated again, you would come find me, right?”

“Kid,” Shouta murmured, trying to pour as much reassurance he could into his voice, “Always.” He gave Izuku’s hand a slight squeeze, “Both Hizashi and I, we would always come back for you. No matter what.”

Izuku leaned against him, even as they continued walking.

“Me too.”

It was a whisper so quiet that Shouta could barely hear it.

“Mm?”

“Me too,” Izuku repeated slightly louder, though this time, it was muffled by the fabric of his shirt, “I’d always come back to you too.”

“Thanks, kid.”

If his voice was just a touch rough, Izuku didn’t mention it.

Before long, they were once again facing Nedzu’s door. This time, it opened without him attempting to knock on it. Izuku squinted in the direction of the hinges, but followed when he walked into the room.

“I see you’re back from your visit with Recovery Girl!” Nedzu greeted, a cup of tea already in hand, “I do hope that it was of help.”

“It was, thank you.” There was no doubt that if Nedzu truly wanted, he could have all of Recovery Girl’s records on his screen in seconds; patient confidentiality meant nothing to him. But he knew that the rat wanted to keep Recovery Girl as a member of the school faculty, so he was forced to abide by the laws for once, since no one survived an angry healer.

“Shu-u-zen-ji-san said that I have bird bones,” Izuku, however, didn’t know this, and for some reason, still really liked Nedzu, “She said we have to go see someone to make sure I don’t get brittle bones.”

“Then I’d respectfully agree with her,” Nedzu nodded, “Having your bones break easily on you is definitely something you want to avoid.”

Izuku looked horrified as he glanced down at his arm and then up at him.

“I don’t want broken bones, Aizawa-san.”

“Once I get that list from Shuuzenji-sensei, I’ll contact a nutritionist as soon as I can, alright?” After some research to make sure they were up to snuff, at least. Not that he didn’t trust Recovery Girl’s choices, but it always paid to be careful with things like this, “Your bones are fine right now, so try not to worry too much.”

“The student that I’ve invited to speak with you should be arriving soon,” Nedzu turned to pick up a small rectangular box that had been previously hidden behind his desk, “Would you like a small snack in the meantime?”

He opened the box, tilting it to show them the contents. There was a small assortment of mini macarons in there, each a different color and presumably flavor as well.

“They look like small cookies,” Izuku hummed, clearly interested, “But Aizawa-san packed snacks already…”

“You can have one macaron,” He conceded as he took the jelly pouches out of his bag, “Choose wisely.”

“What flavors do you have, Nedzu-san?” Izuku’s eyes flitted in his direction as he twisted one of the lids off, though they quickly returned to the clear prize, “Are they all different flavors?”

“They are indeed all different flavors,” Nedzu nodded, placing the box down on the desk and sliding it closer to them, “Feel free to have the first pick.”

Shouta watched as Nedzu quickly identified each of the macarons to Izuku. Matcha, yuzu, vanilla, chocolate, coconut, and salted caramel. It was a good selection of flavors, he’d give him that. Honestly, he was surprised that Nedzu even knew what a kid might like. Then again, most kids did enjoy sugary treats. It was decidedly better than that one time back in high school where Nedzu had offered him a small block of cheese as a snacking item.

“I’m gonna get the vanilla one,” He leaned forward, plucking out the one he specified, “Your turn, Aizawa-san.”

“Mm.” He picked out the matcha macaron, immediately popping the entire thing into his mouth, “It’s good. Thanks for the sweets.”

“Yeah,” Izuku nibbled on the edge of his, “Thank you, Nedzu-san.”

“I’m glad you’re enjoying them!” Nedzu looked delighted, “Please feel free to take the rest of the box home with you.”

“You’re not having one?” Izuku had already shoved the rest of his into his mouth, only the crumbs left on his lips evidence that he had even eaten something, “But they’re tasty. You should have one too.”

“Yeah, sensei,” He drawled, amusement lacing the tone of his voice, “You should have one too.”

There was an interesting expression on Nedzu’s face; he’d describe it as ‘bewilderment’ if he had to choose one word to place it as. Was it really so odd that Izuku insisted on everyone having one?

“You really are a kind child, aren’t you, Izuku-kun?”

Ah.

That made more sense then.

It was an open secret here at U.A. that Nedzu had once been mistreated by humans. Abused, really. Nedzu had to fight to have what he had even now, likely rarely being shown compassion from those who thought him beneath themselves.

And then came Izuku.

Izuku, the kid that enjoyed Nedzu’s company, even drew him a picture, and treated him like an equal without prompt the entire time.

“He’s a good kid,” Shouta hummed as he patted the crumbs off of Izuku’s mouth, “Hizashi thinks he’s better than croissants.”

“Yamada-san loves croissants though!” Izuku gasped, “He told me that he thinks they’re the best thing ever!” He paused, “Except for you. And bug spray.”

“High praise,” He chuckled, “But believe me, Hizashi likes many things better than croissants, and you’re definitely one of them.”

Izuku squeaked, bumping the side of his head against him. He chuckled at the reaction, offering him the opened jelly pouch. As soon as it was taken and he was sure it wouldn’t drop, he opened the second one, immediately taking a long slurp.

“You seem to be adjusting quite well to fatherhood, Aizawa-kun,” Nedzu spoke with a cheerful tone, the salted caramel macaron now held in his paws, “Do you have any current plans on furthering Izuku-kun’s education yet?”

Shouta wished he could reply. Really, he did. But he couldn't because he had slammed a hand over his mouth at the word ‘fatherhood’ in order to not spray grape flavored jelly all over the rat.

It took a few embarrassing seconds for him to swallow what was in his mouth, the silence only punctuated by the happy slurping sounds from Izuku.

“I... No,” He managed to get out, “Hizashi and I were planning to do some more research into it first before making any decisions as to what we wanted to do about that. Izuku’s still adjusting right now so we don’t want to rush into anything.”

“I see,” Nedzu hummed, his macaron now half-finished, the remainder now laying on a small china plate that definitely hadn’t been there before when he looked, “Well, I am pleased to tell you that I would be more than happy to offer my ser—”

Knock knock

“Ah!” Nedzu cut himself off at the sound of the door knocking, “That must be the student!” He slid one of his paws off and then under his desk, the door silently opening in response, “Come in, come in!”

Even Izuku looked up from his jelly pouch to see who entered.

“Principal Nedzu,” She greeted once she had reached Nedzu’s desk, politely inclining her head, “And guests.”

“Aizawa-kun, Izuku-kun,” Nedzu gestured with a paw to the student, “Might I introduce you two to Tatsuma Ryuko-kun, one of our third year heroics students?”

It was her!

It was the student that offered to help him find Aizawa-san earlier!

Izuku was glad, really glad. This meant that he already knew that the student, Ta-tsu-ma-san, was nice. And she was a heroics student. That was pretty cool. He wondered what her quirk was; she was the transformation quirk student that Nedzu-san mentioned after all.

Were there any clues?

She did have sharp teeth, so maybe she could transform into something with big sharp teeth? Or maybe she could change into sharp teeth? Was that possible with a quirk? That would be pretty cool to see on the television, he had to admit. But how would that work? Teeth didn’t have noses so how would she be able to breathe?

“I’m Tatsuma Ryuko,” She nodded at them, “It’s a pleasure to officially meet you two.”

“Aizawa Shouta,” Aizawa-san nodded back, “And this is Izuku.”

He gave her a small wave, mind still whirring on the possibilities of what she could transform into. Lots of things had sharp teeth. Not owls though. Owls had no teeth at all. Not that owls needed teeth for anything.

“Do you mind explaining your quirk to them, Tatsuma-kun?” Nedzu-san asked, “I’m afraid a practical display isn’t going to be feasible at the moment.”

“Why not?”

He wondered out loud.

Nedzu-san’s office was pretty big. He could probably fit his entire room in it and more.

“I wouldn’t be able to fit in the room with my quirk activated,” Tatsuma-san answered instead, “My quirk is called Dragon. It allows me to transform into a large dragon.”

A dragon?

Like Hisashi’s Dragon’s Breath’s kind of dragon?

He could feel his heart skip a beat as his eyes darted up to hers, half expecting to see a familiar bright orange instead of the mellow gold that met his gaze.

“Can… Can you…” His voice trailed off multiple times as he tried to speak, giving out every single time; he took in another breath to try again, his words stilted and uneven, but at least they came out this time, “Breathe. Fire?”

“Oh, no,” Tatsuma-san replied, “I can’t breathe fire.” She then softened her voice, “But, are you alright?”

Izuku blinked at her, hand clutching at Aizawa-san’s sleeve, empty jelly pouch left forgotten on Nedzu-san’s desk.

“Are you, kid?” This time Aizawa-san asked him, “Do you need to stop for a break?”

Was he alright?

Was he?

Izuku wasn’t too sure.

All he knew was that sudden reminders of Hisashi didn’t make him feel too well. But now he knew that Tatsuma-san didn’t breathe fire. Couldn’t be like Hisashi even if she could turn into a dragon.

He could feel his shoulders slump down, heartbeat finally slowing so he didn’t constantly hear it in his head. His fingers loosened their grip on the sleeve they were grasping.

“‘m okay,” Aizawa-san’s eyes were worried still, so he pressed forward, “I don’t need a break, Aizawa-san.”

Though Aizawa-san didn’t look like he believed him, he nodded. They were probably going to have a talk about this later; that was what that look in his eyes meant. And it wasn’t as if talks were bad, not with Aizawa-san and Yamada-san at least. But they usually ended up making him want to cry, not because they were mean or anything, but because they were nice and understanding.

(They were nothing like the adults at daycare who always told him that he was just being too sensitive and needed to grow a thicker skin because no one else was complaining like he was.)

“How do you use your quirk, Ta-tsu-ma-san?” He asked before Aizawa-san could change his mind and take his nod back, “Did it take you a long time to learn?”

“It takes focus, a lot of it,” She had a small frown on her face, sharp teeth visible when she spoke, “It took me a while to be able to call upon it reliably, but it got easier the more I practiced. Practice is essential for a smooth transformation.”

“Smooth transformation?”

Did that mean there were rough transformations too?

“A smooth transformation would be one where you seamlessly switch from your base form to whatever you can transform into,” Tatsuma-san clarified, “For me, going from how I am now to a dragon only takes me seconds.” She chuckled, “It used to take more, and transformations were a lot rougher back when I was a kid like you, but if you work hard and keep at it, I’m sure that you’ll gain control over your quirk.”

She sounded so confident speaking that Izuku could almost feel himself believing her words. Was this how someone learning to be a hero spoke? Was this what they taught at U.A.?

“What kind of focus do you mean?” He couldn’t help but wonder. Because he was sure he focused pretty hard when he tried activating his quirk and still nothing had happened that he noticed, “Like what you’re thinking really hard about when you’re using your quirk?”

“Precisely, yes,” She confirmed with a small nod, “For me, I think of being so big that I can protect anyone within my reach. For my fingers to turn into claws that I can use for defending the innocent. For my wings to be broad so I will be able to shield others with them.”

“That’s a lot to think about,” Izuku wasn’t quite sure he could think that many things at once, “How do you think about so many things at once without forgetting anything?”

“After practicing for so long, reaching for those sorts of emotions become second nature,” Tatsuma-san gave him a small smile, “You’ll eventually only need to bring up the memory of transforming to activate your quirk.”

He thought about it.

It did make sense, he guessed. Thinking of so many things at once to activate a quirk when you needed to use it quickly wasn’t logical at all. It would take so long to get it to activate and by then the villain could have run away or hurt more people.

And it even further supported what Aizawa-san had said about not using hunger or just flat out hoping things would suddenly catch on fire near him to activate his quirk.

There was only one more thing he wanted to know now.

“How do you turn back?”

Because if it wasn’t logical to depend on something traumatic to activate his quirk, then it probably wasn’t logical to expect Aizawa-san with his quirk there every time he had to be human again. That meant he had to not only figure out how to go from human to owl, but owl to human as well.

How else would he have Aizawa-san’s cooking?

Owls didn’t cook their meals and while the rats he could catch were great, Aizawa-san’s cooking was different. It was a different kind of warm and filling. And it was made with love. He had asked Yamada-san who had confirmed it for him. That meant Aizawa-san wanted to see him grow up healthy and strong, just like his Mama did.

Plus, he'd also miss Aizawa-san and Yamada-san's hugs. They both gave really great hugs.

“The same way as I transform into a dragon,” And somehow, Izuku wasn’t too surprised at that answer, “I focus on becoming small again. I think about being able to fit through doors. I focus on individual body parts like fingers and toes.”

Fingers and toes!

That was a good idea.

Owls didn’t have fingers like humans did. And owls only had four toes on each foot, not five like human him did. So if he really thought about them hard, like really hard, he might be able to turn back into a human whenever he wanted! This had to be after he figured out how to turn into an owl though. He couldn’t learn how to turn back into a human unless he was already not a human.

He nodded to himself.

Fingers and toes.

He would definitely remember that.

“Thank you,” Izuku gave her a small smile, hoping that it came out looking like a smile at least, “For answering all my questions.”

“It was no problem at all,” She gave him a smile in return, “If I was able to be of any help to you, then I’m glad.”

“I don’t know if you helped me yet ‘cause I can’t figure out how to use my quirk,” He could hear Aizawa-san cough into his scarf, “But I’ll ask Nedzu-san to tell you when I do figure it out.”

She looked surprised at his words, but then laughed.

“I’ll be waiting to hear from you then.”

“Okay.”

And that was that.

Tatsuma-san nodded to them and then bowed to Nedzu-san, leaving the room quietly.

It was finally over.

Izuku honestly felt exhausted, leaning his head against Aizawa-san’s arm, fingers still tangled into his sleeve.

“Tired, Izuku?” Aizawa-san asked him, “We can go home soon. Hizashi’s probably already on his way to pick us up.”

‘Yes.’

He was honestly too tired to even try to speak words.

“Ah, then I won’t keep you two then,” Nedzu-san spoke softly, “Do remember to take the rest of the macarons with you, yes?”

“Thanks again, sensei,” He could hear Aizawa-san pick up the box, close it, and then place it into his bag, “I appreciate you making time in your schedule for us.”

“Anything for a former student!” Was what was chirped back, “Please contact me again if you need anything else in the future!”

“Can you somehow expedite our approval as adoptive parents then, sensei?” Aizawa-san groaned, though there was alarm in his voice when he next spoke, interrupting Nedzu-san’s sudden chuckles, “Uh, that was a joke. I think that might be illegal.”

“Not to worry, Aizawa-kun,” Nedzu-san’s chuckles didn’t stop, “For Izuku-kun, I’m finding that I am rather tempted to dip my paws into less-than-legal activities, so to say.”

“Please don’t get arrested.”

A small whine left his mouth as he butted Aizawa-san’s arm for talking so much. What he was talking about, he wasn’t sure. He was much more interested in getting in a nap than paying attention to conversations.

Strong arms lifted him up, holding him close and propping his head against a soft material. Aizawa-san’s capture scarf made a nice pillow, he thought as he nuzzled it.

“But, if you can get it done by Hizashi’s birthday,” He could hear Aizawa-san speak, even as closed his eyes, relaxing in his hold, trusting that Aizawa-san wouldn’t drop him, “I’ll rethink your offered services.”

“And that is a deal made.” Nedzu-san continued speaking; he really did like to speak, didn’t he? “Have a safe trip home, Aizawa-kun, Izuku-kun.”

“Mhm,” Izuku felt Aizawa-san’s grunt more than he heard it, “And thanks for the tea. Izuku liked it.”

Maybe just a few more words?

For Nedzu-san.

“See you next time,” He murmured, “Nedzu-san.”

“I look forward to it, Izuku-kun.”

Those were the last words he heard. Aizawa-san left the principal’s office right after, his steps echoing in the silent hallways. He dozed off, the thumping of Aizawa-san’s heart a lullaby to him.

The next thing he knew, he was being placed down somewhere else. He could hear Yamada-san’s voice nearby.

“The kid’s all tuckered out, huh?”

“Yeah, he’s exhausted,” Came Aizawa-san’s low voice, “I’m not surprised.”

“Productive afternoon?”

“I think so.”

Izuku relaxed even further at the quiet voices of both Aizawa-san and Yamada-san, steadily breathing in and out.

“Any requests?”

“Classical, low volume. Avoid potholes.”

“Gotcha.”

Izuku fell asleep, dreams filled with owls avoiding potholes filled with candies and macarons.

What an odd dream.


Notes:

    Hizashi > Anything fun happen on your trip?
    Shouta > *quickly checking if Izuku is asleep*
    Izuku > *having a nice nap with weird dreams*
    Shouta > He called me dad.
    Hizashi >
    Hizashi > (இ﹏இ`｡)

    Izuku assumed that Shouta didn’t hear him call him ‘dad’ so he doesn’t make any mention of it xD But Shouta knows (and Hizashi too), and that’s the important thing :D

    The macarons that were gifted to them were shared as well! Izuku (coconut), Shouta (chocolate), and Hizashi (yuzu - a type of citrus fruit). Also Hizashi was very touched when semi-drowsy Izuku dug out the lemon candy from Shouta’s bag to give it to him ;v;

    Izuku did learn a bit more about transformation quirks though! And got to meet someone new! And discover some hidden trauma! How exciting c:

Chapter Text

The large calendar on their wall was something Izuku saw every day.

It hung in the living room, right next to where the kitchen island was.

Because of that, it was impossible to not notice when something was added to it. So when there were suddenly two new red circles around days that hadn’t been there last night, he had immediately gotten curious. Was there something happening soon?

Aizawa-san and Yamada-san liked to note down what would be happening on the calendar, but he still wasn’t too good at reading. He could recognize his own name written there though, so it had to have something to do with him.

The problem was that recently, so many things on the calendar had something to do with him. The entire last week had been so busy! They had gone to prove that he was actually alive to government people, gotten his quirk registered, and even visited a nutritionist!

Aizawa-san had told him that after those were dealt with, it wouldn't be as busy. And he did like the sound of that; going out day after day and having lots of people talk to him was tiring.

It was all stuff that needed to be done though. Because if everyone still thought he was dead, he would never be able to go to actual daycare or school ever again probably. And if he didn't register his quirk, Aizawa-san said that they would make him pay a fine if they found out. That meant they would make him pay real money for not telling them! And he needed to see the nutritionist if he wanted to keep his bones healthy and strong. Plus, he’d like his warmth back soon too, so that was another good reason.

That was all he remembered Aizawa-san mentioning to him and they had done them all already, so what could be the new thing on the calendar?

He could ask someone. Both Aizawa-san and Yamada-san were actually home right now, which was a rare thing since it wasn’t breakfast time. Aizawa-san was in the kitchen making dinner though; he had told him that tonight, they were going to have beef stew. Yamada-san had even gone out earlier this afternoon to buy some potatoes to go along with the onions and carrots they already had at home. Izuku was really excited to try Aizawa-san’s beef stew. He was sure it would be delicious.

That meant Aizawa-san was busy though and he didn’t want to distract him while he was using the stove. What if he accidentally hurt himself?

(After all, he had asked Yamada-san a question when he was in the kitchen peeling the skins off of the grapes they had and he had somehow squished it with his fingers so hard that it turned into mush! Just what was so surprising about pregnancy that it caused something like that to happen? He had gotten even more curious seeing that, but thankfully, Yamada-san had explained it to him. It was basically where babies came from, but less like laying eggs and more along the lines of… laying babies.)

Yamada-san was sitting at the kitchen table, his papers covering almost the entire surface. Izuku was pretty sure it was all for his radio station job too, somehow. Aizawa-san already had so much paperwork for his hero job, but Yamada-san had two jobs, so that meant double the paperwork at least! It made him a bit hesitant to bother Yamada-san when he was working, but Yamada-san alway encouraged him to ask questions and this was definitely something he wanted to know about. He was a bit tired, but he could put off his nap for some answers.

Izuku placed his pencil down, making sure it wouldn’t roll off the table before standing up and walking over to the kitchen table, the sound of Aizawa-san chopping things getting a bit louder.

“Yamada-san?”

“Hm?” Yamada-san looked up from his work, his pen still in his hand, “Yeah, ‘Zuku?”

“Is there something happening soon?” At Yamada-san’s confused look, he elaborated, “On the calendar, I saw there were new circles that weren’t there yesterday.”

“Oh! Yes!” Yamada-san exclaimed brightly, his previous confusion replaced with excitement, “With how busy everything’s been for all of us recently, I honestly nearly forgot to even mention it to you.” He grinned, “My birthday is coming up!”

Yamada-san’s birthday?

That was a pretty big thing, wasn’t it?

His memories of things before his quirk activated weren’t always clear, but he did remember special days.

He knew his fourth birthday had been nice. Hisashi hadn’t been home and Kacchan had come over when he had invited him too! He remembered being happy that day, being assured by everyone that his quirk would manifest any time now.

His fifth birthday wasn’t one he remembered too well. Hisashi hadn’t been home that time as well though, and he remembered his Mama being sad about that.

But his sixth birthday… He remembered that one very well. Hisashi had been home for that birthday and his Mama had been so happy that they’d get a chance to celebrate his birthday together, as a family. Izuku really would have preferred him to not be home again, but his Mama always looked so happy with him around, so he hadn’t said anything.

She had asked Hisashi to light up the candles on the cake with his quirk, joking that she had the fire extinguisher at the ready if he missed. The next thing he knew, his cake had caught on fire and a moment later, it had been turned into a big blobby mess that they had to throw away. They couldn’t save any part of it. Later that night, his Mama had told him that it had been an accident, a quirk misfire, and that he wouldn’t understand. She had looked upset after saying that, but then promised him that they would go shopping the next day for something nice instead since he didn’t get to have his cake this year.

Izuku really hoped that Yamada-san’s birthday wouldn’t turn out like one of his. He wanted Yamada-san to have the best birthday possible! Because such a nice person like Yamada-san only deserved the best.

“What are you gonna do on your birthday?” He asked, now extremely curious, “Are you gonna have cake?”

“Well, Shouta and I are still deciding on what to do this year,” Yamada-san hummed, tapping his chin with the pen in his hand, “Usually, we just go out with some friends or something. Have a good time, ya know?”

They had friends?

That was the first he'd heard of it. Aizawa-san and Yamada-san had never mentioned their friends to him before. He hadn’t even realized that they might have them.

“If you usually do that, then why aren’t you doing it this year too?”

“Things are different this year,” Aizawa-san suddenly said, even as he continued to sizzle something in the pan, “Coming home drunk isn’t a logical thing to do when you have a child.”

Aizawa-san did make a good point. Izuku had seen drunks of all kinds in his nights outside when he had been Eraserhead-watching. The ones that were causing trouble always got arrested and taken away by the police, but the ones that didn’t… Well, they tended to be somewhat wobbly and he had seen some walk into telephone poles before. A bit funny to watch, but Izuku always ended up feeling a little bit bad when they ended up getting funny red marks on their forehead from all the bumping they did.

“Cake does sound like a good idea,” Yamada-san murmured, now chewing on the end of his pen cap, “Not sure how your nutritionist is gonna feel about you having cake multiple times in a two week period though.”

Multiple times?

Just how much cake did Yamada-san want for his birthday?

"It's your birthday soon too, you know, Izuku," He propped his chin up with his hand, a teasing smile on his face, "Did you forget?"

Izuku blinked.

The calendar did say it was currently July. And his birthday was on the fifteenth of that same month.

"I forgot." He confirmed with a nod, still somewhat in disbelief that he actually did forget his birthday.

Well, maybe it shouldn't have been too surprising. He had never needed to keep track of the days and months as an owl, so he hadn't even tried. Honestly, he wasn't even sure how long he lived outside by himself, just that it was a pretty long time. It all kind of blended together after a while. Sleeping, waking up, hiding, finding food, and then repeating that day after day… It had been a simpler life he lived, but much more lonely. He had only been doing what his Mama had asked him to do, but he thought, if he had to do it again now, to go back into hiding once again, there was no way he would be able to.

"Oh, 'Zuku…" Yamada-san’s eyebrows were scrunched up now, previous smile gone, “Well, do you have anything you wanna do for your birthday this year?”

He thought about it for a moment before shaking his head.

“Not really.”

Living with Aizawa-san and Yamada-san like this already, it was good. It was already more than he initially expected.

How could he ask more of them?

Hizashi wasn’t sure his heart could take all of this.

Forgetting his own birthday, it was a bit sad, but it was understandable. They had all been so busy recently, he doubted Izuku had really thought that much ahead. And he had spent his last birthday as an owl, doing as an owl does on their birthday, which was probably whatever he wanted, if he had even realized what the date was.

But the sheer nonchalance with which he spoke about it, it just made him wonder if Midoriya Hisashi had somehow poisoned even a child’s innocent joy of celebrating their birthday. It was either that or Izuku still didn’t feel confident enough to ask things of them. He did ask them questions or for simple things like water, but anything even slightly more elaborate than that? Never left his mouth.

He wanted to pick Izuku up, squeeze his cheeks, and politely demand he choose a fun activity they could all do, or choose the menu for his special day! Just something! But at the same time, he knew he couldn’t do something like that. His relationship with Izuku likely hadn’t proceeded to a point where him doing that would go over well. It wasn’t like how Izuku was with Shouta.

Not that he could fault Izuku for anything regarding this.

Hizashi knew that building up a relationship took time. And the one he was currently trying to foster was a difficult one, especially for a child that had been previously burned by a paternal figure. All he could do was continue trying his best to be there for the kid he saw as his and Shouta’s son. For the child that possibly would only ever see Shouta as a father.

“Do you remember how old you’re turning?” Shouta spoke as he poured beef broth into his pot, “At least one of you is getting cake and we’ll need candles that aren’t hero-grade.”

Izuku looked perplexed, mouth opening multiple times before he paused to think before hesitantly replying.

“Se...ven?”

Hizashi wasn’t able to stop his chin from slipping out of his hand, though Izuku had noticed his action and immediately changed his answer, even speaking in a louder voice, as if it might cover up what he previously said.

“Eight?”

Was he guessing?

“Nine!”

He spoke so confidently too, though he kept flitting his eyes over at him.

“Eight,” Hizashi couldn’t take any more guesses, confirming with a weak grin, “You’re turning eight this year, ‘Zuku.”

Izuku looked surprised, and then thoughtful.

“I lost one.”

“Huh?”

“The last one I remember having is my sixth birthday.”

Had Izuku not realized how much time had passed while he was out there?

But now that Hizashi really thought about it, it was unlikely he would have. Unless he counted the days individually or checked a newspaper for the current date every so often, there was no way for him to know. And considering this was Izuku, Izuku who had seen no issue with spending the rest of his life as an owl just a mere month ago, he had likely gone out of his way to avoid things that would remind him of being human. Like birthdays or the entire concept of the passing of time.

“Spent longer than you thought you did out there, huh?” Hizashi murmured, this time unable to stop himself from reaching out to give Izuku a head pat, “I’m sorry we couldn’t find you sooner.”

He knew that Izuku had been extremely self-sufficient as an owl, but that owl that lived out there for so long was still a child. It never failed to make his heart ache to remember that the time Izuku had spent on his own was more than the time he had spent getting to know them. But he was so grateful that despite that, despite Izuku knowing the freedom a bird had in the big open sky, he had still agreed to stay with them, to live with them in their apartment.

(Izuku not being able to use his quirk at the time being was a moot point. Shouta had told him, just a bit over a week and a half ago, that Izuku had asked him if he could try to starve, just to force-activate his quirk. He had felt sick to his stomach hearing that, his original worries about Izuku’s food intake only getting exacerbated. But the knowledge that Izuku respected them enough to not attempt it on his own, regardless of what they said, was enough for him.)

“Don’t be sad.”

Hands squished his cheeks, knocking his glasses askew in the same movement. Izuku had gotten closer when he was lost in thought, now peering up at him.

“Eh?”

“Don’t,” Izuku repeated, a bit more insistently, “Don’t be sad.” His voice softened, even as he reached to shift the crooked glasses back into place, inadvertently leaving a smudge on the lens, but Hizashi wasn’t one to complain when Izuku was clearly trying his best, “It isn’t your fault.”

“I’m not sad, ‘Zuku,” And he wasn’t! Sadness wouldn’t cause this raw feeling in his stomach, wouldn’t make him want to scream his frustration out a window, and definitely wouldn’t urge him to search a certain Midoriya Hisashi out and punch him in the face. This wasn’t something he wanted to tell Izuku though. In his opinion, the less reminders, the better, “Well, maybe just a bit.” He admitted, his cheeks still squished together, lips puffing out like a fish, “A teensy bit. But it’s nothing to worry about, alright?”

“Can I help?” Izuku finally let go of his face as he asked, eyes watching his face and just what he was looking for, Hizashi wasn’t sure, but he looked dissatisfied after a few seconds with no response; he held his arms open instead, “Do you… Do you want a hug?”

Hizashi could feel himself soften hearing that.

“I’d love one.”

And with those words leaving his lips, Izuku leaned into his side, arms stretching around his part of his torso and his arm. It was a bit tighter than he expected, those arms holding a deceiving strength. It wasn’t enough to actually hurt him, but that enhanced strength that came with those bird bones was no joke.

“... Not long enough.”

He could hear Izuku softly mumble against his side, arms dipping to hug more of his torso as Hizashi shifted his own arm up so he could better accommodate a hug. He guided him in closer with a hand. Because if he was getting a hug, he wanted all of the hug.

“Aizawa-san?” Izuku lifted his head up from where it was, “Could you come here for a minute?”

“Hm?” The chopping sounds stopped; Hizashi could hear the knife being put down and then Shouta’s stepfalls, “Sure. What is it?”

“I need you to help me hug Yamada-san,” Izuku plopped his head back down, resting it right over where his heart was, “‘Cause your arms are longer than mine.” His eyelids slid closed, “You need to help me hug away all the sad. It’s logical.”

Hizashi could practically hear Shouta’s puzzlement at the request. He peered up and squinted, greeted by a semi-blurry Shouta standing next to him.

“If you hug this side and I hug the other side…” Shouta hugged him, his head bowing down slightly so that his chin gently knocked against the top of his head, mussing up his bun, “Then it’s a hug that never ends. Infinity hug.”

That was so cheesy and definitely the weirdest thing he’d heard all day. But even so, Hizashi could feel himself relaxing into their simultaneous hugs. He felt warm and cared for between the two of them. Breathing in, he allowed himself to further melt into their arms.

Things were alright.

Shouta was here.

Izuku was here.

It was what he could do now that mattered.

"Hey, 'Zuku?" He mumbled as he laid his cheek against soft green curls, "How do you feel about meeting our friends?"

Hizashi knew that both Nemuri and Tensei had some sort of idea on what was likely going on. It really was hard keeping secrets when you were friends with other capable pros. Tensei wasn’t as pushy as Nemuri tended to be, but even he had been asking them what was up in their group chat. The longer they pushed off the inevitable meeting though, the harder it would be to continue to cover up Izuku’s existence.

It would be better to get them introduced sooner than later, hopefully before Izuku’s birthday, and his as well. And if all went well, Izuku might even gain a playmate in Tenya! Because as much as he loved spending his free time with Izuku, the kid needed more social interaction than just from adults.

(Plus, it would be nice to swap tips with Tensei or something, and he’d finally get to show off his collection of Izuku photos!)

“Are they nice people?”

That Izuku didn’t outright refuse gave him hope.

“They’re nice people,” Hizashi confirmed, “Good people as well.”

“Are they pro heroes like you and Aizawa-san?”

“Well, that’s something you should ask them,” He knew that Tensei was rather lax in terms of his hero identity, his quirk already marking him being from a recognizable legacy family, one that had been involved with heroics for generations. But Nemuri enjoyed keeping her hero and civilian life separate. Either way, he’d prefer that Izuku meet them as civilians first and form his opinion of them that way before any secret identities were possibly revealed, “One even has a kid brother that’s your age.”

Hizashi could feel the hug on Izuku’s side get minutely tighter.

Was it something he said?

“We’ll be here the entire time, so you don’t need to worry about anything, alright?” Shouta cut in with a soothing tone, “It’s okay to be nervous about meeting them.”

“But what if I don’t like them?” Izuku’s fingers clutched at his shirt, bunching up the fabric, “Even if they’re your friends...” His voice got lower as he spoke, trembling, “What if… What if they don’t like me?”

Something hurt in his chest hearing this, but he knew he couldn’t be throwing shade around on the people that used to be in Izuku’s life that had likely caused his confidence issues; it would likely only further upset him and that was the last thing he wanted.

Calm.

He had to be calm.

“Izuku,” He called his name out gently, “Izuku, listen to me.” Dropping the hand that he had left draped over Izuku’s shoulders, he started to lightly rub up and down his back instead, “Even if they’re our friends, what they think of you ultimately doesn’t matter, it won’t change what we think of you. Not one bit.”

Hizashi knew he was fully prepared to kick their collective asses if they voiced anything of that sort about Izuku. And he knew Shouta would be right next to him. Though, he did have a hard time believing that either of them would be tactless enough to express that in front of him or Shouta. And he had an even harder time believing that Izuku wouldn’t capture both their hearts just by being himself around them.

“And if you don’t like them, then that’s fine as well,” He continued, knowing it was entirely possible for that to happen; Tsukauchi, the poor man, still got regularly referred to as the hat-man whenever he got brought up, “You’re not required to like them.” A small smile made its way onto his face, “We’d love you regardless.”

“... You promise?”

“I promise.”

“Okay,” A shaking Izuku hiccuped into his shirt, “Then I wanna try meeting your friends.”

“Alright, then I’ll let them know,” He would need to make sure they didn’t plan a surprise visit either; Izuku wouldn’t take kindly to a surprise in what he deemed to be his territory, “I’ll tell them they have to let us know before they come over too, okay?”

Hizashi could feel Izuku tap his answer.

‘Yes.’

Tired already, huh?

While he and Shouta were still trying to work on Izuku’s sleep schedule, it still wasn’t going too well. They definitely needed some sort of way to tire him out enough so that he’d sleep soundly at night and cut down on the naps during the day. Not that he could really begrudge Izuku his naps. He was very much a person that rose with the sun, but Izuku always did look so cozy under his blanket as he napped, even the occasional quiet u-hoo leaving his mouth when he dreamed.

“Do you want to catch a nap before dinner?”

Izuku nodded, even as he burrowed his head more against him.

“Your room or the living room?”

A shrug.

“Living room,” Shouta murmured, finally dropping out of the hug that Izuku had so thoughtfully coined a new name for, “The stew is still going to need to simmer for an hour or so before I can add the other ingredients. I can text Tensei and Nemuri about Izuku while I wait and catch up on emails.”

“Sure thing,” Hizashi easily scooped Izuku up, even as he clung to his shirt, “You ask Izuku about what he wants his cover story to be yet?”

“He says just to avoid mentioning the Midoriyas,” Shouta walked back into the kitchen area, “And that he doesn’t mind letting other people know that he was an owl. And ate rats.” Hizashi could hear him washing something, the sound of running water easily recognizable, “It’s not a viable cover story though.”

Shouta was right. For Tensei and Nemuri, both who were pro heroes, they likely wouldn’t blink an eye, but for other civilians, ones who had no connections to the gritty world of heroics, it would only bring attention, and that wasn’t something they wanted. And the majority of the people Izuku would encounter would most likely be civilians, so that was definitely a no-go.

“I mean, we are currently fostering him,” Hizashi made his way to the living, setting Izuku down onto the couch, handing him one of the pillows that they usually kept there, “We can just say that. No need to get too specific.”

He watched as Izuku latched onto the pillow, giving him a pat on the head before pulling down the blanket they now kept hanging over the back of the couch. As he draped it over Izuku, he wondered what Izuku’s feelings on adoption were.

Would he want this as much as he and Shouta did?

Or was this still happening too quickly?

Izuku wasn’t exactly fond of changes, but the only thing that would change between fostering and adopting was like his family name. And he didn’t even like to use the one he currently was still registered under, so it was a win-win situation, as far as he was concerned.

“I’m going to get back to my work now, okay?” He gave Izuku another head pat as he straightened up, “Shou’s gonna be right over once he finishes washing his stuff.”

‘Yes.’

Izuku sluggishly replied, head resting on the pillow in his lap.

Adorable.

Hizashi walked back to the kitchen table. As he sat back down, pen in hand, he realized that they had never decided on the whole cake thing.

He idly wondered as he signed off on a new piece of equipment, ready to get back to work after cleaning the smudge off the lens of his glasses.

Just what was Izuku’s favorite sort of cake?

Chapter Text

Izuku sat on the couch with a book.

Aizawa-san sat with him, silently tapping away on his laptop.

He had been curious earlier and asked him what he was working on, but all he was told was that it was work-related and classified. Classified meant that Aizawa-san wasn’t allowed to tell him, so he left it at that, returning to his book.

(It was important that classified things stayed classified too, because a lot of his own situation was apparently classified as well. According to Aizawa-san at least. And he had been told by the hat-man, so it was most likely true.)

The book he was looking through was one that Yamada-san had bought him. It was a picture book, and while he could pick out words every so often, it wasn’t enough to read out the full sentences. Usually, he would ask Aizawa-san or Yamada-san to help him with the words he didn’t know, or just read it to him, but he knew Aizawa-san was busy with work and Yamada-san had gone out earlier to buy things.

Because today, two of their friends were coming over.

(Aizawa-san had told him about this over breakfast as he carefully removed all of the bones from his grilled mackerel. He wasn’t allowed to have fish with bones in them for the time being since he had forgotten last night that humans couldn’t just swallow the bones like owls could. It had been so long since he had to worry about bones in his food, but he had never seen Yamada-san look so scared as he had been in that moment, coughing as the bone had gotten stuck in his throat. Izuku never wanted to see him look like that again.)

Iida Tensei.

Kayama Nemuri.

Those were the names of the people he would meet today.

He still wasn’t really quite sure about meeting them, but he wanted to try. These people were important to Aizawa-san and Yamada-san after all; it was the least he could do.

Yamada-san had even assured him that their friends knew they had to respect his space and not make any sudden loud noises while they were here. It made him feel better hearing that, especially knowing that Yamada-san had gone out of his way to tell them this. It wasn’t something he had to do, but he had done it anyway.

Izuku did wonder why Yamada-san chose to do these things sometimes: always watching out for him, always inviting him to go shopping with him, things like that. He knew that they were a family now, and that meant through thick and thin, through everything, they stuck together.

But Hisashi and his Mama, and him, sometimes, hadn’t they also been a family? That was why his Mama had been so happy Hisashi was home for his last birthday; she had wanted them to celebrate as a family.

Hisashi had never loved him though.

Izuku knew that he had tried to get him to love him before, bringing him pictures he had drawn and showing him the golden star sticker placed on his worksheets by his teacher at daycare. But it never worked. Hisashi had still never cared about any of it.

Mama had loved him.

Loved him enough so that he had never felt unloved, even when Hisashi was there. Loved him so much that she had died to keep Hisashi away from him.

And Aizawa-san loved him too.

Loved him enough to add ‘love’ into the food he cooked for him. And still loved him even though he had choked on a fish bone because he had forgotten he wasn’t an owl and now deboned his fish for him too.

Was it really that much of a stretch that Yamada-san also loved him as well?

Yamada-san had cried when he had seen his drawing on the refrigerator, had basically told people that he was his son, and had even bought him a whole watermelon!

It was more than Hisashi had ever done for him.

He wasn’t sure how to feel about that, but he knew he would much rather have Yamada-san over Hisashi any day. The time he spent with Yamada-san always made him feel warm on the inside, made him want to smile and giggle. It made him want for things he never realized that he actually wanted in his life. He had thought things would be fine, even with Hisashi, because he had his Mama there with him.

But he had no Mama now.

And he would never have his Mama again.

But after just staying with Aizawa-san and Yamada-san for the last few weeks, Izuku had come to realize this was something he really did want. How they treated him, it was what he had expected from Hisashi the entire time. Because fathers were supposed to love you, right? They were supposed to care for you, worry about you. They were supposed to praise you when you did something right and gently correct you when you didn’t.

He had known Aizawa-san was like a father to him, like a dad to him, for a while now. But it was hard to admit and he was so thankful that Aizawa-san seemed to not have heard him call him that when they were at U.A. last week. Because what would he have thought?

It was weird, wasn't it?

Hisashi hadn't even liked it when he had called him 'father', frowning whenever he heard that word from him. He had gotten so used to never even using that word in general because he had figured it would be impossible to ever get Hisashi to see him as his son. Even Mama had been alright with it, and as long as they didn't argue in front of her, it was like things were normal.

But it was different here.

So so different.

It was so different that it made him wonder, would Aizawa-san or Yamada-san want to be called his fathers?

Was it greedy of him to want both Aizawa-san and Yamada-san to be his dads?

Was it selfish of him to want their love and attention? Their warm hugs and smiles?

"Izuku?"

He perked up at the sound of his name, turning to meet Aizawa-san’s concerned gaze.

"Thought you fell asleep on me," He pushed his laptop aside as he yawned and did a quick stretch, arms raised toward the ceiling, "You doing okay?"

He was definitely not doing too great, but he was okay enough, probably. On top of his nerves about the upcoming meeting, he was now also thinking about so many other things, all of which were very important. Because both Aizawa-san and Yamada-san were important to him. And he was important to them.

"I'm okay," He tried to reassure Aizawa-san with a small smile, "I was just doing a lot of thinking."

“A lot of thinking?” Aizawa-san echoed after him with one eyebrow raised, “Having second thoughts on meeting Tensei and Nemuri then?”

“No, it’s something else,” After all, it would be weird to tell Aizawa-san his suspicions about the whole dad thing… But maybe it would be alright to ask him for his thoughts on what Yamada-san felt about him because surely someone like Aizawa-san would know the answer to this, “Hey, Aizawa-san? I have a question.”

“Oh?” He hummed, “I might have an answer.”

“You can’t tell Yamada-san I asked though,” Izuku pressed on, knowing that if he didn’t explain, Yamada-san would probably find out all about this before night fell, “It’s embarrassing!”

“Just how embarrassing could it be?” Aizawa-san asked as turned to face him properly, “But alright, I won’t tell him, as long as this has no negative impact on his well-being.”

Ne-ga-tive im-pact?

“As long as it doesn’t hurt him in some way, then I’ll keep it to myself, alright?”

He nodded.

This sort of thing wouldn’t affect Yamada-san badly, he was sure. It was just something he needed the confirmation or denial of so he could stop thinking about it.

“I… I think…” He started slowly before deciding to just let the words come out; he couldn’t bear to keep this in anymore, “I think that Yamada-san loves me?”

Silence.

Was… he wrong?

Did Yamada-san not love him?

But he was so sure!

Izuku looked up, alarmed, only to see the soft smile on Aizawa-san’s face.

“Yeah, kid,” Aizawa-san finally replied, certainty in his voice, “He does.”

“He loves me,” He couldn’t help but repeat it, the words ringing in his ears, “Yamada-san loves me.”

Even with Aizawa-san’s confirmation, it still felt odd to him, even though he was happy knowing it was true.

How was this possible?

But Hisashi!

“I don’t get it though,” Izuku murmured, “I don’t get it.”

Aizawa-san’s arm pulled him close so that he was pressed against his side, voice a comfortable rumble.

“What don’t you get?”

“I just! It’s weird isn’t it, Aizawa-san?” He buried his head into Aizawa-san’s shirt, feeling tears come to his eyes, “I tried to get Hisashi to love me at first, you know.” Aizawa-san’s arm cradled him even closer, “He was my… He was my father, and he didn’t even like me at all!”

“But Yamada-san loves me,” Izuku sniffled, trying to keep his tears from falling, “Yamada-san loves me and he hasn’t even known me for that long.”

“How can he love me so quickly, Aizawa-san?”

He reached up to rub away at his tears, whispering.

“When I couldn’t even get Hisashi to love me at all?”

Shouta had thought the conversation was going well.

He had been ecstatic to hear that Izuku was realizing that yes, Hizashi did indeed love him. Though it wasn’t as if Hizashi kept that hidden at all, with his doting behavior taking forefront if Izuku happened to be in the same room as him.

It had gone spiraling downwards after that though, and above all, above every other emotion he flashed through as he listened to Izuku speak, anger was one of the most prominent.

Fucking Midoriya Hisashi.

It rankled him how far-reaching that man’s shadow on Izuku was, despite having been such a shit father to him, despite being a suspected murderer. Not that he blamed Izuku, of course. He might not be an expert on children, but he knew enough to realize that children needed things like love and emotional support from their parents. Things that he knew Midoriya Hisashi hadn’t given, but Izuku had wanted, had needed from him.

There wasn’t a day that passed that he wasn’t tempted to go out and do some of his own investigative work on where Midoriya Hisashi had snuck off to and give him a taste of the flat-side of his boot. Multiple times. But Tsukauchi was right in that he was compromised here, that he’d be better off watching over Izuku from where he was now. It was more logical this way, even though his personal preference dictated otherwise. And it didn’t hurt that doing it this way meant that he got to spend more time with Izuku, watching him slowly come out of his shell and create his own space in the little family that he and Hizashi had created together.

He had to control himself though. Izuku had just poured his heart out to him, trusting him with his thoughts. Neither frustration nor anger was appropriate to show for this situation, even if they were his prominent emotions.

“None of this is your fault,” Shouta knew he had to try setting this straight in whatever way he could, “Midoriya Hisashi was a failure of a father to you, Izuku.” And a lot more, but there was no need to mention that here, “You did nothing wrong there.”

He reached out, pulling the box of tissues closer, yanking a couple of them out as well.

“Love is something people have to choose to give freely,” He lightly dabbed at the tears falling down Izuku’s cheeks, “Even though he was your biological father, even if he’s known you for longer, that doesn’t have to mean anything.” Tucking the other tissue into Izuku’s grasp, he then settled his arm around Izuku’s shoulders, neatly tucking him to his side again. “It was his own decision that led him down that path. You didn’t play any role in it.”

“But if I tri—”

“No,” Shouta interrupted him, “You couldn’t have done anything to change his mind.” He softened his voice as he continued to speak, “You mentioned during Tsukauchi’s visit that he hadn’t wanted a kid, right? He had already made his decision back then, even before you were born.”

“But Yamada-san…”

“Hizashi loves you,” He wasn’t going to allow Izuku convince himself otherwise, “This was something he chose to do.” Izuku deserved better than Midoriya Hisashi had given him and that was an irrefutable fact, “It’s true that the two of us haven’t known you for as long as that man has, but these decisions aren’t ones we make, or take, lightly.”

“But why?” Izuku practically whimpered, “Why does he love me?”

“Does there need to be a reason to love someone?”

That brought Izuku to a halt, big green eyes finally peering up at him. His cheeks were visibly wet, so he passed him another tissue to use before they could get too sticky. Izuku was quiet as he wiped at his cheeks, eyes unfocused as he pondered his words.

Shouta didn’t speak further, allowing Izuku time to gather his thoughts. Instead, he flitted his gaze to the clock hanging on the wall, glad that Tensei and Nemuri weren’t scheduled to come by anytime too soon. However, Hizashi should be getting back any minute now. He had only gone out to grab a container of grapefruit juice and some umaibo, the puffy corn snack being one of Nemuri’s favorites.

“Do you want to go wash your face before Hizashi gets back?” He gave Izuku a small nudge, “He should be home soon.”

That had Izuku sitting up and nodding. He quickly got off the couch after detaching himself from his side and disappeared down the hallway and into the bathroom, the faucet turning on a couple of seconds later.

It was only then that Shouta allowed himself a moment to hunch down and breathe.

He’d faced more difficult questions on his Hero Ethics tests, but something about answering these types of questions from Izuku had him holding his breath every time. Were all questions from Izuku going to be this difficult to reply to? In the end, he had ended up parroting the same words that Hizashi had retorted back at him when he had asked the same question. Saving the day even while he was out buying snacks and drinks, none the wiser of the potential crisis his words might have averted, Hizashi was his hero.

As he collected all the used tissues and tossed them away, picking up Izuku’s fallen and forgotten storybook as well, he wondered if he had even managed to resolve Izuku’s troubles in the first place or just stall them for the time being.

Had it been too cruel of him to say that Midoriya Hisashi wasn’t required to love him?

Shouta knew he was blunt.

He also knew that Midoriya Hisashi was a piece of shit.

It was logical to dissuade Izuku from holding onto any sort of remaining attachment to him.

The sound of flowing water stopped, and footfalls announcing Izuku’s approach came. Izuku stopped by the side of the couch, eyes still lightly rimmed red. It would definitely be something Hizashi would notice when he got back.

“Aizawa-san?” Izuku was quiet as he spoke, voice still a bit scratchy, “I don’t think Mama had a reason why she loved me either.”

“But you knew she loved you, right?”

“Mhm.”

“And now you know that Hizashi loves you too.”

“Yeah.”

Izuku smiled.

It was a small thing, but Shouta was happy to see it. He reached out to pat Izuku’s head. Izuku always did seem to enjoy physical affection, even when he had only been an owl to them. It only reinforced the fact that even as an owl, Izuku had still been true to himself in his behavior and preferences.

The sudden sound of a key turning a lock caused them both to look up.

“I’m home!” Hizashi announced as he swung the door open, “And I’ve got snacks!”

“Welcome home, Yamada-san!” Izuku shrugged off his hand, rushing to the door, a grin now adorning his face, “Snacks?”

“Had to get some umaibo for Nemuri, so I got you some too!”

“What flavors?”

“Pizza and curry.”

“They sound yummy.”

“Here ya go,” The sound of a paper bag rustling was heard, “Save it for later, ‘kay?”

“Thank you, Yamada-san!”

Izuku ran back in with his snacks in hand, eyes bright as he showed them to him, the wrappers cheery and decorated with colorful pictures.

“Yamada-san got snacks for me!”

“I can see that,” Shouta gave him a fond look before murmuring, “You feeling a bit better now?”

Izuku nodded, plopping himself down next to him again on the couch, his snacks left on the coffee table, his book now back on his lap.

Hizashi finally made his way into the living room after stopping by the kitchen to put Tensei’s grapefruit juice away, a bag of umaibo in one hand and a wooden serving tray in the other.

“Yo, Shou,” He winked at him as he started to pull the wrapped snacks out, placing them on the tray he placed onto the coffee table, “I’m home.”

“Welcome home, Hizashi.”

After Hizashi had finished setting up the snack tray (which also needed fruits of some kind, really), he settled onto the couch with a small stretch, careful not to kick the table while he was at it.

“Yamada-san?”

“What’s up, kiddo?”

“Could you read to me?”

“Anything for you, ‘Zuku!”

Shouta flicked his gaze over to the happy duo as he picked up his phone. He looked down at his texts, the most recent message still on his screen.

It was from Nemuri.

[14:27] Can’t wait to meet him! Arriving with Tensei!

He glanced over at the clock.

Soon.


Notes:

    Izuku > Yamada-san loves me!

    Izuku > He does?!
    Izuku > ∑ ( °̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥Д°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥ ;)

    It took him a while, but Izuku is more aware than ever now! Shouta, on the other hand, is realizing that kids really do ask the hardest questions xD (And that ever since adding Izuku to their family, they have been going through a lot more tissues rip)

    Hisashi... Not currently in Izuku's life and still causing issues :c

Chapter Text

Hizashi was an observant man.

With a career in heroics, how could he afford not to be? An unobservant pro hero was a dead pro hero and he had no plans to die anytime soon.

That was why he had immediately picked up on the signs that Izuku had cried recently. He had an immediate urge to fuss over him as he joined them on the couch but Shouta had shot him a look complete with a barely noticeable shake of the head, so he had let it go. He did trust that Shouta had resolved whatever had happened while he was out, but it didn't mean he wasn't curious.

Just what sort of thing could have happened in his absence that would make Izuku cry?

There were a lot of possibilities, if he had to be honest. Izuku with tears weren’t exactly a rare sight in their household, though for the most part, they were never from sadness.

Right now, Izuku looked happy, head tilted attentively as he listened to him read aloud from the book in his lap, chiming in every so often when he could identify what was written on the page.

Shouta though, kept glancing over to the clock, eventually standing up and retreating to the kitchen, emerging with a small bowl of washed peaches and cherries and a smaller bowl for discarded pits. Those joined the snacks already on the table, the bowl keeping them separate and making for a bright and cheery centerpiece.

If Shouta was fussing over things like proper presentation, then that must mean that their friends were going to arrive soon. They usually didn’t put so much effort into this sort of thing, but he knew that Shouta did feel mildly guilty for barring them from visiting their apartment for the last few months. Nemuri wasn’t one to visit very often, but Tensei did spend the occasional night if he had business in Musutafu, opting to crash in their ex-guest room instead of zooming his way back home if he missed the last train.

“They’re downstairs,” Shouta had his phone in his hand as he stood up, mere minutes after he had just sat back down too, “I’ll go buzz them in.”

"They’re here…” Izuku murmured, no longer looking at the book, but watching as Shouta left the living room, “Yamada-san…” He gently tugged at his sleeve, “You’ll love me no matter what happens, right?”

“Huh?” He stared down at Izuku, who was in turn, looking up at him, “Yeah, of course I will!”

Izuku gave him a small tight-lipped smile as he got off the couch, slipping behind it instead, ducking down so he couldn’t even see him anymore. Hizashi paid him no mind, instead, marveling over Izuku’s words to him. Was it sappy of him to put so much stock in mere words? To know that Izuku had the confidence in him to believe that he’d continue loving him, it made him happy beyond anything he could say.

It was only a quiet few minutes he could relish in before he could hear Nemuri’s voice from behind their door.

“Shouta!” Hizashi turned his head just in time to catch a small glimpse of the top of Izuku’s head shrinking back down, completely hidden from view once again, “Hizashi!” He hoped that Izuku wasn’t too anxious about meeting Nemuri and Tensei, though from the looks of it, he was still pretty unnerved about the entire situation. “Open the door already!”

“You’re too loud, Nemuri,” Tensei’s voice cut in, “Didn’t they say that Izuku-chan didn’t like loud noises? And you’re probably disturbing their neighbors.”

“Oh, right,” Nemuri replied, voice a bit quieter as she started to knock as well, “Shouta! Do—”

“Quiet,” Hizashi could hear Shouta grunt, “You’ve probably scared him already with how loud you were being.”

“Aw, sorry, Shouta!” Tensei apologized, “Thanks for inviting us over though.” Hizashi could hear them step into their apartment, taking their shoes off and switching to guest slippers, “I’m glad we can finally meet your new—”

“Where is he?” Nemuri practically skipped into the living room, eyes scanning it for signs of where Izuku likely was, “I brought presents!”

“Hizashi!” Tensei stepped in a few seconds afterwards, bag swinging from his elbow as he waved, speaking as Nemuri continued to peer under tables and chairs, “How have you two been?”

“We’ve been doing pretty good!” Hizashi nodded as he placed Izuku’s book onto the coffee table, “How about you? Get up to anything new?”

“Tenya chipped a tooth running into a tree the other day actually,” He laughed, “I’m glad we got him extra pairs of glasses as a precaution, else the kid would be running into even more things!”

“Didn’t you do the same thing as a kid?” Shouta asked as he returned to the living room, a large jug of barley tea in hand, the condensation on the surface beading up; he returned to the kitchen, still speaking, “Doesn’t seem very logical to allow your brother to run into things all the time.”

“It’s good practice!” Tensei sat next to him, bag in his lap, “Better he learn that control now at home than to have him knocking into telephone poles out in the streets when he gets older.”

“Where is he?” Nemuri pouted as she stooped to snag an umaibo from the snack tray, unwrapping it and popping half of it into her mouth, “I just wanna say ‘hi’ to him.”

“Uh,” Hizashi wasn’t sure if he should even share Izuku’s location, not if it might result in Izuku not wanting to leave where he currently was, “Around?”

“Izuku?” Shouta called out as he returned again, this time with a paring knife and an assortment of cups, “It’s snack time.”

Hizashi could hear Izuku squeak from behind the couch, Tensei turning his head in surprise at the small sound. Nemuri did perk up though, leaning over the table to go through the bag sitting on Tensei’s lap.

“I’ve got the perfect solution for this,” She pulled out a… stick? A stick with some sort of fabric extending from it which ended in a mouse, “Sushi loves this one, so I got one for Izuku-chan.” She positioned herself by the end of the couch and wiggled the cat toy against the floor. And it was a cat toy; he’s seen enough of them to be able to recognize one, “He isn’t gonna be able to resist it.”

It was exceedingly rare that he was at a loss for words, but that was the very situation he was dealing with here. He could only watch as Nemuri wiggled the mouse closer and closer to where the back of the couch met the wall. Shouta wasn’t even paying her any heed, more interested in pouring out the tea into cups. Tensei was watching though, with an eager smile on his face like nothing out of the ordinary was happening.

Hizashi quickly picked up his phone from the table, swiping out of his lock screen of Izuku in his cat hoodie and tapping into the group chat that they shared with their friends. He scrolled past the most recent messages, stopping at the ones where he and Shouta had even mentioned Izuku to them.

[18:23] EraserBed: Hizashi and I have someone we want you to meet.

[18:23] MresentPic: His name is Izuku.

[18:25] EraserBed: He’s still skittish around new people and loud noises, so you need to be quiet when you’re over.

[18:26] EraserBed: Don’t wear any heavy perfume, Nemuri. He’s not used to strong scents.

[18:27] Ingenyoom: Wow, Shouta! Where’d you get him? When even? Knew you two were up to something!

[18:29] EraserBed: The streets. We’re still working on getting him to eat more regularly.

[18:30] EraserBed: Recent. It took us a while to bring him home with us.

[18:33] NemuNemu: How does he feel about a friend? I think Sushi would be a good playmate for him??

[18:39] EraserBed: I don’t think he’d adjust well to another predator in his territory right now.

Shouta had done most of the answering that night. He had been busy finishing up his paperwork, wanting to be ahead of his schedule so he’d be able to take the days off for his own birthday as well as Izuku’s. Another scan through the messages still brought him nothing.

There was nothing wrong with what Shouta had told them.

So why were they both acting like this?

He was so confused.

Izuku was very good at hiding.

That was something he was sure of. It was a skill he had developed and improved on when he still lived outside on his own with no Aizawa-san or Yamada-san. Hiding was something he was very familiar with, but there was something different about hiding behind the couch. It was dark behind the couch, but if he looked up, he could see the bright color of the strands of Yamada-san’s hair. And he could hear Aizawa-san speak, calling him for snack time.

He could also hear the voices of Aizawa-san and Yamada-san’s friends as they also spoke. One of them really wanted to find him, so he just tucked himself a bit closer to behind Yamada-san, further from where he had gotten in. Yamada-san knew where he was, had watched him go behind the couch, so he wasn’t worried about hiding at all.

The only thing he didn’t like about being behind the couch was how dark (and dusty!) it was.

Not that he didn’t like the dark.

He loved the dark!

The dark made him feel safe!

It was when he could fly in the sky without too much fear that other people would find him. It was when he could hunt for his food and not get attacked by other birds because they were usually sleeping by the time the sky was dark. The sky was also at it's prettiest when it was dark, lit up only by the moon and stars.

Yamada-san called him a night owl, or even his ‘li’l night owl’ sometimes. That must have meant that Aizawa-san was Yamada-san’s ‘big night owl’ or something along the lines of that. But, he liked the nickname. It was definitely better than ‘Deku’ and it was given to him by someone that he knew loved him. That made all the difference.

Despite his love of the dark, the darkness behind the couch was different.

It was small, a bit cramped, and what was that?

Even with his human eyes, he could catch the flicking motion of something wiggling at the other end of the couch. Human eyes really were horrible for seeing in the dark. If he had his owl eyes, he would have been able to see exactly what it was already instead of squinting and making guesses. He didn’t want to get closer without knowing what it was first.

It made him feel weirdly excited to watch it move though, his eyes tracking the movement of it the entire time. He could almost pretend he was an owl again, ready to hunt down something to eat. Aizawa-san had said it was snack time after all, so this had to be what he meant. It had been a while since he had caught his own meal, so this would be good practice for when he could do it again.

He continued to watch as it twitched, moving around in a circle before dashing to where he couldn’t see, back to where he could. Narrowing his eyes, he did his best to be silent as he scooted himself closer, positioning himself so he could get a clear shot at it if he grabbed it with his hands and crushed it to death. His talons would be perfect for this, but since he didn’t have those, human fingers would have to do. And if that failed, he could just bite down. His sharp owl beak and his human teeth sort of did the same thing, didn’t they?

The creature, some sort of mouse probably, started wiggling even more. Mice in homes weren’t good, he knew that; he would be helping Aizawa-san and Yamada-san keep their home clean of pests if he ate this one.

For a split second, he saw it. The shape of the ears, the long tail, and the little paws. It was definitely a mouse. Either that or a very small rat. And he even saw some sort of stick behind it, also wiggling. But the big thing was, he saw.

Izuku dove forward, determined to not let this chance go to waste.

His fingers sank into the mouse and he chirped as he felt it jerking in his hand. Human fingers really weren’t good at this he mused, quickly shoving it into his mouth instead and trying to retreat back to behind Yamada-san.

It was a bit annoying to do, since it seemed like it was stuck, but after a small growl, (all he could really do with his mouth full of mouse), it slackened suddenly and he was able to pull the rest of it with him. He couldn’t see much again once back where was, but he didn’t need to see to be able to kill.

Squeak

Izuku bit down again, the mouse in his mouth squeaking as he did.

They… weren’t supposed to do that, were they?

He bit down once more to make sure.

This one definitely did.

“I’m just saying, Shouta,” He could hear someone say, “That’s one weird cat you two have.”

“W-Why do you think we have a cat?” Yamada-san sputtered, “We never said we got a cat!”

He continued to chew at the mouse, squeaks still coming out of it every couple of seconds. It wasn’t as if owls had much of a sense of taste, but this didn’t even taste warm! Warm food was always better than cold food. But even while knowing that, he bit at it a few more times.

“Izuku?” And that was Aizawa-san calling for him now, “That better not be in your mouth.”

Izuku started to chew faster, Aizawa-san’s warning tone not something he wanted to go against.

“It’s not even food,” Izuku looked up in surprise at the sudden closeness of Aizawa-san's voice, only to guiltily meet the eyes staring down at him, “And you don’t know where it’s been.” He sighed, looking very tired at that moment, even as he reached down for him, easily picking him up even from where he was leaning against the wall, “Come on, up you go.”

Aizawa-san gently set him back down right in front of a very concerned Yamada-san, who had also apparently been looking behind the couch.

“‘Zuku!” He worried, pushing himself off the couch, “That’s a toy!”

He figured, spitting the toy mouse out of his mouth.

“It wasn’t warm and didn’t even have any blood,” Izuku helpfully told Yamada-san who quickly paled even as he was patting the dust off his shirt, “Not tasty at all.”

“You didn’t swallow any of it, did you?”

Izuku shook his head.

Yamada-san let out a relieved sigh.

“Hizashi?” The person sitting on the couch was watching him with wide eyes, “That’s not a cat.”

“And I'm saying we never said we got a cat!”

“You’re telling me you two picked up a kid?!”

“Don’t sound so incredulous, Nemuri!”

All the loud voices were starting to make his head hurt. He shrank back to Aizawa-san’s side, choosing to watch him slice open a peach instead, the white meat looking juicy and smelling sweet. He twisted the two sides apart, separating the meat from the stone in the middle. The peach was then sliced into neat wedges.

“Go rinse out your mouth and I’ll get these three to quiet down some, okay?” Aizawa-san gave him a nudge, “You can have some of this peach after that.”

Izuku nodded, content to let Aizawa-san do this. Aizawa-san was very good at getting people to be quiet after all. Even the criminals he caught at night were all quiet after a warning flash from Erasure.

He made his way to the bathroom sink, pulling down his cup from the cabinet after getting onto the footstool. Rinsing his mouth was a lot easier than brushing teeth thankfully, so it didn’t take long. He made sure to spit out any bits of fluff that had managed to get stuck to his tongue. Gross.

“Yes, Nemuri, Izuku is our kid.”

“Don’t look so surprised.”

“Now stop making a ruckus before I kick you out because you’ve upset Izuku.”

Aizawa-san’s voice was stern and loud enough that he could even hear it over the sound of flowing water from the faucet. He quickly rinsed his mouth once more (just in case) before placing his cup back and then returning the footstool to where it usually was.

“What’s in the bag, Tensei?”

“I was just keeping hold of it for Nemuri!”

“Nemuri?”

“Just some catnip.”

“You got drugs for him?”

Izuku had to cover his mouth to muffle his gasp after hearing that.

Drugs were bad.

That was something he knew and had been lectured on multiple times. Not only just taking them, but even just having them was bad sometimes. Didn’t Aizawa-san and Yamada-san’s friends know this? It seemed like an important thing to know too, especially for friends of pro heroes.

He had carefully made his way back to the living room, quickly looking around to make sure he knew where Aizawa-san and Yamada-san were now. Aizawa-san was in the same place as before, sitting with his feet tucked underneath him by the coffee table. Yamada-san was sitting cross-legged next to him. The other two people, their friends were on the couch. There was no way he was sitting on the couch with people he didn’t know, so he slipped in between Aizawa-san and Yamada-san and sat down.

(Oddly enough, the toy he had left on the floor was gone. He wondered where it went.)

“Hello, Izuku-kun!” One of them smiled at him, “I’m one of Shouta and Hizashi’s friends, Iida Tensei.”

It really was better he inform them of this as soon as possible. Aizawa-san and Yamada-san would surely be sad if their friends had to be taken away by the hat-man and put into jail.

“You can get arrested for having drugs, you know.”

“I…” The man, Iida-san, looked surprised and then concerned, his facial expressions very open and easy to figure out, “Why do you know about drugs?”

He accepted a piece of peach from Aizawa-san who was now eating cherries, spitting the pits out onto a napkin. Yamada-san had his mouth covered by a hand, kind of looking like he wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. Izuku didn’t understand what was funny or sad about the situation. It was neither!

“I’ve heard people talk about them before.” He bit into the peach slice, delighted by the taste and fondly remembering the flavor of the jelly pouch he had in Nedzu-san’s office, “In the streets.”

“Can you name one for me?” He didn’t sound like he really believed him; it kind of reminded him of his old teacher back in daycare when she would ask him something but also expect him to not know the answer at the same time. Unlike his old teacher though, Iida-san didn't sound like he wanted to be mean, or even want to laugh at him. He only sounded worried, “Any drug at all.”

"'Zuku, wai—"

He could hear Yamada-san hurriedly say, but he didn't stop, wanting to prove that he knew what he was talking about.

“Trigger.”

It was the one he knew about best.

(And it was also the only one he knew if he didn’t count ‘catnip’.)

Iida-san looked horrified at his answer, immediately sending an accusing gaze to Aizawa-san and then to Yamada-san.

“Why does he know about Trigger?” His eyes weren’t happy, “He’s a kid!”

"It's… It's a long story."

"Well, we have the afternoon off so get talking."

Kayama-san, if he remembered correctly, snapped her fingers at them. Yamada-san didn't look too happy, but Aizawa-san only sighed at her words.

"You're not getting away with dodging questions this time, boys."

Chapter Text

Pity was something Izuku was used to seeing from others.

Whether it had been from his Mama whenever she thought he wasn't looking at her, or from their neighbors who always whispered lowly to each other before offering them fake smiles, he had seen it all.

When he started living with Aizawa-san and Yamada-san, he had been a bit nervous that they would look at him with pity as well. Because bad things happening to people usually would bring those kinds of looks. And he did realize that his Mama getting killed and then him going into hiding for so long counted as something bad.

But Aizawa-san and Yamada-san never looked at him that way. They comforted him when he did feel sad about things, but they never made it all about what had happened to him or thought less of him for it. They just wanted to make sure he was okay now and he liked that a lot.

When he had still had his Mama, people looked at them with pity because he was Quirkless. Because people saw him as incapable of ever amounting to anything in life without a quirk and they all felt sorry for his Mama because he was her son.

Even if pity was something he was used to seeing, it didn’t mean he liked it though. People pitying him only meant that they didn’t understand. They didn’t understand that even without a quirk, he was still the same person. They didn’t understand that his Mama was still the same person who always greeted them while out shopping too.

Nothing had changed about them, but how everyone looked at them changed all the same.

So when he saw Iida-san look at him with those eyes, he wanted to scream.

This was Iida-san’s first time meeting him too, so there was no way he’d just understand.

“You shouldn’t feel bad for me now,” He said, trying to at least not sound too annoyed, “Nothing’s changed.”

“He’s right!” Kayama-san cheerfully elbowed Iida-san, “Izuku-chan is still the same little kid who just tried to eat a cat toy like five minutes ago!”

“But!” Iida-san protested, “You're just a child!”

“Bad things can happen to children too,” He pointed out with a shrug, “And I lived.” Shoving the rest of his peach slice into his mouth, he made sure to chew before swallowing it. “If I had to go outside right now and live there again, I could totally do it.”

Yamada-san made an odd choking sound next to him, and he immediately felt bad seeing the look in his eyes.

“Not that I would!” He bumped the side of his head against Yamada-san’s arm to let him know that he wasn’t going to do that, “I like Aizawa-san and Yamada-san too much to do that.” Plus, he knew they’d be scared for him. And they’d definitely worry too much; he hated making them worry too much. “I’m just saying, I could. And I would have been fine.”

Iida-san looked like he had eaten something that had upset his stomach. Kayama-san was laughing though, even though he was pretty sure what he said wasn't funny.

"Loosen up, Tensei!" She elbowed Iida-san again, "What matters is that Izuku-chan is safe now, right?” He nodded, though he still didn’t look very happy; she then turned to him with a smile, “Izuku-chan, I’m Kayama Nemuri! You can call me Nemuri-nee-chan!”

“Okay, Kayama-san.”

There was absolutely no way he was going to call her that.

“Shouta!” She apparently also found this hilarious, breaking out into giggles, “He acts like you!”

“Even though he’s only started staying with us a few weeks ago, we’ve known him for longer than that,” Aizawa-san passed him another wedge of peach which he happily accepted and ate in two bites, “It’s only logical that he picked up on a few things from the both of us, like good manners.”

Izuku found himself allowing Aizawa-san and Yamada-san to continue the conversation in his stead. It was better that they talk; not only were they better at it, but he was more interested in his snacks than talking with people right now.

The curry flavored umaibo was the one he chose to open first, giving it a sniff before scooting some of it out of the wrapper. He gave it a small nibble, because while Yamada-san was usually pretty good at choosing flavors, he also thought actual lemons were nice snacks. However, it was pretty good! Nothing like Aizawa-san’s cooking, but he couldn’t think of anything better than Aizawa-san’s cooking really.

Breaking off a piece, he tapped it against Yamada-san’s cheek, close to his mouth. Yamada-san didn’t say anything, just leaned down and took it from his fingers, eating it in one bite.

“Thanks, ‘Zuku,” He gave him a kind smile after finishing the piece given to him, “Do you like it?”

“Mhm,” Izuku broke off another piece, this time tapping it at the side of Aizawa-san’s lips, “It’s good.”

Aizawa-san also didn’t need him to say anything, retrieving his piece quickly. He wasn’t quick enough though, one of his fingers getting licked before he could take it back. And from the mischievous look on Aizawa-san’s face, it was clear that he thought it was funny.

Izuku thought it was gross.

He quickly wiped Aizawa-san’s spit off his finger using the closest and best thing available: Aizawa-san’s pants.

“There has been dirtier things on these than just a bit of saliva,” Aizawa-san shrugged, not even bothered by the wet spot, “It was tasty though. Thank you, Izuku.”

“The three of you really do get along so well,” Kayama-san mused as Iida-san stood, excusing himself to go get a cup of grapefruit juice, “Hey, Shouta mentioned to us that you like learning about quirks, Izuku-chan.” She pointed to herself with a grin, “Do you want to know what mine is?”

Izuku nodded, having been a bit curious the entire time. Iida-san’s quirk seemed to be the things on his elbows, but Kayama-san didn’t have anything extra or different that he noticed so far. Not that he would be able to tell what sort of quirk she might have just by looking at her. If she had a type of mutation quirk like Nedzu-san’s, it would be impossible to just see.

"It's called Somnambulist," She tapped her arm with a finger, "I can release a fragrance from my skin that makes people fall asleep."

"Instant nap time!" He blurted out without thinking, then lowering his voice to a mumble, embarrassed that he had been so loud, "That’s… That's a really cool quirk. I like it."

“You do?” Izuku could see the faint surprise in her eyes, “Thank you.”

“It’s a very helpful quirk too,” He continued, “Sleep is important. Aizawa-san says so.”

And it was important, he knew that.

But it wasn’t his fault that he wasn’t tired when Yamada-san said it was time to go to bed. And if he wasn’t tired, then it made no sense to go to sleep. It also didn’t help that night was the time Aizawa-san went out for his patrols.

He knew Aizawa-san was a really good hero. That was something he was sure of. But he worried a lot. He couldn’t be out there to watch over him anymore now and there were probably lots of people with knives that Eraserhead had to fight! Not that he was supposed to ever get involved in a fight. He knew that all too well. Getting lectured again by Aizawa-san wasn’t exactly something he wanted.

“It sure is, kiddo!” She cheerfully replied, shifting her legs a bit so Iida-san could pass by and sit again, this time with his juice in hand, “Though I’m a bit surprised you like my quirk so much.”

Izuku tilted his head in confusion. Why wouldn’t he like a quirk like that?

“It’s not very flashy,” Kayama-san said, almost sheepishly, “It feels like most kids nowadays aren’t interested in quirks that have little to no combat potential.”

Combat potential?

“One that can be used to fight,” Yamada-san explained, “Like my Voice or whatever quirk All Might has going on.”

So a quirk like Kacchan’s Explosion.

“Aizawa-san’s Erasure is the coolest quirk I know," Izuku shrugged, "And it doesn't have any of that either." It sure did look cool though. He wondered what Kayama-san using her quirk looked like. "How you use it is more important, isn't it?"

Kayama-san's quirk would not only be good for instant naps, but also for making villains fall asleep. Sleeping villains couldn't do bad things, so it would be really helpful to use to arrest them. A quirk like that meant there was no need to fight at all!

"You're very insightful for someone still so young," Kayama-san hummed as she opened the wrapper of another umaibo, "I can totally see why you and Shouta get along so well."

"In-sight-ful?"

"Showing a deep understanding of something."

"Oh, maybe a little bit then," He conceded with a nod, "I have a lot of time to think about quirks."

His own quirk wasn't one with combat potential either, now that he thought about it. Unless all he fought were rats and pigeons? Animals with quirks were rare though and he didn't want to eat them, especially not if they were like Nedzu-san. He was strong though, his grip was strong enough to break bones even. But it was something he had never done to a person and he wasn't sure he wanted to try in the future either.

“What about Tensei?” Kayama-san asked as she gestured to Iida-san with the end of her snack, using it as a pointer of sorts, “What do you think Tensei’s quirk is?”

“Iida-san’s quirk?”

Izuku murmured as Aizawa-san got up next to him, taking with him the bowl of pits. He started to get up too, but Aizawa-san nudged him back down with a small shake of his head, saying that he had to start on dinner.

And to the kitchen Aizawa-san went.

At the very least, he still had Yamada-san with him. He wasn’t sure he’d like being alone with just them for any amount of time, so having one of his adults was better than none.

It was awkward though.

They were Aizawa-san and Yamada-san’s friends, not his.

But with Aizawa-san not allowing him to follow him into the kitchen, that meant he was stuck. Kayama-san was nice and Izuku could see she was trying, he really did appreciate that. Iida-san just looked sad every time he looked at him though. And that wasn’t something he liked. Still, Kayama-san had asked him a question, and it was rude to not reply.

“Iida-san’s quirk are the things in his elbows,” He started slowly, eyes narrowing at those elbows, “There are holes in them. So that means something has to go into it, or something has to come out, right?”

“You could say that,” Iida-san nodded, “How about a small hint?”

Izuku nodded, his curiosity about this new quirk overwhelming his desire to avoid talking to Iida-san.

“You’ve seen these before on vehicles.”

Vehicles.

He looked up at Yamada-san who blinked at him before clarifying.

“Something taken as transportation to get to one place from another.”

“Like a car?”

“Mhm.”

Had he though?

It wasn’t as if he looked at cars all the time. He knew they had four wheels and windows, but the things on Iida-san’s elbows definitely weren’t either of those. What else did a car have that sort of looked like metal tubes?

Actually, wait.

Did it matter if he knew what they were called or not?

As long as he figured out the quirk itself, then the question had an answer.

“If what you have is also in a car, then maybe your quirk lets you do what a car does,” Izuku scrambled to put together an example, the words clashing together in his mouth, “I mean! A car! You can go places like a car without walking. And cars can honk, and have buttons to open windows?”

“You think I’m a car?”

“Are you a car?”

Hizashi was nearly struck speechless at Izuku’s guesses.

Nemuri was covering her mouth at Izuku’s answer, but he could still hear her muffled laughter. And if he could hear it, he didn’t doubt Izuku could as well. Izuku’s lips were pulled in a pout, fingers fidgeting with the material of the rug they were both sitting on.

“You’re not completely off the mark, ‘Zuku,” He soothed, carefully separating those fingers from the rug, allowing him to grasp his hand instead, “Tensei can go as fast as a car with his quirk, faster even!”

“A speed quirk?” Izuku turned to peek over at Tensei again, “But aren’t only his arms fast? ‘Cause they’re on his elbows?”

“If my arms were that fast, I would have finished with homework way quicker back in school,” Tensei chuckled, his shoulders finally losing some of the tension that had only grown since Izuku had spilled that he knew something like Trigger even existed, “It’s called Engine. My quirk lets me shoot myself forward at turbo speeds.”

“Engine,” Izuku repeated slowly, nearly reluctantly even, “That’s a pretty cool quirk too.”

“Thanks,” Tensei gave him a small grin, “My entire family has the same quirk actually. Pretty neat, yeah?”

Izuku solemnly nodded.

And with that, Tensei started to chat about his quirk and its practical applications, Izuku listening intently with interested eyes, occasionally giving his own thoughts on how it could be used.

Hizashi was just glad they were getting along better than they had before. Truth be told, he hadn’t expected Tensei to be the one that Izuku would hold reservations towards, if only for the fact that Tensei was usually very good with children, able to calm their cries with a smile, an outstretched hand, and a few words. He supposed it came hand in hand with having a younger sibling he could practice his child charming skills on.

But despite all of that, Tensei did hold a great deal of affection towards children, and meeting one like Izuku… He really did underestimate how much Tensei would care, how angry he would get on Izuku’s behalf. They had gotten used to Izuku knowing more about certain subjects compared to others his age, not even batting an eyelash when he mentioned the violent things he had seen or heard on the streets. Both he and Shouta encouraged his speaking up even, wanting him to feel comfortable sharing what he knew, knowing that they wouldn’t judge him on what he brought up.

This was why he and Shouta were still undecided on what steps to take on furthering Izuku’s education. Public school was the most obvious choice. There, he’d be able to meet others in his age group and socialize, make a few friends perhaps. Lots of benefits for public school if you asked him.

But this meeting with Nemuri and Tensei only made more apparent the possible issues that could crop up if Izuku ended up attending a public school.

Izuku felt more than comfortable telling other people what he knew about sensitive subjects. Shouta had impressed upon him what had to be classified for official reasons, but Izuku still knew a lot, and he was willing to share what he knew if asked.

(There were times where they didn’t need to ask and Izuku would volunteer some information on the best way to squeeze a pigeon to death while they were eating dinner or something. How Shouta could continue with his meal without falling victim to nausea was amazing. His husband sure was multi-talented.)

That was the thing though.

Even Tsukauchi hadn’t been spared from Izuku’s oversharing, now having the knowledge that Izuku had eaten big rats and was very proud of that fact still. It was definitely something he could see Izuku sharing with his classmates, his chest puffed out with pride. And that was one of the more tame things in his arsenal of information.

Trigger on the other hand… That wouldn’t be something he or Shouta could explain away easily. Tensei and Nemuri were pros; they would be able to keep this to themselves. Children however, were prone to gossip. Information learned was information shared freely and in the end, it would undoubtedly make its way to the ears of an adult in an authoritative position.

Shouta had reassured him many times that their status as Izuku’s foster parents was solid, but wouldn’t something like the knowledge of illegal quirk-enhancing drugs bring unwanted attention? Izuku was alive in the eyes of the law now; they wouldn’t be able to do what they had done before to sweep him up into their custody.

And there was also the question of what Izuku wanted.

When he and Shouta had brought up school to him, he had shown both eagerness and uneasiness in equal measures. Izuku enjoyed learning, something made very apparent early on in his stay. Lesson-time was actually one of the few times he would freely ask questions without any nudging, so interested he was in everything they tried to teach him, wanting to always know more. And while that was all and good, they both also knew that Izuku still didn’t feel comfortable around people unless they were also there to provide a buffer, and schools were full of people, full of strangers he didn’t know.

On the other hand, though Shouta didn't like the thought of it at all, there was also Nedzu's offer to take into account as well. Being that Nedzu was familiar with Izuku's situation and also one of Izuku's favorite people to talk to already made him the favored choice to continue Izuku's schooling honestly.

They hadn't brought it up to Izuku yet, but Hizashi couldn't imagine Izuku not leaping onto that offer once he heard that it was an option for him. U.A. was also one of the safest places they knew of, meaning that he and Shouta wouldn't have to worry too much after he had been dropped off for lessons. This wasn't even taking into account that Nedzu was undoubtedly one of the smartest people out there. Izuku having the opportunity to learn from him directly would be an honor.

(His reasoning still didn't sway Shouta much though, even if he had agreed that all his points were logical and backed with irrefutable evidence. Shouta seemed oddly certain that leaving Izuku with Nedzu alone for any extended amount of time might result in the figurative end of the world, or actual lesson plans that would do the same.)

“You’re apologizing to me?”

Izuku’s incredulous voice broke him free of his thoughts. Had he really gotten so caught up in thinking about Izuku’s future that he had missed a whole apology happening right in front of him?

“Yes,” Tensei’s hands were clenched, “I don’t know if Hizashi or Shouta had mentioned to you that I’m a pro hero, but regardless of that,” He bowed, back in a perfect ninety degree angle, “A hero’s job is to serve the public, to protect the people. We failed you.”

Hizashi hid a wince, knowing that Tensei wasn’t wrong. But he wasn’t fully correct either. Izuku’s trust in people had been shattered, only that long stretch of time alone allowed him to piece bits of it back together in time to meet Shouta. Hizashi doubted that Tensei would have been able to get close enough to Izuku with how snippy the owl had been originally. Even he had gotten his fair share of warning nips if he got too close, or loud, for comfort.

“You don’t work in Musutafu though,” Izuku pointed out, “I can recognize all the heroes that work at night here, and you’re not one of them.” Hizashi could feel his smaller hand slightly trembling inside his own; he gave it a light squeeze, attempting to silently comfort him. This was Izuku’s time to shine in the spotlight, not his, “And you’re apologizing for the wrong thing.”

“The wrong thing?”

Tensei echoed after him, still bent over in a bow. Nemuri honestly looked like she was having the time of her life despite not contributing much to the conversation, several umaibo wrappers piled up on the coffee table in front of her.

“I don’t want your pity.”

Izuku’s words were nearly cutting and Hizashi vaguely wondered if this was also a thing he had picked up from Shouta.

“But I wasn’t pitying you?”

“Eh?”

So it had been a misunderstanding between the two of them that had caused Izuku’s animosity towards Tensei. Not that he wouldn’t have thrown down on Izuku’s behalf, but he was glad he didn’t have to. Sparring against Tensei always had him end up with too many bruises to count.

“Then what was that look on your face before?”

Izuku just sounded bewildered now.

“I was thinking,” Tensei finally rose up from his bow, “I was thinking about my brother.” He heaved a sigh before continuing to speak. “He’s about your age, and when Shouta and Hizashi shared your story with us, I couldn’t help but imagine Tenya in your shoes.”

Well shit.

Izuku seemed to have the same reaction as him, finally realizing what something like that could mean.

“You must... love your brother a lot then, Iida-san.”

“I do.”

With those final words, Izuku nodded and then after excusing himself, quickly got onto his feet and retreated into the kitchen. He could hear Shouta chopping something in there still, getting a head start on prepping ingredients for dinner tonight. Ah, introverts, gotta love ‘em.

“He really is quite adorable, if I may say,” Nemuri broke into laughter after a shared moment of silence between the three of them, “Full of fire and spite, why, I could eat him right up!”

“Izuku's usually much more reserved than this, believe it or not,” Hizashi took a sip of his barley tea, trying to gather his thoughts together, “A mini-Shouta in the flesh.” And now for the obligatory warning so they wouldn’t be responsible for any future bite-related injuries from Izuku, “Also, Nemuri, if you tried that with him, he’d probably bite you.”

“Wait, seriously?” Tensei asked, voice incredulous, “Actually, I take that back." He picked up the bag holding the catnip that sat between him and Nemuri. "I can see him do more than just bite."

"He's so sweet with you and Shouta though," Nemuri hummed as she poured herself more tea, "I'm amazed that he's so quick to share actually." She placed the jug back onto the table atop the coaster. "Don't most street kids tend to hoard?"

"If there was one thing Izuku had plenty of, it was food," Hizashi spared a second to think of that balcony pigeon that used to shit on their balcony, "Pigeons and rats for days."

While Nemuri made a face and Tensei paled, he laughed, happy knowing that this meeting had been a success despite the odd start it had.

This was a good day.

They would be fine.

Chapter Text

Shouta was a patient man.

He needed to be, considering his career path. Patience was a good quality for a pro hero to have, and one he hoped all pro heroes had.

One excessively eager step ahead could spell the difference between life and death.

Patience was also something he was finding that parents needed. Not that Izuku was unruly in any sort of way, always managing to be polite if somewhat blunt in most situations.

And bluntness wasn't a bad thing; it was refreshing actually to have someone speak so frankly. It meant that there was no dancing around subjects, less potential confusion overall, and the general knowledge that Izuku approved of how fatherly they acted towards him. Because if he did disapprove, he would have voiced it out, right?

Probably.

However, despite all of this, he still needed every single bit of patience he could muster. Because while Izuku tended to be very straightforward in his speech, he also had a tendency to wait before asking for help. He would wait until he was very thirsty before asking for a glass of water, stare at a page in his book for minutes on end trying to decipher what was written before asking for any clarification, and also wait for him to initiate afternoon snack time even if he was hungry.

He did his best to stay on top of this behavior, keeping an eye on him while he worked at home. There were times he couldn't though, needing to give his complete attention to files he had to look through and memorize for future missions.

The first time this had happened, Izuku had ended up napping on the couch, his book open to the same page he had seen him at nearly an hour ago. The second time had him looking up from case files to a stomach faintly growling next to him, even as the owner of said hungry stomach continued to work on a picture of Present Mic in his notebook.

It was then he decided that this couldn't continue happening. Every half hour, he told himself. After every thirty minutes that passed as he worked, he would take a small five minute break and check in on Izuku, and help him with whatever he might need at the moment.

Patience.

This was something he had to take steadily, one day at a time.

Showing Izuku that he and Hizashi could be approached for absolutely anything, it was going to be a gradual, but necessary process. He and Hizashi were observant, but they weren’t omniscient.

So when Izuku approached him on his own one early afternoon, a resolute look on his face, he didn't rush him, didn't intercept him with a question. He allowed Izuku to come up to him, allowed him to tentatively tap his arm to gain his attention, before turning to address him.

"Is there something you need, Izuku?"

Izuku gave him a small nod.

“Can we…" He sounded slightly nervous asking, "Can we go outside?”

Shouta blinked.

This request wasn't something he had expected, especially not so soon. Izuku generally disliked leaving the apartment during light hours, though there were a few exceptions. Izuku did enjoy going out with Hizashi for snack runs after all, and recently even accompanied them out to buy a new pair of shoes at a nearby store, much to Hizashi's delight.

He had never been the one to suggest going out though.

“Of course we can,” Shouta stretched as he stood, making sure to work out all the kinks in his back; sitting for an extended amount of time really wasn't a good habit, “Is there someplace in particular you want to go?”

“Somewhere with lots of stores,” Izuku followed him into the master bedroom, leaning against their bedspread as he grabbed his wallet from the nightstand, “Lots and lots.”

“You don’t even like shopping that much,” He pointed out as he poked through the closet, “What are you looking to find?”

“You gotta keep it a secret from Yamada-san though,” Izuku clambered onto their bed, seating himself on the edge, his feet swinging, each thump only reminding him that he still hasn’t found a new place to put that box of knives that was still under their bed, “Yamada-san can’t know until his birthday.”

“So a birthday present?”

“Mhm.”

Cute.

Very cute.

Shouta could already imagine how Hizashi finding out would go. It would involve lots of tears and hugs, no doubt. Hizashi was always happy to know that Izuku thought of him even when he wasn’t there with them.

“Alright,” He nodded, beckoning to Izuku as he left the room, closing it behind him after they both had exited, “I’ll keep quiet about it.”

As they walked down the short hallway, he wondered what sort of birthday Hizashi would want this year. With Izuku now part of their lives, things were more limited in that regard, though he was sure that they would be able to have a nice time despite those limits. He could make fried chicken for dinner, something that Hizashi loved and an activity that he was sure Izuku would enjoy. Plus, if he cut them small enough, then they could eat them with toothpicks. Finger food with none of the greasy mess. It was the logical way to do things.

He stopped by the kitchen to fill their bottles with water, making sure to tighten the cap so none of it leaked out. Taking them with him to the entranceway, he placed them down on top of the nearby cabinet, moving to put his boots on.

“Do you like fried chicken?”

“If Aizawa-san makes it,” Izuku hummed as he put on his sandals, “Then I’m sure it’s tasty.”

“But do you like it?”

“I think so? I know I had it before, but I don’t really remember what it tasted like.”

Right.

He had nearly forgotten about that tidbit of information. Izuku wasn't very picky with food (with the exception of his protein bars, sadly), happily eating whatever he cooked, rarely ever making requests on what he'd like for a meal.

(The one time he did ask for something, it had been tamagoyaki, something so synonymous with 'traditional breakfast', that he didn't count it as an actual request, not really.)

It was hard to judge what could be his favorite meal because of this. Though it was a bit sad because Izuku had to start all over again to find what he liked, but at the same time, Shouta felt a bit relieved. He couldn't imagine what raw rat or pigeon meat tasted like, and he was glad Izuku didn't have to know either.

"It's one of Hizashi's favorite foods, so I was planning on making some on his birthday," He said as settled his capture weapon over his shoulders, "Do you want to help out?"

"Yes!"

His offer was immediately accepted, the sheer excitement from Izuku palpable. He couldn't help but to smile at the eagerness shown.

"Alright, I'll let you know when," He stood, taking the tote bag from the hook on the wall, placing their bottles into it, "Come on, let's go."

And they were off, holding hands once they reached the streets.

Shouta already had an idea of where to go.

There was a mall within walking distance and it seemed perfect for what Izuku wanted. It wasn’t a place he visited often, but he remembered that it hosted a wide variety of shops. Surely there would be something that Izuku would take a liking to for Hizashi. And while they were there, he would be able to get some reconnaissance done as well. Izuku would have the chance to find something for Hizashi, and he’d have the chance to see what Izuku would linger his eyes on, to figure out what to get for Izuku’s own birthday.

However, malls were notorious for being busy and full of people, both of which he knew Izuku didn’t enjoy. When he had brought that up to Izuku, he had been very politely told that it didn’t matter. That Hizashi’s birthday present was more important and that he wanted to get something for him even if there were many people around.

It warmed his heart to know that Izuku was willing to face something he didn’t like for Hizashi, but it also made him worry. Izuku clearly seemed to think that his potential discomfort was of less importance than some material item that could be purchased any day of the year or even online. He would need to keep an eye out for self-esteem issues in the future. For now, he let Izuku know that his feelings and opinions were equally, if not more, important as well and if he felt too uncomfortable, then they would leave and go somewhere less busy for shopping. Izuku had stared at him with wide eyes as he spoke, but had agreed in the end, thankfully.

By the time they had arrived at the mall, Izuku was clinging to his hand, though his eyes were taking in everything around him.

“We’re here,” He said, “Do you have someplace you’d like to start?”

Izuku tapped his hand.

‘No.’

Well, it seemed that they’d be here a while.

The mall was big.

There were so many stores that he could see even from where they were standing. Aizawa-san had walked them in and they were suddenly surrounded by sounds. It was a lot louder inside than outside.

Aizawa-san kneeled down next to him, pulling out one end of his capture scarf and looped it around his wrist once, twice, and then a third time before tying a neat knot. He glanced at the cloth around his wrist, confused, but he also knew Aizawa-san didn’t do anything without a reason, so he waited for him to speak.

“The mall is a busy place with a lot of people,” Aizawa-san started speaking right on cue, “I don’t want either of us getting lost in here, so this will help us stay together, alright?”

That made sense, so he nodded. It honestly made him feel safer, the soft material of the scarf snug around his wrist giving him a reminder that Aizawa-san would always be nearby.

“Can I still hold your hand?”

He reached out to hold the now-standing Aizawa-san’s hand, looking up at him as he asked.

“Sure, kid.”

With their hands now held, they finally started to explore the mall.

There were lots of stores, many selling different things. Stores selling clothes, though, were the ones he saw the most of. Everything was so colorful in them and he liked seeing all the different designs they offered. However, there was nothing that he saw so far that immediately took his attention in a ‘this would be perfect for Yamada-san’ sort of way.

Aizawa-san didn't seem too interested in shopping, though he did turn to look at things he pointed out as they walked past that he thought were fun or interesting. So far, they had seen a coffee mug in the shape of All Might’s head (it was like drinking his brains!), a whole bunch of shirts that had the name of other types of clothing on them (Aizawa-san had read them to him one by one; they were funny!), and even a life-sized figurine of a pro hero he didn’t recognize (Aizawa-san had called him the Killer Whale Hero: Gang Orca; Izuku thought he could probably eat owls like him for breakfast, if he ate owls at least).

Then they stopped at a store that sold party supplies. And there were so many party-related things inside despite it looking very small from the outside. Party hats of all kinds (there was even a whole shelf of party hats in the patterns of All Might’s different costumes!), lots of banners and streamers, and best of all, so many balloons.

He wasn’t interested in the ones that just said ‘congratulations’ or ‘happy birthday’, though they did look nice. The ones he was interested in were the ones right behind the counter the cashier was, taking up the entire wall with bright colors.

Balloons of pro heroes.

Well, not the entire pro hero.

It was just their heads.

But they were still really cool-looking and he couldn’t help but to stop and stare at all of them, only looking away when he felt a small tug on his hand as Aizawa-san kept walking deeper into the store. Aizawa-san must have felt the same tug on his side because he paused to turn back to look at him.

“Izuku?”

“I was looking at the balloons,” He admitted sheepishly, “Sorry.”

“Let’s go get what we need first,” Aizawa-san pointed back in the direction he was headed to, “And then we can both look at the balloons while we wait to pay, alright?”

Nodding, he returned back to Aizawa-san’s side, content in knowing that he would get to see the balloons again soon. And with Aizawa-san looking at them with him, he could help him identify the ones that he didn’t recognize at first glance.

Aizawa-san stopped at a shelf of candles.

There were so many candles and in every single color he could think of! There were even ones that had the colors of All Might’s costume, though he was less surprised by those. Everything in stores had an All Might-colored variant. If they didn’t, then they probably would soon.

Seeing those still-familiar bright colors of the Number One hero reminded him of the days where he would go shopping with his Mama, always keeping his eyes out for all things All Might. Nowadays, when he went shopping, there was much less of that. Yamada-san was usually chatting with him, telling him funny stories about work, and those were much more interesting than counting each and every All Might-related thing he saw.

He watched as Aizawa-san picked out three candles, the dark orange and white stripes making him think of Present Mic’s glasses.

“Izuku,” Aizawa-san called out his name even as he tugged him closer to the shelf, “Which ones do you like? You can choose any eight you want to have on your cake.”

“I’m getting a cake?” Izuku couldn’t stop the words from leaving his mouth, backpedaling to revise what he said; he didn’t want to appear ungrateful, “I mean, thank you. For getting me a cake.”

Aizawa-san looked down at him; Izuku could see a flash of something sad in his eyes, though it was gone as quickly as it had appeared. He hoped he didn't make him sad with what he said.

"It'll be your birthday," Aizawa-san let go of his hand, only to place it gently on his head, ruffling his hair, "Do you want a cake for your birthday?"

He nodded vigorously.

Cake was a must for a birthday. Every single birthday he remembered had cakes. Kacchan's birthday cake had been made in the shape of All Might’s head even, and decorated the same way.

"Then you'll have cake."

Aizawa-san confirmed, giving him those kind eyes that he always did. Izuku felt warm and gooey on the inside seeing that.

"Now let's get your candles picked out, Izuku," Aizawa-san’s hand left his head, dropping to his shoulder, "And then we can go look at the balloons."

Izuku looked up at the shelf of candles, already knowing which ones he wanted. He picked out an equal amount of both the yellow and black candles. Four yellow and four black.

"Interesting choices," Aizawa-san held a small paper bag out to him, the striped candles he picked out already inside, "Do you like bees?"

"I've never eaten a bee before, Aizawa-san," He replied as he placed his candles into the bag, another question coming to mind as he did so, "Why does Yamada-san only get three candles?" It didn't make any sense. "He's not turning three."

"Because if I tried to put all the candles for how old he's turning this year," Aizawa-san said as reached for his hand again, leading him back to the front of the store, "his cake would be full of holes." He paused with a frown before continuing, "Also, please don't eat bees."

He wasn't sure bees tasted good anyways, so he nodded his agreement.

“How old is Yamada-san turning?”

It must be a really big number if it would pull lots of holes in a cake.

“He’s turning twenty-three this year.”

Izuku could feel his eyes widen.

Twenty-three?

That was more fingers and toes that he had altogether!

“That’s a big number,” He murmured, eyes already wandering to the balloons on display, “It's bigger than twenty.”

“Three more than twenty, yes,” Aizawa-san confirmed with a nod, “Actually, why don’t you tell Hizashi all this later?” He dipped his chin into his scarf, voice getting a bit muffled, “I’m sure he’d be more than happy to know your thoughts on his age.”

He gave Aizawa-san an absentminded nod, his full attention now taken by all the balloons he could see. Ignoring all the All Might balloons at the top, he immediately pointed out the one that held his interest.

“It’s Present Mic.”

Aizawa-san looked up at where his finger was pointing.

“And so it is,” There was a bit of amusement in Aizawa-san’s tone, “Can you identify any others?”

Izuku nodded, pointing out the others that he could name.

“Endeavor.”

His fire moustache was very recognizable.

“Best Jeanist.”

Yamada-san thought he was cool, and therefore, he was worth remembering.

“Ecto-plasm.”

It was Ecto-san from U.A.!

“Gang Orca.”

The memory of the large and tall figurine was still fresh in his memory, along with Aizawa-san’s insistence that the pro hero didn’t eat owls for breakfast, nor did he for any other meal.

“And Ingenium.”

That was Iida-san when he was all dressed up for work.

“Good job, Izuku,” Aizawa-san praised and Izuku could feel his face warming at his words, “You got those all correct.”

“Your son’s so smart,” An unfamiliar voice chimed in, “A big hero fan, huh?”

Izuku swung his head to look up to a stranger beaming at him. He shrunk into Aizawa-san’s side, uncomfortable with how close they were.

“Yes, he’s a fan,” Aizawa-san turned to speak to the stranger, though Izuku could pick up on the hint of irritation lacing his voice. That tone was gone from his next word, replaced with something much warmer, “I’m very proud of him.”

It was happening again.

Aizawa-san was always one to be straightforward with his words, so why was this happening?

Izuku knew how things worked in this world.

Even if there were things someone wanted, they couldn’t always get them.

His quirk, even his quirk, which he had wanted for such a long time, he had gone through terrible things to get it. Aizawa-san had said that to him. That he had gone through trauma, that he had been hurt so very badly, and that he wanted him, above all else, to experience a happy childhood with them.

Living with Aizawa-san and Yamada-san, it was so much more than he ever expected, but he didn’t think he could take it if they kept implying that he was their son.

Because to be their son, that meant that they had to be his dads!

Didn't they know that?

He didn't even know if that was something they wanted!

It was something he wanted, but that wasn't the point here.

Izuku shuffled his feet forward as Aizawa-san made his way closer to the cash register, not wanting to get separated from him. He could hear voices still talking above him but he paid no attention to them; what he was trying to figure out was much more important.

Because if Aizawa-san also saw him like this, saw him as his son, did that mean he was saying that he wanted to be his dad?

That they both wanted to be his dads?

Aizawa-san and Yamada-san were both very smart people, so they had to know what they were doing here.

But they were also both kind people.

Him being their son, it wouldn't be something they would joke about.

They loved him.

They both did.

Izuku knew they did.

"Izuku," Aizawa-san interrupted his thoughts, murmuring his name as he led him out of the store, the candles probably already put away in his bag, though there was a ribbon held in one of his hands, "Let me have your free wrist for a bit?"

He held his other arm out to him, curious what he planned on doing.

Aizawa-san lowered himself down into a crouch, gently tying the ribbon around his wrist. He gave it a small tug and then a nod when it didn't unravel, and then stood up again, letting his hold of the ribbon go.

"What do you think?"

Izuku looked up at the balloon that the ribbon was attached to.

"You got me a Present Mic balloon?"

"Well, I didn't get it for Hizashi," Aizawa-san chuckled, "Do you like it?"

"I love it," And he did! Balloon Present Mic's smile looked a bit funny from where he was looking at it, but he loved it all the same, "Thank you, Aizawa-san!"

“I’m glad,” A hand was offered to him, “Let’s keep going, shall we?”

Izuku took it, knowing the lingering warmness he was feeling was not from the hoodie he was wearing, nor from the hot summer sun.

They continued to walk, hand in hand, with his new balloon bobbing along next to them.

It was nice.

Chapter Text

Izuku enjoyed clothing stores.

But it felt as if there was a never-ending amount of clothing stores that they could visit.

Seeing all the different types of clothes they had on display, some of the mannequins modeling out scenarios that would require spe-cia-lized clothing, like for extra limbs or different body types was interesting. Nedzu-san probably went to stores like these for his clothes; he didn’t think most pants had holes allowing for tails. Though he probably could just cut a hole in with scissors if he really wanted to, probably.

The toy stores were also really fun to walk through. He didn’t think Yamada-san would want something from a toy store, but he was glad that Aizawa-san had insisted they enter them anyway. ‘Best to keep all options open’, was what he said.

As they turned to walk down the next aisle, he gasped.

Pro heroes!

The entire aisle was full of all of the hero merchandise he could ever think of. Figurines, plushies, and bobbleheads were only a few he could identify right away. There were even bouncy balls in a large wire basket, each one decorated with the details of a pro hero’s head.

Aizawa-san started leading him down the aisle slowly, taking his time, even looking at the merchandise himself sometimes. That was fine by him; it gave him more time to marvel at all the different sorts of merchandise that had come out since his last visit to a toy store.

There was an enormous amount of new All Might merchandise, but that wasn’t what he was really interested in. He wanted to see if there was any for Present Mic. Aizawa-san had told him early on that Eraserhead wasn’t the sort of hero that got any merch, but Present Mic wasn’t an underground hero. His existence didn’t need to be kept a secret. He had his small collection of Put Your Hands Up Radio shirts at home and now this new balloon to prove that.

He just really wanted to see a Present Mic figurine.

Step by step, they made their way down the aisle, pausing every so often whenever he stopped to ask questions about a pro hero he hadn’t seen before.

Then it occurred to him that this would be a good opportunity to ask that question.

Just thinking about it made him feel colder, faced with the possibility that he was wrong, that while Aizawa-san and Yamada-san loved him, it just wasn’t in the way he was thinking of. It made him aware of how sweaty his hand must be by now, made him aware of his smaller steps, and how annoyed Aizawa-san could be, having to adjust to how slow his short legs walked.

“Izuku?” Aizawa-san’s voice washed over him, concerned, “You’ve been staring at that life-sized All Might doll for a while now.”

He blinked to see, indeed, he was staring in the direction of one of the many All Mights dolls stacked vertically together in a wire cage. Weird. They looked like they were being jailed for some reason.

But just who would want that big of an All Might?

Where would they even put it?

As he and Aizawa-san passed the All Mights in the cage, someone else strode past them. Izuku watched as the vaguely familiar tall man with glasses picked up one of the life-sized All Might dolls, tucked it under his arm and then continued walking, disappearing around the corner as fast as he had appeared.

They must like All Might… a lot, Izuku figured.

And have a big room.

Wow.

Aizawa-san had an odd expression on his face even as he blankly stared at the corner where that man had gone.

“Do you know him?” He asked, “You look like you recognized him.”

“I know of him,” Aizawa-san shrugged, returning his focus to the toys around them, “We haven’t met in an official capacity though.” He then redirected his gaze down to him again, “And what about you? Do you…want one too?”

“No!” He blurted out and then repeated just to make it very clear, “No.”

The sharp edge of Aizawa-san’s grin was visible from even behind his scarf.

“But if it were Present Mic,” He raised an eyebrow, “It’d be a different story, wouldn’t it?”

Izuku knew he was pouting as he tried to drag Aizawa-san forward away from all the All Mights in a huff, feeling their blue dotted stares even as he turned his back towards them.

Aizawa-san was teasing him; that meant he was in a good mood.

It really was now or never.

Izuku didn’t know if he’d ever stumble on such a good opportunity to ask.

“Aizawa-san?” He could hear Aizawa-san acknowledge him with a hum, the light amusement still clearly visible in his eyes, “Can I ask you something?”

"Anything."

"You can't get mad at me though, okay?" He needed to make sure of this, knowing he'd never be able to take this question back. He would never be able to forgive himself if he ruined a relationship that he cared about so much, "Promise."

"Izuku," Aizawa-san said softly, "I will never be mad at you for asking questions."

“You’re sure?”

“Yes.”

Izuku took a deep breath, pushing down his nerves the best he could.

He had to know.

This was the only way to know for sure.

“Are you and Yamada-san…”

No, that wasn’t the right way to ask this; he tried again

“When you and Yamada-san…”

He could feel his hands tremble, even as the rest of the question left his mouth.

“When you and Yamada-san say I’m your son, like to other people, do you really mean it?”

Shouta’s breath hitched.

His brain was racing to figure out the implications of Izuku’s question.

Did Izuku hate it?


… Did he want them to stop?

Something tugged painfully in his heart at the thought of that.

If Izuku did feel uncomfortable with them referring to him as their ‘son’, they’d stop, no doubt about it. It didn’t mean that it wouldn’t hurt though. To him and Hizashi, Izuku really was their son in all but name. And that last bit was subject to change in the future as well. He had no doubt that when the opportunity arose for them to adopt Izuku, Hizashi would steamroll him to ask Izuku to take their name, and become a family even in the eyes of the law.

He crouched, making sure his bag didn’t hit the floor as he did so, the line of Izuku’s gaze following him all the while. This wasn’t a conversation he really wanted to have in the middle of a toy store, but it made no difference in the end.

Calm.

Patience.

Shouta knew he couldn’t allow himself to jump to conclusions.

All he could do was answer the question given to him and do his best to make Izuku comfortable.

“Yes,” Izuku’s eyes went wide, “We mean every single word of it.” He forced his tone to stay even as he continued to speak. “I understand if it makes you feel… uncomfortable. We can stop, if you’d like us to.”

“No, Aizawa-san,” Shouta couldn’t stop himself from blinking at the soft reply, relief pouring into his chest knowing his initial assumption had been wrong, “I… I like it, I just…”

Izuku trailed off, his voice getting lower as each word passed his lips, until they were barely audible. Shouta didn't push him, knowing that it would only serve to put unneeded stress onto those shoulders.

"You know, right?" There was a tremble in Izuku's voice when he spoke up again, "That if I'm your son, and if I'm Yamada-san's son too, then you both have to be my dads."

And there it was.

The crux of Izuku’s issue.

“Do you.. not want us to be your dads?”

“I want it!” Izuku cried out, voice alarmed, “I do, but only if…” His eyes were starting to shine with tears, and Shouta couldn’t pull out the emergency stash of tissues he now kept in his pocket fast enough, “Only if you wanna be my dads too.”

He pressed the tissues into Izuku’s hands, clasping them within his own for a quick squeeze before allowing them to drop again. The eventual adoption was something he had planned to keep quiet about, wanting it to be a surprise, but it wasn’t worth Izuku’s ongoing worry about his status in their family.

“Do you know what ‘adoption’ is?”

A small shake of the head.

“It’s when a person legally takes someone in to care for them as their own.” Izuku’s eyebrows scrunched up, “Hizashi and I have been wanting to adopt you ever since you started living with us.”

“What’s the difference between a-dop-tion and fostering?” Small hands grasped his sleeve, “They’re not the same?”

“Well fostering is usually a temporary thing,” A confused expression flitted across Izuku’s face, “It’s not a forever home.” He clarified before continuing, “The aim of adoption is the opposite of that.”

Shouta could practically see the gears in Izuku’s head working, trying to understand what he was saying. Seconds passed in silence until green eyes suddenly widened in what he hoped to be realization.

“You wanna keep me forever?” Izuku then warbled out, voice now thick with tears, “Forever is a long time, Aizawa-san.”

“That’s what adoption is,” He confirmed with a small nod, “A promise from the adoptive parents to take care of and love a child forever.”

“But won’t you get bored of me?”

“It would be illogical to,” Shaking his head, he admitted something he had kept close to his heart, “Hizashi and I already can’t imagine our future together without you also there with us.”

“If you… If you adopt me, then you’ll be my dads forever?”

“Both of us, yes.”

“What changes after that?”

That was right.

Izuku was wary of sudden change.

“Not much will change on the surface,” He quickly reassured him, “But, you’ll get the opportunity to take our family name if you’d like.”

“Your name?” Izuku said with an incredulous tone in his voice, “I can change my name?”

“Aizawa Izuku,” He couldn’t help the smile that broke out on his lips, “How does that sound to you?”

"Aizawa Izuku…" The name was slowly repeated, though a small confused frown took over Izuku’s face as he sniffled out, "Not Yamada Izuku?"

"Well, Hizashi took my name when we got married," He gave a loose shrug as he explained, "Legally, he's Aizawa Hizashi."

"Should I have been calling him Aizawa-san too?" Izuku looked alarmed, even as he wiped at his tears with a tissue, "Is he mad at me?"

"He was the one who introduced himself to you using Yamada," Shouta pointed out, "And he still uses his former surname for most public appearances." He lifted a finger to his lip, making a small shushing sound, “Hizashi’s real name is a secret though, for safety concerns, okay?”

Izuku quickly nodded, bright eyes shining with determination. And Shouta felt soft in this private moment between himself and Izuku, despite the fact that they were surrounded by an innumerable amount of hero merchandise with beady little eyes. He couldn’t help the small fond smile that he directed at his son.

His son.

Their son.

Izuku actually wanted to be their son.

How amazing was that?

It was true that he had already had an inkling of this distinct possibility, but to have it blossom into fruition right in front of him, it truly was something special. Hizashi’s upcoming birthday only made it feel all the more real. Nedzu had certainly seemed confident enough that he would be able to get things done. And while he usually hated having to bow to the whims of his old teacher, he was definitely capable of swallowing his pride for this, especially if it was for Izuku.

“Good,” He hummed, making a mental note that he’d need to remember to use his quirk liberally when Hizashi found out about all of this; he didn’t want to go window pane shopping or get a noise complaint, thanks, “Now, do you have any other questions?”

“Just two more, if that’s okay?”

“Go ahead, Izuku.”

“When are you gonna do it?” He tilted his head, the tears in his eyes finally all gone and dried, though they were now rimmed with red, “I mean the adoption.”

“As soon as Hizashi and I get approved to adopt,” Or however fast Nedzu could move their paperwork forward, which he didn’t know anything about, nothing at all, obviously, “It shouldn’t take too long.”

“So you’ll be my real dads soon?”

“In the eyes of the law, yes,” He didn’t even want to know how sappy he looked right now; it was good that Izuku didn't seem to have a clue about his general reputation or else he could say goodbye to his carefully crafted image as an unsocial man with no attachments, “But Hizashi and I have seen you as our son for a good while now. This is just putting it all on paper so everyone else can know, and the name change itself is just a bonus.”

Ai-za-wa I-zu-ku

Shouta watched as Izuku mouthed the syllables of the new name that he had offered up just a few minutes ago, eyes luminous with both surprise and delight.

It did sound nice, didn’t it?

Less fun to write, but he had all the confidence in Izuku to learn. And…it would be nice to teach Izuku how to write his new family name. If Hizashi didn’t get there first, at least.

"Your other question?"

Not that he wanted to rush him, but the location of this heart-to-heart really wasn't one he enjoyed. It was just that he still didn't know what to purchase for Izuku's birthday yet; and Izuku hadn't chosen anything for Hizashi's birthday either. He would prefer if they could get all the shopping done today if possible, though it was seeming more and more unlikely.

“Do you…” Izuku now looked slightly hesitant as he spoke up, only continuing when he gave him an encouraging nod, “Do you want me to call you dad now?”

Dad.

Hearing it again from Izuku made him feel all warm inside, like when Hizashi brought home Chinese takeout for those nights where they were both too busy to cook, always making sure to get a double order of his favorite spring rolls along with his sesame chicken dinner set.

"Only if you want to."

Because as much as he would love being called 'dad', it would be an undoubtable big change for Izuku. The same Izuku who had switched back to calling him 'Aizawa-san' once he had seen him, despite calling him his 'dad' mere minutes before that.

It was alright though.

He didn't need to be called 'dad' to know he was Izuku's dad.

"I want to," Izuku averted his eyes, cheeks flushed, "But I don't know if I can right away."

"Take your time, okay?" It was enough to know that he wanted to call him that, "You don't need to rush yourself." His heart felt full right now and it was just as well that Izuku couldn’t call him dad to his face right now; he wasn’t sure if he’d have a Hizashi-like reaction to it or not, "We can wait."

Izuku gave him a nod, an uncertain one, but an acknowledgement, regardless.

“And do you feel comfortable if we refer to you as our son in the meantime?”

A much quicker nod, this one full of vigorous eagerness.

“Alright, so is that all the questions you have for me?”

“Mhm.”

“Then let’s get some more shopping done then, yeah?”

He reached out to give a quick ruffle to Izuku’s hair before standing up, a grunt leaving his lips as he straightened up. Reorienting himself and tugging his tote bag up so it wouldn’t slip off his shoulders, he barely noticed Izuku get closer until he felt small arms around his waist.

“Thank you for wanting to be my dad.”

It was mumbled, and well, they were in a toy store with cheery All Might commercial music blaring from speakers. Shouta was an underground hero though, adept at picking up the most minute of voices, even if it was overlaid with some advertisement for some pro hero branded cereal. He heard him just fine.

As quick as the hug was given, Izuku let go, then speed-walked further down the aisle, Balloon Mic bobbing alongside his small figure, leaving him speechless and staring.

He wanted to feel angry.

Angry that Izuku felt that he had to thank him for wanting to be his father, no doubt due to Midoriya Hisashi ruining his sense of self worth.

But he couldn’t.

That man was no longer a part of Izuku’s life and he wasn’t about to invite more strife into it, not when they had finally just established that Izuku wanted to be their son.

Tsukauchi had mentioned the last time they spoke that the man had likely gone underground, taking his assets with him once he liquidated them down. That there had been no reports of unsolved arson near Shizuoka prefecture, with most of the fires caused being accidental in nature in the last year.

There had even been an entire fire safety education motion implemented in schools around the time Izuku had first started living as an owl, spearheaded by the current number two hero, Endeavor.

Irony at its best.

Shouta followed the length of his capture weapon, collecting it up in his hand as he walked, knowing that the end of it would lead him to where he needed to be. He was glad he had thought to leave the other end of it with Izuku. Not that he had expected Izuku to leave his side in the first place, but it was a precaution for a possibility that might, and did eventually happen.

By the time he had caught up with Izuku and settled the collected length of his weapon back around his shoulders, he had managed to calm his heart rate and wipe away the soppy smile on his face.

Izuku was standing by a large tub of toys, his Present Mic balloon floating by his side, hands holding a boxed figurine. It sort of looked like Hizashi, if he squinted.

“Aizawa-san?” He looked up at his arrival, holding the box up to him, “This doesn’t say Present Mic.”

“It doesn’t,” Shouta agreed, “It says his name is Real Mick.”

“It looks like Present Mic though,” Izuku turned the box around, confused and looking up at his balloon, “Is it a fake Present Mic toy?”

“Probably.”

He’d have to tell Hizashi that his hero persona was getting well known enough for some company to produce a knock-off figurine of him. Hizashi would definitely be delighted at the news.

“Can we get Real Mick?”

“For Hizashi?”

“For me.”

Shouta could only stare at the plastic smile that Real Mick wore, shifting his gaze to an expectant Izuku.

“If you want something here, why not an authentic Present Mic figurine?”

“Silly Aizawa-san,” Izuku spoke in a frank tone even as he raised an eyebrow, “We have an authentic Present Mic at home.”

…

He wasn't wrong.

Arguably, they had the most authentic of Present Mics at home.

"So can we?"

"Sure."

Izuku beamed at him and Shouta found himself thinking he'd purchase one hundred Real Micks if Izuku could live out a carefree childhood smiling like this every day.


Illogical.

What would they even do with one hundred Real Micks?

"By the way," He quickly changed the subject, not wanting to even think about that many Real Micks in the same space as he was, "Have you seen anything you want to get for Hizashi yet?"

That had been the whole point of this expedition after all. Not that it hadn't been an earth-shattering experience so far even without any birthday gift purchases.

"Nothing seems right for him so far," Izuku grumbled even as he switched Real Mick to his other hand to take the hand he offered him, "I wanna find him the perfect present."

"Let's go look in some other shops after we pay, alright?" He led Izuku to the front of the store, infinitely glad the man they had seen earlier was not there, "There are still many shops we haven't visited yet."

"We've gone into so many already though…"

And didn't he know it?

"Or maybe I could catch a rat and you could cook it for him?" Izuku suggested, "You could fry it with the chicken!" He looked excited; it was too bad Shouta knew he would have to deny this particular request, "Does that count as a birthday present?"

"Sorry, Izuku," He injected an apologetic tone into his voice; may Hizashi never find out about the fried rat that Izuku wanted to give him for his birthday, "Hizashi doesn't eat rats."

"He doesn't?!" Shouta wanted to laugh at the shocked expression on Izuku's face, but managed to keep his amusement to himself, “But why not?”

“Most people don’t,” He quickly paid for the Real Mick, ignoring the horrified face of the cashier who was obviously listening to their conversation, “There are much better sources of protein out there that could be gotten with less effort.” Refusing the offer for a plastic bag, he took the box and placed it into his tote bag, leading Izuku out of the store. He never wanted to go back there again, “Plus, humans can get diseases from consuming rats, especially the ones that live and feed in the city.”

“Are di-sea-ses bad?”

“Yes, they are.”

“Oh.”

Izuku’s eyebrows were scrunched up as he started to mumble under his breath. Shouta just hoped this would be the possible end of Izuku trying to get either of them to have rats for a meal. He really did appreciate that Izuku wanted to share his experiences with them, but he wasn't going to put a rat in any of his pots or pans. Ever.

"I don't think I have any diseases though?" Izuku voiced, confused, "I ate rats almost every day."

"Owls have adapted a stronger stomach acid for these types of things," Or at least that's what the internet had told him when he had done some quick research a while back, "Please don't try eating them as a human, okay?"

The conversation he would need to have with Izuku about not eating any city rats at all would have to come at a later date. Izuku had gotten extremely lucky that none of the rats he had hunted down for meals had ingested rat poison, but they couldn't count on that luck forever. Just thinking about the consequences of that made him feel queasy.

"No rats as a human," Izuku nodded, "I promise."

"Thank you."

It was one less thing to have to worry about now.

They walked in silence together past a clothing store, a shoe store, and also a jewelry store before Izuku spoke up again.

"Aizawa-san?"

"Hm?"

"Do you think…" A note of uncertainty entered Izuku's voice, "Do you think Yamada-san will even like what I choose for his present?"

"You could probably give him a rock you picked up from a playground and he'd be over the moon you thought of him."

"I don't wanna get him a rock though!" Izuku grumbled, knocking his shoulder into him, "Yamada-san is super nice so he deserves a super nice present."

"Why don't you draw him something?"

"Like a picture?"

"Like a birthday card."

Izuku looked like he was thinking about it, eyes losing focus even as he hummed.

"I think… I wanna do that," He looked up at him, "Is that okay?"

"Of course it is."

"Can we go home now then?"

"Nothing else you want to get?"

"Actually…" Izuku tapped his chin, the balloon moving as he did so, "Can we get nice paper for the card?"

"Sure."

"We have markers at home already…"

Izuku continued to mumble under his breath about what supplies they already had at home, raising his voice when he thought of something they didn't have yet.

Shouta listened to him as he directed them to the nearest stationary shop.

This trip wouldn't be a bust after all.

Though they hadn't found an actual gift for Hizashi, Izuku now knew what he wanted to do for his birthday.

And just the knowledge that Izuku was alright with them acknowledging him as their son, that was a gift in and of itself.

He'd classify this entire outing as a success.

Izuku offered him a smile as he propped open the door for him, allowing him to enter with his balloon first.

A wild success.

Chapter Text

Today was Yamada-san’s birthday.

Izuku could barely sleep the previous night, so nervous he was about giving Yamada-san the card he had drawn for him.

Because what if he didn’t like it?

What if he thought it was a waste of paper?

It would be okay, he had told himself before laying himself down again in bed.

He had a backup plan if Yamada-san didn’t like his card.

And he was sure Yamada-san would like his backup present.

Despite all his nerves though, he woke up bright and early, so full of energy that Aizawa-san had given him an odd look while he was making breakfast.

They were having blueberry pancakes with a side of scrambled eggs for breakfast for Yamada-san’s special day. His pancakes had a drizzle of honey zig-zagged on top while Yamada-san went with maple syrup for his. Aizawa-san only put an extra square of butter on his own, allowing it to melt down before cutting into them.

All the pancakes were delicious though.

Izuku knew this because he had a small piece from both Aizawa-san and Yamada-san’s plates, trading a forkful of his for theirs. They both said he didn’t have to, but it felt wrong to just take from them! What if they got hungry later because they didn’t have enough breakfast? Then he'd feel awful!

Yamada-san being hungry on his own birthday was a sad thing to think about, especially if it was because of him and his desire to try the pancakes soaked in maple syrup.

When they had all finished eating, he had followed Yamada-san to the living room while Aizawa-san stayed behind in the kitchen to wash the dishes. Usually he would try to help with bringing the plates and utensils to the sink, but Aizawa-san had shooed him out of the kitchen today and told him to keep Yamada-san distracted instead.

"Hizashi has the whole day off today, you know?" Aizawa-san had said, "I'm sure he'd enjoy spending some of that time with you going over that list you created just for today."

It was true that Yamada-san always seemed to enjoy the time they spent together, his eyes going as soft as his voice like when he sang to him about smiles, sunshine, and happiness.

He really enjoyed spending time with Yamada-san too.

It made him feel warm inside.

As the days had passed after his and Aizawa-san’s shopping trip to the mall, he found himself thinking more and more about his new parents.

Because that was what they were, his parents.

He had told Aizawa-san he wasn't ready to call them 'dad' and that was true, in a way.

The words weren't the problem.

He knew he wanted to call Aizawa-san his Dad and Yamada-san his Papa.

If his room's mirror could talk, it would be able to tell others that he had practiced saying 'Dad' and 'Papa' in front of it very very quietly so no one else would be able to overhear him. Once he left his room though, once he was looking at the actual Aizawa-san and Yamada-san, it became much more difficult to say.

It was worrying.

What if he could never say it to their face?

What if because he had gotten so used to never using those types of words in conversation, he would never be able to use them comfortably without hazy memories of disapproving orange eyes?

He had thought it would be fine at first.

'Dad' and 'Papa' weren't 'Father'.

And Aizawa-san had said he'd like to be called 'Dad', later even promising to him that Yamada-san would love hearing it from him as well.

People actually wanting to be his dad was just so new to him, and though he trusted Aizawa-san and Yamada-san to be his parents now, it didn’t make it easier for the words to leave his lips.

“So, ‘Zuku!” Yamada-san called out to him from where he was already sitting on the couch, “Got any plans for today?”

“Mhm,” He nodded, “Aizawa-san says I need to be your distraction so he can set up for your party in peace.”

“Oh, did he now?”

“Uh huh,” Izuku nodded again, “He says it’s your special day, so you shouldn’t have to do any work.”

“That’s sweet of him,” Yamada-san looked amused, eyes twinkling, “And what were your plans for distracting me?”

“I made a list!” He pointed at Yamada-san, “Stay there! I’ll be right back!”

Rushing to his room, he picked up the list that was laying on his new desk. He had worked with Aizawa-san yesterday to create this list while Yamada-san was at the radio station. Most of the ideas there were his, though he did let Aizawa-san put an idea or two down. He had helped him with the actual words after all, making sure that what he wrote down was able to be read easily.

Before he left to go back to the living room, he paused at the door knob. The Present Mic balloon that Aizawa-san had bought for him was tied to it. It had been a few days since it had come home with him, though now it didn’t look as great or as full of air. He had known that balloons would eventually lose air, but it was still a bit sad to see.

He wondered if Aizawa-san would be able to blow more air into it for him while he and Yamada-san tried to complete his list?

He would have to ask him.

Izuku left his room with his list in hand, gently closing the door behind him. Yamada-san was where he had left him, greeting him with a smile when he returned.

"Is that your list?" Yamada-san asked as he scooted the couch pillows away to make room for him, "How many things are on it?"

Izuku silently passed him the list as he claimed his seat on the couch, climbing onto it and leaning his body against Yamada-san’s next to him.

Yamada-san started to read out loud.

    Izuku's List for Yamada-san’s Birthday

    - Find the biggest lemon in the world
    - Climb a tree
    - Find some cool rocks
    - Chase the pigeons at the park
    - Buy a yummy lunch and eat it together at the park too
    - Find a cloud shaped like Present Mic
    - Buy fresh cucumbers, lemons, cabbage, mayonnaise — bring home


"I dunno about finding the biggest lemon in the world, 'Zuku…" Yamada-san chuckled, "Let's try to stick to our neighborhood, yeah?"

He supposed that made more sense; it would be really hard to travel to another country to see what types of lemons they had there. If they went too far, they might even miss celebrating Yamada-san’s birthday with everyone else!

"Yeah, okay," He got off the couch to grab one of the pens that was laying on the coffee table, "I'll change it so it can be our neighborhood instead."

Yamada-san handed his list back to him and Izuku crossed out 'the world', quickly realizing he didn't know how to write 'neighborhood' yet.

There was only one solution here.

Aizawa-san was still busy with the dishes and Yamada-san was not. Plus, he was supposed to be a distraction today, so this worked out fine.

He pulled out one of the pieces of scrap paper that they kept on the bottom level of the coffee table, offering it and his pen to Yamada-san.

"Can you write 'neighborhood' for me please?"

"Of course, 'Zuku!"

Watching as Yamada-san wrote neatly, he did his best to memorize the order of the strokes used and then follow that exact order while copying it onto his list. He was pretty sure he didn't do it correctly, but it looked okay and when showing the results to Yamada-san, he gave him an approving smile.

"Your writing's gotten so neat!" He praised, giving his hair a quick ruffle, "All that practice you do is paying off!"

“I practiced a lot,” Izuku could feel his cheeks warm at the kind words directed at him, “I wanna write pretty like you.”

“You’re such a sweetheart, ‘Zuku,” Yamada-san cooed, hands reaching out to squish his cheeks. It was Yamada-san’s birthday, so just for today, he would allow the squishing; he pushed away the warm feelings that told him that he definitely enjoyed all the attention, “Let’s get ready to go out, yeah? We can get an early start!”

He had already gotten dressed right after he woke up in preparation for their trip outside, so while Yamada-san went to his and Aizawa-san’s bedroom to do just that, he went to go see Aizawa-san.

“Aizawa-san?” Stopping by the sink, he made sure not to stand next to Aizawa-san’s elbow; it was very pointy and he didn’t want to get accidentally poked, “If you have time, can you help me blow more air into my Present Mic balloon?”

“I can try,” Aizawa-san glanced over at him, an odd expression on his face, “I don’t think he’d float anymore if I did that though.”

“As long as he’s round and not wrinkly, then it’s okay,” It was a bit sad getting to watch his balloon deflate over the last few days, “But it’s also okay if you can’t, if you’re too busy or somethi—.”

“No, Izuku,” Aizawa-san waved a soapy hand to stop him from continuing, “I’ll do my best to get him back to his usual self. I just can’t promise he’ll look exactly the same as before, alright?”

“Mhm,” If he had to be honest, just about anything would look better than how the balloon looked right now, “We’re gonna go out now, Aizawa-san.” He moved in closer to give Aizawa-san a hug, relishing in his warmth, “Remember, you can’t start frying the chicken without me, okay?”

“C’mon, ‘Zuku!” He could hear Yamada-san yell, “Lemon hunt time!”

“I’ll remember,” Aizawa-san turned back to his dishes, his dishrag back in hand, a hint of strictness in his voice, “You stay safe and don’t wander away from Hizashi while you’re outside, understand?”

“Promise!” He didn’t exactly want to lose Yamada-san out there either, “Have fun decorating!”

Izuku then ran to where he knew Yamada-san was waiting for him, a bag already slung over his shoulder. It probably carried water; both Aizawa-san and Yamada-san always said that staying hy-dra-ted was important.

“We’re off, Shou!”

Yamada-san called as he unlocked their front door, nudging him out once he had gotten his sneakers on.

“I’ll see you two later,” Aizawa-san called back, “Stay safe.”

The door locked behind him with a click, Yamada-san slipping the keys into his pocket.

“Well, let’s go have an adventure, ‘Zuku!”

“Yeah!”

Hizashi hadn’t expected his birthday to go this way.

Of course he knew that this year was going to be different with Izuku now part of their lives.

He knew this!

There would be no more birthday nights hanging out at random bars with Tensei and Nemuri while they recorded a drunk Shouta trying to order food from potted plants instead of actual people. No more stumbling home together in the dead of the morning, only to crash on top of one another on the couch. And definitely no more hungover bleary-eyed mornings cleaning up after themselves and looking for his glasses.

But that wasn’t the problem here.

He had woken up this morning with no expectations except with what he already had been told. That Tensei and Nemuri would be coming over later for an early birthday dinner and that he was not allowed into Izuku’s room until the day was over. He was curious about his temporary ban from Izuku’s room, but he figured it had something to do with his birthday, knowing that they had gone out at least once to go shopping.

That Izuku had wanted a balloon of him, well his hero persona at least, had him grinning days later whenever he thought about it. And there had also been that knock-off figurine of him that Shouta had purchased as well, Izuku having nearly shoved it into his chest in excitement when he had gotten home that night. It was almost disconcerting seeing himself popular enough to have a knock-off figurine, popularity not being something he had really put too much thought about even at the start of his career.

(Real Mick, as Izuku insisted he call the toy by it’s ‘real’ name, was now situated in a place of honor on the bookshelf in Izuku’s room. Going in there to read Izuku a bedtime story was now an experience. It was good that the light from the lamp on his desk didn’t shine far enough for him to see Real Mick staring him down. Because behind those shades, he was sure it was.)

Still, Hizashi was not expecting to be pulled outside to spend a majority of his morning and afternoon at a local park following Izuku around as he picked up just about every single rock they came upon and asked for his opinion on it.

And it was fun at first! But there were only so many adjectives he had in his arsenal that he could use to describe rocks. He was many things, but an aficionado of rocks was definitely not one of them.

However, it was still nice to spend some time together with Izuku.

Even if that time spent included going through a truly ridiculous amount of lemons and having to fetch Izuku off a tree since he had gotten stuck hugging the wide trunk, unable to climb higher or get back down. He had taken it all in stride, more than thankful that his above-average height was enough to help out in that situation and that he wasn’t the one required to climb a tree in the first place.

His reward was a hug, one he was more than happy to receive.

Izuku had gotten a lot more physically affectionate with him ever since that shopping trip, and naturally, Hizashi knew the reason behind this. How could he not when Izuku had dropped the figurative bomb on him over dinner, voice nonchalant as he spooned up a bite of the mild chicken curry that Shouta had made that night and shoved it into his mouth, his words mumbled.

“Aizawa-san says that I can be Aizawa Izuku soon."

Hizashi wasn’t embarrassed to admit that he had cried hearing that; he was an emotional person, one that succumbed to happy tears entirely too easily. His own plate of curry forgotten, he had leapt out of his chair to give Izuku a hug, kneeling so he was able to give him a proper one.

Izuku had allowed him this, patting him on the top of his head, eyes big with emotion. It was only because he had been so close that he had been able to hear Izuku's next words, though he was sure they weren't meant to be heard by him or even Shouta.

"I have two dads now."

Hizashi was a dad now.

He was a dad!

Izuku had acknowledged him as one of his dads!

It thrilled him to know that he was seen that way. Just knowing that he hadn't been dismissed in the favor of Shouta, that was enough.

Those thoughts were what followed him as he continued to trail after Izuku. Izuku had quickly taken point when they started, staying a few steps ahead of him as he picked up rocks. But now, after a good half hour, it felt like he had seen all the rocks this park had to offer. The newest rock he had been shown may as well be the long lost clone sibling of the last twenty rocks that had already been shared with him.

"How about this one?" Izuku held up yet another rock to him, "Do you think this one is cool?"

"I think this one might be the coolest one you've shown me yet, 'Zuku!"

"It's even got legs," Hizashi blinked at Izuku's words, then squinted at the tiny 'rock' he had in his palm, "See?"

And oh, see he did.

Legs.

It was a pill-bug.

Fuck.

He resisted the urge to scream at the sight of all those legs.

It was just one bug, just one!

And a small one at that!

Losing his cool in front of his kid was not in his plans for today! It was his official outing with Izuku where he knew that Izuku thought of him as his dad! He couldn’t let Izuku think he was uncool!

“Buddy,” It was only with the utmost control he managed to keep his voice level and at his usual octave, “Please put that one down.”

“But why?”

“You know how I don’t like b-bugs?”

“Mm.”

“That’s a bug, ‘Zuku,” He gave him a smile, knowing it was crooked and not at all like his usual charming ones, “Just, put it back where you found it, yeah?”

Izuku turned his gaze back at the pill-bug, eyes wide as it wriggled and then curled up into a ball when he tried to roll it around in his palm.

Hizashi could recognize that look in his eyes. It was one he had seen before; it was the exact look Izuku had right before going straight for the heads of their taiyaki.

That could only mean one thing and one thing only.

“And don’t eat it!” He couldn’t help the way his voice pitched into a higher register, the sheer horror of just the thought nearly overtaking him, “Do not eat the fucking bug, Izuku!”

Izuku did not react for a second and then much to his relief, crouched down and tipped the pill-bug out of his hand and back into the dirt.

"Do bugs not taste good, Yamada-san?"

"What."

"Aizawa-san told me to not eat bees the other day and now you're saying I can't eat this one either," Izuku explained matter-of-factly, "So is it 'cause they don't taste good?"

"I've never eaten one," And it was not something he could ever do, "Just, Izuku, think about it." He semi-wished Shouta was here; he'd probably know how to handle this question and situation better than he was doing right now, "These bugs play in the dirt all day. And dirt has all kinds of things in it that can make you sick."

"Like diseases?"

"Like germs and bacteria that can lead to diseases, yeah."

Izuku gave him a slow nod, though he could see his mind still whirring away.

"So, no bugs as a human?"

"No bugs as a human," He confirmed, "Now let's get your hands washed and we can move onto the next thing on the list, okay?"

Even chasing pigeons had to be better than whatever this had turned into.

And he was right.

It was much more exhilarating running after Izuku, who was running after the alarmed birds, occasionally waving his arms to make sure they didn’t fly into his face.

Izuku was making some sort of hybrid screeching and hooting sound from his throat as he ran after them, fingers bared and mouth held in a snarl. The distinct trill of all the wings flapping in warning to the other pigeons seemed to excite Izuku, the pupils of his eyes even dilating in size as he watched them relocate to yet another spot.

(Those eyes kind of reminded him of Mimizuku, in a way. Back when Izuku had been an owl full-time and they had been none-the-wiser of his human identity, Hizashi did waggle pens at him, though his pen caps always eventually got thrown to the floor. There was just a way his eyes looked when he was on a hunt. It wasn’t something he could forget.)

Honestly, it was nice seeing him so animated and running about in the daytime.

Even if the point of this entire outing was for Izuku to be a distraction for him and keep him out of the apartment for most of the day, he couldn’t begrudge all the fun Izuku was having.

He could understand Shouta’s reasoning for this though.

If he had stayed at home, it would have only been a matter of time before he got antsy, wanting to lend a hand or help out with something. And if Shouta hadn’t wanted him inside, then enlisting Izuku’s help really was a surefire way to get him out of the way of his prepping and decorating.

It was funny, he thought as he half-heartedly chased after more pigeons, a small laugh leaving him.

They had never made such a big deal out of a birthday before.

As a matter of fact, they usually worked right through most of it.

No cake, fun, or relaxation.

Just the inevitability of yet another day tomorrow.

He never had an issue with spending his birthdays that way before, but he was finding that yeah, Izuku had to be onto something with his little list. This had to be the most fun he’s had with a birthday for a while. It certainly was the most eventful of his birthdays in the last few years, at least.

“Yamada-san!” He looked down at the call of his name, faintly surprised that Izuku was by him again instead of somewhere ahead of him chasing more pigeons around, “I’ve got something for you!”

Izuku’s hands were clutching down at something, but he really couldn’t see what it was.

“It’s not a bug, is it, ‘Zuku?” He asked, a bit wary, “I don’t think my poor heart can take another bug today.”

“It’s a bird!” Izuku shifted slightly, uncurling himself from around whatever he had trapped underneath his hands, “A pigeon!”

Hizashi just stared as Izuku managed to maneuver his hands around its body, cleanly plucking the flapping bird off the ground and brandishing it to him very proudly.

He couldn’t help but to think: these things never happened when Shouta was watching over Izuku.

How could it happen to him twice in an hour?

On his birthday even.


Well, at least it wasn’t a bug.

“Aizawa-san told me you don’t eat rats, so I shouldn’t catch you one,” Izuku’s grip on the pigeon tightened a smidge, the pigeon flapping its wings even more ferociously now; minor enhanced strength, right, shit, “But pigeons should be okay.” He nodded, looking extremely satisfied, “Instead of having a fried rat, you can have a fried pigeon!”

Ah.

He would have to thank Shouta later for informing Izuku about the whole ‘not-eating-rats’ thing because if what was in Izuku’s hands right now was a rat, he would be much less calm.

It was still an entire pigeon though.

An entire live pigeon who looked ready to peck someone’s eyes out and then go shit on someone’s balcony as well.

Their balcony.

After all, pigeons could recognize faces, right?

"I really appreciate it, 'Zuku," He started, eyeing that sharp beak that kept trying to aim at Izuku's thumbs, "But these pigeons… They're city pigeons.”

“Like city rats?”

“Um, yes, like those.”

“So they can give you diseases too?”

Izuku sounded so forlorn, and though it made his heart twinge, he nodded.

“They eat a lot of trash on the ground, you know?” Hizashi honestly didn’t want to think too hard about this, “And whatever else people throw out.” But he just hoped he could get Izuku’s sad expression off his face, “It’s just not a good idea to be catching and eating these guys.”

The pigeon grunted in Izuku’s hold, the flapping becoming increasingly frantic. Hizashi honestly half expected it to just fly off with Izuku still holding onto it, despite that being utterly unrealistic.

“C’mon, Izuku,” He cajoled as he neared them, hands clasped together, “If you’re hungry, we can go find something for lunch.” The pigeon only flapped more at his approach, “You know, pigeons can recognize faces. We don’t want to get pooped on every time we visit the park.”

“You better not poop on us when we come here,” Izuku told the pigeon, voice firm, “I know where you guys live.”

And with those (horrifying) parting words and subsequent loosened fingers, the pigeon was able to fling itself out of the cage that had been Izuku’s grip, flapping itself to a safer location.

Hizashi resisted the urge to heave out a sigh of relief.

Now that the whole ‘Izuku caught a pigeon for him’ thing was over and done with, he could try to rush through the rest of the list. He just wanted to go back home where there were no bugs, no pigeons, and definitely no potential opportunity for Izuku to pick up some other critter in an attempt to put them into Shouta’s fryer.

“Lunch time!” Izuku cheered as he glued himself to his side, “What are we gonna have for lunch, Yamada-san?”

“Do you have any suggestions on what we should have?” He asked as he nudged them towards the direction of the closest exit of the park, “There’s lots of eateries around here.”

“What do you wanna have, Yamada-san?”

Izuku asked, blinking up at him with wide eyes.

“Nuh-uh,” He was not having this today, “What do you wanna have, Izuku?”

“But it’s your birthday today!”

“Well, if it’s my birthday today, then I should get to decide what to do, yeah?”

“Yeah… I guess.”

“Then I wanna have what ‘Zuku wants for lunch today!” Hizashi grinned, “Are you gonna refuse me?”

Izuku stared at him, like, really stared at him before replying.

“Are you doing one of Aizawa-san’s logical ruses?”

Hizashi could feel his grin stiffen up a bit.

“No?”

Izuku continued to stare at him, finally averting his gaze seconds later, lips pulled in a pout.

“If that’s what Yamada-san wants, then I guess it’s okay.”

Victory!

A small one, but one nonetheless!

“So!” Hizashi hummed, happily noting the exit in their sights, “What are you in the mood for today, Izuku?”

“Donburi?”

“Oh, we have lots of options then!” He beckoned Izuku over to the water fountain by the exit, turning it on and had Izuku wash his hands again; who knew what could be on them after holding that pigeon, “I know a place that has the best oyakodon!” He pulled out a pack of tissues from his back pocket to dry them, “Let’s go before it gets too busy, yeah?”

Izuku gave him a nod, grabbing his hand as they exited the park together.

It didn’t take much time for them to arrive at the small family restaurant that he frequently ordered from. His employees at the radio station never had a bad thing to say about the meal sets here, so he felt more than confident in bringing Izuku for lunch.

Irasshaimase

A waitress greeted them as they entered, her voice echoing with the cook’s in the back, even as he cooked with two separate pans.

“How many people are in your party?”

“Just two.”

They were quickly seated, glasses of cold water also getting brought out to them.

“What do you want to order, ‘Zuku?” He waved a hand at the various photos that made up this restaurant’s menu that took up the side of one of the walls, “The chef’s specialty is the oyakodon, but everything here is delicious.”

“I wanna try the oyakodon if that’s okay,” Izuku looked overwhelmed by all the bright colors on the wall, eyes pausing at each one before making his decision, “The photo looks yummy.”

And with a small laugh, he placed their order with the waitress, excitement building up in him for their delicious lunch. He could feel the familiar sensation of gnawing growing in his stomach, a feeling that he got often when working late nights at the station, and a feeling only fixed by remembering that Shouta had usually packed onigiri for him just for this purpose.

“Is oyakodon one of your favorite foods?” Izuku asked after he took a long sip of water, settling the glass back down onto the table, “You seemed really happy to order it.”

“Well, I wouldn’t say it’s up there in the league of fried chicken, but it’s a good hearty meal that’ll give you lots of energy,” He grabbed a set of chopsticks from the container on the side of the table, handing it to Izuku before grabbing a set for himself, “I’m just happy to get to eat with you.”

“But we already eat together every morning?”

“I’m always happy to spend time with you, ‘Zuku.”

Izuku stayed silent at that, though Hizashi knew he wasn’t upset at him. He could see the small smile on Izuki’s face.

“And what about you, Izuku?” He shifted their glasses of water as their food arrived, making room for the steaming rice bowls amply topped with simmered chicken, egg, and onions, “Is oyakodon one of your favorites?”

“Mm..” Izuku made a non-committal sound as he carefully picked up a bite of rice covered with the egg, popping it into his mouth, chewing, and then swallowing, “My favorite food was katsudon. Back then.”

“We can have it next time,” He offered as he started to dig into his own meal, “If you’d like.”

Izuku gave him another smile.

“I’d like that a lot.”

    Shouta > See anything fun outside today?
    Izuku> Mm! A fucking bug!
    Shouta >
    Shouta > ( ಠ-ಠ )

    Izuku now thinks pill bugs are called 'fucking bugs' thanks to Hizashi.

    An adventure outside in which Izuku tries his best to teach pigeons to keep out of his territory and find big lemons! He had a lot of fun outside! :D Hizashi had fun too! For the most part!

    Oyakodon (親子丼) - the literal translation of the rice bowl Hizashi and Izuku had for lunch is "parent-and-child rice bowl". I've been wanting to have this as a meal for a while, so I'm glad it finally made it in! c:

Chapter Text

Cooking was something Shouta tended to lose himself in.

So by the time Hizashi and Izuku arrived back home, he had a majority of the cooking done already, leaving only the fried chicken unfinished.

Nemuri and Tensei were already over, having arrived early to help with decorations. It wasn't as if there were many though; just a few streamers and a single banner made up the entirety of what they had to put up.

The Present Mic balloon was also there, it's tied string keeping it secured to Izuku's chair. It didn't look too great, but he had tried. He knew how to blow balloons but this one was differently shaped enough that all his previous experience may as well have been nonexistent. Izuku had only given it a small poke with a finger as he passed by, seemingly satisfied with what he saw. Probably.

Hizashi had quickly excused himself to the living room after a quick kiss to his cheek; Tensei and Nemuri enthusiastically greeted him with 'Happy Birthdays' and slaps to the back, eager to catch him up with the most recent happenings in their lives.

Izuku stayed with him after going to his room for a quick change into clean clothes, body leaning against his side, eyes closed.

"Did you have fun outside with Hizashi?" He asked as he carefully made sure no knives were within Izuku’s reach, "Thank you for distracting him so well."

“It was fun, yeah,” Izuku murmured back, “We had oyakodon for lunch.”

“Was it good?”

“It was tasty, but I think if Aizawa-san made it,” Green eyes blinked open before looking up at him, “It would taste just as good, or even better.”

“You have a lot of confidence in my cooking, don’t you?”

Shouta gave him a fond look; it really was sweet how highly Izuku regarded anything he cooked.

“It’s ‘cause of the love you put into it.”

Izuku replied as he finally lifted his head, swallowing a yawn and rubbing at his eyes.

Shouta could only stare.

The love he put into it?

This had to be some idea Hizashi had propagated; couldn’t he have just told Izuku that he was a practiced cook?

“The love I put into the food?”

He echoed, amusement lacing the tone of his voice.

"It reminds me of Mama's cooking," Izuku mumbled, averting his gaze and puffing out his cheeks, "Like it makes me feel all warm on the inside."

Ah.

So like a home-cooked meal then.

It was during times like these that Izuku's innocence shone the brightest.

Well, he could afford to keep this up for a while longer. And it was true that he spent a fair amount of time and effort creating and cooking meals for their little family.

"I'm always happy to hear that you like what I cook," Izuku beamed at his words, "And how about you?" He strode to the refrigerator, taking out the container of chicken thigh chunks he had started marinating earlier, "Are you ready to make some fried chicken?"

Enthusiastically nodding, Izuku huddled by him closer, eyes on the chicken.

"Then let's get started."

Pouring out the potato starch into a tray, he left Izuku with instructions to coat each piece of chicken, setting it aside into a separate tray afterwards. In the meantime, he poured out the oil into a pan to prepare it for shallow frying.

It didn't take long until the kitchen was filled with the delicious smell of freshly fried chicken. Izuku was watching from a short distance, moving there after washing his hands and then seeing the sputtering oil. He had mentioned something vaguely upsetting, though he looked as unphased at his own words, as per usual.

Despite Izuku's insistence that Midoriya Hisashi had never burned him, never used his quirk directly on him, Shouta couldn't help but to think, how else would he be so knowledgeable about burns and how they felt?

Something to bring up at a later time, he decided, as he piled the already fried pieces of chicken on a wire rack, getting ready to fry up another batch. Today was Hizashi's special day, and potentially upsetting Izuku wasn't worth it, though upsetting Izuku in general wasn't something he enjoyed at all. But these were things that they had to know, regardless.

Placing the next round of coated chicken into the oil, he watched it to make sure it was frying evenly, turning the pieces over with chopsticks when one side was done, fried to a crispy perfection.

As the new batch of chicken fried, he cut into one of the pieces that had cooled, checking if it was fully cooked. He wasn't risking anything. As expected though, it was cooked through.

He beckoned Izuku over, offering him half of the piece he had just cut. Izuku looked confused, but carefully stepped closer.

“The best part about being in charge of cooking,” Shouta allowed Izuku to take the piece in his hand, then popped the other half into his own mouth, “is that you get to taste test.”

The other piece soon disappeared into Izuku’s mouth just as quickly.

“Is it good?” He asked as he moved the newly fried batch of fried chicken to the wire rack, “Juicy?”

“Both.”

Izuku confirmed to him with bright eyes, now back at his original spot. And while Shouta was glad he liked it, his curiosity only heightened at seeing Izuku keep his distance again.

He hoped that lit-up candles wouldn’t be as big of an issue; there had been no distress at the previous mentions of candles and well, surely Izuku would have told him if he didn’t want lit candles on the cake, right?

It was pointless to think about this now, not when Izuku had even reminded him the other day to get matches for lighting the candles since he didn't have a fire-breathing quirk to use like Midoriya Hisashi did.

And it was already Hizashi's birthday.

Izuku was expecting lit candles on a cake.

He would just have to blow them out quickly if Izuku showed any signs of anxiety at the sight. Or force Hizashi to, since it was his special day after all.

It didn't take long for him to finish frying up the rest of the chicken. He had already set up a large plate, a bed of finely shredded cabbage already in place. One by one, he transported the fried chicken onto the plate, settling them into a nice pile. Some wedges of lemon on the side completed the dish.

"Izuku," He called as he shook out a few skewers from their holder, "Come help me with putting these in?"

As expected, Izuku was delighted by his request, zipping to his side and climbing onto the chair there so he could reach the dish properly. He stuck a small piece of colored tape at the end of each skewer which he then passed over to Izuku. Each skewer was then poked in a piece of fried chicken with precision, though he could see the tell-tale signs of Izuku wanting to ask a question.

"It'll be easier to keep track of which one belongs to who this way," He went ahead and answered the unspoken question as he picked up the platter and headed to the kitchen table, "Can you call everyone to the table? It's time to eat."

As Izuku scampered off to the living room, he busied himself with setting the rest of the table. The plates of sliced cucumber and butterhead lettuce leaves were quickly placed. Small dishes of assorted tsukemono made for bright splashes of color on the table, the slices of pickled daikon on the table even being made by his own mother.

(His mother had been sending him more and more food lately, the written letters included with the packages always filled with fretting. Fretting about how haggard he looked in Hizashi's photos, how busy he must be to not visit them for so long, and how he must come visit them when his favorite persimmon trees bore fruit. The usual from her, really.)

He finished off the table with small saucers of condiments, placing them around the centerpiece of the table: the small mountain of fried chicken.

The low murmur of voices that had been present in the living room the last half hour or so gradually rose and just like that, he could tell that they were all finally coming over to the table.

It was just as well that they took a few minutes; he did want this to look nice.

For both Hizashi and for Izuku.

“Shou!” Hizashi’s arm snaked across his waist and he could feel the slight tickle of his moustache as a small kiss was pressed against his cheek, “This looks incredible!” Shouta could feel himself warm at the attention, “You’ve really outdone yourself this time!”

“And that’s where cooties come from, Izuku-chan,” He could hear, just barely, Nemuri whispering to Izuku even as Tensei snorted, “They’re contagious.”

“Con-ta-gious?”

“Very much so.”

He was going to murder Nemuri.

Later.

For now, it was time to eat.

Hizashi loved fried chicken.

It wasn’t something he allowed himself to have too often, heroics being a career where he had to be conscientious of his own health and all, but it was still a food he adored.

But what he loved more was that one of his favorite people made this fried chicken for him. With Shouta’s preference of jelly pouches and protein bars when out and about, most people didn’t expect him to be the one more rigid about healthy eating out of the two of them.

With his cooking experience though, everything he made was delicious and healthy, so he couldn’t complain. Plus, Izuku adored Shouta’s cooking, even looking conflicted when asked if he thought Shouta’s cooking or Lunch Rush’s cooking would taste better.

It didn’t take long for the table to get cleared of food; Izuku even insisted he get the last piece of fried chicken ‘’cause it was his favorite’ and gave Nemuri a pointed glare when she tried to skewer it instead.

He had such a thoughtful and sweet son!

After the (delicious!) meal, it was time for the cake. He could see Izuku bounce in his chair next to him, his excitement seemingly unable to be contained. Honestly, he was just as excited. It had been a while since he had cake specifically for his birthday; cake was just a bit more special on that day.

Shouta brought it out and he could hear Izuku audibly gasp, eyes big and shining at the sight of the cake. He could understand Izuku’s amazement; his jaw had dropped at seeing the cake as well.

“Lemon curd swiss roll cake for the birthday boy,” The love of his fucking life announced flatly as he placed the cake in front of him and passed him a knife, “Happy birthday, Hizashi.”

"You made this, Shouta?" Tensei sounded impressed, "Do you take commissions?"

“I’m a pro hero, not a pro baker.”

"We're singing now, right?" Izuku glanced over at him; Hizashi couldn't help but to notice the reflection of the candles' light in his eyes. He was glad to see that Izuku didn't seem anxious about the lit candles, "I practiced the song in English just for you, Yamada-san."

"Really?" Izuku really was too sweet; he could hear both Tensei and Nemuri cooing in the background, but they weren't who he was focused on, "Oh 'Zuku, I'd love to hear it!"

And sing he did.

Izuku's English was still a bit shaky and he was undoubtedly wary of singing around Nemuri and Tensei. But that he tried this at all, even being the one to bring it up…

He was so proud of him.

Hizashi could feel his heart swell with emotions, only just able to stop himself from singing along. This was Izuku's time to shine.

After a couple of lines from Izuku, everyone else joined in. Hizashi knew he was unabashedly grinning, unable to mask his emotions at this moment. He was also unable to stop himself from humming along, sue him.

When the last word was finally sung, Nemuri and Tensei cheered and applauded. Izuku looked confused, watching them for a second before switching his gaze to Shouta and then to the flickering candles on the cake.

Hizashi blew the candles out in one swift breath, the smoking wicks the only evidence that they had even been lit in the first place.

May he and his family and friends live long lives full of love, laughter, and happiness.

Was it silly to still wish upon blown candles?

Perhaps.

But it didn't hurt to do so.

“It's cake time now, right?” Izuku interrupted his thoughts, his eyes not having left the cake's direction for a single second, “Is it as sour as real lemon?”

"Well, 'Zuku," He hummed as plucked the candles out of the cake, placing them aside. He then brandished the knife, cutting off a good slice of it, placing the slice onto a plate that Shouta slid to him, "Lemon curd is creamy and sweet. A bit sour still, but not as sour as an actual lemon."

“It does smell sweet…”

"Why don't you have the first bite then?" Izuku's eyes went big at his words and he wanted so badly to coo; however he really didn't need to give Nemuri any more ammunition, not before he had gotten her back for that 'cootie' thing, "I know it's my birthday and all, but I can do anything I want on this day, yeah?"

Hizashi could see the pout form on Izuku's lips the moment he realized the argument he was using, again. Spending so much time around Shouta, it was only natural that he picked up his own tips and tricks about…persuasion. It was nothing on the levels of Shouta's logical ruses, but it got the job done and that was all he needed.

"Just one bite," Izuku conceded after a short stare-down, jabbing the fork Shouta handed him into the cake and separating off a piece, "But you gotta go next."

“I will," He confirmed as he served up more slices of cake, making sure everyone had a portion before handing the knife back to Shouta, "I'm pretty excited about this cake too, ya know."

Hizashi could see Shouta's eyes flicking in Izuku's direction even as he popped the entire forkful into his mouth, undoubtedly wanting to know what his opinion of the cake was. He was the one who had baked it, after all.

It was a solemn few seconds as Izuku chewed, everyone at the table watching. Nemuri had even paused mid-chew to watch. Tensei hadn't even started on his, so engrossed was he into the 'taste of lemon curd' adventure Izuku was on.

"It's tasty."

Izuku looked pleasantly surprised even as he forked up another bite, this one a lot bigger than the last.

"Your turn now."

He held it out to him, and somehow, Hizashi knew that Izuku wouldn't compromise with this. It was pretty big though; could he even fit it into his mouth in one bite?

Well, it wasn't as if he hadn't ever embarrassed himself on purpose in public before.

This would be a cinch.


It was not a cinch.

He had powdered sugar on his nose and lemon curd on his upper lip now, the delicious casualties of taking such a big bite.

Shouta only snorted at the sight, his hand moving to vaguely cover the lower half of his face, though his amusement was clear to anyone that happened to look in his direction. Even Tensei, usually the polite one, couldn't stop his muffled laughter as he offered him a napkin. Nemuri, though, had no reservations, throwing her head back to cackle loudly.

“Oops.” Izuku didn’t look very apologetic despite what he just said, “Aizawa-san, Yamada-san made a mess.”

“Oh he did, didn’t he?” Shouta agreed, eyes filled with mirth.

Hizashi playfully glared at Shouta once he had heard this, but it was hard being intimidating when even his poor moustache even had a dusting of powdered sugar on it. Izuku took the napkin proffered by Tensei and offered it to him in turn, none of the amusement in everyone else’s eyes in his own.

“Here you go, Yamada-san.”

He could only melt in return.

Izuku was too precious for words.

Accepting the napkin, he quickly patted his face clean, returning to his cake afterwards, the napkin carefully folded next to him.

The cake really was delicious.

Even as everyone continued eating, he couldn’t help but to watch and listen to everyone else’s conversations around him, taking sips of tea between bites of cake.

It was just nice seeing everyone smile so freely, even as his own smile became strained hearing Izuku mention to Shouta that they had, in his words, “seen a fucking bug in the park” and then followed it up with the shocking phrase of, “Yamada-san said I couldn’t eat the fucking bug.”

Oh no.

He hadn’t realized that Izuku would repeat what he had said in that spur of the moment. It was something he should have expected; Izuku loved to tell the both of them about his day whenever they asked him about it, hands always in motion and with sound effects.

“That’s not a word you should use around others,” Shouta heaved out a sigh, red-tinged eyes looking over in his direction, “It’s not considered polite to swear.”

“What’s that?” Izuku asked, nose wrinkled with confusion, “Fucking bug is the name of the bug I found, Aizawa-san.”

The bewildered look on Shouta’s face was priceless and Hizashi felt like he had died about ten times in the last ten seconds. Nice. This was absolutely going to bite him in the ass later, he just knew it.

“Present time!” Nemuri then interrupted, both Izuku and Shouta turning at her outburst, “I got you something this year, Hizashi!”

“It’s present time?” Izuku murmured, eyes darting over to him, then to Shouta who gave him a half-hearted shrug, and then back to him, shining, “It’s present time, Yamada-san!”

It honestly seemed as if Izuku was more enthusiastic about presents than he was.

Not that he wasn’t excited to see what Nemuri had apparently gotten him, but man, oh man, he had to be careful opening whatever she gave him. Especially since Izuku seemed very interested in seeing what it would be. He didn’t think he could escape questions from Izuku if an, ahem, adult toy was his birthday present.

“It sure is present time, ‘Zuku,” He flashed him a small grin, “Let’s go to the living room for this, yeah?”

“Yeah!”

Izuku whooped, getting out of his chair in record time. Hizashi thought he’d run to the living room as well, but he stopped by his chair, looking up at him, fingers fiddling with the hem of his hoodie.

“Let’s go together?”

“Of course.”

    Poor Shouta, but at least he got out of having to explain? xD (for now at least..)

    Izuku is very excited about present time! And Hizashi is very curious about his presents!

    And Izuku has no solid what of what cooties might be :/ And he also has no idea what 'contagious' means still either xD

Chapter Text

It was time for presents.

They all slowly migrated to the living room, settling down on the couch and the stools that had been set out while he and Izuku were out on their ‘errands’.

Izuku bounced around the entire short walk there.

How was he not tired?

They had spent the entire morning and a large chunk of the afternoon outside with practically no breaks or naps.

He really did have a really disproportionate amount of energy compared to his small body.

Shouta was onto something saying that he wanted to enroll Izuku into some sort of physical activity. It wasn't something he really noticed until today honestly, being a relatively high-energy person himself, but he was pretty tired still, tuckered out from chasing after Izuku in the park and all that.

Nemuri handed him a box, a grin still on her face.

He felt one thing, and one thing only.

Fear.

He slowly unraveled the extravagant bow on top, passing it to Izuku who seemed utterly delighted with the velvety soft purple ribbon, immediately wrapping it around his hand, his fingers running along the length of the material.

(There was no wrapping paper, thankfully. He had enough memories of Izuku shredding paper as an owl and he wanted the cleanup for this small party to be easy. It was too easy to recall Izuku clutching the paper with his talons, ripping bits off with his beak, and throwing them away onto the rug with a toss of his head. They even bought a new vacuum cleaner just for this, though it was a multipurpose tool also used for cleaning up the tiny stray feathers that he’d sometimes leave behind. Was it weird he could see human kid Izuku do the same?)

Peeking into the box, he saw a book. He was glad he wouldn't have to figure out excuses to tell Izuku if it had been not suitable to be opened in the presence of a kid. A book couldn't be too bad and he did like reading in whatever free time he could scrounge up, the bookshelf in the living room being an attestation to that.

He pulled it out, glancing at the title before turning it to show an eager Izuku as well.

"Parenting for Dummies."

He read the title out loud, a small laugh then escaping him. No doubt about it, he'd need to read this one from cover to cover. Both Shouta and him needed all the help they could get. Thanking Nemuri for her gift, he placed the book back into the box, very much ignoring whatever else was in there hiding underneath all the tissue paper the book was initially resting on. He wasn’t going to push his luck. That was one gift he would open later in the safety of his and Shouta’s bedroom, thank you very much.

The next gift passed over to him was Tensei's: it was a pair of new Hage branded headphones! He thanked him even as Izuku argued with Nemuri that "Yamada-san was not a dummy and he was one of the smartest people he knew'' and that “getting that book for Yamada-san was being mean to him!”

Oh man.

He might actually cry.

On his birthday too.

How embarrassing.

“What about your present, Izuku?” Shouta hummed as he held out his hand to him, beckoning for the box with Nemuri’s presents inside; Hizashi handed it to him, “Do you want to go fetch it?”

“It’s my turn already?” Izuku gasped, turning to look at both Nemuri and Tensei, their presents, and then back at Shouta, “I… I gotta go get it!”

He slid off the couch and raced to his room, his footsteps a quick pitter-patter against the wooden floors.

Ah, the sound of Izuku running indoors. It was a stark difference from mere weeks ago, where Izuku would only allow himself to cautiously walk down the hallway. Not that he didn’t try running at first; it was just that running when he had been so unsteady on his feet, still getting used to having human legs again, it wasn’t too good of an idea. His poor face had met the floor multiple times, frustrated tears coming to his eyes every time it had happened.

But now, he was confident enough to run again, both inside and outside.

It made him happy to see Izuku flourishing under their care, even if it was something as simple as this.

“Nemuri,” Shouta groaned, shoving whatever it was in the box back under the tissue paper, “I’m killing you tomorrow.”

“Such a short notice!” Nemuri pouted, though it was easy to see that she took no offence to his words, deriving glee from it instead, “Rude!”

“They have a kid now!” Tensei tutted, poking her side with a finger, “Do you want to explain to a seven year old about this sort of thing?”

“I’m back!”

Izuku announced as he returned to the living room, holding something (his present!) behind him. He tilted his head as they all quieted at his entrance, clearly suspicious about what they had been chatting about, but Shouta neatly side-stepped the situation, patting the seat between the two of them, asking if he was ready to present his gift.

Hizashi just was so curious.

What could Izuku have gotten him?

He knew he would love and cherish it regardless, even if it was Real Mick that Izuku handed to him.

As Izuku got closer, it was apparent that it was some sort of card that he held in his hand. There was a blatant attempt to try and orient his body to cover it in an attempt to hide it from him stil, but it didn’t exactly work well. There were things his height afforded him, and a great vantage point was just one of them.

It was all he could do to not jiggle his leg in anticipation.

However, as Izuku continued to near, he stopped at the coffee table, head tilted and eyes staring out the balcony doors. His pupils were contracted, lost in a sea of green.

A second passed.

Two.

"I've never seen a flying robot before."

What?

Hizashi redirected his gaze out to the open sky, eyes searching for the robot that Izuku mentioned. He could see Shouta doing the same, hand already grasping for his capture weapon that wasn't settled around his shoulders for once.

"Uh, guys?" Tensei voiced, eyes quickly darting from the sky and then back to them, "Are Izuku-kun's eyes supposed to do that?"

Do what?

Shouta turned at his words, and Hizashi could see muted surprise light up his eyes.

"It might be his quirk."

"You never did mention his quirk to us," Nemuri propped her chin up with her free hand looking pensive, though he could see the tense lines of her body, ready to leap into action at a second's notice, "He hadn’t either." She drummed her fingers against her cheek, "I did think it was a bit weird. Most kids are usually more than happy to rave about their quirk to others, but it seems that Izuku-chan is yet another exception to that, huh."

"We followed his lead on that decision," He shrugged, even as he sidled over so that he was pressed against Shouta, eyes still trained on the sky, trying to see what Izuku apparently could see, "He chose not to talk to about it, so we didn't either."

Speaking of Izuku, he was staring at the sky, motionless. His pupils were still moving, clearly tracking something in motion.

Could it be a villain attack?

If so, well, that was shit timing.

“I see it now,” Shouta looked mildly disgruntled before letting out a sigh, “It’s just one of U.A.’s drones.”

“U.A.?” Tensei also relaxed back into his seat, arms returning to his side, “What could they want with you?” He let out a chuckle, “I don’t think I’ve even been back to visit in any capacity ever since graduation.”

A good question.

Though unlike Tensei, he knew that Shouta and Izuku had recently visited U.A. twice, meeting with Nedzu both those times as well.

Just what could Nedzu, and he knew it had to be Nedzu, be contacting them for?

With a drone, no less.

“Izuku,” No longer watching the drone’s approach now, Shouta turned to face Izuku, his voice low, “Kid, can you look at me?”

Izuku blinked slowly at the sound of his name, an odd expression crossing his face, making him blink yet again.

"Aizawa-san…" He squinted in Shouta's direction, "It's really bright."

"I think this could be your quirk activating," Shouta leaned forward, pulling Izuku to himself, eyes sharp and observing every single visible detail, "Do you feel anything different about your body? Besides the enhanced sight."

Izuku paused, eyes squinted down even lower as he thought.

Hizashi watched, though his eyes kept lingering on the card still in Izuku's possession. He jerked the line of his vision away; temptation was a very real thing, but he could wait.

"It's just my eyes," Izuku concluded after a few more seconds of mulling, "Everything else still feels human."

"Alright," Shouta murmured even as Nemuri and Tensei gave each other a look, "I want you to try to remember this feeling." Izuku nodded, eyes now closed, "And after you've got it down, see if you can reverse this partial transformation. Remember the tips that Tatsuma gave you."

Tatsuma?

Ah, had to be the dragon transformation quirk student attending U.A.

He was thankful that Nemuri and Tensei both knew better to interrupt this, saving up all their questions for later instead, no doubt.

It took a few minutes for Izuku to speak next and by then, the drone was close enough for him to see even if he didn't have his glasses on.

"I can't do it," Izuku sounded tired, his eyes glassy and unfocused, "My head hurts."

Hizashi could feel his heart crack at his words. He reached out, fingers carefully carding through Izuku's limp curls, tucking what he could behind his ears.

"Shouta," He murmured, careful to keep his voice even; Izuku leaned forward and he took the chance to pull him up onto the couch between the two of them again, "Erasure?"

Control wasn't something that could be learned in a day.

Far from it.

And from the looks of it, this part of Izuku's quirk was something he and Shouta both hadn't expected at all either.

"Izuku," The back of Shouta's knuckles ghosted over Izuku's forehead, "Do you want me to use Erasure on you?”

‘Yes.’

Izuku tapped in lieu of speaking.

Shouta’s eyes flashed a familiar red, the tips of his hair rising. Almost immediately, Izuku relaxed, the wrinkle between his brows smoothing out. Shouta’s hair then fell back down, landing in messy waves which he swept out of his eyes.

Just in time too, because the drone was landing on their balcony.

“I’ll go get it.”

After some quick rearranging of limbs so that Izuku was now leaning against him, Shouta stood and walked over to the balcony doors, sliding them open and picked up the drone, bringing it inside.

“This looks bigger than the ones I remember,” Tensei murmured, a finger tapping his chin, “Sturdier too.”

“It’s got a safe,” Nemuri pointed out, “At the base.”

Before Shouta could examine it further, a small hologram popped out of the top, immediately starting to play.

“Am I a mouse? A dog? A bear?” The hologram of Nedzu chirruped, beaming, “I’m Nedzu! The Principal of U.A.!”

“Nedzu-san?” Izuku stirred, eyes squinting at the hologram, “A video of Nedzu-san?”

“A hologram,” He gently corrected, “He recorded this beforehand, so it’s a bit like a video, but it’s an image made of light.” After sticking his hand into the hologram and wiggling his fingers, he gave the gaping Izuku a small grin, “Means it’s just an image and he’s not really there.”

“Congratulations on the anniversary of your birth, Yamada-kun!!” Hizashi could see his ears flick upwards, smile gaining a touch of softness, “And please pass on my warm regards to young Izuku-kun!”

“Regards?”

“Nedzu says ‘hi’ to you.”

“Can I say ‘hi’ back?”

“We can ask Shouta to send him a message later, yeah?”

“Mm.”

“Enclosed is what we spoke about in our last meeting, Aizawa-kun,” Nedzu’s grin seemed smug, his eyes even twinkling, despite it just being a hologram, “Do contact me regarding our deal.” He waved a paw, his paw pads making a quick appearance, “Farewell for now. I will see you soon.”

Soon?

A deal?

How soon?

And Shouta hadn’t mentioned anything about a deal to him.

He watched Izuku for a reaction to Nedzu’s words, but he seemed content to continue relaxing against him, showing no worry about what was being said.

Speaking of Shouta though, he was fiddling with the safe, feeling out the edges until he managed to pop open a keypad, only pausing for a second before inputting in a sequence of letters and numbers. He then heard a click, a short victory fanfare playing before a sheath of papers in a folder was revealed.

“What are those, Shou?”

He wanted to stand and check it for himself, but Izuku was still leaning against him and he didn’t have the heart to move him right now.

“Adoption papers for Izuku apparently,” Shouta said matter-of-factly, like it wasn’t a huge deal, because this was a huge fucking deal, “Happy birthday, Hizashi.”

”What?!”

Izuku made a disgruntled sound at his volume, so he forced himself to lower his voice.

“Shouta!” He wiggled his fingers expectantly for the papers, “Let me see!”

“We’re not signing anything yet,” Shouta warned him as he passed the folder over, “Reading fine print and all.” Hizashi accepted the folder gleefully, immediately flipping to the back, finding the adoption certification papers with Izuku’s name already written in it. Nedzu’s neat print was unmistakable. “We have our certification to be adoptive parents as well.”

Was this legal?

Wait.

Plausible deniability.

He saw nothing.

“‘Zuku!” He gave Izuku a small nudge, “Look! We’re so close to becoming your official parents!”

Izuku only nodded, nuzzling into his side.

He really should have expected lethargy from him. Izuku's human body wasn't adjusted to holding onto the partial effects of a transformation quirk yet and he was only a kid. There were certain things that could only come from age. A body's development around it's quirk was one of them.

"You wanna lay down?" He asked as he flipped the folder closed, handing it back to Shouta who was silently beckoning for it, "The party is pretty much over."

"My present…"

"Oh, 'Zuku," This kid, his son, was too sweet, "You and your health is more important than any gift, ya know."

Hizashi could hear Nemuri coo at his words, Tensei agreeing with her.

While it was a bit awkward that his friends were witnesses to all of this, it wasn't embarrassment that was the awkward factor.

It was Izuku's vulnerability.

Nemuri and Tensei were his and Shouta's closest friends; they'd gone through a lot together. But while Izuku didn't outright dislike them, he hadn't taken to them much either. Sure, he was polite in his interactions with them (for the most part), but the same courtesy was afforded to Tsukauchi.

Maybe Izuku preferred the company of others his age?

Did this mean he would have to ask Tensei to arrange a play-date with Tenya?

And what about his old friends?

Surely someone like Izuku had plenty of friends? Friends who now thought he was dead, burned alive.

He'd need to ask Izuku if he wanted to re-establish any contact with any of them.

"Present first."

Izuku interrupted his thoughts, offering him the card, rubbing at his eyes with a sleeve. Honestly, he was surprised the card hadn't been dropped onto the floor with all of the things that had just happened.

He took the card into his hands, careful to not wrinkle or crease it.

"Do you want me to explain?" Izuku offered, already leaning over his arm, "I worked really hard on it, so you gotta understand everything on it, okay?" He paused to glance at Shouta before continuing, "Aizawa-san helped me with the words though. We both worked really hard."

"Sure thing, 'Zuku," He encouraged, "I wanna know everything!"

"Then me and Nemuri are gonna go start on the cleanup," Tensei gave him a grin and a thumbs up, hooking his arm around Nemuri’s elbow and then left the living room even as she protested, leaving them alone in the living room, "Don't wait on us!"

After a few moments of silence, he heard the familiar clinking of plates and the faucet being run.

They had the best friends.

"So," Izuku started with nary a glance even at their exit, "This is you, me, and Aizawa-san." He pointed out the figures drawn on the cover of the card and then pointed at the smiling object above them, "The sun is a lemon that's the color of your hair."

"A lemon?" He repeated; well now he knew why it was drawn as an oval-ish shape, "Any specific reason why?"

"You like lemons."

Fair.

"You can continue, 'Zuku," He chuckled, "I was just curious."

"Okay," Izuku nodded and then turned the card, revealing the back of it, "I drew a 'no bugs allowed' sign here, 'cause you don't like bugs and no bugs are allowed to touch your present."

It was the sentiment that counted!

And he knew Shouta had to agree with him because if he didn't, he would have totally told Izuku that bugs probably didn't know how to read.

(Well with the exception of spelling bees, at least. Ha! Man, he was hilarious!)

“I appreciate the forethought!” He did have to agree that bugs touching his present would suck; it was sweet that Izuku had tried his best to mitigate this without offering to eat them or something, “I’m sure no bugs would dare come near this card now.”

Izuku gave him a small smile and then opened the card. It was in English. It was less surprising since he had mentioned that he had practiced singing in that language earlier, but singing compared to writing actual grammatically correct sentences was pretty different in terms of practical skill.

“This is the part that Aizawa-san helped me with,” He informed him, pointing at the words, “So if it doesn’t make sense, it’s his fault.”

He could practically hear Shouta’s eyebrows rising at Izuku’s words.

“I used an online translator.”

Ah, well that was fine.

It couldn’t be too bad, could it?

“You can read it now.”

And with Izuku’s express permission, he allowed himself to take in the words that were written on the card.

    Happy birthday, Mr. Yamada!

    You are one of my favorite people. You are always cool. Your quirk is also cool.

    When I'm sad, you make me happy.

    I wish you happiness and delicious food.

    Let's go home together forever?

    From,

    Izuku

    (If there are insects, I'll eat them for you!)

Hizashi could feel himself melt at the words on the paper.

“This is so sweet,” He enthused; his cheeks hurt from smiling so hard while reading it, “Oh, ‘Zuku, I love this.”

“You do?” Izuku sounded amazed, “But you said to not eat bugs?”

“Well, now you know not to, yeah?” He chuckled nervously, determined to not meet Shouta’s eyes, “Then it’s all good.”

“You really love it?”

“Really really.”

So much that he felt like if he tried to express it in words, he’d just start sobbing instead. The translated text had an odd charm to it, Izuku’s bluntness and honesty peeking through even the formal wording. It was also obvious that Shouta had given Izuku control of the laptop near the end and had taken his eyes off of him and whatever he was typing. There was no way that he would have agreed with Izuku putting in that he’d eat bugs, right?

“I’m so-o glad you love it,” Izuku hiccupped, “I was worried you wouldn’t.”

“If it’s from you, I’d love it no matter what,” His heart broke knowing Izuku had been beating himself up about this, “Why’d you think I wouldn’t like it?

“Because Hisashi never liked the presents I made him.”

Izuku’s reply was soft, but the anger it made him feel was unmistakable.

“He never smiled at anything I gave him.”

He shook his head, as if to shake himself free of those sudden thoughts.

“I… I actually have something else for you,” Sliding off the couch, he stumbled slightly at the landing but righted himself up after a small yawn, “I’m gonna go get it, okay?”

“Go ahead, ‘Zuku,” He reached out to give him a quick pat on the head, “Shou and I will wait for you here, yeah?”

Izuku nodded at his words before heading into the kitchen.

There was a second of silence before he could hear Shouta’s grumble.

“I’m going to punch Midoriya Hisashi if it’s the last thing I do.”

“Save me a piece.”

Another second of silence.

“Also, Hizashi,” He could hear Shouta hum, “A fucking bug, really?”

“But Shou!” Hizashi resisted the urge to squeak, lest he attract Izuku’s attention to their whispered conversation, “There were so many legs!”

“Legs or not,” Shouta pointed out, “You know that Izuku’s liable to repeat this to other people, right?”

Yeah.

Fuck.

“Nedzu will probably think that it’s funny?”

“Well,” Shouta sighed, “You’re not wrong.”

Yet another small stretch of silence passed between them.

“You know,” He initiated the conversation this time, “Izuku caught me a pigeon today.” The memory would stay with him for a while for sure, “Wanted to fry it with the chicken.”

He could feel Shouta’s incredulous stare bore into him, no words being spoken aloud. Not that words could really express the sheer absurdity of that particular part of his day.

“I’m back now,” Izuku announced as he re-entered the living room, each step taking him closer back to him, “Here you go, Yamada-san.”

Hizashi instinctively offered his hand out to receive whatever Izuku was giving him, feeling it fall into his hand.

It was a small lemon.

“A lemon?”

“It’s a fake lemon,” Izuku corrected him, “It won’t ever go bad so you can keep it forever.” He suddenly looked bashful, his words more of a mumble now, “I just… I wanted you to have something you’d like.”

So cute.

“I’ll cherish it forever.”

He promised the delighted Izuku.

After hearing those words, how could he not honor that wish?

Man, he was such a sap.

Here he was, feeling emotional over a tiny fake lemon.

“Thank you so much for the gifts, ‘Zuku!”

“Ya-Yamada-san only…” Izuku’s words were interrupted by another yawn before he continued; he had to be even more exhausted by now, “Yamada-san only deserves nice things.”

“Why don’t you go shower and sleep early tonight, Izuku?” Shouta cut in, voice warm, “You look tired.”

Izuku merely nodded.

He had to be really fucking exhausted to not even voice a small protest at heading to bed at this time. Not that he blamed him; he was getting pretty tired as well, finally winding down after an eventful day.

What a day.

What a birthday.

As Izuku toddled off to shower, he and Shouta joined Nemuri and Tensei in the kitchen to help with the cleanup, though there wasn’t much left to do by now. Shouta hadn’t really left behind too much to clean in the first place.

Time flew as they wiped the table down and took down the decorations that had been put up. The balloon of him was left tied to the back of Izuku’s chair; he kind of hoped that Izuku wouldn’t decide to keep it for too long. It was weird enough seeing himself deflate over time once, he didn't need to watch it die a second slow death.

Nemuri and Tensei were sent off with hugs and heartfelt thanks for both coming and accommodating the new way they celebrated his birthday this year. And for also bringing presents even when he had told them that it wasn’t necessary to do so.

With their friends gone, it was just him, Shouta, and Izuku once again, a sense of peace pervading their apartment.

It didn’t take long for Izuku to emerge from his shower, changed into unevenly buttoned pajamas.

He went over, kneeling to re-button them, making sure that his stomach was adequately covered. It wouldn’t do to catch a cold before his upcoming birthday.

“Carry me to bed, Yamada-san?” Izuku loosely encircled his arms over his shoulders, “Please?”

“Of course, ‘Zuku.”

He lifted him up, making sure his arms were supporting Izuku’s weight properly.

“‘Night, Aizawa-san.”

Izuku called out, hand waving to Shouta.

“Good night, Izuku,” Shouta acknowledged their son with soft eyes, “Sleep well.”

Walking to Izuku’s room, he made sure his steps were light and careful. No accidentally jarring Izuku out of the relaxed state he was in, nope.

He pushed open the door, the light from the hallway flooding in.

It wasn’t too late in the evening, but the sky was already quickly turning dark, the stars now visible to the naked eye.

"Long day, huh?" Hizashi chuckled as Izuku stirred against him with a hum, "This might actually be the longest stretch of time you've been awake for a while."

Carefully placing him into bed, he pulled the blankets over, tucking him in. Before he could finish tucking him in, Izuku stopped him, small fingers lightly gripping his sleeve.

"Can I get a hug first?" He asked, words mumbled, "Hug first and then sleep…"

"Anytime," Hizashi gathered him up into his arms as he took a seat on the bedside, allowing him to rest his head over his heart, "I love you, you know, Izuku."

They stayed like that for a while, quiet and motionless except for the rise and fall of his chest.

Well, he tried to be motionless, but he couldn't help his cradling Izuku closer, the slight pressure of his weight against his body providing a comforting presence.

"I know."

Izuku's low words were slurred with sleepiness. Frankly, Hizashi was surprised he wasn't already asleep.

"You know?"

He replied, amused, as he dipped his head down to bump his chin against the top of Izuku's curls.

"That you love me…"

Izuku's eyelids slipped down even more, the green of his eyes barely visible.

"G'night, Pa..pa."

He had slumped fully against him, his fingers finally loosening their grip on his sleeve. Hizashi knew that was the exact moment that Izuku stopped fighting against sleep, finally giving into the embrace of his dreams.

He could feel something wet rolling down his cheeks.

Shit.

He had told himself he wouldn't cry today.

But Izuku had called him Papa.

Izuku had called him Papa.

He was Papa.

    :O Izuku did it!! He tried so hard and it paid off! Though he did fall asleep right after ;v; Long day for small boy with that quirk incident and all!

    Hizashi is just so overcome with emotions, he's gonna cry all over Shouta afterwards xD

Chapter Text

His quirk was weird.

That was what Izuku had concluded after hours of trying to get it to work properly again.

It wasn't the same as being Quirkless, despite not being able to use it in a meaningful way. There were times he could feel something, a feeling deep inside of him that wanted him to jump and fly. Made him want to feel the wind flow against his feathers, and even urged him to stop by the window of a store that gave him a great view of tiny mice running around in an enclosed space where he couldn't help but to stare.

There was no doubt in his mind that these feelings came from his quirk. And when he mentioned them to Aizawa-san one previous afternoon as he bit off the head of an animal-shaped cracker, frustrated with how he wasn't progressing at all, he had agreed with him.

"Without a doubt, this is your quirk at work," Aizawa-san had told him as placed the paperwork he had been going over aside, giving him his full attention, "It’s a good thing.” He had offered him another cracker, which he accepted with a pout, “This is an indication that your health is improving.”

He had thought about it for a while after hearing that.

It was true that he had been feeling a bit warmer recently. Just a bit though. Enough so that he didn’t even bother wearing socks to bed in the last couple of days.

But even so! Even if his health was getting better, he wasn't getting better! At the whole "use quirk in a controlled en-vi-ron-ment" thing, at least.

There was something else he was getting better at doing as well.

It was calling his Yamada-san his Papa.

After managing to call him that on the night of his birthday, it had gotten steadily easier to use in conversation. There were times where he would go back to using 'Yamada-san', but he had been assured that what he referred to him as didn't matter, and that no matter what, he was always loved.

His new parents had already signed off on the adoption paperwork that Nedzu-san had helped get for them. It had been a busy day when that happened, with many things getting talked about. But if he had to be honest, he had blanked out on a large portion of it after he realized how boring it was to just sit there doing nothing as the lady who came talked to the adults almost the entire time.

Izuku had a job to do at that time though; he had to keep watch on their home. People coming into his territory like this wasn’t something he liked, but he knew that they had to be here for the adoption stuff.

Ugh.

He had met another new person later though; this one had actually talked to him and asked him questions about his new home. They seemed really interested in his answers and well, that was already better than the lady from earlier. However, this did not change the fact that this was still a stranger in his home. He did not like that at all. That was what the feeling inside of him told him.

Thankfully, that person had left quickly after they had gotten all their questions asked and answered, taking their large cup of coffee with them. He was glad he didn’t have to push them out of the door to get them to leave.

Izuku had gotten two big hugs right after everyone else left; his Papa was already crying his happy tears while his Aizawa-san had that soft look on his face.

It was amazing how powerful some pieces of paper could be.

Just with some signatures, he suddenly had two new official parents.

And just like that, his name was now Aizawa Izuku.

He would need to get used to introducing himself with his new name probably, but it wasn't as if he was meeting anymore new people soon.

It was just that Iida-san had a younger brother around his age. and he knew that both his new dads thought they'd make good playmates. So it was only a matter of time before he and Iida Tenya met.

But if Iida Tenya was anything like Kacchan, like Bakugou Katsuki, there was no way he wanted to be his friend. And he’d be really disappointed in Iida-san if his brother was like that. Ingenium was a pro hero after all; he was supposed to make sure other people didn’t get hurt.

On slow days like this, he always found himself thinking about Kacchan more than usual.

It was summer and Kacchan had always enjoyed the summer, the hot weather meant that he sweated more than he usually did, and that made bigger and stronger explosions.

And if there was anything Kacchan did like, it was being strong.

If there was anything he loved, it was winning.

But Izuku knew better now.

There was a time where he would have liked winning all the time like Kacchan did.

But then he had won the game of hide and seek his Mama had played with him. And while he had won, his Mama was now dead, gone forever.

Winning just wasn't everything anymore.

Because it was losing that same game that led to him getting new parents, new dads that both loved and cared about him.

And he was glad he had lost in the end.

If he had won, he wouldn't have his new dads. He'd be all alone again, just like how he had been when he had first lost his Mama. If he had won, he would have just continued with life eventually. Flying, hunting, eating, and sleeping. Might have even flown further to find a new roost.

Enjoyed the simple life that an owl lived.

And then he'd die like an owl would die.

Die like his Mama had.

(He had wondered a long time ago, if he died, would he see his Mama again? Would she be waiting for him with a warm hug and smile?)

(... Where did owls even go after death?)

But in the end, he had chosen to live.

And he was glad he was alive.

He was alive and he was gonna turn eight soon.

Humming as he drew a cake on the front of the paper he just folded, he made sure there were eight candles on it before continuing with the rest of the card. Actually, it would be better to color in the candles before he forgot to. The crayons were right there on the coffee table, so he may as well take advantage of that.

Four black and four yellow.

Black, yellow, black, yellow…

Black for his Dad and yellow for his Papa.

For them and not for the bees.

(Bees made the honey that went on his ‘special-day pancakes’ and he'd really like for them to continue doing that, so they were on his 'not-a-snack' list.)

Coloring was the easy part; it was the writing bit that he was more worried about.

But he wanted to do this right.

And if he got it wrong… Well, he had brought a whole folder full of paper with him to the living room for that exact reason. He'd just have to keep trying and probably ask for a tiny bit of help. Probably.

It was going well so far though and before long, he held in his hands a completed invitation to his birthday, no help needed. He also had a mound of crumpled practice papers next to him, but that wasn’t important.

All that was left to do was to ask someone to deliver this.

Luckily for him, he always had at least one of his parents around whether they were catching up on work, cooking a meal, or just napping.

He turned, body twisting though his feet were still tucked under him, a finger prodding his napping dad's cheek. Aizawa-san made a small noise, wrinkling his nose before squinting an eye open at him just as he went to poke his nose.

"Hello, Izuku," Aizawa-san mumbled, voice still a bit scratchy from his nap, eyes squinting at his finger which had landed it's target, "Is there something I can help you with?"

"Hi, Aizawa-san," He replied with a small smile, hand retreating from any further pokes to grab the invitation to show him, "I need you to send this to Nedzu-san."

“And what’s this?”

“An invitation for my birthday.”

He had thought it was pretty obvious with the cake on the front, but maybe he should label it as well? Nedzu-san being confused about the cake and deciding not to come because of that… Well, he didn’t like the thought of that.

“You want to invite Nedzu?”

“Papa said I could invite any friend I wanted.”

Aizawa-san stared at him and then at the card before closing his eyes again.

“I think he meant friends your age,” He sighed as he got out of his napping position, sitting and stretching his arms up, “Like your old friends from back then or something.” Aizawa-san dragged a hand through his hair, fixing it so it didn't cover half his face, "It'll have to be kept quiet and they'll need to sign some non-disclosure agreements, but it can be done."

Old friends from before his quirk had activated?

So he meant people like Kacchan.

Except for the fact that Kacchan was possibly one of the worst friends anyone could ever have. And that Izuku didn’t really consider them friends. Not anymore, at least.

Plus, all the other kids only were around him because they wanted to be around Kacchan, so it wasn’t as if they were his friends either.

“I don’t have any friends from then.”

Aizawa-san squinted open his eyes at his words, and Izuku blinked up at him in return.

“Really?” He sounded surprised, his eyebrows rising up, “None at all?”

“None at all,” Izuku confirmed and then shrugged, “I used to have them, but when everyone found out I didn’t have a quirk… Well, no one wants to be actual friends with someone Quirkless.”

“Actual friends?”

“Yeah, like actual real friends,” He said, trying to explain, “They’re like pretend friends sometimes?” Tapping his finger absentmindedly against the edge of the coffee table, he murmured, “Like… Like Kacchan.”

“I’ve never heard of a ‘Kacchan’ before, Izuku,” Aizawa-san said the name with a confused tone, "Can you clarify on that?"

Izuku shuffled himself around so he was properly facing his dad, not wanting to keep himself turned the entire time because this was gonna be a long conversation, and he was getting tired of keeping himself in that position.

(He left Nedzu-san’s invitation on the table for later, telling himself to remind Aizawa-san to send it after all of this.)

"Kacchan… He…" It was hard to explain Kacchan to someone else that didn't already know him, "We were friends, a long time ago."

Aizawa-san nodded, though he didn't say anything.

Did he want more information?

"We were friends and then he started calling me 'Deku' and well, everyone else followed him," Izuku buried his fingers into the materials of his shorts; even now, hearing himself say it made him feel weird inside, in a bad way, "I didn't like it, but Kacchan never stopped even when I asked him to." He huffed, reminded of the frustration, "And 'cause he didn't, no one else did either."

"'Deku'..." Aizawa-san frowned, "That's not a nice name, is it."

Izuku shook his head.

It was a mean, mean, name.

"And you can't call me that either," He pressed, nearly begging, "Okay, Aizawa-san?"

If even Aizawa-san called him ‘Deku’…

He didn’t know what he’d do.

“I don’t wanna be a useless Deku anymore.”

Izuku’s small plaintive tone hurt him more than he wanted to admit.

Whoever this ‘Kacchan’ was, Shouta knew that this was one child he did not want near Izuku or his self-esteem. Even now, even after nearly two years of not being in contact with this ‘Kacchan’ character, Izuku was still influenced by his words.

Kids could be cruel.

He knew this.

Though his parents had been supportive of him as far as he could remember, public school had been a chore to get through even as he rebuffed insults and nasty looks once people found out about his quirk.

Izuku wasn’t like him though.

He wasn’t able to just brush away another person’s words like he had done.

“You never were one in the first place.”

Shouta made sure his tone was firm, delivering his reply in a way that couldn’t be argued with. Because he knew from Izuku’s mulish expression that he wanted to, badly.

“You were Quirkless, true,” He reached out to tap at Izuku’s nose, cutting him off before he could say anything, “But that doesn’t mean you were useless.” Izuku wrinkled his nose at him, though he did look less likely to try to argue with him now, “You were only a kid, Izuku, and you still are.”

“But we’re both kids though,” A small shrug completed Izuku’s reply, “And he did everything better than everyone else.” There was a hint of admiration in his voice, even as he spoke about this kid that apparently rallied everyone else against him, “Kacchan has such a cool quirk too.”

“Oh?”

“It’s called Explosion,” Izuku raised a fist up, then snapped out his fingers in one quick motion, “It goes boom! Like fireworks!”

Or like sputtering oil in a pan too, he’d bet.

“He’s gonna become a hero with that quirk.”

That honestly sounded like a horrible idea to him.

“Well this ‘Kacchan’ better shape up if he wants to be a hero,” Shouta hummed, “He doesn’t sound like he’d make a nice one.” Granted, this was a kid he was talking about and a kid's behavior was subject to change at a moment's notice, "The hero industry isn't kind to heroes that have no self-regard for others."

Not even Endeavor, by far the least amiable of this country’s pro heroes, would act like that to civilians.

"Well, Kacchan isn't nice," Izuku frowned, "But he's got a powerful quirk, perfect for heroics."

"Is he someone that you'd trust to save you though?"

Izuku froze at his question, eyes wide.

"Is he someone that you'd feel safe around?"

Shouta watched as his son rubbed at his forearm, seemingly not noticing the action even as he clenched a shaking fist.

"Kacchan hurt me," As he suspected, but it was good to have confirmation and a solid reason beyond 'he called Izuku names' for him to reject this kid coming into any potential contact with Izuku, "And he hurt other kids too."

"That was wrong of him," He gentled his tone, pushing as much of Hizashi as he could into it, "It was wrong for him to hurt you, and to hurt others like that."

"Friends aren't supposed to hurt you," Izuku looked conflicted even as he continued to speak, "They're supposed to play and have fun with you." He finished with a whisper, "Having friends is supposed to be nice."

There really was something to be said about explosion or blast-related quirk users and his sheer distaste for their personalities.

"Then I don't think this 'Kacchan' is your friend," Shouta was sure that Izuku realized this already, but he wanted to reinforce this, wanted to make sure that Izuku had absolutely no doubt about it, “And that’s fine too, alright?”

The nod that Izuku gave him looked more confident this time.

Good.

Izuku deserved better than this… ‘Kacchan.’

“I still wanna invite Nedzu-san though.”

To be fair, it wasn’t as if he was completely against the idea of Nedzu attending Izuku’s birthday celebration. They did get along well and Nedzu always treated Izuku with a certain respect he didn’t even afford some of his previous students at times.

This was still the principal of U.A. though.

He supposed they were lucky that Izuku’s birthday fell right before summer break. Finals would be over for the most part so it was possible that Nedzu might even have some spare time for this special event.

"We can send it back with the drone," That thing had overstayed its welcome, staying in sentry mode on their balcony for a majority of the time instead of returning to U.A., "I'm sure he'll appreciate both your invitation and his drone back."

"I hope Nedzu-san can come," Izuku murmured, waiting as he input the code for the safe, sliding the invitation in once it opened, "I wanna thank him for helping us."

Shouta watched as he patted the drone on top of it's sleek exterior.

"Bring this to Nedzu-san safely, okay?"

The drone beeped an affirmative before slowly rising, nearly silent in it’s takeoff, then speeding off in the direction of U.A.

Izuku waved until it was out of sight.

He hoped that Nedzu would take in account Izuku’s feelings should he be unable to attend. Izuku’s disappointment would undoubtedly be unmeasurable if his first new friend in over a year let him down.

Both Hizashi and Tensei had mentioned the idea to him already, but it really would be nice for Izuku to have someone his own age to bond and play with. Nedzu was many things, but a playmate for Izuku, he was not.

Tensei’s brother, Tenya, was the logical option here. He was both close in age to Izuku and well-mannered to boot, so Izuku likely wouldn’t pick up anything unsavory from him.

(It wasn’t as if Tenya could do anything beyond what Izuku had likely witnessed before on the streets, so it was fine. Or it was as fine as it could be, for now.)

“Izuku?”

“Mm?”

“How do you feel about meeting Tensei’s brother?”

    Hello, Nedzu-san!

    My birthday is coming soon on July 15th.

    If you aren’t super busy, can you come to my party?

    There is going to be yummy cake!

    From,

Chapter Text

Hizashi was nervous.

He had a lot to be nervous about considering what was happening this afternoon.

After a considerable amount of planning, they had decided that it was high time Izuku and Tenya met.

Izuku had already asked that his birthday be kept a private affair, with the exception of Nedzu, but had agreed to meet Tenya to “see if he was nice or not."

(Shouta had told him about Izuku's Kacchan, told him of what Izuku's friend situation had been like before meeting the two of them. It baffled him, how someone as sweet as Izuku didn't have any good friends. But this 'Kacchan' sure had to be a character, to say the least. And he was one he absolutely didn't want Izuku around. Thankfully he and Shouta were in full agreement for this. No Kacchans allowed.)

Tensei had proposed a neutral location for this meeting over the weekend: a playground that they had never visited. It was a good idea, one he agreed with even though there was a high probability that a bug or ten might invite themselves to this outing without his consent.

While they could have invited Tenya over to their place, there was a very distinct possibility that Izuku would have been on the defensive the entire time he was there. He had barely tolerated Tsukauchi, Nemuri, or Tensei coming over. And just the other day, the social workers they had talked with had been met with a quick glare before being ignored the rest of the time they were there unless there were questions being posed to him.

(Though it was worse with other birds. Izuku would keep a constant watch out on the balcony if he was in the living room, scaring them away if they were anywhere near. At least he didn’t have to worry about any bird shit anymore, yeah?)

It just wasn’t a good idea for them to meet in what Izuku perceived as his territory, especially if they wanted the two of them to have a chance of befriending one another without any previous influence. The change in location might even throw Izuku off enough so that he wouldn’t stock up on preconceived notions.

Don’t get him wrong, he wanted Izuku to have a friend his age, but he also knew that forcing interaction between two kids could also do the complete opposite of what he wanted. There was also the fact that Izuku did not trust easily, so he wouldn’t be surprised if they didn’t get along. But that was alright; that was something that could change.

As long as they didn’t outright hate or develop an immediate distaste for each other, a friendship between the two could be slowly fostered. It would be good if they got along, since they were all good friends, but it wasn’t a requirement; he had told Izuku this on their walk to the playground, reminding him that no matter what happened, they’d still care for and love him.

Izuku did look more confident hearing that, even starting to swing their held hands as they neared their destination.

He had the absolute cutest son on the planet, he was sure of it.

It didn't take long for them to arrive.

The first thing he did was find a nice bench under the shade of a tree and place his bag down, desperately pushing away the thoughts of any bugs falling off the branches above them and onto his bag, or even himself. Fucking horrifying thoughts, these were.

The second thing he did was look up at the call of his name. Tensei was waving to him by the entrance of the playground, having just arrived with Tenya in hand.

Izuku latched onto his leg, peering out from behind him, clearly still high-strung about meeting someone new. The vice grip on his leg was ample evidence.

"Yo, Hizashi, Izuku-kun," Tensei greeted them as they neared, a grin on his face, "You're early."

"You are too," He shot back as he settled a comforting hand onto Izuku's head, patting his curls, inwardly cooing as his son leaned into his touch, "It wasn't too much trouble to get time off for this, was it?"

"My parents are big fans of this whole idea," He chuckled sheepishly, "They practically shoved me out of the agency."

"Mother and Father would never be as improper as to shove you out, nii-san!" Tenya spoke suddenly, his voice startling Izuku, "They only have the utmost love and respect for you!"

“Uh huh,” Tensei said in a teasing tone, “And you’re sure that’s not what you think instead?”

Hizashi resisted the urge to laugh as Tenya sputtered, not denying anything.

"Come on, Tenya," As he nudged him forward, Tensei took the opportunity to also place his bag onto the bench, "Introduce yourself to Izuku-kun."

"I'm Iida Tenya!" Tenya enthusiastically obliged his brother's request, curtly bowing, "It's a pleasure to meet you!"

To Izuku's credit, his grip didn't tighten, though they didn’t exactly loosen either. There was a beat of silence before Izuku responded.

"I'm… I'm Aizawa Izuku," Izuku replied, voice a stark difference to Tenya's in both delivery and volume, following it up with a returned bow, "Nice to meet you too."

He wanted to scream so badly!

Izuku had introduced himself with his new name! Somehow that made it seem all the more real despite the proverbial ink already being dried on the adoption forms.

"Would you like me to call you 'Aizawa-kun'?" Tenya asked, "Or would you prefer something else?"

Blinking, Izuku pursed his lips as he thought for a moment before finally replying.

"Izuku is fine," He nodded, "'Aizawa-kun' is my dad."

Well that was how Nedzu referred to Shouta, wasn't it?

(And it would probably be how he was supposed to be referred to as well, except that Nedzu had the common courtesy to not drop that sort of information all willy-nilly like that. Small mercies.)

Izuku seemed to realize what he said, fingers digging into his leg in what he was sure was embarrassment. Before he could ask him to ease his grip, Izuku let go, choosing to hug his leg instead, mashing his face into his side.

So fucking cute.

It was a pity that Shouta wasn't here to hear this, but it was fine! He planned on having a very elaborate retelling of Izuku's outing happening over dinner tonight.

"Izuku-kun then!" Tenya confirmed with a nod, "You may call me Tenya, if you'd like."

"Ten-ya," Hizashi watched as Izuku detached himself from his leg, repeating the name a few times before finally seeming to come to a decision on something, taking in a breath before asking with an undercurrent of nervousness in his voice, "Do you wanna go play? With me?"

"Of course!"

Izuku's eyes shone with an unmistakable delight at the reply, and Hizashi was glad to see Tenya grin in response as well.

"Go on then," He waved in the general direction of the nearest jungle gym, "Stay close though, yeah?" Waiting until the both of them nodded their agreement, he quickly checked that it really wasn't that far from them. He had the advantage of long legs and Tensei had his quirk; they would be able to get over there in jiffy if they were needed for any possible reason, "Alright, off you go, you two! Play nice!"

Watching Izuku and Tenya immediately run to the jungle gym, starting to climb in what seemingly seemed like an unspoken challenge to one-up each other in getting to the top first, he finally relaxed a smidge. They seemed like they were having a good time, Izuku climbing with the same type of focus he used for mimicking the warm-up stretches that Shouta did before leaving for his patrols: very seriously.

He whipped out his phone and snapped a few photos, changing angles every few seconds. These were photos he definitely wanted to share with Shouta; this was a milestone after all! And if these came out nice, he’d forward them to Tensei as well.

“I’m glad they seem to be getting along,” Tensei murmured, sounding relieved, “I honestly wasn’t sure if they would.”

“Oh?” Hizashi hummed as he sat down, pocketing his phone and then swinging an arm over the back of the bench, "And why's that?" He swung his gaze over at the two children still climbing before giving Tensei a raised eyebrow, "Tenya's a good kid."

"He is," Tensei sat as well, leaning forward with his elbows propped on his knees, "And don’t get me wrong, I love my brother to bits.” He sighed, hanging his head, “But he doesn’t really get along with kids his age.”

Hizashi watched as Tensei groaned.

“He’s a good kid, but he’s a bit zealous in his actions,” He winced before correcting himself, “Very zealous in his actions.”

“A bit of zeal never hurt anyone,” He pointed out, “Means he’s passionate!”

“He also has no friends because of this.”

“Not even at school?”

“Especially not at school.”

Tensei turned to look at the dumbfound look he knew was on his face, before giving him a halfhearted shrug.

“Tenya’s got a rather rigid sense of right or wrong and he doesn’t hesitate to let others know his opinion.”

Ah.

Hizashi turned his gaze back over to the two kids, who were both, thankfully, still on the jungle gym, taking turns on the slide before climbing back up.

Tensei’s words made him a bit nervous honestly.

He kinda wished that this had been brought up before this whole planned outing, but he could also see why Tensei hadn’t mentioned anything, likely wanting his brother to have a fair chance of befriending Izuku.

But if he thought about it, Izuku hadn’t had any friends his age in a while as well. Everyone he had met ever since he had started living as an owl were all adults, with the exception of the student that Nedzu had introduced to him. Even so, Tatsuma had at least nine or ten years over Izuku.

Izuku was fairly mature, likely influenced by the company he usually kept.

Perhaps they had nothing to worry about after all?

He hoped so.

It was going better than expected.

Izuku raised his hands in silent victory as he reached the top of the slide again, immediately sitting down, allowing himself to slide down in the spiral shape the slide was in.

The playground near his old home only had the straight ones so it was a fun experience to try this one out.

Tenya was good about taking turns as well, always letting him go ahead of him if he had already taken a turn but had climbed up to reach the slide faster than he did.

And he was fast.

Longer legs and a quirk like Iida-san’s meant that Tenya was built to go fast. Just like how his bones meant he was built to be an owl; they were owl bones after all.

Usually he ended up with Tenya waiting patiently behind him, but when the opposite happened, he'd take the opportunity to glance over at his Papa. It wasn't that he thought that his Papa might forget him at the playground, going back home without him, but it made him feel better to know that he was still there, even giving him a small wave if their gazes happened to meet.

It made him feel warm inside when his Papa would give him a wave back.

Sadly, there were only so many times he could go down the slide without eventually starting to feel dizzy, the spiral shape of it not helping at all.

He didn't exactly want to be sick either, so instead of going down the slide one last time, he went in the other direction, finding a ledge to sit down on, hoping that the dizziness would go away on it’s own.

"Are you feeling alright, Izuku-kun?" Tenya's voice came from behind him; had he followed him up here instead of taking his turn on the slide? "Do you need some water?"

"The slide made me a bit dizzy," He replied, keeping his tone even, careful to not let his voice slip into a whine, "'Cause you go in circles when you go down."

To his amazement, Tenya didn't laugh at him or call him a baby, only nodding in what could only be in agreement.

"Yes, it is like when you spin in too many circles."

Exactly!

Though he did like closing his eyes and relaxing against one of his dads after a quick bout of spinning. The world would be wibbly-wobbly at first, but the sensation of it calming back down was nice. And sometimes he could even get a nap out of it. Napping with the warmth of one of his dads there was the absolute best.

"I'm going to get some water," Tenya announced; Izuku could hear him heading back down, "It is important to stay hydrated, especially during the summer!"

Izuku knew he wasn't very thirsty at the moment, so he decided to hold off on getting water, taking this time to observe Tenya instead.

He knew that Tenya's quirk was called 'Engine', just like Iida-san's. It was a speed type mutation quirk mostly located on his calves. From what he could see, at least.

Tenya was nice though.

Definitely nicer than any other kid his age that he had known in daycare or had met at the park.

Maybe… Just maybe, Tenya would want to be friends with him.

That wasn't asking too much was it?

Or should he wait longer to decide?

He swung his legs a bit as he thought, careful not to kick the sliding pole in front of him. It was made of metal and he didn't want to hurt his toes.

"Izuku-kun!"

Looking up at the call of his name, he saw Tenya running over to him with an uncapped bottle of water in his hand.

"I've brought you water as well!"

Watching from where he was sitting, it was easy to notice Tenya rushing forward in a dash of sudden speed.

That had to be Engine at work.

Going fast was a pretty nice quirk, and considering the Iida family ran a hero agency, it was definitely a helpful one.

However, Izuku could only watch with wide eyes as Tenya didn't stop or slow down, running right into the pole in front of him. He yelped as he was knocked backwards and onto the ground, his glasses clattering onto the ground. Water sprayed upwards, soaking both of them.

It happened so quickly that Tenya was already splayed out on his back before he could react.

Was he alright?

That looked like it had hurt!

Getting hit in the face sucked!

(Even though there was a pretty big difference between getting punched in the face compared to running full speed into something, it was still getting hit in the face!)

He craned his head, trying to see if there was any blood visible, but he was glad to note that there was none.

"Tenya?!"

Iida-san sounded horrified, already on his feet, an odd car-like sound coming from his arms.

Fast.

If he thought Tenya was fast, then his big brother was even faster. He was already zooming from the bench to where they were, leaving his Papa to run after him seconds later.

"Ouch.."

Izuku perked up at Tenya's voice. He wasn't unconscious; that was good. That meant he didn't hit his head as hard as Eraserhead would hit the criminals that liked to touch people. That type of hard-hitting meant that they wouldn’t be getting up for a while and he’d like for Tenya to be able to get up again.

“Are you okay?”

He asked, slightly worried that his new potential friend could be hurt.

Bracing himself against the pole in front of him, he leaned a bit of his weight into it, wanting to get a better look at his playmate.

It occurred to him once he finally got a good look at Tenya, who was still on his back, dazed and staring up at the sky.

The pole was wet.

And wet things were slippery.

Izuku shrieked.

A whooshing feeling washed over him, not unlike the feeling he got when he took off from ledges, falling for a split second before smoothing out to a glide.

Izuku spread his wings out instinctively, knowing that he would be fine.

He was an owl.

Owls could fly.

"Izuku!"

Hitting something hard, he quickly realized that he was not fine.

"Izuku-kun?!" Iida-san's voice was real up close now, "Tenya!" He was hovering over them both, clearly very worried, "Are you two alright?"

"I'm okay," Tenya groaned, even as he rolled himself onto his stomach and pushed himself back up, "Just a small bump, nii-san."

"'Zuku!" His Papa slid to a stop next to Iida-san, already falling onto his knees and helping him up, "Are you okay?"

"Nothing's broken," He declared after a few seconds of waiting; surely he'd know if something was broken. Bone breaking was supposed to be painful and he wasn't exactly in too much pain. This didn't even hurt more than Kacchan's explosions! "I'm okay."

"Oh, Izuku," His Papa's green eyes filled with relief, his arms pulling him into a tight hug, "That's good."

Izuku wasn't one to ever refuse a hug from someone he cared about, so he accepted it, even returning the hug, shaking arms and all.

He tried to pat his Papa's back, copying what he knew was supposed to be a good way to comfort somebody else.

"Oh, 'Zuku," His Papa murmured, finally loosening up on his hug, hands tracing the lines of his face before examining each limb, fingers lightly pressing the entire time, "You're sure nothing hurts?" He asked, lips pulled into a small frown, "Just what could have possessed you to let go like that?"

The question was asked so quietly that Izuku wasn’t even sure he was supposed to have heard it.

"Only a little bit."

Izuku admitted, doing his best to not wince at the dull pain in his palms and knees. Not to even mention his nose.

"And I… I forgot I wasn't an owl."

His face warmed as he remembered why he did, indeed, let go. It hadn't even really been a conscious decision he made; it had just seemed to be the right one at that moment.

He had wanted to fly.

And he had thought that he could.

But he couldn't.

Aizawa Izuku was a human right now.

Not an owl.

Tears came to his eyes, and he didn't even bother trying to rub them away, hiccupping and allowing them to fall.

He wanted to be an owl again!

This wasn't fair.

He wanted to so badly.

It just wasn't fair!

"'Zuku?" His Papa sounded even more worried now, "Izuku!" Frantic as well, "Does it hurt? Tell me where it hurts."

Of course he felt bad for making his Papa worry so much about him, but he wasn't sure if this was something even his Papa could fix with a bandaid and hugs.

Could you even put a bandaid on your heart?


Izuku didn't know how long he had stood there and cried, both voice and tears swallowed by the embrace of his Papa's arms, a comforting hand smoothing itself down his back.

As his tears finally came to a slow stop, leaving him hiccuping, he heard Tenya’s voice. He looked up at his current playmate, curious about what he possibly could want right now.

“Izuku-kun?” Tenya stepped forward, glasses crooked on his face, the connecting piece a bit funnily shaped due to crashing into the metal pole; it was only logical that it be the reason for this, “Are you alright?”

“I dunno…” He sniffled, blowing his nose into the tissue that his Papa pulled out of his pocket and offered him, “I just wanna be an owl again, and I forgot I wasn’t an owl right now and it hurts.”

Tenya blinked at him.

Oh, right.

He didn’t know about his quirk.

Neither did Iida-san, if he thought about it.

As he opened his mouth to explain, Tenya cut him off, hand swinging down in a chopping motion.

“If you want to be an owl, Izuku-kun,” He declared even as Iida-san watched them, mouthing the word ‘owl’ to himself, “Then I support you! I believe you can do it!”

“Really?”

“Yes!”

“Really, really?”

“Yes, really!”

“Papa, did you hear that?” He grinned up at his Papa, tears forgotten, “Tenya says I can be an owl!”

“Yes, I heard,” His Papa replied a bit faintly before murmuring, “Man, I need to sit down.”

As he said that, he sank down onto the ground, crossing his legs as he took a seat right there.

He was gonna get his pants dirty.

What a silly man his Papa was.

Chapter Text

Izuku woke up excited.

It was his birthday today!

He was now eight whole years old.

Even though he knew that, being eight didn't exactly feel much different from being six, or even seven. He still wasn't any taller sadly, and he didn't know how to suddenly do taxes overnight.

As he changed out of his pajamas, he wondered if that was one of the things that Nedzu-san would teach him.

(Taxes seemed pretty hard to do though; he wasn't sure he'd be able to learn how to do it if it was supposed to be an 'adult thing.' He would just have to leave it up to his dads for now.)

He really was excited about getting to learn from Nedzu-san—or would he be Nedzu-sensei now? Probably later, he decided, when he was actually starting school again.

His Papa had called learning from Nedzu-san "a wonderful opportunity that should be taken advantage of".

His Dad, on the other hand, just asked him really nicely to not to pay attention to Nedzu-san if he started talking about world do-mi-na-tion in his lessons.

It meant taking over the world, his Dad had further explained. And it also meant a lot of responsibilities and learning about how governments worked. Izuku wasn't even sure his head could fit in that much information after learning other school things from Nedzu-san, so he had agreed to not get involved in anything like that.

Besides, he had other, more important, things to worry about.

Like using his quirk.

Changing out of his pajamas, he started getting ready for breakfast, excited for what today would have in store for him.

The scent of the miso soup that was being made in the kitchen made his mouth water, and while he was tempted to go and get a closer look at it, he knew he had to go brush his teeth first.

(Owls didn’t have teeth to brush, but humans absolutely did.)

He really did like the pancakes they had on his Papa’s birthday, but nothing could really never beat a good bowl of miso soup, especially if it was his Dad’s. So when they had asked him what he’d like to have for breakfast on his birthday, he had told them that what they usually had was fine.

His Aizawa-san had initially raised an eyebrow at his request, but had nodded with a soft smile. On the other hand, his Papa had asked him further if he was sure he wanted something they already had pretty much all the time.

“We could have omelets, ‘Zuku!” His Papa had shown him a picture of one on his phone, “I make a mean omelet!” Swiping the screen of his phone, he showed him more pictures of breakfast sets with omelets, “With bacon! Or sausages!”

“But I like miso soup, Papa,” He continued to watch his Papa flick through the photos; admittedly, the food in those photos did look very tasty, “And there’s gonna be rice, fish, and tamagoyaki.”

“Well, if it’s what you like, then I guess there’s no other option,” Grinning, his Papa had given him a pat on the head, showing him that he wasn’t upset or anything about his choice, “Shouta’s cooking really is so good, yeah?”

“Mm!”

Brushing his teeth didn’t take long, so before he knew it, he had finished. And after a quick wash of his face with his towel, he was ready for the day.

His dads were already awake and in the kitchen.

They always managed to wake up earlier than him even though he was sure that they got less sleep than he did. He really hoped that they got enough sleep; being tired wasn’t exactly his idea of fun.

“Morning, ‘Zuku!” His Papa looked up at his arrival, eyes bright, “Excited for today?”

“Good timing, Izuku,” His Dad walked in, placing down a wooden tray onto the table, “Let’s have breakfast.”

As soon as Izuku tasted the first spoonful of miso soup, he knew that he had made a good decision. Warm, delicious, and filled with love—that was his Aizawa-san’s soup.

Breakfast went by quickly, bowls and plates getting emptied and then being brought over to the sink. However, he still wasn’t allowed to help with the dishes in any way, so he guessed that being eight years old was still too young for that.

It was fine, he decided, as he sat down on the living room couch after pulling out a book from the bookshelf. He could help out in other ways around here. Dishes weren't his only option.

Izuku flipped open the book, the bright pictures of assorted animals meeting his gaze. This specific book was one he went through nearly every day, so much so that his Papa jokingly called it his favorite. His Dad though, he always had a small sad look on his face as he watched him turn to the pages about owls.

"It's a work in progress, Izuku," He would say, hand covering his own as he traced the lines of the eurasian eagle owl featured there, "You're doing so well already."

Doing well was good and all, but if he was doing well, why couldn't he turn into an owl already?

'Patience.'

His Dad liked that word, saying it was one of the most important things anyone could hope to have.

It meant waiting.

Izuku knew he was pretty good at waiting. He had learned to be patient when he was hunting for food. Timing was very important even though he flew almost silently, his prey rarely even knowing he was there until the very last moments when his talons were wrapped around its body and squeezing.

When the struggling stopped, body going limp in his grip, he knew that being patient was well worth it.

It had kept him safe and fed.

And most importantly, It had kept him alive until he met his dads.

Izuku didn't know how long he had spent on the couch by himself, slowly turning the pages of the book. If he had spent more time lingering on certain pages, well, his dads didn't need to know that.

The pictures of rats or pigeons weren't as good as the real thing, being only made of ink and the paper they were printed on, no heartbeat to be heard. After all, nothing could beat tearing into something warm with his beak. But this would have to do for now since he wasn't allowed to have any city rats or pigeons.

It was a bit weird, he knew.

He had just had breakfast not long ago, but he still felt hunger from somewhere. It couldn't be from his human stomach, so it had to be from his quirk, right? Could quirks even have separate stomachs?

It didn’t matter in the end.

All he knew was that when he managed to turn back into an owl, hunting something down to eat would have to be one of the first things he did.

"'Zuku!"

Izuku looked up in time just to see his Papa sweep into the living room, eyes quickly darting to the picture of the hamster he was currently looking at, before a crooked grin appeared on his face.

"Looking at your favorite book again?"

He nodded, finger tracing the shape of the hamster on the page. Hamsters were ro-dents, like rats and mice. They weren't something he had tried before, but he was always open to new snack ideas. These seemed to be already a good size to be considered a snack. Plus, he was pretty sure they didn't count as animals living in the city, (they lived in pet stores!), so they should be alright for him to have.

"You sure you don't wanna invite Tenya over?" His Papa asked, interrupting his thoughts about swallowing hamsters whole, "If you invite him now, he can still arrive in time for lunch."

Izuku shook his head.

It wasn't that he didn't like Tenya; he actually enjoyed playing with him a lot! He was really good at making car sounds and having Tenya chase him around was actually fun, unlike how Kacchan used to do it.

He remembered feeling pain when getting caught, blisters and burns appearing where Kacchan would slam his palm down on bare skin.

And Kacchan would always catch him.

Their games weren’t always too bad though.

Even though he had been quirkless, because of the slight mutation Hisashi had passed down onto him, hotter temperatures never affected him as much as it did others, his own being higher than average as well. He would still get hurt, but it wasn’t as bad as it could have been if it were one of his classmates getting hit instead.

For him, just knowing that was enough.

It was better that less people get hurt, right?

And well, he didn't think that Tenya would act like Kacchan, but there was a small part of him that was still afraid that if he had asked Tenya to come, he would have laughed at him and refused.

(That was what Kacchan had done the last time he had invited him over for his birthday, after all.)

But this was alright.

Spending his birthday with just his dads was something he wanted too. And plus, Nedzu-san would be coming later, so it wasn’t as if he had no friends coming over.

"Well, we've got a while until lunch," His Papa sneaked a peek at the clock, "Anything you wanna do?"

Izuku only hummed, thinking of the eyebags both his dads sported, of how little sleep they must get due to both working and also taking care of him at the same time.

"Can we nap until lunch?"

If they wouldn't sleep more on their own, then at least today, he could get them a couple more hours.

"A nap?" His Papa sounded surprised, "Did you not get enough sleep again?"

He shrugged, leaning his head against his Papa's side, eyes already sliding half shut. Nighttime was still what he preferred, so he was definitely guilty of staying up a bit more than his dads probably wanted.

"Oh, 'Zuku," His Papa cooed, shifting his arm to go around his shoulders so he could snuggle against him, "Just a short one, alright?"

A short one was better than no nap at all, so he tapped his Papa’s arm with a 'yes.'

"Nap time and not talk time, huh?" Chuckling, his Papa took his glasses off, placing them on the coffee table before stretching out on the couch, dragging him into his arms, "Sweet dreams, Izuku."

Izuku could feel his lips curl into a small smile, head resting against his Papa's heart, the reassuring thump-thump immediately making him feel at ease.

He was sure he would have sweet dreams.

With his Papa right there, how could he not?

Shouta always felt more comfortable with a knife in his hand.

It didn’t matter if it was the knife he took with him on patrols or one of the many that he kept in the kitchen. It just had to be in his possession.

The kitchen happened to be where he spent a fair amount of time, so it was only logical that he keep his domain well stocked in weaponry.

So it was with a knife in hand that he realized that it had gone quiet in the living room. It wasn’t completely out of the ordinary, but with Hizashi at home, it certainly was a rarity. Even if Hizashi didn’t mean to, he always ended up tapping his feet or humming some song under his breath. He wasn’t what anyone would call a quiet person.

Izuku, on the other hand, tended to be more quiet, though he did have his moments. Singing the English alphabet song with Hizashi, for example. He even semi-shouted his English if he wasn't making an effort to be quiet. Entirely Hizashi's fault, really.

He was also remarkably good at staying in one place, barely fidgeting while staring out the balcony doors.

It made sense for that though.

Eurasian eagle owls were sedentary creatures, preferring to stay in the one place they deemed their territory. It was highly likely those instincts had stayed with Izuku even as a human.

Honestly, there was a fair amount of owl instincts that Izuku still had.

Though, Shouta knew he would be a happy man if Izuku never asked him if they could stop by a pet store for snacks or for something along those lines. Because somehow, he felt like that was in the distinct realm of possibility. There already was an awful lot of staring coming from Izuku every time they passed any pet store, so it was just a matter of time before he’d pop that question to one of them.

(Would it be better for Hizashi to get asked? Or would it be better if that question was directed to him? Well, either way, he knew it would be an awkward conversation.)

Chop.

Chop.

His knife slid through the cucumbers with ease, slicing them into neat thin sticks, perfect for what he was planning for lunch. There was already a platter filled with all the ingredients he had already prepared earlier in the day.

He had already asked Izuku about what ingredients to use, not wanting to add ones that he didn’t like, but Izuku had solemnly told him that he loved all the food he made.

(Did it count if the takuan was made by his mother? He hoped so.)

Those words had warmed his heart, but they did not solve his dilemma with what ingredients to serve for their temaki sushi party. In the end, he had gone with the basics that he knew he enjoyed having as a child, memories of his mother preparing the same meal playing through his mind the entire time.

It was nothing too fancy, unlike the elaborate platters his mother had enjoyed creating, but it was still nice and filled with ingredients he knew that even if Izuku didn’t eat, Hizashi and he would, so nothing would go to waste. If there happened to be any leftovers, he could use them later for dinner.

By the time he finished with the preparations for lunch, it was no longer as quiet as it had been earlier.

He could hear the cadence of Hizashi’s soft snores, bringing a smile to his lips.

Were they napping?

Possible.

Izuku did enjoy a mid-morning nap at times, especially if he hadn’t gotten enough rest the night before.

Had he been kept up with the anticipation for his birthday?

It was logical to assume that.

With how mature Izuku tended to act around them, it was easy to forget he was only a child as well. He supposed it was good that he was acting this way around them. It was because Izuku trusted them that he knew he could act like his own age without repercussions again.

It meant that they were doing something right.

With a final pressed chop to the seaweed sheets, splitting them into halves, he ran his knife under water, washing and drying it carefully before placing it far from where small curious hands could and would reach.

If Izuku was tired, then he could take another hour or so for his nap.

As for Hizashi, he deserved to get a bit more sleep as well. Shouta knew that he had been working a lot recently, wanting to get ahead in what he could so he could comfortably take the entire day off for Izuku’s birthday.

He was a bit lucky there, considering he was able to pick and choose his own hours for patrol most of the time. Underground heroes tended to have more flexible hours, even able to choose the route they took. Becoming predictable had killed more than one of them, so he made sure to stay away from any discernible patterns.

As Hizashi and Izuku napped, he took the initiative to decorate a bit.

(He did snap a photo of Hizashi’s drooling face though. He loved him, drool and all, but it was still a funny sight.)

Before long, he decided that yes, this was enough for decorations.

It was more than they had for Hizashi’s recent birthday, admittedly, but still not a lot. Definitely nothing like the images he had seen online when searching for examples of birthday parties aimed for children.

They did have these round owl balloons though.

Hizashi had stumbled across them while picking up some streamers and banners. He had texted him immediately, asking for Izuku’s location at home, wanting to know if it was possible to sneak them into their bedroom so that Izuku wouldn’t see them before his birthday. In the end, they had allowed Izuku to nap a few more minutes while Hizashi hugged the balloons to his chest and ran down the hallway into their bedroom and shoved them into their closet.

It was worth it though.

They were pretty adorable with their big eyes.

(They reminded him of his favorite clothing brand, in a way.)

He was sure Izuku would like them.

Carefully tying their ribbons to the back of his chair, he finished it with a neat bow, shifting it around until it looked nicer and more natural instead of being tied by a man trained in the creation of assorted knots.

With that done, he slipped into his and Hizashi's bedroom in search of the cake topper that they had custom-made for Izuku's birthday gift.

Thankfully, Hizashi was relatively organized, and especially so if he was overthinking things to an extreme degree. And due to that, all the presents dropped off for Izuku's birthday were placed in the English alphabetical order of the names of the gifters.

Thankfully 'Aizawa' was the first of the bunch of gifts there.

From an initial glance, he could see that both Nemuri, and the Iida brothers had gotten something for Izuku.

He hoped that Nemuri knew better than to get anything inappropriate for an eight year old. If she didn't, well, she would regret it. He would make her regret it.

Tensei and Tenya’s present wasn’t one he worried about; from the shape, he could deduce it was likely a book. Izuku would like that.

The last one there was Tsukauchi’s.

This one had been a surprise to receive, Tsukauchi handing it to him after their meeting with a sheepish smile, asking if he could pass this to Izuku on his birthday.

“Not going to hand it to him yourself?” He had asked, taking the wrapped box, “I’m sure Izuku would appreciate it.”

“I’m afraid he doesn’t quite like me, still,” Tsukauchi had given him a shrug, “It’s understandable.” Turning to pick up his cup of coffee, he took a sip out of it before looking forlornly at the dregs left on the bottom, “I just want him to have a nice birthday. He deserves that much after everything that happened.”

He had a good point, so he had agreed to pass on the gift to Izuku on his birthday. It was a good first step to earning Izuku’s favor, he had to admit. If Izuku liked whatever it was in that box, they might very well be seeing Tsukauchi much more often rather than just seeing him in the capacity of his job.

Shouta then picked up the small box that housed his and Hizashi’s joint present, opening it to reveal it’s contents.

Painted green eyes stared up at him, the owl that they belonged to snuggled up close to a black cat and a sulfur-crested cockatoo. It was beautifully made, the craftsman that they had commissioned having a well-earned reputation and decades of experience.

Taking it with him to the kitchen, he quickly put the last finishing touches on the cake chilling in the refrigerator, topping it with the fresh berries that Hizashi had purchased early that morning.

He checked on the sushi rice and the tamagoyaki he had left cooling on the counter.

Everything looked good, so he plated up the tamagoyaki after slicing it into neat strips, placing it in it's own neat pile next to the other ingredients.

He took a deep breath afterwards, going through his mental checklist, pleased when everything he had wanted to do was checked off.

It was time to wake Hizashi and Izuku up.

Hizashi was a light sleeper, so he had already blinked his eyes open with a single nudge at his shoulder. Izuku was a different story, obviously wanting to nap for longer. He had even snapped his teeth at him when he had tried to poke him in the cheek, a small revenge for that other day when he had gotten poked in the nose.

Izuku took a few minutes to wake up properly, but had quickly noticed the changes in his surroundings, head turning to look at the streamers he had hung strategically.

“Decorated when we napped, huh, Shou?” Hizashi sent him a lopsided grin even as he sat up, stretching out his arms, “Looks good!”

“I like it!” Izuku chirped as he mimicked Hizashi’s actions, “The colors are nice!”

Shouta had just used yellow and black, the exact colors that Izuku had chosen for his candles. He guessed that Izuku really did like those colors. That was good. He and Hizashi both enjoyed those colors as well.

“I’m glad,” He bent down slightly, ruffling Izuku’s curls, “I’ve already got lunch set up, so are you ready for some sushi?”

Izuku bounced right off of Hizashi’s lap in excitement hearing that, grabbing a few of his fingers, pulling him in the direction of the kitchen.

He allowed himself to be dragged, getting a front row seat of Izuku seeing the owl balloons tied to his chair. His eyes went wide and he dashed forward, nearly tripping over his chair in his hurry to get to the balloons.

Pop

Ah.

Izuku jumped at the sound of the bursting balloon, the shreds falling from his hands and onto the floor, his nails visibly sharp, akin to talons.

His quirk again?

“It wasn’t a real owl?”

Izuku asked, confused, voice still slurred with sleep, just as Hizashi rushed into the kitchen, glasses crooked on his face.

“Is everything okay?!”

“I thought there were owls but they weren’t real owls,” Izuku explained, blinking up at him before staring up at Hizashi, “This one popped.”

“Careful with your nails, Izuku,” He murmured, lightly grabbing a clawed hand before it ended up scratching up his face in an attempt to rub away any lingering sleepiness, “Your quirk seems to have activated again.”

“But it’s lunch time!” Izuku looked vaguely distressed, looking at his hands and then turning to check his back, “Owls can’t eat sushi!”

“Can you change back?” Hizashi asked, voice taking on a soothing tone, “Relax, ‘Zuku,” He knelt down, taking Izuku’s other hand, “If you can’t, we do have Shouta here, remember?”

A few minutes passed as Izuku closed his eyes, peeking at his fingers every so often, grumbling when there was no change.

“Can you use Erasure, please?”

He finally asked, showing him his hands, the sharp black nails showing no signs of changing back without outside help.

“Of course,” Nodding, he allowed his quirk to bleed through, his hair going weightless for a moment before dropping back down when he deactivated it, “There you go.”

“Thanks, Dad!”

Izuku shot him a big grin, seeing his nails back to normal, then turned to pull the other balloon down, examining it.

“The balloon’s cute,” He remarked, “Sorry I popped the other one.”

Had he heard correctly?

Did Izuku really call him ‘Dad’?

He glanced over at Hizashi, who was already sniffling and shooting him a thumbs up.

Fuck.

He was ‘Dad’ now.

Lunch passed like a dream.

The hand rolls were a big hit, Izuku even creating a rat-shaped sushi roll, ripping bits of seaweed to put on as eyes. He then even proceeded to wrap more seaweed around its middle. To make it more crunchy and delicious, he declared at the table.

He had then requested that he slice into it, which he obliged. The inside was red. Every single red ingredient he had prepared for this party was inside this monstrosity of a sushi roll. He supposed Izuku could get points for originality and realisticity, but flavor-wise, it had to be more than a bit iffy.

Not that it mattered.

Izuku happily wolfed down the entire thing, eyes bright as he bit into it.

Time passed by quickly when one was having fun.

An adage he was finding was more than true.

It felt as if in a blink of an eye, he was suddenly in front of the sink, running dishes under the water, a dish rag in hand. Hizashi then appeared at his side, plucking the dish rag away from him.

“You cooked, Shou,” He winked, hip-checking him away from where he stood, taking his place, “I’ll do the cleaning.” Giving him another nudge, this time towards the living room, “Why don’t you spend some quality time with our son?”

It was a good idea.

He wasn’t one to speak about fairness usually, but it really wasn’t fair that Hizashi had hogged all the cuddles earlier today. This was an opportunity to catch up on a potential nap as well. He was a bit sleepy after that meal.

But just as he sat down, the doorbell rang.

Could it be?

He stood, striding to the front door, squinting through the peephole.

There was nothing there.

He got onto his tiptoes, staring as far down as he could.

Shouta could see something now.

Two perky white ears.

These undoubtedly belonged to whom Izuku had invited over for his birthday.

Opening the door, Shouta could only stare down at the sheer absurdity of the principal of U.A. at the door, a red wagon parked behind him, a sheet covering whatever could be in there.

“Am I a mouse? A dog? A bear?” Nedzu waved a paw, revealing his pink paw pads in all their (likely) squishy glory, “I am Nedzu!” He grinned, a soft one, unlike the usual baring of teeth that he passed as a smile at times, “I am not here in any official capacity today, but I am here as Izuku-kun’s friend!”

He could hear Izuku holler in return.

“It’s Nedzu-san!”

Notes:

    Izuku > You see? The inside is all red!
    Hizashi > Uh huh..
    Izuku > Cause rats have blood inside!
    Hizashi >
    Izuku > And crunchy cause bones!

Chapter Text

Izuku was excited.

Nedzu-san had just arrived at their home!

And he couldn’t help the pleased chirp that left his mouth hearing that Nedzu-san considered him a friend as well. He ran to the door to greet him, stopping next to his Dad, his eyes immediately locking onto the red wagon next to Nedzu-san.

Just what could be in the wagon?

He thought if Ecto-san tried his best, he could probably fit himself onto the wagon. Shuuzenji-san probably could fit there as well, and she wouldn’t even need to force herself to fit.

Could Nedzu-san have brought one of them with him?

Maybe even both?

“Sensei,” His Dad greeted after a small pause, nodding his head, “I’m glad you could make it.” He stepped aside, making room for Nedzu-san and his wagon to enter, “Please, come in.”

“Of course, Aizawa-kun,” Nedzu-san did just that, pulling the wagon in behind him, “How could I refuse such a sincere invitation?” Their eyes met as he followed them down the short hallway and into their living room, “Especially as it was from Izuku-kun!”

“I’m so happy you’re here, Nedzu-san,” He hummed, “I knew you would come!”

“Oh?” Nedzu-san’s white ears perked up, “How so?”

Wasn’t it obvious?

“‘Cause we’re friends.”

“Ah,” He chuckled as he parked the wagon next to the couch, carefully locking the handle into place, “Interesting reasoning, but you are not wrong, Izuku-kun!”

It was at this exact moment that Izuku realized that Nedzu-san was small.

He knew this already, but it wasn’t something that usually mattered.

Nedzu-san’s office at U.A. was full of furniture that fit his size and was easy to get into, so it didn’t affect anything there.

However, what they had at home right now was not like that at all.

How would they be able to offer Nedzu-san a seat?

Would he have to climb onto their couch?

And what about chairs?

Did they have a seat at the table that worked for Nedzu-san?

Would Nedzu-san have to sit on the floor to eat his cake?!

“Have a seat,” His Dad suddenly appeared with a stool, placing it down next to the coffee table, “I’ve already asked Hizashi to get some water boiling for tea.”

Oh!

He should have realized that his Dad would have thought of everything already, even having a seat ready for Nedzu-san.

His Dad gave him a quick pat on the head as he returned to the kitchen, leaving him with a look, one that asked him to ‘be good.’ It was kind of silly, really; he already knew that Nedzu-san wasn’t a snack.

“Hey, Nedzu-san?” Izuku sent a quick glimpse to the wagon as Nedzu-san clambered onto the stool, curiosity nagging him once again, “What’s in the wagon?”

Now that he gave it a bit more thought, it couldn’t be either Ecto-san or Shuuzenji-san in there; surely they would have made some sort of movement by now, which would have proved that someone was hidden under the sheet of fabric.

“I could tell you,” Nedzu-san’s tail swayed behind him slowly, the tip of it skimming the top of the rug, “Or you could guess!” One of his paws patted the tip of the contents of the wagon, the sheet dimpling slightly showing the outline of whatever was in there for a second, “We could make a game out of it!”

A game did sound fun, but…

“What do I win if I guess it right?”

There was a small sparkle in Nedzu-san’s eyes as he replied with a chuckle.

“Well, how does permission to operate the wrecking ball on my crane sound?”

He wasn’t too sure what a ‘wrecking ball’ was, having never heard of those words put together before, but it was probably a ball that wrecked things, right? That sounded pretty cool to him!

“Yes!”

“Very well!” Nedzu-san clapped his paws once, looking delighted, “Now, it wouldn’t be a fun game if it was just disjointed guessing, so I shall give you clues!” He tilted his head, “And you will get, shall we say… a total of three guesses. How does that sound to you, Izuku-kun?”

Nodding his agreement, he leaned forward eagerly.

“Do I get all the clues right now?”

“Of course!”

Nedzu-san tapped his paw against the armrest of the couch, the tassels on the blanket there swaying.

“Your first clue is that these are objects customarily given during special occasions.”

Special occasions?

That meant events, so special events…

What was happening that was special today?

Nedzu-san’s visit to his home?

Oh!

Could it be his birthday?

“Your second clue is that these are usually given by family and close friends or acquaintances.”

…What were ‘ac-quain-tan-ces’?

It didn’t matter.

If it was his birthday and it was something given during birthdays by family and friends, then it had to be birthday presents.

There wasn’t anything else he could think of that fit the clues that Nedzu-san had given to him.

The only issue with the answer he had arrived at was just…

Had Nedzu-san really gotten him a birthday present?

Him?

Izuku knew that his Papa had gotten presents from his own friends on his birthday, but this was different!

His Papa was awesome!

And he… He was just Izuku.

“Are you ready to guess, Izuku-kun?”

He nodded, still a bit uncertain, but there really wasn’t anything else that made more sense than ‘birthday presents.’ And it wasn’t as if he wanted to lose on purpose, either. He wanted to try out Nedzu-san’s crane and wrecking ball!

“Is it a birthday present?”

Nedzu-san clapped his paws, a grin on his face, tail making another sweep against the rug.

“Very good!”

Izuku didn't know what to think about that.

On one hand, he loved receiving presents, but on the other hand, he wasn't quite sure he deserved them at times.

"Nedzu-san?" He asked, fingers clenched into the plush material of the couch, "You know you didn't.. you didn't need to get me anything, right?"

"You said it yourself, Izuku-kun," Nedzu-san replied with a kind tone, voice softer than he had ever heard it, "We are friends, are we not?" He nodded, not wanting Nedzu-san to think that they weren't, "My bringing a gift for you was something I made the choice to do."

His choice.

Like how his Dad and Papa asked him to stay with them then.

It was their choice.

"Thank you, Nedzu-san," He managed to get out, doing his best to keep his tears at bay, "For being my friend."

Something soft touched him and he looked down to see a white paw rest upon his hand.

(Somehow, Nedzu-san had made it over the arm of the couch to join him on the couch proper so quickly and quietly that he hadn't even noticed!)

"No, Izuku-kun," Nedzu-san murmured so quietly, he almost couldn't hear him, "Thank you for being mine."

They then settled in comfortable conversation after that.

He took the chance to update Nedzu-san on his quirk and how he had somehow been able to use bits and pieces of it.

"It seems like you're making good progress," Nedzu-san’s ears flicked up in the direction where his Dad was entering the living room, a tray of drinks in hand, “I look forward to further developments from you and your quirk in the future!”

"It's still a bit hot," His Dad warned as he placed the tray down, "And Izuku, I've poured you out some barley tea."

"My thanks, Aizawa-kun," Nedzu-san's eyes zeroed into the steam wafting out of his cup of tea, nose wiggling, "It smells delectable."

He hummed his agreement, though to be honest, Nedzu-san’s tea smelled more bitter than anything. His own barley tea was delicious though, refreshing and cool. Perfect for a summer day.

"Nedzu-san?" He piped up after a moment of silence between the three of them, the sound of the kitchen faucet running being the only background noise he could hear, "Do you wanna see my room?"

"Your room?" Nedzu-san blinked before standing up from where he was sitting, having to move from the couch to the rug in order to reach his tea on the coffee table easier, "The tea still has yet to reach its optimal temperature, so we do have some time."

"It'll be quick!" He promised, "There's just something I really wanna show you!"

"Well now, you pique my curiosity, Izuku-kun," Nedzu-san , "Let us be off!"

"I'll let you both know when the cake and tea are ready," His Dad also got onto his feet, offering him a hand which he gladly took, "And Izuku, you remember what I told you, yes?"

No world domination.

"Yes, Dad."

Really, his Dad was so paranoid sometimes.

His… Dad…

 

Oh.

Did he really call him that aloud?

He hoped that his Dad had not changed his mind on being called 'Dad'.

Peeking up to make sure, he was relieved to notice that there was no sneer of disgust, no frown of disapproval to be seen at all.

Good.

That was good.

It was still embarrassing though, just a bit, if only because this was happening in front of Nedzu-san.

"I'm gonna show my room to Nedzu-san now!"

He declared, knowing the only way to fix this was to get away from the entire situation. For now, at least.

His Dad waved him off, heading back to the kitchen where he could hear his Papa greet him and ask him what took him so long, leaving him to show Nedzu-san to his room.

As he led Nedzu-san there, he noticed that he even had on guest slippers, ones that were a perfect fit.

His Dad really thought of everything.

He was so powerful.

As they stepped into his room, he headed straight for his shelf where Real Mick stood, picking him up to show him off.

"This is what I wanted to show you," He brandished his favorite, and currently, only, figurine, "This is Real Mick!"

Nedzu-san blinked, ears perking up before he chuckled.

"Oh, that is delightful!"

Izuku felt warm hearing that.

He was glad that Nedzu-san liked Real Mick.

"Dad got him for me," He explained, "I don't think Papa likes him very much though."

Placing Real Mick back on his place on the shelf, he carefully turned him so he wasn't facing his bed.

He couldn't have his Papa nervous the entire time he was reading to him at night 'cause he thought that Real Mick was watching.

It sounded like a silly thing, but it had an easy solution, so why not just do the logical thing and fix that?

"I do enjoy your Real Mick very much," Nedzu-san reaffirmed with a nod, "May I ask where this was purchased?"

"You might have to ask my dad that," He admitted after thinking for a few moments, not really recalling if he was ever told the name of the mall they visited, "But it's in the same store that sells the life-sized All Mights."

"I shall keep that in mind," Nedzu-san turned, eyes sweeping over the other items on his shelf, pausing over the notebooks he kept there, "And what might these be?”

“They’re my hero notebooks,” Pulling out the one he was still working on, he flipped to the page he had for Nedzu-san (Mr. Principal!) to show him, “I like to write about heroes and their quirks, see?””

“May I?” Nedzu-san held his paw out and he obliged, handing his book over, hoping that he didn’t make too many spelling mistakes; was Nedzu-san looking to grade his hero book or something? “Thank you!”

He flipped through a few of the pages, eyes spending the longest on his own page, looking down at the picture he drew and his semi-wobbly handwriting next to it, before finally handing it back to him, a small smile on his face.

“Do you like heroes, Izuku-kun?”

“Heroes are cool,” He nodded, “Most of them are nice.”

With an exception of whichever heroes had decided to not listen to his Mama, at least.

Those weren’t nice heroes.

They were horrible ones.

“It’s time for cake!”

His Dad’s voice suddenly called.

“We’re in the living room!”

It was surreal watching Izuku and Nedzu enter the living room together.

This was his old Hero Ethics teacher, now the principal of U.A.!

And he was under their roof!

It boggled his mind.

However, that was nothing compared to the unlikely friendship that Izuku and Nedzu seemed to have struck up.

But he knew that he would choose Nedzu over Izuku’s old Kacchan any day, so he really couldn’t complain.

"Cake!"

Izuku exclaimed, speeding the last couple of steps over, ogling at the cake that he had placed on the coffee table.

As Nedzu followed Izuku over to the table, he nodded his greeting to his old teacher, getting a toothy grin in return.

Hizashi found himself seated next to Izuku, the cake knife already in Shouta's custody and unlikely to leave it any time soon. However, he did have the matches, so it wasn't as if it was completely safe next him right now anyways.

"It's an angel food cake," After striking a match, he carefully lit the wicks of the black and yellow candles there, keeping an eye on Izuku to watch for any hint of discomfort from being exposed to the small flames, "With an assortment of fresh berries."

"What's that in the center?" Izuku asked, craning his head to get a better look at what was there, "Oh, it's an owl!" He started to clamber up onto his feet, "And another bird! And a cat!"

He got closer, eyes wide.

Hizashi couldn't stop himself from gently holding Izuku off from getting too close, tugging him back down to sit next to him.

"Be careful, yeah?"

"Oh, right," Izuku blinked up at him, guileless, "Don't wanna squash the cake."

"Right," He agreed, unable to stop his wry smile, "No squishing the cake."

"But, Papa," Tugging on his sleeve and calling him 'Papa'... Izuku made for such a cute sight, he was nearly beside himself, "Do we eat them?"

"Uh, no," He should have figured that Izuku would be more interested in their edibility first, "It's not edible."

Izuku looked faintly surprised at his words, turning to look at the cake topper again.

"If you can't eat it, then why is it on top of a cake?"

Shouta cut in with a small amused look.

"It's called a cake topper."

"Oh," Izuku replied matter-of-factly, "That makes sense."

Did that really?

Was it really that easy to explain?

Fucking wild.

"It's also your birthday present from me an' Shouta!" He elaborated, pointedly ignoring Shouta and Nedzu’s impromptu staring contest, "You get to see this one early!"

"You got me a birthday present too?" Izuku stared at him and then over at Shouta as if waiting for some sort of denial, "That's two whole presents now…"

Oh geez, did that mean what he thought it did?

"Izuku?" He asked gently, tone even, very much aware that he might be stepping on potential landmine, "Did you not get birthday presents before?”

“The cake was usually my present,” Izuku replied after a moment of silence, “But Mama got me sneakers the last time ‘cause my cake got set on fire.”

Got set on fire?!

What kind of-!

Midoriya Hisashi.

He didn’t even need to wonder.

“Mama said it was an ac-ci-dent,” He continued, shoulders falling, “I dunno though…”

Even Nedzu frowned at that, his tail lashing out to the side behind him.

“But you got me cake and presents,” Izuku sounded like he didn’t know what to do with himself, fingers twisting into the hem of his sleeves, “That’s so much for someone like me.”

“‘Zuku,” He started, “Izu-”

“Izuku-kun,” Nedzu turned, interrupting him, voice no longer chipper, “You are important to many others, including myself,” He then softened his voice in a way he had never heard before, continuing kindly, “Believe me when I say you are very much worth everything we all see in you.”

He could see Shouta stare at Nedzu, a faint surprise visible in his eyes.

And well, he could understand that.

It was what he was doing too.

Because what the fuck even.

Since when did Nedzu know how to talk like that?

A dull thunk made him blink, looking around for the source of the sound, locating it quickly in the form of the knife that Shouta was holding on to.

“Cake!”

Izuku had obviously followed the same actions, his depressing train of thought cut off abruptly by the sight of the cake knife.

“Cake,” He agreed, pushing the memories of Nedzu’s soft and gentle tone out of his mind to be pondered over later, “Let’s sing first!”

“I’m sure Sensei already knows the birthday song,” Shouta nodded his agreement, “So let’s all sing together.”

And so they did.

And oh, was it a mess.

Nedzu might be one of the smartest beings on this planet, but he obviously had yet to learn how to properly carry a tune or to synchronize with the other people he was singing with.

It was fun though.

Izuku was smiling, clapping along with their clashing voices, and if he had to be honest, that was all that really mattered.

After the disastrous song, the candles were blown out and the cake sliced.

The cake was delicious, as expected of something that Shouta made, the berries bringing in a nice sweet tang that melded well with the airiness of the cake.

Even Nedzu seemed to enjoy the cake, his paw able to operate a fork well.

(He had never even seen Nedzu eat before. The only reason he knew that he actually needed sustenance to survive was because Shouta had told him that Nedzu enjoyed snacking on small blocks of cheese during private lessons.)

After some cake and tea, it was time for presents.

Shouta had already cleaned the cake topper off, though Izuku had managed to lick it once before he had taken it away for a good wiping.

It now rested on the table in front of Izuku, who had quickly grown attached to it once he had realized that the owl had green eyes, then quickly identifying the other two as him and Shouta.

Nedzu had gone next after that, pulling off the sheet covering the wagon with a flourish, the contents finally revealed.

The first thing he had noticed there was Nedzu.

A plush toy version of him, at least.

Nedzu picked his plush self up, offering it to Izuku.

“This is my birthday present for you, Izuku-kun!”

Izuku took it, eyes big and shining.

“You got me yourself, Nedzu-san?”

“I have been assured that my presence would be the best present,” Nedzu replied with a nod, “So, I had this created specifically for you.”

Hizashi wasn’t sure he could keep his giggle in, knowing that there was a large chance that Nedzu heard that and ran in the complete opposite direction of what it had probably meant in the first place.

“Izuku really is happy you came though,” He concurred, hand tugging Izuku to sit in between his legs, stopping him in his attempt of dragging his finger down the knife for extra frosting, “Thank you for coming, Sensei.”

“It was no trouble, Yamada-kun!” Nedzu waved him off, now in the process of tugging the wagon closer, “I came with the blessings of the rest of the faculty even.”

The rest of the faculty?

That meant that they all knew that Nedzu was planning on attending a child’s birthday party. This also meant that Nedzu had absolutely bounced birthday gift ideas off of them as well.

Being a faculty member in U.A. must be a one-of-a-kind job.

It sounded like an experience.

“And everything else here is from everyone else at U.A.,” Nedzu announced, paws presenting the large gift basket full of a variety of snacks to an overwhelmed Izuku, “The wagon as well.” He added on as an afterthought, “Power Loader himself modified it. It has rockets.”

Rockets?!

Was that safe?!

Shouta seemed just as worried as he was about this, immediately leaning down to murmur something into Nedzu’s ears.

He took this chance to hand Izuku the rest of his presents, hoping that this would keep him distracted.

It did.

Izuku ‘wow’ed over the Present Mic pajamas that Nemuri had gotten him, immediately hugging them and proclaiming their softness.

(Why was it alright and even encouraged for Nemuri to give Izuku his merch, but tacky when he tried to do the same?!)

The book on owls that Tensei and Tenya had gifted him was met with interest, Izuku asking him to start reading it to him that very night.

(He hoped it wasn’t too graphic on the prey eating. Was it bedtime story material if it was?)

Upon opening Tsukauchi’s gift and finding a hat, Izuku seemed dumbfounded even as he was still digesting that even Tsukauchi had gotten him something.

“If he gave me his hat, does that make me a hat-owl now?” His voice went up an octave, “Am I the hat-Izuku?!”

He couldn’t help his snort at that, just imagining Izuku with Tsukauchi’s hat and trench coat made him want to find clothes that fit that description and ask Izuku to dress up as him. It would be adorable, he was sure!

After all the presents had been opened, it didn’t take long for tears to start forming in Izuku’s eyes, Shouta and Nedzu’s eyes darting over as soon as a small sob left his mouth.

“Oh, ‘Zuku,” He cooed, thumbs wiping them away, “You okay?”

“They’re happy tears!” Izuku hiccupped back at him, hugging his new Nedzu plush, “They are!”

“Happy tears, huh?”

“It’s just…” He hiccupped again, “This is the best birthday I’ve ever had.”

His heart broke for Izuku, it really did.

But he had to be strong for his son.

“We’ll make the one next year even better, yeah?”

Izuku dragged his face against his sleeve, drying up some of the wetness still lingering on his cheeks before shifting to look up at him.

“You don’t gotta, you know?”

“But we want to.”

More tears fell.

“Thank you.”

Chapter Text

Shouta disliked early mornings.

However, there was especially something to be said about early mornings on public transportation.

Because it was the height of summer, the streets were packed, families making their way out of the city in droves accompanied by plastic pails, shovels, and the occasional inner tube.

He was glad they were heading in the opposite direction.

They were actually heading into Tokyo.

Or more specifically, to Tensei’s place in Hosu.

Hizashi had been invited to be a special guest on some show that was going to take up his entire morning, but as he was free the rest of the day, only having to attend an afterparty on the night of the day after, and after checking with him and his own schedule, had asked Izuku if he was up for a short weekend trip.

It took a bit to convince him, but in the end Izuku had agreed, reluctant to be separated from Hizashi for two whole nights.

He had then called up Tensei, asking him about the possibility of a playdate between the two kids. Tensei had been more than happy to pass on the question to his brother, who had responded with an enthusiastic ‘yes, please!’

Between packing bags for their short trip, booking somewhere to stay, and hero patrols, it had been busy at their household. That wasn’t even including the start of Izuku’s beginner gymnastics classes.

(They had asked Izuku what he would be interested in trying out and he had been adamant on something that would help him in 'being as stretchy' as he was. And in between the choices of beginner's dance or gymnastics offered, had gone with the latter. The class he had been enrolled in would end as the summer inevitably would, but that amount of time there would be enough for Izuku to know if he'd like to continue further with gymnastics while also juggling school.)

He was glad that they were well on their way now.

Everything was settled, so they could just relax on the train and look forward to the weekend ahead of them.

Izuku was already glued to the window next to him, watching the scenery blur by with sleepy eyes.

He had taken the initiative to book them all seats in the most unoccupied reserved car. Partly because he knew Izuku wasn't exactly fond of strangers and partly because he didn't want to deal with more people than necessary in the morning.

It all worked out.

The train was quiet enough that he could probably grab a quick nap, though his plans for that were forgotten with Izuku's voice calling his name.

"Dad?"

He grunted back in return, the tickle of being called 'dad' warming his soul.

"Mm?"

"What else are we gonna do there?" Izuku turned to look at him, "Besides go play with Tenya."

"I'm sure we can find something to do," He murmured, "We don't have solid plans, but both Hizashi and I grew up in Tokyo, so we know some places we could take you."

Tokyo was a metropolis, but it wasn't all cityscapes and tall buildings. For someone like him, who had tried to find some measure of quiet and peace in the bustling city growing up, Tokyo was also the home of many quaint neighborhoods.

He had spent many summer nights with his parents at Inokashira Park, Musashino being where he had been raised in the first place.

On the other hand, Hizashi had been raised in Setagaya near Shimokitazawa district, known for it’s fashion retailers, theater, and live music venues.

It was much louder there, compared to his parent’s place in the neighborhood of Kichijoji, so he couldn’t imagine Izuku would enjoy it too much.

"We could even go visit your parents if we're in the area," Hizashi piped up, eyes finally off the notes he had been going over, "Shoukimi-san keeps asking us to stop by."

Yeah, he didn’t want to do that.

Not only did his parents not know about Izuku yet, but he knew that his father in particular would be less than pleased that he had adopted a child without any sort of prior notice. Not that it mattered, as he was technically the head of their own small immediate family, but his father was a stickler at times.

“Shou-ki-mi-san?” Izuku repeated the name, “Who’s that?”

“She’s Shou’s mom!” Hizashi responded, an elbow propping his chin up, “And that makes her your grandma, ya know!”

That tidbit of knowledge seemed to invigorate Izuku, his eyes growing bigger and a palpable excitement entering his voice.

“I have a grandma?”

“Excited, aren’t cha?” Chuckles left HIzashi as he reached over to give Izuku a tap on the nose, yanking it back when Izuku tried to nip him in return, “No grandparents when you were with Inko?”

“None.”

He raised four fingers up, lowering them down one at a time as he explained.

“Mama’s mom left her and her brother at an or-phan-age, so I never met her.”

One.

“Mama never met her dad, so I never did either.”

Two.

“And Hisashi’s parents… They died before I was born.”

There went three and four.

Hizashi looked horror-struck, his playful question inadvertently uncovering more about Izuku’s past that they hadn’t yet known.

“I… I’m sorry, ‘Zuku.”

“No, Papa,” Izuku shook his head, unshaken despite sharing this information, “It’s okay. Don’t be sad.”

Typical Izuku, worried about how the information he had given them affected them rather than how it could affect himself.

“Well, you’ve got two sets of grandparents now,” He cut in before Hizashi could get driven to tears; that was the last thing he needed before having to go on air, “Both mine and Hizashi’s parents are alive and well.”

“Four new grandparents…”

He sounded amazed, counting the four fingers he had previously lowered, raising them up again.

They had known about his lonely childhood already, but these new facts just made it more apparent that Izuku truly only had his mother in his life back then. And that same mother had only failed Izuku as well, allowing Hisashi to treat Izuku how he did.

“Dad?”

“Yes?”

“Do you think…” Izuku paused before continuing, clearly conflicted about his next words, “Do you think they’ll like me?”

Hizashi made a sound in his throat, not unlike a dog whining, and Shouta, if he were more prone to making sounds like that, knew he would have done the same.

Instead, he breathed in and then out, making sure he didn’t show any of the frustration he was feeling inside.

“All you have to do is give them a chance,” And if they blew it, well, then they should have known better, “You don’t need to do anything else, Izuku.”

It wasn’t as if he was planning on Izuku meeting his parents anytime soon anyways.

He’d prefer that Izuku have a chance to build up more self-esteem and confidence before anything of that sort happened. Frankly, the last thing Izuku needed was the pressure of living up to his father’s expectations.

“A chance?”

“Mm,” He nodded, “A chance to get to know the true you.”

“But that sounds too easy.”

“It does, doesn’t it?” Hizashi interjected wryly, “But I can tell you from experience that this is the best way.”

This was how Hizashi had won over his parents, after all.

He knew best here.

“I’ll try then,” Izuku finally relented, shoulders slumping down, “I just… I want them to like me.”

"I think you've got a pretty good start already, yeah?"

"I do?"

"Well, for one, your cheeks are devastating," Hizashi seemingly took his chance, giving Izuku's cheek a poke, cooing at the pout he was given in return, "And furthermore, you've got Shouta on your side."

Hizashi wasn't wrong.

As his parent's sole child, their only son that had even survived long enough to be given birth to, he held a fair amount of sway. Especially for something like this, something that could impact their family, he knew they would hear him out at the very least.

Not that he thought his parents would dislike Izuku; on the contrary, he knew that the two of them were rather fond of children.

He didn’t even like most kids and he loved Izuku.

"We're nearly there," Hizashi mused, causing Izuku to start, turning towards the window again, palms pressed against the panes of glass, "Is Tensei going to meet you guys at the station?"

"He's watching Tenya right now since his parents are over at their agency."

"Makes sense," Hizashi looked amused, "Considering how prone to crashes his brother seems to be."

"Leaving young children unsupervised is just asking for trouble," He glanced over at Izuku who he knew, if left alone, would either nap or assert his dominance over his perceived territory via screeches and screams, "Leaving young children that are still working on their quirk control unsupervised is even worse."

Hizashi had told him how Izuku's time with Tenya at the park had gone. That they had only taken their eyes off of them for a single second and in that time, one had run into a pole while the other had let go of said pole and planted his face into the ground.

A repeat of that was the last thing he wanted.

“Are we there yet?”

Izuku piped up, eyes still glued to the window.

“When the train stops is when we will know we’ve arrived,” He replied, allowing his eyes to slide close; maybe he could catch a few minutes of a nap before they did arrive, “It shouldn’t be too much longer.”

As he drifted off into a light sleep, chin buried into the material of his capture weapon, he could hear Hizashi regale Izuku about whatever show he was supposed to be a surprise guest in.

He wasn’t interested in kid shows.

Far from it.

But Izuku did sound interested, so perhaps…

The Iidas had a nice home.

The walk to Tenya’s place was quick, their ‘see you laters’ even quicker as his Papa had to run, not wanting to be late. As they crossed the street in the opposite direction of where his Papa had headed, his Dad mentioned to him that he had visited the Iidas a lot back when he was still in high school, so he knew all the shortcuts to their house.

But even though his Dad had visited plenty of times years ago, Izuku still felt like his skin was crawling once he stepped in, switching his sandals for guest slippers, following behind his Dad the entire time.

That was less nice.

It was hard to describe why he felt so weird about entering Tenya’s home. He just knew that this wasn’t his own home, his own territory, and he didn’t like the thought of that at all.

He hadn’t had this issue with visiting U.A., so he wasn’t sure why this was happening at all.

For now though, until this weird feeling left or lessened, he would have to stay by his Dad’s side.

His Dad didn’t seem to mind, allowing him to latch to his side, careful to not accidentally elbow him in the head, as Iida-san gave them a quick tour of their house.

However, even as Iida-san showed them the living room, he realized that he hadn’t seen Tenya yet at all.

Where could he be?

There was only one way to find out.

“Iida-san?” He asked, “Can I ask you something?”

“Of course, Izuku-kun,” Iida-san kindly replied, smiling, “What is it?”

“Do you know where Tenya is?”

“Ah,” He chuckled, “Actually, he should be coming down any moment.” Motioning at the stairs leading to the next floor, “He wanted to make sure he finished his homework before you came over.”

That made sense, yeah.

He nodded, doing his best to do the same nod as his Dad when his Dad thanked someone.

It seemed to have worked too, Iida-san nodding back in return.

As they all settled on the couch in the living room, Izuku peeked out the closest window, getting a glimpse of the small area in the back where they could play, if they wanted.

And while having another game of owls and cars with Tenya sounded like fun, he wanted to do something different.

Papa was gonna be on the television today and there was no way he wouldn’t take this chance to watch whatever he was gonna do there.

“Nii-san,” He could hear Tenya’s voice slightly echoing down the stairs, “Is Izuku-kun here yet?”

“Yeah!” Iida-san responded as he placed down a tray of cups and a pitcher of water he had brought in from the kitchen, “Come down, Tenya!”

“He’s here?!” Footsteps sounded, Izuku easily recognizing the sounds of feet running down stairs, “I’m coming!”

Tenya appeared quickly after and Izuku couldn’t help but wonder if there had been any quirk usage for him to go down stairs so quickly.

“Tenya!” He greeted him as soon as he slid to a stop in the living room, “Hi!”

“Izuku-kun!” Tenya’s hair was slightly messy; he was even still holding a pencil; he must have just ran down without putting it back down, “You’re here!”

“You forgot to put your pencil down,” Izuku informed him, eyeing the pencil he had; it looked like it had an Ingenium design, “Are you done with your homework?”

It would really suck if he wasn’t because he didn’t know if they would be allowed to spend time together then.

“Yes!” Tenya seemed proud, pencil still in hand before blinking down at it, quickly placing it into the cup on their own table, already filled with many more pencils, “We can spend as much time as we want together now!”

“Just the morning, kids,” His Dad reminded them, leaning back into the couch, his capture scarf settling around his shoulders and covering the lower half of his face, “We’ve got plans for the afternoon.”

Oh right, his Dad did mention wanting to bring him to a big park with a pond where there were boats they could ride together.

He was looking forward to that.

“Maybe we can play for longer next time?” He hoped Tenya wouldn’t be upset about their plans, “Is that okay?”

“Next time then,” Tenya nodded, “But as for today, is there something you’d like to play specifically?”

It wasn’t exactly a game, but it was his Papa, so it was important.

“Actually, can we watch Present Mic on the television?”

 

“Are you ready?!”

Izuku could feel his excitement rising, previous discomfort gone, as his Papa asked, finger pointing directly at them, like he knew they were standing right there, watching him on the television.

“Yeah!” He yelled back, “Ready!”

“Good!” Winking, Present Mic gave a double thumbs up before throwing his arms up, “Now, everybody say HEY!”

“Hey!” Izuku shouted, throwing his own up as well; his voice was the only one he heard though, so he gave his playmate a look, “Tenya! You gotta say it too!”

"Television time is supposed to be quiet time," Tenya was still sitting on the couch, unlike him who had excitedly jumped off at the first opportunity to do as his Papa had asked, "You are not being very quiet, Izuku-kun."

Tenya wasn't wrong; it was way easier to hear what was being said on the television if you were quiet.

But he was sure his Papa wouldn't have asked them to say 'hey!' if it was the quiet time sort of television like his Dad usually put on a bit before dinner.

That wouldn't be very logical.

"This isn't the quiet time kind of show, Tenya," He explained even as he could hear Present Mic asking them to touch their toes, (which he did!), continuing to talk and peeking up at Tenya from between his legs, “Present Mic wants people to par-ti-ci-pate, you know.”

“I suppose if it is a pro hero asking, then I cannot refuse,” Tenya replied after thinking for a second, finally sliding off of the couch to join him standing on the floor, “Listening to a pro hero that is on the scene is important."

"Shake your feet to the beat!"

This was fun, Izuku thought to himself as he, and now also Tenya, continued following the instructions given.

Papa looked like he was having a good time as well, all enthusiasm and loud cheer. It made him happy to see him happy.

His Dad was still on his phone, the camera end pointed to the television.

"I'm busy recording this for Hizashi so he can watch it later," Sounding amused when asked to join in, his Dad had given him a quick pat on the head instead of standing up and hopping on one leg with them, "Why don't you ask Tensei, alright?"

He had gotten Tenya to do that for him.

Iida-san was mostly alright and all, but he still didn't know him very well. Though he had never been anything but nice to him, there were still moments he worried that he was only being nice to him because he was friends with his Dad.

It was better that Tenya asked anyway!

They were brothers and they cared about each other very much. That made Tenya the perfect person to go ask.

And when Iida-san had nodded to Tenya's (their!) request, he knew he had made the best decision possible in this situation.

"Hey!" Present Mic eventually called out after he clapped his hands twice, then tapped his chin, "Do you know what time it is?"

"Um."

He had no idea where the clock was at Tenya's place.

"It is five minutes until ten!"

Tenya exclaimed, chopping his hand down in the direction of the small clock that sat under the television.

"It's almost time to say goodbye!" Present Mic waved to them, "And do you know what that means?"

Truth be told, he had never watched this show. He had only asked to watch it today because he knew his Papa would be in it.

And thus, that meant he had no idea what 'goodbye time' would bring.

A quick look at Tenya revealed that he had no idea as well.

"It means that it's wiggle time!" His Papa exclaimed, adopting a funny pose, wiggling all the while, "Everybody, let's wiggle!"

Wiggle time!

That sounded so fun!

"Tenya!"

"Must we?"

"It's good exercise and wiggling is fun!"

"I… I suppose you are right, Izuku-kun," Tenya said as he started to wiggle only his arms, "Exercise is very important."

"Wiggle to the right!" Present Mic spoke while doing his own wiggle, his hair somehow not wiggling along with him, "And wiggle to the left!"

He could hear an odd coughing sound coming from where his Dad was sitting, one of his hands covering his mouth.

Maybe he needed some water?

He knew he did as well. Doing all these wiggles was actually pretty hard work. His Papa was so strong to be able to do this without having to take small breaks like he needed to.

As a matter of fact, it was only him that needed the breaks.

Tenya and his big brother didn't seem to need any and still looked full of energy somehow.

How was this possible?

“And to all my little listeners watching with someone. Parents, guardians, or buddies,” Izuku perked up; that was him and Tenya! He and Tenya were buddies! “Wiggle together!”

He swung his head towards Tenya, about to ask if they could wiggle together, but Tenya already had his hands held out towards him.

“Izuku-kun! Let us wiggle together!”

“Yes!”

Taking Tenya’s hands in his own, their fingers clasping together, they wiggled.

Izuku didn’t know how long they wiggled for, but by the time Present Mic had called for a stop, the show ending after one final goodbye from him, he was exhausted.

He let himself fall back against the couch, sitting against the foot of it by his Dad’s legs.

“Izuku-kun!” Tenya followed him, voice concerned, “Are you alright?”

“I’m okay,” He reassured him, “It was just a lot of wiggling, so I’m catching my breath.”

“Understandable,” Nodding, Tenya brought over a cup that he had quickly filled part-way with water, “Here, have something to drink.”

Accepting it, he took a sip of it, happy that it was cold. Cold water really did taste the best after a lot of exercise.

Tenya joined him while Iida-san slipped to stand by the couch next to his Dad, leaning down to whisper something in his ear. His Dad only grinned, slipping his phone into his pocket, his one hand stopping Iida-san’s when it tried to head in the direction of his phone.

Iida-san must really want whatever was on his Dad’s phone badly.

Did he also want to rewatch Present Mic on the television?

“Is that enough water?” Tenya asked him, interrupting his thoughts, “Would you like more?” He continued, pressing even closer, “We also have juice if you prefer juice.”

Tenya was so concerned about him.

Was this what having friends was like?

Nedzu-san wasn’t like this, but he always showed that he cared, always reassuring him and showing interest in what he had to say.

However, Tenya was Tenya.

And he liked that.

“Thanks for wiggling with me, Tenya,” He murmured, and because of Tenya’s closeness, he didn’t doubt that he had heard his words, “You’re a good friend.”

“Izuku-kun…” Tenya seemed taken aback by his words, but he could tell that he wasn’t upset by them, “Izuku-kun! You are also a good friend!” He chopped his hand towards him, “I am sure you will be a wonderful owl as well!”

Yeah, Tenya was the best Tenya.

He could see Iida-san’s eyebrows do the wrinkle that meant he was confused.

Just what could he be confused about?

Adults were so weird sometimes.

“Alright,” Iida-san swept a hand through his hair, breathing in and then out with a ‘woosh’, “Shouta? Lunch?” He downed the rest of his glass of juice, shaking his head, his hair settling back to how it looked originally, “Let’s do lunch.”

“You’re cooking?”

“We can go out,” Stretching up to his full height, Iida-san did a quick stretch before beckoning to Tenya, “I know a place that does good ramen.” His eyes met Iida-san’s and he could see Iida-san’s grin get a bit crooked, “Unless Izuku wants to eat a rat or something?”

“I’m not allowed to eat city rats anymore.”

He helpfully informed Iida-san, not wanting his Dad to get cross with his own friend for offering him something he wasn’t supposed to have.

Iida-san only paled at his reply, mouthing ‘anymore’ to himself.

After that, his Dad nudged at him, taking his empty cup and placing it back down on the tray.

They left together, returning to the streets, this time with Iida-san and Tenya.

He was sort of hoping that Iida-san would have gotten him a rat anyways, but it was a delicious bowl of tonkotsu ramen that greeted him instead.

Maybe it was better that Iida-san didn’t find him a rat. He didn’t think his Dad would ever share whatever was on his phone that Iida-san wanted if he had gotten rat ramen for lunch instead.

After lunch, he and Tenya waved goodbye to each other as they walked in the opposite directions.

Tenya was headed back home with Iida-san while they were going to head back to the station.

They were supposed to meet up with Papa again now that he had finished his business.

He was holding his Dad’s hand as they walked together, making sure they didn’t get separated. This area wasn’t one he knew at all, so if he got lost, he might never be found again.

Izuku didn’t want that.

So he would just make sure that he didn’t get lost at all instead.

“Shouta?

Izuku could see his Dad freeze at the call of his name.

“Is that you, Shouta?”

He turned, trying to see who could be calling his Dad’s name in the middle of the street.

“No.”

“Shouta!” A woman stepped out of a small crowd, walking quickly in their direction, “It is you!”

Izuku was struck by a sense of familiarity.

There was something about her.

Was it her hair?

Her eyes?

“Mom,” His Dad sighed, looking very tired, “Why are you in Hosu?”

This was his Dad’s mother!

“Just some shopping I wanted to get done,” She patted the large box she held in her arms, “Some limited edition jelly pouches that debuted today actually.” Shifting the box in her arms, she used her knee to prop it so it wouldn’t fall, “Are you here for that too?”

“No, I…”

He just had to confirm this.

“Are you… Shoukimi-san?”

“Oh, yes,” His Dad took the heavy box from her, a smile getting sent back to him in return, “I am.” She crouched down now that she had no box in the way, “And who might you be?”

“Aizawa Izuku.”

She looked surprised as she repeated after him, his Dad making an aborted motion behind her.

“... Aizawa?”

He nodded.

“You’re my grandma.”


Iida Tenya
(My friend!)

- Thinks I can be an owl! (ovo)
- Likes orange juice.
- Has a lot of glasses.

His quirk: Engine!
(Car!)

He chops!

- Plays owls and cars with me!
- Always thinks I need to drink more water.

    Hizashi being a guest on a children's tv show is just so good, okay? Let him teach everyone to wiggle! Kids are gonna call him 'Wiggle Man' if they see Present Mic in the street! xD

    Grandma! She's here! Grandma or also known as Aizawa Shoukimi, is Shouta's mom; the kanji in her given name are Shou "消:, Ki "木", and Mi "美", which are respectively “Erase”, “Tree”, and “Beauty”; she's actually buying the jelly pouches to send to Shouta, so what a coincidence it was to find him here in Hosu!

    Izuku is pretty enchanted by the concept of grandparents. He already thinks she's pretty neat just because she's his dad's mom xD

    Please let me know your thoughts! :D And thank you so much for all the comments! <33

    Next chapter comes out January 15th! Getting to know his grandparents and adventures in a tree!

Chapter Text

Let it be known that Shouta loved his son.

Though it had only been one full month that Izuku had been living with him and Hizashi, it had only built upon the relationship they had previously established with 'Mimizuku'.

Yes, it was a bit worrying at times when Izuku seemed to act more like an owl than a human kid, forgetting things like chewing or that he had fingers, but he was adjusting well enough that he never fretted for too long or much.

And Izuku really was only a child.

He was eager and willing to learn and that was his and Hizashi’s job as parents, to give him that needed room to grow and develop. And though Izuku hadn’t been with them for long, he had been making leaps and bounds in catching up with what he had missed out on while living on his own.

However, he was still oblivious at times, barging ahead if he felt confident enough, mouth opening to say things that made him want to shrivel up in seconds.

This was one of those moments.

“Shouta.”

The tone of his mom’s voice brought him back to when he was Izuku’s age, determined to sneak in an extra jelly pouch before dinner. He had been unsuccessful back then, but for Izuku’s sake now, he couldn’t allow himself to be cowed.

He was a pro hero.

Unexpected things happened regularly in his profession, so he had to lean into it.

Go with the flow, as Hizashi might say.

And while there was a small part of him that wanted to tuck his kid under his arm and then run, he knew that it would only stall what was inevitable.

“Papa!”

Izuku’s excited voice rang out and he snapped his eyes up, immediately searching for that familiar shade of blond, spotting flashes of it getting closer.

“‘Zuku!” They weren’t far from the entrance of the train station, so while there was a fair amount of foot traffic, it wasn’t particularly crowded, “Shou—! I, uh, Shoukimi-san!” Hizashi came jogging up to them, “Didn’t know you’d be in Hosu today!”

“Hizashi-kun,” His mom straightened up at the sudden arrival and Izuku dove forward, letting go of his sleeve to cling to Hizashi instead, “It’s nice to see you too.” She watched as Hizashi absentmindedly patted Izuku on the head, “I was just getting introduced to my grandchild.”

Hizashi’s eyes darted over to him at her words, taking in his awkward stance before softening just a tad.

"We were actually talking about the possibility of visiting you earlier," To others who weren't around Hizashi as much as he was, they wouldn't recognize the wry note in his tone, but he definitely could, "What a coincidence to meet you out here!"

"Were you really?" Ah, typical of his mom, cutting straight to the point, "And may I ask how old Izuku-kun is?"

"I'm eight now," Izuku chimed in, "My birthday was last week."

Shit.

"Eight," She repeated flatly, "Shouta, you have some serious explaining to do." Flicking her gaze over at Hizashi, she then raised an eyebrow, "Hizashi-kun, you as well."

"Do I have to explain too?" Izuku whispered, tugging at his sleeve, "Are we in trouble?"

"Oh, darling," His mom returned to crouching, her tone switching from strict to sugary sweet, "Not you, just your parents."

Izuku looked distressed hearing that, his cheeks puffing out as he protested. It gave him a measure of embarrassment, his eight year old kid trying to defend them from his own mom.

"Is it 'cause you didn't get invited to my birthday party?" Izuku practically demanded, though he was still very much attached to Hizashi's side, "I didn't even know I had a grandma last week, so you can't blame them."

He could see Hizashi freeze minutely, gaze snapping down to where Izuku was.

Shouta felt similarly enough.

Izuku really did have a knack with words at times.

And that wasn't a compliment, not at all.

"So not only did you two not let us know we've got a grandchild," His mom slowly straightened up again and despite her being shorter than him, he found himself actively avoiding her gaze, "But you also decided to not tell Izuku-kun about his grandparents until recently."

Well, she wasn't wrong, per say.

It was just that Izuku didn’t need any further complications right now. And it had been a fairly hectic month he had spent with them so far, full of readjustment to human life, meetings, paperwork, and birthdays. Tossing in grandparents would have been going too far, not that Hizashi's parents were even in the country right now.

And Izuku didn't even like most people, ambivalence being what he defaulted to when meeting new people. And on the rare occasion, well-hidden disdain.

Introducing him to his new grandparents would have been an unneeded stressor.

"I didn't ask if I had any," Izuku retorted, a stubborn note entering his voice, "I've never had any before so I didn't know I would get some when my Dad and Papa decided to keep me forever."

"When they decided to keep you?" His mom repeated back to him, eyes softening; whether it was because she had figured out that Izuku had been recently adopted or if it was due to Izuku being himself, he didn't know, "And was this recent?"

"Ye—"

"Mom, that's enough," He cut in, taking the chance to plop a hand onto Izuku's head, easily distracting him from digging them further into the already sizable hole they were in, "You're working Izuku up."

"That's right, Shoukimi-san," Hizashi smoothly moved in as well, "We should move to someplace private for our discussion at the very least."

Implying they were going to discuss this, not exactly something he wanted to sacrifice his day for.

However, with his mom right in front of them, even if they made a clean escape, there would be no way of avoiding her. His mom could be persistent when she wanted to be; he didn’t doubt she’d follow them right back to Musutafu to get the answers she wanted if she wasn't satisfied with the ones given.

"Alright, we can head home then," She then stepped closer, hands hovering over the box of jelly pouches he was still holding, "Do you want to give this back to me, Shouta?"

He shifted the box away from her; it wasn't exactly that heavy, just bulky.

"I can carry it."

His mom gave him a small nod of thanks, then turned to speak to Izuku again.

"Izuku-kun, do you want to come see Grandma's house?" Shouta couldn't help but think she embraced her new role of 'grandma' extremely quickly, "There's a big garden and backyard and also trees for climbing."

"But you just met me today?"

Confusion laced Izuku's plaintive tone, and his mom looked taken aback for a split second, before continuing, surprise fading into kindness.

"You're Shouta's son, my son's son," She said softly, "And that makes you family to me."

Izuku looked conflicted, which was understandable. He had already been uneasy just entering the Iida's place, their territory, and he had been previously acquainted with both Tensei and Tenya already.

But for someone he had just met not even ten minutes prior, there was no way, not even if she was his grandma.

Right?

"What… What do you grow in the garden?"

"We've got a lot of tomatoes still on the vine, the small ones," His mom responded happily; her garden was something she always put a lot of effort in maintaining, the surplus usually going to neighbors, "Some beans, cucumbers, and gourds as well."

Would Izuku really agree to go visit his childhood home for what his mom's garden yielded?

Or would Izuku refuse, forcing her to choose a different location for this discussion?

Maybe they'd even get lucky and they could just do this through texts and emails at a later date. Less messy and much more logical that way.

"I like the small tomatoes," Izuku, the guileless traitor, commented, "Okay."

They would now be forced to endure likely hours of awkward conversation due to Izuku's enjoyment of snacking tomatoes.

Wonderful.

“Mom,” He called, getting her attention as they walked together, Hizashi taking Izuku’s hand, into the station, “We can’t stay for long, alright?”

“The hotel we booked a room in is in Hosu, yeah,” Hizashi agreed, “We still gotta check in later.”

“Are you spending the weekend in Tokyo then?” She hummed as she peeked at him ordering their tickets, pointing out the train car that she had reserved her seat in; he obligingly reserved seats in the same car, “You can stay at the house instead.”

"But we were gonna go to the big park with the boats later," Izuku mused, "Won't it be too far away now?"

"Boats?" She echoed, snapping her fingers with her next words, "You must mean Inokashira Park, Izuku-kun," Shouta held back a sigh as his mom correctly deduced where they had planned to take Izuku, "That's actually pretty close to where we live, loads closer compared to where Hosu is."

"It is?"

"Mhm, we can all go together later if you'd like, Izuku-kun," She ushered them in the direction of the correct train, making sure everyone made it in before she also entered, "It's very pretty at night."

Izuku made a small sound of assent after he tapped at Hizashi's knee, getting a half-hearted shrug in response.

As the train started up, pulling out of the station, Shouta only hoped that his father would take the news of Izuku even a fraction as well as his mom did.

Assuming his mom didn't already message him about the whole 'we're grandparents!' thing already.

The scenery passed by quickly, his mom's voice bringing a measure of comfort to him as he let his eyes slide close.

What were they talking about?

Izuku’s favorite food? Potential allergies?

Was she already planning on spoiling her grandkid?

(He really hadn't thought he would have, but he had missed his mom.)

Hizashi could watch Izuku for now.

He needed to remember to show Hizashi the recording of Izuku and the Iidas he had on his phone.

Later, perhaps.

After a small nap.

The Aizawas' house never failed to impress Hizashi.

It was large and spacious, entirely over the top for someone as minimalistic as Shouta ended up being.

"Big."

Izuku murmured as he took it all in from the entrance gate.

"Come in, come in," Shoukimi-san entered first, stepping aside after she had switched into slippers, "Actually, let me go find some slippers for Izuku-kun." She started walking away, a mindful purpose in her step, "You know, Shouta, I'd be so much more prepared for this if you had let me know sooner!"

Shouta only let out his sigh after she was out of earshot.

"Are you really sure about this, Izuku?"

Perking up at his name, their son tilted his head after a second of thought.

"Shoukimi-san is Dad's mom, so I think it's okay," He patted Shouta's thigh in what he assumed was a gesture of comfort; fucking adorable, he loved him, "She grows a lot of snacks in her garden."

"She sure does," Shouta murmured, "And there she—wait, she still has those?"

Hizashi turned to see what had gotten his attention, the baffled tone that Shouta used making him curious as to what it could be. Izuku followed his movement, getting up on his toes.

Shoukimi-san had a pair of small slippers in her hands, and oh man, they were hideous. That googly-eyed cat on them stared up at him, unblinking, and yet Hizashi knew these were totally up kid-Shouta's alley.

“Here you go, Izuku-kun,” She placed the slippers down in front of him, “I’m going to get some water boiling for tea and some snacks put together and then we can all meet up again on the engawa overlooking the garden, alright?” Then straightening up and taking the box of jelly pouches from Shouta, made her way in the direction of the kitchen, “Just let me know if you need anything!”

“Will do, Shoukimi-san!”

He called after her, picking up the suitcase with his hero gear in it, turning to Shouta who was still staring at his old slippers, which were now located snugly on Izuku’s feet.

“Hey, Shou, I’m gonna drop off my stuff in your old room, yeah?”

Blinking at his words and then giving him a small nod, Shouta passed him the duffet he had containing what he had packed for himself and Izuku.

“Take this with you, will you?”

“Gotcha!” He slung it over his shoulder, his feet already heading in the direction of where he remembered Shouta’s room to be; Izuku waved at him as he left, “See you in a bit!”

As he got further away, Shouta’s voice was barely audible, though he could tell he was talking to Izuku again. Probably asking about how much Izuku wanted Shoukimi-san and Genchi-san to know.

(Where was Genchi-san anyway? Was he out of town for work or something?)

This was something that they always asked Izuku before arranging meetings between him and others. Though this time, with the suddenness of the whole situation, they hadn’t been able to clear up any of that with Izuku.

Before he knew it, he arrived at Shouta’s room.

Sliding the door open, he felt a wave of nostalgia as he took in the sight.

The last time he had been in here had been when they had been teenagers, spending some quality time together while studying for their finals. Though Shoukimi-san had insisted that the door stay open the entire time, she did bring in a steady stream of hot tea and snacks for their study session.

He placed his gear and their duffels by the door, heading into the room proper to pull the window open. Not knowing how often this room was aired out, it was better that he did it now since it would be where they would be staying this weekend. He also took the chance to take the futon out from the closet as well, heaving it onto the veranda so it would get a chance to air out at the same time. After a moment of thought, the pillows joined the futon out into the hot sun, a drying cover he found also getting slung over the futon.

Shoukimi-san was usually very pretty on point when it came to things like this, but better safe than sorry. Well, better safe than moldy or dusty.

Shouta did have a bed, but he didn’t think they’ll all fit on it anyways, so it was better to have options.

Making a mental note to return later to flip everything he put out to air, he left, swinging by the entrance to grab his boots, heading out to the back garden.

By the time he had gotten there, Shouta and Izuku were already well situated on the engawa, sitting next to each other and speaking in low voices.

They both turned to look at him as he stepped onto the wood of the engawa, leaving his slippers behind next to theirs.

“Papa!” Izuku greeted him, “You’re back!”

“I’m back, ‘Zuku!” He enthusiastically replied, lowering himself down to sit next to them, “And how have you been in the last fifteen minutes or so I was gone?”

Giggling, Izuku patted Shouta’s arm until he was handed his phone.

“We were talking about your wiggles!”

His what now?

“My… wiggles?”

“Yeah!” He tapped at the phone, a video recording popping up, “Dad recorded your wiggles.”

Hizashi pressed the play button and immediately had to suppress the urge to scream at how cute Izuku was, responding to his cues. Getting Tenya and then also Tensei to join him afterwards? He loved it.

And then he saw the wiggles.

Oh, there was so much wiggling.

He let out a cry of joy; the sheer power of audience participation was too much for him to express in any other way.

Almost immediately, he was met with Shouta’s glare, Erasure already activated.

Yeah, alright. He didn’t want to pay for any window damages today either.

“Was the wiggling fun?” Izuku asked, giving the phone back to Shouta after the recording cut off, looping back to the beginning, “It looked like you were having fun.”

“Oh, it was fun enough,” He laughed, “Looks totally different when I’m watching it though.”

(The studio that this had been recorded in had been so fucking hot with all the lights and considering he wore leather as part of his hero ensemble, it wasn’t a good combination. He was glad that it didn’t show on camera.)

He had to get Shouta to send a copy of that recording to him as soon as reasonably possible.

Hizashi needed it.

Wiggling his eyebrows in Shouta’s direction, he nearly missed Shoukimi-san stepping onto the engawa, a tray of drinks and light snacks in hand.

Izuku’s attention was immediately drawn towards her, eyes tracking the descent of the tray.

“Feel free to help yourselves,” Shoukimi-san joined them on the engawa after placing everything down, “There’s no need to hold back.”

Snagging a senbei for himself, he crunched into it. He hadn’t had lunch yet, unlike Shouta and Izuku, wanting to leave right after he had finished up his live session. There had been a slight hope that he would get out early enough to grab lunch with them, but this was alright as well. Shoukimi-san only ever had the highest quality of snacks.

It was atmospheric, really.

The sun was up, but they were covered by the shade given by the eaves and trees. Birdsong surrounded them and Izuku wasn’t screaming at the birds. It was nice.

Instead, Izuku looked entranced with the garden, his eyes wandering and taking everything in.

The bright reds of the cherry tomatoes did look amazing in contrast to the leafy greenery. And if they were as good as they were a few years back, then he knew Izuku would love them.

“Izuku-kun, feel free to go play in the garden, okay?” Shoukimi-san offered, “Just make sure to wash any tomatoes you eat first.” She gestured to the side of the house, “There’s a hose hanging over here.”

“Okay!”

And with those parting words, Izuku shucked off his hoodie and jumped off the engawa, putting his sandals back on and rushed out into the garden. To no one’s surprise, he headed straight to the tomatoes, finger poking at one before apparently deeming it snack worthy, plucking it off it’s stem.

He then rushed over to where the hose was located, a small squeal leaving him as he splashed himself with as he turned on the hose. Izuku washed the small tomato with focus, rubbing it on all sides before popping it into his mouth, eyes brightening as he bit down.

Rushing back to the vines, he plucked off a few more and returned to the hose, then came back over to them, the washed tomatoes in hand.

“They’re good,” He offered them each a tomato, “Here.”

And they were very good.

There was a moment of silence between them, only punctuated by the crunch of senbei and the cherry tomatoes Izuku had left them with.

Shoukimi-san took a sip from her cup of green tea; it was some high quality stuff, the scent of it was alluring.

“Alright, get explaining, you two.”

And explained they did.

He and Shouta took turns speaking, clearing up how they had met Izuku while he had been living on the streets. How Shouta had absolutely not gotten anyone pregnant as a teenager. How they had slowly earned Izuku’s trust over months and how he eventually came to live with them after an incident had occurred.

Shoukimi-san looked appropriately horrified throughout their long explanation, hand covering her mouth as she gasped at the abridged and edited version of Izuku’s story they had decided on. He could only imagine how much more outraged she would have been if she knew the whole story, but complete knowledge of Izuku’s situation was classified for a reason, and a good one at that.

“Well, I’m glad Izuku-kun is alright with you two now,” She nibbled at a dried persimmon, nudging the plate over in their direction, “The streets are no place for a young child like him.” Shouta took one; he always did like persimmons, “You really could have told us earlier though.”

“Izuku has trouble with people at times,” He delicately pointed out, “Trust doesn’t come easy with him.”

“And you two would have insisted on meeting him immediately as well,” Shouta added, already halfway through his hoshigaki, “Causing him unneeded stress.”

“Speaking of, where is Izuku?” Shouta looked across the expanse of the garden, “I haven’t heard from him in a while.”

He craned his head, searching, though he was also unable to spot Izuku.

“Izuku?” He called out, stamping down on the trace of alarm in his throat; how had they gotten so engrossed in conversation that they had missed Izuku disappearing from the garden? “Buddy, where are you?”

“Papa!”

Hearing Izuku’s voice made him feel marginally calmer, but not having him in his direct sight after that small surge of panic didn’t make him feel too much better.

“I hear you, Izuku, but I don’t see you?!”

“Papa!” Izuku’s voice called again, “I think I need help!”

“Coming!” He shoved his feet into his boots, Shouta already by his side, Shoukimi-san waving them ahead as she went back for her shoes inside the house, “We’re coming!”

They both ran out into the garden, keeping their eyes peeled for Izuku.

“Izuku, tell us where you are,” Shouta bit out, turning, even squatting down to make sure Izuku hadn’t gotten himself stuck under the engawa, “Please.”

“You can’t laugh at me,” Izuku’s voice sounded closer now, closer than it had been before, “Okay?”

“We would never!” He protested, “Promise!”

They just wanted to find their kid safe and sound.

Anything else didn’t matter.

“Look up.”

Both he and Shouta swung their gaze up, immediately spotting Izuku.

Izuku, who had seemingly gotten himself up into the branches of Shouta’s favorite persimmon tree.

“How.”

He agreed with Shouta.

How had Izuku gotten up there in the first place?

It wasn’t as if this tree was easy to climb either without extra help.

Actually, if he squinted, he could see some vague shapes behind Izuku, partially hidden behind the leaves and branches of the tree.

“Are those wings?!”

He blurted out, ducking his head down to try to get a look at a different angle.

“I just wanted to pick a persimmon for Dad…” Izuku whined, the wings (and yes, they were very much wings) on his back shifting, the feathers awkwardly splayed out, caught between the branches, “But I got stuck.”

He hid his wince.

Persimmons didn’t even ripen until autumn.

But, it was the thought that counted!

He knew Shouta felt the same, despite the alarm visible in his eyes.

Thankfully, this seemed to be an easy fix.

Shouta just had to erase his quirk and Izuku would be free to come down again. And since Shouta had brought his capture weapon along with him, Izuku wouldn’t need to jump down from where he was or anything either!

“Do you need me to use Erasure?” Shouta asked, stance tense, “Be careful up there, Izuku.”

Right.

There was that danger that Izuku might just fucking fall out of the tree before they could help him down.

“But, I don’t want you to erase my quirk,” Izuku’s voice was low, but still audible, “I can fly right now with my wings.”

“Izuku,” Hearing Shouta’s voice strained like this made him hurt; hearing Izuku denying help made it hurt even worse, “You can’t fly anywhere if you’re stuck in a tree.”

“But I don’t want to lose my wings again!” Sounding upset and close to tears, Izuku hugged the trunk of the tree, “I just got them back!”

“And you’ll get them back again,” Shouta replied with a forced calm, “I promised you this, didn’t I?”

Izuku didn’t say anything to that, only his sniffles being heard.

“You trust me, don’t you, Izuku?”

And though Shouta’s voice was low, Izuku still nodded in response.

“So, can I use Erasure on you?”

Izuku gave him another nod, a small one, but that was all Shouta needed, his quirk flaring in activation once he had permission.

It was a sad sight, he had to admit, seeing the wings disappearing from Izuku’s back. And he was sure Izuku felt the same, a small sob leaving his lips as it happened.

Hizashi resolved to keep Izuku by his side for the rest of the day, able to provide a steady source of hugs and cuddles. He was sure they both needed that after this adventure.

After that, it was laughably easy to get Izuku out of the tree, Shouta swinging himself up and then back down, their son in his arms.

Shoukimi-san then came running up to them, Genchi-san following behind her, ladder in tow.

“You got him down already?”

“Dad,” Shouta greeted as Izuku cried into his shirt, “You look like you’re in good health.”

“Shouta,” Genchi-san sighed, sharp eyes taking the sight in front of him, “Care to explain why your mother came running to me in a panic because some kid got stuck in a tree in our garden?”

“Congratulations, Dad,” Shouta flatly replied, patting Izuku’s back as he hiccuped, “You’re a grandpa.”

There was a moment of silence between all of them, only punctuated by Izuku’s occasional hiccup.

“And you’re grounded.”

Notes:

    Genchi > Grounded. Go think about what you've done.
    Izuku > *crying louder*
    Shouta > ( ꒪Д꒪)ノ
    Shouta > I didn't get anyone pregnant!

    Off to a rocky start, but they'll get things straightened out, no worries!

    Grandpa is introduced! His name is Aizawa Genchi; the kanji in his given name meaning 厳 “Strict” and 地 “Land" respectively.

    How did Izuku get up into the tree? He just really wanted to pick a persimmon from his dad's favorite tree. Before he knew it, he had made it up there, much to his surprise! Getting stuck was not part of his master plan though.

    They do all go visit Inokashira Park together! Grandparents taking all the photos of Shouta, Hizashi, and Izuku in a swan boat xD

    Please let me know your thoughts! :D And thank you so much for all the comments! <33

    Next chapter comes out January 22nd! It's a lazy day, perfect for laundry :)

Chapter Text

Wednesdays were cleaning days.

It was something Shouta had decided early on when he and Hizashi had moved in together.

They had been fresh graduates from U.A. at the time, just about ready to step into the working world as pro heroes.

Living in Musutafu had been a choice his parents had not approved of, but he hadn't wanted to deal with too much of a commute, going and returning from patrols. A tired pro was an unaware one; he and Hizashi couldn't afford that. And he was sure his parents wouldn't have enjoyed the regular sight of him coming home, bloody and bruised.

For Hizashi, who had both his jobs based in Musutafu, it had been a decision based on convenience mostly. This way, he'd be able to spend his downtime at home without having to drive, or ride the train back.

It also meant his parents wouldn't be able to hover over them, and he really did need less of that.

If it had been up to his parents, they would have all stayed living at their estate. And while he did love his childhood home, it wasn't where he wanted to live with Hizashi.

And now armed with the knowledge of Izuku's addition to the family, they had actually tried to convince them to move in with them, again, offering to regularly babysit Izuku when they had work and to help raise him.

Thankfully, Izuku had taken a rather adamant stance against moving away from the apartment, his cheeks puffing out almost comically as he argued against moving to Musashino.

Plus, there was the fact that both U.A. and the gymnastics class he was enrolled in were located in Musutafu. Everything Izuku was familiar with was located in Musutafu.

It just wasn’t logical to uproot themselves from their established home.

His parents hadn’t been too happy to hear that, but they had relented after hearing Izuku talk about how much he loved living at their apartment. About how he liked being able to see everything from up high at his window or by the balcony and how he liked pushing the button on the elevator to get to their floor.

And when Izuku got rambling about things he was passionate about, he would lose his usual reticence, even with people he had just met.

This wasn’t always a good thing though.

The things that Izuku was into could range from the facts he learned in his book about owls and heroes he saw on television, to keeping his territory free of other intruding predators and small critters he wanted to try to have for lunch one day.

Their kid was one of many varying interests, to say the least.

In the end, they had spent their entire weekend in Musashino, deciding to just take advantage of all the activities that could be done together in Inokashira Park.

(Hizashi had initially wanted to take Izuku to the zoo as well, but had quickly changed his mind when he remembered that the guinea pig petting zoo was right by the main zoo's entrance. Maybe when Izuku had a better grasp of his quirk and accompanying instincts, they would be able to pay it a visit, but as of now, it was just asking for Izuku to get himself banned.)

During their short stay, Izuku had already managed to charm both his parents, not that he expected anything less.

And despite how this had all started as an unpleasant surprise, it had ended well enough, Izuku even cheerfully waving ‘goodbye’ to them before they got onto the train to start their trip back home.

However, now that they were back home and all settled again, they had a lot to go through.

Specifically, a lot of new clothes to go through.

While he wasn’t a big fan of clothes shopping, his mom was, and he had a sizable amount of clothes as a kid. And since they were still in good condition, they had been kept in storage at their house.

But now that they had Izuku, they could be put to use again.

Before all of that though, everything was due for a good wash and that was what cleaning day was for.

They didn’t have a washing machine or a dryer in their apartment, or their building, but they did have a laundromat not too far away perfectly suited for their use.

Izuku was usually pretty good about taking care of his clothes, though with his quirk’s newfound ability to let him sprout wings even as a human, he knew something was going to have to change before he tore more shirts open.

(The poor kid had been distressed enough when he found out that his wings had ripped open the back of the shirt he had been wearing, apologizing profusely to him for something he couldn’t have controlled anyway.)

It seemed more shopping was in their future, this time for clothing that could accommodate Izuku’s wings if they came out; he knew Hizashi would be more than happy to take over the reins there. That was good, because he didn’t even want to touch another trip to the mall any time soon.

“Dad?”

Shouta looked down at the call of Izuku’s voice, finally turning away from the stovetop he had been cleaning.

“Yes, Izuku?” He turned on the faucet, rinsing off his towel, “Is there something you need?”

“No,” Izuku shook his head, “I just wanted to know if you needed any help.”

“Did you already finish sorting through the clothes you wanted to keep?”

“Mhm!” He looked proud of himself, a smile playing on his lips, “I even put them in groups like when you do laundry.”

(Izuku had only gone with him to the laundromat once before, usually staying home with Hizashi if it was an option. However, Hizashi had to go in for work that day, so Izuku had tagged along with him instead. He didn't like the ever-present humming of the machines in the background of the laundromat, quietly admitting to him that it reminded him of that alleyway he stayed in back then, but he had enjoyed getting the chance to hug the clean laundry once it came out of the dryer.)

“Good job,” He praised as he squeezed the dirty water out of his towel, dunking it back in to absorb more water so he could do it again, “Is there anything that needs to go into the laundry in your room?”

“I don’t think so,” Izuku replied after a moment of thought, “I put everything in the hamper already.”

“Why don’t you check for me, alright?” He encouraged, “I'm almost done here, so afterwards, we can all have a snack together.”

“Okay, I’ll check!”

Shouta watched as Izuku disappeared into the hallway and presumably his room, shaking his head as he heard Hizashi’s voice excitedly call after him. Hizashi was supposed to be in charge of vacuuming and dusting the living room, not following their son around with his feather duster.

He could hear their giggles even over the news station he had turned to for a bit of white noise while cleaning.

Tsukauchi had given him a heads up just the other day, warning him that there had been a few isolated cases of arson in Musutafu recently, the perpetrator (or perpetrators) still at large.

“I worry that this might cause Izuku-kun stress,” He had admitted to him, voice tired, “We’re currently following up on some new information, but there’s a chance that this might be a serial arsonist’s work.”

“A serial arsonist?”

“Well, it’s a possibility, Aizawa,” Tsukauchi had then offered him a cup of coffee, which he had accepted, “The other possibility is that it’s an established group of arsonists with a leader calling the shots.”

“That’s not much better.”

“It isn’t, but with that one, we have some old information we can go off of,” He tapped at the folder on his desk, “And something is better than nothing.”

Shouta had let out a sigh at that point.

“Are you asking me to join this case?”

Tsukauchi had looked sheepish at this point.

“No, not exactly,” He had denied, hands held up in front of him, “I just wanted to warn you and well, with Midoriya Hisashi still out there, new arson cases aren't exactly what I’d call encouraging.”

“And do you think Midoriya is involved?”

“He doesn’t have a criminal record technically,” Tsukauchi had looked troubled when saying that, “But from what we know about him from his own past actions, and what we’ve heard from Izuku-kun, I wouldn’t think his involvement far-fetched.”

Tsukauchi wasn’t wrong, something Hizashi had agreed with when he had shared the update with him.

He didn’t like it.

They had debated against informing Izuku about this whole possible situation, but having him unaware was arguably worse, so they had told him.

Izuku hadn’t liked the news, but had shakily thanked them for telling him.

Hizashi had then offered him a hug afterwards and Izuku, already fragile from hearing the news, had burst into tears.

It made him feel awful that they had caused this distress, but it was better that they told him now, allowing him time to adjust to that knowledge.

(It was also true that they didn’t know if Midoriya Hisashi even knew if Izuku was alive. He hoped that he didn’t, though it wasn’t as if he had even argued for custody. However, Izuku didn’t need any of that in his life. Midoriya had proven time and time again that he had been a horrible father and he was not willing to put in the time and effort it took to raise a child. Izuku was still battling with what Midoriya had inadvertently taught him, struggling at times to figure out why they would care about his hobbies or wanted to make his favorite meals even if it wasn’t a special occasion.)

However, Izuku did seem to be feeling a lot better now, at least compared to last night. He had been a bit worried that the news might key up Izuku’s paranoia, but it hadn't seemed to happen yet; it would have to be something he kept an eye out for.

A bark of laughter broke him out of his thoughts and he could only hope that Hizashi was still getting some dusting done in there.

The kitchen was now clean.

And that brought up the amount of newly clean rooms up to three.

There was only Izuku’s room left.

Shouta debated with himself, wondering if he should go check in on them, but decided against it at the moment.

He had promised Izuku that they would have snacks after he had finished up and he wasn’t in the business of telling falsehoods to his own kid.

So he would put together something quick and then check in on them.

And by then, hopefully Hizashi had finished his dusting in there and Izuku had finished giving his room a once-over for anything else that might need to be thrown in with the laundry.

All he had to deal with now was snack time.

Izuku thought he kept his room pretty clean.

There couldn’t be anything else he missed, right?

He had peeked behind his shelf, under his desk, and even gone under his bed to search for anything that might need to get washed.

“Does Nedzu-san need to be washed?” His Papa had asked him, laughing when he immediately picked up said Nedzu-san and hugged him, “Aw, ‘Zuku, he’s gotta go in eventually.”

“Not this time,” He insisted, turning Nedzu-san to face his Papa, “And I don’t think Nedzu-san wants to go into a washing machine either.”

“He’ll come out warm and toasty out of the dryer though,” His Papa pointed out, “You like warm and toasty.”

His Papa wasn’t wrong.

He did like warm and toasty things.

But this was Nedzu-san!

What if his paws got caught in the washing machine and got pulled off?!

Or what if his Dad forgot to separate the colors of the laundry and Nedzu-san got stained a different color?

(He didn’t think his Dad would actually forget, but there was always that possibility he would get distracted by a villain attack by the laundromat and just toss everything into the machine quickly, so he could start the washing cycle and not waste any laundry time while fighting crime.)

No, it was just better that Nedzu-san stayed with him in his room.

His Papa shrugged at his shake of the head, but didn’t try to convince him again, choosing to start dusting the top of his shelf instead. It was too high for him to reach up there and since he still couldn’t fly yet, it was up to either his Papa or his Dad to clean.

Placing Nedzu-san back down on his bed, he returned to checking for anything that might have been left behind.

“Hey, ‘Zuku?” His Papa called his name after a couple of minutes, “What about your bag?”

His bag?

Izuku slid himself out from under his bed again, his Papa giving him a small wave when their gazes met.

“My bag?”

He repeated, eyes going to the bag he had hanging on the hook installed into the side of his desk. It was the bag he was supposed to be using when he started going to school again, already stocked with notebooks, pencils, and whatever else he thought might be needed for learning from Nedzu-san at U.A.

“Your old one, ‘Zuku,” Tapping the shelf it was on, his Papa even gave it an exaggerated sniff and wrinkled his nose, “This one needs to go into the wash, yeah?”

Izuku gave his poor yellow backpack a forlorn look.

It was something his Mama had given him in the end, the very last thing she had given him before he had to go off and hide, so he knew it had been a while ago since it had been last washed. And it had gone with him from where he had started in the alleyway to where he was now.

(He remembered that he used to sit on it, clinging to the tough material with his talons when he had been scared, thunderstorms impossibly loud to his owl senses, keeping it by his side when he had missed his Mama so much that it had hurt. And this backpack had been the closest he could get to his Mama back then. He had nothing else.)

His old backpack had gone through a lot.

It was now dirty and full of holes from his talons. He was surprised that his Dad didn’t point it out himself whenever he came to visit him in his room; he was usually very good at picking out things that were dirty and needed washing.

That must have been something he learned from always doing the dishes.

He had lots of practice in doing dishes.

Izuku couldn’t wait until he was tall enough to be of more use around the apartment; instead of always having to depend on his parents to do things for him, he could do more for them instead!

“It needs to go into the wash.”

He agreed as he picked the backpack up.

“Do you want to continue using it after it’s clean?” His Papa continued, pointing at all the places where his talons had poked right through it, “You can ask Shouta to help you sew the holes up if you want.”

Izuku shook his head.

“I’ve already got the new one that Dad got for me,” He explained, carrying the backpack with him out of his room, “This one can stay at home on the shelf for now.”

For now, until he felt like he didn’t need it anymore.

It might not be of any use to anyone anymore now, but it didn’t mean that it still didn’t mean a lot to him.

“Whatever works for you, ‘Zuku,” Giving him a thumbs up and following him to the hallway, he called after him, “Just make sure to empty it out before putting it with the rest of the stuff, yeah?”

He was actually pretty sure he had taken everything out of it already, but he nodded all the same.

“I will, Papa.”

His Papa retreated back into his room after hearing his reply, humming starting up as he started up his dusting again.

The living room was empty, but he could see his Dad in the kitchen pouring out drinks into cups.

Was it snack time already?

He quickly shoved his hands into his old backpack after he unzipped it, feeling around the bottom and then the sides.

Like he expected, there was nothing in there.

He had gone through the contents of this bag a lot back when he was staying in that alleyway, and he knew every single item that his Mama had sent him off with.

Tossing the backpack in the general direction of the piles of clothes he had organized, he winced hearing it clink against the wooden floor instead.

Accurately throwing light objects was apparently not as easy as he thought it might be.

It had made an odd sound too.

He hoped he didn’t scuff the flooring with the zipper or something, because what else could have made a sound like that?

His Dad would surely be disappointed in him if he left a mark in the floor.

Lowering himself down onto his knees, he checked for any mark his backpack could have left on the floor, breathing out a small sigh of relief when he found none.

“Izuku?” He looked up to see the confused face of his Dad looking down at him, the snack tray in his hand, “What are you doing?”

“Something in the bag made a funny sound against the floor,” He pointed to his bag on the floor, “So I wanted to check that it didn't leave anything behind.”

His Dad hummed in acknowledgement of his words, placing the tray down on the coffee table.

There was tea for the adults and a glass of milk for him! A quick glance at the small plate next to the drinks revealed that today’s snack was dorayaki, the warmed red bean-filled snacks stacked on top of one another.

Stooping down and picking up his bag, his Dad turned it upside-down, shaking it a few times, nothing coming out. He then stuck his hand in (like he had earlier) and searched the insides.

Nothing.

 

Right?

His Dad made a disgruntled sound as he removed his hand from his bag, plopping it down in it's own pile on the floor.

“There’s something in there,” He told him as he made his way to the hallway, “Give me a minute to get it out.”

There was something there?

Izuku waited until his Dad entered his room, and then he started searching again, fingers digging for what he could have missed.

It took a few extra seconds to find whatever it was, but he had been watching his Dad search, and he had been feeling along the insides of it, not just the bottom and sides like he had done.

What he felt was round, like a coin.

Had his Mama left him with money?

How odd.

His Dad soon returned with tiny scissors, his Papa following behind with his dusting rag.

“Whatcha find in there?”

“It might be money,” He offered his Dad his backpack, “It’s shaped like it.”

“Well, whatever it is, I’m not putting it into a washing machine,” His Dad grumbled as he snipped at the small threads inside of his backpack, “It’ll just give me a headache.”

His Papa looked interested, watching his Dad pull out a small coin.

It was gold in color and rather pretty with tiny birds on its surface.

“It’s not Japanese currency,” His Papa held out his hand for it, his Dad dropping into his palm, “And it’s not from any country I’m familiar with either.”

“Can I see?” He asked, raising himself up onto his toes and pulling gently at his Papa’s arm, “I wanna see.”

“Sure thing, ‘Zuku,” His Papa lowered his hand to show him the coin resting there, “It’s kinda neat, isn’t it?”

“Yeah,” He agreed, turning the coin over to marvel at the shininess of it, then turning it over again to look at the birds, “I’m not sure why it was in there though.” He ran a finger against the imprints, “I don’t remember ever seeing it.”

“That’s the question of the hour, isn’t it?” His Papa turned the coin around a few more times, returning it to his Dad who had held his hand out for it, “An odd mystery!”

“It had to have been from your mom,” His Dad was studying the coin now, “So there had to have been a reason she left you with this.”

He thought about it.

It was true that his Mama had been the one to give him this backpack, but she hadn’t mentioned anything about what was inside to him. She had just given it to him and told him to go hide, and that had been what he had done.

“There’s just something familiar about it, I gotta admit,” Tapping at his chin, his Papa had his ‘thinking face’ on as he spoke, “And since we know it’s not some form of official currency, the only option is unofficial, yeah?”

“The Underground deals in information and shady favors, Hizashi,” His Dad gave him an exasperated look, “Not in tiny golden bird coins.”

“Okay, fine, not currency,” His Papa snatched the coin from his Dad, fingers tracing around the edge of the ridges found on the coin, “It’s definitely suspicious though, Shou,” Finding nothing, he then started inspecting the birds on the front again, “This is from Izuku’s mom. She gave this to Izuku and died for her troubles.”

“You’re right about that.”

Izuku didn’t like the sound of that.

His Mama had died after leaving him with her last words and this coin and they couldn’t even figure out what it was for.

This was horrible!

“She was willing to die for this,” HIs Dad repeated slowly, “And she did die, Hizashi.” His next words were tense, though his expression was somewhere between shock and realization, “We missed something huge.”

“We did?” His Papa echoed, “What?”

“Izuku told us that she had been the one to send him off, but we know from Tsukauchi that the dates of Izuku leaving and her death don’t match,” As he explained slowly, his Dad’s voice started getting strained, “We also know that Midoriya Hisashi didn’t care about Izuku, so Izuku’s role in this had been a non-issue.” His Papa started to grow paler as well, “So when Midoriya came home, why did he kill his wife, someone we know he cared about?”

“That coin has to be it then, right?”

Izuku felt sick to his stomach hearing all of this.

His Mama had been killed because of some coin?

Why was this coin even so important anyways?

Izuku had never even seen the thing before!

He hated it now.

A horrible thought came to mind: if they had the coin now, did that mean Hisashi was gonna come and kill them all too?

“I’ll need to take this to Tsukauchi,” His Dad didn’t look happy as he spoke, his brows furrowed, “This is something he needs to know.” He turned to leave, pausing before he stepped into the hallway, “Hizashi, could you watch Izuku while I go?”

“Of course!” His Papa waved him off, “Sorry for putting my fingers all over that piece of evidence.” He continued, more sheepish, “Don’t think you can brush that for prints anymore.”

“You’re fine,” He finally started to walk down the hallway, his voice echoing slightly as he got further and further away, “It’s been in that hidden pocket for so long that there wouldn’t have been anything left to find.”

His Dad returned soon after, dressed in outside clothes and his capture scarf, his hands in his pocket.

“I need to go out, Izuku,” Crouching down to meet his eyes, his Dad didn’t look too happy to have to go out, “Sorry, I can’t have snack time with you today.”

“It’s okay, Dad,” He patted his Dad’s cheek, “I know this is important too. You gotta be careful going.”

“I'm always careful. I’ll get back as soon as I can, alright?” He brushed his stubbly chin against the side of his face; Izuku had to hold in his smile. He was a bit ticklish there, “But don’t wait for me.”

With those words, he left, locking the door behind him.

It was just him and his Papa now.

“Let’s go wash our hands, shall we?”

He nodded to his Papa’s request.

Deep down, he was still worried about the coin and learning the truth of why his Mama had her life taken away from her, but right now, there was nothing he could do about it.

His Mama’s death was something he had already come to terms with.

Even if he learned the true reason behind it, it wasn’t something that could bring her back.

It wouldn't change anything.

So for now, he would just focus on something else.

He still had his life to live, snacks to eat, and quirk to learn more about.

And that was fine by him.

”This is what I was afraid of, Aizawa.”

”So you recognize it. Tell me everything you know. Please.

”They call themselves ‘Firebird.’"

. . .

"And they’ve been operational for longer than either of us has been alive."

ARC II END

Notes:

    Izuku > Nedzu-san wouldn't like the washing machine.
    Izuku > If I put you in there, you wouldn't either, right?
    Hizashi >
    Hizashi > Please don't put Papa into the washing machine,,
    Izuku > (´ ꒳` )

    And that's a wrap on Arc II!

    The coin has finally been found and taken in, though Izuku, after hearing Shouta and Hizashi theorize about it, doesn't think very highly of it. At least his toasty dorayaki is delicious and he gets to dunk it in milk too!

    Izuku isn't quite willing to let go of Nedzu-san long enough to let him go into the washing machine, but at least he's still pretty clean, so it's alright xD

    Please let me know your thoughts! :D And thank you so much for all the comments! <33 I love reading them!

Chapter Text

Shinsou Hitoshi did not like going to the park.

If it were up to him, he would be at home, relaxing with a book.

However, it was not up to him, and his Mom didn’t like leaving him alone at home either, so here he was, at the park.

(Home was so different from the group facility he used to live in; the treatment he had gotten there was so bad that he had chanced living on the streets instead. And that was a decision he had never once regretted, not when it eventually led to how his life was now.)

“Hitoshi!” His Mom cheerfully ruffled his hair, forcing it to look even fluffier than usual, “The park isn’t that bad, is it?” He dragged his fingers through his hair, fixing it up so it didn’t stick up in too many directions, “Aw, don’t look so glum! Not like I could have left you at home!”

She totally could have!

Hitoshi always made sure to be on his best behavior always, never touching the stove when it was on or knocking into anything fragile.

He totally could have been left home alone!

“You can get some sunshine here,” She sat herself down onto one of the benches there, legs swinging, almost whimsical, “And I’ve got water if you need it.” Pulling out a small book from her bag, she made herself comfortable, angling herself under the shade, “Why don’t you go explore the park and play?”

He sighed, but he took the hint for what it was, and made his way across the park, making sure to keep track of any landmarks so he would be able to figure the way back when he wanted to return.

His Mom was nice, nicer than he deserved, really, but she had this weird obsession with wanting him to be more social and going out to find friends.

For someone like him though, someone with a quirk like his, it didn't seem very possible.

After some more wandering, Hitoshi found himself a nice empty clearing away from everyone else, hoping that no one would bother him.

The park was quiet where he was and he found himself tempted to lie down for a proper nap. He knew that was a bad idea though; doubly so, since no one was there to guard his napping body.

Honestly, a friend did sound like something fun to have, if only to have someone to chat with, unafraid of both him and his quirk. They could also watch over him as he took naps and he would do the same, obviously. If they shared his favorite animal, then they could go pet them together!

Maybe the park wasn't so bad, he decided as he rolled into a patch of warm sunshine. It gave him a moment of peace where his Mom didn't constantly crack jokes at him, trying to test out how funny they were.

(It was pretty awesome how she had never been afraid of his quirk though, never hesitating to answer him when he spoke. Not even stopping to think, offering him a place in her home, despite the child services people bringing up her age and eligibility against her. But they had allowed it in the end. With a quirk like his, there would be no one else that willing to take him in ever again. There had been no other choice in their eyes.)

The bushes then rustled.

Hitoshi immediately shot his gaze over to the bushes.

What could it be?

Could it be… a cat?

 

He would really like it if it was a cat.

A cute small cat that wouldn't mind if he gave them a scritch under the chin, that would honestly be the best.

However, big green eyes, decidedly un-catlike, met his own and all Hitoshi could feel was disappointment.

This was not a cat.

"Hi," The kid greeted him, "Can I ask you something?”

Hitoshi really didn’t want to be pulled into a conversation either.

But, if he answered the question quick enough, maybe he could be left alone again to daydream about petting cats.

It sure was odd though, not having a kid recognize him immediately and even dare to speak to him first.

One of the best things about being relatively new to an area for sure.

“Sure.”

Pulling a notebook out from underneath him, the bush kid—because that was where he came out from, duh—propped himself up on his elbows, flipping it open to a page already half-filled with writing.

Was he asking everyone he saw?

What a weird hobby.

“What's your favorite food?"

Hitoshi couldn't believe it.

He had been disturbed out of his daydreaming and potential nap just to be asked what his favorite food was?

Was this a joke?

It had to be.

Well, that didn't matter, did it?

He just had to give an answer and then the bush kid would go away.

"Wet cat food."

He gave a blank stare as the words left his lips, a small part of him wanting to delight in the inevitable confusion that his answer would result in.

“I’ve never had cat food before,” Somehow, the kid didn’t even look phased, quickly writing what he had said down, “Is it tasty?”

“It’s… great.”

Who was he kidding?

He hadn’t ever had cat food before, but it was for cats—it said so right in its name—so there was no way anyone would fall for this, right?

“I’ll have to try it then.”

What.

“I’ve had rats before though,” He continued, as if he hadn’t just committed to eating cat food in the future, “Have you ever had that?”

“No,” Hitoshi responded automatically, nose wrinkling, “And I’m pretty sure people aren’t supposed to.”

“I’m an owl, so it’s okay,” The kid replied, “And my Dad says owls are like cats with wings.”

An owl?

Hitoshi dragged his gaze over the kid again, trying to see anything that would make him an owl.

He saw precisely nothing that would give it away.

Was it his quirk?

Could he have actually eaten rats?

Honestly, he couldn’t imagine eating something like a rat. But if the kid wasn’t joking around and he really was an owl or something, that was believable enough.

Owls did eat rats.

But he was also pretty sure owls didn’t eat cat food.

Plus, he didn’t want to be responsible for getting some random kid sick because they ate cat food due to him saying that he liked eating it too.

(They might even think he used his quirk to force him to do that!)

Not only would his Mom be disappointed in him, but this would definitely not be how a hero would act.

And he wanted to be a hero when he grew up!

“Don’t eat cat food,” He cleared his throat, repeating himself, “Do not eat cat food, please.”

“But you said that it was your favorite food?”

The officials at the old group facility were right.

His mouth was absolutely going to get him into trouble one day.

Hitoshi just didn’t think it would be so soon!

“I lied,” Admitting that he had lied was awkward, but necessary, much to his embarrassment, “I was tired and wanted to be alone, so I just, gave you a joke answer.”

“Oh.”

The other kid didn’t look upset with him, which was good! He didn’t exactly like when people yelled at him; he hated it, to be exact. It reminded him of his old parents and all the yelling that they did. They weren’t people he wanted to remember.

“Do you think everyone else lied to me too?”

What?

He must have looked very confused, because the kid explained further.

“I asked other people before I asked you,” The notebook was tipped in his direction, neat hiragana detailing fried chicken, steak, and croquettes meeting his eyes, “Do you think they also lied?”

“Well, those other ones are edible,” He pointed out, “Does it matter?”

“It’s supposed to be a survey for.. school?” The kid paused on the last word, though he continued after a second of thought, “It’s like classwork.”

Classwork?

“Then it should be fine,” He thought it was fine, at least, “As long as it gets done, your teacher should be okay with that.” Actually, he had a good idea. Anything to get rid of the glum look that he had caused, “Here, why don’t I tell you my actual favorite food? Then you can know for sure that one of them isn’t false.”

“You’d do that?”

“Sure,” Hitoshi had to force himself not to wince at the grateful smile that was sent to him, “It’s kind of my fault that you’re even doubting the other answers, sorry.”

“It’s okay,” The kid reassured him, “I didn’t realize you wanted to be left alone.” He looked down, nodding an apology, “Sorry for bothering you.”

And now he felt awful.

 

No, no.

He was allowed to want to be left alone.

That was what his Mom told him all the time.

And that was what Mom's girlfriend reaffirmed as well.

He was allowed to want things.

"Whatever," He huffed, "Anyways, my favorite food is curry rice.” He felt a bit hungry just thinking about it; they were supposed to go get food soon, so he couldn’t wait for that, “And it has to be made by my Mom. She makes it the best."

"She must put love in it then," The kid nodded as he wrote it down into his notebook, penning it neatly under a crossed out ‘wet cat food’, “Love always makes food taste better.”

He sounded so confident in himself that Hitoshi found himself going over his memories, trying to remember if he had seen his Mom put anything that looked like ‘love’ into her curry.

(It would also be a lot easier to figure out if he knew what ‘love’ was supposed to look like. Was it some sort of spice or something?)

“Maybe,” Well, if there was something he was reasonably sure about, it was that his Mom did care a lot about him, so yeah, he guessed it was possible, “Next time she makes curry rice, I’ll watch for it.”

There was a moment of silence between the two of them before it broke, the kid finally moving so he wasn’t lying down on his stomach, getting up onto his feet.

“Um, thanks for helping me," He closed his notebook, both that and the pen he had been using disappearing into the pocket of the hooded poncho he wore, "I'll stop bothering you now."

As he started to return into the bushes (back where he came from!), Hitoshi found himself speaking up.

“Wait.”

The kid looked back at him, head tilted.

“You…” He did his best to not stammer, but thankfully, speech was not something he had an issue with, probably in part due to his quirk, “You don’t need to go.” However, speaking was just awkward at times and he hated how people would look at him when he did speak, as if he would use his quirk on them just like that, “You aren’t bothering me.”

And it was true.

Surprisingly, Hitoshi didn’t feel the familiar spike of irritation he usually felt when people spoke to him for more than a short period of time.

Then again, the kid obviously didn’t know what his quirk was and what it could do.

He might as well savor this for as long as it was possible.

“You’re sure I’m not bothering you?” The kid asked, “Like really really sure?”

“I’m sure,” He confirmed, patting the ground next to him, “You’re not bothering me.”

As soon as the kid lowered himself down next to him, Hitoshi realized he had no idea how to even continue the conversation. The only people he usually spoke to consisted of his Mom and sometimes her girlfriend. Sometimes his teacher would, for school things, but it was a lot more rare.

“My name is Izuku,” The kid—Izuku—spoke as he rearranged the front of his poncho so that it rested neatly over his crossed legs, “What’s yours?”

“Shin-” He started automatically, though as he heard the beginning of it come out, he stopped, the clack of his teeth audible, “It’s Hitoshi.” Correcting himself quickly, he could feel his face warm at the mistake he had made, “Fukukado Hitoshi.”

“Fu-ku-ka-do Hi-to-shi,” Izuku repeated after him a couple of times, then asked bluntly without a pause, “Is that a new name for you?”

Ah.

He was hoping that Izuku wouldn’t have noticed his slip-up.

“Sorta, I guess,” Hitoshi shrugged lightly, or at least he tried to, “I’m just not very used to using it in front of other people yet.”

"Are you adopted?"

What.

"How'd you know that?!"

He was pretty sure he never mentioned that in the previous conversation.

"I'm adopted too," Izuku nodded to him, looking very serious, "And my name also changed like that."

That did make sense, he guessed.

It was easier to recognize something if they also went through the same thing before.

"It gets easier, you know," Izuku then continued, "Using your new name." He paused, this time whispering to him, "I practiced in front of the mirror a lot."

“I did too,” Hitoshi whispered back; you were supposed to whisper when the other person whispered to you, he was pretty sure, “But I… Not a lot of people like to talk to me, so I guess… I’m still not used to it yet.”

“Why don’t people like to talk to you?” Izuku tilted his head to the side, eyes blinking up at him, his lips pulled into a pout, “That’s kinda mean of them.”

And that was the thing, wasn’t it?

If it was anyone else in his class treated this way, the teacher probably would have gotten involved to try and fix the situation.

But since it was him, since it was his quirk, he didn’t get anything like that.

If he was being honest with himself, he wouldn’t be surprised if Izuku stopped talking to him if he ever found out what his quirk was.

However, lying wasn’t a good thing to do.

He wanted to become a hero and heroes were good.

Lies were bad.

Hitoshi didn’t want to be bad.

He didn’t want to become what his teacher and classmates said he would eventually become.

A villain.

“Are you okay?”

Izuku didn’t touch him but he did shift himself closer, the worry clear in his tone.

“I’m okay,” He managed to get out, “I was just remembering something.”

To his surprise, Izuku only nodded at his reply, not immediately questioning him, like he thought he might do.

They stayed quiet for a while, the only sounds he could hear being the faint voices of other kids playing with each other and birds chirping up in the trees.

Izuku would look up at the trees whenever the chirps got close, digging his fingers into his poncho, wrinkling the cloth covering his knees.

There was a familiar hunger in his eyes.

A horrible sort of hunger which he had seen all too often when he had spent those days on the streets on his own.

(Hitoshi idly wondered if his Mom would mind if he invited Izuku to have lunch with them later.)

He remembered what had helped him best when he had been hungry was a distraction, so maybe that would work here in this situation as well.

Izuku had been nice to him so far, so he wanted to be nice back.

It was only right.

“You said you were an owl, right?” Hitoshi asked, hoping it wasn’t too nosy of a question that he came up with, “How does that work?”

“It’s my quirk!” Izuku chirped, his gaze leaving the branches of the tree above them, “I can transform into an owl!”

“That’s cool!” A transformation quirk was super cool and that it was able to be used to turn into an owl? Even cooler! “Can… Can you show me?”

Izuku slumped back down after hearing his question.

“I’m actually still working on being able to use my quirk properly,” He grumbled, looking sad, “Sorry, Hitoshi.”

“It’s okay,” He supposed that he was hoping for too much; Izuku was shorter than he was, so he had to be younger as well. It made sense that he didn’t have that much control over his quirk yet, “You’re still a kid.”

“I’m a big kid though,” Izuku huffed, “I’m eight years old.”

“No way!” Hitoshi made himself sit up as straight as he could, “I’m eight!” He watched as Izuku did the same (still not reaching his height), “And you’re tiny!”

"I'll grow though!" Izuku insisted, and well, yes, he most likely would later, but this was now! Izuku was tiny right now and he was the same age as him! "You're just really tall!"

However, he wasn't wrong about that.

Hitoshi knew he was tall for his age; he was taller than all kids in his class at school, if he took out the kid with a giraffe mutation quirk at least.

"You're smaller than everyone else in my class though too," Hitoshi couldn't help but point out, "And they're all around our age."

Izuku did not look happy to hear that.

Should he not have mentioned his small size at all?

"But you're right in saying I'm really tall," He admitted, trying to at least make Izuku look less sad, "My Mom says I'm gonna be taller than her someday."

"My wingspan as an owl is going to be as tall as my Dad," Izuku then replied, his arms held out wide, "And my Dad is tall."

Hitoshi shrugged; it wasn't as if he knew how tall Izuku's Dad was or how big Izuku was as an owl.

(He had only ever seen one real owl in his life before, but that one had been pretty big. His Mom said that he might have even dreamed the bird up. Hitoshi didn’t think he did though. He didn’t think he could have dreamt up those big piercing green eyes and that call that had brought a pro hero to where he was. That owl, dream owl or not, was his hero too.)

"Hitoshi," Izuku suddenly looked really serious, all previous signs of playfulness gone from his eyes and frame, "I'll show you my quirk one day, okay?" He then wrinkled his nose at him, "And maybe by then, I'll even be taller than you."

Somehow, Hitoshi doubted that last statement. Izuku had a lot of growing to do if he wanted to catch up to him. By then, he'd probably be taller as well. Maybe he would even be as tall as All Might!

(Being that tall would be nice. He'd be able to reach all the highest shelves at home or at the supermarket for his Mom!)

“What about your quirk?”

His quirk.

Asking anyone what their quirk was was practically an open invitation for them to ask the same question back. It was a common courtesy, just like saying ‘please’ and ‘thank you’. From what he observed in school, people usually liked talking about their quirks, so it made sense they’d ask about yours just so you had to ask about theirs, if you wanted to be polite anyways.

It was something he had experienced often enough, though whenever it did happen, it never ended well for him.

“Hitoshi, it’s okay if you don’t wanna talk about it,” Izuku lowered his voice again, as if he thought there might be people sneaking around and listening to their conversation, “There are things I don’t like talking about either.”

And it wasn’t as if he didn’t like his quirk.

His quirk was very powerful, (his Mom had told him this), and a powerful quirk was a good thing to have if he wanted to be a pro hero.

So he liked it.

It seemed as if he was the only one that did though, among people his age at least.

“I don’t think you’ll like my quirk,” He admitted after a few more seconds of silence, “No one ever does.”

“But why not?” Izuku asked, “I think all quirks are cool in their own way.”

“My classmates call it ‘evil’,” He looked away, not wanting to see Izuku recoil at what he said, “They say my quirk is one that a villain would have.”

“That’s so mean,” Izuku gasped instead, “You shouldn’t be friends with people that call your quirk evil, Hitoshi.”

Hitoshi couldn’t help the harsh laugh that left him.

“I don’t have any friends, Izuku.”

What a joke.

Friends.

“If you want, I can be your friend,” Izuku looked uncertain as he spoke, both hands now hidden in his pockets, “But only if you want me to be.”

He didn’t know what to say to this.

Friends?

With him?

“Why would you want to be my friend?”

Hitoshi asked, trying to make sure his voice didn’t shake.

What was this feeling inside of him that was making him want to punch a tree?

Making a friend couldn’t be this easy, could it?

 

Except that it could.

He knew it could.

Before he had used his quirk for the first time, friends were that easy to make.

It had been a long time since then though; a long time since his quirk had manifested, and a long time since his old parents had decided that they couldn’t have a son like this, that he had to go for the sake of their happiness.

However, Izuku still didn’t know about his quirk.

What if he changed his mind after learning about it?

There was no doubt in his mind that he would eventually find out what it was.

He had so many classmates and it would only take accidentally meeting one of them in the streets for Izuku to learn from them what his quirk was. For them to purposely bump into Izuku in an attempt to break him free from the control his quirk had on a person, because of course they would assume that he would have no friends unless he brainwashed them into being his friends.

(That wasn’t even how his quirk worked, he was pretty sure!)

And it was illegal to use a quirk that way!

You needed a special license if you wanted to use your quirk anywhere you wanted.

He didn’t want to get taken away by the police.

Eraserhead, the pro hero that had found him on the streets, would probably be so disappointed in him if he got arrested for something like that.

“Because you’re nice?” Izuku eventually replied, “And I think we could be good friends.”

Izuku thought they could be good friends?

That made him want to pull Izuku to him and give him the biggest hug he could give and then find the nearest cliff and scream over it, like in the shows his Mom liked to watch on the television.

He had to stop himself from doing all of that, even though he really wanted to. Because before he could, he had to tell Izuku about his quirk. There was no escaping it.

Better to tell him now than to have someone else do it and possibly do it wrong.

He was the one that knew his quirk best, so the job fell to him to do this.

“Let me tell you about my quirk first,” Hitoshi squashed down all his giddy feelings; those could come later when this all went well, if it went well, “You can decide if you want to be friends with me after that.”

“I already know what I want.”

Izuku didn’t look too impressed with him.

Well, tough luck.

He wasn’t going to risk making a friend, getting attached, and then losing them when they would find out about his quirk.

Hitoshi was a lot, but an idiot was something he wasn’t.

He just didn’t want to get hurt like that again.

And that wasn’t wrong of him to want.

“My quirk is called ‘Brainwashing’,” He shot a quick glance over at Izuku who only blinked back at him, “It lets me tell other people what to do after they respond to me.” Biting his lip, he looked away, “And they have to do what I say.”

Silence met his words.

 

So this was it.

Hitoshi could feel the hope he had felt earlier dimming.

He really should have known better.

“I told you that I knew what I already wanted, Hitoshi.”

Izuku spoke frankly, expression barely changing.

“I mean, your quirk does sound really cool,” He then continued, something in his voice changing, shifting into something Hitoshi could recognize: pain, “But what your quirk is or what it isn’t… That’s not something that matters to me.” Izuku looked up and oh no, he looked like he was close to tears, “I’d want to be your friend even if you didn’t have a quirk.”

Hitoshi had a bad feeling that Izuku had experienced something similar to him before, getting hurt by other people and their words.

(With a quirk as cool as his though, even if he had very little control over it, how was that possible?)

“Really?”

He didn’t want to doubt Izuku’s words, but he knew it would hurt more if he didn’t ask, if didn’t know.

“Mhm,” Izuku nodded, his arm coming up to rub at his eyes, “Really.”

Usually, he was very good at controlling the tone of his voice, but in this case, he found his voice breaking, wavering like it was going to snap in half if he gave it the chance.

“Okay,” Despite his nerves, he felt light inside, “Then, yeah, I wanna be your friend too.”

Izuku gave him a delighted look, one that couldn’t be mistaken even with new tears welling up at the corner of his eyes.

He really wished he had some tissues in his pocket; all he had on him was a small slip of paper with his Mom’s number written on it and some lint.

Great.

His first friend in forever and he couldn’t even offer him a tissue!

The bushes then rustled.

Both he and Izuku looked over at the sudden movement.

Small white furry ears popped out from the top of the bush.

Hitoshi couldn’t believe it.

Was it an actual cat this time?

He was truly lucky today, both making a friend and now getting to potentially pet a cat.

The ears disappeared back into the bush, a nose popping out this time.

That nose was a lot pointier than any other cat nose he had seen though, he thought.

“Ah, pardon me,” A huge rat dressed in a suit proceeded to emerge from out of the bushes, “Am I interrupting?”

This was absolutely not a cat.

“Nedzu-san!” Izuku looked happy to see the rat in the suit, so that was good, right? “Is it time to go back already?”

Go back?

Izuku had to go already?!

“I do believe so, Izuku-kun,” The rat—or as Izuku called him, Nedzu—replied, “My research shows that you have gotten an optimal amount of sunlight today already.” Pink paw pads were revealed as he beckoned to Izuku, “Chiyo will be satisfied by this, no doubt.”

“You’re leaving, Izuku?”

Hitoshi felt let down; they hadn’t even done anything together yet!

“Sorry, Hitoshi,” Izuku was already on his feet, brushing stray blades of grass off of the front of his poncho, “We can play next time, okay?”

“At this park then,” He would need to ask his Mom to bring him here more often; there were other parks closer to their apartment, but they were too close to his own school for his liking, “When do you usually come to this park?”

“Uh,” Izuku nervously glanced over at Nedzu, clearly wanting to ask him something, “This is actually my first time coming to this park.”

“Fukukado-kun, if I may speak,” Nedzu turned to face him even as Izuku made his way over to his side, “Izuku-kun will be brought to this location for an hour or two on most Saturdays.”

“I will?”

“If you would like, Izuku-kun.”

“Yes!” Izuku cheered, “I want to!”

“It is decided then,” Nedzu clapped his paws together, then turned to leave, “Come along now, Izuku-kun.” Hitoshi watched as he started to return back to the bushes, “We shall graph your survey results together when we get back.”

“I’m coming!” Izuku called back without moving; he gave him a sheepish look, “I’ll see you next Saturday, okay, Hitoshi?”

“I’ll be right here,” He gestured to the little clearing that they were in, “It’s a promise.”

Hitoshi could feel a smile curl on his lips seeing Izuku nod at his reply.

“Do you want me to bring you a snack next week?” Izuku then asked him, his gaze flicking over to where only Nedzu’s swaying tail was visible now, “There are lots of them in this park.”

Snacks in the park…

Did Izuku mean like wild berries or something?

“It’s okay,” He reassured his new friend, not wanting him to worry about bringing food with him, “I’ll eat before I come.”

“If you’re sure,” Stepping closer to him, Izuku lowered his voice again, this time to something he could barely hear, “And I just want you to know, if your new mom isn’t good to you or says mean things to you, you can tell me, okay?” Izuku’s hands suddenly reached out to hold his own, “I know people that can help.”

Just what sort of people did Izuku know?

“My Mom’s super nice, Izuku,” Hitoshi carefully reversed the position of their hands, his now holding Izuku’s, giving them a small squeeze, “She’s the best mom I could ever ask for.”

Izuku stared at him for a second and then slowly nodded.

“That’s good,” He smiled, a relieved look on his face, “That’s really good.”

Hitoshi knew he wasn’t wrong that Izuku once had bad parents.

He could only hope that the ‘Dad’ person he had mentioned earlier was good and treated Izuku well.

And if he wasn’t… He had someone he could tell as well.

His Mom was a pro hero, after all.

“I'll see you later then!” Izuku waved at him and then turned, one foot already stepping into the bushes, “It was really nice to meet you properly, Hitoshi!”

Properly?

What did that even mean?

Had they met before?

He shrugged, waving until Izuku wasn’t visible anymore, disappearing back where he had come out from.

If there was anything he had picked up on during their time together, it was that Izuku was different from the other kids his age that he knew.

This was probably just a part of that.

Hitoshi was sure he would have realized it if they had met before.

Izuku was a hard person to forget.

After the silence had returned to the clearing, he found himself restless, no longer wanting to nap even after laying back down and closing his eyes.

Perhaps it was time to return to his Mom.

Was she ready to leave yet?

Was her girlfriend done with her business?

Sitting up, Hitoshi ran his fingers through his hair to comb out any bits of grass that might have gotten stuck there. He didn’t need his Mom’s giggles as she removed them for him.

He then stood and made sure there wasn’t any sticking to his clothes as well. After he was absolutely certain that he was as grass-free as he could be, he slowly retraced his steps back to the bench where his Mom had been earlier.

As he got closer to his Mom’s location, he could hear her laughing.

That was normal enough.

His Mom loved laughter, whether it was from bad jokes or from her quirk, she enjoyed it all.

“Ms. Mom, I’m back,” He nodded at Nemuri-san, who had finally returned from whatever she had to do, “Hi, Nemuri-san.”

“Hitoshi!” His Mom greeted him, immediately leaning forward to pluck what had to be the tiniest bit of grass out from his hair; she looked amused, “Did you have fun out there?”

Did he?

 

Well, he did meet Izuku.

“I made a friend.”

Both Nemuri-san and his Mom gasp in unison. His Mom then threw her arms around him loosely, her chin nuzzling the side of his head.

“Oh, I’m so proud of you!” He could feel her nearly vibrating, likely in excitement, “Where are they? Can we meet them?”

“No,” He groaned at her questions; the last thing he needed was his Mom or Nemuri-san weirding Izuku out, “He left already.” Left with Nedzu back into the bushes where they had both come from, “With his dad.”

Nedzu was probably his dad, right?

He seemed to have control over when Izuku would be able to come to the park, so yeah, probably.

“Oh, boo,” His Mom pouted, Nemuri-san patting her arm in consolation, “I wanted to meet your new friend.”

Hitoshi didn’t think that was too great of an idea.

He hadn’t even had his friend for one day yet, so if his Mom scared Izuku away with her loudness and intensity, he would be returned to what he had started the day with.

Zero friends.

Now he had to ask his Mom to bring him back here without her trying to insert herself into his and Izuku’s future playtime.

“I want to become better friends with him before you meet him,” He huffed, ignoring Nemuri-san laughing at his Mom’s wail of complaint, “You might scare him away.”

“Aw, I’m not that bad, am I?” She turned to Nemuri-san, pointing to herself, “I think I’m pretty great!”

“I think you’re great too!” Nemuri-san grinned, propping her hand against her chin, “But you did mention to me that even Hitoshi-chan took a while to get used to you, right?” His Mom nodded to the question, lips pursed again in another pout, “If Hitoshi-chan’s new friend is anything like him, it’ll be the same. Easy does it, Emi.”

“Guess you aren’t wrong, Nemuri,” His Mom conceded, much to his relief, “But I do wanna meet him eventually, okay, Hitoshi?”

He gave her a half-hearted shrug.

It all really depended on how he thought Izuku would react to his Mom.

That required getting to know Izuku better first.

And to do that, they had to continue to meet up and play.

“Actually, I’m supposed to meet him next week on Saturday at this park,” He did his best to keep his tone casual as his Mom stood, stretching her arms up to the sky, doing some quick squats right afterwards, “Can you bring me?”

“Saturday?” She hummed, “Same time?”

‘Uh, yeah, I think so,” Hitoshi was pretty sure at least, “That’s what his dad said.”

“Sure! I don't mind!"

That was good.

He would definitely be able to keep his promise to Izuku like this.

Not that he thought his Mom would refuse, but it was good to have confirmation.

His Mom made too big of a fuss about sunshine and having friends to even think about saying 'no' to going to the park where he could play with said friend.

"Thanks, Ms. Mom."

"No problem, munchkin," She gave his hair a quick ruffle before picking up her bag, signaling that she was ready to go, "Nemuri just invited us over for lunch, so we'll be heading over to her place now."

"That means I can play with Sushi after lunch, right?" He peered up at Nemuri-san, unable to contain his eagerness, "Please?"

"If Sushi wants to play, then you can play with him, Hitoshi-chan."

He let out a small whoop at her words.

This was the best day ever!

Not only did he get to meet and befriend Izuku, but he was also going to get to pet a cat!

"Oh, Hitoshi-chan, you're so cute!" Nemuri-san cooed as she led them in the direction of the train station, "You know, I've actually got these friends with a kid your age too!”

Another kid his age?

Hitoshi wasn’t quite sure how he felt about that.

He knew that Nemuri-san was hinting at wanting him to meet her friend’s kid, but the chances of this new kid also being accepting of his quirk couldn’t be high.

Meeting Izuku had been lucky in that regard.

“What do you think about meeting the kid?”

Nemuri-san asked him as they got onto the train and picked out their seats.

He sat next to his Mom, taking the seat away from Nemuri-san who he knew would have wanted to sit there. However, he also knew that if they sat right next to each other, they would act all gooey and sweet and giggly the entire time.

And because he would be forced to sit across from them in that specific case, he’d have to watch all of this.

That was not what he wanted for his train rides, thanks.

By the time he had settled into his seat, he realized he hadn’t given Nemuri-san a reply.

“I dunno,” He admitted with a shrug, “What if he’s mean?”

“You don’t have to meet this kid if you don’t wanna,” His Mom reassured him, “I know all this is probably overwhelming for you already.”

He shot her a grateful look, because yes, this was a lot for him.

(His Mom did know about his history with making friends and though she always encouraged him to put his best foot forward, it didn’t work out like that most of the time.)

Nemuri-san seemed to understand that he had no interest in meeting another new person, not mentioning anything else about this other kid that she wanted him to meet, instead switching the subject to what she was going to make for them for lunch and some new toys that she had gotten for Sushi.

(The story behind the new toys was pretty funny. Apparently Nemuri-san and one of her friends had thought that some of their other friends had taken in a cat and it had backfired on them spectacularly, resulting in them getting scolded for their assumptions. Adults were so silly sometimes. How was that even possible?)

His Mom had snorted, slamming a hand against her mouth to muffle her laughter, nearly kicking Nemuri-san in the shins.

Nemuri-san only looked proud that she had been his Mom’s cause of laughter.

He closed his eyes once his Mom was reduced to only giggles, knowing he could sleep with this volume of noise; hoping to catch a nap so he’d be in full form to play with Sushi later, he could feel himself easily drift off with the slight vibration the train produced as it moved.

Hitoshi couldn’t wait to see Izuku again.

Next week was only seven days away.

Soon.

    Hitoshi wasn’t expecting his day to go this way, but it definitely his exceeded expectations!

    Izuku does remember Hitoshi from back then, which is why he got invested so quickly. He just wants to know Hitoshi is okay now and is even prepared to get the attention of the hat-man if needed ;v;

    Some arbitrary information: Nedzu and Izuku held hands/paws crossing the street to this park. (Nedzu read this on the internet). Also the ‘Kat Loaf’ mascot on Hitoshi's shirt is named 'Bread'.

Chapter Text

Izuku liked going to school.

Not only was U.A. an amazing school filled with pro heroes, but getting to learn from Nedzu-san was fun and interesting.

He had spent a lot of the summer getting dropped off at U.A. in the mornings and getting picked up in the afternoons. His Dad had called it a ‘test run’, wanting him to be absolutely certain that this was what he wanted instead of trying to go to a normal school like how Tenya was doing.

Waking up in the morning was still not his favorite thing, but knowing he'd get to see Nedzu-san later made it a bit better.

On the very first day, both his Dad and Papa had taken him to school. He remembered that he had been equally excited and nervous about the entire thing. Sure, he was looking forward to going to U.A. again, but school meant that he’d be away from both his Dad and his Papa for hours!

Izuku didn’t like the sound of that, especially since he knew that Hisashi was still out there.

However, he had been reassured multiple times that they would do their best to stay as safe as possible. In return, his dads also had Nedzu-san promise to them to always keep an eye on him, and if he wasn't available for any reason, to have a trusted member of U.A. faculty watch over him instead.

The feeling that fell upon him seeing them leave made his stomach turn. He had nearly cried, wanting to call them back, to ask them to stay with him for just a little longer.

"You will be safe with me, Izuku-kun," Nedzu-san had told him, the back of his paw nudging his hand, bringing him back from sinking too deep into his thoughts, "You do not need to worry." He had paused, eyes intent on dots that were his dads disappearing past the U.A. entrance gate, "And your parents are capable graduates of U.A.'s heroics course. They will be fine as well."

"I know," He had replied, unable to stop the small whine that accompanied his words, "But he's still out there…"

Still out there and potentially doing more horrible things to other people.

His Dad had told him what information he knew about 'Firebird', (what he had learned from the hat-man anyways), and Izuku only felt awful hearing it all, knowing that despite having his Dad and Papa now, he was still related to that man.

(What made it worse was that within him, he still carried that mutation brought down to him from all the fire quirks that had come from Hisashi’s side of the family. And he loved his warmth, even though it was taking its time in coming back to him.)

"I understand that you are feeling unnerved about the current situation, and while there is not much that can be done in the meantime," Nedzu-san had patted his hand, his silky fur soft against his skin, "We can still prepare by improving ourselves now, ensuring we are all at our best, and that future plans that will be laid have the highest chance of success."

In the end, there wasn't much he could do but agree with Nedzu-san’s words and just do his best in school so that his Dad and Papa wouldn't worry about him too much.

When it came to go home, lessons done for the day, his Dad would wait by the school's security gate for him. Only rarely did his Papa show up, usually busy with some sort of work at the radio station.

For the most part, Nedzu-san was the one to take the time to walk him all the way to the gate, but sometimes, he had very important meetings to attend, so he'd ask Ectoplasm to do it instead, calling him to his office on the school announcement system.

(He liked Ectoplasm a lot; his teeth were cool and he never had to ever worry about breaking the bones of his legs 'cause he had pro-sthe-tics instead! And he had finally learned about his quirk, Clones. Ectoplasm could make a whole bunch of himself just by spitting them out of his mouth; it was so awesome to watch! Izuku thought he could probably go without all the quizzing on his adding and subtracting though.)

It was even rarer that both Nedzu-san and Ectoplasm were busy; something like that had only happened once in the entire month of August!

During that time, Nedzu-san had asked another of the pro heroes that worked at U.A. to escort him to his Dad.

(Specifically, he had asked Snipe to because he had come over to his office at that exact time to drop off some paperwork and had some free time afterwards.)

Snipe wasn't a pro hero he was very familiar with, but he knew not every hero enjoyed attention and did their best to stay away from things like the media. His Dad, especially didn't like that, making his grouchiest faces if they even came near him.

Though he had been nervous about walking with Snipe to the security gate, warily eyeing his holstered guns, Izuku found that he was actually really really cool.

(When he had first seen those guns, he had been suddenly swept back in memories of that night, drowning in the sound of the gun that had nearly shot him out of the sky, that had nearly hurt his Dad. It had only been a moment, but it left him shaken when he finally realized that night was over, that right now, he was in U.A., in Nedzu-san’s office, fingers slowly stroking the fur on the back of Nedzu-san’s paws.)

Nedzu-san had quietly asked him if he would prefer a different escort, asked him if there was anything he could help with, but Izuku had refused it all, just wanting to see his Dad again as soon as possible.

Snipe had looked concerned, even offering to leave his guns behind for the minutes it took to escort him to the gate.

It was very nice of him to offer, even though Izuku had told him that he didn't need to. He would need his guns if he happened to need to protect him with all his might at Nedzu-san’s request.

By the time they had reached the security gate, Izuku had learned a bit more about Snipe, his quirk, and what he taught at U.A.

(It had taken longer than usual for him to meet up with his Dad that afternoon.)

(Izuku was so glad that Snipe had chosen to be a pro hero.)

However, today was just an ordinary day.

Nedzu-san walked him to the gate, greeting his Dad who was leaning against the trunk of a nearby tree before waving to him. He, of course, waved goodbye back. His Dad merely nodded, but Nedzu-san looked just as pleased with that as well.

"I shall see you next Wednesday, Izuku-kun," Nedzu-san called as they started the walk back, "Please enjoy your weekend!"

"You too, Nedzu-san!" He turned to respond, even as he and his Dad continued walking; this would be so much easier if he had his owl neck right now, "Bye!"

Izuku was excited for the weekend. It wasn't as if he had anything planned, but weekends meant getting to sleep in a bit more and that was always a good thing in his books.

Right now, he only had lessons from Wednesday to Saturday, a change from the summer where he had them on Tuesday as well. His schedule was created between Nedzu-san’s general availability and his own possible workload.

(Honestly, Izuku didn't think it was too bad, but it wasn't as if he had a lot of experience in how many things you were supposed to learn in school nor the amount of homework you were supposed to get. But he did ask Tenya about it once and he was pretty sure that what he was learning from Nedzu-san was different from what Tenya's Miyamoto-sensei taught. Odd, but not surprising, as his Papa would say. After all, it was only logical that Nedzu-san would teach different things since he was in charge of a hero school like U.A.)

"Did you learn anything fun today?"

This was a question that his Dad always asked him as they traveled home. Funnily enough, his Papa did the exact same thing during dinnertime.

It was nice that they were interested in learning about what he learned in school, but didn't they already go to and finish school already? He was probably learning the same sort of things they did since they had attended U.A. as well.

Still, it made him more than happy to elaborate on what he had learned that day, finding it easy to speak to his parents. They rarely interrupted him, and if they did, it was because they wanted to ask him to cla-ri-fy something very important.

(Izuku still remembered that specific night very well. How could he not when his Dad had frozen with an intense look on his face, his chopsticks still hovering over his bowl of udon. His Papa had the opposite reaction, nearly toppling his bowl over in his haste to place it back down so he didn’t pour the broth down his shirt. It didn’t take a lot of thinking to realize that his parents really didn’t like that Nedzu-san had allowed him to use his wrecking ball. The very next day, his Dad came up with him to the school and had a serious talk with Nedzu-san about the whole wrecking ball thing, and well, suffice to say, now he no longer had permission to use it anymore until he was older. A lot older.)

“Nedzu-san taught me about the life cycle of a butterfly today,” He specifically chose this to tell his Dad instead, knowing his Papa didn’t like bugs, not even the pretty ones like butterflies, “They do something called me-ta-mor-pho-sis and caterpillars turn into butterflies after a long nap in a cocoon!”

“A long nap, huh?” His Dad hummed, “That does sound nice.”

Did his Dad not learn about butterflies in school?

He would take this chance to teach his Dad more about butterflies then.

“They can taste with their feet!” His Dad looked impressed, nodding for him to continue, “And they have a pro-bos-cis! They use that to suck things up cause that’s how they eat.”

Idly, Izuku wondered how butterflies would taste. They were so nice to look at that he had never attempted to try one out, choosing to go after something a bit more substantial when it came to meals.

“Did you see your park friend today?”

Ah.

His Dad was talking about Hitoshi now.

“Mhm,” He nodded happily, “I did!”

“And did Nedzu bring you to the park?”

“Nedzu-san’s the only one who does that, Dad.”

“Did he hide in the bushes again?”

“Yeah! Nedzu-san says it’s the best location to keep an eye on us!”

A dash of amusement flitted across his Dad’s face.

“I’m sure he does.”

Izuku loved the days where he got to meet up again with Hitoshi.

Seeing and recognizing Hitoshi that day was something he considered very lucky to have happened to him.

It was something he would think about sometimes when he still lived out there alone. The people that he led Eraserhead to, were they finally safe?

He never really followed Eraserhead after activating his tracker, usually switching it off afterwards and taking off in the opposite direction, uneasy about being possibly seen by too many people.

Using the tracker eventually became second nature to him, even if he had to stand on one leg to be able to tap at the button that would share his location.

Meeting Hitoshi had been the event that had spurred him to use it so often later on.

He had just looked so sad sitting there, tears falling down his face, dripping into whatever it was covering his mouth. Izuku had never seen one of those before, but he knew it wasn’t a good thing. It looked like it hurt.

Even back then, Izuku had known the streets were dangerous for kids that weren’t owls like him. Most kids didn’t even have wings like him so they could fly away if they needed to.

So he had decided to call Eraserhead to this location.

However, the movements he must have made while trying to find the best way to tap the button on the tracker caught tired eyes.

Soon though, Eraserhead had appeared, looking like he was in a hurry, alert eyes darting up and around catching sight of the mildly surprised kid before looking up.

He had given him a chirp when their eyes had finally met and then jumped, wings catching a nearby breeze and gliding his way back into the sky, satisfied that he had done all he could there.

Izuku had thought about it a few times. He was sure his Dad wouldn’t have minded answering him if he remembered what had happened to those people he had tried to help at that time, but it scared him. Just the knowledge that he possibly might have been useless to them made him feel bad enough that he decided to push that idea away, not wanting to dwell any longer on it.

And then he met Hitoshi again.

Hitoshi looked happy.

Hitoshi was no longer crying.

That’s good, he found himself thinking, I’m glad.

He didn’t think Hitoshi would recognize him, but he found himself approaching despite that.

To his delight, it all worked out and he left that meeting with Nedzu-san knowing he now had yet another friend.

“When are you planning on letting me and Hizashi meet your park friend, Izuku?” His Dad tugged him a bit closer as they crossed a street together, “It’s not logical that Nedzu’s been the only one to get to meet him in any capacity.”

“You can’t yet,” Izuku shook his head, “He doesn’t really like other people and you’re other people still.”

Plus, there was a big chance that Hitoshi would recognize his Dad as Eraserhead.

He had to swear Hitoshi to secrecy first before all of that.

Shouta was intrigued by Izuku’s words.

Just what was he trying to hide from him?

Ordinarily, he would have felt slightly miffed that Izuku referred to him that way, but he liked to think he knew Izuku. That he knew that Izuku didn’t mean it in such a way that it might initially come off as.

“I’m ‘other people’?” He kept his voice light, “Can’t I be introduced to him as ‘Izuku’s Dad’?”

“Daaad,” Izuku’s took on an embarrassed tone as a small whine left his throat, “I’m being serious!”

And oh did he know that.

It was rare enough that Izuku wasn’t serious whenever he was talking, Hizashi’s lighthearted banter and jokes flying straight over his head at times.

“I know,” He said, acknowledging whatever Izuku was trying to hide from him about the park would end up going on for just a bit longer, “But I really do want to meet him eventually, you know.”

This park friend of Izuku’s was so important that Izuku had announced it as they were having dinner one Saturday night.

“I made a friend today.”

If he were the crying sort, he would have joined Hizashi in ugly sobbing at the table, his chopsticks nearly getting flung across the kitchen in his proud excitement.

This was big news.

With Izuku’s previous history of friends, with that Kacchan of his, he had every right to be suspicious of the friends Izuku made that hadn’t been a kid or sibling of a close friend.

The last thing Izuku needed was another ‘friend’ like Kacchan.

It did hurt though, knowing that Izuku was purposely keeping this information to himself but let Nedzu do all the snooping he wanted while hiding in nearby bushes as he kept an eye out for them.

He knew he could probably ask Nedzu if he really needed to know, but he had worked long and hard for the trust that Izuku had in him. There was no way he was going to risk damaging or even losing that.

“You will,” After a measure of silence, Izuku finally replied, “I’m working on it.”

What did that even mean?

But this was likely as good as it was going to get if he didn’t want to encroach too much into the hub that was Izuku’s bustling social life.

It wasn’t as if he didn’t know a fair bit about Izuku’s friend, not that any of this information was helpful information to help him determine if this kid was a future Kacchan in the making.

(After all, Izuku had told him that his friend had told that he liked to eat wet cat food. Just what sort of person was this kid? Did he have some sort of feline-related quirk that enabled him to gain nutrients from cat food? But most importantly, what did it taste like?)

“Is that a promise?”

“Mhm,” Izuku both tapped the reply to the back of his hand and replied verbally, “Yeah.”

Shouta would just have to trust Izuku’s judgment on this.

Because if there was something off about Izuku’s park friend, surely Nedzu would have stepped in, right?

 

Right?

He actually wasn’t too sure he would.

Nedzu was undoubtedly one of the most intelligent creatures on this planet, but with more time spent in his presence, it only got more obvious that Nedzu was not very experienced with interacting with children that were Izuku’s age, having to do some impromptu research quite a few times or ask Recovery Girl for tips.

An odd creature, the principal of U.A. was.

Izuku still adored him though and Shouta could see that Nedzu reciprocated the same feelings, always going out of his way to order fancy snacks from Hokkaido for their snack times together.

“Dad?”

“Yes?”

“Do you wanna learn more about butterflies?”

There was more?

“Sure.”

He had only started asking about Izuku’s day and what he learned after some prodding from Hizashi, but he found that he enjoyed what Izuku chose to share with him on any given day.

Nedzu’s brand of education was eclectic and unconventional, but as long as Izuku enjoyed himself and was able to complete the curriculum for his grade, it was fine.

Slowly, the two of them made their way home, Izuku still rambling, though he had changed subjects a few times, going from butterflies to moths to millipedes. It was good that he was getting this all out before Hizashi got the chance to ask him about what he had learned today. Hizashi absolutely did not need to know that Nedzu had allowed Izuku to hold bugs in his hands today.

(Thankfully, he heard nothing about any of those bugs getting eaten as snacks.)

“And guess what I found out the other day!” Izuku chirped at him as they finally reached their building, stepping in once he held the door open for him to go through, “It’s about Snipe!”

“Does he name his guns?”

“Um, maybe?” Izuku tilted his head at his guess, “But that’s not it.”

“He has a face underneath his mask?”

“Uh, I dunno,” This time, Izuku looked conflicted, “I’ve never seen him take it off.”

“That’s all my guesses, Izuku,” He fished his keys out of his pocket, unlocking the door for the two of them, “What did you find out?”

“Snipe ate squirrels when he was living in America!”

What.

“He says he’ll catch one and cook it for me to eat!”

What.

“Do you think he’d like it if I caught him a snack too?”

He needed to talk to Snipe.

As soon as possible.



Notes:

    Hizashi > So! Whatcha learn today at school, 'Zuku?
    Izuku >
    Izuku > There's a millipede that lives in Australia that has more than one thousand legs!
    Izuku >
    Hizashi > Nope (((φ(◎ロ◎;;)φ)))

    Izuku is overflowing with miscellaneous information and with Nedzu as his teacher, he's compelled to share all he knows!

    Also some trauma, rip Snipe's first impression.

    Hitoshi has no idea he's such an interesting subject matter in Izuku's family conversation xD And yes, he still does think Nedzu is Izuku's dad. They both have 'Zu' as a syllable! It makes sense!

    Please let me know your thoughts! :D And thank you so much for all the comments! <33 I love reading them!

Chapter Text

Every morning, Shouta got up and got to work.

Hizashi usually had an early start and the best way to start a day off correctly was with a good nutritional breakfast.

He did enjoy cooking, so he never minded losing a bit of sleep in order to do this every morning. It was muscle memory at this point, handling his kitchen knives and chopping ingredients to be put in the miso soup already starting to simmer on the stove.

Besides, Shouta knew he could just nap off any lingering tiredness later in the afternoon when things got a bit more quiet.

With Izuku having started school again in the summer though, that meant things got busier than ever for all of them. It didn't take them long to adjust their schedules (mainly his) to Izuku's, but it made for a hectic first few days when they were still figuring things out.

Additionally, U.A. was far enough from their apartment for them to feel uncomfortable to allow Izuku to go to and come back from school on his own.

(Izuku didn't even make a single protesting peep when they had told him that he was going to be brought to and from U.A. by at least one of them every day that he had scheduled lessons with Nedzu. A bit odd when Izuku was usually almost determinedly independent, but with the knowledge that Midoriya Hisashi was still active fresh in his mind, Shouta couldn't blame him.)

It became a routine for them.

Hizashi would wake up first and start getting ready for his day. The absence of Hizashi's body from their bed would bring him out of his own sleep, and he'd take the chance to just relax in this moment before finally pulling himself out of bed to put together breakfast for the three of them.

Because Hizashi tended to take the longest time to get ready, Shouta usually went ahead and got Izuku up and ready for the day as well. Izuku really did enjoy his sleep though, usually mumbling in protest when he drew the curtains, allowing the sunshine into his room.

It was lucky for them that eurasian eagle owls tended to be crepuscular, being most active during dawn and dusk rather than just being nocturnal like the majority of other owls. Shouta had a feeling that switching Izuku over from a purely nocturnal lifestyle would have been much more difficult.

Izuku was usually the first one at the table, eyes still blurred with sleep. If he hadn't already set breakfast out, Izuku would take the opportunity to put his head down, resting it against his crossed arms. He had fallen asleep like that quite a few times; Hizashi had photographic evidence for it despite Izuku insisting that he was just resting his eyes for a second.

This particular morning, Hizashi had some extra time before needing to be at the radio station, so he had taken the chance to bring Izuku to school first.

(Originally, Hizashi hadn't even had a shift that morning, but he had ended up deciding to go in anyway to oversee the moving in of the equipment he had been so eagerly anticipating.)

Needless to say, Izuku had been ecstatic seeing Hizashi waiting at the door for him, backpack already loosely slung over his shoulder.

"Izuku," He called, peering out from where he was in the kitchen, "I'll be bringing you lunch later today." Izuku blinked back at him, eyes still slightly blank with drowsiness, "Just let Nedzu know so he doesn't lock me out accidentally."

Izuku gave him a thumbs up, hiding a small yawn with his other hand.

Shouta gave him one in return, ignoring the wiggling of Hizashi's eyebrows at the uncharacteristic gesture.

"Well, we're off! Don't wanna be late!" Hizashi opened the door, hand ushering Izuku out, "Love you, Shou!"

"Love you, Dad." Izuku's voice was much more on the low side but no less genuine, "Also, can you make something I can share with Nedzu-san please?"

"Stay safe. I'll see you two later," Already running through his repertoire of recipes that included cheese, he gave them an absentminded nod as he returned back to the kitchen, "And I'll try, Izuku, but no promises."

As soon as he heard the lock click close, he resisted the urge to bury his face into his hands.

Cooking for Nedzu?

What on earth had possessed him to even give that request the time of day?

 

Actually, he knew full well why Izuku had asked this of him.

Izuku usually had his lunch inside Nedzu's office, preferring to avoid the hustle and bustle the cafeteria usually was around that time of day. It was rare that Izuku even left the general area where faculty members tended to congregate, especially that he knew that school had started up again for everyone else.

This meant that Izuku had seen Nedzu eating before.

To put it bluntly, Nedzu generally ate like he expected there to be no food tomorrow or even later in the day, chowing down ferociously with no regard to anyone else nearby. He had even been growled at once, the rumbling coming out from Nedzu shocking him with how deep it was for someone so small.

(Honestly, that time with the macarons had been so weird to even sit through. Witnessing Nedzu nibbling at a macaron, taking what could even be called delicate bites had him wondering if he was having a very realistic but absolutely absurd dream.)

With Nedzu's unspoken past, it was easy enough to infer that food was a touchy subject for him. That just made it more touching that he treated Izuku so often.

Izuku had likely felt the need to reciprocate Nedzu's kindness, to give him food in return.

A logical thing to do.

He could get behind that.

As he washed and dried the rest of the dishes, placing them back where they belonged, he thought about what he wanted to make for lunch.

He had originally wanted to put some tempura together for Izuku, complete with a complementary dipping sauce. They had a few frozen shrimp left from their fried rice dinner a couple of nights ago and a decent variety of vegetables stocked up in the refrigerator as well.

But with what he wanted to make, it just felt redundant with all the fried food.

Shouta let out a sigh, deciding to get some cleaning done instead. He’d be able to think of this a bit longer as he dusted and swept his way through the apartment.

Izuku had left his door open before he had left, knowing that they cleaned on Wednesdays.

Early on, they had discussed how comfortable Izuku was with them entering his room. It was supposed to be a safe space for him, a place he knew he could always retreat to if anything was getting to be a bit too much for him. Or even just a place where he could go if he wanted some alone time.

They had come up with the system they still followed to this day.

A door left open meant that they were free to come in, even if Izuku himself wasn’t in the room.

If the door was closed, then only Izuku was allowed inside.

(Though, entrance might be allowed if Izuku was already inside and gave them permission to come in after they knocked at his door.)

As he dusted the shelf, his eye caught sight of the framed photograph that had once sat on the cabinet by their door. He paused to pick it up, a fond smile curling up on his lips as he took it in.

Things really did feel much more simpler back then, back when all they knew was that Mimizuku, Izuku, was just an extraordinarily intelligent owl with a fondness for the two of them and a penchant for nibbling through the tassels of the throw pillows that Hizashi liked buying so many of.

They didn’t have to worry about things like school or socialization, only the next night Mimizuku would show up at their balcony, where he would inevitably bless their evening with his low uhoos and the occasional sound of his talons clacking against the wooden floor when he chased Hizashi down the hallway for being too loud.

But though he held a soft spot for that time, he loved what they had now with Izuku.

Placing the picture frame back onto the shelf, he continued his dusting, chuckling when he saw that Real Mick was turned so that he wasn’t facing outwards.

It didn’t take long for him to finish.

Before he turned to leave, he fixed up Izuku’s bed, unearthing the Nedzu plush that was located under a blanket.

‘Nedzu-san’, as Izuku called it, had a permanent spot in Izuku’s bed nowadays, the soft plush being his companion for whatever he got up to in his room or in the living room.

(Izuku had even taken to asking Hizashi for goodnight kisses, and then asking for one for his plush as well after he had received his own. Of course, Nedzu-san-the-plush had gotten his own forehead kiss. As expected of Hizashi.)

Placing the plush next to the pillow, he gave it a small pat on it’s head before leaving.

It really was very soft.

He couldn’t help it.

Shouta did his and Hizashi’s room next, finally digging out the box of knives that he had kept under their bed. Since he had the time now, he went through the small collection that Izuku had put together as an owl, separating the ones that were rusted or dented apart from the ones that seemed well enough to be used if given the proper care.

He wasn’t a supporter of arming children, but he knew that it was better that Izuku learn responsible knife use and care from him rather than have him attempt it on his own. And he knew that Izuku would take that chance if ever given, the look in his eyes giving him away every single time.

Knives like these wouldn’t be a good start though.

A kitchen knife would be better and it had the dual purpose of allowing Izuku to participate in whatever he was doing in the kitchen.

Honestly, Shouta wasn’t even sure that children were supposed to handle knives, but most of the parenting blogs that he had skimmed through had recommended allowing kids to help out in the kitchen to build up knife handling skills and general interest in cooking.

By the time he finished, he felt a familiar tiredness take hold of him, unable to hold back his yawn.

He needed his nap.

Kicking the box back under their bed, he gathered up the ones that were pretty much hunks of scrap metal, placing them in a smaller box which he would have to take with him later to dispose of safely.

All of that was for later though.

His nap was calling his name.

Izuku was having a fun time at school today.

He had been a bit sleepy on the way there, but by the time he and his Papa had arrived, he was wide awake and ready to see what Nedzu-san wanted to teach him next.

This morning, Ectoplasm, (or one of his clones), had been waiting for him at the gate, ready to es-cort him to Nedzu-san’s office.

Nedzu-san said that once he was on U.A. grounds, responsibility of his safety and welfare fell onto his shoulders, so it was only right that he take appropriate measures in response to this.

Izuku just thought Nedzu-san was incredibly lucky that Ectoplasm worked at U.A. and was nice enough to do something like this almost every day. It really helped that he had a quirk that would allow him to bring him into the school even when he was teaching math to his students at the same time.

After his Papa had left, giving him a big hug and then handing him his backpack, he directed his attention to Ectoplasm.

“Ecto-san,” Izuku hummed as he quickly put on his backpack, hopping up once, twice, to make sure that it was on properly, “Can I ask you something?”

“Go ahead, Izuku-kun,” Ectoplasm responded as he started walking up the path leading to U.A.’s front doors, “You may always ask me questions.”

“Do you know how to do taxes?”

“Yes.”

Ectoplasm’s reply was swift.

It seemed as if all adults knew how to do them; at least all of the adults that he knew, at least.

(Actually, he wasn’t too sure that the hat-man knew how to do them, but that was still a pretty large number of adults that he knew definitely could.)

“Did you go to taxes school to learn how to?”

“I did not.”

“Oh.”

He didn’t?

It made so much more sense that he did though!

Just where did adults learn how to do taxes then!

“Izuku-kun, we’ve arrived.”

He looked up, surprised that they had already walked all the way to Nedzu-san’s office.

“Thanks for taking me, Ecto-san,” He called out as Ectoplasm turned, “I’ll see you later.”

“It is always a pleasure,” Ectoplasm paused, teeth bared in a smile, before finally retreating into the teacher’s lounge, “I look forward to it.”

The door closed, Nedzu-san’s door opening not even a second later.

“Izuku-kun,” Nedzu-san’s chirped, a cup of tea already steaming next to him placed atop a saucer, “Good morning!” He beckoned him in and Izuku eagerly entered, “I trust you had no issue on the way here?”

“Ecto-san would have kicked the issue if there was one,” That’s what he thought would happen if something ever did happen, at least, “Did you have a fun weekend, Nedzu-sensei?"

"It was delightful, yes," Ears perked up at his question, tail swaying slowly behind him; it made for an image of a very pleased Nedzu-san, "Thank you for asking."

Izuku was a bit curious what Nedzu-san did over the weekend, but also knew that if he didn't volunteer the information, it was likely classified. The last thing he wanted to do was get Nedzu-san in any sort of trouble, so he would just have to use his imagination.

(Perhaps Nedzu-san discovered an entire new kind of tea and spent the next few days drinking it and experimenting with what snacks went best with that type of tea? That sounded like something Nedzu-san would really enjoy.)

"I see you did not bring your usual bento today," Nedzu-san mused as he pressed his paw against the sensor pad next to one of his bookshelves, revealing the secret small room that they used for lessons, "Are you planning on going to the cafeteria later to try out Lunch Rush's cooking then?"

Oh right.

"My Dad told me to tell you that he's gonna bring in lunch later today," And hopefully his Dad found something that he could share with his friend; he didn't want to ruin the potential surprise though, so he decided not to mention it until he knew for sure what was in his bento, "So please tell the robots not to beep at him and try to kick him out, okay?"

That was what happened to tres-pas-sers, according to Nedzu-san, if they got past the security gate, at least. And if they didn't leave peacefully, Nedzu-san would get an alert about it and send out whoever was free at the time to check it out.

(Izuku thought the chances were pretty high that it was either Ectoplasm and Snipe that would get sent out. Snipe could shoot anyone or anything he wanted! And Ectoplasm could make so many of himself! Because of that, they both didn't even need to be too close, which meant that they weren't in as much potential danger either.)

Logically, he knew that both Ectoplasm and Snipe knew who his Dad was and wouldn't attack him on sight, but it didn't stop him from feeling sick to his stomach just thinking about Dad possibly getting hurt.

(He didn't want to see his Dad at the end of another gun.)

(Izuku wasn't sure he could help him this time.)

 

(Not yet, at least.)

"I'll let the robots know to expect him later then," Nedzu-san assured him as he took his seat, taking out his notebook and writing utensils out from his backpack, "Come now, let's start today's lessons!"

And start them, they did.

Izuku had learned early on that Nedzu-san's teaching style was nothing like what he had experienced back in daycare, though his memories of those times were only getting fuzzier as more time passed.

Nedzu-san really liked to lecture, asking questions, and then discussing the answers given, no matter if they were correct or not.

'There is always something to learn, even with an incorrect response.'

And he got so many things wrong at the beginning too!

But after a few days of this, he finally realized what Nedzu-san had meant with his words. Due to him now understanding why he had gotten a specific question wrong and knowing what to not do next time, he rarely made the same mistake twice. And he was able to use the base concepts in that for different types of questions as well!

That was pretty cool.

Nedzu-san was so smart.

(And yes, he knew that was the whole point of Nedzu-san's High Spec, but it didn't change that he was so proud that his friend was super smart and definitely knew how to do taxes!)

Today's lessons was about quirks, something he had always loved learning about.

After a very thorough lecture and lots of messy scribbled notes, he was given a worksheet where he had to draw and describe at least one quirk from emitter, transformation, and mutation categories, and then also explain why it belonged to that specific category.

"You may not choose me or either of your parents, Izuku-kun," Nedzu-san gave him a grin, "That would be too simple and you already know more than most about those specific quirks, being so close in proximity to all three."

Izuku pouted, his initial ideas already rejected at the very first opportunity.

"However, you are free to use your own quirk in this," He perked up hearing this, "Show me how much more understanding you've gained over the past month about Owl."

Izuku was glad he could use Owl for the worksheet. He didn't really know of many other transformation quirks except for Tatsuma-san's Dragon and he didn't even know too much about Dragon either.

After a bit of thought, he realized he had the perfect quirks to put on this worksheet.

Tenya's Engine was a mutation quirk and Hitoshi's Brainwashing was an emitter quirk. With the addition of his own Owl, a transformation quirk, the worksheet was pretty much completed just like that!

All he had to do now was actually do it.

So he got to work, pencil immediately sketching out what he looked like as an owl, jumping from that to the engines located in Tenya's calves, and then to Hitoshi, mouth open in the middle of using his quirk.

Drawing didn't take long; he thought he was pretty good at drawing actually. His Dad and Papa always seemed to like his drawings, and he already knew that Nedzu-san did as well.

(The picture he drew of him a couple of months ago had been both laminated and framed, put right next to all the important certificates on the walls in the main office. The photo that his Dad had taken of them sat framed on his desk in this smaller classroom office. It was a bit embarrassing, but this was kinda like putting it up on the refrigerator, right? Or at least the same idea as that, just a bit more fancy.)

A small buzz sounded off by Nedzu-san’s side, the little device vibrating in place before falling silent.

“It appears that there is someone wanting to speak with me,” Nedzu-san hopped off his chair, heading back to where the door was back to his main office, “Do continue your work, Izuku-kun. I shall be back momentarily.”

Izuku nodded, even as Nedzu-san disappeared back behind the bookshelf, always careful to not catch his tail between the gap.

This happened often enough, so he was not worried about who might be on the other side.

He continued to mark down the observations that he had made about the quirks he had decided to focus on for this assignment, choosing to ignore whoever it was speaking to Nedzu-san on the other side of the door.

It was usually easy enough to do, but this voice sounded just familiar enough for him to continually wonder about who it could be even as he wrote down what he remembered about the IIda family’s Engine quirks.

(Iida-san had said they were all the same quirk, just in different places of the body. So whatever he knew about Iida-san’s would work the same for Tenya’s, probably. The exception was the type of juice they used for refueling. Cars were weird.)

He found himself leaning in closer, balancing his elbows on his desk, in an attempt to hear what was being spoken about just next door.

It didn’t help at all.

He held in his huff of frustration, sliding out of his chair instead, moving in closer to where he knew the door to be located. Trying not to lean on it too much, he squinted, trying to see if there was any gap for him to peek through.

Alas, there was not.

Instead, he strained his ears, placing them right against where the door was.

To his surprise, that worked much better, the murmurs clearing up into distinct words.

With the help of that, he knew now why he had recognized that voice.

It was Kayama-san.

Or someone that sounded very much like her.

Izuku didn’t think he was an expert at recognizing voices, but when he had been an owl, he had a lot of time to practice not just recognizing people by their voices and footsteps, but by the way they spoke as well.

His hearing was nowhere as good when he was only a human, but that habit had stuck with him all the same.

This maybe-Kayama-san spoke a lot more confidently than how the usual-Kayama-san did, voice projecting louder like how his Papa did when he was trying to get someone’s attention.

There was also something he didn’t know the word for, but it was something he had heard plenty of back when he explored the streets at night, most commonly by women or men that chatted people up at street corners, getting paid money for things like kisses or touches. Things would happen after the people were brought back into the alleyways too, though Izuku never followed them back there. The sounds were weird enough; he didn’t want to see it.

Izuku didn’t know if he knocked against something, or maybe he leaned in too far somewhere, but the maybe-Kayama-san lowered her voice, the slight hushing quality to it marking it as a whisper and not just something said in a normal voice.

“You seem to have a little spy hiding in your walls, Principal.”

She took a step forward, the sound of a heel hitting the tile of Nedzu-san’s floor obvious to him.

“Playing a game of hide and seek, are we?”

 

Izuku saw red.

Notes:

    Izuku > Nedzu-san is a Nedzu!
    Izuku > Tenya is a car!
    Izuku > And my park friend likes cat food!
    Shouta >
    Hizashi > Did we go wrong somewhere?? (；´д｀)ゞ

    Well! Izuku sure is having A Day, isn't he?

    And yes, that's Midnight chatting with Nedzu in his office; she's here to shadow teachers for some teaching experience! :D Good on you if you guessed that!

    Izuku has a very odd relationship with guns, even though he's pretty fond of Snipe now. That night at the drug bust really hit him where it hurts, you know? He's only a kid still :c

    Please let me know your thoughts! :D And thank you so much for all the comments! <33 I love reading them!

Chapter Text

"Do you want to play a game with Mama?"

His Mama's words rang in his ears, sending him reeling back into old memories.

"I love you."

"Go hide."

Izuku felt his breath hitch, unable to breathe in properly, gasping in his next breath.

He had, hadn't he?

Hiding had been all he did for over a year.

And it was over.

That game was over now.

His Dad had found him, ending it for once and for all.

 

Izuku didn't want to play hide and seek again.

He didn't want to hide again.

Anger burned bright within him, and for a split second Izuku felt that if he had Hisashi’s Dragon's Breath, he'd be spitting out fire with how mad he was.

Now, Izuku had never been too outwardly an angry child. He had always been more of a spontaneous crier, just like his Mama had been, and how his Papa was now.

That didn't mean he never got the other kind of angry though.

At that moment, Izuku couldn't be sure why hearing those words affected him in such a way, but it didn't matter to him. All he wanted right now was for those words to be taken back.

He was not playing hide and seek.

Not now.

Not again.

In an instant, he had pushed his hand against the same door Nedzu-san had just exited from, it opening for him as well.

(This door was keyed to only him and Nedzu-san. Not even his parents could get in this specific way if they wanted to.)

It was instantaneous.

Izuku only felt an inkling of a swooping sensation in his belly and suddenly, he was no longer touching the ground, quickly approaching the possibly-but-not-definitely-Kayama-san.

He had his talons outstretched before he even knew it, thrusting them forward in one swift movement aiming for the top of her head.

Then all he heard was screaming.

Who was screaming?

He didn’t like the screaming.

Narrowly dodging out of the way of a flailing arm, the blur of its motion obvious even to his still sharpening vision, Izuku banked against the wall of the room he was currently in before diving down again.

(There was something suspiciously meal-shaped in the room as well, and he was so so hungry, but even the mere thought of going for this made something inside him scream. It was not a good idea; he just knew it.)

This time, he knew he had struck true, his talons raking right across the arm that had attempted to hit him down just before, blood immediately welling up from the scratches he had caused.

It would be so easy to just hold on and squeeze instead, but this was good enough for him.

He just wanted her out of here; that was it.

What he hadn't expected was the air to go all funny around them.

There was nothing he could smell, but he could see the slight distortion of something being added into the air.

What was happening?

He could see the not-a-snack creature immediately press a paw over their nose.

(Was there something that smelled bad? Something he didn't want to smell?)

(Izuku didn't know. Owls couldn't smell.)

It was overwhelming, the sense of urgency that suddenly crashed onto him.

This wasn't good.

He landed with his wings outstretched, talons gripping the back of the chair that was behind the desk.

Uhoo

How dare she?!

He puffed himself up, ear tufts as erect as he could make them, flapping his wings for emphasis.

She pulled out some sort of whip from her belt, holding it out front of her even as blood dripped down from her arms and onto the ground.

Did she want to fight?

"Do not harm him, Midnight," The creature sounded alarmed, tail whipping out behind him once before it stilled; he looked tired all of a sudden even as he continued to speak, words struggling to leave his mouth, "You… must not… harm him."

(A memory within him whispered ‘Nedzu-san’, giving him a name to the animal that he felt such a need to stand by.)

Nedzu-san then collapsed, paws barely stopping him from hitting the floor face first.

Izuku immediately hopped down from his perch to check on him, quickly turning his head to look at the person that Nedzu-san had called ‘Midnight’ first, making sure she wasn’t making a move while Nedzu-san was down.

He was still a fair bit of distance away from Nedzu-san, but he could already tell that he was only fast asleep on the carpet and not hurt like he originally suspected.

It was better to make sure though.

Once he had gotten close to Nedzu-san though, about to nuzzle him to check if he was hiding any sort of injury, a sudden cracking sound made him jump.

"Sorry, feather duster, but you're not allowed to touch my future boss," Midnight cracked the whip again, the sound harsh to his ears, "Why don't you be a good bird and go for something more suitable to your own size?"

Uhoo

He took up a defensive crouch in front of Nedzu-san and clacked his beak, flaring his wings up behind him.

She was the one that was encroaching here! Midnight was the one that came into their space and accused him of something he never wanted to hear about or to do again!

And now she was being mean to Nedzu-san.

If she came any closer, he would do his best to bite her.

She deserved it.

However, Izuku was wary of her weapon.

It was long and she had good aim with it. How it moved reminded him of how a snake would, all quick movements, lashing out with a likely painful bite.

(Izuku was not afraid of snakes! He had eaten one before, crushing it's head with his foot and then swallowing it down. It sure was wiggly though, trying to escape his grip when there was no possibility of that ever happening; that bit had been a bit less fun, but it had been easy food, and he had been hungry. That was just how an owl lived and survived until the next day.)

He wondered how heavy Nedzu-san was and if he’d be able to carry him away to safety, not wanting him to accidentally get hit. Izuku wasn’t sure he was big enough to be able to protect Nedzu-san from Midnight well enough, but he did have wings and he could fly.

Izuku stepped back slowly, barking out loudly when Midnight took a step forward at the same time. She stopped, though he could see her body tense up, fingers still tight on the handle of her whip.

Just what was she planning?

It turned out that he didn’t need to think too hard about it, her whip suddenly swinging out with a flick of her wrist, wrapping itself tightly around one of his legs. Izuku tried to grab at the back of Nedzu-san’s suit, desperate to at least keep him close to him, but he was wrenched forward harshly, Nedzu-san now much further away from where he was now. His wingbeats kept him in the air, but he was unable to free himself like he wanted to, his captured leg starting to hurt with how it was getting pulled.

He was furious.

This was not going how he had planned.

With yet another smooth movement, Midnight shoved a window open.

Izuku could feel the warm breeze flow in, the feathers of ear tufts swaying softly at the temptation now in front of him.

The sky was out there.

And he was an owl.

He swiveled his head, turning to see Nedzu-san’s ear twitch in his sleep.

 

Izuku would stay.

Nedzu-san couldn’t protect himself right now, so he would stay to do that for him.

Izuku would be Nedzu-san’s hero this time.

After making that decision, he Immediately let himself drop out of the air, talons bared only just barely missing the meat of her shoulder. He let himself catch the breeze still in the room, swerving up so he didn’t crash into the floor. His leg was still caught though, so he was unable to get far enough to get himself in a good position to dive down once more.

How frustrating.

It didn’t matter.

He just had to land one good hit and make her drop that whip.

Before he could properly reorient himself, he was yanked forward once again; Izuku attempted to stop her, flapping his wings and hoping that his strength would be enough to stall the inevitable.

It wasn’t though.

The window was shoved open and with another precise flick of the wrist, Midnight flung him straight out.

The breeze was stronger out there, his wings immediately catching an updraft, allowing him to glide smoothly even though he had been knocked heavily off-balance due to the sudden change in location.

Izuku could hear a window getting slammed shut, his sharp eyes catching one last glimpse of a sleeping Nedzu-san before all he could see of the office was gone.

What sort of odd windows were these?

He made his way back to where he knew where the office was. Izuku still couldn’t see anything, but his hearing was as good as it ever had been. And from what he could get from listening to the one-sided conversation happening inside from Midnight, she didn’t seem like she was planning on harming Nedzu-san.

That was a good thing.

It was one less thing he had to worry about.

However, he was still not happy.

Midnight still had to take those words back.

The problem was that he couldn’t get to her anymore.

And that he was hungry.

Izuku didn’t like flying around during the day, but it was cloudy enough for some decent cover if he needed it.

After doing another half-lap around the school building, he finally swerved away, heading into the forest that U.A. was surrounded by.

There was definitely lots of food living in here.

He could hear them.

A quick snack for now and then back into the sky it was.

Izuku could feel what remnants of anger and frustration melt away from his body, his ears picking up on the acute sounds of critters in the undergrowth, his eyes tracking down every tiny movement in the leaves.

Landing onto a sturdy branch, he winced, a small uhu leaving his beak.

His leg twinged.

Izuku quickly lifted it, balancing himself fully on his other leg before lowering it again gingerly, not wanting to step too hard on it.

Had he gotten hurt from that whip after all?

It had to be.

All that yanking around by his leg must have made him pull something.

That wasn’t good, was it?

Would it influence his hunting?

The only logical way to find out was to try.

 

Not too long later, he had found his answer, his beak already tearing into warm squirrel meat in his grip.

Once he started, he couldn’t stop himself, gorging down on his freshly caught meal until there was nothing left except for the fluffy tail.

There was nothing that satisfied him more than a good meal that he had caught himself. With his stomach now full though, he was feeling the urge to sleep it off.

It was still early in the day too, but this was better wasn’t it?

He would still be an owl when he woke up and then he could do what he had been dreaming of doing for the last couple of months.

Izuku would finally be able to fly again freely in the night sky.

His mind already made up with what he wanted to do, he grabbed the leftover squirrel tail with a foot, lifting off back into the air, determined to find a good temporary roost.

As he glided between trees, he found himself marveling at all he could see and hear again. Every single small rustle of bushes made him tempted to stop and watch to see what could be causing it, but he knew he needed to find a safe place to rest, so everything he wanted to do would have to wait for later.

 

Even so, he felt like he was forgetting something.

Lunch?

But he just had lunch.

 

It was fine.

He was sure that if it was important, he would remember later.

Sleep first.

Think later.

Today was a nice day.

Shouta looked up at the sky before burying his chin back into his capture weapon.

It was decently cloudy with just the barest hints of the sun peeking out.

And with the temperatures finally lowering due to the shift in seasons, it was pretty much his favorite type of weather.

In his hand, he carried Izuku’s bento and a smaller separate one that held the cheesy corn fritters that he had decided to make for the two of them to share.

(Having cook privileges, he had tried one himself and they were pretty great, if he had to be honest, for something he had probably made once before in his life. The corn kernels were sweet and popped when he bit down on them and the cheese he had added to it gave it a nice mouthfeel.)

Coming up to U.A.’s front gate quickly, he walked in without stopping, eyes sweeping across the grounds to see if any of the school’s security bots would come down swooping on him.

He didn’t doubt that Izuku would have told Nedzu about his request, but Izuku’s memory when he was still tired tended not to be the best at times, so paid to be cautious still. It seemed that Izuku had remembered this time though, so he only nodded a greeting at the patrolling security bot that he came across while entering the main building, getting a beep in return.

The path to Nedzu’s office was one he was now more than familiar with. He didn’t even need to give any thought to it, his feet just taking him to where the door to his office was located.

Oddly enough, the door didn’t open automatically for him.

And when he raised his hand to give it a small knock (as was polite), it didn’t open before he could rap his knuckles against the door.

What were those two doing in there?

He was sure Izuku would be hungry by now, wanting to have lunch.

Shouta had done his best to help Izuku keep to a schedule for meals: breakfast, lunch, and dinner would all happen at around the same time every day, give or take a few minutes. It gave Izuku confidence about when meals would be, so he didn’t end up trying to make an entire meal out of crunchy potato sticks.

He knocked once, twice.

Nothing.

He was starting to get irritated now; Nedzu knew full well that Izuku had lunch at this time every day, so what was keeping him?

“The Principal isn’t available at the moment,” A familiar voice, though it was laced with badly hidden panic, came from behind the door of Nedzu’s office, “Please come back again later!”

It took him only a second to identify who was speaking.

What was she even doing here at U.A. anyway?

“Midnight,” He grunted, displeased, “Are you Nedzu-sensei’s secretary now?” Not that it mattered exactly, “Well, tell them that it’s lunch time and they can continue after eating.”

“I, what?” Nemuri sounded surprised to hear him, “Eraser?

The door opened after that, an extremely ruffled Nemuri meeting his gaze.

She looked like a mess.

There were deep scratches littering her arms, blood still oozing out from them, and her hair looked like it had been through a whirlwind with how messy it was.

Had she been in a fight?

This was U.A. though, top-notch security and all.

And Nedzu’s office was the most secure of places on the campus as well.

He needed to know what was happening right now.

Nedzu was easily located, his white fur a stark contrast to the dark rug he was apparently sleeping on.

What was making his heart nearly stop in worry was the blatant absence of Izuku.

He was sure if Izuku was in this room or the next, that he would have revealed himself to him already.

Where was he?

It was all he could do to not tap his foot with all the jittery energy overflowing within him.

He had to stay calm.

What were the facts in this situation?

 

Nedzu was sleeping.

Nemuri was injured.

And Izuku was missing.

 

Shouta was sure that if whatever threat had been in this room hadn’t been neutralized already, there would have been much more of a fuss as he walked down the hallways of the school.

However, nothing had seemed out of the ordinary.

There were a few things he was sure about though.

Firstly, Nedzu took his responsibility as Izuku’s guardian while at school very seriously and it wasn’t like the rat to be sleeping on the job.

Secondly, Izuku had been looking forward to today’s lunch due to his request in the morning, so for him to not be here meant that something had happened to him.

And lastly, Nemuri’s quirk was the likely culprit for Nedzu’s unexpected nap. And for her to use it here meant that there was something or somebody she regarded as a threat big enough that she had allowed Nedzu to be a liability to her Somnambulist.

Shouta had to force the lump in his throat down, knowing it would not leave him until Izuku was safe in either his or Hizashi’s arms once again.

“What happened, Midnight?” He stepped further into the room, the feeling worsening in his stomach at the sight of stray downy feathers on the carpet, “Do not leave anything out.”

Placing the pair of bentos down onto Nedzu's desk, he picked up one of the small feathers and turned to study the pattern of colors there, it only solidifying his theory about some sort of threat that had access to Nedzu’s office.

If Izuku had been forced to use his quirk to go full owl, he must have been under a high amount of stress.

“It was something out of a storybook, I swear, Eraser,” Nemuri started, a wince crossing her face as the material of her hero uniform touched the open wounds on her arms, “There was this huge owl and it wanted to eat the Principal.”

What.

Nemuri must have taken the look on his face as one of disbelief because she elaborated.

“The owl kept trying to nibble him and I even saw it attempt to pick the Principal up,” She continued, “And my quirk didn’t even work either!”

If Shouta was correct, and he was sure he was, then it was indeed Izuku that had fought with Midnight.

For what reason, he couldn’t be too clear of that, but he would reserve his thoughts on that for later once he had his son back with him.

“And where’s the owl now?”

Where was Izuku?

"I threw him out."

She what now.

She what.

"Out where?" He gritted out, determined to keep his voice as level as he could, “Where is the owl, Midnight?”

Nemuri blinked at him as she picked up her cracked mask that he was sure had been a victim to Izuku’s crushing grip. She was lucky that Izuku hadn’t gotten that same grip around her arm or something.

"Out the window," She huffed, "Where else would I throw a bird?"

She.

Out the window.

The words came out before he could stop himself, spilling out and over with outrage.

"You threw my son out the window?!"

Notes:

    Shouta > Today is going to be a nice day.
    Hizashi > Don't jinx it, yeah?
    Shouta >
    Shouta > (´ Д｀)ヾ

    I swear I do love Nemuri, but things sometimes just happen, you know?

    Izuku is once again full owl. He's very excited about it though there are some that are much less than pleased about what had just happened. Which, well, very understandable!

    Poor Nedzu though! He napped through most of it! (His goal was to keep Izuku unharmed and well.. it mostly worked?)

    Please let me know your thoughts! :D As always, thank you so much for all the comments! <33 They keep me going!

    Next chapter comes out March 5th! Izuku has a fun night. Shouta and Hizashi have less of a fun night.

Chapter Text

Hizashi’s phone vibrated.

He flicked his gaze over at it, Shouta’s name appearing on the screen before the call was canceled.

It started vibrating again.

Snatching up his phone, he quickly excused himself from the studio, boots clicking as he race-walked down the short hallway to an unoccupied room. He locked the door behind him after he entered, swiping to accept the call.

“Shouta?”

He kept his voice calm, knowing that whatever had happened for Shouta to use their phone code had to have been important or bad.

The last time Shouta had contacted him this way, he had been struck across the temple so hard that he had gotten a concussion and then slipped off a roof and into a dumpster.

It was early in the afternoon right now though; he didn’t think Shouta would be anywhere near a dumpster or in the position to get hit in the head again.

As a matter of fact, wasn’t he supposed to be at U.A. dropping lunch off for Izuku?

(Man, he wondered what Shouta made for Izuku, and presumably Nedzu as well.)

There was no reply.

He could hear breathing, Shouta’s brand of slow and measured breaths, but no reply.

“Shou?” He asked again, starting to feel a bit more nervous, “Is everything alright?”

This time, he heard Shouta take in a deep breath, voice shaken with an undercurrent of panic.

“Izuku’s missing.”

 

Hizashi’s world stopped.

How was this possible?

How?

How?!

U.A. was supposed to be one of the safest places in the country!

Nedzu had all but promised them that Izuku would be safe under his care; furthermore, Hizashi thought of him as a man of his word.

 

Did that mean Nedzu had been neutralized?

That was the only reasonable option he could think of.

Just what had happened at U.A. today?

 

Shouta's voice was still going, but to Hizashi, it sounded like his world had been dunked underwater.

Did they need to muster up a task force?

Could he be on it?

Izuku was still so young, so small.

How had this even happened with the amount of pro heroes that had to be in the vicinity of which this happened?

"He was thrown out a window-"

Had he unknowingly been mutterring out his questions?

"A window?!"

Hizashi interrupted, only just barely keeping his quirk under his already fraying control, glad that the room he was in was decently soundproofed.

His imagination was going into overdrive at the thought of Izuku's small body smashing through a pane of glass and flying right out a fucking window.

 

Wait.

Where had he fallen?

Nedzu had cameras in most conceivable locations, so why would Izuku be missing and not sitting safe in Recovery Girl's infirmary after something like that?

"Shouta…" Hizashi was taken aback by the apparent tremble in his voice, quickly coughing in an attempt to mask it, "How did this even happen?"

Shouta stayed quiet for a second, no doubt trying to make some executive decisions on how much to spill. And while it was very sweet of him to want to spare his feelings, Hizashi honestly didn't think it could get any worse than this. He needed to know everything that had happened. Every single detail here was important; the most innocuous bit of information might even help them figure out where Izuku could be.

"Sit down for this," Shouta finally sighed, apparently having made up his mind, "It's not exactly pretty."

 

He wasn't sure what he expected after hearing that, but that it had been Nemuri of all people, well, he was glad that he had followed Shouta's suggestion of sitting down first before letting him continue.

Because what the fuck?

“Izuku really did do a number to Nemuri too,” Shouta said, almost musingly, “Guess we should be glad that he never had a mind to turn those talons against people before.”

Talons?

He made an inquiring sound, and Shouta obligingly elaborated.

“He managed to use his quirk earlier, though I can’t tell if it was due to fear or anger,” Shouta lowered his voice, Hizashi having to strain his hearing to even catch the next words said, “She asked him if he was playing hide and seek.”

Ah.

That was quite possibly one of the worst things that she could have said really.

Not that Nemuri knew that she had pretty much been stomping and kicking right into the big red button labeled ‘Izuku’s trauma’.

It had been early on that they had found out about his distaste for that game.

Whenever he had some free time at home, he would ask Izuku what he wanted to do. A majority of the time, Izuku would ask him to read to him. It was rare that Izuku requested anything else from him, but there were times where he would ask for him to play with him instead.

And every time he had asked Izuku what sort of game he wanted to play, the answer was always the same.

“Not hide and seek.”

He had shared this information with Shouta and they had worried about that reply quite a bit, but because Izuku had shown no other reaction other than never wanting to play ‘hide and seek’ ever again, they had dismissed it, keeping it in mind for future playtimes instead.

It seemed that decision came back to bite their asses big time.

Obviously, there was a lot more going on than they could discern in Izuku.

Not that they could really ask him anything about it because he was missing.

And while he did feel bad that Nemuri had gotten hurt due to their own negligence in sharing information, he felt like she did go overboard.

Izuku had clearly been a distressed animal at the time, all fluffing up and defensive posturing, according to what Shouta had told him. She shouldn’t have retaliated. Retreating had been the best option there.

“I saw that he still had his tracker on him,” The tracker! That was a good thing! “And I’ve been keeping an eye on my phone, but nothing so far.”

Alright, so less good.

“Izuku never did like afternoons as an owl,” He pointed out, as light as he could in this situation, “He’s probably found a place to take a nap in until the sun comes down a bit more.”

Or at least he hoped so.

It had been what Izuku had done the last time he had been an owl after a short stint of being human, so there was a track record there.

“I know, I know,” Hizashi wished he could be by Shouta’s side right now; he sounded like he was on the verge of running out to search for Izuku in the forest that surrounded U.A. “I just. Izuku’s out there somewhere, hurting.” His voice went small, “I just want to help him.”

“I want to too, Shou,” And he did, badly, “There’s just no way we’re going to find a sleeping owl in the woods though. Especially one that’s as good at hiding himself as Izuku tends to be.”

“We could try.”

Shouta replied snippily.

“We could,” Hizashi could give him this, “We could and with a bit of luck, we might even find him.” But it wasn’t just Izuku who had been affected this, and no matter how much he wanted to scorn Nemuri for her actions, and believe him, he was incensed at what she had done, “But you need to go talk to Nemuri. Straighten things out and explain why she won’t be allowed near Izuku for a while.”

And maybe he was jumping to conclusions here, but from what he had heard, Nedzu had even told Nemuri, warned her that she was not to hurt the owl. And while Nemuri had been of the thought that Izuku was going to hurt Nedzu, (and didn’t that sound ridiculous when thought about), Shouta had assured him that Izuku had been very protective of Nedzu instead in face of the threat of Nemuri, intent on standing between her and Nedzu himself when he could.

He wasn’t sure if Nemuri knew if that owl she had flung out the window had been Izuku, but he didn’t doubt that if she didn’t know now, she would know real soon.

Hizashi could only imagine how Nedzu must be feeling about this whole situation.

Izuku and Nedzu were good friends too.

And while they knew Izuku did like Tenya and his park friend (whose name they still didn’t know yet) very much, there was something different about the quality of friendship between Izuku and Nedzu.

(Something inside Hizashi ached when he thought too much about it, of what conditions Nedzu must have had to survive back then before he had managed to get out from where he had been to where he was today. And what his life must have been like for Izuku, their little Izuku, to be counted among who Nedzu would openly call a friend.)

Shouta didn’t argue with his words, thankfully.

Hizashi didn’t know if he could take any sort of bickering right now, especially not from Shouta. He understood that Shouta was itching for some sort of action to be taken, being so close to the situation already, but it would just be a waste of manpower as of now.

Izuku wasn’t even a moving target and with him being likely asleep, there was no chance of there being a red dot for them to follow.

And frankly, if Nedzu didn’t even know where he was as of now with all his cameras, then looking for him aimlessly in the forest wouldn’t help their own situation at all.

It was better to do what could be done and wait for the sun to fall.

By then, Izuku would be awake and able to inform them of his location.

He believed Izuku would do this.

After all that had happened with their little family, he could only place his trust in Izuku once again and believe in him.

“Shouta, we’ll find him again,” Hizashi reassured, only knowing that Shouta hadn’t hung up on him due to the sound of low breathing in his ear, “Izuku knows how to survive out there, ya know.” Much to his consternation too; kids shouldn’t have to know this sort of stuff, “Go talk to Nemuri and comfort Nedzu or something.”

“And what will you do?”

He took in a deep breath as he stood once more.

“I’ll go home.”

Home was where the heart was.

And if there was anything Izuku was for him and Shouta, it was this.

“I’ll go home,” He repeated, “And wait for him to come home.”

It was night.

Izuku was delighted to see the shine of the stars in the night sky greet him when he woke.

He knew that the stars were also there during the day, but they were nearly impossible to see due to how bright the sun was. It was a real shame because they were so pretty and more people should get to see them.

The weather was nice as well and he barely took the moment to snag up the squirrel tail next to him before pushing himself out of the hollow of a tree he had taken up residence in earlier.

Immediately taking to the air, Izuku felt a deep sense of satisfaction inside him bloom as caught a breeze and glided up higher into the sky.

What did he want to do?

Izuku wasn’t sure, but for now, just flying was fine.

He was happy like this.

It didn’t take long before he had left the forest behind, the bright lights of the city under him now instead.

Izuku had missed this view.

How long had it been since he had been able to enjoy himself outside like this?

Months?

Whatever length it had been, it had been too long.

As he flew past a familiar building, he wondered if the view had changed any since he had been there last.

There was no better time to check than now, right?

Banking leisurely, he landed carefully on the guardrails, still keeping most of his weight off of the leg that kept twinging when he stood on it too much.

Making sure that he didn’t drop his squirrel tail down into the street, he looked down, eyes taking in everything in his line of sight.

It was still beautiful.

There were differences, sure, but they weren’t bad ones.

Giddiness bubbled in him and he found himself wanting to share this view with someone, anyone.

He turned his head, expecting there to be someone there, but all that met him was silence.

It unnerved him.

Where were his dads?

 

Oh.

Oh no.

Izuku spun, his talons scrabbling to keep him balanced on the metal of the railing, forcing him to hop onto the building proper, a small squawk leaving him when his hurt leg was jarred.

He had forgotten about his dads!

He had forgotten about lunch.

It was night now, so definitely not lunchtime anymore.

What should he do?

Where should he go?

Would they be mad with him?

Was Nedzu-san really alright?

So many questions and Izuku had no idea how to answer any of them.

All he wanted right now was to see his dads.

Surely it had to be dinnertime and someone was always home for dinnertime. It was usually his Dad, but when Papa could get back home for dinner, he would do his best to do so as well.

So his objective should be heading home as soon as possible.

His Dad had his patrol only an hour or two after dinner so he had to make it back before then.

Izuku was very thankful that flying didn’t really involve his legs, because if he had to walk home, he was sure it would be much more annoying with how much it could hurt if he stepped funny on it.

Once he was sure his squirrel tail was back in his possession, he took off once more, this time making directly for where he knew they lived.

He must have underestimated the distance though, because even after what felt like a long time, he still hadn’t arrived. Izuku knew he was going in the correct direction, but there was still a bit to go.

That didn’t stop him though.

It only made him more determined to get back home.

After what felt another length of forever he could see the tree that stood across the street of their apartment building.

He landed in it’s branches, making sure he was hidden in the motley of oranges and yellows of the leaves.

The balcony was an option for him to enter by, but with how his leg had hurt when he had landed on the hard cement of the building earlier, he didn’t exactly want to do that again, even if it would bring him home.

Izuku would just have to enter through the front door.

He didn’t have the keys to either the main apartment building or to their apartment but Izuku knew that many people lived in their apartment, so all he had to do was wait until one of them came home and unlocked the door. And then he could go in with them! It was a perfect plan if you asked him.

And just as he expected, someone came up to the apartment, digging out the keys from the pocket, unlocking the door.

Uhoo

Izuku called out for him to wait.

The man only turned to look over in his direction, a look of fear crossing his face before quickly slamming the door closed behind him.

Well.

That was rude of him.

Izuku hooted again, disgruntled.

He would just need to wait for the next person.

 

Three more people later and Izuku had to admit his plan wasn’t not working like he had hoped.

No one seemed to want to open and hold the door open for owls!

If no one would do it for an owl, then he would need to be a human for this probably.

And he needed to be human as quickly as he could manage.

If he took too long, then there would be no more people coming home after work or school and no one would be there to open the door for him.

But he didn’t even know how to turn into an owl usually, so asking him to do the complete opposite was even harder.

What was it that Tatsuma-san had told him?

Fingers and toes?

The problem was that he already had toes, even though they were his owl toes.

Why was this so hard?

All he wanted was to see his Dad and Papa soon and hug them and say sorry that he had forgotten about lunch and school.

(Nedzu-san must be so mad with him, missing school like that.)

A clicking sound brought him out of his thoughts.

Another person!

He jumped out of the branches, wings spread out to soften his landing.

“Wait!” He yelled, ”Wait!

The man turned; Izuku could see the surprise in his eyes. The world was still extremely clear to him even though it was only getting darker every minute that passed.

Izuku ran though, ignoring the heavy weight on his back, leaning forward so that it didn’t make him fall backwards.

“Wait for me!” He called out again as he ran across the street after quickly making sure there were no cars coming, “I need to go home!”

The man now had a look of concern in his eyes, and while Izuku could see that, he didn’t really care. What mattered was that he still had the door open.

It was tiring running that distance with how heavy everything seemed to be compared to the usual, but he got there.

He got there.

And the door was still open.

“I also live here,” He blurted out as soon as he reached the open door and the man there, “Thank you.”

He squeezed his way in, and immediately headed for the stairs.

Izuku didn’t like the stairs, but they were the quickest way up for him.

(Especially since it seemed that the elevator was on the top floor right now too and he didn’t want to wait to see his Dad or Papa.)

Up and up he went.

He nearly stumbled a few times, leg not hurting as bad as it had been when he was an owl just before, but enough to make him not want to stomp too hard on it.

By the time he had reached their floor, he was completely out of breath.

He was so close though.

Making his way to their door, he knocked on it.

“Shou?”

That was his Papa.

“That you?”

Izuku wanted to reply, but he was so out of breath still, so he only knocked at the door again harder.

“Coming!”

He could hear the lock’s mechanisms undo and the door open, green eyes looking directly above him, confused.

Izuku lunged forward, arms going around his Papa’s waist.

“Izuku?!”

He could hear his Papa exclaim, arms immediately going around him as well, his voice going all fuzzy.

“I’m home, Papa,” He croaked out, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”

His Papa was shaking, he could feel it from where he was sandwiched between his Papa’s arms around him.

He must be so upset.

That he had been gone for so long?

That he had probably made his Dad sad for skipping lunch?

That he had missed half of school today?

It could be any of those really.

The squirrel tail was still in his hand, so he offered it up to his Papa in an attempt to stop the tears he knew he had caused.

“I brought you back a present.”

His Papa cried harder.

“Do you like it?”

“I love it, ‘Zuku,” His Papa whispered into his hair, “I’m so glad you’re back.”

Izuku relaxed in his Papa’s arms, glad to be back.

“Welcome home.”


Notes:

    Nedzu > We simply have to look at the footage to see what occurred!
    Shouta > Right
    Nedzu > Oh.
    Nedzu > Oh dear.
    Nedzu > There is something in my eye ʕ •̥̥̥ ᴥ•ʔ

    It took him a bit, but Izuku's finally back home, all on his own too!

    Izuku's current state is his half transformation. Injuries from both his owl and human state come together here and get averaged out, which is the only reason he managed to get his way up the stairs.

    Nemuri is alright! Though Recovery Girl wasn't happy hearing about how she had gotten those injuries either. Things are rough when the entirety of the school's faculty has a soft spot for Izuku oops, but she'll be alright.

    Please let me know your thoughts! :D As always, thank you so much for all the comments! <33 They keep me going!

    Next chapter comes out March 12th! Shouta comes home and they have a discussion over dinner!

Chapter Text

His Papa was warm.

The arms around him were still shaking slightly, but they held him tight regardless of that, and that made him feel warmer still.

(Plus, his Papa couldn’t be that mad at him if he still held him like this.)

But most of all, Izuku was happy to hear his Papa’s heartbeat again, barely needing to focus to hear the still familiar thump-thump that could so easily lull him into sleep.

“Oh, Izuku,” He could hear his Papa murmur, voice still fuzzy with tears, “How did you even get in?"

"I waited for someone to open the door," His Papa plucked him up into his arms as he replied, carefully balancing his entire weight with one arm while closing and locking the door with the other, "It took a long time 'cause people didn't wanna let me come in when I was an owl."

"So that's what happened, huh?"

Izuku nodded to the question, nearly tipping over backwards, the weight on his back making it difficult to stay straight. He quickly hooked an arm over and around his Papa's shoulders, turning to finally see why he was suddenly feeling so off-balanced.

(Logically, he knew that this had only started a few minutes ago, but he had been so concerned with getting back home and seeing his dads that he had pushed those thoughts aside for later.)

A familiar array of tawny browns and tans meet his eyes.

He gasped, his grip on his Papa loosening enough so that he nearly tipped backwards again. Thankfully his Papa caught him in time, his hand bracing him on his back between the wings that were there.

"No more falling for today, alright, Izuku?" His Papa sounded so tired as he said that. Izuku made sure to tighten his grip as much as he dared to so that he wouldn't topple over again, not wanting to potentially make his Papa even more exhausted, "Your Papa doesn't know how much more his poor heart can take today."

"Sorry, Papa," Izuku apologized, guilt blossoming from deep within him, "No more falling today."

His Papa only lightly bumped his chin against the top of his head to show that he had heard him and carried him further into their apartment, his long legs bringing them into the living room quickly.

(His sandals laid discarded by the door, having been kicked off when he realized that he wasn’t getting put back down on the ground any time soon. He took a split second to marvel at the sharp talons that tipped each toe. How pointy!)

It was quiet, apart from his Papa's heartbeat and occasional sniffle at least.

(These were happy tears though. His Papa was happy that he came home, even though he had been bad and missed both school and lunch today.)

The quietness of the apartment unnerved him.

Izuku couldn't hear his Dad anywhere.

"Papa?" He asked as his Papa settled down onto the couch with him on his lap, placing the fluffy squirrel tail on the coffee table, then making sure he was comfortable where he was before acknowledging him with a questioning hum, "Where's Dad?"

"He'll be coming straight home no matter where he is now," With a wry chuckle, his Papa picked up his phone laying on the coffee table, tapping to speed-dial his Dad, "Say 'hi' to him when I tell you to, alright?"

Izuku nodded, agreeing to the easy task. Anything to keep more tears from coming out of his Papa's eyes.

The phone rang and rang.

After a few seconds, the call was picked up.

"Aizawa speaking."

It was his Dad!

"Go on, say 'hi," His Papa nudged him lightly, handing him the phone, "Then give the phone back to me."

"Hi, Dad."

He dutifully repeated, then placed the phone back into his Papa's waiting hand.

"Yo-"

"Izuku?" His Dad cut his Papa off, voice incredulous, "Where are you?"

"I'm home!" He raised his voice, hoping that his Dad could hear him even when he wasn't speaking directly into the phone, "Papa's home with me!"

“Yeah, Shou, we’re home!” There was a mischievous look on his Papa’s face, “And I’m gonna hog all the Izuku cuddles until you get back.”

Izuku could hear the disgruntled sound his Dad made before the call was abruptly ended by his Papa, the phone getting placed facedown back onto the table.

"That was mean, Papa," Izuku couldn't stop the words from leaving his mouth, "Dad’s gonna be mad."

"Well, you wanted to see him sooner, yeah?" His Papa hummed, fingers reaching up to tousle his hair, "This will do the trick!"

He did want to see his Dad sooner rather than later, but still!

Wouldn’t this just make his Dad more upset?

 

Oh.

Wait a second.

That was it!

“Papa did a logical ruse.”

He gasped, patting his hand against his Papa’s upper arm to get his attention. His Papa paled in response, dragging a hand against the side of his face.

“It’s contagious, ‘Zuku,” An exaggerated pout decorated his face, though there was a twinkle of amusement in his eyes, “You gotta cuddle away all of this from me.”

Izuku knew what ‘contagious’ meant, but wasn’t that word usually only used for when someone got sick and could give it to you? He was pretty sure that logical ruses weren’t some sort of disease or sickness too, so he didn’t really understand what his Papa was talking about.

However, he was a big fan of cuddles, so he went ahead and slipped an arm under his Papa’s so that he could hug him properly.

They spent a moment like that in silence, just him leaning his weight against his Papa and his Papa allowing him to do so.

It was a nice position to be in, feeling the warmth his Papa had to offer and to not worry about his leg that finally stopped twinging once he had managed to switch from being a whole owl to only some owl.

This had to be part of his quirk, right?

He could even feel the couch with the wing that was splayed out on it, his other wing being held close to his side so he didn’t knock over the jar of pencils that was on the coffee table.

These were definitely his wings.

The colors and pattern on them was unmistakable and he had seen loads of photos that his Papa had taken of him back when he had only just been an owl, so he knew he wasn’t wrong about this.

“Your hair is so fluffy now, ‘Zuku,” His Papa murmured, fingers lightly brushing at the hair that was starting to cover his eyes, “Not that it wasn’t before, but this is another level, ya know?”

“It’s not feathers, is it?” Izuku wondered, slightly worried, “Do I have feathers on my head?”

His head was patted, a small chuckle rumbling in his Papa’s throat.

“It’s just hair up here, yeah?” A light kiss was pressed to the top of his head, “Your hair, it’s here, okay?”

Izuku groaned.

English was something he was fairly familiar with by now, both his Papa and Nedzu-san slipping into it at times when they knew that the words they were going to use were ones that he understood or easy enough to pick up on with enough context.

He didn’t need any context for this.

This was just his Papa’s brand of humor.

“You do have some small feathers down here though,” A finger ghosted under his eyes, right by where he knew his freckles were located, “But those are the only ones I can see right now.”

Izuku made to get off of his Papa’s lap, wanting to locate a mirror to see for himself, but long arms reached out to keep him there.

He blinked, surprised.

“Not right now, ‘Zuku,” Soft words from his Papa, but there was an undercurrent of something hurt there as well, “Just, not right now.”

His Papa must really still be upset about the whole situation, huh.

He felt awful about it, knowing that this was partially his fault.

Getting thrown out the window wasn’t something he could have changed, but he probably could have tried to find a way back into U.A., or maybe even find his Dad who had been heading to U.A. with lunch.

Instead, he had taken a long nap, making his parents worry about him for hours probably.

They were probably still mad as well.

His Dad had worked so hard to make him and Nedzu-san lunch and he hadn’t even managed to be there for it.

 

“Are you mad at me?”

He mumbled the question, not exactly wanting to know the answer, but also unwilling to spend the rest of the night wondering about it.

The arms around him tightened, but not the kind of tight that would squeeze him until there was nothing left of him. It was the kind that was both warm and comforting, smelling something like lemons as well.

(And wasn’t that a surprise! He could still smell despite being partly owl!)

They stayed like that for a moment longer until his Papa started speaking again, voice low.

“I’m not mad, no.”

“And what about Dad?” He continued, “Is he mad at me?”

“Shouta isn’t mad either,” His Papa gave him a weak grin, “Mad with worry probably, but not mad in the way you’re thinking.”

That was good.

Something deep inside of him settled at hearing that.

“I’m sorry I took so long to come home, Papa,” Izuku still felt the need to apologize though, “The sun was really high in the sky, so I took a nap and then I went flying afterwards.” And he had forgotten about them too for a bit, but he didn’t exactly want to make his Papa cry again, so he skipped that, “And then no one would let me in cause I was an owl and I don’t have the keys and owls don’t even have pockets-!”

He knew he was rambling, but he couldn’t stop, tears coming to his eyes as he just kept apologizing and apologizing, wanting his Papa to know that he hadn’t meant to even make them worry so much about him.

Because he had been fine.

Izuku had lived out there for a long time by himself and though he hadn’t for a while now after his parents had taken him in, it wasn’t something he could forget.

He had been fine, yeah, but all the same, he had missed both his Dad and Papa badly once he had realized they hadn’t been there with him to gaze down on the city from where he had been perched.

School was hard enough, (and he loved going to U.A. too), having to be separated from them, but at least he had Nedzu-san there with him. Learning was fun enough that he could momentarily forget that his parents weren’t just right there for him to go hug.

“Oh, Izuku,” His Papa gave him another small squeeze to his side, “I’m just glad you got home safely.”

Hearing that made him feel warm inside.

“I couldn’t do anything, ya know?”, He murmured, voice so quiet that Izuku wondered if he was actually talking to him or just letting his thoughts out, rambling like he tended to do, “Shouta was out and about looking for you even when he knew the chances of finding you as an owl during the day was astronomically low, and I just couldn’t do anything like that.”

That was logical.

Izuku knew he had stayed hidden for a long time on his own, no one ever even suspecting he might be near until he had started revealing himself to his Dad. It was very hard to find an owl when they didn’t want to be found.

“When Shouta told me that you went missing from school, everything froze for me,” His Papa looked upset, so he went ahead and laid his head against his chest, grabbing the nearest hand to place on his hair, waiting. As expected, his Papa started petting his hair, fingers carding through the strands, and body losing some of the tension it had gained, “You’re only a kid, Izuku. Too much has already happened to you.”

“You were home though,” And he was very glad that his Papa had been because he really didn’t know what would have happened if no one had been home when he had gotten back, “You waited home for me.”

“I knew you would come home, so yeah.”

Oh.

 

His Papa really was the best Papa.

Izuku was home.

He had to get home.

Streetlights blurred from the speed he was going at.

It took him no time before he was sprinting to their apartment, his eyes noting that the lights of their living room were on, signifying that yes, Hizashi and Izuku were both home.

He had to see them though, see that Izuku was really home with his own eyes.

Shouta’s hand was shaking as he missed the keyhole to the entrance of their building once, twice, and nearly a third time before he just jammed in it blindly, huffing out his relief when he was able to turn it, unlocking the door.

Stairs were nothing in the face of the length of his legs and before he knew it, he had arrived at their door.

He jiggled the doorknob before knocking and then unlocking the door himself when nobody opened it for him.

And there he was.

Izuku was already halfway down the corridor to the entryway, a clicking sound that he hadn’t heard for months coming from his feet.

There were wings as well, though at the moment, they were held up and tucked behind his back.

There was something off about his gait though.

“I’m home.”

He announced, eyes still tracking how Izuku ran as he got closer to him even as he quickly lowered himself into a crouch so his knees didn’t take the brunt of a child running into them at full speed.

Izuku ran into his open arms.

“Welcome home, Dad!”

Temporarily putting aside whatever was potentially wrong with Izuku’s leg, he grunted as Izuku hugged his middle tightly, dipping down his chin to give him a proper hug, noticing that while Izuku’s hair was the same shade of green as it always was, the softness of it reminded him of the owl feathers that he still kept in his and Hizashi’s bedroom.

His mind raced.

Izuku had managed to both use his quirk to go from human to owl and from owl into some sort of hybrid form today.

Nemuri’s words had been a catalyst to the first instance, but what had happened to Izuku to have likely caused the second?

“Dad,” Izuku peered up at him, eyes big, “Dad, I’m home now, so you don’t have to worry, okay?”

Shouta only hugged him tighter, not moving even when Izuku gave him an indignant whine.

“You’re squishing me.”

At least Izuku was there in his arms so that he could be squished, he found himself thinking.

Despite the small complaint, Izuku didn’t struggle in his hold, leaning his head against his chest over his heart instead, a small satisfied hum leaving his mouth.

He could feel Hizashi’s gaze on them from the other end of the corridor. There were still the smoldering remains of irritation from that phone call, but he could feel them waste away to ash as he finally felt himself relax, knowing that all was well again.

Izuku was home.

And he was home.

Minutes passed between them, their slow breathing the only sounds he could hear.

Eventually, he decided to pick Izuku up, not wanting to spend the rest of the night by the open door, making sure to support both his legs and back properly as he did so, knowing that he had to be unused to the new weight on his back.

(Plus there was also the matter of a possible injured leg, so he had to keep an eye for that as well.)

“You got home in time for dinner,” Izuku chirped into his ear as he kicked off his boots, nudging both them and Izuku’s sandals to the side so no one would trip on them, “Papa got dinner tonight.”

“Hizashi did?”

He sniffed the air, the scent of fried rice and sesame chicken becoming apparent as he neared the kitchen.

“Mhm, Papa ordered on the phone,” Shouta nodded absentmindedly as he took in the spread on the table, the wide array of still piping hot Chinese takeout greeting him, “He said that you worked way too hard today to also make dinner.”

He could hear Hizashi’s groan coming from the living room.

Oh, how he loved Izuku’s non-filter when it wasn’t him being put on the spot.

“That’s nice of him to say,” He snorted, “Though he wasn’t very nice to me earlier on the phone, telling me he’d hog all of your cuddles.”

“I told Papa he was being mean,” Izuku informed him with a straight face; he had a hard time keeping a straight one himself hearing this, “But he was actually just doing a logical ruse to get you to come home faster.”

Simply amazing.

Izuku still had no concept of a social filter, though in this specific case, it worked in his favor and only resulted in Hizashi’s apparent embarrassment, which was funny enough to witness because he usually had nothing that would embarrass him.

“Why don’t you fetch Hizashi for dinner and let me freshen up?”

Putting Izuku back down carefully, he noted the sharp talons on his toes and the smaller ones acting as fingernails. Thankfully, it seemed Izuku knew to be careful with them already, likely something that had carried over from his time as an owl.

This time, he watched carefully as Izuku made his way to the living room, clearly favoring one leg over the other, though he hid it well enough to be unnoticeable to someone who didn’t go looking for these sorts of things.

So he had been right.

Izuku was hurt.

From what he could recall, it was even the same leg that Nemuri had targeted when she had used her whip.

He quickly washed his hands and then his face, toweling them off and returned to the kitchen where Hizashi and Izuku were both already seated.

This was something he had to get to the bottom of.

“Izuku, you’re hurt,” Taking his own seat, Shouta made sure to keep his voice neutral as he spoke, “When did this happen?”

“Uh.”

“He’s hurt?!” Hizashi exclaimed, quickly turning to Izuku, “You’re hurt?”

“Only a little bit,” Izuku wouldn’t meet either of their gazes, “It hurts less now.”

“So it hurt more before?”

“When I was an owl, kinda, yeah,” Izuku admitted, “But really, it’s better now.”

Shouta could feel himself run cold at Izuku’s admission.

If this had happened when he had been an owl, then it had to be Nemuri that had caused it.

He could feel the anger running hot in him again.

Not only had she thrown their son out the window, but she had injured him in the process as well?

This wasn’t the time to get angry though; he had Izuku to think about and Izuku had said nothing about what had even caused this injury.

“How did you get hurt?” Hizashi fussed over him, “Do we need to take you to a doctor?”

Izuku looked reluctant to talk, but all of Hizashi’s worries must have worn him down, because despite looking like he wanted to leave the dinner table and have his meal in the living room alone, he didn’t.

“At U.A., there was someone called Midnight and she used a whip,” Izuku mimed the snapping action of said whip, “And she used it and got me by my leg and I guess when she was swinging me around, it hurt me?”

He had seen the camera footage of this with Nedzu by his side.

Nedzu had looked more concerned than he had ever seen him, his eyes tracking Izuku’s and Nemuri’s every movement.

Eventually he had stepped out though, after watching Izuku draw himself up defensively, stepping in between his sleeping body and Nemuri.

Shouta would keep the knowledge of Nedzu being able to produce tears close to his heart, locked up in figurative chains.

It was the least he could do.

“I’ll take a look at it after dinner, and then we can go see Recovery Girl tomorrow if needed.”

He wasn’t leaving anything up to chance, even knowing that his knowledge of splinting and bandaging up injuries was likely more than enough for this.

(And it would give everybody else in U.A. a chance to see that Izuku was found and was alright. His sudden disappearance had caused quite an amount of worry, especially from both Ectoplasm and Snipe.)

“I can go to school tomorrow too?” Izuku sounded relieved, “Nedzu-san’s not mad?”

“He’s not,” Shouta promised, “He’ll be happy to see you.”

“And Midnight won’t be there?”

And therein was the issue.

It was one he had already dealt with, but Izuku deserved to know who she was and what had been going on.

“She won’t be,” He confirmed, “But we do have to have a talk about her and what happened at school.”

Izuku made a face, but nodded.

“Let’s eat first though, yeah?” Hizashi cut in, “No use having heavy conversations on empty stomachs.”

“Alright,” Shouta conceded, “Food first.”

Talk later.


Notes:

    Hizashi > So what's this fluffy thing?
    Izuku > Well, it used to be lunch, but I ate the food part of it.
    Hizashi >
    Hizashi > Ah 〣( ºΔº )〣

    Shouta is home! And he's noticing all of the things pretty quickly xD Hizashi's excuse is that he was 'carrying him the entire time! I would have noticed too!'

    I really wanted to get the proper discussion in this chapter, but it got long and well, it'll just have to be the next chapter :')

    Hizashi really didn't want to let go of Izuku and he didn't! Until Shouta got back home at least! He had Izuku with him the entire time from ordering takeout, getting the takeout (which arrived faster than Shouta did haha), and back to the kitchen to put it out. He's very good at doing things with one hand.

    Please let me know your thoughts! :D As always, thank you so much for all the comments! <33 They keep me going!

    Next chapter comes out March 19th! It's time to talk.

Chapter Text

Dinner passed quickly.

Izuku was thankful he had been able to use his chopsticks even with the talons tipping his fingers.

(It would have been embarrassing if he hadn't been able to and he didn't exactly want to ask his Dad to erase his quirk right now. He had his wings! And this time he even had his fingers! He liked having both at the same time.)

But even though both his Dad and Papa were there, (something rare for dinnertime) and the food was good, he couldn't stop the sickly sensation in his belly from growing bigger.

He was not looking forward to the talk that his Dad wanted to have.

And the thing was, though his dads were usually very willing to listen to him out on things he didn't want to do, there was no way he was getting out of this particular one.

Plus, Izuku knew he owed them some answers.

It was the least he could do after causing them so much worry.

When his Dad started to gather together their used plates and chopsticks, carrying them over to the sink to be washed, he knew it was about time.

With his Papa also home and there to help with the drying, the dishes were done in practically no time. The leftovers were then put away for the next day. And after the table was given a quick once-over for anything missed, his Papa offered out his arms to him.

"Don't wanna put any unneeded pressure on that leg of yours, yeah?"

Izuku really didn't think it was that big of a deal, but if his Papa was offering, then it would be rude to refuse.

Once he had made himself comfortable in his Papa's arms, he was carried into the living room and placed onto the couch.

His wings were super cool and he loved knowing they were there, but they sure did make things inconvenient at times. He couldn’t just sit like he usually did since doing that took up so much room on the couch with how big his wings were when he wasn’t actively keeping them tucked to his sides or behind him.

(And he really didn’t want to take up all the room on the couch; how else would his Papa sit next to him? Or his Dad?)

The problem was that he didn't know how to undo this transformation without his Dad's Erasure, not that he wanted to even get rid of his wings in any capacity.

However, if he did know how to get back to how he was right now, that meant he could make them go away for the moments where they got in the way, and then get them back later when he wanted them around again.

He supposed that was what his Dad wanted for him when he insisted on him not forcing his quirk to work under stressful situations. It was very logical, Izuku had to admit.

“Alright, let’s get comfortable before we get started.”

His Dad said as he joined them, giving him a small pat on the head before taking a seat on the stool he brought out with him.

(It was his stool! Izuku had to resist asking to switch seats with his Dad. He had missed his stool. It lived under the kitchen table nowadays when it wasn't being used for extra seating purposes.)

His Papa sat on the couch with him, though he was only sitting on the edge of it, obviously being careful not to brush into any of his feathers.

Izuku felt bad.

His wings were hogging the entire couch.

“Izuku?” His Papa shifted himself closer to him, eyes bright with worry, “Is something wrong?”

He shook his head, determined to keep this to himself.

All he had to do was figure out how to get his quirk to work how he wanted it to and not whatever it wanted, whenever it wanted.

Izuku had to admit, he was feeling a bit more confident about his control over his quirk now since he did manage to go from owl to part owl without having to go through being hungry again, more fiery explosions, or even getting thrown out of another window!

“You’re sure?” His Papa sure was insistent; Izuku held back a pout, his nerves actually calming down slightly at the familiarity of this interaction, “You know you can come to us with anything, yeah?”

“I know, Papa,” He leaned over to pat his Papa on the knee, hoping to lessen his worry, “But nothing’s wrong right now.”

However, his Papa did not seem encouraged at all by his words, the wrinkle between his brows deepening further.

Izuku felt even worse seeing that.

There wasn’t much he could do about it though, so he just took his Papa’s hand in his, intertwining their fingers together, being very careful with his nails, and giving his hand a light squeeze. It would be a reminder for his Papa so he would know that he was right there, not hurt, and home.

He could feel his Papa squeeze his hand gently in return.

That was good.

“Izuku?”

His Dad spoke this time.

“How are you feeling?”

He thought about the question.

How was he feeling?

For the most part, he thought he was fine.

He was home after having dinner together with his dads, so he had nothing to complain about. And he had even managed to use his quirk twice today and it hadn’t made him super tired at all yet!

(Though he did suspect that was only because he had taken such a big nap after using it the first time. It was inconvenient though, if he had to nap every time after he used his quirk. His Dad would call it illogical and he'd be right!)

Sure, it had been scary for him earlier in the day, but that was all over, wasn’t it?

 

Well, he still kind of wanted Midnight to take those words back.

Getting reminded of something like that, whether it be from other people or even his own dreams, always made him feel uneasy.

It made him doubt that the game of hide and seek his Mama had started with him had truly ended.

(Which he knew was a ridiculous thought to be having!)

Izuku treasured the day that his Dad had found him.

Picked him up and took him back home like it was just another day of the week to him.

He had never mentioned to them the nightmares he’d have sometimes where his Dad never did find him. Or the ones he had where his Dad’s heartbeat had stopped right outside his old roost and had continued down the street not too long after. Ones where it had been Hisashi to find him instead, licks of flame crawling up and around his body.

They would wake him up in the middle of the night and with his Dad out on patrol at that time, he never could fall asleep again until he heard their front door unlock and open, meaning that his Dad had come home safe after another night of fighting crime. He’d usually leave his own door open as well, which meant that his Dad always stopped by his room before heading off to bed where his Papa was.

“Izuku,” His Dad had always sighed, picking him up from where he was by the window, “You can’t just stay up all night looking out at the moon and stars.” But despite the slight admonishing tone his voice had, his touch was only ever kind and gentle while placing him back into bed, “How are you going to grow taller without enough rest?”

He remembered that he had just shrugged off the question every time, not even wanting to admit to anyone that he did try, but had failed due to the nightmares that would strike at him once he did manage to nod off.

Izuku thought he had been lucky enough that the nightmares didn’t happen all that often, but whenever they did, it left him feeling horrible, his pulse echoing in his ears.

And after his Dad had told him about the arsonist group, Firebird, and how likely it was that Hisashi was a member of it, his nightmares had only gotten worse.

He had tried his best to ignore them and it helped that during the day, he had a lot to be looking forward to. His nightmares were all but forgotten when he was at school or at gymnastics, forward rolling along with the group he had classes with. He also had his weekly meetings with Hitoshi at the park and if he was lucky, he got to visit Tenya in Hosu on Sundays as well.

(His Papa liked to call him a busy bee, but wasn’t his Papa even busier than he was? What did that make him then?)

“I’m okay,” Izuku finally replied, “Everything’s fine.”

It wasn’t a lie.

At the moment, everything was fine.

Izuku couldn’t imagine making his parents worry even more about him after what had happened today.

He only hoped that his Dad would ask him easy questions.

The easiest ones.

Please.

Was it though?

 

No, Hizashi had to admit, it decidedly wasn’t.

He wondered if Izuku knew that he sounded like he was trying to convince himself of that, rather than Shouta.

“Alright,” Shouta took the answer in stride, though Hizashi knew the crinkle in his brow meant he had definitely picked up on Izuku’s current mood, “Then let’s put together some ground rules for this conversation.”

“Ground rules?” Izuku repeated after him, eyes flicking down to the rug on the floor before up to Shouta again, “What are those?”

“Special rules or guidelines for a particular conversation or meeting,” Shouta hummed, ticking off fingers as he listed off a few more examples, “Could apply to any sort of activity, event, or even inside classrooms.”

“Like how Nedzu-san asks to be called Nedzu-sensei when he’s teaching me inside ours?”

“Precisely,” A small nod followed the confirmation, “Though that is more of a courtesy than anything else.”

“So what sort of ground rules..?”

Izuku left his question unfinished, but it was enough for Shouta to pick up from to continue.

“We both know that this conversation will be hard for you, Izuku,” Hizashi quickly nodded in agreement; Izuku’s hand squeezed his again, though he was quite sure it wasn’t for comfort this time, but a reflex due to nerves, “While Hizashi and I would like it if you answered everything to your best ability, we understand if you can’t.” A familiar stubborn look crossed Izuku’s face as he took in Shouta’s words, “Don’t force yourself if it hurts you, Izuku.”

Hizashi shuffled himself closer, taking care to not brush into any of Izuku’s feathers behind him. He knew that Izuku had been picky with his feathers as an owl, getting nippy if anyone dared to touch them without prior permission. And right now with Izuku being so on edge, it wasn’t worth it to place him under any more unnecessary stress.

“Just do your best, yeah, ‘Zuku?” He grinned down at him, trying his best to exude reassurance, “If you need a break, just let us know.”

Izuku nodded, brushing the side of his head against his arm. Hizashi resisted the urge to pick him back up, permission be damned, and give him a good ol’ squish to his chest.

But he knew that Izuku might not like the suddenness of that and could even choose to move away from him, and that was not something he wanted for this conversation or ever.

“Let’s get started then,” Shouta offered Izuku a kind look, even as he started with what had to be one of the harder questions in the list he must have put together in his head, “Can you tell us what happened today at school to cause you to use your quirk?”

Hizashi could immediately feel the small hand in his own tense up.

This was off to a horrible start, if he had to be honest; he kind of hated that they needed to remind Izuku of the events that had happened earlier today, but this was something they absolutely needed to know.

Not only would it give them Izuku’s perspective on all of this, it would give them an opportunity to learn what to avoid next time to prevent this from happening again.

With how he had injured Nemuri due to this, this wasn’t something they could ignore and just hope that it would solve itself with enough time. They needed to take action. Izuku needed to see someone to address all this trauma that was obviously still affecting him to some degree. This would be a good opportunity to approach that with him.

Oh, but he was not looking forward to trying to convince Izuku to go to therapy.

He had enough trouble convincing Shouta to go and that had been with a strong logical argument that he had spent weeks on creating.

“Well, I was doing my work and then Nedzu-san had to go to his office cause someone called Midnight was asking for him,” Izuku started slowly, clearly picking and choosing which words to use, “And I got curious so I went over to try and listen to their conversation.” He looked guilty; the same type of guilt painted his face when he would try to eavesdrop on his parents on what they had planned for their annual summer family vacation, only to get caught due to his mother’s quirk alerting her of his presence. “I probably shouldn’t have done that.”

“Well, you know for next time now, yeah?”

Kids eavesdropping on an adult’s conversation was nothing new, but Izuku’s little adventure definitely had much more harsh consequences than most others.

“And what happened after this?”

“Midnight heard me somehow and then she… She…” Izuku immediately puffed up, his feathers bristling out behind him, making him look like an angry ball of fluff, “Midnight said that I was playing hide and seek!” Hizashi winced at the sudden force of the grip Izuku had on his hand, the pinpricks of the talons on his skin making him intimately aware that Izuku was able to poke holes into people right now if he really wanted to, “And I wasn’t!”

“And you aren’t,” Shouta concurred, “I know this.” Hizashi met his gaze when he shifted it over to him, “We know this.”

“It was over!” Izuku bulldozed over Shouta’s softly spoken words, “When you found me, the game ended!”

Hizashi ran a finger over Izuku’s shaking hand, trying his best to keep himself outwardly calm despite the pain he felt inside hearing all of this.

If he lost it now, then he knew Izuku would soon follow, and then they'd get absolutely nowhere with this conversation.

And considering all the shit that had happened for them to even get to this particular point?

They needed to make the best of it.

He just hadn’t realized that this game of hide and seek that Midoriya Inko had started had affected Izuku that deeply.

Somehow, he didn’t think Shouta had either.

“I wasn’t playing anymore,” Izuku’s finally wailed out and fuck, Hizashi could feel himself crumbling as Izuku’s voice did, “I don’t want to play hide and seek anymore.”

Despite seeing Shouta’s motion to stand, Hizashi went on ahead and decided to give Izuku the hug he had been wanting to give him from the very beginning; he shouldn’t have let him go at all in the first place, not when Izuku was still this emotionally vulnerable.

“And you don’t need to, ‘Zuku,” Pulling Izuku into his lap in one easy motion, he made sure to have one arm support his back like he had seen Shouta do so earlier, “Like you said before, it’s over now and you don’t have to if you don’t want to, okay?”

While he knew Midoriya Inko had good intentions when she had asked Izuku to go hide, he had to admit that during these times when Izuku showed them how fucked up it had all been to him, he hated her for what she had done to their son.

(She had done the right thing in saving Izuku’s life, but Hizashi couldn’t forgive the way she had gone about it all the same.)

"Hizashi’s right,” The couch dipped as Shouta sat down next to him, running a hand through Izuku’s hair, “I’m sorry her words made you think that you had to again.”

“It’s not your fault though,” Izuku's tone was petulant, sounding more childish than ever, “She said it, not you.”

“I know,” Shouta sighed, averting his gaze, “But Midnight would have known if we had told her and we could have avoided all of this happening.”

There was a look of surprise in Izuku’s eyes, tears seemingly forgotten as he tried to parse through Shouta’s words.

“What do you mean?” He demanded, hair becoming more unruly, bits of it reminding Hizashi of those ear tufts that Mimizuku had; he hastily tried to pat it down before it got into his face, “Do you know Midnight?”

Hizashi felt the awkwardness that Shouta had to be feeling in full force by now.

“Mm,” He grunted, “Midnight’s civilian name is Kayama Nemuri.”

Izuku froze, a stunned expression on his face.

He could practically see all the gears in Izuku’s brain calculating what this meant.

“Kayama-san threw me out a window.”

The whisper that left Izuku’s mouth nearly made him laugh out loud, the sheer ridiculousness of it in this serious conversation punching him in the gut.

“I attacked Kayama-san,” Izuku then said louder, alarm leaking into his voice, “I attacked your friend.”

Oh man, maybe Shouta should have eased Izuku into Nemuri’s identity a bit more.

This was just distressing Izuku out!

And while it was true that they had Nemuri’s permission to tell Izuku about this, there had to have been a better way to go about this, right?

“Nemuri wants you to know that she’s sorry for throwing you out a window,” Shouta continued, much to his horror; he was certain this was not how anyone should speak to children, “And that she’s also sorry for thinking you wanted to eat Nedzu.”

“I would never!” Izuku gave them an affronted look, “Nedzu-san’s my friend!”

“We know,” Hizashi soothed, not wanting tempers to rise anymore than they already had, “Very good friends.”

“Is.. Is Nedzu-san okay?” The fight left Izuku’s eyes as worry overtook it again, “I think he is, but I couldn’t see into his office from the windows. So I don't know for sure.”

“He’s fine,” Shouta snorted, a soft amusement punctuating his voice, “He’s more worried about you, I think.”

Relief flooded Izuku’s expression, though the tenseness didn’t leave his body. Holding Izuku right now kind of felt like holding a small statue. A very cute one, but a statue nonetheless.

He wondered what was on Izuku’s mind to make him worry so much still.


“Did I hurt Kayama-san a lot?”

Ah.

How typical of Izuku to worry about Nemuri even after the events that had happened.

“Will she want to stop being your friend because of me?”

“Izuku,” Shouta cleared his throat, “Izuku, she’s fine.” Hizashi tried not to think about the gashes that Izuku had left on Nemuri, “I sent her to see Recovery Girl.”

“And we’ve gone through a lot together, ya know, ‘Zuku,” Hizashi allowed himself a small chuckle, “Something like this isn’t going to affect our friendship.”

Much.

It wouldn’t affect their friendship, but it would affect the list of potential emergency babysitters for Izuku. It was only getting shorter from here on out.

They really needed to tell Tensei about this as soon as they could too. Having this happen again but including Tenya as a witness could really mess up the friendship between the two kids. And Izuku needed all the friends he could get.

“I really messed up, didn’t I?” Izuku murmured, tone sad, “I’m really sorry.”

Aw shit.

“You can’t blame yourself for this,” Shouta immediately denied, his own voice firm, “We, the adults, can all take part in the blame for this, but you’re the victim here, Izuku.”

“I still feel like I did something wrong,” The worry was apparent in Izuku’s voice, breaking his heart, “I just got so angry hearing her say that and I just couldn’t stop myself.”

This was it, wasn’t it?

“We do have a possible solution.” Their only solution right now, as well. Oh boy! “There are people called therapists out there you can talk to. It's their job to listen to you and do their best to help you through things that happened.”

“There’s one that works at U.A. right now actually,” Shouta added after a small pause.

Izuku looked surprised at hearing that, a contemplative look crossing his features.

Was it possible that Izuku already knew who it was?

(The most prominent of U.A.'s staff that Izuku talked about, if one didn't include Nedzu, was Ectoplasm and Snipe. There was offhand mentions of Powerloader and Lunch Rush, but they were never mentioned that much or often at all.)

“His name is Hound Dog.”

“Isn't that Inui-san?” So Izuku did know of him! It was better than convincing Izuku to go meet a complete stranger, “That’s his hero name!”

“Do you wanna try?” Hizashi resisted the urge to plead as he asked, “We think this can really help you.”

“Okay,” Despite not looking too certain about it, he agreed to the request, “I’ll try it.”

It was possible that Izuku had only agreed to go along with this to keep the two of them happy, but that he had agreed in the first place, it was enough for now.

Hizashi could have cried in relief, but just allowed himself to hug Izuku again, snaking his free arm to drag Shouta into the hug as well.

They would be fine.

They would all be fine.


Notes:

    Hizashi > Shouta, you could have been less blunt about all of this, ya know?
    Shouta > Perhaps, but it would be illogical.
    Izuku > Yeah!
    Hizashi >
    Hizashi > ( ´•̥̥̥ω•̥̥̥` )

    Izuku will eventually talk about his nightmares to his dads, but today is not the day :x

    He does finally know that Nemuri is Midnight though, so there's that! And we get some insight on why 'hide and seek' messes with him so much! The emergency babysitting list is just Tensei and Nedzu right now. Tsukauchi is the emergency last option if the other two are unavailable.

Chapter Text

Shouta woke up to a finger jabbing his cheek.

Ignoring the insistent pokes, he only managed a few more seconds of peace before the target was changed to his nose.

He squinted a bleary eye open, meeting the bright green ones that peered back at him.

These were not the eyes of his husband, who was still snoring lightly next to him, but the eyes of his usually sensible son, Izuku.

His son who had apparently decided to wake him up some fucking early hour of the day where the sun hadn’t even started rising yet.

What had happened to his sleep-loving son who always grumbled in the morning when he went to wake him up to get ready for the day? Who napped in the car for the entire ride if Hizashi decided to drive him to school instead?

“Why are you awake, Izuku?” He let out a low groan; he had taken the night off patrol too, not wanting to go out there when he had already been exhausted after searching for Izuku in the forest surrounding U.A., “It’s too early to be awake.”

Big green eyes blinked back at him before Izuku cooed, leaning his front half forward onto their bed. He could feel the pinpricks of talons through the light blanket that covered his body.

(It seemed that Izuku’s half-owl half-human transformation was stable enough for him to keep it active throughout the hours that he did sleep. Then again, he shouldn’t be too surprised, seeing that Izuku had managed to stay an owl for over a year and a half just fine.)

"Can we go to school yet?"

Izuku's voice was perky, of all the things it could be at this time of day.

He had grown incredibly used to intelligible mumbles from Izuku in the mornings.

If he thought about it hard enough, he supposed it made enough sense for it not to be a reach. Eurasian eagle owls were crepuscular and with the sun barely peeking its way over the horizon, this was a time that Izuku's owl side naturally was more active.

This did not mean he wanted Izuku to end up a dawn person though.

He loved his son very much, but there was no way he was going to take responsibility for Izuku when he was being woken up that early.

Thankfully, there was Hizashi to take in mind. His lovely and smart husband who coincidentally loved mornings and rose out of bed accordingly.

"'Zashi," He reached out behind him and patted the sleeping lump that was the love of his life, mindful of Izuku's curious gaze, very much aware that nothing could be hidden from an owl's eyes even in relative darkness, "Your son wants to go to school."

Hizashi did not stir.

Ah, the poor tired man.

However, he was even more of a tired man. A perpetually exhausted man even.

"Go on, Izuku," Shouta closed his eyes again, only wanting to get back to sleep as soon as possible before the day could actually start; he was too tired to feel any guilt at setting their eager son on another target, "Tell your Papa how much you want to go to school."

Alas, instead of heading around the bed to get to Hizashi like he had expected him to, Izuku hauled himself onto their bed, his wings flapping once or twice

Izuku was careful enough with his talons, but Shouta was getting lightly smacked every time those wings beat down.

Crawling on all fours now, Izuku made his way over him, obviously trying not to step on him as he did. The thing was, even with all the care Izuku was taking, he was still a child made up of sharp angles and he could only groan, curling up a bit, when an errant knee jabbed him in the kidney.

“Papa,” Izuku finally clambered over him, positioning himself to sit on top of Hizashi’s sleeping body, “Papaa!” Shouta shifted himself over so he could face them properly instead of having to crane his neck. Even in lieu of more sleep, he really wanted to have a front seat for Izuku’s antics. “Let’s go to school together now!”

Amazingly enough, there was still no movement from Hizashi except for a short snuffling sound. And frankly, if Hizashi could sleep right through Izuku climbing onto their bed and then onto him, he deserved whatever was in store for him.

“Pa. Pa!” Izuku bounced, another ‘pa’ leaving his mouth every time his body made contact with Hizashi’s, “Papa!”

The sound that Hizashi made was akin to a deflating balloon, all sad and out of gas.

Unfocused eyes met his and then darted up at Izuku who was mid-bounce.

They collided.

Hizashi’s eyes bugged out and Izuku looked delighted that he had finally achieved his goal of getting Hizashi’s attention.

“‘Zuku, baby,” Even with his bedhead and the pillow creases on one side of his face, Shouta couldn’t help but feel a surge of fondness for his husband who was visibly trying to swallow a yawn; he did look exasperated though, especially once he glanced in the direction of the window, just the barest bits of deep purple decorating the horizon, “Shouldn’t you be sleeping?”

“I wanna go to school to see Nedzu-san,” Izuku looked positively innocent despite the chaos he had just caused, “Please.”

“It’s too early for school, yea-ah?” Hizashi lost the battle against his yawn, jaw stretching as he gave in, “Papa needs his beauty sleep, okay, ‘Zuku?” He relaxed back into the bed even as Izuku stared down at him, a pout forming on his lips, “Your Papa doesn’t want wrinkles yet.”

“But Papa,” Izuku wiggled himself over so he was laying on his side facing Hizashi, wings splayed across their bodies like an additional blanket. An abnormally warm blanket, Shouta noted. Odd. “You’re already twenty-three years old.”

Shouta couldn’t keep in his chuckle at that; Hizashi’s affronted expression was priceless.

However, it really was time to either get Izuku back to bed or get himself out of it, allowing Hizashi to get in a bit more rest. Leaving Izuku unsupervised while he was awake was only welcoming trouble.

“Two options, Izuku,” Izuku switched to looking at him, eyes big, “We go back to sleep now and wake up earlier than usual so you can see Sensei before we go visit Shuuzenji-sensei, or we wake up now and you go to bed earlier tonight.”

“Sleep now.”

Izuku’s reply was instantaneous.

He then curled up where he was, in the space between him and Hizashi, eyelids already sliding close, apparently deciding that he was fine not returning to his room to sleep.

Shouta could tell he wasn’t really asleep though.

Maneuvering a hand out from under the blanket, he ruffled Izuku’s hair gently, making sure to make rustling sounds so he didn’t take Izuku by surprise.

It was cute how Izuku melted into his touch, if not a bit sad with the knowledge of his upbringing in the forefront of his mind.

“Good night, Izuku,” Hizashi murmured, voice already thick with sleep, “Sweet dreams.”

Izuku seemed to relax further hearing that, breathing finally evening out in a manner resembling sleep.

That was good enough for him.

He closed his own eyes and allowed himself to drift off, the warmth of Izuku’s wings lulling him back into his dreams.

The sun’s light was beating down on him.

It was a reminder that he had promised Izuku that they would leave earlier just so they could go see Nedzu before anything else.

Honestly, seeing Recovery Girl probably wasn’t necessary; Izuku only seemed to have pulled a muscle, but it was better to be safe than sorry. Doubly since Izuku’s quirk was still enough of a mystery to him and Hizashi.

The transformation from owl to human was clear cut, but with the addition of this new stable half owl form, things got a bit more fuzzy.

The camera footage had shown that owl-Izuku still had his tracker on him, and that had implications.

Just where did it go when Izuku wasn't an owl?

Was that the reason why Izuku still had the same clothes he had worn that morning?

There was a lot to think about.

Especially since they had to take this new information into account in accordance with Izuku’s injury.

It was only logical to see a trained professional about this.

And since they would be in U.A., he was sure Nedzu would have theories about this and ways to test those theories as well.

Waking up a winged Izuku proved to be difficult.

Those wings were hazardous and Izuku seemed determined to bat them in his face when he dug his talons into the blanket he had been sleeping on top of, eyes still closed.

In the end, he had to remind Izuku that they had plans today and if he didn’t wake up in time, they wouldn’t have the time to see Nedzu before having to rush to their appointment.

That definitely rocketed Izuku out of their bed, talons clicking down the hallway to head back into his room, frantically mumbling about what to wear to school.

After a quick breakfast, Hiizashi shuffled them all into his car, the early hour meaning he had the time to drop them off before having to head into the station for work.

It was a quick drive, Izuku humming the entire time, an excited but nervous air around him.

He took Izuku up into his arms once he got out of the car, careful to arrange him in a way that would allow him to keep his wings free. It wasn’t too far to the school and he didn’t want to risk Izuku worsening his injury after he had already been on his feet today, saying that it only hurt ‘a little bit.’ A little bit could change into a bigger bit, and he wanted to avoid that.

“Have a good day, ‘Zuku,” Hizashi came out of the car, heading over to them to press a kiss to Izuku’s cheeks under the tiny feathers there, “Be good, yeah?”

“I promise, Papa.”

Izuku replied dutifully and Hizashi only cooed back at him.

“Shou,” Hizashi murmured his name, his worry only barely visible in his eyes, “Watch over him for me too, okay?”

He couldn’t even begin to understand the sort of thoughts that must be running through Hizashi’s head right now, having to leave Izuku again so quickly after that day they had yesterday.

“I will,” He promised, “I’ll keep him safe.”

Hizashi offered him a smile, leaning forward to give him a peck on the lips.

Shouta could feel his ears warm.

“You just get going,” He hid his flustered state, breaking away; Hizashi was incredibly good at figuring him out and he didn’t need to get even more flustered right now, “I don’t want you to be late.”

“Oh, fine,” Hizashi laughed, “One more for the road?”

Izuku nodded eagerly, offering his other unkissed cheek which was promptly remedied with a kiss.

He was such a sucker for the people he loved.

Shouta leaned forward this time, meeting Hizashi’s lips with his own.

Then he spun, leaving Hizashi’s giggles and his car behind and headed for U.A.’s security gate, glad that Hizashi had parked in an area where there were no curious spectators.

(He did not need the fact that he could feel real and actual affection towards people known to the public.)

Nedzu had given him a new security card yesterday, allowing him access to U.A. and all its facilities, so getting through the gate was no issue, and he had no worries about any robots chasing him down.

They were quickly approaching the school’s main entrance when they saw him.

"Nedzu-san!"

Izuku exclaimed, arm loosening around his shoulders as he leaned forward, waving a hand over at Nedzu who was standing by the entrance of the school and greeting the students that were entering.

Huh.

Shouta had to admit that it was a nice thing to do and a good way to ease students into his appearance and presence. The students didn’t look surprised at all, so this had to have been happening for a while already. A majority of them also greeted the principal back, their ‘good mornings’ interspaced between short bows as they walked past him.

"Oh, you're early, Izuku-kun!"

Nedzu’s ears pricked up at their approach, tail swaying in what Shouta knew to be unexpected pleasure with some underlying worry.

(Tracking the nuances of Nedzu’s mood had taken him a while to get used to, but it had been good practice for his observation skills back in the classroom and Nedzu had always seemed suspiciously pleased when he altered his own behavior to match his at times. Shouta had only wanted to stay on his teacher’s good side; he had heard enough rumors of how Nedzu could ruin you if he was really motivated to.)

"Izuku was determined to come early today," Shouta explained, silently greeting Nedzu with a small nod at the same time, "We're supposed to be headed over to the infirmary to see Shuuzenji-sensei first thing this morning, but someone wanted to make a pit stop before that."

"It's me!" Izuku chirped, wiggling a bit in his arms, "I wanted to say 'hi' to you before going to see Shuuzenji-san."

Thankfully, Izuku was easy enough to carry, despite how wiggly he could become.

There was a small part of him that still fretted over how light he still was. He had followed what the nutritionist had told them, carefully crafted each meal with precision and care, so he wasn’t quite sure why Izuku was still so much smaller than most other kids his age.

(Tensei had insisted that Tenya grew a bit every time he looked away from him if he wasn’t careful, but Izuku had done nothing of the sort so far. It was only even now that Shouta noticed that his hair was finally starting to get a bit longer, the fringe sometimes falling into his eyes. Oddly enough, it was like Izuku had been put on pause, even his hair not growing a bit since he first started to live as an owl.)

"Well, hello there then, Izuku-kun," Nedzu raised a paw in their direction, the grin on his face jolly with a touch of relief in it, “Good morning to you!”

Shouta could feel his heart lighten at the relief reflected back in Izuku’s delighted expression. Seeing Izuku happy made him happy; he had known that Izuku had been worried about whether Nedzu had been mad at him still, even after he had assured him otherwise, but it was good to see those fears finally being set to rest.

It was then he noticed that it had gotten noticeably more quiet.

Students were watching them.

He supposed it was quite a novelty, getting to see their principal interact with a child so familiarly.

But he could also see Izuku freeze up, also noticing that they were in the center of attention. His shoulder could feel it as well, the prickle of Izuku’s talons making him ever more aware that his son basically had his own set of knives at all times when his quirk was activated like this.

It was best that they moved on and got to the reason why they had even brought Izuku to school so early in the first place.

“Go ahead and say 'hi'," He murmured under his breath, knowing that Izuku would pick up on his words even with them being barely audible to most everyone else there; Izuku’s hearing was still as powerful as ever even though he wasn’t entirely an owl as of now, "We’ve got an appointment to keep and we don’t want to be late.”

Shouta could see uncertainty cross Izuku’s face despite his earlier excitement at coming early enough to see his friend first thing in the morning.

It seemed that Izuku was still not a fan of too many eyes on him.

And it was logical, considering how he had lived when he had been on his own.

(Shouta didn’t really see an issue with it. He also wasn’t exactly a fan of extraneous attention, especially when more often than not, it would interfere with his work. However, he knew Hizashi would be cross with him if he encouraged this sort of behavior in Izuku, not when his husband thrived on attention, especially with all eyes on him, and wanted Izuku to become more social, like him.)

Even though Izuku attended U.A., he still rarely interacted with the rest of the student body. He knew this from both Izuku himself and from Nedzu’s progress reports.

Izuku had a fair amount of control over his own schedule, choosing to come in later than the other students, just so he could avoid coming in at the same time as everyone else. Same went for lunch, which he generally spent with Nedzu in his hidden office-space.

(Shouta also suspected that Izuku liked to get in that bit of extra sleep, which was admirable. A child after his own heart.)

And while Shouta could respect that, he knew that sooner or later, Izuku would need to face this issue head on. If anything, getting Izuku acclimated towards or at least neutral towards this sort of general attention would only help him not freeze up in a similar situation later on.

It was even more quiet now.

He didn’t even know teenagers could manage to stay quiet for so long.

The teenagers that he would catch in the streets at night were always causing a ruckus, on the verge of or already knee-deep in something illegal. And the ones he would see on his excursions out during the day weren’t much better, though at least these usually were more law-abiding, albeit just as vocal as their night counterparts.

Shouta could feel Izuku rearrange his arm around his shoulder, dipping his face into the crook of his neck before breathing in and then out again.

It took only a second before Izuku seemed to strengthen his resolve and turned, finally offering a shy wave to Nedzu, the mumble coming out from his mouth only vaguely sounding like a ‘hi’.

Some of the students closest to them immediately cooed to each other, giggles erupting among them.

The grip on his shoulders tightened minutely.

“Don’t let us keep you, sensei,” He ran the palm of his hand down Izuku’s back, hoping to distract him enough for him to get them away and on their way to Shuuzenji-sensei’s infirmary, offering a small bow, “We’ll see you later.”

And with that, he quickly made his way through the front entrance, careful not to jostle Izuku too much.

He could feel Izuku’s body slowly loosen up as they got further and further away from the school’s entrance, his grip also loosening in turn.

Izuku bumped the side of his face against his, the low hooting sound he made showing his gratitude.

Shouta slowed his stride as he started down the hallway that would take them to the infirmary. It was irrational, but he could never forget that one time Nedzu had revealed himself to him upside-down from a ceiling vent, warning him not to run down hallways. He would really rather not take the chance that would happen again, this time with Izuku there to witness it.

There were still a few students in this area, but it was nowhere as stifling as the group of students by the school’s entrance.

Already seeming much more at ease, Izuku even started to lowly hum as he peered at the students as they walked passed, his eyes shining.

Izuku did love quirks, so it was only logical that he took interest in the quirks of the students that had managed to make it into a top hero school like U.A.

Shouta was just glad he was feeling better.

Chapter Text

Izuku loved quirks.

He didn't recall a time where he didn't

Even though he hadn’t had one of his own, at least before manifesting Owl, it hadn’t changed his love for them at all.

His earliest memory was watching his Mama fetch her keys from where she had left them on the kitchen table. They had gently floated into her hand as she absentmindedly beckoned for them; and all the while, she had barely even paid attention to what she had done.

For her, it had been the usual.

For him, it had been life-changing.

It was all well and good when he got to watch them in action on the television, but nothing could beat seeing their usage in person.

And because U.A. was a school that had a very good reputation for their heroics course, (and everything else as well, his Dad said), there were always interesting quirks around.

He only needed to take a look out of the windows in Nedzu-san’s secret room to watch the hero students doing their stretches in the training field and then pair off for spars under the watchful eyes of Snipe.

It wasn't often he got to watch them from there, but he enjoyed it when he could, always asking Nedzu-san for a small break from lessons when he noticed them start with their spars.

(Nedzu-san must have scheduled their breaks around the usual time that the hero students would have their classes outside too, knowing that he enjoyed watching them. It couldn't be a coincidence that their classes always happened at the same time as break time, right? It was so nice of him.)

It was one of the best things about U.A.; there were quirks everywhere.

And this time, Izuku had an even greater place to watch from as well.

His Dad was taller than most of the students they walked past, (but not as far from the students compared to Nedzu-san’s office), so from where he was in his arms, he didn't have to worry about missing anything.

He saw a student with antlers and small fangs and another with a bowl around their head, bubbles visible as they breathed under water.

His mind raced, torn between trying to figure out what sort of quirk that could be and just gushing to his Dad about how cool it was.

But in the end, he decided against sharing his thoughts, even though he really wanted to.

He just didn't want to risk the students hearing him and what if they had really good hearing like he did? They would probably think he was weird or annoying, or even both at the same time!

(Though at the same time, his Dad did always say not to "put too much stock into what others say." That meant that he shouldn't put too much confidence or faith into what others say, since they didn't know him or anything about him. His Dad had to deal with things like that a lot with his job, and so did his Papa.)

And they were getting pretty close to Shuuzenji-san’s office anyway, so it didn’t matter.

It was just around the next corner and a few more doors down.

Izuku knew the route to Shuuzenji-san's office by heart.

(Well, he was theo-re-ti-cal-ly pretty good with getting around U.A. in general. Nedzu-san had taken him on a tour on his first day of class with him when the school was mostly empty, showing him around and where all the emergency entrances and exits were. He had gotten a quiz on everything later, needing to point out locations on a map of U.A. Nedzu-san had been very pleased with how he had done.)

His Dad held him a bit tighter as they got nearer, and Izuku could only wonder about what was on his mind.

Was he worried about something?

He hadn’t done anything so far yet, so he couldn’t be sure if it was him causing it this time.

His Dad didn’t say anything to the questioning hum he made, so he decided it must not have been that important. If it had been important, he knew his Dad would have told him.

Maybe his Dad was worried about seeing Shuuzenji-san?

Izuku could understand that.

Doctors were still kinda scary, especially if they might give you bad news.

But he was also sure that this visit wouldn’t go that way and that his Dad must just be overly paranoid.

He reached up to pat his Dad’s face, ignoring the confused look sent to him.

“It’s gonna be okay.”

His Dad chuckled at his words, gaze warm, his scruff tickling his palm.

“Alright.”

Before they knew it, they had arrived at the door of Shuuzenji-san’s office.

There were voices that he could hear coming from inside.

One was the expected Shuuzenji-san, but one was one he hadn't heard before.

It made him a bit nervous, but he also knew that homeroom were supposed to start soon for all the other students, so if they were either a student or teacher, they would need to leave for their classroom in order to not be late.

His Dad knocked on the door once before opening it and stepping in.

"Ah, Aizawa, Izuku-kun," Shuuzenji-san greeted them with a small smile, "I'll be right with you two, alright?"

He nodded, more than happy to stay in his Dad's arms for just a bit longer.

The student she was with glanced over at them, gaze curious.

Izuku looked over at him as well, eyes roaming over the bandages that were wrapped over his forearms.

Was he hurt?

“Now, Todoroki-kun,” Shuuzenji-san tutted, handing him a peppermint, “You really must be more careful when using your quirk.” She waved him off, “I do not want to see you back in here for another week, do you hear me?”

“See you next week, Recovery Girl-sensei,” The student, Todoroki-san, gave her a short bow before shoving the candy into his mouth, “I’ll tell Power Loader-sensei you said ‘hi.’”

Just what sort of quirk did he have for him to get hurt by it so often?

A quirk that could hurt yourself.. That didn’t sound like a fun quirk to use.

“I didn’t know that babies attended U.A. as well,” Todoroki-san’s eyes had barely concealed amusement in them, though Izuku could see it wasn’t the mean kind, like Kacchan’s eyes had; he breezed past them, “Well, see ya, kid.”

Izuku could feel himself puff up even as the door closed behind him.

He wasn’t a baby!

“Aizawa, Izuku-kun,” Shuuzenji-san finally turned her full attention to them, placing down the folder she had been scribbling into aside, “I’m ready for you now.”

His Dad carried him to where she was seated, placing him down on the chair by her desk, sitting down next to him.

“I heard about the situation yesterday, Izuku-kun,” She spoke delicately, “While I am glad you came out of the situation relatively unscathed, Kayama did get injured.” He winced hearing this, “You must always be aware and sure that who you are attacking is actually a threat.”

That was right.

Izuku knew that.

His talons were sharp and his Dad did mention that he had sent Kayama-san to the infirmary later.

He would need to apologize to Kayama-san.

Eventually.

“Now, the reason for your visit,” Shuuzenji-san switched to her nurse voice, “Show me your leg, dear.”

And Izuku did.

The visit went fast.

Izuku had never felt the effects of Shuuzenji-san’s Heal, but it made him feel a bit tired.

His Dad had explained that it was just how her quirk worked, that Heal took the energy of the injured person to heal them.

It sounded like a very helpful quirk.

(Though Todoroki-san from before must feel sleepy all the time then.)

But now he was allowed to walk on his own again, so that was nice.

His leg didn’t hurt at all anymore either!

“Thank you, Shuuzenji-san!” He bowed, “I’ll be more careful next time too!”

“Good,” She responded, handing him a watermelon candy, “Now off with you!”

His Dad gave her a short bow and nod before reaching down for his hand, leading him out of the infirmary.

There were no students nearby, so classes must have started up already.

It was back to Nedzu-san’s now.

His Dad followed behind him as he skipped, enjoying being on his own feet again.

(He did love being carried, but he did like being able to go places on his own. And he didn’t want his Dad’s arms to get tired.)

Nedzu-san’s office was close though so they arrived quickly, the door opening for them before they could even knock.

“Nedzu-san!” He exclaimed, hand waving, “Hi again!”

“And hello to you again as well, Izuku-kun,” Nedzu-san’s eyes crinkled, “Was your visit with Recovery Girl satisfactory?”

“I think so,” Izuku knew the satisfactory meant ‘okay’ and he was relatively certain he hadn’t failed his visit, “My leg doesn’t hurt anymore now, see?”

He stomped his foot a few times, though he could hear his Dad sigh at the display.

It was fine though!

All better!

“But! But, but, but!” Izuku ran across the room so that he could stand next to Nedzu-san’s desk, “Look, Nedzu-san!” He quickly spun, flaring his wings open, holding out his hands in front of him as well to show off his talons, “It’s my quirk!”

“And what a wonderful quirk it is, Izuku-kun!” Nedzu-san clapped his paws together, "I did hear from Aizawa-kun how you managed to take your quirk in a new direction the other night."

“I can even smell like this!” He chirped happily, “I can smell and taste!”

“Do things taste or smell different while you are like this?” Nedzu-san’s eyes sparkled in interest, “Why, this is fascinating!”

“Um,” Izuku paused to think, “I don’t think so. But it’s nice to still be able to taste things ‘cause I like tasting things.”

“Are you able to hold a sustained flight?”

“Uh, I haven’t tried flying yet,” He had wanted to last night, but his Papa wouldn’t let him try, “Maybe later?”

“Perhaps,” Nedzu-san hummed, “Though I do think you should take a day to rest up first. Recovery Girl’s quirk does take a bit out of you.”

“Exactly,” His Dad agreed, “Not today.”

He sighed, knowing that with both of them agreeing with each other, there was no way he’d get to try to test out his wings.

And he had lessons soon too! Who even knew how much he had missed out on learning yesterday when he had been napping!

However, lessons meant using pencils and erasers.

Izuku was alright with chopsticks, able to maneuver them well enough with his fingers tipped in claws, but pencils? He would be able to hold them, but there was no way he was going to be able to write anything anyone could read.

This meant that it was time.

“Dad?” He was still reluctant to acknowledge this, but it had to be done for the sake of school, “Erasure?”

His Dad only nodded, eyes flaring red with the use of his quirk, his hair rising above his head.

The feeling of Erasure was something he was slowly getting used to, but it always felt weird to abruptly lose everything he quirk offered him. Even the small screeches in the back of his head that urged him to perch on top of things quieted down in the face of Erasure.

It was instantaneous though, giving him no extra time to mull on it before it was over.

Izuku rocked on his heels, suddenly unsteady on his feet. Thankfully his Dad was as quick as ever, one of his hands already propping him up and allowing him to get used to standing without balancing the weight of his wings.

“Whoa there, Izuku,” His Dad murmured, his touch gentle, “Falling is not in today’s plans.”

He nodded, not exactly wanting that for himself either.

The last thing he needed to do was worry his Dad again right after making him worry so much yesterday already.

“I’ll be okay,” He promised, carefully taking a step to make sure he would stay upright. It wasn’t as if he spent long with wings, but having to readjust again after he had finally gotten used to going around with his wings was harder than he had thought. He kept leaning forward, thinking he still needed to balance the weight so he wouldn’t fall. But with no wings, it just made him tip forward with nothing to balance it out, “I won’t even leave the classroom today. No matter what.”

“It won’t matter either way,” His Dad spoke firmly, giving no room for argument, “I’ll be staying here at the school until you’re dismissed and then we can head home together.”

He was?

Izuku didn't know that.

Was that the reason why his Dad had packed so many onigiri into his bag this morning?

It was way more than he would eat for a meal, so some had to be his Dad’s portion as well. And this way, they didn’t even need to go to Lunch Rush’s cafeteria to get lunch!

But with his Dad staying here instead of heading back home, that also meant that he probably wouldn’t be getting in his late morning nap.

He felt kind of awful, knowing he was costing his Dad his precious nap.

“Are you sure you wanna stay, Dad?” Izuku asked, ignoring the relief that also ran through him knowing that his Dad would be nearby, “I don’t want you to waste your time waiting for me to finish school.”

“I brought my paperwork along,” His Dad patted his messenger bag, “Believe me, I won’t be wasting any time while I’m here.”

“And should you finish early, Aizawa-kun,” Nedzu-san piped up with a grin, “I’m sure any of the staff here would appreciate an extra pair of hands, or eyes, for that matter!”

“Sure, I guess,” With a shrug of his shoulders, his Dad agreed, “I don’t think I’d be much of a help with math or literature, but I could provide a decent sparring partner for the hero students.”

“Why, that does sound like a marvelous idea!” Izuku noted Nedzu-san’s pleased expression, “I’m sure Snipe would be glad to introduce you to his first year heroics class today!”

“First years?” His Dad suddenly looked a lot more tired, “Basics then.” He sighed, “Then again, mastering the basics is essential if you want to have a good foundation to build up on for later skills.”

He nodded, knowing his Dad was correct.

It was the same in gymnastics.

You had to learn all the basics first and master them if you wanted to eventually learn more complicated techniques. Everything that came later depended on the basics you learned at the very beginning.

“Alright, I’ll be in the faculty room if you need me,” Izuku nodded and waved ‘goodbye’ to him, glad his Dad was close by if he did need to run out to get him, “I’ll knock when it’s time for lunch.”

His Dad then gave him a small smile and a pat on the head, leaving and closing the office door behind him.

Without the presence of his Dad there by his side, his mood immediately sombered up.

His Dad already worried so much about him, he really didn't want to make him worry anymore than he had to.

It was just something he expected by now.

His Mama had loved him, but she had also worried so much about him. About what he would be able to do without a quirk, about what he could even do when he grew up all big, and lots of other things that only adults thought about really.

And now his Dad and Papa as well.

He knew that they loved him.

The hugs and smiles that they gave him were impossible to fake.

That was why he did his best to keep himself from feeling bad around them. Because there had to be some limit to how much worry they could take and Izuku didn’t want to find out where that invisible line was, ever.

"Izuku-kun?"

He looked up at the sound of his name to see that Nedzu-san had gotten out of his chair.

(He missed his owl senses already. How had he not noticed this?)

Guilt wracked him, recognizing the tell-tale signs of worry visible in Nedzu-san's eyes.

"I'm sorry!" The apology burst out of him, the loudness of it startling the both of them, Nedzu-san’s ears twitching as his tail lashed out behind him. He lowered his volume, feeling even worse now, "I'm sorry, Nedzu-san."

The silence following his outburst was daunting.

Nedzu-san was usually so quick to respond to him in class, so to hear him without an immediate response, it made him feel like he had done it.

That he had really messed up the first new friendship he had made in years.

 

But it was fair, wasn’t it?

Izuku had been the one to fail at protecting him and because of it, had wasted Nedzu-san’s precious time that he took out of his day to even teach him.

If Midnight had been a villain, Nedzu-san might have gotten injured or even died.

(He didn’t even know if Nedzu-sans went to the same place where humans went after they died!)

“Izuku-kun,” Nedzu-san’s paw touched the back of his hand, gently knocking him out of his thoughts, “I must admit, I am not quite sure what you are apologizing for.” He paused, a rare uncertain look crossing his face as he continued, “If anything, I should be the one offering you an apology.”

What?

That was absurd!

“But you didn’t do anything!”

It was all him.

Nedzu-san didn’t do a thing that he should be apologizing for.

“And therein lies the issue,” Nedzu-san still sounded composed, if a bit troubled as he continued to speak, “I was the one responsible for your safety while you are here, and yet, the events of yesterday afternoon still occurred.” A small sigh left him, “I was unable to do a thing and because of that, you were injured.”

Was that what Nedzu-san wanted to apologize for?

But it wasn’t his fault.

“I am sorry, Izuku-kun,” Nedzu-san’s voice was soft and genuine and Izuku wanted to cry, “You must have been scared.”

Scared?

He supposed so.

In that moment when Nedzu-san had collapsed, he had certainly felt scared, not knowing what had happened to his friend.

But he had felt more angry than anything else.

“You are my friend,” His voice grew even softer, “And while it may be selfish of me to admit this, I do not like to see my friends hurt.” Nedzu-san’s paw clasped his own hand, “I will do better next time.”

This was wrong.

“But it wasn’t your fault,” Izuku couldn’t stop the small sob that broke out of him, “I was the one that failed to protect you!”

Nedzu-san looked surprised, his eyes widening just a fraction before they returned to their usual contemplative selves.

“I couldn’t stop Midnight,” All the things that he had built up guilt about just kept falling out of his mouth, “Then I got myself thrown out a window!” He didn’t want to admit it to anyone, but he wasn’t looking forward to eventually seeing Kayama-san again, “And then I took a nap and missed school and forgot about my dads and made everyone worry for hours about me!”

He dashed the back of his hand to wipe away at the tears that escaped, his upset feelings overwhelming him.

Izuku just felt bad.

“While I am touched to know that you wanted to protect me,” Nedzu-san offered him a small smile as he gently squeezed his hand with a paw, “I hope you know that it was not your responsibility to.”

“But—!”

“No, Izuku-kun,” Nedzu-san’s voice was firm, “There is no situation in the world where a child should be expected to protect an adult.” It softened a degree, “I apologize for placing that burden on you as well.”

And with that, Izuku broke.

He cried.

To his surprise, Nedzu-san didn’t move away, reaching up to pat at his head instead.

“Research shows that crying is a good form of emotional release,” Nedzu-san murmured, “The world continues to move on even as disaster strikes. It is just the nature of the society we live in.” The paw stroking down his hair was gentle and Izuku found himself ducking his head down lower even as his breath lurched, tears dripping down into soft fur, “But despite that, the time that we take for ourselves should never be taken for granted.”

Izuku had no idea what Nedzu-san was even talking about, but he was good at reading tones and from what he could hear over his own cries, kindness was one that rang true.

Nedzu-san was such a kind person.

“You may cry, Izuku-kun.”

 

“This time, I will protect you.”

Notes:

    Nedzu > I've done some research on human children crying-
    Recovery Girl > You can just comfort Izuku with a hug.
    Nedzu > Hugs?
    Nedzu > Allow me to read up on the effects of hugs on human children.
    Recovery Girl > （´＿｀;）

    Izuku is back to being his wingless self, but hey, taking notes in school is pretty important to him! He's never going to forget that pop quiz on his first day!

    Shouta did finish his paperwork early and worked with the first years. Snipe was pretty impressed!

    Nedzu felt pretty bad about the whole thing.. Both he and Izuku are still learning about the nuances of friendship and how to navigate it.

Chapter Text

Today was a Saturday.

Hizashi liked Saturdays quite a bit.

Of course, work as a pro hero couldn't be put on a strict schedule, but his weekends were generally more free in the mornings, much to his relief.

This meant he could take Izuku to school and then do some grocery shopping on the way back. It was a good use of his time, especially if he got those fancy chocolate- covered coffee beans that Shouta liked so much.

(Those were always hidden so Izuku didn't accidentally eat them thinking they were his snacks.)

He didn't have his patrol until the afternoon, giving him time to relax at home, or in this specific case, take Izuku to the park for his weekly playdate.

Situating himself under a tree by the security gate, he waited, knowing that Izuku had an early dismissal today.

It didn't take long for him to see Izuku exit the school, the door opened for him by Snipe.

He had never worked together with that particular pro hero in question, but he seemed to be another person that Izuku seemed enthusiastic to be chatting with, which was always a good thing.

"'Zuku!" He waved as Izuku neared him, Snipe still by his side, "Guess who!”

“Papa!” Izuku perked up, his gaze zeroing in on his location; he was ridiculously good at that kind of stuff even without his quirk active, “You came to pick me up?”

“Yeah!”

He lowered himself into a crouch so Izuku could give him a proper hug instead of just settling for his legs. And as he expected, Izuku dove into him, throwing his arms around his shoulders. Taking the moment to relish that yes, his son was in his arms safe for another day, Hizashi let out a happy hum.

“You’re gonna bring me to the park right, Papa?” Izuku mumbled into his neck, “Tenya said he’d come today.”

“You got that right!” And oh, if he wasn't vaguely jealous that Tensei’s baby brother, of all people, got to meet Izuku's cat food-eating friend before he or Shouta did; he was so curious about what sort of kid Izuku could have befriended on his own! “Are you ready to go?”

“Mhm,” Nodding his head, Izuku then let go of him, turning to wave at Snipe, who hadn’t left yet, “Bye, Snipe-san! See you next week!”

“See ya, Izuku,” Snipe tipped his hat in their direction, to both him and to Izuku, “Now ya stay out of trouble, ya hear?”

Izuku nodded again and while Snipe seemed satisfied with that, Hizashi knew that Izuku was just saying so to placate him.

He did not want to know how the rest of the faculty had reacted when they had found out.

(Izuku only really talked about Ectoplasm and Snipe at home, Nedzu being a given, but he spoke fondly enough of them that he felt comfortable leaving Izuku in their care at U.A. It wasn’t as if he was close enough to U.A. to be able to pop in to check on Izuku when he had a short break at the station.)

“Thank you for watching over Izuku, Snipe,” He gave him a quick nod, holding his hand out for Izuku to take; a small hand grabbed his fingers, tugging him away from under the tree, “It’s appreciated.”

“Aw, shucks, Yamada,” Huh, why did he know his name? Did Izuku talk about him to other people? Or did Nedzu mention his name in passing? “Izuku’s a good kid, so it’s no problem.”

He could see Izuku beam from the corner of his eye, clearly still listening to their conversation even as he made progress in pulling him away from the trunk he had been leaning against.

So precious!

“He really is a sweetheart, right?” He eagerly agreed, “You wanna see some photos of him I have on me?”

“Oh?” Snipe stepped closer, clearly interested, “Don’t mind if I do.”

In a flash, he had them out, the wallet-sized photos being one of his own little treasures he kept on him at all times.

(The little fake lemon that Izuku had given him was one as well. He had drilled in a small hole and threaded a length of orange string through it, crafting a cute charm for his phone. His reply to his coworkers at the station who had noticed his newest trinket? He just liked lemons!)

Hizashi could hear Izuku protest weakly, but he had been looking forward to sharing his cute photos of Izuku for a while now, and Snipe just happened to be someone that knew about Izuku’s quirk and had the luck to be in the area when he offered.

(He would need to find some other time to share them with Tensei. Shouta had taken the initiative with informing Tensei about Izuku’s quirk, sending him the photo of owl-Izuku with a knife, complete with a message of ‘this is Izuku.’ It was pretty straightforward if you asked him. Tensei called them in a panic though, demanding the reason why they thought it was a good idea to arm children with knives. It had taken a few minutes of placating, but in the end, things had gotten straightened out. All in time for Izuku to ask to talk to Tenya on the phone regarding a playdate.)

“This is Izuku napping on the couch,” Oh, some of these were from months ago, back when Izuku had just started living with them, “And this one is Izuku trying to eat a senbei as big as his head!”

“Izuku with uh, Real Mick.”

“Izuku with the biggest lemon in the neighborhood!”

“Izuku watering the garden!”

It went on for a few minutes, but his excitement never died down.

He was just happy to just share cute photos of his son.

"This one is Izuku falling asleep at breakfast," That one was a particular favorite of his; it was when Izuku was napping that he looked most at peace, none of that worry that was always so well-hidden in the lines of his body, "Oh, and this one is Izuku and his Nedzu-san!”

“Cute,” Snipe agreed with a chuckle, “Glad ta see that the principal did think of a nice present for him besides ya know, the whole wrecking ball thing.”

“Ha, right,” Grimacing, he remembered the horror that had washed upon him when Izuku had mentioned it over dinner that one night, “The whole wrecking ball thing.”

There was a moment of silence between the two of them, the only sound being Izuku grunting as he tried to pull at his leg some more.

He absentmindedly patted Izuku’s head as he finally arrived at the last photo he wanted to share.

“And this is Izuku trying to do a handstand,” Grinning proudly, he pointed at his newest acquisition that featured Izuku doing a handstand against their wall and Shouta holding onto his hips so that there wasn’t any danger of falling, “He’s learning how to do them now! Look at him go!”

“He’ll be flipping around just like Aizawa before ya know it,” Snipe nodded, “You two must be proud.”

“There’s no one we’re more proud of!”

“Papa!” Izuku was now clutching at his arm, “We gotta go! Tenya’s waiting!” He added in a lower grumble, “Tenya doesn’t like it when people are late.”

Oh, his heart!

“Yeah, we’re going, ‘Zuku!” He carefully folded the photos back into his wallet before pulling out his phone to open the gallery there, “Just another second, yeah?”

He could feel Izuku’s stare boring into his head, but there were some cute photos on his phone that he hadn’t had the chance to get printed out yet, so he would just have to withstand Izuku’s disapproval and Tenya’s lecturing later.

“Snipe-san!” Izuku piped up, switching targets, “On my Papa’s birthday, we went to the park together and guess what we saw there?”

He wouldn’t, would he?

“What did you guys see?” Snipe replied, head tilted conveying his curiosity, “Something interesting?”

“We saw a fu-”

Nope.

“Actually, we gotta go!” Hizashi cut Izuku off as quickly as he could, speaking over the ‘-cking bug’ he could see Izuku say, “We’re running late!”

“Wait,” Snipe called after them even as Hizashi ushered Izuku away down the path, “What did you see?”

“A fu-”

“Bye, Snipe!” He resisted the urge to just pick Izuku up and start sprinting away, “Say bye, Izuku!”

Izuku met his eyes.

Hizashi gave him a weak grin.

To his relief, Izuku then nodded and then turned to wave at Snipe.

“Bye, Snipe-san!”

“Right,” He still sounded confused, but that was fine by him; Hizashi didn’t need more people than necessary to know about that moment at the park, “See ya, Yamada, Izuku. Stay safe.”

Speed-walking with Izuku next to him, he made sure they were a good distance away before slowing back down.

He didn’t think Snipe would chase after them for answers, but he didn’t want to leave anything to chance.

Izuku did look fairly satisfied with himself.

His understanding of social situations must have improved quite a bit if he had realized that bringing up that incident would have gotten him what he had wanted.

Well, this had been what he and Shouta had wanted for him, though he really could have done with less of it being at his expense.

They walked in silence for a few minutes, but he had always been more of a talker if given the opportunity.

And this was the perfect opportunity to see if Izuku was doing alright after his appointment today.

"How're you doing, 'Zuku?" He asked as they continued their stroll down the hill that U.A. was situated on, noting how Izuku seemed to attach himself to his side as he spoke, “You look a bit tired.”

Therapy was exhausting on the best of days.

That was an indisputable fact.

“I’m not tired,” Izuku huffed, “I’m fine!”

Well, Izuku sure sounded fine, but from the way he was leaning against him as they walked, he thought otherwise.

Perhaps it would be better if they postponed this playdate until tomorrow?

He had really underestimated how much this would affect Izuku.

Both he and Shouta had bi-monthly appointments with their own therapists, though it might go monthly and even weekly if they had recently been on some shitty mission where things had gone fucked up beyond belief. Needless to say, they were both very familiar with the aftereffects of therapy.

"Did you like Hound Dog though?" He felt like was hounding Izuku for answers at this point, hah, but if Hound Dog didn't work out, they could start the search for a therapist more suited for Izuku. Hound Dog did work at a school that catered to teenagers almost exclusively, so it wouldn't be surprising if he and Izuku didn't mesh well, "Do you want to continue seeing him?"

"I like Inui-san," Izuku replied after a moment of thought, "He let me pet his head when I asked him if I could."

Hizashi supposed that was one way to gain Izuku's favor, though he still had no idea about if they were compatible at all.

"I dunno if Inui-san can help me with things yet," He then continued, "But it's his job to try, right?"

"It is," Hizashi agreed, "But you let me or Shouta know if it feels like your needs aren't being met, okay?"

"Okay," Izuku gave him a short nod, "I will."

"I'm holding you to that," He teased in an attempt to loosen up the suddenly stifling atmosphere, "Shouta and I only want the best for you, yeah?"

"Yeah."

And though Izuku's reply was short, Hizashi could practically see the thoughts swirling about behind Izuku's eyes.

Had he said something odd?

They continued to walk, the quiet occasionally punctuated by Izuku pointing out the squirrels leaping from branch to branch and wiggling of bushes that Izuku insisted was probably made by a snack-like critter.

(Hizashi had a feeling that if they weren’t holding hands, he would have lost Izuku to the bushes.)

It didn't take very long for them to reach the park that Izuku preferred for his playdates.

The walk was refreshing, the air fresh.

While he much preferred the cityscape compared to more woodsy areas, this wasn’t half bad.

Not at all.

Today was Saturday!

It wasn't like his usual Saturdays where he had school and then spent some time at the park with Hitoshi, though he did like those Saturdays a lot.

This Saturday was special.

Today was the day where he was going to introduce Tenya and Hitoshi to each other.

Usually Nedzu-san would bring him to the park after his morning lessons, but today, not only were his afternoon lessons already canceled, he had also been excused early due to having to go see Inui-san.

Izuku could only feel relieved that it was over.

He had agreed to his Papa's request to go to therapy yeah, but who wouldn't? It wasn't as if he liked having nightmares that kept him up all the time and then got him scolded by his Dad who thought he was doing it on purpose.

(The idea of telling his parents was more tempting than ever, but it would only be something they worried about, he was sure. And the nightmares had to go away on their own eventually, right?)

His Dad had mentioned having a meeting with the Hat Man today, so maybe it had something to do with Hisashi? If he was stopped or captured, then that would be it.

He really would like it if the nightmares stopped sooner rather than later.

“Yo, Tensei!” He heard his Papa greet, “And little Tenya too!”

“Tenya!”

He waved in greeting, hollering out his name.

“Izuku-kun!”

Tenya yelled back, enthusiasm clear in his voice.

“Papa,” He patted his Papa’s arm to get his attention since he was already chatting with Iida-san, “I’m gonna go play with Tenya and my other friend now.” His Papa nodded, giving him a small nod showing that he heard him, “Are you gonna come pick me up later?”

“I’ll be at work by then, but Shouta’s gonna come to get you, okay?” His Papa looked a bit sad; was it because he wouldn’t be able to come back to the park later? “Stay with Tensei until Shouta gets here, yeah?”

“Mhm, yeah,” Izuku nodded as his brain scrambled to think of a way to make his Papa happy again; he liked it best when his Papa was happy. What did his Papa like besides croissants, lemons, and bug spray? “Uh, would you like one for the road?”

“One for the road…?” His Papa echoed, his confusion even reflecting off his glasses before it cleared up with a hint of joy, sadness now gone, “Oh! Yes, I would!”

He tugged down at his Papa, his Papa lowering himself down into a crouch to oblige him.

“Here you go, Papa,” Dropping a kiss onto his Papa’s cheek, he giggled as his mustache quivered, holding in giggles, “One for the road.”

“Oh, ‘Zuku!” His Papa exclaimed, “I love you too!”

He sprang back up onto his feet, grin back on his face.

“I’ve gotta go now, but I’ll see you tonight when I get back, yeah?”

Izuku nodded.

He was just glad that his Papa didn’t look sad anymore.

“Bye, Papa!”

And with that, his Papa left, heading further down the road in the direction back to where Izuku knew his radio station was located.

“So, Izuku-kun,” Iida-san greeted him with a kind smile, “I hear you and Tenya are gonna play with another friend of yours?”

“Yeah, he likes to eat cat food,” Izuku immediately replied, defaulting back to what he had already told his parents, “And you can’t follow us.”

“Uh,” Iida-san blinked down at him, “May I ask why not?”

“My friend doesn’t really like other people,” It was more complicated than that, but Izuku didn’t want to share things that he didn’t know that Hitoshi was comfortable with other people knowing, “So you can’t follow us.”

“I thought we agreed that I was going to be here to watch over you guys?” Raising an eyebrow, Iida-san tutted, “Your Dad wanted someone responsible, you know.”

“Tenya’s super responsible,” Izuku pointed out; it was true too! Tenya was always making sure he was hydrated once he had learned that owls mostly got their water from the prey they ate, ”And we’ll stay in the same area and call you if anything happens.”

Nedzu-san had taught him about this.

It was called give-and-take, or com-pro-mise.

Iida-san still looked uneasy, so he decided to push once more.

“We won’t even roll in the dirt this time!”

And just like that, Iida-san sighed and nodded.

“Alright, you rascals,” He pointed at one of the benches by the fountain, “I’ll be there the entire time.” His finger then pointed at him and then at Tenya, firm and unyielding, “I hear anything weird, I’m coming right over.”

“Promise!”

“Promise.”

They both agreed quickly, and once Iida-san started walking in the direction of his bench, he took Tenya’s hand and tugged him in the opposite direction, knowing the way to the clearing that he and Hitoshi always met by heart.

Once he was sure that Tenya was following where he was going, he let go, slowing down his walk as well.

“Izuku-kun?” Tenya asked as they started walking out of the play area, “Do you really think this is a good idea? You said your friend doesn’t like people.” He sighed, “I’m a people.”

He blinked.

Well, Tenya was a car.

That made all the difference!

And it was fine because he had asked Hitoshi last week about this and Hitoshi said he was willing to try, though it was only because Tenya was already his friend.

"I think he’ll like you, Tenya," He hummed, not seeing any reason that his two friends wouldn't get along; they both liked him, so why wouldn't they like each other as well? "You’re both nice."

Tenya did not look very enthusiastic despite his words.

"Are you quite sure, Izuku-kun?" He had a small frown on his face, "From what you have said about him, your friend seems a bit.. odd."

Izuku supposed that Tenya thinking Hitoshi actually did eat cat food was his fault, but the part where Tenya didn't even question what came out of his mouth was definitely not.

And it wasn't as if Tenya had an excuse to call anyone odd. Not when he ran on orange juice.

"I'm sure," He chirped, a spring in his step, "And it’ll be nice to play games that need more than two people, you know?”

“I suppose it would be nice to play owls and cars with another person to chase down,” Tenya agreed, “I’ll do my best then, Izuku-kun. I’d like to be friends with your friend too.”

This was gonna be great!

Izuku just knew it!

As soon as they reached the clearing, Izuku waved gleefully at Hitoshi who waved back at him with a small smile.

“Hitoshi!” He tugged Tenya into the clearing with him, “I’m here and I brought Tenya!”

“Hey, Izuku,” Hitoshi greeted him softly, guarded eyes looking over Tenya, “Yo, Izuku’s other friend.”

Izuku could see Tenya frowning.

“My name is Iida Tenya,” He bristled, a bit like Hound Dog when he was on patrol around the school, “Not ‘Izuku-kun’s other friend'.”

“Huh,” Hitoshi murmured, “Well, if you say so.”

This was not good.

Izuku could feel the tension around them and they weren’t even looking at him!

Had he been wrong in thinking this was a good idea?


Notes:

    Izuku > We don't need babysitters. You can just bring Tenya.
    Tensei > Well, you need someone to watch over you.
    Izuku > Tenya can watch over me!
    Tensei > And I can watch over Tenya?
    Izuku > ヽ(￣～￣ )ノ I guess?

    Izuku did have his first therapy session and it went alright enough. As well as it could have gone!

    Hizashi has unleashed his arsenal of photos and Snipe was seriously impressed xD

    And Izuku has finally managed to get his two friends (his age) to meet! Ah, first impressions..

    Please let me know your thoughts! And thank you guys so so much for the comments; I read every single one of them and they keep me going throughout the week!

Chapter Text

There was tension.

So much of it.

Izuku knew tension wasn't a good thing when it came to making friends.

(It reminded him too much of Kacchan and how on those super rare occasions he would get quiet. Quiet Kacchan was the meanest and worst Kacchan.)

"Sit."

He sat down immediately following his own instructions, knocking shoulders with Hitoshi. Nedzu-san always said that it was important to provide good examples.

However Tenya stared down at them, looking down at the grass and then at his white shorts, uncertainty crossing his face.

"You told my brother that we wouldn't be rolling in the dirt today, Izuku-kun."

"Sitting on the grass isn't the same, Tenya," He reassured him, ignoring Hitoshi's raised eyebrows, "It'll be fine!"

Tenya sighed at him, but much to his delight still sat down. Now they were all on the same level!

(He could see Hitoshi visibly relax with Tenya no longer looming over the two of them. That was good.)

"Okay!" He chirped, doing his best to be upbeat; his Papa always said that happiness was contagious. Tenya and Hitoshi could really use some of that right now, "You two should introduce yourselves to each other now."

A second passed.

Two seconds.

Three.

Right.

"I'll start," He could absolutely lead by example here, "I'm Aizawa Izuku and I'm eight years old." What else did he say? "And I, um, I've never eaten a bee before?"

"What?!"

“What?”

Izuku ignored both his friend’s exclamations.

(Why were they even so surprised? Or at least Hitoshi looked surprised. Tenya just looked horrified.)

“You’re next, Hitoshi!” He urged with a small nudge to his shoulder, "It doesn't have to be anything complicated."

Narrowed eyes looked down at him before softening.

"Alright, Izuku," Hitoshi agreed before turning to Tenya, face curiously blank, "I'm Fukukado Hitoshi. Also eight years old." He paused, eyes glancing over at where Tenya was sitting properly next to him, "And I didn't wear the worst colors for playing at the park today."

Tenya sputtered, flush crawling up his face.

"These! These are good clothes!" His hand shot out, chopping, "Perfectly suitable for the park!"

Izuku couldn't argue with Hitoshi's statement. Tenya's preference for light blues and whites was a real hazard when they played outside together. One wrong step could lead to big messes, which Iida-san really did not like.

(And it wasn't even that they rolled in the dirt exactly that one time. Tenya had tripped over a rock and into some fertilizer and since he was the one chasing at that time, he had ended up tripping right over Tenya and into the same stuff, unable to stop in time. Iida-san had not been happy when he had seen the two of them trying to sneak back into the house to get clean, especially since he had just mopped the floor.)

“Perfectly suitable if you plan on just sitting on a bench and watching us play together, maybe,” Hitoshi retorted, “Nobody wears white to the park if they’re planning on actually doing things.”

“Hitoshi!” Izuku interrupted, “We came to play at the park together, okay?” He spared a glance at Tenya’s clothes, imagining the grass stains already on the butt of the pants, “Tenya can get dirty if he wants to.”

"Indeed!" Tenya continued, "I've gotten very dirty before, I can assure you, Fukukado-kun!"

"Tenya," Shoving himself in between his two friends was not what he wanted to do today, but it was way better than just allowing Hitoshi to prod at a defensive Tenya, "Introduce yourself please."

Tenya stopped mid-chop at his words, sighing.

"I suppose it is only appropriate to introduce myself after everyone else here has already done the same," He agreed, "I am Iida Tenya, currently also eight years old." Izuku could see his eyebrows scrunch up slightly as he thought of what else to add, "And I like to go jogging in the morning with my brother."

Hitoshi straightened up in realization, eyes brightening.

"You sound like an old man," He sounded incredulous, "Are you sure you're actually eight?"

Tenya's jaw dropped.

"I am definitely eight years old!" After that declaration, he puffed out his chest proudly, “Izuku-kun can tell you! He even attended my birthday party this year!”

“Tenya had eight candles on his birthday cake,” He nodded, remembering the cake that they had both had huge slices of, “It had his brother’s face on it!”

There was a flash of something in Hitoshi’s eyes.

“Izuku, you went to his birthday party?”

Was it betrayal he saw?

“When’s your birthday, Hitoshi?” Izuku quickly thought back to all the conversations he had had with Hitoshi, trying to remember if he ever mentioned his birthday, “I’ll definitely come if you want me to.”

“It's the first of July, so it already passed,” Hitoshi then sighed, a pout forming on his lips, “I didn’t meet you until August, but you gotta come over to my place next year, okay?”

“Yes!” Izuku enthused, already thinking about what he would bring as a present for Hitoshi and what sort of decorations he might like for his party, “I wanna go!”

Hitoshi gave him a soft smile, the hurt fading away from his eyes.

That was good.

Izuku didn’t like seeing his friends hurt.

“And!” He continued, “Hitoshi! My birthday’s in July too! It’s on the fifteenth!”

“That means I missed your birthday though,” Hitoshi looked disappointed; Tenya also did as well, “But if we’re still friends next year, will you invite me to your next one?”

“Yes, Izuku-kun,” Tenya quickly added, hand chopping down in emphasis, “I would also like an invitation next time if you will have me!”

An odd mixture of anger and guilt stirred within him.

Did they think he wouldn’t?

(They weren’t wrong, sort of. He had met Tenya before his birthday, but in the end, had decided on not inviting him. Kacchan had really messed up what he thought friends might or might not do, huh.)

What Hitoshi said made him worry though.

‘If they were still friends?’

Did Hitoshi think he wouldn’t still be friends with him by then?

Next year was so far away!

“Hitoshi, we’re gonna be friends forever,” Izuku pushed as much sincerity into his voice as possible, knowing this was something that he needed him to know, “I told you back then, right? That I wanted to be your friend.”

“You did,” Hitoshi mumbled, “But what if you don’t need me to be your friend anymore?”

What?

“I couldn’t help but hear what you’re saying,” Tenya interrupted them, “Since you two are right next to me and I have working ears, but if Izuku-kun has decided to be your friend, then it is only right to accept that.”

“Well, I didn’t ask you to butt in,” Hitoshi crossed his arms, turning his head away, “This is between me and Izuku.”

“Well, Izuku-kun is my friend as well,” Tenya looked incensed, “You’re being greedy!”

Izuku had a bad feeling.

A very bad one.

“Guys?”

He tried to cut in, his words getting ignored.

“How am I being greedy? You’ve known Izuku for longer, haven’t you?”

“Well you and Izuku-kun get to play every week at the park!”

“Izuku went to your birthday party!”

“It was a special occasion and my brother is friends with Izuku-kun’s parents!”

“Greedy.”

Izuku felt horrible hearing his two friends argue.

It wasn’t even something that he could brush aside.

They were arguing about him!

He didn’t know what he could do to stop this.

Was there even any way he could fix this situation?

Maybe he had been wrong in thinking that his friends could be friends with each other?

 

He just couldn’t stay here, listening to increasingly louder and louder words getting thrown above his head.

“I’m leaving.”

Izuku stood, Hitoshi and Tenya’s heads following his sudden action.

He felt bad for his words immediately, seeing the stricken expressions on their faces, but he just couldn’t listen to them argue anymore.

“Don’t follow me,” Pointing at the two of them, Izuku was barely able to keep his finger from shaking in his own self-contained guilt, “I can’t listen to you argue about me anymore.”

And he fled.

Iida Tensei was a hero.

And seeing that he thought himself to be a pretty good one, he knew he tended to be pretty nosy when it counted.

Was it so wrong though?

Offering his hand out to someone who clearly needed help even though they didn’t ask for it, that was what a hero was supposed to do.

So when he heard the argumentative tone of his brother in the near distance, he knew that there had to be something wrong.

And while he knew that little Izuku-kun had told him to not follow them, he knew that he would be doing Shouta and Hizashi a huge injustice if he didn’t go check up on the boys.

With how that incident had panned out at U.A. with Nemuri recently, he knew his two friends were right to still be paranoid over whatever situations Izuku-kun could get involved in.

How could he call himself their friend if he didn’t do his part in babysitting their kid?

Plus, there was also his own baby brother to keep in mind.

The two of them played well together, much to his relief, seeing that Tenya usually didn’t mesh with most other children his age. However, Izuku had been saying that he wanted to introduce Tenya to another of his friends who was his own age.

He didn’t want to think that this potential situation was caused by his brother, but it was a very real possibility.

As he stood, he saw Tenya, accompanied by another kid, quickly approaching him, distress apparent on their faces.

That was two kids.

Where was the third?

Where was Izuku-kun?

Did they lose him?

 

He had to slow down.

Deal with the current situation first.

Tensei lowered himself into a crouch just as Tenya and the probable cat food-kid reached him.

“Hey, what’s wrong?” He asked, “You look upset.”

“Nii-san!” Tenya sounded like he was going to break into tears, “Izuku-kun ran away and it was my fault!”

“No, it was my fault!”

The two of them started to argue with each other, alternating ‘no, it was mine’s and ‘it’s mine’s.

“You two need to tell me what happened, alright?” He cut them off before they could start a fist fight over who had apparently caused Izuku-kun to run away; it couldn’t have been too long ago, so there was a high chance that he would be able to catch up with him. Well, a high chance if Izuku-kun hadn’t used his quirk at all, “I can’t help you if you don't tell me what I need to know.”

Tenya and cat food-kid suddenly looked embarrassed, glancing over at one another before the cat food-kid sighed.

“So, we were talkin-”

“Arguing! You were being very rude!”

“Alright, whatever! You were too!”

“Fine!” Tenya grounded out, “We were arguing and Izuku-kun ran away because we. Well. We weren’t being nice to each other.”

Ah.

It seemed Tenya had finally met his match.

Not that it was a good thing that he had apparently done that, considering it had scared off Izuku-kun.

However, that was better than hearing that Izuku-kun had fled because of a sudden villain attack. If he had only ran because of the two arguing, then it should be easy enough to resolve.

(And Shouta and Hizashi wouldn’t even need to know that this had happened since there would be no incident report that would need to be written up!)

Now he just had to try and get these kids to reconcile, if they wanted to reconcile.

Though knowing that Izuku had left because the two wouldn’t get along, he didn’t have high hopes that they would.

But it was better than just leaving the situation to hopefully resolve on its own.

“Oh?” He hummed, watching the guilt grow in their eyes, “You know, it seems simple enough to me.” They perked up at his words; kids could be so endearing, “If Izuku-kun left because the two of you were arguing with each other, then the solution is pretty clear, isn’t it?”

Cat food-kid seemed to realize it only seconds before Tenya did as well, looking as displeased as one could get.

Tensei couldn’t help but wonder what they had even been arguing about in the first place for him to have that reaction.

“You’re saying that I have to be friends with this old man over here if I want Izuku to come back.”

Old man?

Tenya looked just as insulted as he felt confused.

“I’m younger than you!” He retorted, “You can’t call me that.”

“Hey, no fighting please,” Tensei quickly cut in again before it could spiral, “It’ll waste time that we could be using to track down where Izuku-kun has gone.”

There was a bit of nervousness in him knowing that Izuku-kun could have flown away, but he also believed that there was a high possibility that he was still in the park. After the scare Izuku-kun had given Shouta and Hizashi the other day, he didn’t think that any of them would want a repeat of that sort of situation.

“Your brother’s right,” Cat food-kid admitted, and man, he really had to learn this kid’s name before his mouth actually called him that out loud, “Izuku is more important.”

“My big brother is always right,” Aww, his baby brother was so cute, “But I do agree. Finding Izuku-kun is more important at the moment.”

“I’m glad you two can agree on that!” He gave them both a grin, “Alright, now can you lead me to where you two were so we can get started on tracking down Izuku-kun?”

Tenya started to nod, turning as if to head in a certain direction, then paused.

Ah.

This was the first time Tenya had come to this park, wasn’t it?

“I can lead us,” Cat food-kid grunted, “I come here every week to play with Izuku, so I know my way around here.”

“Thank you,” This made a good opportunity actually, “Ah, I don’t think I caught your name?”

The kid stared back at him.

“That’s because I didn’t tell you my name,” And wow, this was an abrasive kid; no wonder he and Tenya had immediately clashed, “It’s Hitoshi though, Iida-san.”

“Hitoshi-kun, then,” Tensei thought that was much better than ‘cat food-kid’, “Let’s get going.” He nudged over at Tenya who had a look of disappointment on his face, “Come on, Tenya. Let’s go find your friend.”

With that said, he rounded up the two kids and allowed Hitoshi-kun to take the lead.

The walk there did not take long, made shorter by the questions he asked periodically, allowing both kids to answer them.

It took some careful prodding, but the complete truth spilled, the two kids telling him about how Izuku-kun had left because what, or rather who they were arguing about was him.

However, it was clear that they both felt awful about what had happened.

Was it enough for them to reconcile?

Honestly, he wasn’t sure.

But in the end, even with their argument, they had banded together to come fetch him for help, right?

That was a step in the right direction and one decision he was very proud of them for making.

They looked surprised at his praise, but sneaked looks at each other afterwards, ones without any annoyance or malice.

They made it to the clearing and almost immediately, he could see the path that Izuku-kun had taken, the broken branches being a clear indication.

“Izuku went off that way,” Hitoshi-kun pointed at the bushes closest to them, “We went to check before but…”

“We didn’t see him at all.”

They both looked upset.

“We’ll find him,” He reassured them, “Don’t worry. I’m a hero after all.”

“You are?” Hitoshi-kun blinked up at him, “Which one?”

“My brother is known as the Turbo Hero: Ingenium!” Tenya quickly replied, excitement entering his voice, “He is my favorite hero!”

“I’ve seen you on the television before,” Hitoshi-kun glanced down at his engines, “You’re really fast.”

“Thank you, Hitoshi-kun,” He laughed, “Speed is one of the things I pride myself for having.”

“Being fast kinda cool.”

Tenya had a sort of cautious delight in his eyes hearing that.

“I’m fast too, Hitoshi-kun!” He interjected, “Ah, I mean, may I call you that? Or would you prefer Fu-”

“Hitoshi is fine,” Hitoshi-kun cut him off with a sigh, “And I’ll call you Tenya, old man.”

They were getting along!

Sort of!

This was good!

“So, Hitoshi-kun,” Tensei led them through the bushes, following the trail of broken greenery that Izuku-kun had undoubtedly rushed through, “Do you have a favorite hero?”

Hitoshi paused to think, nearly slamming his shoulder into the trunk of a tree they walked past, only for Tenya to jerk him out of the way. He nodded his thanks before replying.

“I have two that I really like,” Tenya ‘ohh’ed, much to his amusement, “Eraserhead is one of them.” Oh man, did Izuku know this? That was so cute! “... And I really like Ms. Joke too.”

“They’re both very good heroes,” Tensei forced himself to not laugh, knowing that Shouta and Emi would have loved to be here to hear this, “You have good taste.”

“Eraserhead saved my life with his owl,” Hitoshi-kun added, seeming to grow more confident with his gentle praise, “And Ms. Joke has a voice-type quirk like I do.”

“Oh?” He hadn’t heard anything said about quirks yet; he was curious now, about the quirk and the role that Izuku seemed to have played in Shouta's hero career, “That sounds like a fun quirk.”

Hitoshi-kun shrugged, mood visibly darkening.

Touchy subject, huh.

“What’s your quirk, Hitoshi-kun?”

Though it seemed that Tenya still wasn’t very good at parsing social cues.

“Mine is Engine,” Tenya did seem eager to share what his quirk was, gesturing at his own engines, “Like my brother’s.”

“You wouldn’t like my quirk,” Hitoshi-kun finally replied as they walked a bit further along Izuku-kun’s path, “It’s not a good quirk like yours is.”

“What do you mean?” This sort of talk was worrying to hear from a kid, “Has someone been telling you that your quirk was bad?”

Hitoshi only looked more disgruntled at his questions.

“Quirk discrimination is illegal,” Tenya added in, “People shouldn’t be mean like that!”

“Maybe, but it doesn’t stop people from not liking you because of it, you know.”

“Then they’re wrong,” Tenya’s tone had finality in it, Hitoshi-kun even glancing over at him with his eyes wide, “They’re wrong and you aren’t a bad person.”

“You don’t even like me though,” Hitoshi-kun then bristled, “What do you mean?”

“I know you’re not a bad person because you care about Izuku-kun,” Tenya said, voice holding a tiny tremble, “You care about him a lot. So much that you even agreed with me when I said we could go get my brother for help.” Keeping his mouth shut as the kids had heart-to-hearts with each other was getting increasingly difficult. “And I know you don’t like me either. Not a lot of other kids like me.”

“Izuku likes you.”

“Izuku-kun is different.”

“I guess,” Hitoshi-kun paused, “And you’re not bad either, you know.” He gave them a small shrug, adamant on not meeting either of their gazes, “I can see that you care about Izuku a lot too.”

Tenya looked rather enthusiastic after getting told he was ‘not bad’, but he guessed after so many failed attempts of friendship at school, getting a genuine ‘compliment’ from the prickly Hitoshi-kun had to mean a lot to him.

Perhaps there was hope for this friendship after all, like what Izuku-kun had wanted for them.

Soon enough, they reached the end of what he could track, no more broken branches or strewn leaves in sight.

The kids looked heartbroken, heads turning to him as if he held the secrets of where their friend had gone.

He didn’t know where Izuku-kun had gone, but he could make a very educated guess.

After all, where else would an owl go?

“Izuku!” Hitoshi called when he gestured at the nearest tree, “Are you there?”

A small rustle of leaves answered him.

“Izuku-kun!” Tenya keyed into the location of where the leaves had moved, “Please!”

“Izuku-kun,” He added in his voice to the chorus of begs, “You’re worrying your friends.”

“Iida-san!” With another rustle, Izuku-kun’s head was now visible to them, high up in the tree, “I thought I said not to follow!”

“Well, your friends came to get me because they were worried about you,” He pointed at the two kids who were now quietly discussing how to get up there so they could bring Izuku-kun back down, “And I’m a hero, so I couldn’t say ‘no’.”

Izuku-kun made a face, but didn’t argue.

“Why don’t you come back down now, Izuku-kun?”

Tensei knew he could easily get up there on his own using his engines to propel himself up, a kicking start all he needed. But if Izuku-kun had gotten up there on his own, then that had to mean he had used his quirk.

He would absolutely help him down if asked, but from what he knew about him, he wasn’t sure it would be for the best at the moment.

Not when Shouta and Hizashi had told him that Izuku-kun had trust issues that might have been shaken up to the surface again after what had happened with Nemuri.

“Are Tenya and Hitoshi still fighting though?” He glanced over at them, the furious tone of their whispers obviously audible to Izuku-kun up there, “I’m not coming down if they are.”

“They’re trying to figure out how to get you back down and arguing about if it’s better to just shake the tree really hard and for me to catch you or to find a saw to cut the tree down.”

“Oh.”

And with one quick heartstopping movement, Izuku pushed himself off the branch, large wings spreaded out behind him.

Both Tenya and Hitoshi looked up at the rustle of leaves, eyes growing big as Izuku glided down, landing on his hands and knees.

Tensei quickly approached him, his quirk giving him the extra boost to reach him before the kids did, and offered him a hand up.

Izuku took it.

“Are you alright?” He asked as he gently pulled him up onto his feet, his wings flaring out in response to help him keep upright, “Not hurt?”

“I’m okay, Iida-san.”

And as Tenya and Hitoshi-kun got closer, their sheer relief blatant, Tensei knew it was going to be alright between the three of them.

It was going to be the start of a beautiful friendship.


Notes:

    Izuku > Does this mean you're friends now?
    Hitoshi >
    Tenya >
    Hitoshi > You told me he was a car.
    Tenya > You told me he ate cat food!
    Izuku > Hehe (*・艸・)

    It really is the start of something here, isn't it?

    Tensei thought babysitting was going to be a cinch today, and now he is iffy on doing it ever again :c Tenya had always be so easy to babysit! But these three are a different story... Kid arguments sure are something!

    Izuku did not activate his quirk purposely, but it was similar to what he did when he went from owl -> hybrid. But this time, it was human -> hybrid. He was still delighted that he made it up there though and showed off his wings to his friends afterwards! They were all very impressed.

Chapter Text

Shouta had the day off.

It was something he realized as he was in the middle of his morning routine, readying himself up for making breakfast.

He grabbed his phone, fingers quickly tapping his passcode in and then opened up his work schedule to scan it, checking on Hizashi’s synched schedule as well.

They both had the day off.

It was a rarity nowadays, especially since Hizashi had seemingly only gotten busier and busier as days passed, his radio show rising up in the ratings.

(Hizashi was convinced that it was due to that show he had guest starred in a couple of months ago, telling him that just the other day while he was on his patrol, a kid in the street had called him "Wiggleman" and then wished him continued luck in his wiggling adventures before leaving with their parents.)

A quick swipe brought Izuku's schedule up as well.

With the knowledge that he and Hizashi were already free for the day, he wasn't that surprised that Izuku also happened to have a day void of both school and gymnastics as well. This was something he had already known, having memorized Izuku's schedule months ago, but to have all three of the schedules in front of him helped hammer it into his head that to head right back into bed was a valid option this morning.

 

No.

Actually, that was something he couldn't do.

They had all worked diligently to switch around Izuku's sleep schedule and while one lazy day probably wouldn't ruin months of progress, it was better to get Izuku up earlier rather than later.

It was simple enough; the later he got up, the later he would want to stay up.

And considering Izuku’s already questionable sleeping habits when night fell, it was not something he wanted to encourage.

(It wasn't unheard of for a quirk to be so irrevocably connected to their user that it would influence their needs and ensuing actions. He already counted themselves lucky that Izuku didn't need to solely subsist on raw meat, though if he did have those sorts of needs, who was he to deprive his son of something like that?)

With his mind made up, he dragged himself to the kitchen, hands already moving to make breakfast for the three of them.

Something simple and light would be best for a day like today. Unless either Hizashi or Izuku had some sudden urge to go out, he was planning on spending the entire day inside and preferably on their couch.

(It was for Izuku especially that he was willing to forgo some extra sleep. Two sets of eyes were better than one. And while he didn't think there would be trouble, it was better to be safe than sorry.)

As he left the soup to simmer, the ingredients already all sliced up and piled in, he decided to check in on Izuku. Because while it wasn't unheard of, Izuku waking up on his own without outside influence was a rarity.

The kid just really loved his sleep and wanted to get in as much as he could.

As much as he could get despite spending a portion of the night awake at least.

It worried him.

Children were supposed to get a certain amount of rest every night for optimal functioning. And though Izuku was doing well in both his lessons with Nedzu and gymnastics right now, flourishing in a way that made him and Hizashi proud, he still hadn’t grown much in height the months they had been living together.

(Were they doing something wrong?)

He passed the makeshift height marker that they used to track Izuku’s height and made his way to his room. It was a simple thing, nothing but the side of a frame they marked with a pen or marker that they used to jot down Izuku’s current height at the end of every month. It also had their current heights as well, due to Izuku’s insistence that they all be height checked together.

(Shouta was sure he and Hizashi were done growing though, but he wouldn’t complain if he grew just a smidge taller, just to get that edge over Hizashi.)

Recovery Girl had mentioned that it was a possible side-effect of his quirk when he brought up his worries to her. That Izuku might be destined to be on the shorter end of things just so his body would be able to sustain flight without it being too much of a drain on stamina.

However, despite Izuku barely growing in height, there were other changes that showed that he was slowly recovering to what his health had been before his quirk manifestation.

One of those changes was apparent as soon as he peeked into Izuku’s room, the light blanket Izuku had taken to using during the nights now hanging off the edge of the bed.

Quickly gathering the blanket up and folding it so it could be neatly put away later, he then brought his focus to his son. He ghosted a hand over his forehead, feeling a faint warmth emanating off of him.

For most other children, this was a bad thing. It was a sign they might be getting feverish or sick. But for Izuku, it was what he had always experienced ever since he had been young.

(A logical mutation for a child whose biological family apparently defaulted to fire-related quirks, or so Izuku said that Midoriya Hisashi had said. It would keep their internal bits safe from their own flames presumably and enable them to work in the temperatures of the flames they emitted.)

Compared to how he had been when he had first started living with them, this was definitely one of the bigger differences. He had grown used to seeing Izuku huddle under blankets even on the hottest of summer days. Nowadays, Izuku usually preferred light-weight ponchos, complete with backless and sleeveless shirts underneath as day clothes.

“Izuku,” He gently shook him by the shoulders, “It’s time to get up.”

To his surprise, Izuku immediately jerked up at his touch, his eyes open and staring up at him. He froze at the sudden reaction, making sure to not move until Izuku relaxed, his shoulders untensing after a few seconds.

“Nightmare?”

A short pause passed before a shake of the head was given to him.

Shouta was doubtful that it hadn’t been a nightmare, but there wasn’t much he could do about it unless Izuku chose to entrust him or Hizashi with this information.

“Alright,” He conceded, “But if there is anything, we’re always here, okay?” Izuku then gave him a nod and he could feel himself relax at the sight. It was important to him that Izuku knew this. “Let’s go have breakfast now.”

Returning to the kitchen after making sure Izuku had really gotten out of bed, Shouta then started to dish out his and Izuku’s portions. Hizashi could get his own after he had finished with his daily routine in the bathroom. He could already hear him singing as he did whatever he did in there.

Izuku emerged not too long after, rubbing at his eyes, still looking tired.

How worrying.

Still, he placed their breakfast on the kitchen table, passing Izuku his chopsticks so he could begin eating.

“Don’t wait for Hizashi to start,” He said after a small sip of miso soup, “The food will get cold.”

"But doesn’t Papa have to go to the radio station?" Izuku asked around a mouthful of rice, "He's gonna be late if he keeps singing in the shower."

"Hizashi has the day off today," He placed a piece of chicken liver into Izuku's bowl, acknowledging the sleepily mumbled 'thanks' with a nod, "I also have the day off as well."

There was a short pause.

"Oh, me too," Shouta fought the urge to snort at Izuku's blank look, the grain of rice stuck on his upper lip really selling the image, "Are we gonna do anything then?"

"Is there anything you want to do in particular?" He tapped his own lip, unable to hide the chuckle that left him when Izuku stared at him and then stuck his tongue out in order to successfully capture the errant grain, "We can go out if you'd like."

As much as he would prefer not to, it was different if it was Izuku asking.

(It was almost frightening how quickly both he and Hizashi had readjusted their lives around caring for Izuku, though there was nothing they would have changed about it. They both already knew that if given a chance, they would do the same thing all over again.)

Izuku made a noncommittal noise followed by a shrug.

Fine by him.

"Good morning!" They were halfway through their meal when Hizashi swept into the kitchen with a grin, “And how are the loves of my life this wonderful morning?”

”Morning!” Izuku replied in English before switching back; Shouta was finding that he was picking up on a lot of his forgotten English vocabulary, “We all have the day off today.”

“So we do,” Hizashi poured out a bowl of miso soup and then headed over to the rice cooker for a bowl of rice, “Any fun plans?”

“I think Dad wants to take a nap today,” Shouta chuckled at Izuku’s words; he really did know him well, “So we should stay home so he can nap a lot.”

“A nap day?” Hizashi hummed as he fetched the rest of his meal that had been sitting in the oven to stay warm, making his way to the table, “Are you sure that’s not what you want to do instead?”

“We both like naps,” He pointed out, knowing that there was a grin forming on his lips, “And there’s the two of us against the one of you.”

“Doesn’t that mean that you need to take my wants into consideration as well?”

“What does Papa want?” Izuku piped up between them, “Is it shopping? Papa likes shopping.”

“I do like shopping, yeah,” Hizashi agreed and Shouta already knew that if he mentioned anything further about this, Izuku would definitely agree to his request. Izuku absolutely adored Hizashi and it was cute to watch Hizashi squeal over Izuku offering him kisses whenever he had to leave for work, “But I think what I’d like more today is to see you in the clothes I bought just the previous week!”

“New clothes?”

“More clothes?”

Izuku’s enthusiastic reply and his full of distaste completely clashed in tone.

Wasn’t there already enough clothes in Izuku’s closet?

Where was he going to find the time to wear all these clothes anyway?

“I think you’ll like these clothes, Shouta,” Hizashi snorted, “I bought them with you in mind.”

Shouta already feared the upcoming afternoon.

Izuku was curious.

His Papa hadn’t elaborated further on what sort of clothing he had bought, but he had giggled his way through breakfast, clearly amused by his Dad’s reaction.

Just what sort of clothes could make his Dad act like this?

Izuku knew that his Dad preferred muted colors in his clothes, though he did have a pair of bright pink sweatpants that he would wear at home sometimes. His hero goggles were also yellow, so it wasn’t as if his Dad just disliked all bright colors.

Maybe it was underwear? Or those clothes that people at night liked to wear in alleyways? The ones with loads of holes in them that seemed really bad for hero work? They weren’t very logical if you asked him. All those holes would be horrible in the wintertime.

He spent the rest of the morning thinking about clothes.

(His Dad asked him a few times what he was thinking about, but it was weird to admit that he was just thinking about clothes, so he had told him that he was thinking about learning how to cook so he could make edible cooked snacks for them and his friends. His Dad had liked that and promised to teach him when he got some safer knives.)

Soon enough, his Papa announced that he was ready for ‘the Izuku clothing show’.

Both his Dad and Papa sat on the couch as he tried on different outfits, politely clapping and taking photos as he entered the living room after putting them on in his room. His Papa then had him do silly poses, even joining him when he had refused at first due to how embarrassing it seemed.

There weren’t a lot of clothes, much to his relief and there were some that he really did like.

His current favorite was a leather jacket that reminded him of his Papa’s Present Mic jacket.

It was warm and heavy and made him feel like he wanted to take a nap under it.

But then he saw it.

He picked it up, a small squeak escaping him in his excitement.

It looked just like Eraserhead’s outfit!

Was this what his Papa had meant when he said that his Dad would really like the clothes that he got?

Izuku did like seeing his Dad happy, so he cheerfully got the outfit on and then dug through his closet for the soft scarf that his Papa had bought for him all those months ago. The scarf was very important if he wanted to look just like Eraserhead.

He wounded it over his shoulders, making sure it balanced well before leaving his room to head to the living room.

“Wh-” His Dad blinked at him, disbelief and amusement clear in his eyes, ”Hizashi. Really?”

“I’m not wrong though, am I?” His Papa laughed, having returned back to the couch to sit; he then turned his attention to him, “Good idea wearing that scarf, ‘Zuku! You’ve really nailed the look!”

Izuku puffed out his chest hearing the praise directed at him, pleased that his Papa liked what he had done.

“Now strike a pose!” His Papa pulled out his phone with a wink, “Give us your best Eraserhead impression!”

That was definitely possible, Izuku thought as he buried his chin into his scarf. He had loads of memories of his Dad at work.

He then slipped into a more relaxed stance, easily recalling all those times he had seen Eraserhead out in the streets.

Which one should he reenact though?

There was that time where he had seen Eraserhead jump off a building and use his capture scarf to swing to safety.

Sadly, though that was a really cool thing to do, there wasn’t much to jump off at home and he didn’t think his parents would like to see him fall right now.

Perhaps he could go with the one that had started everything?

The very first memory he had of Eraserhead.

He could see his Dad and Papa waiting patiently for him to start, so let out a deep breath before going for it.

(Izuku hoped they didn’t think it was weird that he still remembered this, that he was creepy for following his Dad around for so long. But it had been such an amazing moment and well, it was the moment that had convinced him that Eraserhead was definitely a cool hero and one to watch in the future.)

“You’re under arrest,” Izuku crossed his arms before pretending to take something out of his pocket, “You have the right to remain unconscious while I call the police for a pick-up.”

His Papa howled in laughter as his Dad stared at him.

“He sounds just like you, Shou!” His Dad grunted as his Papa knocked into his shoulder, “If you wanna be Eraserhead when you grow up though, ‘Zuku, Papa’s gonna feel lonely, okay?”

“I’m not gonna be just Eraserhead,” He pouted, breaking character for a moment, not wanting his Papa to be sad that he only wanted to be like one of them, “I’ll be like Present Mic too!” He already had a hero name chosen as well; it was a combination of his two favorite hero names. “I’ll be… I’m gonna be Present Head!”

The next second that passed was silent.

And then his Papa fell off the couch.

“Pr-Present Head?” He scrambled up onto his knees, tears visible in his eyes, “‘Zuku! You’ve somehow inherited Shouta’s naming sense!”

“Hey-”

“I love you, Shouta, but you named Izuku after the breed of owl he was when you met him properly.”

“It’s a good name,” His Dad sounded miffed, “It’s only logical to give names in accordance to who or what someone or something emcompasses.”

“Yeah, Papa,” Izuku quickly added, “You two are my favorite heroes, so I wanted to use both your names in mine.” Maybe his Papa thought ‘Present Head’ sounded odd? “How about Eraser Mic?”

“Oh, baby, you’re so sweet,” His Papa beckoned him over, getting back onto the couch when he made his way over to them, dropping a kiss onto the top of his head, “But when you’re a hero, if you even wanna be a hero by then, of course, you should be your own hero.” What did that even mean? “It’s good to be inspired by others, but when you grow up, you’re gonna be the best of both of us and more.

His Papa thought he was gonna be better than both Eraserhead and Present Mic?

Izuku couldn’t imagine that.

Not at all.

It was nice to know though. That his Papa was confident that he could be a really good hero if he wanted to be one.

And wasn’t that also weird?

That he got to choose if he wanted to be one or not?

His Dad and Papa were already heroes, so he would have thought that they would want him to be one as well.

 

He would need to be a good hero, so they would be proud of him.

It did make him realize that he had never finished his Eraserhead impression though, his Papa interrupting what he had been sure was the best part.

“I’ll do my best, Papa,” Izuku patted his Papa’s arm before taking a step back, “I’m gonna finish being Eraserhead first.”

“Yes, Izuku,” His Dad’s eyes looked soft as he spoke, “You do that.”

Alright.

It was time to be Eraserhead again.

He kept his stance alert, just like how Eraserhead was when he was on patrol. Sadly, he had no phone and he didn’t want to ask to borrow his Papa’s while he was taking photos or his Dad’s since he would probably get distracted with work things, so an invisible one would have to do.

“Beep beep,” Pressing the invisible buttons on his invisible phone, he then held it up to his ear, “Hello? Eraserhead here. I’ve got a sexual offender here ready for processing.”

“What.”

That was his Dad’s voice.

He then rattled off the address that this had taken place at.

”What.”

This time, his Dad was slightly louder.

Had he done something wrong?

Izuku was sure this was a good impression of Eraserhead though. It was something that had happened for real, so there was nothing better to use as an impression.

“Uh, ‘Zuku?” His Papa sounded tentative, voice much more soft, “Do ya know what you’re talkin’ about here?”

“What do you mean, Papa?” He was confused, “This is just something Eraserhead does when he’s on patrol.” Eraserhead always did his best to take down all the bad people that came his way, “He beats up sexual offenders, petty criminals, and he’s even taken down a pedophile before.”

“And do you know what a pedophile is, Izuku?” His Dad looked very tired as he finally cut in, “You really have seen a lot in the streets, haven’t you?”

“I dunno what that is really, but it has to be a very bad thing since you kicked them a lot down there when you took them down,” His Papa made an odd sound, his mouth covered by a hand, “And there’s a lot to see out there, so maybe.”

“Well, you’re not wrong in saying that they’re bad people,” Sighing, his Dad rubbed between his eyes, “They’re horrible people.” He shook his head, “Regardless, there are things I’m realizing you’ve witnessed that you shouldn’t have. That there’s probably a lot that happened to you that you haven’t mentioned to us at all.”

To be fair, there was a lot he hadn’t brought up to them.

“You don’t need to tell us everything, ‘Zuku,” His Papa added, “We understand that. Just, you said some pretty concerning things, okay? And you’re still a kid.” Izuku could feel himself break just a bit hearing these words. “We just wanna help you.”

And Izuku knew that they really did.

It was an awful feeling knowing that they seemed to blame themselves for something he didn’t do.

That wasn’t right.

 

He wanted to make it right.

There was a lot he had seen in the streets. Eraserhead hadn’t been the only hero he had watched, though he had quickly become his favorite and ended up being the only one he did follow around later on.

But from what his Dad and Papa had said, apparently a ‘pedophile’ was a bad thing to have witnessed, and he hadn’t even known about that.

He hadn’t even heard of that word being used anywhere else so far.

So how would he even know if anything else he saw out there was something his parents wanted to know about?

This was a problem.

A big one.

 

Well, there was something he had been keeping from them, knowing that they would only worry if they did know.

But since it seemed like they were worrying about things even not knowing about it, then it should be fine to tell them after all?

Right?

“Dad, Papa,” He started, ducking his chin into the scarf still settled over his shoulders, “I… I…” Forcing words out was hard, but this was something he felt like he could finally share with them after keeping silent about them for so long. “I, have nightmares sometimes.”

It got a lot easier after getting that out.

“I can’t sleep at night a lot ‘cause they wake me up and sometimes if I go back to sleep, the nightmare comes back.”

“Hisashi finds me in my nightmares.”

“He set my old roost on fire.”

“Dad decided he didn’t wanna take me home.”

“Hisashi sets me on fire.”

By this point, he knew he was babbling.

“I just don’t know what to do.”

He could feel angry tears rise up to his eyes.

“You can’t even fight my nightmares ‘cause they’re not villains or anything like that,” Izuku grumbled, a hand rubbing at his eyes, “You can’t put my nightmares into jail.”

As he paused to take a breath, he was pulled up into a hug by his Dad. Though his eyes were still blurry with coming tears, he could feel the steadiness of his Dad’s arms, a bit stiff but still comforting.

(His Papa always hugged like he would fly away if he didn’t hold on tight enough. They always made him feel very secure.)

“You’ve been doing your best all on your own, huh,” His Dad’s voice held a trace of sadness, “I’m sorry we both never noticed something this big was happening.”

“Yeah, ‘Zuku,” He could recognize his Papa’s touch on his shoulder, “I’m home with you all night and I, I just. I’m really sorry.”

“‘S not your fault, Papa,” Izuku mumbled, not wanting his Papa to blame himself more, “You need your sleep for work.”

“You’re more important than my work though,” Came his Papa’s worried reply, “You’re our son, Izuku. And family comes before all else.”

“We can’t fight away your nightmares in a traditional sense, but we’ll figure something out, alright?” His Dad quietly reassured him, “We can get you a nightlight or you could come get one of us, if you’d like.”

“But you need sleep,” Both of them did too; his Papa worked a lot and his Dad usually only just got back from work during the times his nightmares usually woke him up, “You’ll be tired if I wake you up at night.”

“I’d rather be tired than know that you spent the night like this, Izuku,” His Papa insisted, “You can sleep in our bed too if you’re worried we won’t get enough rest.”

“I think,” He paused to remember how warm he had been that one early morning he had slept in between his parents, and specifically how he hadn’t had a nightmare in those hours, “I think I’d like to try that.”

“Good,” Relief coated his Dad’s voice, “I’m glad to hear that.”

As they both continued to fuss over him, (moreso his Papa compared to his Dad), Izuku realized that this had gone over well.

That telling his parents about his nightmares had not been as bad as he thought it would have been.

It meant that he had been right to trust them with this.

This meant that he would be right to continue to do so.

 

He had the best parents.

Chapter Text

They had mail.

Hizashi made sure to check their mailbox every morning, so this was nothing new.

A lot of the time, it was just bills and insurance forms; nothing too exciting to look forward to. But every month or so, Shoukimi-san would send them a package in the mail full of select goodies that she either made or purchased thinking of them.

His mother-in-law was just the sweetest and the fact that she and Genchi-san loved Izuku like he was their own only endeared them to him more.

This month was no different and he resisted the urge to shake the package to try and figure out what was in it before deciding to just tuck it under his arm along with the rest of the mail and heading back to their apartment.

“Is that from my Mom?” Shouta greeted him as he entered, “Did she send more snacks for Izuku again?”

“Well, it’s a distinct possibility,” He laughed, dropping the package into Shouta’s proffered hand, “She does like sending him treats.”

“She’s enabling and spoiling him,” Shouta retorted without much heat, "Not that I blame her.”

Shouta was completely correct on that end.

Izuku was just such a good kid and it was genuinely hard to not get him everything he even vaguely looked like he wanted.

(So he didn’t try that hard to stop himself, much to Shouta’s consternation. Izuku deserved the world if he could give it to him!)

“What did Shoukimi-san get us?” Izuku made his way up to them, eyes bright with curiosity, “Is it more jelly pouches?”

“Not this time, ‘Zuku,” With a small laugh, he moved over on the couch, allowing Izuku to sit between the two of them, “Package is a bit small for that.”

“She sent us tickets for Okuto Island’s Aquarium.”

For an aquarium?

That did sound like fun, especially since summer had already ended so it wouldn’t be as busy as it might usually be. It sounded like an early birthday present for Shouta aimed for their entire family.

“It’s a popular tourist attraction,” He mused, knowing that a number of his coworkers had visited on their days off, though they had been much more interested in the resorts than the aquarium there, “And it’s beautiful. I’ve seen the photos.”

"Well, it's just fish, isn't it?" Izuku tilted his head, the familiar cant of it reminding Hizashi that small wiggly creatures tended to be his favorite in the snack department, "There are loads of fish in the pond at the park if you want fish.”

“An aquarium isn’t like a fish market or like a pond,” Shouta looked like he wanted to bury his face into his hands, “The aquarium on Okuto Island is known for their conservation efforts and for their care and rehabilitation of animals.”

“So they take care of animals there?” Izuku asked after a short pause, “Then why do they let people visit if they do that?”

“Because it’s important to show others how their actions can have consequences,” He took out his phone, tapping his way onto the aquarium’s website, “And it’s educational to learn about how you can make a difference in the world.” Izuku nodded after hearing that. “Everyone can be a hero this way.”

Quiet punctuated their living room after that, Izuku likely still taking in all this new information.

It really was cute how Izuku put so much thought into something as simple as a day trip to an aquarium.

(Seeing things like this made him wonder if Izuku had always been this way, even back then. Had he always been so serious when he had lived with his biological parents? Hizashi thought it was entirely possible. And while it was cute, it was devastating to know that it could have formed due to Hisashi’s presence influencing Izuku to mature earlier than most other kids did.)

"It says here on their site that Gang Orca is a frequent sight."

"Gang Orca?" Izuku seemed more interested after hearing that, "Really?"

"Mm," Shouta grunted in affirmation, still scrolling down on his phone, "So, are you interested?"

Izuku hummed, clearly still deep in thought.

"There are beaches all over the island,” He hopped into the conversation, trying to sell the trip to their skeptical son; he wanted to go and if he had to talk it up, he would! “We can go swimming!” Well, he’d need to make sure that Izuku had a pair of swimming trunks and some of the good sunscreen first, “And don'tcha wanna bury Shouta in the sand as he naps?”

Izuku giggled at that last suggestion.

"We can split a watermelon on the beach if you want,” Shouta continued after shooting him a look, “They’re not in season anymore, but we can still get one if you’re in the mood for one.”

Ah, the wonders of modern society and the existence of quirks where off-season fruits could still be sold and be as delicious as ever. He fucking loved life.

“I wanna split a watermelon,” And that seemed to be it; Izuku seemed all fired up now, “And then we can eat it together!”

“You’ve got yourself a deal, ‘Zuku!”

He was already making plans for nabbing himself a day off for this trip.

There was just so much to do for preparation!

Not only did they all need new pairs of swimming shorts for the beach (their old ones weren’t going to cut it; not when Shouta had those thighs now), they needed sunscreen. Shouta was a lucky man who had never gotten a sunburn in his life, but he was not as lucky. And Izuku had mostly spent the summer at U.A. or at home, never needing to sunscreen himself up, but it was better to be safe here. Sunburns sucked.

Soon enough, the day arrived.

They had to get an early start too. Getting to Okuto Island meant that they had to ride the bullet train to Tokyo and then transfer to another train, and then to another, and then finally board a ferry heading to the island.

It was a hassle, to say the least.

He was a morning person, but there was a limit to how much he could take when traveling with both a grouchy husband and son, both who were distinctly not morning people.

Thankfully, it seemed that Shoukimi-san had chosen a great time to book their tickets, the ferry much less full than expected. Izuku had seemed entranced as they boarded but as they left the shore and started heading into the ocean proper, he had quickly retreated into his arms after a good ten minutes of sitting in between the two of them.

“Is something wrong, Izuku?” He asked quietly, not wanting to wake up Shouta who was catching a nap, lulled into sleep by the calls of the black-tailed gulls that flew alongside the ferry, “Don’t you want to watch the seagulls?”

“I don’t feel good,” Izuku admitted after tucking his head against his chest and closing his eyes, “It’s moving too much.”

Before panic could overtake him, he realized that, shit, they were on a boat.

“You might be seasick, ‘Zuku,” He fretted; this was something he hadn’t expected. Izuku was fine with both cars and trains, never getting sick from riding either of those. And he flew as well! With his wings! “I’m sorry. I didn’t think to bring anything for motion sickness.”

Gosh, he didn’t even have any bags for if Izuku was sick.

He was so bad at this, even thinking that he had prepared more than enough for this trip.

“‘S’okay, Papa,” Izuku murmured into his shirt, “I’ve never been on a boat so I didn’t know either.”

“Well, motion sickness is one of those things where if you get affected by one, you get affected by all of ‘em, so I dunno, kid,” It really was odd, “It’s usually because there’s conflict with your senses or something.” Wait a second. Could he be? “Are you using your quirk right now?”

Izuku was quiet.

This kid.

“Just a bit, by accident,” Said kid grumbled, “Dad said that these seagulls sound like cats and I wanted to hear them better.”

Well, now he knew how Shouta felt when Izuku admitted to doing things that inadvertently worsened situations.

He kind of hated it.

It was an entirely new sense of exasperation for his DJ soul.

“Using your quirk right now might not have been the best idea, ‘Zuku,” He said tentatively, “Any chance you can put it on pause?”

Shouta deserved this nap and he loathed to wake him up just for his handy quirk, not when he already woke up so early today just for this trip.

“Papa speaks like Present Mic when he’s nervous,” Izuku weakly giggled, much to his despair, “But I’ll try for you.”

“Please do,” His son being able to parse his mood just from his heartbeat? Man, Tsukauchi would line a trail of rats to his office just to tempt Izuku to join his team if he learned about this, “Just don’t hurt yourself trying.”

Izuku gave him a small nod, eyes still closed.

He hummed in response, allowing a bit of his quirk to slip through, feeling Izuku relax further in his arms.

After a few minutes, Izuku fully slumped against him.

“‘Did it,” He groaned, “No more ears.”

Oh, Hizashi could cry.

Izuku seemed too unfocused to realize it fully, but this was definitely the first time he had managed to deactivate his own quirk on his own without any outside help!

He was so proud!

“Remember this feeling, okay?” Hizashi tapped at his arm to get his attention, “Remember how it felt to stop using your quirk.”

There was a small nod, but as soon as that was given, he could feel Izuku slip into a nap.

Well, hopefully Izuku would remember this, but he wasn’t counting on it, not with how tired he had been.

A nap would be good for him, especially with how jam-packed this day was going to be.

“Sleep well, ‘Zuku.”

He would need all the rest he could get.

Izuku woke up to calls.

They sounded like a cat’s call.

He was warm from both the sun and his Papa’s arms, leading to him still being a bit drowsy, wanting to continue his impromptu nap.

The island was only getting closer though and both his Dad and Papa had promised him a fun day at the aquarium, so he wanted to be awake for that.

While he didn’t exactly want to leave his Papa’s arms, he was sure they were tired from holding him for so long and he did want to look out at the ocean without his quirk making him sick.

That had definitely been a bad idea and one he would do his best to never repeat.

“Oh, mornin’, ‘Zuku,” His Papa allowed him to slip out of his arms and into the seat next to him, “Have a good nap?”

He tapped his answer, replying with a ‘yes’.

“No more quirk usage until we’re off the boat, yeah?”

‘Yes.’

His Papa gave him a quick pat of the head before turning to his Dad whose head had now fallen to land on his Papa’s shoulders.

Huh.

Apparently, his Papa had taken his seat on the ferry while he had been napping.

It was good his Dad now had a pillow though.

His Papa’s shoulder wasn’t the best pillow, but it was better than no pillow at all.

Without his hearing enhanced, he felt much better than he had earlier, able to look out into the ocean from his seat, noting all the seagulls around them. Some of them were even sitting on the ferry with them, flying away if anyone got too close.

The waves rocked the ferry gently and Izuku could feel himself getting sleepy again, though he did his best to not fall asleep again.

And then he saw something in the water.

He had seen the occasional big fish shadow, but this one was different.

This one had a whole fin sticking out of the water.

Idly, he wondered how big this fish had to be for a single fin to be that big. It looked to be bigger than he was, though that was sadly not hard to beat. Both Tenya and Hitoshi were taller than him and they were all the same age!

The fin then dipped back into the water and Izuku waved ‘goodbye’ to it.

He could only stare as the fin came back up, this time along with a whole face.

That was a person.

A black clawed hand came up to wave at him.

He waved back, again.

After a few seconds, the person dived back down, their fin slowly disappearing as they returned back into the ocean.

Wow.

That was weird.

Maybe he really did fall back asleep already and this was all just a dream.

He turned back to sit in his seat properly again, mulling over what he had just seen.

“‘Zuku?” His Papa murmured, “What’s up?”

“I saw a big fish that looked like Gang Orca in the water,” There was no way it could actually be Gang Orca, right? “I might be dreaming right now.”

His Papa was quiet.

“You’re still a bit tired, huh,” He finally said, “Ya sure you don’t wanna nap until we hit land?”

“What happens if I nap in a dream while possibly already napping?” He asked, curious now, “Do I get double the naps?”

He watched as his Papa froze, eyes shooting over to his napping Dad and then back.

“Uh,” His Papa gave him a crooked grin, “Maybe?”

Izuku liked the sound of that.

“Gonna do it then,” He nodded as he shifted himself to lie down, using the softest part of his Papa’s body (his lap) as his pillow, “‘Night, Papa.”

His Papa lightly chuckled as he swept a gentle hand against the fringe of his hair.

“Night, ‘Zuku.”

 

His nap seemed like it lasted only a few seconds before he was being shaken, his Papa’s hand at his shoulder.

‘It’s time to get the show on the road,” His Papa crowed, “Up you get, ‘Zuku! We’ve arrived!”

He dragged himself up, muffling up the yawn that escaped him.

Rubbing at his eyes, he peered out the window behind him, first noting the pier that the ferry had docked at and then the large buildings that dotted the island.

“Those are probably the resorts,” His Dad answered his unspoken question as he stretched, finally up from his long nap, “They’re places where people commonly go to relax and get some time away from life stressors or something.”

“Where’s the aquarium?” Izuku was much more interested in seeing more big fish after his encounter with one in his dream, “I wanna see all the big fish that live there.”

“They’ve probably got more than fish, ‘Zuku,” His Papa held out his hand for him to hold as they lined up to get off the ferry, making sure that people didn’t bump into him and vice versa, “Lots of things live in the ocean.”

“Not owls though,” He told his Papa, “Owls don’t live in the ocean.”

As a matter of fact, Izuku knew he couldn’t swim at all as a human.

It was something he had been excited about back then, knowing that he would get to learn how to in elementary school. But he had ended up not going to elementary school anyway, so he had never learned something that he probably knew all kids his age already knew. He could swim well enough as an owl though, so it would just have to be enough.

(He wasn’t a big fan of water either. Water made his feathers wet and with his feathers wet, it was a lot harder to get into the air. Staying on the ground for so long was dangerous.)

“Well owls might not, but jellyfish do,” His Papa helped him off the ferry, passing him over to his Dad who had already gotten off, “And sea turtles and sea cucumbers.”

Sea cucumbers?

Cucumbers that grew in the sea?

That sounded pretty cool to him.

It took a few minutes for him to get used to his feet on the ground again, having gotten used to the swaying of the boat in the time he hadn’t been seasick, but he was more than happy to be walking around and soaking up the sun.

“Give me a second!” His Papa called out to them, “I need to cover up!”

Izuku watched him as he dove into his bag, pulling out a large floppy hat and jamming it onto his head.

“Why is Papa wearing such a big hat when it’s so nice out?”

“He’s wearing one precisely for that reason,” His Dad snorted, “Hizashi burns in the sun easily. It’s painful and he ends up looking like a cooked lobster.”

Izuku couldn’t relate.

His mutation from Hisashi made it so getting hurt by burns was pretty difficult.

But his Dad didn’t have that sort of built-in protection so why wasn’t he wearing one as well?

“I have genetics on my side,” His Dad was so good at figuring out what he wanted to know; it was amazing! “But we should always wear sunscreen, alright?”

Izuku nodded, knowing that his Dad just wanted to keep himself safe and unharmed.

And if he thought about it too long, it kind of upset him.

Staying in the sun long enough to get burns?

While he knew this was a different kind of burn compared to what had happened to his Mama…

Burns were just best avoided altogether.

“Come on, Hizashi looks ready now,” Izuku looked over at his Papa, who shot them a thumbs up; he shot one back, “Let’s head over to the aquarium first.”

“So what’s on the itinerary, Shou?”

His Papa asked his Dad as he took his hand again as they followed the signs that marked the way to the aquarium.

It was a very pretty island, full of trees and definitely tons of snacks hiding in the trees.

He wondered if his parents would let him catch lunch for them.

While his parents didn’t eat rats or squirrels, he knew they liked fish.

Izuku felt pretty confident he could grab a fish with his talons as either a full owl or even just half.

(Just nothing as big as the big fish person in his dreams. That would be too big even for his strength.)

“We’re going to spend the morning at the aquarium here,” His Dad replied, “Go through and look at all the exhibits and attend the talk given by a special lecturer.” A special lecturer? Was it someone like Nedzu-san who really liked to talk and teach? “We’ll have lunch and then head to the beach for a bit and then back to the aquarium as the sun sets.”

“And a visit to the gift shop, yeah?” His Papa added, “We can’t forget souvenirs!”

A gift shop?

Maybe they had special snacks they sold there?

He would need to keep an eye out for those.

“We’re here.”

“Whoa!”

Izuku looked up at their words, so lost in thought about what sort of special snacks would be sold on this island that he hadn’t even paid attention as they walked.

The building was huge.

It would probably be able to fit the biggest fish in the world if you asked him.

There were also lots of people around, all entering the aquarium or headed out to the resorts, but not so many that it made him nervous enough to want to leave. He had both his parents with him, and that always brought him a measure of comfort even as they got onto the end of a line that led to the entrance.

“Line’s not too bad at this time,” His Papa said as the line slowly advanced, more and more people getting on line behind them, “Glad we took the earliest available ferry here.”

“Mm,” His Dad replied, “Mom knows we don’t do people.”

So that’s how it was.

His Dad must have gotten his smarts from Shoukimi-san!

Soon enough, it was their turn to be at the very front of the line and he waited at his Papa’s side as his Dad went to speak with the admissions people and then handed their tickets over so they could be beeped with the scanner. Beckoning them over, they then each got the top of their hands stamped with a smiley face.

“There you go!” The admissions person said, “Please enjoy your time here at Okuto Aquarium!”

“Thank you!”

“You too.”

His parents echoed together, his Dad then paling and shoving at his Papa who couldn’t keep in his giggles.

What silly parents he had.

As they took their first steps into the aquarium, he knew with one glance that he would have a good time here.

He was glad that he had agreed to come, though he had been uncertain at first.

There was just so much to see and there were little metal cards in front of the tanks where there was so much to learn from.

He had asked his Papa to read them to him since a few of the words there were ones he wasn’t too sure he could say aloud without messing it up.

(Plus, he liked to listen to his Papa talk. His Papa read things out the best.)

It was while they were heading into the room where the spider crab stayed that he noticed someone familiar standing by the large tank that took up the entire wall.

“Ooh, don’t like that.”

He could hear his Papa murmur to his Dad, but right now, he only had eyes for the giant fish man he had seen in his ferry dream.

(The giant fish man was taller than both his parents! What did he eat to get so tall? Izuku would need to ask him.)

Izuku broke off from his parents to go speak with him

This was important.

“Um, hello, I have a question” He tapped the fish man on the wrist, noting the absence of the entry stamp on his hand, “Also, it’s probably illegal to be in here without a stamp.”

“Yes? You may go ahead with your question, child,” The man responded in a gruff voice, though Izuku could tell it was kind, “And not to worry, I work here. I will not get in trouble.”

Oh, well, that made more sense than someone that looked like a fish sneaking in to be with his people.

He was just glad that the giant fish man wouldn’t get in trouble for being in here without permission.

With that cleared up, he asked his question.

“Did you know you look just like the pro hero, Gang Orca?”


Notes:

    Hizashi > Those legs are too long, Shou! It's moving!

    They're here! And yes, Izuku does think sea cucumbers are just like the ones his Papa buys at the market for making preserved pickles xD Also, no! Izuku does not know orcas are not fish :v

    And Izuku finally managed to deactivate his quirk for the first time! Hizashi is proudest Papa!

    It's only the beginning of their day trip out to the aquarium and there's more fun to be had!

Chapter Text

Children asked odd questions.

Shouta had corroborated his personal experiences with a multitude of people wondering about this exact thing online, and suffice to say, the internet seemed to agree that all children naturally did this.

Despite knowing that, every single time Izuku opened his mouth and asked one of those questions, he felt like he would crawl out of his skin with second-hand embarrassment.

It was one thing to know and a completely separate thing to live through.

Multiple times.

Somehow, it hasn’t lost its effectiveness yet, which was utterly ridiculous.

“I’ve seen a life-sized figurine of Gang Orca, so I know you look like him,” Izuku continued, much to his horror; Hizashi had even turned away from the spider crab, jaw dropping as more words left Izuku’s mouth, “You’re even the same height!”

“A life-sized figurine you say,” Gang Orca chuckled, seemingly unbothered by Izuku’s sheer bluntness, “That sounds fascinating. Please, tell me more.”

“I saw it at the store,” Izuku looked to be emboldened by the encouragement, “It’s where my Dad bought me my Real Mick.”

He could hear Hizashi wail quietly, his hold over his quirk solid despite clearly not liking the information being shared.

(Hizashi had a peculiar relationship with Izuku’s Real Mick toy, to say the least. He had asked him once about it and Hizashi and only grumbled vaguely about him being the better option for playing with and how he could actually drink tea unlike Real Mick. His husband getting jealous over a knock-off toy of himself? More likely than initially thought.)

"I have a few more things I want to ask," Izuku opened his mouth again; that sounded alright, Shouta thought. Perhaps it would even be a question that wouldn't make him want to jettison himself into outer space after witnessing it being asked, "What's your name?" Oh, good. "I don't wanna keep calling you the giant fish man in my head."

Ah.

Less good.

He could feel Hizashi's head thump against his shoulder, shoulders shaking either due to laughter or tears.

As for himself, he wanted to go dive into the spider crab tank and start a new life there.

"I am Sakamata Kugo," Gang Orca, or Sakamata apparently, introduced himself, "And you, little one? What are you called?"

"Aizawa Izuku," Izuku chirped in return, hopping forward, curiosity shining in his eyes, "It's nice to meet you, Sakamata-san!"

"The pleasure is all mine, Aizawa-kun," Oddly enough, Sakamata did seem more than pleased to be speaking with Izuku. And this was despite Izuku having just admitted to calling him a 'giant fish man' in his head, "Now what sort of questions did you have for me?"

"Can you please tell me what you ate to get so tall?"

"So you wish to be tall?" Sakamata tilted his head in contemplation, "Well, you still have plenty of time to continue growing, don’t you?”

“But I haven’t grown in like months,” Izuku crossed his arms, “And my Dad and Papa cook me so many healthy things to eat so it has to be something else.”

"Being small is not bad at all, you know, Aizawa-kun," He gestured to the wide doorways that connected the rooms with a hand, "You will not ever have to encounter a door that you have to bend over to use."

“But what about reaching things that are high up on shelves?” Izuku didn’t look entirely satisfied with the answer, “Like at the big supermarkets.” He lowered his voice and added, “And I wanna be able to hold the umbrella for my parents when it’s raining too. ‘Cause getting wet is the worst.”

What.

He did?

That was just too adorable to fathom.

If Izuku wanted to do that, then the next time it rained, he’d have to remember to offer the umbrella to Izuku after picking him up. He’d have the perfect excuse of being unable to carry the umbrella on his own as well, not when he had his arms full of Izuku.

Surely that would work to satisfy him.

“Please do not climb the shelves, little one,” He waggled a sharp finger and rumbled, “Or else there will be disciplinary action in your future.”

“Di-sci-plin-ar-y action…” Izuku repeated after him, face crumpling in focus before clearing up after a few seconds of thought, “Oh! Like time out on top of the fridge!”

“Are your parents putting you on top of the fridge?” Shouta couldn’t help but pale when red pupils zoned onto where he and Hizashi were standing. This was it; Izuku’s proclivity for sharing out-of-context information was finally going to do them in, “That doesn’t sound like proper child care.”

“Can I tell you a secret?”

Closing in the distance between them, Izuku got onto the tips of his toes, obviously intending to whisper something to Sakamata. Obligingly, Sakamata bent down into a low crouch to even get his head on the level of where he could meet Izuku’s gaze comfortably.

Hizashi cooed from beside him, murmuring about how unexpectedly cute that was.

And he was right too.

It was a cute sight.

Thankfully, they didn’t need to get closer to hear what Izuku wanted to share with Sakamata. Not only was Izuku still not the best at whispering, the room they were in allowed sounds to echo.

“I think my Dad let me stay up there because he didn’t want me sneaking a rat into his soup when he wasn’t looking,” Izuku said matter of factly, “‘Cause my Dad an’ Papa don’t eat rats like I do.”

“Rats?” Gang Orca, because that was very much the pro hero speaking now, rumbled, “Your parents fed you rats?”

Fuck.

Shouta knew he had to step in before things could get worse, before Gang Orca tried to delve too far into Izuku’s admittedly odd and horrifying origin story while trying to pry for more information about the rats.

(Also it would also really be unpleasant to get nearly arrested on the charges of child neglect while on a simple family trip.)

Gang Orca flexed his claws as he got closer, Hizashi still by his side, his gaze unwavering as they stared at each other, neither speaking.

“No, my parents don’t think I should eat the city ones and we live in the city,” Izuku quickly added, “And I was the one that fed me rats ‘cause owls eat rats, ya know.”

Gang Orca blinked, surreptitiously checking over Izuku before finally relaxing.

“Well, your parents are correct about the city rats,” He agreed, “Another creature that should be avoided as a meal are seagulls.” Shaking his head and wrinkling his snout brought the sight of sharp teeth into view, “Stringy and horrible tasting. I don’t recommend it.”

Izuku looked appropriately wowed by his statement.

Hizashi just looked relieved that there was even less of a chance that Izuku would come running up to him with a seagull in his hands when they went to explore one of the island’s plentiful beaches later in the afternoon.

“I’ve never had a seagull before, but if you want a tasty bird, pigeons are good,” Their very cute son who had no qualms about sharing his previous diet with fucking strangers said with a straight face, “But you gotta be careful cause they can remember faces.” A short pause passed as he frowned, “And you also can’t eat the ones from the city cause they eat trash and might have diseases.”

“I see,” Sakamata simply nodded, “I will take your word for it, Aizawa-kun.”

And Izuku beamed.

Well, Shouta realized, at least Izuku seemed more than comfortable with Sakamata and seemed to be making his day. While he had been mostly focused on their conversation and on Hizashi next to him, it was hard to not notice the other children in the room keeping their distance from Sakamata, and by proxy, Izuku.

“Ya know, Shou,” Hizashi murmured by his ear, “I’ve seen in those gossip magazines that he’s ranked pretty high among heroes who look like villains, but seeing him interact with Izuku really shows that he’s just an orca-shaped marshmallow.”

“We should be friends,” Izuku reached out to pat at Sakamata’s arm, “Do you wanna be friends with me?”

Shouta could only stand witness to Hizashi’s embarrassing sounds next to him and Sakamata’s surprised but joyful look.

“I would be honored to be your friend, Aizawa-kun,” He took Izuku’s hand with care and gave it a gentle shake, “May we have many years of friendship between us.”

“You gotta call me Izuku now, okay?” A finger pointed in his direction, “Aizawa-kun is my Dad.”

He gave an obliging wave in return, unsurprised that Izuku had noticed their approach. He always did have a good sense of their locations.

“Then you may call me ‘Kugo’ in return, Izuku-kun.”

“Kugo-san!”

“Can I take a photo of you two?” Hizashi pulled out his phone eagerly, clearly unable to stop himself now, “Please?”

“Sure, Papa!” Izuku agreed to the request and then gestured to the crouching Sakamata still next to him, “And this is my new friend, Kugo-san!” He then grinned, “Say ‘hi’, Papa!”

“Yeah, say ‘hi’, Hizashi,” He snorted, “Can’t disappoint your son.”

“I would never!” Hizashi gave him an affronted gasp before shooting fucking finger guns in Gang Orca’s direction, “Yo, Sakamata. Thanks for being Izuku’s friend.”

“The pleasure is all mine,” Sakamata spoke solemnly, “And you have my permission for a photograph as well.”

“Sweet!” Hizashi crowed, immediately snapping a photo of them, “I’ll send ya a copy later, yeah?”

“I would like that,” Was the simple reply given before he stood up, his full height towering over them again, “Now I must keep an appointment, Izuku-kun, so I must leave you now.”

“Are you going back to work?”

“Indeed.”

“We can talk more later, okay?” Izuku asked, craning his head up to meet gazes, “You can tell me all about your quirk and how it feels to be so tall.”

“Of course!” Sakamata laughed, “I look forward to it!”

He then made his way out the room, waving to Izuku and giving him and Hizashi nods.

Izuku looked happy and he was already enthusiastically nudging Hizashi to read him the plaque on the spider crab exhibit, so he was just glad this whole encounter had ended up on a positive note.

Shouta wasn’t quite sure that Izuku knew that Sakamata was the same as the pro hero that he had once suspected ate owls for breakfast, but he wouldn’t be surprised if deep down, he suspected it even if he had never gone and asked about it directly.

(Their son could be incredibly observant and it always surprised him what he could pick up at times. Such was the heartbreaking reality of a child having spent so long living on his own in the streets, wasn’t it?)

Checking the time on his own phone, he noted that it was almost time for the lecture they were supposed to attend. The lecture that Sakamata himself was supposed to give, funnily enough.

It wasn’t that he wasn’t enjoying his time here, but he couldn’t wait to get this portion of their visit over with as soon as possible. All he wanted was to nap and he was sure he would be able to do that after lunch at the beach. He had woken up way too early today.

The idea of a nap under the shade of an umbrella was enticing so after Hizashi had finished reading the paragraphs of information available, squirming every time the crab got too close, he gathered up his husband and son and ushered them to a well-lit room where there was a large tank where a truly impressive coral reef and it’s fish occupants lived.

Other children were already seated in the provided cushions, their parents or guardians sitting a short distance away in chairs.

Snagging himself and Hizashi a seat next to one another, he was heartened to see that Izuku went to claim a cushion for himself without any extra prompting. While he did appreciate Izuku wanting to be near them, trusting them to keep him safe from anything that could happen, he also knew that sometimes, it was impossible to do that.

It helped that Izuku stayed in his direct view though.

After that whole incident at U.A., he really wasn’t too keen on letting Izuku out of his sight for long. He knew that Hizashi felt the same as well, possibly even more than he did. Not that he could blame him for being overprotective when Izuku seemed to find or cause mischief as easily as he breathed.

(Tensei still wouldn’t tell them much about that time he babysat Izuku, Tenya, and that cat food eating friend of theirs. It was obvious that something had happened while they had been there, but Tensei hadn’t budged at all, only assuring them that everything had been fine and that Izuku had managed to use his quirk at the park and that it sure did look cool. Well he knew that; he had been the one to eventually use Erasure on Izuku since he hadn’t been able to reverse the transformation on his own! Perhaps, he’d need to choose a different babysitter the next time they needed one…)

Soon enough, Gang Orca entered the room, most of the children looking taken aback as he did. Izuku looked excited, leaning forward with his eyes shining.

“I am the pro hero, Gang Orca,” He rumbled, teeth bared, “Today, we are going to learn about how we humans are destroying the habitats of sea creatures.” He pointed at the tank behind him, “And how we can do our part in saving them. Because that is what they are owed.”

The lecture started and Shouta settled himself in for a good half hour of learning.

He just hoped that Izuku would enjoy himself.

The beach was nice.

Izuku found that he enjoyed it quite a bit.

He had never gone to a beach before and he had been a bit nervous that he wouldn’t like it very much, but he was happy to say that the beach was much nicer than he thought it might be.

The sand there was fun to squish between his toes and his Papa had given him a pail and shovel so they could build sand castles together if they wanted to, And there were all sorts of small crabs that ran around. It was fun to chase them, though his Papa did warn him to not try to pick them up or eat them. They were pretty hard with their shells and dangerous with their claws, so he supposed his Papa was right.

(It was different as an owl though. He knew that he could eat crabs if he was an owl. And he wouldn’t even need to cook them first like he would need to as a human! But since they had already finished with their lunch of seafood curry udon nearly an hour ago, he wasn’t feeling hungry enough to try to get his quirk to activate just so he could eat a crab.)

The sand castles his Papa had suggested did sound fun to make, but it could be something they did later.

Because right now, his Dad was taking a nap and that meant that he could put together a toasty sand blanket for him as he did so. His Papa was taking photo after photo, giggling as he poured another bucketful of sand onto his Dad’s chest and packed it down with the shovel.

His Dad must have been really tired, not even stirring as sand slowly buried him from his neck down.

It was only logical that his Dad be so tired. They had all woken up so early in the morning and his Dad had woken up earlier than he had! His Dad deserved this nap and Izuku was determined that he had a nice toasty one.

“Do ya wanna decorate him?” His Papa asked, pressing a shell into the sand keeping his Dad warm, “Or do you wanna put more sand onto him?”

Izuku contemplated both options slowly as he shoveled more sand into his pail. When it was full, he dumped it onto where his Dad’s feet were supposed to be, packing it down as well.

“I wanna decorate now,” He said after he studied his Dad’s buried but still napping body, “I’m gonna make Dad the prettiest sand blanket.”

“You got it, ‘Zuku!” His Papa cheered, “I’ll stay right here so I can watch over him and so you know where I am at all times, alright?” He nodded. It was a good idea since his Dad was napping and couldn’t defend himself from any seagulls that might decide to come peck at him. “Don’t wander so far that I won’t be able to see you, yeah?”

He gave his Papa another nod as he picked up his pail and shovel, ready to find the best shells and maybe even crabs if he could manage to pick them up quick enough so they didn’t nip him.

As he had told his Papa, he didn’t go that far, making sure he could see his Papa reading his book next to his Dad.

The last thing he wanted to do was to get too close to the water anyways.

Water was wet and he didn’t want to get wet unless he was taking a bath or shower.

It just wasn’t logical to get too close to where the ocean met the sand.

He had to admit though, after spending a few minutes collecting the nicest whole pieces of seashells he could find, it was hard to find whole shells.

Most of the ones he found were broken pieces with sharp looking edges. He didn’t want to hurt his own fingers or his Dad, so he tried to avoid picking those up.

All he wanted was a nice one.

Just one nice shell that he could decorate his Dad with.

It was after a few more minutes of searching that he finally sighted one that met his specifications.

The only problem was that it was closer to the ocean than he really liked.

Waves had already crashed into that part of the sand, the darker color making it obvious that the sun had had no time to dry it out before it had gotten wet again.

He spent a few minutes watching the waves and trying to come to a decision on what he wanted to do.

It didn’t look too bad, if he had to be honest. The area where the pretty shell was located even had less waves than the area around it, so it was probably gonna be less wet too. Arguably, the water looked a bit dark for his liking, but he wasn’t even planning to get in that far, so it was no problem.

And getting wet wasn’t a permanent thing either.

He’d be able to run in, grab it, and run back out before his Papa even noticed that he had gone a bit further than he was supposed to.

With his decision made, he checked to see that his Papa’s head wasn’t turned in his direction and made his way closer to the shore, entering the shallow water with a small grimace.

Izuku quickly leaned down to pick up the shell he had his eyes on, marveling at the splotches of bright red on it after shaking it free of water.

The color was like his Dad’s Erasure, he figured.

He just knew his Dad would like this shell, so he stood back up and immediately started to head back to his parents, wanting to share his find.

All of a sudden, a wave crashed behind him and Izuku resisted the urge to shiver since now his torso was also completely drenched. The water wasn’t that cold to him since he had his warmth back now, but it was chilly nonetheless to experience the feeling of water against his skin while the sun was beating down on him.

He didn’t make it very far since he ended up pausing to pick up other shells that looked like they would look nice on his Dad as well. Some of these were just so cool looking!

They were ones that he hadn’t seen earlier either despite just walking past this area a few minutes ago, so it had to be the waves that brought these new ones to shore.

“Izuku?”

He looked up to see his Papa call for him, no longer by where he knew their Dad was napping, book absent from his hand.

“Pa-!”

Water crashed into him once again and this time, he could feel himself being pulled to the shoreline, the surprise making him cut off in his greeting.

And water crashed into him again, this time knocking him forward. He tried to stand back up, knowing that he was tall enough to stand here and that if he could just stand, he could run back out of where the waves were hitting.

But as he tried to do just that, he felt a sharp pain in his foot and just knew he had stepped on something sharp and jagged.

A seashell?

A crab?

It felt like the waves kept coming and each and every time they did, his Papa got further and further away from him.

“Pa-!” He tried to scream as yet another wave flowed over him, water entering his mouth, some even going down his throat, making him gasp and cough it out, “Pa!”

”Izuku!“

His Papa’s Voice was loud and panicked.

(He sounded upset.)

It was loud enough to reach his ears even as the water got so deep that his toes were no longer able to touch the sandy bottom. As the waves crashed above him and swept him further out away from his parents.

 

Everything sounded muffled underwater.

He didn’t like it.

The next time he emerged from the water, he screamed, the piercing and distressed cry something he rarely did, even when he had been upset as Mimizuku. He only managed it for a second before a wave crashed into him, his Papa’s answering yell only audible to him as he sank.

 

“Izuku-kun’s bones are indeed denser than average human bones.”

For some reason, Shuuzenji’s voice came to his mind.

And that was it, right?

He broke the surface again, this time his suddenly sharp eyes catching sight of his Papa who was nearer to the shoreline now, wading straight in, still screaming his name as his Dad, who had to have been awakened by his Papa’s Voice, got closer as well.

“Izuku!”

“Izuku!”

As the waves crashed over him once more, Izuku found that couldn’t see them again, the foggy shapes his eyes making out being undecipherable.

They were too far away.

It was alright though.

Death because you couldn’t breathe properly ‘cause of water was called ‘drowning’.

He knew he couldn’t swim.

He was going to drown.

Why had he gone into the water?

He was gonna die.

And this had been his fault in the first place, right?

 

For the last things that he saw to be his Dad and his Papa, two people that he loved, it was more than enough.

It was more than enough for someone like him.

 

As he felt the world get darker around him, he found himself wishing that he could have had a chance to say goodbye.

His Dad…

His Papa…

They were gonna be so sad.

And it would be all his fault.

 

Izuku hated the beach.

Chapter Text

Izuku couldn’t swim.

This was what Hizashi was realizing as he ran, watching as a wave crashed over Izuku’s head before he broke through with flailing arms.

Just once more!

Every time Izuku's head bobbed above the water, he knew he was still there.

Izuku was still trying his best to keep afloat.

He found himself at the shore, trying to calculate the best place to enter the water proper, wanting to reach his son before he could get too far.

Nature could be cruel though.

Hizashi could only watch as another wave caught Izuku, sweeping him away further, a distressed screech leaving his throat, the last sound he heard before he finally disappeared from his sight.

Oh no.

Oh no.

 

He screamed.

“Hizashi!”

He turned, anger building up in him, quirk vibrating in his throat, ready to be unleashed at anyone who dared to—It was Shouta.

His face crumpled immediately at the red eyes directed at him.

“Shouta,” His voice cracked, “We have to go get him back.” Despite that, he continued, “We need to get him back.”

It was his fault.

How could he have let this happen?

“No.”

A gruff voice interrupted them.

“Stay here,” Gang Orca stepped up next to them, his jacket and shirt already shed and on the sand behind them, “I will go. Call the medics.”

With those words said, he dove in after a running start, vanishing soon from his sight as well.

This was a good thing.

No doubt that Gang Orca was better at swimming and traversing the waves than he or Shouta.

He would be able to rescue Izuku as long as he got to him in time.

It hadn’t even been a minute since Izuku had gone under.

 

Izuku had to be okay.

He didn’t know what he’d do if he wasn’t.

 

The beach was silent.

Only the sounds of crashing waves broke the nerve-wracking quiet that surrounded the two of them waiting at the shore.

"I don't know how other parents do this," His legs felt weak, like they were about to buckle in on him, but despite that, he did his best to stay standing; he knew if he collapsed now, there would be no way he would be able to get himself to stand anytime soon, "How do they manage to stay so strong when shit like this happens?"

He felt awful as he scanned the horizon for anything, his heartbeat so quick that he was sure if Izuku were there, he'd be likening it to a mouse's.

"Hizashi," Shouta said, voice almost completely even, "We did all we can." His husband couldn't fool him though; while Shouta’s voice was steady, it was his eyes that showed the pain that he was going through. "And this wasn't your fault."

“How wasn’t it my fault, Shou?” It was all he could do to keep his quirk from lashing out in his distress, “I should have kept a better eye out for him.”

Izuku had only been able to wander away because he had been so distracted with his book.

Their son had been fucking swept out to sea because of his negligance.

He must have been so scared as the waves engulfed him.

 

Fuck.

 

Hizashi had heard him too.

His voice was ingrained in his memory.

 

”Papa!”

Izuku had been calling out his name.

And he had failed him.

 

“‘Zashi—”

“No,” He cut him off harshly, “It was my fault.” Apologizing to Shouta for how callous he was acting could come later, just, not right now, “I take the blame for this.”

Taking in a deep breath and letting it out, he did his best to stop himself from shaking.

He was a pro hero.

Compartmentalizing was what they excelled at.

“Gang Orca is a pro hero that specializes in both aquatic combat and rescue,” Shoving the thought that this was Izuku that was the victim to the furthest corner of his brain, he took in the current situation, “What we can do right now is prepare for when he returns.”

When he returned with Izuku.

Shouta stared at him for a second before his eyes hardened, nodding in agreement.

“I’ll go grab the towels.”

Right, they would need to keep Izuku warm.

And he still had to call for the medical backup that Gang Orca requested.

It was good that Okuto Island had a full staff of trained medical staff on hand for any sort of emergency that could occur.

They would be able to help.

They had to be.

(It was in their brochure and he loved reading through brochures, always wanting to find out more about what places had to offer.)

He felt like a robot as he made the call on his phone, words falling out of his mouth in response to the questions asked about where the situation was and what he needed.

Separating his hero persona from himself had never been difficult for him, but with this, it was different.

He had a personal stake in this.

They both did.

Hizashi ended the call just as Shouta ran back up to him, the towels in hand.

(They were new towels that he had purchased before the trip, their cute designs looking extremely out-of-place in this potentially dire situation. Izuku had really liked what designs he had chosen for the three of them. His had an array of musical instruments while Shouta’s had a trail of tiny paw prints along the edges. Izuku’s was that hideous Ganriki Neko brand that Shouta had somehow convinced Izuku to like.)

It was silent for a second before a wave crashed against the shore where they both were standing, the sea spray hitting their toes.

They were both mindful to keep away from where the rip current was located, but it felt wrong. It was where their son had been taken and to not be where he once was, where they could be the closest to him, it didn’t feel right to him at all.

However, he knew that if either he or Shouta were also swept out, they would be in no place to provide the support that Izuku would undoubtedly need after he was rescued and brought back to them.

And then he saw it.

It was impossible to miss in the clear waters surrounding this island.

That black dorsal fin parting the waves was headed straight towards them.

And best of all, clinging to that fin, was Izuku.

 

It was Izuku.

 

Hizashi could cry with relief.

(He could see something drag behind them. Wings? Had Izuku activated his quirk after he had been pulled down under?)

Of course, he didn’t look the best, but who could after an experience like that? It was just enough that it was him and he was alive. He couldn’t ask for any more than that.

Shouta had loosened up as well, the terseness of his shoulders finally letting up a bit.

“Towels, Shouta,” He wrung his hands as they finally reached shore, unsure what he could really do at the moment, “The towels.” When he was sure Shouta had the towels at the ready, he turned, trying to glimpse if any of the medical personnel had arrived yet. “Where are they? They said as soon as possible!”

Izuku coughed weakly from his position, both arms looped around Gang Orca’s dorsal fin. Hizashi could see his talons digging into the meat of it. That had to hurt.

“Izuku-kun,” Gang Orca rumbled, not even a wince on his face as he carefully drew Izuku around so that he was cradled in his arms, “We’re on land now.”

“Papa?” Izuku’s voice was reedy, weak, and it made him want to grab Izuku away from Gang Orca so he could hug him with his own two arms and make sure he was doing alright after nearly drowning, “Da. Dad?”

It didn’t matter how awful he sounded right now.

He was breathing.

Breathing was good.

“Oh, Izuku, baby, we’re right here!” Hizashi did his best to not hover as Gang Orca slowly removed Izuku off of his fin and placed him down on the towel that Shouta placed on the sand, “We have towels!”

“Keep him as warm as you can so hypothermia doesn’t set in,” Gang Orca gave them a nod, “I’ll check on the status of medical.” He dug out a phone from a zippered pocket, “Let me know if you notice any changes.”

“Understood,” Shouta bowed after handing over the other towels he had in his possession, a deep bow that he had rarely ever seen him give, “And, thank you for saving our son.” Hizashi could see his clenched fist, trembling. Shouta must have been as frustrated as he was that he couldn’t have gone after Izuku, huh. “For saving Izuku.”

“Thank me after he’s recovered and well,” He glanced over at them both, “Did you know he couldn’t swim?”

“No.”

“No.”

Hizashi could hear the regret in Shouta’s voice, could feel the reverberation of his own sorrowful tone at the admission.

“I… I didn’t tell them,” Izuku rasped, looking to still be catching his breath even as he spoke, shifting against the towels that he had just wrapped around him, sitting and hugging him to his side at the same time, “Don’t be mad at them, Kugo-san.”

He didn’t tell them.

Why?

 

It didn’t matter.

Not right now.

Gang Orca looked them over before turning to look up.

“Medical is arriving.”

He was right.

The sounds of sirens were distant but only getting louder as the ambulance approached, a small group of medics disembarking the vehicle after they parked next to them.

“Gang Orca, sir!”

Said pro hero started to bark orders, gesturing to the dazed Izuku now in his lap

Hizashi didn’t want to let go.

Not when he had only just gotten him back.

“Hizashi.”

Shouta’s voice was painfully soft.

He hated it.

 

Hizashi let go.

They took Izuku.

He looked so small in the towels, even though his wings usually provided a bulk of his size when they happened to be out. Shouta followed them, answering the questions that they asked. Gang Orca also answered a few.

This was something he should have been paying attention to, but he just, couldn’t.

All he could do was watch as they transported Izuku into the back of the ambulance.

(Did he imagine Izuku’s hand reaching out in his direction?)

Shouta returned to his side, voice low as he spoke.

“Hizashi, they’re only allowing one of us to go with him.”

What?

That was!

That was protocol.

And he knew it fully well.

He also knew that Shouta had a better handle on Izuku’s medical information since he had been the one to go with him to all his appointments.

“Go, Shouta,” It was hard for him to say those words when all he wanted to do was volunteer himself, but he couldn’t think about himself right now, or his feelings. Everything right now had to be about Izuku, “I’ll catch up with you in a bit.”

Shouta’s eyes softened and he gave him a gentle squeeze to the wrist before hauling himself up into the back of the ambulance, his hero license at the ready.

Oh, right.

There were times they didn’t allow the parent to stay in the back and insisted on them sitting in the front.

Shouta wouldn’t have liked that.

As soon as the ambulance started up again, sirens wailing all the while, it left.

He could only follow on foot.

Running would be the quickest method.

His chest felt tight though; that was not good at all.

Fuck.

This was—

“You seem to be experiencing symptoms of shock.”

Gang Orca’s voice was wiggly.

Oh no.

He could feel his legs finally lose their fight to stay upright, buckling down under him.

This couldn’t be happening.

He had to get to the hospital.

Shouta and Izuku were waiting for him there.

He needed to—

“Izuku-kun’s Papa,” Gang Orca approached him, crouching down so they were on the same level, “Can I help?”

“Hospital,” He managed to say after a few tries, eyes choosing to focus on the slow ooze of blood on his dorsal fin, “I need to go to the hospital.”

“I can take you with me.”

“Please.”

Soon.

It smelled like Shuuzenji-san’s office.

While Izuku usually thought quite well of her, he still thought the scent of antiseptic kind of sucked.

He wanted to say ‘hi’ to her, though he wasn’t sure how she’d be here. Not when he had been washed away to sea and likely gone for good.

Funnily enough, he had seen Kugo-san, and also his dads.

Izuku wasn’t sure this could be real life.

Because Papa wouldn’t have let him go, right? That person must have been an imposter that only looked like his Papa! And if people were taking him, that meant they had to be villains.

And because Izuku was gonna be a hero, that meant he had to fight the villains.

“Name and age?”

“Aizawa Izuku,” The voice of his Dad went, “Eight.”

“Any allergies?”

“None.”

“Last medicine taken?”

“None.”

Why was his Dad telling the villains all of this?

Did this mean the villains got his Dad too?

Or maybe he was also an imposter like the ‘Papa’ from earlier.

This wouldn’t be as difficult to figure out if he could just see, but it was hard to open his eyes.

He was just so tired and his chest still hurt.

But at least he wasn’t surrounded by water anymore.

So Izuku opened his mouth to question them.

No words came out.

It hurt.

He felt like he was in a haze, weak and unable to move his body at all.

Even though he couldn’t move much, he could still hear bits and pieces of things being said around him. It all did sound like he was back underwater though. Not a very pleasant feeling, if he had to be honest.

“Is he breathing?”

“Izuku!”

“He’s drowning.”

While he couldn’t exactly open his eyes to see, he could still detect the motion of the shadows that moved above his head.

There was someone next to him.

Was it the imposter Dad?

It had to be.

He kept saying his name over and over again, sounding like he would cry.

…

That was a really good imposter.

It sounded almost like his real Dad.

Someone touched his face.

No.

It took all he could to just move his head enough to snap his teeth in that direction, a dull vicious glee running through him when he heard a small yelp.

”Izuku!”

That was the imposter Dad again.

A warm hand engulfed his own and for a moment, Izuku thought it was really him. That it was his Dad and that everything was fine and okay.

He was getting so sleepy.

Things were getting harder to hear.

All the voices, all the beeping around him was falling away.

Izuku couldn’t breathe.

If this really was life after death, it wasn’t very nice.

He could feel himself losing the rest of his senses as seconds passed.

Just the lingering warmth on his hand was left.

Don’t leave me too!

Izuku wanted to cry.

Please don’t!

Thinking was getting harder now as well.

As he felt himself finally losing his fight to stay awake even as his body coughed, the pain not leaving his throat or chest, the hand stayed.

If he woke up again, maybe he’d be able to see if it was really his Dad.

 

And he did wake up again.

Izuku couldn’t feel any pain this time and it was definitely more light than where he had been before.

But this time, he was relatively sure he was still alive.

The top of his hand was horrible itchy and he was sure itchy hands couldn’t happen when you were dead.

He squeezed his eyelids once, twice, before attempting to squint them open, wanting to see what was going on with his hand.

Bright.

The first thing he saw was the light streaming in through the window. Tropical fish-printed curtains were the next thing he saw.

He knew some of those fish.

Gang Orca talked about them, didn’t he?

The names were just escaping him at the moment.

“Izuku,” It was his Dad’s voice, the sheer relief in his voice nearly painful to have to hear. He had caused this. He had made him worry so much again, “You’re awake.”

Unable to stop himself from doing so, his eyes immediately shot down to see one of his Dad’s large hands still holding onto his own. Even the tiny scar he had on the knuckle of his index finger was there.

Oh.

This was his Dad.

But if this was his real Dad, then where was his Papa?

“Papa?” His voice was weak and speaking even just that one word made his throat feel weird, but he pushed past it. It didn’t hurt but it still felt a bit uncomfortable, “Where?”

“Hizashi’s pacing up and down the hallway,” His Dad gestured behind him at the closed door, “Do you want me to get him?”

Shifting his hand around and tapping a careful ‘yes’ against his Dad’s hand proved to be easier than speaking, and his Dad nodded as soon as he registered his reply.

“I’ll be back in a second then,” He stood, doing a quick stretch, “Do you want to sit up?” At his nod, he pressed one of the buttons on the bed frame. It moved the bed to allow him to sit up comfortably, even allowing him to maneuver his (dry!) wings so that they didn’t knock into anything there. That was pretty cool, he had to admit. It also gave him a better view of the room. Before his Dad left to go fetch his Papa, he pointed a finger down at his clawed hand which had been slowly moving towards his itchy one, “And do not touch that, Izuku. Please.”

He wrinkled his nose at the instruction, but returned his free hand back to where it had been. That part of the bed was still a bit warm from where his Dad must have held his hand the entire time he had been here.

…

And how long had he been here anyway?

The last thing he really remembered was seeing Kugo-san.

He had activated his quirk when he had been underwater.

“The more surface area an object has, the better of a chance it has to displace more water, thus allowing it to float.”

Nedzu-san’s voice had come to him right before he sunk down too far.

Izuku knew that with his wings, he definitely took up more space and that was more surface at the same time. He hadn’t been sure it would be enough to displace how dense his bones were, but it was the only thing he could have done.

He wasn’t even that sure how he had managed it, but he had.

Everything after that was a blur.

Kugo-san had been there though.

“I’ve found you, Izuku-kun.”

He remembered Kugo-san saying to him after he had pulled him up, a hand supporting his lower limbs as his arms were swung over his top fin, and after checking that he could hold onto him, started swimming back.

It was also hard to forget the feeling he got when his talons dug deep into something.

… He must have hurt Kugo-san, hadn’t he?

That would just have to be another apology he would need to make.

 

“‘Zuku!” His Papa swept into the room, hair tied up in a messy bun, strands flying in all directions, his Dad following right behind him, closing the door after they were both inside, “Oh, you’re awake!”

“Papa,” He shifted, finally noticing the tubes and wires attached to him; he must have been pretty out of it for him not to notice all of this immediately; well, he was glad he hadn’t. It made him feel a bit sick to his stomach having to look at it all. How long had all of this been here? “‘m sorry.”

“Oh no, baby, no,” Ignoring the seat that his Dad had been using earlier, his Papa sat right there next to him on the bed, “We were the ones that should have asked if you knew how to swim before going to a beach, of all places.”

“But I made you cry,” With his quirk still active, the tear tracks on his Papa’s face were clearly visible to him; he could also tell that he had tried to wash his face to probably hide that fact, “And your heartbeat…”

“No, Izuku,” His Dad took the seat again, “Hizashi is right. This whole situation would have never happened if we had just asked beforehand.”

“But… I knew,” Speaking got easier as he did it more and was able to push aside the fading weird feeling in his throat, “I knew I couldn’t swim and I still wanted to come too.”

His Dad looked upset hearing that.

There were footsteps getting closer, shifting his attention over to who that could be, especially as they stopped right by the door to this room.

It was a strong heartbeat he heard and he felt it was strikingly familiar in a way.

But who…?

Did it matter who it was though?

He wasn’t going to let his parents be taken by surprise.

“There’s someone at the door,” Izuku said at the same time as the door was knocked, both his dads turning at the sound, “Do you know who it is?”

“Could be a doctor, a nurse,” His Dad still looked cautious as he stood, “I’ll get the door.”

It was logical for his Dad to get the door.

His Papa’s Voice was better used in ranged fights, but his Dad specialized in close combat.

Also Erasure would be helpful if any quirks were used.

They were in a hospital though, of which he was reasonably sure.

He didn’t think the doctors and nurses and everyone else working here could be bad, but it was always better to be careful.

“It is Sakamata Kugo,” Kugo-san’s voice came from behind the door, “May I come in?”

“Yes!” He definitely wanted to see Kugo-san again, “Dad, please let Kugo-san in.”

His Dad nodded, stepping away to open the door for Kugo-san.

Kugo-san was just short enough to enter the room without his bandaged fin hitting it. Izuku gave him a small wave and did his best to smile despite still feeling a bit sick to his stomach seeing the proof that he had hurt his friend. He had a plush animal with him. It looked like Kugo-san.

“I hope I’m not interrupting anything,” He started before turning to him, “Izuku-kun, I’m glad to see you are awake and looking well,” Kugo-san placed the plush animal in his lap, “I brought you a get-well present.”

“You got me a present?” He didn’t understand why his new friend would do something like that, but he also knew good manners were important in friendships; he picked it up, surprised at how soft it was, “Thank you, Kugo-san!”

He would name it ‘Kugo-san’.

“You are welcome,” His voice was rough, and with his quirk activated, he could hear just how rough it was compared to hearing it without his quirk; but it was a kind voice. Kugo-san was a kind person. “I wish you a speedy recovery.” He paused, something clearly on his mind. It took another second before he continued, “I realize you may not want to venture into water again any time soon, but I do visit the mainland relatively often. If you would like, I would happily teach you how to swim.”

Swimming…

Izuku knew it was something everyone else his age knew how to do already.

(That meant Tenya and Hitoshi both knew how to swim. It also meant if he never learned how to swim, he could never go swimming with them if they ever asked him to. He didn’t like the sound of that.)

But it was scary to think about.

He really didn’t want to drown again.

Just remembering the feeling of having to hold his breath underwater while he tried to get back to the surface made his chest ache and he wasn’t even near water right now.

“I dunno, sorry, Kugo-san,” He looked down, not wanting to meet his gaze, “Maybe later? I just don’t think I can right now.”

“That’s alright, Izuku-kun,” Kugo-san didn’t sound mad, just understanding, “This is a standing offer you may call in anytime.” He fished out a card from his pocket, “I will leave my information with your parents so you can contact me whenever you’d like. It does not have to be about swimming either.”

“Thank you, Sakamata,” His Dad accepted and pocketed the card while his Papa just held him close, his hand stopping him from scratching at where his hand was being itchy again. He needed to stop looking at that. It only made him want to pull it out more every single time he did, “It’s appreciated.”

“For my new little friend, I could do nothing less,” Kugo-san chuckled, “I must take my leave once again, but I hope to see you again soon.”

“See you soon,” He echoed as Kugo-san turned to leave, “Um, wait,” Kugo-san paused, “I have a friend that really likes tea. Do you like tea, Kugo-san?”

“I like cold tea,” Kugo-san answered him, “Does that answer your question, Izuku-kun?”

“Mm.”

He would need to ask Nedzu-san to make a big pitcher of his barley tea for Kugo-san the next time he was around.

“Okay, bye again!”

Kugo-san laughed as he left, waving his own clawed hand in response to his own wave.

“Get well soon!”

 

Gang Orca was so cool.

Kugo-san was so cool.

“Papa?” He asked, finally realizing something he could do to thank Kugo-san for all his help and for his new plush, “Dad?”

“Yeah?”

“Yes?”

They chorused.

“Can we give Kugo-san the watermelon we have?”

His Papa snorted, tears falling down his face again. He didn’t bother to wipe it as he wrapped his arms around his side, dropping kisses onto the feathers under his eyes.

“Anything,” His Dad responded as his Papa cried, “He saved you, Izuku.”

“You’re here safe because of him, ‘Zuku,” His Papa accepted the tissue his Dad pulled out of his bag, blowing his nose before continuing, “We can’t thank him enough, ya know.”

Oh.

This was it, Izuku realized.

Even though his parents had cried, worrying over him so much, they were just happy he was still here and in their arms.

That was what parents were supposed to do.

Love and support their kids.

Worry about them when they get hurt or if anything bad happens to them.

And continuing loving them even if they made really bad mistakes like not telling them that they couldn’t swim when taking a trip to a beach.

Yeah.

“I love you, Dad, Papa,” Izuku pushed the words out, nearly stumbling upon the familiarity of saying those words aloud, “You know that, right?”

He hoped they did.

“Of course we do, ‘Zuku,” His Papa sniffled, “How could we not?”

“Thank you for telling us, regardless,” Moving over to stand by the other side of his bed, his Dad leaned over to give him a gentle one-armed squeeze, careful of all the wires there, “We love you too.”

Izuku was happy that they knew.

 

“Can we go home now?”

“They have to have you monitored for another four or so hours.”

“Can we go home soon?”

“Soon.”

As long as his parents were there with him, he felt like he could get through anything.

“Will you stay with me?”

“Always.”

“Never doubt it.”

All was right with his world.

Izuku loved his parents and they loved him back.

There was nothing that could ever spoil that.

Chapter Text

Today was a special day.

At least that was what Izuku thought.

He knew his Papa agreed with him, but his Dad on the other hand, was not as happy as he thought he should probably be for something as fun as a birthday.

It was almost the complete opposite actually.

There were a lot of sighs and tired looks when his Papa had brought it up during breakfast, and honestly, his Dad just looked like he’d rather have a nap than a party.

But his Dad had worked so hard to put together a nice birthday party for him together with his Papa, so Izuku wanted to do the same for him.

And therefore, he made a plan.

(His Papa was a big help with the plan since he was the one who ended up having to make excuses to his Dad so he could pick him up from school instead. If his Dad had been there with them, he would have insisted on going with them just so they wouldn’t make any ‘illogical purchases’. Izuku was sure that the birthday supplies they bought counted as ‘illogical purchases’, but if his Dad wasn’t there, he couldn’t point that out.)

And now, it was time to put all his plans into action. It was so early in the morning that the sun hadn't even fully risen yet. That meant there was no way his Dad would be awake yet.

(Izuku knew he usually had to get up earlier than him or his Papa to make breakfast, but he was awake even earlier than that today!)

Usually, he never liked being up this early, but today, he would make an exception. This was for his Dad! And after everything he put him through like going out windows and almost for-real drowning, his Dad deserved a day where he could just be his Dad without all the worrying that came with being a parent.

"Hey, Dad?" He had asked over dinner that very night, "What do you want for your birthday?"

For his Papa's birthday, he had chosen to surprise his Papa with his presents since he knew he didn't mind surprises. His Dad on the other hand, did not enjoy surprises like his Papa did.

Izuku hadn’t been sure he could go out to buy anything for his Dad, but his Papa could and Izuku was sure his Papa would be more than happy to do so if he asked him about it.

“You don’t need to get me anything for my birthday, Izuku,” His Dad had replied as he removed a piece of the steamed ayu, making sure none of the bones were still in it, before placing it on top of his bowl of rice, “I’m not really a party person in general.”

And it was what his Dad had stood by, even after he asked him about it again the following night, only giving him what he thought was a joke answer to get him to stop asking about it.

His Dad was pretty stubborn when he wanted to be.

Izuku had even asked about what Shoukimi-san and Genchi-san were gonna do for it, and his Dad had just shrugged, saying that they already did give them the tickets for the aquarium, but perhaps there would be some limited edition jelly pouches in the next package they sent over to them.

While he did like jelly pouches a lot, he hadn’t thought they would be a good substitute for a nice cake.

That was what he and his Papa were here for.

Without them there, he was certain that his Dad would just celebrate with some jelly pouches and an extra long nap before going about his day as normal.

But that was going to change!

Once he woke up his Papa and got the day started with breakfast, then his Dad’s birthday would really begin.

Leaving his room, he made his way to his parent's bedroom.

Thankfully, the door wasn’t locked.

A locked door meant that he would need to knock and that would just wake his Dad up.

(And what if they were having 'adult time' in there? Whatever that was. It was just what his Mama called the time that she and Hisashi would spend together in their bedroom. But if it was clear that he was welcome to enter without knocking, he could just slip in. He would usually bring Nedzu-san along with him, but with the new addition of Kugo-san recently, they now took turns coming with him.)

However, today was different.

Izuku wasn't coming into his parent's bedroom to avoid his nightmares for once.

(And those had only gotten worse. It just wasn't fair! Dreaming about drowning was just about the least fun thing he could think of and he had had nightmares about being burned alive before! His parents had looked so sad when he shared his newest nightmares with them, but they had given him hugs afterwards and he did feel better knowing that they knew.)

He was coming in to kickstart his birthday plans for his Dad, and that required that his Dad stayed asleep for now since he would probably put a stop to his plans. But if he got far enough, he was sure that not even his Dad would be able to stop him.

Making sure his steps were as silent as he could make them, he entered their bedroom, the barest hints of light giving him enough visibility to make his way to the bed.

Usually it was his Dad that he climbed over so he could sleep between the two of them, but if he did that now, he would just wake his Dad up, so that meant he would need to get to the other side of the bed.

Izuku was worried though.

He didn’t want to accidentally wake up his Dad. And his Dad was really easy to wake up and sometimes even pretended to continue sleeping just to watch what was going on around him. That just showed how sneaky his Dad could be. No wonder he was such a good Underground hero!

But there was another way to get to his Papa’s side of the bed.

It was even the shorter route as well.

So under the bed he went

Getting down on his hands and knees, he was happy to see that it was not dusty down there. Dust would be bad since he might sneeze and he was sure his Dad would get up to check on sneezing under the bed.

He was nearly to the other side of the bed when he noticed a box.

What would a box be doing under his parent’s bed?

Just what could be in it?

The space under the bed was dark and he really didn’t want to try to use his quirk while there since there was a chance he would accidentally not just get his owl eyes, but everything else as well. His control just wasn’t good enough yet to bring specific bits out on purpose.

(And having to wake up his parents because he got stuck under their bed did not sound like a good time.)

He would just have to ask his Dad or Papa another day.

Quickly traveling the rest of the distance and popping out on the other side, he stood, immediately poking his Papa with a finger.

His forehead.

His nose.

And then his cheek.

“Papa,” He whispered, poking everything he could reach, “It’s time.”

His Papa scrunched his nose and slowly opened his eyes, a yawn escaping his mouth even as he nuzzled his face against his pillow.

Izuku figured his Papa still looked tired and while he would like to let him go back to sleep, he wasn’t allowed to use the stove by himself yet.

(And he still wasn’t tall enough to reach the stove without his stool, but that was something that would change with time. Probably.)

“Papa,” He whispered again, making his voice as urgent as he could low, “You gotta help me with the plan.”

His Papa looked much more awake hearing that.

That was good; with every word he said, the chances that his Dad would wake up was only getting higher. His Dad’s ability to pick up on quieter voices was good for a human.

“I’ll meet you in the kitchen, okay, ‘Zuku?” His Papa rolled onto his back as he rubbed his eyes with the back of a hand, “Give me a few minutes.”

Izuku nodded, retreating back under the bed, ignoring his Papa’s small ‘huh?’ and made his way back to the other side, got back up on his feet and went out the door.

Since his Papa still had to get ready and dressed (and do all that without waking up his Dad at the same time), that meant he had a bit of time to decorate.

When his Papa had taken him shopping after school, he had brought him back to the same mall that his Dad had taken him to when they had been shopping for his Papa’s birthday.

Unlike his Papa’s birthday though, they bought much more than just candles and Real Mick.

They had gotten not only the party stuff for his Dad, but ingredients for the cake they wanted to make for him and also a nice fuzzy pink sweater that matched his pink sweatpants. It would definitely keep him warm at home during winters, Izuku thought.

And to make sure his Dad didn’t get suspicious, they also bought things to put in a gift basket for Kugo-san!

(His Papa had initially wanted to just order a birthday cake made at a bakery, but Izuku had insisted they make it themselves. That was what his Dad had done for them, so it was what he wanted to do for his Dad. It was only logical that way.)

So he got decorating.

There were things he couldn’t really put up high like streamers, but instead, he just taped them around the coffee table and to the arms of the couch. Balloons, he left for his Papa. His Papa was good at blowing things and Izuku really didn’t like when balloons would fly out of his hand when trying to tie the end into a knot.

(These balloons were shaped like cat heads so he was sure his Dad would love them!)

When he finished all the decorating that he could do without extra help, he was happy to hear his Papa heading to the living room.

“Oh wow, ‘Zuku,” He exclaimed, “Good job decorating the living room!”

“Thanks, Papa,” Izuku smiled, happy that he had done a good job, “I left the balloons for you to do though.” He pointed to the small pack of cat head balloons, “‘Cause you’re better at blowing.”

“I do have very good lung capacity, yeah,” His Papa snorted, “I can blow the balloons after we make breakfast. Sound good?”

“Sounds good!”

“Alright, now let’s get started!”

Making breakfast with his Papa was different compared to making breakfast with his Dad.

Which, well, yeah.

They were different people so that made perfect sense.

However, this was the first time he had done any cooking with his Papa and he was finding it to be a lot more different than he had expected.

Was it because he had somehow expected his Papa to cook just like his Dad because they were married?

(Well he was sure Hisashi had never cooked for him so he didn’t exactly have any reference, but he had a feeling that Hisashi’s cooking would have never been as good as his Mama’s.)

As his Papa cut up the tofu into cubes, the soup pot already hard at work boiling water, he washed the carrots and potatoes that were going to go into the soup. As he washed each one, he handed them over to his Papa who peeled and then chopped them into neat chunks, dropping them into the pot after so they could cook.

It was time for the fish now.

His Papa mixed together soy sauce, ginger, green onions, and even a little bit of sugar and poured it into a skillet. While that slowly started to warm up and simmer, he took out the tilapia filet that he purchased yesterday and started slicing it thinly.

“Does this look like enough, ‘Zuku?” He asked, gesturing at the thin slices on the chopping board, “We can save the rest for dinner.”

Izuku nodded, mentally trying to count all the slices there so he could divide the amount by three and know that there was enough for each of them.

His Papa’s hands were fast though and he immediately started to layer the fish in the sauce that was now simmering.

That sauce smelled really good.

It was not something his Dad had done to fish before. He usually just grilled or steamed it in its own juices. Sometimes he might even fry the small fishes. Those were his favorite kind of fish to have; they were crunchy in all the best ways and even the bones were edible!

(His Dad preferred to cook in a more tra-di-tion-al way. Or the ‘old people way’, as his Papa called it. His Papa liked to try new things all the time, adding in new ingredients just to see how they would taste. Izuku thought they were both usually pretty tasty though and it wasn’t as if his Papa ever complained about his Dad’s cooking. His Papa loved his Dad’s cooking just like he did.)

The fish was cooked in minutes and his Papa carefully spooned the fish into separate bowls.

“Do you think the soup is done yet, Izuku?” His Papa hummed as he stirred, “Smells pretty good to me and I haven’t even added in the miso yet.”

“You gotta add the miso and then add some love in too, Papa,” Izuku made sure to remind him, “So Dad knows we love him.”

“Oh, there is gonna be so much love in this soup, ‘Zuku,” Taking out the miso from the refrigerator, he spooned some of it out and placed it in empty bowl, pouring some of the hot soup over it and stirred until it dissolved, “It’ll have my love and your love too!”

He then poured the mixture back into the soup, the miso immediately clouding up the previously clear soup.

“Here. Why don’t you give this a stir first,” His Papa suggested as he lowered the heat so that the soup would simmer instead, “And then you can go wake up Shouta.”

Izuku nodded, wanting his Dad to see all the decorating he had done to the living room, even though the balloons weren’t ready yet.

The wooden spoon was handed to him, and his Papa let him move his stool so that he could reach the pot to stir.

“Steady now,” His Papa murmured, “And be sure to not touch the rim of the pot.” Izuku stirred the soup slowly, marveling at the swirls of miso that melded into the rest of the soup, turning it into something a bit more familiar to him. “Shouta would have my head if I encouraged unsafe kitchen practices.”

“Dad would just look really disappointed in you,” Izuku resisted the urge to stick his face right over the steam coming out of the pot so he could take in the nice earthy scent the carrots and potatoes added; that was a good way to get a burn, “And he might ban you from the kitchen forever.”

“Forever is a long time, ‘Zuku,” His Papa motioned for the spoon back and Izuku handed it over to him, “How else are ya gonna get the best omelets this side of the planet?”

That was true.

And Izuku did like his Papa’s omelets; they were always filled with ooey-gooey cheese in the middle and tasted delicious on a slice of the sourdough bread his Papa liked to serve it with.

“I won’t tell Dad if you don’t, Papa,” Izuku said solemnly as he got off his stool, moving it over so his Papa had room to stand in front of the stove, “I like cooking with you.”

“Oh, you are the sweetest,” His Papa cooed as he covered the soup pot with a lid, turning and bending down to drop a kiss on his forehead, “Sweetest son in all the world, dontcha know?”

Izuku could feel his face warm, and he knew perfectly well it wasn’t due to standing by the stove or his own warmth that he could feel deep inside of him.

“Your bangs are getting a bit shaggy, aren’t they?” His Papa continued, his fingers gently tucking the longer strands behind his ears, “You might need a trim sooner rather than later.”

“I wanna grow it out,” He mumbled, trying his best to not meet his Papa’s gaze; it didn’t stop him from peeking up at him every few seconds, “And then I can tie it up all nice like you and Dad.”

Ah.

He could recognize that look on his Papa’s face.

The wobble of his lips would definitely lead into happy tears and Izuku knew that if he stayed around for hugs, his Dad would never get woken up for breakfast.

“I’m gonna wake up Dad now,” He pointed at his Papa, “And you gotta put in lots of love while I'm gone ‘cause I dunno where Dad puts it in the cabinet.”

“Yes, ‘Zuku,” His Papa quickly dropped another kiss, this time on his cheek, before standing up, “I’ll do my best!”

With that said, his Papa turned to the fridge and pulled out a few new ingredients, now focused on washing some leaves of spinach.

Izuku left the kitchen and after a quick stop at the living room coffee table, headed directly to his parent’s bedroom.

He peeked inside, and yep, there was his sleeping Dad.

Though he knew full well that his Dad loved sleeping, it wasn’t as if he could eat his birthday breakfast while asleep. And he couldn’t get his birthday presents while asleep either. Therefore, it was up to him to wake his Dad up so he could get his special day started.

Plus, this gave him the chance to fulfill one of the things his Dad had mentioned to him.

“I want to be a cat.”

That was what his Dad had told him after he had asked about what he wanted for his birthday for probably the tenth time.

It was possible that this was a joke answer his Dad gave him, but what if it wasn’t? And if his Dad wanted to be a cat for his birthday, who was Izuku to deny him.

Except that his quirk was turning himself into an owl, not turning other people into cats.

That didn’t matter though.

As long as he had his handy dandy black marker, his Dad could be a cat.

(On the off chance that he was wrong, well… His Dad was an Underground Hero. He should have been able to wake up fast enough to stop him.)

Izuku uncapped the marker while he was by the door and with a few light steps, he arrived at his Dad’s side, nearly hopping in excitement.

One.

Two…

And three!

That was one side done.

He did the other side as quickly and as evenly as he could, noting his Dad scrunching his nose up and shifting away from him.

By the time he was finished, he could see his Dad visibly starting to wake up.

Just one last final thing…

Izuku leaned forward against the edge of the bed, marker blotching a dot on the tip of his Dad’s nose.

There!

Now he had a cat nose as well.

“Izuku,” His Dad grunted, squinting in his direction, “What are you doing?”

Uh oh.

“Happy Birthday, Dad!” He said instead; spoiling his surprise so early was no fun and it was probably better that his Dad find out on his own, “It’s time to wake up ‘cause we made breakfast for you.”

“We?”

“Well, Papa made it,” Izuku admitted, “But I helped.”

“I’m sure you helped a lot, Izuku. Thank you,” His Dad yawned, finally sitting up and sliding out of bed, “I’ll go get ready.”

“Okay!”

He quickly hugged his sleepy Dad’s abdomen before leaving, knowing that they only had a limited amount of time to finish prepping before his Dad arrived.

“Papa!” Izuku exclaimed as he entered the kitchen, “I woke Dad up!”

“Good job, ‘Zuku!” His Papa greeted him with a grin, “I’m just resting the tamagoyaki now so why don’t you help me with putting together the trays?”

Nodding, he got back onto his stool and started handing over the bowls to his Papa so he could fill them with nice big scoops of warm fluffy rice. And then it was the soup’s turn. His Papa spooned up chunks of carrot and potato in with the fish that had been cooling in the bowl, making sure they all had vegetables before adding in the soup and topping it all off with some neatly sliced green onions.

“You wanna bring the trays to the table first?” His Papa offered, “I’ll start cleaning up so there’s less to do later.”

Izuku nodded again, ferrying each tray to the table and returning for the next. He made sure to be extra careful so none of the soup splashed out of the bowls. By the time he finished with the trays, his Papa was cutting into the tamagoyaki and placing the pieces into small plates that he then balanced on his arm and brought over to the table, arranging the new plates nicely on the trays along with some soy sauce on the side.

It all looked so good!

His Dad usually just made tamagoyaki with some dashi broth, so to see the corn kernels and spinach in these made him intrigued. He did like corn a lot though, so he was sure he’d like this tamagoyaki his Papa made.

“Papa?” Izuku lightly tugged on the hem of his Papa’s shirt to get his attention, receiving a questioning ‘hm?’, “You did a really good job with breakfast.”

“I had my favorite li’l helper in the kitchen today,” His Papa washed his hands as he talked, soaping up and then rinsing off, “Thanks for all your help, ‘Zuku.”

He could feel himself warming up again at the praise, so instead he ran over to the living room and picked up the pack of cat head balloons and a spool of ribbon.

“Since Dad is still getting ready, you can blow balloons,” He handed them over to his Papa who took one out and blew into it with one big breath, a cat head being formed, “Wow! Papa, you’re so good at blowing!”

“Yeah, ‘Zashi,” His Dad’s voice came from behind him, “So good at blowing.”

The balloon deflated as his Papa looked up and snorted, hand coming up to muffle his laughter.

“Oh no, the balloon!”

He didn’t even get the chance to get it tied to his Dad’s chair at the table.

”Shouta,” His Papa broke out in giggles, “You’ve really let yourself go today, huh?”

“You think I drew on my own face.” His Dad raised an eyebrow, “Hizashi, really.”

“I did it,” He raised his hand, not wanting his Papa to get into any trouble, “‘Cause Dad said he wanted to be a cat for his birthday.”

A sigh left his Dad.

Izuku could tell he wasn’t really upset though; his eyes were too soft for that.

“Let’s just.. Let’s have breakfast now, yeah?” His Papa’s smile was crooked as he herded them both to the table, “It’s your special day, Shou.” He patted his Dad’s back, “Let’s take it easy!”

“At least we’re not going out today,” His Dad murmured, lightly patting him on the head, letting him know that he really really wasn’t mad, “And it could be worse.” He sat down and looked at the spread of food on the table. “Breakfast looks good, Hizashi, Izuku.”

They brought their hands together, clapping once.

Itadakimasu

Dig in!” His Papa immediately followed up with, “And the soup is still a bit hot, so be careful, Izuku!”

The soup was indeed hot, so he spooned some of it up, making sure he got a piece of the flakey fish in this bite, and blew on it until he was sure it was cool enough to eat.

The miso in the soup was salty, but the fish itself was sweet and mellow, breaking apart as soon as it hit his tongue.

It was delicious.

As he ate, he kept an eye on his Dad.

His Dad seemed to be enjoying the food as much as he was, even pouring out another serving of soup for himself, heaping in lots of the carrots into his bowl.

(Nedzu-san’s advice on things to put in soup for eyes was so good!)

“Dad?”

There was just one thing he was wondering about.

“Mm?”

And he just had to know.

“Can you taste it?”

“You’re talking about love,” His Dad murmured as he took a sip of the soup, “Aren’t you, Izuku?”

He nodded.

“I can taste it, Izuku,” Soft, that was how his Dad’s voice was, “It’s warm.”

That was good, Izuku thought.

He wanted his Dad to know that he was loved.

    Kicking off the start of Shouta's birthday with a nice love-filled home-cooked meal!

    Shouta did try to wash off the whiskers and nose with soap and water, but alas.. permanent marker. (He'll have to go through Hizashi's hair supplies later to get himself cleaned up xD) And here is a version of the art without Izuku's marker work!

    Gang Orca found himself receiving a very nice gift basket on the behalf of the Aizawa family. It included a selection of animal-shaped ice cube trays, a lengthy letter from Izuku, and a very special plush owl. (There were also a few more bits and bobs included). Kugo was very touched.

    And as always, thank you guys so much for the comments! I read them all! Please continue to let me know your thoughts! <3

Chapter Text

Shouta woke up, beams of muted but warm sunlight playing across his face.

There was a weight on him and without even opening his eyes, he knew that it was Izuku.

With the rise and fall of his own breaths, he could feel the small puffs of air that Izuku breathed out against his neck.

It was a peaceful moment in what had proven to be a fairly hectic day so far, though he had to admit it had been a nice change of pace not having to cook or clean for once. He didn’t mind either of those tasks, but he did appreciate the extra time he got to sleep in.

Lunch had been slightly different; it reminded him of what they had done for Izuku's birthday with the free-for-all sushi, but with pizza.

Hisashi had apparently prepared the pizza dough the previous night after he had left for his patrol, then separated it out into smaller portion-sized balls so they could each customize their own pizzas with whatever ingredients and toppings were provided.

Izuku had opted to put every kind of meat he could see on his, the tomato sauce base looking more like an ocean of blood to him if he stared at it for too long. He had just gone with a basic cheese pizza while Hizashi had adorned his with a base of barbecue sauce and topped it with pre-cooked chicken, red onions, and cilantro.

They had all tasted delicious, even though he did think Izuku’s pizza had been a bit heavy on the meat. But with a side of salad, even that hadn’t been too bad. They had all shared slices of their pizza with each other, Izuku having insisted that they all share so they could each have a variety of flavors of pizza. He made it all sound very logical; however, that same notion was definitely a big contributor to why he had ended up having an afternoon nap almost immediately afterwards.

He had changed a lot, he couldn’t help but think.

Even only a year ago, this wasn’t something he would have done.

Celebrating his birthday had never been something he had been overly fond of doing, nor had it ever been a prerogative of his.

Both his parents and Hizashi respected that.

It seemed that Izuku was the exception once more.

Perhaps it was because Shouta knew that Izuku was never one to take anything for granted. Knew that he had grown up lonely and even socially ostracized by his peers and neighbors. And despite that setback, despite fending for himself for nearly two years on his own, he still found the strength to love so strongly.

Love.

Shouta had never thought too hard about it, but there had never been any doubt in his mind that he and Hizashi loved Izuku. From that cheeky owl they had first got to know to the earnest and (still) cheeky child that they knew now, they had always cared for and loved him.

That Izuku loved them both in return, it made him feel warm inside.

It wasn’t something that they hadn't known before, but to hear Izuku acknowledge it verbally, that was certainly something new.

What had changed?

Of course he had his own hypotheses on what could have changed enough for Izuku to say this, but in the end, this wasn’t something he needed to know the meaning behind.

It was enough to just know.

 

It was more than enough if you asked him.

 

Izuku then stirred, the minute movement barely noticeable if not for the fact that he was still resting on his chest.

Was he waking up already?

Shouta honestly wouldn’t mind if they napped just a bit longer. Hizashi had gone out for some ‘emergency dinner ingredients’ shopping, so it wasn’t as if he was there to stop them.

He waited for him to settle, but after a few seconds, it became clear to him that it wasn’t happening.

Low whimpers escaped Izuku, his trembling fingers clenching into his shirt.

“Izuku,” He whispered, voice still a bit raspy from his nap; he cleared it before speaking again, “Hey, I’m here.”

There was no response except more shaking.

Not good.

Shouta carefully maneuvered himself into a sitting position; Izuku was now cradled in his arms, his head propped against his chest. He hadn’t let go of his shirt the entire time.

“Hot,” Izuku murmured, his words slurred, “No, stop.”

What?

 

Oh.

A nightmare.

Izuku was having a nightmare.

Despite their knowledge of Izuku’s nightmares, neither of them had ever actually witnessed one. He was usually midway through his patrol and Hizashi was asleep by the time nightmares came around to knock on Izuku’s door.

“Stop!” A sudden scream rang out, much to his alarm, then lowering to a subdued sob, “Stop…”

Before he could do anything else, or even think of something he could do, Izuku woke up on his own, body stiff. His head spun, glassy eyes wide and full of fear, looking, searching around them before he started to pat himself down.

“Fire,” Mumbles escaped Izuku’s mouth, “I need…” His patting grew more frantic, “It’s hot.”

“Hey, Izuku,” He called his name, worried, “You’re okay.”

“I’m not okay!” Izuku looked at him after that outburst, all panicked eyes and no signs of recognition, “I’m on fire!”

(The parenting blogs he read online had articles on how to deal with nightmares or even night terrors, but if he had to be honest, all of that information had fled his mind seeing Izuku so obviously distressed.)

He would need to do this by ear.

Shouta carefully laid one of his hands against Izuku’s chest, smaller hands reaching up to grasp at his fingers, trying to pull them off.

“You’re gonna get hu—”

“No, Izuku,” He showed him his unharmed hand, allowing him to keep his hold on it as a form of physical reassurance, “There’s no fire here.”

The frantic movements of his fingers stilled for a second before continuing, albeit slower.

“No fire?” Izuku sounded confused; his nightmare had left him so disoriented that he had trouble distinguishing his nightmare from reality, “It’s gone?”

“It’s gone,” Shouta confirmed softly, “You’re safe.”

“Safe…”

The appointment was quiet once more as Izuku slumped against him, seeming to take in his words, his breathing still a bit too shallow for his liking. It made his stomach twist knowing that he couldn’t help more than this, that he didn’t have a hard solution for what was clearly a large issue.

(Plus, Izuku was already seeing Hound Dog about things and it wasn’t as if trauma could be worked through in a single day. Even if it could be, Izuku had a sizable amount of trauma. An amount that had been added to with their recent outing to Okuto Island, much to his regret.)

“Dad?”

He sounded scared; Shouta held him tightly, trying to reassure him as much as he could.

“It’s me, Izuku,” Despite the nauseating flutter in his stomach, he kept his voice even; Izuku needed him to be strong and as his dad, it was only logical he be what his son needed, “I’m here.”

”Dad..” Izuku’s voice was full of relief, eyes finally showing signs of clarity, “I… I’m…” He seemed at a loss for words. “I thought…”

“It was a dream,” He soothed, allowing Izuku to continue to fiddle with his hand all the while, “Just a bad dream.”

“A nightmare…”

“Yes,” Shouta agreed, “And while nightmares may be scary, they’re not real.”

“But it seemed so real, Dad,” Izuku looked conflicted, “This one felt so real.”

That was worrying.

Usually, while the nightmares Izuku had during the night would wake him up, the only issue he had was going back to sleep, for fear of having the same nightmare once again. Either his or Hizashi’s presence would be able to lull him back to sleep with ease. Izuku rarely mentioned anything about his nightmares at this time, just wanting to get back to sleep.

“Do you want to tell me about it?”

Izuku was silent.

“You don’t have to, Izuku,” He continued, vaguely wishing that it was Hizashi here instead of him; he had improved in his ability to comfort Izuku, but Hizashi was still leagues ahead of him here, “But it might help.”

“But, I’m ruining your birthday,” Shrinking in on himself, Izuku said with a small voice, “Today is supposed to be a happy day for you and I’m ruining it.”

Fuck.

Was that what he really thought?

“That’s illogical,” The words slipped his mouth before he could stop himself, Izuku looking up at him eyes wide in surprise; well, he couldn’t take that back now. He would just have to keep going, “A birthday is just like any other day of the year. It might be singled out for celebratory purposes, but in the end, it is just like any other day.” Confusion now riddled Izuku’s face. “Parents don’t stop being parents on their birthdays.”

And that seemed to have done it.

Izuku still didn’t look too happy to hear that, but better that than allowing him to think he was actively ruining his birthday of all things.

“Are you sure you wanna hear about it?” Izuku asked after a few seconds passed between them, “It’s bad.”

“I want to,” Shouta quickly reassured him, “I’ll listen to anything you want to share with me.”

He could feel Izuku’s arm behind him, his fingers bunching up the material of his shirt.

Izuku was rarely reticent. If he had thoughts or opinions, he usually spouted them out with no regard to what others thought. To see him like this was odd and he wasn’t quite sure he liked it.

“Hisashi was here,” He began, “And I was too.” Izuku made a small motion with his free hand, gesturing around him, “He set our home on fire and I… I was trying to stop him.”

This was a new one.

Shouta remembered each and everyone one of the nightmares that Izuku had shared with him and this one was not one that had been previously described.

“Everything was on fire,” Izuku’s eyes grew glassy again, “I didn’t want to, I, I lost my home once already.” He whispered, “I can’t lose it again.”

It ached hearing this.

However, it only made him more determined to track down Midoriya Hisashi and put him behind bars for once and for all.

“I tried to stop it, but all the fire extinguishers were gone in my dream,” He looked away, “So the fire got bigger and bigger and then it got so big that it made me catch on fire too.”

(And he was quite certain nobody would mind if he was a bit roughed up before being taken into custody.)

“It was so hot, Dad,” Shouta’s heart broke hearing this, “I couldn’t put myself out and all I could see was fire.” Izuku turned to look out their balcony window, “And when I opened my eyes, I saw how bright it was and I thought…”

So bright that he had assumed that he was still trapped in his nightmare.

“It’s alright, Izuku,” He dropped a kiss onto his head and held him closer, feeling him relax again into his frame, “As long as Hizashi and I are around, we won’t allow anyone to hurt you.”

With that said, Izuku started to hiccup, silent tears falling down his face.

Shouta gently dried some of the tears before handing the tissues over.

He watched as Izuku’s movements slowed even as he dried his face, blinks lasting longer and longer until his eyes were barely open. His breathing grew more even and Shouta knew that he was falling fast asleep. Nightmares were understandably exhausting.

“Can I tell Hizashi about your dream later, Izuku?” He asked, wanting to know before he fell back asleep, “Is that alright with you?”

‘Yes’

Izuku tapped against his leg, eyes now closed.

Shouta waited a few seconds longer, a bit envious that Izuku still managed to get back to his nap so easily even after a distressing nightmare.

For him though, he didn’t think he would be able to do that.

Hizashi returned to a quiet home.

That was a fairly normal thing to return to, especially as both his husband and son enjoyed napping.

It became quickly apparent that something had happened in the time he had left though, tear tracks still visible on Izuku’s cheeks.

Shouta’s eyes were closed but there was no doubt in his mind that he wasn’t actually asleep. While he was notoriously known for his ability for napping in just about every situation, Hizashi knew that he had trouble returning to sleep after stressful situations.

And if Izuku in tears didn’t count as a stressful situation, he wasn’t sure what else did.

Hizashi quickly put away the groceries he had purchased before approaching them, making sure to be quiet since one of them was actually sleeping.

“Yo, I’m home, Shou,” He greeted, “Everything alright?”

“Welcome back, Hizashi,” Shouta mumbled, a tired eye blinking open at his voice, “And we’re fine right now.” A small sigh followed his words, “But Izuku had a nightmare earlier.”

Ah.

With a low voice, Shouta shared with him what Izuku had told him. Described the nightmare to him, described how he hadn’t even been able to recognize him at first, thinking he was still entrapped in the depths of his dreams, described the fear in his eyes as he thought he was still on fire.

This was all Midoriya Hisashi’s fault.

And oh, he knew both he and Shouta were entirely too close to the situation to be involved in the ongoing case, but it riled him up all the same.

He wanted to scream in this man’s face.

Izuku had never deserved any of this from him and now even without his presence, he was still fucking shit up in his life.

This wasn’t right.

“Hizashi, calm down,” Shouta murmured, calloused hand reaching out to hold his own, “Izuku will be upset if he sees you like this.”

Taking a deep breath, he did his best to do just that.

Shouta was right.

He did need to calm down.

The last thing he wanted to do was to distress Izuku some more after he already had a rough time.

“Let’s have some cake,” It would be a good distraction and well, cake for the birthday boy, yeah? “Izuku’s been excited about showing you the cake we made.”

“You two made a cake?” Shouta’s voice held a tone of disbelief, “Really?”

“Oh come on,” Pushing his more ugly feelings to the back of his head for now, he teased instead, “Is it that unbelievable?”

“You’re usually not that fond of baking,” He shrugged in return, hand already gently shaking at Izuku’s shoulder, “The last time you tried, you forgot it was in the oven until you could smell it burning.”

“Well, our son is a very good alarm clock when he wants to be,” Izuku had actually watched the alarm they set up the entire time, waiting patiently until it went off and then poked him until he left the paperwork he had been trying to finish, “And I think Izuku had a fun time making it with me.”

“Mm,” Izuku mumbled, nose wrinkling and burrowing his face into Shouta’s shirt; very cute if you asked him, “Dad?”

“Heya, ‘Zuku,” Hizashi winked at him as he rubbed the sleepiness from his eyes, “Rise an’ shine!” While his eyes were still a bit rimmed with red, there was no obvious distress in his features; that was a relief, “Do ya know what time it is?”

“Uh,” Izuku turned his head to look at the clock, “Um, it’s four something, uh. A bit after four.”

“Close, but nope,” He gave him a thumbs up, “It’s cake time!”

“Cake time!” Eyes widened and Izuku wiggled out of Shouta’s hold, “Papa! Let’s get the cake out!” He turned back, finger pointed at Shouta who was still lounging on the couch, “You gotta wait at the table.”

Hizashi laughed, allowing Izuku to pull him in the direction of the fridge. It was good to see him chipper, but knowing the kind of fear and pain he had been experiencing only hours earlier, it only made it more apparent that either Izuku was exceptionally good at ignoring his own emotions, or even better at hiding them so others wouldn’t notice.

Neither were good.

But that was something he could worry more about later.

Cake time was something Izuku had been looking forward to since last night, so there was no way he was gonna mess this up for him.

He carefully removed the cake from the fridge, the sweet aroma of the crumb topping making his nose twitch in appreciation.

As soon as he placed the cake down and returned with candles, matches, and a knife, Izuku was already crowing about how pretty the cake was and how his Dad had to have the biggest piece, things went quickly.

The crumb cake he and Izuku had prepared disappeared in a blink of an eye after the candles were blown out and removed. They each had a portion, all topped with powdered sugar. The remaining pieces were placed in an airtight container, ready for passing out to Tensei and Nemuri, though Izuku had been a bit pouty hearing the second name.

(In return, Izuku insisted that pieces go to Nedzu and if possible, to Sakamata as well. Hizashi wasn’t even sure that a piece of cake would be able to survive the trip from Musutafu to wherever Sakamata happened to be right now. For Izuku’s sake, he would need to find out.)

As soon as the last piece of cake was placed away, dishes all washed and dried, Izuku came up to his side, hand tugging at the loops of his belt.

“It’s present time now, right?” He whispered to him; Hizashi could see that Shouta could hear them fine still, though he pointedly looked in another direction, “Everything’s ready?”

“Yeah, it’s all ready,” Hizashi gave him a pat on the head, “You wanna fetch it for him?”

Izuku nodded and quickly ran out of the kitchen and to his room.

“C’mon, Shou!” He swung his arm around Shouta’s shoulder, guiding him in the direction of the living room, ”It’s present time!”

“You’ve been using so much more English recently that I actually understood that,” Shouta groaned, “At least use vocabulary that will be useful in everyday life.”

“Nah,” He laughed, carefully dropping a kiss on his cheek where there were no whisker marks, “You need to brush up on your English anyways.”

“Not like I use it a lot,” Shouta snorted, “Spotlight Heroes are the ones that end up giving directions to foreign tourists, ‘Zashi, not someone like me.”

“Well, we’re gonna be going to karaoke soon with Tensei an’ Nemuri as a late birthday thing,” He pointed out, noting Shouta’s eyebrow twitch at the news, “It’s all expense paid for already so we can’t skip out or reschedule.”

“And is Izuku coming with us?”

“Well, Izuku said he didn’t wanna go,” Hizashi gave him a sheepish look, “When he heard Nemuri was gonna be there, he was pretty adamant on not going.”

They really needed to work something out here soon.

While he understood Izuku’s wariness about Nemuri, and man, he and Shouta weren’t too fond of her lately as well, but they were all still friends.

“Who will watch Izuku then?” Shouta asked, “When is this?”

“Monday afternoon,” He hummed, “And well, we could ask Nedzu?”

Nedzu had rocketed up to their first choice for babysitting, though it wasn’t as if Tensei was an option at all this time. And if Nedzu wasn’t available, he was sure they had someone else they could ask, though it would really be up to Izuku then.

“We need to confirm that Izuku is in the care of a responsible adult before anything else,” Well, it wasn’t a no! That was good enough for him! “And if we can do that, I’ll think about this whole karaoke thing.”

“Gotcha!” He dropped another kiss, this time against Shouta’s hair; Hizashi could hear his grumbling but he didn’t pull away, even leaning closer against him, “Love ya, Shou!”

“Aha!” He could hear Izuku exclaim from his room, “Here it is!”

Hizashi resisted the urge to laugh, knowing that he must have buried it very deep in his closet to hide it.

“Happy birthday, Dad!” Footsteps marked Izuku’s run to the living room, the lurid sweater they had picked out in his arms, “We got you a sweater.”

It was probably the most hideous thing he had seen in the store, but Izuku had become entranced with it, excitedly pointing out the ’Ganriki Neko’ on the front, insisting that this was absolutely the perfect thing for Shouta.

And it likely was!

But it didn’t mean that it wasn’t fucking ugly and an eyesore.

(Hot pink and neon green? Who even decided that these colors together were okay?!)

“It’s beautiful,” Shouta had it in his hands now after Izuku had handed it off to him, “I love it.”

Izuku beamed after hearing that.

“Like, I’m glad you like it, ‘cause I don’t think there’s anyone else on this planet that would, but please don’t wear it out,” Hizashi quickly interjected, “I’m beggin’ here!”

The look on Shouta’s face did not give him much hope.

“We’ll see.”

“Oh!”

They both turned at Izuku’s voice, his eyes already directed out the balcony doors and up towards the sky,

“It’s one of Nedzu-san’s robots!”

Hizashi could barely even see the dot that was incoming, but that Izuku could, that could only mean that Izuku had used his quirk again.

A quick glance showed him that he was right.

However, this time, Izuku seemed much more perky, not fatigued at all. Granted he did have a nap earlier today, but this was an improvement from the previous time that this had happened! He was so proud!

Izuku shook his head after a few seconds, eyes returning to their usual state.

So fucking proud.

As Izuku stood to open their doors for the little delivery drone, he sidled up to Shouta again.

“Didja see?” He whispered, bumping his head against the side of Shouta’s, “Izuku deactivated his quirk all on his own again! A lot faster compared to when we were on the ferry!”

“He used his quirk when we were on the ferry?” Shouta whispered back, “Why?”

“Wanted to see the gulls,” Hizashi chuckled, “‘Cause you told him about them.”

“That kid…” An exasperated sigh, but a fond one at that, “He’s gonna be the death of us.”

“Don’t I know it.”

“Hi, Nedzu-san’s robot!” Izuku called out as it entered their living room and landed next to him, giving it a pat on its dome, “Did Nedzu-san send you for my Dad’s birthday?”

The drone beeped.

Shouta sighed, standing up to retrieve whatever it was in the drone’s care.

Was it more papers?

The last time it had come, it had been his birthday and they had gotten adoption papers for Izuku.

Just what could it be this time?

There were papers in Shouta’s hand once again as he returned to his seat on the couch, Izuku having already lost interest and now alternating between ‘beeps’ and ‘boops’ with the drone who was beeping right back at him.

“What do they say, Shou?”

Nothing bad, he hoped.

Shouta was silent as he read the first page, turning it to skim the next few before flipping it to the end and letting it fall back on its own.

“I think I just got a job offer.”

Say what now?

“Huh?” He blurted out, “For what job?”

When had Shouta been looking for a second job?!

“For an eventual teaching job at U.A.” Shouta looked confused, “Nedzu says he’s willing to allow me to shadow some of the faculty and work towards a license at the same time.”

Shouta teaching?

He could barely imagine that.

Izuku was probably one of the only kids he had even been in close contact with and teenagers were supposed to be much more difficult than kids.

(And Izuku was a great kid that never tried to get into any trouble too! Though he did seem to unintentionally barrel roll himself into horrible situations. Through no fault of his own.)

“Wh-What are you gonna tell ‘im?”

Hizashi didn’t even know what to think; he was sure that Shouta would have told him if he was planning on getting a second job, but they already had Izuku and Shota had always worried about not being there enough for their son, so for a second job now? It was some weird timing is all.

And this was Nedzu.

Nedzu never took ‘no’ for an answer.

“I think you should,” Izuku chimed in, “Dad, you’re so good at teaching.” He giggled, “Me and Nedzu-san watch you sometimes from his office windows when you’re with Snipe-san’s class.”

Shouta pinked hearing that.

What an adorable man he married!

“And Nedzu-san wouldn’t try to hire someone he thinks wouldn’t be a good teacher, you know?” Izuku continued, “Nedzu-san is smart so he knows these things.”

Well, Izuku wasn’t wrong there.

“I’ll think about it,” Shouta sighed, “I’ll do a bit more reading on it before deciding what to do.” He placed the packet facedown on the coffee table, “It’s a big decision to make and it’s still my birthday. Let’s just relax for the rest of the day.”

“Okay,” Izuku nodded, standing and waving as the drone seemingly decided that it was time to return to his master, “Bye, Nedzu-san’s robot!”

Man.

Hizashi had no doubt that Izuku had been the one to talk Shouta up to Nedzu, so open he was with his compliments.

But this wasn’t bad news.

If Shouta started teaching, it would mean he would be in the same general area as Izuku for the foreseeable future. If Izuku ended up wanting to officially attend U.A. at least. And that meant that it would be so much easier for them to keep Izuku safe as well.

This was actually pretty good news.

Perhaps he should see if he could do the same.

A teaching job, huh.

Sounded like fun.

Notes:

    Shouta > This sweater is now my favorite article of clothing.
    Izuku > Papa wouldn't get me a matching one when we went shopping 'cause he said it's ugly.
    Shouta > We are going shopping immediately.
    Hizashi > ◝(๑⁺᷄д⁺᷅๑)◞՞

    Shouta's birthday is finally over! He's now the same age as Hizashi again, and Izuku makes that quite known to him.

    And do not worry, Shouta does get his whiskers marks and all removed. Not before Hizashi snaps a few photos though! The memories will go straight into their family photo album!

    If given a chance, both Shouta and Hizashi would knock the living daylights out of Midoriya Hisashi. As they should!

    And as always, thank you guys so much for the comments! I read them all! Please continue to let me know your thoughts! <3

Chapter Text

Izuku was going to be getting a babysitter today.

Honestly, he hadn't been too thrilled when he found out that he was going to be getting one, but he could understand why his parents would want him to have one.

It was just that it wouldn't be Nedzu-san.

He had hoped that his friend would be free to watch him for the few hours that his parents would be out with their friends, but apparently there were meetings that couldn't be rescheduled.

(Nedzu-san had not sounded happy to give his Dad that piece of news, but Izuku had kinda half-expected it. There was a logical reason why he didn't have lessons on Mondays after all. It didn't mean he couldn't be sad that he wouldn't be getting to spend some time with Nedzu-san that wasn't school time though.)

When his Dad had told him that his babysitter would be Tsukauchi-san, the hat-man, he had mostly been surprised.

He hadn't even known that he was an option!

But it didn’t matter, not really.

Now that he knew that Tsukauchi-san was coming over to watch him, this was an opportunity that couldn’t be put to waste.

(There was that small temptation to go figure out what was under his parent’s bed, but he would rather just ask. It was possible that it was some important confidential hero thing that he wasn’t supposed to know about and he would hate to get either of his dads in trouble.)

Tsukauchi was the only person besides his parents that knew the full extent of what Hisashi had done to his Mama and to him and he was the one who was taking the lead in the investigation. He had meetings with his Dad every so often and he knew that his Dad was being updated on everything, but if he had the chance to find out if anything more recent happened, he would take it.

Izuku did not like thinking about it, but even he knew that there was a lot of arson going on right now.

(He’d see it on the morning news sometimes before he had to leave for school, the news reporter talking about how another building had been set aflame and how people had gotten hurt. His Papa always either changed the channel to a morning cartoon or just turned the television off when that kind of news came up. It was understandable. Starting out mornings with bad news kind of sucked.)

“Are you ready to see Tsukauchi again, ‘Zuku?” His Papa asked as he got ready to leave, tying his hair up high into a bun, “He’s gonna be here soon.”

Was he ready?

No, not really.

But he also wanted his dads to have a good time out with their friends, so he would need to be ready.

“I dunno,” He told his Papa, watching him as he put on his boots, an uneasy feeling bubbling in his stomach, “But I can tell him ‘thank you’ for the hat now, right?”

“You sure can!” His Papa’s laugh was full of amusement though Izuku could see his eyes soften, “And you’ll have our numbers, so you can always give us a call or something, yeah?”

Izuku kind of doubted that they would have enough time to pay attention to their phones if they were all doing karaoke, but it was nice of his Papa to say so.

This was the first time in a while that his dads have been able to spend some time together alone with their friends, so Izuku really didn’t wanna bother them too much. He knew it was his fault since he was still a kid and his parents didn’t like the thought of him staying at home without anyone to watch over him. It wasn’t as if he was planning on getting into any sort of trouble. He knew where the fire extinguishers were and he wasn’t in danger of drowning in their bathtub. But at the same time, he understood why they were like this.

(He hadn’t planned on getting swept out to sea either.)

A sudden knock at the door broke him out of his thoughts.

That had to be him!

His Papa immediately checked the peephole, unlocking and opening the door in one smooth motion with a welcoming grin.

“Yo, Tsukauchi!” Izuku peeked up at him, this time not surprised to see no hat, “Glad you could make it!”

“Yamada,” Tsukauchi-san, who was currently not his usual hat-man self, greeted in return, “Thanks for having me.”

“Aw, shucks,” His Papa snorted, stepping aside so Tsukauchi-san could enter, “You’re the one doing us a favor watching Izuku for a few hours.” Tsukauchi-san entered, a messenger bag hanging over his shoulders, still rather dressed up for work rather than not, “Hey, ‘Zuku, say ‘hi’ to Tsukauchi-san.”

“Hi, Tsukauchi-san.”

He greeted him, doing his best to look unaffected; having the hat-man here again wasn’t as bad as actual strangers, but it still made him feel weird.

It was most likely because he felt that the hat-man was intruding into his territory.

Their territory.

 

No, no.

He had to behave and that meant he had to at least try to not let his instincts get ahead of themselves.

There was no doubt in his mind that if he somehow ended up removing Tsukauchi-san from their home, he would end up ruining his parent’s karaoke time and that was the last thing he wanted to do.

Plus, he reminded himself, this was a mission! A self-assigned re-con-nai-ssance mission! If he wanted to be a hero like his Dad and Papa, he would need to learn how to keep his quirk from having too much of an opinion on whatever was happening. That meant he needed to be patient.

“Tsukauchi,” His Dad beckoned him over, a folder in hand, Tsukauchi stepping even further in after hanging his coat on the rack and removing his shoes in exchange for guest slippers, “Alright, let me give you the rundown of what’s going to happen tonight.”

“Of course, Aizawa,” Tsukauchi-san replied, taking the folder that was handed to him; it was a nice Ganriki Neko-branded folder that his Dad had ended up getting the other day when they had gone shopping for more sweaters of the same brand, “I’m all ears.”

“We’ve already had lunch and Izuku’s already been down for a nap, so you don’t need to worry about feeding him,” His Dad started, stepping away from the fridge to the snack cabinet, “But if Izuku is feeling hungry, he’s allowed to snack on anything from this cabinet.” He gestured to the coffee machine, “And feel free to also grab a snack if you need one. Or help yourself to some coffee instead.”

“I think I’ll take you up on the coffee,” Tsukauchi-san chuckles, “Whatever you have here is bound to be leagues better than the stuff we have over at the precinct.”

Adults and their coffee…

Izuku wasn’t sure he’d ever understand why they all seemed to like it so much.

“We’ll be back before dinner as well, Tsukauchi,” His Dad continued, “So there’s no need to worry about fixing up a meal later.”

“Right.”

“You have our contact information, so if anything happens, please contact us,” Tsukauchi-san nodded, now flipping through the papers in the folder; Izuku knew that his Dad had put that together so that there would be no questions that would go unanswered if they had to leave in a hurry, “All of our emergency contact numbers are on the fridge, so please acquaint yourself with them.”

(Izuku knew that Nedzu-san’s number was one of the ones up there. He hoped that nothing would happen so that his number would get called. Nedzu-san had important meetings today after all and well, Izuku really didn’t want to distract him from his meetings or cause them to get postponed for later. It would only mess up his own school schedule and he liked going to school!)

“And that’s about it,” His Dad finally concluded, “Do you have any questions?”

“I think Izuku-kun and I will be fine, Aizawa,” Tsukauchi-san gave him a strained smile, “We’re going to be staying inside the entire time, so I don’t anticipate anything too wild happening.”

Tsukauchi-san was probably right about that.

Izuku already had plans for this evening and none of them included leaving the apartment or getting into any sort of trouble.

However, he also knew that though his Dad didn’t sound like it, he was worried.

Worry was something he dealt with a lot, so for him to recognize it wasn’t exactly hard. It did mean he felt bad for his Dad though. He was supposed to be going out to have fun with his friends, but instead he was here feeling all bad because he had to leave him alone with the hat-man.

“Dad?” He went over to tug at his Dad’s sleeve to get his attention, easily gaining it, “We’ll be okay so you don’t need to worry about anything except for having fun.”

To his surprise, his Dad looked even worse off at his words.

He didn’t get it!

Weren’t words like those supposed to comfort him?

“Oh, Shou,” His Papa hummed, now fully dressed and stepping into the kitchen where they all were, “You’re worrying so much that even Izuku picked up on it.”

His Dad merely sighed at the words said to him, a hand coming up to rub at the side of his face.

“Sorry, Izuku,” He murmured, the hand dropping down to pat his head, “I didn’t mean to make you worry.”

“It’s okay, Dad,” Izuku leaned into his hand, relaxing at the slight pressure, “If anything happens, I can bite it.”

“... Please don’t bite things, Izuku-kun,” Tsukauchi-san interrupted with a grimace, “You don’t know where they’ve been.”

Oh.

Right.

Tsukauchi-san’s quirk, Lie Detector, was a thing.

It meant he had to be really careful if he got a chance to ask questions about Hisashi and Firebird.

(Lie Detector was such an cool quirk but Izuku already knew that it was gonna get annoying real fast having to work around it at the same time.)

He huffed, but didn’t confirm nor deny anything.

If he didn’t say words, then Tsukauchi-san wouldn’t know if he was lying or not. And Izuku didn’t need him or his parents to know that he was fully willing to bite anyone or anything that might end up in his way.

“We gotta leave now or we’ll run late,” His Papa nudged his Dad, eyes flicking over to the clock, “Let’s get going. Tsukauchi’s already here so we have no reason to stick around too much longer now.”

“You’re right, as always,” His Dad sounded annoyed, “Whatever.”

His Dad removed his hand from his head and made his way to the front door along with his Papa.

Izuku followed them (noticing that Tsukauchi-san also came with him) wanting to say ‘bye’ to them before they actually had to go.

His Dad was getting dressed, shoving his feet into his boots as his Papa watched, tapping away on his phone.

As soon as they were ready, his Dad bent down into a crouch, a hint of worry still his eyes.

"Be good for Tsuakuchi, okay?”

“I’m always good, Dad,” He replied cheekily, attempting to get his Dad to lighten up, “You don’t need to worry.”

“And that’s what I’m worried about,” His Dad replied, though this time, he sounded a bit more amused, “We’ll see you in a few hours and you know where all the snacks are, yes?”

“Mhm, and all the escape routes if anything happens,” He added, “And the fire extinguishers too.”

“Good boy.”

Izuku could feel the grin on his face; his Dad’s praise never got old for him.

“Bye, Dad,” He stepped forward to hug his Dad, his Dad’s arms rising up to hug him back, And Papa too.” His Dad’s arms picked him up, passing him over to his Papa, “Papa, here’s one for the road.”

His Papa cooed as he dropped a kiss onto his cheek, immediately turning to give him one in return before placing him back onto the floor.

“I can barely wait to be back, ‘Zuku!”He waggled a finger at him, winking as he did so, “Be good and we’ll bring you back dessert!"

Dessert!

His Papa always knew the best places to get dessert.

“See you in a bit, Aizawa, Yamada,” Tsukauchi-san said from behind him, “Izuku-kun is in good hands.”

Izuku nodded, waving as they both left, the door locking behind them and leaving both him and Tsukauchi-san alone in their apartment.

Awkward.

While it was not the first time he had been alone with others that weren’t his parents, Tsukauchi-san wasn’t someone he really knew that well either.

Tsukauchi-san was not Nedzu-san.

He wasn’t even like Ecto-san or Snipe-san!

(Izuku would even rather have Iida-san be the one here instead. At least there was a chance that he would bring Tenya over to play if he was also here. And as for Kayama-san… He still wasn’t too sure he wanted to be alone with her yet.)

“So, Izuku-kun,” Tsukauchi-san’s voice was kind though, so maybe he should give him a chance; it was what he was owed since he did bite him once before, “What do you do for fun around here?”

But even so, he had a mission.

“I’ll show you.”

Naomasa regretted asking.

It was odd.

Questions were things he asked daily, whether it was job-related or not, but this was one of the few times that he wished he had never opened his mouth to ask.

Perhaps if he had never asked, he wouldn’t have been put into the position of sitting around the coffee table with Izuku-kun and his tiny army of toys.

At least he had coffee.

It was the good stuff from last time too.

He had a feeling that it was put out in the open just for this purpose. While he didn’t know if Aizawa or Yamada ever got roped into ‘tea parties’ with their kid, he wouldn’t be surprised if they suspected this might happen with him babysitting.

While Izuku-kun was indeed just a child, only turning eight a few months ago, he was much more shrewd than he had given him credit for. Naomasa could recognize his dodging of questions easily, usually choosing not to reply or to deflect it, asking him something instead.

He was a smart kid, but he was only a kid, so he humored him, answering some of the more harmless questions before asking some of his own.

Izuku-kun was pretty keen on his toys, so he tried to keep most of his targeted questions in that direction, hoping that it would distract him whatever his original goal was.

Naomasa had a suspicion on what it was already, but without ample evidence, he had no reason to stop the line of questioning.

“So, Tsukauchi-san,” Izuku-kun started, carefully sipping at the apple juice he had helped pour out for him, “How’s work?”

“Work is work, Izuku-kun,” He replied as politely as he could, taking a gulp of coffee, “Not that interesting or anything you need to worry about yet.”

Big green eyes stared him down and he had to wonder if he was playing with fire, dancing around with his answers like this.

However, he saw no other way he could approach this situation.

There was no doubt in his mind that Aizawa would have his head if he shared anything that Izuku-kun wasn’t supposed to know.

Izuku-kun, for as much as he looked like an innocent child at times, had lived on the streets for over a year, and even now, there was an edged look in his eyes that told him that he was much more than just the “well-behaved child” that Aizawa had told him he was.

(And it did not help that there was ‘Nedzu-san’ staring up at him with button eyes as he drank his coffee. As far as he knew, Nedzu didn’t have an official plush, so this could only be a well-made knockoff, or… Well… He didn’t want to think about the other option.)

“Is anything new happening with work?” Izuku-kun tried again, a bit more tentatively and don’t get him wrong, he was always a supporter of allowing children opportunities to learn, but he was certain that whatever Izuku-kun was after was not the typical sort of information that kids would want to know about his job, “Did you catch any interesting criminals?”

“Izuku-kun, you make my work sound much more interesting than it actually is,” He put down his cup, making a note to return to the coffee machine for another cup soon, “A lot of it is just paperwork like you see here.”

Gesturing down at his bag, he did his best to not think of all the paperwork he was bringing home later to work on. He was tempted to take some of it out and do it while Izuku-kun was having his tea party or war council, or whatever this happened to be, but he knew that he promised Aizawa he’d keep both eyes on him, and that was what he was planning on doing.

“Paperwork’s boring,” Izuku-kun finally huffed, seemingly losing interest in questioning him; Naomasa ignored his quirk pinging ‘truth’ as he did his best to not meet the gaze of any of the toys around the table, “Do you want a snack?”

“A snack?”

“‘Cause you’re a guest right now.”

“I… see,” He did his best to not sound confused, “I would not mind a snack.”

“Okay!” Izuku-kun stood up and headed towards the snack cabinet that Aizawa had shown him, opening it and starting to rummage through the well-stocked shelves, “I’ll go get something for us!” He paused, turning his head to look back at him, “Actually… Do you have anything you can’t eat?”

Oh, well that was thoughtful of him to ask.

“No, I don’t have any food allergies,” He easily replied, wondering what Izuku-kun would bring back for him, “And I’m not very picky with what I eat.”

Izuku-kun hummed, finally pulling out his choice for today’s snack.

Naomasa took this chance to refill his cup with more coffee, letting out a happy sigh as sipped the still-hot liquid.

“You must like coffee as much as my Dad,” Izuku-kun piped up from next to him, handing him a small packet of dried sardines and peanuts before retreating back to the coffee table with his own packet, “Adults are weird with coffee.”

Well, he didn’t like that his quirk told him that Izuku-kun was telling him the truth, and he was not weird with coffee! Not at all! It wasn’t his fault that Aizawa had just about the best coffee ever available for consumption. He was just taking advantage of his current situation like anyone else would do.

By the time he got back to the table, carefully sitting down onto the rug, Izuku-kun had already opened his own packet up, distributing the contents on napkins he had placed in front of his toys.

“One for me,” Izuku-kun chomped down on the head of the anchovy, separating it from the body before tossing the body into his mouth as well, “One for Nedzu-san,” He placed an anchovy in front of the plush white principal of U.A. “And one for Kugo-san and one for Real Mick!”

More anchovies were distributed.

Naomasa had never thought he’d say this about a toy, but that Real Mick toy was unnerving. What was it about that wide and crooked grin that made him want to place the figurine into the back of a closet, never to be seen again. It was a real pity that it was what Izuku-kun had to represent Present Mic because he had seen some of the Present Mic figurines out there and some of them looked very accurate.

“Did you know that orcas don’t eat owls, but they do eat seagulls?” Izuku-kun said as he started to distribute the peanuts next, pausing and placing an extra fish on 'Kugo-san's' napkin, “They taste stringy and horrible.”

‘Truth’

He really didn’t need to know that.

“I hope you didn’t eat a seagull, Izuku-kun,” He sighed, doing his best to not think of what else he knew that Izuku-kun had eaten back when he had been in the streets, “They eat trash so they’re not good for you.”

A wrinkled nose was his only reply.

Great.

He opened the snack that Izuku-kun had given him, ready to tuck in, when his phone rang.

 

That wasn’t right.

Naomasa always switched his phone to silent after he finished his shifts.

This could only mean…

“Izuku-kun,” He addressed the wide-eyed child sitting across from him, still chewing on a fish head, “Please excuse me for a moment.”

He stood and made his way to the front door, hoping this was far enough for him to not be overheard. A quick look at his phone revealed the caller to be Sansa, and that he really needed to charge his phone.

Sansa?

Just what could have happened for Sansa to be calling him when he knew that he was off-duty?

“Sansa,” He picked up the call, keeping his voice as low as he could as he spoke, “What’s the emergency?”

“Detective,” Sansa’s voice was also low, though he could still hear the small tinkle of the bell he wore around his neck, “We just took someone into our custody.”

Naomasa hummed, waiting for the actual reason that Sansa had contacted him.

“They’re an arsonist,” He continued, “From Firebird.”

Oh.

 

Oh shit.

“I’ll be right over, Sansa,” He ordered, “Make sure that they’re contained in the meantime.”

“Understood.”

He hung up.

Shit.

What was he going to do?

This was the lead he had been looking for.

With this, there was a chance that he could finally put together more information on Firebird and its associates.

He needed to get back to the precinct as soon as possible.

“Are you going, Tsukauchi-san?” Izuku-kun stared up at him from the other end of the short hallway, Nedzu-san held under one of his arms, “Is it work?”

“I, Izuku-kun,” Oh no; in his haste, he had forgotten he was currently babysitting, “I’ll call your emergency contact.”

“You can’t,” Izuku-kun interrupted him, holding up Nedzu-san properly now, “Nedzu-san is very busy with meetings right now, so you can’t bother him.” He stepped closer and Naomasa had to stop himself from stepping back, realizing that Nedzu and Izuku-kun’s relationship was way closer than he originally thought, the faint ping of ‘truth’ echoing in his brain. “You wouldn’t wanna bother Nedzu-san when he’s doing his important work, would you, Tsukauchi-san?”

No.

He really would rather not.

Everybody had heard rumors about how ruthless and nasty Nedzu could get at times. He was an incredibly capable pro, but Tsukauchi would never want to be on the opposing end of that beady stare.

“You can just take me with you,” Izuku-kun then chirped, “‘Cause my Dad and Papa will be really mad if you leave me alone here.”

Another ‘truth’.

Well, he didn’t need Izuku-kun’s words to know that Aizawa and Yamada would be fucking irate with him if he did leave their son home alone after promising to keep an eye out for him.

There was only one choice here.

“Alright, Izuku-kun,” Naomasa conceded, “The call was work-related and I do need to go in quickly for something.” He unclenched his hand around his phone, sliding it into his back pocket, “And you’re right in saying that I cannot leave you here alone.”

“So you’re gonna bring me with you.”

“I’ll be taking you along with me.”

Izuku-kun grinned at him, eyes bright and sharp.

“I’ll bring more snacks.”

(Just what was Aizawa and Yamada raising in their home?)

Naomasa could only watch as Izuku-kun left, presumably to pack for their short trip, quickly following behind him to grab his bag of paperwork and his pack of opened snacks.

And his coffee.

He really needed his fucking coffee.

“Here,” A hand pulled at his sleeve and he looked down at the key being pushed into his palm, “For the front door so we don’t get robbed.”

Right.

 

“Thank you, Izuku-kun,” He took the key, rubbing the dirt off from the grooves, “I’ll keep this safe until we return.”

It didn’t take long for them to get ready

As he locked the door behind them, placing the key in his jacket’s inner pocket, he watched as Izuku-kun made sure his backpack’s zipper was fully closed, before swinging it onto his back snugly.

“Come along now, Izuku-kun,” He ushered the two of them into the elevator and gave him a stern look, “Please behave yourself while we’re there.”

“I’ll be good,” Izuku-kun gave him a smile, one that vaguely reminded him of Yamada’s, “I don’t get in trouble on purpose, ya know.”

Naomasa knew that it was the ‘truth’ he was speaking so he allowed himself to relax just a bit.

As he then led Izuku-kun to his car, opening the back door for him to use, then shoving himself into the front seat, he realized something.

He had thought that Izuku-kun had been modeling himself after Aizawa for the most part. But after the last half an hour, he wasn’t quite so sure of his assumption anymore. How Izuku-kun spoke, that sheer confidence and smoothness in his speech at times… That was all Yamada.

“Tsukauchi-san?” Izuku-kun spoke as he buckled himself in with practiced hands, “Make sure you don’t drive over the speed limit or you’ll get into trouble.”

Naomasa had never hated his quirk more than right in this exact moment.

“Right,” He managed to say calmly; wow, he was so calm, “Actually, Izuku-kun, the drive will be pretty boring for you, so why don’t you play some games on my phone as I get us there.”

Taking his phone out of his pocket, he handed it over to Izuku-kun after opening the folder that he kept all his games in, allowing him to choose whatever he wanted to play.

“Mm,” Izuku-kun immediately started to scroll down the short list there, “Thank you, Tsukauchi-san.”

And then it was blissfully quiet.

Right.

He needed to get his thoughts in order before anything else.

Sansa was waiting for him with a lead.

A lead he sorely needed.

Said lead would definitely be able to give him more insight on the Midoriya Hisashi case.

Midoriya Hisashi’s biological child was in his backseat playing on his phone.

 

This was a train wreck waiting to happen.

 

No, this would be fine.

He could put Izuku-kun in his office and leave him under Sansa’s careful watch as he went through with the interrogation.

It would work out fine.

The drive continued to be quiet. He was glad that there didn’t seem to be much traffic because right now, he really didn’t want to have to deal with a longer drive than necessary.

“Tsukauchi-san?” Izuku-kun’s voice was low, nearly a whisper, “You should probably tell my dads that we went out.”

Oh.

Izuku-kun was right.

Naomasa quickly scanned the signals ahead of him.

“Hand the phone to me when we hit the next stop light.”

“Mm.”

When he next stopped, Izuku-kun was already leaning forward with his phone, the seatbelt looking like it wanted to snap him back into his seat.

Taking it and noting that the battery was now at a measly single digit percentage, he quickly tapped out a text to Aizawa, barely managing to send it before his phone went dark.

“Your phone died, Tsukauchi-san.”

‘Truth’

“Please let me focus on driving, Izuku-kun.”

“Okay.”

[18:37] I’m bringing Izuku-kun down to the station.

    And Lie Detector can be such an annoying quirk at times lmao; poor Tsukauchi is very frazzled and not thinking very straight when sending that text.

Chapter Text

Izuku was pleased.

While his original plan of questioning Tsukauchi-san hadn't really given him any new information, it had somehow all worked out anyway!

It was a shame though; Izuku was almost certain that with a bit more time, he totally could have gotten Tsukauchi-san to talk a bit more about his work.

However, this worked out fine enough.

(And he had a chance to play on the hat-man's phone! Not that he was able to play much on it since it had run out of power almost immediately after he had remembered to remind Tsukauchi-san to keep his parents up-to-date with what was happening. He really didn't wanna worry them if it was possible. The hat-man had reassured him that his text had gone through before his phone died, so they would know where they were if they needed to find or contact them.)

But it was a bit of a boring drive, if he had to be honest. Tsukauchi-san needed the quiet to focus on driving which meant that they couldn't put on his Papa's radio show and sing along.

 

Izuku had actually never been to where the hat-man worked.

He knew that his Dad went there for meetings sometimes and it was likely his Papa also knew, but they had never needed to bring him along, so he had never gone with them.

(Which was all good and well as well! Izuku didn’t exactly want to go to the police station either. He remembered that his Dad had warned him that if he was caught stealing knives again or interfering with hero work, it would be where he would have to live for a night. It didn’t sound like a fun time.)

When they finally arrived, Tsukauchi quickly parked them into an available parking space and opened the door for him to slide out. Izuku made sure he remembered to bring his backpack along since he had taken it off while in the car, not wanting to squish its contents.

“Remember what I said earlier?”

Tsukauchi-san put on his hat as he asked (finally turning into his true form!).

Izuku gave him his best smile and nodded quickly.

He had too much riding on this opportunity for Tsukauchi-san to change his mind and bring him back home again.

(And it wasn’t as if he was planning on doing anything bad while they were there. So he really had nothing to worry about.)

“Let’s get going then, Izuku-kun,” Tsukauchi-san offered him a hand and Izuku took it, “This shouldn’t take too long to get settled.”

Izuku hoped so too.

While he was much less wary of the police than back then, he still didn’t exactly like them. The only reason he had even suggested coming along was that he knew that if he didn’t, he was allowing himself to miss out on good information. And that was something he didn’t want to regret later on.

It immediately quietened as they both entered the building.

He could feel all the eyes looking at him and Tsukauchi-san; it reminded him of when he’d get sighted at school, making him want to squirm and hide behind the nearest trusted adult.

But even if he was willing to have Tsukauchi-san as a babysitter, it didn’t necessarily mean that he was a trusted adult.

“Tsukauchi,” The person sitting at the front desk greeted the hat-man with a sigh, “Didn’t you just get off your shift?”

“Well, yes,” Tsukauchi-san blanched, his grip tightening just a bit, “But erm, don’t mind me.” Izuku tightened his grip as well, a silent reminder to the hat-man that his hand was much bigger than his own and that he needed to let up, “I’ll get out of your hair now.”

“Wait, who’s the kid?”

“I’m babysitting!”

With a tug, Tsukauchi-san escaped with him into the nearby hallway, finally letting go of his hand with a small apology.

That was alright; Izuku had already forgiven him.

“You got into trouble,” Tsukauchi-san looked very tired at his statement, “I thought your work asked you to come back?”

“Not exactly,” Izuku followed Tsukauchi-san down the hallway, making sure to stay close by, not wanting to get lost in a new and strange place, “One of my colleagues contacted me knowing that I have vested interest in this case.”

The Firebird case…

 

Tsukauchi-san had once told him that he would do his best to bring him and his Mama justice.

Just knowing that he was still trying his best made him feel happy.

(His Dad had told him that not much evidence had been gathered yet and even information on their organization and members was minimal. They were very good at keeping their secrets, Izuku thought. It made sense though; apparently they had been around for a very long time.)

“And here we are,” Tsukauchi-san quickly unlocked the door to the room they arrived at, “This is my office.”

Tsukauchi-san’s office wasn’t very impressive.

Papers were strewn all over the desk and Izuku could smell the scent of cold coffee from the mug there as well.

“It’s messy,” He told him, “You should keep things more organized ‘cause if you don’t, it’ll be hard to find later.”

“Thank you for the advice, Izuku-kun,” Tsukauchi-san gave him a pat on the head, “Believe it or not, I do know where most of what I need is.”

Izuku did not believe him, but it wasn’t his problem if Tsukauchi-san ended up wasting time looking for some of his work later.

Tsukauchi-san dropped his bag on his desk, the resounding ‘thump’ surprising him. That was a lot of paperwork he had in there. Even his Papa didn’t have that much and he had two jobs!

“Izuku-kun,” Tsukauchi-san patted the chair behind the desk, “You can sit in my chair while you’re in here.” He picked up some of the papers there, stacking them into a pile. "I'm going to ask a colleague to watch you while I deal with work, alright, Izuku-kun?"

“I thought I heard your voice just now,” A new (but familiar) voice interrupted as he made his way into the surprisingly plush chair after agreeing to the hat-man's request, “You got here quick.”

“Sansa,” Tsukauchi-san sounded happy, “I was just going to look for you.”

It was a name he recognized.

This was the person that had been on the phone with the hat-man.

And then they walked in.

 

It was the cat-human.

“Oh,” The cat-human blinked at him, and then sniffed at the air, “Why do you smell like fish?”

Did he smell the snack he had earlier?

Izuku quickly breathed out into his palm and sniffed.

Definitely possible.

“Oh, that’s right,” Tsukauchi-san pulled out the pack of uneaten snacks from his pocket, “I didn’t have a chance to eat these.” Izuku noticed the cat-human’s nose wiggle in his direction. “Would you like some, Sansa?”

Well, that was rude.

Izuku had given them to him for him to eat. Wouldn’t he be hungry like this? Especially since he had to go back to work so soon.

However, Izuku knew that cats did like fish. And that this cat-human worked with Tsukauchi-san at least one other time. So it was possible that besides being coworkers, they were also…friends?

If Tsukauchi-san was just wanting to share with his friend, then he would be alright with that.

But that meant that Tsukauchi-san would be hungry and working at the same time.

(Adults were so silly sometimes, not paying attention to what their body needed. His Dad was the same way sometimes, or so his Papa said. So it was important to remind his Dad that it was snack time if he forgot because hunger made people grouchy and he didn’t want his Dad to be grouchy if he could prevent it.)

“Tsukauchi-san,” He called his name as the cat-human chewed on a small fish, “Take this.”

Izuku offered him a jelly pouch, shaking it in his grasp when it wasn’t taken from him.

“What’s this, Izuku-kun?”

“It’s a jelly pouch,” He explained, wondering if Tsukauchi-san ever had a jelly pouch. It was so sad if he hadn’t. It was his duty to share how tasty these were to someone who had never had it before, “And it’s blueberry flavored.” The jelly pouch was finally taken from him, “And it has lots of nutrients and minerals and even e-lec-tro-lytes!”

This specific kind of jelly pouch was one the ones that his Dad would take with him on patrol sometimes. He was sure his Dad wouldn’t be mad if he shared one with his babysitter.

“Ah, thank you then,” Tsukauchi-san gave him a smile, “It’s appreciated.”

“Cute kid,” The cat-human finally brought their attention to him, “Why’d you bring them here though?”

“It’s ‘cause Tsukauchi-san was in a rush and my emergency contact is really busy right now,” Izuku answered for him, “And I can’t be left home alone.”

Tsukauchi-san just looked tired hearing his words.

“Izuku-kun, this is Tamakawa Sansa,” He gestured over at the cat-human, “We work together.” Izuku nodded, making sure to remember the name. “And Sansa, this is Aizawa Izuku-kun.”

“Aizawa-kun, it’s nice to meet you,” Tamakawa-san gave him a small nod of the head, whiskers twitching, “I’m glad to see you’re doing well.”

Oh, he didn’t expect to be recognized.

Izuku didn’t like thinking about that night he had nearly gotten shot, but he remembered that Tamakawa-san was one of the people there.

“Are they ready?” Tsukauchi-san then asked in a hushed voice, getting a nod from Tamakawa-san; immediately, Izuku knew what he was talking about. It just had to be about the Firebird person they had caught, “Good, then I’ll go get started.” He headed out the door, pausing before stepping over the threshold of the door, “Sansa, could you please watch Izuku while I’m gone?”

“Sure thing,” Tamakawa-san nodded, the bell around his neck ringing. Izuku idly wondered what that bell did. Did it even have a purpose? It just wasn’t logical for it to be worn for no reason, so maybe it was something that enabled him to use his quirk? But him being a cat-man was his quirk, wasn’t it? Well maybe he could ask him about his quirk later and then he could add it into his notebook. He knew that Nedzu-san’s quirk had nothing to do with his being an animal after all… This could be similar, in a way, “I’ll keep an eye on the kid.”

Izuku had expected that he wouldn’t have the freedom of movement while at the police station, but he didn’t need to be able to move around to listen to things happening around him.

With his quirk, he knew that he would be able to hear anything that would be said.

(He also knew that it would probably be difficult. There were a lot of people that he saw even as they walked in and the police station seemed like a busy place. If there were more people around, all making their own noises, it would definitely be harder to tell who was saying or doing what.)

“See you later, Tsukauchi-san,” He waved at the hat-man before he could leave fully, “Remember to drink your jelly pouch.”

“I will, Izuku-kun,” Tsukauchi-san finally stepped out and closed the door behind him, “I’ll be back before you know it.”

And then he was gone, leaving him in the room alone with Tamakawa-san.

Izuku resisted the urge to immediately spin in the chair he was sitting in. Spinny chairs were the best and while Nedzu-san allowed him to spin in his office chair sometimes, it wasn’t as often as he would like.

But doing that with the eyes of a stranger on him?

No thanks.

That was just super awkward and he didn't know if Tamakawa-san would tell him to stop or not. It was better he just didn't do it and just avoided the whole potential conversation in general.

(Plus, it was more than possible that whatever he did, they would tell his dads about. And he had told them that he would be good! He didn’t want to give them any reason to think otherwise.)

But it wasn’t as if that mattered right now.

What mattered was activating his quirk and listening in on whoever Tsukauchi-san was going to be talking to.

(Could it be Hisashi that they had locked up? Izuku thought if it was, he’d recognize his voice immediately. After all, it was something he heard in his nightmares often enough. There would be no way he wouldn’t recognize it.)

The good thing was that he was getting really good at activating bits of his quirk and getting better at deactivating it too! And from what he could tell, most people didn’t even realize he had his owl hearing activated unless he mentioned it. That meant that unless he was really obvious about it, Tamakawa-san shouldn’t even realize that his quirk was active.

(It was a different story with his sight and talons though. His wings were probably the most obvious if he managed to bring those out. They were impossible to bring out on their own without everything else coming along with it. He was starting to think that his wings were just like that.)

He took his notebook out from his bag, placed it on the desk and got ready to work.

Tamakawa-san had turned away from him, fiddling with the coffee machine.

(Adults and their coffee!)

Izuku activated his quirk, the sounds of voices immediately growing louder to him. He grabbed a pen from the cup on the hat-man’s desk, scribbling on the corner of an empty notepad to see if it still had ink in it. If he wanted to hide his quirk usage, it was better to look like he was busy with something else.

(Nedzu-san had always told him that it was better to be underestimated. There was no reason that he should let strangers know more about his quirk than necessary!)

He wasn’t that surprised when it turned out that the pen barely had any ink in it. Tsukauchi-san must have used up this pen’s ink while doing his paperwork. Izuku was tempted to place the empty pen back into the cup, but decided to just place it on the side. There were so many pens in the cup that he didn’t want it getting mixed in with the other pens.

While he was here though, he might as well check on the status of all these other pens. Tsukauchi-san would be wasting so much time if he had to look for pens with ink to use later.

Izuku poured out the contents of the cup, the sharp clattering sound nearly making him wince. He could feel Tamakawa-san’s eyes on him, curious, but he ignored it, going ahead and grabbing the closest pen to him and doodling out whatever came first to mind.

(And if it was his parents and then his friends that popped up in his mind first, that was his own business.)

Going through all the pens took a while.

There were just a lot of pens.

(Izuku wondered why he needed that many in the first place, but he figured that with Tsukauchi-san never knowing how many were out of ink at a time, it was better to just have a lot of them in his cup.)

Out of them all, he found that there were five that were empty. He separated those from the ones that still had ink in them, because apparently unlike that hat-man, he liked to know which ones had to be thrown away later.

“Is that me?” Tamakawa-san asked, his voice uncomfortably loud to him; he wasn’t counting on people actually wanting to talk to him here, shaking his head to get rid of the small ringing echoing in his head, “No?”

“No,” Izuku blurted out. No, wait! That was too suspicious to just say, especially since it was Tamakawa-san that he doodled in his notebook, “Uh, I mean, maybe?”

Tamakawa-san blinked at him and Izuku could feel his talons wanting to come out.

Oh no.

Tamakawa-san might look like a cat, but he was very much not a cat.

He was a cat-human!

And this place was a part of his territory, which meant that Izuku was the guest here. He had to keep his owl instincts in check before anything else happened.

Now that he wasn’t distracted by all the pens, he realized that he hadn’t really heard Tsukauchi-san’s voice at all ever since he had activated his quirk.

That was weird.

Unless Tsukauchi-san went really far away or into the basement or something, Izuku was sure he’d be able to hear him.

Maybe it was already over?

Had he missed the entire thing because he had gotten distracted?

Izuku squinted as he tapped the edge of his page with a pen, trying to listen in on the nearest conversation.

“That Tsukauchi is a real workaholic, running back here barely even an hour after his shift ended.”

"I wonder what made him come back in such a rush."

"Rumor has it that he’s trying to get a solid lead on that arsonist case that’s been making a resurgence. It’s all on the hush-hush, of course."

This was all very interesting, but this was not what he wanted to know.

He focused again, tilting his head just so, tuning what he didn’t need to hear out.

“Wonder if Tsukauchi’s gotten anything good out of the guy yet.”

Oh!

Yes, this was what he wanted.

“Dunno, but Tsukauchi is one of the best of us when it comes to this. I wouldn’t worry too much.”

“What I wouldn’t give to be a fly on that wall.”

A laugh sounded out.

“It’d be the only way we’d get to know what’s going on in there. Soundproof walls and such for privacy reasons, you know.”

“Yeah, I know. Doesn’t hurt to wish though.”

Soundproof walls?!

Was that the reason why he couldn’t hear Tsukauchi-san at all?

“Erm, Aizawa-kun,” Tamakawa-san took the seat across from him, coffee in hand, “Your forehead is all scrunched up. Is something the matter?”

This wasn’t good!

He needed to think of something that would make him look like he wasn’t suspicious at all and get him closer to that interrogation room.

(The room was soundproof, but his owl hearing was really good. Maybe he would be able to hear a little bit if he got close enough?)

“I…” His mind raced. But what could he say? “I gotta go to the bathroom!”

Tamakawa-san looked at him blankly and Izuku could feel himself pale, completely forgetting to write down Hitoshi’s name next to his drawing. He said it though, so now he had to continue convincing him that he had to actually go.

“I drank too much apple juice earlier…”

“Well, do you need me to walk you there?”

“No,” Izuku bristled, “I can go by myself.”

With that said, Tamakawa-san gave him directions to the nearest bathroom and Izuku thanked him, feeling slightly guilty about how snippy he had been before.

He exited Tsukauchi-san’s office, closing the door behind him.

This was it.

All he had to do now was to figure out where they were interrogating the person from Firebird!

He could do this!

Izuku quickly rushed down the hallway, making sure to stop by the bathroom before continuing on.

He wasn’t planning on getting caught, but it didn’t hurt to make sure he wasn’t caught up in a lie when the hat-man was involved.

Shouta usually wasn’t that attached to his phone.

He used it for work and for keeping in contact with the friends and acquaintances he had, but it wasn’t something he always kept an eye on, waiting for the newest notification.

This day was different though.

It had started when he had glimpsed down at his phone, seeing Tsukauchi’s name. He had opened the notification, wondering what the man had decided to text him about.

Shouta hadn’t expected something of this proportion.

[18:37] I’m bringing Izuku-kun down to the station.

[18:38] Excuse me?

[18:38] Do you want to clarify, Tsukauchi.

[18:39] What did Izuku do?

[18:40] Hey, pick up the phone.

[18:41] Tsukauchi, I swear if you don’t pick up the phone this instant, we are going to have words.

[18:43] We are going to have words. We’ll be meeting you out back.

“Shouta!”

Hizashi was keeping pace with him after they had both excused themselves after barely half an hour of karaoke; he’d have to make it up to them some other time.

“I know you’re mad but you need to slow down just a bit.” He grumbled at the words said to him and stopped at the next crosswalk, allowing the cars to pass him by, “Izuku needs us at our best and if you get hit by a car, it’s not gonna help the situation he’s in.”

The situation Izuku was in...

How did this even happen?

Izuku knew enough of the law and had the common sense to keep himself out of trouble for the most part.

And Shouta didn’t doubt that Izuku was smart enough to not get himself arrested.

So what had even happened in the short amount of time that Tsukauchi had been babysitting?

“We’re close,” Hizashi murmured; Shouta could see the blatant worry in his eyes, “Just a few more blocks.”

He could see the building coming up closer with every step.

Izuku was somewhere in there.

Tsukauchi, at least, probably had enough humanity to keep Izuku in one of the nicer cells. But that didn’t change that it was still a cell. And that Izuku hadn’t contacted him or Hizashi? Those were just warning signs.

(If there was something he was absolutely certain of, it was that Izuku would know to contact them immediately following any sort of big trouble like this. The fact that he hadn’t… Not good.)

“C’mon, Shou, let’s get our fightin’ faces on,” Hizashi looked like he was about to bite someone’s head off; it was likely going to be Tsukauchi’s head which, well, he wasn’t going to complain, “Let’s go get our son.”

Woe befall anyone that stood in his husband’s way.

Shouta grunted his agreement.

They stepped in together.

It seemed normal enough, nothing that signified that a child had gotten arrested recently.

Shouta couldn’t help but wonder which holding cell his son was currently in.

“Eraser?” Aoki, who was manning the front desk, acknowledged his presence with a nod, “Didn’t realize you had an early shift today.”

“Where’s Tsukauchi?”

“In interrogation probably, so you’ll need to wait if you want to see him,” Aoki-san easily replied, “How’d you even know he was here?”

Interrogation?

His son was being interrogated?!

“Oh, he told me he was here,” Shouta bared his teeth in a grin, “We need to catch up with recent events.”

“Does it have to do anything with that kid he brought in?”

“Where’s the kid?”

Hizashi cleanly inserted himself in their conversation, jabbing his elbow into his side.

Calm.

Fucking right.

He needed to keep calm for Izuku.

“Dunno,” Aoki continued, pointing behind her down the hallway, “Tsukauchi did seem in a rush. Said he was babysitting or something.”

Huh.

Was that what Tsukauchi called arresting children nowadays?

“Uh. We’ll go wait in his office for him,” Hizashi gave Aoki a weak grin, handing over his hero license before they could ask him for it; Shouta handed his over as well, resisting the urge to snatch it back as soon as their security check was done, wanting to be on their way already, “Thanks.”

Shouta then made his way down the hallway, heading straight to Tsukauchi’s office.

He was tempted to just head down to where he knew the interrogation rooms were, but that was a surefire way to get him kicked out if he interfered.

“Aizawa-kun?”

That was Tamakawa’s voice.

(Odd. He had never given his civilian identity to the man.)

“Oh, Eraserhead?” Shouta turned a corner, sighting Tamakawa who seemed vaguely distressed, “I don’t suppose you’ve seen a small child?”

A small child?

Had they also lost Izuku as well?

“I allowed him to go to the restroom, but he never came back…” Tamakawa murmured, stepping past them, “And he isn’t on this floor.”

“Why don’t we help ya out?” Hizashi followed Tamakawa down the hallway, “Sounds like you have a dilemma on your hands.”

“An extra set of eyes would be helpful, thank you,” Nodding his assent, he made his way to the stairwell, “I’m going to go up a floor. If you two would go down, that would be appreciated.”

Perfect.

That was what he had been planning in the first place.

“C’mon, Hizashi,” Shouta quickly went down the stairs, “Let’s get looking.”

It was getting a bit more complicated, now that he really thought about it.

Had Izuku been in interrogation and then let out to the bathroom and made his escape from there?

Then where was Tsukauchi?

Wouldn’t he also be looking for Izuku?

 

He was never allowing this man to ever babysit again.

“Wait, Shou, slow down,” Hizashi’s voice hissed in his ear, “Where are you going?”

“Interrogation.”

“What?” Confusion laced Hizashi’s tone, “Why?”

“Izuku doesn’t know this place, so chances are that he stayed in the same general area,” It was what he would do and it was what he had told Izuku to do if he ever got lost, “It’s harder to stay hidden if you have to continually find new locations to hide in.”

And Izuku would hide from the police.

It was what he had done back then and he wouldn’t be surprised if it was what he was doing now.

“Oh, shit, is that Izuku?”

What?

Hizashi gestured at the pane of glass that allowed them to peek into the hallway of the floor he had stopped at.

Shouta took a quick glance.

That was Izuku.

He turned his gaze upwards.

And that was an interrogation room, one whose door was opening, right at that second.

Shouta made a split second decision, slamming the door open and sprinting in, his boots making this horrid squeaking sound as he ran, leaving Hizashi to stumble in behind him.

Two officers exited the room, followed by another person he didn’t recognize. Lastly was Tsukauchi.

Quickly, he swept Izuku up into his arms, his son squeaking in surprise and then joy as he checked to see who it was that picked him up.

“Dad!”

“Izuku.”

Tsukauchi also startled.

“Eraser?”

“Tsukauchi.”

…

Hizashi skidded to a stop next to him, taking Izuku into his own arms, allowing him to stand between everyone else and his kid.

There was no way he was leaving anything to chance

“Huh,” The stranger in cuffs gave them an odd look, their unreadable gaze following Izuku, “Kid looks just like the big boss.”

 

“Excuse me?”

Shouta knew his voice was downright frigid

“Don’t talk shit about what you don’t know.”

There was a moment of pure silence.

And then it was chaos.


Notes:

    Hizashi > You didn’t hear that, sweetie,,
    Izuku > Hear what?
    Hizashi > Exactly!
    Izuku > Oh, you meant ‘shit’ :)
    Hizashi >
    Hizashi > This is Shouta’s fault (⭑•͈ 𓎟 •͈ )

    Yes, Izuku did manage to work his way down all the way to the interrogation rooms xD He’s gotten very good at tracking directionally with just his hearing.

    Ah. Hisashi.. The big boss..

    Tsukauchi is, in fact, off the babysitter’s list, and preemptively, so is Tamakawa. RIP. Maybe one day, they can redeem themselves!

    And as always, thank you guys so much for the comments! I read them all! Please continue to let me know your thoughts! <3

    Next chapter comes out June 18th! Full owl training is a go!

Chapter 64: ARC III: Chapter 64: Skies
Notes:

    Chapter Warnings: N/A

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

Izuku’s parents were overprotective.

That wasn’t anything new, but with the most recent thing that they had all found out… Well, he couldn’t really blame them, could he?

Apparently Hisashi was the ‘big boss’ of Firebird and there was a very distinct possibility that now he might know that he was alive and still out there.

This was very bad news.

Izuku didn't like getting scolded, but even he realized it was justified this time.

There was a lot that could have gone wrong.

His Dad had scolded him for not staying put, though he had scolded the hat-man even more for that text and then for not charging his phone as soon as he had the chance to do so.

(Even Tamakawa-san had been given a disappointed look.)

Apparently because of all of that, his parents had thought he had gotten arrested. That did explain why they had suddenly showed up at the precinct when they were supposed to still be with their friends at the karaoke place, but that also meant that they had barely got to spend any time with Iida-san or Kayama-san!

(Not that he regretted anything he did at that time. He had accomplished his original goal of finding out more information about Firebird! Even if what he found out wasn’t to his liking, it was more than he knew before.)

But now he also had to keep his new tracking bracelet on him at all times. His Dad said it also served as a distress beacon just like his other one, and that if anything, and he meant anything, happened, that he was to activate it.

(Izuku couldn’t help but feel a bit peeved. This was all Hisashi’s fault! He hoped that he would get caught and arrested soon and well, it wouldn’t be mean of him to want his Dad or Papa to be the ones to do it. His Papa had barely been able to stop his Dad from punching that Firebird guy at the station, so he wouldn’t be wrong in thinking that if his Papa wasn’t around to stop him, his Dad would definitely punch Hisashi in the face.)

But the cherry on the cake?

He was also grounded.

'So extremely grounded' as his Papa called it.

To be more specific, that meant that he was not allowed to do things like be outside without one of his parents there to watch over him. School was the only exception and even then, his Dad was still on campus.

Izuku guessed that was the other good thing to come out of this whole situation.

After coming home that very evening, his Dad had decided to finally accept Nedzu-san’s offer to eventually become a teacher at U.A.

(His Dad really was good at teaching, so it was only logical that he become a teacher.)

That very night, his Dad and Papa had gone through all the paperwork that Nedzu-san had sent over ‘cause it was always important to know and understand everything you signed. Because if you didn’t read it but signed it anyway, you could be giving up your rights to something but not even know about it.

(And it was also why he knew that if he ever got important papers like those, he needed to give them to his parents to look over first. Izuku knew that he was learning more and more words every day but he was nowhere near his Dad or his Papa’s level of reading. Plus, the way they wrote things on those types of papers always confused him with their wording. It was probably as hard as doing taxes.)

But even though they had found out more about Hisashi and how he was likely even more dangerous than they originally thought, he still did have school the following Wednesday, so after a quick breakfast of miso soup, natto, and rice, both his Dad and Papa took him to school.

(Izuku had a feeling that his Papa would be taking him to school a lot more often now.)

“Alright! We’re here!” His Papa announced as he parked the car, his Dad only yawning in response and motioning for him to take off his seatbelt as he did the same, “I’ll come pick you guys up later, yeah?”

“Okay, Papa,” He leaned forward to get his half-hug and kiss, giving them back in return, “We’ll see you later.”

“Sweetie,” His Papa murmured, a note of worry now present in his voice, “I know U.A. has like top-notch security and all, but you stay safe, okay?”

“I promise,” He knew his Papa was worried about him and his safety, but with Nedzu-san’s security systems, it should be impossible for strangers to even get in, “And Dad is gonna be here too, so he can help if anything happens.”

His Papa’s face scrunched up funnily, like he wanted to say something, but just sighed instead.

“Well, if your Dad is there, then I guess there’s nothing to fear.”

“You look sad, Papa,” He couldn’t stop himself from adding, wanting to comfort his Papa, “Don’t be sad.”

“No, ‘Zuku,” His Papa groaned, “I’m not sad, I just.. I wish I could do more.”

“You drive us to school,” Izuku thought that was pretty great, if he had to be honest, “That means me an’ Dad get to nap on the way there.” And he had never seen his Dad sit behind the driver’s wheel ever either! So either his Dad didn’t know how to or really didn’t like driving. “And you do a lot already besides that.”

His Papa was the busiest person he knew!

Izuku couldn’t even pretend to know how much work went into a radio show. Combining that with the work he did as a pro hero? And even after all of that, he still came home and helped him with his English and read bedtime stories to him… His Papa was the best and he wouldn’t accept anyone else telling him otherwise. Not even his own Papa.

“Oh, Izuku,” A small chuckle brought him out of his thoughts, “You think all of that?”

Ah.

He must have mumbled that all out.

“Your Papa is gonna keep doing his best, okay?” A kiss was dropped onto his forehead after a warm hand smoothed away his bangs, “You just keep focused on your lessons at school and leave all the frettin’ to the adults.”

Izuku nodded; he wasn’t planning on anything else today anyways.

“Let’s get going before you’re late, Izuku,” His Dad was already out of the car waiting for him, “Nedzu doesn’t like lateness.”

That was very true.

So with one last hug, he said ‘bye’ to his Papa and got out of the car, taking his Dad’s hand so they could walk to the school building together.

It was nearing the end of November now, so it was getting a bit cooler, the leaves on the trees falling off, soon to leave the branches they were on naked.

His Dad had told him before that he had actually met him in November, so it was pretty cool to know that he had known his Dad for a whole year now, even though his Dad didn’t know the truth about him back then.

(When he had still been living as an owl, he didn’t even bother keeping track of time passing, so knowing the exact month of when things had happened… Not something he could have known.)

“We’re here, Izuku,” His Dad said as they approached Nedzu-san’s office, “Lessons first and then I’ll be coming over during lunch, alright?”

That was right.

His Dad was gonna tell Nedzu-san that he was gonna accept the job offer.

“I’ll see you later, Dad,” Izuku quickly hugged his Dad, “Tell Snipe-san I’m still waiting for the squirrel, okay?”

“Sure, Izuku,” His Dad replied, already turning to leave, hand up in farewell, “I’ll let him know.”

When Snipe-san brought in the squirrel, Izuku was gonna make sure he saved some for both his Dad and Papa.

They deserved a nice treat!

As soon as he couldn’t see his Dad anymore, he turned to enter Nedzu-san’s office, the door opening for him without him even knocking.

 

Nedzu-san looked very serious as he sat in his chair.

His Dad did warn him yesterday that he had kept Nedzu-san up-to-date with everything relating to his case since U.A. and Nedzu-san, in part, was responsible for his safety during school hours. For Nedzu-san to know the most updated information was important.

“Good morning, Nedzu-sensei.”

He greeted his teacher, hoping that he wasn’t going to also get another scolding on top of the two he had already gotten.

“Good morning, Izuku-kun,” Nedzu-san hopped out of his chair, tapping open the secret classroom so they could both enter, “I’m glad to see you are well.”

Izuku quickly took a seat at his desk, taking his backpack off and pulling out the homework he had completed over the weekend.

“I have a small announcement to make, Izuku-kun,” Nedzu-san took his own seat, paws clasped together, “Starting from today, we shall be focusing a bit more on your quirk in the latter half of our days together.”

His quirk?

That was something new.

Usually, they didn’t focus too much on his own quirk, but instead on quirk theory.

But considering the only big thing that had happened recently, Izuku was sure this was because Nedzu-san wanted him to be able to use his quirk if anything Hisashi or Firebird-related happened.

However, he was able to use his quirk now.

Sort of.

Well, he was able to use some of it and also deactivate it without needing his Dad to use Erasure.

His Papa said that what he could do now was really good considering that he hadn’t even been able to do anything with his quirk even only months ago.

“We aim to be Plus Ultra in everything we do here at U.A.,” Nedzu-san continued, “And that includes quirk usage! It would surely be a good weapon in your arsenal if you ever need to make a quick getaway.”

That was true.

Izuku knew he was much faster flying than running. And people did tend to not look up when searching for others, something he had noticed when his Dad was on patrol and trying to capture people doing crimes.

(And he did love flying. He really missed the feeling of the wind gliding over and around his feathers, the sensation of soaring up high into the night sky, the stars twinkling above him. It would be nice if he could do that again without being thrown out a window..)

“I want to learn how to use my quirk better,” Nedzu-san seemed happy to hear this from him, eyes brightening, “I’ll do my best, Nedzu-sensei!!”

“That is all I expect from you, Izuku-kun.”

And with that said, he passed his homework over and their day began.

Today, Nedzu-san taught him more about how to not get caught when doing reconnaissance.

(Izuku had a feeling it was because he had gotten caught at the police station. Well, with this, he would have a lower chance of getting caught the next time this happened, so he was glad that Nedzu-san was looking out for his future.)

While he was working on writing down his notes, Nedzu-san graded his homework.

“The part where you had to write your replies in English was very well done!” Nedzu-san praised as he handed him back the packet, “You’re picking up on the language very quickly, Izuku-kun. I’m very impressed.”

“My Papa is super good at English,” Izuku took his graded work back, eyes already scanning for any mistakes he might have made, “He’s flu-ent in it and he reads to me every night when he’s home.” Ah, he did some of the math wrong. He would need to ask Ecto-san or Nedzu-san for tips on those. “And he also helps me with words I don’t know. Or if the sentence sounds funny.”

“He always did have top grades in English when he was still attending school here,” Nedzu-san’s eyes gleamed, “You say that he helps you with your homework?”

“Mhm, he’s really smart and good at explaining things so I can understand it,” He nodded, “And he makes it fun too!”

It was always easier to remember things when it was taught in a fun way.

Nedzu-san seemed more than pleased with that response, then took the chance to go over the questions he had gotten wrong, showing him how to do them correctly before giving him a practice question.

They worked on this for a while before something caught his eye.

It was his Dad.

“I see Aizawa-kun is helping out the first years again,” Nedzu-san remarked, apparently having followed him after he went to look out the window, “He does seem to enjoy hammering in those basics.”

“‘Cause basics are important,” He chirped, “If you have a good foun-da-tion, it’ll be easier to build on them with later skills.”

His gymnastics teacher, Suzuhara-sensei, told them that every class, knowing how frustrated they all got at times when they were stuck practicing rolls and handstands and not learning new skills.

“Very true,” Nedzu-san nodded, “And this is why we must continue to build your skill with your quirk, Izuku-kun.”

Oh!

He hadn’t realized it worked that way as well.

Nedzu-san was so smart!

“Now, why don’t we take our lunch break?” Nedzu-san’s eyes crinkled even as his Dad maneuvered a student’s arms behind their back, letting go after a few seconds and waving them away. They all started their cooldown stretches, so Izuku knew that they were going to have lunch soon as well, “Is Aizawa-kun going to join us?”

“Yeah,” Izuku nodded, “He’s gonna bring lunch and he says he has something to talk to you about too.”

Nedzu-san seemed intrigued, his tail swaying gently behind him as he opened the door for him, allowing him entrance to his proper office again.

Izuku immediately flopped onto the small couch by the bookshelf, pulling down a book apparently about the art of war. He opened it to a random page and closed it again. The words in there didn’t look like his native Japanese and nothing like English, so there was no way he would be able to read this.

(Since it was on Nedzu-san’s bookshelf, that meant that Nedzu-san knew more than two languages, right? Wow!)

After a bit of searching, he found a large book full of pictures of pots of tea.

The pictures in it were glossy and nice, the pages smooth to the touch.

He knew Nedzu-san was catching up on some paperwork, so he never liked to bother him during this time, choosing to usually read instead.

Soon enough, his Dad arrived, bentos in hand.

There was one for him, one for his Dad, and one for Nedzu-san!

Izuku could tell Nedzu-san was touched as he carefully opened the cheery pink bento cloth (decorated with mice around the edges), revealing the bento inside. Inside that was a variety of cheese cubes, crackers, and grapes.

“Ah, Aizawa-kun, thank you for bringing me lunch,” Nedzu-san said as he plucked up a cube of cheese, “It’s very much appreciated.”

“It was no trouble, Sensei,” His Dad ducked his head into his capture scarf, “I actually wanted to talk to you about something today, so I was hoping we could talk over lunch.”

“Of course,” Nedzu-san agreed, “This is about the offer I made you, correct?”

“Yes.”

They got talking and though Izuku was somewhat interested in the conversation, he was much more interested in whatever else was on Nedzu-san’s bookshelf.

So after he finished eating, he spent the rest of the lunch break going over the books there, eventually deciding on his favorite, a large encyclopedia with pictures of lots of bugs in it.

(And since he had some free time right now with both his Dad and teacher busy, he decided he would look for his favorite bug, the fucking bug, in this book. However, even though he knew the name of it, he couldn’t find them in the book at all.)

“Well, I am most pleased to have you join us, Aizawa-kun,” Nedzu-san cheered, his voice slightly louder than it had been earlier, holding out a paw outstretched to his Dad, “Welcome to U.A.!”

His Dad honestly looked pretty excited as he took Nedzu-san’s paw in his hand and shook it.

Even though his Dad’s decision was partially because he wanted to be in a better position to protect him, he knew that his Dad really did like helping out Snipe-san’s class.

(Or maybe his Dad also really liked throwing people around. He did that a lot when on his patrol, so it was a definite possibility.)

“Thank you for having me, Sensei,” His Dad looked a bit reluctant to let go, but he did, his hand returning back to his lap. Izuku could sort of understand; Nedzu-san’s paws were very soft to the touch, “I’ll do my best.”

“We can discuss further details when we have a bit more time,” Nedzu-san chuckled, “But know that I believe that you will be a wonderful addition to our faculty here.”

His Dad bowed, his chin nearly entirely disappearing beneath his capture weapon again.

“I’ll make a proper appointment for that talk then,” His Dad stood as he packed the now empty bento boxes away into his bag; he also stood, returning the insect encyclopedia to the shelves, knowing that his Dad was about to leave again, “I’ll be taking my leave now.”

“Dad, maybe you could stay?” He interrupted as he stepped forward, “Nedzu-san says that we’re gonna be working on my quirk later, so…”

Izuku didn’t know if he’d make any progress on it today at all, but to be safe, it was better for his Dad to be here, right? If he somehow did manage to turn into an owl, he wasn’t sure he’d be able to turn back into a human without some form of outside help. And going to school as an owl meant that he wouldn’t be able to hold pencils or erasers without poking holes into them or shattering them with his talons. He really didn’t want to break his school supplies.

“We’ll be meeting up with Tatsuma-kun after lunch at the P.E. Grounds,” Nedzu-san added in, “You may come spectate if you would like.”

“I think I’d like that.”

 

Before he knew it, they had all arrived at the P.E. Grounds, Tatsuma-san already waiting for them by the entrance of the locker rooms dressed in her gym uniform.

“Principal Nedzu,” She greeted Nedzu-san first and then turned to him and his Dad, “Aizawa-san, Izuku-kun.” She gave them a sharp toothed smile, “I hope you are all doing well.”

“I am doing well, Tatsuma-kun!” Nedzu-san replied as his Dad nodded his acknowledgement to her words, “Thank you for agreeing to come on such short notice.”

“Well, I have to admit that I was excited to see Izuku-kun again,” She chuckled, “So I was happy to come.”

“Hi, Tatsuma-san!” Izuku made sure to greet her as well, “It’s nice to see you again.”

“Izuku-kun,” She leaned forward, bangs falling over the right side of her face, “I’m glad to see you’re doing well.”

Yes, he decided after a bit of thought.

Tatsuma-san was a nice person.

“Things are a lot better now,” He nodded, not mentioning that the Hisashi situation did get a bit worse, “Are we gonna see you use your quirk today?”

Unlike last time, they didn’t meet up in Nedzu-san’s office and she was in her gym uniform, so it made sense for there to be a reason why it had to change.

“I’ll be giving a practical demonstration, yes.”

Oh! That was so exciting!

Transformation quirks were rare enough that he hadn’t really seen many of them used besides his own. It was a bit annoying since that meant he didn’t have many examples to study from that weren’t just accounts on paper.

Having the chance to see one used right in front of him?

Awesome.

“Whenever you are ready, Tatsuma-kun,” Nedzu-san gestured to the wide open space the P.E. Grounds gave them, “Feel free to begin.”

Tatsuma-kun gave him a small nod and started to step away from them until she stood a fair distance away.

Just how big was she gonna be?

Izuku quickly sharpened his gaze, not wanting to miss any bit of this.

And then suddenly, the wind picked up around her.

In that moment, he could see her transform, human skin now scales, fingers replaced with dangerously sharp claws. Powerful wings were outstretched, her wingspan something he could barely fathom when compared with his own.

He could only look up with wonder at the smooth transformation that she had once described to him.

She was huge.

(Izuku now understood what she meant when she said that she wouldn’t fit in Nedzu-san’s office. She probably wouldn’t even fit into five of Nedzu-san’s offices.)

“What do you think?” Tatsuma-san’s voice was now a deep rumble, “This is my quirk, Dragon.”

So cool.

Izuku made a promise to himself that afternoon after Tatsuma-san had offered to allow him to ride her for a short flight.

The skies were something that were still within his reach.

He would master his quirk no matter how long it took.

    Little does Izuku know, pillbugs are crustaceans. Hizashi doesn't know either xD And he doesn't care enough to read up on them to find out.

    Izuku's opinions on his Dad becoming a teacher is split cleanly between 'my Dad likes to teach' and 'or maybe my Dad likes violence'.

    Also Shouta has now touched the forbidden beans and he's just... He's having a moment there, alright?

    And as always, thank you guys so much for the comments! I read them all! Please continue to let me know your thoughts! <3

Chapter Text

It was early Thursday morning when Izuku realized something important.

Something so important and distressing that he had then dropped his pencil and proceeded to bang his head on the underside of his desk while trying to pick it up.

“Are you alright?” Nedzu-san looked up the book he was reading aloud to him from, ears twitching at the bang, “You look upset.”

“Can we finish this first?” He asked, not wanting to interrupt his lessons for something entirely unrelated, “Please?”

Nedzu-san had given him a curious look, but nodded and continued to read to him.

It really was interesting stuff, all about how quirks had slowly evolved over generations, how it could be that quirks were only getting more and more powerful and getting harder to control. Nedzu-san called it a theory, and one that wasn’t very popular even.

“However, we are here to learn,” Nedzu-san concluded their morning lesson after summarizing the points of the theory and then handed him a pop quiz regarding the lesson they had yesterday. Ugh, he did not like pop quizzes, “There is always something you can take away from even the most fringe of theories.”

(Izuku did think the theory could really be accurate. Even though he hadn’t spoken with Todoroki-san again after meeting him that one time in Shuuzenji-san’s infirmary, he never forgot what he had overheard there. That Todoroki-san’s quirk was strong enough to hurt himself. It really got him to thinking more about his quirk and how Owl had been so difficult for him to get even the slightest bit of control over originally. It was only with all the practice he did that he was able to use some of his quirk and he still had a ways to go.)

As he read through the pop quiz, he decided to do the questions he definitely knew the answers to first.

The scratching of the pencil against paper lulled him as he quickly answered what rights he would have after getting, like for real, arrested.

(This lesson had been one he easily remembered since his Dad had also gone over this with him as well.)

“Alright,” Nedzu-san said just as he scribbled in the last of his answer, “Time is up!”

Izuku handed in his pop quiz, knowing he had done decently well on it.

His Dad would be happy to know he remembered everything he was told.

“Now, Izuku-kun,” Nedzu-san slid his quiz into the folder sitting on his desk; it would be handed back to him the next time he had school, “Would you like to tell me about what troubled you earlier today?”

Izuku chewed on his bottom lip, wondering if he should bother sharing his worries. He knew Nedzu-san would worry though. And Nedzu-san was smart, so maybe he'd be able to help him figure something out.

“Hitoshi is gonna be really sad if we don’t show up at the park on Saturday,” He had groaned in the privacy of his classroom while he and Nedzu-san took a short break so Nedzu-san could prepare for the next lesson, “What if he hates me?”

Because he had gotten into trouble and was grounded, he was no longer allowed to go to the park alone with Nedzu-san. And since his Dad was now working at U.A., he couldn’t take him to the park either since it would be cutting into his work hours.

“You can just reschedule your meeting, Izuku-kun,” Nedzu-san said as he looked through some paperwork, “Instead of going after lunch, you can go after lessons are over.” He scribbled down his signature, placing that sheet aside in favor of one under it. “Aizawa-kun will be done with his shadowing by the time we are done for the day.”

“But the park gets so much busier around that time,” Recalling all the times that he had walked past that park after school made him sigh, “And Hitoshi doesn’t like being around that many people.”

“Then you’ll just have to find a different location to meet up in, won’t you?”

Oh!

That was a very good idea.

Because he couldn’t go to the park, the next best place would have to be Hitoshi’s home. It was a place he would feel comfortable in and that was very important since Hitoshi didn’t like unfamiliar people.

(Well, his Dad wasn’t unfamiliar to Hitoshi, but Hitoshi didn’t know that yet! He’d just have to keep pretending that Hitoshi didn’t know his Dad until they all finally met each other.)

Now all he had to do was let Hitoshi know about the sudden change in their Saturday plans, so he would know that Izuku couldn’t meet up with him at the park that afternoon.

Thankfully, Nedzu-san had been able to track down and call Hitoshi’s mom somehow, who had then proceeded to hand the phone over to Hitoshi when Nedzu-san had explained that he was calling on his behalf.

After a quick conversation where Hitoshi had cautiously agreed for their parents to officially meet up at his place instead of their usual meetings at the park, he had felt somewhat better.

“Fukukado-kun is a polite child,” Nedzu-san had reassured him after the call after he had scribbled down their address and time they were set to arrive, “I am reasonably sure that they’ll all get along.”

Honestly, he wasn’t worried that Hitoshi wouldn’t get along with his Dad, it was more of a worry that his Dad might not get along with everyone else.

But that was something he could worry about later. For now, his current issue seemed to be as fixed as it could be.

And after a profuse amount of pouting and a small presentation on the pros of visiting his friend after school in a place he would be comfortable in (Nedzu-san’s advice), his Dad had agreed to take him to Hitoshi’s place after school after he had been told that he had gotten permission from Hitoshi’s mom.

 

Soon enough, Saturday arrived and before he knew it, school was over.

“Do give Fukukado-kun my regards when you see him,” Nedzu-san told him as he was packing up his backpack after another therapy session with Inui-san, “Please do have a pleasant weekend, Izuku-kun, and I will see you again next week.”

“I will!” He really did hope so, “See you next week, Nedzu-san! You have a good weekend too, okay?”

Nedzu-san gave him a small wave of his paw as the door opened behind him to reveal his Dad standing there, his hand already getting shoved back into his pocket.

“I shall endeavor to do so.”

“Dad!” He greeted him, “I’m ready to go!”

“Alright, let’s get going,” His Dad motioned for him to leave first, then nodded to Nedzu-san, “See you, Sensei.”

Having his Dad on campus was honestly not as bad as he thought it might have been.

There was one thing that he didn’t like as much though.

Because his Dad now walked with him after dismissal, with his Papa sometimes coming with the car to pick them up, he didn’t get to see either Ecto-san or Snipe-san as much as he usually might.

 

As he walked with his Dad, he could feel the fluttering in his stomach.

 

Would his Dad like Hitoshi?

Would he like Hitoshi's mom?

And what about his mom's girlfriend?

(What if he didn't like either of them? What then?)

No, he told himself.

He had to do his best for his and Hitoshi's ongoing friendship.

It would really suck if none of the adults got along. Because with his Dad insisting him or his Papa be there always, it would just be really awkward if Hitoshi's mom didn't like him.

(Well, he was not worried about people not liking his Papa. Everybody liked his Papa; they just didn’t necessarily know it yet.)

Sure he had gotten a lot better with meeting new people, but those tended to be strangers, people he would speak with maybe one or twice before never ever seeing them again.

But these were people who he would need to see and possibly speak to a lot more often, especially since he wanted to stay friends with Hitoshi.

So, yes, he was nervous about this.

They soon arrived at Hitoshi’s apartment building. His Dad had used his phone to help get them there in the least amount of time, only pausing to stop at a supermarket at his insistence.

(Izuku had made sure that his Dad purchased some sweet oranges as a gift. He had also managed to get his Dad to buy a tin of fancy cat food. Even if Hitoshi really didn't eat cat food, his mom's girlfriend did own a cat, so it wasn't as if it would go to waste. Plus, the face Hitoshi would make when he saw it would just be too good to pass up.)

He had activated his quirk as they neared the correct apartment number, wanting to pick up on anything that could be happening.

Maybe Hitoshi’s mom had suddenly changed her mind on this meeting, or something equally as horrible?

He wanted to know all this stuff before they knocked on the door.

"I wanna open the door for my friend, Ms. Mom," He could hear Hitoshi insist, "You're still a stranger to him, so your loudness might scare him until he gets used to you."

"You sure are eager to open doors today, munchkin," An unfamiliar voice replied; Izuku knew that this had to be his friend’s mom. It was a bit obvious considering what Hitoshi liked to call her, "A fun change of pace!”

“This is Izuku,” Hitoshi mumbled in return, “I like Izuku.”

“Aw, well, I can’t wait to meet your little friend.”

“Mm, yeah,” He heard a small rustling. Clothes? “He is kinda short.”

Rude!

He rushed forward the last few steps of the stairs, slamming one of his hands against the door after a quick peek revealed that it was the correct apartment, hearing Hitoshi scream at the sudden sound.

“Take that back, Hitoshi!” He could hear his Dad run up to him, tone all scolding; Izuku ignored him, “I am not!”

“Is that him?” He could hear Hitoshi’s mom cackle, “Oh, I like him already!”

“That’s him,” The unlocking of the door was a gentle click and he hastily deactivated his quirk, knowing that Hitoshi thought his mom was loud and his owl hearing really didn’t like loud, “I got the door.”

Oh.

Oh no.

He probably ruined his first impression.

 

Well, there was nothing he could do about it now.

"Hi, Hitoshi," He greeted with his best grin, wanting to make a better second impression, taking and thrusting the bag of oranges into his friend's hands, "For you and your mom!"

"Izuku," Hitoshi offered him a crooked smile, eyebrows raised, arms buckling under the weight of all the oranges, handing it off to the person behind him, "You scared me."

“Well, you called me ‘short’.”

"Era-Aizawa!" The woman who Izuku pinned as being Hitoshi's mom exclaimed, "That you?"

"Fukukado," His Dad's voice held a tone of flat surprise, eyes flitting from a gaping Hitoshi and the woman behind him with an ecstatic grin, "You let your kid eat cat food?"

“Huh? What?” She stared back at him before turning down to look at a stunned Hitoshi, “Hitoshi, have you been telling people that you eat cat food?” Laughter broke out from her at Hitoshi’s embarrassed expression, the sudden sound making him jump; he knew that he had gotten better at it, but it could still be jarring at times, “What a riot!”

“So he doesn’t,” His Dad looked a bit relieved, “Alright.”

“And this is the little friend you’re always talking about,” Hitoshi’s mom’s eyes were warm when they finally directed all their attention towards him, “I’m Fukukado Emi, Hitoshi’s mom.” She leaned forward, holding out a hand. “Thank you for being my son’s friend.”

“I’m Aizawa Izuku,” He immediately replied, taking her hand and gave it a good strong shake like how he had seen Present Mic do on television before starting interviews, ignoring how her eyes eerily reminded him of his Mama’s, “I like being Hitoshi’s friend.”

“Wow, you’re so proper!” She chuckled after taking her hand back, motioning for them all to come in, bag hanging from her elbow, “I almost can’t believe you’re his kid.” She stuck her tongue out at his Dad who just huffed at her. “He’s always so grouchy.”

“Well, he’s the best,” He chirped as he balanced himself against his Dad’s leg as he took off his shoes and put on some guest slippers, “If he doesn’t get enough naps, he can be a little bit grouchy though, yeah.” Patting his Dad’s thigh once as an apology, he then grinned. “But I love him even when he’s grouchy.”

“Thanks, Izuku,” His Dad sighed, a hand patting his head, “I’m flattered.”

”Izuku,” Hitoshi pulled him further into their home, “That’s Eraserhead!” One of his hands reached up to tug at the strands of his hair. “Eraserhead is. In. My. Home!”

“Yeah?” He was a bit confused, but glad that Hitoshi seemed to be taking it well enough, “But you gotta keep it a secret, okay?”

“Pro heroes and secret identities, I know, I know,” Hitoshi nodded, “I promise I won’t tell.” He paused, a look of slight confusion flashing across his face. “But I thought you said your Dad was coming?”

“Uh, yeah?”

“I don’t see Nedzu-san?” Sneaking a quick peek behind him and then around them, Hitoshi shrugged, “Unless he’s hiding in the bushes outside or something.”

 

What was he talking about?

“Nedzu-san is at work right now,” He replied to the only bit he could understand, “And he’s not always in the bushes, you know.” And that was a good thing! Many of the snacks he liked usually hid in bushes, so he would prefer Nedzu-san not be in there at the same time as they were. “He’s a very busy person.”

“Ohh,” Hitoshi hummed, “So he sent Eraserhead to take you to our place instead since he’s too busy, right?” He nodded to himself. “That makes sense.”

He was getting more confused by the minute.

Izuku quickly looked up for his Dad, seeing that he had wandered into the kitchen with Fukukado-san. He excused himself for a second, making his way over to grab his Dad to fix this.

“C’mon,” This was something his Dad had to clear up for him, “You gotta introduce yourself to my friend.”

“You go introduce yourself to Hitoshi, Aizawa,” Fukukado-san waved him away, “I can prepare snacks for the kids.”

“Alright,” His Dad nodded, “Lead the way.”

They walked the short distance to where Hitoshi was quickly cleaning up a table set up in the corner.

(It looked like homework. Izuku wondered if Hitoshi’s homework was anything like his. He already knew that Tenya’s wasn’t, but Hitoshi did go to a different school. If they were similar, then maybe they could do it together!)

“This is Hitoshi,” He began, gesturing to his friend who was shoving the last of the papers into a hanging bag, “My friend.”

“I’m Izuku’s Dad,” His Dad then greeted a wide-eyed Hitoshi, “Aizawa Shouta.” His Dad’s voice was the kindest he ever heard outside of when they were at home or out with his Papa. “It’s nice to finally meet you.”

“Wh-” Hitoshi looked back at him, confused, “But isn’t Nedzu-san your dad?”

What.

“What?” His Dad echoed his thought, almost grumpily, “No, I’m Izuku’s Dad.”

“But you’re Eraserhead?”

“He’s both,” Izuku huffed; it wasn’t that weird that his Dad was also Eraserhead, was it? “Nedzu-san’s my friend and teacher.”

“Your dad is Eraserhead!” Hitoshi seemed to be overwhelmed with the information. Maybe this had been a bad idea after all, “Eraserhead!”

“I’m really feeling the love here, munchkin!”

Fukukado-san called from the kitchen over the rush of faucet water. Izuku peeked over to see that she was washing the oranges in the sink, sleeves pulled up so they wouldn’t get wet.

“Yeah, but you’re my Mom,” Hitoshi called back, “It’s different!”

“Is it though?” She hummed, “‘Raser and I don’t have that many differences, I don’t think. Besides the grumpiness and how he usually looks rumpled to oblivion at least.”

Hitoshi sighed heavily before turning back to his Dad, fingers twiddling with the hem of his shirt.

“I just, I want to thank you,” His voice was low, nervous, “You saved me back then.”

“So you do remember me,” Hitoshi nodded, confirming his Dad’s statement, “I’m glad to see you’re doing better than you are before, kid.”

“I am!” Izuku already knew that, but it was good to see that it was still true, “Ms. Mom is the best.”

“Good,” His Dad looked satisfied hearing that, “And please don’t be formal.” He raised an eyebrow, looking slightly less amused. “You’re Izuku’s friend. You can call me as you please.”

“Aizawa-san then?”

“That’ll be fine.”

“I, um, I have a question, Aizawa-san,” Hitoshi spoke tentatively, voice growing more confident when his Dad nodded to his request, “I wanted to say ‘thank you’ to your owl too. Do you think I could—”

“You actually put cat food in here, Aizawa!” Fukukado-san snorted as she waved the tin of cat food at them, cutting Hitoshi off, “Never took you for such a jokester! I like it!”

His Dad looked a bit disgruntled at the interruption, but besides that, it all seemed to be going well!

Though it seemed that Hitoshi hadn’t realized that he was that same owl?

Maybe he should tell him later?

“Dad, I’m gonna color with Hitoshi,” He patted his Dad’s leg again, “I’ll be here if you need me.”

His Dad gave him an odd look before he sighed.

“I’ll be fine, Izuku,” A hand patted his head, “Go play with your friend.”

“Okay!”

It seemed he had nothing to worry about in the first place.

Shouta pulled himself away from the kids.

He wasn’t really looking forward to spending some time alone with Fukukado, but he knew he couldn’t just sit there next to the kids and avoid her the entire time they were here.

Fukukado had done Izuku a favor, allowing him to even come over to her home when she had never even met him before.

And Izuku seemed to be enjoying himself as well.

He had been a bit concerned about his relationship with the cat food kid when he had seen Izuku screech at the door about his lack of height, but nothing had happened. The kid, and oh he had been surprised when he realized that he recognized that distinctive bush of hair, had greeted him like nothing had happened, like Izuku hadn’t nearly punched a hole into their front door.

But what had truly surprised him was that it had been Fukukado Emi behind Izuku’s friend.

He had left Hitoshi in her care back after he had initially picked him up from the streets. With their agencies so close to each other, there had been more than a few times where they had tagged each other out on duties. Usually, he would wait until he knew the kid would be in good hands, but Izuku, Mimizuku, had already activated his tracker again and he had been in a rush to catch up with the owl and his concerning activities.

“Sure, I can take him!” Joke had given him a thumbs up, “The kid’ll be in good hands!”

He had left after making sure Hitoshi had been okay with that decision.

Shouta hadn’t expected to see him again.

He hadn’t expected to see that they were both now family.

“Yo, Aizawa,” Fukukado greeted him, not turning as she continued to slice the oranges he Izuku insisted he buy into neat slices, “Really didn’t expect to see you today.”

“I didn’t expect to see you either,” It did make him feel a bit better to know that she had been just as surprised to see him like he had been to see her, “So, a kid, huh?”

“He’s a good kid,” She plated the slices up, arranging the slices so that they spiraled out from the center, “Just given a shitty starting hand.” She left the kitchen, dropping off the plate at the kid’s table before returning to the kitchen. “And you can’t talk! You’ve got a kid too!”

“There were extenuating circumstances for Izuku,” He shrugged, not knowing how much to share; he hadn’t discussed this with Izuku yet. He would need to if they planned on continuing these playdates, “It’s classified.”

“He’s safe though?” Fukukado knew when to stop pushing for information, but she did have her own kid to worry about now as well, “Nothing I need to worry about?”

Shouta knew she was a good hero. They weren’t friends, but he knew her well enough to know that she could be trusted with at least some information.

There was no way he wanted to risk Hitoshi getting caught up in the mess that was Izuku’s life at times.

(Izuku would never forgive him if there had been a way he could have prevented it from happening.)

“His biological father is a piece of shit,” He murmured, “We have people working on it, but he’s still out there.”

“Huh,” She hummed, “So on a scale of one to ten, how much of a piece of shit is this guy?”

“Homicide and arson.”

“Send me the details.”

“Mm.”

A moment of quiet passed between them.

Shouta thought that would be it. That they would just be able to just coexist silently in the same room as their kids spent their time together. But that was too much to expect out of someone like Fukukado, a person who liked to constantly try to make him laugh, with bad jokes or even her quirk, Outburst, that one time. Erasure had put a stop to that pretty quickly.

(That incident had pretty much cemented her status as just someone he was willing to work with, but nothing more than that. She had apologized to him later, and he had accepted it, but that had been it. He had kept her at arm’s length ever since.)

“Hey, hey, Aizawa,” She turned, offering him a cup of coffee, “Now that we know our kids are friends, dontcha think we should probably be friends as well?”

“Not really.”

He didn’t really see anything wrong with their current relationship.

“Aw, that hurts,” She placed the cup back down, nudging it towards him, “Say, you aren’t still holding a grudge from back then, are you?”

“No.”

He must have spoken too quickly, her eyes gleaming as she picked up some arbitrary clue and ran away with it.

“You are!” She puffed out her cheeks, looking much like a chipmunk, “Dude, that was years ago.”

“I just don’t see how it’s necessary for us to be friends.”

He didn’t want to waste his time explaining his past actions.

It just wasn’t logical.

“We owe it to the kids to at least try, Aizawa,” Fukukado said softly in a solemn voice he rarely ever heard from her, “We don’t need to become friends or anything, but we should, we should try to be more than just acquaintances that happen to work near each other.”

 

Fukukado wasn’t wrong.

She had offered him friendship before, but he had always rebuffed her overtures, skin crawling with the feeling of that jarring laughter leaving his throat whenever she approached him.

(He hated that loss of control.)

But that was then and this was now.

Shouta wasn’t the same person he had been back in high school.

(He turned his attention to the kids at the table, taking a moment to listen to Izuku supply Hitoshi with the newest and hottest gossip about Tenya’s life. Apparently Tenya had befriended a new small child and had Tensei call Hizashi so he could pass the phone to Izuku and then proceeded to regale Izuku about his new neighbor.)

“We can try,” He finally replied, “For the kids.”

She echoed back at him, nodding.

“For the kids.”

And now that that was settled, he took the cup of coffee, Fukukado grinning at him as he did. He took a small sip, immediately grimacing at the salty taste.

Fucker.

“You fell for it!” She snorted, hand covering her mouth, “That never gets old!”

In that moment, he knew that if it weren’t for the children present, he would have picked Fukukado up and defenestrated her.

And it wasn’t as if she lived that high up, so she would probably be fine.

Probably.

“Oh, and I should tell you, shouldn't I?” She then added, almost as an afterthought, “My girlfriend is actually over right now.”

What.

Who.

This was absolutely information that should have been shared beforehand.

“Emi!” A very familiar voice yelled; ah, well, at least it wasn't someone he didn't already know, “Are there people over?”

“Yeah!” Fukukado yelled back, “Hitoshi’s little friend and his dad!” A pause. “Get dressed!”

Shouta quickly turned to look over at where Izuku was, worry already bubbling up.

Izuku had a pinched expression on his face.

Had Izuku also recognized Nemuri’s voice?

(Since when had Nemuri started dating Fukukado? Not that he was that interested in that sort of stuff. But he would have expected Nemuri to drop that sort of detail in conversation before skipping away to avoid answering any questions.)

“So you’re Hitoshi-chan’s little frie—” Nemuri paused, glasses crooked on her face, “Izuku-chan?”

Izuku’s eyes were wide, the crayon in his hand snapping.

“Kayama-san,” He murmured, eyes immediately dipping to look at the fucking hickies on her neck, “Um. I, uh, yes?” Shouta quickly pushed himself off the kitchen counter, making his way over to Izuku. “Are you okay?”

“I’m fine,” Nemuri looked worried, her lips downturned, her hand attempting to straighten her glasses, only making them more crooked, “Is this alright?”

“They’re crooked.”

Ah, Shouta knew he could depend on Izuku to give it to her straight even though he was pretty sure they were on completely different wavelengths right now.

Nemuri seemed to realize the same, a small smile slipping onto her face.

“No, I meant, is it alright if I stay?”

Izuku gave her a bewildered look.

“But don’t you live here?” He looked over at Hitoshi who looked even more confused than before, “I’m not gonna kick you out of your own home.” He peeked back up at her. “You can stay.”

“You know each other?” Hitoshi finally burst out, “All of you?”

“Kayama-san is one of my dad’s friends,” Izuku shrugged, looking down at his hand, groaning when he saw the broken crayon, “And I met Kayama-san before. She kinda threw me out a window so I haven’t seen her in a while.”

“Nemuri did what?!” Fukukado sent Nemuri a look, one filled with confusion, “Why?”

“Uh, I thought he was trying to eat Nedzu?” Hitoshi looked horrified now, “I know, I know! I acted way too rashly! Shouta gave me a lecture already!”

“I’m okay though!” Izuku piped in, only adding to his sudden growing headache, “My leg hurt a little bit, but it got better real quickly!”

“You got hurt?” Hitoshi frantically looked over Izuku, his hands hovering over his shoulders before he turned to Nemuri, “Nemuri-san, you’re not allowed to hurt my friend! If you do it again, I’ll tell my Mom to make you sleep on the couch!”

“The cou—”

Her eyes went cloudy and Hitoshi recoiled, his own eyes widening in horror.

“Oh no.”

 

That had to be Hitoshi’s quirk at work.

He readied Erasure, but Fukukado quickly slipped her way into the living room, elbow jabbing Nemuri’s side. The blankness immediately disappeared from her eyes and she blinked before noticing the distraught Hitoshi.

(Izuku was holding his hand. A good grounding technique.)

“Hey, I’m okay,” Nemuri got onto her knees, “See? Nothing happened.”

“But I,” Hitoshi’s free hand was clenched, fingers digging into the flesh of his palm, “My quirk.”

“It’s alright, munchkin,” Fukukado added, “There’s nothing inherently bad about your quirk.” She chuckled, a rueful tone apparent in her next words. “Control is hard at this age.”

“Your mom is right, Hitoshi,” Izuku quickly interjected, “I can’t even show you my owl form yet ‘cause quirk control is really hard for me too.”

“I guess…” The kid looked slightly overwhelmed with the attention; his eyes darting back and forth between everyone around him, “But my quirk…”

“No,” He finally decided to speak up, “You’re a kid. Control comes with time and practice. No one is expecting perfect control from you.” After making sure his point was made, he softened his voice. “You’re allowed to make mistakes.”

“My Dad is always right,” Izuku immediately chirped after him, “You should listen to him.” His hand reached out, unclenching Hitoshi’s, clasping them both in his own hands. “You’ll have amazing control one day, Hitoshi!”

The look in HItoshi’s eyes as he gazed over at Izuku who was practically glowing in the sheer confidence he had in him was cute to say the least.

(Izuku really was taking after Hizashi, Shouta mused. More than he thought too. This was a good thing. Izuku taking on traits of the man he loved could only be good.)

 

His gaze met Nemuri’s and then Fukukado’s.

They would make it work.

For the kids.

Notes:

    Izuku > Guess what Tenya told me the other day?
    Hitoshi > The old man ran into a tree?
    Izuku > Well, besides that.
    Hitoshi > What?
    Izuku > He made a friend all on his own! I'm so proud of him! He says she kinda reminds him of me! (*o▽o*)

    Nothing exploded and no one was thrown out a window! That's a step in the right direction!

    All in all, Izuku thinks this went over as well as it could! He's quite worried about the apparently gigantic mosquitoes that live Hitoshi's home and all decided to bite Nemuri while she was napping.

    And as always, thank you guys so much for the comments! I read them all! Please continue to let me know your thoughts! <3

Chapter Text

Winter was finally arriving.

If it was the extra nip of his nose, the loss of the leaves on trees, or how even Izuku put on his scarf more often than not nowadays, they were all surely signs that the next season was just around the corner.

And the arrival of a new season meant new attire. Which in turn meant shopping!

Shouta could moan and groan all about it if he wanted, but one look at Izuku's closet was more than enough to confirm what he had already known.

Izuku needed a winter wardrobe.

(That wasn't entirely true. He had previously bought Izuku some thick sweaters back when summer had just started, taking advantage of the many sales that stores held to try to get rid of their winter inventory. There were some great deals to be gotten this way. While he was keen on keeping up with fashion trends, his husband was not. And despite his best efforts, it seemed Izuku was heading that direction as well.)

Going shopping as a family was steadily becoming more and more difficult though. There was no way he was allowing Shouta to go shopping with Izuku on his own; they’d either come back with solid black clothing or run in the opposite direction with Ganriki Neko-branded clothing. And Shouta didn’t want him to go alone with Izuku either, since in his words, he’d buy “illogical frivolous articles of clothing that wouldn’t even get used”. Which, rude! He was sure they’d get some use out of everything he might have potentially purchased.

With Shouta’s new job at U.A. and also the classes he would be taking on the side for his license, he was busier than ever before considering he still did his nightly patrols.

And this wasn’t even including having to keep up with the ongoing Firebird case.

(That case was why both he and Shouta were so reluctant to even have Izuku away from them even for the tiniest amount of time. Tsukauchi had called them only a few days ago, letting them know that when that arsonist had been in the middle of getting transferred to a new and more secure location, the attending officers had hit a snag, losing him. Needless to say, none of them were happy to hear the news and they were now certain that Midoriya Hisashi knew about Izuku’s continued survival. What he’d do about it though? They weren’t sure. But it was better to be safe than sorry, especially with the life of their son hanging in that balance.)

Suffice to say, Shouta was being stretched thin, spending every spare moment he had with Izuku or resting on their couch.

He couldn’t allow this to continue on.

“I have a seminar to attend next week,” Shouta murmured to him as he seared and then stir-fried slices of beef, removing them and placing them aside before pouring in a bit more oil and then also the sliced onions after it was suitably heated, “Izuku doesn’t have school that day.”

And he had work.

Unless there were special plans that he knew about ahead of time and could plan accordingly for, he always had work.

After all, he was the face of ‘Put Your Hands Up Radio’.

“I don’t want to ask Fukukado to babysit,” The onions were stir-fried, edges blistering from the heat; the beef was tossed back into the pan along with some sauce that Shouta had already put together earlier, “And Tensei’s got some team up with a new pro starting up an agency near his.”

Oh, he had heard about that.

A pro with a water manipulation quirk was a hot commodity these days, especially with the arson cases steadily climbing week by week. Tensei had apparently leapt at the opportunity to partner up with them. And while he would have liked Tensei to be available to babysit Izuku, he also knew that they were all busy pro heroes, so he couldn’t really blame him for putting his career first.

It made him feel bad.

He was Izuku’s Papa, and here he was, putting his own career ahead of his son. Sure, they were understanding about it, knowing how important his work was to him, but he couldn’t continue placing the responsibility of watching Izuku onto Shouta anymore, especially now more than ever.

“I’ll take Izuku in with me to work,” He offered as he pulled out plates to set the table, calling Izuku for dinner, “I’ve got like one interview scheduled for that day, so I can easily watch him or have one of my interns do it while I’m on air.” Izuku came into the kitchen, hands already outstretched for the tray and bowls that Shouta was dishing out their dinner in. “They’re trustworthy and I’m just down the hall if anything happens.”

Plus, the guy he was interviewing was Best Jeanist. If anything happened to go awry, he did have a good source of backup. Best Jeanist was already shooting his way into the top. If he had to guess, the guy would easily hit the top ten rankings within the next five or so years.

“That sounds fine,” Shouta turned, handing Izuku his tray so he could take it to the table, his own tray getting handed to him right after, “As long as Izuku is alright with it.” Hizashi took his tray to the table, seating himself down so they could start on their meal as soon as they all arrived. Shouta sat down not too long after, his apron already untied and put away. “After all, he’s never been there yet.”

“Where are we going?” Izuku immediately asked after their chorus of itadakimasu, “Is it a fun place?”

“You’ll be tagging along with me to work,” He winked at him as he piled some beef and onions onto his rice, “How does that sound?”

“To the radio station?”

“Yep!”

“Is that allowed?”

“Why wouldn’t it be?” He laughed, “It’ll be ‘Take Your Izuku to Work Day’!”

“I’m the only Izuku though, yeah?” Izuku pursed his lips into a pout, chopsticks clenched in his hand, “There’s no other Izukus getting brought in to work too, right?”

“Well, unless my coworkers all changed their names, you should be the only one there,” Hizashi lightly teased him, “How about it?”

“Okay,” The agreement came easily, “I’ve always wanted to see where you worked, Papa.”

He did?

It wasn’t something he had ever brought up to him before. He had actually assumed that Izuku held no interest in that job, as pro heroes and quirks were usually what caught his attention. Not radio hosting and talk shows. And especially not places where there were a fair amount of people at mostly all times; late nights were an exception.

(Though he did know that Izuku liked the music he chose to stream, humming or even singing along if he knew enough of the lyrics. There were times that he even got Shouta to sing along, his deeper voice as smooth as butter to his ears. It was nice to listen to.)

“Aw, ‘Zuku,” He cooed, “Ya know, if you wanted to check out the radio station, all you had to do was ask.”

“I know,” Izuku mumbled around a bite of sauce soaked rice, “But you’re busy at work and you gotta keep the place running smoothly an’ everything.” Swallowing that bite, he reached for another, only for Shouta to heap another helping of beef and onions into his bowl; Izuku flashed him a smile and a whispered ‘thanks’, then crunching into a slice of pickled ginger. “I didn’t wanna get in the way of your work.”

Oh.

“You could never!” Izuku blinked at his exclaimed words, cheeks bulging from the bite he just took, “I know I’m kinda busy with work a lot, but you could never get in the way of anything, Izuku.”

When they had taken Izuku in, adopted him as their son, they had made a promise to take care of and to love him forever.

It sounded all pretty and simple when he thought about it that way, but adoption was rarely that straightforward.

Bringing Izuku in as family, as their kid, meant that his needs had to come first even before other things, making him the priority in their everyday lives.

(He had been slacking off in that regard, but that was going to change. He’d make sure of it.)

“You’re sure?”

“Positively sure.”

“Okay, Papa."

And that was that.

If he could swing this well enough, he might even be able to squeeze in a short shopping trip afterwards.

 

Before they knew it, the fateful day had arrived.

Everyone was up bright and early, getting ready for the day ahead of them.

Shouta seemed a bit more wired than usual, his eyes seeming a bit more awake while his hands were steadily creating onigiri for lunch.

(A case of the jitters perhaps? It was a seminar geared towards child development and they did have Izuku now... He would need to ask Shouta for his notes just to see if there was anything interesting that was worth adding to his mental database of ‘just children things’.)

He had asked Izuku to pack the previous night, knowing that if they left all the packing for the morning, it would become unnecessarily hectic. Izuku was usually pretty good at deciding on what he wanted to take along with him whenever he had to go somewhere else, but having to convince his son that perhaps bringing Real Mick to where Present Mic worked wasn’t the best of ideas.

(If Real Mick happened to be taken out in view of his employees and coworkers, there was a very real chance that the toy would immediately get elevated to an unofficial mascot status. And that was not what he wanted for the radio station, nope.)

“I’m finished with breakfast,” Izuku announced, picking up his empty tray, walking it to the sink, “Thanks for making it, Dad.”

Shouta grunted back at him, having already finished his breakfast earlier, and now slotting the onigiri into bento boxes so they could be saved for later.

“Alrighty, Shouta,” He covered the boxes with the corresponding lids and quickly wrapped them into the furoshiki, tying a neat bow on top for easy handling, “I’ve got this. You need to go catch your train.”

He handed Shouta his bento and waved off his protests. Shouta was not the type to overtly worry, but today seemed to be an exception; the news they had gotten about that Firebird guy that had gotten away hadn’t been too long ago and he knew that Shouta was paranoid that they would be hiding just around the corner, waiting to do something. Because even with all they knew, there was more that they had yet to figure out. Firebird’s goals for one were still a mystery unless one counted ‘fucking set everything on fire’ as one.

“Yeah!” Izuku chirped as he made his way back from the sink, “You gotta go learn how to be a teacher today, Dad.” Ah, Izuku made it sound like Shouta didn’t already do that every day at U.A. and at home working on his online courses. “Do your best, okay?”

“Always,” Shouta quickly shrugged on a light coat, his capture weapon sitting atop his shoulders as usual, “And you, Izuku, be good for Hizashi, alright?”

“I’m always good for Papa,” Izuku insisted, peering up at him as if looking for validation, “Me an’ Papa are gonna have fun today.”

“All the fun, ‘Zuku!” He agreed; his interns were supposed to keep the radio station as pest-free as possible, so there shouldn’t be anything for Izuku to get into, hopefully, “I’ll introduce you to everyone there and show you around!”

“I get to see where Papa goes when he’s talking on the radio!” Throwing his hands up in excitement, Izuku slammed into his leg, “And Papa says if I wanna, I can choose some of the songs to play when it’s Music Hour!”

“Sounds like you’ll have a good time,” Shouta’s voice was rather flat, but Hizashi could hear the fondness there, “You can tell me all about it over dinner, alright?”

“Mm!” Izuku nodded, “I will!”

And with a kiss for him and for Izuku each, Shouta left, his messenger bag slung on one shoulder.

“Do you think Dad’s gonna get a full score if he gets a pop quiz today?” Izuku asked; oh man, that was right! Since Shouta was technically going to school now, he would get graded on things again, “When I get everything right on my quizzes, Nedzu-san puts a sticker of a pro hero on my paper.”

Cute!

Man, he knew he would have loved it if he got stickers back in the work he did in Nedzu’s class.

“I think he’ll do just fine,” Shouta had always managed good grades back in U.A., so there was no reason to think he wouldn’t do well here too. If anything, Shouta was determinedly stubborn. So if there was something he wanted to get done, he’d stop at nothing to accomplish his goals, running over obstacles like how a Recovery Girl would run over someone that didn’t take her advice and was more hurt now than before, “Shouta’s a smart cookie.”

Accepting his answer, Izuku gave him a small nod, pulling him to the table and starting to pile together all the bowls. Ah, right, he had cleaning duty before leaving for work. Thankfully, it was something he was used to and he had Izuku there with him! His son was easily the best distraction when faced with the monotony of washing dishes, sing-song reciting English nursery rhymes to him, all giggles when he would interrupt and make a small correction in pronunciation.

(Yes, he knew English pronunciation was weird at times, but it was easier to learn it now than have it relearn later on, especially since he was there to help.)

With Izuku’s company, the dishes were done in record time, and they both quickly got dressed. Izuku had returned to wearing his hoodies in the face of the cooling temperatures, feeling comfortable enough in quirk control that he wouldn’t accidentally bring out his wings and subsequently explode out the back.

After that, they left, making sure to lock up behind them.

The drive there was nice, Izuku spending much of it looking out the window or humming along with the radio.

“We’re almost there, Izuku,” He said as they stopped at a red light, “Are you ready?”

“I think so,” Izuku nodded, “As long as everyone’s nice, I think it’ll be okay.”

Nice?

Oh, if there was anyone who dared to be mean to his son, he would be introducing them to the front door.

“If anyone’s not nice, just let me know,” He gave Izuku a lopsided grin, “But I can’t imagine that happening anyway.” Most everyone knew that he had taken in a kid recently and he wasn’t embarrassed to say that he bragged about Izuku all the time at work. “You’re the best kid I know.”

“Papa, you know like two kids,” Izuku pouted back at him, “Two isn’t a lot.”

“That’s irrelevant!” He laughed as he pulled into the parking area. Even if he only knew two kids, he was still sure Izuku came on top in every category except for height, “And we’re here! Time to get out of the car, ‘Zuku!”

At the sight of the radio station, Izuku dropped his pout, wide eyes taking in the sight of the small building that he called his home away from home.

“This is Papa’s workplace…”

“Yep, and you know, ‘Zuku,” He hummed, trying his best to suppress his grin, “Every morning I come in, I always greet them like how I greet all my listeners when I’m on air.”

“Really?”

“You wanna do it with me?

“Mm!”

Oh, his kid was too cute.

“Let’s get going then!”

As he made his way in, he scanned the room first, habit urging him to check the room for potential threats before anything else. When his scan brought up nothing out of the ordinary, he relaxed, allowing Izuku to enter in after him.

”Good morning!” He greeted, throwing his hands up, eyes catching Izuku doing the same motion, ”Everybody, say “hey”!”

”Hey!

The response was immediate, the chorus of varied ‘hey’s bringing joy to his heart. Izuku also looked delighted, his hand tugging on his pant leg in excitement.

He fucking loved working here.

Izuku’s Papa was a very busy person.

It was something he always had to keep in mind, especially since that meant he didn't always have free time for other things.

(His Papa did always find ways to make some time for him though, even though he was busy a lot. That was why he was the best and deserved every single hug and kiss he got from both him and his Dad.)

But even if he did know about how busy his Papa was, it was very different to see it with his own eyes.

From the very moment his Papa stepped into the building, things seemed to pick up after the initial greeting. It was like everyone ran on his Papa’s energy and drive, work only really getting started when his Papa arrived.

(That really wasn’t logical ‘cause what if his Papa was sick one day and couldn’t come into the radio station for work? Everyone else working here would be in big trouble if they continued to depend on his Papa like that.)

Greetings were exchanged, his Papa introducing him as ‘his cute son that he got the chance to bring in today.’

(No one looked too surprised to see him though; his Papa must have mentioned him to them before. All they did was tell his Papa that he was just as cute as they imagined. It was embarrassing, and he wasn't even a stranger to his Papa telling people about how cute he was either.)

And his Papa knew everyone by name too, always showing interest in and asking about how they were doing. If school was treating them well or if they had given any more thought about it they wanted to continue working at the radio station after their in-tern-ships ended.

It made them feel special that his Papa remembered their names and asked after them.

Nedzu-san had mentioned that humans were generally social creatures, choosing to rely on one another for cooperation and even choosing to spend their time together as well.

(It was one of those things that he could sort of understand. Back when he had been living on his own as an owl, while he knew he had to hide, he never felt any urge to get close to anyone until he had gotten to know his Dad. If he hadn’t gotten to know his Dad, he didn’t doubt that he would still be fine living by himself and not talking to anyone. After all, owls were fine being solitary creatures.)

His Papa then showed him around the radio station, taking him to every important room, even the ones that were supposed to be ‘Staff Only.’

Izuku couldn’t pretend to understand everything that his Papa said when he started getting much more into the tech-ni-cal aspects of it instead of just telling him what the room was for, but he liked seeing his Papa so enthusiastic, so he didn’t stop him. If he had questions, he could always ask later and he knew his Papa would be happy to explain things again to him later.

His favorite rooms had to be the studio where his Papa went live and the break room where everyone went to take their breaks and have coffee and snacks.

As his Papa put together a cup of coffee for himself, he took the time to check out what sort of snacks were hiding in the fridge and in the cabinets. The fridge had just about every single flavor of yogurt that ever existed. There was also a selection of flavored creamers and milk. The cabinets had granola and so many nuts that he was sure that if a squirrel got in, they’d be happy to spend the rest of their life in there.

(Speaking of snacks though, he also spotted something he recognized as a mouse trap. Did that mean that there were other snacks located here somewhere? His Papa was so silly. Didn’t he know that owls were much better than mouse traps?)

“I’ve got to get ready now, Izuku,” They were now in one of the meeting rooms. It was empty, but it was located right across the hallway from the break room and right by the studio where his Papa would need to be, “I’ll send one of the interns up here in a minute, but you know where I am if you need me, yeah?”

The studio was so close that he was sure he could make it there in under thirty seconds.

“I’ll find you if I need you,” He nodded, “Promise.”

“Be good and we can go shopping afterwards, okay?”

“Mm!”

(Izuku would never admit it to his Dad, but shopping with his Papa was usually more fun. Plus, he could tell his Dad never seemed to have much fun on shopping trips, especially if it was for something like clothes. His Papa had mentioned wanting to go shopping soon with him so he’d have clothes for the winter that was just around the corner. It was only logical to go with his Papa to get it all done so then his Dad didn’t have to worry about it at all.)

After his Papa left, the door quietly closing behind him, he wasted no time in activating his quirk, nearby sounds heightening to a degree where he could comfortably listen to them all without it overwhelming him.

He was getting very good at this.

Voices were everywhere, his Papa’s noticeably nearby, asking ‘Suki’ to come and watch him for the next half an hour. He recognized the name. It belonged to one of the interns who had told his Papa that they really wanted to continue working at the radio station even after their internship. His Papa had been happy to hear that, so he was happy that his Papa was happy.

Izuku hadn’t activated his quirk just to listen in on conversations this time though.

That mouse trap he had seen earlier kept popping up in his thoughts.

If his Papa had a mice problem, then he wanted to be a good son and help him out.

Mice shouldn’t be allowed to get into the snacks, especially since they were snacks themselves; it just wasn’t right!

Thankfully, with his enhanced hearing, it was easy to identify the familiar sounds of scrabbling mouse claws in the breakroom. With a few tilts of his head, he knew specifically where the mouse was currently located.

Suki-san came into the room, a polite smile on their face and sat down a few seats away from him.

He gave them a small nod and then proceeded to ignore them.

Izuku knew that his Papa wouldn’t be too happy about his behavior, but he had more important things to worry about!

On this very fine day, he was gonna be Izuku, the snack catcher extraordinaire!

While he wanted to go rush in and go for the snack as soon as he could, he knew he couldn’t just do that. If he just ate it, he’d have no proof that he caught it. Plus, he was sure his Papa would not like it if he didn’t cook it before eating it.

There was a possibility that he wasn’t going to be allowed to eat the mouse too.

City rats and pigeons were already things that his Dad and Papa insisted that he not eat, but mice were different, right?

They were much more snack-sized compared to rats, for one. And their tails sorta looked different! It was possible that they tasted similar enough, but it wasn’t as if owls could taste, so maybe they tasted completely different!

Rats and mice weren’t the same, so logically, the snack rules shouldn’t apply to mice.

He continued to track the mouse as he sat in the chair, plunking his head down into his arms to pretend to nap. With his eyes closed, his hearing was much easier to focus on. There was no way he would lose track of his snack.

Time passed, the near silent sound of the clock hands moving being the only thing that told him that time hadn’t decided to freeze while he lightly dozed off.

Izuku had initially wanted to just listen to his Papa interview his guest, but he could barely get anything from where he knew the studio to be. That room must’ve been made to be soundproof like the police station interrogation rooms.

(He’d need to ask his Dad to let him listen to the recording they had on his Papa’s radio show’s website. They usually put them up a day or two after they have gone live.)

With squinted eyes, he peeked over at the clock, jolting up when he realized that his Papa was probably gonna be done soon.

He really would prefer to catch the snack before his Papa got back.

“Izuku-kun?”

“I’m getting a snack.”

Suki stared at him and then shrugged.

“Do you know where the break room is?”

“Uh huh,” He pointed to where the door would be if the walls didn’t exist, “I’m gonna get granola. I like crunchy things.”

“Sure thing, kiddo,” Suki-san made to stand up, “I’ll come with you and get myself something as well.”

Izuku shrugged; he didn’t really mind if they wanted to come along with him. His Papa did ask them to watch him, and he didn’t want to get them into trouble when they didn’t do anything to deserve it.

The walk to the break room was short, Suki-san even opening the door for him before heading over to the fridge.

As for himself, he softened his steps and slowly made his way to the cabinet where the granola and trail mixes were stored.

Where the snack was.

The small nibbling sounds paused when the fridge was opened, continuing when seemingly nothing happened.

Izuku carefully got nearer, knowing that he would need to be quick for this to work.

The inside of a closet wasn’t like his preferred hunting grounds of alleyways and forested lands. He couldn’t just swoop in and catch his snack like he would usually do.

Nedzu-san had told him that the best way to catch anything was to trap it into his own domain. That meant he had to trap it in an enclosed space where it couldn’t escape. Luckily for him, it was already in a pretty enclosed space. Izuku didn’t doubt there was some sort of small hole somewhere where it had gotten in, but if he acted fast enough, it wouldn’t even matter.

“Izuku-kun?”

“I’m gonna get my snack.”

“Uh, okay,” Suki-san sounded a bit confused, “Do you want a juice pack with that?”

Juice with a mouse?

It was a combination he had never tried before.

“Do you have apple juice?”

“I’ll check. It might be in the back of the fridge,” Suki-san opened the fridge again, their own yogurt placed on a nearby table, “Give me a minute.”

All he needed was a minute.

When she fully turned, he yanked open the door, shoving himself inside and letting the door slam shut behind him, leaving him near complete darkness.

He allowed his quirk to bleed through a bit more, the bits of light coming in from the space between the door and the cabinet giving him more than enough light to work with.

Scanning the space he was now in, he watched for any signs of movement and since the only other living thing in here was his snack, it was easy for him to see the quick frantic movements of the mouse who had apparently chewed through the bottom of a baggie of granola chunks.

It was easy work to corner the mouse to an area where he was sure there was no escape route.

He lurched forward, his snack even freezing with nowhere left to run.

(Izuku was sure Nedzu-san would be proud of him.)

When the mouse was in his hand, he quickly gave it a small squeeze to make sure it was nice and plump and then shoved it and his hand into his hoodie pocket. It wasn’t cooked yet, so he couldn’t eat it until he got someone to cook it for him.

He maneuvered himself out of the cabinet, making sure that he maintained a good grip on his snack, pleased at the occasional wiggle it would do. He wanted to keep it around until he could eat it and fresh snacks were loads better.

“Izuku-kun?” Suki-san stared at him as he carefully closed the door of the cabinet, “What were you doing in there?”

“Getting a snack.”

“Well, I did find an apple juice for you,” They handed him a juice pack and then tapped a finger against their lip, even winking, “It’s the last one though, so if anyone asks, we didn’t take it, okay?”

He nodded, accepting the apple juice.

“Yamada-san should be finishing up soon,” Suki-san mused as they went to grab a spoon from the drawer of utensils, giving it a quick wash before having a large spoonful of their yogurt, “Why don’t we finish off our snacks and meet up with him after?”

While Izuku usually didn’t mind following the instructions of others if they made sense, he really would rather not have his snack here.

It still needed to be cooked and what if Suki-san wanted to eat his snack?

The mouse was small and the only people he would even be willing to share some of it with would be his dads or his friends.

“I’ll wait for him,” He decided, hiding a small wince as his snack nipped at one of his fingers. So rude! Didn’t it know that he was the predator here? “He’s coming out now anyway.”

Suki-san made a questioning sound over their mouthful of yogurt, but didn’t stop him from walking past them to the door and opening it.

He could hear two sets of footsteps coming closer, one set being the familiar click-clack of his Papa’s boots. As soon as he caught sight of the hero his Papa was with though, all thoughts of sharing about his snack fled his mind. Not even the sharp teeth biting into his thumb could deter him from speeding his walk, Suki-san trailing behind him worriedly (still holding their yogurt) asking where he was going.

He thought it was obvious where he was going.

Where else would he go but to see his Papa and Best Jeanist?

The Best Jeanist!

What an exciting day this was turning out to be!


Notes:

    Izuku > See? Nedzu-san put a sticker of Present Mic on this one.
    Hizashi > What was the quiz about?
    Izuku > Bugs.
    Hizashi > （ΟΔΟ；；）

    Funnily enough, that mousetrap was only set earlier that morning and Hizashi had no idea what was chilling in the break room with them.

    And yes, pretty much everyone that works with Hizashi knows about the existence of "Cute Izuku" because it is impossible to stop a proud Papa from talking about his son!

Chapter Text

They were right there.

Despite that, Izuku knew he shouldn’t go ahead and interrupt their conversation.

Patience, he knew his Dad would say if he was there.

(And Izuku was more than familiar with patience. But it didn’t mean that he still couldn’t feel impatient at wanting to talk to his Papa again, or to properly meet Best Jeanist.

"It was a pleasure to get a chance to interview you,” His Papa said, a short laugh escaping him, "When I saw that you accepted my invitation, I could barely sleep."

"Thank you for having me on your show," Best Jeanist replied, eyes flittig past his Papa’s and over to his, "You do have a splendid way with words. I had a good time chatting with you and your listeners.”

Tall.

Best Jeanist was tall.

He wasn’t as tall as Kugo-san or even as big, but there was something about the way he stood and held himself that made him seem like he could rival Kugo-san in sheer presence.

Izuku could see why his Papa thought he was cool.

"Oh, Best Jeanist, this is Izuku," His Papa finally noticed him, waving him over to come closer, a proud smile curling onto his lips; Izuku went over, excited to be meeting a hero he knew that his Papa really admired, quickly finishing his apple juice so he didn’t forget about it. Lukewarm apple juice wasn’t as tasty as cold apple juice, "Izuku, this is the pro hero, Best Jeanist."

"I'm Izuku," He introduced himself, unable to stop himself from breaking eye contact in favor of trying to figure out what Best Jeanist had behind his tall jacket collar; chances were that it was just the other half of his face and a neck, right? It had to be! And were those pockets on the back of his high collar? “Can I ask you something?"

“You may,” Best Jeanist peered down at him, curiosity visible in his uncovered eye; Izuku felt very short in front of him, but he straightened himself up despite that; he just had to know the answer to his question, “I will answer to the best of my ability.”

“Do you keep anything in the pockets around your neck?” He wiggled the empty apple juice pack into his Papa’s hand before motioning to the area around his own neck, “If you put too much stuff in there, does your collar sag?” It looked very tall, so unless Best Jeanist had a very thick neck, there was probably plenty of space. “You could hide snacks in there and no one would know.”

Best Jeanist could probably even hide his snack in there and no one would know.

Izuku wasn’t quite sure if Best Jeanist would like a mouse in his clothes though. And especially not the one he still had in his pocket. It was a bit of a mean snack, still biting his fingers every so often.

“I do not keep anything in those specific pockets, no,” Best Jeanist replied with barely a moment of thought, “However, if I chose to do so, it would not sag due to the use of my quirk.”

His quirk…

From what Izuku had heard and seen on the television, Best Jeanist’s quirk allowed him to control fi-bers. His Dad said that it was basically the threads that made clothing, so Best Jeanist used his clothes to fight and defend others from getting hurt by villains.

It was a cool quirk.

He had seen it used to wrap people up so that they couldn’t move, just like how his Dad used his capture weapon.

And since it was kinda similar, he couldn’t help but to be in awe whenever he saw that quirk in action.

"Are you a fan of mine, Izuku-kun?"

"My Papa is a big fan," Izuku blurted out, making sure to really emphasize it with his voice, unable to show him how big with his hands without revealing the wiggly snack in his pocket, "He says your sense of style is ‘top-of-the-chart material’."

“That’s very nice of him to say,” Best Jeanist looked happy to hear that. His Papa did look a bit embarrassed, but it was the truth, right? “And you?”

“I think your quirk is cool,” Izuku truthfully replied, “And I like how you capture the villains.” It really did remind him of his Dad in ways. “And also those events where you can donate clothes for other people that need them? I like those too.”

There were lots of people that needed things like that out in the streets. Izuku had seen them out there when he was out hunting for his meals. Hearing the sounds of teeth chattering as people slept in the streets during times when snow fell made him feel bad, knowing he wasn’t able to do anything to help.

(He was very grateful that his feathers and inner warmth kept him all toasty through the winter. Because of those two things, he never needed any clothing. Plus, he was sure owls didn’t wear clothes.)

“Would you like a commemorative gift?”

“Com-mem-or-a-tive?”

“To mark this as a special occasion.”

A special present?

For him?

“What is it?” It did sound pretty cool, but was it a pair of jeans? “I don’t wear jeans ‘cause they’re hard to fly in, so I don’t want it if it’s jeans.”

They would be better off going to someone else that would wear them.

“While this gift is not a pair of tight jeans, they are just as helpful for keeping up your physical image,” Best Jeanist pulled out a small baggie out from somewhere, handing it over to him, “This is a specialty made Best Jeanist comb and styling kit.”

It was hero merchandise!

How cool!

“Thank you!” He happily accepted it, marveling at the ‘BJ’ on the handle of the comb; how fancy! “I love it!”

Izuku never could say no to free hero merchandise, quickly tapping at his Papa’s arm, silently asking him to hold the kit for him. His other hand was kinda full and busy with his snack and he wanted to keep at least one hand free to do other things. Thankfully his Papa took the kit from him, tucking it away in one of his pockets.

“May I ask you something in return, Izuku-kun?”

“Sure, Best Jeanist!”

“Have you met a ‘Sakamata Kugo’ recently?”

That was Kugo-san!

“Kugo-san is my friend,” Izuku perked up at the name of his friend; he hadn’t been able to see him again, but they did keep in contact through emails and his Papa followed his accounts on social media and showed him photos sometimes, “He’s really good at swimming.”

“So you are the same ‘Izuku-kun’ that he talks about to me,” Best Jeanist hummed, “The one he met on Okuto Island.”

“Uh huh, that’s me,” He nodded, “My grandma and grandpa got us tickets to go there.”

“Well I’m glad you’re looking well now,” Best Jeanist’ gaze reminded him of his Dad’s as well; especially when his Dad was looking him over for any bruises that he might have gotten from playing with Tenya or Hitoshi, “Sakamata is quite fond of you.”

“How do you know Kugo-san?”

Did Kugo-san also save Best Jeanist from drowning?

“We went to school together,” A small chuckle left Best Jeanist, “Though I was one year ahead of him.”

That was so cool!

“Izuku?” His Papa’s voice interrupted them, holding a bit of a nervous note, “Your pocket is wiggling.”

Was it?

 

It really was.

His snack was being mean and was trying to escape again, nipping at whatever it could reach, seemingly finding a whole bunch of energy so it could wiggle the entire time as it did.

“What do you have there, Izuku?” His Papa then sternly asked, “That better not be what I think it is.”

Just what did his Papa think it was?

“It’s just my snack,” He grumbled, pulling it out so his Papa could see, “For later.”

His Papa just stared at his hand with the mouse in it, a blank expression taking over his face.

Izuku further explained, wanting his Papa to understand why it was for later.

“‘Cause we gotta cook it first, you know?”

Now that his hand was out in the open though, the bites that his snack had given him did sting quite a bit. It wasn’t a nice feeling. Usually, he ate them way before they had any chance to even bite him.

He was trying to be a proper human though and humans had to cook their meat! Plus, he knew it was what his Mama would have wanted and he knew for sure it was what his Dad wanted.

There were so many ways to cook things too!

Frying, steaming, and boiling… Which way would his Dad want to do it?

 

And then it bit him.

His snack bit him right where his thumb met his index finger and he inadvertently yelped, dropping it onto the floor where it squeaked and starting running.

There was no way he was letting his snack escape him.

So Izuku gave chase.

Ah.

Hizashi sometimes wondered what he could have done in a past life in order to be given the gift of having such a cute and sweet son like Izuku now.

But as he watched Izuku scramble down the hallway after the mouse he had apparently squirreled away into his pocket, he knew that having Izuku as his son was not only a mere blessing in his and Shouta’s life.

Izuku was the whole fucking package.

The mouse was quickly forgotten when he noticed the red dripping on the floor of the tiles of the hallway.

Blood.

Izuku was bleeding.

Perhaps it was the dad in him, but he could feel his own heartbeat racing despite knowing that it wasn’t that much blood. Izuku didn’t even look bothered by it, much more interested in giving chase to his self-proclaimed snack.

(He didn’t want to think about how Izuku, human kid Izuku, was still wanting to eat things that could be riddled with disease. But at least he hadn’t eaten it already; that was the silver lining of this entire situation.)

From the corner of his eyes, he could see Best Jeanist jolting, arms jerking up into a defensive position, fingers crooked in a familiar motion that he had seen right before villains would get entangled in threads, constricted and unable to move.

“What is that?” He spoke in a terse voice, “A villain with a shrinking quirk?”

“The mouse!” Suki recoiled, whatever was in their hand falling and splattering across the floor, “My yogurt!”

The mouse and not a mouse, huh.

It seemed like there was a story behind this.

“A rodent,” Best Jeanist huffed, eyebrows drawn up in minor distaste, “If you do not mind, I will rid you of this pest.”

All the squeaking was echoing down the hallway and Hizashi just counted them lucky that the entire agency wasn’t sticking their heads in and watching his son try to catch a mouse with his bare hands.

“Izuku,” He raised his voice slightly, shoving down the morbid thoughts that flashed through his head, “Please get back here!”

Because there was only one thing Izuku would want with a mouse.

Izuku would want to eat it.

And in this state where he had his quirk partially activated (not doubt due to the fucking mouse that he had in his possession), Hizashi wasn’t sure he would stop himself from just fucking popping the thing into his mouth, wiggling tail and all.

(Shouta would eviscerate him if he ever found out that Izuku managed to eat a live mouse while in his care. Man, he’d eviscerate himself if it happened! Who even knew where this mouse had been and how dirty it could be? It had bitten Izuku more than once, his small fingers already stained with blood and probably a mess of mouse bites. He quickly marked down a mental note to take Izuku to a doctor later to see if he had caught anything nasty from all the bites.)

“Izuku-kun!” Suki warbled, nervousness bleeding into their voice; their quirk was an interesting sound-based quirk, usually bubbling to the surface in the face of stronger emotions, “Don’t run in the hallways!”

And while Izuku did slow down a tad, he didn’t stop, his sneakers squeaking as he made a quick turn and started running back towards them, the mouse having already gotten a bit further ahead as it also turned, not taking the next hallway as he expected, but also running back towards them.

“The yogurt!” Suki’s control was usually pretty good, but in this situation, he couldn’t fault them for losing that bit of it; it would just have to be something that they had to work on the next time they had a bit of free time. “You’ll slip!”

Izuku’s eyes were wild, his attention solely on the mouse in front of them.

Hizashi leapt forward.

This wasn’t something he could allow to keep happening.

He couldn’t allow Izuku to catch this mouse.

As he did though, Izuku was gone.

 

Well, his kid was gone.

Replacing him was an owl.

A very familiar owl.

Seeing as Izuku-as-an-owl was smaller than Izuku-as-a-kid, Hizashi could only mourn his chance of catching Izuku as he swept right past him, his talons cleanly snagging up the mouse in one fell swoop, his talons clattering against the tile of the hallway as he then landed, immediately moving to balance himself on one foot before deciding to sit instead.

Welp.

(Odd. He had seen his fair share of Izuku landing on their balcony and never had he seen him decide to just sit unless he was fully relaxed. Something wasn’t right.)

He squashed down the urge to get down on Izuku's level and wrestle the mouse from his hold, but he knew all too well how powerful an Eurasian Eagle Owls' grip could be and he really didn't want to test it.

(And this wasn't because he was scared or anything. But Izuku had once mentioned that the few times he had managed to use his quirk to go straight from a human to an owl, he had ended up disoriented to a degree.)

“Ah,” He could hear Best Jeanist behind him, “I see why Sakamata called him a ‘little owl child’ now.”

Though Izuku was a very large owl, he was still dwarfed in size by all the people around him. Hizashi could see his metaphorical hackles rise, his feathers puffing out to make him look even bigger than he already was.

Not good.

At this very moment, Izuku likely didn't recognize any one of them.

(Man, that really hurt to think about.)

"Suki, go," He sank down into a crouch, murmuring to his intern who was hovering hesitantly over him, “Get a mop and come back in fifteen.”

They gave him a small nod, retreating down further the hallway and into the room where the cleaning supplies were kept, closing it behind them.

Even with just one less person there, Izuku already looked much less likely to go for their fingers. He turned, ready to ask or even beg Best Jeanist to get down, but to his surprise, his fellow pro hero had already followed his lead, dropping into a crouch.

Hizashi made himself the smallest he could, all too aware that Best Jeanist was still there, though he had loosened up just a bit, no longer seeming as if he would go on the offensive.

The mouse was still alive, somehow, with Izuku managing to keep it in his grip just enough for it to continue breathing. He had no idea if it was alright though. But to be honest, at this point, he wasn't even sure Izuku would relinquish that mouse to him.

It would be easier to just let Izuku have it, but they had no idea where it had even come from.

What if it had ingested poison?

Shouta had impressed upon him the importance of not allowing Izuku to eat whatever the fuck he found walking around and it was very understandable. The two of them only wanted what was best for their son, and that was to have him healthy and happy.

"C'mon, 'Zuku," He crooned as soon as he noticed that Izuku was now much more owl-shaped instead of just a large ball of fluff, "May Papa have the mouse?"

Izuku blinked at him, head tilted just-so before letting out a peep, getting back onto his feet, almost immediately tipping over before he shifted his weight onto one of his legs to balance again, the mouse squeaking loudly at the sudden jarring movement.

(And that wasn’t very worrying at all. Definitely something he needed to ask about. It was likely just paranoia, but that was definitely the same leg that had gotten injured a few months ago, right? What were the chances that he’d get that same leg hurt again so soon?)

He proffered his hand, palm up, and waited.

Izuku (and oh, he really hoped that his son recognized him right now) clicked his beak and reached for his fingertips. And despite his very sharp beak, he very gently nibbled at one, not breaking any skin.

A very cute confirmation that his son did recognize him because he was sure he’d be short a fingertip otherwise or getting screamed at.

(Shouta would tease him at times, saying that Izuku got his loudness from him. Hizashi knew full well how loud he could be and while owls were not as loud as he could be, they could be plenty loud enough for their size.)

To his surprise, Izuku seemed to think about his request, picking the mouse up with his beak and bringing it over to his hand. If it weren’t for his glove, he was sure he would be able to feel the wiggling it was doing while even partially in his palm.

It was all going as he had imagined in his head. Well, until the mouse decided that his finger was its next target.

Hizashi couldn’t stop the wince and reflexive ‘ouch’ that left him, yanking his hand back to look at his finger, a tiny bit of blood wellowing up to the surface.

(Man, now both of them had to go get checked out! He was not leaving anything to chance here. Plus, Izuku had gotten many more bites than his one. His poor fingers!)

Uhoo

“Oh,” Best Jeanist murmured, sounding unperturbed, “I guess that’s one way to get rid of it.”

What.

He quickly looked up again, only to catch the tail-end of Izuku’s impromptu snack (ha!).

By the time he tried to reach out, hoping to at least grab the tail or something and maybe pull it out or something, it was too late.

Izuku looked incredibly satisfied for someone who just ate a mouse in his and Best Jeanist’s full view.

“Oh, ‘Zuku,” He sighed, suddenly feeling extremely tired, so very much aware of the yogurt that he was kneeling in; Suki would be getting back soon, right? “What am I gonna do with you?”

A small peep left Izuku as he hopped closer, one leg still curled up against his lower body.

(That was seriously not good at all; he and Shouta had Recovery Girl on call for general check ups, but finding someone who was good with exotics was a bit more difficult. Recovery Girl’s quirk worked well enough on animals, Nedzu being one of her patients as well, but if it was anything more serious, having dedicated veterinary care was key.)

“Is your leg hurt?” He’d likely need a new pair of pants after this, but his son took precedence over his pants any day; he dropped down from his kneeling, scooching over just a bit so he wouldn’t end up sitting in the yogurt, and sat down on the floor, “Come here, Izuku.”

He could feel Best Jeanist watching him, gaze still intent, but man, this was his baby! Izuku’s connection to the pro hero, Present Mic, had to be kept hush-hush and that could be dealt with later, but for now, he was more into making sure his son was alright.

With another few hops, Izuku made his way to him.

No visible wound or blood, Hizashi noted. So it couldn’t have been from just now. But the thing was… The entire time that Izuku was an owl, he had been right here. And it would be an affront to his observation skills if he didn’t notice his son getting hurt right in front of him. All Izuku had done was fly and catch the mouse. It was nothing out of the ordinary for an owl, and especially not for Izuku who he knew did this back when he lived on his own.

So what could have hurt him enough for him to not even want to put any weight on that particular foot?

 

That foot.

It was that foot that Nemuri injured while throwing him out the window.

But…

Shouta had taken Izuku to Recovery Girl for that injury; he had driven them to school that morning too! He remembered that Izuku had come home perfectly fine on his two feet! So what had happened?

 

It wasn’t like Izuku’s quirk somehow regressed the healing, right?

No.

That wasn’t right.

Izuku had gotten healed, just like how he had been gifted with his new tracking bracelet barely a week ago.

A bracelet that was now out of sight, like it had never existed.

Instead, the familiar tracker that Shouta had initially given him proudly adorned the feathery leg.

That was it.

Izuku-the-winged-kid, and his kid self by proxy, had gotten healed, but Izuku-the-owl had not.

Coming to that conclusion, many more things started making sense.

Like how back when Shouta had first brought Izuku home and used Erasure on him, revealing that Izuku still had his old clothes back from when he first was hiding out on the streets. Or how the tracker he wore as an owl only ever showed up when he was an owl, never as when he went half owl or was just a full human kid.

It had been something Shouta had off-handedly mentioned to him after catching him up with what he had seen on Nedzu’s security recordings. He had thought it was odd then, but at that time, he had been too furious with what had happened, not giving too much thought to how or why that tracker had returned.

(And by the time things had cooled down, he had been too worried about therapy and the whole ‘my-son-got-swept-out-to-sea-and-nearly-drowned’ thing. You know, the usual sort of things one had to think about when having a kid. No biggie.)

This could even explain why Izuku was relatively small for his age, not much changing about him from back when he left for the streets until he was taken off of the streets.

If the objects that Izuku carried around ended up being different due to whatever form he was occupying, then it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to assume that the injuries he could carry could do the same, right?

(Helpful for putting a pause on blood loss, he had to admit, but thinking about his son hurtin'.... He didn't like that very much.)

No, when Izuku had made his way home alone that one time, the injury he had gotten as an owl had stayed when he had been half-owl.

 

Oh.

Wait a second.

The injury he had gotten as an owl had stayed when he had gone from an owl to his half-owl form. He had been healed in that same form, and Shouta hadn't mentioned anything about Izuku keeping any injuries when he was fully a human again so he knew that Izuku was completely alright afterwards.

But Izuku had gone from human to owl just only a few minutes ago, the injury returning like it hadn't healed at all.

 

That was it, wasn’t it?

Both the owl and human forms were separate.

Separate trackers, separate clothes, and most importantly, separate injuries.

It was that half form that Izuku sometimes entered that made it a fuzzy gray area, seemingly able to take bits of both human and owl forms to create something not entirely new, but somewhat different.

There was just a lot.

Way too much for him to attempt to figure out while he sat here on his floor.

A small peep brought him out of his thoughts.

He looked into green eyes and tried not to crumple.

Izuku was hurt.

And because they didn’t fully know the nature of his quirk, they had allowed him to continue hurting.

(On the bright side, it didn’t seem like Izuku felt any of the owl’s pain while he was just a kid. That was good. He really didn’t think he would be able to bear the thought of Izuku being in constant pain because of something they had all overlooked. Though he did also hope that Izuku would have gone to them about it if he had been in pain. Just, his kid didn’t deserve any of this. Hadn’t he gone through enough yet?)

Uhoo

This time, Izuku hooted, moving to peck at his gloves to gain his attention instead.

“Sorry, ‘Zuku,” He apologized weakly, allowing him to nibble at his gloves a few times before running a couple of fingers down the smooth feathers of his head, “Just lotsa thoughts in my head, ya know?”

‘Yes.’

Frankly, he was amazed that Izuku could still tap that out and remain standing. The wonders of having four toes, he guessed.

“So the conflict has been resolved?” Best Jeanist hummed, leaning forward to peer over at Izuku; Izuku bobbed his head in response, the two blinking at each other, “And it seems all is well enough, barring a possible injury.”

Of course Best Jeanist had noticed it.

He wouldn't be a pro if he hadn’t.

“I’ll be taking him to get it checked out,” He assured him, feeling guilt bubbling up, “We’re still working on control, so we haven’t gotten many chances to work out on the kinks that appear here and there.” Despite the feeling worsening in his belly, he pushed through it, eyes narrowing. “And I shouldn’t have to say this, but Izuku’s identity as my son needs to be kept quiet.”

“Noted,” Best Jeanist gave him a nod, “My lips will be zipped as if they were the zipper of a pair of tight jeans.”

Man, Best Jeanist was such a cool hero.

“I’d take your word for it, but if you don’t mind signing something for me about this, that would be great.”

His own employees knowing about Izuku’s connection to him was one thing (though they also did have their own contracts that would prevent the details of his private life from coming out), a pro that he was not that familiar with was something else.

“Of course.”

“I’m back!”

Ah, and there was Suki with the mop.

He offered his arm to Izuku, his son gingerly hopping on after a second of pause, balancing easily one on leg, the pinpricks of his talons still able to be felt through the sleeve of his leather jacket.

(It seemed that they really needed to invest in another one of those raptor gloves. Shouta already had one, but it wasn’t as if he carried it around with him everywhere and he’d like to carry his owl-son around sometimes too! Not that Izuku needed to be carried since he could fly like this, but it was still nice to give him the option regardless. Plus, those were specifically sized for Shouta’s hands, and his darling husband did have some big hands.)

“Oh, baby,” He cooed, “Just a bit longer and then we can leave and get that leg checked out, okay?”

As much as he’d like to leave right this second, he couldn’t, not without stepping on Jeanist’s denim-clad toes. He’d like to keep good relations with him as well, so he’d just have to do his best to send him off as soon as he could and then get out of here with Izuku.

“I do believe it is time for me to take my leave,” Man, Best Jeanist was good at this. He was grateful though; needing to hustle a fellow pro out so soon left him in bad taste, even though he still did need to hand him that non-disclosure agreement that Nedzu had penned for them for Izuku’s benefit, “We can finish things up here now and then I must head back to my agency.”

“That would be great, thank you,” He swallowed the ‘you’re sure?’ he had been tempted to say. Shouta was right, he was a bit of a people-pleaser at times, “We can chat some more next time.”

“Your son is important to you,” Best Jeanist’s eyes crinkled, “You’re just as Sakamata described, ‘Izuku-kun’s Papa.’”

He didn’t know how that made him feel, that Gang Orca apparently talked about him to others, but it seemed like it was free good rep, so he’d take it.

“Perhaps, we will see each other again, Izuku-kun. It was a pleasure to meet the child that my underclassman kept talking about,” Best Jeanist offered the owl on his arm a curt dip of the head, “And worry not, I will send your regards ahead to Sakamata, as well as news of your well-being and hunting prowess.”

Uhoo

Izuku did seem to like the sound of that, hooting happily at his words.

Well, his son did seem to have a much easier time befriending people older than he was, which was kinda worrying, but he did have little Tenya and Hitoshi-the-cat-food-boy in his corner now.

“Thank you again, Best Jeanist,” Hizashi gave him a grin, knowing full well that it was crooked, “And uh, sorry you had to watch a mouse get eaten. That wasn’t a part of today’s itinerary.”

“I’ve seen worse things being eaten,” Well, alright, “Sakamata had quite interesting lunch choices at times.” And he was distinctly reminded that Gang Orca had mentioned having eaten a seagull before, cool. “There is no need for an apology.”

With that said and a freshly signed NDA passed over to him after it was read, Best Jeanist left, leaving him alone with his son.

“There he goes, huh,” He murmured, “An interesting man, for sure.”

Uhoo

“As for you, ‘Zuku,” Izuku chirped at the sound of his name, “We’re gonna be taking a trip to see Recovery Girl.”


Notes:

    Tsunagu > I met your little owl child the other day.
    Kugo > Oh?
    Tsunagu > He had a mouse in his pocket and then he ate it.
    Kugo > Oh! How delightful! （*＾ワ＾*）

    Hizashi using his big brain to fit together the clues! Meanwhile, Izuku's just very pleased about his snack. He was wanting to cook it, but now that he's an owl, he didn't need to anymore! :D Score!

    But man, Hizashi sure is having a Day; there go his plans for shopping xD

    Izuku finally gets to be an owl again though! Without like, having to be thrown out a window! That's pretty great c:

    And as always, thank you guys so much for the comments! I read them all! Please continue to let me know your thoughts! <3

    Next chapter comes out July 30th or August 6th. Hizashi and Izuku go to U.A.!

    (Edit AUG 07: Looks like I won't be able to get the chapter out on time. I've been really tired these last few weeks and it's taken a toll on the hours I even spend awake, let alone write :( I'll keep trying my best, but until summer is over and I can get more sleep and stuff, I really don't know.)
