throw me a goddamn rope - just enough to hang myself with
mutalune
Summary:

    Shouta’s plan had been ill-defined and desperate from the start, but he figures the important shit boiled down to, “Change as little as possible, make sure Midoriya doesn’t get himself killed, and stock up on lychee jelly pouches because that flavor got discontinued three years from now.” Keeping it simple’s always better, and he’s normally good at improvising.

    Somewhere along the way, he must’ve fucked up since now he has:

        A quirkless problem child hanging off of his every word

        His best friend going through a sexuality crisis thanks to said problem child’s mom

        His other best friend clinging to him like a security blanket

        Some two-bit mob boss threatening him with bouquets of daffodils

        To wring the number one hero’s fucking neck for not telling him anything useful before sending him decades into the past

    All he did was walk Izuku Midoriya home. It wasn’t meant to turn into whatever mess this is.

Notes:

    sending everyone a ton of love during the wild times we're living in - i've pretty much spent the last few months treading water and trying to keep afloat, so this is the first writing i've done in a decent bit (thanks to bnha for being a new fandom to dive into during quarantine and being GREAT at distracting me from thinking about how scary everything is right now!!! appreciate it babe)

    hope you enjoy! i'm not sure where this is going or how far i'll go with it, but i hope everyone enjoys it in the mean time~

Chapter 1: problem child is now tiny problem child
Chapter Text

Shouta Aizawa has regrets. Not that he’s an outlier in that - it’s not exactly an uncommon occurrence in anyone who has made it past their teenage years. 

He looks at his phone - a phone nearly three decades older than what he’s used to - and he tries to reassure himself that he’s at least over teenagerdom in this year. Last he checked, he was approaching sixty but he had long given up on keeping track. For all he knows, he had been closer to seventy than not. 

Now, he thinks he’s in his twenties. Maybe. He was born in…Around… Whenever. Whatever. He’s pretty sure that the math says that he’s twenty-three.  

He doesn’t know if he feels twenty-three. 

If he’s twenty-three, that means that he’s more than allowed to semi-regret the fact that he only went far back enough for Deku to be ten. Not ideal, but it’ll be more time to train him to satisfactory levels before he gets into U.A. Remembering how subpar he was the first time around - Shouta thinks that he can understand why Inko Midoriya was always so stressed out. That quirk of his must’ve been a nightmare at this age. 

Is he even a teacher yet? His phone doesn’t give many hints to what stage of life he’s in. His call log is primarily unsaved numbers that he doesn’t recognize. He has a number of missed calls from Hizashi and Nemuri, but not enough for him to pin down if past-him was in the middle of the depressive episode that eventually led him to apply for a job at U.A. and start getting his teaching degree. 

Not that it matters. He knows what he has to do to stop Shigaraki’s rise and reign of terror. It never would’ve gotten as bad as it did if Izuku “I somehow magically have seven-ish quirks” Midoriya hadn’t been ill-prepared for battle, and it wouldn’t have happened at all if Midoriya had met even half of his potential by the time he met All for One for the first time. 

His problem child won’t die this time. Shouta spent way too long trying to save the world before realizing that it was too late and had been too late for decades. 

Things started much, much earlier than Deku’s death. That was the nail in the coffin for them all, but there’s a reason why Shouta went back as early as he could manage instead of just going back to that day and jumping in front of the kid. 

His phone rings. Hizashi again. 

“Weirdo,” he mutters, sending the call to voicemail. “Now. What was their school’s name? Aldera? Ordera? That’s a middle school though, so if he’s ten…” 

It starts raining - or, it had been raining, but Shouta only notices now. He’s in a park that looks like just about every other park in existence, some trees and flowers and water fountains and screaming kids. The usual. 

He doesn’t remember where he lives at this point in time. Doesn’t remember what he was doing on this specific day, wandering around a park in the middle of the day with only his phone and wallet on him. It seems out of character for him at any age. 

God, he’s tired. 

It’s a park, so there’s benches. He finds one that isn’t occupied, ignores his buzzing phone, curls up on it, and passes out almost immediately.

Shouta comes to a few hours later. There’s someone walking towards him with tiny, tiny footsteps. He doesn’t sit up right away because he’s basking in how few aches and pains he currently has. It’s been decades since he woke up in such a good mood. 

“‘Scuse me, sir? Are you okay?” 

Aw. 

That’s sweet. Annoying since it woke him up, but sweet.  Kids sure are something.

“‘M fine. Go play somewhere else, kid.” 

“O-okay! Sorry for bothering you!” Those tiny footsteps run in the opposite direction. Presumably off to pick dandelions or eat dirt. 

Shouta rolls over and watches a head of fluffy green hair dart to the jungle gym. Blearily, he wonders what the likelihood would be of there being two green-haired children that have more kindness than is good for them. After pondering that for a beat, he sits up and decides he isn’t nearly that lucky. 

There’s half a dozen kids hanging around and playing innocently when he starts walking in the direction his problem child went off in. 

Of course, his problem child isn’t one of those peaceful kids. His problem child is the one getting chased by three other non-peaceful kids. Midoriya is already bruised and panting, and his tiny (tiny! Deku’s never been very tall, but this one is so small. Shouta wonders if he guessed his age wrong, because that kid looks way too small to be ten) legs are pumping as fast as he can make them go. The kids chasing him are obviously brats - one of them is flying overhead, circling and spitting on Midoriya when he passes. Another is throwing rocks, the third is cackling like a hyena, and the last one is, unsurprisingly, Bakugou Katsuki. 

Bakugou is the one who catches Midoriya, who in return is already crying. Shouta gives up any hope that this is some heroes vs. villains play-fight when the hand gripping Midoriya’s wrist sparks and burns pale - already scarred - flesh. Midoriya yelps and tries to jump back, but Bakugou’s holding onto him too tightly and already preparing himself to set off another explosion with his free hand, right near Midoriya’s face. 

Shouta sighs, activates his quirk, and says, “It’s my day off, you know. I shouldn’t have to be babysitting some villain wanna-bes.” 

“EH?” Bakugou yells, charming as ever. “Whaddya want, old man?” 

His cronies chime in with, “Yeah!” “What, old man!” “Old man!” 

“I want you to stop harassing and bullying this kid,” Shouta says bluntly. “But for now I’ll settle for you going away before I call the cops for illegal quirk usage. Or beat your scrawny asses for annoying me.” 

Bakugou lets go of Midoriya, who collapses to the ground and scrambles away from his tormentor. The brat stalks forward and holds his palms up threateningly at Shouta. “I’m gonna be a hero, you know! I’ll beat your ass!” 

“You won’t be a hero with that kind of attitude. Beating on someone who won’t fight back is what villains do.” Bakugou snarls, then snarls louder when his quirk continues to not work. Shouta is unimpressed. “Scram, kid.” 

There’s some more hemming and hawing, but when it’s clear that Shouta won’t budge, the brats grumble and send some parting shots (“Freak needs a fucking hobo to save him, what a loser - “) before disappearing across the street. Midoriya is trembling on the ground and still a bit teary, but it’s mostly overshadowed by the way he’s looking at Shouta with a mix of apprehension and adoration. 

Weird. 

“Kid, let me see your arm. That looks like it hurts.” 

Midoriya swipes at his eyes and shakes his head. “It’s okay! Kacchan does this all the time, ‘m used to it. S’not so bad.” 

In three sentences, Shouta has now learned more about why his problem child is such a problem child than he did in two decades of teaching and working with the man. If he wasn’t equally reticent when talking about his past, he’d wonder why Midoriya never brought this up to him the first time around. 

Shouta crouches down next to him and carefully reaches out for his arm. Midoriya looks like a confused puppy, head tilting this way and that as Shouta peers at the burns on his arm. “You know that it’s wrong of him to do that, right? He shouldn’t hurt you.” 

“Oh, well. K-kacchan’s gonna be a hero, y’know, and I’m just. Me.” 

“Heroes don’t hurt people.” Shouta pauses, considers the fact that he just blatantly lied, and corrects it to, “Well, they don’t hurt people like that. You should punch him back.” 

Midoriya sucks in a sharp breath. “Oh n-no, no. No. He wouldn’t like that. And I’m just. He’d be r-really mad! Really really mad. It’s really not that bad, really.” 

Shouta raises an eyebrow, then holds up Midoriya’s bright red arm. There’s multiple layers of burns in varying stages of healing, and more than a few scars. “Really?” 

His face flushes as red as the burns on his arm. “Um.” 

“Well, regardless. A pro-hero shouldn’t encourage illegal quirk usage, but if you did use your quirk against him, I wouldn’t fault you for it when he’s clearly been using you as a glorified punching bag for awhile.” 

He wilts immediately. Slumps, tugs his arm out of Shouta’s grip, and backs up a few steps. “Oh. I. Well, I couldn’t even if I wanted to. I’m quirkless.” 

Shouta's mouth says, “Fuck,” before his brain can catch up. 

Midoriya curls in on himself further. “Um. Sorry?” 

“What are you apologizing for? You didn’t do anything wrong. I just didn’t realize those kids were bullying you because of that. That’s way different than them just not liking you. Do your teachers know? They should have the kids in counseling for quirk discrimination.” 

The kid glances up. He recites, with the certainty that comes from being told something frequently, “Teachers say it’s not their responsibility to coddle sensitive kids like me. I need to toughen up, especially since I’m already at a disadvantage and weaker than the other kids, so it won’t benefit me if they fight my battles for me.” 

Shouta wouldn’t claim that he’s a great teacher - he’s cold and stern in a way that intimidates even the boldest kids. He expels more kids than he teaches, but those that he teaches, he thinks he does a decent enough job. Thus, he feels more than qualified to say, “You’ve had shitty teachers. That’s fucked up.” 

He shrugs. For a young kid who just admitted he has been discriminated against for a number of years, he seems remarkably unbothered. Even now, minutes after he had been harassed by a bunch of punks, he’s brushing himself off and perking up. 

Shouta's been in the past for, at most, a few hours, and he’s learning more about his problem child than he learned in literal decades of knowing the brat. He wishes Deku was around so he could kick his ass. 

Instead, he’s stuck with a knobby-kneed, traumatized child who thinks he’s quirkless. 

“Sir, um. C-can I ask you something?” 

“You already did, but I can spare another. What is it?” 

The kid visibly steels himself. Clenches his fists, straightens his shoulders, and looks him in the eye. “Um. Your quirk. You used it to stop Kacchan from using his? So, um, was it dependent on eye contact or just concentration?” 

Scratch that. He’s stuck with a knobby-kneed, traumatized child genius who thinks he’s quirkless .

Chapter Text

As they knock on the Midoriyas’ apartment door, Shouta puts a hand on Midoriya’s head and forces him to look up at him. His head cocks to the side curiously. 

“In the future,” Shouta says softly. “If a stranger offers to take you home or acts too familiarly, you really should run and get someone you know or a police officer. Okay?” 

Midoriya’s eyebrows furrow. “Um. Okay?" 

The door swings open before he can ask why that seems like brand-new advice, and a familiar face ducks out. “Izuku! Did you forget your key again? I keep telling you to put it on a lanyard, dear, I swear you’d lose your head if it wasn’t attached.“  

“M-mom! We have a guest!” 

“Guest is stretching it,” Shouta says blandly. He holds out a hand to Inko Midoriya, who suddenly looks up at him. What is it like to be a parent who automatically bends over to look at their kid first? Who automatically adjusts to look at waist-height, where a child’s eyes would be? She hadn’t even noticed him until she had ascertained that her son was well. In all his years as a teacher, he had never grown instincts like that towards any of his charges. “Mrs. Midoriya, my name’s Shouta Aizawa. I don’t want to invite myself in, but there’s a few matters I’d like to speak to you about.” 

She shakes his hand a little warily. Her eyes dart down to Izuku, who blinks back up at her guilelessly. “Of course. Please, come in. Izuku, please go clean up? You look like you were rolling around in the dirt again.” 

“Yes’m!” He turns to Shouta, bows and says, “Thank you again, sir!”, then darts into the apartment and disappears from sight. 

“Kids are so energetic.” He yawns. “Makes me tired, if I’m being honest. I don’t know how parents put up with it.” 

Something about what he said, or how he said it, puts Inko at ease. She laughs, shoulders releasing some tension, and she ushers him in. “You get used to it pretty quickly. Learn how to take naps when they’re not looking. Cup of wine when they’re asleep.” 

“A cup?” 

“Our glasses didn’t survive the terrible twos. I might upgrade from plastic cups when Izuku gets to high school and he doesn’t drop everything.” She rolls her eyes fondly. “My clumsy little dope. He’s a sweetheart, really.” 

Shouta would use a lot of words to describe Midoriya. “Sweetheart” is something his friends might use, but Shouta would rather use, “pain in the ass.” He doesn’t say that to this Inko, though, because she doesn’t know him yet and would likely think he was just a stranger being a jerk to her only son. 

Inko leads him to the couch and asks, “Can I get you something to drink?” 

“No, thank you.” 

She takes a seat across from him in a chair that looks like something a grandma would knit in and asks, “Then how can I help you, Mr. Aizawa?” 

“Hm, it’s not really that kind of situation. I just wanted to bring a few things to your attention. Primarily, the fact that I had to stop three little shits from wailing on your son.” His phone is, once again, buzzing in his pocket. Hizashi must be feeling particularly needy today. “Did you know that he’s being bullied for not having a quirk? It seems to be an ongoing thing.” 

Her lips tighten. “Unfortunately, yes. I didn’t know they were bothering him outside of school too, though.” 

“Bothering? They were beating him.” 

“Izuku is upset by harsh words like that. He won’t tell me anything if I call it what it is.” She gives him a forced smile. “Thank you for bringing it to my attention. That’s more than what anyone else has tried to do in the past. It means a lot, Mr. Aizawa.” 

“Your standards are pitifully low.” 

Inko’s smile becomes less forced. “And yet, here you are rising above them. I appreciate it regardless.” 

They’re silent for a moment while the shower starts. Shouta absentmindedly wonders how much the hot water must hurt on the burns Bakugou gave him. He wonders if Deku’s insane pain tolerance started much earlier than when he started breaking every bone in his body. 

“Would you agree to me training Izuku in self-defense? He seems like he needs it.” 

Inko stares at him. He stares back, unaffected. Slowly, she says, “You’ll understand my hesitance to let a random man start having lessons with my vulnerable child. I don’t know you.” 

“I’m Shouta Aizawa. Pro-hero Eraserhead. Feel free to look me up.” He pulls out his wallet and hands her his hero license for good measure. 

The ID is scrutinized, turned towards the light, flipped around, and felt all over. Shouta isn’t sure what information she’s gleaning from her investigation, but if it makes her feel better about his interest, she can knock herself out. 

She eventually hands it back to him and asks, “What does a pro-hero want with a quirkless little boy?” 

“Train him. He wants to be a hero, right? I’m sure he finds his fair share of trouble.” 

Tension returns to her posture. Her demeanor is noticeably warier as she asks, “There’s a lot of kids that want to be heroes. Even more kids that find themselves in trouble. Why my son?” 

To think that Inko Midoriya had been even more protective before Izuku went to U.A. Shouta has always had the utmost respect for parents that aren’t total dicks to their kids, but he’ll admit he had once thought Inko was a spineless wimp. He respected her for raising someone as difficult as Izuku, but he thought she was a pushover and that her lack of authority was why Izuku continued to recklessly endanger himself. 

After U.A. began boarding and the kids moved into the dorms, Shouta quickly realized that Inko Midoriya is far from spineless, has never been a pushover, and is, in fact, someone to rely on in just about any situation. She cares for her son with a viciousness that Shouta sees more often in rabid dogs than parents - if she had been dealing with Izuku being discriminated against for the entirety of his formative years, he can understand her intensity. There were many times where he walked in on her and Nedzu having tea with smiles and exchanging cold words. 

(Nedzu once told Shouta that Inko was his favorite human.)

Deku, because he was always a moron, never knew how many battles his mom had fought for him behind the scenes while he was busy breaking himself over and over again. Saving him from having to pay for property damage, from having to face consequences for actions that weren’t his fault but could’ve been pinned on him if anyone dumber than his mom had been speaking in his favor… Maybe this time around he’ll be able to convince the brat to be a little more aware and grateful. 

Shouta says, “Your son seems like he needs someone in his corner,” and it isn’t a lie. From the minute Deku walked into his classroom all those years ago (five years from now), he knew that this was a kid who felt like it was him against the world. He’s only just realizing that there was more to that belief than teenage arrogance, but Shouta’s never been one to let stagnant beliefs fester. He thought Deku was an angsty brat, now he knows he’s an angsty brat with childhood trauma. Different approaches are necessary. 

And Toshinori used to accuse him of being insensitive. 

“Kids with flashy quirks don’t need a hand up. The Bakugou brat that was giving Izuku a hard time - he’ll be told every day that he’s going to be successful. Maybe not in so many words, but by teachers’ actions and adults fawning over him even when he’s acting like a little shit.” He snorts, crossing his arms and leaning back in his seat. “It’s kids like yours that need extra support. He’s a smart kid, and I can tell he has a good heart. That’s infinitely more useful in life than someone who can punch really hard or blow things up.” 

Inko’s head tilts - something he said makes her eyes soften once more, and she gives him a tired smile. “Mr. Aizawa, I’m a single mother. I can’t pay you.” 

Shouta scoffs. “I don’t need your money. I’m a teacher - I like teaching. I think I’d like teaching your kid if he’ll take it seriously. That’s all.” 

She raises an eyebrow. “Are you sure you can afford to teach him for free? Forgive me, but you look to be going through a rough patch.” 

Shouta rolls his eyes. “Just because I don’t bother with my hair - “ 

“You clearly haven’t showered in at least a week,” Inko says bluntly. “Likely more, but I don’t want to assume. Your nails are filthy, and with how pale you are, I’d be surprised if you aren’t at least somewhat anemic. You’re dehydrated and thinner than a pro-hero should be. So either you’re not a pro-hero and you’re trying to take advantage of my son, or you’re new, haven’t signed with an agency yet, and are just arrogant enough to think that you can succeed as a hero without taking into account how much your diet and environment play into your capabilities.” 

Ouch. 

He holds his hands out in front of him, noting the way they tremble ever-so-slightly and the pale gauntness. She’s right that his nails are caked in dirt and grime. It says something about the state he’s in that Inko had to be the one to point out that he traveled back to what was probably the lowest era of his life. 

Good to know he was wrong about Izuku’s age - he had been concerned about how small the boy seemed. Shouta must be somewhere around twenty, meaning Izuku is seven or eight. 

He finally knows why he was in that park - It’s one of the few places he can safely catch a nap during the day. Plus, there’s a tree right inside of the forest that has a hole in its stump just big enough for him to fit his sleeping bag when he’s not using it. It was adequate enough shelter for the transition phase between attending U.A. himself and building enough of a reputation to become a reputable (and, therefore, adequately paid) hero without an agency backing him. 

“Hm. I forgot that I’m currently homeless.” He shrugs. “Regardless. I won't charge you.” 

It’s barely a lie. 

(Not a great one, but fairly true nonetheless.) 

“You forgot ?” 

He shrugs again. “It’s been an interesting day.” 

They sit in silence for a few moments before Shouta decides he’s done with this interaction. Either she’ll let him train Izuku or she won’t and he’ll go behind her back - he doesn’t have any other option. It’ll be easier with Inko’s help, but he has too much to accomplish and he needs Deku for it to work. 

He stands up and bows. “Please consider my offer. I’ll leave my number with you and you can - “ 

“Oh, none of that.” She waves her hands, and when he stares at her blankly, she reaches out and gently pushes him back into his seat. “You have nowhere to stay, right?” 

“I did just say that I was - “ 

“You’ll stay with us at least for tonight. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I didn’t send you off with a hot meal and a good night of sleep.” 

“Mrs. Midoriya - “ 

“Assuming that you aren’t here to murder us in our sleep, we’ll talk about the details tomorrow. I wouldn’t feel right having you teach Izuku without any compensation, so perhaps a place to stay can be payment for now. We can work out the details after you’ve rested.” 

Shouta’s throat is tight. He croaks, “You’re being too generous.” 

“You’re underestimating how rare it is for us to find people who treat us kindly once they find out Izuku is quirkless. It’s selfish, but I like to keep the few decent people in the world close once I find them.” She smiles at him brightly and pats his head, then retreats to the kitchen. “We’re having katsudon for dinner - is that fine with you?” 

Shouta has had a long day. He lays down on the couch, throws an arm over his eyes, and murmurs, “Sure, whatever,” before sliding into a short nap.

Chapter Text

Shouta wakes up some time later to the sound of a child gasping in delight and a mother laughing. It makes him want to gag, if he’s being honest, because that kind of sweetness is sickening. 

It doesn’t stop him from sitting up and ruffling Izuku’s hair when the kid walks over. He’s vibrating with excitement as he says, “Mr. ‘Zawa! Mom’s making katsudon!” 

“So I heard.” 

“Katsudon’s my favorite!” 

“Is it?” 

“Mm-hm!” Izuku pauses for a moment, then asks, “What’s your favorite, Mr. ‘Zawa?” 

“My favorite?” He scrubs at his eyes tiredly and hums in thought. “Jelly.” 

Izuku nods solemnly. “Jelly is good. I like red flavor.” 

“Red’s good. Blue’s good too.” 

“Ick.” 

“Ick? Blue’s better than orange, though.” 

Izuku’s face scrunches up in thought, like this is the most important conversation he’s ever had. After a long silence, he says, “I think blue is better than orange, but orange is better than purple.” 

He tries not to roll his eyes and somehow succeeds. “I’m so glad we could find common ground.” 

For some reason, his halfhearted response has Izuku beaming at him. 

And this characterizes the rest of the night. Shouta gives lackluster responses, shovels food into his mouth rudely, and barely keeps from falling asleep at the table. In return, Inko and Izuku smile and chatter happily. Inko gives him seconds even when he protests, and Izuku talks at length about a new teacher at his school that has a quirk that lets him affect how light reflects off of objects. 

“ - and I wanted to ask if he can cause visual hallucinations because eyes only work since there’s light so there’s gotta be ways he can alter - well, unless it’s a physical affectation rather than a perceptual one… I’d have to see if he can trigger solar panels or some other light-sensing technology to see if it’s physical or if it’s perceptual - “ 

Inko picks up their plates and takes them into the kitchen, humming distractedly at Izuku’s babbling in absentminded encouragement. Izuku grabs the utensils and glasses, continuing his speech about Mr. What’s-His-Name. Their routine must be well-established, as neither of them falter or even look at each other as they put dishes into the sink for Inko to wash. Inko hands the cleaned items to Izuku, who dries them when he remembers to take a breath, then dashes off to put them away one-by-one. 

Shouta never had a functional family, so he’s not sure if this is normal or if the Midoriyas are straight out of a slice-of-life manga. He can’t tell if the feeling in his throat is jealousy or indigestion. 

Inko clearly loves her son, just as much as her son adores her. Shouta is hard-pressed to remember what his mother looked like, and he knows he never looked at her with anything other than a quiet sadness. He was a quiet kid who grew into a quiet, bitter adult that is just depressed enough to accept his lot in life, just arrogant enough to think he can save others, and just desperate enough to try over and over and over - 

Before his thoughts can start spiraling, a small hand tugs at his shirt. Izuku holds up the cup Inko had been drinking from with his other hand and asks, “Mr. ‘Zawa, I can’t reach. Can you put this back?” 

He takes it automatically. “Where?” 

“Up, to the left - Yeah, there! Can you put this up there too?” 

And, completely seamlessly, they welcome him. 

Inko washes, Izuku dries, and Shouta is sent to put items in their proper places. It doesn’t escape his notice that Izuku is just tall enough to reach where the majority of plates and cups are kept, but no one draws attention to the fact that there’s no real reason he needs to help. The chattering about mundane topics continues with little input from Shouta, who is busy trying to figure out their convoluted organizational system. 

When the sink is turned off and Inko and Izuku have finished exchanging an overly enthusiastic high-five, Inko turns to Shouta. She wipes her hands on the apron around her waist and says, “Izuku, Mr. Aizawa here said that he was a teacher earlier. Maybe he can help you with that math you’ve been struggling with…?” 

Izuku spins and looks at him with an utterly gobsmacked expression. “You’re a teacher?! But you’re so nice !” 

Shouta says, “Your standards are incredibly low if you consider me nice.” 

“You’re SO nice! You haven’t yelled at me once or told me to shut up or glared at me and you know I’m quirkless!” Izuku is bouncing on his feet. “That’s amazing!” 

“It’s really not.” 

“Honey, that’s not all.” Inko’s lips are curled into a gentle, mischievous smile. It somehow manages to fill Shouta with an uncalled for dread. “He’s a teacher and - you can keep a secret, Izuku, right?” 

Izuku nods so furiously that Shouta fears his head will bob off and roll under the table. “I can keep a secret! I’m really good at keeping secrets!” He mimes zipping his lips shut and throwing away the key. 

“You can’t tell anyone at school about this, but Mr. Aizawa here - “ she points at him, as if there’s anyone else in the house that could be mistaken for being him. “Is not only a teacher, but also a pro-hero.” 

For one, singular moment, the entire apartment is silent. Inko’s eyes crinkle as her smile widens. 

In the next, Izuku’s eyes widen and he shrieks . Shouta flinches. 

“MR. ‘ZAWA IS A NICE TEACHER AND A HERO?! THAT’S AMAZING I CAN’T BELIEVE WE HAVE A REAL ACTUAL HERO HERE A REAL ACTUAL HERO SAVED ME AND BROUGHT ME HOME AND WEATEDINNERWITHAPROHEROMOMTHAT’SSOCOOLMR.’ZAWAISSOCOOL - “ 

“Breathe, baby.” 

Izuku takes a dramatic gasp of breath before rounding on Shouta. “MR. ‘ZAWA YOU’RE THE COOLEST CAN I HAVE YOUR AUTOGRAPH WHAT’S YOUR HERO NAME WHAT DO YOU TEACH CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT YOUR QUIRK WHAT’S IT LIKE BEING A HERO CAN I SEE YOUR HERO LICENSE CAN I - “ 

Shouta, pretty sure that his ears are about to explode, cuts in with, “If you use your inside voice when asking, I’ll answer your questions.” 

Izuku’s mouth immediately shuts, he closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, before nodding firmly. He’s still vibrating and bouncing in place, clearly delighted, but the next time he talks it’s not on par with a banshee’s wail. “Can I have your autograph please Mr. ‘Zawa and what’s your hero name and what do you teach and what’s your quirk and can I see your hero license please and - “ he pauses suddenly, and in that pause, at least half of his energy leaks out of his teeny tiny body. His bouncing slows to a fidget, and he ducks his head. 

Shouta sighs, then kneels down in front of him. Gently, he props Izuku’s chin up with one finger, forcing him to make eye contact. “Yes, I’ll give you my autograph. My hero name is Eraserhead - I’m an underground hero, so you probably haven’t heard of me. I’m not an official teacher yet, but I’m going to teach heroics and general studies, and I’ve taught self-defense and hand-to-hand in the past. My quirk is Erasure, which stops people from using their quirks. I’ll show you my hero license later when I sign whatever you want me to sign. And you clearly have one more question that you want to ask, so spit it out.” 

“Um. I just. You know that I’m quirkless.” His eyes dart towards the floor. 

“Yes, that’s been established already.” 

“Um. Do… Do you think that someone quirkless can become a hero?” The second the words leave his lips, barely louder than a whisper, he acts like he’s bracing for a blow, shutting his eyes tightly and scrunching his entire face up into an anxious grimace. 

Shouta, admittedly, has rarely thought about what being quirkless must be like. When All Might could no longer use his quirk, the man was essentially quirkless and had struggled with his self-worth and recurring feelings of uselessness and inferiority. Shouta, not one to coddle, had told the man to pick himself up and move the fuck on. He remembers saying, “There’s more to life than a quirk. If you were a hero just because of your quirk, then you’re a shittier guy than even I thought.” 

That had worked for All Might, because no matter how much he acted like a kicked puppy when people scolded him, he responded better without kiddie gloves on. Now, with this minute glance into what life is like for someone growing up (presumed) quirkless in a society that puts so much weight on what genetics decided to give them - Shouta can’t imagine what Izuku Midoriya has had to face. He can’t imagine how much this kid has been hurt and beat down, can’t comprehend what’s been put into this kid’s head since age four came and went without any fanfare, what must be going through this kid’s head on a daily basis, and most of all he can’t understand how all of that culminates in a unique, intelligent boy who would tear off his own limbs if it would help someone else and still has the strength to smile and be kind . 

He reaches out and grasps Izuku’s shoulder tightly, squeezing it solemnly. He says, “Of course. Being a hero isn’t about having any special abilities. It’s about doing the right thing, even if it’s hard. It’s about working hard to protect the people you care about, the people you don’t care about, and even the people you hate. If you’re willing to work hard and work smart, then you can absolutely be a hero.” 

He isn’t surprised that both Midoriyas burst into tears, but Izuku tackling him into a decidedly fierce hug for a seven-or-maybe-eight-he-thinks-year-old is a little unexpected. Small arms tighten around his neck and threaten to choke him, there’s tears and snot sliding down his collarbone, his ears are ringing with sobs, and his cell phone is buzzing in his pocket again . 

Shouta sighs. Changing the past has been a nuisance all around so far. “Can we skip the hysterics and start on your math? You’re like five, what are you even doing? Counting?” 

“I’m seven!” Izuku wails, somehow clutching him tighter. “I-I’m t-t-trying to multiply decimals so so s-so I c-can predict hero scores w-when they move up in the ranks!” 

Shouta looks over at Inko, who has slid to the floor and is leaning against the cabinet he had to crouch down to put their bowls back into. She’s crying and scrubbing at her face, hiccuping every few breaths. He sardonically asks, “Your son learns new math concepts for fun?” 

Inko sniffles and laughs, nods and wipes tears off of her cheeks. “That’s my boy. He’s a smart cookie.” 

“You must be proud.” It’s said sarcastically, but Shouta can feel fondness oozing out of him against his will. Without his permission, his hand comes up and pats the fluffy hair tickling his cheek. 

She chokes on another laugh and nods again and again and again. “Immensely. And you’re going to take good care of my little hero, right?” 

For some reason, that makes Izuku cry harder. 

For an odder, more inexplicable reason, it makes Shouta want to cry too. 

“Of course,” he says hoarsely.

Notes:

    kindness??? in my comments section??? it's more likely than you think

    (aka: thank you all for reading and enjoying <3 i'm glad that inko's lowkey adoption of shouta was so well-received, especially b/c it means that her outright adoption of him will likely be well-received as well!!!!!! this was also just added to a collection as well which??? wow??? you all are the best thank u so much ~ )

Chapter Text

There isn’t much to discuss after such an emotional beginning. The next morning, Shouta gracelessly rolls off of the couch, Inko and him drink a cup of coffee together, and she says, “Teach Izuku how to defend himself and how to be a hero, and you can stay on our couch until you get back on your feet or get a better offer. Deal?” 

Shouta, knowing that he won't intrude longer than he has to and this will be a non-issue soon enough, says, “Deal." 

“Get settled in for a few days, we’ll talk about what you’ll be training him this weekend and what your long-term plans are. We’ll wait to tell Izuku until we’ve ironed out the details. Otherwise, he’ll get so excited he won’t sleep until you wear him out with your plan.” 

“Noted.” 

“And if you wouldn’t mind walking him to school in the mornings - if you have the time, I mean - I would appreciate it. I have to leave for work so he normally goes with Katsuki, but if there’s any other option…” 

It’s a minuscule favor, in the grand scheme of things. “Sure.” 

“Great! I’ll write out our morning routine and what he’ll need some help on - Izuku’s pretty good about getting his backpack together, but we’ve had some mishaps in the past with him losing his lunchbox or forgetting homework assignments, so a second pair of eyes won’t go amiss.” 

“Sure. Whatever you need.” 

Inko beams and reaches over to pat his hand lightly. “You’re a good kid. Let me know if you need anything, I’ll be heading to the store after work and picking up groceries. Izuku can give you my number.” 

“You’re really lucky that the homeless guy you took in isn’t a complete psycho who will take advantage of your reckless generosity.” 

She finishes her coffee, grinning while she stands up and grabs her briefcase. “I’m incredibly lucky, Mr. Aizawa. I won’t deny it. Help yourself to anything in the kitchen, dear. I’ll be home around six!” She clears her throat, then yells louder, “Izuku! Mr. Aizawa is going to take you to school - I’m off!” 

Tiny feet slap against the floor, followed by a messy mop of green bedhead and a mouth covered in toothpaste. Izuku - still so small that Shouta struggles to reconcile him with the image of Deku he has in his head - smiles through his toothbrush and waves with his free hand. He lets out a garbled, “Bye Mama!” as Inko blows him a kiss. 

They’re sickeningly sweet. Shouta kind of wants to gag as Inko walks out the door, kind of wants to lay on the couch and bask in their warmth until he forgets the world he came from and how he got here in the first place. 

He makes a token effort at cleaning himself up some, but he’s never been one for excessive grooming even when he had access to equipment for it. Inko had been kind enough to give him a spare toothbrush the night before, so he at least brushes his teeth and finger brushes his hair. By the time he’s finished, Izuku is dressed and shoving books and papers into his bookbag. 

“Mr. ‘Zawa - “ 

“Let’s get you to school. If you start asking questions now, we won’t make it out the door. You have everything you need?” 

“Mmhm!” He darts past Shouta to sit down near the front door to start pulling on a pair of garishly red sneakers. “Today’s Wednesday and we’re having an assembly today about not doing drugs and stuff and I heard a rumor that Copter Raptor is running it! He was injured a few weeks ago so it’d make sense if his agency was using his recovery time as an opportunity for building his public image up but I hope he isn’t too injured because that’d be sad and while I’m excited to see him I don’t want - “ 

“Alright, yes, I agree. That’s a good guess for why he’d be there, if he’s going to be there. Now let’s go before you’re late.” 

The walk is like any other walk with an energetic child would be. Izuku babbles about whatever whim passes his mind at the time, Shouta listens with half an ear and tries not to fall asleep standing up, and he makes sure Izuku doesn’t accidentally walk into a telephone pole. During all of this, he ignores Hizashi’s repeated calls and lets his phone ring out over and over again. 

This is the routine for the rest of the week. 

After taking an hour to go pick up the few belongings he still had, he would either go on patrol during the day, pick up odd jobs, or start mapping out what he’s going to need to accomplish in the next few years to ensure a better future than the one he left. Despite the strange circumstances, Shouta feels like he’s taking a vacation. When he’s finished with whatever task he’s taken on for the day, he walks Izuku home from school, gets him a snack on the way home, and keeps him entertained until Inko comes home and cooks dinner. They clean dishes together, settle in for a movie, or Izuku pulls one or both of them into playing some sort of game. 

Shouta, if he were the kind of man to get embarrassed, would be red in the face admitting that he's become extremely proficient at playing “heroes and villains” with Izuku. 

(“Just for a few minutes,” Izuku had pleaded with those large, glistening eyes of his. “You gotta be the villain and chase me and I’m the hero and I’ll run away or I can be the villain and chase you but you’re already a hero so it wouldn’t be playing pretend that way and - “ 

“How,” Shouta asked slowly. “Can you possibly. Have. This much. Energy.” 

Izuku proceeded to fall over and beg and plead at Shouta’s feet until the man sighed and said, “Ten second head start. Get going.” He justified it later as practice for when Shouta will really start to train him, since this game is essentially themed tag. 

Izuku shrieked every time Shouta caught him underneath his armpits, swinging him around in a circle before letting the kid wriggle out of his grasp. Inko eventually sent them outside so they wouldn’t accidentally break anything and thus cemented grass stains as a permanent addition to Shouta’s wardrobe.)

By the end of the week, with how frequently Izuku wants to play and how weak Shouta is to the problem child’s doe-eyes, Inko has enough photographic evidence to ruin Eraserhead’s reputation forever. 

It’s unnervingly comfortable to slip into their lives and start caring about them. He had figured that mini-Deku would reel him in against his will, the way he made friends with just about anyone who sat still long enough and wasn’t actively murdering someone else, but he hadn’t expected the intensity of it. He hadn’t expected how much Inko’s kindness would get under his skin. 

Quiet cups of coffee in the morning, when the sun’s just starting to rise, is company he doesn’t mind. Without his consent, he perks up when he hears Izuku’s alarm go off. He has to bite back grins when Izuku comes barreling out of his room to hug his mother and wait patiently for Shouta to poke his forehead with a grumbled, “Your breath stinks, problem child.” 

On Saturday morning, Izuku is sleeping in like any kid would. Inko doesn’t work weekends, so she pours them both a second cup after she finishes her first. She raises an eyebrow at him, waiting to see if he’ll start the conversation they need to have - and Shouta realizes he doesn’t want to leave. 

In his mind, the conversation would end with him getting Inko to approve the training plan he had put together, thanking her for her hospitality, and walking out the door with his sleeping bag and the toothbrush Inko was nice enough to buy for him. He’d pick a different park so he wouldn’t run into Izuku outside of their designated training times and he’d make sure to spend his next paycheck on a gym membership so he could shower and let Inko think he had found somewhere to stay. 

Shouta never thought he would be so selfish as to consider intruding longer than he already had. Already, some part of his stupid, defective brain is whispering offers he could make to convince Inko to let him continue mooching off of her. He’ll pay partial rent, he’ll do the grocery shopping, he’ll learn how to cook, he’ll walk Izuku to and from school and help with his homework, he’ll beat the crap out of Bakugou next time the kid lays a hand on Izuku, he’ll clean and do whatever she wants him to if she’ll let him keep basking in their warmth. 

Ick. 

He shakes his head, trying to knock the pathetic desperation out. He’s really the most pitiful option they picked for this mission, isn’t he? A selfish bastard who’s already getting distracted by the first people to give him a hot meal, putting his wants before the world’s needs - 

“What has you thinking so hard, Shouta?” 

He sips at his mug and sighs. “Nothing important. I’m assuming you want to discuss Izuku’s training.” 

“That, and I think it’d be good for us to talk about getting you settled in more.” 

Shouta shakes his head immediately. “Unnecessary. I’ll be out of your hair by the end of the day.” 

One time, when Shouta was on patrol, he saw a kitten. It was small and adorable. The pitiful thing was cuddled up against a lump of what must have been its mother, crying and mewing until Shouta dragged it away. He went to take it to the closest vet, but it died before he got there. For some reason, whether it was because of the dead cats or if the dead cats were merely what pushed him over the edge, he had called off patrol for the first time in years to get outrageously drunk and lie in bed for three days straight. 

The look Inko gives him makes him feel ten times worse than the dead kitten did. 

“O-oh. I - Did you already find another place?” she asks with painfully forced cheer. Her smile makes him feel sick. 

“I have - “ 

“I was actually - Oh, well, I guess it doesn’t matter.” 

“What?” 

She shakes her head. “You’re going to think I’m silly, but I spoke with the landlord, Mrs. Watanabe, and it turns out there’s a unit opening up down the hall that has four bedrooms. She was saying that it’d be okay for us to move there even though the lease for the year isn’t up yet.” Inko gives him a sheepish smile and puts her mug down to ring her hands together. “B-but! If you already found a place, I guess that won’t be necessary.” 

Shouta stares at her long enough that she starts blushing and avoids his eyes, mumbling something unintelligible under her breath. In disbelief, he asks, “Do you want me to stay?” 

She somehow ducks her head further and mutters, “I wouldn’t want to pressure you - “ 

“Yes or no. Do you want me, a homeless idiot who has to be reminded to eat and wants to teach your son how to throat punch villains, to stay?” 

Inko says, “I didn’t know that a throat punch was all that different than a regular punch.” 

“Inko.” 

“Well!” She fidgets, doesn’t meet his eyes, then sighs and slumps in her seat. “Yes. Okay? And I realize it’s ridiculous. You’re a grown man and I’m sure you have your own life and places to be and people your age to meet and have fun with but you make Izuku so happy and it’s selfish but I’ve been sleeping better knowing that someone as capable as you is here and walking my son to and from school - do you know when the last time I saw my son so happy was? This is the first week where he hasn’t come home with injuries that he’s too afraid to talk to me about and that’s not a coincidence so of course I want you to stay and I’m sorry to put this on you and I’m sorry - “ here, she hiccups and her eyes start watering. “I’m sorry that I’m taking advantage of your kindness and now I’m crying all over you - “ 

“Please stop crying,” he says, pained. “I’ll stay if you stop crying. I was just being polite.” 

“Huh?” 

“I thought I was being considerate by leaving. I don’t actually have anywhere else to go.” 

She sniffles. “You don’t?”

“I was going to find a bench to sleep on.” It’s silent as Inko stares at him incredulously, her tears drying the longer she judges him. He adds, “It’s not as bad on your back as you’d think.” 

“Please don’t sleep on a bench. We’ll get you a bed once we move to the bigger apartment.” 

“I don’t want to make you move. The couch is fine.” 

“The couch is fine because you’re so young. Give it five years and you’ll need a chiropractor on call if you keep sleeping there.” 

The sad thing - she’s almost right. He did need regular appointments for his back once he hit thirty. Whether it’s due to his years sleeping in strange places or age or hero injuries he sustained is unclear, but sleeping on a couch that looks older than him probably won’t help. 

“I don’t want to be an inconvenience.” 

Inko says, “Family never is, and I’d like you to join ours. Please stay.” 

It’s a blatant lie. Family is the most inconvenient thing there is. It’s emotions and obligation tied up in a neat little package called “Dysfunction” and mailed with no return-to-sender address. Family has never been anything more than an albatross around his neck, waiting for him to slip up and pounce when he’s at his most vulnerable. 

Because it’s already been established that Shouta is a selfish, pathetic bastard who doesn't know when to quit trying, he says, “Okay,” then leaves to wake Izuku up because he can’t stand to look at Inko’s beaming face any longer.

Chapter Text

At the start of the next week, Shouta is walking Izuku home from school and preparing himself for how loud the kid’s going to be when he tells him about his plans to train him. He gave up on figuring out the gentlest way to break it to the kid yesterday, knowing damn well that Izuku’s going to lose his mind and shriek with joy no matter how Shouta words his offer. He knew that Deku had been an intense fanboy, but Deku was downright apathetic compared to Izuku’s fanaticism. 

The things kids clutch onto when the world is beating them down. 

They’re lucky that Izuku latched onto heroes rather than something weird like dolls or porn. 

Ick. 

His phone is once again buzzing away. He grabs it, denies the call, and shoves it back into his pocket. Izuku, with his hands hooked on the straps of his backpack, looks at his pocket intently. Shouta raises an eyebrow at him, but Izuku’s too busy staring at his pocket and furrowing his eyebrows together in concentration. 

Shouta says, “What do you think about - “ at the same time that Izuku finally blurts out, “Why don’t you ever answer your phone even though it rings all the time?” 

Well then.

After an awkward pause, Shouta coughs. “And here I thought I was being discreet.” 

“If someone’s bothering you Mom can help you get a new number, we did that after Dad left because he wouldn’t stop calling and Mom said that wasn’t okay and I had to memorize the new number which was hard but I bet you could memorize a new number easy Mr. ‘Zawa ‘cause you’re really really smart!”

Shouta considers addressing that extremely concerning statement for all of three seconds before deciding that’s a problem for another day. He says, “He’s bothering me, but it’s not the same situation. It’s a friend of mine who I don’t want to talk to right now.” 

Izuku frowns. “Why not? If he’s a friend wouldn’t you want to talk to him? I always want to talk to Kacchan ‘cause he’s my friend but he’s always busy so we don’t that often but you’re not busy when you’re with me - I won’t mind if you talk to him! Honest!” 

“It’s more complicated than that.” 

Izuku waits expectantly. 

Shouta sighs. “Hizashi - my friend - is dealing with a problem right now that makes him... Difficult.” 

“Difficult?” 

“Mean,” he simplifies. “It makes him very mean. I don’t want to talk to him until he stops being mean, and he won’t stop being mean until he deals with his problem.” 

Izuku’s frown deepens and creates creases in his tiny eyebrows. “Kacchan’s mean to me all the time but ‘cause he’s my friend it doesn’t matter that he’s mean. Is this guy really your friend?” 

Shouta is not paid enough, nor is he qualified enough, to deal with that level of fucked up. He says, “Okay, there’s a lot to unpack there, but let’s start with the most pressing item - you do know that it’s not okay that Bakugou is mean to you, right?” 

Izuku stares at him blankly. 

“Izuku. Bakugou using his quirk on you, yelling at you, harassing you - that’s not okay. It doesn’t matter if he’s your friend or not. No one should treat you like that. If someone’s mean to you, you don’t have to put up with it.” 

“Okay Mr. ‘Zawa,” he says agreeably. It’s clearly a placation, which would annoy Shouta more if it wasn’t coming from a seven-year-old who is actively deciding it’s perfectly fine to be taken advantage of and horrifically abused by anyone who says that they’re his friend. Instead, it leaves him feeling nauseous and extremely tired. “But with your friend, I guess you’re saying that he isn’t normally mean so you’re worried.” 

“‘Worried’ is a bit of a stretch.” 

“What’s the problem he’s having? Maybe we can help him so he can stop being mean and you can talk to him again!” 

“It’s complicated, kid. Don’t worry about it.” 

“But he’s your friend!” Izuku protests. “That means he’s important! If I can help - “ 

“You can’t,” he says ruthlessly. “We just have to wait for him to get better. That’s all.” 

“But isn’t it better to try? I mean - “ 

“Look,” Shouta says. “Here’s what we’re dealing with. You think it’s better to get involved with this crap?” 

He pulls out his phone, opens his voicemail, and puts it on speaker. Hizashi’s voice - a slurred, drunken mess that is uncomfortably familiar even when it’s been decades since he’s heard it - emerges. 

“ShOU I just think - I just think that it’s RIDICULOUS that you AREN’T TALKING TO ME. RIDICLOUS. Absolutely RIDICLOUS. I’m FUN and everyone likes me and no one likes you so why aren’t you answering me you’re such a fuckin’ - you’re a fuckin’ worst ever I don’ wan… You’re such an ASS and you wouldn’t even! You’re not shit, you’re NOT an’ it’s fuckin’ stupid why won’t you pick up your fuckin’ PHONE I JUST WANNA TALK YOU PRICK IT’S NOT LIKE YOU HAVE ANYONE ELSE YOU FUCKIN’ FUCK YOU JUST ALWAYS DO THIS LIKE I DON'T EVEN - “ 

That’s enough of that. He stops the recording and puts his phone back into his pocket, grateful that the one he picked was one of the milder calls. 

It’s familiar in the worst ways. For the better part of their twenties, he and Hizashi were at odds and barely able to tolerate each other for longer than ten minutes at a time. There were periods where they would be on good terms and have their normal friendship, but more often than not, Hizashi’s excessive partying and Shouta’s employment struggles had them butting heads. The drinking, in particular, had been rough for Shouta to get past when a drunk Hizashi became the same kind of asshole Shouta’s dad had been when he was growing up. 

When he first arrived in the past, one of the reasons he was able to pinpoint his age as “somewhere in his early twenties” was the fact that Hizashi was in his contacts list as “zashi-chan <3” - the name Hizashi had entered himself way back in high school, day one of their friendship. Shouta had hate-changed the contact to “Yamada” after their infamous Fight when they were twenty-five, which doubled as the catalyst to Hizashi’s backing away from pro-hero party life and finally getting sober. 

Their friendship is something that Shouta has always cherished in his own way. He’s not an affectionate guy, nor does he have any plans on ever being one, but Hizashi is his best friend. Nemuri is another best friend, obviously, but Hizashi was the first person who looked past Shouta’s dry and harsh demeanor and decided, “Yeah, let’s be friends.” That decision meant - means - more to Shouta than Hizashi will ever know. Even with decades of ups-and-downs in his memories, he cares about Hizashi in a way that he’s never felt about anyone else and he’d do just about anything for the moron. 

That doesn’t mean that Shouta has any patience to watch Hizashi self-destruct with booze and fame. He didn’t the first time around, and he doesn’t have any plans to be a part of that this time either. He’s a pathetic bastard, but there’s boundaries that Shouta set in his formative years that no one will be able to make him cross. 

On some level, he was always impressed that Hizashi managed to keep his ranking in the top fifties. He had some close calls - more than he would’ve if his brain wasn’t fermenting in clementine flavored Svedka - but he kept his stupid ass alive and never ranked lower than forty-five. While a lot of that is due to his popularity and his radio show keeping him afloat, just as much is due to him being a genuinely skilled hero with a winning personality and smile. What he could’ve done if he hadn’t spent his twenties trying to drown himself in his vices - The wasted potential made Shouta that much more frustrated when he’d see him acting stupid and getting dragged by tabloids for stumbling out of a club at four in the morning on a Wednesday. It makes him furious now, knowing how much Hizashi was held back by his shitty decisions even decades into the future. 

And somehow, irrationally, he’s even more incandescently pissed at Hizashi now that Izuku is looking at his cellphone with a strange, melancholy expression. His best friend is ruining his life and making Izuku pity him for his shit choices. Shouta knows that he’s a pathetic bastard, but Hizashi at this point in time is a lot worse. 

“It sounds like he misses you,” Izuku says quietly. 

Shouta scoffs. “If he missed me, he’d stop being a jerk.” 

“I think he misses you a lot and it’d mean a lot to him if you tried to help him. ‘Cause when you’re that mad, it’s only ‘cause you care.” He pauses, then adds, “Even if you can’t fix it, it helps knowing that someone wants to help. I know you and Mama can’t fix how everyone’s mean to me at school, but it’s nice knowing that you would if you could. ” 

Shouta’s glad they’re approaching the apartment now, because how is he supposed to respond to that? 

No, they can’t fix how the school as a whole treats Izuku. It burns, but there’s nothing Shouta can currently do as a new hero. The school thinks Izuku is quirkless and neither he nor Inko has enough money or influence to make them treat him half-decently. Cops are at best useless and at worst actively detrimental to any situation they’re brought into. Inko’s job means she can’t move them to another district, and that’s ignoring the fact that the chances of any school accepting a quirkless kid are extremely, pathetically low. 

Izuku can’t kick up a fuss or fight back, either, or else he’ll risk expulsion or at the very least a black mark on his record that will keep him from attending U.A. - actually, due to his status, any high school. It’s not like any of the teachers will stop to verify if he was the instigator or victim, after all. Once Shouta gets his teaching job back, there will be more leeway there since he’ll be able to vouch for him. Until then, Izuku has to keep his head down and play as nice as he can manage. 

Shouta and Inko had discussed this at length when fleshing out Izuku’s training plan. She had, with abnormally dry eyes, told Shouta that he has to make sure that Izuku won’t use what he’s teaching him against his bullies unless absolutely necessary. Shouta had automatically protested. Then, after Inko showed him the depressing statistics about quirkless employment, graduation, and suicide rates, he reluctantly agreed. 

It’s terrible to think about how Shouta never would’ve had Izuku as a student if he hadn’t held on until his quirk came in. It’s a thought that joined the pile of thoughts that already keep him up at night. 

Izuku is pretty much saying, “You can’t help me or Hizashi, but knowing that you care enough to try is more than enough for me so it’s probably the same for your blonde idiot,” and it’s galling to need a child to tell him that when Shouta knows damn well that Nemuri’s periodic texts and lunch dates were all that kept him sane in the years following his problem class’s graduation. 

He leads the way up the stairs and says, “You’re really good at making me realize I’m a terrible person. Thanks.” 

Izuku’s wails and denials trail after him, making Shouta smirk. “Let’s see what your mom’s planning for dinner. Maybe she’ll let us get some ice cream later if it’s still light out after.” 

“Mr. ‘Zawa you’re not terrible! You know I think you’re the coolest - !” 

“Even cooler than All Might?” 

“That’s not fair!“ 

“I see. Guess I’m getting ice cream alone then.” 

“Mr. ‘Zawa!” 

“You know,” Shouta starts, ushering Izuku in the door. “You and your mom, for some reason, are letting me hang around for the indefinite future. You can cut the ‘mister’ stuff. Just ‘Aizawa’ is fine.” 

They both kick off their shoes. Izuku says, “Mom says it’s rude not to use mister and missus with adults.” 

“Generally, you should use whatever their preference is. Most adults prefer when kids use honorifics because it’s polite. I already know you’re plenty polite and I prefer no honorifics. So it’s okay.” 

Izuku looks at him skeptically. “Okay Mr. ‘Zawa,” he says placatingly. “I’m gonna go make a card for your friend. Will you give it to him for me?” 

“A card?” 

“So he gets better soon! You said we can’t help and just have to wait for him to get better, and cards help. Mama said so. We sent one to Dad when he was sick last year.” 

Izuku runs off to his room before Shouta can continue the conversation. Shouta takes this opportunity to collapse on the couch, fling an arm over his eyes, and spend the time until dinner overthinking his options moving forward.

Chapter Text

Shouta isn’t thrilled to be walking into a shitty cafe at eight in the morning laden down with a care package the size of an overweight Rottweiler, but he’s not the kind of man to give up on his commitments. He might analyze a situation and ruminate for days, but once he’s made his decision he sticks to it. 

Even if he already wants to go back to bed. And his head is already aching from how loud this encounter is going to be. And he’d much rather be making Izuku run laps to hopefully exhaust the kid’s never-ending enthusiasm. And he had to skip his second cup of coffee with Inko to make it to the cafe in time. 

“He’s your friend,” Shouta mutters, mocking Izuku’s tiny voice. “He’ll like to know that you care. Give him this card for me, please? Even though I’m an annoying problem child who makes you feel bad for not being as emotionally intelligent as a traumatized seven year old - “ 

“Are you actually going in or are you just planning on blocking the entrance all day like a fucking idiot?” Some woman barks at him. She’s tapping her toes pointedly, arms crossed and a baleful glare leveraged at his face. 

Shouta, because he has better things to do than cater to this woman’s rage, opens the cafe’s door as slowly as physically possible. He stares her down, blank face a sharp contrast to her reddening one, and takes one step in. Then another. 

He inches his way into the cafe at a pace that could generously be called “slow.” He doesn’t break eye contact. 

“Are you fucking KIDDING me?! You - “ 

“Shouta! There you are.” A pale hand grabs his arm and pulls him in. Gentle, in contrast to his abrasive loudness. “Come on, I have a table for us already.” 

He’s already being pulled away before he can respond, probably to the joy of the irritating woman who needs more than meditation and a good lay to get that stick out of her ass. What a pain, having to deal with someone like that when his morning is already off to an annoying start. 

The blonde dragging him past hipsters and college kids - because of course somewhere “cool” is where Hizashi would make them meet - is dressed down for once. His hair is in a messy braid that doesn’t quite hide the fact that there’s some crud stuck in it. If Shouta had to guess, the consistency of the wet crud points to bile and the sparkly bits are probably confetti. He’s wearing a plain gray sweatshirt that almost covers his knees - something Present Mic would never be caught dead wearing in public - and his shoes are mismatched flip flops. 

Shouta is urged to sit down, care package placed at his feet, and between one moment and the next, Shouta sees Hizashi’s face for the first time in a decade. 

Clearly, the idiot hasn’t been sleeping. His eye bags are worse than Shouta’s, and Shouta was up until three last night fielding Izuku’s questions about how to throw a proper punch. His lips are chapped, his eyes are red, he’s breaking out near his chin the same way he always did during finals week stress, there’s smudges of some kind of makeup around his eyes and lips, and underneath all of it, Hizashi looks so damn happy to see him. 

He’s smiling. 

It’s been a long time since Shouta last cried, but he doesn’t think he could ever forget the way it sneaks up on him. His throat aches, his eyes prickle, and he hiccups - and it’s just like the day Deku died, where he suddenly can’t stop it from happening even as he knows it won’t fix anything. 

“Shouta? Shouta?! What’s wrong, oh my god are you dying? Am I dying? WHy are you cRying I don’t think I’ve ever seen you cry before holy shit what’s wrong - “ In a strange twist, Hizashi isn’t yelling. He’s whispering, voice getting quieter and quieter with every word. 

Shouta grunts and wetly says, “This is your fault, idiot.” 

“MY FAULT?” There’s the yelling. Shouta was almost worried there for a second. 

“You look terrible. I thought I was looking at a zombie. I don’t think anyone who could see your face right now would blame me for reacting like this.” The impact of his statement is compromised by the way he sniffles and hiccups in between sentences. Shouta is experiencing too many feelings to give a damn about that, though. 

“You’re so mean!” Hizashi wails, slumping in his seat. “We haven’t talked in months and you’re already being so mean to me!” 

“I’m not the one who walked in here with puke in their hair. You’re mean for making me look at that.” 

Hizashi’s face is blank for two seconds, before he turns bright red. One of his hands starts to reach for his hair, before stopping halfway through. He instead picks up the napkin on his side of the table and wipes at his face and hair in a futile attempt to clean up some of the mess. 

“H-heh, yeah, I guess - Uh, you know how Fridays are - Just a wild night. Didn’t realize how early we were getting together, and it’s not - “ 

“Look,” Shouta interrupts, wiping his eyes and sighing. It’s weird seeing Hizashi embarrassed. The man’s normally so carefree that this hesitant, ashamed version is strangely foreign. “You know how I feel about your partying. I’m not here to talk about that or lecture you. When you’re ready to get help, I’m here.” He stops, picks up a menu, and says, “Right now, though, we’re just getting coffee.” 

Hizashi doesn’t do a good job of hiding his shock. Shouta, because he’s not a total prick, pretends not to notice. 

“We’re not talking about your partying or about how I’m getting a caramel frappuccino. Deal?” 

Hizashi hoarsely says, “Oh come on, Shouta, how am I supposed to not say something about that? Mr. ‘I want my coffee as black as my soul’?” 

“Plain coffee’s cheaper. I finally have some extra money, so I’m getting the damn frappuccino.” 

He brightens up, sitting up straighter. “Did you finally sign with an agency?” 

“Not quite. I think I was adopted? Sort of?” Shouta mutters, flipping through the menu. “I’m staying with someone. So I’m not paying rent or anything right now since I’m babysitting her kid. Her name’s Inko, kid’s name is Izuku.”

“You got a SUGAR MAMA? I know we haven’t seen each other for awhile but HOW THE FUCK - “ 

“Ew, no. It’s not like that.” 

“It sure sounds like that!” 

They talk about a lot. 

Well, actually, in a weird twist of events - Shouta talks about a lot. Hizashi’s eyes don’t leave him once as Shouta tells him about Inko’s generosity and Izuku’s enthusiasm. He laughs when Shouta explains how Izuku started hyperventilating when Shouta told him he would train him to become a hero. He laughs harder when Shouta tells him about how Inko has limited him to two jelly pouches a day since Izuku has started to mimic him, and Izuku’s small enough without skipping meals. 

Hizashi seems not only content but downright thrilled to listen to Shouta ramble about the Midoriyas. He asks questions and encourages him to expand and explain further. The pro-hero star Present Mic is willingly stepping out of the spotlight for Shouta, of all people. 

If Shouta wasn’t already convinced that Hizashi was in a bad place, he sure as hell would know for sure at this point. 

Eventually, though, Shouta runs out of things to talk about. He’s had two frappuccinos, Hizashi’s had three cups of tea, and they split a plate of scones. Hizashi looks like a single good breeze would topple him, with how exhausted he looks, but he’s staring at Shouta and seems perfectly happy to sit there and smile at him for the foreseeable future. 

Shouta doesn’t get it. Last time, at this age, he and Hizashi couldn’t be in the same room without arguing. He was pretty sure Hizashi hated him, had hated that Shouta was a, “stuck up, pretentious bastard who thinks he’s too good for some fun,” had thought Shouta was holding him back and felt obligated to be his friend since no one else would be, had thought Shouta was someone to be pitied and looked down on - 

But how much of that surety had been tainted by Shouta’s own issues at the time? How much had been due to him being stuck in his own problems, constantly worried about where he’d sleep the next night, constantly running himself ragged while trying to prove himself as a legitimate hero? How much of their strife came down to Shouta not knowing how to say, “I’m not mad at you - I’m mad at our situations. I’m mad that you felt like booze was the answer, I’m mad that I’m too pathetic of a hero to save my best friend from himself, I’m mad that even as we’re talking I’m trying to remember if I have enough money for a cup of coffee or if I’ll have to patrol on an empty stomach again, and I’m so goddamn mad that you keep trying to act like everything is fine and we’re not falling apart.”

And, with a distance that only decades could provide, how much of his reticence towards friendship of any kind was Shouta punishing himself for Oboro’s death? How much was him fearing that the same would happen to Hizashi and he’d have to bury another friend? 

It all seems to have contributed to their problems more than a lot, seeing as they’re currently having a decent enough conversation and they’re nowhere near each other’s throats. Apparently it only took a couple decades of unprecedented traumatic experiences for Shouta to learn how to be a decent friend. 

In his mind, he’s almost a senior citizen. He doesn’t have the energy or patience to be prideful any more. He wants to change the future, of course, but he also wants to enjoy the time he has with the people he cares about. 

Even if it’s selfish and makes him feel guilty in his core. It doesn’t make him feel bad enough to walk away from the Midoriyas, which means it has nothing on how much he would never be able to turn Hizashi away. 

 

>

> > 

> > > 

> >

It’s well into the afternoon when Shouta decides that, as pleasant as their time together has been, he needs time to himself. He says, “I have to get going. I’ll see you at the same time next week.” 

Hizashi - blonde, exhausted, visibly hungover - beams. Sunny and absolutely delighted, he gives Shouta a double thumbs up and says, “Yep! I want to hear more about your little listener, and you better tell me how he does on that test of his, ‘kay?”

“Whatever.” He stands up and pushes the care package over to Hizashi’s side of the table with his foot. “That’s for you. From Inko. I told her you were fine, but she said if you’re doing half as fine as I was when she met me, then that’s not fine at all,” he recites dutifully. “Izuku made a card or something too. I dunno. I didn’t look.” 

“Oh wow. That’s - “ 

“I’ll see you next week.” Shouta turns and walks away, ignoring Hizashi’s cheerful well-wishes and goodbyes. 

That night, after a crappy patrol, Shouta drags himself back to the apartment. Izuku’s already asleep - as he should be, it’s past four in the fucking morning - and Inko is just waking up to start her day. As she groggily starts the coffee maker, Shouta collapses onto the couch and pulls up the latest voicemail from Hizashi. 

He’s drunk, obviously, but not as plastered as he normally would be. The voicemail is a lot of him gushing over how nice it was to see him, and how much he missed Shouta, and, “I can’t believe how nice the Midoriyas are, you deserve nice people and Missus Midoriya gave me? So many snacks? She’s so nice and the little listener’s card made me CRY okay I’m still about to cry - I can’t WAIT for next week I miss you already thank you Shouta I think you’re the absolute BEST.” 

And, well. 

It’s a step up from getting screamed at. It’s better than last time. 

He listens to it three more times, trying to understand how he could’ve changed so much in not much time at all. Without even really trying. 

Shouta wonders what’ll happen when he starts to put real effort in. 
Chapter 7: bleeding heart
Summary:

    The world isn't divided into heroes and villains, even if that'd make Shouta's life a lot easier.

Notes:

    thank u to the commenters that wished me a happy birthday, that was legit so sweet ;__; <3

    and thank u to everyone for reading and enjoying!!! last chapter was a really fun one for me and I really enjoyed bringing hizashi into the fold, so i'm glad it went over well with everyone <3 hopefully this one is received as well - it's a shorter one, and this is a chapter that probably doesn't seem like a huge deal at first glance, but it's a turning point for one of the plotlines i have planned even if aizawa won't see that anytime soon... insert not-so-subtle hint/foreshadowing here for the afo arc i have planned~

    thank you all again, and hope those of you in the same time zone as me are surviving the really crappy heat we've been getting the past few weeks. (i hate hot weather!!! so much!!!!!!!!)

Chapter Text

“I thought you would dodge!” Izuku shrieks, running forward. “Mr. ‘Zawa are you okay I’m so sorry oh no oh NO YOU’RE BLEEDING - “ 

“It’s fine - kid, back off. It’s fine. I’ve been hit harder by kittens.” 

“YOU’RE BLEEDING!” 

“It’s fine.” 

Unsurprisingly, Izuku bursts into tears. Shouta, nose bleeding and head ringing, can’t bring himself to hide the fond grin on his face. 

Who would’ve thought that a few months into living with the Midoriyas, he’d find the copious number of tears endearing rather than annoying? 

He reaches out and ruffles the kid’s hair, waits until his sobs have died down to some pathetic sniffles, then says, “That’s how much force you should be putting into the kick. You did good. Let’s do it again.” 

“W-what if I hurt you?” 

“That’s the point of this. You hurt people to distract them, and from there you either incapacitate them or get away from them. Right now, you’re tiny, so you’ll be aiming to get away from anyone who attacks you. When you’re older, I’ll show you how to incapacitate. Okay?” 

Izuku nods very seriously, eyes already dry. As quick as he is to cry, he’s just as quick to pull himself together. Shouta is painfully fond of this strong kid, who feels things so strongly and works so hard even when everyone is trying to tear him down. 

He swipes at the blood trickling out of his nose and says, “Okay. We’ll work on this for a little bit longer, then we’ll start heading home. Inko wants us to pick up takeout.” 

“Can we get okonomiyaki?” 

“Maybe. Show me you can kick that hard again and I’ll consider it.” 

Izuku grins at him. 

They, obviously, get okonomiyaki for dinner. Izuku insists on carrying it himself - “It’s training! If I can’t carry this, what kind of hero would I be?” and between that and his inability to go anywhere without rambling on and on about whatever quirk caught his eye that day, Shouta’s busy keeping him from running into traffic or a telephone pole. 

“Do you have a favorite animal, Mr. ‘Zawa?” 

“Cats. Rabbits are alright. I like cats a lot though.” 

“Cats are great! Did you know that they domesticated themselves? Humans domesticated dogs ‘cause of hunting and stuff like that where dogs would help them, but humans never did that with cats! They just became friends with humans ‘cause they wanted to be. It’s also why there’s a bunch of different, specific dog breeds but cats are more muddled, ‘cause dogs were picked for being good hunters or trackers or whatever else people wanted them for, but cats weren’t ever selected like that. And cats only meow ‘cause they want to talk to us! “ 

“Makes sense. Cats are smart.” 

“They are!” 

“Did you know that when cats blink really slow, that’s their version of a smile?” 

Izuku’s eyes go starry. He’s always unreasonably impressed any time Shouta tells him something that he doesn’t already know, even if it’s extremely basic information. “Really?” 

“Mmhm. Like this.” Shouta waits until Izuku’s looking at him, then he very slowly and carefully blinks. “It means they trust you and care. Sort of. I think. I’m not a cat, so I guess I wouldn’t know for sure.” 

Izuku says, “You’re so smart, Mr. ‘Zawa. I’m really glad you live with me and Mom now.” 

“I told you ages ago that you can drop the ‘mister’, didn’t I?” 

“But - !” 

Their conversation is cut off by the loud, unmistakable noise of someone deciding to cause some property damage. The screeching of tires, people screaming in fear, and some lunatic shouting in rage - it’s basically the soundtrack for Shouta’s entire life. 

Times like these, Shouta wonders how non-heroes really react to situations like this. He knows what civilians look like when these things happen - panicking, crying, running around, and generally being unhelpful to the situation - but he wonders what a normal civilian thinks of when a car gets flung in their direction. He’s been trained for longer than he can remember to keep calm and assess the situation, and he doesn’t remember what it’s like to be genuinely worried about the morons that throw their weight and quirks around. Is their panic exacerbated by the fact that they don’t know how much worse it could be? 

Would they panic the same if Shigaraki was here? 

If Izuku wasn’t seven, he might’ve asked him. He might’ve tried to explain a nightmare scenario where a godlike man destroys everything in his path and steals quirks like they’re candy in the hands of children, where standing near him was enough to make most pros tremble. To an untrained civilian who can’t protect themselves against a mediocre strength enhancing quirk, is there that much of a difference between that and Shigaraki’s power? Either could kill them just as easily. Deku would appreciate the thought exercise, and Izuku’s sharp as a tack. While he wouldn’t be able to dig in the way Deku could, Shouta finds himself curious what this young version of his ally would have to say about the matter. 

Izuku, though, is seven. 

He’s seven, visibly afraid, and Shouta is responsible for him. 

Izuku, to his credit, immediately clutches onto Shouta’s hand. It’s a better response than Shouta could’ve hoped for when a child is faced with panicked civilians and a loud disturbance. Him freezing up or running away (who’s he kidding - his problem child would run towards danger, not away) would’ve been a pain. 

Not that there’s much danger, really. From what Shouta can see, the person causing mayhem is more brawn than brains. His path of destruction is haphazard and doesn’t seem to have a goal in mind. 

Bulging muscles, taller than a house, and stepping on anything he wants as he runs away from the cops - it looks like a typical situation that didn’t have to be as messy as it’s ended up being. A guy with a large, intimidating mutation quirk got startled and started wrecking havoc. Likely, the poor bastard was shoplifting or smoking something he shouldn’t, the cops spooked him, and he panicked. In the age of quirks, this is much more detrimental of an offense than it needs to be - especially when the panicking person is large and powerful, and cops aren’t known for their stellar de-escalation skills. 

There are issues in the hero community and how much power heroes are given, but at least they’re public figures that will be raked over the coals if they step out of line. Daylight heroes are obnoxious and flashy, but for their image, they have to at the absolute minimum make a token attempt at talking the instigator down. Cops, on the other hand, get away with a lot more brutality and prejudice. They instigate more crises than they solve. Shouta isn’t a fan of either, but he would prefer to work with other heroes than the police any day of the week. 

This disconnect between the two intertwined entities can, and in Shouta’s case does, lead to tension between heroes and the police. The more popular heroes get fawned over and sucked up to, the less popular ones get disrespected and brushed off as dumb celebrities, and the unknown ones (like Shouta) are looked at as outsiders. Underground heroes are treated the same as federal agents or cops from other jurisdictions - unwanted, irritating, and a danger to the way they run their shop. 

All of this is to say: Shouta has very little respect for most cops. He’s had too many bad experiences with them not trusting his judgment and doing their damnedest to make his already difficult job more of a pain. This isn’t getting into the fact that he doesn’t trust them to do their jobs correctly if he isn’t breathing over their shoulders. 

As Shouta ushers Izuku away from the chase that’s rapidly getting closer, he tries not to look at the obvious panic on the poor guy’s face. If he was more well-established, if he wasn’t with Izuku, if his quirk worked on mutations - he might have intervened. 

Here, though, there’s little he can do. 

“The cops have it handled. Let’s head home.” He tugs Izuku away and in the opposite direction. “We’re alright.” 

“I don’t understand,” Izuku says. His voice is shaking a little, but his grip on Shouta’s hand is firm without any sense of desperation or fear. 

“Hm?” 

“The man running. I don’t understand. He’s a villain?” Izuku shakes his head. “He looks really afraid.” 

Shouta’s eyes close. He says, without opening them, “The world isn’t divided into heroes and villains. Not the way those shows you like watching try to say. Sometimes, someone causing a problem is just a person in a bad position. Just because someone is getting arrested doesn’t mean they’re a villain, or even a bad person.” 

When he opens his eyes, Izuku’s looking up at him with a worried frown. “Is he going to be okay?” 

“Sure. Probably.” 

“Probably?” 

Shouta says, “He’s causing a lot of damage. Cops are trained to end situations like this as quickly as possible. Even if that means hurting him.” 

Izuku’s frown deepens. “That’s not right.” 

Shouta doesn’t agree or disagree. This is a conversation that would be more at home in a college discussion course than on a walk home with a child. There’s too much nuance for a child to understand. 

When Shouta doesn’t answer, Izuku says persistently, “Mr. ‘Zawa, the whole point of heroes and police officers and stuff is to help people. They’re not helping that man if they keep scaring him.” 

He doesn’t say anything. 

Again, there’s a lot of nuance that a kid can’t get. Is it really the cops’ job to help people, or is it to keep the peace as a whole? Is it really a hero’s job to help individuals, or are they meant to act as symbols for the general populace to put their faith in? 

“Mr. ‘Zawa?” 

Shouta sighs.

Loud, long, and emphatically, he sighs. Rolls his neck, adjusts his capture weapon, and finally kneels down next to Izuku. 

“Can I trust you to stay here and not wander off?” 

Izuku levels him with a suspicious look, as if Shouta would just abandon him for no good reason. To whoever put that look on his face, Shouta would like to argue there’s no good reason to abandon this kid (or any kid, for that matter). He asks, with that same level of suspicion, “Why?” 

“As is becoming startlingly frequent, a child is acting as my conscience. I’m going to go check on that man. As long as you agree to stay here and scream if anyone tries to touch you. Got me?” 

Izuku nods hard enough that his hair flops into his eyes. “Yessir!” 

“I mean it. Don’t talk to strangers. Stand here, stay away from the fight, and wait for me to finish up.” 

He nods again. “Yes Mr. ‘Zawa!” 

Damn this kid. Damn Shouta’s bleeding fucking heart. 
Chapter 8: compared to izuku's dad, aizawa is a great role model (even if he gets injured semi-frequently)
Summary:

    Hisashi Midoriya (?) is discussed.

Notes:

    woo~ this chapter is a decent amount of backstory for inko!!! i love her. this chapter's a little heavy and discusses an off-screen abusive relationship - be warned if that's a trigger for you!! if you want to skip it, stop reading when inko goes into "storyteller" mode. ("When they’re both settled, she takes a deep breath and begins.") there's nothing explicit, but inko describes an old relationship that was Not Good

    thank you all for reading and for the kind comments!!! you've made writing this a really enjoyable and rewarding process, and i hope i can continue to keep your attention <3 happy friday!

Chapter Text

Inko is less than pleased to see Shouta limping home. Even Izuku’s starry-eyed wonder and declarations of, “Mr. ‘Zawa is the BEST hero ever and he’s my favorite he’s so NICE Mama even the police man agreed with me when I said so - “ do little to appease her visible irritation. 

Shouta doesn’t remember a police officer talking to Izuku, but he also took a pretty hard hit to his head so it’s entirely possible he just doesn’t remember. Nice of him to agree with Izuku, though. 

Inko not-so-gently shoves Shouta into her recliner and says, “Izuku, can you get the first-aid kit for me? It should be under the bathroom sink.” 

Izuku chirps, “‘Kay!” and runs off. 

Inko stares down at Shouta, who blinks placidly. 

“You can’t keep doing this,” she says firmly. “If not for your own health, then for Izuku.” 

Shouta blinks again. 

“Injuring yourself. Getting hurt. Throwing yourself into danger like your life doesn’t matter.” She waves a hand, lips curling into a scowl that looks out of place on her face. “It’s not acceptable.” 

“What?” 

Shouta’s a hero. Heroes get injured sometimes. It’s part of the job. He’s actually pretty good about not getting himself too hurt in comparison to other pros - a bruise here or there, grazes from knives, maybe a dislocated shoulder or two. 

On top of that, Shouta’s a teacher. He knows the importance of prioritizing a hero’s physical and mental health due to how many morons he’s had to beat the lesson into. Deku was one of many who, due to being born without any sense of concern for himself, had to learn self-preservation in Shouta’s classroom. Shouta’s never been one to go into situations he knows he can’t win - unless his students or children were at risk, but that’s understandable. It’s a teacher’s responsibility to protect their charges. 

“You keep coming back from your patrols beat to Hell! And now you’re coming back from being with Izuku beat even worse than usual!” her voice is quiet, and she keeps looking towards the doorway waiting for Izuku to return. “You can’t keep doing that. You have to start worrying about your own safety, Shouta.” 

“I’m not a reckless idiot,” he says bluntly. “I’m a hero. Sometimes we get bruised. It’s not a big deal.” 

“You came home last week with a sprained wrist. The week before that, a concussion and dislocated shoulder. You’re limping now, obviously, but you haven’t been able to put all of your weight on your left foot for at least a month. You passed out the other day when you came home - “ 

“That was just dehydration,” Shouta protests mildly. Part of him is wondering if her archive of his injuries is right - he doesn’t remember half of them. 

His patrols and assignments have been going smoother than they used to, given the experience he’s accumulated since the last time around. With those going easily enough, his free time can be used for research and information gathering, trying to find out if the League is even around yet or not. There’s whispers of “Sensei” and his unhinged pet child that destroys anything it touches, but nothing concrete yet that Shouta can act on. 

When he hits dead-ends on the League, he shifts to tracking down those involved with Overhaul’s operation. Plenty of them were yakuza or people already involved in stupid illegal crap, so it’s easy enough to get them behind bars. The other, more slippery ones, he keeps an eye on them to make sure he’ll be able to handle them when they inevitably make a mistake and implicate themselves.

Kai Chisaki won’t ever lay a hand on Eri if Shouta has anything to say about it. 

(He has a lot of emotions about the fact that, if he does his job well, he might never meet Eri. The girl he more or less raised as his own won’t need him, she won’t put her tiny hand in his own when they cross the street, she won’t sit with him on the couch watching cartoons at three in the morning because neither of them can sleep - 

But she’ll be able to smile naturally, as opposed to having to re-learn a basic concept like happiness. She’ll be able to learn how to use her quirk without fearing it so intensely. She’ll be free in a way that she never was the first time around. 

And, most of all, Eri will live. 

In the end, Shouta’s own feelings about the situation don’t matter. Eri will live and have a chance at a normal childhood, and Shouta will ensure that Kai Chisaki rots in Hell long before he can lay a hand on her.) 

With how much he has on his plate, it shouldn’t surprise Shouta that he didn’t notice a number of his injuries - or the fact that he was receiving them in the first place. He’s still weirdly startled that Inko had noticed when he hadn’t, though. 

“Shouta,” Inko says, her face strangely pained. “Passing out isn’t ‘just’ anything. You need to take care of yourself. Again, if not for you, then for Izuku.” At Shouta’s questioning look, she sighs and runs a hand through her hair. “He idolizes you, Shouta. Anything you do, he’s going to imitate. It’s already hard enough when he sees heroes getting injured on TV and thinks that’s comparable to him getting injured at school - I can’t imagine how he’ll start justifying things to himself if he has a first hand example of someone being careless in front of him. He tries so hard to be tough, and if you’re brushing off injuries like this...” 

Oh. 

“I understand,” Shouta says quietly. “I apologize. I’m unused to someone looking to me as a role model.” 

“Just promise me that you’ll be more careful,” she pleads. “I know that sometimes you’re going to get hurt, but the stuff you can stop - Please.” 

“Yes. I’ll do what I can, Inko.” 

In an exhaled breath, all tension leaves her body. 

Just like that, he’s been forgiven. Unlike Recovery Girl, who grumbles and complains at him even when he is genuinely remorseful, Inko smiles at him, as warm as ever, and says, “That’s all I want. And Izuku, you can stop pretending that you weren’t trying to eavesdrop!” 

A muffled, “Eep!” comes from the hallway. Her and Shouta share a wry grin. 

“Come on, let’s get Shouta patched up and then we can finally eat. What did you two work on today while training?” 

The okonomiyaki went cold ages ago, but it’s easy enough to heat the food up on the stove and settle in for the meal. Izuku’s clearly exhausted, seeing as his motor mouth is completely focused on food for once. His eyes are drooping and he keeps falling forward before jerking back up, forcing himself to stay awake. 

Shouta isn’t far behind. He’s not particularly hungry and would rather be catching up on sleep, but he skipped breakfast and Inko’ll be pissed if he skips two meals. He forces himself to finish what’s on his plate and drinks a full cup of water at Inko’s pointed look. 

Inko finishes up her own food, then pokes Izuku’s forehead. He blearily looks up at her and says, “Huh?” 

“Are you finished packing? We’ll be moving over to the new apartment tomorrow. Mrs. Watanabe has a new tenant who’ll be moving here for the next rent cycle, so we need to have everything out as soon as possible.” 

“Mmhm. Just my bathroom stuff is left since I haven’t showered yet.” 

“You want to do that before you pass out?” Shouta asks dryly. “You’re dead on your feet.” 

“Today was long!” he whines, scrubbing at his eyes. “And I still have to write down your fight in my notebook! And everything you taught me today!” 

“You need to go to bed so you don’t pass out when we start moving tomorrow.” 

“He’s right baby,” Inko agrees, ruffling his hair lightly. “You can write everything down tomorrow. Okay?” 

Clearly, Izuku isn’t happy with that, but he sighs dramatically and nods. His feet drag as he disappears into the bathroom. Even now that they’ve been training for a few months, the sight of an exhausted problem child is strange for Shouta to see. He’s normally so upbeat and energetic, talking a mile a minute and fidgeting whenever he can’t talk. 

After a full day of school followed by training, all of that energy seems to have been sapped out of him. Include a surprise altercation with a panicked shoplifter (as Shouta had predicted, of course) and the cops - it’s no wonder the kid’s ready to collapse. 

Shouta kind of wants to collapse too. If he didn’t need to talk to Inko, he’d go to bed even though it’s barely past eight. 

The two of them clean up the table and head into the kitchen to run through the normal nighttime chores - throwing out the takeout containers, wiping the counters down, checking the fridge and cupboards for anything they’ll need to pick up the next day, checking through the mail for any bills or notices they need to handle. It’s one of many domestic rituals that still feels foreign for him to participate in. 

Once they’ve completed everything, Shouta doesn’t let himself procrastinate any longer than he already has. He says, “I’ve been trying to find out a delicate way to ask this for awhile now, but you know I’m pretty bad at being delicate. So I’m just going to ask and you can punch me if you want.” 

Inko raises an eyebrow. She wipes her hands on the dish towel and tosses it over her shoulder before leaning against the counter and waiting expectantly. “Okay…?” 

“What’s the situation with Izuku’s father?” Inko’s startled intake of breath is more of a hiss than anything else. Shouta pushes through anyway. “He’s made a few comments about him that I’m concerned about. You don’t have to go into detail if you don’t want to, but I should probably at least know who he is and if he’s allowed to see Izuku or not.” 

“He’s not,” Inko says quickly. “Or, at least, not alone.” 

“Can I know why?” 

Inko Midoriya is a kind, gentle woman. She has a spine of steel, but it’s surrounded by softness. It’s something Shouta admires about her - the ability to be so unwavering in her convictions but still soft and optimistic and hopeful in a way that Shouta’s never been able to be. She’s a chubby, hard-working mother who keeps them afloat while still loving her child more than anything else. 

There are times where that softness disappears, though, to be replaced by a haunted demeanor. Her shoulders tense and she becomes a wary, defensive rock that won’t be swayed by anything short of a hurricane. It’s something that tells Shouta that she’s lived through more than he would’ve expected given her general sensitivity. 

The way she hunches over and tries to make herself look smaller tells Shouta that Izuku’s father played some role in making her that way. 

“Can you promise me that you won’t judge me too harshly?” she asks softly. “This isn’t something I’m proud of. My relationship with Hisashi is something that, if I hadn’t gotten Izuku from it, I would regret the most in my life.” 

“Of course I won’t. What room do I have to judge you?” Shouta waves at himself. “I’m a grown man who is relying on you to keep a roof over my head. I spend more time messing around with a seven-year-old than around people my age.” 

She gives him a weak smile. “Well. That’s all fairly harmless, though.” 

“And Hisashi isn’t?” 

The smile drops immediately. 

“Hisashi - it’s complicated. He’s dangerous, but not - I mean, it’s.” She sighs heavily and takes a seat at the dining room table, motioning for Shouta to follow. He takes the seat next to her, rather than across from her. Something in him says she’ll appreciate the comfort of his closeness, though it feels arrogant to assume that. 

When they’re both settled, she takes a deep breath and begins. 

“We weren’t married. I told people that we were so Izuku wouldn’t have to deal with the stigma that comes with a single, unmarried mom, but. We weren’t. It’s a small comfort. He’s not even listed on Izuku’s birth certificate - Izuku has no legal ties to Hisashi.” She covers her eyes with a hand and visibly bites back a sob. “Thank God for that. I don’t know if he wanted it that way for Izuku’s safety or his own, but thank God there’s no paper trail to link him to us. I don’t know what that would’ve done for Izuku, growing up with whatever Hisashi was involved in looming overhead. 

“He. I mean, we barely had a relationship. It was mostly sex. I didn’t know much about him. It was something comfortable - casual. I didn’t want a relationship while I was in school, and he said he was too busy with work for anything traditional. Our chemistry was purely physical.” 

Looking at soft, sweet Inko - that’s really hard for Shouta to wrap his head around. She seems like the kind of woman who would want roses and chocolates, midnight walks on the beach - not some sort of fuck-buddy relationship. 

He’s not judging, but he’ll admit he’s surprised. It had never occurred to him that Izuku, beacon of hope and sunshine and affection, was a byproduct of anything other than two young adults deliriously in love. 

“So, when I got pregnant, I didn’t really expect much. I told him because I thought it was only fair, but I also told him that I didn’t expect - or even want, really - him to be involved.” She presses a hand against her stomach and gives a strange smile. “He was absolutely delighted. Like I’d never seen before. I knew he enjoyed our time together since he never suggested we stop seeing each other, but I wasn’t expecting the way he responded. He dragged me to a doctor to get a more conclusive test than a home one, and when that came back positive too, he was over the moon. 

“Suddenly, I was being smothered in affection and items and money. Anything I needed or wanted was provided for. He moved me out of my crappy college apartment into a house. He didn’t stay with me or anything, so it wasn’t his. He just. Got me a house. And everything I wanted. The best and most discreet doctors there were. Clothes, jewelry, baby clothes, baby toys - I’m pretty sure he bribed one of my professors to give me extensions when I needed them.” 

“That’s. Weird.” 

Inko laughs. “I know. It was bizarre. But I was young and pregnant and as much as I wanted Izuku, I was scared. And there was something comforting about having someone take care of things like that for me. Knowing that I could study without worrying about money is probably the only reason I was able to graduate.” She makes a face and says, “God, it sounds like I’m talking about a parent rather than an ex. That’s pretty much how he started treating me - like I was a precious child that he had to protect.” 

“Ick.” 

“If it makes you feel any better, Izuku’s conception was the last time we had sex.” 

“That is really weird for me to think about and I’d like it if you stopped.” 

She smirks, just a little. “If people looked at the two of us, they’d think I was the prude and I’d have fun knowing they’re wrong.” 

“Please.” 

She laughs again. “You’re very cute sometimes, Shouta.” 

“Inko.” 

Her mirth leaves as quickly as it appeared. “But, anyway - I’m not proud that I accepted all of this, even though Hisashi was clearly involved with… things. A normal businessman can’t afford everything he was giving me. A normal businessman can’t be available at any hour of the day if I called and said I needed something. There was obviously something going on behind the scenes, but I just.” She shrugs helplessly. “I didn’t want to know. So I didn’t ask or think about it much. I just accepted the situation I was in, and I prepared for Izuku. 

“When he was born, Hisashi didn’t stop smiling. He didn’t leave Izuku’s side for ages. And, for a little while, we were okay. An odd family, but things were fine. Hisashi and I co-parented, to some extent, with Hisashi normally letting my desires take precedent. He was happy to spoil Izuku and teach him, leaving me to set the daily schedule and decide on how to discipline when necessary. 

“Something changed once Izuku started walking.” She shudders. “I don’t know what. I never really knew Hisashi - he was so secretive. I knew he was involved in something illegal - I assumed he was, at least. I didn’t even know for sure what his last name was. He just - It was like once Izuku was mobile, Hisashi suddenly felt insecure. Maybe there was something else going on, but that’s the only connection I ever figured out. Izuku started walking, and Hisashi became strange. He hated if I left the house with Izuku - even taking him to the park was a problem. He’d get so mad - “ her voice breaks. 

“You don’t have to - “ 

“Shut up or I won’t ever finish this,” she says quickly. “You should know - I want you to know. It’s just. Hard. Okay?” 

Shouta nods. 

“So. It started getting scary. He’d have coworkers - he called them coworkers, but I don’t know who they were and I don’t know where they came from - stay with us when he had to be anywhere. He made it harder and harder for me to leave the house by taking my keys or breaking the car. When I couldn’t get a job because he kept sabotaging all of my interviews, I confronted him about it. He said that it’s his job to protect his family and he can’t do that if he doesn’t know where we are. 

“I told him that if he kept smothering me and Izuku, that I’d take him and run.” She shuts her eyes tightly. “He. Didn’t like that. He hit me. And Izuku was - what, three? Three or four. Before we found out that Izuku was quirkless and not just a late bloomer. But Izuku’s always been so smart, even that young, so he knew that something was wrong. He screamed and had a tantrum at Hisashi when I started crying and then… Then Hisashi hit him too.” 

“Inko - “ 

“And the sick thing is - I’m almost glad that he hit Izuku. Because when Izuku stopped crying and held his little face in his hand, shocked that his beloved Papa would do that, Hisashi looked absolutely horrified. Hitting me - if he had just hit me, we might still be there. He cared for his child’s mother , not for me. But Izuku? His precious son?” She shakes her head and sighs. “That - he couldn’t handle that. He disappeared. The next day, there were moving trucks that took us to another house. 

“He called us a week later and apologized. Said that he clearly was not fit to be a parent, but he would do whatever he could to ensure we lived a comfortable, safe life. I - Shouta, I was afraid. So I said, ‘It’s okay, it’s fine. Thank you.’” She presses a hand against her stomach and laughs. “I thanked him. For the pretty cage he was keeping us in.” 

“What else could you do?” 

She shrugs helplessly. “I don’t know. But, from there, he’d call every week to talk to Izuku. They’d talk for hours if they could. He’d send money and things, but we never saw him in person or even in a video call again. 

“I saved up the money that he would send, and once I got a job, I used that money to move us here. He upped his calls to twice a week once we moved but he didn’t do anything about us leaving. The house had been torn down, last I checked. 

“When Izuku turned six, he stopped calling for about six months. And then suddenly he was calling almost daily. I don’t know why. He was constantly asking about why Izuku liked heroes so much, trying to convince him that heroes are a scam. He kept trying to tell a child that he can’t trust heroes, that they’re all trash and - well, a lot more. Izuku was getting upset, and I asked him to stop. He said no and went on a fanatical rant that I still don’t know what to make of. 

“So I changed our number. He found it - which again leads me to believe that he’s involved in something not-so-great  - but he backed off, finally. I guess it was enough of a message that if he pushed too far, I’d make sure Izuku wouldn’t talk to him. Now he only calls on holidays.” 

Inko’s breathing is somewhat ragged as her story ends. Her eyes are teary. 

Shouta, as an underground hero, has seen his fair share of domestic abuse cases. He’s seen and heard of some horrific things, and while Inko’s is far from the worst situation he’s heard of - it horrifies him in a way that he can’t put into words just yet. It sounds like a terrible psychological horror, to be trapped and then released on one man’s whims. To not know anything about a captor that was, on the surface, taking such loving care of his family. To know that the threat of violence was looming and only receive glimpses of it, in strained moments. To never know how powerful this man was and if that power could be used to track them down no matter what she did. 

“This is why you were quick to let me stay,” Shouta says quietly. “You said that you felt safer knowing that a hero was staying with you.” 

“I do feel safer,” she admits. “I let you stay because you needed it and because I had a feeling you’d be good for us, but. I told you it was selfish. Having you here, for if Hisashi ever decided to come back and take Izuku - that’s my biggest fear. He’s generally benign and clearly would never hurt him, but I’m so afraid that one day I’ll wake up and Izuku will be gone. Or we’ll both be trapped again.” 

“You won’t be,” Shouta says firmly. “Like I’d let some creep bother you or Izuku. I won’t let that happen.” 

Inko finally fully breaks into sobs. Her shoulders tremble and she cries, saying, “I-I know, I know. You’re so. You’re s-so good, Shouta, thank you. Thank you, thank - “ 

“Stop that,” he scolds. He steps forward and does his best to hug her. He’s never been great at it, but she melts into his arms and buries her head into his shoulder. “Come on. You’re the one who said we’re family. I’d be a pretty piss poor hero if I let some cruddy mobster harm my precious people.” 

Inko cries harder and clutches at him. Shouta settles in for a long round of soothing - a skill he’s had to pick up since joining the Midoriya brood.

    Moving is stressful.

Notes:

    all of you ;__; ngl i was chomping at the bit for the lowkey dad-for-one reveal and i'm glad that you guys didn't seem to mind the way in which i did it. this story's going to have plenty more moments like that - where we know what's going on, but aizawa doesn't - and this was the first Big One that popped up, so i was kinda nervous about how it'd come across. obviously my tags kinda gave it away, but it seemed like it was obvious enough for you guys to pick up on while still being understandable why aizawa didn't pick up on it - which i am *extremely* grateful for!!!!

    thank you guys for reading <3 and while i don't have the emotional capacity to respond to comments individually, i do want you to know that i read all of them and cherish them, and when i see recurring names in my inbox it makes my entire *week* <3 i appreciate your enthusiasm so much!!!! i really hope i can keep making this something worthwhile for you all to enjoy.

    for this chapter, a small trigger warning - tw: for a panic attack. it's not described super in depth and we're mostly looking at the "let's comfort them!!!" part of a panic attack, but if you would like to skip it, stop reading at "He can see that they are" and you can pick up again at "That last one is easily fixed by gulping down the water in hand."

Chapter Text

Moving is a pain. Shouta had no idea how annoying it would be to move boxes from one end of the building’s hallway over to the other side. 

Izuku insists on moving his things himself, which would be cute if he wasn’t constantly in the way. He can’t lift any of the boxes he packed, so he pushes them across the floor slowly. They’re almost as big as him and he has to use his entire body to move the damn things. When Shouta finishes moving everything except Izuku’s crap, the kid’s just over halfway through. 

“Why don’t you help your mom unpack?” Shouta asks desperately. “I can get the rest. You can start hanging up your five hundred posters and getting your room sorted out.” 

“I have to get strong!” Izuku insists. His face is red as he struggles to push a box full of his clothes. “It’s training!” 

“You’re seven and there’s limits to what your tiny child body can do. You’re causing me physical pain to watch you struggle with this.” 

“Mr. ‘Zawa, I can do it!” 

This kid. 

Shouta does his best to step delicately over him and not crush any small fingers or toes. Inko just laughs at him from their new living room where she’s rearranging the furniture. He doesn’t think the way the couch is positioned is that big of a deal, but Inko has already moved and twisted and moved the damn thing over and over, clearly unable to decide what the perfect arrangement is, and Shouta doesn’t need to get involved with whatever neuroticism is making her hyperfocus on the matter. 

The kitchen is mostly sorted out since each apartment comes with most of the same appliances. Inko’s room - a fairly spartan area, with little more than a bed, nightstand, and picture of her and Izuku - took all of twenty minutes to get sorted. Shouta dropped his sleeping bag, duffel of clothes, and small shopping bag of things he’s accumulated since living with the Midoriyas into the room Inko told him was his. 

Izuku’s room is the only one that is empty save for boxes. 

“Izuku, you’re being illogical. Just let me help.” 

“I can do it!” he insists again. “Mom, tell Mr. ‘Zawa I can do it!” 

Inko looks up from where she’s pushing the couch, pushes hair out of her face, and grins at Shouta. “He can do it, Shouta. Leave him be. If you want something to do, you can head to the grocery store and pick up what we’ll need for the week.” 

Shouta eyes Izuku whose trajectory is about to send him and his box straight into the wall. Inko shrugs, a “What can ya do? Kids, amiright?” expression on her face. He sighs. 

“What am I getting?” 

And so, armed with a list of kitchen essentials and a handful of cash, he heads to the local store. 

It’s a bit of a walk, which is probably why Inko sent him. She’s scarily good at recognizing when Shouta’s overwhelmed by human interaction, considering her quirk isn’t an empathic one. It’ll likely be easier now that he has his own room to retreat to when the people around him aren’t perfectly acquiescing to or responding in the way he thinks they should be. 

Until the move is finished, though, a walk and an easy errand are a good enough way for him to get some space. 

Times like these, he wonders if there’s more he could be doing. If he was really the best choice for trying to save the entire goddamn world from someone who makes All Might look like an injured puppy. Here he is, deciding between soft and extra soft toilet paper, when, for all he knows, Shigaraki is already on his way to becoming the evil overlord he’ll be if Shouta can’t stop him. 

Not that there was much of a choice left towards the end, but Shouta would rather not think about why he, of all people, ended up here. If he had a choice in the matter, he would’ve sent Hizashi or Deku or - even though it makes him want to grind his teeth and punch a wall to rely on the buffoon - All Might, all of whom had a lot more influence than he ever did. 

His job would be a lot easier if he was half as popular as All Might. He’d have access to a lot more information, a lot more resources, and a lot more “no I don’t have to explain myself, I’m a big tough hero who always does what’s best, just trust me” to throw around.

That’s never been his style, though, and he wouldn’t succeed as a spotlight hero even if he tried. He doesn't have the temperament. 

Which is why literally anyone other than him should be here instead. 

“But no,” he grumbles to himself, grabbing a box of the gummies he and Izuku like to share when they’re working on his homework. “Everyone had to go and get themselves killed like fucking morons and leave me to clean up the mess. Like fucking always.” 

Checking out doesn’t take too long since they were able to keep most of the groceries they had from the old apartment. There were random items that they hadn’t bothered to stock back up on since they would be moving, but not enough that Shouta feels weighed down by bags. 

As he’s deciding if the gummies and his jelly pouches can fit into one bag or if he’ll have to use a second one, his phone starts buzzing. Caller ID says it’s Inko, so he picks up immediately.  

“Yeah?” 

“Hi Shouta - Izuku, stop that - are you still at the store?” 

“Yeah. I’m checking out now.” 

“Oh, I was hoping to catch you before that. Is it too much of a bother for you to grab some acetaminophen and a new first-aid kit? We’re running low on just about everything now - “ 

Shouta stares ahead at nothing. His phone feels slick in his suddenly sweaty hand. “Is Izuku okay? What happened?” 

She quickly says, “He’s fine! We’re both fine, sorry, I should’ve started with that. I’ll explain when you get home, but we’re both fine.” 

“I just stocked the kit last week, how are things already empty? Is someone listening? If someone’s listening start talking about Izuku’s last math test - “ 

“We’re fine,” she says more firmly. “Neither of us is hurt. There’s no one listening. There’s no rush. Finish up and come home, but you don’t need to worry. I’m sorry for startling you.” 

He swallows. “Okay. I’ll be back soon.” 

“Great! I was thinking I’d make hamburger steak tonight since we still have beef, does that sound good?” 

“Sure. Whatever is fine.” 

He hangs up. Tries and fails to loosen the grip he has on his phone. 

The aisles blur together as he rushes to get what Inko asked for. He doesn’t see exactly what he grabs, but he grabs a few of everything and then some extra to be safe. His hands are steady even as he can hear his heartbeat thumping at an uncomfortably fast clip. 

They’re fine. Inko said they were fine. Izuku’s fine. He gnaws on the inside of his cheek to stop from screaming at the other customers in his way. 

Checking out is a blur. The walk home - if him sprinting and pushing past any pedestrians could even be called a walk - is a blur. His phone is silent but he doesn’t put it back in his pocket. 

They’ll expect him to come in through the front door. Anyone would go through the door when Inko said they were fine, and she said they were fine so they’re almost definitely fine but just in case they’re not the front door would be the stupidest place for him to enter through and Shouta’s a lot of things but he’s not stupid. 

Figuring out which window leads to their new apartment is easy. Opening it is easy too - and they’ll have to discuss getting better locks, they might be on the third floor but anyone and their mother has a quirk that can get them up a few floors easily enough which means safely locked windows is a necessity. Crawling in silently even with his cargo is easiest of all, because what kind of underground hero would he be if he couldn’t? 

He wouldn’t have made it this far if he couldn’t. His stealth is the only real advantage he had over the others that got killed. 

Shouta can see the back of Inko’s head from the kitchen. Izuku is sitting in Inko’s blue recliner, chattering away. 

Someone else is lying on the couch. 

His capture weapon isn’t as advanced as the one he had in the future - Hatsume’s upgrades aren’t technologically feasible in this era quite yet and he doesn’t think anyone except for her would be able to make them anyway - but it’s second nature to use it to grab both Midoriyas and yank them behind him. 

“Mr. ‘Zawa!” Izuku immediately yells. “That’s so cool I didn’t know your scarf could do that how much can it lift do you use it to catch bad guys did you get ice cream can you hold ice cream with your scarf so it doesn’t melt onto your hands what about - “ 

“Shouta, you gave me a heart attack! What’s this about?”  

“Zip it,” he hisses, pressing them towards the window. “Inko, take Izuku and call the cops. I’ll handle this.” 

“Handle… what, exactly?” 

He jerks his head at the couch, where the intruder still is. “Tell them Eraserhead - “ 

“Oh! Shouta, it’s okay honey, that’s not - “ 

“I am NOT letting Shigaraki get his hands on you so GO - “ 

Inko’s hands reach out and grab his face, forcing him to look at her. He freezes at the look on her face. 

“Shouta,” she says tenderly, hands warm against his cheeks. Her green eyes are dry for once. “It’s okay. We’re not in danger. We’re safe. I promise, honey, we’re all okay.” 

His throat clicks as he swallows. “There’s. On the couch.” 

“I know. A young woman was hurt outside, so Izuku and I brought her up here to patch her up. That’s all.” 

“The. I don’t.” 

“It’s okay. We’re safe. You’ve kept us safe. See?” She smiles. “Izuku, you’re okay, right?” 

Izuku nods and smiles too. “It’s okay Mr. ‘Zawa. Why?” Puffing up his cheeks and thrusting his chest out as much as he can when he’s wrapped up like a tiny green burrito, he finishes with, “‘Cause we’re here!” 

Shouta drops them. He drops the groceries next. And, last but most definitely least, he drops himself and collapses to his knees. 

They’re fine. 

He can see that they are. 

“Oh dear. Izuku, baby, can you go get Mr. Aizawa a cup of water please?” 

“Mmhm.” 

So why is he still afraid? 

“Do you want to breathe with me, Shouta? I know all the breathing techniques say to breathe for four counts, but I like odd numbers better. Let’s do five, okay? In, two, three, four, five - go ahead and hold that. Three, four, five. Out, two, three, four, five. Let’s go again. In, two, three, four, five - hold, two, three, four, five - out, two, three, four, five. You’re doing great, honey. Let’s keep going. In, two, three, four, five - “ 

After an innumerable amount of repetitions, a small hand holds out a red cup and carefully deposits it into Shouta’s hand. Then a light weight appears on his shoulder - he has enough presence of mind to note that it’s a light yellow blanket that he doesn’t remember seeing before - and Izuku’s voice joins in with Inko’s. Somehow, Izuku ends up tucked against Shouta’s side and burrows in close. 

He can see the red cup in his hands. The yellow blanket. Inko’s calm face, gently smiling. Izuku’s freckled cheeks that puff up with every exaggerated breath he’s taking. His own trembling hands. 

The cup is cool in his hands. The blanket is soft. Beneath him, the carpet is cheap and scratchy. There’s a breeze coming in from the window. 

He can hear Inko’s counting. Izuku’s impatient wiggling. The TV droning in the background, saying something about a recent villain apprehension. 

The apartment smells like a smoker once lived here. Izuku’s hair smells like the green apple-scented All Might shampoo he insists on picking out every time they go shopping. 

He can taste blood in his mouth from where he bit into his cheek earlier. 

That last one is easily fixed by gulping down the water in hand. He finishes the entire cup in three swallows, and in that time, Inko and Izuku quiet down. 

“Sorry about that.” 

His voice is hoarser than he thought it would be. He wishes he had more water. 

Inko shakes her head. “It’s not a problem at all. I’m sorry that we worried you. I should’ve let you know there was someone here.” 

“No, stop. Fuck. I - It’s your home. You shouldn’t have to. It’s fine. This is just me being - “ 

“It’s your home too,” Inko insists. “You deserve to feel safe here. I should’ve told you why we needed the extra supplies, but I didn’t want to hold you up since you were checking out in case there were people behind you. I thought it was okay for it to wait until you got back. I really didn’t mean to worry you.” 

“You told me you were fine. I should’ve. I don’t know. Fuck.” 

They sit in silence for a few seconds. Izuku is the only one not motionless, fidgeting in place and looking up at Shouta then looking down at his feet. 

“What, Izuku?” 

Izuku glances over at his mom, then glances up at Shouta again, then blurts out, “Do you like the blanket ‘cause Mom let me pick it out for you and it was s’posed to be for your birthday but it looked like you needed it now and I remembered that you liked cats and your sleeping bag’s yellow but you said you liked blue flavor jelly so maybe you would’ve liked the blue one better but anyway do you like it?” 

Shouta pulls part of the blanket around for him to look at more closely. It’s a pale yellow and covered in pink paw-prints. In between the paw-prints are small gray cats in various poses - some curled up sleeping, others batting at balls of yarn, some sprawled out and waving a paw forward. 

It’s sickeningly cute. 

He tugs it tighter around him and pats Izuku’s head with a hand that only trembles a little bit. “It’s great. Thank you.” 

Izuku beams back. 

“Well!” Inko claps her hands together. “Shouta, do you want to lie down for a bit before dinner? A nap would probably do you some good.” 

“No, I can help with dinner. Or at least put the groceries away.” 

From the couch, there’s the sound of movement. A familiar face peeks up past the back of the couch and grins widely at them. 

Nemuri Kayama, pro-hero Midnight, looks as mischievous ever. Her face and neck are covered in bruises, and when she lifts up a finger to cutely emphasize one of her dimples, her wrist has been wrapped with a compression bandage. 

She says, “Who would’ve guessed that Shouta Aizawa, of all people, would’ve gone domestic so soon? It’s bringing a tear to my eye.” 

Shouta stands up and walks away. “Never mind. I’m taking that nap. I’m not dealing with this right now.” 

“You’re so MEAN, Shouta!” 

“Mr. ‘Zawa isn’t mean! Take it back!”

Chapter Text

Nemuri had been fighting a typical villain, overestimated how much of her quirk she should use against a guy who could grow and shrink, then had that guy fall on top of her while he was the size of a grizzly bear. Most of her injuries are from the fight beforehand, while the wrist and head wound were from the villain’s collapse and her subsequent smack against concrete. 

This all happened across the street that could be seen from their new window, so Inko had called the cops to pick up the villain then helped Nemuri inside to patch her up. 

“She said she didn’t want to go to the hospital. Izuku didn’t recognize her - “ 

“Thank God for small mercies,” Shouta mutters. If Izuku had recognized the 18+ hero, they would have to discuss putting a parental lock on the wi-fi.

“So I figured she either wanted to stay out of the spotlight and was an underground hero like you, or a good Samaritan that wasn’t interested in being on the news.” 

“And then this sweet young lady patched me up like a regular Florence Nightingale,” Nemuri coos. “Give her a sexy nurse’s outfit and I would’ve felt right at home. I never would’ve guessed that a sweetheart like her would put up with your grumpy ass, though.” 

Inko leans across the table and, with a bright smile, says, “Watch your language, Ms. Kayama.” 

“Sor - “ 

“Please eat.” 

“Um. Okay - “ 

“Now.” 

Nemuri’s chopsticks start shoveling food into her mouth. 

Inko turns back to Shouta. “So, you see, nothing to worry about. The cops took the villain away, Ms. Kayama has been patched up, and you remembered to get Izuku’s snacks for the week. Meanwhile, we’ve finished unpacking and as long as Ms. Kayama minds her manners and remembers that there is a child here, you have a friend to catch up with.” 

At Inko’s stink eye, Nemuri squeaks, “Yes ma’am.” 

If Shouta didn’t already like Inko, the way she’s cowed Nemuri into behaving is more than enough to earn his eternal admiration. 

On any other day, he’d be perfectly capable of tolerating her usual antics and giving as good as he got. After his bout of panic and with this being the first time he’s seen Nemuri in this time, he doesn’t think he can handle her over-the-top flirting without a bit of a buffer. Inko, pretty much the perfect person, is keeping him from being overwhelmed in the aftermath of his little breakdown. 

It doesn’t hurt that Izuku insisted on sitting next to him at dinner and then proceeded to move his chair as close as possible to Shouta’s without actively being on his lap. If it makes him feel better to have his problem child within arms’ reach, he thinks that it’s fairly harmless. 

If it makes him smirk that Izuku keeps glaring at Nemuri for insulting him - well, that’s fairly harmless too. 

“So, um.” Nemuri looks at Inko, who seems satisfied by both her tone and the amount of food she’s eaten. “Shouta. How’d you and Inko meet? Last I heard, you were going deep undercover. I didn’t know you’d resurfaced or I would’ve texted you to grab a drink or something.” 

“Undercover…?” Shouta scratches his chin and thinks. “Hm. I think I lied about that.” 

“Huh?” 

“Pretty sure that was a lie. I still haven’t signed with an agency.” 

“You haven’t?” 

“Yeah. I’ve been freelancing.” 

“Why’d you lie?” She blinks, then adds, “Why’d you lie and why are you telling the truth now?” 

“I didn’t want you to know I was homeless. Now I’m not homeless so I can tell you.” 

Nemuri, understandably, gapes at him. Shouta leans over with a napkin to wipe ketchup off of Izuku, who helpfully tilts his chin up. 

“You - why didn’t you say anything? You didn’t have to wait and shack up with a girlfriend, you could’ve stayed with me!” 

“I didn’t want to.” 

“Why not?! We’re friends! We could’ve made it work!” 

“I’d’ve wanted to wring your neck within two days of staying with you and you would’ve wanted me to leave but been too nice to make me do it.” 

“So being homeless was better?!” 

“Not necessarily better, but we’re still friends so it was the probably best option.” 

She buries her face in her hands and groans loudly. “Shouta, for fuc - god’s sake. Are you kidding me? I don’t care if I would’ve been annoyed having you with me, that’s better than you not having anywhere to stay!” 

“It’s fine. Things are fine now.” 

Nemuri groans again. 

The thing about his friendship with Nemuri is that as much as he cares about her, she struggles to balance what she needs with wanting to care for her friends. She wants to know everything about her friends - likes to pick at them and dig and dig and dig until she comes up with a way to sort out whatever is bothering them. She wants to fix things and comes up with what, to her, seems like a perfect solution. It's what makes her a great friend in general, but it's also what has her and Shouta butting heads more often than not. 

Independent yet dependable, Hizashi used to call her. 

Shouta isn’t exactly great at communication. He’s better than he used to be, but he’s not the most eloquent, which makes it hard for him to explain his thought processes to someone who sees things as straightforward-ly as Nemuri does. The solutions that she comes up with may work in a perfect scenario, but life rarely proceeds perfectly and that means Shouta can rarely take her advice while still doing what he feels is right. 

To her, the easy solution to “Shouta is homeless” is “Shouta moves in with Nemuri.” And in a perfect world, that would be fine. 

In this world, with all of its gritty practicality and flaws, Nemuri would’ve been miserable if Shouta moved in with her. Their friendship would’ve been irrevocably ruined. He knew this when he was a teenager just out of school, and he knows it now as a who-knows-how-old man. 

For all that Nemuri is flirtatiously loud, she’s not as open as she portrays herself. Her preference is to be so obnoxiously visible that no one thinks to look for anything below the surface - when compared to Shouta and Hizashi, she’s downright protective of her privacy. In high school, she had lamented time and time again that her parents refused to let her have a lock for her room. 

And then, something happened in his last year of high school. It was a clusterfuck for more than one reason, what with their piss poor attempts at handling Oboro’s death from the previous year, and all of their personalities started clashing more and more due to trauma - but something had also changed with Nemuri halfway through the first semester of that year. She was already out in the field, being a year older than them, and there must have been a case or a fight that changed her. 

Something that made her even more closed off and her public flamboyance even more fake than it already had been.  

Even in the future, decades after the fact, she had never told Shouta what exactly dulled the sparkle in her eye. Part of him didn’t press because she clearly didn’t want to talk about it, but another, larger part of him didn’t want to know what had damaged her in a way Oboro’s death hadn’t. She had always been an open, loud person, but that year she learned how to weaponize her promiscuity scarily, terrifyingly well, and that isn’t a lesson that is learned in a classroom or even on a battlefield. It’s a lesson that’s had in an alleyway behind a bar, or under flashing nights at a club, or, even more horrifyingly, behind closed doors at a place that was once thought to be safe.  

He never found out, never pushed for that information, and he doesn’t know if Nemuri in the future was thankful for that or resentful. Regardless, before he and Hizashi graduated, she had signed with the first agency that paid her enough to afford moving out and living on her own. Her privacy and security assured in a way that set her at ease and made Shouta almost forget that something happened. 

Her independence is something she prides herself on - being depended on is another. Shouta’s situation would’ve made her proud to help her friend yet silently miserable for resenting him for intruding on her personal space. 

Because Shouta’s her friend, he would never put her in that situation. And, yes, it plays into his ceaseless desire to never be a nuisance to those he cares about, but that was more of an advantage than the driver for his decision. It also let him avoid the guilt over not knowing how to help her with a problem that he can’t bring himself to ask her about. 

Talking about things like that isn’t how their friendship works, though - they’re two equally closed off individuals who know each other like the back of their hand but don’t verbally acknowledge their closeness or discuss deeper topics -  so Shouta just shrugs and tugs his new blanket tighter around his shoulders. 

“I wouldn’t want to cramp your style or discourage any gentleman callers you may entice,” Shouta says blandly. “And it gave me valuable camping experience. I also have acquired a tiny student to teach tiny fighting to, so. Things have worked out well.” 

Nemuri lifts her head up finally and says, “Darling, I’m sure my gentleman callers would be delighted to welcome you to our playdates. I don’t bring anyone home unless they’re willing to share.” 

“Ick.” 

“It can’t be any worse than whatever you and your new lady love have been getting up to when the little one goes to bed,” she teases. 

Shouta contemplates how much of a pain it would be to deal with the aftermath of brawling with her in their nice, new living room. Inko would probably be unhappy, but she also looks about ready to tackle Nemuri and shove her out a window for implying anything filthy around her son. So maybe she’d let him get away with it. 

Before he can follow through, Izuku, bless his little soul, has clearly exhausted his patience. He’s been vibrating and fidgeting while the adults talk, but finally he blurts out, “Mr. ‘Zawa can we PLEASE play heroes and villains ‘cause I ate all my vegetables and did good on my spelling test the other day and I didn’t even cry when Kacchan burnt my homework up AND I kicked good enough that you said it was good so can we PLEASE play now?” 

Shouta almost cringes from how endearing he finds his problem child’s pleas. Then he says, “Wait, Bakugou messed with your homework again?” 

Izuku sighs dramatically. “Mr. ‘Zawa, he always messes with my homework. That’s why I make two copies. It actually helps a lot with studying to write it out twice! Did you know that writing stuff down activates more places in your brain than if you type stuff out? It’s better for remembering stuff!” 

This kid. 

“But anyways can we please play now?” 

Shouta looks at Nemuri. Nemuri looks back warily. 

“How about we change it up tonight? I’ll be the damsel in distress. Or trapped civilian. Or someone you have to rescue. Whatever. And Nemuri can be the villain.” 

Izuku turns wide green eyes to Nemuri, who shrinks back into her seat. Her eyes dart over to Inko, who looks as amused as Shouta feels. “Uh, I don’t - I’m not great with kids.” 

“Ah, but you’ll be playing heroes and villains,” Shouta says. “You know how to handle heroes. And Izuku here will be a hero during the game.” 

Izuku turns shy, suddenly. He ducks his head and curls his hands around each other. “U-um. If you don’t want to play. It’s okay. Y-you don’t have to, Miss Kayama.” 

Nemuri’s face devolves into pure, unadulterated panic. Shouta ducks his face into his capture weapon to make sure he doesn’t start cackling. “N-no! I mean, uh, I want to play. We can play heroes and villains! I don’t. I don’t know what that is but. Oh god please don’t cry.” 

Shouta leans over and nudges Izuku lightly. In a faux-whisper, he says, “You’ll have to show her the ropes, kid. I don’t think she’s ever played before.” 

“Um. Miss Kayama. If you want to play, I-I can teach you. It’s really fun and if you want to be the hero you can be since you’ve never done it before a-and that’s funner - “ 

“Oh, but that won’t work,” Shouta butts in again. Partly to annoy Nemuri, but also partly because he knows that Izuku prefers being the hero. “You always said that I can’t be the hero since I’m already a hero and it wouldn’t be playing pretend that way. Nemuri’s a hero too, so she won’t be playing pretend unless she plays as a villain.” 

Izuku’s shyness disappears as quickly as it appeared, with his head snapping up and spinning in his seat to face Nemuri. Nemuri, who somehow pales even further, says, “Um.” 

“MISS KAYAMA YOU’RE A HERO TOO? WHAT KIND OF HERO ARE YOU WHAT’S YOUR QUIRK - “ 

Revenge is nice. Revenge that has Inko covering her face to suppress her laughter, revenge where Shouta will be able to lie on the floor and nap while playing the civilian in need of rescue from the evil, evil villain - even better.

Chapter Text

Time passes as it does when someone with a temporal quirk isn’t fucking around with it. 

    Shouta adds “Hisashi Midoriya” to his list of extracurricular investigations. 
    Eraserhead is slowly becoming more respected and feared in turn, depending on which side of the law people fall on. 
    He continues to have weekly coffee with Hizashi, who occasionally surprises him by not being hungover. 
    Nemuri drags him off for lunch every once in a while to make sure he still has a roof overhead while pointedly not pestering him about the panic attack she oversaw. 
    Izuku gets scarily good at kicking him in places where it hurts - not a surprise, considering Deku’s proficiency with his chosen fighting style. 
    Inko gets a promotion at work, becoming a senior analyst and receiving a raise that gives her some financial breathing room. 

Before he knows it, Izuku’s birthday is right around the corner. 

Unsurprisingly, Shouta has never been much of a “celebrating” type. The closest he gets to celebrating anything is when he treats himself to a sugary coffee drink after any string of back-to-back missions. He’d go to parties if Hizashi or Nemuri made him, he’d partake in holiday traditions when forced to by those idiot students of his, but without outside interference, he’s not much for joy and cheer just because a date on the calendar tells him it’s time to. 

As stated, his reticence isn’t exactly surprising. He’s a bitter old man who doesn’t give much of a damn about much of anything. 

Izuku’s lackluster response, though. 

That’s disconcertingly odd. 

“All kids like their birthdays,” Hizashi says when he brings it up. “Maybe he’s trying to do the ‘too cool for school’ thing? Where he doesn’t want to look too eager?” 

Shouta shakes his head. “Doubt it. Izuku’s middle name may as well be eager. He’s eager about everything. He’s eager to wake up in the morning and eager to run around and exhaust me all day. That’s why the lack of eagerness is strange.” 

“Hm.” Hizashi scratches at his chin - miraculously free of dried drool and acne for once. He still looks like he needs a week or two of hibernation to get rid of the bags under his eyes, but he’s much less of a mess than usual. 

It’s nice to see. 

“And Inko doesn’t know either?” 

“Nope. She’s worried.” 

“Like you aren’t.” 

Shouta shrugs, uncomfortable with the comparison to Izuku’s mother but unable to disagree. “It’s strange. That’s all.” 

“Have you asked him about it?” 

Izuku’s painfully bright smile as he faked excitement, his, “Oh yeah! I guess I just forgot. I’m happy of course, I’m turning eight!” and “Oh, um. Hero stuff!” when asked what he wanted for his big day, his blatantly obvious attempts to change the subject - No kid should be trying to hide what’s bothering him so completely. 

“He lied. Said he had forgotten about it completely. If he wasn’t a kid, I’d believe him.” 

“But he is a kid.” 

He gives another tired shrug. “I don’t know what to do. It’s only going to be me and Inko doing anything for him, but I don’t want to make him upset if he really doesn’t like his birthday.” 

Hizashi hums thoughtfully around a mouthful of tea. “I think that it’s better for him to get upset because you did something for his birthday than for him to get upset because he thinks you forgot or didn’t care enough to do something. You with me?” 

It makes sense. Fits in line with what Izuku has said in not-so-many words. He nods at Hizashi, who grins back. 

“So, that leads us to the next crisis - What should you do for your little listener? What does Izu-chan like best?” 

“Heroes,” Shouta says immediately. “The kid barely talks about anything else. He writes about them constantly. I’ve played more rounds of ‘heroes and villains’ than I can count.”

“Easy then.” Hizashi claps his hands together. “Now, easy question: Who’s his favorite hero?” 

Shouta’s expression sours against his will. “All Might. Flashy, obnoxious, red-white-and-blue All Might. It’s infuriating.” 

Hizashi presses his thumb against the table like he’s pressing a button and loudly says, “BZZZZZT. Wrong.” 

“Wrong? I think I’d know who his favorite hero is. I live with the kid.” He makes a face and mutters, “He made me learn all the words to All Might’s theme song. All Might is his favorite. Obviously.” 

Hizashi stares at him like he’s a moron, then pulls out his wallet. Tucked next to his hero license is a bright orange piece of construction paper, which he carefully pulls out and meticulously unfolds. After flattening it out a tad, he holds it out to Shouta. 

“The latest card from the kid says differently.” 

Shouta is staring down at a childish depiction of him in his hero uniform. Picture-him has a capture weapon like a gray snake around his neck, yellow rectangles acting as his goggles, and his own scruffy face rendered in black crayon. The entire card is covered in yellow, gray, and black squiggles. And, of course, there’s the scrawled, “Get better soon!” in childish handwriting that Shouta knows better than his own. 

“That’s not - “ Shouta pushes it back at him, shaking his head and refusing to melt into a puddle of fond goo. “Ignoring the fact that him drawing a picture of me doesn’t mean I’m his favorite hero, it’d be incredibly arrogant for me to give him a present based on me.” 

“He’d lose his goddamn mind if you gave him a scarf like your capture weapon. I’d bet any amount of money on it.” Hizashi folds the card up before tucking it back into his wallet with tender care. “If he gushes about you a quarter of the amount you gush about him, I don’t think All Might stands a chance.” 

He rolls his eyes. “Maybe I’ll get him some Present Mic merch. Do you have any discounts for your best friend?” 

“Normally I would say yes, but in this case I want a picture of you and Izu-chan in matching outfits and therefore refuse to assist you in purchasing any item that isn’t going to help turn him into a mini-you.” 

“You’re obnoxious.” 

Hizashi gives him a cheesy grin and winks. “Always, babe.” 

“So now that we’ve talked about my crisis,” Shouta drawls, leaning back in his seat. “What’s yours? I saw the tabloid that claimed you were going to take a break from hero work to go search for - what was it? The Loch Ness Monster?” 

“The Loch - pft, nah.” He shakes his head. “Well, they weren’t wrong about the break, though I haven’t announced it officially yet.” 

Shouta blinks. “Huh?” 

Hizashi doesn’t meet his eyes as he gives a sheepish chuckle. “Er. Yeah. I just. Probably for the next month or so.” 

He doesn’t remember seeing any news stories of dangerous fights or injuries, but -  “Did you get hurt?” 

“No, nothing like that.” 

He fiddles with his sleeves, still not meeting Shouta’s eyes. Shouta, in turn, waits for an answer. 

“I. Um. Well.” 

“If you don’t want to tell me, you don’t have to force yourself.” 

“No, I just. It’s embarrassing.” 

He snorts. “More embarrassing than when you threw up on me after our second tactics class?” 

Before he can rag on him more and use their years of friendship against him, Hizashi blurts out, “I’m going to rehab. Or, well - Something like that. It’s not like. ‘Rehab’ rehab, but it’s um. A retreat. Thing. For the drinking and everything. And they’re setting me up with a personal coach and everything for after. Accountability, you know? My agency’s been pretty cool about it, helped me get it set up. So. That’s why. I’ll be gone for bit.” 

His eyes are scrunched closed by the end of his announcement, and his shoulders are high around his ears. There’s a lot of tension running through him, like Shouta’s going to laugh at him or berate him for making a, frankly, remarkable decision. 

It’s not common to see someone taking active steps to better themselves. It’s even rarer to see anyone voluntarily decide to attend any sort of rehabilitation program without some sort of intervention. 

After a pause to absorb something Shouta had never dared hope to hear - something he hadn’t heard the first time around, something he hadn’t considered would happen when last time it certainly didn’t - he says honestly, “That’s great.” 

“It’s not - I mean, I don’t know how it’s going to go and maybe it’s - “ 

“It’s great. You’re going to do great.” 

Hizashi peeks at him from behind his bangs. “Yeah?” 

“Yeah.” 

He releases a breath like it’s a gust of wind. “Thanks.” 

“It’s not embarrassing, you know. Accepting help takes a lot of strength. Strength that I rarely have,” Shouta admits shamelessly. “I’m impressed. And I’m happy. Even if I’ll have to give up being the pretty one between the two of us once you stop looking like a corpse.” 

That gets him an undignified snort of laughter. “You’re the worst.” 

“Noted.” 

Hizashi finally looks up at him, and Shouta’s taken aback by the gratitude being directed at him. There’s something soft in Hizashi’s face that Shouta’s only seen a few times over the duration of their friendship, something fond and affectionate and tender in a way that makes the back of his neck feel hot. 

He reaches up to scrub at it just to be sure it’s not a rash of some kind. Maybe he should wash his capture weapon, make sure there isn’t some sort of pollen stuck in its fibers. 

“Our first meeting here, you said that when I was ready to get help, that you’d be here. I think you were the only one who acknowledged that I even needed help. And you were here.” Hizashi visibly swallows, and he gives Shouta a small, tremulous smile. “It meant a lot. Means a lot, I mean.” 

Shouta wants to say, “I’d do anything for you, dumbass,” or “I’m sorry - I’m so sorry - that I made you think there was any universe where I wouldn’t be there for you if you needed me, because there isn’t one. There isn’t,” or “You’re my best fucking friend in the world and losing you once was too much and nearly broke me, I can’t survive it a second time.” 

That’s too raw, though. Too laden with decades of history that this Hizashi doesn’t have yet and hopefully never will. 

Instead, Shouta reaches over and pokes his forehead and boredly says, “Of course. I’ll always be here when you need me. And sometimes when you think you don’t.” 

Hizashi swats at his hand, smile growing. “You know it’s the same for you, right? I’m a mess right now, but I won’t always be. If you need me, I’d do anything.” 

“How about when you get back you get dinner with my roommates? They’ve been dying to meet you.” 

“What? Of course! I didn’t know, I would’ve met them ages ago - “ 

Shouta would never tell Hizashi that he wouldn’t dare let him near the Midoriyas if he couldn’t guarantee Hizashi was a hundred percent sober. He might trust drunk-Hizashi with his life even if the guy’s a plastered jackass, but not with Inko's or Izuku’s. He instead says, “I wasn’t ready for the energy you and Izuku will generate together. You two in the same room together are going to be exhausting, and I had to prepare myself.” 

“It won’t be that bad!” 

“Maybe I’ll give you Benadryl beforehand so you’re not as peppy. Or make sure Inko has chamomile tea on hand.” 

“I’m not going to see you for a MONTH and you’re teasing me! Is this how you want our last coffee date to be until we reunite?” 

“I want you to pay for my frappuccino, but I’ll take what I can get.” 
Chapter 12: izuku's birthday - pt.2
Summary:

    The beginning of a very long day.

Notes:

    guys you all are too sweet... i keep being really pleasantly surprised by how positive of a reception this fic has been receiving since it's 95% me going "i just want izuku to have nice things" and aizawa, being my fave character, got the dubious pleasure of being the Main Character. thank you all for the support <3

    i also just realized i didn't include a hurt/comfort tag on this fic which is a HUGE mistake b/c it's like. 95% hurt/comfort at all times. so tags will be updated when i get a free min to do that.

    hope you all like this chapter - there's some explanation of things happening off-screen, and we get some insight into inko's stressors in this one!

    (also, if you have the time and care enough!!! question for all of you: if i wrote some one-shots of different characters in this 'verse and what's happening with them from their perspective rather than shouta's, is that something you'd be interested in? and if yes, what characters are you most curious about? i can't guarantee i'll get around to this anytime soon b/c i don't want to lose my momentum with the fic itself, so i'm mostly gauging interest for if inspiration strikes. it'd be in a separate work - this work is going to only be shouta's POV if it keeps going according to plan. anyway - lmk~! )

Chapter Text

Izuku’s birthday happens to fall on the last day of the semester. This is, coincidentally, the day after one of Shouta’s biggest “Let’s Fix the Future” operations comes to an end. 

(The name is a misnomer - it implies that he had any sort of plan when he ended up in the past. He certainly didn’t plan to live with the Midoriyas or accidentally stumble upon Chisaki’s predecessor and subsequently take out Overhaul’s operation within the first year after his arrival.) 

It means that Inko wakes up even earlier than usual to prepare a special breakfast, and Shouta doesn’t bother falling asleep after getting back from the police station. Inko gripes at him for coming back even later (earlier? The terminology gets iffy once it passes three in the morning) than usual and proceeds to fuss over the bruises and cuts he accumulated. 

“It’s not that bad,” Shouta assures her, still dazed. “Not nearly as bad as last time. I didn’t think it’d go so easily, to be honest.” 

“Whatever it was, you’re a mess,” Inko says, unimpressed. She looks disdainfully at the dust and debris coating his hair, shoulders, arms, thighs - well, his everything . “Go take a shower. You can sleep the rest of the day after we send Izuku off to school with a good start to his birthday.” 

“Yeah yeah, I’m going.” 

The shower is a welcome relief, its warm water relaxing muscles that he didn’t realize were still tense, soap washing away at least a week’s worth of grime, if not more. He hadn’t realized he’d let his hygiene go for so long - too caught up in work, too preoccupied with making sure said work didn’t follow him home, too exhausted to give a damn about anything except putting certain yakuza bastards behind bars.  

There’s going to be an inquiry, he knows. He was too rough with apprehending Chisaki. 

What they found at his base of operations will be more than enough to put him away for the rest of his life - organizing human experimentation and trafficking rings tend to be for-life sentences on their own, the two together utterly damning, and the Shie Hassaikai’s boss has blacklisted Chisaki from any yakuza contacts within law enforcement. Even with that, if he somehow doesn’t get convicted, the Shie Hassaikai itself will ensure the rest of his life is short. 

Essentially, Chisaki’s life is virtually over no matter what happens from now on out. There wasn’t any need for Shouta to be as brutal with the apprehension as he was. 

Then he remembers the cages full of people - children, teenagers, adults, people of all ages and races and quirk types - who flinched when Shouta unlocked their restraints. Who were trembling and crying as they were shepherded into vans and ambulances, depending on their state. Who, even though they were being saved, didn’t look relieved or hopeful in the slightest. 

It makes him sick to think that those people were long dead by the time Shouta even knew of Overhaul the first time around. And to think that, decades in the future, none of them had any idea of how many subjects there had been before Eri - it’s horrific. 

Chisaki was arrested with a mangled leg and a nose that looked more like playdough than anything else. It’s less than he deserves and kinder than he had been to dozens of innocents. 

It feels anticlimactic. 

Here Shouta is, showering and preparing for a child’s birthday party, while Overhaul is drugged up on quirk suppressants and on his way to prison. One of the most fearsome enemies he’s come across, a man who was only stopped last time due to Deku and Eri’s stubbornness suddenly is no longer a problem. 

Thanks to some carefully planted intel and the current boss’s lack of mercy, Shouta ended Chisaki before he took control of the Shie Hassaikai. Even with his astonishingly powerful quirk, he was no match against a squad of pros and plenty of federal agents. 

Nemuri took out everyone except Overhaul - the man’s mysophobic ways had him wearing a mask that purified all air he breathed, rendering her gas useless against him. Still, even with him unaffected by her somnic aroma, Chisaki didn’t stand a chance with Shouta’s quirk and physical body at their peaks. 

There’s a chance that the Shie Hassaikai will be a problem in the future. Rei - the name of its current boss - is far from a saint, of course. 

Rei, however, dotes on his daughter.

Alana, a half-American girl with white hair and red eyes that were alarmingly familiar, has clearly lived a good life. She’s a flirtatious, irresponsible but beloved heiress, and Rei indulges her at every turn. Shouta only spoke to them once, at a nightclub that was hot and crowded enough to make him sweat just thinking about the place, but it was enough of a look to understand how Chisaki got his hands on Eri the first time around. His guess is that Alana was too busy partying to take care of a child and Rei, a family man at heart, took Eri in as his own. 

It’s also likely why Chisaki killed Rei the first time around - to get a hold of his granddaughter and use her for his crusade against quirks. Rei doesn’t seem like the kind of man that would tolerate his blood being used as a lab experiment, no matter how useful or profitable. 

The Shie Hassakai may be a problem later, but right now, they’re relatively harmless. Some drug smuggling, some thuggish behavior, but nothing that Shouta is inclined to step in on. If the cops want to waste their time cracking down on their territory - more power to the pigs. Rei runs an extremely clean ship and nothing will stick. 

Maybe this time Eri will grow up with her family. It makes him smile and breaks his heart at the same time. 

Through the haze of exhaustion and processing what, exactly, he just accomplished, he somehow finishes shampooing and cleaning himself. 

As he’s rinsing off, there’s a loud knock at the door. It’s too heavy and early to be from Izuku, so Inko must be fed up with how long he’s been in the bathroom. She’s exceptionally good at demonstrating her displeasure with things like pointed knocking and cutting looks, all completely wordlessly. 

Shouta doesn’t know if it’s an Inko-thing or a mom-thing. His own mother, hardly a stellar example of parenting, barely ever looked at him and when she did, she had plenty to say. 

Dutifully, he towels off and gets dressed in clean clothes. Inko had tossed a wad of cash at him a few weeks back and begged him to buy more clothes, saying, “You can’t cycle through your hero costume and your two casual outfits every three days until laundry day when laundry day is once a week. You sweat too much for that.” 

“I don’t sweat that much,” Shouta protested. 

“You sweat enough. I don’t care what you buy, but you need to get at least five more outfits.” 

So, instead of the same jeans and tank top he had been living in for who-knows-how-long, he wanders into the kitchen wearing pink sweatpants and a black t-shirt. Inko has somehow managed to make enough food to feed an army before Izuku’s even considered waking up and has now moved onto frantically wrapping the last gifts she's pulled together for him. 

“Can I help with anything?” 

“Get us our coffee, and once we’re through the first pot, we’ll go and wake Izuku up. I don’t want him opening most of his gifts before school or else he’ll be distracted with whatever one we let him take with for the day, but I want him to have enough time to eat and open at least one.” 

“Got it.” 

“Maybe the notebooks? He’ll be able to use them without being disruptive… Or the All Might pen…” 

“Probably not the pen. He’ll click it since it does the whole arm-flex thing when you do, and  his teachers suck so they'll probably confiscate it.” 

“Ah, good point. Notebooks it is and we’ll do everything else after dinner and cake.” 

Shouta, staring at the coffee maker as liquid drips into the pot, tosses her a thumbs up. 

For a while, they go about their respective tasks. There’s the gentle sounds of scissors cutting into wrapping paper and the tape dispenser rolling, coffee drip-drip-dripping into the pot, some gentle humming from Inko when she gets to the corners of each package. Before Shouta knows it, the lingering unease he has leftover from work has drained away and he has two mugs full of caffeine. 

Shouta carefully sets Inko’s mug down away from her wrapping station, and she gives him a brisk nod of gratitude. He sips and lets warmth seep into his hands.

Halfway through his mug, his calm is disrupted when Inko suddenly slams her scissors down and rests her head in her hands. Some of her untouched coffee splashes onto the table and Shouta, against his will, startles and almost drops his drink. 

Inko’s shoulders are shaking, and her palms are digging into her eyes. Shouta asks, “What’s wrong?” 

“What kind of child isn’t excited about their birthday? I don’t - I don’t know what else I can do. I don’t know what else TO do. Am I a bad mother? Is it my fault?” 

“Inko, no - “ he lets his mug clatter to the table and darts to stand next to her, grabbing her shoulders and twisting her to face him. She looks at him miserably, dry-eyed and eerily blank. “You’re not a bad mother.” 

“My son’s being horrifically abused by everyone in his life that isn’t in this apartment. And I keep sending him back - I keep letting him go to school and get beaten down, physically and emotionally, and god only knows what’s happening that he hides from us, and I just. Let him.” A strange, choked noise escapes her throat, and then it evolves into a - still dry - sob. “I let him go back even as they’re hurting him, Shouta. What kind of mother does that?” 

“A practical one.” 

She laughs, but it sounds painful. She closes her eyes and pinches her nose, face twisted. “Practical. Great. Just what a mother should be. Practical. I’m a disgrace. What kind of mother values practicality over her child’s happiness?” 

Shouta meant it as a compliment, or at the very least a comfort. Sometimes he forgets that what he as a hero thinks is a good trait to have isn’t how other people necessarily view the situation. 

He could try to be comforting, but that’s never been his strong point. He goes for blunt honesty instead. “Inko, your son has been handed an unbelievably shitty set of circumstances. He’s quirkless and people will always judge him for that. He’s sensitive and gentle at heart, and they’ll mistreat him for that too. He’s not going to ever have an easy life.” 

She throws her hands up in the air and spins to look at him, snapping, “Shouta, for fuck’s sake - “ 

“But,” he continues firmly. “He’s strong. He’s kind. He still smiles. He’s going to be a hero - hell, he already is one to you and to me. Neither of us would be half as happy if he wasn’t here. I wouldn’t be here, relatively healthy and whole and happier than I’ve been in longer than I’m comfortable admitting, without him.” 

He pauses and waits for Inko to look him in the eyes. When she finally does, he says, “Do not disrespect your son by making his struggles about you.” 

Inko’s eyes widen.

“He’s strong enough to handle all of this if you’re supporting him completely. If you’re giving it your all and then some. If you split your attention between him and your own self-pity, then you’re doing him and the pain he’s actively working to overcome a disservice.”

They stare at each other for a moment. 

“But - “ Inko’s voice falters. “You don’t get it. How terrible it feels - I can’t even give him one day where he’s treated the way he should be.“ 

“I’m not Izuku’s parent. I won’t pretend to understand how you feel and how hard this is for you. I know, for me, it burns when I go to pick him up and he’s clearly just stopped crying. It kills me that neither of us has a job or lifestyle where we can home-school him and shield him from everything.” He shrugs helplessly. “Can’t change any of that though. He wants to be a pro-hero - he has to go to school to be one. That’s all there is to it. 

“What we can do, though, is support him. We can treat him the way he should be within our home and make sure he knows how great he is.” He stands up straight, shoves his hands in his pockets, and shrugs. “I think that starts with not blubbering all over his birthday breakfast, but, again, I’m not the parent here.” 

Inko stares at him as he raises an eyebrow at her. After a long, weighted pause, she shakes her head and snorts. “You’re something else, Shouta. Go get the birthday boy, will you?” 

He does. 

When he gently shakes him awake, muttering, “C’mon kid. Birthday time. Your mom made breakfast,” Izuku’s bleary, “Huh?” is cuter than it has any right to be.

Shouta can’t stop himself from ruffling the curly green hair. Izuku proceeds to whine incoherently and tries to burrow back into the sheets. He runs his hand through Izuku’s hair and lets the kid have another two minutes of coziness - it’s his birthday, after all. 

Then he swings Izuku up and carries him out to the living room, ignoring his tired groan. Izuku latches onto him and curls his limbs around Shouta’s middle, grumbling and tucking his head under Shouta’s chin. 

Like a recalcitrant koala, Shouta thinks. 

“Izuku!” Inko cheers when they make it to the living room. She has a little party popper, which shoots off red, yellow, and blue confetti when she sets it off. Izuku perks up a little, looking at her in confusion. Inko’s face is remarkably clear of any signs of her earlier meltdown, and she beams at her son and walks up to press gentle kisses against every inch of his face. By the time she reaches his nose, he’s giggling and squirming in Shouta’s arms.  “Happy birthday! You’re getting so big , I can’t stand it! You won’t be my little baby boy much longer, especially with Shouta teaching you how to be big and strong.” 

Izuku, smiling and visibly pleased, says, “I’m gonna be your big and strong hero instead, Mama!” 

Inko’s beaming face somehow gets brighter. “Of course you are. I can’t wait.” 

“Big and strong heroes need to eat breakfast,” Shouta says tonelessly. “You going to let go anytime soon to do that, or…?” 

Izuku giggles and lets go of the death grip he has on Shouta’s neck. Because it’s his birthday, Shouta places him on his feet instead of dropping him like he normally does. And, because it’s his birthday, Shouta doesn’t hide how happy he is when Izuku smiles up at him.

Chapter Text

Izuku is, of course, delighted by the hero-themed notebooks they present him with after he’s eaten his fill. The rest of his “getting-ready-for-school” time is spent with him audibly debating whether to use the All Might or Ectoplasm notebook for math. 

Shouta tries to encourage him to use the Ectoplasm one without saying, “He’ll be your math teacher in a few years and I know your first day at UA will be absolutely hysterical if you have childhood math notes stashed somewhere in a notebook with his face on it.” 

It’s unclear if his efforts are fruitful or not. Izuku won’t decide until he starts working on math, probably, so Shouta will just have to wait. 

Surprisingly, the notebook with the number two hero’s face on it is left behind. Endeavor, looking out sternly from a wall of flames, is tossed haphazardly onto Izuku’s desk when the boy starts to load up his backpack for the day. 

“Not a fan of Endeavor?” Shouta asks, interested despite himself. He knew that Deku had never worked well with Enji Todoroki, but he hadn’t thought Izuku had a single hero he disliked. A fanboy through and through, up until now there’s seemingly been no limit to his hero worship. 

Izuku pauses from where he’s pulling on his socks. He glances at the notebook in question, then turns back to Shouta. “You know how you said awhile back that the world isn’t divided into just heroes and villains?” 

“Uh. Sounds like something I’d say.” This kid’s memory is something else. Shouta vaguely remembers saying something similar, a few days before they moved to their current apartment, but not in any detail. 

“Well. You said, ‘The world isn’t divided into heroes and villains. Not the way those shows you like watching try to say. Sometimes, someone causing a problem is just a person in a bad position. Just because someone is getting arrested doesn’t mean they’re a villain, or even a bad person,’” he recites dutifully. “And I think the opposite’s true, too. Just because someone’s getting someone arrested doesn’t mean they’re a hero. Endeavor’s popular, but I don’t really know why. He’s always talked about on the news ‘cause he injured civilians or someone’s mad at him for breaking things he shouldn’t or for hurting people he shouldn’t.” Izuku stands up and stretches. 

Shouta stares at him blankly. 

Izuku, undeterred, continues, “I don’t think he’s very heroic. His stats in regards to civilian lives and livelihoods left unaffected in the wake of villain attacks are significantly worse than not only All Might’s, but almost all of the other heroes in the top ten. Sure, his quirk is destructive - I can’t think of many situations where fire as strong as his can be used in a non-damaging way - but there’s plenty of situations where he shouldn’t have to use his quirk but he does anyway. He never runs or touches people he’s apprehending if he doesn’t have to, you know? He just scares them into giving up by overwhelming them with fire. And I don’t think that’s something a hero should do.” 

This kid . 

Shouta says, “Warn me if you ever decide to be anything other than a hero. You’re seven and talking about subjects that people my age don’t with maturity that people twice my age don’t have.” 

Izuku puffs up his chest and says, proudly, “Mr. ‘Zawa, I’m eight now!” 

“My mistake. You’re practically ancient now, I forgot.” 

Getting Izuku to school is normal, other than the way he drags his feet the entire way. It doesn’t matter to him if they take a little longer than usual - Shouta doesn’t give a damn if Izuku is late, since it’s not like anyone at that school deserves his respect. 

Their walk to school is more of a stroll than anything else, but they eventually make it to the school gates. The bell either just rang or is about to, seeing as there are only a few stragglers walking in when they arrive. Izuku doesn’t pick up his pace - if anything, he slows down at the sight. 

Shouta glances down at him, then up at the school. “You going in?” 

“Y-yeah. In a minute.” 

“Okay.” 

Izuku’s hands are wrapped tightly around his backpack straps. He’s looking at the ground with a strangely determined expression. His breaths are evenly measured - if Shouta’s not wrong, it’s five counts in and five counts out. The same way Inko does when she’s feeling overwhelmed, and a habit Shouta’s picked up as well. 

“You alright?” 

“Mr. ‘Zawa, do you really think I can be a hero?” Izuku looks up at him, lips pressed tightly together. “You haven’t been saying it just to be nice?” 

Shouta blinks. 

“It’s okay if you were,” Izuku continues quietly. “I know you’re nice. But I just want to know for sure.” 

“You have damn near photographic memory and you don’t remember what I’ve said at least a dozen times - I’m not nice, kid.” Shouta wraps an arm around his shoulders, drags him in close, and scrubs his knuckles against Izuku’s head roughly in reprimand. “Which means I don’t say shit I don’t mean just to spare anyone’s feelings. You have the potential to be a hero if you work hard and work smart. Don’t doubt yourself or else everyone else will too. Got it?” 

Izuku’s heel slams onto his right foot and he wriggles out of Shouta’s hold easily - proof that their self-defense training is sticking, which makes Shouta’s chest glow with a familiar pride. Most wouldn’t believe it, but he really does miss teaching. 

Izuku’s bright smile is enough for now, though. He says, “Thanks Mr. ‘Zawa. I’m gonna make you proud.” 

“Yeah yeah. I’ll believe it when I see it.” He’s smiling too, though. “Are you actually going to get to class anytime soon or are you going to spend the entire day moping out here?” 

Izuku chirps, “Yessir - Bye Mr. ‘Zawa!” and runs off to start his day. 

Shouta waits until he sees Izuku enter the building, then he turns around and leaves to run his errands for the day. He can hear his bed - his bed , he thinks longingly - crying for him to rest, especially with the day off to such an emotional start already. 

But - and he will only ever admit this in the safety of his own head - Hizashi was right. Which means he needs to go buy a better gift for Izuku than the ugly All Might mug he had (with great reluctance) bought for him weeks ago.

By the time he finds what he’s looking for, taken a short nap, and altered and wrapped the stupid things, it’s just about time to walk Izuku home from school. There’s not enough time for him to take another nap, but there’s enough that it’d be weird for him to go straight to the school and hang around until the bell rings. 

It’s already a miracle that no one’s called the cops on him yet when picking Izuku up, considering he clearly isn’t a parent or older brother and looks like he’s still homeless even on a good day. He doesn’t need to press his luck by hanging around longer than necessary. 

He stops by a convenience store for a can of iced coffee to kill some time, and when that only cuts out approximately five minutes, he decides to give Nemuri a call and meander his way over to the elementary school. At least he’ll look busy while he approaches, which might make him look less like a weird old guy hanging around.  

For once, she picks up almost right away. She’s always fumbling with her phone for at least a few rings since she wears tight clothes with even tighter pockets. 

“Hey Shouta - Theoretically, if my rice cooker is smoking, do you think I should unplug it?” 

She must be home and wearing sweatpants. That explains the quick response. 

“Obviously.” 

“Cool, I definitely knew that. I’ll just. Unplug it. And I’ll leave it there. Move the curtains so it doesn’t light those up - Anyway!” she says cheerily. “What’s up? It’s rare for you to call me. Normally I’m the one chasing after you. Still have a roof overhead?” 

“Yes.” 

“Great! Keep it that way. Make sure you’re treating them right - Wouldn’t want your cute little wifey ditching your lazy ass, you got me?” 

“Stop calling Inko that. It’s weird.” 

“But she’s adorable~” 

“She also needs other adult friends. Don’t suppose you’d want to help with that?” 

He waits for a bit. 

When Nemuri doesn’t answer, he glances at his phone then puts it back up to his ear. “Hello?” 

“I’m still here. Just - surprised.” 

Shouta feels his brow furrow. “Why? I didn’t think it was that weird of a request. You don’t have to if you don’t want to, but you seem to like her alright.” 

“You know I don’t get along great with other women.” He can imagine the hand wave she makes at that comment. “I’m too catty. Too ‘promiscuous.’” 

“You think Inko would judge you for that? Despite her innocent face, I assure you she knows what sex is. See: her child, which she gave birth to and presumably had intercourse to create.” 

“Shouta,” she says with exasperation. “You know what I mean. Women think I’m a slut and they’re either jealous or bitter or judgey. Inko seems nice, but even she was pissed at me when I was over for dinner. Remember?” 

“No,” Shouta responds bluntly. “I remember that she was politely telling you to stop being crude in fron
