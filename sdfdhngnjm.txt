Chapter Text

“I don’t give a damn,” Tony said, he slammed his hand on his desk and thanked god for the Bluetooth earpiece he wore. “Get your shit together, get it figured out. Stark Industries is going live with this product next month, Mark. There just isn’t a lot of room for fuck ups, is there?”

“No, sir,” Mark said promptly. “I’ll just call tomorrow with an update?”

“You do that, Mark,” Tony said. He rolled his eyes up to the ceiling and waited until Mark disconnected before snatching the tennis ball off his desk and tossing it in the air, over and over, his eyes focused and his mind wandering as he automatically caught it.

The StarkCar (an egotistical name that made him grin every time he said it) was set to release the first prototype next month and it seemed like every day they got closer to it, he got more and more calls with problems.

Honestly, Tony thought that stopping an alien invasion and saving the earth would be his biggest challenge this summer, but Mark kept proving him wrong.

“Why can’t I just get the damn car on the market?” Tony asked aloud.

“Because you rushed the project to beat Musk and are dealing with the fallout from that decision, sir,” Jarvis said promptly, causing Tony to grin.

“Yeah, there’s that,” he agreed. “But if anyone’s going to put out energy efficient cars first, it’s not going to be that smug bastard, it’s going to be—”

“Mister Stark, call on line one, it’s important.”

“If I jump out that window, odds I’d leave behind a handsome corpse and billions to… to… Jarvis! Who gets my money if I die today?” Tony asked curiously, rolling his eyes at his secretary’s voice on the speaker. He hadn’t considered a will since before the Arc Reactor and the birth of Iron Man. The nonstop phone calls about problems with his newest project had him heavily considering it though.

“Miss Potts, sir,” Jarvis answered him.

It was probably sad that the only person Tony had to leave his money to was Pepper, but Tony was sure he had a good reason to make her his beneficiary when he did it. He pushed the thought away though and dropped the tennis ball to the floor before clicking line one on the computer and sending it to his headset.

“Go for Stark,” he said curtly.

It wasn’t Mark or any of the other engineers this time, it was the building manager, a young woman named Elaine or Laney or something similar. She sounded frantic, “Sir? There’s a situation in the lobby… I- I really think you should get down here, quick, like… run, maybe?”

Tony didn’t stop to question it. Whatever her name was, she had always been profession and an excellent building manager. If she sounded that frantic and told him to run, then that’s what Tony would do.

He did call Happy as he went, sending him to the lobby as well. Tony was an egotistical narcissist, not an idiot.

 

Happy beat him there. Tony no more than stepped off the private elevator that connected his floors to the lobby and began moving with haste to the gran desk in the center of the lobby that he took note of the scene unfolding before him.

Happy had his back to Tony, his hand on the gun he carried on his hip, and was speaking pretty damn forcefully to someone in front of him.

“Last chance before this gets ugly, leave!” Happy barked in the person’s face. “Right now!”

Tony slowed to a more casual stroll. Happy clearly had the situation well-handled.

“Mm, wish I could, but I can’t,” the figure standing in front of Happy said with a lazy drawl that was heavily accented. “And unless you’re Tony Stark, I’d appreciate you getting the fuck out of my face.”

Tony grinned. Whoever it was sounded young, snarky, just the type of guy to piss Happy right off. Tony angled around Happy so he could lean against the desk and watch the show. He did glance toward the two women that worked there, both of them were focused on Happy and this stranger, but neither looked injured or harmed in any way.

The kid, because it was just a kid, staring Happy down was probably around 5’5” and all Tony could really see of his profile was a sharp jaw that was currently clenched tightly. The kid’s hair was a damn mess, as were the sloppy clothes he wore.

Teenagers had the worst taste in clothes.

“And I would appreciate you leaving this building and never coming back before I get the cops involved,” Happy growled at the kid.

“You should try that,” the kid said seriously. Tony noticed the quick roll of his shoulders that told him the kid’s snotty tone and defiant words were for show. “In the meantime, maybe you can call your boss and tell him I’m going to make myself quite a nuisance until I talk to him?”

Tony wasn’t sure what caused him to stand up and step over to them, preventing Happy’s doubtless rant that was about to come spewing from his incredibly red face. He figured it was just the pure nerve of the kid, sassing up to a man Happy’s size seemingly without a fear in the world. Or, maybe it was more impressive because Tony could see the small signs of stress, but this kid ran his mouth anyway.

Endless smartassery was something Tony could respect.

“I can take over here,” Tony said smoothly, stepping up to the duo. He offered a hand to the kid, “Tony Stark.”

The kid ducked his head, looking quickly from Happy’s gun to Tony’s hand before flicking upward and finally letting Tony get a look at his face.

“Fuck,” Tony breathed. He let out a low whistle at the dark blue and purple bruise covering half the kid’s face. “Who beat the hell out of you?”

“Someone who got sick of hearing his mouth, probably,” Happy muttered quietly.

The kid- because he was a kid, young, tinier than he seemed when he was running his mouth, perhaps twelve -scoffed and narrowed his eyes at Tony in a distrustful expression. “You’re Tony Stark?” he asked, ignoring Tony’s question entirely.

“Sir—”

Tony shushed Happy with a small wave of the hand that the kid refused to shake. “I am,” he told him. “And you, my foul-mouthed friend, are…?”

The kid lifted his chin, a familiar gesture, and assessed Tony silently from the top of his thick black hair clear down to the high top sneakers he wore. Tony didn’t think he looked too impressed, but he was in the minority if so.

“Doesn’t matter,” the kid said brusquely. He pulled a thick sheet of paper from inside the ratty and baggy hoody he wore, and who the hell wore hoodies in New York in mid-June? It was hotter than hell outside. He waved the paper in front of Tony and Happy both, then unfolded it and read from it.

“‘I only remember his name because… well, because James was laughing like an idiot when he said it and it’s the kind of thing that sticks with you. Tony Stark, that’s the guy you need.’”

Apparently satisfied with the quote he read, the kid tucked the paper back in his pocket and fixed his eyes on Tony. “Fifteen years ago, give or take a few months, you were in London.”

It didn’t sound like a question and Tony didn’t know the answer anyway.

“Maybe?” he said. He sent a bewildered look toward Happy, but Happy’s lips were thin and he kept looking at the kid’s face, raising his brows, then looking at Tony.

Yeah, the kid looked pretty messed up. His face was bruised and there was a scar on his forehead, but Tony couldn’t do anything about some kid getting into a fight.

“Brilliant,” the kid said. He stuffed his hands in his jeans pockets and nodded at Tony. “You knocked up my mum. Congrats, I’m a boy.”

 

Tony’s first thought was illogical. The first thing he thought was, there was no way this kid was fourteen. This kid was… he was tiny, fragile looking.

And then Tony stared at the kid. Stared hard, until…

That’s what Happy was making his little ‘subtle’ Happy faces about.

Tony Stark was a rich playboy, and the media made sure the whole world knew it. Thanks to that, it wasn’t uncommon for half a dozen women or children to show up at Stark Tower every year claiming that Tony Stark knocked them up or fathered their child.

None of them were ever true, but…

But beneath the distracting bruise, this kid looked a hell of a lot like Tony did at his age. Good looking as hell, obviously, if a bit too skinny and pale. His hair was dark and messy, like Tony’s if he didn’t style it every morning. He had a similar shaped jaw, nose, even his fucking eyebrows were shaped like Tony’s.

He must have his mom’s eyes though, because those round green eyes staring so distrustfully at Tony certainly didn’t come from him.

 

“Was this the emergency?” Tony asked the two women standing behind the desk, jaws slack as they looked between Tony and the kid. They’d never called it an emergency before when some kid showed up claiming Tony was his dad. Hell, they had his DNA on store to test the kids and send them on their way even.

“Oh, no,” the kid shifted from side to side and grinned teasingly at Tony’s office manager. “Bit of a friendly disagreement there.”

“He was threatening to burn down the building when I got here,” Happy said. Well, growled really.

Tony grinned over at his long-time friend and security guard. “And you thought that made it an emergency?”

People threatened that all the time.

“Sir?”

Tony looked from the receptionist to the chair she pointed at and raised his eyebrows in surprise at the kid. “Did you burn my chair?”

One of the plush chairs in the lavish waiting room was smoldering, scorched, and ruined. Tony assumed he only didn’t notice it before because the kid himself had taken up his complete attention.

“It’s called a warning,” the kid said coolly. “I needed to talk to you and they were being bloody unhelpful, weren’t they?”

If the looks didn’t give him away as a Stark, his vocabulary certainly did.

Also, catching a chair on fire as a warning sounded a hell of a lot like something Tony would have done at this kid’s age.

“Why don’t we go talk while we do a quick, nearly painless, blood test then, huh?” Tony offered. He went to put his arm on the kid’s shoulder, but the kid flinched away and then quickly straightened himself up, as if to make it look like an intentional movement.

Happy looked at Tony, Tony looked at the kid, the kid stared boldly back at him, daring him to comment.

“After you, Kid-Who-Won’t-Tell-Me-His-Name,” Tony said evenly, forcing a grin as he waved out with his arm, gesturing toward the elevators that would take them to his private floors.

The kid snorted quietly and moved in a wide circle toward the elevators, swinging as far from Tony and Happy as he could even while his chin was thrust upward and his shoulders were squared.

“Hey, want me to go with?” Happy murmured, pulling on Tony’s shirt sleeve and watching the kid warily.

Tony watched the kid too, and damn if he didn’t think this might be the first kid to step foot in Stark Industries that was born to him. “Nah,” he waved Happy off and grinned when the kid propped his skinny body against the elevator and stared impassively at the two of them.

His son or not, the kid was funny. A sarcastic little bastard for sure, but funny as hell.

“Tony… this might be the real deal,” Happy said, his voice dropped to a whisper while he kept his eyes stubbornly trained on the kid. “He- he looks a hell of a lot like you.”

“Happy, did you just call a fourteen year old incredibly handsome and supremely good looking? That’s weird. Seriously, you should seek therapy, I’m not employing a pedophile.” Tony clapped Happy on the shoulder with a grin and then stuck his hands in his pockets and went to go test this kid’s blood.

 

Which was problem number one, apparently.

The kid rode in a sullen silence from the lobby up to the lab. He glared at Tony’s cheery face and his whistling tune though, causing Tony to grin all the harder when he thought of his own teenage mood swings.

Then they reached the lab and Tony finally saw a spark of interest in the kid’s eyes when he looked around the room.

“You’re a scientist, or something?” The kid picked up a beaker at random and squinted at the clear fluid filling it.

Tony chuckled as he grabbed a pair of gloves and a needle to draw the blood. “You never heard of me before coming here?” he asked skeptically.

“Have you heard of me?” The kid sat in a high-backed swivel chair and stretched his legs out in front of himself.

Tony grinned, “Hard telling, since you won’t tell me your name.“

“Confirm that you’re my biological father and maybe I will,” the kid countered with.

Tony laughed and moved to take the chair next to him, easily sliding along the table. “Keep the attitude up and the rest is about to be moot,” he joked.

Emphasis on joked. The kid suddenly ducking his head didn’t make a damn bit of sense, but not much about him did so far.

“Gonna have to pop that jacket off, champ,” Tony said to the kid as he pulled his gloves on.

The kid blanched at the needle Tony held up and rolled his chair further away. “Siri— someone told me you can test hair,” he said, a tremor in his voice that hadn’t been there before. “Do that.”

“It isn’t as accurate,” Tony said. He watched the kid curiously. “Do you not want to take the hoodie off or do you not want me to take your blood?”

“Both,” the kid said with an obviously forced sneer. “Maybe you missed it, but we look alike. Can you not just test the hair and be done with it?”

Tony could. He didn’t even really need to run a test. If he asked Jarvis, Jarvis would probably confirm that Tony had been in London about nine months before this little Tony Stark Junior came to life. So, yeah, he could just yank a few hairs, test them, confirm what already seemed obvious…

But this seemed more fun.

“How do I know that’s not a wig?” Tony asked the kid gravely.

The kid didn’t look amused. “Why the hell would I be wearing a bloody wig?”

“A wig made of my stolen hair to trick me into believing you’re my son,” Tony said, grinning now to show the defensive kid that he was just joking around.

The kid didn’t laugh, but the rigidity of his shoulders relaxed the slightest amount. “Why would I go through that much effort to pretend we’re related?”

Tony shrugged. “Money? Fame? To irritate the Avengers?”

All valid, but probably none in this scenario.

The kid scoffed again. “I don’t need money, I don’t want to be famous, and I don’t know what an avenger is, but if you try and steal my blood then I’ll do a hell of a lot worse than irritate you.”

Tony grinned as he looked the kid over. He was prickly and defensive, but looked like hell with the huge bruise, the bags under his eyes, and the way he held himself so stiffly.

Actually, the fact he looked like hell wiped the smile off Tony’s face.

“You tired?” he asked him. “Hungry? Want a snack or a drink or something?”

For whatever reason, the kid looked even more suspicious of the innocent questions. “Why?”

“Because you look like shit and even if you’re fourteen, which I’m pretty sure is a load of crap, then you’re still a kid and I can have food here in an instant.”

“I don’t want your food, I just want you to run the test and confirm the results,” the kid said tightly, his jaw clenched as tightly as his fists were on his lap. “Please, can you just do it with my hair?”

“Since you said please,” Tony said lightly. The kid was an asshole, but Tony liked him. He reminded him of… well… him. Tony got to his feet and moved over to the kid. “Should I yank out your hair or do you want to do it?”

The kid kept his eyes on Tony’s hands while he reached up to his own head and yanked out a handful of hair. He dropped them in Tony’s outstretched hands, crossed his arms, and glared defiantly at him while Tony moved over to his equipment.

 

Tony didn’t particularly like kids, never really considered having kids, but he liked this kid. He was a witty kid, and Tony suspected there was quite a bit more to him beneath the harsh exterior he seemed to be forcing.

This kid though… probably just because Tony instinctually knew that he wasn’t lying about their connection, but Tony liked this kid.

And by god were the others who lived in Stark Tower going to like him.

Tony was smiling to himself, imagining having this crass kid meet the prudish Captain America, when the machine beeped and the results popped up on the computer screen.

“Fuck me,” Tony whispered. He stared down at the results and almost ran them again. He didn’t though, there was really no need to do it the first time. The results were correct. And of course they were, the damn kid looked just like him.

Tony looked from the screen in front of him into the bruised green eyes of his son.

“It’s a match,” Tony said. He cleared his throat and straightened up at the same time as the kid got to his feet and stepped a little closer. Tony looked the kid over from top to bottom and held back a grimace at the skinniness, the bruises, the wary look in his eyes and the tightness in his muscles.

This didn’t look like the best news the kid ever heard, and suddenly it felt a lot like something Tony liked to avoid at all costs:

Responsibility.

“You’re… you’re my son,” Tony told him. He wasn’t really sure what the situation called for, but he stuck his hand out once more and catalogued the minor flinch in the kid’s arms as he did. “I’m going to introduce myself again,” he grinned crookedly, sheepish now about the way he’d handled the whole interaction so far. “Tony Stark, I’m your dad.”

It sounded so foreign, but… but something in Tony lit up with saying it.

He was going to be a terrible parent, he just knew it, but damn if he wasn’t a little excited to give it a go.

At least he got to skip the diaper stage and get straight to sullen silences, anyway.

The kid twisted his lips and very quickly, blink and you’d miss it, grabbed his hand and immediately dropped it. “Harry… Harry Evans,” he said, his eyes flicking away as he said his name. He stuck his chin out and then narrowed those green eyes directly at Tony, “And I don’t need a dad, I need a favor.”

Chapter Text

“How much?”

“How much what?” Harry asked.

The man, Tony, his father, grinned wryly and ran a hand through his hair. “How much money do you want?”

Harry reeled back, shocked and a bit insulted. “I don’t want your money,” he said. He’d have to be an idiot to not notice that this man was loaded, but so was Harry and so was Sirius. They didn’t need money from him, they needed help.

“My friend said you were smart,” Harry said slowly. He glanced around the lab they stood in and nodded to himself, obviously this guy was brilliant. “We, my friend and I, are in a bit of a jam…” Harry was the one grinning wryly now, a jam was a rather small way to describe their problems.

“A jam, huh?” Tony said. He looked Harry’s face over carefully with the same sort of xray vision that Harry felt like Snape had. “What friend, what kind of jam, and why did you think I could help?”

“A good friend, a bad jam, and because my friend said so,” Harry snapped.

Truthfully, he had no idea why Sirius insisted that Tony Stark was the only one who could help them. He also had no idea why Sirius wouldn’t come with him- it wasn’t like they knew who he was in the States.

Harry Potter? Sure. Apparently Harry was famous in more than one country, but Sirius Black? No.

But Sirius had been adamant, and, as he’d been the one with the escape plans, Harry hadn’t stopped to question him.

~~~~~

Harry had only been at the Dursley house for a week, but it had been the worst week he’d ever spent there in his opinion.

Everything hurt.

His head. His heart. His body.

His emotions felt overwhelming and Harry was ready to break.

Harry had been laying flat on his back in his bare room, staring lifelessly up at the ceiling—

‘Kill the spare!’

‘Take the cup and go!’

‘Bring my body back to my parents.’

“Harry?”

Harry was so startled by the familiar voice that he flipped off his bed and then hissed through his teeth at the painful jolting motion. He scrambled to the door and tried to look through the crack at the bottom.

“Sirius?” he whispered, hope and dread filling him.

Hope that it was his godfather, as it sounded like.

Dread that it was his godfather, as it sounded like.

“Back up,” Sirius whispered back. He sounded hoarse, but with the thrum of excitement in his voice that he always had.

“Don’t—”

Harry no sooner than whispered the word before his door was kicked open with a loud bang. The hard wood swung back and hit Harry in the face, bloodying his nose.

“Shit!” Sirius ducked down to the floor and pried Harry’s hands away from his face. “I’m sorry, kiddo, I- Harry, what the fuck happened to you?!”

Harry wrenched himself from Sirius’ grasp and backed away to sit on the edge of his bed. He turned his head a little, angling to keep the worst of the facial bruises hidden in the shadows, and swiped at his sore nose with the bottom hem of the baggy grey shirt he wore.

“What are you doing here?” Harry asked harshly, always pushing before he was pushed.

Sirius rocked back on the heels of his feet, staring at Harry intensely and causing Harry’s scowl to deepen.

“You first, I think,” Sirius said slowly. He looked around Harry’s bedroom and Harry was suddenly glad for the darkness to hide the lack of detail and the abundance of misery etched in the room.

“You broke in my bedroom, you first,” Harry snapped. He jumped to his feet and moved to the window. He kept his back to Sirius and kept his head turned just enough to keep him in his line of sight.

Sirius snorted and took Harry’s abandoned spot on his bed. He kept his hands on his thighs and his eyes steady on Harry’s head. “Glad you brought that up, why the fuck did you have seven bloody padlocks on your door?”

“It’s a dangerous neighborhood,” Harry said flatly.

“They were locking you in.”

“To keep the neighborhood safe, you see.”

Sirius laughed, but it was bitter and more surprised than amused. “Yeah? Beat yourself up then, kiddo?”

Harry scowled and ducked his head. “What are you doing here?”

“Checking on my godson since he hasn’t wrote me any letters assuring me of his excellent health, clearly,” Sirius drawled.

Harry grinned and shook his head. Sirius was a prat, but he was Harry’s favorite prat. Harry turned a little and leaned against the wall, carefully keeping his head turned away from Sirius. “Yeah?” Harry feigned surprise. “That’s mad, Sirius. Except, I bet if your godson had gotten a single bloody letter from his godfather, he probably would have replied.”

Sirius dropped the act and he blinked quickly at Harry. “Not getting my letters? Harry, I’ve sent you a dozen!”

Harry raised a skeptical brow. “I’ve been here eight days.”

“And I’ve been worried about you for fourteen years,” Sirius countered with. He pinched his brows together and scowled at the floor, “You didn’t get a single letter?”

Harry shrugged, ignoring the pain as he did so, “Nope.”

Sirius growled and lifted his head to stare harshly at Harry. “And the bruises?”

“You did hit me with a door,” Harry said drily. “Suppose it could have happened then.”

“Cut the cute crap, Harry,” Sirius said, his tone serious and fed up now. “What happened?”

Harry frowned and inched backward, Sirius rarely lost his temper, but it was always dramatic when he did. “Same shit as always, Sirius. ‘Welcome home, go fuck yourself.’”

Harry didn’t have to explain past that, not to Sirius, not again. The two of them had shared more than enough conversations over Sirius’ enchanted mirrors during the course of Harry’s fourth year. Sirius was Harry’s favorite person in the world, he didn’t have to be distant with him and he didn’t have to wear a mask with him.

He still did, usually, but he didn’t have to.

“I’m going to fucking kill them,” Sirius growled. He jumped to his feet and flicked his wand in his hand in an instant. He looked torn for a moment, glancing between Harry and the door.

Harry quirked his lips in a wry smirk. “I think if you choose revenge over me one more time then my feelings might get hurt here.”

Sirius bared his teeth and ran his empty hand through his hair, tugging harshly at the black locks. “I can use a knife, no magic, no Azkaban?” he offered.

Harry relaxed a little, if Sirius was talking then he was thinking. “Good idea,” he said. “I’ll write to you from prison when they arrest me for the crime.”

Sirius smiled, an empty and joyless smile, and sank back on Harry’s bed. “It is my turn to frame someone else for a crime,” he joked weakly.

Harry gave him a soft chuckle for his effort. “They’re gone anyway,” he said, glancing out the window and down in the empty driveway. “Our definitely not premeditated murder will have to wait.”

“Excellent. Let’s plan our definitely premeditated escapes then, huh?”

~~~~~

Sirius was a mad bastard, but he had been correct, Tony Stark was Harry’s biological father.

Maybe he underestimated Harry’s ability to get the man’s assistance though.

“So a good friend needs your help to get out of a bad jam?” Tony asked Harry. “And this same good friend just happened to know that you were my son, something I didn’t even know?”

“Yes,” Harry said coolly. He was so on edge. He was tired, he was hungry, he was sore, he just found out twelve hours ago that he wasn’t an orphan. He was ready to snap and he didn’t want to do it in front of this man. “Feel free to run the test again,” Harry waved his hand at the machine that made Tony believe the story, “but then I’d still like to ask for that favor and I’d rather not do it with a bald spot.”

Tony, inexplicably, grinned. “Can I hear the favor over a hot meal? I’m so hungry that, I’m not kidding, that microscope is starting to look tasty.”

Harry rolled his eyes and weighed his options.

Oh. That’s right. He didn’t have any.

“Fine,” Harry sighed. He backed away from the doorway when it looked like that was the direction Tony was headed. He forced himself to keep his head up, refusing to drop it in front of this man. He didn’t care what Sirius said about Tony Stark partying with him and his parents ‘back in the day’, Tony Stark was a wild card and Harry didn’t know how to play him yet.

“What kind of food do you like?” Tony asked Harry over his shoulder as he led him back toward the lift. “Chinese? Italian? Sushi? I’m an excellent chef, Harry. You just name it, and I’ll order it.” He grinned at Harry, apparently pleased with his joke.

Harry blinked away the surprise that wanted to appear on his face. Apparently Tony had meant they would be sharing a hot meal.

“Whatever is fine,” Harry mumbled as he inched around Tony into the lift.

“Any allergies? Food you hate? Food that transform you into a ten foot tall green giant monster?”

Harry picked his head up to give Tony a curious look. “Mushrooms,” he quipped sarcastically. “Except I turn purple, not green.”

Tony threw his head back and roared with laughter. “No mushrooms then,” he said once he controlled himself.

Harry’s hand tensed every time he said something that would have gotten a backhand, at a minimum, from his relatives, but Tony seemed determined to find every single line Harry fed him hilarious.

It was infuriating.

Harry lived for the the tiny adrenaline rush he got every time he put himself in a ‘risky situation’. It made him feel alive, it took away his endless apathy.

Flamel’s stone was in trouble? Time to go save it.

Ginny was in a chamber with a basilisk? Harry would help.

Confront a mass murderer, a werewolf, and a hundred dementors? Absolutely.

Those were the times Harry was awake.

Sirius called him an adrenaline junky, Harry told him it took one to know one. The two of them were a lot alike, and Harry would do anything for him.

Even apparently sit through dinner with Tony and ask him for help.

The lift went up and let out a ding when it reached the top floor.

Harry almost raised his brows at the posh and technology filled flat the lift doors opened to, but he caught himself last moment. He could see why the guy thought Harry was after his money.

“Nice place,” Harry said neutrally as they moved through a huge foyer into an even larger sitting room. There was a telly covering an entire wall and a wall of glass windows directly across from it.

“It’s not much, but it’s home,” Tony winked, causing Harry to scoff softly as he unintentionally quoted something Ron once said to him.

“Hey, Jarvis.”

“Yes, Mister Stark?”

Harry twitched harshly at the disembodied voice that floated through the room. He spun around, trying to find its owner, but found no one aside from Tony in the room.

Tony grinned at Harry again and strolled over to the massive fridge in the kitchen set off along the fourth wall in the room. “Jarvis is my assistant,” he called, even though Harry didn’t ask him to explain. He popped the fridge open and browsed the contents for a moment. “I’ll give you a beer if you tell me how old you really are.”

Harry lost his curiosity about Jarvis in the face of the insult. “I said I’m fourteen, I’m not lying,” he insisted. He followed Tony toward the kitchen then hesitated next to one of the tall stools at a bar-style countertop. “I’m short, not stupid, I know my age.”

Tony chuckled again and pulled out two cans of soda, he put one on the bar counter, apparently for Harry, and gestured for him to take a seat. “No son of mine could have an IQ less than 100,” he boasted.

“Sure,” Harry drawled. He gingerly sat on the edge of the barstool, though he casually scooted down one when Tony took the seat directly beside him. Harry cracked open the can, mimicking Tony’s actions, while Tony called for Jarvis again.

His… his disembodied voice possible robot or magical assistant.

Sirius swore Tony was a muggle, but Harry was skeptical.

“Can you order us…” Tony stared thoughtfully at Harry for a moment. “Two large meat lovers pizzas, an order of breadsticks, and one of those brookie desserts from that place I like?”

“Of course, Mister Stark. It will arrive shortly.”

“You eat a lot,” Harry said, quite rudely. He was so damn on edge though that he’d almost take a quick brawl to ease his nerves.

Tony grinned again and guzzled half his drink. “And you’re a damn smartass,” he said. It was a statement that would precede a smack from Uncle Vernon, but Tony said it… fondly?

“What’s your mom’s name, anyway?”

Harry stiffened in his seat. “Can’t remember the name of every woman you shagged?” he sneered defensively.

“Nope.” Tony shrugged and plunked his elbow on the bar before resting his head in his hand and watching Harry curiously. “Where is she?”

“Dead.”

“Oh.” Tony’s eyes went soft and it put Harry further on the defense. “I’m sorry, kid, that’s rough.”

Harry didn’t have a reply to that, so he chose not to reply. He held Tony’s sympathetic eyes as long as he could, which admittedly was not all that long, before dropping his eyes to his lap.

“What was her name?”

Harry’s voice was soft, wistful, “Lily.”

“Not…” Tony abruptly sat up and his jerky motion had Harry quickly picking his head back up. “Not Lily Potter?”

Harry…

Harry had never said his last name was Potter.

“Maybe,” Harry said slowly. He watched as Tony’s eyes widened in surprise. “You do remember her then?”

“I remember spending about a week with Lily, James, and a few of their friends in London around the right time, yeah,” Tony said. His eyes were still surprised, but there was a soft smile on his face now. Nostalgic, maybe.

And considering he was feeling nostalgic about a week he spent partying with Harry’s parents, during which time Harry was conceived, it was pretty bloody disturbing.

“How- where’s James?” Tony asked Harry after shaking the smile off his face and frowning suddenly.

“Also dead,” Harry said shortly.

“Jesus Christ.” Tony rubbed a hand over his face and groaned. “I’m sorry, kid. I guess I probably missed my chance to send flowers to the funeral, huh?”

Harry snorted. “Almost fourteen years too late for that,” he said.

Tony’s look of sympathy and surprise flickered quickly. “They’ve been dead for over ten years?” he repeated. “Who do you live with?”

“Suppose that’s not your business,” Harry said carefully, all his muscles tensing up. “Unless you want to help me out?”

“Anything, kid. You name it.”

Harry held back from smiling at the earnest way Tony offered that. “I fake need ID’s, passports, birth certificates, social security cards, and plane tickets for me and my friend.” Harry smiled blandly at Tony, “If you can help me and my friend get a place in Russia, I’ll even give you my address.”

Tony’s jaw dropped at Harry’s request. “You… you came here, told me I have a son, and you want to move to Russia?”

“Yes,” Harry nodded.

“Why?!”

“They don’t extradite to the UK,” Harry said glibly, hiding the truth behind sarcasm.

“But…” Tony ran a hand through his hair, messing up the styled dark locks into something more similar to Harry’s. “What the fuck?” he blurted, looking hard at Harry now. “You traveled here from London to ask me to get you and a friend some super illegal paperwork so you can run off to Russia?”

“Yup.”

“Why?!” Tony threw his hands in the air and Harry relished the tiny spark of life that his aggravation gave him. “You could have came to someone- anyone else. Why come tell me I have a kid only to rush off and leave?”

“Sorry to break your fantasies of father son bonding, but I’m only here to ask if you’ll help,” Harry said. “My friend told me you were the best. And we are in—”

“A bad jam,” Tony repeated Harry’s words from earlier. He pointed a finger at Harry, sending Harry scooting back in his seat a bit. “You want me to break the law for you and you won’t even tell me what you’re running from.”

“I’m sitting, actually,” Harry said. He took a sip of his soda in a stab at appearing perfectly at ease, but the liquid sloshed in the can as Harry’s hand shook. He quickly sat the can back down and tucked his hands beneath his legs. Tony’s eyes tracked the movement, and Harry dared him to comment on it with his eyes.

Tony didn’t, surprisingly. He lifted his eyes to the ceiling and mumbled something to himself that Harry couldn’t catch.

“Mister Stark, your order has arrived.”

Tony groaned again at Jarvis’ announcement. He slowly stood up and pointed at Harry again, causing Harry to narrow his eyes irritably.

“If I go grab our food, are you going to disappear before I get back?”

“If you stick your finger in my face again then I’m going to burn this building to the ground and you’ll wish I had simply disappeared,” Harry sneered. He wasn’t suicidal, necessarily, he wouldn’t bat his hand out of his face, but he’d rather not have him that close either.

Tony almost immediately dropped his hand, and he shook his head fondly. “That chair was an innocent bystander. It never meant you any harm.” He gave Harry a smile and his eyes looked like they were hopeful, “I’ll be back in a jiff, don’t disappear because I’ll spend the rest of my life tracking you down and you’ll never know a moment of rest.”

Tony turned and all but jogged to the lift doors, as if worried that Harry would disappear while he went to get food.

“That chair was a menace and you should be thanking me for getting rid of the bloody thing!” Harry called to him just before the lift doors closed.

Tony laughed again, leaving Harry perplexed.

Harry closed his eyes and let his forehead smack on the bar counter. Not for the first time, he desperately wished Sirius had came with him.

~~~~~

“Can’t you come with me?” Harry whispered to his godfather desperately. The two of them were standing in the lobby of the airport and Harry had a sudden desperate desire to drag Sirius on the plane with him.

“Planes are fun, don’t be worried,” Sirius assured Harry quietly, purposefully ignoring the true source of Harry’s anxiety. “You’ll like flying. And someone needs to stay to keep You-Know-Who and You-Know-Who off your trail.”

Harry scoffed and looked around at the crowds and the noise and the lines. He was more anxious about this part of the plan than he was about Voldemort or Dumbledore finding him. Harry never been on a plane before, never even stepped foot in an airport.

The Dursley’s certainly never took him on holiday, and wizards had no need for him. The latter of the two being the reason Sirius decided it was the safest way to get Harry to America without getting caught.

“What if he won’t help?” Harry asked Sirius quietly, his eyes on his scuffy trainers. “What if…”

“Hey.” Sirius put a hand on Harry’s shoulder and they both ignored the flinch it caused. “Tony Stark’s a good guy, kiddo. He’s- he’s going to love you, I just know it. I bet he’ll be thrilled to find out he’s got such a brilliant son.”

Harry scoffed and kicked at the floor. “He’s not my dad,” he told Sirius, though he spoke to the floor. “Blood doesn’t make family,” he peeked up at Sirius through his fringe, “right?”

Even under Polyjuice, the smile looked like Sirius. “Right,” he agreed. “Blood doesn’t make family, but love does, kiddo, and he’s going to love you.”

“I’m coming right back for you,” Harry said stubbornly, finally lifting his head up to glare at his godfather. “Quit acting like I’m not. You promised, Snuffles, you said we’d do this together.”

“And we are,” Sirius said quickly. “You should just do this part by yourself. Give him a chance to get to know you before you go dragging me into the mess.”

Harry clenched his jaw. He had no intention of getting to know Tony Stark. He was going to ask for help then leave.

That was that.

“And you really can’t come?” Harry asked Sirius one more time.

“This part is just you,” Sirius said. He gave Harry a gentle push toward the security line. “Knock ‘em dead, kiddo. Don’t forget to write.”

Harry grimaced and then forced himself to relax. “Don’t kill any muggles while I’m gone, alright? Twelve was plenty.”

Sirius’ laugh followed Harry through the security line while he desperately wished his godfather would accompany him the entire time.

~~~~~

Harry and Tony ate in near utter silence.

The pizza was good, but Harry was so on edge he could hardly eat more than a few bites.

The ‘brookie’ was amazing though and Harry ate over half of his piece of that.

Tony waited until Harry pushed his plate away from himself to clear his throat and start the interrogation Harry knew was coming.

“I’d need names for the papers,” he said, immediately knocking Harry off-kilter.

“What?” Harry gaped at him and then caught himself and tried to clear the shock off his face. “You’ll do it? You’ll help me?”

“On two conditions.”

Of course.

Nothing came for free.

“What?” Harry sighed.

Tony fidgeted in his seat, and Harry got the impression he wasn’t a man who fidgeted very often.

“One, I’ll need some time to get the documents you need, and I want you to stay here until I get them,” Tony said, sounding rather stern. “It isn’t safe for Tony Stark’s son to go roaming around New York.”

Harry let a bitter smile show; it wasn’t safe to be related to Harry Potter, full stop. “And the second?”

“And… and I’d like it if you kept in contact.”

Harry twisted his lips to the side thoughtfully. Sirius didn’t even know Harry planned on asking for help right off the bat, he thought Harry would ‘let Tony get to know him’ before bringing up any of their problems. So waiting a few days wasn’t an issue, and it wasn’t as if Harry had a place to stay outside of Tony’s obviously roomy flat anyway.

Keeping in contact though? That didn’t exactly scream ‘distant and don’t care’. That whispered ‘attachment’ and attachments were dangerous.

“I can pay you to stay here, and for the papers,” Harry offered instead. “You’ll have to wait until I can get the money from my account though.”

Because Sirius, in all his infinite wisdom, only sent Harry with just enough muggle money to buy a drink on the plane and a taxi from the New York airport to Stark Towers. Harry would have gotten his own money, but since Sirius bought him the next available plane ticket, he didn’t have time to get to Gringotts and back.

“And we can exchange Christmas cards.”

Tony snorted and sent a pointed look around the flat. “Do I look like I need the money?”

Honestly? No. But Harry didn’t like being in his debt either.

“Do I?” Harry asked defiantly.

Tony glanced at his ratty and overly large clothes, but didn’t comment. “I’m supposedly fourteen years behind on child support, don’t worry about it.” He waved his hand airily. “Those are my conditions, kid, take ‘em or leave ‘em.”

“If I leave them?”

Tony grinned and laced his fingers behind his head. “Then I get one of my lazy ass overpaid lawyers to get custody of you established tonight and you move in anyway.”

“I’ll take the conditions,” Harry said quickly, not doubting the determined glint in the man’s eyes that mimicked Harry’s own determination. He couldn’t risk getting stuck there forever, not while Sirius was counting on him. Harry slowly held his hand out to Tony, “Deal?”

“And if you like it here, you stay forever and we try that father son bonding you mentioned earlier,” Tony said in a rush before smiling widely at Harry and grasping his hand. “Deal.”

Chapter Text

Tony gave Harry a winning smile as they toured the top floor of the tower. What had once been Tony’s living space and the Avengers unofficial hangout, was now Tony and his son’s place.

‘Temporarily’.

Unless Tony could convince Harry to stay.

They’d already seen almost everything, but Tony paused dramatically before flinging open the door to the second bedroom on the floor.

“And this is the best room in the place,” he told Harry. He flapped his hand toward the bedroom, indicating that Harry go inside.

“Oh yeah?” Harry slowly stepped inside and looked around the room. It was a nice room, in Tony’s entirely humble opinion. The bedroom faced the west side of the building and that wall was made of the same reinforced glass that the living room was. The other walls were white, like the rest of the tower, and there was a spacious bed in the middle of the floor. The closets and tech were all just as excessive and necessary as every other room.

“Why’s it so special?” Harry asked after he peeked in one of the doors and found the attached bathroom.

“This is where my son sleeps,” Tony said. He leaned against the doorway and grinned at the quick look of surprise on Harry’s face. “He’s a nice kid, you’d hate him. He’s all sweet smiles and ‘Golly, I love you, dad’.”

Harry suddenly glowered, driving a stark contrast between Tony’s description and the truth. “He sounds like a prat,” Harry said.

“Very boring too,” Tony agreed with a wink.

“You’d turn on your own son like that?” Harry asked, now sporting a wide-eyed look of innocence on his face that didn’t suit him anymore than it had ever suited Tony. “Bit of a shit parent, aren’t you?”

Since this was a joke, Tony absolutely wasn’t offended.

“Well I’m new to it,” Tony said lightly. “Cause here’s the thing, kid, I’ve never been a parent before, and I might suck at it at first, but I’ve never really been bad at anything in my life, so I’m sure by the end of the day tomorrow I’ll be a pro.”

Harry’s eyes, the ones he definitely inherited from Lily Potter now that Tony bothered remembering her, narrowed into what Tony was beginning to see what a semi-permanent suspicious scowl. “A whole day to become a pro? Can’t you do it immediately?”

Tony didn’t remember a whole lot about his week in London, he’d probably never have remembered Lily or James Potter in general if Harry hadn’t been glaring at him with Lily Potter’s distinct eyes when he first said her name, but Tony was still pretty sure that Harry got his sarcastic sense of humor from him and not her.

“Even brilliant men, pioneers in their field with incomprehensible IQ levels and good looks to match, need time to read ‘How to Parent Your Teenage Son You Didn’t Know You Had’,” Tony joked.

Unless that was really a book option.

“You don’t have to parent anyone,” Harry said with a quick sneer. “You agreed to get the paperwork I need and then we can be long distance penpals.”

“What about when you write to me, ‘Dear Dad, I’ve got my first crush, what do I do? Love, your doting son’?”

Success.

It wasn’t a full smile, but it was at least a more friendly look than Tony had gotten so far from the kid.

“‘Dear Son, send security after them, that’s how I win people over’,” Harry said with that same tiny grin.

If a game of witty banter made Harry quit staring at him like he was his enemy, then Tony could do it all day. Hell, he never had anyone to talk with like this.

“‘Dear handsome and brilliant father of mine, I tried setting her house on fire, but she’s still resistant to my charms’.”

“‘Dear Son, nobody can resist your charm work, keep trying’.”

“‘Dear—’”

“Mister Stark, Miss Potts is calling.”

Tony sighed and rolled his eyes. “To be continued,” he told Harry. He gestured to the bathroom that Harry had already peeked in, “Feel free to get comfortable, kid. Shower, change, sing soulful tunes about your broken heart, whatever it is that teenagers do in the bathroom.”

Harry raised a brow at him, but he jerked his chin in a nod.

The smile was gone though. Damn Pepper for the worst possible timing.

“Jarvis, send everything you can find about Harry Evans or Harry Potter to my mobile. Roughly fourteen years old, run facial recognition if there’s too many of them,” Tony murmured as soon as he stepped in his home office and the door was safely closed. “Also, everything on Lily and James Potter.”

All Tony remembered about Lily and James Potter had been that they were young, attractive, a shit ton of fun in the local bar he’d been in, and James had hit on Tony before Tony even had a chance to hit on his pretty wife.

Once Harry sparked his memory though, Tony remembered spending a week with the couple. They drank with their friends, they toured the city together, and Tony had slept with both of them multiple times.

Now that he considered it, it wasn’t really all that surprising that he’d fathered Harry that week. It had been a wild time.

He imagined that the world was a little darker without the young, happy, lively couple in it.

“Yes, sir,” Jarvis said, breaking Tony’s fond memories. “I’m also patching Miss Potts through now.”

“Hey, Pepper, how’s the chocolate?”

It was an old joke, Tony asked her the same thing every time she went to Sweden. Correctly, she didn’t laugh at all.

“What’s wrong?” she asked instead.

How the hell did she do that?

“Wrong? Nothing’s wrong,” Tony said casually. And nothing was wrong, not really. Sure he had to convince his supposedly orphaned son to stick around and give Tony a chance to get to know him, but Tony had that handled.

He’d find out what kind of crime his son committed, hide all evidence of the crime ever happening, convince the kid to give him a chance, then keep him forever.

It was one of his best plans, really.

“Tony…” Pepper sighed. “What the hell did you do?”

“Currently? Nothing. Hey, I have a surprise for you when you get back.” Tony sat in his chair and spun around. “How do you like your future stepkids? Blonde, red head, or the spitting image of their father?”

Pepper sounded like she choked on something, probably the same air that Tony choked on when he actually read the results. He doubted if it was the ‘stepkids’ reference, he’d been hitting on Pepper for years without any results.

“What?! Tony, you’re joking?!”

Tony put a hand over his chest. “I never joke, Miss Potts. He really will be your stepson one day, as soon as you stop denying your painful, and rather embarrassing really, crush on me.”

“I’m coming home,” Pepper said, Tony didn’t have to be there to picture the exasperation on her face. “I knew this day would come, I just knew it.”

“Then you’re a hell of a psychic because I did not,” Tony grinned. “See you in a few days, Miss Potts?”

“See you then, Tony.”

Tony was grinning and whistling to himself as he disconnected with Pepper and pulled up the files Jarvis sent him.

He quit whistling pretty damn quick.

“Jarvis, what the hell?” Tony snapped. He clicked through the sparse folder quickly. Three birth certificates- James F. Potter, Lily R. Evans, Harry J. Potter (he knew the kid was lying when he said his last name). Two death certificates- James Potter, cause of death, car accident, Lily Potter, cause of death, car accident. One guardianship form for Harry J. Potter to Petunia P. Dursley. Five years worth of school reports for Harry.

That was it.

Harry never made it to school the fall after he turned eleven. Until now, it was as if Harry Potter had disappeared off the face of the earth.

“That is all I could find, sir. Would you like the files on Petunia Dursley?”

Tony sighed and shook his head at the computer screen. “Yeah.”

Petunia Dursley, formerly Petunia Evans, had a lot more information than Tony’s son had.

Married to Vernon Dursley, a drill salesman for a company that Tony vaguely recalled making some orders from. Mother of Dudley Dursley, one year older than Harry. Petunia was a homemaker and had been in the local papers with her family for various activities over the years.

Her family minus Harry, who didn’t appear in a single photograph that was published.

“What the hell?” Tony whispered to himself. Harry just… just barely existed. There were homeless guys who left more of a paper trail than Harry Potter did. There wasn’t even record of him boarding an international flight.

“This Petunia is still alive?” Tony asked Jarvis as he had a quick thought. He clicked through the documents again after Jarvis confirmed it. “Then why isn’t there a missing persons report?”

Harry was clearly a kid on the run. A desperate kid on the run, really.

“Jarvis, send her contact information to my cell,” Tony said. He got up and stretched his arms over his head. “I’m going to give her a call, see what she’s got to say.”

He also needed to get her to sign over her rights. He’d get them from her either way, but if he could keep it quiet and out of the courts, then all the safer for Harry.

“Very good, sir, Petunia Dursley’s information has been sent. May I remind you that it is currently 12:15 in the morning in Little Whining, Surrey?”

Tony checked his watch and grimaced. “Suppose that’s too early for a wake up call then?”

“Yes, sir.”

Tony nodded. He’d just call her in the morning then.

In the meantime, maybe he could get some answers from Harry.

He kind of doubted it, the kid was evasive and prickly and defensive, but Tony was nothing if not determined.

Tony strolled from his office towards the room he gave Harry. He’d just knock, ask him if he wanted to watch TV or something, and then he’d casually ask about his life. Maybe tell him about his too, especially since supposedly the kid didn’t know anything about the Avengers.

Not a single one of his references seemed to hit home, but Tony doubted if there was a person on the earth who didn’t see footage of the alien attack in May.

Tony knocked lightly on Harry’s door then silently opened it when he got no response. He poked his head in, then paused at what he saw.

Harry was sprawled out on his bed, his soaking wet hair leaving a dark mark on the comforter that he slept on top off. Tony nearly smacked himself in the face when he saw that Harry had on the same hoodie and jeans he showed up in— he’d suggested the kid take a shower and never even thought about the fact he wasn’t carrying a backpack of some sort with him.

The kid traveled from London to New York, without a valid passport apparently, and didn’t even bring a change of clothes.

Whatever he and his friend were running from, they were clearly pretty damn desperate.

But… Tony took a step further in the room and felt his mouth curl upward into a smile. Harry didn’t look like a sarcastic kid who was always ready for a fight when he slept, he just looked like a kid. With his face lax and his eyelashes brushing his face, he looked like a cute kid, probably even cuter without the damn bruise marking his face.

His kid.

And since Tony planned on convincing him to stay forever, he had plenty of time to get answers. He’d start in the morning, of course, but for now he slipped silently out of Harry’s room and closed the door softly.

Tomorrow then.

***

Tony stumbled out of his room the next morning, his nose following the scent of coffee and his ears following the loud sound of laughter and conversation.

“Finally,” Clint said when Tony stepped into the kitchen dining area they had, “Sleeping Beauty has risen from her sleep.”

“I’m not so sure about that,” Tony mumbled. He poured a cup of coffee and drank it straight from the mug without sugar or cream. It had been a long night of questions without answers and staring at a ceiling and not sleeping.

“You look like shit,” Clint snorted, ever the charmer. “Bad night?”

Tony turned and grinned at his teammates, his friends, over the top of his cup of coffee. “Great night, actually. Stark stock rose, I didn’t develop any grey hairs, I’ve got a son, and Pepper will be home in a few days.” Tony took a sip of his coffee with a pleased smirk as Clint sputtered out a bite of his eggs, Steve’s jaw nearly hit the table, and Bruce’s eyes bulged from his face.

“Repeat that,” Steve said, the first to recover from his shock.

“Gladly. Stark stock rose, it’s never been higher, really. I think I might end up rich.”

“You have a son?!” Bruce yelled. “Jesus Christ, Tony. Are you sure?”

“99.99%,” Tony said. He stretched his neck up and saw that Harry’s door was still closed. “And if you don’t keep your voice down, you’re going to wake him up.”

The three Avengers’ heads spun almost as one to gawk at the closed door.

“There’s a kid inside there?” Clint whispered. He turned back and narrowed his eyes at Tony. “Is this a joke?”

“What would the punchline be?” Tony asked him curiously. He rolled his eyes when none of the others seemed to be in the mood to banter. “Yes, there’s a kid in there. Yes, it’s my kid. Yes, he did inherit my stunning good looks and probably my brains as well.”

And since that didn’t seem to appease them either, Tony hopped up on the counter, as close to his coffee maker as he could get, and filled them in on what they missed while they were gone.

When he was done, Bruce was rubbing his chin thoughtfully, Steve was staring hard at Harry’s still closed bedroom door, and Clint had his head on the table and his hands linked on the back of it.

“What’s in Russia?” Bruce finally asked when the silence started to bother Tony.

“They don’t extradite to the UK,” Tony chuckled. He knew Harry said it sarcastically, but he didn’t doubt that that was precisely why he wanted to go there. And, since Harry Potter was already a legal nobody, Tony had to assume it was his friend who was on the run from the law.

“You’re not really going to get him those documents, are you?” Steve asked Tony incredulously. “He’s fourteen, Tony, he needs a parent, not an escape plan.”

“But Captaaaain,” Tony whined, “all the other kids have a parent and an escape plan!”

Steve didn’t look impressed, he looked annoyed, which was fair because Tony had been trying to annoy him.

“I told him I would, and I will, eventually,” Tony shrugged. He could have documents so good they’d never be questioned within minutes if he wanted, he just… didn’t want to. He wanted to try and convince the kid to let him help him in a different way instead.

“You sure he’s even still here?” Clint asked skeptically, lifting his head and squinting suspiciously at Harry’s door. “Aren’t teenagers like… noisy?”

Tony frowned and checked the time. It was nearly nine, and Harry had been asleep since around seven last night.

There weren’t very high odds that Harry had managed to sneak out past all the security measures Tony had on the tower, but…

“Jarvis, is Harry in his room?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Asleep?”

“No, sir. He’s awake.”

Tony raised a brow. “Has he eaten yet?”

“He hasn’t left his room since you put him there last night.”

Steve chuckled. “He’s not out getting into everything? You sure he’s yours, Tony?”

Tony grinned, more of a smirk, really. If Steve wasn’t sure, he would be the moment Harry opened his mouth. “99.99%,” he said again, though truthfully there wasn’t even a 0.01% doubt in his mind. “Hey, Jarvis, tell Harry there’s food out here.”

“Yes, sir.”

Tony kicked the cabinet beneath the heels of his feet as he swung his legs out and waited for Harry’s door to open. The other guys looked wary, but a bit eager, as they all watched the door and waited too.

After a few minutes of silence, Tony called for Jarvis again.

“Did you tell him?”

“Yes, sir.”

“And? Is he coming out?”

Jarvis didn’t sigh, he wasn’t programmed to sigh, but somehow he still sounded like he wanted to. “He is sitting on his bed still, sir. He said ‘thanks, robot bloke’.”

Bruce chuckled, but Tony frowned. The kid barely ate anything last night, probably overly anxious, and that was over twelve hours ago. He had to be hungry, teenagers always were. Hell, Tony was still always hungry.

He sat his mug down beside him and cupped his hands around his mouth to yell in the direction of Harry’s room. “Hey! Favorite son of mine! Breakfast time! Up and at ‘em!”

Personally, Tony didn’t give a damn if the kid wanted to sleep until noon, he looked like he needed the sleep, but he wasn’t sleeping he was supposedly just sitting silently in his room. Plus he also looked like he needed to eat some good meals.

And meet the guys, clearly.

Speaking of which…

“Where’s Natasha?” Tony asked Steve. He’d been so excited to share his news, he hardly noticed the absence of one red-headed member of their team. They were also missing a god, but that was expected.

“She’s at SHIELD, giving report,” Bruce answered for Steve. “Can’t imagine what Fury finds so interesting about training, but—”

Tony shushed him and jumped off the counter when his son’s door opened slowly and Harry’s head poked out.

“I don’t know how to cook,” Harry snapped at him. His hair was a mess and he still looked rough, bags under his eyes and that bruise didn’t miraculously heal overnight. He still had on the same clothes too, and Tony made a mental note to take him shopping after breakfast.

“I don’t either. Do you know how to eat?” Tony asked him deadpan, ignoring the way the guys all spun in their seats to stare at Harry.

Harry did not ignore the guys. Harry’s jaw ticked and he blinked very quickly as he looked the three others over closely.

There wasn’t any recognition at all, not even for the well-known and universally beloved Captain America.

“Good, you have company,” Harry said in his flat and cheeky way, his eyes still roaming quickly. “I’ll just quietly stay in here then, yeah?”

“Wro-ong,” Tony sang. He grinned and gestured to the food one of the guys must have ordered that was spread out on the bar in front of them. “Come eat, meet your uncles.”

Harry’s back stiffened and he was outright glaring at the three men by that point. He took a step out of his room and closed the door very gently.

“Hey, kid,” Steve stood up and offered Harry his hand as he slowly approached them. “Steve Rogers.”

“Harry,” Harry said shortly. He nodded at the guys and moved to the opposite side of the counter, outright ignoring Steve’s hand. “As fun as this looks, I’m afraid I’m not in the market for any new relatives. One surprise parent was enough, you see, so I’ll just grab this,” Harry’s hand snuck out and snatched an apple out of the bowl in front of Clint, “and I’ll stay out of your hair until I leave.”

Tony laughed, the kid’s sarcasm always caught him off guard and amused him in equal measures. “Or you can sit, eat something besides an apple, and let them introduce themselves.”

And never leave, was what Tony silently added.

Harry glanced over at him and Tony saw a quick flash of… something… in his eyes. “I’m not a dog, I don’t sit on command,” he said coolly.

“Do you know any neat tricks though?” Clint asked Harry with a grin.

Harry’s returning smile wasn’t exactly what Tony would call friendly. “A few, but a good magician never reveals his secrets.”

Bruce chuckled quietly and looked between Harry and Tony for a moment. “Man, you two are related, aren’t you?”

“That’s what the machine said,” Harry drawled. He seemed to be inching toward his bedroom door. “Please, feel free to discuss this life changing event amongst yourselves.”

“Let’s discuss it amongst the entire household,” Tony said brightly, his words drawing Harry into an immediate stop.

“Entire household?” Harry asked. He stared at Tony with something like accusation on his face. “How many people live here?”

“One devastatingly handsome man, one heartbreakingly gorgeous woman, one incredibly sarcastic and handsome teenage boy, a very old man, a green monster, an assassin, another assassin, and a god on occasion,” Tony said, ticking his fingers as he went. “So seven full time, eight part time.”

Harry quirked a brow and twisted his lips. “I don’t live here.”

“Did I list a Harry?” Tony blinked innocently.

Harry scoffed and then eyed the guys again. He didn’t move for one of the open stools beside them, but instead grabbed one and drug it to the opposite side of where they sat. “Which is which?”

“Clint Barton,” Clint nodded, “assassin.”

“Bruce Banner, green monster,” Bruce glared at Tony quickly for the insult.

Steve sighed and rolled his eyes before giving Harry his literally trademarked friendly smile. “Steve Rogers, I’m probably the old man.”

Harry toyed with the apple he held as he slowly looked from Steve to Tony with a small smirk on his lips now. “You don’t look old.”

“Looks can be deceiving,” Tony winked at his son. “Bruce hardly looks like he can smash the entire building in a single fit, but I assure you he can.”

“So you’re missing a god, another assassin, and a pretty woman?” Harry asked him. He either thought Tony was joking about Bruce or he didn’t care about the Hulk sitting across from him.

There was a very slim chance that Harry already knew about the Avengers, but Tony didn’t think that was it either. He just seemed indifferent to it all.

Probably because he planned on leaving before it mattered to him…

“And a handsome and sarcastic full-time teenage resident,” Tony nodded. “If you find one, send him my way.”

“Perhaps he’s already came and your security guard sent him packing,” Harry said. He picked at the apple skin with his fingernails in an absent gesture.

“Did security do that to your face?” Steve asked, his ‘defender of the weak’ indignation riling up.

Harry glanced curiously at him. “What’s wrong with my face?”

Tony bit his cheek to keep from laughing.

Steve shook his head and frowned at Harry. “You’re black and blue, kid, looks like a nasty punch or two.”

“You’re bloody joking,” Harry said. His eyebrows shot up on the bruised face in question. “When I went to sleep, it was fine.”

Bruce glanced at Tony, but Tony tilted his face up to the ceiling.

“The bruises just popped up overnight?” Bruce asked Harry, clearly seeing Tony wouldn’t give him any hints. “Do you frequently wake up covered in bruises?”

“Every month on the morning after the full moon,” Harry said, causing Tony to work even harder to hold in his laughter. “Do you think I could be a werewolf?”

At that so perfectly delivered line, Tony did lose his shit and started laughing while the others exchanged pinched looks.

“Eat up then, wolf cub,” Tony told Harry with a happy smile. “We’ve got a lot to do today and a measly apple isn’t going to be enough to sustain you.”

“Maybe I wasn’t clear, but I don’t sit on command, I don’t eat on command, and unless the things we need to do today involve our deal, then I’m afraid it’s another command I don’t do.”

Tony didn’t miss the way Harry’s fingers twitched in tangent with his rant. Neither did Steve. Steve looked slowly from Harry’s hands to Tony and raised his brows, but Tony merely shrugged subtly. His kid was twitchy and defensive, but he assumed that he was under a heavy pile of stress considering the whole criminal case he was running from, meeting his dad, and whatever other worries fourteen year olds had.

“Do you shut the fuck up?” Clint muttered.

Tony glared at him, but Harry looked amused.

“Not really, no. I’m a person, not a pet. If you’re confused about the difference, it means I’m capable of independent thoughts and actions. If you’re still confused, buy a fucking dictionary.”

God, Tony adored the kid. Harry was a riot.

It didn’t seem like the guys agreed.

“Language,” Steve said slowly, a quizzical wrinkle on his forehead. “Seriously, Harry, who hit you?” He glanced toward Tony, too quickly for Tony to notice, but not quick enough for Harry.

“You.”

“What?” Steve yelped and held his hands up as Tony slowly turned his head to stare him down. “I did not! I just met you!”

“Seems more logical to say some bulky stranger hit me than my biological father though, doesn’t it?” Harry shrugged and curled his upper lip at Steve. “Tony didn’t hit me and it’s none of your god damned business what happened.”

“Language,” Steve said again, impulse probably.

Tony imagined that he’d be saying it a hell of a lot more often now that Harry was there.

Harry ran a hand through his hair, a nervous habit Tony had that it seemed like his son inherited. He didn’t sound nervous though, which was impressive because his shoulders seemed to be so tight it had to ache. “Whose innocence are you protecting? I’m the only minor in the room.”

“You’re a kid and… and kids shouldn’t curse,” Steve finished. He looked like he knew exactly how lame that sounded, but he was a stubborn ass and still went ahead and said it.

“Minor,” Harry stressed. He grinned, a cool and amused grin that didn’t look very happy at all. “I’m not a fucking kid.”

Tony interrupted the building argument, stepping forward and casually standing between Harry and Steve. Steve was red faced and obviously torn between his oh so polite manners and the urge to correct Harry on his language again, but Harry was holding himself stiffly, looking like he was prepping for Steve to actually hit him.

“You like shopping?” Tony asked Harry.

“No.”

“Do you like anything?” Clint asked him.

“Not particularly,” Harry said.

“Too bad,” Tony said cheerfully. “You don’t have any clothes and we need to fix that.”

Harry sent a pointed look down at his hoodie then back up to Tony. “I have clothes.”

“One outfit does not a wardrobe make,” Tony declared, “or whatever. The point is, kid, you have to wash those clothes sometime and those papers might take a while.”

Harry clenched his jaw and glanced distrustfully past Tony toward the others. “Kind of defeats the purpose of disappearing if you tell a bunch of bloody strangers about it,” he said tightly.

“We aren’t strangers, we’re like family,” Bruce said. He scratched his jaw and lifted his brows. “You’ve really never heard of us?”

“Have you heard of me?” Harry countered with.

“Should we have?” Steve asked genuinely.

“Should I have heard of you?”

Tony watched Harry thoughtfully, trying to piece the kid together. Were all teenagers this unfriendly and defensive?

“You’ve never heard of the Avengers?” Clint smacked his hand on the counter— Harry moved backward in his seat —and sighed heavily. “Nobody told you about the aliens? Or Loki?”

Harry crossed his arms and shook his head. “Nope. Sounds like bullshit though.”

Steve murmured ‘language’ while Tony had a brilliant idea.

“To the TV!” he cried. “Jarvis, pull up the Iron Man and Avengers documentary!”

Bruce looked at Tony and Tony wondered if he’d ever be able to give Harry that sort of ‘I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed’ look that Bruce perfected. “What Iron Man and Avengers documentary?”

Tony winked at Harry, “The one I had made, obviously.”

Harry smirked over Tony’s shoulder at Bruce. “Obviously,” he drawled.

And since that sounded a lot like the kid teaming up with Tony against Bruce, Tony didn’t even comment when he saw Harry slip the apple in his pocket, completely uneaten.

 

Whatever good will it seemed like Tony earned with his son before the documentary, it was completely gone by the end of it.

Harry seemed stunned, “You were going to die to save all those people?”

“Welll…” Tony shifted uncomfortably from where he was perched across the back of the couch. He messed up with hair and shrugged at the odd look his son was giving him. His stunt with the bomb and the portal wasn’t exactly the point. He mostly just wanted Harry to see the guys in action, maybe, maybeeeee, think how cool his old man was… it wasn’t meant to be a heavy conversation.

“He saved the world,” Steve said gravely. He looked Harry square in the eyes. “Your dad’s a good man.”

“Brilliant.” Harry got up from where he had been sitting on the floor and wiped his hands on his jeans. “I’m going to my room then, if there are no more superhero movies to watch.”

“Nope, just clothes to buy,” Tony said quickly with an excited smile. Tony liked to make money for one reason—

He loved to spend it.

And spending as much money on his son today as the two of them could manage while showing Harry around Tony’s favorite city in the world? It sounded like a dream.

Except Harry was having none of it.

“No, thanks,” he said in his flat voice. He wasn’t even looking at Tony now and he was definitely inching toward his room this time. “Buying clothes wasn’t part of the deal. I said I’d stay here, and I am, I didn’t say I’d go waltzing around stores with a hero.”

And with that jab straight at Tony’s chest, Harry backed straight up to his room and slipped inside.

Tony stared at Harry’s door after Harry gently closed it behind him and wondered how on earth he’d managed to fuck up his relationship with his son even worse than it already was in a span of a few hours.

“That kid is an asshole, he’s definitely yours, Tony.”

Tony turned and pointed at the door, “Goodbye, Barton.”

Clint shrugged, long since used to being kicked out of Tony’s floor of the building they shared. “I’ll just leave you to your bonding time with Junior.”

“We all will.” Bruce got up and laid a gentle hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Aliens are a bit much to drop on a kid,” he said softly. “I’m sure he’s fine.”

“Yeah, I know,” Tony said, lying through his teeth. “He probably saw the aliens and freaked out.”

Except Harry didn’t even blink at the aliens, he’d been perfectly calm, too calm really, until Tony’s stunt at the end.

 

That was definitely being scrapped from the video in all future uses.

 

Steve and the other two got in the elevator together, leaving Tony to figure out the situation with his son. Steve wasn’t going to comment on how weird the kid was, but…

“What’s wrong with him?” Steve asked quietly with a speculative light in his blue eyes.

Clint snorted, “You mean the obvious bruise or the attitude?”

“Both.”

“He’s a brat who probably ran his mouth to some punk who took a swing at him,” Clint shrugged. “Maybe if the kid hit him harder, he wouldn’t still be such an asshole.”

Bruce grinned and shook his head at the guys. “Do you really think Tony Stark’s kid could be anything but an asshole?”

Bruce and Clint could laugh, but Steve wasn’t laughing. Something was seriously wrong with that kid.

Chapter Text

~~~~~

“There’s a prophecy about you and it’s why Voldemort targeted your parents,” Sirius whispered in a rush. “It basically says that in the end- it’s you or him, one of you has to kill the other.”

Harry was hidden out in the Forbidden Forest, hidden beneath his cloak, warm from the charm he had cast before leaving the castle. His heart beat so quickly, and pounded so hard, that Harry was sure the creatures snuffling around in the dark could hear it. “So if he comes back he’s going to kill me? It’s literally bloody prophesied?!”

“Allegedly,” Sirius said the word slowly, “the kid who’s supposed to be his downfall was born to parents who ‘thrice defeated him’. He also ‘marked them as an equal’, which I guess makes it more plausible with the scar and all.”

“And my parents defeated him three times?” Harry asked, his mind racing as quickly as his pulse. “I’m dead then.” He let out a bitter and unamused laugh, sounding mildly hysterical, before Sirius could even speak. “I called you to ask for advice about who to ask to the fucking ball, Sirius!”

“Ooh, who are you thinking?” Sirius asked eagerly, his mood shifting quickly as always. “One of the Weasley boys? That other Hogwarts champion? Maybe—”

“Cho Chang,” Harry interrupted him. “She’s pretty and plays quidditch.”

“Harry, she makes it sound like that’s a female.”

Harry raised a brow in the mirror, “And?”

“And you’re gay,” Sirius laughed. “Don’t take some poor girl to the ball because you’re scared to be yourself, kiddo. It won’t work out well and it’s not fair to her.”

Harry scowled. He never should have told Sirius about his confusing dream about Bill Weasley after the Quidditch World Cup. “I said maybe I’m interested in blokes, Sirius. Maybe.”

“And I’m saying ‘definitely’,” Sirius smirked. “Maybe send Bill an owl? Ask him to come?”

“Piss off.” Harry sighed and slumped against the tree and tried to focus on what was important. “How’d you find out about the prophecy?”

“Dumbledore told me.” Sirius’ face got dark quickly. He sometimes had a shadow in the back of his eyes, an ever present haunting from his time in Azkaban, but when he was furious, it seemed to cloak his grey eyes completely.

“Just like that?” Harry asked, surprised.

“After a fashion,” Sirius hedged. He sighed when Harry’s expression turned prompting, “I told him I was going to take you and leave the country. He said the signs look like Voldemort’s returning soon, somehow, and we had a row. I said fuck this country, we’ll move somewhere that I’m still your guardian but not a fugitive, and then he dumped the prophecy on me. I…” Sirius hesitated. “I don’t think James knew it, not as much as I know anyway, or… or he probably wouldn’t have believed it.”

Harry closed his eyes, exhausted. “Does it matter now?” he asked softly. “After a fucking dragon and… and everything else… I’m just going to die when Voldemort comes back?”

“Absolutely not,” Sirius snarled. “If he comes back, you’re getting the hell out of the battlefield, Harry. I won’t have you at risk playing Dumbledore’s games. Let them fight it out, like adults. Anyone can shoot an AK at the bastard, it doesn’t need to be you.”

Harry opened his eyes partially and peered at Sirius through his lashes. “Flee? That’s your advice, Sirius? I’d be a bloody coward, leaving these people behind. If I’m the one meant to kill him, then I’ve got to stay.”

“You’re not staying,” Sirius said, his voice dropping to a growl. “If or when Voldemort comes back, we’re leaving.”

“We?” Harry asked, too exhausted to hide the hope in his voice. “You’d- you’d go with me?”

Sirius’ eyes softened. “Kiddo, I’ll always go with you.”

Harry didn’t plan on fleeing, he didn’t plan on being a coward.

Then he watched Cedric die. He saw how hopeless and pathetic he was against Voldemort. He faced death that night and then ran as quick as he could from it at his first opportunity.

Like a coward.

 

He’d also taken Parvati Patil to the Yule Ball, which should have been a sign of his cowardice and utter worthlessness even then.

~~~~~

Harry laid back on his the bed in the bedroom Tony gave him and tossed the apple he nicked in the air, over and over, as he automatically caught it and let his thoughts consume him.

Harry was named after a brave man. James Potter, despite whatever prattiness he had in his school days, had joined the aurors and the order and tried to fight against evil in the world, he tried to make it a safer world. James Potter died on his feet, like a man, staring Voldemort down in an effort to save his wife and son.

A brave woman gave birth to Harry. Lily Potter, the bright and vivacious muggleborn who stood up against bigotry and never once let the world tell her how she was supposed to be, never let it tell her who it thought she should be. Lily Potter could have fled, Voldemort offered her three chances, but she didn’t take them.

And Tony Stark, ‘Iron Man’, the man who fathered him. Harry watched that video. He looked between the fight scenes and the news coverage and he saw Tony. Tony sacrificed a lot, had made the ultimate sacrifice right at the end (saved only by a lucky chance), and was a hero. He didn’t fly away from death, didn’t save himself with his Iron Man suit and his power, he just…

He was a good man, just as Steve Rogers said. He was a good man like James was a good man and Lily was a good woman. All good, all brave.

All had a hand in creating Harry, who was a pathetic coward.

 

Harry scoffed and caught the apple from the air. He swiped angrily at his face with his jumper sleeve and then grimaced at the wet snotty mess he just smeared all over it.

He was doing swell here, really. He’d refused to eat, wary about trying to eat in front of all those… those incredibly huge people who looked like they could do a hell of a lot worse than a few smacks. He refused to go shopping with the guy who he was depending on to help Sirius. Then he’d went and exiled himself to his room, like a hungry and grimy feeling idiot.

Harry rolled onto his side and pulled out the instructions Sirius wrote him, ‘so he wouldn’t forget’. It had the information on Tony Stark, reminders about the things they all went out and did as a group to jolt Tony’s memory, and a firm note right at the bottom:

Don’t forget to write this time.

Harry had asked how he was supposed to send a letter to Sirius when Sirius was the one keeping Hedwig while he was gone, and Sirius had cheekily wrote his home address at the bottom and told Harry that letters addressed the muggle way would work.

They argued a bit.

Someone could block Harry’s letters just like they blocked Sirius’. Sirius told him not to worry, that he’d sit on the stoop as Snuffles and catch any letters before they were delivered through the slot.

Harry asked what if they didn’t get delivered period but were intercepted in the mail? Again, ‘don’t worry, I’ll handle it, kiddo’.

Harry asked if Sirius if one magical mirror would honestly bring down an entire mechanical airplane?

‘Do you want to be on the plane when you test that question?’

Sirius scowled when Harry only shrugged, so Harry just accepted the muggle method.

He felt naked though, exposed and uneasy, without his wand, mirror, or owl. It seemed daft, with Voldemort back, but if Harry could trust anyone to watch out for him, it was Sirius. And now Sirius was depending on him to write, assuring him that he hadn’t been murdered, and so Harry would.

Harry forced himself off the bed and began quietly sifting through the drawers of the nightstand, the dresser, the shelves of the ridiculously large walk in closet, he even peeked under the bed and didn’t even find a spec of dust.

If he wanted to write to Sirius, he was going to have to travel out of the bedroom and track down some paper, a pen, an envelope, and some stamps. He wanted to do it stealthily, having no desire to run into any of the heroes who lived in the tower. And he was either going to have to do it in his tshirt or wear the jumper with the proof of his snotty tears on it for everyone to see.

It was a real dick move of Sirius to not even give Harry time to grab some potions from Diagon Alley to heal with. Sure, he’d taken the time and effort to check Harry over and heal any true injuries, as sparse as they were, but he claimed to not know a spell for the bruises and they didn’t have time to grab a potion.

Privately, Harry thought that Sirius was somehow punishing him for something by making him show up at Stark Tower looking like a punching bag, but Sirius swore he had no ulterior motives.

Regardless… Harry rocked on his feet by his door as he warred with himself.

Jumper or tshirt?

He grimaced at the snotty sleeve, and what reason did he have to cry really?, and shed the jumper quickly.

Harry did a quick check of his arms and was relieved to see that the only bruise he really had left was from where Uncle Vernon had yanked him by the upper arm. It was faded and his short sleeve covered most of it though.

He’d just be quick- go find something to write with, get back in.

Easy.

Harry opened his door slowly, relieved when he couldn’t hear anyone talking and stepped out on quiet and careful feet.

The sitting room was empty now, so Harry started his search there. He sifted through drawers that were built into the walls, but all he found was a bunch of video game equipment. Harry had a hard time imagining any of the guys flying around, killing aliens, saving civilians, playing video games, but someone there must.

Harry planned on looking through the drawers and cabinets in the kitchen too, even a scrap of receipt paper or a page from a cookbook would suffice, but then he got caught.

“There’s not much food in there, we order take out a lot, but you should feel free to help yourself to whatever you want.”

Harry spun around from the cabinet he’d been peeking in, his heart lodged in his throat, and saw Tony standing in the doorway now.

“I wasn’t looking for food,” Harry denied quickly, a touch too defensively. He closed the cabinet and leaned against it.

Tony gave him a grin, one that Harry suspected came easily to him, and tossed Harry a bundle of something soft and black that he carried. Harry held it up and saw it was a tshirt. It had a logo on it, for a muggle band, Harry presumed, and was small enough to fit Harry.

“Go ahead and keep that. I was actually on my way to ask what size jeans you wear,” Tony said. He mimicked Harry’s pose, leaning against the wall he stood beside, and looked Harry over slowly. His eyes hesitated near Harry’s shoulders, causing him to pull self-consciously on his shirt sleeve. “I might have some sweats in your size. So you can wash your clothes, kid,” he added when Harry’s confusion must have shown on his face.

“Oh.” Harry looked at the shirt he held and felt an irritating swell of something in his chest. “I… er… thanks.”

Tony shrugged his shoulders and his grin was crooked. “Don’t thank me yet, the only sweats I have on hand that fit you will probably be pink, bedazzled, and Pepper’s.”

Harry didn’t want to ask, but… “Who’s Pepper?”

“Gorgeous woman.”

“Ah.” Harry nodded. “So you two are…?”

“It’s embarrassing really, for her, not me. She’s been in love with me for years, kid, just obsessed. Calling me, texting me, following me around with a boom box and romantic songs playing.” Tony sighed and Harry got the impression he was being toyed with. “You’ll see when she gets here, it’s all pretty gross, the lovesick faces she makes at me all day.”

“Right,” Harry said skeptically.

Tony’s grin turned a little more mischievous and he wiggled his eyebrows at Harry. “How about you? Is your ‘good friend’ also good looking?”

Harry couldn’t have held back the startled laugh that left his mouth if he tried. “No,” he said, shocked and amused. He hadn’t even considered that calling his godfather ‘a good friend’ could be so terribly misconstrued. “Well, he thinks he is,” he amended himself, “but it’s not like that.”

“Hey, no judgement from me,” Tony held his hands up and moved to plop down on one of the bar stools. “Even ugly guys need love, I guess.”

“Siri— my friend and I are not in love,” Harry scowled.

“Anyone else special in your life then?” Tony propped his chin in his hand and seemed to be giving Harry his complete attention, something that caused Harry’s neck to feel hot. “Any little British girlfriends I can claim will never be good enough for my son?” He waved his hand at the cabinet Harry still stood in front of, “And feel free to keep looking for food while you tell me all about them. Steve might have left a granola bar or something equally healthy and disgusting in there.”

Harry automatically took a step away from the cabinet. “I think your ears might be injured, probably from the bloody alien invasion, but I said I wasn’t looking for food. And- and I don’t have any ‘little British girlfriends’.”

“Boyfriends then?”

The heat on Harry’s neck traveled to his face. “No,” he said firmly. “Do you have any paper?”

“Paper?” Tony looked surprised by Harry’s relatively innocent question. “You were looking in the kitchen cabinets for paper?”

“No, I was looking for the stamp and envelope that I need.” Harry rolled his eyes then took a deep breath and tried not to start an argument with the guy who probably had paper so he could write to Sirius. “My friend is going to be worried if I don’t write, so… so could I please have a piece of paper?”

“Sure.” Tony didn’t look bothered at all by Harry’s rudeness or his request. “You could also just call your friend. You might have missed it, I do try and keep it on the down low, but I’ve got some decent tech here, I’m sure I can find a cell phone for you to use.”

Harry grinned against his will. Obviously Tony was into technology, which meant that perhaps Sirius holding on to Harry’s wand had been a good call after all. Sirius said only large amounts of magic would mess with muggle technology, but there was a bloody lot of it here.

“I don’t know his number,” Harry admitted. “Just an address.”

Tony picked his head up and looked truly pleased with Harry’s answer for some reason. “Kid, if you’ve got a name or address, I can find a phone number before you can say ‘I’m not hungry’.”

“Why would I say that?”

“Want me to order something for lunch?”

“I’m not—” Harry cut off his automatic response and glared at Tony’s quick grin. “No thanks,” he said instead. “And I don’t need his number, he doesn’t use a phone.”

“Hmm…” Tony hummed and scrutinized Harry closely. Harry held his gaze evenly, he wasn’t lying and he wasn’t worried about what Tony was searching for. “So this friend of yours, the criminal—”

“I never said he was a criminal,” Harry interjected quickly.

Tony grinned wryly and batted his lashes at Harry. “You’re right. Most guys with nothing to hide often run off to countries without extradition treaties.”

Touché.

Harry jerked his chin, neither confirming nor denying it.

“So you’ve got a criminal friend who has an address, but no phone number, and wants you to write him?” Tony asked.

“Thats quite a presumption,” Harry said carefully with a blank expression. “I was hoping you’d say ‘here, Harry, I can spare a sheet of paper,’ but guessing games are good too.”

Tony threw his head back and laughed. “Hang tight, kid, I’ll be right back.”

Harry twisted the fabric of the tshirt while Tony strolled casually away, hands in his pockets, a jaunty tune whistling from between his lips. Harry held the shirt up again, looking it over more carefully now that he was alone.

It was… it was genuinely just a normal shirt. It had a faded logo for something called Metallica across the front, a small nick in the collar of it, proof it had been worn, and…

Harry closed one eye as he counted.

It was the fourth thing he owned that belonged to someone in his family, Sirius notwithstanding.

A cloak, a map, a mirror, a tshirt.

His family heirlooms.

Except Tony isn’t really family, he reminded himself firmly. Blood doesn’t mean family.

He did grin, if only to himself, when Tony came skipping back in the room with a hand full of stationary.

“You remind me a bit of my friend,” Harry admitted as he gratefully accepted the notebook, ink pen, and pre-stamped envelope from Tony.

“Yeah?” Tony hid his head in the fridge. “He’s also a talented genius with a flying robot suit?”

“Annoying cheerful, actually,” Harry said sarcastically, yet entirely truthfully. He moved over to the counter and set the supplies down with the shirt. “He’s a moody bastard though, a real pain in my ass.”

“We have so much in common then!” Tony cried. He pulled two cans of soda out of the fridge and tossed one high up in the air to Harry. Harry snatched it easily and nodded at him in another silent thanks.

Tony moved over to the bar and grabbed an apple out of the bowl of fruit still sitting there and began absently tossing it in the air while he watched Harry slowly take a seat and sip the soda.

“Give me a bone here, kid, tell me literally anything about yourself.”

Harry watched as Tony tossed the ball higher and higher and still caught it, he’d have made a decent seeker if he was a wizard. “I’d rather not.”

“Best friend’s name?”

“No.”

“Where do you stay when you aren’t on the run?”

“Nope.”

“Best day of your life?”

“No.”

“Worst day of your life?”

Harry smiled mirthlessly. “No.”

Tony tossed the apple up and both their eyes followed its descent. “Favorite flavor of ice cream?”

“Raspberry.”

Tony’s eyes flew to Harry and his hand wavered, so Harry lunged across the bar and caught the apple before it hit.

“Damn, you’ve got good reflexes,” Tony said, sounding approving. “Play any sports?”

Harry straightened up and he was the one tossing the apple now. “No,” he lied. It wasn’t like he could talk quidditch with a muggle.

Tony grinned and backed up from the counter. He held his hands up and there was a bit of a challenge in the way he looked at Harry now. “No time to start like the present.”

Harry lifted an amused brow as he looked at the undoubtedly expensive electronics filling the room behind Tony. “If you miss, you’ll whine that I’ve broken your toys.”

Or worse. And it wasn’t like Harry could just run off from Tony’s place either, he’d have to grit his teeth and bear it until he got the papers he needed.

“Then I won’t miss,” Tony said with what was beginning to seem like rather characteristic cockiness. “Double dog dare you.”

Harry laughed quietly while he got to his feet and then tossed the apple as lightly as he could toward Tony.

He didn’t care how confident Tony was, Harry wasn’t going to be the one to break an expensive electronic.

“You throw like a skinny fourteen year old,” Tony said, his tone playful, when he easily caught the apple. “Best movie of all time?”

Harry caught the apple when Tony threw it back. It was a decent throw, but the apple was much slower and larger than a snitch, Harry didn’t plan on missing any throws. “No,” he said shortly, unwilling to give up more information than he already had.

He didn’t forget Tony’s little addendum to their deal. Harry already abandoned his friends, he wouldn’t leave Sirius as well. And he wouldn’t let Tony act like he wanted to get to know him, then use the information against him in some way.

“Wrong answer,” Tony said seriously. “It’s the Breakfast Club closely followed by Lord of the Rings.”

Whatever the hell that meant. Harry vaguely recalled hearing Dean Thomas and Hermione talk about Lord of the Rings before, but it wasn’t as if Harry had ever seen it.

Harry irritably threw the apple at Tony when he raised his hand for it. It smacked directly in his palm. “If you say so.”

“I do, and I never lie, not to my son anyway,” Tony winked. “What’s your favorite band?”

Harry’s arm stretched to catch the returning apple quickly. “Metallica.”

Tony looked surprised and thrilled. “Are they really? They’re in my top five!”

“No.” Harry threw the apple back and smirked when Tony had to lunge to catch it. “And that’s the question to all your questions.”

Tony stuck his lip out and batted his eyes at Harry. “My feelings are hurt, kid. Don’t ever joke about Metallica. If they’re not in your top list then we need to run that DNA test again.”

Harry looked over the man that he so closely resembled.

Whoever all told him that Harry looked like James Potter had clearly never met Tony Stark.

“Feel free,” Harry said. Sirius was confident in who Harry’s biological father was, just as his parents had apparently been the day he was born.

“Nah.” Tony laughed and threw the apple to Harry, sending it in a soaring arch. “You’re definitely mine. Do you like school?”

Harry said no, which was both truthful and taken as another evasive response.

The two of them kept it up for a bit, tossing the apple in increasingly dramatic moves, as Tony asked questions and Harry evaded them. They’d eventually had to span nearly the length of the flat with Harry in the kitchen area and Tony in the sitting room. Once they’d gotten going, Harry could see that Tony was rather competitive as well, and they kept one upping each other with trick shots.

Harry answered harmless questions, such as his favorite color (red), favorite season (fall), and Harry even slipped up and said no when Tony surprised him by asking if Harry used a passport to fly to New York.

In Harry’s defense, he’d been distracted by actually having to jump in the air to catch what seemed to be a purposefully high throw.

“How’d you get past customs?” Tony asked curiously as Harry scowled fiercely at the apple clenched in his hands. “Stow away in a suitcase?”

“None of your fucking business,” Harry snapped. In his moment of anger at his own loose tongue, he threw the apple much harder than he meant to- and with pretty bloody terrible aim.

Harry’s eyes went wide and his hands automatically clenched into fists as he saw the apple fly right over Tony’s head and smack straight in the center of the telly.

Fuck.

Fuck.

Fuck.

Between Harry’s hateful tone and the way the apple struck the dead center- there was no way that Tony was going to believe it was an accident.

Harry had his hands empty and by his shoulders when Tony turned and looked at Harry with a curious gaze that Harry also thought was probably characteristic for the man.

“That was an accident,” he stammered quickly. “I’ll pay you for it. My friend can send money as soon as I write to him. And- and if he doesn’t hear from me real soon he’s going to freak out and he can be really dangerous sometimes and I swear it was an accident. You said you wouldn’t miss,” he tacked on desperately.

“Woah, calm down,” Tony once again mimicked Harry’s pose, holding his empty hands up while he tilted his head and furrowed his brows at Harry. “Your good friend you want to run away to Russia with is dangerous?”

Harry backed up a few steps, his back bumping into the fridge. “If you hurt me, he will kill you,” Harry said truthfully. He ducked in an audible breath and used it to steady his nerves. He clenched his hands into fists and quickly jammed them in his pockets. “I’ll pay for it. Tell me the cost,” he said, still sounding more than a little desperate, but working to keep from rambling any more.

Tony’s frank and curious eyes didn’t seem to miss any of Harry’s movements, but he slowly lowered his hands just after Harry did.

“That TV was crap, it needed updated anyway,” Tony said casually. He turned his back to Harry, allowing Harry’s breath to come a little more freely. He snagged the apple out of the center of the telly, leaving behind a perfectly apple sized and shaped hole, and turned to grin at Harry before looking it over and taking a bite from it. “I think the plasma improved the flavor.”

Since that was a mad thing to say, Harry didn’t respond.

Neither of them said anything then, both just watching the other.

Harry, warily. Tony, curiously.

Harry was the one to eventually break the suffocating silence. “What do I owe you?” he asked hoarsely. Sirius would send the money, Harry knew he would. He could probably buy a thousand of those tellies and never bat an eye.

“Lunch.”

Harry’s eyes flicked from Tony’s hand to his perfectly serious face. “What?”

“And shopping,” added Tony.

Harry thought he misheard, so he said ‘What?’ again and Tony repeated himself.

“You’re…” Harry shook his head. “Shopping for what? I’ve told you I haven’t got any money.” Harry refrained from asking again about his hearing, certain that now was not the time to push the surprisingly unflappable man.

“And I’m loaded,” Tony said without a bit of humility. “You need clothes, we need a TV, trust me you don’t want to see Bruce without his soaps, and I’m starving and we’ve established that besides apples, there isn’t a damn thing worth eating here.”

Harry blinked. “I broke that,” he said dumbly, waving a hand toward the telly. “You’re not pissed?”

Tony laughed, “Kid, I’ve broken the TV so much that I think I’ve single-handedly kept Best Buy in business by replacing it. Shit happens,” he shrugged, “no use crying over it.”

“Shit happens,” Harry repeated, gobsmacked. “And instead of crying about it, you want to go shopping?”

“I definitely mentioned lunch as well,” Tony said, his face breaking out in a wide smile. “Come on, let me buy you some food and clothes, no catch. Oh! I know! I’ll even teach you to drive.”

Harry would have refused, even if that was a brilliant and odd offer, except he didn’t quite feel like pushing his luck any further today. He glanced uneasily at the stationary on the counter and bit his lip for a moment.

“If you want, I can have my assistant add overnight postage to that,” Tony nodded toward the envelope. “You can write to your ‘good friend who is definitely a possibly murderous criminal and is worrying about you’ tonight and I’ll make sure he gets it tomorrow.”

“You can do that?” Harry asked sharply.

Tony held up one hand with his palm facing Harry. “I swear.”

He didn’t look like he was lying, he looked genuine. And Harry was usually pretty good at detecting bullshit, he thought anyway.

Harry snatched the stuff off the counter and tried to inch around Tony toward his the bedroom he was staying in temporarily. Tony looked truly upset when Harry silently opened the door until Harry glanced uncertainly at him over his shoulder.

“Let me change my shirt and I’ll be ready.”

Chapter Text

“You’re in a good mood,” Remus said, his voice heavy with suspicion as he joined Sirius in the kitchen one morning for a cuppa.

Sirius tried to keep the smile off his face. “Am I?”

“You are.” Remus added a spoonful of sugar to his tea and stirred it while staring at Sirius with narrowed eyes. “You have been for days.”

Sirius hummed noncommittally.

Of course he was.

Because three days ago, he’d broken out of his personal prison to break his godson out of his prison and ship him off to America.

And Sirius was still basking in the joy of it.

Harry was safe. Harry was out of the war. And Harry was with someone that Sirius was pretty sure would burn the world for his family.

The Tony Stark that Sirius remembered had been a pretty party boy. Of course, Sirius, James, Lily, and Remus had all been pretty partiers at the time, so he’d fit right in with their group when they met him. He’d been a cocky little shit, brilliant and good looking, and he knew it too, but he was also passionate and fierce.

Something James had commented on multiple times in the most disturbing manner possible.

And Sirius had done a bit of traveling between the time that Harry’s name came out of the goblet and before he bought Harry a ticket to New York. Mostly to the muggle library where he’d done as much research on Tony Stark as he could.

And good Merlin, the things he found.

Sirius spent hours in the library watching clips about Tony Stark and his metal flying machine. Tony Stark and his brilliance. Tony Stark and his multibillion dollar company he ran. Tony Stark used to develop missiles for military use then changed the company focus to something about energy that Sirius didn’t quite understand. Tony still seemed like a partier, live fast die pretty kind of bloke, but the articles called him a hero.

Nobody needed a hero more than Harry.

There were also photos- thousands of photos.

Sirius had a kind and young library worker help him print out the ones of a younger Tony, the ones that looked just like Harry. He added a few recent ones of Tony, admirable, amused, and envious in equal amounts at how Tony kept his good looks. Seemed like he kept his arrogance and disdain for monogamy too, which was a riot in Sirius’ opinion.

In every photo though, Tony looked strong, powerful, confident, and in charge.

And that was exactly who Harry needed in his corner.

Sirius was a worthless godfather thanks to a mistake he’d made almost fourteen years ago. He couldn’t outright claim custody of Harry and hide him away from the war that was undoubtedly unfolding. He couldn’t keep Harry from being targeted by Voldemort or used by Albus, but Tony Stark could.

There wasn’t a doubt in Sirius’ mind that Tony Stark, that brilliant and fierce, passionate and caring, powerful muggle man wouldn’t do everything in his power to protect Harry. Especially when Harry surely showed up at his place, looking just like the bloke, but with Lily’s eyes and obvious signs of abuse.

‘Can’t we heal these before I go?’ Harry had asked Sirius pleadingly, referring to the marks that Lily’s disgusting fucking brother-in-law had left on Sirius’ godson.

It had hurt Sirius to glibly brush off Harry’s insecurity and worry, but Harry was a reclusive bastard. If Tony didn’t see the signs of abuse, he might never figure it out, and Sirius was planning on Tony wrecking vengeance on Harry’s behalf for Sirius.

Harry might be under the impression that the goal in him going to New York was to find a way to help Sirius follow him, but Sirius’ plan was much more simple:

Get Harry the hell out of the country and force him to find a family that could protect him.

And, as far as Sirius knew, he’d done it.

So, yeah, Sirius was pretty smug and happy the past few days. He couldn’t wait for Albus to find out that Harry was out of his hands— he was going to be furious and Sirius might throw a party afterward.

Sirius used to have nothing but respect for Albus, then he gave James partial information on a prophecy, forcing them into hiding, putting the Potter family in the position to be murdered, and didn’t even give James or Lily the respect to tell them the full prophecy. If either of them had heard what Sirius did, the bit about the child being born to parents who thrice defeated the Dark Lord, Sirius didn’t doubt that they would have had Harry’s parentage and DNA test on the front page of the Prophet by the next morning.

But Albus kept his cards close to his chest and gave Voldemort his chance to mark Harry as his equal and start a powerful obsession with Harry that had only grown since Harry first defeated him.

Less importantly, but still rather disgustingly, Albus never even bothered to push for Sirius to stand for trial after he was arrested. Despite all the things Sirius had done for the order before his arrest, Albus left him to drown in Azkaban and he dropped Harry off with some abusive muggles and never looked back.

So, in Sirius’ very mature opinion, Albus Dumbledore could go fuck himself.

Sirius refocused on the conversation with Remus and quit grinning in his tea. “It’s nice weather,” he lied easily. “Sunshine boosts happiness, yeah?”

Remus snorted and sent a pointed look out the grimy kitchen window to the grey sky. “You’re a shit liar, Pads. What are you up to?”

Sirius wished he could trust Remus, but when it came to Harry’s safety, Sirius trusted no one. Well, he was putting a hell of a lot of trust into a bloke who once took a body shot of tequila off James then licked a line of salt off Lily’s neck in the middle of a crowded pub, but… but Tony had also gotten them kicked out of that same pub an hour later when some bloke got handsy with Lily and Tony knocked him out with a single right hook.

Also, Harry was Tony’s flesh and blood son, something Tony didn’t have, and there was just no way he wouldn’t love and cherish the kid.

Once you pushed past Harry’s understandably defensive exterior, he was the best kid in the world. Very lovable, in Sirius’ unbiased opinion.

Sirius beamed at Remus from his comfortable spot at the kitchen table. “Absolutely nothing, Moony. Absolutely nothing.”

Remus looked skeptical, but frankly, Sirius didn’t give a shit.

 

Sirius whistled cheerfully while he worked alongside Molly, her brood, and Hermione that day. He mopped floors while he wondered what Harry was up to, he dusted curtains while he chuckled about how much Harry resembled Tony, and he even ignored Kreacher pilfering heirlooms when he remembered how upset Harry had been to find out James wasn’t his dad. Not because Harry had any true attachment to the man who raised him for a year, but because he thought Sirius would somehow love him less.

Harry was adorable.

~~~~~

The day Sirius broke out of Grimmauld, he’d done so with his stack of photos of Tony Stark, and fought with himself the whole time he traveled to go check on his godson.

It was time for Harry to get the fuck out of the country, but…

But he’d just watched his classmate die, he’d had his blood stolen by the rat that got his parents killed, he watched Voldemort be reborn, and he found out it had been his professor behind the entire stunt with the tournament.

It wasn’t like Harry was living the best life, or had the greatest mental health already, so Sirius wasn’t real thrilled about dropping some more shit on the kid.

After he slipped right into Harry’s house, Dung was a lazy piece of scum, Sirius knew he had to tell Harry that night. He’d rather emotionally scar his godson than ever see bruises mark his young face again.

“Maybe you should sit?” Sirius suggested to Harry once he told him that they’d be escaping that night. He couldn’t exactly rush Harry to New York without spilling the unintentional secret.

James and Lily never planned on keeping it from Harry, they just… they just died before they could tell him. And it wasn’t like Sirius had any chances to send an informational letter from Azkaban.

Harry looked nervous almost instantly and he shook his head. “I’ll stand, thanks.”

“Suit yourself.” Sirius was anxious as he pulled the photos out of his pocket. He held them out to Harry silently and watched as Harry inched forward, snatched the papers, and retreated back to the wall.

Sirius watched Harry’s one good tell, his eyes, while he slowly looked the pictures over. His eyes narrowed, then widened, then snapped up to Sirius.

“What’s this?”

Sirius swallowed harshly, but he kept his eyes steady as they met Harry’s. “Your father.”

Harry didn’t blink, Sirius didn’t think his chest was even moving.

“Breathe,” Sirius said. He jumped to his feet, panicked, when Harry’s chest didn’t move after a full sixty seconds.

Sirius’ movements must have spurred Harry’s little trance, because he jolted backward and Sirius heard the sudden whoosh of air in his lungs.

“You’re lying,” Harry said, his voice was rough and his entire body was trembling. Harry flung the papers right at Sirius but they fluttered weakly halfway between them and landed on the floor. “YOU’RE LYING! We swore to not do that, Sirius!”

Sirius knew that Harry must know he wasn’t lying, otherwise he’d never be so upset.

“And I’m not lying now,” Sirius said calmly. “His name’s Tony, he’s—”

“James.”

Sirius waited, but when it didn’t seem like Harry was going to say anything more than James’ name, he tilted his head at him. “What about James?”

“He’s your best mate,” Harry whispered. “He’s my dad.”

Sirius backed up against the bed again and sank down on it. “James is my best mate, my brother, and he’ll always be your dad, kiddo. It’s just that Tony,” Sirius gestured slowly toward the paper, careful not to panic Harry in his currently delicate state, “is also your dad.”

Harry glanced quickly toward the photos, then up to Sirius. At the photos, Sirius.

“I look like James?” Harry said uncertainly.

Sirius snorted, probably a tad insensitively. “Do you have untamable black hair like James did? Sure, but so does Tony. Trust me, James knew exactly whose kid you were when you were born.”

“So he knew my mum shagged some- some random guy?!”

It was definitely insensitive when Sirius outright laughed at the hot indignation in Harry’s voice. “Be a bit hard for James to miss, since he shagged him too.”

Harry’s fidgeting fingers stilled and he finally sunk down to the floor. He curled his arms around his bent legs and propped his chin on his knees as he stared at Sirius incredulously. “What… the fuck… did you just say?”

Sirius grinned and leaned his hands back on Harry’s lumpy and bare mattress. “Let me tell you a story about a wild winter in London, after James and Lily were married, during a lull between battles while both sides were drawing up new plans… I’ll start with the night my best mates and I met a good looking stranger and how that led to the wildest week of our lives…”

It was a different time, a better time really; everyone was shagging everyone. They were all young, attractive, and worried they wouldn’t live to see thirty. James and Lily were more in love than Sirius had ever thought possible, something he assured Harry of, but they both wanted to experience as much of life as they could, while they could.

 

By the end of it, Harry was glaring at the photos of Tony that were back in his hands and he had a distinct green tint to the pale parts of his face.

Sirius knew Harry was still young, still relatively innocent in some adult topics, but he still gave him as many details as he could remember about the polyamorous love affair James and Lily had shared with Tony.

He kind of hoped that it would help Harry understand that being gay wasn’t ‘freaky’, as his piece of shit uncle had drilled in his head. Hell, Sirius didn’t know hardly anyone who wasn’t at least partially interested in the same sex. It would be more abnormal to be straight, in his opinion.

 

“You’re sure?” Harry asked Sirius after a quiet few minutes that were only interrupted by the ticking of Harry’s wristwatch.

Sirius nodded, “He can do a test when you get there, but look at the photos, kiddo. James knew, Lily knew, I know, it’s time Tony did too.”

“So…” Harry clenched the photos in his hands hard enough to crinkle them and carefully avoided looking Sirius in the eyes. “What’s that mean for… for you? I mean… I mean you and James were friends, pretty much brothers, and this bloke wasn’t really your friend…”

“Well we certainly weren’t as close as he was with your parents, but I wouldn’t say we weren’t friends at all,” Sirius grinned. “Tony’s a real laugh, you’ll like him.”

Harry still refused to look up at him, choosing instead to talk quietly to his lap. “But James made you my godfather, and you accepted because he was your friend.”

It took Sirius a moment to puzzle together what Harry was implying, and he slid to the floor to scoot over by him the moment it clicked.

“Hey,” Sirius reached out slowly and put his hand on Harry’s ducked head, “I accepted because I love you, kiddo. I loved James and Lily, they were the best friends a bloke could have, but you’re my godson. It’s you and me forever, Harry, you’re stuck with me.”

Harry looked up at him through his messy black fringe and his eyes were pleading. “This doesn’t change anything?”

“This changes nothing,” Sirius said firmly, meaning every syllable of what he said.

~~~~~

And it didn’t.

The only difference now was that Sirius was eager for Harry to write, not anxious.

At least in New York Sirius knew that Harry wasn’t in danger from the magical world. He wasn’t being struck (and god help Tony Stark if Sirius discovered otherwise), he was being fed, and he was probably finally being properly spoiled if Tony was still in the habit of throwing money around like a king.

So Sirius could wait patiently to hear from his godson and feel giddy over pulling off the ultimate prank on Albus and Voldemort both.

 

A prank that was revealed that same night at the next Order meeting.

 

Sirius had been pretty sure he knew what the topic was going to be when Albus rounded up the entire Order and stood before them with a grim face.

“I have troubling news,” he said, his blue eyes glancing toward Sirius’ practiced and perfectly blank face with a hint of fear in them.

He should be afraid. If Sirius weren’t the one who kidnapped Harry, then he’d be dueling Albus to the death for losing him.

“Harry is missing.”

The Order immediately burst into shouts and accusations, wails and confusion. Sirius played his part to the best of his abilities. He stood on his feet and screamed at Albus, he cursed at Mundungus (who admitted to sleeping during the night Harry went missing), and he pointed his wand furiously at Snape when he suggested that Harry probably ran off ‘having a tantrum’.

Actually, that last part wasn’t faked at all.

“Quiet!” Albus shot a bang in the air with his wand, effectively silencing all the members. He turned to Sirius, “Has Harry been in contact with you?”

“No,” Sirius growled. “And I’ve sent over a dozen bloody letters.”

Snape took the chance to mutter something about Sirius not following orders, as if Sirius were a child who needed Albus’ permission to write to his godson, and Sirius took the chance to hex him.

Honestly, it was the best day that Sirius had in ages. He even got to storm away dramatically when Albus started setting up search parties and refused to allow Sirius to join them. Which, truthfully, Sirius got to storm away dramatically loads of times, he just usually got eyes rolled at his back instead of sympathetic looks.

Sirius grinned and clicked his tongue up at Hedwig when he slammed his way into his bedroom to spend time with Buckbeak and Harry’s owl. Hedwig hadn’t cared much for Sirius at first. He’d taken her from her owner and then immediately shrunk her a little and charmed her feathers to a deep calico color, disguising her as Harry’s well-known pet. After the first night with Sirius though, she’d finally quit pecking him, and he was bribing her with bacon (something Harry assured him that she adored) to eventually make them the best of friends.

“Best day ever,” Sirius whispered to Hedwig after she flew down from her perch to take the strip of bacon he brought her.

Hedwig hooted in a decidedly agreeable way.

 

The next morning though, Sirius’ mood only elevated. He had been laying on the front stoop as Padfoot, waiting to see if the muggle postman would bring him a letter or not.

Sirius knew that Harry was concerned about sending letters through the post, but Sirius had carefully unwound one of the ancestral wards on the house that had left it off the post route for so long. Albus had no reason to block muggle mail, not like he so obviously had Harry’s owl post, and so Sirius had taken to having morning doggy naps on the stoop while he waited.

It was nice sometimes, being underestimated for his brilliance.

Sirius was daydreaming about whatever fun things Harry was hopefully up to when he heard someone approach.

“Hey, boy.” The muggle man was wary as he walked up toward Sirius with his hand out. Sirius perked up and let out a soft woof at the unassuming white envelope. “Good doggy, I’m just going to leave this for your owners, okay?” He slowly opened the mailbox and Sirius let out a quick and ferocious bark, causing him to drop the letter and back away quickly.

Sirius was still laughing about the look of terror on his face when he made it back up to his room, letter safely clenched in his hands.

“Let’s see what Harry’s up to, hmm?” Sirius shared a grin with Hedwig (in Sirius’ entirely sane opinion, it looked like Hedwig had grinned at him) when she flew to his shoulders, no doubt recognizing her human’s smell on the envelope.

If Sirius had been hoping for pages and pages of information, he’d have been disappointed. Luckily, he was a professional at that point at reading through Harry’s curt and coded words.

‘I’m fine,’ meant he was safe.

His ‘friend’, Tony no doubt, was fine, which probably (Sirius traced the marked out word ‘nice’) meant that Tony was treating him well.

Harry having a phone meant that Tony was at least buying Harry some things. Harry requesting that Sirius get one as well and call him meant he still didn’t trust muggle post.

And Sirius chuckled at Harry’s signature.

Cheeky little pest.

“What d’you think, girl?” Sirius stroked Hedwig’s wing thoughtfully as he looked at Harry’s ps at the bottom of the sheet. “Do we send him money or try and force him to create a relationship?”

Hedwig twisted her head around and ruffled her feathers.

“That’s because you’re not thinking it through,” Sirius tsk’d at her. “It’s like when Effie and Fleamont took me in. I didn’t have any money at the time, so I had to depend on them for basic necessities. And eventually, it made me realize that I could count on them for other stuff too.” Sirius shook his finger playfully at Hedwig, “Too much independence can isolate you.”

Hedwig nipped his finger gently and hooted.

“So we’re in agreement? Make sure Tony’s providing for him and then pretend we can’t send him money?”

Hedwig’s next hoot and quick return to her perch was all the encouragement Sirius needed. He got to his feet with a wide smile and tipped an imaginary hat at Hedwig and the lazily sleeping hippogriff in the corner both.

“Forced dependency it is! I’m off to buy a phone then, wish me luck!”

Sirius shifted into Padfoot just as he heard Hedwig’s derisive hoot.

He didn’t care if Hedwig didn’t believe in his abilities to go purchase a muggle phone, he’d clearly already pulled off much more brilliant schemes recently so getting a phone was nothing.

Chapter Text

“Enhance audio,” Tony murmured. Leaning forward in his seat with his hands clenched tightly together in his lap, Tony watched the same scene again, this time with an audience to help him judge it without his incredibly heavy bias.

His heavy bias that meant this man on the screen, this man touching his son, was going to die in an incredibly painful and creative way if the guys all agreed with Tony’s initial analysis.

“Can’t you come with me?” Harry asked the man, his voice soft despite the slight static coming through the security footage.

“Planes are fun, don’t be worried. You’ll like flying. Plus, someone needs to stay here to keep You-Know-Who and You-Know-Who off your trail.”

“Pause,” Bruce said as Harry scoffed on the screen. He spun in his chair to face Tony, who was sitting in the back of the office with a dark expression on his face. “Who is ‘you-know-who’?”

Tony was too furious and anxious to even make the obvious joke there (‘you know’). He shrugged a shoulder, the movement uncomfortable with the stiffness he held himself and tried to control his tone while he explained what he did know.

“Harry has no criminal case, he’s been implicated in zero crimes, and isn’t even reported as a missing person,” Tony told Bruce, Steve, and Clint, the three members of his team that were home. “I think it’s bullshit, I think this fucking freak was feeding him a line to try and scare him.”

“What? ‘I’m keeping the cops off your trail so you owe me’?” Clint asked. He had his hands laced behind his head and a thoughtful expression on his face. “Harry seem like the kind of kid to fall for scare tactics like that?”

“Yes,” Tony and Steve said simultaneously.

“What?” Tony didn’t even have it in him to tease the captain for agreeing with him. “You do?”

Tony had gotten the distinct impression that Harry didn’t make a stellar first impression with the guys. It was a phenomenal performance, in Tony’s opinion, but they hadn’t came back to Tony’s floor and had made themselves sparse since Harry first met them a few days ago so he assumed that they didn’t agree.

Which made it a pretty damn quiet few days.

Tony thought that their shopping excursion would have shortened some of the distance between him and Harry, but he didn’t think it shortened it more than an inch.

And it was approximately 3,459 miles to start with, timed by every year that Harry lived as an orphan. So one inch versus 44,967 miles was a start, but a damned insignificant one.

Harry was quiet, withdrawn, nervous the whole time they were out. He’d lost his sarcastic front around the same time he’d thrown an apple at Tony’s head and wound up shattering the TV and never picked it back up until the next morning. As much as nobody else seemed to appreciate the act, Tony preferred the dry sarcasm over the anxious kid he spent the afternoon with.

When they got back to the tower, and Harry quickly thanked Tony for the clothes and phone he’d insisted he have, Tony went to his office to think while Harry hid away in his room.

And the more Tony thought, the more pissed off he became.

What looked like a bruise from a fight had a lot more grim implications when Tony paired it with the handprint shaped bruise on Harry’s upper arm that had been hidden beneath his hoodie for his first day. Tony moved those two pieces to the way his kid had complete freaked out over an obvious accident and immediately said how his ‘dangerous friend’ would kill Tony if Tony hurt Harry. He added another piece an hour later— Petunia Dursley hadn’t seen her nephew in years.

Tony had called her when he got back from shopping, after he’d been stewing in his curiosity and anger for a couple of hours, and she claimed that Harry had been taken ‘by friends of his parents’ when he was eleven, and that was why he never attended school and didn’t have so much as a single vaccination record on file past that age.

She’d also agreed to sign anything Tony wanted so he could claim custody. She’d been hesitant at first, but the heavy bribe that came along with the NDA she’d have to sign had cleared that right up.

The piece of the puzzle that Petunia Dursley gave Tony made an image that had him certain that he was going to transform into his own Hulk as furious as he’d been.

So, before he flew to London, found this piece of shit that Harry considered a friend and ripped the limbs off his body, Tony needed a second opinion. If only because he knew the team would help him make sure this was the most painful possible death in history once they saw what he did.

Steve was staring at Tony now, hesitancy written all over his eternally youthful face. “I wanted to come talk to you after you had some time alone with Harry, to get to know each other, but… but that kid is terrified of something, Tony.”

“I couldn’t agree more, Cap,” Tony said vehemently. He waved his hand at the screen and nodded toward it. “Watch and see what it is. Play.”

The four of them watched as the little scene continued in a London airport roughly four days ago.

All Tony had hoped to achieve by stealing and digging through the footage was some hint about Harry’s life, he didn’t expect the bombshell it exposed. He felt guilty exposing the kid’s secret like he was, even if it was to three people Tony trusted most in the galaxy, but he was going to need backup.

“What if he won’t help?” Harry was asking. “What if—”

Tony saw red when the scumbag put his hand on Harry’s shoulder, instantly causing his son to flinch, and tried to soothe his fears.

“Tony Stark’s a good guy, kiddo. He’s- he’s going to love you, I just know it. I bet he’ll be thrilled to find out he’s got such a brilliant son.”

Tony was thrilled to have a son. Tony was thrilled to have Harry as a son. Tony was not thrilled to have that piece of human garbage saying it to his son though.

“Pause,” Clint ordered it this time. He spun his chair in a complete circle before turning it to face Tony. “You think this guy is scaring the kid and singing both of your praises at the same time? Weird combo there.”

“Not if he wants something from Tony…” Bruce said slowly, thinking the situation through. He pulled his glasses off and looked over at Tony apologetically after running his hand down his face wearily. “I thought he was twitchy because of us, being in a new place and surrounded by new people, and the aliens, and all the other weird stuff, but…”

“But he was twitchy in London too,” Steve finished for him in a harder than typical tone. His expression wasn’t soft or tired at all, not like Bruce’s. Steve was obviously was growing more and more indignant by the moment and Tony thought maybe this would be the time that he convinced Mister ‘Justice for All’ to go dole out justice off the books with him.

“Play.”

“He’s not my dad—”

Tony was still too pissed and focused on the disgusting hand on his son’s shoulder to even acknowledge the phantom pain in his chest at Harry’s words.

“Blood doesn’t make family. Right?”

“Right.”

They watched the rest of the footage uninterrupted, and Tony’s blood pressure was at an all time high when he saw the adoring smile his son gave that man just before the man went to lift his arm, probably to wave back, and the footage cut out.

“‘Don’t kill any muggles while I’m gone, twelve was plenty’,” Bruce repeated Harry’s parting words after the screen smoothly slid back into the ceiling and the lights in the office kicked on. “What’s that mean?”

“No idea.” Tony put both his hands in his hair and tugged at it, frustrated and infuriated beyond all reason. “The only thing I can think of is it’s some sort of secret code, but Harry thinks that he’s dangerous, dangerous enough to kill someone for hurting him.”

“So the guy cares about the kid?” Clint said dismissively. “So what? Tony’d probably kill for him too and he barely knows the little dick.”

“Don’t call him a dick,” Tony spat angrily. “Something messed up happened to him, I just know it.”

He hadn’t known it, not really, because for a genius, he was apparently a moron. It was probably a good thing that Harry broke the TV because otherwise Tony never would have gotten to witness his mini-panic attack over it and a lot of shit wouldn’t have came into focus for him.

And suddenly all of Harry’s quirks, like his nonexistent eating and sleeping patterns, had a lot darker connotations to them.

Clint looked at Steve for backup, but Steve only shook his head at him. For once, he was firmly with Tony.

“Fine.” Clint sighed and kicked his chair in another circle. “I guess I’ll play devils advocate here since no one else is. Did someone smack the kid? Yeah. Do we know it was that guy? No. Did someone take the kid from his aunt a few years ago? Yeah. Do we know it was that guy? No.”

“You’re forgetting the fact that this man is, by Harry’s own accidental admissions, on the run from the law and clearly someone who knew Harry’s mom well enough to know that Tony was his father,” Bruce pointed out illogically. “If the aunt said it was one of Harry’s parents’ friends, this guy does seem the most likely.”

“That doesn’t prove he hurt the kid though,” Clint argued, really just pissing Tony off more. “Let’s say that Harry did really get in a fight—”

“With someone big enough to leave a giant handprint shaped bruise on his arm,” Tony snarled.

Clint stretched his neck and grimaced. “It could be a coincidence, is all I’m saying.”

“I think there’s reasonable suspicion for long term abuse,” Bruce said. He held his glasses in one hand while he had his face buried in the other. “Tony, I’m sorry, I just heard your attitude coming from the kid’s mouth and god knows he had a lot dropped on him, I didn’t…”

Tony waved him off, uninterested in apologies. “If you want to apologize, bring the big guy with me to London so we can pick this guy up and drop him, preferable from fifty feet up.”

Bruce lifted his head to smile wryly. “You want to go kill him because you think he’s been hitting Harry?”

“Nope.” Tony grabbed the packets he’d printed out and tossed a copy to each of the guys. “I am going to go kill him because I think he’s been grooming and molesting Harry for years.” Tony pointed at the packets when three shocked faces turned to him. “Gentlemen, meet Alexander Ramsey, two time convicted child molester and receiver of multiple counts of statutory rape of victims young enough that charges couldn’t stick.” Tony’s voice was shaking with fury when he added, “And guess what his victim preference is?”

Steve had already opened the packet and his eyes swore vengeance as he looked up from the first page, the photo of the man in the video putting his hand on Tony’s son’s shoulder.

“Prepubescent boys?”

“Prepubescent boys,” Tony agreed. “And now that Harry’s getting too old—”

“He’s manipulating Harry into helping him get the paperwork to flee the country before he gets caught,” Clint breathed, finally seeing the big fucking picture. “Fuck.”

“Fuck,” Tony agreed.

“So what are we doing?” Steve asked. “Call SHIELD and let them pick the guy up?”

“Fuck that.” Clint was on his feet and instinctually reaching for a weapon in an instant. “We get Natasha’s ass back here from Rome and we go kill the sick son of a bitch.”

In another historical moment, Steve didn’t even look poised to argue or correct anyone’s language. He looked every bit of his 95 years old as he stood up.

“Let’s do it,” he agreed. “Let’s keep that dirt ball from hurting any more kids.”

“Wait!” Bruce’s hands were trembling, but he didn’t look green yet, so Tony assumed he was still in thought mode instead of the currently more helpful ‘Hulk out and smash a mother fucker’ mode. “We can’t go yet, Tony.”

“We can,” Tony corrected him. “If we leave now, we can be in London and have enough time to kill Ramsey before Harry wakes up.”

“It’ll take longer than that and you know it,” Bruce said with an annoying amount of logic that just wasn’t needed in that moment. “When does Pepper get back?”

“Not for two days.”

“Let’s go then,” Bruce said. “Nat should be back tomorrow night, Pepper gets home the next day, then we can leave Pepper here with Harry so he isn’t alone while we’re gone. This city, hell the whole damn country, is new, do you really want to leave him here by himself?”

To kill a man who hurt him? Maybe.

“Two days,” Tony agreed after a moment of contemplation. “The second the girls are home, we’re finding that man and we are ripping him apart.”

 

It was a mark of their team strength, or some other sappy nonsense, that they all agreed.

Tony put a mental timer on Alexander Ramsey’s life and then jumped into planning mode with his three friends on how to help Harry in the meantime.

Chapter Text

Harry had protested when Tony bought him a phone, but he had to admit that texting Sirius was the funniest thing he’d ever done.

Sirius had called him the day before, apparently he really did get his letter delivered after a single night, and they had a brief conversation—

“How are things?”

“Fine. How are things there?”

“Terrific. You’re officially missing. There are search parties for you. I hexed Snape. Ron and Hermione are plotting ways to sneak out to try and find you. Hedwig misses you. Now give me something more than fine.”

“I broke his telly and he wasn’t pissed.”

“Why’d you break it?”

“It was an accident.”

“Sure.”

“It was. I miss you.”

“I miss you too, kiddo. You having fun at all?”

“No, can you send me money, please? If you can’t get it from my vault, I’ll pay you back.”

“Oh- hey, Molly’s coming, I gotta go. Love you, kiddo.”

Harry didn’t save his number, in case someone snooped through his phone, but he did text it.

This is called a text. Can you please send me money?

Then he got back a string of little images that made him grin as they were mostly dog ones with an odd heart tossed in the mix here and there.

 

Every morning since the ‘Telly Incident’, as Harry began referring to that day, Harry had sent Sirius a text, reminding him that he was alive, he didn’t forget about him, and to please send him money. And every morning Harry had gotten a random emoji or two back in return.

That morning it had been a boat and a spider.

The rest of his new routine was much less amusing. Harry usually got a shower, put on one of the many, many, sets of clothes that now filled his closet, and left his room only to have meals with Tony. It was awkward, almost painfully so, forcing himself to leave his quiet sanctuary and show up in the kitchen for whatever takeout Tony decided on, but Tony insisted and Harry wasn’t a complete moron. There was only so much pushback Harry could give before the man eventually snapped and Harry was determined to be gone before they reached that point. And if Harry was quiet and uneasy during their shared meals, then Tony seemed determined to ‘get to know each other’. So the last couple of days had been filled with Tony telling Harry about himself.

He talked about the schools he’d been to, the places he’d traveled, places he wanted to travel, his ‘teammates’, his inventions, and a little about his company. Harry listened without looking like he was listening and kept silent when Tony tried to ask Harry questions. So Harry expected they’d still be doing that when he got dressed and left his room to have breakfast.

Except it seemed like that routine was broken that morning…

“Morning, kid.” Tony was sitting on the kitchen counter, a pile of round donuts stacked on a plate on his lap, and smiled at Harry when he came out of his room. He waved a hand at the three men sitting at the counter, “You remember these lovely gentlemen, I’m sure.”

Harry did. He specifically remembered that the one named Clint, the actual trained killer, hadn’t seemed to like Harry much. Not that Harry tried to make him like him, since he wasn’t planning on sticking around, but a wandless teenage wizard versus an assassin wasn’t exactly good odds either.

“Morning,” Bruce, the one turned into a giant green ‘Hulk’ in the documentary they watched, said kindly. He hardly looked the part of a Hulk when he sat there with his wire-rimmed glasses and button up shirt. He looked like a normal bloke, a bit boring and a bit like a swot, but Harry had seen a much more docile looking man transform into a werewolf and nearly kill him before, so he didn’t judge books by their covers.

Bruce pushed the stack of pink boxes in front of him toward the opposite side of the counter. “Help yourself, Harry. If you like sprinkles though, you better get them before Steve does.”

Harry glanced toward Steve, the red and blue suit guy who was apparently quite a bit older than he looked, and saw that he had a towering pile of donuts with chocolate icing and yellow sprinkles on them.

“I don’t,” Harry said. He hesitated a safe distance away from the counter, debating on just turning around and staying in his room all day. It wasn’t as if he couldn’t entertain himself- cell phones were wicked cool and Harry wished all his friends had one. Not that he counted himself as someone with many friends, especially since Sirius’ letters had been blocked, but Ron and Hermione’s letters were nonexistent, but still… texting the twins would be fun.

His debate ended though when Tony hopped off the counter, grabbed an empty bar stool, moved it to the other side of the bar, and then sat right back down on the counter and resumed eating his breakfast. Harry assumed that was a pretty damn pointed command and sat on the edge of his seat.

“Everyone likes sprinkles,” Tony told Harry around a mouthful of the unsprinkled donut he was eating. “There’s a few raspberry filled ones in that bottom box, figured you’d like them.” He gave an exaggerated look of exasperation to Clint, “Harry’s favorite ice cream isn’t even brownie batter, absolute insanity, right?”

Clint grinned at Harry and leaned back in his seat. “So what you’re saying is that we can safely store chocolate around you?”

“I don’t think I said anything,” Harry pointed out. He slowly snagged the bottom box and opened it to find half a dozen identical donuts in there. He grabbed one and took a test bite and immediately decided that it was probably made with magic. He had taken a third bite before he realized that he was being stared at by the four guys and he immediately put the food down.

“Success!” Tony cried. “I knew you’d like them!”

Harry did like it, actually, then he felt his stomach knot as he realized that the three blokes across from him were still staring at him with weirdly intense faces. “Can I help you?” he asked them coolly.

“Actually, yes,” Steve said as the other two quickly looked back at their plates. “Do you have any plans today, Harry?”

Harry nodded.

“What?” Tony furrowed his brows. “Obviously you’re not a prisoner and you can make plans or whatever, but what’s on your agenda, kid?”

“Anything that doesn’t involve whatever he wants,” Harry told Tony seriously. “I’m thinking I could jump out that window, give free falling a real shot, and it would still be a much more important task.”

Tony smiled at him, thrilled as always with Harry’s poor attitude and hateful quips, but this time Clint, the same one who told him to shut up last time they met, also chuckled.

“You wouldn’t hit the ground, you’d just hit the tech net around the building and be sore as hell.”

“Interesting theory, I’ll remember that during my incredibly important test today.”

Harry had kept his muscles tensed, ready to move, but apparently he was funny today instead of ‘a dick’.

“Well if you’d rather hang out with an old man,” Steve gave Harry a self-deprecating smile, “I’ve got an event that would be much more tolerable with decent company.”

“Perhaps you should find some then,” Harry said, wondering why anyone thought he would be decent company. He took another bite of his donut and raised a brow when Steve just continued to smile at him.

“That’s not a bad idea,” Tony said brightly, immediately snapping Harry’s eyes to the traitor. “I’ve got to get some work done before Pepper gets home tomorrow and tears me a new one, and not in the fun way either.”

“There’s a fun way?” Harry asked, hiding his genuine curiosity behind sarcasm. He hadn’t meant to ask, but spending time around the man recently must have loosened his tongue.

Tony perked up and swung a donut around. “Oh, kid, trust me, there’s—”

Bruce tapped the counter with his mug of coffee. “Tony…” he said in a warning type of tone.

Tony stopped mid-sentence and suddenly grimaced in an oddly apologetic sort of way. “The point was, that I’m going to be in the lab all day, kid, so you should go with Cap, get some fresh air.”

Harry looked distrustfully between Tony and Steve and grimaced as well- not apologetically, though, but more irritably. “I’ll open a window.”

“Harry,” Steve looked entirely too solemn for the current conversation, “if you’re afraid to go with me, you don’t have to. It might be good for you to get out of the tower though.”

Suddenly two sides of Harry’s brain began fighting with one another—

There was the side that was pissed at being told what would ‘be good for him’. Then there was the side that was pissed about the implication that Harry was afraid of someone else.

Even if Steve could kill Harry with a well-aimed blow, it wasn’t as if Harry had given him a reason to think that he was worried about such a thing.

“Brilliant,” Harry grit out through a clenched jaw, “where are we going?”

 

Steve tried to chat Harry up while he drove, mostly talking about… about stranger danger and feelings… which was incredibly peculiar. Harry was bemused, but ignored him in favor of checking his phone for messages from Sirius.

Sirius sent Harry a bomb, Harry sent back a hand with the middle finger raised. Sirius then sent a sad face, so Harry sent back an innocent little angel.

 

“You’re bloody joking.” Harry nearly laughed when they pulled up to an animal shelter. He could see the large sign with the kitten photo on it, but he also saw what looked like an entire fleet of vans with various news logos on them, a bounce house, various other carnival like booths, and what seemed to be like nearly a thousand people milling around the large fenced in grounds; all laughing, running, and playing with animals that ran wild.

Harry turned to look at Steve, who was in his full superhero costume, and knew that his surprise and lack of displeasure was surely on complete display. “What’s this?”

Steve smiled beneath his helmet and opened the middle console between their seats. “It’s a fundraiser for the animal shelter. I like animals so I told them I’d show up today.”

“And bring a crowd?” Harry guessed wryly. He eyed the news vans suspiciously. Would anyone recognize the missing boy who lived on the American muggle news?

“Here.” Steve pulled a pair of mirrored dark sunglasses from the console and a black baseball cap. “You look just like your dad, kid. You get seen with Captain America and people are going to draw the connection. He’s not ashamed of you,” Steve added quickly, “it’s just dangerous for people to know and I’m sure he wants to announce it somehow first. Get ahead of the media before it makes you miserable, you know?”

As if Harry were new to the media making him miserable.

Harry accepted the hat and glasses gratefully, but he did narrow his eyes at Steve from behind them. “Tony’s my biological father, not my dad.”

Steve didn’t seem offended, and people spotted the shield strapped to the top of his car, so their conversation ended there.

 

Harry didn’t want to be enjoying the ‘fresh air’ he had effectively been forced to be out in, but…

But puppies.

 

Harry was actually in a type of heaven as he stayed away from the large crowds of people and found an entire family of puppies that were eager to pile up on him. Harry had tried to take a video for Sirius, thinking he’d like to see Harry get attacked by a group of over eager puppies, but then one of the puppies licked his phone and caused Harry to let out a loud peal of laughter, so he quickly ended the video.

At one point, Harry even braved the crowds in order to grab some lunch with the cash Tony gave him before he left (it came with strict orders to ‘eat something, skinny’). He quickly retreated back to the side of the field where nobody besides the dogs seemed to be and he settled in for sharing his lunch with the puppies that had taken a shining to him.

“You guys are shameless,” Harry said fondly as he played tug of war with his hat with one of the more spunky pups. This one had a glimmer of mischief in its black eyes as it growled and yanked on Harry’s hat. Harry would have compared it to Padfoot, except this dog was tiny, it’s fur was a mixture of brown and black patches, and didn’t generally look like it could rip Harry’s leg off in one bite.

“I’m calling you Arsehole,” Harry warned the puppy when he finally ripped his hat from its mouth. He winced when he saw the chew marks on the side of it. “If I get in trouble for that, don’t think I’m not blaming you,” he warned the dog.

The dog didn’t look scared at all.

“Arsehole is a cool name, but I usually call that one Joey.”

Harry had been so distracted by the six puppies that were growling and playing and attacking him with their tongues that he didn’t even notice when a guy approached him. Harry put ‘Joey’ down immediately, letting him run off to his siblings, and eyed the guy quickly.

He was young, probably about Harry’s age if not a year or two older. He had an easy smile on his handsome face, shaggy dark brown hair, and had a camera in his hands that instantly made Harry bristle.

“Hey, I’m Peter,” he said. He held a hand out to Harry.

Harry scoffed and ignored his hand. “Arsehole is a better name for him than Joey,” he said, referring to the dog.

Peter laughed and sank down to sit on the ground, instantly finding himself with a lap full of puppies; except for ‘Joey’, who Harry was pleased to see was instead clawing at Harry’s own ankles, trying to reclaim his attention.

“Not the camera, guys,” Peter cried with another laugh as the dogs instantly started trying to steal it from him. He held it up and watched as he dogs began leaping on their tiny legs to try and get it from him. “German Shepherds are geniuses,” he said, to Harry apparently, “but they’re also total dicks. That one there, Joey the Arsehole, is the worst of them.”

As if proving his point, Joey growled at him.

Harry grinned and sat back down, content that Peter wasn’t actually a reporter as he initially thought. “You work here then?” Harry asked as Joey reclaimed Harry’s lap and started trying to snatch the sunglasses right off his face.

“I volunteer sometimes,” Peter shrugged. “I’m supposed to be taking photos of Captain America vaccinating kittens, but you looked more interesting.”

Harry scowled and then glanced toward where the largest group of people were. They were surrounded in and around a tent that he assumed Steve was in. “Vaccinating kittens? They brought a superhero here to give shots?”

Peter laughed again, and Harry got the impression he was rather easy going in general. A bit like Ron, except… except he didn’t quite look like Ron at all.

“Sounds stupid, doesn’t it?” he grinned. “It’s just a publicity stunt. Bring ‘em here to see Captain America, then try and get them to adopt a pet or donate to the shelter.”

Harry didn’t think that sounded stupid at all- it sounded like a clever plan, and he said so.

“Thanks,” Peter smirked a little, “it was mine.”

Harry grinned, “Clever plans, shit naming skills.”

“One guy can’t be great at everything,” Peter said seriously. “You could always adopt Joey, name him what you want. He doesn’t respond to Joey anyway.”

Harry smiled ruefully as he scratched Joey’s ears. “I can’t, I’m, er… I’m not going to be in town long.”

“Going back to England soon?”

Harry head snapped up instantly and Joey whined. “How’d you know where I’m from?”

Peter quirked a brow and smirked, a good look for him really. “The accent gave you away, man.”

“Oh.” Harry shrugged, that made sense. Personally though, he thought everyone else had the odd accents. He averted his eyes and went back to playing with the dog. “Dunno yet, we’ll see.”

“Well if you change your mind, Joey could use a new home.” Peter plucked up one of the puppies and held it beside him while he made big pouting eyes at Harry. “Think of the animals, they need you to stay in New York and adopt them all.”

Harry laughed at his antics and shook his head. “We’ll see,” he said evasively, knowing it was pointless. He’d be leaving soon.

But maybe Sirius would want to adopt a puppy when they got settled somewhere?

The two of them chatted easily, and Harry did eventually tell him his first name, while they played with the litter of puppies. Peter talked about his school, he’d be a junior in the fall. He talked about his classes a little, his ‘side gig’ as a ‘freelance photographer’ and the other animals he helped take care of at the shelter.

Harry talked about nothing- he merely listened.

“Oh, man,” Peter groaned when the first chords of a band struck up. He pet the sleeping puppy in his lap once more and then stood up. “I should probably go take photos, I promised I’d have some for the website about the event.”

“Have fun,” Harry murmured. He spotted Steve at the front of the building, obviously trying to make his way to the car and figured that was his cue as well. He gave Joey a last sad little pat and imagined he was as disappointed that Harry was leaving as Harry was.

“You could always come back and see him,” Peter offered, probably seeing the pathetic goodbye Harry shared with the dog. “Oh! Hold on!”

Harry watched curiously as Peter dug in his jean pockets for a scrap of lined notebook paper. He scribbled something on it quickly then handed it to Harry with a crooked grin.

“My number,” he explained as Harry took the paper and looked at it. “Text me and I’ll send you the pictures I got of you when you weren’t paying attention. And I’ll text you the next time I’m headed here, if you aren’t back in England.”

Harry laughed and pocketed the paper with only a slight blush on his cheeks. “Alright then,” he agreed.

“See you later, Harry,” Peter said with a cheery salute. He turned and ran off toward the tent that the music came from while Harry curiously watched him go.

“Bye, Arsehole,” Harry said with a last scratch to Joey’s head as he trudged off toward the car he arrived in with his head ducked and the ball cap pulled low.

He certainly wasn’t going to admit it, but it had actually been a decent way to spend an afternoon.

 

They drove past Peter when they left and Harry smirked at him through the window when he stopped his skateboard to gawk at Harry in the passenger seat with ‘Captain America’.

“Friend of yours?” Steve asked when Harry smirked back at Peter and they left him laughing in the rear view mirror.

Harry shrugged and felt his neck heat up as he thought about the number he had tucked in his jeans pocket.

Chapter Text

“My favorite son and my least favorite superhero!” Tony jumped up from the couch and smiled when Harry and Steve returned to the tower. Steve was still in full getup, looking ridiculous as usual, but Harry had a small pep to his step that made Tony’s forced smile feel more genuine.

Tony hadn’t exactly been on board with the whole ‘take Harry out of the tower and into a possible media circus’ plan, but Bruce said the last thing Harry needed was to be isolated all the time, so he gave it a shot. And he didn’t really expect Harry to run into any real problems at a charity gig, but it hadn’t stopped him from keeping all twelve news channels running simultaneous broadcastings while he tried to focus in the lab either.

And now it seemed like he owed Bruce a thank you for the idea. He wouldn’t tell him, but that didn’t mean he didn’t owe it to him.

“How’d it go?” Tony asked them. He didn’t miss the way Harry was obviously trying to get to his room, but Tony hoped he’d humor him anyway.

Harry paused by the door and shrugged, his favorite method of communication. “Fine.”

Tony sighed and turned to Steve when Harry immediately slipped in his room and closed the door behind him. Steve didn’t look putout by Harry’s never ending reticence though, he had a slight grin on his lips and a little twinkle in his eyes.

“He might not like us yet, but he clearly doesn’t have problems making other friends,” Steve said. He gently placed his shield against the wall and took a seat in one of the recliners. “I think he befriended an entire litter of dogs and another kid that was working the event.”

“Really?” Tony perked up from his brief disappointment in Harry’s silence. Tony was annoyed he hadn’t considered that Harry would be more comfortable around someone his own age, probably someone he didn’t think would leave god damned bruises on him or hurt him in other ways. “Jarvis! Send me a list of all volunteers at the Queens Animal Shelter.”

“Tony…”

“Full background checks, contact info, family history, the works, Jarvis,” Tony continued, ignoring Steve’s feeble protest completely. “If they have social media, I want the links. If they wet themselves in kindergarten, I want the reports.”

“Very good, sir,” Jarvis said. “I’ve downloaded the files to your phone.”

Tony shot a smirk at Steve as he relaxed back in his seat. “This is parenting of the future, Cap. Get to know your kid’s friends before they even bring them home.”

“Nice,” Steve sighed with a roll of his eyes, “invade some kid’s privacy because you don’t want to just ask Harry about his friend.”

“You think he’d tell me?”

“Not a chance in hell,” Steve snorted.

Tony pointed his finger at him, “Exactly.”

They sat in silence for a few minutes, both probably thinking about Harry’s secrecy and all his other odd little quirks that were probably side-effects of some pervert grooming him for the last four years, until Steve sat up quickly and snapped Tony from his thoughts.

“You should get him a dog,” Steve said quickly with an enthusiastic look on his face. “Dogs are good for people with trauma in their lives, there’s a bunch of guys down at the veterans center that have them. Harry can take care of it and do stuff like walking it, getting him out of the tower every day, and it would be great for him! And I’m telling you, Tony, you should have seen Harry, he spent the whole time there buried under puppies.”

Tony didn’t coo, because Tony Stark did not coo, but it definitely was a sweet sight to imagine.

“And you didn’t get any pictures as proof!” Tony cried. “That’s it. I’m installing a camera in your helmet. Jarvis! I want all the news coverage of the event sent to me.”

“Very good, sir.”

“Traitor,” Tony accused Steve half-heartedly. “There better be a photo somewhere of the kid in a puppy pile. Why didn’t you pull the beloved hero act and just steal a dog for him while you were there?”

“My mistake,” Steve grinned. He got to his feet and snagged his shield as he moved to the elevator doors. “Dinner here tonight?”

“It’s Sunday,” Tony said as a way of response.

They usually always had dinner together on Sundays. It had been Steve’s idea at first, a ‘team bonding’ thing, but Tony had to admit it was one of his better ones. They usually ordered wings, beer, and watched a game or played cards for a few hours. Tony certainly wasn’t going to tell them, but by the time Friday rolled around and Tony wanted to pull his hair out from work, he looked forward to Sunday nights.

He imagined it would be that much better to include his own kid in their weird ritual.

Tony waved Steve off as he left and then wondered what to do… he could go work on the glitch in the StarkCars that Mark kept calling him about, or he could go ask Harry if he wanted a dog…

“Kids like dogs, right?” Tony asked of no one as he got up from his seat.

“Statistically speaking, sir, 42% of American households have both a pet and at least one child.”

“Perfect,” Tony grinned. “Thanks, Jarvis, time to make this tower the perfect American family.”

Y’know… with the genius father with an arc reactor in his chest keeping him alive, the eccentric aunts and uncles who happen to be Earth’s mightiest superheroes, and the British teenage boy with a shady past and a fervent desire to run away to Russia with a pedophile.

A dog would really just be the cherry on top of the shit pile of a family unit they represented.

Tony knocked lightly on Harry’s door and waited until he gave him the clear to open it. Harry was sitting on the edge of his bed, toying with the phone that Tony all but twisted his arm into getting.

Harry had turned it down, but Tony insisted.

First off, the single argument Tony used against Harry in the story, it was a crime to be a teenager in a first world country without a cell phone. Tony was pretty sure there were laws against it somewhere.

Secondly, it had tracking tech in it and Tony wasn’t letting his son go anywhere without at least one way to track him. Paranoid? Maybe. According to Bruce, severely. But Bruce had never been kidnapped by terrorists, so he could kindly go fuck himself.

And thirdly, and most importantly, Harry was in constant contact with an unlisted number and Tony was positive it Alexander Ramsey.

If the kid was going to be texting a pedophile, you could be damn sure that Tony was going to be watching that communication with laser focus. He’d debated on blocking the number, but then Harry might talk to him somehow in a way he couldn’t monitor. All they’d sent back and forth so far were a few pleads from Harry for money and a string of coded emojis.

Tony was going to try and figure out what a sailboat and a spider meant right before he ripped Ramsey’s arms off his body.

“Hey, kid.” Tony leaned himself against the wall in the doorway, leaving plenty of space between himself and his skittish son. “Heard you befriended a bunch of wild animals today.”

Harry made a face and stuck his phone under his leg along with a scrap of paper. “You have your team of bloody killers, I have mine. Mine are cuter, to be sure, but I like our odds against you useless lot.”

“Hey, I’ll have you know that I am perfectly adorable as well as completely useless,” Tony said as he pointed at Harry with a smirk. “Bruce? Not so adorable. But he looks way better when he’s all hulked out and smashing shit.”

Harry didn’t laugh, but he looked like he wanted to, so Tony gave himself a mental pat on the back before he brought up the whole pet thing.

“You have a dog back in London?” he asked, extremely casually.

The edge of Harry’s lips curled up in a slight smile. “My friend does,” he said, missing Tony’s wince at the reminder of his ‘friend’. “A big black dog, looks mean as hell, but he’s a soft little prat really.”

“Yeah?” Tony raised his brows and crossed his arms. “You know, you could have a dog here, if you wanted. We already have a Clint, what’s one more dog? Plus, maybe we can house-train them at the same time.”

Harry ignored his joke and the smile he had slipped right off his face in favor of his usual suspicious frown. “How much longer d’you think I’ll be here?”

Forever.

No big deal.

“Hard telling,” Tony said evasively. “Super illegal brand new identities aren’t created in a day, you know.”

As if Tony would let his kid go gallivanting off to Russia with a pervert. And since Petunia Dursley would be signing over her rights first thing in the morning, it wasn’t as if Harry had a lot of places to go. And it wasn’t like Tony wanted him to go anywhere else anyway. Harry could stay there, with him, become a normal moody teenager instead of a- a traumatized moody teenager. Tony could keep him safe, put him in school, and they’d eventually be like every other parent and child.

Sort of.

Harry stared at Tony hard for a moment before he accepted his words with a curt nod.

“Seems like a waste to get a dog if I’d just have to leave it behind,” he then said evenly.

Tony held back a grin at the brief flash of longing in Harry’s eyes even as he dismissed the offer. “New plan, we go back to that flea infested animal shelter, you pick out a little furry beast, and then you take it with you when you leave. If that’s to college or Russia, or college in Russia, so be it.”

Harry blinked at him for a second. “Look, you keep saying shit as if you think I’m staying, but I’m telling you I’m not. I’m not leaving my friend behind. He’s my family.”

Tony wasn’t offended that his son preferred a family made up on a pedophile over himself because that disgusting freak had been grooming him for years, ever since Harry’s idiot aunt let him take Tony’s son from her, and Harry had only known Tony for less than a week. He’d win the kid over eventually.

And he’d start with a dog, damn it.

“Hey, I’m not saying abandon anyone,” Tony held his hands up innocently. “I’m just saying, I think what this house needs is something besides Clint to chew up all my wires. What do you say, kid? Want to begin this beautiful journey of adoption together?”

Harry opened his mouth, then his phone dinged, and Tony lost his attention entirely. Which would have been such a wondrously normal teenage interaction if Tony wasn’t positive that it was Ramsey sending his son a text.

Harry read the text, squinted at it, then turned the screen off and gave Tony a hesitant look. “What’s lol?”

“What?”

“A word,” Harry drawled, arrogantly acting like Tony was the one who needed something explained to him—

Like father, like son.

“If someone said ‘didn’t think you would’ followed by ‘L-O-L’, what’s that mean?”

“Oh,” Tony chuckled, “it means ‘laugh out loud’, like something was funny.”

Harry’s brows pinched together just as Tony’s did when he was puzzling through something. Further needless proof that Harry was his kid. “You sure? Because it wasn’t really a funny message.”

Tony shrugged, “That’s the only ‘lol’ I know of, kid.”

Harry hummed and seemed content to stare deadpan at Tony, probably prompting him to leave.

“Alright, alright, I’m headed to my office,” he said. It wasn’t as if a single afternoon spend with dogs and Captain America would somehow make Harry like spending time with him. “The team is all joining us for dinner tonight, you like wings?”

“No.”

“I’ll get you pizza then,” Tony grinned. “It’s a family dinner thing, stupid really, an idea of Steve’s obviously. We do it every week; eat, make a bunch of noise, play cards, make fun of Bruce, try to get him to hulk out. It’s pretty obnoxious, kid, you’ll love it.”

Harry looked like he was inclined to disagree. “Wicked, I’ll stay in here then.”

“Or you can play cards?” Tony offered brightly. “Family dinner means sullen teenage sons too.”

Harry blinked, then gave him a withering look. “I’m not bloody staying,” he said harshly again. “Quit trying.”

Never.

“Sure,” Tony winked. “I’ll be in my office until then if you need me. Stay out of trouble, or at least be really good at not getting caught.”

Harry snorted and Tony pat himself on the back once again.

His own parents had made parenting seem exhausting, too exhausting to even try their hands at, but it was easy. Just let the kid do what he wants, kill the people who hurt him, and take him to get a puppy.

Easy.

 

Tony pulled his own phone out of his pocket the second he shut Harry’s door. He impatiently pulled open the program tracking Harry’s texts and stopped mid-stride at what he saw.

The recent messages were with a Queens area code, not the pedophile at all. And Harry had text it first…

Hey, it’s Harry.

A kid of few words even over text. And then the mystery person had sent a single reply, the text that sidetracked Tony’s own conversation with the kid.

Hey! Glad u text me, I didn’t think you would lol

Tony waited until he was in his office to investigate further. “Jarvis, run this number: 917 538 9110.”

“The number is registered to a May and Ben Parker of Queens, and is used by their nephew, Peter Parker,” Jarvis responded after a quick moment. “Peter’s details are already in your inbox, sir. He is one of the volunteers at the Queens Animal Shelter.”

“What would I do without you, buddy?” Tony grinned as he pulled open his inbox and filtered through his requests to find the full report on this Peter.

Peter Parker, 16 years old, DOB: August 10, 2001. Born to Richard and Mary Parker, both deceased.

Tony read through the kid’s report and felt a weight lighten off his chest.

This was just some kid. His kid’s first New York friend.

“This is how it starts, Jarvis,” Tony said cheerfully. “First he makes a friend, then we kill that piece of human garbage, then he gets a dog, and then he stays forever and it’s happily ever after for the Stark family.”

“If you say so, sir.”

“I do,” said Tony firmly. “We’re going to make him happy and willing to stay or die trying. Oh! Speaking of which! Send a lawyer over on Wednesday so I can update my will and finalize the paperwork on Harry’s custody details, will you?”

“Very good, sir. I also have a call for you from Mister Mark Lee.”

“You sure know how to ruin a mood,” Tony sighed. He threw himself petulantly in his chair behind his desk and rolled his eyes up to the ceiling. “Patch him through, let’s hear what the new problem on the car is today.”

 

Apparently the navigation system kept catching fire every time an address was typed into it.

Which, as Tony tried to point out, was really only a problem if you didn’t know where you were going.

 

Tony spent a few hours on his computer, intently caught up in the program for the StarkCar. He knew there had to be a way to reconfigure the navigation bug out of the system. He was playing with the code in his head as he counted the figures on the screen when Jarvis interrupted him.

“Sir?”

“What?” Tony snapped, his mind still running the code over and over in his head, looking for the misplaced figure that had to be causing the glitch. If he didn’t get it figured out quickly, then the release was going to be pushed off again and he wasn’t dealing with Mark’s constant complaints for another month.

“Miss Romanov is home.”

“Cool,” Tony muttered distractedly. “If I move the seven down by the first bundle of two’s will that fix the problem?”

“It will not, sir, I believe it will simply reset the system to automatically set the language systems to French every time the horn is deployed.”

Tony sighed, that was what he figured. He knew it would either fix it or fuck it up more in an entirely different way.

“And, as you asked me to keep track of Mister Harry, I thought you may want to know that Miss Romanov is currently fighting with him in the kitchen now, sir.”

Tony’s head snapped up and he was out of his office in an instant, fire catching smart cars entirely forgotten.

Chapter Text

Sunday, June 12

The next time Tony tried to talk Harry into leaving his room, ‘hanging out with the guys’, Harry was going to remind him of this.

It had been innocent, mostly. Harry crept quietly from his room to the kitchen to steal a drink, content that nobody was around yet to see him, maybe even snag a snack from the now fully stocked cabinets that he could eat instead of wings and pizza, and what happened?

He got attacked by a psychotic redhead.

Harry had barely begun digging through the pantry, curious about some of the labels for food that he’d never even heard of before, when someone grabbed him by the back of his shirt and spun him around to slam him against the cabinet. He hit his head on the wood hard enough to see a few stars in his eyes, but it wasn’t as if he hadn’t been hurt worse before then.

“Who are you?” the psychotic redhead in question demanded.

Harry didn’t struggle in the iron grip she had on his shoulders, pinning him in place, though he did pale at the look of single minded fury in her eyes. He opened his mouth to tell her his name, but no sound came out.

“Who let you in here?” she yelled. She shook Harry’s shoulders, only heightening his inner terror. He had seen this woman in the documentary thing before, ‘Black Widow’. She was the other assassin that Tony said lived in the tower.

Aka: she was another person who could kill him instantly.

As suddenly mute as Harry found himself verbally, he was mentally cursing Sirius out for letting him travel to New York without so much as his bloody wand.

“Who sent you?” She shook him again and Harry lost his grip on the can of soda he had. He let it slip from his fingers and it burst open in a spray of brown foam that the psycho didn’t even seem to acknowledge as she undoubtedly planned the best way to beat answers out of Harry’s non-working throat.

Harry was so entirely focused on keeping his teeth from chattering from the way the (supposed) hero woman shook him that he entirely missed Tony running in the room until a quiet whoosh sound triggered a burst of light that struck the refrigerator a few inches to the right of Harry and it immediately began smoking.

“Next one won’t miss,” Tony snapped at the psycho with a hard look on his face. “Drop my son, now, Natasha.”

“Son?” The woman, Natasha, apparently, immediately let go of Harry’s shoulders and took a quick step away from him, leaving Harry free to slide to the floor as his legs decided to no longer support him. “When did you get a son, Stark?”

Harry twisted his head to gape at the sizzling hole that was burnt right through the thick metal door of the refrigerator.

“Hey, kid, Harry, you good?”

Harry turned toward Tony’s voice and jolted to the side as Tony had somehow moved the length of the kitchen and knelt down right in front of him without Harry noticing. He reached out for Harry’s head and Harry ducked it automatically to keep him from making contact.

People shouldn’t be allowed to move so quietly, it was disconcerting after spending his life with the Dursleys who practically shook the house every time they so much as breathed.

Harry jerked his chin up in a nod when it seemed like Tony wanted an answer. He reached up for the cabinet handle and used it to pull himself to his feet. He grimaced at the sticky brown liquid staining both his jeans and the floor.

“I’ll clean that,” Harry said quickly, his voice finally returning to him. It was a bit hoarse and shaky, but he doubted if anyone noticed.

Harry looked around the room quickly, curious now about where the cleaning supplies were. Ever since he first snapped off at Tony that he didn’t know how to cook or clean, nobody had insisted and Harry had been bloody relieved to not touch a spatula or broom during his stay there.

“Where’s- where’s a mop?” Harry asked Tony, ignoring the gawking psycho while keeping her in his line of sight.

“Don’t worry about it,” Tony straightened up too and tucked the silver square he had shot the laser thing from in his equally stained jeans pocket. “I’ve got a robot that cleans.”

Harry stopped looking for a cleaning cupboard of some sort. “A- a robot that cleans?“

“Yup.” Tony grinned at Harry and whistled sharply, “Harry, meet your brother, CHOW. You’re my favorite, of course, but he was here first.”

Harry watched as a cabinet door slid open and a little round metal contraption whizzed out of it and immediately moved to the puddle of spilled soda. Tony reached down and grabbed the can and they watched as the machine buzzed around and left spotless tile beneath it as it cleaned.

Harry edged out of the mess; he had to choose between stepping over beside Tony or putting himself closer to the psycho and Tony was obviously the lesser of two evils as he hadn’t even bat an eye over Harry pouring soda all over the place.

“Chow?” Harry repeated the name of the robot. “What’s a Chow?”

Tony chuckled when he glanced down at Harry’s passively curious face. “C-H-O-W, because he’s for ‘Cleaning the House Or Whatever’.”

Harry didn’t grin, mostly because the psycho was still staring at him like he was the one attacking fourteen year olds looking for food, but he was fondly reminded of Hermione trying to steamroll House Elf freedom with a club named SPEW.

“Hello, sweet father-son nerd-family moment, someone want to take some time to fill me in on what the fuck is going on?”

Harry glanced up at the psycho who now had her leather jacket covered arms crossed tightly and was tapping a black leather boot irritably on the floor. He quickly averted his eyes as hers were far too curious as they bore into his.

“I’m gonna…”

“Wait!” Tony spoke up as Harry was trying to slip back to his room. Harry flinched a little, he blamed his still racing heart and the fact he had just been attacked over a bloody snack (was that the first time that happened in his life? No, but for some reason he hadn’t been expecting it to happen there. Which was stupid, but he knew better now.).

Harry turned his head to Tony and gave him a silent and questioning look. Either he was pissed about the snack and soda thing, or he wasn’t.

“You good?”

Apparently he wasn’t.

Harry refrained from shooting a dirty look at the psycho, certain that if his mere presence had set her off once, then a mean look would do it twice. He unconsciously raised his hand to his head, smoothing down his hair and feeling for a bump, and raised his shoulders. “Fine,” he answered shortly.

Tony looked like he didn’t believe him, but that was too damn bad because Harry was fine.

“Sure,” Tony said skeptically. “Well the guys will be here in about ten minutes, so why don’t you go change and I’ll fill Nat in on why we don’t shake our family and give her your dry cleaning bill?”

Harry wasn’t entirely sure that was a joke, and he didn’t actually want the psycho to have more of a reason to be pissed at him, but Tony did pay for Harry’s jeans so he could do what he wanted, he supposed. Personally, he’d be more concerned about the smoldering refrigerator, but Tony didn’t even give it a second glance.

“Great,” he said flatly with a quick glance towards ‘Nat’. “I’ll go do that then.”

“Family dinner in ten!” Tony yelled as Harry quickly made his way to his room.

“Great,” Harry repeated before he carefully closed his door.

Dinner with the guy who kept trying to talk Harry into abandoning Sirius, the team of deadly superheroes, and the psycho.

‘Great’.

 

Harry decided that a hot shower would be a quick way to force his heart to beat slower. He regret it almost immediately when he’d lifted his head to the spray and felt his face crumple.

It was stupid, because he really was fine, not even hurt at all, but… but it was as if he’d been waiting to release his misery and the psycho had just been the trigger to do so.

He was grateful that it didn’t happen until he was safely in the shower with the water drowning out the pathetic noise he made. Once he started, he sank to the floor of the unreasonably large bath/shower, it was a faucet he couldn’t turn off. So Harry did what he always did when everything was overwhelming, he ducked his head to his knees and rode it out.

He missed Sirius. He missed Ron and Hermione, their unwritten letters aside. He missed Hedwig.

And he had no idea what the fuck he was doing in New York with Tony anymore.

He didn’t want to talk about pets and family dinners and college or have someone shoot a deadly laser at a psycho on his behalf when he couldn’t stay. He didn’t know what Tony wanted when he said all that weird shit about Harry staying forever and them being a family, but there was surely more of a catch than just losing Sirius.

Even though Harry couldn’t imagine a worst catch than that.

Sirius couldn’t come to New York, not as a free man. And Harry wasn’t going to ask him to go anywhere that he couldn’t be free. Sirius got Harry free- free from the war, free from the Dursleys -Harry would do the same for him.

He just wished it wasn’t beginning to feel so hard to do. Even if there were ulterior motives somewhere, it felt a lot like a starving man turning down a hot meal every time Harry had to remind Tony that he wasn’t staying and playing family with him and his friends.

Then he felt guilty, because he wasn’t a starving man in that scenario, he had a family already and his family had done a damn sight more for him than anyone else had ever bothered to do.

Then he was pissed at Tony for trying to bribe him into leaving that family. Then he was pissed at himself for leaving behind his friends. Then he was stressed as he thought about what the war he cowardly fled from looked like, and then, and then, and then.

It was no wonder it had only taken a hard shake to set him off. He was probably lucky that he’d avoided curling up in the puddle of soda and having a whole breakdown while Tony saw what a nutter Harry was.

 

Eventually, as it always happened, Harry got control of himself and was able to stand up and finish showering without any more delays.

He was a bit past the ten minutes he’d been given, but he had purposefully stalled until he felt like his eyes weren’t too embarrassingly red and swollen.

Was Harry thrilled to see Steve, Bruce, the assassin who maybe hated him or maybe didn’t, and the assassin who definitely hated him and was a bloody psychopath all immediately turn toward him when he stepped in the room? Not at all.

Was Harry incredibly surprised to see a huge round wooden dining table in the middle of the sitting room instead of the posh and sleek leather furniture that usually filled it? Very much so.

It was that aggravation and surprise that led Harry to taking a hasty step backward and bumping into his closed door when ‘Natasha/Nat the Black Widow Psychopath’ jumped from her chair and moved toward Harry.

“Hey, Harry, right?” She didn’t seem angry at all anymore, so Harry assumed that Tony explained that Harry was actually a guest who was supposedly allowed to wander freely about the tower. “I make a shit first impression, I’m Natasha, you are allowed to call me Nat, if you want.” She offered Harry her hand with an exaggerated slowness that made Harry wonder if she thought he was afraid of her over something so minor.

“I don’t,” he said coolly. He held her gaze as long as he was able, which wasn’t all that long as there was some look in her eyes too similar to pity that made him uncomfortable, before he looked toward the new table in the sitting room again.

Bruce must have picked up on Harry’s curiosity because he explained while the psycho (she smacked his head off the cupboard and made him feel stupid, he wasn’t calling her ‘Nat’) moved back to her seat with a frown.

“This usually stays on my floor, I like to work at a table and Tony hates to have it take up an entire room, but we move it up here on Sunday evenings.”

Harry nodded slowly while he stared at what was undoubtedly a heavy, not to mention bulky, piece of furniture with eight heavy looking chairs to match. “I don’t suppose you considered eating on your floor instead of moving the table?”

Tony, who had been sliding stacks of colorful boxes to everyone and shooting Harry annoyingly ‘concerned’ glances when he thought Harry wasn’t looking, chuckled quietly.

“Bruce’s place is a mess, Steve’s OCD, Nat and Clint aren’t always here on Sundays, and Pepper rarely stays here unless she’s working late,” he said. He slid a few boxes to an empty seat, one across from him but without anyone on either side of it, and looked up to smile at Harry. “Take a seat, kid. Join the fun.”

Harry sat, ignoring the obvious looks they all kept giving him. Or, trying to anyway, until he snapped off at Clint’s scrutinizing look.

“Do I have something on my face?” Harry asked him.

Clint shrugged and tossed Harry a grin before he opened one of the boxes Tony slid him. “I heard we’re getting a dog,” he said casually, apparently deigning to not answer Harry’s sarcastic question. “I just wondered if it’s bark would be as bad as it’s bite.”

Harry furrowed his brows and tried to puzzle through that cryptic remark (he was not getting a dog because he didn’t even know if he could take the bloody thing to Russia and it would probably chew up a cord, just as Tony said, and Harry’d be in a ton of trouble for it) when Tony distracted him.

“Harry, you like beer?”

And then Harry didn’t get a chance to even respond before the psycho laughed from where she sat beside Clint.

“He’s like twelve, Tony,” she snickered. “Jesus.”

“I’m going to be fifteen in July,” Harry snapped at her, subtly sliding back in his seat when she turned to him with her dark brows raised. He didn’t break eye contact this time though, feeling mildly more secure as he doubted if she’d attack him in front of the guy who nearly blew a hole in her head.

“You’re short,” she finally said. “Why?”

Harry quirked a brow. “You’re a bitch, why?”

Why… why… why… could Harry never simply shut up? Was the adrenaline rush of wondering when the next blow would come really worth the sweating palms he got every time he said something in that scathing tone without thinking it through first?

The laughter that suddenly filled the room startled him and caught him off guard.

Clint was bent over at the waist, nearly falling out of his chair, while Tony hit the table with his fist and howled with laughter.

“I think we’re going to get along just fine,” the psycho told Harry as she swiped what looked like actual tears of mirth from beneath her eyes.

“I doubt that,” Harry said truthfully.

“Maybe you’ll make a better third impression, Nat,” Steve said with a wry smile.

“Mm, doubtful. I’m still waiting on her to make a good impression on me and I’ve met her over fifty times.” Tony winked and slid a can of soda to Harry, one of the same soda’s that Harry had dropped on the kitchen floor.

Harry peeked over toward the kitchen and saw that the refrigerator was no longer smoking, though he doubted it worked anymore as there was a fist sized hole right through the front of it.

“Don’t worry about that,” Bruce told Harry when he saw what he was looking at. “Tony’s already ordered a new one.”

“I’ll have to tweak it, of course, but it’ll be perfect once I’m done.” Tony flapped a hand toward the red and blue boxes by Harry, “Eat, kid, and I’ll bore you to death about how we’re going to have a super fridge by the time I’m finished with the one they’re delivering in the morning.”

Harry wasn’t super what a ‘super fridge’ was meant to be, but he obediently ate a slice of the pizza Tony got him, along with a few of the wings he had never tried before, as he explained. And, yeah, having a refrigerator that could give out hot water, cold water, or even lemonade through the quick press of a button did actually sound brilliant.

“Enough shop talk,” Clint groaned, interrupting Tony’s story about the other household appliances he’d updated in different ways (apparently the robot assistant, Jarvis, could preheat the oven no matter how far from home Tony was, a neat, but useless, trick as Tony proudly admitted to not knowing how to cook anything past cereal). “What’s the plan?”

“We should let Harry decide since it’s his first Sunday,” Steve said. He turned toward Harry and smiled at him. “We always do something together on Sundays, usually cards or watch TV or a movie or something. You can pick tonight.”

Harry glanced at the expectant looks on everyone else’s faces. “I… er… what?”

“Idiot,” Tony told Steve. He shook his head at him and gave Harry a ‘can you believe him?’ sort of look. “Kid, what card games do you know?”

Harry tried to keep the blank look off his face. “None?”

“None?” Natasha rolled her head from side to side, causing her neck to click. “Everyone knows how to play poker!”

“Suppose I’m a no one then,” Harry said.

“You’re not a no one,” Steve said firmly, sounding more emphatic than Harry’s sarcasm really required. “I didn’t learn to play poker until I joined the army.”

“How about board games?” Bruce asked him. “I’ve got a few down on my floor. Do you know how to play Monopoly?”

“Pepper’s going to be pissed if we play Monopoly again,” Clint snickered as he shared a sly look with Natasha.

“Fury said he’ll let the next dumbass who gets arrested on game night sit in jail for a while,” Natasha added. “He might be bluffing though.”

“He’s just jealous that we don’t invite him,” Tony said airily. “Kid, you down to kick some ass at Monopoly? I’ll warn you now, it can get heated.”

Harry grinned a bit, “Will it get heated enough to see Bruce turn in to the Hulk?”

Not that Harry particularly wanted to be around when he did, but Tony seemed to be a bit obsessed with the giant green monster.

“The way we play? Absolutely,” he winked.

 

Harry had never actually played Monopoly before, but he still doubted if they played by standard rules.

 

There seemed to be a lot of cash betting for what seemed to be a kid’s board game. Tony had moved over to sit beside Harry and slid him an actual stack of real, really green, American cash while Steve set up the game and Bruce explained the rules. Natasha and Clint were busy moving drinks from the ruined refrigerator to the table and Harry had been trying to listen to the rules when Tony distracted him once more.

“These guys are gamblers,” he murmured quietly enough that the others couldn’t hear. “Use this to gamble with, anything you win is yours.”

“No.” Harry used a single finger to slide the money back.

Tony slid it back, “Call it an allowance.”

“No.”

“Back logged child support?”

“No.”

“An outright bribe to make you smile at me?”

Harry frowned even harder. “No.”

Tony’s smile was bright, “If you’re worried I’ll be mad when you lose it all, don’t be. You’ll just lose it to me while we play anyway.”

Harry didn’t push it back that time. He was suddenly determined to win the complicated sounding game. “We’ll see.”

 

Once they got going, Harry realized that they were all intently competitive, except for Steve who didn’t seem to care if he won or not.

They all also sniped at one another in playful tones in the beginning that didn’t last long before it turned more heated.

“You’re cheating!”

“This is bullshit! You know I wanted Boardwalk!”

“I’m not paying you! I know you put the ‘go to jail’ card on the top of the pile!”

“Go fuck yourself, Barton, I’m not paying rent to you.”

Harry had started quiet for a while, focused on not losing horribly, but then Natasha bought Marvin Gardens despite Harry owning the other two yellow properties.

“You bloody prat!” he cried, furious when she smugly took the card from the ‘banker’, Bruce. “What the hell are you going to do with that? I’ve got the other two!”

“Sell it back to you at triple the price,” she quipped with a playful smile. “Come on, Stark Junior, $840 and it’s all yours.”

“Piss off,” Harry said irritably. He had plenty of money, somehow despite having the least amount of properties, but he wasn’t giving her what she wanted. “You can keep the bloody thing.”

Harry thought he misunderstood a rule somewhere because Steve bought the property from Natasha on his next turn and then on his next turn, when he didn’t have enough money to pay rent to Bruce, he sold the property to Harry for $300.

He probably shouldn’t have bought it in the first place, but if he was bad at thinking logically, that wasn’t Harry’s problem.

The game ended when Clint threw the dice across the flat, lodging them into the drywall beside the elevator. He threw his part of their complex bet down on the table and pointed at Tony accusingly before he stormed away, “You’re a damn cheater.”

“You’re a sore loser!” Tony yelled at his back. He waited until the others left, most of them annoyed, to turn to Harry and wink, “I did cheat.”

Harry sent a pointed look at his neat piles of Monopoly money, “Not good enough, I still beat you?”

Somehow.

Harry actually had no idea how he wound up with so much of the colorful paper money.

Tony sighed and pushed the pile of winnings to Harry. “I’ll just cheat harder next time.”

Harry, against his will, laughed as he counted out the money Tony had originally given him to bet with and returned it to him.

Tony pocketed it without an argument. “I’ll have to teach you poker before next Sunday, you’ll make a killing.”

Harry ignored the brief pang of longing. “Will I still be here next Sunday?”

He didn’t want to make plans he wouldn’t be around to fulfill.

“Maybe. Oh, hey, that reminds me. The team and I are going to be busy tomorrow, top secret Avengers bullshit. Pepper will be around though, if you need anything. And I’ll Bluetooth our numbers to you, so you have them. Probably should have done that before now.”

Harry shrugged and helped pack up the game pieces. “What time should I be expecting to be attacked again?”

“Never.”

Harry looked up at Tony’s fervent tone curiously. He had gone to retrieve the dice and was staring at Harry intently as he walked back toward the table.

“Natasha fucked up, she knows that now, but I don’t want you expecting to be attacked again. Not by her, not by any of us. For however long you’re here, this is your home, kid. Nobody’s going to put their hands on you.”

Harry ducked his head so Tony didn’t see the disbelief on his face. “I was joking.”

“I’m not. You’re safe here.”

Harry tried to divert the suddenly intense conversation, “There is a Hulk two floors below us.”

Tony wasn’t distractible for once. He shook his head at Harry. “I give Bruce shit, but he’s good about knowing when he’s going to change. Even if he did change in here, I’d get you away from the danger before I got him to the Hulk-cage. And he might be a jolly green giant, but I’m fast.”

Harry hummed and then glanced up when a small silver square landed on the table in front of him.

“For you,” Tony explained as Harry looked at him. He also tossed the dice in the game box and put the lid on it. “Keep it on you. Just press that top button and the laser comes from that little hole on the front, it has sensors built in so you don’t deploy it on accident in your pocket.” He bent over to grab the box and made uncomfortably solemn eye contact with Harry, “If anyone ever puts their hands on you in any way you don’t like, shoot them.”

Harry picked up the deceptively light weight contraption. It was smaller than his phone and hardly looked like it would leave a hole in a refrigerator. “You want me to kill someone for touching me?”

“Yes.” Tony grinned and straightened up, box now in hand. “Don’t worry, kid, I’ll help you hide the body. Oh, hey, but do me one favor?”

“Yeah?”

“Don’t tell Pepper I gave that to you. She’ll be all ‘Oh, Tony, you’re sooo handsome, but you can’t be giving out military-grade weapons to your equally handsome son, kiss me!’” Tony began making kissing sounds that had Harry unwillingly laughing again.

“I won’t tell her,” he said. He looked at the silver weapon and grinned to himself, imagining if he had it back in May. He could have just shot a laser through Wormtail and baby-Voldemort both and kept Voldemort from ever coming back to life.

… Cedric would still be dead though.

“Thanks,” Harry mumbled, the small smile gone. He slipped the contraption in his pocket and got out of his chair. “I’ll just, er… see you tomorrow?”

“If I’m back before dinner, we should try Greek,” Tony nodded. “Lamb-kabobs are a delicacy, kid.”

“If you say so.” Harry paused by his door and gave Tony a lingering and curious look. “Er… night then.”

 

Harry shook his head after he slipped his jeans off and slid in his bed. He kind of hoped he would be long gone before the next Sunday, but… Harry rolled on his side and reached out to trail a finger on the sleek little silver square.

Harry angrily flipped on his back after a moment.

He didn’t need someone trying to watch out for him. Harry watched out for himself and Sirius did too.

‘Safe here,’ what a stupid thing to say.

 

Harry expected to dream about graveyards and green lights, screams and sobs, that night, and he wasn’t disappointed.

***

“Good morning.”

Harry had drug himself from his room when the sunlight fully filled the room and his stomach began to complain. It had been a long night, but as he didn’t expect anyone to be around all day, he hadn’t bothered getting out of bed until he absolutely had to.

And he regret it immediately, as he did the last time he left his bedroom.

Sitting on the newly replaced sofa, with a pair of white trainers propped up on the coffee table, was a woman, Pepper, probably.

She was young, and just as pretty as Tony said she was. She had long strawberry-blonde hair that was loosely tossed about her shoulders. While Harry probably looked sloppy in his sweatpants and tshirt, she looked elegant somehow in the black sweatpants and fitted white shirt she wore.

She plucked a remote off the table and paused whatever show she had been watching so she could give Harry a sweet smile.

“I’m Pepper,” she said. She had a nice voice, soft, but still warm, a bit like Molly Weasley’s really. She waved the remote toward the kitchen behind her head. “You missed breakfast, but there’s subs in the kitchen if you want one.”

“Er… I’m Harry and thanks.” Harry turned to the kitchen when she flicked the telly right back on. He rolled his eyes when he saw the dozen different sandwiches, all with plastic wrappers and brightly colored labels on them, laid out across the counter. He snagged one at random, ham and cheese it said, and couldn’t even put the rest of them in the refrigerator because it was still broken.

Shrugging it off, Harry settled for getting a bottle of water and simply sliding the excessive amount of food off to the side so he could sit.

And, since he only cleared one spot away, he’d been annoyed when Pepper wandered in the kitchen not moments after Harry unwrapped the sandwich and took a bite.

“So, I’ve heard absolutely nothing about you besides Tony swears you’re hilarious and adorable and Steve said you like dogs,” she said cheerfully. She sat herself down at the opposite end of the counter from Harry and sifted through the pile of sandwiches until she found the one she wanted.

“I’m not funny or adorable,” Harry said, no real heat to his tone. “And all I know about you is that Tony swears you’re in love with him.”

Pepper threw her head back and laughed, and she had a nice laugh too. Musical, sort of. Harry could see why Tony always lit up when he talked about her, anyway.

“Tony thinks the whole world is in love with him,” she said brightly, apparently not worried about insulting her boss to her bosses biological son. “He’s got an ego the size of this building.”

“Yeah?” Harry grinned a little. “Where’s he store it?”

“Secret weapons lab,” she winked. “It’s expansive enough to fit his ego and Natasha’s attitude.”

Harry laughed and it spurred her into giving him ‘the dirty details’ on every on their team. Harry ate while she talked about Clint having a hot head, Steve’s ‘annoying self-righteousness’, Natasha’s impulsivity and attitude, Bruce’s wariness and his reluctance, and Tony’s ego and bossiness.

“You’re literally giving me the weaknesses of these guys,” Harry pointed out when he was finished eating and she was done talking. “I’ve got a team of killers too, you know, and I do plan on using them to take down the Avengers.”

“Oh yeah?” Pepper smiled at him, apparently pleased with Harry’s dry jest. “Got room on your team for one more? It’s about time someone knocked these guys down a peg.”

Harry laughed and shrugged, “I mean so far it’s me and half a dozen German Shepherd puppies, so I suppose you can join if you have any secret skills.”

“Hold that thought…” Pepper winked and held her phone up as it began beeping out a song. Harry saw a photo of Tony flash on the screen before she answered it.

“How goes the top secret mission?” she quipped, drawing another smile from Harry. “Are you prepared to tell me about it and how it’s went horribly wrong yet?”

Harry couldn’t hear Tony, but whatever he said made Pepper roll her eyes.

“He’s fine,” she said, “I’m about to take him to see my secret skills so I can join his League of Evil.”

Harry cleared his throat softly, “We’re the good guys, actually.”

Pepper laughed and nodded at him. “Sorry, I meant I’m about to audition for a position on Team Good Guys.”

Harry collected their trash while Pepper assured Tony that they weren’t doing anything ‘dangerous’ and that he ‘better not be doing something stupid’.

After she hung up, she spun around in her chair to give Harry a wide smile that had a mischievous look to it.

“Ready to see my super power?”

“Sure. What is it?”

Pepper pulled a slim black wallet from her pocket and produced a sparkling blue card from it. “I can destroy Tony’s credit limit in mere hours. Are you ready to join me as I prove my worth as an ally?”

Harry hesitated for a moment, but there was just something likable about Pepper. And… and as much as Harry didn’t want to be responsible for something that could destroy wires and get him punished for it… he did actually quite like that dog.

“Can we stop by a pet store?”

Pepper’s blue eyes twinkled harder than Dumbledore’s ever had. “Oh, Harry, we can absolutely stop by a pet store, in fact, I insist.”

 

Harry rushed to get dressed, throwing something less messy on, and grabbed the money he won from Monopoly, his weird little weapon, and his cell phone. He shot Sirius a quick message, just a little face rolling it’s eyes, but he sent a slightly longer one to Peter.

I’m stealing Joey from you today and teaching him to respond to Arsehole.

 

He’d been flying down the streets with Pepper, the radio blaring some catchy pop song, headed to a mall Pepper swore ‘had everything they needed’ (not that Harry needed anything aside from dog stuff) when he got a text back.

I just told Joey, he barked and it means ‘cool’ lol

“Oh.” Harry blinked at the message and snapped his surprised mouth closed. He hadn’t expected to run into Peter when they went to ‘liberate an innocent puppy and bring him to their lair of goodness’, as Pepper called the mission.

Pepper turned down the radio and slowed the car as she turned it into a parking lot. “Everything good over there?”

“Yeah…” Harry told Peter he’d be there later and pocketed the phone. “I met a kid who works at the shelter, he’s there today, I guess.”

“A kid, huh?” Pepper gave Harry a sly smile. “Cute kid?”

Harry scowled. “I have no idea. I guess you can see for yourself today. I’ll even give you his number if you like what you see.”

Pepper laughed brightly and shut the car off. “I prefer my men to be men,” she winked. “I’ll just leave this kid to you.”

Harry blushed and jumped out of the car after she stepped out. “I’m, er, I’m not gay,” he said in a heated whisper, conscious of the people milling about in the parking lot. “So… I don’t need you to ‘leave him to me’.”

Pepper gave Harry a curious look as she strolled over and linked their arms, catching him by surprise and causing him to tense before he relaxed in her easy movements.

“Tony says he isn’t gay either, but a gorgeous man is a gorgeous man,” she said conversationally as they walked toward the huge shopping mall entrance. “He told me he slept with both of your parents, you know.”

Harry sputtered and knew his face had to be as red as Ron’s hair. “Bloody gross thing to bring up,” he scoffed. “Siri- my friend,” he barely caught himself, “already told me. I don’t need to hear it twice.”

Pepper grinned and held the door open for Harry without ever releasing his arm. “Your friend knew your parents pretty well then?”

Harry nodded absently as he took in the sights and sounds of the mall. Everywhere he looked, there were people and noise and lights and activity. It was much busier and louder than the electronic store and department store he went with Tony to a few days prior.

“Everyone walks fast in New York,” Pepper told Harry as she briskly led him by their conjoined arms around the crowds. “Pet supplies first, destroy your dad’s credit card second.”

Harry was too distracted by keeping away from the other people milling about and talking in their odd accents to correct her, but Tony wasn’t his dad.

He also didn’t care much to start an argument with the warm and friendly woman anyway. He quite liked her, he imagined she was a difficult person to dislike.

They found a little pet store on the third floor, and Harry had a bit of childish glee at riding the escalators up to the floor. Pepper guided Harry on the supplies he’d need- a leash, collar, food, bowls, toys, and little bags to pick up messes the puppy might make -and Harry liked her all the more when she offered to use Tony’s credit card and merely shrugged when Harry insisted that he’d use his money.

They went to a store filled with home decor next and Pepper badgered Harry into buying ‘one damn thing’ to decorate ‘his’ bedroom with.

“It’s not my bedroom, it’s a guest room and I’m leaving soon,” Harry told her firmly.

“Fine, take it with you when you go. But I’m going to look like some wicked stepmom if I buy stuff for my place and you don’t have anything.”

Harry doubted if Pepper could ever be considered anyone’s parent, wicked or not, as young and lively as she was, but he did snag a neat looking rock that set off warm lights and boasted on the packaging that it ‘enhanced peaceful sleep’.

Then Pepper drug him to a woman’s lingerie store, where Harry refused to step foot inside once he saw what it sold. Then they went to another department store and Harry side eyed a leather jacket that reminded him of Sirius’. He hissed when he saw the price tag though.

“That is a lot of money.” Probably more than his bloody Firebolt had cost.

Pepper grabbed it off the shelf and held it up after juggling her other purchases in her arms. “I think you should get it and wear it to go see your totally not cute friend.”

Harry shook his head and tried to take it back from her to hang it up. “I don’t think I’ve ever had that much money in my life.”

Which Pepper found hilarious.

“Oh, Harry, Harry, Harry, you’re so humble,” she laughed. “You must get that from your mom. We’re buying this, come on, help me pick out shoes.”

As bossy as Pepper said that Tony was, Harry privately thought that she was just as bad really.

 

By the time they made it back to the car, their arms were both ladled down with shopping bags and Pepper was all but beaming.

“Another successful day!” She yanked Harry’s new jacket out and thrust it to him before closing the overflowing boot of the car with a flourish. “And now we go liberate your dog from the forces of evil!”

By the time they pulled up at the animal shelter that Pepper had to find the address for, Harry could definitely see why Tony was obsessed with the woman. Incredible bossiness aside, Pepper was loads of fun to be around.

“Harry!” Peter met them as soon as they walked in the doors, a crooked smile on his face, Joey already squirming in his hands. “And…?” he shuffled Joey to one arm so he could hold a polite hand out to Pepper.

“Pepper Potts,” she said, grabbing his hand with a grin, “I’m just here to rescue a puppy from evil.”

“You hear that, Joey?” Peter held the dog up to his face and let him lick him. “You’re joining the Avengers, buddy, since Harry’s apparently a secret member.”

“I bloody well am not,” Harry said. He took Joey from Peter when the other boy held him out and immediately started scratching his ears, happy to see that Joey seemed to remember him. “We’re starting an Anti-Avengers team—”

“Anti-Avengers,” Pepper quipped, “the fun AA.”

“Right,” Harry grinned, “and Arsehole here is helping us take them down from the inside.” He ruffled Joey’s ears and laughed when he tried to thump his tail on Harry’s arm. “Aren’t you, buddy? You ready to take on the Hulk, huh?”

Joey woofed in an enthusiastic way that made the three of them laugh.

“Have room for another member?“ Peter asked, he leaned against the front counter and watched Harry play with Joey, occasionally reaching over to scratch Joey’s head, while Pepper filled out the adoption paperwork.

“Depends,” Harry said seriously, “have any secret superpowers?”

“Well they wouldn’t be a secret if I told you, would they?” Peter deadpanned with the same crooked smile.

“Fair enough,” Harry said. He held Joey up and looked him in his black puppy eyes, “Do we let Peter join or tell him to piss off?”

Joey barked and licked Harry’s nose.

“I’m in!” Peter cried, throwing a fist up victoriously. “I need a cool name, Peter just doesn’t sound like a superhero, does it?”

Harry considered the other Peter he knew and crinkled his nose in disgust. “No,” he said, “we’ll come up with a good name for you that isn’t Peter.”

“And I’ll come up with one for you,” Peter said with a wink.

Harry hadn’t noticed it before then, but it was actually really hot in that building and he hoped Joey wasn’t too warm.

Thankfully, Pepper saved Harry from stammering out something stupid as she bound over to him with her phone in hand.

“It’s done! Congratulations! Now you have to take a photo on the day you adopt your first dog,” she told Harry. She pointed at a wall that had a banner, apparently designed for just that purpose. “Go, stand, smile.”

Harry rolled his eyes at Peter’s smirk, then did as ordered. He held Joey up by his face, hoping the cuteness of the puppy would mask Harry’s… Harry-ness.

“Cheese,” he said with a half-arsed smile.

Pepper rolled her eyes that time and pushed Peter over toward him, causing another heat wave to fill the room. “Peter, show Harry how to smile, will you?”

“Yes, ma’am,” Peter said politely. He stood next to Harry and threw a friendly arm over his shoulder before making the most ridiculous face at Pepper, eyes crossed, tongue sticking out.

Harry laughed, Joey barked, and Pepper took the photo.

 

“He seems nice,” Pepper hummed in the car while they drove back to the tower and Harry held his sleeping puppy in his lap and tried to get a good photo to send Sirius.

“Who?”

“Peter,” she drawled, “obviously.”

“Oh.” Harry shrugged. “Suppose so.”

Pepper glanced over at Harry and laughed as he stuck his phone right in Joey’s face, trying to get a video of the way his nose twitched as he slept.

“You could invite him over,” she said lightly, her eyes back on the road. “Take Joey for a walk, play video games, whatever the hell it is that two cute teenage boys do together.”

Harry scoffed, he had no idea what other teenagers did. “Sounds a bit like plans I can’t make considering I’m leaving soon,” he said carefully.

“It does sound like that, doesn’t it?” Pepper said in her unflappably chipper way. “I don’t know what’s in Russia, but I promise you that Tony can get it for you here, if you wanted to stay.”

Harry put the phone down, ignoring the text from Peter, and frowned. “You can’t buy everything, Pepper.”

Pepper ignored Harry’s rude tone. “Name one thing you can’t buy,” she challenged him playfully.

Harry wasn’t in the mood to play though. “A family,” he blurted, thinking of the one thing he’d always said he’d trade his entire vault to have.

Pepper gave Harry a sympathetic look and reached out to grasp his knee gently. “We could be your family, if you let us.”

Harry stared down at Joey and swallowed back the lump trying to clog his throat. “You’re great, but I can’t,” he admitted. “S- my friend is my family, and I made promises I can’t break.”

Pepper hummed again, but didn’t say anything else.

They made the rest of the drive home to the tower in silence.

Chapter Text

Monday, June 13

Tony slept like shit, and thus was not in the mood for nonsense. He sat in the window seat of his jet and stared moodily out the window, ignoring the quiet conversation of the others who joined him on his personal mission.

“Awfully silent over there, Stark,” Natasha said. She shot a straw wrapper at Tony, accurately nailing him right above the ear.

“I’m trying to decide the best way to kill you and Ramsey both,” Tony mused aloud seriously. “I think I should let you kill him, then kill you, claim I saved the streets from a vicious killer, accept my award, then go home and order dinner.”

Natasha snorted, “You’re in a lovely mood.”

“Unfortunate side effect of hearing my kid have nightmares that you caused,” Tony snapped, turning to give her a dirty look.

It really had been a long, shitty night. Tony’s own Natasha-induced insomnia (side effect of seeing his son look completely terrified and lose his witty humor in favor of stammered speech and wild eyes) had led him to the kitchen late at night. He peeked in on Harry while he waited on the coffee to brew, just reassure himself the kid was still there and breathing, and found him thrashing in his bed, drenched in sweat, murmuring something indecipherable.

Tony had no idea what the hell he was supposed to do, so he settled for sitting in Harry’s doorway with a cup of coffee. It was the equivalent of being useless, but Tony couldn’t just leave him laying there alone either.

He hadn’t left the doorway until the first rays of light began filtering through the window and he only left then to exact some revenge on his son’s behalf.

Natasha didn’t look ashamed of herself, since she never did, but she did raise her hands harmlessly. “I said I was sorry. Like I was supposed to just somehow know that the kid going through your cabinets was your actual spawn and not some child sized spy sent to collect intel and disable the team?”

The guys were all nonplussed by her paranoia, it was paranoia well earned, but still misplaced.

“You could have checked before you went pushing him around,” Steve chided her, much softer than Tony would have. “The kid is skittish, Nat, you’ve probably made it worse.”

“You made him cry,” Bruce added, really driving home that guilt trip at the reminder of Harry and his red-rimmed eyes last night. “You have to watch your temper around him, abused kids are always on the lookout for angry adults.”

Tony felt the anger he was becoming familiar with rise up at the reminder that his son was one of those vague and mysterious ‘abused kids’.

“At least we’ll have someone to take it out on,” Clint said cheerfully, reaching over to tap Tony’s coffee mug with his own.

“And we definitely decided that plucking this shitbag off the streets, killing him, and hiding the body is the best way to handle the whole ‘Tony’s kid is in love with a pedophile’ situation?” Natasha asked. She rolled her eyes at the pissed look that Tony gave her, “I didn’t say I wasn’t game, I’m just making sure this is a done deal.”

“Actually…” Steve spoke up and Tony turned his glare on to him. He knew they should have left the old man with the stick up his ass at home. “Look, how’s Harry going to feel if we just kill this person? He’s bonded with him, obviously, and he might be even more terrified of us if he finds out we killed the guy he considers his family.”

“What? We let him roam the fucking streets?” Clint snarled. “Maybe find a new kid to prey on?”

Steve didn’t even bother to correct Clint’s language. “No, I think we should have him arrested, let the justice system handle him.”

Tony scoffed, “We are the justice system.”

“And what if Harry heals enough to one day want to face down his abuser?”

Tony hesitated. “Why would he want to do that? See that guy that- that abused him?”

“To kick him in the dick?” Natasha suggested.

“It’s a pretty common thing, actually,” Bruce said thoughtfully. “It’s supposed to bring closure to the victim.”

“He’ll get more closure if he knows the guy is six foot deep,” Clint argued, Natasha nodding firmly by his side. “Plus, we might not have enough proof for a legal case anyway, not without Harry’s testimony, unless…” Clint tilted his chin and looked at Tony, “Anything incriminating in the texts?”

“A threatening bomb emoji,” Tony said dryly. “Maybe we’ll get him prosecuted as a terrorist.”

Clint snorted and the team fell silent as the jet began to descend on the landing.

“What are we doing here, Tony?” Steve asked gravely as the jet landed and the team got to their feet. “Your revenge or Harry’s justice?”

Tony rubbed his eyes then pinched the bridge of his nose. “Odds on Harry ever actually wanting to face this bastard again?”

“Even if it’s 1%, would you take that opportunity away from him?” Steve asked.

Tony threw his hands up and got to his feet so he could jab a finger in Steve’s direction. “I knew I should have left you at home.”

“God damnit.” Clint snatched his bundle of arrows from the weapons compartment above the seats. “I would have stayed home if I knew we were going to go soft on a pedophile.”

Steve clapped Clint on the shoulder before he descended the jet with Bruce. “I didn’t say we weren’t going to give Tony some time to chat before we leave him to the cops.”

Tony brightened up a very small amount at that. “I never would have left you, Cap!” he called at his retreating back. “You’re my favorite hero, you know that!”

Natasha gave Tony a look that he sneered at.

“You I’m not even a little fond of,” he warned her. “Paranoid little psychopath.”

“You’ll forgive me eventually,” she said confidently.

“Doesn’t look like that day’s any time soon,” Tony said. “Maybe when Harry willingly hugs you, we’ll talk.”

Natasha laughed shortly, amusement gleaming in her eyes. “You’re on, Stark.”

“In the meantime,” Clint strapped a dagger to his forearm and held it up to catch the light in the cabin, “let’s go hunt a sicko.”

~~~~~

Sirius was having an excellent day.

He woke up to a message from his godson, a smiley face and a taunt that if Sirius didn’t send him money soon that Harry would give him ‘a bloody shit name’ on his fake ID.

Sirius sent back a pumpkin.

He knew Harry assumed that he was too magical, too pureblooded, to understand the fine art of ‘texting’, but it wasn’t all that hard to learn once he got the phone. It was just more fun to click random little pictures and let Harry ponder his meaning.

And, considering Harry sent back a lot of angry faces and middle fingers, Sirius assumed that he wasn’t as subtle as he thought he was. Which was fine, Harry was clearly acclimating to the new place, and that was all Sirius wanted. He’d even sent him photos and videos of a group of puppies he’d befriended.

It had been the hardest struggle of Sirius’ life to not find a way to print those photos off and plaster them all over his parents’ gloomy house, but protecting Harry came before bragging about his adorableness.

Sirius did get a message around eleven o’clock pm Harry’s time though, a simple little ‘I miss you’ that broke his heart. Sirius missed his godson as much as a man would miss his limbs (if the man wasn’t Alastor who hardly counted as a man since Sirius thought he was at least part-machine), but Harry had other family to comfort him. And maybe one day Sirius would be able to slip away and visit him. If he found a way to do it without getting tossed right back in Azkaban, that was.

Hopefully the pumpkin made Harry laugh and he’d have a better day than the one he clearly had the day before.

Apart from the message from Harry, Sirius also got to smugly watch as Snape and Tonks returned from an overnight shift of ‘Harry hunting’, both looking wretched and exhausted. Tonks was a little less wan than Snape, but she was always energetic and peppy. Sirius just hoped she’d put that energy to use in annoying Snape and not finding any trail of Harry’s.

Sirius was in such a good mood in fact that he offered the two of them breakfast, something Tonks accepted and Snape denied with a furious snarl that didn’t bother Sirius at all.

“Sirius, I’m sorry, but- but it’s like Harry’s just disappeared into thin air,” Tonks said quietly after Snape left and she tucked into the meal Sirius made. “We still can’t tell if he’s been taken or ran away.”

Sirius sighed and poked at his eggs. “I have to think that he’s just ran off, ya know? Hiding out from Voldemort, but…”

“But there’s a lot of people who would have loved to take the Boy-Who-Lived,” Tonks said. “It’s just… if Albus can’t find any leads, then it had to be someone pretty powerful, right?”

Sirius kept his head ducked to hide his amusement and pride, “Right.”

Tonks put a gentle hand on Sirius’ shoulder after she ate and prepared to head home to sleep. “You’re taking this a lot better than I would,” she said. “Just keep it up and Harry will be home before you know it.”

Sirius nodded morosely and waited until Tonks left to smile to himself.

“You are taking this rather well.”

That voice wiped the smile off Sirius’ face immediately. He turned in his seat and saw that Harry’s best friends, Ron and Hermione, standing in the opposite doorway with eyes narrowed and wands in hand.

Cute, really. Sirius assumed they thought because they bested him when they met in the Shack that Sirius was afraid of a couple of teenagers with wands.

There was a big difference between Sirius a little over a year ago and now.

“Should I destroy another bookcase?” Sirius asked Hermione, adding a rough edge to his voice as both warning and evidence of his supposed unhappiness.

Destroying that bookcase had been a blast and Sirius sort of hoped he’d get another chance to do it again. Sure, his ‘mad with worry’ routine had seemed to terrify Hermione and the youngest Weasley girl, but Sirius didn’t really care much about them.

“Or you could tell us where you think Harry is,” Ron said, stepping up in front of what Sirius suspected was his little girlfriend. The wand in his hand tapped his thigh and Ron probably thought he looked dangerous.

He didn’t.

Albus could be dangerous.

Voldemort could be dangerous.

And Sirius spat in both their faces when he shuffled Harry off to America.

So, no. Sirius wasn’t scared of these defenders of the friend they didn’t write.

“I think he’s ran off and he’ll write me soon,” Sirius said, not resisting the urge to needle these kids and repeat the same story he’d given the Order as an excuse for his lack of madness over Harry’s disappearance.

“If Harry ran off he would have wrote to us,” Hermione said, thrusting her chin out stubbornly. “I think you know where he is and all we want to know is if he’s safe, Sirius, surely you can understand that.”

Sirius got up and nodded solemnly. “I can,” he said honestly. Then he added rather snarkily, “Perhaps you should write to him and see if he replies, eh?”

Sirius then walked around them with his hands in his pockets and his head high.

Bloody kids. The only one Sirius liked was Harry. And he was off in America, Sirius ducked in the closest loo to check his phone and smiled, apparently missing Sirius as much as Sirius did him.

 

By early afternoon, Sirius found himself laying on the front stoop again, solely out of habit as he didn’t expect a letter from Harry to arrive now that they had a different form of communication.

It was nice, everyone being terrified to set Sirius’ infamous temper off, because they all avoided him like Dragon Pox and hardly noticed when he slipped out the door disguised as Padfoot. Except for the twins. Sirius’ tag wagged and his tongue lolled as he thought of the charmed dog treats he’d found outside his bedroom door. No doubt the twins were trying to cheer Sirius up through pranks.

Those two were a lot more tolerable than most other kids were.

Sirius entertained himself by playing the part of a lovable stray and getting the muggles walking up and down the sidewalks to stop and scratch his head. He barked and growled at the muggle who lived a few houses down from him, #10 Grimmauld Place, and tried to take a nip out of his arm as he scurried away from the dog. Aside from being a creepy sort of man, he’d also tasted disgusting when Sirius used his hairs for Polyjuice.

Yeah, maybe Sirius didn’t have to use the guy’s hair, but the stupid muggle creep dropped his work bag that had a brush in it one day early on in Sirius’ imprisonment there, and the freely given hairs had been too much to resist.

Regardless though, Sirius huffed out a raspy dog laugh when the muggle turned pale and ran from Sirius to seclude himself in his house.

Prat.

 

Sirius was content though, chasing a bird for the amusement of a giggling little girl, up and down the sidewalks, even doing some spectacular leaps to make her laugh more.

The little girl tugged on her mother’s hand. “It’s funny doggy!” she giggled. “I want him, Mummy! Peaseee?”

Sirius sat and woofed at the girl and refrained from growling at the disgusted look the mother shot his way.

“He’s probably infested with fleas, honey,” she told the girl. “Come on, let’s leave the mangy dog alone.”

Sirius chased his tail one last time to make the girl giggle as her mother pulled her away toward the bus they’d been waiting on.

For that woman’s information, Sirius did not have fleas, thanks so much.

Disappointed with the lack of people to swindle laughs and scratches from, Sirius drug himself to the stoop and put his head on his paws as he wondered what his godson was up to. Knowing Harry, it was probably hilarious or horrible, there was no in-between in anything Harry ever did.

Sirius was daydreaming about Harry flying around in one of those suits he’d seen Tony Stark build when his ears pricked up and he heard people trailing down the block.

“…part of town,” a woman said.

“…grew up here?” a man replied.

Sirius was on all four paws when he heard a familiar voice say a familiar name.

“Petunia didn’t know…”

Sirius lunged off the steps, his internal alarms going haywire, as none other than Tony Stark himself walked around the corner.

No, no, no… Sirius desperately prayed that Harry hadn’t told Tony where Sirius lived. Tony shouldn’t be able to find #12 Grimmauld Place, with as many muggle repellent charms as the place still had, but he couldn’t be standing outside chatting with his mates about Harry Potter either. If anyone heard him, that would be that. And unless Tony already established his custody over Harry, then Albus would undoubtedly find a legal way to bring Sirius’ godson right back in to the middle of a war.

Sirius trotted up to Tony and his mates; a redhead woman that made Sirius actually drool, a tall guy with broad shoulders and neat blonde hair, another guy, more burly, with tattoos up his arms and a weapon of some sort strapped to his back, and a smaller guy with wire framed glasses and a swotty look to him.

Sirius recognized them after a moment, with as much research as he’d done on Tony Stark, he’d have to be an idiot to not recognize the muggle-ish superhero team he’d built.

That didn’t answer what the fuck they were doing in London though.

“What number?” The ridiculously attractive woman asked as Tony pushed Sirius’ head away from him. His movements caught her attention and she smirked down at Sirius. “Another stray to add to the family, Stark?”

Tony, who did look just as good then as he did nearly sixteen years ago, narrowed his keen eyes at Sirius as he played off the stray dog desperate for attention act.

“No…” he said slowly. “Harry said that his friend had a big black dog, he said it looked mean as hell but was sweet.” Tony held a hand out toward Sirius, “Are you sweet?”

Sirius barked as snarled as viciously as he could, fruitlessly hoping it would scare them off before someone caught wind of them.

All it would take was one person to take a good look at Tony Stark to link him to Harry.

Tony wasn’t scared off, though he did yank his hand back quickly.

“Trust the kid to think that beast is sweet,” the tattooed guy whose name Sirius didn’t care about snorted. He didn’t look at Sirius, so he missed Sirius baring his teeth at him, instead he pointed toward the row of houses and caused Sirius’ stomach to drop when he said, “That one.”

Of all the people on Tony’s team to have magic in their blood, the tattooed weapon guy was the last one Sirius expected it to be.

Sirius tried barking, growling, even biting the swot looking bloke’s trousers while they got closer and closer to Sirius’ home.

Were they planning on ringing the bloody doorbell?!

And all he got for his troubles was a quick kick in the side from the redhead when he went to bite her leg.

“Don’t you dare,” she snapped, her eyes all furious and sexy. She turned her head and stormed up the steps to…

To house number ten.

Sirius slunk back and his eyes flicked nervously from the creepy muggle bloke’s front door and his own.

There was no way it was a coincidence that Harry’s father and his team were in London, on Sirius’ block, two doors away from his own house.

The blonde guy (did he wear a costume and carry a shield in the articles Sirius read?) pounded on the muggle’s doorway and the five of them made an impressive grouping as they stood there with stony faces and radiated cold anger.

The muggle opened the door slowly after the blonde guy knocked again and barely poked his face through the crack. “Yes?”

“Alexander Ramsey?” Gorgeous redhead asked the muggle.

… Sirius had no idea what was happening. Perhaps it was a coincidence that they were there? Maybe the creepy guy was some sort of terrorist or something evil on a muggle level that Tony’s superhero team came to destroy?

“Yes?”

Tony shouldered the redhead away and smiled at the muggle, though he didn’t really seem all that happy. “I think you know my son?”

… Nope. Sirius was right back to not having a bloody clue what was happening.

“No…?” The muggle looked nervous and tried to close the door, though Tony’s informal high-top trainers kept it from closing.

“Let’s chat about it inside,” the redhead said in a falsely saccharine tone. She pushed on the door, knocking the muggle back and giving their team entrance to his flat. “Banner, you and your sensitive delicacies are on lookout,” she snapped. “Rogers, are you with us or him?”

The blonde bloke squared his shoulders and followed Tony, the tattooed knife bloke, and the redhead inside, “With you.” He glanced toward the swot looking guy over his shoulders and murmured, “If only to make sure this creep ends up in jail and not a morgue.”

The swot guy, Banner, apparently, chuckled quietly after the door firmly closed behind him. “As if Tony’s going to leave any pieces for a morgue,” he muttered to himself. Well, to Sirius as well, except he might not have been aware of that as Sirius looked like a dog.

Sirius had no bloody idea what was happening, but as it seemed to involve Harry somehow, he knew he needed to find out.

And he had just the cloak upstairs in Harry’s trunk in his room to help him do so.

 

Sirius sent one last confused look toward where Banner stood in front of the muggle door before racing to his door, sliding through the magic doggy door, and changing back to his own two feet just in time to crunch a pile of dog treats and throw open his bedroom door.

He ignored Hedwig’s hoots and Buckbeak’s whines as he removed the disillusionment charm on Harry’s trunk and threw it open. He snatched James’ old cloak from beneath a pile of actual rubbish (Harry was an adorable slob) and stuffed it in his pocket to storm back down the stairs.

“Where are you going?” Molly stopped him with a half-sympathetic, half-exasperated look. She stood in the sitting room doorway with her arms crossed and her curious red-headed children grouped up behind her. Her curious ginger kids and one suspicious looking brunette, that is.

Sirius wasted another precious moment of being nosy to be dramatic. “If none of you will find my damn godson then I’ll do it myself!” he roared, waving his wand around and generally looking entirely mad.

“And what if you get caught?” Molly demanded. “When we find Harry he’s not going to be happy if you’re in prison or kissed!”

Sirius scowled and really tried to channel the Black madness that surely still lingered in the grim house. “I don’t care! They can send all the dementors they want, but I am finding my godson!”

Sirius spun on his heel before he could lose anymore actually valuable time and stormed right out the door as Molly said something about ‘Dumbledore’.

Sirius didn’t know how many times he was going to have to snarl, mutter, yell, and, on one memorable night, scream it in French: he did not give a damn about what Albus bloody Dumbledore had to say.

Sirius was a grown man capable of making his own poor decisions. The last time he followed the word of Albus, he let Hagrid take his godson and drop him off with some abusive muggles. Never again did Albus get to dictate Sirius’ choices.

While he was still protected by the wards, Sirius tossed Harry’s cloak on, momentarily nostalgic about the times he wore it as a student, and crept silently down the sidewalk toward his neighbors place. Sirius practically held his breath as he got as close to the front window as he could, keeping his presence hidden from the body guard on the stoop, and tried to peer through the window.

He refrained from snarling in annoyance when his view was blocked by curtains and his hearing was blocked by the thickness of the walls. He pulled his wand from his pocket and touched his ear before touching the wall and intoning a silent Marialos spell.

“I said how do you know my son?”

Wham!

“I don’t know! Please! I swear!”

Sirius winced in sympathy as the muggle sounded as if he were crying through a broken nose. Then he stopped feeling sympathetic as Harry’s father obviously had reason to believe this creepy muggle did something to Sirius’ godson.

Either that or Sirius sent his godson off to live with a complete nutter, making him the worst godfather to ever live.

“Hey, listen, we don’t want to hurt you, okay? Harry said you’re worried about him, do you want me to call him?”

Why… why did Harry think this bloke was worried about him? Sirius got the distinct impression that someone, probably himself, was missing an important piece of information.

“I DONT KNOW ANY HARRY!”

WHAM!

“Enough!”

“You don’t like it, you can wait outside! I want to know what this god damned pedophile did to my kid!”

Sirius felt the air leave his lungs and his entire chest contracted. Did someone- did Harry- was Harry fucking molested?!

If Sirius hadn’t been entirely confident that Tony was about to kill that piece of shite then he’d burst through the window and do it his damn self.

Sirius listened to Tony and the tattooed guy interrogate the muggle, with occasional input from the redhead, while he carefully slid his phone from his pocket and checked it for any messages from Harry.

‘Hi, it’s Harry, by the way I was abused by your neighbor in a wild coincidence, I still love you even though you didn’t protect me’, is what Sirius hoped to have in his ‘inbox’. What he had instead was nearly as good.

It was a photo of Harry, obviously taken by someone else. He stood beneath a yellow banner that said ‘ADOPTION DAY!’ and held a little brown and black puppy in his hands. Harry looked happy, really happy, even with the bags under his eyes. He had his head partially thrown back with a wide smile and Sirius wondered if it was because of the dog in his arms, or the kid (cute kid, kind of scruffy looking in the way that reminded Sirius of a younger Remus) standing beside him making a face at the camera. Harry didn’t explain his laughter, or who his friend was, he merely added a little caption:

Meet your great-godson, Jack the Arsehole.

Sirius felt his eyes well with heartbroken and furious tears. Why couldn’t Harry ever catch a break?! His parents dead when he was a baby. Raised by abusive muggles. Used like a pawn by his Headmaster. Never feeling like he fit in at Hogwarts with his peers. Kidnapped and forced to watch a classmate be murdered. And, somehow, between all the other traumatic events in Harry’s life, he also got mol—

“How did you get him on the damn airplane?!”

Wait.

What?

Sirius slid the phone back in his pocket as he focused on precisely what was being said. Harry said he never rode an airplane before Sirius put him on one less than a week ago?

… before Sirius, disguised as his plain looking muggle neighbor, put him on one a week ago.

“I saw you! You were-

WHACK!

-touching my son before he got on that plane!”

Sirius wracked his mind quickly, he didn’t…?

Oh.

Yeah.

He put his hands on Harry’s shoulders to reassure him, causing the poor kid to flinch, when they said goodbye before Harry left.

“P-please! Please! I didn’t do anything! I don’t know what you’re talking about! You’re crazy!”

“So if we go through your phone right now we won’t find any texts to Tony’s son? Encrypted messages, maybe?”

Sirius grimaced. He didn’t know that Harry’s texts were monitored, which was bloody daft considering Tony himself was considered to be a wizard at muggle technology. At least he never sent anything more incriminating than—

“Tell me what a spider and a sailboat emoji means or I swear to god I’m going to cut your fucking hand from your wrist so you can never send another message again.”

Sirius had a sudden urge to laugh.

He didn’t think that Tony Stark would be the one puzzling over the random images Sirius sent Harry every time he asked for money. It was a bit of bad luck for the neighbor—

“Got it! Jackass used his own fucking birthday to lock the files. Check this out, Stark, pages and pages of child pornography.”

“It’s not m—”

WHAM!

“Any of Harry?”

“None that I can see. These kids are- they’re younger.”

Sirius bit his lip to keep from letting out a delighted laugh.

This wasn’t bad luck at all! This couldn’t have gone better even if he had actually planned it!

Harry wasn’t molested, Tony was still beating the piss out of a bloke who he thought hurt Harry, and the muggle was getting precisely what he deserved!

Sirius wasn’t an idiot at all (take that, Professor Slughorn), he was a genius!

Except… except Sirius didn’t exactly want Tony to extract revenge against the disgusting muggle creep, he wanted him to hunt down Petunia and Vernon Dursley, make them pay for actually hurting Harry, as opposed to the hypothetical situation with the muggle…

Sirius thought for a moment while the vigilantes in the house discussed the best way to have the muggle arrested. It wasn’t as if he could stroll in the house as himself, and polyjuicing as the muggle was out… but…

Sirius grinned and felt a true bounce in his steps as he quickly hurried home, stuffing Harry’s cloak out of sight, and raged up the stairs (implying to the other occupants of the house that he’d been unsuccessful in his short search) to grab a piece of parchment and a quill. He opened the window, slipped out on to the roof, and crawled around until he saw Banner in his line of sight. Sirius held his wand between his teeth as he scrawled a hasty note, then traded the wand for the quill as he performed a tricky little charm, apparating the note from his own hands to Banner’s shirt pocket.

The smile on Sirius’ face and the feeling in his chest were the same things he felt when he, James, Remus, and the Rat-Who-Will-Not-Be-Named finished the Marauders Map:

Smugly satisfied and immensely mischievous.

Chapter Text

Tony tapped his foot impatient as he waited on the police department to finish ‘bagging and tagging’ Ramsey’s belongings.

Clint and Steve stood beside him, both solemn and grave. Clint stared Ramsey down, cowardly little creep was sniveling in handcuffs by the door, and Steve watched the officers closely, making sure no mistakes were made.

Bruce and Natasha had taken off to grab lunch around the same time that Tony called for the police to handle Ramsey before he lost his patience entirely and put the bastard somewhere he’d never be found, Harry’s ‘closure’ be damned.

“I think we’re finished here,” one of the officers said, stepping over to Tony. “Are you wanting to press charges, Mister Stark?”

“Him?!” Ramsey shrieked. “He assaulted me!”

Tony smiled brightly at the scum. He had assaulted him. Broke his nose, knocked a tooth out, Clint even took a swing and hit one side of his face with the full force of his considerable muscle.

Tony hoped he bruised black and blue just as Harry had.

“Shut the hell up before I assault you,” the cop beside Ramsey said gruffly with a disgusted look at the man.

“What other charges do you have?” Tony asked the detective in charge, thinking quickly. He’d told them about his son having contact with Ramsey, offered them the video of their goodbye at the airport (Ramsey denied being there, but cameras didn’t lie). He couldn’t find whatever burner cell that Ramsey used to text Harry, but the video linked them despite all his protests.

If he could avoid pressuring Harry to testify though, let the kid work out his trauma on his own time, then that was the preferable route.

“Just for the shit on his computer?” The cop snorted and shot a glare at Ramsey, “He’s never seeing the light of day again.”

“Then I will not be, currently,” Tony stressed. “I’ll contact you if that changes.”

Because if Harry decided he wanted to add his name to the list of other victims they’d gotten off Ramsey’s computer, then Tony would support him.

Easy.

The officer accepted his decision and Tony watched as they began moving evidence and Ramsey to their cars.

“You did the right thing,” Steve said. He tried to put his hand on Tony’s shoulder, but he shook it off.

“I don’t need brotherly reassurance from Mister Justice,” Tony scoffed. “Let’s just get back to the jet before I change my mind.”

The guys nodded and led the way out of the little creep’s house. Tony pulled his phone out, planning on calling Pepper and checking on Harry, when one of the older cops came jogging up to him.

“Mister Stark, I’m sorry, sir, I just wanted to talk to you for a moment.”

Tony sighed and waved the guys off. “Yes?”

If they wanted to talk about assault, then Tony would find every single instance where they’d ever used excessive force, send it to the media, and still try and make it home in time for dinner with his kid.

“I don’t want to step over any lines, sir, but I wanted to ask if you’d found a good therapist for your son?”

Tony’s mental plan on the best way to blackmail the police department fizzled out. “A therapist?”

The cop nodded, his face grave and his eyes sympathetic. “I’ve seen a lot of kids after they go through stuff like this, and the ones who have support and see a therapist? Those are the ones I don’t usually see again.”

Tony hesitated, then decided that it was something to consider later. He held a hand out and shook the officer’s hand gratefully. “Thank you, I’ll look into it.”

The cop nodded once more and rejoined his coworkers while Tony pulled up a text from Pepper and rejoined his.

“Awe,” Tony’s anger at the entire situation melted some when he saw the picture Pepper sent. “I’m a grandpa! A young, handsome, grandpa to be clear,” he added smoothly. “Not like you, Steve.”

Clint chuckled, “The kid knock someone up?”

“Mm…” Tony looked at the boy in the photo next to his boy and smirked. “I don’t think that’s going to be an issue. Looks like Pepper took him to adopt a dog.”

Steve looked at the photo Tony showed them and smiled, no doubt seeing the same look of joy in Harry’s features as Tony did.

“That’s the boy and the dog from the event,” he said, as if Tony needed their identities clarified. “It’ll be good for Harry to have something to be responsible for, help him work through everything, I guess.”

Tony shot off a text to Pepper, thanking her for the photo, proposing they elope in Vegas the next morning, then climbed in a cab Clint waved down with the other two.

“Speaking of working things through… either of you fine images of sound mental health ever see a therapist?”

“Every week,” Steve said without even a hint of the embarrassment that Tony would have felt at saying something like that. “All the guys down at the center do it. We do group sessions sometimes and individuals other times.”

And since Steve should be dead by all rights, Tony looked toward the more sane (though not entirely sane) member of his team.

“Once a month,” Clint scowled at his boots. “SHIELD rules for all agents.”

“Is it… helpful?” Tony asked, trying, for once, to be tactful. It wasn’t like he was a stranger to hard times, and God knew Pepper recommended he ‘see someone’ more than once since the whole ‘nearly dying thing’, but Tony couldn’t imagine sitting in a room and talking about his feelings.

Clint said no while Steve said yes.

“It’s really helpful, guys, seriously, thank you.” Tony sighed and closed his eyes as he laid back against the headrest.

“Couldn’t hurt to try,” Steve said, as if logic would work against Tony. “You should set Harry up with someone. I can get you a list of people from the center? Those guys should know someone who understands what the kid’s been through.”

Tony flipped him off for a response then groaned. “Fine, send me the list, I’ll talk with Harry about it.”

“You mean you’ll talk at him about it,” Clint said, supremely unhelpfully. “If he won’t tell you his favorite food, there’s no way he’s going to talk about his little sad feelings to some overpaid counselor.”

A fine point. One Tony didn’t bother to dispute, but he listened as Steve did for the rest of the drive to the jet.

“You guys want to grab lunch or wait for the others on the jet?” Clint asked, interrupting Steve’s tirade as their car approached the private airport they’d left the jet at.

“Jet,” Tony said immediately. “If Bruce and Natasha aren’t back, we’ll send someone to grab something nearby, but I need a drink.”

Something preferable whiskey related to wash the bitter taste of his son’s childhood from his mouth.

And, as the others were still off probably sightseeing or some other ridiculous thing, Tony grabbed a glass bottle from the onboard bar and proceeded to try and convince himself that Harry was safe, Ramsey was locked up, and things could move forward.

He’d always sucked at convincing himself of things when they weren’t logical.

 

“We’re here!” Natasha was jubilant as she dove on the jet and pulled Bruce along behind her over an hour, half a bottle of whiskey, and an overpriced and under seasoned lunch later. “Tony, you’re a damned idiot. Bruce is the real genius on our team.”

“Don’t credit me, it wasn’t my idea,” Bruce said quickly.

Tony exchanged a curious look with Steve. He’d been cursing Natasha out for the last hour, certain he wasn’t going to get back in time to have dinner with his kid, and now she shows up and insults him?

It was no wonder the damn woman didn’t have any friends outside of the team.

“What wasn’t your idea?” Steve asked Bruce.

“Interrogating Petunia Dursley,” Natasha said, her smirk as arrogant as Tony had ever seen it. “Where we got the real dirt, not the bullshit she fed Tony on the phone.”

“What?!” Tony sat up and studied the two of them closely. “What the hell did you do, Natasha?”

Petunia was going to sign off her rights as guardian the next morning. If Natasha went over there all ‘pissed off psycho’ then Petunia would put up a fight, thinking Harry wasn’t in—

“Oh, stop worrying,” Natasha scoffed, mocking Tony’s genuine concern. “Petunia isn’t going to do shit in Harry’s life, never again.”

“Maybe you should start in the beginning, guys,” Clint said, shooting a look at Tony before he straightened in his seat and prepared himself to break up an impending fight. “Why the hell would you go to her place to start with?”

“Because of this.” Bruce pulled a piece of thick paper from his pocket and handed it to Tony before he sat down and buckled his seatbelt. “Someone must have slipped it in my pocket on our way to Ramsey’s.”

Tony scoffed, there was no way someone slipped something in Bruce’s pocket and none of them noticed, but then he forgot that mystery in favor of the one in thick black ink in front of him:

You’ve got the wrong guy. You want revenge for H.? Go talk to Dursleys, 4 Privet Drive, Surrey. Ask about the cupboard.

“What…?” Tony looked up at his friends. “What the hell is this?”

“Scooby-Doo would call it a clue,” Natasha smirked.

“Bruce?” Steve turned to Bruce after rolling his eyes at Natasha. “What happened?”

“I found the note, figured ‘hey worth a shot’, and then—”

“Then you didn’t bother to tell me?” Tony asked, his annoyance high. “You’re already off to a great start, buddy.”

Bruce looked ashamed, but not remorseful. “I didn’t want them to recognize you, especially if it turned out to be nothing. I took Nat because I figured if there was anything to the note then maybe I’d need someone to get answers.”

“Which I did.”

“To what questions?” Steve asked.

“I started with when the last time she saw Harry was, and guess what?”

“I’m not in the mood to guess, surprisingly,” Tony snapped. “Tell me what she told you before I wring your fucking neck.”

Natasha raised a challenging brow. “No, wait, let’s see you try that.”

“Nat,” Bruce all but growled, “quit taunting him. Tell him what she told us.”

“Fine,” Natasha sighed dramatically then crossed her legs. “Harry was there this summer, every summer, in fact. She tried to tell me the same bullshit she told Tony,” Natasha adopted a whiney high pitched voice, “‘We haven’t seen the boy in years! Some freaks came and took him!’ But the little fat son of hers looked panicky and a few suggestions quickly had her singing a new song.”

“A few threats against the kid to get Mom to talk?” Clint guessed with a hint of approval to his tone.

“Precisely,” Natasha winked and began swinging her foot, obviously relishing in the limelight. “Supposedly Harry goes to a boarding school during the school year, something his parents paid for.”

“No,” Tony interrupted her, “Harry wasn’t registered in any schools past St Peter’s Primary School before he turned eleven.”

“I don’t think she was lying,” Natasha said. She looked at Bruce and he nodded in agreement. “Why lie about that then tell me the truth when she said her husband used to smack the kid around?”

Tony dropped the glass he’d been holding and ignored sound of it shattering. “He did WHAT?”

“It gets worse,” Bruce said solemnly. “Tell them the rest, Nat.”

“How does that get worse?” Clint muttered.

Tony wasn’t sure, but it did.

“The woman clammed up and the husband was gone, but the fat kid was surprisingly helpful. He said, despite the fact that he weighs more than Bruce when he’s angry, they didn’t feed Harry. They worked him like a slave. Called him names, and tried to ‘beat some normalcy in him’.”

Clint tried to lighten the dark look burning in Tony’s eyes, “As if a Stark could ever be normal.”

Tony hardly heard him. He focused on Natasha with the same single-minded focus he applied to every problem in his life, “What else?”

Natasha picked at her nails and shrugged as she avoided eye contact. “They have a four bedroom house, Stark.”

“And?”

“And…” Natasha released a loud breath and gave Tony a pitying look. “And they made your kid live in a ‘cupboard’, Tony. The fat kid, Dudley, said Harry lived in this tiny little closet under the stairs until he turned eleven and went off to boarding school. It was full of spiders and shit when I looked in there.”

“AND YOU FUCKING SHOOK HIM!” Tony yelled abruptly, his fury spiking. He jumped to his feet and lunged for Natasha. Clint grabbed his arms and held them in a vice grip. “YOU UNGODLY, IDIOTIC, STUPID, B—”

“I fucked up!” Natasha shouted over Tony’s insults, not even bothering to get up from her seat. “You’re not pissed off at me, Stark, you’re pissed at them! So let’s do something about it!”

“No!” Bruce yelled, getting to his feet and blocking the exit. “Tony, think rationally. I didn’t take you or mention you at all so there weren’t any complications tomorrow with the paperwork. If you go charging over there, throwing fists and assaulting them, regardless of how much they deserve it, do you not think that might make your case a little more complicated?”

Tony didn’t give a damn, truthfully. He had the best lawyers money could buy, he could probably blow Little Whining to pieces and his lawyer could still spin it to make him look like a hero.

“Go home and eat dinner with little Stark Junior,” Natasha said, her voice uncharacteristically gentle. “Get your legal shit in order, then we’ll handle the bastards, alright?”

“Not alright,” Tony sneered. He yanked his wrists from Clint’s grip and threw himself in his chair. “When’s the last time she saw Harry?”

“The night before he showed up,” Bruce offered, taking his own seat as Tony conceded the points. “Neither of them knew Ramsey either. They thought he ran off. The kid said Harry looked rough all summer, twitchy and anxious.”

“No mystery why, is there?” Steve said. “Poor kid.”

“Jesus Christ.” Tony had the urge to break something. “So did Harry run off, happen to run into Ramsey, or…?”

“Or did he already know Ramsey and he went to him when the abuse got too bad?” Bruce asked, following Tony’s train of thought with creepy accuracy. “Ramsey knew you were Harry’s dad, and Harry didn’t have any money that Petunia knew of, so someone had to buy the plane ticket for him.”

“Harry was probably easy pickings for a creep like Ramsey; abused and neglected kids usually are.”

“Shut up,” Tony told Natasha, mental exhaustion creeping over him. He closed his eyes and tried to pretend that he didn’t get rid of one piece of shit from his son’s life only to gain two more. “Oh, wait.” Tony pulled his phone from his pocket and called his business manager.

“Hey, Morris, how are you? Great, do me a favor. There’s a company based out of London, Grunnings, they’re a drill manufacturing and sales company. Buy them, today, whatever the cost. Don’t call me until it’s done.”

Tony could feel the curious eyes of his team on him as the jet took off for New York, but he wasn’t explaining.

Vernon and Petunia Dursley would beg for death by the time Tony finished with them. The longer he had to wait to ruin the people who hurt his son, the more creative he was going to get.

And Tony’s brilliance was only equal to his creativity.

 

The others talked quietly about who slipped Bruce the note, and how they managed to do it. The leading theory was that it was Ramsey himself when they first arrived, though that was a weak theory that Tony didn’t even have to speak for them to see the multiple gaping holes in it.

Tony sat in silent contemplation as they flew, watching the sun dip lower and lower, wondering how he was supposed to handle having a kid with as many problems as his had.

The one thing he did though, after receiving confirmation of his new business acquisition, was send out a mass email, redirecting all questions and problems for the week to be directed to Pepper and emphasizing that he didn’t want to be bothered even if the aliens returned and the entire business burst into flames.

 

He had plenty to do and finally getting to spend time with his kid, even if they just sat glaring at walls together, was top priority.

 

Tony stepped off the elevator and the first thing he heard was the one thing he needed more than anything in that moment.

Harry laughing. Not his little sarcastic laugh or his quiet and nervous one, but a truly happy sounding one.

It ended almost immediately when Tony stepped in the living room and was graced with the sight of his son sitting cross legged on the floor, a little black and brown puppy on his lap chewing on a bone bigger than its entire body. Harry had stopped laughing when he spotted Tony, and he moved his hand protectively over the pup when he caught Tony looking at it.

Probably worried that Tony would rip away that tiny little source of comfort, as everyone else ripped happiness from Harry at every given opportunity.

A depressing thought, honestly.

“Hey, you’re back.” Pepper smiled up at Tony from where she was nestled in a cozy blanket on one corner of the leather couch. “They delivered the new fridge today, we saved you dinner. Harry said you wanted lamb-kabobs.”

“That doesn’t sound very evil of you,” Tony said, referring to a joke Pepper made on the phone earlier. He sat on the floor, facing Harry, but with plenty of space between them. “Puppies and kabobs? I think I’ve met babies with more evil plans than you’ve got, kid.”

Harry scoffed and pulled the dog up in his hands. “We’re the good guys, actually. Some of us don’t go around breaking buildings and attacking innocent aliens.”

Tony laughed at Harry’s sarcasm, juggling to match this abrasive and prickly kid with the one he’d found out so much about that day.

Tony reached out to pet the dog, “Does it help if I told you I paid for the repairs?”

“Not especially, no.” Harry kept the dog out of Tony’s reach and hastily got to his feet. “As I’m still here, I’m going to sleep.” He hesitated as he hugged the dog to his chest, bone and all. “This- he can stay while I’m here, right? Like you said?”

“Yeah.” Tony leaned back on his hands and nodded up at Harry. “That’s fine. I mean, I think I’m much too young and handsome to be a grandpa yet, but he’s pretty cute, so I’ll let it go this time.”

Harry’s eyes flashed with some sort of indecipherable emotion, but his face was blank as he nodded at Tony. “Er… thanks.” He looked over at Pepper and smiled more genuinely, “I’ll see you later?”

“Any time we need a meeting, shoot me a text,” Pepper winked. “Goodnight, Harry.”

“How’d you get him to like you?” Tony whined the moment Harry’s bedroom door was shut. He climbed off the floor and slumped on the opposite armrest from Pepper. “I’ve been trying for days!”

“It’s because I’m cooler,” Pepper said, adorably serious. “It might help that I don’t look like you all do.”

“Oh yeah?” Tony grinned and raised his brows, “And how do we all look?”

“Intimidating,” Pepper said bluntly, wiping the smile off Tony’s face. “You ready to tell me about your secret mission now?”

“You could have said hot, I could use the ego boost,” Tony scoffed. He rolled his eyes as Pepper lifted one of her brows at him, “Fine. Don’t interrupt until I’m done or I’m not going to get through it all. I warn you, it’s not a pretty story.”

 

Pepper was a good audience, really. She huffed and sighed and rolled her eyes every now and again, but she looked savagely happy when Tony described their encounter with Ramsey. And, apparently she had fallen in love with the kid during their single day together, because her eyes filled up with tears at the end of the story.

 

“Poor Harry,” she whispered. She sent a sad look toward Harry’s closed door. “He’s a good kid, Tony, not like you at all really.”

“A good kid with a shit story,” Tony said, too down to even banter with her. “His best friend is a pedophile and I’m going to have to explain to him that there is no Russia-ever-after for them.”

“Mmm… I think you’re looking at this all wrong,” Pepper said as she stretched her legs out and wiggled her socked feet in Tony’s lap. “I don’t think Ramsey is Harry’s friend. Does Ramsey even have any connection to your old friends?”

“Lovers,” Tony corrected her with a wink he didn’t feel. “And I have no idea, why?”

Pepper smiled her perfected ‘for a genius, you’re an idiot’ smile. “Because whoever Harry’s friend is, they knew his parents pretty well. So they must have been close friends with him, right?”

Tony had considered that, but then he disregarded it. “Or, as Harry got older, the guy recognized me, I am pretty famous you know, in his features and sent him here on a good guess.”

“You’re wrong,” Pepper’s smile stretched wide. “He definitely knew them well enough to know that they both hooked up with you.”

Tony ignored the opportunity to think about the young, pretty, couple he’d once spent time with in favor of looking up and studying the ceiling contemplatively.

“Jarvis!”

“Yes, sir?”

“Is Harry asleep?”

“He is in bed, sir. As is Mister Arsehole.”

Tony snickered quietly, trust Harry to have told Jarvis that was his dog’s name. ‘Arsehole’, the kid was a riot. Actually- Pepper was studying her light pink manicure with a small smile -maybe it wasn’t Harry at all who told Jarvis that.

“Excellent,” Tony told Jarvis. “Can you cross reference Alexander Ramsey with Lily Evans-Potter, James Potter, and all their known relatives or associates? See if there’s any overlap?”

“Yes, sir, checking now.”

Tony waited as patiently as he was able until Jarvis spoke up again after less than a minute.

“There is no known overlap that I can find, sir. Aside from living in the same country, they don’t seem to have crossed paths.”

Tony frowned. “Then I need you to find everything on every acquaintance of Lily and James Potter you can and send it to me. Prioritize the names, the closer they were, the higher up in the list I want them.”

Tony and Pepper waited for a few moments for Jarvis to work, then she crowded her head beside Tony’s as files began popping up on his phone.

“There,” she pointed at the very first name on the list, “Harry called his friend ‘Siri’ a few times.”

“Which is either a nickname for one Sirius Black, or it’s…” Tony trailed off after he clicked the name. “Fuck,” he breathed. “I remember him.”

Tony had five files for Sirius Black: a birth certificate, two parking tickets, a report of arrest for an act of domestic terrorism, and a report of his escape from prison. The photo attached to his escape showed a crazy man with hollow eyes, stringy hair, but those aristocratic facial features were hard to forget.

The Sirius that Tony remembered had been young, handsome, bright, and funny. He’d laughed about everything, been passionate about music and motorcycles, and…

“He’d been best friends with James,” Tony said quietly. His lips twisted in a wry smile, “I tried to convince him to go back to the Potters’ house with us once, and he and James both freaked out and cried that they were brothers and I was disgusting. They had another friend, Moon, I think they called him, and he looked interested, but he was shy, apparently.”

“You are disgusting,” Pepper said with a crinkled nose. “God, Tony, you were just going to sleep with all of them?”

Tony shrugged and read over Sirius’ very sparsely detailed arrest report, “I was definitely going to try. They were all very pretty and very… very free spirited,” he said as he struggled to find a way to describe the lively group of friends. “Hippy souls, really, hard to find nowadays.”

“Was Sirius free spirited enough to blow up a city block and kill thirteen people?”

Tony frowned, a reminder of something niggling in his brain. “Was it twelve or thirteen people?”

Pepper read the same line he did, “Thirteen.”

“‘Don’t kill any muggles while I’m gone, twelve was plenty’,” Tony said, quoting something Harry said to Ramsey before he left for his flight. “Odds on Sirius Black killing thirteen people and Ramsey secretly killing twelve?”

“Odds on your son befriending both a pedophile and a terrorist who escaped from prison, you mean?” Pepper snorted. “Low, but much lower than alien attacks. And with your genes at play, who knows?”

Oh yeah, because apparently Sirius Black was an escaped convict. It had been on every media outlet in England a couple of summers ago that Sirius Black was armed, dangerous, and there was a heavy reward that came along with his capture.

“This is him,” Tony sighed. He rubbed his eyes wearily as he felt confidence seeping in his bones. “This is the friend he’d always talking about. Harry said his friend was dangerous and would kill for him, I guess that’s true enough.”

“He also said that he needed to be somewhere that his friend wouldn’t get extradited for his crimes,” Pepper added.

“I guess a terrorist is a little less terrifying than a pedophile,” Tony said optimistically, uncertain how Ramsey fit in the new picture that was revealing itself. “It doesn’t explain where Harry was during the school years though, because I didn’t find any proof anywhere that the kid went to school past eleven.”

Which meant that Petunia had somehow managed to lie to the human lie detector.

Tony couldn’t wait to crush that family beneath the heel of his boot. Preferably, beneath the heel of his Iron Man boot.

“Hmm… so the theory is that Sirius told Harry about his parentage, then Ramsey drove him to the airport the night Harry ran away?”

“Or one of them kidnapped him, trying to help him?” Tony felt a headache beginning to build and wished that Harry would just give him the answers. Maybe he would, during their week together. Tony could build some trust, ask some questions, eventually maybe even get some answers?

Pepper snagged the phone from Tony’s unresisting hands. “When did James and Lily die?”

Tony rattled the date off automatically. It was hard to forget the date that his kid became a supposed orphan left alone in a shit world with shit guardians.

Tony had checked his calendar after he saw when James and Lily had died; he’d been in Malibu at the time. The morning after Tony’s son was left alone, orphaned, Tony had been in the paper with a couple supermodels he met somewhere.

It had been the first time he felt disgusting for his playboy behavior.

“So this guy who turned you down for sex because James Potter was his brother just went out and blew up a whole crowd of people hours after his brother died and his nephew was orphaned?”

“Give me that.” Tony snatched the phone right back from Pepper and read through the reports again. It hadn’t been such a long gap between when Tony partied with James, Lily, and Sirius and when the Potter’s died that Sirius was arrested. And, if Sirius was the one taking care of Harry recently or even talking with him, then Tony couldn’t understand why Sirius would go off and commit some act of terrorism instead of taking care of Harry right off the bat.

~~~~~

“This is my best mate, Sirius,” James shouted over the music pulsing in the club, his eyes were bright with liquor and laughter. Even without moving, James was thrumming with the endless energy Tony knew he possessed. He had his arm around the shoulders of another guy; young, handsome, sparkling grey eyes that gave the impression that he was up to something.

“Best mate?” The guy, Sirius, laughed and tried to ruffle James’ messy black hair, James ducked and Sirius laughed again. “I thought we were brothers, Prongs? I’m telling Effie!”

James straightened back up and smiled over at his brother with unabashed love gleaming in his hazel eyes. “We are brothers,” he said earnestly. “One day we’ll have a little Padfoot or Prongs Junior to teach all our tricks to, eh?”

Sirius threw his head back, his black curls catching the club lights, and laughed, causing James to laugh as well.

“What’s that mean?” Tony had asked Lily, referring to the Padfoot and Prongs bit.

Lily threw back her shot of tequila like a pro and laughed brightly, always so bright. “It means they agreed to be godfather for each other’s poor kids when they were twelve and Sirius is going to spoil my future children rotten.”

 

Tony had shuddered dramatically, creeped out by the idea of children.

Lily had been pregnant with his child within a week from that conversation.

~~~~~

“Godfather,” Tony said absently, remembering the first time he met Sirius. “Harry said that his friend was- is his family. It’s this guy, Sirius.”

Pepper gave Tony a much appreciated sympathetic look. “So what are you going to do?” she asked quietly. “This is different, Tony, this isn’t some pervert preying on your son. This seems like someone who helped take him out of an abusive situation at real personal risk.”

“Yeah…” Tony groaned up at the ceiling again. “I can’t just have him thrown in prison, can I?”

“You could,” Pepper said slowly, “or you could find out why Sirius was building bombs the day his brother died?”

Tony laughed bitterly, why couldn’t his kid just come with a knocked up girlfriend or something simple? No, he had to come with a pedophile, abusive relatives, and a terrorist. “Sure, Pep, I’ll just call him. ‘Hey, Sirius, remember that time we raced our motorcycles and you cheated? Good times, anyway, why are you a terrorist now?’”

Pepper shrugged, “You have his number, right? If it wasn’t Ramsey that Harry’s been texting, then it has to be Sirius. Send him a message, see if he’ll meet you.” She put a gentle hand on Tony’s shoulder and smiled sweetly, manipulative woman that she was. “I think Harry cares a lot about him. Plus, that report stinks like something fishy, Tony. Who writes up terrorism so sparsely?”

The report was pretty damn bare. In fact… Tony double checked and saw that the prison Sirius broke out of wasn’t even listed.

“It wouldn’t hurt to find out more about this whole thing before making any decisions, would it? I know that’s not your usual style, thinking first,” Pepper winked, “but would you do it for Harry?”

Tony was beginning to think there wasn’t anything he wouldn’t do for the kid.

“You stay away from my son,” Tony told her playfully as he closed the folders on his phone and pulled up his his messages. “I don’t need him bossing me around with the whip. One of you is bad enough.”

Pepper smiled, probably happy with the description like the task-master she was, and leaned over so she could see the message Tony quickly typed out.

Hey, it’s Tony. Remember the time we raced our bikes and you cheated to win? Good times. Anyway, I think it’s time we reconnected in person, catch up, don’t you agree? Let me know when and where we can meet. I’ll come to you, obviously.

Tony clicked send and the two of them released heavy sighs.

“And now we wait,” Pepper murmured.

Tony glanced toward the closed door that his son slept peacefully behind.

“And now we wait,” he agreed.

***

3,500 miles away, Sirius Black laid on his bed in his bedroom, Hedwig standing on his stomach, as he stared at the message he’d just gotten. Not from Harry, but from Harry’s father, Tony.

“What do you think, girl?” Sirius whispered. He reached out and stroked Hedwig’s wing while he thought over this unexpected development. “Press that little block button and leave Harry to his new little family of heroes or message him back?”

Hedwig hooted softly.

“Not a damn thing,” Sirius said slowly, pretending that Hedwig asked ‘What have you got to lose?’ “Everything to gain though, eh?”

Hedwig hooted again and Sirius grinned while he reread Tony’s message.

He had actually cheated when they’d raced. He’d managed to pull off a small burst of wandless magic and moved a rubbish bin to block Tony, sending him veering off course and letting Sirius win the race.

I won fair and square. Give me some time to think of a time and place, my life’s a bit complicated as you might have guessed. We’ll talk soon.

Then, just to be annoying, Sirius sent a giraffe and a kiwi picture.

 

Let Tony puzzle over that while Sirius tried to figure out a way for them to meet that didn’t end up with a damp cell and dementors.

“Padfoot, please, let’s just go,” Harry whispered. He kept shooting glances up at the tower behind him, probably looking paranoid. “Why can’t we fly to Russia or somewhere like I did here? We don’t need new identities.”

“It can’t be that bad, kiddo, what’s wrong?”

Harry sank to the ground, sitting in the grass and letting Joey jump all over him with soft little yips and barks. “He keeps talking to me,” Harry said quickly. “Asking me stuff, telling me stuff, I hate it here. I miss you, I just want to go. Before it gets- gets more complicated.”

Joey, one of those complications, let out a bark that sounded indignant enough to make Sirius laugh on the other end of the phone.

“Little Arsehole over there doesn’t seem to agree,” Sirius said playfully. “What kind of questions is he asking?”

“Everything!” Harry wailed, knowing he sounded like a little kid but not caring much as it was only Sirius he was talking to. “What food do I like?”

“Treacle tart.”

“What kind of stuff do I like about school?”

“Eating, flying, and mysteries.”

“What are my ‘goals for the future’?”

“Making it to twenty.”

“And he even bloody asked if I ever dated anyone!”

“Did you tell him about Parvati?”

“No,” Harry scowled, “I did not tell him about Parvati, I told him to piss off then brought Joey outside to use the bathroom.”

“Harry, did you tell him anything?”

“No.”

Sirius sighed on his end of the phone. “Harry, he’s trying to get to know you. Why won’t you let him?”

“Because I don’t want him to know anything,” Harry hissed. “And- and there’s all that freaky stuff I can’t talk about.”

And Harry didn’t want to tell him things about himself. Tony had tried all through breakfast and lunch, cornering Harry as he felt guilty keeping Joey locked up in a single room when he had so much energy. Harry had tried to subtly ask if he had work to do (‘Do you not have anything better to do?’) and found out that Tony cancelled an entire week worth of work to ‘spend time with his son and grandson’.

“Don’t call it freaky stuff, Harry,” Sirius said, well, seriously. “It’s magic and you can tell him. I don’t know the laws in America all that well, but they put videos of Loki the Trickster God on the telly, so they’re obviously not hiding much, are they? ALSO,” he raised his voice when Harry scoffed, “you’re Tony’s son, so that means he can know. He could have known the moment he knocked up a witch.”

Harry felt something twist in his gut that felt a lot like panic. “Padfoot, it’s still us, right? You didn’t- you didn’t change your mind? Right?”

“Harry, I’ll never change my mind about you. You can tell Tony that your godfather is a convicted mass murderer and I’d still love you. Oh, hey, by the way, did you tell him anything about me?”

“Yeah, Pads, right off the bat I said ‘the friend I need an identity for is an escaped inmate, don’t worry, we’ll send you letters’,” Harry scoffed. “No, you daft prat, I didn’t.”

Sirius laughed, “Just checking. I don’t care if you do, kiddo, he’s your dad, tell him what you want.”

“Guess that’s nothing then,” Harry sighed. He held tight to Joey’s leash as he tried to take off after a bird. “Good talk, Padfoot, I’ve got to get back to interrogations now. I- I miss you. Oh! Wait! Send me some bloody money, Pads, seriously, I need toothpaste, you git.”

“Have your dad buy it,” Sirius quipped cheerily. “Love you, kiddo, text message me later?”

“Nope.” Harry grinned when he hung up on his godfather. “Oi! Arsehole! C’mon,” Harry clicked his tongue and gave Joey’s leash a gentle tug. “Let’s get back to interrogations, eh?”

Joey barked and tried to leap up in Harry’s arms, which made him grin. If nothing else, Tony showing Harry where the fenced in ‘backyard’ behind Stark Tower, was useful. Harry didn’t really fancy walking up and down the sidewalk in the sweltering heat with the tiny pup as they tried to not get ran over by the crowds always speed walking or stopping to gawk and take photos.

It was mildly ironic that Harry went from being famous for having dead parents, to having a parent who was probably just as famous as Harry.

At least no crazy witches or wizards ever tried to take photographs in front of the Dursley house. Although… Harry thought about it as he and Joey slipped on to the posh lift to take them back to the top floor… they probably would have, if they’d known where Harry lived.

An incredibly creepy thought, honestly.

Harry sighed heavily when he stepped off the lift and saw Tony waiting for him on the sofa.

He smiled at Harry and held up a video game controller. “You any good at Xbox?”

Harry rolled his eyes. The closest he ever got to playing Xbox was when he cleaned Dudley’s controllers for him.

“Seven year running champion,” Harry said drily. “I was born with a controller in my hand.”

“You can joke if you want, but my mom, your grandma, said that I was born with a circuit board in mine,” Tony grinned. “And since I was the reigning champion eight years ago, how about a game?”

Harry set Joey on the floor and watched him carefully as he ran straight to his basked of chew toys by Harry’s bedroom door. “No.”

Tony stuck his lower lip out in a pout that looked ridiculous on his grown face. “Pleaseee?”

Harry stayed firm, “No.”

“Fine.” Tony ducked his head and sniffled, he was a dramatic git, really. “I guess I’ll just go back to asking you a million questions about yourself.”

“I don’t actually know how to play,” Harry said hastily. “I’ve never played before.”

“Never played before?” Tony lifted his head and Harry could see the glimmer in his eyes that meant he sensed an easy victory in swindling Harry into playing. “Then you have to learn! What else are you and your dozens of friends going to do when they come over? Get drunk and steal my car?”

Harry and his friend had stolen a car before, actually. He grinned a little at the reminder and moved to the sitting room. Tony patted the sofa cushion, but Harry sat on the floor with his back resting against it instead so Joey could sit with him when he was done chasing his tennis ball.

“That was the first choice,” Harry told Tony. “Second choice was getting pissed and stealing your flying suit.”

Tony laughed and tossed one of the wireless black controllers to Harry. “Well now you can invite people over and play Xbox instead.”

Harry scowled as Tony turned on the telly and the video game screen came to life. “I’m not inviting people over because one, I don’t have friends here, two, I don’t need friends here, because three, I’m leaving soon.”

“Or you stay forever and I make you your own flying suit.”

Harry twisted his neck so quick to look at Tony that he was certain the man brief saw the flash of excitement in his eyes before he snapped that trunk closed and glowered at him.

“I’m not staying forever, I am leaving,” Harry grit out.

“Sure, kid,” Tony had the audacity to wink, as if it were funny to try and constantly talk Harry into abandoning his family. “In the meantime though, you ready to get your next driving lesson?”

Harry watched the screen shift to a snow covered road with sleekly designed cars zooming all over it and jerked his chin in a nod. “If you’re ready to get your arse kicked.”

Joey barked, which made Harry laugh.

“I knew he’d respond to it eventually,” he said fondly. He pat the floor beside him and clicked his tongue, “C’mon, buddy, come help me win.”

Joey did sit with Harry, chewing away on his giant chew bone, but Harry still lost, repeatedly.

“It shouldn’t be so bloody hard!” Harry yelled after they’d been playing for well over an hour and Harry lost well over half a dozen times. He mashed the button Tony told him would make him accelerate and growled along with Joey when he drove off a cliff in the game. “This is- is bollocks!”

Tony laughed and then cheered when his bloody fucking car crossed the finish line. “Undefeated!” he cried. He grinned at Harry held his controller up. “Tenth times the charm?”

Harry hated that game. “Fine,” he spat. He jumped to his feet to get a drink before the new round began, “I’m winning this time.”

“Keep telling yourself that and maybe it’ll work,” Tony called over his shoulder to Harry. “Did you never play video games with any of your old friends?”

Harry was distracted as he opened the fridge and looked through the endless groceries that Pepper delivered for a normal drink. “No. Ron’s family didn’t have a telly and I never went to Hermione’s.”

Harry didn’t even realize his slip up until he brought back two bottles of water and handed Tony one and retook his seat on the floor.

“They go to your school?”

Damn.

He hadn’t meant to say that.

“No,” Harry snapped, closing the subject. “And you said if I played, you wouldn’t ask questions.”

“Hey, no questions here,” Tony said innocently before smirking, “Ready to lose?”

Harry was ready to win.

 

“You probably cheated,” Harry grumbled as he poked at the pasta Tony ordered for dinner. Harry dropped a piece of chicken to the floor for Joey and grinned as the puppy attacked it with ferocity.

“I did not,” Tony sniffed haughtily. “I mean, I tried, obviously, but it’s hard to cheat at racing. It’s all in the thumbs, kid,” he wiggled his thumbs and Harry laughed a little.

“We could play again tomorrow? If you want?” Harry said slowly, ducking his head as he did. “Unless you don’t want to lose?”

Tony’s smile was ear to ear when Harry did peek up at him through his fringe.

“I’ve got an incredibly important meeting that I can’t just send Pepper to do at eight then I’m all yours,” he said with enough enthusiasm to make Harry feel hot. “I’ll make you a pro gamer in no time.”

Harry shrugged, he didn’t really care about being a pro, it had just been a nice way to waste time, then looked outside and felt his eyes snag on the sunset.

“It’s pretty here,” Harry said quietly. “I used to watch the sunset at school, sometimes, it was peaceful.”

Technically, Harry used to sit in the Astronomy Tower after classes ended, eating food the twins snuck to him, in an effort to talk to Sirius and hide from his classmates and their whispers and their badges.

~~~~~

“I hate it here, Sirius,” Harry whispered one night as he slumped against the wall and watched the sun go down. “Everyone here hates me, or thinks I’m mad, or thinks I’m an attention seeking prat, or thinks it was some wicked prank.”

“Ron still not talking to you?” Sirius asked, his voice gentle and coaxing. “He’ll come around, Harry. Not that you should forgive him when he does, not quickly anyway. James and Rem didn’t talk to me for the second half of our fifth year.”

Harry swallowed harshly and tried to shrug away the hurt of his first friend’s rejection. “Were you lonely?”

“Terribly. Are you now?”

“Terribly,” Harry admitted. He tried to rub at his face in a natural seeming gesture to keep the single traitorous tear from being seen by Sirius. “I hate it here,” he said again, also hating the plaintive tone to his voice. “I wish I could come live with you. We could run away, you could teach me magic.”

Sirius smiled sadly. “You’ll be happy there again, Harry, just hold on and keep your chin high.”

Harry laughed and it sounded as hollow as he felt. “Or I could jump over the rail and be done with it all.”

Sirius blanched in the mirror before he brought it right up close to his face. “Don’t ever say that again, Harry James, or I’ll come kidnap you right now and never let you out of my sight.”

Harry was the one who smiled sadly at that. He wouldn’t say it again, even if it sometimes sounded like a brilliant idea, but… “Wish you would, Sirius.”

“I wish I could too.”

~~~~~

“We should go to Malibu next weekend,” Tony said, breaking Harry from the morose thoughts the sunset always brought him. “Have you ever seen the ocean?”

“Does flying over it count?”

“Technically? Yes. For the purpose of going to Malibu, seeing the ocean, and staying in the second greatest city in the country? No.”

Harry took a last bite of the pasta before pushing it away. “Why do you say stuff like that?” he sighed. He narrowed his eyes and Tony and shook his head. “You’re getting your hopes up and you’re going to be disappointed when I leave.”

Tony quirked his brow and smirked a little, “So don’t leave.”

Harry scowled and got to his feet, snatching Joey quickly off the floor. “Oh, I’m leaving,” he said firmly. “Soon. So you can- you can just go to Malibu with your little team of heroes and I’ll be in Russia watching the sunset.”

“Or you and I can go see Russia the weekend after next,” Tony called to him with his damn unwavering smile and seemingly endless cheer. “Night, kid!”

Harry didn’t slam his door, always certain that would be the last straw before Tony snapped, but he did give him a last withering look over his shoulder. “Goodnight.”

Joey barked at Harry and Harry narrowed his eyes at him.

“We can’t stay,” he told him firmly. He felt his resolve waved for less than a second before reminding himself that his actual family needed his help.

Sirius was the one person that Harry wouldn’t abandon. Sirius never abandoned Harry, and Harry wouldn’t do it to him. Harry had been useless and worthless for too long, he wouldn’t be selfish and take the cowards way out this time.

Harry shucked his jeans off and climbed in bed with Joey, putting him on the pillow beside his own. “As soon as that paperwork is ready, we’re out of here.”

Joey whined and Harry smiled faintly.

“You’ll like Sirius,” he told him softly as he reached out to pet him until he settled down on the pillow. “He’ll chase you around and it’ll be brilliant, okay?”

Harry watched Joey close his eyes and waited until he seemed to have fallen asleep before he flicked on the rock lamp, rolled onto his back, and stared up at the ceiling.

“It’ll be brilliant,” he whispered to himself. “You can’t stay.”

 

Just before Harry slipped off into a, surprisingly, peaceful slumber, he wondered if Sirius would like video games or not.

 

Probably not.

 

Harry had gotten up early the next morning by habit instead of in a panic. A nice change of pace that Harry couldn’t count on.

He took Joey outside and they sat in the backyard for a while, throwing a ball around, Harry struggling to teach the hyper puppy how to sit. By the time they went inside, the sun was already scorching and Harry realized he was starving.

“Good morning, my favorite son.”

Harry rolled his eyes at Tony, who was sitting on the kitchen counter with a white coffee mug in his hands. Tony was already dressed in a pair of dress pants and an untucked shirt, and Harry realized that he must have been outside through Tony’s ‘important meeting’.

“By your logic, I’m also your least favorite son,” Harry drawled at him. He ignored Tony’s laughter as he got out Joey’s bag of dog food and made sure he had full bowls of both food and water.

“You know they make automatic food dishes,” Tiny said brightly. “Then you wouldn’t have to feed him every time, it would just release his portion of food in the dish at the preset time.”

“I know that,” Harry said coolly, “Pepper showed them to me at the store.”

Tony waved toward a box of donuts, a breakfast Harry had began to realize was a favorite of his, and Harry snagged one of the raspberry ones before sitting at the counter and eating it slowly.

“I didn’t realize you liked slaving over that little spoiled pup all day,” Tony grinned. “I just thought automatic feeders would make your life easier.”

Harry sniffed and crinkled his nose. “Arsehole is not spoiled,” he said hotly. “And I don’t slave over him. Those dishes were over a hundred dollars each.”

“So?”

“So?” Harry gave him a blank look. “You might have missed it, as often as you leave me alone, but I’m not exactly employed right now, am I?”

“I’ll give you $5,000 right now if you tell me where you went to school,” Tony offered with a smirk.

“No.”

“$10,000?”

“No.”

“$50,000 and a second dog?

Harry narrowed his eyes at him. “And if I told you?”

“Then I’d write you a check and take you to cash it,” Tony said simply. “My money is your money, kid.”

Harry scoffed and pinched off a bit of his donut for something to do with his hands. “I don’t need your money. My parents left me money.”

“Do you need help getting access to it?” Tony asked him curiously.

Harry nearly laughed. As if Tony could access Harry’s Gringotts vault. “No,” he said, probably sounding more amused than he should.

“What did your parents do for work?”

Harry looked up, caught by surprise by a question that wasn’t about himself. Tony looked genuine, and Harry couldn’t see how it would hurt to answer questions about his parents.

“Er… my mum didn’t have a job, she’d barely been out of school when she had me. I think one of their friends told me she wanted to train with one of my teachers though. And my dad was a- a police man. Him and his best mate joined after they graduated.”

Tony’s brows show up on his forehead. “James became a cop? That’s a hell of a plot twist,” he laughed. “When I met him I swear the guy partied more than I did, and I partied a lot.”

Harry pinched at his donut some more and watched himself crumble it up as he hesitantly asked, “Will you tell me about them?”

“Excellent lovers.”

Harry sputtered and looked up with bright red cheeks. “Not that!” he cried. “Bloody hell. I don’t want to hear that. I meant- I meant what they were like when you met them!”

Tony laughed at Harry’s embarrassment, probably he said that solely to embarrass him and kicked his feet as he took a sip of his coffee and considered it.

“Tell me about Ron and Hermione and I’ll tell you about James and Lily. Deal?”

Harry narrowed his eyes. “You’d blackmail me into telling me about my dead parents?”

“Blackmail?” Tony adopted a wide eyed look of surprise that didn’t truly suit him. “It’s called a deal, kid, we’re good at them, wouldn’t you say?”

“Not particularly, no.” Harry didn’t really have much to lose. He’d already said his friends’ names, and it wasn’t really questions about Harry, so… “Fine,” he rolled his eyes. “Deal. You first.”

“Let’s see…” Tony hummed and looked out the window, his eyes unfocused. “James was a good dancer, shockingly. He had like energy you could just sense, never stood still,” Tony laughed. “He talked damn fast too, kid. And, Jesus Christ, do you know how easily he made friends? He’d just walk up to people and start talking and then suddenly they’d be the best of friends.”

So more undeniable evidence that Harry wasn’t James’ actual son.

“Lily, your mom, she was… she was snarky, but in a fun way, you know? When she got sick of dancing, she’d just sit off to the side with one of their friends and make little comments, usually making fun of James honestly. She rated everyone’s dance skills once, and they had a friend- Moon, I think? -that she told him, right to his face, he was a ‘bloody awkward dancer’.”

Harry felt a jolt of surprise at hearing ‘Moon’. “Moony, you mean?”

Tony snapped his fingers and nodded at Harry, “That’s it! Moony! You know him? Tall guy, shaggy brown hair, dresses like Steve on a cold autumn night?”

Harry laughed at the mental image of Steve wearing one of Lupin’s cardigans. “Yeah, he- er- he taught at my school in my third year.”

“Moony becoming a teacher, James becoming a cop…” Tony sighed dramatically and shook his head. “That’s like me becoming a parent, kid. I guess we all grew up.”

“Mm… but you’re not really a parent, are you?”

“I am offended.” Tony put his mug down and hopped off the counter, choosing to move over by Harry to grab a donut and a seat at the counter. “I’m totally a parent,” he said, his voice muffled around the donut, “Grandparent too,” he added as Joey began jumping at his feet. “It’s your turn now, tell me about Ron and Hermione.”

Harry scowled, but they did make a deal. “Hermione likes to read and Ron’s really funny.”

“Wow, I really feel like I know them now,” Tony deadpanned. “I should have made you go first so I could say ‘James made friends with strangers and Lily made fun of them’.”

Harry laughed, Tony had given Harry details he didn’t know before. He ran a hand through his hair as he thought about his friends. “Er… alright, so Hermione is smart, kind of bossy, and likes to learn about anything. She’s mad about exams and homework and she’s got a cat, great big fluffy orange thing, and she’s mad about him too. And Ron… well he was my first friend there and… he’s funny, easy-going, and he’s wicked good at chess. He’s patient too, not like Hermione. And… er… my other friend reckons they’re in love.”

And he missed them terribly is what he didn’t add.

“Oh my God.” Tony’s eyes were wide and Harry felt a swoop of unease in his stomach. “Kid, that’s the most you’ve ever said to me before.”

Harry immediately clamped his mouth shut and turned his face back to the donut he’d been toying with more than actually eating.

They sat in silence for a while, aside from Joey’s yips as he looked out the window and jumped on the glass, spotting birds and planes and other things he wanted to chase.

“You wanna see the flying suit you’re definitely not trying to steal?”

Harry had been washing his hands and he accidentally splashed himself with water as quickly as he spun around. “Really?”

Tony was beaming and nodding. “What’s mine is yours, kid. Congrats, you’re rich and you own a lot of scrap metal. Come on, let me show you my favorite toys.”

Harry only hesitated for a second.

 

“Wow,” Harry breathed. His eyes were surely as round as galleons as he looked over the flying suit Tony preferred (because he had more than one, apparently, which was mad). Harry lifted his hand and lightly touched the red and gold metal, more proof that Tony would have been a Gryffindor. “You really made this?”

“I did.” Tony sounded proud instead of arrogant. He was fiddling with a robot (‘DUM-E’, apparently) and turned to wink at Harry, “No matter how cute you are, you can’t have a flying suit until you’re sixteen, no! Wait! Seventeen.”

Harry laughed and figured it would be pointless to remind him again that he wouldn’t be there when he was seventeen. He wandered over to where Tony was and handed him the slim metal tool he’d been reaching for. “Why seventeen?”

Tony nodded gratefully for the tool and immediately began attacking the machine with it. He was focused and careful, even though it didn’t seem like it at first. “Because when you’re eighteen you’ll want to move out, so I figure seventeen is a good time to bribe you into staying forever. Hey, can you hand me that screw driver over there?”

Harry looked to where Tony gestured and furrowed his brows at the table top covered in tools. “Er… which one?”

Tony turned and looked had the grace to look momentarily sheepish. “The Phillips.”

Harry quirked a brow, “That answered nothing, you know.”

“Star head?”

“It’s like you’re speaking a different language, mate.”

Tony laughed and dropped the tool he had and wiped his hands off on a nearby oil stained rag. “You ready for the most important lesson of your life?”

Harry wasn’t, actually, but Tony taught him anyway.

 

They stayed down in Tony’s lab through lunch (Tony had a fridge filled with snacks they called a meal) while Tony taught Harry the difference between all the different tools and told Harry about his childhood.

“My dad didn’t have patience for tinkering, as he called it, that one’s a socket wrench… here, look…”

“Watch, here’s how you change the bits on there, different ones for different screws…”

“I invented this tool, needs a name still, but I made it when I was around your age, I showed it to my dad, proud as can be, and you know what he said?”

“What?”

“He told me to put my trash where it belonged and quit fooling around in the basement.” Tony laughed, but it didn’t sound happy, “Good old Dad.”

Harry frowned, “He didn’t like your inventions?”

“Nah.” Tony waved his hand then held up what looked like a screwdriver but had multiple prongs sticking out of it. “He worked a lot, and I was a disappointment. I never turned out the way he wanted.”

Harry bit his lip and considered that while Tony taught him how to use yet another tool he created himself. Harry’s eyes kept flicking over to the gleaming Iron Man suit that Tony wore to save the world.

Tony saved the world, and Harry fled from a war he caused. Tony saved lives and Harry killed Cedric.

Harry didn’t know how a parent could be disappointed in Tony with his intelligence and his ideas and his endless energy, but Harry knew how it felt being a disappointment.

 

The rest of the afternoon was surprisingly… comfortable.

They took Joey out for a short walk around the block, both wearing hats and sunglasses and generally looking ridiculous. Tony pointed out distant buildings and told Harry he’d take him to see them, give him ‘a real tourist tour of New York’.

Then Tony taught Harry how to play a different game on his Xbox, a fighting game with ‘ninjas’, and they argued about whether the pink ninja was a girl or not while they ate Chinese food that Tony had delivered for dinner.

“Look, all I’m saying is that if you saw Natasha fighting, you’d understand why I have a healthy respect for women.”

Harry laughed after he took a bite of the noodles that had little bits of carrots in them. “Pepper said you don’t respect women at all and that psycho is probably meaner than the pink ninja.”

Tony laughed too and Harry realized they had a similar laugh, which was weird to think.

“Pepper talks a lot of shit for someone secretly in love with me,” he winked. “And Natasha can be… rough… but she’s got a heart beneath all that ice somewhere.”

“If you say so,” Harry said skeptically. He grinned a little when he saw Tony slip Joey pieces of the beef he was eating. “Quit trying to make him like you, it won’t work. Arsehole only likes me.”

Tony smirked when he reached down and Joey immediately began covering his hand in little puppy kisses.

“Traitor,” Harry told Joey fondly. “After all I’ve done for you.”

“Good job, buddy, this is why Grandpa ordered you a new feeder. Also so when your daddy forgets to feed you, you won’t starve,” Tony whispered loudly to Joey. “He’s very forgetful, he’s even forgotten to glare at me for at least ten minutes now.”

On cue, Harry scowled and offered Joey a piece of his own chicken. “Tell him we’ll be gone before it arrives,” Harry told Joey sternly.

“It’ll be here in the morning.”

Harry threw his hands up in exasperation. “I can’t take all this stuff with me! Quit buying things!”

“I can’t,” Tony said seriously. “It’s an addiction, I have an online shopping addiction, kid.”

“Then get help,” Harry snapped angrily. “But don’t buy anything else for me or for Arsehole. We’re leaving soon.”

“About that…” Tony slid a plastic card across the counter to Harry, causing Harry’s stomach to flip. “This is for you.”

Harry recognized what it was…

It was an ID card.

This was it.

He was really leaving.

Harry took a deep breath and reached out with his trembling hand while he reminded himself that Sirius needed him and Tony did not.

Sirius wanted him, Tony did not.

Harry stared at the ID, his surprise at seeing his own photo on the card momentarily distracting him from the rest of the information.

“Harry James Potter-Stark, 200 Park Avenue, Manhattan, New York City…” Harry’s eyes flew from the card to Tony and his jaw dropped. He tried to ask why but no sound would come out aside from a faint nose of shock in the back of his throat.

“Listen, kid…” Tony slowly put his hands on the counter and ducked his shoulders slightly so his face was more even with Harry’s. “I met with my lawyers this morning and… your aunt, Petunia, she signed off on her legal guardianship. I submitted the DNA results, did a bunch of legal mumbo jumbo, and… and it’s done now. We’re legally a family, like we should have been years ago.”

It shouldn’t have hurt, but it still managed to sting hearing that his mum’s sister just signed him away so easily.

Harry didn’t jump to his feet in anger as much as he literally fell from his chair from shock at Tony’s nervous sounding rant. Tony quickly moved to help him up, but Harry scooted away on his back.

“Don’t touch me!” he snapped. “You lied! You- We- WE HAD A DEAL!”

“Harry, you’re a kid, I can’t let you run off to Russia with a pedophile or a terrorist.”

Harry didn’t know what that was meant to mean, so he ignored it. He grabbed the couch and pulled himself to his feet shakily while Tony stayed beside the counter with a sad look he had no right to have on his face.

“I can’t stay,” Harry said, pleading and desperate and terrified. “My friend- my friend needs me to help him. Please,” Harry flung the card in his hand at Tony, “take it back.”

Tony didn’t move for the card that fell on the floor only a few feet from him. His shoulders curved inward though and he shook his head just once. “I can’t. It’s done.”

“You don’t get it!” Harry yelled, his mind fogging over with grief as he imagined what Sirius would say. “Please, Tony, please. You have to. I- my friend isn’t going to even talk to me if you can’t fix this. Please? I swear I’ll write or whatever, but he’s all I’ve got.”

A small part of Harry’s brain tried to tell him that he sounded insane, he sounded terrified and desperate. But, as he was terrified and desperate and insane, he ignored it as easily as he ignored the tears spilling over on his numb cheeks.

“Please?”

“I can’t, kid. This is for the best. This is where you belong. Your friend will—”

“HATE ME!” Harry screamed. “HE IS ALL I HAVE AND HE WILL HATE ME!”

Harry turned on his heel and strode in his room, slamming the door with all his might behind him.

He’d rather Tony come in and beat him unconscious than have to tell Sirius what happened.

 

Harry paced around the room, occasionally kicking furniture as a means to vent his fury, until a little scratch on his door reminded him of his actual friend in the flat.

Harry opened the door just enough for Joey to squeeze through, then slammed it shut once more. He stuck his ear to the door, trying to listen to prepare himself if pissed off footsteps came storming his way. Harry’s heart was pounding, rushing blood through his body at an unhealthy speed, but he didn’t hear anyone regardless.

“It’s time to face the music,” Harry told Joey flatly.

If Harry was truly, legally, not James’ son… Sirius wasn’t going to give a damn about him. Sirius would feel like Harry abandoned him, and that would be that.

Harry hadn’t wanted to trade his godfather for his father Tony Stark, but the decision was taken out of his hands.

As most decisions about Harry’s life were.

Harry sunk down to the floor against the cool windowed wall and tried to slow his breathing before he called Sirius.

If it was the last time Sirius wanted to talk to him, then Harry didn’t want to spend the time sniveling and whining.

Sirius answered on the fourth ring. “Harry? Are you okay?”

“No.” Harry cleared his throat and tried to speak in something more mature than a whisper, “Not really, no.”

“Kiddo, are you crying?? What happened?”

Harry touched his face and wasn’t even properly surprised to feel the wetness beneath his fingertips.

“He’s- he just…” Harry wiped his face on his shirt, knowing it was disgusting and still not stopping himself. “Sirius, he got custody,” he said brokenly, his eyes as empty as his chest felt. “He stuck his last name on mine. How am I supposed to leave now?”

“You don’t.”

“What?” Harry pushed Joey away when he tried to nuzzle him, then felt guilty as well as miserable, so he grabbed him and cradled him in his arms while he held the phone with his shoulder. “We- we’re supposed to leave, I said I’d come back for you, I’m not abandoning you, I just… I don’t know how now. He could call the cops and he isn’t going to help us. Tell me what to do, please.”

“Harry…” Sirius huffed loudly in the phone and Harry heard a hoot in the background that made him cradle Joey that much more securely. “I don’t want you to come back, I want you to stay there. It’s safe, you’re safe, you’ve got a family, someone who loves you and can take care of you. That’s where you belong, kiddo, with him. You belong with your dad.”

Harry was truly having a difficult time hearing him over the air rushing through his ears. “You… you don’t want me?” he repeated the key phrase in that statement dully, lifeless and unanimated in this painful rejection.

“That is not what I said,” Sirius said quickly, sounding agitated now. “Harry, I do, and God knows I wish we could be there together, but I’d rather us be apart than have you here where it isn’t safe. Do you understand?”

Harry stared at the rock lamp on his nightstand and shook his head.

He didn’t understand.

“We’re a team.”

Harry never could have survived the last year without Sirius. He’d called Sirius almost every night on the enchanted mirrors since Sirius mailed him his dad‘s old one on the first day of summer after third year.

He was the one person Harry could talk to when the Dursleys made him miserable, when his classmates made him miserable, when life in general made him miserable. Harry called him the night his name came out of the goblet and Ron turned his back on him. He called him and they talked about the best options for tackling the dragon. Sirius told Harry about the prophecy. They laughed over Ron and Hermione’s antics at the ball. When Harry called him in a panic, explaining he couldn’t swim, Sirius was the one to mail him gillyweed. And when Harry told him about the maze, Sirius let Professor Lupin talk to Harry every night and discuss different spells he should learn for the task. Sirius even stayed in the Hospital Wing with Harry after the last task, telling Dumbledore that Harry needed him more than Dumbledore did and that the job he had for him would still be there when Harry was released.

Sirius was the first and only person to give a damn about Harry. He was the first and only person to put Harry above almost anything else. No matter when Harry called, Sirius answered. And now he didn’t want him.

Which was pretty par for the fucking course.

“And we’ll always be a team,” Sirius assured him, lying through his teeth. “We can talk every day, Harry, I’m not going anywhere. This is good, now Albus can’t drag you back here. You’re free, kiddo, free to have a whole life now without worrying about wars or your crazy godfather.”

Harry kept his eyes on his lamp, his hands buried in Joey’s fur, and his jaw clenched tightly to keep from crying any more.

“You wanted me to come back though, right? And- and if I said I wanted to come stay with you, you’d find a way we can do that, right? So we still can, right?”

Sirius hesitated and that was as much of an answer as Harry needed.

“This was always the plan,” Harry whispered, mostly to himself, as he realized Sirius’ game. “You sent me here knowing I’d be stuck here.”

“Not stuck, Harry, but… but do I want you to have a good life? Yes! Of course! I want you to have a parent who loves you and can protect you! I want you to be a part of a family and live a normal life! I want you to have all the things I can’t give you!”

“Well, congrats,” Harry snapped, hurt and betrayal icing his voice over. “I thought you wanted it to be us, but I can see now that it won’t be. I guess I won’t bother you again since you decided to just get rid of me. Have a great fucking life, Sirius.”

Harry hung up and flung the phone as far from himself as he could before he buried his face in his knees and screamed until his throat felt like it tore.

He should be more surprised.

He wasn’t.

Someone knocked, but Harry yelled at them too.

“Piss off!”

And, once he was certain that he’d probably just cut himself off from both his ‘godfather’ and ‘father’, just as he wanted, Harry relocated Joey to his bed so he could hold him tightly and replay Sirius’ words over and over until he cried himself to sleep and Sirius’ words melted into a collage with everyone else who didn’t want Harry.

 

‘Kill the spare!’

‘Not Harry!’

‘I don’t want you to come back, I want you to stay there!’

‘Avada Kedavra!’

 

When Harry woke up, his heart pounding and scar aching from the green light that rushed at him in his nightmares, he wished, not for the first time, that he had been the spare in the cemetery that night.

Chapter Text

Friday, June 17

“Is he still not talking to you?”

Tony sat at one of the barstools with his elbow on his knees and his chin on his hand. “He told me to go fuck myself yesterday, does that count?”

Pepper grimaced and squeezed Tony’s shoulder gently from her seat beside him. “Do you want me to try?”

Tony sighed and rolled his neck. “No. Not until I leave, anyway. It’s me he hates, mostly, I think he might hate Natasha too, thankfully. Just… try and get the kid to eat. I think he’s fasting in protest.”

“Have you not fed him since Wednesday?” Pepper asked, sounding just disapproving enough to be really annoying.

“I tried shoving food down his throat, obviously, but for some reason the kid didn’t like it,” Tony rolled his eyes. “I’ve been leaving food by his door, he eats a little when he takes the dog outside.”

“Oh, thank god for that,” Pepper laughed lightly. “I thought maybe he was letting poor little Asshole potty in his bedroom.”

“It’s ‘Arsehole’, you really have to emphasize the British accent,” Tony corrected her. He checked his watch and kneaded his forehead for a moment. “I have to go.”

Tony got up, feeling his actual age (not the one he claimed), and checked the text from Sirius Black again.

17 June, 2p, Godric’s Hallow cemetery. Wear sunglasses. Try to not be seen. Is H. okay?

He had gotten the text Wednesday night, less than an hour after he broke his amazing news to his actual, legal, biological, son. Or, contrarily, Tony got the text less than an hour after hearing Harry scream like his chest had been cracked open and promptly told Tony to ‘piss off’.

So, yeah, parenthood was going excellent so far.

“Are you taking anyone with you? Happy or Clint?” Pepper asked hesitantly when Tony pulled a jacket on and snagged his favorite sunglasses off the kitchen counter.

“Nope. When you go confront terrorists who have an active warrant, it’s usually best to go alone,” Tony winked before he slid his sunglasses on his face. “Keep my kid alive, I’m going to try and bring him back a souvenir.”

Some kids wanted t-shirts or snowglobes, of course Tony’s son had to be special and want a terrorist.

“Good luck, try not to die,” Pepper called to his back as Tony strode from the room. “Tony, for the love of god, be careful!”

Tony grinned over his shoulder, “I am always careful.”

He wasn’t, but this wasn’t the time to start.

And…

 

Tony read over the messages between Sirius Black and Harry during the flight…

He didn’t actually think Sirius Black was going to try and hurt him. Call him an optimist, but the guy seemed to mostly care about Harry.

I won’t apologize. This is what’s best.

Harry, don’t ignore me, please.

Just tell me you’re okay.

Stay away from ledges or I’ll call your dad and have him put you in a bubble.

I love you.

Hedwig misses you. I miss you.

So apparently Sirius Black could communicate in more than just emojis and apparently Harry was as angry with him as he was Tony, since he didn’t respond even once. Which was nice, when someone desperately hated you, it was always better to have a partner to share that hatred with, really lightens the load.

 

Tony caught a cab from the private airport to ‘Godric’s Hollow’. He tried to think about what he would say to Sirius when he saw him, then he tried to not plan it out since his most brilliant ideas were usually done on a whim.

When the cab dropped him off in a quaint little town, Tony had his sunglasses on and the hood of his jacket pulled up. There was a tiny little sign, plain wood with lettering burnt into it, that pointed toward ‘Churchyard’, so Tony trekked off to find the terrorist his kid was so fond of.

He passed through a simple metal gate and entered the cemetery that Sirius guided him to. He walked slowly, his hands in his pockets and his eyes alert. Personally, Tony hated cemeteries. They were gloomy, depressing, and reminded him of his parents’ funerals. He bypassed an old war memorial, set in the center of the graveyard, and called out to the empty field, growing impatient.

“Come out, come out, wherever you are.”

“You bloody suck at being inconspicuous, don’t you, mate?”

Tony turned and saw someone with their hip propped against a gleaming white headstone. They had their back to Tony, but there could only be one person there speaking with him.

“I’m excellent at being inconspicuous. In fact, when I’m a wanted terrorist, I’m really quiet and sneaky,” Tony said casually as he walked toward the tall thin man.

The man turned, and, even despite the gauntness of his cheeks, the length of his hair, and the lines of time, that smirk was the same one he wore back when Tony met him.

“You’re still a cheeky bastard, aren’t you?” Sirius asked. He backed up some, turning his attention to the engraving on the headstone.

“I do my best,” Tony said modestly. He stepped up beside Sirius and glanced at the headstone. “Oh. This is where they were buried?”

On the white tombstone, engraved in an elegant font, it stated:

In Loving Memory:
James Potter & Lily Potter

Beneath their dates of birth and death, an odd little inscription:

The Last Enemy That Shall Be Destroyed is Death

“Yeah, almost fourteen years ago now,” Sirius said. His voice was hoarse, but Tony had no way of knowing if it was emotions or just a general hoarseness. Or, he didn’t, until Sirius cleared his throat and turned to him, all business now. “How’s the kid whose name you shouldn’t say out loud?”

Tony narrowed his eyes and catalogued that little comment carefully to think over later. “Great question, easy answer: why are you in contact with my son, why shouldn’t I turn you in to the police right now, and, oh yeah, why does your mourning style include bombs?”

Sirius glanced around the cemetery and then visibly relaxed once he realized the wind was the only thing present aside from the two of them. “Your son is my godson,” he said slowly.

“Figured that out for myself, funnily enough,” Tony said airily. “So you broke out of prison and what? Just thought ‘oh I should see what my godson is up to?’”

“Something like that,” Sirius gave him a half-assed grin, more mocking than genuine. “And now I’m wondering how my godson is?”

“My son is great, really, all formally declared as my kid, refusing to come out of his room. Super sweet really,” said Tony. “There’s a little snag with him hating me, but all teenagers hate the parent they didn’t know and didn’t want, so I figure we’ll work through it.”

Sirius scoffed and raised a brow, somehow looking like a condescending dick despite the fact that he was the wanted murderer. “He’s a… well, he’s himself. He’s never had a parent make decisions for him before, and he’s had- well… a rough go of it.”

“You don’t say,” Tony deadpanned. “Here I thought he had a charming life, outside of the whole dead parents, shit relatives, murderous godfather, and the pedophile he befriended.”

“So you found the Dursleys?” Sirius’ grey eyes were suddenly crystal clear and sharp. “Are they dead?”

“You ask a lot of questions,” Tony said. “My turn now and I’d like to start with, what the fuck is going on here?”

Sirius laughed, his face looking younger as he did. “Long story short? I was framed. But I don’t care about that, I care about my godson. He’s not talking to me anymore.”

“Yeah? You add your name to his birth certificate and piss him off too?”

“No. I sent him to you.”

“Did you?” Tony asked with as much surprise as he could muster. “I could have sworn I saw a convicted child molester drop him off at the airport. Prison friend of yours?”

He wasn’t. Tony checked. There was no inmate in any of the jails or prisons that Ramsey had been in that even resembled Sirius Black.

“Don’t be bloody disgusting.” Sirius’ face twisted up in the same distaste Tony felt every time he thought of Ramsey. “That bloke just- er- he just gave H- your kid a ride to the airport. I don’t think they ever had contact before then.”

“Yeah? They seemed pretty chummy on the videos I watched.”

Sirius shifted and looked up to the grey sky for a long moment, clearly thinking something over.

“Has your kid talked much at all about his life?” Sirius finally asked, still contemplating the sky, as he obviously decided to dodge the damning question.

“He mentioned a few friends from ‘school’—”

Friends who, like Harry, had birth certificates and no real lives past eleven. The girl, Hermione Granger, had parents who were dentists in Essex, and she had more of a trail than Harry or Ronald Weasley, but not much. Hermione Granger went to Saint Catherine’s Primary, a private school for ‘bright and gifted young ladies,’ until the fall after she turned eleven.

Where Hermione Granger essentially disappeared the same as Harry, the same as Ron.

And it had been a pain in the ass to find what little he could about Ronald Weasley too. He wasn’t even entirely certain that he was the right ‘Ron’ except he was another kid born in the United Kingdom, a few months older than Harry, who was born and lived entirely off the grid alongside his many siblings and parents. No rental leases, no deeds in their name, not so much as a shopping receipt from their local grocery store. There had also been almost daily phone calls to the Granger’s phone line last summer from a phone booth in the same town as Ronald Weasley’s birth certificate listed.

Other than that? The kids were all ghosts. Dead men had more paper trails than most of the people in Harry’s life.

“—and that’s it,” Tony told Sirius. “Why don’t you tell me what you know?”

Sirius tilted his head down to face Tony and looked amused, “Yeah? You think the kid’ll be happy if I tell you things about him? That’s how you want to win his trust?”

“Sure would be easier to win a game if I understood the damn rules,” Tony said. He worked to keep his voice even, but Sirius stood there, knowing shit about Tony’s son, and clearly wasn’t going to tell him a damn thing. “You know, I came here to bring you back, help get you a whole new identity in America, give my kid the adult he clearly prefers in his life, an uncle or whatever you want to be, but I can’t do a damn thing if I DON’T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!”

“Shut the hell up,” Sirius hissed. His eyes flicked to a hill covered in headstones where a bird cawed and shot away at Tony’s fury filled rant. “Bloody hell, mate. I’d rather not get caught having this little chat.”

“I’m starting to wonder why I don’t just turn you in,” Tony spat.

Sirius kept his composure a hell of a lot better than Tony was. “Aside from the whole ‘not guilty’ bit, my godson will forgive me eventually, when he realizes I was right, and I’m not blackmailing you, because I do want him to be happy with you, but I promise he won’t be if you try and turn me in.”

Tony let out a heaving breath and tried to calm down the frustration he’d been boiling in practically since the minute his son appeared in his office.

“Every criminal says they’re innocent,” Tony pointed out, his shoulders relaxing as he could see that Sirius truly did seem to want Harry to be happy. If they had that single mutual goal, then perhaps they could figure out the rest. “What makes you special?”

“Aside from my charm, good looks, and sunny personality? The fact I didn’t do it,” Sirius snorted. “Listen, that’s a problem for me to solve. I’ve got to catch a rat and then maybe I’ll get my name cleared and I can eventually come see the kid, eh?”

“Or I help you and we can have this silly conviction all bundled up and disappeared in time to make it to my place tonight for dinner. Do you like Italian? There’s a great restaurant near my place.”

Sirius stilled, “What?”

“I’m speaking English, right? I have a bad habit of slipping into French on occasion.”

“Parlez la langue que vous préférez,” Sirius drawled in perfect French with a smirk.

Tony let out a startled laugh and relaxed further. “You must have spent a lot of time with the kid, he’s a smartass too.”

Sirius was the one who laughed then and his shoulders were loose and he stuffed his hands in his leather jacket pockets. “Nah, I’m an arse, he’s just… defensive.”

“Yeah, he’s great, really.” Tony huffed and moved his hands to his pockets as well. “What do you say then? Wanna become the Scooby-Doo gang? I can be the hot one and you can be the dog, we can solve the mystery of why someone framed you and take you to see the kid? I’ll warn you now, he’s got a little attack dog, but I think with a few hot meals you could take him.”

The wistful look on Sirius’ face was plain as day, so his refusal of Tony’s totally altruistic offer made no logical sense.

“Maybe I’m not making myself clear.” Tony pulled a hand out and offered it to Sirius, “Hi, Tony Stark, give me thirty seconds and a decent internet connection and I can have your entire life erased and rebuilt. Prison sentence? What prison sentence?”

Sirius shook his head and kept his hands firmly in his pockets. “For your government, maybe, but it’s more complicated than that.”

“Then explain it,” Tony said through grit teeth. Was this where Harry picked up his complete reticence from? If so, Tony didn’t exactly appreciate it. He appreciated it even less when Sirius cryptically said, “Ask the kid.”

“What does he know about something you may or may not have done fourteen years ago?” Tony demanded.

Sirius smiled softly, “Everything. He knows everything. You just need to get him to tell you. As soon as he tells you the big bit, I’ll fill in the blanks.”

“With cryptic little emojis?”

Sirius threw his head back then and laughed as loudly and hard as he ever had. “Oh, god, that’s really bothering you, isn’t it? Mate, I’m just screwing with my godson. He doesn’t want to even ask you to buy him bloody toothpaste, so I pretend I can’t understand him when he asks for money.”

“You’re refusing to send Harry mon—”

Crack!

“God damnit,” Sirius interrupted Tony with a snarl after a nearby tree branch broke. “Go, get the fuck out, now.” He pushed Tony away, causing him to stumble from the force on his chest. “I have to go. I’ll contact you, just go.”

“What the f—”

Sirius darted away, ducking around graves and hiding behind trees.Tony grabbed a laser, a replica of the one he gave Harry, and tried to follow him, but he almost immediately lost track of Sirius after the surprisingly quick man darted behind a large oak tree.

“What the fuck just happened?” Tony looked around the empty cemetery blankly. He pulled his phone from his pocket, rolled his eyes that the little hick town had less than stellar signal, and the frowned at the new message he had:

H’s had a hard time. Be patient with him.

Tony shot a quick text to Pepper, checking on Harry, then sent a response to Sirius.

You care a lot about a kid you won’t come see.

He got a baseball and a watermelon in reply.

It was probably a good thing that Sirius seemed to be Harry’s all-time favorite person, because he was also a dick and gave Tony a headache.

 

Tony made it back to the tower in record time that night, most of the flight spent in silent contemplation on the building mystery of his son’s life and his relationships.

“I need an entire bottle of aspirin and a massage with a happy ending,” Tony groaned as he saw Pepper was the only occupant in the place after he walked in. He flung himself across the couch and covered his face with his arm, “Where’s Harry?”

“He took the dog for a walk.”

“You are truly a goddess,” Tony said reverently. “How’d you convince him to do that?”

“Guilt,” Pepper said without an ounce of shame. “The same way I get you to do things when you’re stuck in one of your moods.”

Tony moved his arm so he could lift his head and grin at the smug, irritating, woman sitting in his favorite recliner. “I do not have mood swings, I’m a delight, Pep,” he said with a pouty lip that did nothing but cause Pepper to roll her eyes.

“You do,” she told him, “but his are worse. He’s- he’s really upset. He thinks ‘his friend’,” Pepper even did the air quotes with her fingers, “doesn’t want him in his life. I think he feels abandoned.”

Tony flung his arm back over his face in defeat. “Well I couldn’t get ‘the friend’ to come back with me.”

Tony had sent him a dozen texts between Godric’s Hollow and the airport, all explaining that he could have Sirius at his place that same day to see Harry. And what did the prick send back? Strings of emojis until Tony got pissed and muted his messages.

He wasn’t an idiot. He could tell that Sirius cared about Harry, hell, loved him even, but he couldn’t understand why he wouldn’t come back with Tony. The best theory he had was that Sirius didn’t trust Tony enough to not turn him in, despite eight of Tony’s texts saying he wouldn’t (one of them said he would, but it had been an empty threat, really).

“What do I do, Pep?” Tony groaned. “He can’t just spend the next four years miserable.”

“You could start by letting him go to a party with his friend tomorrow?”

Tony sat up instantly, “A party? With what friend? Where? How?”

“Calm down,” Pepper laughed. “His friend from the animal shelter called him earlier. He didn’t answer, then I teased him until he called him back, and he got invited to a party at one of Peter’s friends’ houses.”

“What friend?”

“I don’t—”

“Jarvis! Check all social media for students that attend the same school as Peter Parker, find out who’s having a party this weekend.”

“Very good, sir. Results are being sent. Miss Potts, young Mister Stark is back in the building.”

“Thank you, Jarvis,” Pepper said warmly. She raised a brow when Tony gave her a look, “What? If he was gone for more than fifteen minutes then I was going to track his jacket and find him.”

“His jacket??”

Pepper gave Tony a sly smile- a damn sexy look on her face -and coyly lowered her eyes. “I might have slipped one of those trackers you stick on everything in his jacket earlier. I figured if he ran, he’d ditch the phone, but he loves that jacket.”

Tony let out a delighted laugh and appreciated Pepper’s craftiness much more when it was aimed at Harry and not himself. “Aw, Pepper, look at you, playing overprotective stepmom before we’ve even had our first kiss. Awfully bold of you,” he winked.

Pepper rolled her eyes, “You’re the one running social media analysis over a party with teenagers.”

“That’s because I, unlike a certain little geek girl, have actually been to a party as a teenager and I need to know if I should send Clint as backup or not,” Tony pointed out, entirely logically.

Pepper looked poised to argue, as she always was, but the elevator dinged and Harry joined them after a moment.

“Hey, kid,” Tony gave him a hopeful smile. “How was your day?”

Harry breezed right past him with the dog squirming in his arms, “Brilliant.”

Tony didn’t plan on blurting out his activity for the day, but he just said something to keep Harry from storming in his room again.

“I met an old buddy of mine today, Sirius Black, he said to tell you hi.”

Pepper muttered something that distinctly sounded like ‘you idiot’ before swiftly getting up and leaving the apartment.

Harry froze with a hand outstretched for his doorknob. He slowly turned and fixed those piercing eyes of his on Tony, “What?”

“Yeah, we had a nice chat. I think I’m going to clear his name, help him not be a whole ‘escaped convict’ anymore. You want in? We’re calling ourselves the Scooby-Doo gang, I’m the hot one, he’s the dog, but you could be Velma if you want?”

Harry didn’t say anything for at least two minutes, he just stood there, his dog squirming and licking his face, while he stared at Tony in shock. Finally, he swallowed, licked his lips, tightened his hold on the dog, and asked, “Why?”

Tony could have made a joke, but since it was the most conversation he had with the kid since he broke the news that Russia wasn’t happening on Wednesday, he figured it wasn’t the time.

“You like him, there’s plenty of floors with empty living spaces here, and…” Tony cursed his father mentally as he struggled through a heavy wave of discomfort to say what needed to be said. “And I care about your happiness,” he said in a rush, pushing the words out and mentally patting himself on the back for it. “So if Sirius Black being here makes you happy, and he swears not to blow my building up, then I’m going to do what I can to make it happen.”

He wasn’t going to tell the kid about Sirius’ outright refusal to come. He wasn’t an idiot, despite what Pepper may believe. There was no way that Harry wouldn’t take that news pretty damn badly.

Harry blinked at him a few times, then nodded slowly. “Do you, er, d’you have any extra toothpaste? I’m out.”

Unexpected question, but not a bad one either.

“Sure, kid, I’ll get it.”

Tony worked harder than he ever had to not actual skip as he went to his bathroom, snagged an extra tube of toothpaste and took it to his son. “Ta da, extra fresh breath in case you play spin the bottle tomorrow.”

Harry accepted the toothpaste, but his forehead crinkled at Tony’s comment. “What’s spin the bottle?”

Tony stopped and stared at him. He knew the kid was sheltered, never even played video games, but…

“Have you ever been to a party before?”

Harry frowned, his default expression. “Did Pepper tell you about that? I, er… I told her I’m probably not going. She’s just bloody annoying.”

And since Harry sounded almost as fond of Pepper as Tony was, he figured that Pepper must just be a magnet for Stark’s.

“You should go,” Tony said firmly. He checked his inbox while he got the toothpaste and saw that Jarvis found one classmate of Peter Parker’s, Gwendolyne Stacy, was holding a party at her parents home in SoHo. Her family checked out alright, her dad was a captain for the New York police department, mom stayed at home with the four kids. Tony saw they had a room booked in Maine for the weekend and since the entire family didn’t have so much as a parking ticket, he figured it would be a chance for Harry to start making ties in New York.

Harry ducked his head and shuffled his foot. “You- you don’t want me to stay here? Stay in my room… or… or something?”

“Nope.” Tony kept his tone casual and friendly. He wasn’t going to punish the kid for being a kid. “Harry, we’re going to fight. I’m new to this whole parenting business, I’m going to fuck it up and you’re going to react to my fuck ups. Vice versa, probably. I figure if you aren’t hiding the coffee from me or letting Arsehole shit in my bed, then no harm, no foul. Go have fun tomorrow. I’ll still be here to glare at when you get back.”

Harry picked his head up and gave him a curious look. “I told you to go fuck yourself and you’re going to clear Sirius’ name, let him move in, and let me go to a party?”

“I’m going to try and get your godfather here,” Tony stressed. “It might be more helpful if he knew you didn’t hate him,” he added as a single bit of goodwill for the guy who sent him his son.

Tony then sighed dramatically and sat backwards on the armrest of the couch. “And, you’re right. Since I have certainly never been told to go fuck myself before, I should do some sort of parent thing now, right? How about this… for the obscene crime of being a teenager, you are hereby sentenced to eating meals with me again.”

It wasn’t a real smile, more of a twitch of Harry’s upper lip, but the kid nodded all the same.

“If I get a barrister, can I have my sentence reduced?”

“Nope. The judge is a real prick.”

Harry huffed, a sound suspiciously close to a laugh, and turned to his door once more. “Alright then, I’ll, er… just see you in the morning.”

“Sleep tight, don’t let the fleas bite!”

Tony fell backward on the couch, his legs dangling over the armrest, and smiled smugly when Harry’s door closed softly.

Sure, he had a mysterious bombing to investigate, he had to find a way to drag Sirius Black to New York, preferably by his hair, his kid had a whole life full of secrets he wasn’t ready to share yet, and he had to convince Clint or Natasha to go spy on a high school party, but…

But Tony thought that it was still worth it. If he were Sirius Black, he would have broken out of prison for the kid too.

Or, more accurately, Tony would have framed someone else if he’d been the bomber, had them sentenced on his behalf, and never stepped foot in a prison. But Sirius Black just wasn’t as smart as Tony was, apparently.

Chapter Text

Saturday, June 18

“Alright, kid, if someone offers you alcohol, what do you do?”

“Don’t drink it?”

“Wrong. Don’t drink enough to puke or pass out, but a couple drinks is fine.”

“Er… right.”

“What about if they offer you drugs?”

“Leave?”

“Not unless you don’t want to try them. If you do, shoot me a text first so I can check and make sure you don’t have a bad reaction or a shit trip, but a little shitty weed probably won’t kill you.”

“You’re serious?”

“No, that’s your godfather. Got your phone?”

“Yes.”

“Laser?”

“Yes.”

“Condoms?”

“Bloody hell.” Harry grabbed the handle of the car door and scowled at Tony. He hesitated before opening it, “You don’t really want me to drink and do drugs and—” Harry’s face burnt bright red, “— do that, do you?”

“Nah,” Tony grinned. “I don’t care if you do, just to be clear, but be smart about it, alright?”

Harry had no intention of doing any of those things, so his agreement was probably a moot point.

To be fair, Harry also had no intention of going to the party in the first place. He’d been surprised when Peter even invited him, but Peter begged, telling Harry it would somehow be more fun if he’d go, so Harry told him he’d ask. And, as he’d done nothing but piss Tony off since Tony ruined Harry’s chances of helping Sirius get free, Harry didn’t plan on asking because he didn’t expect to be let out of their place for the rest of summer.

Then, not only was Tony not even going to take a swing at Harry or lock him inside his room for the next month, the mad man went and flew to England and chatted with Sirius and offered to help him clear his name.

It was embarrassing, having Tony do all that when Harry had been a prick, it was worse when Harry saw that Tony wasn’t just a good person when he was with his team of literal superheroes, he was a good person in other ways too.

And he was stuck with Harry.

“Do I just… walk back after?” Harry asked slowly, unsure if he could even find his way back on foot. He could probably ride a bus, but he hadn’t seen any stops in the posh neighborhood Peter’s friend Gwen lived in.

“What? No, kid, just call me if you need a ride,” Tony said, sounding surprised by Harry’s question. “Don’t ride with anyone you don’t trust, and don’t ride with anyone that’s been drinking, even if ‘it was only one drink’, alright? I’ll be awake anyway, I’ve got an idea on how to reconfigure the StarkCar engine where it uses less fuel and could even improve the horsepower.”

“Er… right.” Harry had no idea what that last bit meant. “I’ll just… see you later then.”

 

As soon as Harry got out of the car, he kind of wished he’d stayed in it.

 

He looked up at the huge house, bit of a mansion really, that Peter’s friend lived in and tried to figure out how he was meant to find the one person he knew in the crowds of what looked like hundreds of teenagers all laughing and spilling from the front porch all over the lawn. The music inside the house was so loud that Harry could hear it from the sidewalk where he stood.

Harry nervously checked his phone as he slowly made his way toward the front door. He sent Peter a text, simply saying he was there, and then tripped over someone before he even got to the door. Harry stumbled and caught himself on the rail for the porch. He would have apologized, had the words on the tip of his tongue, but felt his neck heat up at the loud laughter behind him.

“What the hell?” Harry snapped. He turned and glared at the bloke who seemed to be the one laughing the most. He was a few inches taller than Harry, muscular in a sort of beater type of build, and had a shaved head that reminded Harry of Gregory Goyle. “Something funny?” Harry added when the bloke and his circle of friends kept snickering at him.

“Walk much?” the one that looked a bit like Goyle laughed.

Harry wasn’t going to be bullied by some prat who reminded him of the worst student in Hogwarts. He had his pride, sort of.

“Not at all,” Harry drawled, gaining the interest of the nearby teens. “I do most of my transport in the air, obviously.”

All in all, not one of Harry’s better lines, but he was rather embarrassed.

“Yeah?” The bloke looked Harry over while his idiot friends exchanged gleeful looks. The bloke took a step toward Harry and scoffed, “You should walk more often, might help you grow.”

“You should read a book more often, might expand your understanding of growth in the human body.”

The bloke looked puzzled for a moment, then furious. “You saying I’m stupid?”

Harry stood his ground as he took another step towards him. Sure, he’d lose a fight against him, but he wasn’t going to look like a prat and run off either.

“Excellent,” Harry deadpanned. “You’ve interpreted my incredibly subtle insult, five points to team dunderhead.”

Harry silently thanked Professor Snape for teaching him a dozen different ways to call someone a moron. If Harry learned nothing else in that classroom, he learned how to make someone feel like an absolute idiot.

And, just as Harry never appreciated the insults, neither did this bloke it seemed.

The bloke actually growled and tightened his fists as his side and Harry braced himself for the coming blow when—

“Oh. My. God. Are you British?!”

Harry turned just enough to glance at whoever was talking and saw a girl with black braids and a blue dress on staring at him with probably half a dozen other girls in similar dresses of different colors beside her.

Since it seemed like the girl’s question paused the prat in his tracks, Harry figured it wouldn’t hurt to answer her.

“Yeah?”

The squeals those girls made did actually hurt his ears.

The girl with the braids reached out and snagged Harry by his jacket, yanking him over to her.

“Ignore Flash,” she said sweetly, “he’s a total dick.”

One of the girls in a pink dress began batting her lashes at him, “What’s your name?”

“Harry.”

“Ooh, where are you from?”

Before he could even answer, they were all asking questions.

“He’s from England, duh, stupid. Where do you go to school? How old are you?”

“Are you friends with Gwen? Ugh, trust her to have a cute British friend!”

“How do I earn five points, Harry?”

“Oh my God! Are you and Gwen like together?”

Harry found himself suddenly surrounded by teenage girls and entirely bemused by their giggles. They seemed less interested in hearing his answers than they were simply asking him a million of them at rapid fire speeds. Just as Harry was wishing he had his Invisibility Cloak, he heard a familiar voice.

“Hey! Harry!”

The girls parted a little to make way for Peter to slide through.

“Thank god,” Harry muttered. He’d honestly rather have gotten into a fight with the bloke they called Flash than deal with giggling girls.

Peter squished through and shook his head playfully at the girl with braids. “Shani, you can’t steal my friend.”

The girl smiled at Harry and winked. “I definitely could.”

“Harry, you meet these guys?”

Harry shook his head and Peter listed off names too quickly for him to ever have a hope of remembering them.

“Come on, you want a drink?” Peter asked him. He threw his arm over Harry’s shoulders and guided him inside, through the group of giggling and whispering girls.

“Mate, thank you,” Harry sighed. “I went from getting into a fight into getting mobbed.”

Peter glanced over at him and grinned, “Which was worse?”

“The girls,” Harry said drily, “there were too many to fight.”

Peter laughed, the colorful lights flashing in the large, posh, and packed living room they entered shooting odd sparkles on his teeth.

“I heard someone say there was a ‘cute British guy’ outside and figured they meant you,” Peter yelled over the sound of the music thrumming through the house. “I guess nobody appreciated the accent where you lived before?”

“I don’t have a bloody accent,” Harry yelled back. They turned and entered a kitchen where Peter barely even slowed before he grabbed two glass bottles of coke and veered off toward a back door. “You lot are the ones with the accents,” Harry said in a more normal tone once they stepped out back and the music was more tolerable background noise.

He looked around and saw there were a lot less people standing around back there as well. There were probably a dozen or so people sitting around a giant swimming pool and another dozen inside the pool, splashing and laughing.

“Whatever you say, ‘mate’,” Peter laughed. “Here,” he handed Harry one of the drinks, “where’s Joey at tonight?”

“He’s actually attacking Flash for me,” Harry said. “I liked his odds.”

Peter laughed again. “Yeah, Flash is an asshole, man. Oh, hey, there’s Gwen. Gwen! Come meet Harry!”

A blonde girl in the pool turned and smiled at Peter and Harry felt a twist of something in his stomach.

“She’s pretty,” he said lightly as the girl climbed out of the pool, showcasing a bright green two piece swimsuit. She shook her hair out and grabbed a nearby towel, wrapping it around her waist and making her way toward them.

“Who? Gwen?” Peter looked at Harry for a moment before shrugging. “I guess so.”

Gwen bounced over to them and smiled brightly at Harry, further proving that she was actually quite pretty. She stuck her hand out at him, “You must be Harry! I’ve heard allll about you!”

Harry accepted her hand, shooting Peter a curious look that the other boy shrugged at.

“I told her you adopted Joey and you’re BFF’s with Captain America,” Peter explained.

“And that you’re British, and soo funny, and—”

“Alright, alright, Jesus, Gwen,” Peter stuck his hand over her mouth. “Anyone ever tell you that you talk too much?”

“Every teacher I’ve ever had,” Gwen grinned after Peter released her. “Come sit, guys! Harry, tell me everything about yourself!”

“Gwen thinks she’s a reporter,” Peter muttered to Harry as they rearranged some of the white wicker chairs into a little grouping for them to sit.

“I can hear youuu,” Gwen sang. She sat and primly crossed her legs before turning to Harry. “And since Peter here thinks he’s a photographer, we make a great pair.”

Harry figured they did. They were both friendly, good-looking, and probably had loads in common. He made a noncommittal hum and then Gwen jumped in with her questions.

“Peter said you’re not staying long?” she asked. “Are you going back to England soon?”

“Er… no,” Harry said slowly. He picked at a hole in his jeans, something Tony said was ‘fashionable’ when he bought them, and felt his mood dip. “I’m staying here, I guess.”

“Really?” Harry glanced up and Gwen was positively beaming, which was a bit odd since she didn’t even really know him. “Yay! Are you going to Midtown with us in the fall?”

“It’s our school,” Peter explained again when Harry must have looked confused. “Midtown High School.”

“Oh. Maybe,” Harry said uncertainly. “I’ve got no idea, actually.”

He hadn’t planned on being in New York long. Certainly not forever. He still needed to learn magic, he thought… and he’d need a wand… and to figure out what school he’d be going to.

“Where did you go to school before?” Gwen asked.

“It was a boarding school, very private, very boring,” Harry smirked. Maybe Hogwarts was boring, if you weren’t Harry Potter. Harry certainly never got an opportunity to be bored though.

“Oh, no,” Peter groaned dramatically before taking a swig of his drink and pushing his brown hair off his forehead. “You’re a prep kid!”

“No way! He’s a total jock!” Gwen laughed. “Harry, what totally stereotypical teenage American cliché do you identify with the most?”

“All of them,” Harry said seriously. He took a drink then glanced between the two of them, “What’s that mean, anyway?”

“It’s like this,” Peter scooted his chair closer to Harry, “see those girls swimming?”

Harry glanced at a group of giggling girls in pink swimsuits who were doing a lot more splashing than swimming and nodded.

“Prep kids,” Gwen told him with a glimmer of amusement in her eyes. “And you met our dear friend Flash?”

“We’re well acquainted,” Harry said.

“He’s a jock,” Peter said. “Those kids with the green and blue hair over there,” he pointed to a group of kids that looked like they were smoking, “art kids.”

“So you’re a prep kid then?” Harry asked the two of them.

“How dare you, sir?” Peter clutched his chest. “I am a nerd!”

Harry looked over his shaggy hair, his lopsided smile, his blue jeans, red trainers, and black tshirt. If Peter was a nerd, then he was a much better looking one than Hermione had ever been.

“And I’m a chameleon,” Gwen sniffed haughtily with a toss of her blonde hair. “I fit in everywhere.”

That one Harry believed.

“Well I was a Gryffindor at my last school, but being an art kid looks more fun,” Harry said. “Do I just dye my hair blue or are there tryouts?”

“Hey! Brittany! Harry wants to join your cliché!” Gwen abruptly yelled across the yard, drawing attention to their group.

“Cool,” ‘Brittany’, the girl with the green streaked hair said in a lazy drawl. She looked Harry over and smiled, “You’re in.”

“Brilliant, I’ll buy the hair dye tomorrow,” Harry told her.

“What?”

Gwen let out a loud peal of laughter and looked approvingly at Harry. “You’re going to fit right in,” she said. “Now tell me what a Gryffindor is?”

Harry talked a little about Hogwarts, mostly just explaining the different houses and the points system. He left out the obvious bits about magic and just made it sound like they took a test to decide which house they got. He probably wouldn’t have said as much, but if he was going to be stuck in New York, he figured Peter and Gwen would be decent enough friends to have.

“So there’s smart kids, nice kids, brave kids, and sneaky kids?” Peter asked him. He had his knees drawn up to his chest, his chin resting on them, and had been giving Harry his complete attention while Harry talked. “That’s a weird way to decide where people sleep.”

Harry laughed at that. “It’s also for teams and the points thing means whichever house has the most points at the end win a trophy. It’s…” Harry had mixed feelings about his time at Hogwarts, but it had been his first home where he met his first friends. “It makes more sense if you’re there,” he said.

“And what did you say it was called?” Gwen asked. Her tone was innocent enough, but there was a keen look on her face and, honestly, Harry didn’t trust anyone who wanted to be a reporter.

“I didn’t,” he said. “Do all of you go to Midtown then?”

“Evasive, I like it,” Gwen winked. “Most of us do, but when I sent out invites I said to bring a friend, so there’s probably some kids from the local high school too. Oh! Do you live near here? Maybe you’ll go to their school?”

“Er… I guess I live in Manhattan,” Harry said with an uncomfortable shrug of his shoulders.

“You guess?”

“Well I wasn’t planning on staying, you see, then I was kidnapped and adopted against my will and now I’m stuck.”

“You were kidnapped?” Peter asked. “By who?”

“My biological father.”

“How can your biological father kidnap you?” Gwen asked him.

“With his lawyers, I assume.”

Peter grinned at Harry’s dry tone. “Is Captain America your kidnapper? Because I’ll totally fight him. I’d lose, no doubt, but man, what a way to go.”

“Mm… wrong Avenger,” Harry said slowly. Tony hadn’t told him he couldn’t say they were related. He’d even told Harry that he could bring people over if he wanted… and it wasn’t as if his house was a mystery seeing as people stood in front of the tower for photos. “Think younger, more metal limbs, and much more annoying.”

“Shut up!” Gwen gasped and covered her mouth with her own hand. “Oh my god, how did I not see it? I am a terrible reporter! You look just like him!”

“Holy shit,” Peter looked hard at Harry and grinned. “You totally do.”

“I like to think I’m better looking,” Harry said sarcastically as he averted his eyes from the close scrutiny of the two of them.

“Oh you definitely are.”

Harry glanced away from the pool to Peter and felt his face get hot at Peter’s crooked grin and Gwen’s quiet giggles. He didn’t actually feel like being made fun of.

“There’s a lot less drugs and alcohol here than Tony made it sound like,” Harry said, trying to change the subject very subtly. “He gave me a whole speech about it the whole drive here.”

“Let me guess, hugs not drugs?” Peter grinned.

“He told me to try them,” Harry said flippantly with a roll of his eyes. “He’s mad.”

“You know, I actually expected that,” Peter said thoughtfully. He stretched his legs out and grinned, causing some organ near Harry’s heart to do an odd flip in his chest. “He seems like a laid back dude.”

“He… is,” Harry agreed. “What about you lot? Gwen, your parents let you have parties here?”

“When they’re out of town and don’t know about it? Yes,” she said impishly. “My brothers are with my mom’s cousin and I’m officially old and responsible enough to stay home alone.”

“And she celebrated that sense of responsibility by throwing a party.” Peter held his fist out to Gwen and she bumped hers against his.

“And you brought Avenger Junior to make sure that everyone stays safe,” Gwen winked.

Harry cleared his throat and smiled politely. “Actually, I’m more of an Anti-Avenger—”

“The fun AA,” Peter grinned, quoting what Pepper told him at the shelter.

“Precisely,” Harry agreed. “So really I’m here to do the opposite of whatever they would.”

Gwen perked right up. “So if they would stay safe and make good decisions…?”

“Then danger and bad decisions is the agenda for tonight,” Harry nodded.

“Perfect!” Gwen jumped to her feet. “Nobody move! I’ll be back!”

“You’ve done it now,” Peter told him in a faux-chiding tone. He shook his finger at Harry and slumped back in his chair. “Gwen’s always wanted someone to make bad decisions with.”

“You don’t make bad decisions then?” Harry asked him. “Perfectly well-behaved, you are?”

“Me? Oh, yeah, I’m like the image of perfect.” Peter’s eyes glimmered and he held up his hand with the palm out, “I volunteer with animals, I get great grades, I’m good with my hands. Honestly, parents love me, Harry, I’m like a dream come true.”

“And you’re incredibly humble,” Harry added solemnly. “That’s the most important part.”

The back door flew open, increasing the volume of the music, and Gwen led out a whole group of people.

“I have the secret formula for danger and bad decisions!” Gwen held up two large glass bottles, one blue and one pink, to general cheers from the rest of the teens in the yard. “UV Blue and UV Lemonade!”

Everyone scrambled to clamber out of the pool and rearrange chairs so the cement patio between the pool and the house could be filled with people all sitting on the ground. One of the blue haired girls, Brittany’s friend it seemed like, ran in and grabbed a stack of red plastic cups that she began distributing.

A girl in a pink bikini crinkled her nose when Gwen filled her cup with the blue drink. “Do you have anything to mix it?” she asked.

Gwen laughed and shook her head. “Nope! Drink and make terrible choices that don’t involve breaking anything or my mom will kill me.”

Harry glanced at Peter, who sighed loudly as they moved from their chairs to the group with the others. “Is she always a bit terrifying?”

“Who? Gwen?” Peter accepted two cups and immediately handed one off to Harry. “Yeah, usually.”

“Wicked.” Harry grinned at the hyper blonde when she filled his cup with the pink liquid. He waited until she poured Peter a drink and bounced off to the next set of empty cups being held up to ask Peter the question he had been curious about, “Are you and her…?”

“What?” Peter stared at Harry for a moment before turning to look at where Gwen was laughing with a bloke with a mohawk. “Oh, no,” he laughed and scooted a little closer to Harry. “We’re just friends.”

That probably shouldn’t have affected Harry’s decision to like Gwen Stacy, but it did.

“I like her,” he said firmly.

 

“I hate her,” Harry groaned less than an hour later. He had drank the pink liquor at her insistence, as did everyone else, and while he enjoyed the burn in his chest and the way that all his problems seemed to disappear as he drank, he didn’t enjoy the way she kept dragging him into conversations and games.

Gwen had decided that since most of the kids outside were from different schools that they should ‘play a game and get to know each other’. Someone suggested they play ‘Two Truths and a Lie’, which was fine when everyone else took their turns and the rest of them shouted out which statement they made about themselves that was a lie.

It was kind of fun, actually, drinking and shouting at each other, laughing and pretending he was a normal bloke like the rest of them.

Gryffindor parties had never been so fun.

Harry even got Peter and Gwen to start ‘awarding points’ when a giggly girl recounted Harry’s brief disagreement with Flash.

“Twenty points to the jocks!” Peter yelled when no one had guessed that the bloke in shorts and a tank top was in his choir at church.

“Harry’s turn!” Gwen yelled. She grabbed Harry by the arm and pulled him to his slightly unsteady feet and pushed him to the front of the crowd. “Two truths and a lie, Stark!”

It was incredibly weird being called Stark, but it was much weirder to have people look at him and giggle and grin as if Harry were one of them.

Actually, that second bit was nice. None of them knew ‘Harry Potter’ the ‘Boy-Who-Lived’. They just assumed his last name was Stark (a change that Harry‘s new ID card confirmed and he was firmly denying) and they were still happy to let Harry hang out with them.

Of course, most of them seemed pissed, but they had liked him when he first arrived too, so he figured it still counted.

Harry considered the statements the others made. Coming up with a lie was easy, it was the truths he struggled with.

“Alright.” Harry took a drink of the actually disgusting blue liquor in his cup. “I stole a car before and wrecked it into a tree, I’m top of my class at my old school, and I once got bit by a snake and almost died.”

Everyone started buzzing as they whispered back and forth between glances and giggles when they looked at Harry.

Peter sat in the back of the group and smirked up at Harry, “You’ve definitely stolen a car!”

“Oh, yeah, he’s got ‘rebel without a cause’ written all over him,” Gwen nodded.

“Excuse you, I happen to have an excellent cause,” Harry drawled, causing a lot of giggles to erupt once more.

Girls were honestly very giggly people.

“Hmm… he was in the brave club, not the smart club,” Gwen said thoughtfully.

“You can be brave and smart,” a girl with thick black eyeliner and a nose ring said. “I’m going with the snake thing, no way Tony Stark’s kid isn’t top of his class.”

“Hands in the air if you’re voting snake?”

Over half the group put their hands up.

“Wrong,” Harry said with a smirk. He peeled his jacket off and rolled his shirt sleeve up to show his basilisk scar. “Snake bite when I was twelve.”

“Oh my god.” Brittany, who was sitting right up front with her blue hair friend’s head in her lap, gaped at the scar. “What the fuck kind of snake leaves a scar like that?”

“A big one,” Harry deadpanned.

“Twenty points to the art kids!” Gwen declared. “Peter, your turn!”

Peter groaned but got to his feet good-naturedly and grinned when he passed Harry to swap spots.

“Let’s see… I sing in the shower, green is my favorite color, and I’ve broken my arm twice.”

“Hey, Harry?”

Harry turned to Gwen and jolted backwards to see she was right in his face. “What?”

Gwen furrowed her brows and seemed to be staring really hard in Harry’s eyes. “Nothing,” she finally said after a moment. She turned back to the general group, “Peter’s favorite color is definitely green,” she told the others confidently.

“I think he’s broken his arm at least once I remember signing a blue cast he wore in third grade,” a bloke with glasses and a ‘Midtown High Band’ shirt said.

“We’re going with the shower singing is a lie,” Gwen called up to Peter.

“You are… wrong!” Peter held up his left arm. “I didn’t break this bad boy twice, I broke it three times!” He accepted a few high fives on his way back to where Harry and Gwen sat and the twenty points that Gwen gave ‘the nerds’. “Go on then, Gwendolyn, you’re up then I’m heading out.”

“Fine,” Gwen checked her phone and sighed. “It is getting late and I wouldn’t put it past my dad to have one of his friends drive by tonight.”

As Gwen moved to the front, Peter scooted next to Harry and tilted his head toward Harry’s.

“Are you in a rush to get home or do you wanna hangout?” he asked. Harry saw he had a flush to his cheeks, probably the same flush Harry had from the heat and the drinks.

“Definitely not in a rush,” Harry said.

Peter smiled, “Cool.”

“Cool.”

 

After Gwen lost twenty points from the ‘chameleon club’, which only consisted of her, for everyone accurately guessing that she never played with Barbie’s as a kid, Harry and Peter set off after an excessive amount of goodbyes.

“You’ve got a lot of friends,” Harry said casually as they strolled down the sidewalk in Gwen’s neighborhood.

“Me?” Peter chuckled. “Man, none of those kids ever even talked to me before they saw we were friends. It’s you they all wanted to talk to.”

“Me?” Harry furrowed his brows. “What for?”

Peter threw an arm over Harry’s shoulder, a causal and friendly gesture. “You’re a new guy, mysterious and funny. Iron Man’s secret son? Those eyes? Pft, you’re like a babe magnet.”

Harry scowled and kicked a rock on their path. “That’s mad,” he said lamely.

“That’s life, man,” Peter said. He glanced over at Harry subtly, “You have a girlfriend back in England?”

“No.”

“Boyfriend?”

Harry’s face had to be as red as Ron’s hair. He would have said he wasn’t gay, he was freaky enough with his magic, thanks, but he settled for another firm, “No.”

Peter, rather cryptically, said, “Good,” then added, “Me either.”

The posh houses got more sparse the further they walked and businesses with neon lights and music pulsing from inside became more common.

“It’s the city that never sleeps,” Peter grinned. “I like to ride around the city when I can’t sleep.”

Harry liked to stare out a window when he couldn’t sleep, so he figured it was just a difference in taste.

“Do you know how to ride?” Peter asked when he saw Harry looking at the skateboard sticking out of the faded navy backpack he wore.

“Not even a little bit, no,” Harry admitted. It looked easy when he saw people doing it down the sidewalk when he took Joey for walks though.

Peter reached over his shoulder and pulled the skateboard out in a single smooth motion. “You wanna learn?”

Harry felt suddenly shy with the smile Peter gave him, which was stupid, really. “Alright,” he agreed.

 

As it turned out, skateboarding was incredibly hard to do.

 

Peter took Harry to a park that had concrete ramps and holes and Harry watched as Peter made it all look so easy. He rode the board down in the hole, came up on the ledge, flipped it, went back down.

“You try,” Peter said with a bright smile. “Don’t worry about the other stuff, just… here…” He held Harry’s hand and helped him find his balance merely standing on the board. “Now use your right foot to push, like that… yes!”

Harry wobbled and shook and stumbled a few times, but Peter still jumped up and threw his fist in the air when Harry got to the other end of the park.

“Now come back!” he yelled.

Harry couldn’t figure out how to turn it, so he just grabbed it and turned it around and shakily made his way back.

“You’ll be a pro in no time,” Peter said. “Here…” he took out a pair of white earbuds from his pocket, similar to the ones Tony always wore, and handed Harry one. “It’s easier to ride when you’re listening to music.”

It was actually much harder because then Harry was distracted from pushing the board around by the music in one ear and Peter singing the lyrics as loud as possible in the other ear.

“It’s New York, Harry! No one sleeps here! Come on! Sing with me!”

Harry laughed, Peter’s enthusiasm and energy was contagious. “I don’t know the words.”

“Make it up then!”

Peter sat on a ramp and dangled his legs off the side while Harry wobbled around on his board.

“C’mon, this is classic Papa Roach! Because daaaaays come and goooo! But my feelings for you are foreverrrrr! Hit it, Harry!”

Harry laughed and tried to sing just as loud as Peter was. “Because days come and—”

“Scream it! Make everyone hear you!”

“MY FEELINGS FOR YOU ARE FOREVER!”

“Yess! One last kisssss, before I go! Dry your tears! It is time to let you go!”

 

By the time Harry fell off the skateboard for the third time, he moved over to the ramp to sit with Peter and they were stupidly singing all the songs in Peter’s ‘top playlist’. They fell over on each other, laughing their heads off, when someone from a distant apartment building yelled at them to ‘Shut the fuck up and keep their day jobs!’

“I’ll send it to you so you can be a true moody teenager,” Peter told him. He turned down the volume in the ear buds and clicked a few buttons on his phone. “Ta da! You’ve got my entire soul in song form now, be gentle with it.”

“You’ve got a song called ‘American Idiot’ on here,” Harry pointed out after he pulled his phone out to look through the songs.

“Which is a classic,” Peter nodded. “It’s my personal anthem.”

Harry laughed and checked his texts while he had his phone. He had seven new texts from Sirius he refused to open and three from Tony which he did open.

Hey kid, all good?

If I fall asleep before you’re ready to come back, call me for a ride, doesn’t matter what time, I’ll answer. No rush, have fun, be back whenever.

Preferably before breakfast. You do still have a sentence to serve.

“God, you’ve got like the most lenient parent ever,” Peter laughed as he peeked over Harry’s shoulder. “My uncle’s going to skin me alive when I get home.” Harry must have made a face, because he quickly added, “I’m joking, he’ll just give me a whole lecture about responsibility.”

“You live with your uncle then?” Harry asked, probably sharper than intended.

Peter leaned back on his hands, the shadows from the park hiding his expression as the wind ruffled his hair. “Yeah, my aunt too. My parents disappeared from a plane crash when I was a kid. They declared them dead when I was like 12.” He had his eyes closed, but he peeked one open to look at Harry, “They never found their bodies though, so it’s a mystery.”

Harry felt a pang of empathy for him. “Sorry,” he said quietly, “my parents died when I was a kid too. No mystery though, just murdered.”

“That’s rough,” Peter’s face was soft. “But you’ve got Tony, right?”

“I didn’t know we were related until a few weeks ago,” Harry said wryly. “Hell of a surprise.”

“Cool surprise?”

Harry hummed. “Not particularly. I had- I had a whole plan, you know? And now it’s all fucked up.”

He had a godfather. He had plans with his godfather. He was going to learn magic. Hide out from his problems. Be a family with Sirius.

Now he had no one, really. A Tony, which wasn’t nearly as good as a Sirius had been. Tony didn’t know him, didn’t understand him. Harry couldn’t call Tony when he couldn’t sleep, he couldn’t talk to him about his crushing loneliness or his most desperate desire to just be normal. He had a Tony, but Tony was a hero and Harry was a coward.

Eventually, Tony would probably get to know Harry and decide, like every other person, that Harry wasn’t worth the hassle. Then Harry would just have himself, which was both comforting and terrifying. He’d never abandon himself, which was nice, but he also would rather not spend much time with himself since he was his least favorite person alive.

Peter sat up and leaned against Harry, both of them looking out toward the never ending twinkling lights of the city while music played in their ears.

“The thing about plans, is you can always make new ones,” Peter said. He turned his head enough for Harry to see his smile out of the corner of his eye. “For the record? I’m glad your new plan involves being here.”

Harry turned toward him and his stomach tied itself into knots as he looked in Peter’s perfectly earnest brown eyes.

“Yeah, maybe one day I will too.”

 

By the time Harry and Peter left the park, caught a series of confusing buses and trolleys, it was eerily silent in Harry’s ‘neighborhood’.

Peter left Harry at the tower doors after forcing Harry to promise to text him so they could ‘hang out again soon’. It wasn’t all that hard of a promise to make, as Harry probably enjoyed spending time with him more than he should.

Peter was…

He was cute, which someone would probably have to be blind not to notice. He was funny too, a shit singer, but witty and a laugh to be around. And Harry kept thinking about how endless his brown and gold-flecked eyes were, and that said quite a bit more about himself than he cared to consider.

Harry entered the tower quietly, trying to remain inconspicuous. Tony had told him he could come back ‘whenever’, but three in the morning still seemed a bit extreme. Harry crept silently through the sitting room, peeking quickly in Tony’s room to see if he was asleep and letting out a relieved breath to see that he was.

He’d rather not be having a crisis and deal with Tony’s constant pestering questions.

Harry moved toward the kitchen, planning on getting a bottle of water, and froze before he made it to the refrigerator.

There was a man Harry had never seen before sitting at the counter. He had dark skin, a bald head, and a black eye patch across one eye. Harry froze immediately as he saw him and his hand inched toward the little silver weapon in his pocket. There was something commanding, fierce, just in the way the man sat there, staring at Harry, with his face set in terrifyingly hard lines.

“Well, well, well,” he said, “you do look a damn lot like your dad.”

It didn’t sound like a compliment or a question, so Harry stayed silent, caught like a deer in headlights.

The man leaned forward and Harry could see he had a decent number of scars on his face. He clasped his hands in his lap and he gestured with a hand toward a stool across from him. Then his eye flicked up to Harry’s forehead and he smirked, “Why don’t we talk about what the fuck Harry Potter is doing in New York, huh?”

Chapter Text

Friday, June 17

“Where is Harry at?”

Sirius grinned, “No idea.”

Remus growled and pushed his wand against Sirius’ throat even harder. “Sirius, where the fuck is he?”

“Ask Harry, oh, wait…”

“I know you were meeting with Stark today.”

“Jealous, Rem? Is that why you were following me? Stark looks good still, doesn’t he?”

Remus wouldn’t be distracted by pretty banter, apparently, his amber eyes narrowed and he probably thought he looked dangerous.

And maybe he would, except he had a coffee stain on the collar of his beige cardigan and no bloke in a beige cardigan with coffee stains was going to scare Sirius Black.

“The only reason I haven’t went straight to Albus is because we both know who Stark is,” Remus said in a harsh whisper. “Does he have Harry?”

The fact that Remus even considered going to Albus at all only firmed Sirius’ belief that this was one secret, one grand idea of his, that Sirius couldn’t trust his oldest and best friend with. Albus did a damn lot for Remus, and Remus hero-worshiped him.

Albus didn’t do jack shit for Sirius or Harry, and, thus, he had no respect for the man.

“Be hard to forget the bloke that gave James a topless lap dance, eh?” Sirius cackled and pushed Remus in the chest, hard, knocking him away from him. “I don’t know who you think Stark is, but you best keep your ideas to yourself, Moony.”

“And if I don’t?”

Sirius lunged forward and this time it was he who held a wand to Remus’ throat while Remus feebly jabbed Sirius in the stomach.

“Then I’ll kill you,” Sirius whispered, sounding as mad as everyone accused him of being. “You tell anyone a single bloody word about what you think, and I’ll be the last marauder standing.”

Traitorous rats notwithstanding. Wormtail was out of their group the instant he turned to Voldemort. And James always said it was blood in, blood out. Sirius couldn’t wait for the day that he could officially remove Pettigrew from the marauders legacy.

“You’re a jackass,” Remus sneered, his nervous eyes flicking down futilely to try and see the wand in his neck. “You think you’re the only one who cares about Harry? Huh? We’re all worried sick! We’re out running around, praying he’s alive, and trying to find him!”

“Yeah?” Sirius smiled cruelly. “Kind of you to care now, Rem. Where the fuck were you before now, hmm? Off licking your wounds, wallowing in pointless self-pity while our best mate’s son had a shit life? I’m glad Harry’s away from those muggles, bloody thrilled, because while you were off playing the pitiful wolf, our best mate’s son was being abused, tormented, neglected. So fuck you, Remus.”

Remus’ skin lost about three shades of color, his scars were a sudden stark contrast in his pale face. Sirius could see the regret in his eyes, but Remus was as stubborn as Sirius.

“Except he’s not our best mate’s son, is he?” Remus whispered. “Is that where Harry’s at? With his dad?”

Sirius knew that Remus didn’t mean it the way it sounded, but his blood still pounded in his ears for him saying Harry wasn’t James’. James knew Harry wasn’t his the day he was born, he didn’t give a damn. James was still thrilled to be a dad; not a day went by that James wasn’t gushing over his baby boy. Nobody in the world loved that boy as much as James did.

So Sirius lowered his wand and Remus only had a split-second to look relieved before Sirius drew his empty hand back in a clenched fist and hit Remus for all he was worth right in his mouth.

“James is Harry’s dad,” Sirius spat when Remus stumbled back and stared up at him with shocked eyes. “Whatever you saw today, whatever you heard, whatever suspicions are in your bloody head, forget them. I’m not joking this time, Remus. I don’t want to hurt you, but I bloody will.”

“You’re mad, Sirius.” Remus swiped at his mouth, adding a bloodstain to his sleeve to match the coffee stain on his collar. “You’ve lost the plot.”

“You never knew the plot,” Sirius told him coolly. “Go on now, go run off to Dora and cry about how you don’t understand why Sirius is being so mean to you.”

“Who’s jealous now?” Remus scowled. “You’ve changed, Pads, and not for the better.”

Remus stormed from the room, slamming the door shut behind him. Berk always did want the last word in an argument.

Sirius knew, he bloody knew, when he saw Remus digging in the Black Library one night, bags under his eyes, a fervor in his face, that he’d been looking for a way to find Harry. It hadn’t taken Sirius long to figure out Remus’ plot, not when he snuck around and saw the potion Remus was brewing in the basement.

Remus was an idiot. As if a jinx on Harry’s name would find him.

Sirius hadn’t expected to be the sole focus of Remus’ suspicion, and he had no idea when he’d managed to get the potion in him and the spell cast, but he’d been damn careful too. He had worked under the assumption that Remus, always so quick to suspect everyone around him of betrayal, would apply the jinx to the entire Order, and Sirius had a blast one day apparating around the country, under Harry’s cloak, whispering Harry’s name to the wind and seeing if Remus would show up. And Remus did, every time. So Sirius had been so careful when he met with Tony. He told him to not be seen, he told him not to say Harry’s name, and what happened?

Tony slipped up.

And now Harry’s safety rested on Remus’ ability to not run off to Albus.

Tony finalized everything, Harry was his son legally as well as biologically. Albus couldn’t drag Harry back into the war and Tony wouldn’t let Harry go, of that Sirius was certain, but Sirius didn’t want anyone to know where Harry was.

As Pettigrew proved, people on their side didn’t always remain so.

Sirius eyed his wand with a curious sort of detachment… Remus wasn’t the only one who could cast spells on people when they weren’t paying attention… Sirius could obliviate him; take away all his memories of Tony Stark and Sirius’ meeting with him earlier that day.

It was uncomfortable, even the thought making itself known in Sirius’ head, but if Remus said a single word at the order meeting that night, then Sirius would do what he had to.

He swore when Harry was born and James and Lily asked to be godfather that he would always put Harry first. He swore it again when he made Harry his heir the very day after he was born. And Sirius let him down in the worst way when he didn’t just take him and run, Sirius trusting in Albus’ word put Harry in a terrible situation with terrible people.

So, unfortunately, Remus could go fuck himself because Sirius wasn’t going to trust anyone aside from Harry’s dad this time.

He lost James and Lily because of a betrayal, he wouldn’t lose his godson for the same thing.

 

Sirius sent Harry a cheery text before he left his room for the meeting that night. Harry hadn’t answered any of his messages since they fought on Wednesday, but Sirius wasn’t going to stop messaging him. That was what Harry expected him to do, and Sirius loved nothing more than defying expectations. He had considered the fact that Tony was apparently monitoring Harry’s texts carefully before sending a super subtle message.

I miss you. Remember when you liked me enough to save me from the dementors? Good times. Love you, kiddo, stay away from ledges.

Tony would have to be thick to not get the reference at the end and keep Harry safe from himself. Then hopefully he’d also ask Harry what dementors were, Harry would spill the magic beans, and there wouldn’t be any secrets between the two of them.

And then Sirius could catch Pettigrew, clear his name, wait for Albus and Voldemort to destroy each other, and skip off to America to live with his godson and a hot redhead with a penchant for leather pants.

If there was a better future, Sirius didn’t know it.

 

Sirius was on his way downstairs when he heard a whispered conversation being held behind one of the doors that some of the kids were staying in. He touched his ear and the door, very gently, and silently intoned Marialos.

“Just say… ‘hey, mate, we miss you, please write and tell us you’re alive’.”

“Maybe add in a ‘we’re sorry we didn’t write, but Dumbledore’s a prat’?”

“I am not writing that.”

“Why? Because you don’t agree?”

“No, because it would be stupid to put into writing.”

It seemed like Hermione Granger was mildly more intelligent than Sirius gave her credit for.

“Tell him that Mum’s worried sick—”

“Harry loves Mum, it’ll guilt him into writing back if he’s alive.”

“He is alive!”

“Well we certainly hope so. Now, how do we send it?”

Sirius ended the spell and continued down the stairs with a grin on his face. It was good of Harry’s friends to finally be doing something. Ron and Hermione had busted out of the depressing prison a few days ago, but the idiots floo’d straight to the Burrow and Arthur caught them immediately.

Sirius expected more a bit cunning from them, but maybe Harry was the only one in his group of friends that had been considered for Slytherin. He’d have to mention to the twins later that he had a brilliant owl perfectly capable of finding anyone.

Subtly, of course.

“Kind of you to join us, Black,” Snape sneered the moment Sirius stepped in the dining room.

Bloke didn’t look so hot, in Sirius’ opinion. Must be hell playing double agent to two masters while searching for a kid on the side.

Too bad Sirius didn’t care.

Sirius made a dramatic show of looking up and down the packed table before he sat at his usual seat closest to the door. “I’d like you to say that to Albus when he arrives.”

Snape curled his lip and crossed his arms as he leaned back against the wall.

Git.

“While we wait…” Arthur looked around the gathered members expectantly. “Has anyone found a single lead on Harry?”

If Sirius felt badly for anyone, it was the Weasley family. Arthur had been running himself truly ragged, spending every hour he wasn’t at work out looking for Harry. Molly seemed to put all her concern into attacking Sirius’ house, as if clean curtains and dust free cupboards would find Harry. The oldest Weasley boy and his girlfriend had joined in on the hunt as well. The younger ones all offered, but Molly shut them down immediately.

‘The last thing we need is more of you to go missing!’

As if one of her kids would be a target for Voldemort like Harry was.

The atmosphere at the table thickened at Arthur’s question and Sirius made a point not to so much as breathe in Remus’ direction.

“I keep tellin’ Albus, the boy’s dead,” Moody finally grunted. “Been ten days since anyone saw him. Any day now the Dark Lord’ll have photo’s of Potter’s head splashed across the Prophet.”

Molly, rather predictably, let out a loud sob, and Bill narrowed his eyes at Moody from across the table.

“That’s real helpful, mate,” he scowled. “Why don’t we work under the presumption that this is a rescue mission and not a body removal?”

“Work under whatever presumption you want as long as you work with—”

“So help me god if you say constant vigilance I will kill you,” Tonks groaned from beside Remus. She rubbed her face with her hands and looked exhausted. “Moody’s brought up a good point though…”

“My godson is not dead,” Sirius growled as he banged his fist on the table.

Sirius didn’t like to count his chickens before they hatched, but if and when he cleared his name and made it to New York, maybe he’d take up acting. Merlin knew he was getting plenty of practice.

“Not that,” Tonks said hastily with a sympathetic look. “I mean the Prophet. It’s odd they haven’t gotten wind of it yet, isn’t it?”

“I see I have arrived not a moment too soon.” Albus swept in the room— Sirius could take pointers on dramatic entrances from him —with Minerva and Kingsley trailing behind him. Albus waited for Minerva and Kingsley to sit before he took the chair directly across from Sirius at the head of the table.

“I spoke with the Minister today.”

Sirius swore that Albus enjoyed chaos as much as he did on occasion. He certainly seemed content to let his comment begin shouts and arguments and disagreements as he sat back and watched them all.

“Quiet!” Kingsley said. He stood behind Albus, slightly to his left, and barely had to raise his voice for everyone to immediately fall silent.

“Thank you,” Albus said. “I believe we can no longer operate under the assumption that Harry left his relatives home under his own power.”

“And why is that?” Snape asked in a silky tone. “There is no evidence to prove otherwise.”

Albus gave Snape a faintly amused look that Sirius would have laughed about if his next words hadn’t been so insulting.

“Severus, do you truly believe that Harry could evade us if he were working on his own?”

“I have never believed he is working alone,” Snape said. His eyes flashed to Sirius and lingered long enough to drive his implication home.

Albus addressed his next words to Snape, except they were obviously aimed at Sirius. “Sirius would never assist Harry in hiding from us. He understands Harry’s importance in the war and the danger he could be in.”

Sirius absolutely did.

Which is why he made the decisions he did.

And Albus could play ‘disappointed grandfather’ all he wanted, Sirius slept like a damn baby at night knowing his godson was safe and James and Lily were likely cheering him on from the afterlife.

“I’d have to be a bloody moron to not know how important Harry is,” Sirius said, truly forcing the rough edge to his voice that preceded his best tantrums. “What’d you tell the Minister, Albus?”

Albus looked as if he believed Sirius, and Snape curled his lip and fell silent once more.

“The truth,” Albus said simply. “I informed him that Harry is missing and we suspect foul play by Tom or his followers.”

“You told the man who’s pretending You-Know-Who isn’t back that you think Harry was kidnapped by him?” Remus asked slowly. “What were you hoping to achieve, Albus?”

“Precisely what I have,” Albus said. “While Cornelius is skeptical about our theory on how Harry disappeared, he agrees that it is a scandal that cannot be ignored.”

A scandal.

It was a damn good thing that Sirius knew where Harry was or he’d be burning the Ministry to ash. Sirius actually got caught up in a fantasy of doing just that… he’d start at Grimmauld, move to the Ministry, maybe hit Malfoy Manor, would fiendfyre work on Azkaban?… and ignored Albus until he heard something that made his blood run cold.

“…MACUSA as well.”

“What?” Sirius shook his head and leaned forward on his arms. “What’s MACUSA doing?”

Snape muttered some comment about Sirius’ intelligence, but Sirius ignored him for once. MACUSA was the American wizarding government. Harry was in America. Harry was in America with one of the most famous blokes in the country, more than, even. Tony Stark was the muggle Harry Potter. It wouldn’t take Albus or Voldemort long to find out where Harry was if MACUSA got involved. Which would make the entire point of Sirius staying in England moot, as he only remained behind to clear his name with the magical government and keep anyone from tracking him to Harry.

“The Minister is listing Harry’s disappearance in the papers tomorrow and will be sending memos to other countries,” Albus repeated patiently. “I do not believe that Harry has left the country, but as Severus has not had an audience with Tom since before his disappearance, it is likely that Tom has taken him out of the country. Romania or Germany would be the most likely places. It does not hurt us, regardless, to have extra eyes searching.”

It bloody well hurt Sirius. Not that he could complain, it would risk looking defensive and suspicious. Already Remus was shooting him little glances.

If Remus were anyone else, if Sirius loved him a little bit less, he would have obliviated him the moment he apparated in the churchyard.

Sirius was on a sharp edge as he waited to see if there would be any more discussion about Harry. Talk turned to debates on having Snape tell Voldemort about Harry’s disappearance after the meeting or risk his anger if he finds out from a different source first. Sirius voted for them to wait, he was overruled.

Once the conversation started in on protecting the prophecy, using the man power they’d removed from the Dursleys after day two of Harry’s disappearance, Sirius simply waited for Snape to say something hateful.

It took less than 60 seconds.

Sirius started yelling and threw a curse at Snape, called him every name he could think of, and stormed from the room. He tripped on a cord outside the dining room and lifted the string to his mouth.

“You can use my owl,” he murmured softly.

Then he dropped the cord, made his way to his bedroom, and sent Harry another text he’d hoped Tony would read.

MACUSA is looking for you. Stay out of Landfara Way for a bit. Love you.

Ps: if a calico owl comes knocking, I heard she likes bacon.

He followed it up with a guitar and ghost.

 

Sirius wouldn’t spill the magic beans to Tony, that was on Harry. But if Harry was going to drag his feet about it, and the search party was going international, then Sirius was going to give them a prod in the right direction.

 

He flopped back in his bed after sending the messages and smiled at Hedwig. “Nothing wrong with a little motivation, eh?”

Hedwig hooted and pecked Sirius much harder than necessary in the leg.

“You’re just upset because he doesn’t need you to send messages anymore,” Sirius scowled. He sat up and rubbed his leg. “Jealousy doesn’t suit you, makes you look petty.”

Hedwig pecked Sirius’ other leg before swooping off to the safety of her perch.

“I hope you fall in the ocean and drown,” Sirius said darkly.

Hedwig let out a trill.

“Fine. Only because Harry might not forgive me. Otherwise I’d drown you myself.”

Hoot.

“You can tell him I said that, I don’t care.”

“Don’t tell him, he’s mad enough at me as it is.”

A softer hoot and a ruffle of her feathers.

“Thanks.”

Clint: He says he did.

Tony: I’ll add that to the ever growing list of ‘things I want an explanation for’.

Bruce: Does that go under ‘MACUSA’ and ‘Landfara Way’?

Tony: He is.

Natasha: He is.

Clint: Skater boy agrees.

Tony: Nice.

 

Clint: Tony… did you tell him he could drink and do drugs?

Tony: Yep.

Natasha: You jackass.

Tony: What? I was doing worse at his age.

Natasha: And look how you turned out.

Tony: Brilliant? Handsome? Rich?

Clint: Annoying.

Tony: Is Harry getting high? I bet he’d be hilarious if he were high.

Clint: He’s drinking a coke.

Natasha: Good boy.

Tony: Drinking a coke or snorting coke?

Clint: Drinking a coke and discussing the AA.

Natasha: Is he an alcoholic?

Clint: It means the Anti Avengers. Apparently his goal is to do the opposite of what we do.

Clint: I’m going to quit and join his team.

Tony: Me too.

Steve: DO NOT MAKE MORE NOISE.

Steve: SILENCE GROUP CHAT.

Tony: Oh for God’s sake, Steve! It isn’t that hard!

(Tony S. has removed Steve R. from group.)

Natasha: Thank you.

 

Tony: Update?

Clint: LMAO, the AA has decided to drink UV.

Natasha: At least the kid has a firm grasp on irony.

Clint: Tony, Skater Boy is auditioning.

Tony: For what?

Clint: Future son-in-law.

Clint: He told Harry that parents love him, he’s a dream come true.

Natasha: He’s flirting hardcore.

Tony: What did Harry say?

Clint: Told him he was also humble.

Natasha: He’ll have to flirt harder.

Clint: Nah. The kid is all red cheeks and smiles for this kid. I guess it’s just us he hates.

Natasha: We are adults. Those are children.

Tony: Thank you, Nat, I had no idea. Clint, update?

Clint: He asked the Skater Boy if he and Gwen are together. Skater Boy said no, the kid looks relieved.

Natasha: Why is she Gwen and he isn’t just Peter?

Clint: Peter’s a dumb name and I don’t know that I like this kid flirting with the kid.

Tony: Aww, Uncle Clint is watching out for Harry.

Clint: I’ll put an arrow through the kid’s head right now just to prove a point.

Natasha: Do it.

Tony: NOT FUNNY

 

Tony: CLINT!

 

Incoming call from Tony S.

 

Tony: UPDATE?!

 

Incoming call from Tony S.

 

Incoming call from Tony S.


Clint: I’m not going to shoot him. Relax.

Clint: Fuck you’re annoying.

Natasha: Hence why I told him no. Idiot.

Clint: They’re playing a game that involves drinking and telling secrets.

Tony: Very descriptive. Thank you.

Clint: Harry’s turn. Hold on…

Clint: Two things are true and one is a lie.

Clint: He stole a car and wrecked it.

Clint: He’s top of his class at his old school.

Clint: He got bit by a snake and almost died.

Clint: Which is the lie?

Tony: Bit by a snake.

Natasha: Top of his class.

Clint: LMFAO

Clint: He called himself a rebel with a cause.

Natasha: SMH.

Tony: Amazing.

Clint: Nat wins. Kid has a giant scar on his right shoulder from some sort of bite.

Tony: Must have missed it beneath the ducking bruise.

Tony: Fucking*

Clint: Probably. Oh. Skater Boy is up.

Clint: Ready? Which is the lie…

Clint: Sings in the shower

Clint: Green is his favorite color

Clint: Broke his arm twice

Natasha: If he’s hitting on Stark Jr, then green’s his favorite color.

Tony: Arm is the lie. He broke his left arm three times.

Natasha: Looking up medical records is cheating.

Tony: It’s called being resourceful.

Clint: Tony was right.

 

Clint: Hey, what’s the kid’s curfew?

Tony: Curfew?

Tony: He’s not a prisoner.

Natasha: Tony… you gave him a time to be home, right? He’s a flight risk.

Tony: Is he wearing his jacket?

Clint: No. He took it off and Skater Boy had to fan himself.

Tony: LMAO. Well, as long as Harry has it, I’ll find him. Also I have his dog with me. He wouldn’t leave it behind.

Natasha: And you and the kid call me the psycho.

Tony: Abducted by terrorists, Nat.

 

Tony: What’s Harry doing?

Clint: Blushing and making vaguely date-like plans with Skater Boy.

Natasha: How did Stark’s kid end up so… pure?

Clint: No idea. His mom, maybe?

Tony: LMAO. Wrong.

 

Clint: Harry and Skater Boy are leaving together.

Tony: Back to my place or Peter’s? Should I leave? Let them be alone? ;)

Natasha: You’re a pig. Harry’s been abused and you think he’s going to immediately sleep with his first boyfriend?

Tony: … point to the psycho.

Clint: Does Harry know he’s gay?

Natasha: Is it a secret? I think I saw him checking out Steve’s ass during game night.

(Tony S. added Steve R. to the group.)

Tony: You stay the fuck away from my son, Rogers.

Steve: …

Steve: How did I get back here?

(Tony S. has removed Steve R. from group.)

Natasha: Nice.

Clint: I don’t think the kid realizes he’s been checking out his friend all night.

Natasha: Maybe he’s in denial?

 

Tony: Update?

Natasha: You planning on sleeping, Stark?

Tony: Not really.

Clint: The Skater Kid is smooth.

Clint: I might shoot him.

Natasha: Do it.

Tony: Do not do it.

Tony: Yet.

Tony: What’s he doing to Harry?

Clint: Teaching him to ride a skateboard.

Natasha: ::puke::

Clint: Holding his hand. Sharing his earbuds.

Tony: That’s… that’s adorable, actually.

 

Clint: Oh, God. SOS. Fuck this. I need hazard pay, Stark.

Tony: IS HARRY OKAY? WHATS GOING ON?

Clint: They’re singing a duet.

Clint: They both suck.

Clint: Oh. Skater Boy isn’t even subtle with the lyrics.

Clint: And yet the kid is oblivious.

 

Clint: Here.

Clint: (Video Attachment)

Tony: First date in a skate park, a little trashy, but it’s fine.

Natasha: Are they… are they just sitting there, singing together?

Clint: Yup.

Natasha: That’s so sweet.

Natasha: I’m going to be sick.

Clint: They’re sharing playlists.

Tony: Wait- really? BRB.

Natasha: I’m going to bed. Call me if we’re killing Peter.

Clint: Will do.

(Natasha R. has left the group.)

 

Tony: Peter has decent taste in music.

Clint: Did you just hack your kid’s phone to see the playlist his little boyfriend sent?

Tony: It’s called parenting, Clint, you should try it.

Clint: No thanks.

Clint: Oof. Skater Boy made a joke about his uncle skinning him and the kid twitched so hard I’m surprised he didn’t fall.

Tony: Lovely.

Clint: I thought the Potter’s died in a car crash?

Tony: They did.

Clint: Then why did Stark Jr tell Skater Boy they were murdered?

Tony: 508 problems/questions long now.

Clint: Good news? The kid isn’t planning out loud on running away. Bad news? You fucked up his plans and he doesn’t like you.

Tony: Again I say, lovely.

Tony: I’m going to lay down. Will you text me updates and call me if anything happens?

Clint: You’re going to pout, aren’t you?

Tony: I’m not paying you for commentary.

Clint: You literally are.

Tony: Goodnight.

 

Clint: Skater Boy said he’s glad Harry’s plan involves him staying in NY.

Clint: Harry said maybe one day he will be too.

Clint: So that’s optimistic.

 

Tony: Thanks. Goodnight.

Chapter Text

“Why don’t we talk about what the fuck Harry Potter is doing in New York, huh?”

Harry had no idea who this man was.

Wizard? Death Eater? Assassin? ‘Superhero’?

Voldemort under Polyjuice?

Dumbledore under Polyjuice?!

Harry’s hand inched toward his pocket, slowly, as he tried not to gape at the man across from him.

“I’m Harry Stark, actually,” Harry said in a soft drawl. He didn’t enjoy being Stark, he just wanted to distract the man with words before he shot him with a laser.

It didn’t matter that Sirius had created this grand plan to get rid of Harry- the side part of the plan was still to stay hidden, stay safe for the first time in his life. And whoever this guy was, he clearly knew Harry Potter.

And that was bad.

So Harry was going to kill him.

“I’ve heard a few other names you go by,” the man said. His eye moved from Harry’s face to where his hand had moved closer to his pocket. “You have your wand in there, boy?”

There went the element of surprise.

“Call me boy again and we’ll see,” Harry said coolly, trying to speak quietly enough to not wake Tony, but loud enough to hear himself over the blood pounding in his ears.

The man gave him a long look before he slowly got to his feet and came around the counter toward Harry.

Harry backed up and stuck his hand in his pocket, clenching the laser. If he wasn’t a wizard, Harry could probably shoot him before he could kill him. “I’ll kill you,” he said, looking directly in the man’s eyes. “I don’t care who you are, come any closer and I’ll—”

“Little late for a visit, isn’t it, Nick?”

Harry didn’t turn, loathed as he was to take his eyes off this very obvious and unknown threat, but he could feel it as Tony stepped up beside him.

“Or is it early?” Tony went on, either oblivious to the thick tension between Harry and this man or determined to ignore it. “Harry, this intruder is Nick Fury, Director of SHIELD.”

That didn’t mean anything to Harry, aside from minimizing the likelihood that he was a death eater. Tony had other friends that had attacked him- and they hadn’t even known who he was.

The man finally took his eye off Harry to look over to his side at Tony, then he rolled his eye up to the ceiling and twisted his mouth into a grimace. “For Gods sake, Stark, put some damn pants on!”

Harry glanced to his side, out of habit, and fought back a snort to see that Tony was bare chested and bare legged. He wasn’t going to look down, but he really hoped the man had at least covered himself a little bit.

“If you don’t like seeing me undressed feel free to leave,” Tony quipped. He stepped closer to Harry and sounded just as casually rude as he always did. “Actually, feel free to do that anyway.”

Harry scowled when Tony reached over and tried to tug Harry backward by the jacket. It wasn’t likely that the man, Nick Fury, apparently, was going to attack him now.

People rarely attacked him in front of an audience, but this man could do a hell of a lot worse than attack him though, he could start talking. Depending on what all he knew, which the calculating glimmer in his eye told Harry that he knew a hell of a lot, he could ruin everything Harry had, as little as it was at the moment. He could start telling Tony that Harry was a freak, a coward, a wanted man with a madman after him. He could tell Tony that nobody around Harry was ever safe. He could tell this man that Harry got James and Lily Potter killed, he got Cedric killed, and if Harry stuck around, then he’d likely get Tony killed as well.

He could try and send Harry back, send him for the execution that Harry would surely face in England, or he could do it himself. And after the graveyard, Harry wasn’t going to give anyone else the satisfaction in taking his life.

“Untwist your panties, Stark, I’m not here to hurt the damn kid,” Fury scoffed, Tony’s movements to try and move Harry away from him clearly not going unnoticed.

“Clearly, I wear boxers,” Tony said haughtily. “What are you here for? Came to help me untwist them?”

“I came to find out why I didn’t get an invite to the baby shower,” Fury finally said slowly after giving Harry a long look that had Harry’s hackles raised and his hand poised to attack. Fury kept his eye on Harry as he spoke, “Tony Stark finds his long lost son and didn’t bother to have a party? That doesn’t sound like the Stark I know.”

Harry curled his lip up and raised his chin. “Bit of a surprise, I was,” he sneered. “Suppose he hasn’t had time to celebrate yet.”

Please leave… please leave… please leave…

Fury’s lips twitched into a smirk and it was as if Tony wasn’t even present the way he focused solely on Harry. “Yeah?” he asked gruffly. “Has he had time to get to know you yet, boy?”

Harry stiffened, the automatic way he always did when he was called that. “Rather bloody daft of you to call me ‘boy’ when you clearly know my name,” he said coolly, looking at Fury through hooded and furious eyes.

‘Boy’.

It was degrading. It was what you called someone when you couldn’t be bothered to speak their name. It was what you called someone when you didn’t think they even deserved their own identity.

The ‘Boy-Who-Lived’ was a way to slap a label on Harry’s life, make him a public figure, erase Harry Potter and force him in shoes that didn’t fit. Adding ‘Who-Lived’ didn’t make it less degrading, it just made the people who said it feel better about themselves.

“Which name should I call you?” Fury asked him.

Harry could feel the sweat on his palms causing the little weapon in his pocket to try and evade his grasp, but he held tight and tried to plead with his eyes.

Please shut up… please shut up… please shut up…

“Secrets don’t make friends, friends spill secrets,” Tony said abruptly in a sing-song voice. “Why don’t I go put on some clothes, Harry can check on the pup that keeps whining for him, and Nick can get some breakfast going. Then we can all sit and share our little secrets over pancakes? Harry, you’ll love Nick’s pancakes, he adds little chocolate chip frownie faces with one eye, it’s adorable.”

Harry glanced over at him and saw that Tony was watching the two of them closely with blatant curiosity. Harry ducked his head a bit, his head pounding as hard as his blood was, and wondered why this had to happen now. Now when he had no backup plans, no godfather to run off to if this didn’t work out.

“I’m not hungry,” he said truthfully. His stomach was knitted so tightly he actually worried that the drinks he’d had at Gwen’s house (was it just a few hours ago that Harry had been feeling like a normal bloke?) were going to make a reappearance.

They were definitely going to make a reappearance when Fury said he’d love to stay for breakfast and ‘catch up’.

“I can’t cook, but I bet Harry can make some truly magical pancakes.”

“Shut up,” Harry whispered.

“Will someone tell me what the hell is going on?” Tony demanded. He took a step closer to Harry, automatically driving Harry a step further from him. “Fury, why are you here bothering my son at three in the damn morning?”

“What I want to know is why your son chose now to come to America?” Fury said. He took another step toward Harry, and he was tall, too tall, and Harry had to glare up at him. “What’s Harry Potter doing in America when Tom Ridd—”

A name flickering in wandlight on smooth marble, Harry got one glimpse before he was slammed against it; Tom Riddle.

“I revenged myself upon him, that fool who gave me his name… Tom Riddle… Listen to me, reliving family history… But look, Harry! My true family returns…”

The laughter surrounding him as Harry struggled to survive- saw his parents and wondered why he bothered?

“SHUT UP!” Harry yelled at Fury. “SHUT YOUR BLOODY MOUTH!”

“Nick, leave,” Tony snapped. “I don’t know what the fuck is going on, but you need to go.”

“What’s going on is your son is a wiz—”

Harry couldn’t even pull the little laser weapon out. He felt a swell of fear, a rush of blood-boiling rage, and it was as if a push of those emotions flew straight from his chest to the man looming in front of him, threatening the only small bit of safety Harry had in anonymity, and threw him across the flat.

He struck his head on the thick glass window-wall, slid to the floor, and didn’t move.

 

Harry’s heart was thumping.

His thoughts were erratic.

He could feel magic swirling around him.

 

He stared at Fury on the floor until Fury was Marge floating away and Harry running to avoid prison or punishment.

 

Someone reached for him— he was going to be arrested, he was going to be thrown in Azkaban, he was going to be thrown in the cupboard —and Harry ducked from the arm and ripped his eyes away from the man he’d just attacked to find… to find…

 

There.

 

Harry saw the door that led to the emergency stairs and suddenly it was all he could see. Just a big, glowing, red, ‘EXIT’ sign.

 

He needed to exit.

 

Harry twisted away as someone tried to grab at him again- their words buzzing in his head in an incomprehensible blur -and he tore from the room as quickly as he could. The door he wanted seemed to fly open for him, inviting him to run, and Harry began racing down, down, down, until, his lungs burning and a fire racing through his chest, he pushed on the bottom door.

Locked.

“Open,” Harry cried, pushing on the metal bar as hard as he could. “Open! GOD DAMNIT, JUST OPEN!”

The door suddenly flung open and Harry stumbled out on to the ground that surrounded the tower. He looked around, lost and disoriented, and then he just began running.

Someone yelled, yelled his name, maybe—

“HARRY!”

“Not Harry!”

“KID! STOP!”

“Stand aside! I will kill him! He is mine!”

—and Harry put a burst of speed in to his steps, pushing his legs as hard as he could.

 

He wasn’t going to prison where Voldemort could just pick him up or kill him in a cell.

He wasn’t going to Azkaban where Sirius suffered so much at the hands of the dementors.

And he wasn’t going back in the cupboard.

 

Someone was gaining on him, Harry could sense them behind him, and he pushed faster, wishing he could just get away, just this once, just avoid whatever pain he needed to outrun this one time, and…

 

Crack!

 

Harry hit gravel on all fours, his stomach heaved and he began retching where he knelt. He didn’t move until everything ripped it’s way from his stomach to the ground.

He put his forehead to the ground, avoiding the vomit he stained the white rock with, and groaned.

 

He’d ruined everything.

He ruined his relationship with Sirius.

He ruined his safety with Tony.

He ruined his freedom.

He’d ruined his entire fucking life, but that wasn’t anything new to him.

 

Harry focused on breathing until his breath stopped shaking and the thoughts swirling in his mind settled into an ever present mist. He spat on the rocks one last time, the bile leaving a sour taste in his mouth, and then lifted his head to see what new level of fuck up he’d committed.

It took him a moment to squint through the darkness that clung to where he knelt, but when he made out the shining lights that made up the backdrop to his misery, the air in his throat caught.

He was so high.

Harry tried to stand, and the wind immediately made him wobble, but he persisted until he was on two feet and holding on to a short wall beside him. Harry gazed out at the sight in awe, the mist in his head evaporating slowly as the thrill of being so close to the clouds, so far from the ground, took hold of him as it always did.

The view was… it was nothing Harry had ever seen before. It was as if Harry were finally, blessedly, inconsequential when compared to the thousands and thousands of glowing lights on the other buildings that spoke of more people in that single city than Harry could even wrap his mind around.

Who cared about one kid with a few problems when every person with a twinkling light on had problems?

Did one person, did Harry, even truly matter in a world so large where all these people had reasons to be awake when the sun was gone and only the moon could watch over them?

It was a relief to realize that (Voldemort, Sirius, Dumbledore, Tony, his friends…) Harry didn’t matter at all.

Harry was less than an ant in the world.

 

He looked away from the skyline, turning his gaze downward, and his pulse picked up in tangent to his thoughts.

 

If Harry was an ant, inconsequential and insignificant, what was there to stop him from simply squashing himself? Harry didn’t want to let Voldemort take his life, he didn’t want Dumbledore to control it, Harry wanted to be free from the life others wanted him to have…

He bet falling would feel so free.

 

It was a more intoxicating thought than any alcohol he drank or magic that buzzed in his veins.

Harry held the cement wall tightly and leaned forward, a delighted gasp ripping from his mouth when his stomach swooped and the wind tried to push him over the ledge.

The mist was nearly gone, as if offering Harry a reprieve from all his thoughts in exchange for Harry seeing the solution to never thinking them again.

He thought about sending Sirius one last text, maybe even telling him he understood why he wanted Harry gone, he just needed him to understand why Harry wouldn’t force his company on himself either.

But… no.

Best to just let him move on without any final reminders. Harry told him that he wouldn’t bother him anymore, and he meant it.

Harry slowly swung his legs up, sitting on the rail and letting his feet dangle. He wondered how high up he was? High enough to not see the sidewalk clearly. High enough to never survive the drop.

The numbers didn’t matter if the result proved true.

Harry inched forward, his blood singing for release.

If they wanted Harry to go back to his old life, they’d have to drag his broken and cold body there.

He took a last steadying swallow of the cool night air that surrounded him, and then he…

 

Pushed off.

    Just a friendly reminder that our king (Peter Parker, of course) hasn’t been bitten yet. Otherwise, that theory of him web-slinging his way to Harry would be a top notch moment.

Chapter Text

“Jarvis, lock it down,” Tony said the instant Harry ran out the emergency exit. “Don’t let anyone in or out of the tower.”

“Yes, sir.”

Tony moved slowly over to Fury, watching his chest intently for any movements at all. As soon as he saw the way his chest rose and fell, a knot of tension unwrapped itself in his chest. Sure, he’d help the kid hide a body, but he didn’t exactly mean to start out with the director of SHIELD. Killing Nick Fury was the kind of thing a person worked up to.

Tony hadn’t been watching Fury, he’d been watching Harry. He watched as the kid got more and more agitated by whatever Fury was getting at before he finally seemed to snap. A great burst of energy, energy so strong it had been palpable, seemed to rush from Harry’s body to defend himself.

“What the fuck is going on?” Tony asked himself aloud as he stared down at where Fury seemed to be unconscious, but relatively uninjured. He checked his pulse, relieved to feel it thrumming along.

“Mister Stark, young Mister Stark has opened the emergency downstairs exit and is outside of the building now.”

“I just told you to lock it down!” Tony yelled. He didn’t even bother with pants, he just moved to the elevator and slammed his hand on the over-ride system, allowing the elevator to move to him immediately. He got on and began jabbing ‘One’ over and over with increasing desperation.

The kid was not in a good mindset, any idiot could see that. He’d looked furious and terrified, lashing out at first with his words then his weird energy thing (‘Your son is a wiz—‘) before finally bolting.

“I did, sir. It seems as if young Mister Stark used the same energy against the door as he did Director Fury,” Jarvis said while the elevator flew downward at what the public safety department had called ‘incredibly unsafe speeds’.

“Of course he did,” Tony muttered. “‘Wiz’, Jarvis, what do you think ‘wiz’ means?”

“I am unsure, sir.”

Tony scoffed, “Call Happy, tell him to get Fury out of the tower and change protocol, Fury doesn’t come back in unless I override the system, got it?”

And Tony wouldn’t be overriding a damn thing until he figured out why Fury had been there, wheedling his kid, pushing the kid to a breaking point.

Jarvis was confirming Tony’s demand as the elevator doors opened and Tony took off through the vacant and dark lobby in his boxers. He no more than stepped out the doors, his head turning side to side to find his kid, when he saw a dark blur sprinting down the sidewalk.

Tony raced after him, certain that dark blur was his kid. “HARRY!”

God damn the kid was fast.

A small part of Tony’s brain, the part that wasn’t worried as hell about this kid, cursed himself for not suiting up before chasing the kid.

Another tiny piece of his mind wondered if there’d be a piece in the morning news about Tony Stark running down the street in his boxers in the middle of the night.

‘Stark goes stark’, or something clever; probably mention his past drug and alcohol abuse, speculate on his mental status, same old story. Rhodey would get a kick out of it anyway.

“KID! STOP!” Tony pushed his legs as hard as he could— the two of them were going to eventually discuss Harry’s future as a track star —and tried to reach forward, grab the kid and make him talk, when…

Crack!

Tony fell backward so quickly that he fell on his ass.

His kid just disappeared.

“Ooh…” Tony smacked himself in the forehead as he stared hard at the spot where Harry had been standing. He finallyrealized what Fury had been trying to say before Harry zapped him. “‘Wizard’. My son is a wizard.”

An incredibly unhelpful though to have, but Tony realized that Clint was not going to be happy about Harry’s skill.

 

“Sir?”

“Not now, Happy,” Tony said brusquely as he strode back in the apartment. “Jarvis, track Harry,” he said as he went straight to his room for some damn clothes. He pulled on a pair of jeans, figuring he wasn’t going back to bed anytime soon and grabbed a shirt at random. He ignored Happy when he stepped back in the living room and started typing commands in his phone.

“Sir, young Mister Stark is at 225 West 57th St.”

Tony glanced up from his phone toward Happy. “What is that?”

Harry’s brows were pinched together in the center of his forehead and he shrugged one of his broad shoulders. “Central Park Tower, maybe?”

“Jarvis, I want every available camera footage in the area being fed to me,” Tony ordered. “Do you have eyes on Harry?”

“I do, sir.”

A screen popped up from Tony’s phone and Happy got up from the couch to come look at it.

“Son of a bitch.” Happy whistled lowly. “How the hell did he get up there?”

Tony’s stomach clenched as he watched his kid cry out- sounding truly miserable and alone -after expelling his stomach contents on to a rooftop.

“I have to go,” Tony said abruptly, not answering Happy until he knew for sure what was happening. “Sirius said stay off ledges, and that is a tall fucking ledge.”

“Want me to come?”

“Nope.” Tony hit a button built into the wall and summoned his suit from the lab. It began forming itself around him while another quick button slid part of the windows into the wall and gave Tony an easy escape. “Stay here, keep everyone out. I’m going to go get King Kong down without killing any civilians.”

Happy shouted ‘good luck’ while Tony flew out the window.

 

“Alright, Jarvis, let’s see that footage, what’s the kid doing?”

“Crying, sir.”

Unhelpful.

One side of Tony’s interior helmet began a live feed of a rooftop security camera featuring what looked like the loneliest damn kid in the world. Harry stood at the edge of the roof, over a thousand feet in the air, and had tears trailing down his cheeks while he stared out at the skyline.

“Scared?” Tony murmured to himself, attempting to assess Harry’s mood while he flew toward him. “Depressed? Does he think anyone cares that he knocked Nick’s ass out?”

“Sir…”

Tony swerved in time to avoid a building. “Good looking out, Jarvis.”

He was closing in on the kid, less than two minutes out, when the scene unfolding before him began to change.

“No, no, no, what are you doing?” Tony hissed. His kid leaned forward across the rail and laughter rang through the feed as Harry was nearly pulled down the side of the building. “Get down! No! Damn it, Harry James! That is the opposite of what you should do!”

Harry couldn’t hear him, probably wouldn’t care if he could. He climbed up on the ledge and dangled his feet over a thousand feet in the air, and began inching forward.

“Faster,” Tony commanded his suit. He activated the jet exhaust, cutting his time down. “Fly fas- NO!”

Tony could see on the footage as he kid, his son, pushed himself forward and disappeared. “NO! No, no, no!”

He put everything he had in his speed as he raced forward, his eyes on reality now as he could make out a small blur free falling from the top of the building. The blur- not a blur, but a kid, his kid -got bigger the closer Tony got, but it also picked up speed the further it fell.

“This is going to hurt like hell,” Tony murmured as he angled it just right, coming up from the bottom and caught Harry’s body against his solid iron suit.

Harry’s body let out a harsh ‘oomph’ and his head smacked against Tony’s helmet, but Tony had his arms around him and flew them back up to the top of the building.

“WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING?!” Tony yelled the moment they were on the roof and his face shield was up. He kept ahold of Harry’s shaking arms, gently, but firmly, in case the kid tried jumping again. “DID YOU THINK YOU COULD FLY?!”

Harry had a split on his forehead from where he’d smacked Tony’s helmet, a small stream of blood oozed out, but it wasn’t fatal.

Not like that landing would have been.

“WHY DO YOU CARE?!” Harry screamed, defiant despite the never ending tears. “LET ME GO!” He yanked his arms, but Tony wouldn’t relent. He wasn’t going to hurt him, but he wasn’t giving him any easy chances to jump again. “LET ME GO!”

“Not until you tell me what you were thinking,” Tony said, more calmly as he saw the terror and misery in the kid’s green eyes. He pulled Harry down to the ground with him, forcing him to sit, and held his arms in place at his side.

“Thinking?!” Harry let out a loud bark of joyless laughter. “I was thinking ‘oh, hey, here’s a way to be done!’ I was thinking everything is ruined, I’ve ruined everything, AND I DON’T WANT TO DO IT ANYMORE!”

“Hey, shh, calm down.” Tony gently placed Harry’s hands on his lap, his own arms outstretched and prepared to lunge if the kid moved. “What did you ruin? I don’t understand. Will you explain it?”

Whatever it was Tony said, it seemed to snap some life in Harry’s expression. His lips tightened and he worked his jaw from side to side as he looked at the visible part of Tony’s face.

He would take his helmet all the way off, but he didn’t want to be unprepared if he needed to follow the kid off the building.

“You saw,” Harry said. He licked his lips and averted his eyes down to his lap. “You saw what I did.”

“Magic?”

Harry’s eyes snapped upward then went right back to his lap. He tried to inch backward on his knees, but Tony grabbed them and carefully held him in place.

“Is it… is it new?” Tony guessed wildly, unsure why the magic would make Harry so incredibly upset that he was prepared to smash himself on the sidewalk.

“No.”

“Did it hurt?”

Harry didn’t move much, merely raised his head maybe half an inch so he could look up at Tony through his lashes. “No?”

Tony sighed and closed his own eyes. “I don’t get it then. How did you ruin everything? And- and why… why did you jump?”

“Is he dead?”

“Who? Fury?” Tony nearly laughed, was that what Harry was afraid of? That he had killed him? “No, Harry, he’s fine. I mean, I’m certainly going to kill him myself, but you didn’t do more than knock him out.”

“Why?”

Tony needed a damn translator. He had been incredibly close to calling Sirius Black in that moment, wake his ass up, make him translate. “Why what?”

Harry’s shoulders curled inward and he seemed determined to not look at Tony. “Why’d you stop me?”

Tony’s jaw dropped open. “Did you think I wouldn’t?” he asked after puzzling through the question and only seeing a single meaning. “Did you think I’d just want my son to die?”

Harry’s shoulders hitched at the end of Tony’s own question. “You don’t get it,” was all he said though.

“Explain it then, please,” Tony begged. “Tell me what I don’t get, tell me what I’m missing, tell me everything, kid. I can’t help you if I don’t understand.”

Harry raised his hand to his forehead, and Tony frowned at the injury he’d unintentionally given him.

“Ow.”

It wasn’t that Tony doubted if the cut hurt, but Harry chose a convenient time to notice it.

“Do we break into the building and walk downstairs or do you want me to carry you back home?” Tony asked when it seemed as if Harry wasn’t going to say anything else at the moment.

Harry’s hand shook where he held it against his forehead nearly as hard as his voice did. “If I go back there, they’ll find me. I- I have to leave…”

“Hey.” Tony grabbed Harry’s hand and lowered it so he could see his face. “Who?”

Harry’s eyes began darting around the rooftop, as if searching for an attacker amongst the rock and the wind. “MACUSA.”

That was actually the second time Tony heard the term. The first was in a text Sirius had sent Harry, ‘MACUSA is looking for you. Stay out of Landfara Way for a bit’. Tony, Bruce, and Natasha combined couldn’t discover the meaning behind the nonsensical term, but Harry clearly understood it.

“Who is MACUSA?” Tony asked Harry. “I’m not going to let anyone find you if you don’t want found. Tell me who they are and what they want you for and I’ll figure it out.”

Harry laughed bitterly again and shook his head, still seeking out something with his restless and weary eyes. “American magical government, they’re going to find me and they’re going to arrest me.”

“For what?” Tony asked, sick of having to ask questions and not just know the answers already. The first thing he was doing when he got home was calling Sirius and demanding answers. “Fury is fine, Harry, and he’s not going to press charges,” Tony assured him.

“Underage magic is illegal,” Harry said flatly, his voice no longer shaking. “They’re going to arrest me.”

“Kid, do you think I can’t keep you hidden from a couple wizards?”

Harry finally looked straight at him and Tony almost wished he hadn’t. He wasn’t frantic anymore, he wasn’t scared, he just looked… accepting. Accepting in a way that men walking to the electric chair might look.

“You won’t be able to stop them,” Harry said, not a taunt, but a fact.

Tony smirked, “How much are you willing to bet? My team stopped a God with an army of aliens from another universe. I didn’t see any puny wizards helping us then. No offense,” he winked.

Harry didn’t grin, didn’t change expression at all. He mumbled ‘we’ll see’ and tried to stand up.

“Woah, easy there, Elvita Adams,” Tony reached out to steady Harry as his legs shook and looked ready to collapse beneath him. “Where we going, kid?”

“I…” Harry blinked and shook his head, Jesus, the kid was out of it. He probably hadn’t gotten good sleep since before their last fight on Wednesday night. “I don’t know?” Harry mumbled.

“Home?” Tony coaxed him. He ducked down so that Harry could see the truth in his words and the genuine hope in his eyes. “I want you to come home and I will keep this MACUSA from getting you. Just… just trust me a little, Harry, please?”

“I don’t want to go to prison, I don’t want to go back, and I don’t want to go in a cupboard,” Harry said plaintively. He stared at Tony hard, not blinking, until Tony realized he was supposed to answer that incredibly messed up statement.

“I don’t even have a cupboard, and I wouldn’t let anyone put you in one if I did,” he added quickly. No need to make a joke about the Hulk cage. “Nobody’s taking you anywhere.” Tony tapped his chest with one hand, the metal knocking ringing in the wind that surrounded them, “They’d have to fight me, and I’ve never lost a fight before.”

Not many, anyway.

It felt tense, the air between them. It felt like their entire future hung on what should have been a simple request. Kids trusted their parents to protect them, to help them, to give them a home. Tony wasn’t asking Harry to trust him forever, just this one damn time.

“I- I don’t know that I can make it down the stairs,” Harry said quietly, his face as red as it had ever been and his eyes firmly on his sneakers.

Tony let out a heavy sigh, relief sagging his shoulders inside his suit. “You like flying?”

There was a tiny, ‘blink and you’ll miss it’, glimmer in Harry’s green eyes when he peeked up at him. “Love it.”

 

As much as Harry might have loved flying, Tony had never sweat inside his suit as hard as he did as he held his son tightly in his arms and flew them toward Stark Tower.

“Who’s Elvita Adams?”

“What?”

Harry shouted again, “You called me Elvita Adams, who is that?”

Tony silently cursed at himself for being so damn witty in the worst moment to the worst audience.

“Don’t worry about it,” he said.

Harry hummed skeptically, but went back to watching the skyline as they flew from one tower to the other.

 

Happy leapt to his feet the moment Tony and Harry flew through the window. “Sir, everything okay?”

“Fine,” Tony said. He stood Harry firmly on his feet and retracted his helmet. “We are on PHAT Lockdown, as of now until I override with the password, got it?” Tony and Happy made eye contact as Happy nodded. “Go get me a package of bandages, Happy.”

“Yes, boss.”

“What’s fat Lockdown?” Harry asked without any real curiosity in his tone.

“P-H-A-T,” Tony explained. “It’s something Happy and I developed a whole back. Everyone moved in, things got a little crazy, so I separated myself from my team with ‘Pepper, Happy, and Tony’ Lockdown. Basically a fun acronym for ‘leave me the hell alone’. Now it’s PHAT, with a double H, Ph-hat, or something. We can rename it later.”

“Ah.”

Whatever moment of vulnerability Harry had shared on that rooftop seemed to be slipping away as his muscles stiffened, his face hardened, and his eyes were hooded and uninterested when Happy returned with the box.

“I can do it,” Harry said when Tony approached him with the bandaid. He touched his forehead again and smirked slightly, “Think it’ll scar?”

“Probably not,” Happy said with his adorable earnest energy. “It’s just a little cut.”

“Damn.” Harry pocketed the bandages and stared up at the ceiling with disinterest.

“Oh! Yeah! Harry, you got an… owl… twice,” Happy said. He handed Harry a fistful of papers that were on the coffee table. “One flew back through the window after it left that envelope. The other one went in your room, Harry. I, uh… I tried to get it out, and, well…” He held a finger with a tiny trickle of blood up sheepishly. “It bit me.”

“So you just let it in—”

“Hedwig.”

“What?” Tony looked down at Harry and saw a very slight hint of a smile on his face. The first one he’d seen in days. “You know this evil carrier pigeon?”

Harry’s lips curled up a little more. “If she hears you call her that, she’ll bite you again.”

“It’s real mail then?” Happy asked curiously. He sucked on his injured finger before looking at Harry expectantly, “From who?”

Harry lifted the papers Happy gave him and blanched.

“Hap, why don’t you wait for me in my office and we can gossip and have girl time here in a few?” Tony said in a bright and pointed manner. He tilted his head toward his office, “Now? Happy?”

Harry unrolled the thicker paper, the one rolled up like an old fashioned scroll, after Happy left the room. Harry took one very brief look at it and quickly stuffed it in his back pocket.

“That good, huh?” Tony asked.

Harry shrugged, “My friends,” he said simply.

He slowly opened the envelope, moving with all the delicacy of a bomb detonation expert, instead of elaborating on the other letter and pulled out a perfectly normal seeming sheet of paper. “What the fuck?” he whispered after he stared at it for a long and tense moment.

“The suspense is killing me, kid,” Tony groaned dramatically, yet truthfully, when Harry didn’t seem all that inclined to let him hear what it said.

Harry glanced up at him and held the sheet of paper out. “You might as well read it, it mentions you,” he said flatly. “Seems as if I get one last night of freedom.”

    Dear Mister Potter-Stark,
    Greetings!
    I wanted to reach out to discuss your recent bouts of accidental magic in the presence of no-maj’s on Sunday, June 19 at approximately 0321, 0325, and 0331.
    If you and your father have no contradicting plans, perhaps we could discuss this at my office located in MACUSA Headquarters in the Woolworth Building at 233 Broadway on Monday morning, around 0800. If this does not work for you, kindly contact us and we will be happy to reschedule. If you are unable to come to us, I will come to you at Stark Tower.
    Your father should know where our building is located, as his green friend once smashed an alien through our windows.
    I look forward to meeting you both in person.
    Best regards,
    President S. Quahog

“Well, he’s got ‘vaguely threatening’ down to a science,” Tony mused as he reread the part about the President coming to Harry. He rubbed his chin thoughtfully and looked up at Harry and frowned to see his son looked like he was a second away from just falling over.

“You, bed,” Tony said firmly. “Sleep, rest, reset your batteries. We will deal with this,” he shook the letter before laying it on the coffee table, “tomorrow. Today, just… just sleep, alright, kid?”

Harry continued to just stare at him with dull eyes as he swayed in place. “I… I can still stay?” he asked softly, breaking Tony’s heart by the implication.

Between the sarcastic kid with a quip for everyone and the wide-eyed kid who looked surprised at basic human kindness, Tony wasn’t entirely sure who his son was.

But he was determined to get to know him.

“Ki— Harry, you’re my son, my family,” Tony said firmly. “I don’t care if you’ve got an entire army of wizards chasing you. I’m not scared of them, and I’ve got a hulk on our side. This is your home, your US Embassy, and MACUSA can fuck off with their underage magic bullshit. Got it?”

Harry blinked at him and shook his head slowly, as if he’d never heard anything so outrageous in his life, so Tony simplified it for the kid.

“I want you here,” he said firmly. “We are a family, you are stuck with me. Go, sleep. I’ll be here when you wake up.”

Harry just stared at him for a long moment, searching for something on Tony’s face, before jerking his chin in a nod and moving to his room with all the noise of a ghost.

“Oh, hey,” Tony stopped him before he shut his door, “leave that open, will you? So little Mister Arsehole can come out if he wants? Poor little guy’s been trapped in there all night.“

 

And the last thing Tony needed was Harry deciding a razor looked as tempting as a 1,000 foot free fall.

 

As soon as Harry silently did as he asked, Tony moved toward his office and poked his head in.

Happy sat in Tony’s desk chair, his feet propped up on the mahogany desk, two cups of steaming coffee in front of him.

“Morning, boss,” he said. He moved his feet and dropped them to the floor with a heavy thud. “Feel like telling me now why I had to have Natasha and Clint drag Nick Fury back to his own office?”

“Not particularly, no,” Tony said. “Here’s what I need, Hap, I need you to go sit right outside Harry’s bedroom door and don’t move. Any noise, any movement, check on him. If he’s breathing too loudly or too quietly, check on him. If you need to take a piss, text me first so we can swap out.”

Happy got to his feet immediately, it was hardly the oddest request Tony had ever made of the poor man.

Tony stopped him when he went to grab one of the coffee mugs, “Leave them,” he said. “Please.”

Happy’s brow furrowed as he stepped up beside Tony in the doorway. “Rough morning?”

Tony let out a joyless laugh when he saw the clock said it wasn’t even six am yet. “You have no idea,” he said.

Happy clapped him on the shoulder, entirely sympathetic despite having no idea what all had happened. “Someone after the kid?” he guessed.

“Himself, so far,” Tony told him. A partial truth, at a minimum. “Seems to be his worst enemy. Oh, and some pissed off wizard politicians, maybe.”

Happy’s eyes were soft despite the crinkle of confusion in his forehead and he nodded before moving out of the office doorway so Tony could step inside.

“I’ll watch him, boss,” he said, despite his obvious confusion about the entire scenario.

“Remind me later to give you a raise,” Tony called quietly as Happy moved through the rooms with practiced silence.

Not like Harry.

Harry moved silently as if he didn’t want anyone to know he existed. Harry floated. Happy’s every step was trained, careful, precise. Happy moved like a soldier, Harry moved like the ghost he tried to make himself become.

Tony sighed and rubbed his forehead as he moved to go slump down in his chair. He hadn’t been equipped to handle a teenager. Let alone a teenager with magic. A teenager with magic who did a swan dive off a 98-story building.

A teenager with magic who did a swan dive off a 98-story building who was in some sort of trouble with the American magical president.

Tony gave himself approximately five minutes to have a private pity party before he pushed himself in a sitting position, drank half a cup of the scalding coffee, and pulled out his cell phone.

“Jarvis, is Harry asleep?”

“He is in bed with his eyes closed, sir.”

“Good enough. Happy in there?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Good.”

Tony pulled up his contact list and sent a text to the person who seemed to know exactly how to handle the cluster fuck of a situation he found himself in…

Call me, immediately.

He then looked over Harry’s summons again and thought it over carefully.

“Jarvis, give me everything you have on a S. Quahog,” he ordered. He pulled up his computer screen in preparation for the files. His eyes then flicked over when his phone vibrated and he saw the name.

“Send me the files, Jarvis,” Tony said curtly. “I need to take this.” Tony reached over and clicked the accept button before drinking down the second half of one of the coffees Happy left.

“Tony? Everything okay?”

“No,” Tony said truthfully. “It’s been a hell of a day, but I have the big piece of the puzzle and I’m ready for the details.”

Sirius’ voice was instantly alert and wary. “Is Harry okay? What happened?”

“No, and everything,” Tony said with purposeful vagueness. “You first, tell me everything.”

Sirius hesitated, “What do you know?”

“Magic,” Tony said. “The kid’s magic. Tell me the rest now.”

“Tony, I’d be bloody thrilled,” Sirius sighed. “Let’s start with the week Lily found out she was pregnant…”

 

Tony snagged a notebook and pen from his desk drawer and began writing as Sirius began finally giving him all the answers he needed…

 

Happy sat in his seat outside Tony’s asshole son’s bedroom door, peeking inside occasionally to check that the cute little pup was the only one moving around, while he played Tetris on his phone. All in all, working for Tony was an easy gig, paid well too. Sure there were some oddities like the Hulk, the Super Soldier, and now wizards, but still, easy money working for his buddy.

Happy startled and dropped his phone, his hand moving automatically for the gun he carried on his hip, when he heard Tony shout clear from his office behind the walls reinforced for privacy.

“WHO THE FUCK IS VOLDEMORT?”

Happy grinned wryly as he plucked his cell up from the floor and went back to moving a few blocks, checking on the kid, moving a few blocks, check on the kid.

He didn’t know who, or what, a Voldemort was, but if they were causing Tony to shriek like that, then they better watch their back. Tony was a spiteful and cruel son of a bitch when he wanted to be.

Chapter Text

Harry groaned the instant he felt himself waking. Everything hurt, something wet was on his cheek, and something sharp was in his ankle… He tried to ignore it, ignore the everything that wanted to yank him from his sleep, just drift off…

“Gerroff,” Harry moaned when something wet and scratchy rubbed across his cheek again and something sharp stabbed his ankle. “Kill me or go away.”

Hoot!

Woof!

Harry jerked upright and saw Joey standing beside where his head had been, his little tail wagging happily, and…

“Hedwig,” Harry breathed. She was smaller, her feathers a different color, but Harry would recognize those yellow eyes and haughty expression anywhere. “Oi! Why’d you peck me?” he grumbled when he realized that her sharp beak had been the thing stabbing his ankle.

Hedwig ruffled her feathers and began a long series of hoots that sounded a lot like complaints. Her complaints only ended when Harry moved Joey to his lap and held his arm out for Hedwig to come perch on him and begin picking at his hair with her beak while he smoothed her wings.

“I missed you too, girl,” he murmured. “Did Sirius treat you okay?”

An especially hard yank of Harry’s hair seemed like a no.

Joey let out a whining yip which caused Hedwig to hoot which caused Harry to sigh.

“What time is it?” He automatically reached over to his nightstand for where he usually left his phone while he slept, but the empty table brought back the night before and everything that happened.

“Oh, god.” Harry’s eyes were wide and he felt sick to his stomach. He’d performed magic in front of muggles, attacked that man, and…

“I jumped,” he whispered, dumbstruck. “I bloody jumped.”

In all of Harry’s wildest fantasies about dying before Voldemort could kill him, dying to escape the little shit life he’d had, he’d never actually done anything before. He’d sat on the Astronomy Tower at Hogwarts and think about it. He’d eye the knives in the Dursley’s kitchen and think about it.

It had always been a vague idea, a last resort escape plan, but… but he jumped.

And then smashed into a flying metal man, had an embarrassing meltdown, flew back to Tony’s house, and was sent to bed like a child.

At least smashing into Tony’s Iron Man suit explained why Harry felt so sore.

Harry wriggled around until he could move his phone from his pocket. He tried to click on the screen, but it wouldn’t work. He frowned and plugged it in, waiting for it to light up, and frowned that much harder when it didn’t. He didn’t remember breaking it, but he didn’t use it after he got back to Tony’s either.

“What the hell?” Harry murmured. He swung his legs over the side of the bed, silently cursing in his head as he did, and glanced at the two animals watching his every move. “Can you lot wait five minutes for me to shower before we find you food and go outside?”

Hedwig immediately flew to Harry’s dresser, perched on top of the dark wood, and nestled her head in her wing as an answer. Joey barked, which could mean anything really. Harry saw his bedroom door was still open though, so it wasn’t as if Joey would starve while Harry showered thanks to the bloody expensive feeders Tony bought him.

He glanced out the windows, trying to judge the time based on the current level of brightness, and grimaced when he had no good guess. His phone was his only clock in the room, and he…

Oh.

The robot bloke.

“Er… Jarvis?”

The robot bloke answered immediately, which meant he was always listening, which meant Harry had been talking to Hedwig and Joey in front of an audience apparently.

“Yes, Mister Stark?”

Harry scowled, “Call me Harry. And d’you know what time it is?”

“It is currently four twenty-seven pm, Harry. And your father has requested that I inform you that there is food and ibuprofen in the kitchen that you should help yourself to.”

“Right…” Harry dropped his voice to a whisper, conscious of the open door. “Is he in there?”

“No, Harry. Mister Stark is in his office.”

Harry felt his tense shoulders relax and he rolled them while he tried to remember the odd phrase Tony had used last night. “Is it still… er… P-H-A-T lockdown?”

“Yes, Harry. The only current occupants on this floor are Mister Stark in his office and Mister Hogan in the living room.”

Harry nodded and winced when he stood up; Merlin, he was sore. He felt like he’d just gone ten rounds with Dudley and his gang.

He’d been collecting clothes from his dresser and closet when he had another thought.

“Hey, Jarvis?”

“Yes, Harry?”

“Er… are they mad? Tony or Happy?”

It took Jarvis a moment to answer, and Harry really hoped he wasn’t asking them. Before the silence wore on too long though, Jarvis came back.

“No, Harry. I have assessed their moods based on their facial expressions and have deduced that Mister Stark is hungry and occupied with his thoughts while Mister Hogan is tired and focused on beating level 55 of Pac-Man on his phone.”

Harry let out a surprised laugh at Jarvis’ efficiency and thorough response. “Thank you,” he said genuinely while he moved to the bathroom. “I think we’re going to be mates, Jarvis.”

“Fantastic, Harry. I will begin researching friendship bracelets for humans and ‘robot blokes’.”

Harry laughed again. It seemed like something Tony would do, program his own robot assistant to be as cheeky as he was.

 

After he showered and inspected himself, he was surprisingly injury free, aside from a small cut and fresh bruise on his forehead, Harry snatched Joey off his bed, squared his shoulders, and stepped out in to the sitting room.

“Morning, kid.” The muggle (Harry hoped he wasn’t hiding any secret powers) bloke that had a row with Harry when he first arrived in New York sat in a recliner directly across from Harry’s bedroom doorway. He was staring down at his screen, but Harry got the distinct impression that he was also looking him over as well.

“It’s almost five,” Harry pointed out dryly.

“God, you sound like your dad,” Happy huffed. He looked up from his phone and saw the dog wriggling in Harry’s arms. “He need to go out again? I let him out a while ago.”

“Seems like it,” Harry said. He made to move toward the lift and paused when he saw Happy standing up and stretching. “I can go by myself,” he told him coolly.

“I figured,” Happy snorted. “But the doors won’t open for you during lockdown and I could use a smoke.”

Harry grit his teeth together and nodded slightly. He didn’t actually enjoy being locked in, even if technically they were locking others out.

The two of them, plus Joey, plus Hedwig who swooped into the lift at the last moment and landed gracefully on Harry’s shoulder, were quiet as they moved down to the lobby and out the back door to the private little backyard where Joey could run. Hedwig took off for the skies the moment they were outside, and Joey began running with all the energy of a puppy, while Harry just sat beneath the single tree and leaned against the trunk.

“How does the bird know where to take mail?” Happy asked after sitting against the tree, close but not too close, and lighting a cigarette.

Harry shrugged and tossed a tennis ball for Joey, suddenly reminded of the letter signed ‘Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Gred, and Forge’ up in his room. “She’s a genius, I suppose.”

Happy chuckled, “What’d you call her? Hedwig?”

Harry hummed and watched Joey chase the ball.

“What’s it mean? Is it French or something?”

“Latin, actually.”

Happy sounded impressed, “Really?”

Harry scoffed, “No.”

“You’d never know you didn’t grow up with Tony around,” Happy said, he didn’t sound annoyed, just amused. “The man’s always had a smartass comment for everything.”

Harry glanced over at Happy and saw that he was toying with a cigarette, not even truly smoking it, merely holding it and flicking it awkwardly.

“How long have you known him?” Harry asked curiously. The others in the tower all obviously met through their antics as heroes, Pepper said she met Tony through their job, but Harry wasn’t sure about Happy.

“Feels like a long ass time,” Happy grinned. He had a friendly enough grin, with little lines around his mouth and crinkles beside his eyes. In fact, when he wasn’t screaming in Harry’s face and threatening to call the police, he was a friendly enough looking bloke.

With the added, and apparently rare, benefit of not being an Avenger.

“We met back in Malibu, I actually saved his life, and then he offered me a job.”

“What?” Harry screwed up his eyes to stared hard at Happy. “You saved his life?”

Happy smirked, “Before he was Iron Man, he was just a brilliant asshole who liked to drive drunk and wreck cars. He got in a wreck, and I happened to see it. I yanked him out before the whole damn thing exploded, and he laid there on the ground, drunk and panting and covered in blood, and you know what he said?”

Harry lifted a brow.

“He said ‘I owe you my life.’ And I said, ‘I don’t want your life, just quit driving like an idiot’ so he told me why don’t I drive him around instead?”

“Like a chauffeur?” Harry asked. “And you just took the job from this bloke you didn’t even know?”

Happy tilted his head back against the tree and laughed loudly. “Kid, everyone knew Tony fucking Stark. And since my life was pretty shit, and Tony seemed like a guy who paid good, I accepted it. We did my hiring paperwork while he was in the hospital and I drove him home. I’ve worked for him ever since.”

“That’s mad,” Harry said. He grabbed the tennis ball that Joey nudged and rolled to him and threw it again, grinning slightly when the little guy ran as fast as he could toward it. “Why was your life shit?”

“You ask a lot of questions for a kid who doesn’t like to talk about himself.”

Harry shrugged, just as content to sit in silence as he was to hear about someone else’s life. Actually… no he wasn’t.

“I’ll tell you one thing if you tell me about your shit life,” Harry said as soon as he realized that silence meant listening to his own thoughts surrounding the MACUSA meeting the next morning.

“Yeah?” Happy turned so he could face Harry. “Alright, deal, kid. Let me think… Oh! I know, what’s your favorite video game?”

Harry blinked at the easy question. He only knew one. “The racing one,” he said slowly. “I’m not very good, but it’s fun to drive fast, I suppose.”

Happy grinned and dug the half-gone, unsmoked, cigarette in the dirt. “You’re definitely Tony’s,” he chuckled. “So I used to be a boxer, right?”

Harry subtly scooted backward. Dudley had been ‘a boxer’ and his favorite punching bag was Harry.

“But I lost every damn fight I entered.”

Oh. That was okay then.

“So just when I was thinking about quitting, getting ‘a real job’, probably with the police department, Tony Stark went and offered me a job? Hell, I was pumped, kid. I knew it might be boring, driving some rich guy’s limo around? But the first night I took Tony out, he hit on some guy’s wife, and the guy comes out, all pissed and huge, and I just stepped in, got him with a right hook, and knocked him out. First fight I won in years, and Tony gave me a raise the next morning after I drove the woman home.”

There… there were so many parts of that story Harry didn’t understand. He focused on the important bit though.

“The woman was married and still went home with Tony?”

Happy raised his brows. “Didn’t he sleep with your married parents?”

“Yes,” Harry scowled at the ground. That was… that was so weird. “You wanted to be a cop?” he asked instead. “Someone—

A death eater in disguise.

—told me I’d be a good cop.”

“Yeah?” Happy caught Joey when the little traitor went and leapt up on his lap. He ruffled Joey’s ears and grinned down at the lovable pup. “I thought about it, figured I might be decent at it, but the thing is, cops are expected to put their lives on the line for everyone, every day. Now, me? I don’t mind to take risks for my friends, for the people I love, but for some random Joe Schmoe? Probably not. Not everyone’s meant to be a hero. Ya know?”

Harry thought about that. Not everyone had to be a hero. In fact, for heroes to even be special, there had to be average people. And Harry had never wanted anything more than to just be normal and average.

“Happy, that’s… that’s oddly inspirational.” Harry cleared his throat, “For a failed boxer turned limo driver, anyway.”

 

Tony was in the kitchen when Harry, Happy, and Joey got back upstairs, Harry had assured Happy no less than a dozen times that Hedwig would find her way back when she felt like it.

“My favorite son,” Tony cried. He had a white apron on top of his jeans and tshirt. An apron he carelessly wiped his hands off on. “I hope you’re hungry because I’m starving.”

“And cooking?” Happy asked, giving Harry a sideways look as he mouthed the word ‘Run’ as he turned his back to Tony and flopped down on the same recliner he’d been in earlier.

Harry remained in place by the kitchen entrance, shifting from foot to foot. He actually had no idea what kind of changes last night had caused and now it seemed like everything was off-kilter. Was he supposed to apologize? Insist he take off before Voldemort can follow him to Tony’s life? Should he—

“You lose your phone?”

“What?” Harry blinked and shook his head, trying to focus on the current conversation instead of his tangled thoughts. “No, I’ve got it?”

“Huh.” Tony swore suddenly and flicked the stove off, drawing Harry in to see what he was making that had that much smoke coming from the pan. “Macaroni,” Tony explained when he saw Harry standing on tiptoes by the counter trying to see the stove. “I sent you a text to see if you liked it, but it’s not going through. Thought maybe you dropped it last night.”

“No, it’s just…” Harry steeled himself. “It’s broken, I think. I’m sorry, I didn’t do it on purpose and I don’t know what happened and I can pay you back for it—”

“Woah,” Tony held his hands up and shook his head. “Breathe. Why don’t you go grab it, I’ll send Happy out for something edible, and I’ll take a look and see if I can’t fix it?”

Harry felt his neck heat up at his own rant and nodded shortly. He tried to open his bedroom window while he was in there, give Hedwig a place to come back to when she got tired of flying, and frowned when it wouldn’t open.

“Thanks,” Harry muttered when he brought Tony the phone and saw that Happy had already left. “I- I didn’t ask, but… but my owl, Hedwig—”

“Is perfectly welcome to stay,” Tony murmured. He sat at the kitchen bar and pulled a slim case full of tiny tools from his pocket. “Let’s just see here…” he pursed his lips while he flipped the phone around and tried to click it on. “What’s happened to you?”

Harry assumed he was talking to the phone.

“Thanks,” Harry said again. “She likes to fly though, so could you maybe show me how to open my window so she can come back inside? Otherwise she’ll be locked out.”

Tony looked up from the phone to Harry and his eyes were thoughtful. “No,” he said, shocking Harry. “I can’t open your window, kid, no offense, but I’d rather not test the net on this tower by you jumping.”

Harry felt his entire face burn red hot. “I’m not—”

“Aht.” Tony held up a hand, causing Harry to take a step back. “Will she come back inside if we open one of the living room windows?”

Harry glanced toward the wall of windows in the sitting room and shrugged. “Yeah, probably,” he mumbled.

“Perfect. Let me just pop this baby open, see what’s going on here, then I’ll… what the hell?” Tony used one of the tools from the kit he had to pull the back off Harry’s phone, sending out a puff of rancid smelling smoke.

“Did you drop it at all?” Tony asked Harry. He used one of the hook looking tools to pull out what probably used to be a battery but resembled more of something made of melted goo.

“No,” Harry said quickly. “I swear, I didn’t drop it, I just… I…” Harry nearly smacked himself. He did take a shuffling step backward, nearly tripping over Joey who had been sitting by his feet. Harry didn’t even think of it, but… but he’d accidentally apparated with muggle technology right in his pocket. “I’ll pay you back for it,” Harry said nervously. “I think… I think I broke it, last night.”

“How…?” Tony looked up from where he’d been digging in the melted inside pieces of the phone to squint at Harry. “Oh! Magic isn’t good for electronics, is it?”

“Not… not really, no.”

“But…” Tony’s eyes looked glazed as he stared over at the wall. “But if apparation can ruin electronics, why did your stunner not impact any of the household tech? Jarvis!”

“Yes, sir?”

“Full system report.”

Harry fidgeted as there was a buzzing going through the entire flat. How pissed was Tony going to be if Harry’s—

“Wait! You called it apparation?” Harry narrowed his eyes at Tony. “Are you…?”

“Incredibly handsome? Yes. A genius philanthropist? Also yes. In contact with your godfather who misses you and explained magical concepts and history to me this morning? Correct again,” Tony smirked.

“What all did he tell you?” Harry asked. He backed up some more until he could take Happy’s abandoned chair and clenched his hands together on his lap while he stared at Tony.

“Enough for me to be jealous,” Tony quipped. “Hold that glare for a minute, Jarvis! Report?”

Harry scowled down at his lap, actually rather irritated. There wasn’t anything to be jealous about, magic was as much of a burden as it was a gift.

“There appears to be no deficits, sir,” Jarvis said. “Would you like me to run it again?”

“No, thanks.” Tony had a thoughtful and familiar look on his face as he tapped the skinny hook tool to his chin and stared at the wall. “Is it because there’s more tech in here, harder to destroy, or…” Tony glanced down at his chest. “Is it the arc reactor energy? Or is it…”

Harry was bewildered as Tony suddenly leapt to his feet and took off toward his office.

He got to his feet as well and glanced toward where Tony went then decided he had the same look on his face as Hermione did when she ran off to the library. A look like that usually meant a genius at work and Harry would just be in the way. Plus… Plus he should probably actually read the letter from his friends, see what they sent after weeks of silence.

Harry sighed and moved to his room, digging for the letter from his friends that Hedwig brought with her. He grabbed the scroll and moved back to the sitting room, spreading across the sofa, and slowly unrolled it.

    H,
    If you’re reading this, please, please, write back. We’re all worried sick and terrified. We understand if you felt like taking off was your best option, it probably is, but please, just let us know that you’re alive. Snuffles keeps leaving, trying to find you. Molly cries every time she hears your name. And we’re so scared for you. We aren’t going to try and convince you to do anything you don’t want to do, we just want to know you’re alive. You’re probably furious with us, that this is the first letter we’ve sent, but it wasn’t by our choice and we can explain more another time if you’ll just write back.
    Please be alive and safe and able to write.
    We love you,
    -Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Gred, and Forge

That… that hurt, surprisingly.

It wasn’t that Harry didn’t think that his friends liked him, or missed him, but… but what would have happened if Tony hadn’t caught Harry last night? If Harry died in New York while his friends sat in London and wondered what happened to him.

Harry plucked Joey up from the floor and held him (he was not cuddling his dog) while he reread the letter. He paused at the bit about Sirius leaving the house and snorted; dramatic prat was probably just running around London, stretching his legs, and pretending to look for Harry.

Or, more likely, having more bloody secret meetings and conversations with Tony. Harry had no idea what the two of them were doing, Tony trying to help Sirius clear his name and Sirius telling Tony about magic, but he wasn’t entirely sure he liked it.

Harry sighed and tucked the letter in his pocket. “What d’you think Arsehole, huh? If they didn’t write before now because Dumbledore told them not to, then can I really trust them to not tell him if I write back?”

Joey didn’t respond, because the lazy little pup had fallen asleep.

“I guess we’ll see what happens tomorrow,” Harry mused quietly to himself. “No need to write any letters if I’m just going to prison anyway…”

 

Harry laid on the couch quietly with Joey for a while until Happy came back with bags loaded with food.

“Where’s your dad?” he asked as he heaved the bags up on the counter.

“Office,” Harry said. He looked at the clock on the fall and realized it was actually about dinner time. “Oi, isn’t it Sunday?” he asked Happy.

“All day long,” Happy chuckled.

“I thought that the others always came up here on Sunday’s for dinner?”

Happy paused as he had been unloading what looked and smelled like burgers and chips from the bags. “Not tonight,” he said, annoyingly vague. “Why don’t you go tell your dad there’s food here?”

“Why not?” Harry asked, ignoring the request that seemed to just be an excuse to end the conversation.

Happy sighed and shrugged his shoulders. “It’s not my business, kid, I don’t ask questions. Your dad said that Clint’s being a prick and they weren’t coming up tonight, that’s all I know.”

Harry hummed and gently laid Joey on the floor so he could get up. “I suppose I’ll just ask Tony,” he said.

Except when he walked in Tony’s office, he immediately got sidetracked.

“Okay, but if I send you some tech, can you walk around your house, maybe shoot some spells at it, see what happens? Oh, hold on,” Tony stopped pacing behind his desk and turned to Harry, “what’s up?”

Harry looked at the stacks of books and notes and little pink sticky notes that now covered Tony’s giant desk. “Who are you talking to?” he asked, bewildered.

Tony pointed to a black earbud that Harry hadn’t noticed. “Sirius, you wanna say hi?”

“No,” Harry scowled. Of course Tony would be talking to his new best mate. “Happy said to tell you he’s got food.”

“Excellent, thanks, Harry. Hey, Sirius, listen, I think I’m on to something but I need you to do your part, okay? So just look for a package in the next day or two, try and apparate with it, and then call me. Cool? Alright,” Tony laughed and Harry’s confusion and irritation skyrocketed. “Yeah, I’ll tell him, bye.”

Tony clicked a button on the earbuds and grinned. “Arc energy, Harry, it’s the only difference between the two!”

Harry nodded slowly. “And that’s supposed to mean something to me?”

“It’s why the phone melted but nothing inside the house did,” Tony explained. “Come on, let’s eat and I’ll explain.”

Harry wanted to ask about Sirius, he wanted to ask about Clint, but instead, he listened as Tony discussed different forms of energy with terms that Harry couldn’t begin to hope to follow. It was a decent distraction though, listening to Tony talk. He did a lot of talking with his hands, waving his food around, and he had a fervent light in his eyes as he went on about something that was obviously important to him.

And, since Tony had done nothing but help Harry recently (surprise adoptions notwithstanding), Harry tried to follow along and understand it all.

“So you think because the arc reactors are immune to magic influencing it?” Harry asked curiously when Tony stopped to breathe.

“Exactly, kid!” Tony nodded eagerly. “And now I’m wondering if I can just put on my suit, go find this Voldemort, blow him to pieces, snag the Rat-man, and call it happily ever after.”

Harry choked on his food and struggled to clear his airway for a moment. “What?” he finally gasped after he was able to breathe again. “Bloody hell, what all did Sirius tell you?”

“Everything,” Tony said simply. “And don’t think we won’t be discussing you traveling back in time to fight a werewolf and a bunch of soul-sucking dementors. Do you know the scientific improbabilities of magic? It follows no logic, no laws of the universe, nothing! It’s- it’s insane!”

“It’s freaky,” Harry said bluntly.

“Nah, I think it’s cool,” Happy said. He’d finished eating in record time and had taken up a spot on the sofa, content to play on his phone while Tony talked about energy and electricity and magic. “Makes more sense to just be born magic than building a million dollar super suit to try and mimic it.”

“Hey, I resent that implication,” Tony said, pointing at Happy. “My suit cost way more than a million dollars. And you,” he swung his finger to point at Harry, “as soon as I figure out how to block magic sensors without blocking your magic, I want to see everything you can do.”

Harry narrowed his eyes. “Without a wand? Not a damn thing.”

“So where’s your wand?”

“Sirius has it.”

“Why?”

Harry smacked the table, feeling his anger boiling over at just… just everything. “Why do you care?” he demanded. “Why are you talking to Sirius? Why aren’t you upset that I’m a wizard? Why aren’t you pissed I broke that phone? WHAT IS EVEN GOING ON HERE?!”

Tony didn’t look phased by Harry’s rant, unflappable as always, he just took a long drink from the soda Happy brought with their dinner while he considered Harry thoughtfully.

“Hey, Hap, call it a night,” he called over to Happy.

Happy looked up from his phone. “You sure, boss?”

“Yeah. Oh, hey, open one of those top windows on your way out, will ya? Hedwig needs an open window.”

Happy muttered something about birds and bird-lice as he drug a chair over to the wall of windows and opened a very top one.

Harry sat with his arms crossed, full of irritation and probably irrational anger, while he waited for Happy to leave and Tony to explain what the hell was even happening.

Finally, Happy left and Tony looked at Harry.

“You’ll have to explain what you’re upset about, I’m a genius, not a mind-reader,” he said with a sarcastic grin.

“You’re just- just fine with magic?” Harry asked him. “Nobody normal is ‘fine’ with magic!”

Tony tapped his chest where the glowing reactor laid beneath his shirt. “I’m not exactly ‘normal’, am I? Hell, one of my best friend’s turns into a Hulk when he’s pissed off, what’s a little magic when I’ve seen aliens and met Gods before?”

That… Harry hadn’t actually considered that. Aliens and Gods were a hell of a more ‘unnatural’ than magic.

“What all did Sirius tell you?” Harry asked, changing the subject a bit. “About- about magic, and me, and stuff…?”

“Everything,” Tony said. He stretched his legs beneath the counter, leaning his chair backward, and frowned. “I might know more magical history than I do non-magical, but Sirius is a good storyteller when he wants to be.”

“He told you about Voldemort?” Harry asked.

“Yup.”

“And about me?”

“Yup.”

“Then you’ll be wanting me to leave?” Harry asked, cursing Sirius in his head. Why would he send him away, ensure they couldn’t live together, if he was just going to ruin Harry’s chances of staying where he sent him?

“What?” Tony’s chair hit the floor on all fours and he looked surprised. “Not even a little bit, kid, why would I?”

“Maybe your new best mate forgot to mention it, but the last two people who stood between me and Voldemort are dead,” Harry said flatly. “If he finds me here, he will kill us both.”

Tony didn’t look concerned in the slightest, he waved his hand in an arrogant way. “If he tries, then I’ll just see which is worse- a crazy wizard who tried to kill my kid or the God of Thunder and Magic Hammers. I like Thor’s odds, really, but hey you can place your bets on the crazy wizard if you want.”

“I…” Harry shook his head and narrowed his eyes. “So you know everything and you still don’t want me to leave? What the hell is wrong with you?”

“I’m cursed by being a wonderful parent,” Tony sighed dramatically. “Honestly, kid, I’m hurt that you thought magic and wizards was going to scare me away. Were you ever planning on telling me?”

“No,” Harry said bluntly. “And next time you talk to Sirius, you can tell him I’m pissed that he did.”

“You could tell him yourself,” Tony said cheerfully. “We can replace your phone tomorrow, I can hook it up to the system here, find a way to make it work on the go, then you can call Sirius and he’ll quit whining to me about how much he misses you.”

“That’s assuming I’m not in prison tomorrow,” Harry scoffed. “I did break the law, you see.”

Tony waved that off as well. “I break the law all the time and never go to prison and you won’t either. What d’ya say? If you don’t go to prison tomorrow, which you won’t, will you call him? Let him explain why he sent you here?”

“Tricked me into moving, you mean,” Harry corrected him.

“Tried to protect you,” Tony countered.

“I don’t need protected,” Harry said irritably. “I need- needed… not tricked,” he finished lamely.

“Look,” Tony sighed and leaned on the counter, propping his chin in his hand, “I’m going to be sappier than Happy on Valentine’s Day real quick then we can go do something totally manly like burp and play xbox, okay? But this whole thing you’ve got going on, saying you don’t need anyone, fuck the world, etc, etc, I get it. Hell, you probably get it from me, but Sirius loves you, I care about you, you’ve got friends that miss you, and you’ve got new friends here that care about you. You and I are a family, kid. Like it or not, you’re stuck with me. So let’s just deal with MACUSA tomorrow, replace the phone, call your godfather, and figure out how to be the most perfectly abnormal family to ever exist, alright?”

Harry shifted in his seat, anxious and embarrassed. “You don’t think I’m mad?” he asked as he began ripping tiny shreds of his napkin apart on the counter.

Harry came with an entire suitcase full of problems. And it was as if that suitcase had sprung open last night, exposing everything for Tony to see. The fact that Tony didn’t seem to mind was uncomfortable because either he was entirely mad (a true possibility) or he actually liked Harry, which was uncomfortable to consider.

“Harry,” Tony waited until Harry glanced up at him, “I think if I had been through all the shit you have, I would have jumped off a roof a long time ago. You’re not crazy, you just need some help to get through it. Alright?”

Harry shrugged and clenched his jaw hard, annoyed at the sudden prickling sensation in his eyes.

Tony cleared his throat, ending the awkward silence. “Since it’s Sunday, which means it’s family night, you get to pick; do you want to get your ass kicked on the Xbox again or see why Lord of them Rings is the greatest cinematic masterpiece to ever be released?”

Harry smirked, relieved at the change in topic. “I thought the Breakfast Club was the best movie ever?”

“Top of my list,” Tony said seriously before winking, “but I think you’ll like Gandalf and I need you to tell me if any of it is real because I’ve always wanted to meet a hobbit.”

 

Harry stayed awake for approximately an hour into the first movie, scowled as poor Frodo Baggins was forced to be some sort of Chosen One by a manipulative wizard with a long white beard, and then promptly fell asleep when Frodo met a little guy that reminded him of Dobby.

 

Tony finished the first movie, then snagged a couple of blankets, tossing one of Harry and keeping one for himself, before settling back on the couch, perfectly content to sleep out in the living room with his son for the night.

*****

“Can I… can I use your phone real quick?“ Harry asked Tony as they stood outside the building where MACUSA was stationed the next morning. He regret eating even the couple of bites of muffins that Pepper brought them for breakfast as he was certain he was moments away from throwing up right on the sidewalk.

“Sure.” Tony handed him his phone and leaned against the light post. “I’m not letting them take you to prison, you know, so no ‘farewell forever’ texts.”

“Right,” Harry said skeptically. He opened Tony’s messages and typed a quick one to Sirius, just in case.

Miss you, Pads.

“Here.” Harry gave him back his phone and took a deep breath, squaring his shoulders and lifting his chin. “Let’s get this over with, hmm?”

“Let’s try to be optimistic here,” Tony said as he held the door open for Harry. “If they try and arrest you, then we’ll just run off and you’ll finally get to see Russia.”

Harry looked at Tony’s entirely serious face and felt his upper lip twitch just a bit. “Perfect,” he drawled. “They don’t extradite to the United States either, you know.”

Tony laughed, his laugh echoing around the posh lobby they stepped into. “Smartass,” he said fondly.

Harry tried to hold his smirk as they approached the tall wooden desk with an older woman seated behind it.

“Good morning, beautiful,” Tony greeted the woman with a smile and a wink. “My son and I are here for a meeting with President Quahog?”

“Of course.” The woman batted her lashes at Tony and gave Harry a simpering smile. “He’s been expecting you, if you’ll both just follow me…”

She got down from the desk and led Harry and Tony down a hallway to the left of the lobby. “Right in here, gentlemen.”

She knocked on a large, gleaming, wooden door and smiled at them after someone called ‘Enter’.

“Good luck, gentlemen,” she smiled.

Tony looked down at Harry, “Ready?”

“Nope,” Harry deadpanned as he reached down to open the door.

Tony chuckled and they stepped inside the office together.

The first thing Harry noticed was the giant American flag that hung across the back wall of the office, giving the man sitting at his desk an incredibly odd background. The desk itself was large and had two plain wooden chairs in front of it that Harry assumed they were meant to sit in.

“Mister Harry Potter-Stark and Tony Stark!” The man got up and leaned across the broad desk toward them, offering his hand first to Harry then to Tony. He was… well, he wasn’t what Harry expected. He was tall, for one, and had salt-and-pepper hair brushed neatly on his head above almond-shaped blue eyes. He wore a muggle suit, a simple and black suit, not unlike one Tony had been wearing when Harry first met him, and he had an easy smile on his face as he greeted them.

“Please, sit,” he said after they each shook his hand. “My name is President Quahog and I am delighted to meet you.”

Harry was not delighted to meet him, so he settled for a nod and sat down a second after Tony did.

“I, for one, am thrilled to be here,” Tony said brightly. “I’ve always wondered, is there a secret magical government inside the Manhattan Building, and it seems as if I were right.”

The President fixed Tony with a wide smile. “Well, you’re certainly no stranger to secret government organizations, are you, Mister Stark?”

“No stranger at all,” Tony agreed. “Except, in my experience, those secret governments typically reveal themselves in times of crisis. Not that we’ve had any recent crisis that could have used some magical assistance… Oh, wait,” Tony leaned back in his chair and shook a playful seeming finger at the President, “we did.”

Harry knew Tony was a mad bastard, but Merlin he had bollocks.

The President didn’t seem offended though, he just laced his hands together on his chest and leaned back with an indulgent smile.

“We prefer to not interfere with no-maj wars,” he said. “It’s helpful when we wish to avoid the Salem Witch Trials repeating themselves.”

“Of course,” Tony said, “why help avoid a war if it means risking your safety?”

“Why indeed,” the President agreed. He turned toward Harry, apparently choosing to end the conversation there, and smiled. “Would you care to explain what happened yesterday morning around approximately 0330 to have set off so many bouts of wandless magic?”

Harry glanced at Tony out of the corner of his eye and saw his tiny nod, so he tried to explain in a way that didn’t make him sound like an idiot.

“I, er… I was arguing with this bloke and—”

The President held his hand up for Harry to pause and checked a paper in front of him. “‘This bloke’ meaning Director of SHIELD, Nick J Fury?”

“Yes. Sir,” Harry added quickly. There was a time and a place to be a prat, this wasn’t one of them.

“Understood, go on.”

“Well… I er… I didn’t mean to hurt him, but he was talking—”

“Being incredibly rude in Harry’s own home,” Tony cut in.

“Right,” Harry said slowly. “And it wasn’t on purpose, I just… I just stunned him, I think.”

“Quite so,” the President said. “And then?”

“And then…” Harry tried to remember the details. “I just… I ran and the door was locked and I wanted it to open so I guess it did—”

“I made a poor choice to lock the doors,” Tony interrupted again. “That was on me.”

The President smiled slightly at Tony, more amused than anything, and inclined his head. “Understood. Go on.”

“And then… I was running, trying to get away—”

“From whom?”

“What?”

The President cleared his throat and fixed his eyes on Harry. “From whom were you running from? I understood that Mister Nick Fury was still quite unconscious.”

“Er…” Harry fidgeted, feeling extremely stupid.

“Me again,” Tony said with a grimace. “You might have missed it, as you enjoy hiding from conflict, but my son was kidnapped by a death eater, saw his classmate die, was tied to a tombstone, and forced to participate in a ritual to bring Voldemort back to life before he had to duel for his life. Understandably, there’s some lingering PTSD there. It was another poor decision on my part to chase him.”

There was nothing weirder than hearing Tony talk about Voldemort and death eaters. The shock of those words coming from his mouth actually covered the pang of remorse at hearing about Cedric’s death again so casually.

“Gentlemen,” the President was definitely amused now as he looked between where Harry was picking at his nails and where Tony was sitting back entirely at ease, “I believe there’s a misunderstanding here we should clear away. Mister Potter-Stark is not in trouble for accidental magic, there is no need for the defensive measures. We rarely see cases of accidental, wandless, magic that did not happen due to extreme duress. And, as Mister Stark is important to the no-maj world, Mister Potter-Stark is important to ours. It would be remiss of me to not ensure that Mister Potter-Stark is safe within his home.”

Harry’s jaw actually dropped. “But… but I did magic? Underage magic in front of muggles?”

“Accidental magic under psychological duress,” the President waved an airy hand. “And, as Mr Fury is already aware of our existence and Mister Stark is your father, you did not violate the Statute of Secrecy either.”

Harry blinked and felt caught off-guard. “I’m- I’m not in trouble?” He’d been so certain that he was going to be arrested, sent to prison.

“Certainly not,” the President said. “I do apologize if you thought you were. I oftentimes forget how strict the British can be.”

“Wonderful,” Tony said brightly while Harry sat there, gobsmacked. “So then we’ll just get going!”

“Actually, there is another concern I would like to speak with you both about,” the President said, causing Harry to snap his jaw shut as surely his punishment was about to happen. “I have received a letter from Minister Fudge, informing me that as of Saturday, June 18th, at 0600, Harry Potter was reported as a missing person. If he is found, the British Ministry of Magic require that he be returned to England.”

“It would be difficult to do that, considering Harry is my legal, biological son,” Tony said. “I’m sure you’re aware that it’s actually illegal to kidnap a child.”

“Truly, Mister Stark, I wonder why you think I would stoop to such lows?” The President shook his head and kept up his polite smile. “As you’re no doubt aware, I am a professional.”

“I’m aware of a lot of things,” Tony said with his own polite smile. “I’m aware that you have a muggle parent, you went to Yale, not as impressive as MIT, but respectable, you have weekly meetings with Barrack—”

“Barrack?” Harry asked, cringing under the sudden stares of the two men.

Tony leaned back in his chair and crossed one leg over the other knee. He winked at Harry, “Old golfing buddy of mine, President of the muggle US. If you think I brag, you should hear him after nine rounds.”

Riiiight.

Tony looked back at President Quahog and Harry realized this must be how Tony runs his business too. It didn’t matter that the President was the one who set up the meeting and sat behind the desk, Tony was controlling it. He controlled it with his casual posture, his easy jokes that carried some sort of weight to them, and the way he looked just slightly condescendingly amused by everything the other man said.

“Anyway, the point was that I don’t think you can just deport my son without Barrack having a problem with it,” Tony told the President. “I can call him though,” Tony pulled out his phone and pulled up an image hovering in the air of himself with a dark skinned man with a golf club, “we can see what he thinks about the illegal deportation of a minor American citizen.”

“Mister Stark,” the President leaned his elbows on the desk and steepled his fingers beneath his chin, “you misunderstand me once more. I said that the British Ministry of Magic is searching for Harry Potter and would like for us to inform them if we find him in our country.”

Harry slumped in his seat, ducking his head and wishing he were invisible.

“Aah.” Tony didn’t sound bothered, which actually made sense, because it didn’t make sense for Tony to even want Harry to stay in the first place.

“Well, if my son or I see this elusive, and probably rather handsome, ‘Harry Potter’, I will personally call your cell. You do have a cell, right? Because the British wizards are still using sheepskin parchment, which is both disgusting and more outdated than my buddy Steve.”

Harry’s head snapped up at the President’s soft chuckle. “What?” he blurted out, feeling dim. “Er… you’re going to lie to Minister Fudge for me?”

President Quahog fixed Harry with a polite smile. “Certainly not. I would never lie to my delightful, if tacky, British counterpart. I told him if I found Harry Potter that I would tell him, and I will.”

Harry didn’t want to look away from the man who was going to sail him back across the ocean, but for someone who spent so much time acting like he didn’t want Harry to leave, Tony wasn’t even pretending to care now.

“Kid,” Tony smirked at him, “got your wallet?”

Harry kept his eye on Tony as he slowly pulled the slim black billfold from his pocket that Tony got him when he bought Harry clothes.

“You have your ID in there?”

“Yeah?”

“Read it out loud for the class,” Tony said airily. He raised his brows and held his smirk as Harry pulled the little plastic card from his wallet.

Glancing quickly at the President, Harry looked down at the card that had his name, photo, and Tony’s address on it.

“Harry James Potter-Stark, 200 Park Avenue, Manhattan, New York City—”

“Precisely, Mister Potter-Stark,” the President interrupted him in a warm and friendly tone, as if they were two friends sharing a joke. “I can tell Minister Fudge, with a clear conscious, that I have not seen hide nor hair of Mister Potter. It is unfortunate, but perhaps he simply isn’t in our country.”

Harry’s jaw practically hit his chest as he clutched what was apparently a lifeline in his hand. “You- you’d do that for me, sir?”

“Harry, may I call you Harry?”

Harry nodded dumbly. If he wasn’t sending him back to England to die at the hands of Voldemort, he could call him ‘boy’ for all Harry cared.

“Harry, we Americans have never been known to take orders from the British.” The President held his hand out across the desk to Harry once more, “Welcome to America, home of the free, land of the stubborn.”

“Amen,” Tony said solemnly as an incredibly bewildered Harry shook hands with the President of MACUSA once more.

Notes:

    As logical and good of a dad as he is, Tony’s really just as emotionally repressed as Sirius and Harry are.
    They’re just three little beans with shitty pasts trying to move on together (well, 2/3 of them are) and I think that’s lovely.
    Thank you all for the comments, kudos, and support. As always, I couldn’t do this without you.

Chapter Text

Thursday, June 23

“What’s the plan for the day, kid?” Tony asked when he breezed in the kitchen and saw his son sitting at the counter, fidgeting with the new and improved StarkPhone he had.

Harry scowled down at the counter. “Depends, am I still on fucking suicide watch?”

Apparently Harry thought that he was just going to go bungee jumping without any cords and Tony was going to act as if it never happened. No offense to him, but Tony was surprised that it took Harry until the day before to realize he was purposefully not being left alone at any given moment.

“Depends, are you going to go see the therapist that Pepper worked so very hard to find for you?” Tony asked him. He opened the fridge and grabbed a gallon of milk that passed the sniff-test before snagging a box of cereal from the pantry.

“I said it was an accident and I don’t need a bloody therapist,” Harry said. He got up and grabbed two bowls and two spoons before sitting back down.

“That’s called denial, my feisty friend,” Tony told him. He poured himself a bowl of cereal and slid the cereal and milk to Harry’s preferred spot on the opposite side of the bar. “You call your godfather yet?”

Tony knew he hadn’t. In between learning all he could about magic, being told stories about the insane life his son led, and getting bitched at for Harry’s stunt on the roof, Sirius had also spent a lot of their recent phone calls wishing Harry would talk to him again.

“I’m not sure that’s your business,” Harry said in his little snappy way.

“Wrong again,” Tony sang. He took a few bites of his breakfast while Harry made himself some. “Write back to your friends?”

“Again, I think that’s my business.”

“Are you going to decorate your bedroom?”

“Am I being blackmailed?” Harry snapped, throwing his hands in the air. “I can’t be left alone until I follow some mad checklist you’ve built for me?”

“Don’t be ridiculous,” Tony said around a mouthful of marshmallows, “you can’t be left alone until you do things that make me think you want to live your life.”

“That still sounds like blackmail,” Harry said with adorably angry eyes.

Tony shrugged, perfectly content to blackmail his kid into doing things that Pepper insisted were ‘healthy habits’. God bless that woman, she’d been a godsend the last few days. As soon as Tony was certain that the wizard government wasn’t going to try and interfere with his kid, he’d caught Pepper up on everything she missed since Saturday afternoon and she jumped straight into planning mode.

She’d been at their place by the time they got back home on Monday, a stack of books in her bag, a list of child therapists in her pocket. She told Tony that Harry probably had depression, that he didn’t have any ‘meaningful connections to give him reasons to want to live’, or some other psychological mumbo-jumbo that meant Harry needed more support in his life or he was going to end up in a lightweight coffin before he hit college.

In Tony’s opinion, everyone needed a Pepper Potts in their life.

“It’s emotional blackmail,” Tony said cheerfully. “I’m willing to remove your protective detail (Happy and Pepper when Tony had to leave his kid alone) as soon as you’re willing to work with me.”

Harry glared at the counter as he angrily chewed, a hilarious reaction, really, Tony didn’t even realize someone could chew Lucky Charms so angrily.

“I can’t write back to my friends because they might tell Dumbledore where I am. I’m not calling Sirius because he’s a traitor. And I’d like to go to a mall with Gwen and Peter today, but I’m not going to drag along a babysitter,” Harry said with a sneer.

All fair points. Even if Sirius had worked in Harry’s favor, done the right thing and sent him to safety knowing he couldn’t follow him, Tony could see why Harry felt betrayed by him. From what Sirius said, Harry had been on his own since the day Lily and James died until Sirius tried to insert himself in his life. And, according to Sirius, he’d had to work nearly as hard as Tony currently was, to get the kid to accept him. So, yeah, Tony could see why a kid would be upset by the rational decisions of an adult.

“You can definitely go to a mall with your friends without a babysitter, IF you take your credit card, buy stuff you like, and promise to decorate your room,” Tony told Harry.

“Excellent, because as you know, since you’re an expert in magic now, I definitely have a credit card linked to my bank account,” Harry drawled sarcastically. “Best Buy accepts galleons, right?”

Tony grinned and pulled a card from his shirt pocket with a dramatic flourish. “This is yours, actually, here,” he flipped the card across the counter to Harry. “Go buy stupid teenage shit with your friends.”

“This is your money and I don’t want it,” Harry said, flipping the card back to Tony. “I told you I’m not suicidal, I don’t need bribed or blackmailed into living.”

“You’re my kid, so it’s our money,” Tony insisted, flipping the card right back. “I’m not bribing you. Kids get allowances, right?”

Harry scoffed and toyed with the card before giving it back. “No.”

“Quit being stubborn.”

“Says the stubborn git insisting I spend his money on ‘stupid teenage shit’.”

“Touché,” Toby grinned. “Look, it’s up to you. You can spend the day with Happy while I go deal with our dramatic tower-mates, or you can take the damn card, buy one thing that makes me think you’re putting down roots here, and ‘hang out’ with your new friends.”

Tony smiled as Harry looked like he was grinding his teeth to dust. Poor kid was going to need to see an orthodontist at some point.

… and probably a pediatrician. Kids were a lot of work, actually. And weren’t they supposed to be prone to germs and disease?

“This is blackmail and bullshit,” Harry said through his clenched jaw. He got to his feet and pocketed the card that Tony had ordered for him. He stormed over to the sink, washed his bowl and spoon, and stormed to his room. “I am going to pay you back when I get access to my account,” he yelled before dutifully leaving his door partially opened.

“If you try then I’ll cry,” Tony called at his back. “Hey, do you want a ride?”

“No. I do not ‘want a ride’, I want one bloody normal day!” Harry yelled back.

Tony laughed and finished off his own bowl of cereal. It wasn’t actually funny, that Harry couldn’t see the irony, but Tony had been pretty certain that teenagers arguing with their parents was about as normal as anything.

 

The ping he got on his watch, reminding him that he had a meeting with his team in an hour regarding ‘recent developments’ was not so normal. Well, Clint being a drama queen was normal, but calling a whole meeting for it wasn’t.

 

After verifying Harry’s plans with him (‘We’re going to the mall and perhaps finding insane ways to waste your money’, as if Tony was worried about how much money Harry spent, he’d be lucky if the kid spent $5), Tony set off to Steve’s floor for a ‘team meeting’.

“Hello, my favorite team,” Tony cried as he joined them, ten minutes late and the last to arrive. He looked around Steve’s boring and plain apartment with a wide smile, “Love what you’ve done with the place, I can really get a sense of your character here, Steve.”

Bruce chuckled, but he was the only one at the round table that they all sat at who did. Clint had his head bowed just enough to hide his face, Natasha looked bored by his side, and Steve had on his ‘serious face’.

“Have a seat, Tony,” Steve said, ever the chivalrous hero.

“Mm, I’ll stand, thanks,” Tony said. He leaned against the archway that separated the dining/meeting area from the living room and attempted to look as bored and unimpressed as Natasha did. “If you’ve got ridiculous concerns or baseless accusations, get them out now.”

He knew they did. He knew it since Fury must have woke up Sunday morning and told Clint or Natasha, who told the rest of the team, that Harry was a wizard. As soon as he started getting a flurry of messages from the rest of them, he knew that they would see it as ‘a problem’.

“Can he control minds?” Clint asked immediately, causing Tony to roll his eyes as hard as he could.

“Does my fourteen year old kid who doesn’t even carry a wand have the same level of mind-fuckery powers as a God with a tesseract?” Tony scoffed and crossed his arms, “Yeah, Clint, clearly. Next.”

“Now wait a minute, that’s a fair question, Tony,” Steve said calmly. “He knocked Nick out cold, how do we know he’s not dangerous?”

“Have you seen the kid? He looks like a scared kitten half the time,” Natasha said, which was both insulting and totally accurate.

“Why did he attack Fury?” Bruce asked Tony. “All Fury told Clint was that he tried talking to Harry, finding out what the situation was, and that Harry ‘attacked him’.”

“First off, Harry didn’t ‘attack him’, it was accidental magic because of high stress levels,” Tony said, repeating the words of the wizard President. “Fury broke in my place, middle of the night, and threatened to tell me Harry’s secrets. And since the last people the kid lived with hated magic, the kid got panicked and stunned Fury before he took off.”

“So he’s just going to be shooting magic at everyone the moment he feels stressed?” Clint asked, glaring at Tony like a pissed off little kid.

Tony rubbed his forehead, feeling a headache building between his eyes. “Did he ‘shoot magic’ at Natasha when she shook him? No. It was an accident, Clint, he’s not any more dangerous now that you know about his magic than he was before.”

“What about this…” Steve rifled through an actual folder in front of him to snag a sheet of paper from it. “This Voldemort character? Fury said that it’s almost a guarantee that he’s going to come for the kid.”

“He shows up, I blast him to bits, we all go out for ice cream to celebrate,” Tony shrugged. “I’m not seeing the problem here, guys. We took on Loki, and won, I didn’t think Earth’s mightiest heroes would be scared of a little fourteen year old wizard.”

“We can’t fight magic,” Clint said stubbornly. “If the kid goes dark side, then he’s just got inner access to all of us. He can fuck with our minds, mess with whatever he wants, and- and—”

“And try and take over the world?” Tony asked innocently. “That was Pinky and the Brain’s gambit, Clint. Harry’s too busy cuddling puppies, feeding bacon to owls, and you know, dealing with all his trauma to really take over the world anytime soon.”

Once again, Bruce was the only one who chuckled. Bruce was a good guy, better than the rest of the stick-up-the-ass teammates they had. Not nearly as fun to banter with as Harry was, but Tony doubted if many people outside of himself could match the kid for levels of sarcastic wit.

“How’s he doing, anyway?” Natasha asked. She kicked her feet up on the table, smirking at Steve’s little exasperated sigh, and turned to Tony. “Heard he took a short dive off a tall building Sunday morning.”

Tony wasn’t even surprised that Natasha already knew about it. It wasn’t that Tony was keeping it a secret, necessarily, he just didn’t feel the need to tell his team while he, Happy, and Pepper had it handled.

“He what?!” Clint’s eyes bulged and he turned toward Tony so quick that his own neck muscles winced in sympathy. “What happened?”

Tony raised his eyebrows at Clint mockingly. “Oh, I’m sorry, are you worried about my evil little wizard son? I thought you’d be happy if he’d hit the ground and was no longer a threat to you.”

“He jumped off a building?” Steve asked with shocked eyes while Clint sputtered a denial. “Jesus, Tony, what happened?”

“Fury happened,” Tony snapped. “He showed up after Harry’s perfectly awkward date, provoked Harry into using accidental magic, then the kid panicked and took off. He thought I’d kick him out or beat him or something else fucked up if I knew he was a wizard, maybe even accuse him of being evil,” he added with a pointed look to Clint. “He got upset, found himself at the top of a tall building, and wanted to be done with shit. And I’d think that all of you,” he swung his finger at the four of them, “could be a little more sympathetic and less accusatory.”

Bruce nodded, his eyes reflecting true sorrow for Harry in the way that only Bruce could. Steve looked appropriately embarrassed as he hopefully realized what a sham it was to call a meeting over the threat level of Tony’s own son. Natasha picked at her nails with a knife, like a psycho. And Clint was frowning in either deep thought or serious constipation.

“I just don’t want to have to hurt the kid if he turns dark side,” Clint finally said, breaking the tense silence filling the room. Well, tense for the others, Tony was mostly just bored and annoyed.

“And I wouldn’t let that happen,” Tony said with another roll of his eyes, leaving them free to interpret that however they chose. If they thought he meant he wouldn’t let Harry turn ‘dark side’, so be it. Bruce’s knowing look told him that he read the true meaning in his words though; Tony wouldn’t let Clint hurt a single hair on Harry’s head.

“If that’s all then, I’ve got actually important things to do today,” Tony said cheerfully when nobody said anything for a moment. “Anyone who isn’t scared of my kid should come over for dinner tonight, we’re going to be out of town this weekend.”

“Where you going?” Bruce asked curiously.

“And what’s for dinner?” Natasha asked.

“None of your business and whatever Harry wants,” Tony quipped. “Oh, and in case this wasn’t clear, Fury isn’t invited and I’d rather not see his charming face around until he’s ready to apologize to Harry. And don’t think Harry’s going to accept flowers and pretty poetry,” he told Natasha, knowing she’d be the one to report back to her boss, “genuine heartfelt apology or he can take me off his emergency contact list, got it?”

“Oh, I’ll definitely tell him that,” Natasha smirked.

“Terrific, I’m off then. Dinner’s at six, don’t be late,” he called over his shoulder as he strolled right back out of Steve’s apartment.

Honestly, he thought it would take a lot more to convince Clint that Harry wasn’t like Loki. But maybe the differences between a fourteen year old kid and a God from Asgard were obvious even to Clint. Either way, if they weren’t going to freak out over a bit of magic, then Tony would be relieved to have his friends back. God knew he’d need at least Bruce’s help to kill the wizard who had a vendetta against Harry.

Speaking of which…

Tony sent Harry a text while he rode the elevator down to the board meetings he couldn’t just send Pepper to.

Having fun?

 

Tony was playing catch with himself during a finance meeting, bored out of his mind, when he got a text back.

I bought Hedwig a perch. Does that get me off suicide watch?

Tony chuckled and ignored the disproving looks of the older staff members in the room. They never liked Tony’s clothes, the way he rarely showed up to meetings, or the way he thought a smoky scotch made dry pitches much more tolerable. Laughing at a text was the least of Tony’s offenses in their eyes.

Buy a poster.

Of what?!

Metallica? Gandalf the Grey? Topless women on a motorcycle?

You’re disgusting.

Tony grinned and checked the bank account he linked Harry’s card to and saw the kid only spent $22.

I thought you and your friends were going to waste our money?

I did. I bought Hedwig a perch. Have you tried reading? It should improve your comprehension.

Tony laughed again and waved off the dirty looks from the stuffy suits in the room.

For every dollar out of a thousand that you don’t spend, I’m adding that as a day to have Happy hang out with you.

This is blackmail and I’m certain it’s a crime.

Tony felt an odd, unfamiliar, and not entirely comfortable feeling in his chest. He hadn’t even known the kid for a month, but there it was…

“Holy shit,” Tony slapped his hand on the board table, causing the suits to jump in their seats. Tony looked around at them all with a shocked smile, “I think I love my son!”

“Congratulations, sir,” one of the older suits said as he pushed his glasses up on his nose. “Shall we postpone the meeting for this remarkable revelation?”

“Nope.” Tony waved his hand and picked his phone back up. “I’m not listening anyway.”

They suits scoffed, but Tony was still having a moment so he ignored them. It was remarkable, actually. Besides his mom, Tony wouldn’t say that he loved anyone, necessarily. Liked? Sure. Had a use for? Absolutely. Loved? No.

But… yeah. Tony was mostly confident he loved his kid. Which was terrifying, actually, because it opened a whole can of personal worms he’d rather not examine too closely.

He sent a text to the two people who would understand this breakthrough the most.

I think I love my son.

Pepper sent back a little emoji rolling it’s eyes, Sirius sent back a bunch of question marks.

Okay, maybe nobody understood his breakthrough.

We still on for this weekend? Tony sent Sirius.

He chose to interpret the salt shaker and crane he got back as confirmation.

If I buy a $8 shirt, is it still okay if people come over to your house?

Tony grinned at his son’s text. If there was ever a time to blackmail him into putting down roots…

Buy paint for your bedroom, call it ‘our’ house, and you can have a party tonight for all I care.

…

Fine. But I’m buying red and gold and making it as painfully obnoxious as you are.

Gryffindor colors? Perfect. Maybe I’ll paint mine blue and bronze since I’m obviously a Ravenclaw.

Tony assumed that the length of time it took Harry to respond, when the finance meeting ended and the marketing one began, was him working through his shock that Tony knew yet another thing about his son’s world that he thought he needed to keep hidden.

Which reminded him to schedule a meeting at Grunning’s for Monday morning…

Paint is expensive and I like white.

Nobody besides Steve likes white. You don’t want to base your fashion aesthetic on Steve, trust me. Just buy some paint, some t-shirts, whatever, and you can do what you want tonight.

Tony got up and stretched, ignoring even more disgruntled looks, when Harry text back a very irritated seeming ‘K’.

“Good meeting, guys,” Tony told them all with a cheery smile. “Unfortunately, it’s five o’clock, so we should all call it a day and head home.”

A young, and new, suit coughed quietly. “Sir? It’s two thirty?”

“Five o’clock in Paris,” Tony said.

“I believe it would be eight thirty in Paris,” he said hesitantly, missing the amused looks of his more experienced coworkers.

Tony grinned at the man, “What’s your name?”

The guy abruptly looked nervous to have Tony’s complete attention. “Davidson, sir. William Davison.”

“Well, William Davidson, do you have kids?”

“Uh… yes, sir, a newborn daughter.”

“Then you should take the rest of the day off, go home, hug her, come back fresh tomorrow, alright? Good talk, I’ll see you guys next month.”

Tony whistled his whole way back to his lab. He figured he had roughly thirty minutes before someone tattled to Pepper and he’d better use the quiet time productively.

 

And he did. He worked on the security system for the StarkCar for eight and a half minutes before moving on to the only project that could currently hold his attention.

“Oh, baby, that’s beautiful,” Tony murmured after he opened the box of electronics Sirius sent back to him and began pulling them out. Sirius had even utilized the sticky notes Tony sent, and each piece had a note on it.

‘Apparated with it’, for the melted TV remote.

‘Three stunners and a petrifying jinx’, on an arc reactor powered smart watch that was still in perfect working condition.

Tony sent off a quick text, asking for clarification between a stunner and a petrifying jinx.

‘Ask Harry’, was the smartass reply he got back, quickly followed by a ‘I’m actually not sure. One leaves you awake, one doesn’t’.

The rest of the little common household items followed the same trend. The ones Tony built to run off the clean energy source he used for his home, his suit, and all his toys, were in perfect condition. The ones that were built to run off solar energy or batteries were destroyed.

“Amazing,” Tony breathed as he made notes for each item and the results of the tests ran on them. He ignored the ping from his phone that flashed Pepper’s name, this was another breakthrough.

Sirius told him that ‘muggle’ electronics couldn’t survive contact with magic, it fried their systems, but if this all meant that the arc energy, based off the Tesseract which probably carried magical properties, was compatible with magic then it could open the door to the 21st Century for witches and wizards.

And, after all he learned about his son and his triumphs and struggles and his life as ‘The Boy-Who-Lived’, Tony wasn’t an idiot. The wizarding world would come knocking for his kid one day, which meant every advancement Tony made for the magic world would be an advancement for Harry.

“Mister Stark?”

Tony paused his notes, a packing list of tech to bring with him that weekend, and held the pen poised to continue if it wasn’t anything important.

“Yes?”

“Mister Harry is home, sir. He has a guest as well.”

“Oh.” Tony put the pen down and checked the time. “Thank you, Jarvis. Can you ask Harry what he wants for dinner?”

“Certainly, sir.”

Tony carefully packed away his notes after transferring them to his email. He put the electronics back in the box, placing them in a cabinet with Harry’s broken cell phone.

“Sir? Mister Harry said he doesn’t care.”

“Of course he did,” Tony rolled his eyes. “Ask him if his friend is staying for dinner. Oh! And who is it?”

Jarvis was quick, he was back within a minute. “He said if you don’t mind, sir, and his guest is Mister Peter Parker.”

Tony stopped his cleanup long enough to grin. “Perfect, Jarvis, go ahead and order a bunch of stuff from that Chinese place and ask Steve to pick it up on his way.”

“Very good, sir.”

Tony waited to go upstairs long enough to send a text to his team—

Harry has the skater boy up for dinner tonight. Steve’s getting Chinese. See you all soon?

Clint was the first to respond—

Wouldn’t miss it. I’ll bring my bow.

For a guy who acted like Harry was a bad headache away from taking over the world, Clint didn’t seem to like the idea of Harry having his ‘just a friend’ over for dinner.

Tony whistled cheerfully the entire way up to his floor.

You only got to interrogate the kid who flirts with your son once. Well… Tony could probably swing it three or four times, five of Natasha got involved, but he could only do it for the first time once.
Notes:

    Up Next:
    A very awkward ‘family dinner’.

    PS: if you’d like to join a Discord that’s mostly for another WIP I write, but has its own LS&MH channel, feel free! It’s where we gossip about the characters, I ask questions about MCU canon, and we build headcannons and theories about the characters. 😌

Chapter 21: “Bisexual, at a minimum.”
Notes:

    I plan chapters out, then sometimes there are twists I wasn’t expecting. Like I said before, I mostly just give characters a backstory and personality, let them loose in the little world I’ve designated to them, and follow them around and take notes. I can’t be held responsible when they don’t follow the script.

    Enjoyyyy. 😉

Chapter Text

Thursday, June 23

“Man, you really suck at this,” Peter laughed. He dropped the controller he held, carefully not hitting Joey who was curled up on his lap, and threw his hands up victoriously. “I win! One hundred points to team nerds!”

“You cheated,” Harry grinned, only mildly annoyed to be so bad at video games. It was less annoying to lose to Peter, since he looked rather pleased with himself when he won.

“Me? Sir, I would never!” Peter cried. He waggled his brows at Harry when the screen asked if they wanted to play again, “Ready to lose again, Stark?”

Harry scoffed, “That sounds bloody weird to hear,” he told him. He got up and nodded his head toward the kitchen, “Don’t press start, I’m grabbing a drink. Do you want one?”

“Sure, thanks.” Peter scratched Joey’s head, making him wag his tail happily, while Harry went to get drinks. “Is it weird being called Stark because of the whole kidnapping and surprise adoption or because your name’s on a building?”

Harry laughed as he dug in the refrigerator, rooting past the bags of vegetables that Pepper kept bringing that just went bad on the shelves for water. “Both,” he admitted.

“I mean I can come up with a nickname for you, if you want,” Peter called. “How do you feel about Bright Eyes?”

Harry bit back a curse as he abruptly hit his head on the shelf.

“Brilliant,” he grit out, snatching two bottles of water and closing the fridge. He went back in the sitting room and tossed one to Peter before resuming his seat on the floor beside him. “Then I’m calling you either American Idiot or Gold Eyes.”

Peter laughed again, the gold in his eyes popping as they crinkled at the sides. “My eyes are brown.”

“They’ve got little gold flecks in them,” Harry said absently. It took the little surprised look in those gold-flecked eyes for Harry to realize what an incredibly daft thing that was to say to a friend. He and Ron certainly never sat around discussing the color of each other’s eyes. “Er… another round?” he asked quickly, hoping to move past his horrible lapse in judgement.

Peter smiled Harry’s favorite lopsided smile. “Yeah, alright,” he agreed. He turned back to the telly and clicked the start button. “Hey, Bright Eyes?”

Harry hummed and forced down the hot blush he could feel building on his neck. That… that didn’t seem like something that Ron would ever call him. The twins? Maybe. Except the twins didn’t count really because were mad and said mad things all the time (Fred had even asked Harry to the Yule Ball as a particularly cruel prank before). But… but Peter was a friendly bloke. Harry counted his (admittedly few) blessings that his embarrassing and rather painful crush on his friend wasn’t obvious, since he doubted if Peter would come up with such a nickname if it was.

“You’ve got gold flecks in your eyes too,” Peter said as the screen counted down. “Just so you know.”

Harry grinned, relieved that he wasn’t as blatantly obvious as he thought he might have been, and then they began racing again.

Peter laughed when Harry’s quick little yellow car went flying past his on the mud covered landscape they were racing on. “Now who’s cheating?”

“Not—”

“Evening, gentlemen.”

Harry swore under his breath when Tony stepped off the lift and caused him to wreck his car into a lake.

“Kid, you are really horrendous at that game,” Tony said. He offered Peter his hand when Peter abruptly paused the game and got to his feet. “Tony Stark, you must be the kid that my kid is always going on about.”

Harry’s jaw dropped. Did Tony truly just come up and the first thing he did was say something that was both entirely untrue and horribly embarrassing?

Peter grasped Tony’s hand and turned to grin at Harry, “Always going on about me, huh?” He turned back to Tony before Harry could sputter out a denial, “Peter Parker, sir.”

“Oh, none of that ‘sir’ nonsense,” Tony said, waving the hand that Peter just released airily. “Iron Man or Harry’s dad work just fine.”

“Or annoying git,” Harry said with a innocent smile. “That’s what I call him.”

“Tony works just as well too,” Tony told Peter. “You boys hungry? Steve’s bringing dinner and the others are grabbing the table and chairs.”

Harry blinked as he processed that mortifying information. “I thought you were fighting with them?”

“Hmm? Fighting? No,” Tony said with an annoying amount of vagueness as he wandered toward the kitchen. “We had a silly disagreement, Clint being ridiculous as usual, but it’s all cleared up now.”

“Right,” Harry said skeptically. He scooped Joey up as he began whining and got to his feet reluctantly. “We’re going to take Arsehole outside…” he gave Peter a pointed look until he got the hint and followed him.

“Your dad seems nice,” Peter said as they got on the lift together.

Harry gave him an exasperated look. “He’s not,” he said deadpan. “And his friends are bloody annoying.”

It wasn’t until they were back on the way up that it must have dawned on Peter who Tony’s friends were.

“The Avengers,” Peter suddenly gasped, sounding choked and nervous. “Harry, your dad’s friends are the Avengers.”

Harry sighed when the lift doors opened and he saw the table had been setup in their fifteen minute absence. Tony was sitting at the far end, the red headed psycho beside him in a ridiculous amount of skin-tight leather clothes, the other assassin on his other side with what looked like bloody arrows strapped to his back. Bruce sat beside the psycho and Steve sat beside Clint, leaving three chairs open.

“The annoying Avengers,” Harry muttered to Peter. “If the redhead attacks you, I’ll shoot her.”

Peter looked torn between laughing or wailing as he looked at Harry’s entirely serious face, but then Tony called for them to come sit, so he did neither. He did hesitate though when Harry chose the chair that had an opening on either side of him and Peter had to choose between sitting beside Steve or Bruce.

“We don’t bite,” Tony told him just before Peter sat between Harry and Steve. “Bruce does, but only when he’s very angry.”

“He’s kidding,” Bruce told Peter with a polite smile. “I mostly just smash things.”

“Alright then,” Peter said with a good natured grin that Harry didn’t share. “So just don’t make you angry?”

“No, I think you should,” Tony said seriously. “It’s important for you to meet the whole family, Pete, and the Hulk is my second favorite member.”

“His name is Peter,” Harry said, narrowing his eyes at Tony.

Harry had no idea what was going on with the impromptu dinner and Tony calling Peter ‘Pete’, but he didn’t like it one damn bit. He liked it even less when he could hardly start acting like a prat right in front of his friend.

“Hey, why don’t we eat?” Steve offered loudly, breaking the silent glare off between Harry and Tony. “Peter, you like Chinese?”

“Oh, yeah, thanks,” Peter said with a grin. He grabbed one of the bags of food and started helping Steve pass containers out to everyone. “Thanks for inviting me,” he added politely when everything had been handed out.

“We didn’t, the kid did,” the psycho said, instantly causing Harry to bristle.

“And as this is supposedly my house, I’m wondering who invited you?” Harry asked her coolly, liking her less and less every time he saw her.

“None of that ‘supposedly’,” Tony said, pointing his fork covered in noodles at Harry. “You invited your crew, I invited mine.”

“We make a pretty small crew,” Peter told Harry with a crooked grin.

“I like our odds,” Harry scowled. Then he tried very hard to not scowl as it was Tony and his idiot friends that were irritating and not Peter.

“So, Peter, tell us about yourself,” Bruce said after everyone silently ate for a few blessed minutes. “Where do you go to school?”

“Oh, he goes to Midtown High; top three percent of his class, honor roll, debate team, does the photography for the yearbook, and he’s only had detention three times in his high school career.”

Harry and Peter both stopped chewing to stare at Tony. Peter, in incredulous shock; Harry, in a furious rage.

“Did you do a bloody background check on him?” Harry demanded.

“Of course,” Clint scoffed, speaking up for the first time instead of just shooting dirty looks at Peter. “If he thinks he’s going to be hanging around, then we needed to know more about him.”

“I wasn’t talking to you,” Harry snapped. He tried to calm down at the curious look Peter gave him, but he suspected he still sounded annoyed. “Tony, why?”

“I don’t mi—”

“Like Clint said,” Tony interrupted Peter, “if he thinks he’s going to be hanging around my favorite son, then I needed to know he wasn’t a threat.”

“Or we’d have to get rid of him,” the psychopath murmured.

“You I certainly wasn’t speaking to,” Harry scowled at her.

“Ten points from team psycho,” Peter whispered, winking at Harry and clearly remembering how Harry had described Tony’s friends.

“Oh, are we playing points?” The psycho perked up and smiled sharply at Peter. “Fifteen points from team geek for showing up to meet his boyfriend’s family in tacky clothes.”

Everything about that statement was so incredibly wrong that Harry wasn’t sure where to start or if it would make him look like a prat for doing so.

“Hey! Don’t blame the geeks because of Pete’s bad taste in bands,” Tony cried.

“Harry likes this band,” Peter told Tony and the psycho with a fearless grin, not even addressing the other bit.

“We are not dating,” Harry denied hotly, embarrassed and mortified and wishing that he had a different roof to jump off of. “And Tony paid for the bloody shirt, I’ve got the same damn one on under my jumper.”

It had been stupid, but funny, when Harry, Peter, and Gwen all bought shirts for the band they liked and immediately put them on to wear while they shopped. It had reminded Harry of Christmas with the Weasley’s in their similar Weasley sweaters and the way Gwen insisted on taking photos, so the psycho could piss off.

“Did I pay for it or did we pay for it?” Tony smiled.

“You.”

“Did you spend $1000?”

“That wasn’t a joke?” Peter whispered.

“Told you so,” Harry told Peter before lifting his chin stubbornly at Tony. “We spent exactly $1001, so I owe you $1.”

“How the hell did you spend over a thousand dollars in a mall?” Clint asked around a mouthful of chicken.

Harry shared a smirk with Peter. “We didn’t, we spent it in a skateboarding store next to the mall, which still counts,” he told Tony quickly.

“Do you know how to skateboard?” Steve asked curiously.

Harry didn’t. Even with Peter’s help, he was crap at it. He was determined to learn how though so that the next time Peter was skateboarding around town, Harry could go with him.

“And how does a board with four wheels on it cost a thousand dollars?” Bruce asked.

One board with four wheels didn’t, but two skateboards were bloody expensive. But Peter helped Harry pick one out, so Harry insisted on buying him a new one as well, explaining that if he didn’t spend the money that he’d apparently be grounded (he wasn’t explaining the babysitter bit) because Tony was a mad man with mad rules. Then they bought the shirts, the paint for Harry’s bedroom, and lunch to make sure that Harry spent exactly $1000 and Tony couldn’t blackmail him any longer.

“Nope, no questioning the kid on what he spent his money on,” Tony told the others firmly. “As long as he spent it, I don’t care if it was on hookers and blow.”

Peter laughed while Harry clenched his jaw and Steve sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose.

Harry put his fork down, trying very hard to not slam it, and subtly pulled his phone out of his pocket to send a text.

“Mister Stark, ‘favorite son’ said—”

“Jarvis, what the fuck?!” Harry yelped, interrupting the robot from apparently reading his bloody message to the group. He could feel his face burning in utter mortification as everyone turned to look at him with various expressions of curiosity on their faces. Except Peter, Peter had his head ducked and his shoulders were shaking with the effort to keep from laughing right in Harry’s face.

“Why is Jarvis reading your texts out loud?” Harry asked Tony.

Tony quirked a brow at him and seemed annoyingly at ease. “Why are you sending secret texts at dinner?”

“He’s talking shit about skater boy,” Clint said.

Steve gave his teammate a severe look. “It wouldn’t exactly be polite of you to point it out if he was, would it?”

“I wasn’t,” Harry said hastily when Peter turned his head enough to look at Harry. Peter’s eyes had never sparkled as much as they did while he was biting his lip to refrain from laughing, which wasn’t exactly a helpful thought to have. “I was asking a perfectly normal question.”

And he’d apparently have to find out what blow was another time.

Peter winked and took a sip of his drink before calming himself and looking at Tony. “Do you have more than one son?”

“God, I hope not,” Tony shuddered. “Imagine having to track two sets of son’s and their boyfriends, it would be exhausting.”

“So then Harry’s your favorite and least favorite son?” Peter asked him, ignoring the same comment that the psycho made earlier.

Harry wondered if perhaps Tony was trying to irritate him enough to accidentally do magic now that he’d decided to learn as much about it as possible. It seemed far fetched, but he’d seen him poke Bruce with a fork multiple times during Monopoly once with the intent of seeing him ‘hulk out’.

Harry smirked and nodded in agreement with Peter. “That’s what I said, isn’t it? He thinks it’s bloody amusing.”

“Everything I do is amusing,” Tony said smoothly. “Speaking of which, Pete, you like movies? Harry’s never seen any of the Lord of the Rings, isn’t that wild?”

Harry looked up at the ceiling and willed himself to simply fall over dead.

“No way,” Peter said. He shook his head at Harry, “I knew England was a terrible country, but to not even have the Lord of the Rings movies?”

“I saw part of one of them,” Harry said, shooting Tony an irritated look while Clint and the psycho started whispering to each other. “Some poor bloke gets a shitty job from a manipulative old wizard? Let me guess, it ends with Frodo getting killed by the bad guy?”

“Nope, no spoilers,” Peter said firmly. “I’ve got the entire set at home, you’ll have to come over and watch them.”

“Yeah?” Harry grinned then abruptly scowled when the psycho started snickering. “What is so bloody funny?” he asked her.

If Harry couldn’t fall over dead, he kind of wished she would.

“Nothing,” she said, smirking at Peter in her irritating way that made Harry want to be more violent than he typically did. “It’s just an adorably nerdy date, isn’t it? Lord of the Rings and chill?”

Harry opened his mouth to tell her that it wasn’t a date, but Peter spoke up before he could.

“I mean, no offense, but it’s not like we invited you.” He shrugged casually and smiled at her after popping a piece of the weird (but brilliant) crab rangoon in his mouth.

Harry made a mental note to look up the word date and see if it meant something different in America the way that crisps and pants seemed to.

“You think we need invited somewhere to show up?” Clint asked Peter. “I know precisely where you sleep.”

“Why would you know that, Clint?” Bruce sighed. “Peter seems like a perfectly—”

“He’s got blue sheets with dinosaurs on them.”

Harry looked down at the table and blinked very hard to repay Peter back for not laughing at him earlier by not bursting into snickers then and there.

“Dinosaurs are cool,” Peter said. His cheeks were a little red, but he didn’t seem nearly as horrifyingly embarrassed as Harry was. “And stalking is a crime,” he added.

“We’re the Avenger’s,” Tony said dismissively. “Nobody’s going to believe you over something as silly as stalking.”

“I told you they were the villains,” Harry told Peter solemnly. “They beat up those poor aliens, now they’re stalking you, you’re probably not safe anymore.”

“You’re right,” Peter agreed, just as serious as Harry. “You and Joey will have to come home with me, we can stay up in shifts, keep each other safe.”

“Have Gwen expose the Avengers for their crimes in the paper?” Harry asked.

“Precisely,” Peter nodded. “We’ll have Joey keep track of their crimes, Hedwig can mail it off to Gwen—”

“Like I couldn’t shoot a bird from the sky.”

Harry stiffened and turned slowly from Peter to Clint and fixed him with the deadliest look he could muster. “If you ever aim an arrow at my owl, I will kill you,” he said softly. “Slowly, painfully, and with as much damage as humanly possible.”

The flash of what seemed like actual fear in Clint’s eyes was heartening, as Harry was fairly confident that Clint could kill Harry in an instant.

“Wow, this has been fun,” Bruce said, once more breaking the heavy silence. “But, boy look at the time, guys, we should get going…”

“What? It’s family night!” Tony said, crushing Harry’s dreams of not dealing with his friends any longer. “We said we’d teach Harry how to play poker!”

Harry inhaled and exhaled very slowly, very carefully, ensuring that he didn’t actually start a screaming match in front of his friend who was probably never going to speak to him again regardless.

“I thought you guys did that on Sunday and you didn’t do it last Sunday because Clint is a drama queen?”

If Harry thought that Clint would be offended and storm out of the flat, leaving Harry with only a few more people to get rid of, he was disappointed.

Clint stabbed a piece of chicken especially aggressively and grinned at Harry, “Like I’m the only drama queen here, kid.”

“That’s it.” Harry slapped his hands on the table and got to his feet. “This has been delightful, honestly, I’ve never been so pleased to see all your lovely faces, but if I’m no longer grounded,” he glanced at Tony hesitantly and received a tiny nod of affirmation, “then Peter and I have plans.”

“We do?”

“We do,” Harry told him. “It’s… er…”

“Painting your room!” Peter said, getting to his feet as well. “I almost forgot that I promised to help you!”

Harry meant something that got them out of the house, but that worked too.

“Kid, we can have someone else paint your room,” Tony laughed. “It’s a huge room.”

“So?” Harry shrugged and grabbed the plates he and Peter used so he could wash them before he hid in his room for what would possibly be the rest of his life. “I’m good at painting rooms.”

“Now I see why you joined the art kids,” Peter said as he easily stood next to the sink and rinsed the plates Harry washed. “You have the soul of an artist, my friend.”

Harry laughed and sprayed his arm with the water. “I actually suck at drawing and painting, think I failed the bloody class when I was seven, but I had a cousin who had a different favorite color every month and I painted his room.”

“You should’ve just done it in rainbows the first time, then he couldn’t complain,” Peter said. Harry cringed slightly, imagining the fallout that painting Dudley’s room rainbow colored would have been. “And, don’t laugh, but my bedroom is still half pink and half white. It was my aunt’s sewing room when I moved in and it just never got painted.”

“Really?” Harry grinned at him and turned the sink off once they finished with the last of their few dishes. “We’ve got plenty of paint, if you want a red bedroom.”

“Harry, red is my favorite color.”

“You said it was green at the party?”

“That was old Peter,” Peter said haughtily. “New Peter loves red.”

Harry had hoped they could just slip past the dining room, not receive any more annoying comments from the most annoying group of ‘heroes’ in the world, but Harry was the unluckiest bastard to ever live.

“Hey, Harry?”

Bruce was the least annoying of Tony’s friends, so Harry had given him the benefit of the doubt by pausing before continuing on to his room while Peter snatched Joey off the couch.

“What?”

Bruce grinned up at him, “What’s your favorite color?”

Harry couldn’t see how that was a trick question, so he answered truthfully. “Red.”

The five ‘adults’, and Harry was incredibly skeptical of how they earned such a title, immediately began snickering.

Harry hoped the look he gave Tony accurately portrayed the fact that he would be texting Pepper and complaining about him encouraging Harry to invite people to his house only to make him look stupid in front of them. Pepper said any time that Tony ‘really messed up’ he should text her, and Harry normally wouldn’t be so pathetic to resort to tattling, but he’d hardly retaliate directly and endure a punishment for it either.

“If you need us for the rest of the evening, week, month, year, kindly don’t,” Harry told them all, rolling his eyes for emphasis, before gently shutting his door behind himself, Peter, and Joey.

“Bloody hell,” Harry groaned. He threw himself on his back on his bed, closing his eyes and ignoring the way Hedwig strut across the top beams of his bed, preening for their guest.

Peter plopped himself on the bed beside Harry, laying on his stomach with his chin propped in his hand. “I think this went great, Bright Eyes, I mean, sure, I’m being stalked by Hawkeye the Assassin, and Tony Stark knows my grade point average, but all in all I sort of expected more weapons or something when I met your family.”

“They aren’t my family,” Harry said, probably sounding like a dramatic prat. “They’re just…”

“Your biological dad, his best friends and fellow Avengers and the people you share a house with, kind of?”

“Yes,” Harry agreed, peeping one eye open to see that Peter’s face was incredibly close to his.

Peter’s lips twisted up in his typical half-smile, but his eyes were sparkling brightly. “I really hate to be the one to break the news, but that’s basically family.”

“I prefer being an orphan,” Harry deadpanned.

Peter smiled at that, his teeth perfectly white and straight and very close to Harry’s face. “You can come meet my Aunt May and Uncle Ben soon, then you’ll understand what being embarrassed is. You’re lucky your dad doesn’t have any baby photos.”

Harry laughed and pushed himself off the bed, determined to actually paint his room and not just waste the supplies. “Give him five minutes and he’ll make some,” Harry warned Peter. He offered him a hand up and felt warm and stupid when Peter squeezed his hand before dropping it. “C’mon, we’ll do my room today and yours next week when I get back from whatever mad plan Tony has for the weekend.”

“Aye, aye, captain.” Peter gave him a two finger salute and snatched up a paintbrush from the pile of supplies they’d stored in his room. “Do we paint in our ‘tacky shirts’ or remove them to preserve the tackiness?”

Since Harry was certain his entire neck was red at the thought of Peter taking his shirt off in his bedroom, and he felt sort of… skinny… and pale… compared to Peter, they kept them on.

 

They made a ton of racket as they moved furniture around, shifting heavy dressers and Harry’s bed away from the walls, and they were nearly finished with one wall when Peter had a brilliant idea.

“Music!” he cried, whipping his paintbrush around and splattering Harry. “Harry, you have a speaker?”

“Er… maybe? Hey, Jarvis?”

“Yes, Mister Harry?”

“That’s so freaking cool,” Peter muttered.

“If you can read private text messages out loud, can you also play music off my phone?” Harry asked Jarvis, still annoyed at his earlier antics.

“Yes, Mister Harry, shall I play ‘Peter’s Playlist’ on shuffle?”

It was as if every being, living or robot, in the flat had the sole purpose to make Harry’s face as red as his walls were becoming.

Harry scowled and turned to Peter quickly, “It’s the one you send me,” he said. “I- I didn’t name a playlist off you, or anything daft, I swear.”

“Fine, I guess I’ll delete my five Harry playlists,” Peter sniffed, he swiped at his face, as if he were crying, and managed to smear red paint across his cheek.

“You look like a prat,” Harry laughed.

“Oh yeah?” Peter’s typically easy-going smile turned mischievous as he aimed his paintbrush at Harry. “Take it back, Bright Eyes.”

Harry glanced around at the tarps they covered everything but the walls with and then lifted his chin with his own paintbrush raised. “Never.”

Peter pulled his paintbrush back and flung paint at Harry, hitting him directly in the chest with it.

Harry looked down at his now paint splattered shirt then up at Peter. “You’re on, Parker.”

Jarvis had music playing through Harry’s room as the two of them got in a vicious paint war that took no prisoners. Hedwig refused to participate, keeping to the ceiling and hooting in a disdainful sort of way for their childish behavior. Joey didn’t mind though, he leapt around, tangling himself in their feet, barking and howling and getting as covered as the two of them were.

“I give!” Peter finally cried when Harry had him cornered and his paintbrush dripping above his head. Peter was clutching his side, probably suffering the same stitch from laughing that Harry had, and he looked ridiculous as covered in red paint as he was. “You win! Your paintbrush is mightier than mine!”

“I knew it the whole time,” Harry scoffed with a grin. He almost lowered the brush, then Peter added, “Suck at Xbox though,” so Harry smeared a streak from the top of his head clear down to his nose.

“Yeah? Is that how you’re playing it?” Peter dropped his brush and swiped paint from his plastered fringe onto his fingers before leaning forward and smearing it across Harry’s forehead. “Now we match,” he said.

Harry blinked as Peter was so close that he could see each individual fleck of light in his eyes and every small freckle on his tanned cheeks that weren’t hidden by paint.

Peter didn’t seem to be in a rush to move either, as he slowly reached up and brushed his hand on Harry’s upper arm, undoubtedly leaving behind red fingerprint’s as proof that Harry hadn’t just snapped and began hallucinating.

“I’m going to do something really dumb,” Peter murmured, his lips moving but not making a lot of sense as Harry was distracted by his eyes. Harry definitely noticed his lips when Peter held Harry’s arm more firmly and pressed them to his own lips though.

Harry’s first thought while Peter kissed him was that surely a single person couldn’t possibly have this many fireworks exploding in their stomach. He felt like he was going to burst from the inside out; his heart was racing, his skin was on fire, and…

I’m gay.

Harry gasped a little and Peter pulled back quickly with wide eyes.

“Good gasp or bad?” he asked Harry.

“I…” Harry shook his head and was torn between asking him why he stopped and why he did it in the first place. He looked down at Peter’s feet and slowly moved up to stare at his face. “Am I gay?!” he blurted.

“Holy shit. I really hope so,” Peter said. He laughed a little and raised his hand, moving to run it though his hair, and as he did Harry realized how close they were standing and took an automatic step backward.

“Hey, I’m so sorry,” Peter said when Harry didn’t say anything else, busy internally panicking.

Was he actually gay?

Was Sirius right?

Was Peter gay?

“I… I’m gonna go, and we should still be friends if you’re not interested,” Peter said slowly. “Hey, I’m really sorry.”

“I’m not mad,” Harry said truthfully, forcing himself to not sound like a nutter in front of one of his only friends (were they friends? Did Harry have a sign on his back saying ‘I’m gay’? Did Peter pick up on Harry’s crush and was pranking him?). Harry looked around his room, taking in the wreck they’d made and opened and closed his mouth a few times while Peter watched him. “I’m… er… I’m just going to clean up and go to sleep,” he said quickly, finding a perfectly plausible, if rather lame, excuse.

“Want me to help? I should help.”

“No, it’s fine,” Harry said quickly. “I’m… er… I’ll do it.”

“Cool, cool…” Peter nodded his head and backed up slowly to the door. “I’ll just… uh… head home then. And I’ll talk to you later? Tomorrow? Or whenever?”

“Yeah,” Harry said, also nodding his head too earnestly and talking too quickly and avoiding eye contact. “I’ll talk to you later…”

“Right… bye then…”

“Bye.”

Harry waited until his door closed behind Peter to sink to the floor and bury his face in his knees. What was wrong with him? Sure, he’d suspected he was interested in blokes, but… but it wasn’t normal, it was just another freaky thing about him that he’d been told his whole life was wrong, and weird, and—

“Why did a teenage boy covered in red paint just race through our living room like he just stole the Holy Grail?”

Harry lifted his head enough to see Tony step in his room and then cringed that much harder as his room was covered in paint splatters.

Tony didn’t even look at the mess though, he just tilted his head curiously at where Harry was crouched on the floor in the corner. “Whatcha doin there, kid?”

Harry opened his mouth to tell him nothing, to tell him something to drive him right back out his door, and what fell out was, “Am I gay?”

“Bisexual, at a minimum,” Tony said without missing a beat. He stepped further in the room and pulled the door shut, “To keep Arsehole from escaping while he’s a hazard to the floors,” he explained.

“It’s… it’s weird, right? If someone’s interested in blokes and they’re a bloke?” Harry rambled while Tony sat down beside him, literally in a puddle of paint. “Is there something wrong with me? Do I have to ruin everything? Is it just some sort of freak gene—”

“Woah, slow down,” Tony said, sounding annoyingly calm. How could someone be calm in a moment like that?! “First off, don’t go insulting your genetics, you have a perfectly excellent set of genes. Also ‘freak’ is just an outdated term that small-minded people give to others who don’t fit in their little boxes.”

“I want to fit in a bloody box,” Harry moaned, putting his head back in his knees. “All I ever wanted was to fit in a box. I don’t want to be different. I want to be normal.”

“Why?”

Harry took a few long, deep, breaths before picking his head back up. He rested his temple on his knees and stared incredulously at Tony. “Why what?”

Tony didn’t look annoyed by Harry’s question or his whining. “Why would you want to be ‘normal’? And who says you aren’t normal anyway?”

“I…” Harry found himself momentarily speechless as he tried to sort through his own thoughts. He had always wanted to be normal to fit in with the only family he thought he had left. He’d wanted it ever since he was little and was capable of wishing for things like that. If he were normal, if he weren’t a freak, if he fit in the cupboard boxes, then… then his aunt and uncle would have liked him, loved him maybe, treated him kinder at a minimum. He would have had a nice little family like every other kid in the world had.

“My… my other relatives,” Harry said quietly, looking at the paint smear on the wall behind where Tony sat that looked like Joey’s tail marks. “They’re normal and- and I’m not like them at all.”

“Hmm.” Tony hummed thoughtfully and scooted back until he could carelessly lean his head back on the wet wall. “And if you were more like them, if you could just be the person they wanted you to be, then they’d tell you they loved you and you’d be a happy family?”

“Exactly.” Harry looked up at Tony’s face that held no sign of the pity or anger that he feared it would show. “How’d you know?”

One side of Tony’s mouth curled up in a mimicry of a smile. “I don’t know what your life was like, and I’m not going to pretend I do, but I do understand trying to live up to someone else’s expectation of ideal and feeling like you’re always falling short. And it’s a shitty feeling that could drive someone to, oh I don’t know, drugs and alcohol and beautiful company.”

“To- to falling off a roof?” Harry suggested, seeing where Tony was going with his story and feeling a little more like he used to when he had Sirius to talk to. Sirius understood too. Sirius knew how it felt to have a family that didn’t like you, thought you were a freak, didn’t care how much you wanted to be loved.

Harry wondered if Sirius missed him as much as he did.

“Nope, I think that’s caused by jumping,” Tony said glibly. “I think jumping off a roof could be caused by feeling like all the things that make you unique are somehow wrong, when they’re not.”

Harry looked back at the wall, even though it was blocked by Tony’s torso. “What if- what if I’m gay?”

“Harry, was James Potter a freak?”

Harry’s eyes snapped up to Tony’s face and he opened his mouth indignantly, “No, he was a good man.”

Tony raised his eyebrows. “Kid, you might have missed this with as much as I don’t bring it up to embarrass you, but James Potter definitely slept with a man, and I can provide further details if you need them.”

Harry bit the inside of his cheek and rested his head back on his knees. “No,” he said shortly. “I get it.”

“So why can James Potter kiss other men and not be a freak and you can’t kiss one awkward teenage boy and not be one either?”

Harry scowled and evaded the question he didn’t have an answer to. “He told you?”

“Who? Peter?” Tony laughed and Harry relaxed slightly. “God, no. Kid, when I tell you he looked as nervous as you are, I mean it. I even sent Happy after him to make sure he got home safely because if he tried to ride that skateboard I think he’d get hit by a bus.”

“How’d you know then?” Harry asked.

“You look like I did when I knew I liked making out with guys as much as I did girls,” Tony said, not sounding embarrassed in the slightest. “I thought my old man was going to kill or disown me, so I had a whole gay panic week— you’re doing great, by the way, I wrecked two cars and did a bunch of coke when I had my coming out of the closet meltdown— and I figured since your friend wasn’t exactly subtle about his horribly obvious crush on you, and he’s got excellent taste because you’re kind of excellent, so either he made a move or you did.”

Harry blinked at that long explanation. “Did he disown you?” he asked him.

“Nope. Until the day he died he pretended he didn’t notice that ‘Stark Swings Both Ways’ wasn’t a headline with some colorful photos every week in his Sunday paper.”

Harry snorted at the headline. “They used to call me the next Dark Lord.”

“Oh, yeah, I can see it now,” Tony held his hands up and moved them in a dramatic arc, “‘Dark Lord Harry Kisses Nerdy Boy from Queens!’”

“He’s not nerdy,” Harry scowled. He picked his head up and laid it back against the wall as well. “He’s smart, I’d think you of all people would appreciate that in a bloke.”

“He’s certainly not my type,” Tony said with a smirk. “Good kisser though?”

Harry felt a flutter of something in his stomach when he thought about the kiss. “Dunno, that was my first, wasn’t it? And I…” Harry closed his eyes and felt a new wave of complete mortification wash over him. “And I panicked and made him leave.”

“Hey, if he can’t handle a little bit of gay panic, then he’s not worth panicking over,” Tony said calmly. “Send him a message in the morning, see if he wants to go ride skateboards or kiss in the rain or whatever counts as an awkward teenage date these days when we get back next week.”

Harry hummed noncommittally and looked up at where Hedwig had hid above his bed for safety from the paint.

Harry… maybe he was interested in blokes, and since Peter was the one who kissed him, Harry had to assume that he did too, and- and maybe Tony didn’t seem to mind, and neither did Sirius (who bragged about sleeping with multiple classmates of his of both genders when he’d been in Hogwarts) and Harry’s parents probably wouldn’t mind- but…

“Is everyone related to me gay?” Harry whispered, his eyes going wide as he came to the sudden realization.

“Like I said,” Tony reached over and patted Harry on the knee, “bisexual at a minimum.”

Chapter Text

Friday, June 24

It had been easy, truthfully, to slip away from Grimmauld Place for the weekend.

All Sirius had to do was get drunk, or at least make himself look entirely pissed, throw the greatest tantrum to date, catch some curtains on fire, scream belligerently, cry, grab five bottles of whisky from the cabinets, and lock himself in his room.

It was so simple it was nearly insulting.

Well, he’d also had to do a complicated bit of brewing to get Remus’ cute little jinx off him, but it wasn’t likely he’d get through a whole weekend without Harry or Tony saying Harry’s name in front of him.

Sirius left Buckbeak a whole pile of chickens, packed a bag of his muggle clothes and some of Harry’s stuff from his trunk, slipped under Harry’s cloak, and that was that. Once he was sufficiently packed and prepared, he snuck down the stairs, eavesdropped on conversations until he was satisfied that the adults in the house thought he was raving mad and ‘best left alone’, and he left.

Straight from the dull street of Grimmauld to the posh and private plane with Stark painted down the side.

Sirius stayed under the cloak, as instructed by an incredibly bossy Tony, but he relaxed in one of the seats and helped himself to the drinks and snacks laid out in the cabin for him. He did wonder how peculiar Tony was to work for when the pilot closed the loading ramp and took off at the scheduled time, seemingly with an empty cabin.

Not that it was his problem, all Sirius had to do was relax, wait to land, and then have a heart to heart with his godson, assure him he couldn’t wait to have his name cleared and Harry’s safety assured so they could live together, and that was that.

Sirius picked up a grape out of a bowl, silently snickering to himself as the crew would surely notice the disappearance of the food and drinks. He popped it in his mouth and smiled to see the ocean flying by beneath him.

 

It was all so easy.

 

Sirius had dozed through the bulk of the flight, the easy rocking motion of the plane and the soft music playing through the cabin like a sleeping spell for him. He woke when the turbulence from landing jolted him and he got his first look at Tony’s ‘place in Malibu’.

Good Merlin. It was a bloody mansion- complete with a pool big enough that Sirius could see it from the sky and a landing pad for the plane he was in. If Sirius’ mother saw the type of place that Tony lived, she may have changed her views on muggles.

…no, she wouldn’t have, hateful woman.

But still, Sirius was practically giddy with knowing that his godson would get to spend vacations and getaways in places like this. God knew Harry deserved it after spending ten bloody years in a cupboard.

 

Tony was waiting in front of the door that led off the landing pad when Sirius disembarked from the plane. He looked just as casually attractive at forty as he did at twenty-five, dressed in his jeans, AC/DC shirt, and sunglasses. And, as Sirius lost his youth and good looks to Azkaban, he decided to take it out on Tony by sneaking up around him and screaming in his ear while covered with the cloak.

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Tony yelped, jumping away from where Sirius dramatically whipped the cloak off and likely glaring behind his silver mirrored sunglasses. “I have a heart condition.”

Sirius glanced at his chest where a faint glow emitted above his heart and smirked before looking around the area where they stood more carefully. “Where’s Harry?”

“Swimming,” Tony said shortly. He held a hand out, gesturing to the door. “Let’s get you settled and we can go either piss him off to Bruce levels of aggression or make his eyes go all warm and fuzzy.”

“Probably both,” Sirius quipped. He stuffed Harry’s cloak in the rucksack he carried over his shoulder and followed Tony as he led him through the door.

Sirius’ brows rose as Tony led him through the house. He was used to stuffy and outlandish pureblood mansions with thick drapes, heavy and antique furniture, and an overall sense of ‘rich’ to make him sick. Tony’s place screamed wealthy just as loudly as any manor did, but in an open, light, and refreshing way.

“Nice place,” Sirius said as they walked through a sitting room so big and so open that Sirius could fit three of the expansive libraries in Grimmauld in the single room.

Tony turned down a hall and opened a door halfway down it across from an identical door. “It used to be home,” he said. “You can stay here, the kid’s room is across from you.”

“The kid now, is he?” Sirius barked out a laugh as he tossed his bag on the ridiculously large bed with the soft looking white cover. “What happened to ‘my son’ and ‘I think I love him’?”

Sirius had actually been surprised to get that message from Tony earlier in the week. He’d assumed that Tony had fallen instantly in love with his son just as Sirius did the first time he met Harry. Of course, Harry had been a sweet little newborn with a head of dark hair and soft cries when Sirius met him, so maybe he’d been easier to fall in love with back then.

“‘The kid’, ‘my son’, carburetor, Cabernet,” Tony waved his hand and flicked his sunglasses up on his head. “It’s all the same. By the way, you’re a complete surprise, so if he starts screaming, you’re on your own. We’re at a truce, I can’t lose my progress for you.”

“How’d you get to a truce?” Sirius asked. He let Tony lead him back out of the room and hopefully toward wherever Harry was swimming at.

“Oh I gave a very motivating pep talk last night,” Tony said. He spoke in an airy manner, but Sirius heard the slight pride to his voice. He hadn’t actually considered what a learning curve raising Harry would be for him. And Sirius could give him as much information about magic and Harry’s history as he could, but damn if Sirius had a lot of general parenting advice.

If Tony was giving pep talks and feeling proud over it, then good for him. Sirius sucked at pep talks; he was better at ‘venting your problems and commiserating together’ type of talks.

And revenge, he was decent at that. Speaking of which…

“Have you killed the Dursley’s yet?” Sirius asked casually.

“Hm? Murder?” Tony gave Sirius a politely confused look over his shoulder. “That’s the best you could come up with? They made the kid miserable for nearly fourteen years and you think we should just kill them?” Tony clicked his tongue disapprovingly, “You used to be more fun, Sirius.”

Sirius grinned and turned down a hall that smelled like chlorine. “Spend twelve years in Azkaban, mate, it sucks the fun right out of you.”

“Now that carries a lot of potential for payback,” Tony said. “We just drop them off in a prison full of- what were they? Soul sucking demons?”

“Dementors.”

“Same thing,” Tony said. He stopped at the end of the hall and pointed to a thick white door. “Harry’s out there, I’ll be in here, good luck.”

Sirius eyed the door with trepidation coiling in his gut. He didn’t used to need ‘luck’ to talk with his godson, they’d clicked ever since they got to reunite at the end of Harry’s third year.

Harry sent Sirius a letter, Hedwig had delivered it the day that Sirius had been planning on leaving for Majorca. It had been light hearted, just saying hello, discussed his plans for the summer, and right at the end, an odd little question:

‘Is there a way to link a Gringotts vault to a store for direct owl orders? Are there even wizarding grocery stores? Probably not.’

Sirius canceled his plans to hide out in a different country and instead, very damn carefully, made his way to Surrey to find out why his godson needed to spend his trust vault on groceries.

And it had been the best damn summer of Sirius’ life. Sure, he spent a lot of his time as Padfoot, but he also spent almost all of his time with his godson. When Harry went back to Hogwarts last fall, they’d been nearly as close as Sirius had been with James and Harry even took James’ old mirror to school with him and they got to continue to grow close.

Sirius didn’t used to need ‘luck’ to talk with Harry, and he hoped that rapport would come back as soon as Harry saw that all Sirius had done was make a decision regarding his safety just as he should have been doing for his entire life.

“Here we go,” Sirius muttered before opening the door and stepping out into the ridiculously bright sunshine. Sirius barely had time to let his eyes adjust against the sun reflecting off the pool that had to be the size of a quidditch field when there was a gasp-

“Sirius?!”

Sirius smiled, feeling his worries melting away, as his eyes focused on his godson. Harry was gaping at him from the steps of the pool, his soaking wet hair was plastered to his forehead, and even in just three weeks, he looked healthier, happier even. At a minimum, he didn’t have any bruises on his face, his nose and cheekbones were pink from the sun, and the bags under his eyes weren’t gone, but were certainly diminished.

Sirius lifted his hand, keeping a safe distance until he knew Harry’s mood. “Hey, kiddo.”

Harry blinked with his mouth open. He shook his head, his hair flying around and sending little droplets to the area around him, then he looked down, drawing Sirius’ attention to the little pup splashing in the water in front of Harry.

“Does Arsehole know how to swim?” Sirius asked, breaking Harry from his shocked reverie and causing him to narrow those expressive eyes at him. It was funny; Harry had no true blood relation to James, but Sirius could read his emotions just as clearly through his eyes as he always could James’, and right now that emotion was hurt. Which meant that Harry was about to toss him a sneer and an insult.

Sure enough…

Harry curled his lip up, baring his teeth in irritation, and held his soaking wet dog against his bare chest while he looked down at the dog. “He doesn’t,” Harry said, imitating Sirius’ own disdainful drawl. “I considered tossing him in, letting him drown all by himself, simply abandoning him, but as I’m not an utter prick, I decided to stay with him instead.”

“I love a good analogy,” Sirius said, unbothered by the cheek. He walked over near them, his heart twinging to see Harry clutch the squirming and barking dog a little closer, and sat cross legged on the sunny cement not far from him.

Sirius closed his eyes and hummed for a moment, his hands palm up on his knees. “What if you were a weight to Arsehole? What if you were going to cause him to drown? Would you let him swim with someone else then?”

“I wouldn’t drown him,” Harry said, his voice heated. Sirius didn’t have to open his eyes to know he was surely scowling at him. “You see, when you care about someone, you stay with them. You wouldn’t understand, of course, but it’s a pretty standard idea.”

It was dirty, but Sirius rather wanted to skip the ‘fuck you’ stage and go back to the ‘best mates’ stage. He opened an eye halfway, and peered at Harry through it.

“Shame,” Sirius said, sounding bored and disinterested. “And here I thought you rather liked the Weasley family.”

Harry’s cold look masking his hurt crumpled instantly. Sirius held firm, forcing himself not to immediately assure Harry that he knew he cared about his friends; Harry would only retreat if he caved now.

It was like playing chess sometimes, talking with Harry.

Sirius wondered if Tony did much better than he did.

“I do care about Ron’s family,” Harry finally said, very obviously forcing himself to speak calmly, still worried about repercussions for ‘disrespect’. “You know that.”

Sirius did know. He knew that the Weasley’s were the first people to ever make Harry feel like he was a part of a family- it was one of the only reasons Sirius didn’t evict the annoying group out of his house. That and he was fond of the twins.

Sirius only shrugged though, closing his eyes once more and looking up at the sky, letting the sun warm his skin. “You left them, so, by your own logic, it means you don’t care about them.”

Harry hated having his snark thrown back at him during playful conversations, he certainly wasn’t going to like it when he was tense and hurt and furious. Sirius didn’t mind pissing Harry off, not really. It had been a real milestone in their relationship the first time Harry yelled at him and saw that Sirius wasn’t going to retaliate for it.

“To fucking keep them safe!” Harry snapped. “You think Voldemort will target them with me gone?”

Truthfully? Yes.

The Weasley’s were all public blood traitors who were aligned with Albus. Sirius was certain it was open season on ginger wizards.

“No,” Harry went on. “They’re safer without me in their life.”

He sounded so confident, so assured, a stranger wouldn’t know that Harry hated himself for leaving. Sirius knew though, because he knew Harry, and he knew his resolve was cracking.

“And you’re safer living away from me until we get this pesky war and rat squared away,” Sirius said, full of actual confidence. Sirius was a lot of things, but he’d be damned if he’d go back to being a shit godfather. This separation that hurt Harry so bad? It was nothing compared to twelve years in Azkaban or the short life Sirius would live if he lost his godson as a casualty to war.

“I’m not,” Harry said. His voice was soft, painfully soft. There was a flash of something in the back of his eyes, a shadow of the misery that always seemed to be clinging to the poor kid. “Everything sucks without you, Padfoot.”

Sirius smiled sadly, if he was Padfoot again, then they were moving in the right direction. Sirius scooted closer, an arms stretch from Harry now.

“What sucks about it, kiddo?” Sirius asked him. “Is It the cute dog or the cute boy?”

“The crazy people,” Harry said drily before swallowing and licking his lips, one of his adorable nervous habits he never seemed to notice. He moved his pup to the ground, letting him run around the fenced in area while he jumped up to sit on the edge of the pool. “MACUSA found me, by the way, if you care.”

Sirius snorted. “You’re such a shit,” he said fondly. “Tony told me they’re pretending you aren’t here. I wouldn’t normally trust a bloody politician, but you’re still a mystery in England.”

Harry looked skeptical, “Dumbledore and Voldemort have no way of finding me?”

Sirius hesitated. He was certain that Voldemort would start tracking Harry soon. Snape told them that he’d been furious to discover Harry was missing, and Snape would always carry the scars to prove it, much to Sirius’ delight. Voldemort wanted to find Harry as badly as Albus did, and he had a hell of a lot more ways to find him given he didn’t have the same hang-ups on legality and dark magic that Albus did. Albus knew it too, he merely told Snape to inform him as soon as Voldemort asked him to begin brewing and then they would work from there.

Albus was a fool if he thought Snape would give him Harry’s location before he gave it to Voldemort. The only saving grace was that Sirius was entirely confident that all of Harry’s belongings, an item nearly every tracking spell needed, were in his or Harry’s possession.

“As of now? No,” Sirius told Harry firmly. “Let’s play a game called I tell you what all you’ve missed while you’ve been dodging my messages and you tell me about last weekend?”

Harry’s expression shuttered closed immediately. His straightened his back out and squinted directly up in the sunlight. “I don’t actually care about what I missed,” he said flatly, a pretty clear message that he didn’t want to talk about his damned suicide attempt.

Tony downplayed his actions, but Sirius owed him his life for saving Harry’s.

“Why are you here? How’d you get here?” Harry asked instead.

Sirius gave Harry a full smile, knowing they were going to be just fine. “To have a little holiday with my godson,” he said, truly happy to have the opportunity to do it. He reached over slowly, making his movements obvious to give Harry time to move. His smile stretched when Harry clocked his incoming hand out of the corner of his eye and didn’t duck, allowing Sirius to ruffle his wet hair.

“And I flew kiddo, don’t be daft.”

Sirius’ shoulders relaxed entirely at the tiny sigh that came from Harry’s mouth, it felt a lot like an acceptance.

“Now, teach me to swim and tell me everything I’ve missed.”

 

As it turned out, Harry was sitting on the steps because he didn’t know how to swim either.

“You swam to the bottom of the Black Lake!”

“You sent me gillyweed, Sirius, have you forgotten?”

He had, actually.

 

They spent another hour out in the sun, sitting in the shallow end, splashing the hell out of each other and taking turns helping Harry’s little puppy learn to swim. Sirius could have stayed out there all day, splashing Harry every time he refused to answer a question, but Tony had his ‘robot bloke’, as Harry called the disembodied British voice, to tell them lunch was done.

And if Sirius had been mildly worried that spending time with Harry and Tony together would hurt him- remind him of Harry’s other dad too much, make him feel unnecessary in Harry’s life, cause him to question if Harry was adjusting at all- those worries were put to ease during lunch.

Tony was an affable bastard.

He kept up a steady stream of conversation, mostly about his robot muggle tech that Sirius couldn’t comprehend if his life depended on it, but with occasional tidbits to force Harry to talk.

“Your godson refuses to be a Ravenclaw,” Tony said toward the end of the meal. He stabbed a carrot on his plate and pointed it at Sirius, “Guess what color he painted his room?”

Sirius grinned at Harry, “Red?”

Harry shrugged, opting to remain mostly silent through the meal when not directly forced to speak. “It is my favorite color,” he said as he inspected the remaining salad on his plate with all the curiosity of a true Brit. “Can you only eat California Cobb Salad in California?”

“I usually do,” Tony said, nonplussed by the topic shift. “No one in New York makes it just right.”

“Thank God,” Harry murmured.

“And guess what color his bathroom is?” Tony said to Sirius. “Gold. And now poor Peter is going to have to have a Gryffindor bedroom even though he’s clearly a Ravenclaw as well.”

“Yeah?” Sirius nudged Harry’s ankle under the table with his foot and wiggled his eyebrows playfully. “He’s better looking than Bill, then?”

Harry’s face turned a sudden fiery red and he glared at Sirius for all he was worth. “Is this a cute new thing you’re doing, Padfoot? Co-parenting with Tony?”

Sirius caught Tony’s eye and saw him quirk a brow up in consideration.

“Yeah,” Sirius chuckled, feeling absurd that a bloke he once used to close down pubs with was now the one raising his godson for him (with him? something like that). “I suppose we are co-parenting a bit.”

“Dibs on being the hot mom who buries her post-divorce depression in wine,” Tony said brightly.

Sirius laughed again, more genuinely as he was brought in by Tony’s effortless charm. “Suppose that makes me the post-divorce dad?”

“You’re the every other weekend parent,” Tony said, pointing at Sirius with a teasing look in the set of his lips. “I send my kid to you, you try and get him drunk.”

“You told me to do drugs if they had any at that party,” Harry muttered as he moodily pushed his food around his plate.

Sirius leaned back in his chair and raised his brows challengingly as he locked his hands behind his head. “Try and get him drunk?” he scoffed. “I’ve got big plans when Harry turns of age, and they all involve getting him so pissed in a pub that he can’t remember his name.”

“How could I? People keep changing it,” Harry scowled.

“Yeah?” Tony crossed his arms smugly across his chest and smirked at Sirius. “I have three words, my friend: Central African Republic on August first.”

“And I have three words for you,” Sirius drawled. “I don’t know what that means, I don’t care what that means, and that was more than three words.”

Harry pushed his plate back and rolled his eyes as Sirius and Tony continued to banter.

“It means getting Harry legally drunk at fifteen.”

“Not without me you’re not.”

“Oh? You have a passport? You can come watch me get my son drunk.”

“Piss off. I’m buying him his first drink, I promised his dad I would.”

“Huh, I just remembered, when we were in bed one night, James told me ‘Tony, if I ever have a son that you fathered, I want you to take him to get his first legal drink’. It seemed awfully important to him, best not to ignore his request.”

“Is that so? Because I swear Lily wrote in her will, just above the bit about me being godfather, ‘Sirius, you have to buy Harry his first lager or I’ll haunt you’, and you know she’d be a bloody menace of a ghost. I’d never get laid again.”

“Good looking guy like you? Good looking ghost like Lily would be? I’m sure you’d have plenty of takers.”

Sirius laughed and eyed Tony appraisingly. “Would you shag a bloke being haunted by a ghost? A bloody loud ghost too, Evans was never quiet.”

“Hmm…” Tony looked at Sirius with a tiny quirk of his lips and a light in his eyes that Sirius hadn’t seen aimed in his direction by another human being in years. It was gratifying that it came from Tony now, because Sirius was just vain enough to be occasionally depressed every time he passed a mirror.

“If he looked like you? Yeah, I could ignore a ghost for a night.”

Sirius threw his head back and laughed until he felt tears watering up in his eyes.

Harry, apparently, didn’t see the humor at all. He jumped to his feet and snatched his plate off the table. “This has been fun, but I’ve got plenty of things to do besides listen to the two of you…” Harry trailed off and looked back and forth between them for a moment suspiciously. “Do whatever it is you’re doing,” he said slowly. “I’ll be in my room.”

Tony held a finger up when Harry stormed off toward the kitchen with his dishes to keep Sirius from calling him back.

“Hey, kid, so you don’t want to go on that tour of the city I promised you today?” Tony called to Harry with a smug grin aimed at his back.

Harry froze mid-step. Sirius could practically hear the wheels turning in his head. Harry turned his head and glared at Tony, but his eyes were too excited to bring any true heat to the look.

“I’m having you brought up on charges of blackmail,” he scowled.

Tony smiled innocently and batted his lashes at Harry. “One text is all I’m asking for,” he said cryptically.

It was cryptic to Sirius anyway, who watched the interaction curiously. Harry seemed to know precisely what he meant though because his cheeks flushed and his scowl deepened.

“I’m telling Pepper,” he said before resuming his juvenile stomping to the kitchen.

Sirius waited until he was gone to give Tony a curious look. “What was that?”

“Blackmail,” Tony said shamelessly. He pulled his phone out of his pocket and placed it on the table, pressing a few buttons and watching it carefully. “I told him if he sent a text to that kid I told you he likes, Peter, setting something up for next week that I’d let him drive one of the bikes in the garage. Aaaaand, done!” Tony slid the phone across the table to Sirius, “Parenting is so damn easy.”

Sirius gave him an incredibly unimpressed look. “He jumped off a bloody roof last weekend,” he hissed.

Tony gestured impatiently toward the phone. “And he’s got a date for next weekend now. Oh, are wizards that aren’t you and your friends all homophobic or did the kid develop that on his own?”

Sirius snorted and slid the phone back, not much interested in spying on Harry’s messages like Tony seemed to be. It was fine for Tony to be an overbearing prat, in the length of time he’d known he was a father he also thought Harry had been molested by Sirius’ neighbor and hung out with a terrorist, anyone would be a bit paranoid there.

“Wizards and witches don’t give a damn about sexuality as long as you eventually make a polite marriage for heirs and keep your good lays quiet,” Sirius said. “It’s Lily’s bloody sister that used to rile James and I up by calling Rem a poof.”

“‘Rem’?” Tony stroked his face thoughtfully. “Which one was that?”

“Moony. You’ve met him, quiet, tall, cardigans and puppy eyes.”

“Oooh, the one who looked like he wanted a go but was too shy to speak up?”

Sirius felt a surge of irrational jealousy, though he wasn’t entirely certain who it was aimed at. “Probably not,” he said evenly, “since we were together back then.”

Tony didn’t do contrite just as Sirius didn’t, he shrugged and leaned forward with a grin. “What happened? You went to jail and ‘Moony’ didn’t feel like being the Bonnie to your Clyde?”

“Something like that,” Sirius said vaguely, having no real desire to cloud up a holiday with the betrayals Sirius and Remus committed against one another time and time again. He smirked at Tony and raised a brow, enjoying the game he used to be so good at. “Why so curious? Interested in filling the position?”

Tony chuckled that time, and Sirius didn’t think he was uninterested, but Harry chose that moment to breeze back in the room, now dressed in a pair of jeans and a white tshirt, both fitting him perfectly, and he had a jacket hung over his shoulder.

It was hilarious, seeing Harry standing in such an arrogantly casual way. It was like looking in a mirror and remembering himself at Harry’s age, forcing a show of cocky confidence when he felt his most uncertain.

Harry wiggled his phone by his face, pressing his lips together in a tight line as he did.

“Done,” he drawled. “Don’t forget you said you’d teach me to drive.”

“You don’t know how to ride a bike?” Sirius asked, his chest aching that his godson missed such a normal milestone in his life.

Andromeda had taught Sirius to ride a bike when he’d been a kid and saw other kids, muggle kids, riding theirs. It used to be a hoot in the summers Sirius spent with the Potter’s, going for bike rides with James, Remus, and Peter.

He should have taught Harry to ride a bike ages ago.

“Piss off, and that’s not what he promised,” Harry said. “Motorcycles, Padfoot, he’s got a bloody garage filled with motorcycles.”

 

The sound Sirius made wasn’t decent, but neither were the rows of motorbikes that Tony had filling his garage.

 

“A Ducati,” Sirius moaned, running his hand tenderly down the side of a bike he’d already fallen in love with. He flicked just the battery on and moaned once more as he could practically feel the body pulsing with power. “Do you have any idea how fast this can go?”

Tony had been giving Harry a thorough lesson on one of the smaller bikes he had, a plain black and silver Harley, and barely even glanced at the bike Sirius was losing the plot over before flipping his hand around.

“When we find that rat, it’s all yours,” he said distractedly, not even blinking at the cost of what a bloody classic Ducati in pristine condition cost in the way that only ridiculously wealthy people could. “Oh, take it out later though, I need you to wreck one of the others, if you don’t mind.”

“You want me to wreck one of your bikes?” Sirius asked, bemused.

“Yeah, if you don’t mind. It’s for a project.”

Harry spun his finger in a circle beside his temple while Tony went to grab him a helmet and Sirius grinned.

He missed his godson so much.

Teaching his godson to drive a motorcycle was also one of the most fun things Sirius ever got to do as well.

“You’re going to be steadier if you go faster,” Sirius called to Harry as the three of them drove slowly around the paved roads weaving through Tony’s giant plot of land. Sirius drove one of Tony’s cheaper bikes, which was still bloody expensive, while Tony seemed content to glide along quietly on the other side of Harry.

Harry’s knuckles were white where he clutched his handlebars. “If I go faster, I’m going to tip it over and Tony’s going to be pissed.”

“Kid, I want someone to wreck one of these,” Tony told Harry. “Not you, preferably, because I’d rather Sirius get hurt than you, but I’m not going to be upset over a few scratches.”

Harry seemed skeptical as he continued to wobble along in first gear, so Sirius appealed to his Gryffindor side instead.

“Hey, kiddo, race you!”

Sirius took off while Harry sputtered; they were sticking around Tony’s place for now, waiting for Harry to feel more confident before they moved on actual streets. Tony’s property was beautiful though- all curves and palm trees and peeks of his private stretch of the ocean.

Sirius whipped around a curve, not going too fast, mostly just fast enough so Harry would try and catch up, and he let out a whoop when Harry raced right past him on a long stretch beside the beach.

They raced around the property for a good hour, Harry’s confidence growing and growing, before Tony suggested they go tour the city on the bikes. And Malibu was beautiful, Sirius genuinely couldn’t imagine why anyone would live in any other city when this one was so brilliant.

Harry slowed down when a police car passed them, but Tony merely laughed.

“They aren’t going to pull us over,” he told them. “Come on, I’ll show you guys the pier.”

 

By the time they made it back to Tony’s place, after seeing the pier and grabbing dinner at a posh little sandwich place, Sirius had a sunburn and a wide smile.

It was brilliant getting to just enjoy time with his godson- not hiding, not acting mad, not worried about a war or meetings or anything.

“I need a motorcycle,” Harry said after he dismounted his in the garage and patted it appreciatively.

“Sixteenth birthday, kid,” Tony said as he pushed his back to its original position. “Sirius, are you going wreck that one for me or just be a pain in my ass?”

“Both,” Sirius quipped. He winked at Harry, brandished his wand, and climbed back on the bike. “Totaled or just scratched?”

“Totaled, I want to see what happens when you repair a muggle machine with magic and I don’t want you messing with my important toys.”

Sirius laughed at the implication that the bike wasn’t important, but he saluted Tony with his wand and kicked the bike back to life.

“Avenge me if I die,” Sirius told Harry with mock-solemnity.

Harry leaned against one of the posts in the garage and smirked. “If you’re daft enough to go driving into trees, I won’t be avenging you.”

Sirius pouted, but it was fair. He didn’t mind being a little daft though, he’d wrecked loads of bikes before. His own motorbike had been wrecked more times than Sirius could remember.

 

“You bloody moron,” Harry laughed when Sirius returned thirty minutes later, the destroyed bike levitating in front of him.

“Any injuries?” Tony asked, sounding more curious than concerned, as he pointed toward a place in the back of the garage for Sirius to put the bike down. After Sirius shook his head and dropped the bike, Tony grinned at him. “Fix it.”

“You’re bossy,” Sirius chuckled. He obliged him though, curious as well considering his bike was mostly magical after all the tinkering he did to it. Harry drifted over, his curiosity overtaking his desire to remain aloof, and Sirius waved his wand, sending all the broken pieces back to their positions.

Tony let out a delighted laugh when the bike stood before them, entirely repaired.

“Moment of truth, gentlemen,” he said as he pulled the clutch in and started it. Sirius and Tony let out cheers when the bike started right up.

“You can have the honors,” Tony told Sirius. “Just do a quick lap, make sure it drives.”

 

Sirius hadn’t been certain what the point of the test on the perfectly working motorcycle had been, but he found out later that night.

After tossing and turning for a few hours, Sirius finally gave sleep up as a bad job and went wandering about Tony’s house.

“Can’t sleep?” Sirius asked Tony himself when he ran into him in the kitchen.

Tony scoffed and got up from where he’d been slumped over a drink to grab another glass. He poured Sirius a few fingers from whatever bottle he had laying on the counter. Sirius hummed appreciatively after trying It. He hadn’t had good good muggle booze in years.

“I don’t actually sleep much,” Tony said after refilling their drinks. He said it in his airy and arrogant manner, but Sirius reckoned everyone had something that kept them up some nights.

“House full of insomniacs then,” Sirius said. “Harry and I used to have our best talks in the middle of the night.”

“Yeah?” Tony picked his head up and propped his chin in his hand. “He sleeps here.”

Sirius smiled wryly. “Does he? Or does he just stay in his room all night?”

Tony tapped his fingernail on his glass and stared off in the distance for a long moment before he huffed. “Great question, short answer, I’ve got no idea.”

Sirius raised his glass to Tony before swallowing it down. “He doesn’t sleep,” he said bluntly. “He remembers his parents being murdered, dreams about it. He saw his classmate die and dreams about that too.”

“Hmm…” Tony abruptly finished off his drink and got to his feet. “If nobody’s sleeping anyway then, come on, let’s grab the kid and you two can help me on my project.”

Harry had been awake when they peeked in on him. His hair was a mess, his eyes were bleary, and he was as bemused as Sirius was when Tony told him to quit pretending to sleep and help ‘revolutionize magical technology’.

“It is three am,” Harry hissed as he shuffled along behind them with his pup obediently following along.

“You weren’t sleeping,” Tony told him. “Come on, come watch your godfather shoot spells at me.”

Harry brightened up almost immediately, as did Sirius once Tony let them in his ‘lab’ and he put on the famous Iron Man suit.

“Don’t hold back,” Tony said, his voice robotic and flat through the mask. “Do your worse.”

“Don’t kill him,” Harry drawled, sounding bored despite the eager gleam in his eyes. He sat on the floor and played tug-o-war with a spare piece of rope with his dog. “I’d hate to be surprise adopted again.”

“It wasn’t adoption, it was—”

“Petrificus Totalis!”

Sirius watched the spell leave his wand, strike Tony right in the metal chest, and…

And do nothing but dissipate into thin air.

“Wicked,” Harry breathed. “Siri, do more!”

“Yeah, ‘Siri’, do more,” Tony egged him on. “Let’s see some real magic.”

Sirius was happy to comply. He sent as many spells as he could think of at Tony, causing Harry to actually laugh when none of them affected him.

“It’s a magic shield!” Harry laughed. He held up the dog and made it watch, “Look, Arsehole, magic shield.”

“It’s the tesseract,” Tony said from behind his mask. He spoke quickly, clearly excited about the results of his test. “It’s what the arc reactor that powers all my tech was based on, it’s from Asgard. Sirius, try something harder. I need to know if this works against everything.”

“I’ve done everything short of an unforgivable,” Sirius said. Aside from hexing Snape on occasion, Sirius hadn’t had a reason to cast so much magic recently. He hated to admit it, but he was out of breath and mentally cursing himself for letting Azkaban wear him down.

“So try one of those,” Tony said. “Don’t kill me, but you can do the torture one.”

Sirius couldn’t think of a real reason not to, even if it wouldn’t be powerful, he could cast a crucio to test the suit limits.

He stood up straight and focused, drawing all his power to his center and hoping he wasn’t about to torture Harry’s dad.

“Crucio!”

It was nearly slow motion, watching the red spell leave Sirius wand and travel toward Tony. Sirius staggered backward to sit on the stool behind him, Harry let out a harsh hiss of disapproval, and…

And nothing.

The crucio hit Tony’s chest and simply disappeared, just like all the spells before it did.

“Either Sirius sucks at magic or the arc reactor doesn’t recognize it!” Tony yelled jubilantly as he retracted his mask to show his face. “Do you know what this means? This changes— hey, where are you off to?”

Sirius turned to follow Tony’s line of sight and felt a load of weight settle in his stomach at the look on Harry’s face as he snatched his dog and began inching out of the room.

“I don’t actually give a damn about any of this,” he said. “Have fun with your fucking games. Spoiler alert, they aren’t much fun.”

Sirius sighed and wiped his face when Harry stalked right out of the room, closing the door gently behind him.

“I am missing something,” Tony said quietly. He removed his suit, a neat and easy removal that left him in his sweat pants and shirt. “What am I missing?”

“Me being an idiot,” Sirius said. He got to his feet, intending on going to check on Harry. “Harry got tortured by crucio back in May, he got all three unforgiveables, actually.”

“Fuck.” Tony aimed a kick at a nearby table leg and then scowled. “I’m doing excellent as a father, honestly I think my award should be in the mail any day now.”

Sirius laughed, it sounded as hollow as he felt though. “Nah, it was my fault, mate. I’ll go see if he wants to talk or yell or something, yeah?“

“Go ahead,” Tony waved him off and pulled a glowing screen out of a table. “I’ll just… see you later.”

Sirius gave him another sarcastic salute then set off to find Harry. He shifted into Padfoot just outside Harry’s door, keeping his wand clenched carefully in his mouth, and scratched on the door.

“Kindly piss off.”

Sirius whined and scratched harder.

It took nearly a minute of whining and scratching, but Harry finally threw the door open.

“You think being a dog gets you out of everything,” Harry scoffed, staring down at Sirius with narrow and red-rimmed eyes. “I’ve replaced you, Pads, Arsehole is much quieter.”

Sirius barked, drawing the attention of the tiny dog that thought he took Sirius’ position. The little pup jumped off Harry’s bed, stumbling and tripping, and bound over to Sirius with happy yips and a wagging tail.

“You bloody traitor,” Harry sighed, shaking his head at where Arsehole began sniffing Sirius curiously. “Piss off, both of you.”

Sirius barked, startling Arsehole in to jumping away, when Harry moved to throw himself on his bed. If Harry didn’t want to talk, it was fine, Sirius would just cheer him up instead.

Sirius growled playfully at Arsehole, waiting until the smaller dog crouched down, growling and wagging his tail as well. When Sirius leapt at the dog, the little one barked and darted off.

And the chase was on.

The two dogs chased one another for a while, barking and yipping and bumping into Harry’s legs that dangled off the bed as often as they could. They eventually made enough of a racket that Harry rolled on his side, watching them and working hard not to smile.

Sirius made a jump as he chased the puppy at one point, leaping up and licking Harry’s face, causing him to finally laugh.

“You’re disgusting,” he said. He wiped his face off and tried to glare, but his quivering lips only encouraged Sirius to try again. Sirius helped nudge Arsehole up on the bed, then Sirius climbed up and they attacked Harry with all they were worth.

They had Harry quickly reduced to a shrieking giggling mess. “I give!” he cried, pushing Sirius away as hard as he could. “I’m never going to get this dog drool out of my hair!”

Sirius hoped his bark properly portrayed how little he cared about Harry’s hair. He did settle down though, as Harry inched backward on the bed until his head rested on his pillow.

“Little late to sleep now, eh?” Harry said, glancing at the clock on his wall.

Sirius looked at it as well and barked softly then moved in a circle and settled down beside Harry while Arsehole curled up right on his chest.

“Lazy dogs,” Harry snorted. His hand moved over to Sirius’ head and he began scratching him in an absent gesture. “Missed you, Pads.”

Sirius whined. He missed Harry too. He wished it could be like this all the time-

One day, he tried to say through a bark.

“Things don’t tend to work out for me that well,” Harry mused quietly, apparently properly interpreting Sirius’ bark in the way Sirius suspected only Harry could.

Sirius whined and Harry yawned.

“If anyone tries to wake me up, bite them,” Harry murmured. His fingers still moved in Sirius’ fur and Sirius felt content enough that he thought he might sleep as well.

Sirius watched Harry through a sliver of a peek through his eyelids and didn’t close them fully until Harry’s hand rested on his head, his fingers still, and his mouth partially open as he slept.

He wished Harry could look as peaceful when he was awake as he did in his sleep.

 

One day.

 

The rest of their weekend holiday went by too quickly for Sirius.

He swam with Harry, sometimes in the pool, down at the beach twice. He walked around the property, occasionally as Padfoot to make Harry laugh as he barked and chased birds with Arsehole. He bantered with Tony, already missing the witty battles when he would be back at Grimmauld with no one to truly talk to.

He got Harry to talk a little about his jump from the roof, though Harry merely said it was a heat of the moment mistake and he ‘did not need therapy and fuck you for suggesting it’.

Tony assured Sirius during their late night drink Sunday that it was ‘a work in progress’. Which was the best Sirius could ask for, knowing Harry as he did.

 

Monday morning came too soon and Sirius had to fight back genuine tears as he stood outside on the launch pad with Harry.

Harry handed him an envelope, for his friends, he said, then stood there looking small and unhappy.

“You can call me again now,” Sirius said. He’d given Harry back his wand and his mirror, though Harry said he could keep the cloak for future trips out of Grimmauld. They always had the option to talk over their phones, but half of Harry’s communication was done through facial expressions and Sirius missed seeing his face during the talks they had before Harry began ignoring him.

Harry had his head ducked and shrugged his shoulders. “It’s not the same,” he muttered. He lifted his head and Sirius swallowed to see Harry looked as miserable at separating again as he did.

“I know,” Sirius agreed. His eyes flicked to where Tony waited in the doorway, his glasses concealing his eyes again. “It’s good here though, kiddo, better than where I’m headed, trust me. And- and as soon as it’s all done, I’m coming back.”

Harry tried to smirk, but it looked weak. “For the Ducati?”

Sirius sighed wistfully, trying to keep their goodbye casual and not as horribly gut-wrenching as it felt. “The Ducati and you,” he said. He clasped Harry’s shoulder and waited until he looked up again. “This isn’t forever, kiddo, the war has to end sometime.”

Instead of seeming comforted by that, Harry suddenly jerked forward and had Sirius wrapped in a desperate hug.

“Don’t die,” he whispered. “Please, Siri, if it ever comes down to it, be a coward and live.”

Sirius held Harry to him tightly, holding him as long as he could. “I will,” he said thickly. He looked at Tony, “And you live too, kiddo. Life is going to be so… so brilliant for you.”

Tony nodded and Harry released Sirius, allowing him to take the hardest ten steps backward on to the plane.

“Be safe, Harry,” Sirius said, yelling over the sound of the plane starting up. “Stay off ledges, and I’ll see you soon.”

“Don’t kill anyone in the meantime,” Harry yelled. He lifted his hand and Sirius watched as Tony stepped over closer to Harry. “I mean it, Pads, no dying or getting arrested! I’ll kill you!”

“Love you too,” Sirius laughed. He waved when the plane ramp closed and waited until it took off for the skies to allow one traitorous tear to escape him.

 

He could never leave this time if he didn’t see for himself how much Tony cared about Harry and his happiness and his health.

One day he wouldn’t have to leave.

Catch the rat, end the war, assure Harry’s safety, and then it could be all blue skies, easy banter, and bikes with his godson.

It was the mantra he repeated through the flight when he felt a weight return to his chest. He chanted it mentally before disembarking beneath the cloak and apparating to the street outside his prison family home.

One day he wouldn’t be there anymore.

One day he’d be with his godson and his godson’s family just as he always dreamt of.

One day. One day. One day.

Chapter Text

“Jarvis, are we recording?”

“Yes, sir,” Jarvis said promptly. A glowing red light in the corner of Tony’s glasses when he looked in the mirror confirmed his words.

Tony ran a hand over his hair, straightened the tie he rarely bothered to wear with his nicest suit, and plastered a smile on his face.

“Showtime.”

Tony stepped from behind the curtain to the impromptu stage that had been erected to hear the new owner of Grunnings Drill Company speak to the employees. It wasn’t a huge company, by any means. Perhaps 250 employees total, including the current directors.

Tony let his eyes sweep across them all as they clapped politely for him until he found the man of the hour.

There.

Vernon Dursley. He looked similar enough to his drivers license photo that Tony had no difficulties in identifying the man. It helped that he stood nearly as wide as he did tall, with a ridiculous bushy blonde mustache that took up most of his face and hid his upper lip. He stood with his legs wide, probably to support his weight, and pulled on his suspenders with the air of a man who thinks he’s much more important than he was.

Time to put that notion to rest.

“Thank you,” Tony called out, his voice carrying easily through the warehouse they assembled in for the meeting. “For those of you who don’t know, I’m Tony Stark, the new owner of Grunnings.”

There were the obligatory chuckles, very few people who didn’t spend their time at some anti-electronic cult of a castle were unaware of who Tony Stark was.

“And since I’ve got plans with my son in a few hours, I’ll keep this short,” Tony said pleasantly. He waited a beat to make sure he had their complete attention before continuing. “I trust everyone likes their recent raises? The plans for expansions? The lifts on commissary caps?”

The claps were louder that time, even a few whistles, and Tony smiled at them. Purchasing Grunnings wasn’t a horrible investment, not really. They had potential to grow, and with Stark Industries pairing with them, they’d be the next top tool brand.

“You might be wondering why I bought this little family owned business. Why not Dewalt or Milwaukee? I’ll tell you,” Tony pointed at Dursley, “that man right there gave me the inspiration to buy Grunnings Drill Company.”

Dursley looked surprised and startled to be singled out, then he looked smug as his coworkers began clapping for him and shooting him appreciative looks.

Tony let him bask in the limelight for a moment, even clapping his own hands together a few times, before moving in.

“And we’ve never met before,” Tony said to the others. “Imagine that, I bought an entire company for a man I’ve never met face to face, wild, right? My business director was stunned. But just like family is important to the Grunnings, who are relaxing in Hawaii now I believe, it’s important to me too.”

Tony laughed, a forced and fake laugh, but charming nonetheless. “I never even introduced my son, did I? See, here’s the thing, I didn’t know I had a son for a while…” his eyes met Dursley’s and his smile turned sharp as Dursley lost a few shades of color in his cheeks.

Hopefully he was thinking of that NDA and relinquishing of his legal guardianship for a certain kid a couple of weeks ago.

“And, like any proud papa, I have a photo.” Tony clicked a button on his watch and let a photo he took of Harry shine in the air. It was a good photo too, Harry had been sitting on the beach with the sun shining on his wet hair, his eyes lit up and his mouth spread in a laugh as Sirius paddled in the ocean as a dog.

Tony didn’t look at the picture though, he watched Vernon Dursley. He watched as his face turned colors so quickly that someone else might worry for his health. Tony only worried that he’d drop dead before he had a chance to wreck havoc in his life.

Surprisingly, a few people glanced from the photo of Harry on display to Dursley. Apparently Harry wasn’t as much of a hidden relation as he had wished to make him.

“Yep, that’s my boy,” Tony said, actual pride lacing his tone. “Good kid too, you should meet him, he’s practically magical.”

A full body twitch from Dursley. The man beside him with the goatee and tweed suit inched away.

Fun.

“And the more I talked with him, the more I realized that sometimes there are disgusting pieces of human waste in this world,” Tony said thoughtfully. “So it made think of the best way to vanish waste, and you know what? I started with a full audit for all my companies.”

Tony stared directly at Dursley with a challenging and cold look. A look that promised retaliation for every single thing he said to his son, every night he made him sleep in a closet, and every time he raised his hand to his kid and made him feel unloved and unsafe.

Something unfurled in Tony’s stomach, something he typically worked to push down, but relished in it this once. It was a possessive sort of satisfaction in knowing the he was about to hurt someone who hurt someone he cared about. He was going to dress it up, call it justice, but it was just revenge.

And he wanted Dursley to know it.

“Vernon Dursley has been skimming money from the books for years,” Tony lied easily. “He’s been overcharging customers, pocketing the extra from both customers and commissions.”

There wasn’t any dramatic sounds of surprise, but there were a lot of heated looks at the incredibly purple-faced man who’s chin was touching his chest as he gaped at Tony in pure shock.

Checkmate, you dick.

“I have not!” Dursley roared once he managed to move his jaw again. He looked toward where the directors stood and jabbed a finger at Tony on the stage. “He is lying!”

Tony was, but the paperwork and audit would look like he wasn’t. And the Grunning’s lawyers would go after Dursley hard and every piece of property he owned, every cent he had in his account, and every bit of his savings would be up for grabs when they went back twenty-five years and saw the ‘theft’ Dursley committed.

Once Dursley was penniless, drug through the courts, trashed in the papers, then Tony would find a way to ensure he knew that he should have given his son a god damned bed to sleep in.

The directors looked at Tony, their brows raised in obvious ‘what do we do here?’ positions, and Tony waved his hand toward Dursley. “Arrest him,” he said. He waited until security began moving toward Dursley to add his final remark, “You’re fired, by the way.”

Dursley allowed himself to be led from the warehouse to the exit, shouting and sputtering all the while about how this was a mistake, he was a good employee, blah blah blah.

All true, honestly. Vernon Dursley was the top selling salesman with the highest records that Grunnings had ever seen. The company might even take a hit if his contracts declined to renew with a new salesman.

Tony would burn the building to ashes without insurance though if it meant getting even a small amount of justice for his kid.

“Well, with that taken care of…” Tony clapped his hands together and silenced the whispered conversations over the new development. “I decided to add another 5% to your raises for incredibly important reasons I can’t be bothered to explain. Now, I think Jennings, Roalds, and Watson have a meeting to get to over charges to press, lawsuits to file, all that boring stuff. The rest of you should take the day off.” Tony touched two fingers to his temple and swung his arm out in a mimic of a salute, “Make me proud.”

There was more applause, more genuine applause anyway, as Tony stepped off the stage and had a quick chat with the lawyer and directors he had singled out. He encouraged them to run an audit, see the damage for themselves, and then begin going after Dursley for every pound that it appeared as if he stole. And if they did their job properly, went back from the first sale Vernon Dursley ever made, they were going to end up with his house, his cars, his entire boring little middle-class life in their hands.

Nearly two million pounds was going to be a struggle for Dursley to pay back, but that was really his problem, not Tony’s.

 

Tony’s only problem was catching a flight back to New York in time to chat with his kid about the upcoming school year. Oh, and sending Sirius the video of Dursley being fired.

He sent the video from the plane, even attached a caption of ‘Step One’ with a few of the random emojis that Sirius preferred to communicate with. About midway through the flight, Tony got back a shooting star and a palm tree.

He really expected more from Sirius when he brought up the Dursley situation over the weekend. What use was killing someone when you could destroy their life instead? Wizards were hideously behind on times.

 

Tony had his tie off before he disembarked the plane and his jacket hit the floor almost the instant he entered his place.

“Greetings, favorite son, favorite future wife,” Tony called to Harry and Pepper. The two of them were sitting on the floor of the living room, papers and brightly colored brochures spread across the coffee table. Harry had his eyebrows pinched together, causing his forehead to crinkle, and Pepper’s teal eyes were sparkling with laughter. Tony felt an unexpected wave of fondness wash over him as he looked at them; it was odd, it was messy, but they were his home. And damn if it didn’t feel good to be home.

“Did I miss dinner?” Tony asked hopefully, looking around for any signs of food.

“You actually missed an excellent dinner,” Pepper said. She smiled at Harry, causing the kid to lose a single wrinkle in his forehead, before turning to Tony. “Did you know Harry can cook?”

“I can’t, actually,” Harry said quickly. He busied himself with stacking up the brochures for what seemed like every high school in the state. He shot Tony a quick look, hints of distrust still present in his eyes. “Pepper did all the work, I only saved the sauce.”

Tony flopped in the chair behind Pepper and plucked one of the pamphlets from the coffee table to look over. It was for a private prep school, York Prep School, and looked like the kind of place that Tony would have hated and he was sure Harry would as well.

“Harry’s being modest,” Pepper said warmly. She pushed a pamphlet toward Tony, a blue and yellow one that proudly stated ‘Midtown School of Science and Technology’ in big block letters across the front.

“I tried making chicken Parmesan, since it seemed simple enough when my dad used to make it, and Harry could smell I was ruining it clear from his bedroom.”

Tony watched Harry subtly over the top of the Midtown pamphlet and saw he looked torn between being pleased at Pepper’s praise, as the adorable little pink splotches on his cheeks indicated, or irritated by it, as the heavy rolling of his eyes indicated.

“Beginners luck,” Harry said firmly, apparently wanting to close the subject. “Also, I don’t know algebra, and I can’t go to school with these…” he flapped his hand at the pamphlets, mimicking Tony’s favorite move of disdain, “These genius kids. They’re going to think I’m an idiot.”

Tony scoffed and tossed the Midtown pamphlet back on the table. “You’re a wizard, so where’s the wizard school pamphlets? Surely there’s more than one in the world?”

Harry pulled a golden brochure from the bottom of the stack and slid it across the table, avoiding eye contact all the while. “It’s in Massachusetts,” he said, quietly and snark free. “Hedwig brought me that this weekend, from the President, I guess. I- I think I’m accepted if I want to go.”

The famous hero of England that the wizard President of America went out on a limb to protect? Yeah, Tony wasn’t exactly falling over in shock that he had a place at the American wizard school.

Tony looked it over, nodding in approval that it had been founded by a ‘no-maj’, meaning it had to be less archaic than Hogwarts, and winced at the blatant description of a boarding school lifestyle. Call it paranoia, but Tony would feel better if his son lived at home, where it was safe, rather than at a school full of kids with magic. One of them could lose control, then it would be Tony’s son flying across a room and falling unconscious, or worse. But… but Harry was a wizard and telling him he couldn’t train to be a wizard would have been like telling Tony he couldn’t study robotics or engineering.

The last thing Tony wanted to do was hold his kid back.

“So what are we thinking here?” Tony asked. He grabbed the pamphlet for Midtown, York, and Illvermony and held them up. “Any ideas?”

“It’s going to be bloody terrible any way it goes,” Harry said irritably. “One place I’m an idiot, one place I’m the Boy-Who-Lived, and one place—”

“Where you have friends and can be tutored to catch up to their level,” Pepper cut in. And man, she sounded like such a mom too. All firm and supportive, it was distractingly hot. “This is a big decision, Harry, and we’ll support you no matter what. Plus,” she grinned and plucked the Midtown pamphlet from Tony, “I bet I know a certain cute boy who wouldn’t mind tutoring you if you chose Midtown.”

“You’re absolutely right, Pep,” Tony nodded while Harry turned a dark shade of red. “Sure, people think Cap doesn’t understand modern mathematics, but really I think he’s a genius in disguise.”

Harry’s blush disappeared and he even gave Tony a friendly, if small, grin. “Yeah? Suppose Bruce is all about science then?”

“Doctor Banner?” Tony scoffed and relaxed back in his seat. “Kid, you might have missed it with his glasses and whole Hulk bit, but Bruce is a poet at heart. He can quote Robert Frost in a way that leaves you heart broken and contemplative for weeks.”

Harry’s grin slowly slipped away at whatever new mistake Tony made.

“I don’t know who that is,” he said quietly. He fingered the Midtown pamphlet and a flash of longing flitted across his face before he pushed it away.

Pepper gave Tony a ‘fix this, now,’ look before getting up and stretching her back. “Tony, you want some dinner? I’ll heat you up a plate.”

“You’re a goddess,” Tony told her truthfully, waiting until she walked off to attempt to resolve whatever insecurity was plaguing his son. “Kid, nobody really knows Robert Frost, he’s just another dead poet.”

“They know math and science and fucking chemistry though,” Harry scowled. He looked at the neat stack of brochures and Tony thought he looked like he wanted to catch them all on fire.

“Do they know potions or transforming spells? No,” Tony said with conviction. He tried out one of Pepper’s warm smiles when Harry looked up at him from his seat on the floor, but the kid looked mildly confused so Tony figured it didn’t look as encouraging when he did it.

“You can learn math and science and all that, hell kid, I can teach you everything you need to know. Those kids can’t learn magic. They could wave a wand around and never do a single thing. So, it’s up to you, if you want to focus on magic, we’ll do Illvermony. If you want to go to school with your geek, we’ll do Midtown. If you want to meet some of the future social snobs that used to throw the best parties in the city, then we’ll do York. I don’t care where you go to school, but don’t let something pointless like current skill level stop you from going where you want.”

Instead of perking up, as was the entire point of Tony’s extremely motivational pep talk, the kid looked more downtrodden than before.

“You might have missed this, along with every other thing in my life—”

As if it was Tony’s fault. The kid was a riot.

“—but I’m not actually some miniature genius,” Harry said, his voice as warm as Steve was during his long nap. “Sorry to disappoint.”

Harry said it like a shit, and his arms were tense as they held his torso up on the floor, but… but Tony actually thought he did look a little sorry, as if Tony could be disappointed in him, which was stupid and he would happily tell him that.

“Saved a ridiculously over powered stone from a maniac.”

Harry’s glare somehow deepened. “Pardon?”

“Saved a little girl from dying by putting a sword through a basilisk.”

“You don’t even know what that is.”

Tony raised his voice, “Saved your godfather from having his soul stolen. Saved him from prison. Rescued some redhead kid from possibly murderous mermaids. And escaped from an actually murderous sociopath.”

“SHUT UP!” Harry jumped to his feet, his chest heaving and his eyes misty looking. Tony heard Pepper drop something in the kitchen and hoped she stayed in there.

“YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT!” Harry yelled. He ran a hand through his hair, tugging the ends harshly and glared at Tony harshly. “You heard Sirius talk about things he wasn’t even there for and you think it’s got anything to do with skill? That was luck,” Harry spat, his face twisting up angrily. “It wasn’t me being clever or quick, I was just bloody lucky.”

Tony waited, making sure he had nothing else to add, then went on.

“Flew on an airplane. Traveled to a new country alone. Went to a party with people you didn’t know. Made friends. Adopted a dog and spoiled the shit out of. Drove a motorcycle—”

Tony heard Pepper swear in the kitchen, but he didn’t worry about that just then. That was future Tony’s problem.

“Reconciled with your godfather. Kicked Nick Fury’s ass. And woke up this morning and began making plans for the future.”

Harry’s breathing had slowed somewhere around ‘adopted a dog’ and his little angry face was more wary than anything by the time Tony finished his list.

“All those things? You did them,” Tony said calmly, staring evenly up at the kid now. “You think I’m disappointed you don’t know the formula for pi? Who cares? Those other parents, the ones with the super lame ‘my kid’s on honor roll’ bumper stickers have no idea what it’s like having a kid who’s done so much in such a short time.”

Tony mentally chanted the words he really needed to say, four easy little words that he certainly never heard from his dad, but Harry seemed to need to hear from him.

Four words. Easy.

So easy.

Harry stared at him, Tony stared back.

Four words.

“I’mproudofyou,” Tony said in a rush, causing Harry to rear back and actually take a step further from where Tony sat in his chair. Tony cleared his throat, refusing to do something as plebeian as blush, and tried again. “I’m proud of you for all the things you’ve done,” he said slowly, enunciating clearly so there was no misunderstanding between them.

“The big stuff, the ‘lucky stuff’, and the things that you might think are little, but aren’t actually. You traveled to a new country without a cell phone, kid. I won’t take a leak in a bar without mine on me, that takes guts and has nothing to do with luck. So don’t think I give a damn about if you go to Midtown and flunk out, which you won’t, by the way, because school is literally the least important factor to judge a person on.

“In fact,” Tony smiled brightly, “you should just be homeschooled. We can get Sirius to teach magic stuff, I’ll do the muggle stuff, we can get Pepper to dress in a naughty teacher outfit, it’ll be great!”

Harry’s tense posture seemed to sag, his shoulders slumped and he actually looked shocked, as if Tony had struck him across the face. Then, apropos of nothing, he looked disgusted as he scrunched his nose up.

“Sirius is half-mad and I’d rather not see Pepper in a ‘naughty teacher outfit’,” he said. He sounded normal again, snarky and dry, just the way Tony liked him.

Pepper chose that moment to make her grand re-entrance, a plate of food that smelled heavenly in her hands. “We can put your dad in detention for the rest of his life,” she said with a dirty look aimed at Tony before contradicting her mean words by carefully handing him the hot plate. Pepper sat on the sofa while Tony made love to what was probably the first home cooked dinner he’d had in months with his eyes.

“Whatever school you want to attend will be lucky to have you,” she told Harry. “You’ve got time to decide. If you want to go to Midtown, just let us know and we can start finding tutors.”

“Er… right.” Harry glanced down at the table then quickly snagged the stack of pamphlets. He shifted uneasily as he looked at them. “Thanks, I guess.”

“You’re welcome, I guess,” she grinned.

Harry retreated to his bedroom quickly after a mumbled ‘good night’, the pamphlets in hand and his loyal dog following behind him. Pepper waited until his door closed to swat Tony’s arm.

“You’re a moron, Tony Stark,” she said, no real heat to her voice. She rolled her eyes while Tony took a hesitant bite of his food. “‘Naughty teacher outfit’, he is fourteen!”

“Almost fifteen,” Tony corrected her. He closed his eyes and let out a nearly indecent noise. “Forget magic or science, let’s send the kid to culinary school.”

Pepper sighed, a soft and sad little sound. “I don’t think he likes to cook, actually. I thought he did, because he was so good at it, but he mentioned cooking a lot for ‘his relatives’,” Tony loved when she did the sarcastic finger quotes, “and he was in a rush to get out of the kitchen as soon as he saved me from ruining the food.”

“In that case, I’m hoping for Midtown,” Tony said truthfully. “Also, remind me to send you the video of firing Dursley for theft.”

Pepper leaned on the armrest of the couch, the brightness of her eyes another thing Tony loved about her. “Was he stealing?” she asked in a whisper.

Tony smirked, “Not a dime.”

Pepper laughed while Tony took another few bites of the best damn chicken parm he ever tasted.

“Hey, Tony?”

“Hmm?”

Pepper smirked and batted her eyelashes. “I’mproudofyou,” she said in a quiet rush of breath, mocking Tony’s genuine attempt at sounding like a parent.

Tony rolled his eyes that time and tried to stab her arm with his fork. “Laugh all you want, Miss Potts, but I’m beginning to think the Internet had it all wrong. Parenting is god damned hard.”

Pepper quit laughing, though she still smiled sweetly at him. “I was teasing, but…” She leaned over the armrest and pecked Tony quickly on the cheek. “I am proud of you,” she murmured.

 

Tony was glad he had said it to the kid, because he didn’t realize until then how nice that was to hear.

Chapter Text

“You are a Gryffindor,” Harry muttered to himself before raising his hand and knocking on the door in front of him.

Harry hardly had time to question if he’d knocked too aggressively before the door was thrown open and Harry came face to face with a woman.

She had a soft face, pretty brown eyes, and had long dark hair piled on top of her head. She was older, a few streaks of grey in her hair and the wrinkles around her eyes told him that, but she looked kind, like Mrs Weasley, and Harry liked her immediately.

“Oh! You must be Harry!” She smiled and ushered Harry inside the little house and off the porch. Harry looked around the sitting room and felt the similarities to Ron’s family home rise. It was cozy, filled with inviting furniture and a little telly with the news muted on it. It was a little cluttered and felt like how a home should.

“We have heard so much about you, I’m May,” she said, smiling over her shoulder. “Hold on, PETER!” she yelled up a staircase. “YOUR FRIEND IS HERE!”

Harry planned on wandering upstairs to Peter’s room, but Mrs Parker ushered him toward the kitchen in the back of the house and Harry, feeling rather bemused and awkward, just followed her.

“Oh,” Harry stopped in the kitchen doorway when Mrs Parker moved to the stove to turn off what looked like a tea kettle and there was someone else sitting at their table. An older man with a head full of grey hair and a pair of glasses perched on his face. Peter’s uncle, Harry assumed. “Hello, sir,” he said.

The man looked up and offered Harry what seemed to be an utterly genuine smile. “Hello,” he held his hand out, causing Harry to have to step further in the kitchen and shake his hand or risk offending him. “I’m Ben Parker, Peter’s uncle.”

“Harry P- Stark, nice to meet you,” Harry said politely, if not truthfully.

“Why don’t you have a seat?” Mr Parker offered, nodding toward one of the chairs. “Tell us about yourself, Harry.”

“Peter’s so secretive,” Mrs Parker tsk’d. “Tea, Harry?”

“Uh… sure, thank you, Mrs Parker.”

Mrs Parker laughed, a warm and sweet laugh, and shook her head while she grabbed three teacups from the cabinet next to her stove. “Just May, dear,” she told him. “Here you go.”

Harry was rather bemused as ‘May’ slid Harry and Mr Parker each a teacup and filled them, and her own, before sitting down and blowing on her cuppa.

Harry wasn’t an idiot, he knew that some people surely had kind aunts and uncles, it was just… it was rather startling to have that vague idea actually confirmed right in front of him. And here he’d been sweating for days over Peter’s invite to come over and have dinner with his family because he thought he’d be faced with a family like the Dursleys.

Well, part of Harry’s nerves came from the odds of being faced with Dursley-like relatives, the other part came from Peter himself.

“Where is Peter?” Mr Parker asked May after grabbing a bag of sugar and plopping it on the table and scooping some into his glass.

May grinned as she sipped her tea. “Showering.”

“Again?” Mr Parker chuckled and shook his head. “I guess it’s his age.”

A confusing statement, as Harry had showered at every age of his life.

“I think it’s Harry,” May said, she smiled at Harry and Harry was struck by how much he missed Ron’s mum, who had always felt like a pseudo-mum to him. “Peter talks a lot about you, you know.”

Harry bit back his retort that clearly he wasn’t as secretive as she just said then, and instead nodded. “He’s really my only friend here. Well, and Gwen, I suppose.”

“You’ve met Gwen?” Mr Parker asked. “She’s a good girl, smart as a whip too!”

“Ben’s a bit infatuated with her,” May whispered conspiratorially to Harry with a wink. “He thought he’d be getting Gwen as a niece-in-law one day.”

“Oh, bah.” Mr Parker waved his hand, nearly knocking over the bag of sugar. “You drop that nonsense, May, I told you when Peter was seven that he was going to be gay.”

Harry was startled by that easily spoken admission of something that would have had his own uncle screaming about poofs and queers.

“You, er… you’re fine with that, then?” Harry asked hesitantly, ducking his head when both adults turned to him.

“Of course we are,” May said firmly, driving Harry to pick his head back up, though he kept his eye on his teacup as he took a sip. “We’ve loved that boy his whole life—”

“From the instant he was born,” Mr Parker added fondly.

“It makes no difference to us if Peter brings home a sweet girl or a quiet boy,” May said. “He’s ours and we’ll always love him.”

Harry nodded and felt his throat tighten as he was faced with another acknowledgment that he always logically knew, but still left a bad taste in his mouth. Not only were some people’s aunts and uncles perfectly lovely seeming people, but… but they were perfectly lovely people who loved their relatives even if they did get forced to raise them. The Parkers probably spent as much on Peter as the Dursleys did Harry, and yet they said they’d always love him.

It wasn’t a new revelation, but Harry realized that life could truly be unfair sometimes.

Mr Parker cleared his throat and gave Harry a crooked grin. “Did Peter ever tell you what he wanted to be before he decided to become some photographer scientist?”

Harry tilted his head curiously and shook it. “No, sir.”

Peter didn’t even tell Harry he wanted to be a scientist. Harry imagined it was quite a bit like what Bruce and Tony did and wondered if they would mind letting Peter look around their labs? Sure, Harry would probably have to be nice to them for a while beforehand, but they were the best two out of the group anyway, besides Pepper of course.

“You’ll like this then,” Mr Parker chuckled. “Harry, you call me Ben, and May, go fetch those albums, will you? My back isn’t what it used to be,” he added with a cheery wink toward Harry.

“Ben…” May said in a warning tone. “Peter’s going to get on to you if you go showing his friend those photos.”

“Nah,” Ben grinned. “I’m sure Harry’s parents have albums full of embarrassing photos of him they can show Peter, right, son?”

Harry forced a smile on his face and jerked his head in a noncommittal nod.

Another reminder that life was truly unfair.

Harry would have given anything to have his parents, have a family, be able to embarrass him with baby photos. But photos of Harry between one and eleven simply didn’t exist.

 

Despite Harry’s mixed emotions, when May did bring out the thick photobook they had, and Ben revealed what little five year old Peter with his gapped teeth and bright eyes wanted to be when he grew up, Harry was in stitches as he laughed.

“He makes a pretty damn cute princess, doesn’t he?” Ben laughed with Harry.

“WHAT?!”

Harry looked up and his uncontrollable laughter was made worse as Peter skid in the room, his wet hair dripping on his shoulders, and his eyes horrified as he stopped in the doorway and stared at the book.

Harry quickly looked away, his face suddenly burning as he considered the odd series of texts he had exchanged with Peter that led to him being invited to meet Peter’s family.

Tony had irritated Harry into texting Peter, a simple ‘hey’ that he assumed would go unanswered. Peter responded almost immediately with a ‘hey’ and one thing led to another until Harry confided in him that he was debating on going to Midtown in the fall and that he was worried he’d flunk out immediately. Peter offered to hold a ‘study date’ at his house and let Harry ‘meet his family’.

And study date sounded a hell of a lot like ‘date’ so Harry had stared at his phone hard for a while, debating if he could or should have a date with a bloke…

Then he text back a simple acceptance and surprised himself by actually showing up.

“Uncle Ben, how could you betray me?” Peter groaned as he moved further in the kitchen.

“Betray you? He had to do something to entertain your guest while you took your sweet time in the shower,” May tsk’d at her nephew, sounding fond instead of stern.

“I was in there for five minutes!” Peter cried. “And you break out the baby photos?”

“Baby photos were five minutes ago, we’re onto Halloween photos,” Harry told him with a grin. “Where’d you get the dress?”

“I made it,” May answered for Peter. She smiled up at her nephew and Harry couldn’t doubt the love in her eyes.

“And some neighborhood brat called him a freak and what did our Peter do?” Ben puffed his chest up proudly. “Thumped him just once while wearing his pretty pink dress.”

“And I was grounded for a week,” Peter said, rolling his eyes at Harry and propping himself against the kitchen doorway with a small grin.

Ben winked at Harry before shaking a finger at Peter, “Did I let you finish trick or treating though?”

“You did,” May said with her own small smile. “You spoil that boy, Ben Parker.”

“Well, I think he turned out just fine,” Ben said confidently. He smiled at Peter, who easily returned the smile even if he looked mildly embarrassed, before looking at Harry and raising his grey eyebrows. “Wouldn’t you agree, Harry?”

“Okay then, that is enough,” Peter laughed and ran a hand through his wet hair, pushing his fringe back before it ultimately flopped in his face again. “Harry, you ready to study?”

“Yes,” Harry said, trying to not sound too eager. It was just… it was so bloody unfair. Ben and May seemed lovely, and they obviously loved their nephew, even though Peter wasn’t ‘normal’. And, no, he wasn’t a wizard, but Harry never dressed up like a princess either.

Harry thanked May for the tea and Ben for the photos then followed Peter up the stairs and into…

“Bloody hell,” Harry grinned as Peter shut his bedroom door. “I forgot the paint.”

Peter hadn’t been exaggerating. His walls, what was visible of them beneath a variety of posters for bands and photographs he must have taken himself, were actually pink.

“Oh, it’s fine.” Peter flopped himself on his bed, throwing a dramatic arm over his face. “Since it’s apparently my favorite color.”

Harry laughed and sat in the black chair in front of a desk covered in paper and a computer. “They love you, it’s nice,” he said lightly. He plucked up one of the papers on Peter’s desk, grimacing at the equations and numbers that seemed to blur together in front of his eyes. “Blimey, is this math?”

Peter sat up and gave Harry a curious look before squinting at the paper Harry held. “Chemistry,” he said. He tilted his head at Harry while Harry hastily dropped the paper as if he were burnt. “England not big on chem?”

“Not where I went to school,” Harry snorted. He ran a weary hand over his face, feeling overwhelmed by how much muggle knowledge he didn’t know. “This- this is mad, I can’t go to Midtown.”

It had been a stupid idea. Harry was a wizard, he- he wasn’t made for muggle stuff like high school and chemistry.

He hadn’t done math in over four years.

Hogwarts was barmy, why would they not continue math courses?! It wasn’t as if the students wouldn’t have to one day work their own finances!

“Were you like really bad at school?” Peter asked, he didn’t sound judgmental, just curious.

Harry scowled up at the ceiling of Peter’s room. “I am… better at hands on learning,” he said slowly, choosing his words carefully. “I’m okay at essays and stuff, but I’m terrible at science and math and,” Harry glanced down at the sheet of paper on Peter’s desk and scrunched his nose up, “chemistry.”

“Perfect!” Peter was smiling, god he smiled a lot, it was distracting. “I am terrible at essays, so you can help me in English, I’ll help you with other classes, and we can both fail gym together!”

Harry sent a pointed look up at the framed award on the wall behind Peter’s desk, even he knew what honor roll meant, but he smiled back all the same.

“Alright then,” he said, a challenge in his eyes, “let’s see if you can explain chemistry to me.”

 

An hour later, Harry and Peter were sitting cross-legged on his bed, an open book and a plate of actual warm homemade chocolate chip cookies from Peter’s aunt, sat between them.

“This is impossible,” Harry scowled, his voice rough as he stared down at the book and blinked his irritation out of his eyes. It didn’t matter how much Peter tried to explain it, Harry didn’t even understand the basics of the damn equations.

“Hey.” Peter slowly reached out and lifted Harry’s chin, his hand warm and soft. He kept his hand there and grinned at Harry, “We’ve got all summer to work on it.”

Harry was once more distracted, Peter’s face was very close to his, and his hand was on Harry’s face, and was he leaning in? and—

Harry leaned forward and hesitated for less than an instant before he kissed Peter.

The fireworks were there again, explosions in his stomach for his daring, fire racing through his chest in time to his loudly beating heart, and a certainty that he had questioned last time, but was confident this time—

I am gay.

Peter’s hand moved from Harry’s chin to his cheek, cupping his jaw, pulling him closer, and eliciting a small gasp that drove Peter to deepen the kiss rather than end it this time. Harry tentatively brought his hand up, tangling his fingers in Peter’s soft hair. Peter actually opened his mouth, a noise that felt like an especially harsh explosion in Harry’s stomach poured from his mouth. Their teeth clicked together when Peter used his free hand to brace himself against the wall behind Harry, his torso pushing against Harry’s and causing Harry to tilt his chin up, not wanting to lose contact with him.

If Harry had ever been so filled with excitement, every nerve standing on edge, he didn’t remember. He didn’t want to fit in a box, not if fitting outside them felt like this. He just—

Knock. Knock.

“Boys? Keep the door open, huh?”

Harry yanked Peter’s hair, pushing him away from him, his face burning at Ben’s voice on the other side of the door.

“Jesus.” Peter gasped then laughed quietly. “Will do!” he called toward the door.

They waited until the footsteps in the hall disappeared and Harry’s heart slowed down to an almost normal rhythm.

Harry wasn’t sure if he was more embarrassed at nearly being caught or his obvious interest in Peter being… well, obvious, or—

“Hey, Harry?”

Harry hummed and looked at Peter’s shoulder instead of his face.

“You’re- you’re gay, right?”

Harry’s eyes flew to Peter’s. Peter was smiling like he’d just won the quidditch World Cup, his eyes filled with amusement, so Harry grabbed the pillow he’d been leaning against and quickly smacked him with it, causing Peter to laugh loudly. Harry rolled his eyes, fighting his own smile, when Peter snatched the pillow from him and tossed it on the floor.

He cleared his throat, tried to look like anything that didn’t resemble a tomato. “I mean, er… bisexual, at a minimum, I guess.”

Peter laughed again then jumped off the bed, dutifully opening the door, and then plopped down in his desk chair, leaving too much space between them.

“If I’m over there we’ll never get anything done,” he explained with a teasing look. “Come on, let’s make a nerd out of you, Bright Eyes.”

Harry groaned- he’d actually rather go back to snogging, but he sat upright and reluctantly nodded. “No more chemistry,” he said. “I can’t handle it.”

“Cool, we can do algebra instead, it’s way easier.”

 

It was not ‘way easier’.

 

By the time May called up for them, telling them dinner was done and ending their study session, Harry was certain that going to Illvermony would be his best bet. At least there he’d just go back to being ‘Harry Potter the Boy-Who-Lived’ instead of ‘Harry Stark the Idiot’.

And when dinner was finished, the entire meal being filled with fond teasing, genuine seeming smiles, and just overall leaving an aching sense of jealousy in Harry’s chest, and Harry made it back home, he’d planned on telling Tony he made up his mind.

“Hey, kid.” Tony was spread out on the sofa, some sort of holographic screen lit up above his face that he drew complex designs on with his finger. He glanced over at Harry, then did a double take and quirked a brow at whatever expression Harry was making. “Good study session then?”

Harry took a deep breath, “Midtown,” he blurted. “Er… I’ll probably flunk out in a week, but when school starts, if- if it’s still an option, I want to go to Midtown.”

Tony narrowed his eyes at Harry for a long moment while Harry’s heart raced, afraid that now that he’d admitted what he truly wanted, it would be denied.

“Sounds good,” Tony said, turning back to his screen and flicking his finger across it, changing the design he had been drawing. “Think we can see if your friend Gwen wants to tutor you?”

Harry had barely processed that Tony merely said ‘sounds good’, no… no nothing, just ‘sounds good’, before he frowned at the question.

“Gwen? Why?”

Tony grinned and kept his eyes on the screen he worked on. “How much studying did you and Peter actually get done today?”

Harry’s face was once again bright red as he scowled and tried to maintain his dignity as he made his way to his room to get Joey to take him out.

“Not that it’s your business, but all we did was study,” he lied firmly.

Tony laughed, “Sure, kid. Hey, has your godfather given you the talk? Because someone should. I’m not going to, because I don’t know it, but I can get Pepper on it.”

Since Joey was asleep in Harry’s bed, Harry shot a glare at Tony and curled his lip up in a sneer.

“I do not need ‘the talk’, goodnight.”

Tony was still laughing when Harry closed his door firmly.

 

Merlin.

Apparently Tony didn’t need baby photos to embarrass Harry, he was doing just fine by simply speaking. In fact, maybe it was a good thing he didn’t have any photos of Harry to show people, he sort of seemed like the kind of person to think they were ‘funny’ while they were actually mortifying, a bit like Peter’s uncle, really.

 

Harry considered it later, while he laid in bed and stared up at the ceiling, and… and he probably wouldn’t have cared too much if Tony did have awkward photos of Harry as a kid. It would have been nice just to have photos of himself at different ages. Instead, Harry had one photo of himself as a newborn in his mum’s arms, one photo of himself in a high chair with his dad behind him, both of them covered in icing from a cake, and then nothing until Christmas break in his first year, a group photo with the Weasley boys as they all showed off their knitted jumpers.

Ten years of Harry’s life, missing.

 

Life was incredibly unfair at times.

Chapter Text

Friday, July 2nd

Hermione had been under no illusions that it would be a calm or good summer. With Voldemort back? It absolutely would not be.

She just hadn’t expected one of her best friends to go missing three weeks in to the summer holiday.

Grimmauld Place, Sirius’ home and the headquarters for the Order of the Phoenix, got darker and more grim every day that Harry remained missing. Oddly enough, Sirius did not share that growing grimness. In fact, in Hermione and Ron’s opinions, Sirius had gotten more and more cheery the further summer went on.

The twins thought that Sirius was simply heartbroken and mad, and perhaps he was, but his eyes were clear and he hummed songs when nobody was around. And Ginny said maybe Sirius didn’t give a damn about Harry, his bond broken by twelve years around dementors, but Hermione knew that Harry talked to his godfather every single day last year. Even when Harry wouldn’t talk to her, when he was withdrawn and pale and miserable, she heard him whispering in his mirror to Sirius at night. So, no, Sirius didn’t just stop caring about Harry.

Plus, Sirius was truly insufferable when he threw his tantrums. It wasn’t just seeing a grown man acting like an angry child, it was the way that he seemed to take pleasure in terrifying everyone and then skipped off to his bedroom with clear eyes and a queer smile on his lips. Hermione had grown to appreciate Sirius last year when he seemed to be holding Harry’s broken pieces together by himself, but he was wearing on her patience.

So Hermione didn’t feel too badly when she saw Sirius slip out the front door as a dog and her and Ron broke in to his bedroom.

“He’s bloody paranoid, isn’t he?” Ron panted after the two of them finally broke in to his room, putting both of their efforts and some of the twins’ more targeted items to use.

“People with things to hide usually are,” Hermione said firmly. She crinkled her nose at Sirius’ disgusting bedroom and bowed her head at the half-asleep hippogriff in the corner of the room. “Don’t break anything, but let’s tear this room apart, Ron.”

Ron cracked his knuckles and nodded with a determined set to his jaw.

Sirius might be Harry’s godfather, but he was hiding something and if it had to do with Hermione’s best friend’s safety then she would find it.

It was… it was actually rather simple.

Ron merely opened Sirius’ closet while Hermione began sifting through his bedside table and coughed.

“Hermione?”

Hermione turned around and saw Ron nudge a familiar trunk with his foot.

“That- that bastard!” Hermione swore, startling Ron. She stormed over to the closet and opened the trunk and felt her chest tighten to a painful level to see Harry’s usual mishmash assortment of belongings. His books, his parchment, his broomstick and servicing kit, uniforms and ties and his sneakscope stuffed in a sock, and—

“His wand isn’t here,” Ron said, apparently keeping track as Hermione dug. “Neither’s that mirror he carries.”

“Or his dad’s cloak,” Hermione said. As much anger as she felt at Sirius for hiding something about Harry, she also felt a crushing relief that Harry must be fine. Ever since they sent a letter off to him with the owl Sirius loaned George, Hermione had been unable to even sleep at night as she prayed to every God she could think of that Harry was alive, Harry would get their letter, Harry would come home.

But if Harry had his wand, his mirror, and his cloak- he had to be alive. He’d kept himself alive with each item individually—

Harry and his cloak, sneaking around the castle, trying to find answers to mysteries to protect himself.

Harry returning to the common room in the early hours with bloodshot and puffy eyes; withdrawn and miserable. Harry detaching himself from all the things that used to make him happy. Harry using his mirror and his connection to his godfather to keep him alive.

Harry and his wand, standing on his feet, tortured and terrified, looking Voldemort in the eyes and defiantly choosing to live.

—if Harry had those things, then he was staying alive.

“Alive then?” Ron whispered, as if speaking too loudly would burst the fragile bubble of hope Harry’s trunk brought them.

Hermione closed her eyes and wished she could see Harry’s face in more than just her memory. “Alive,” she said softly. “I- I hope.”

Being uncertain was the worst part, but if Sirius had Harry’s trunk, then he had answers.

And Hermione would rip every tooth from his mouth if he refused to give them to her now.

“Keep digging?” Ron asked tentatively. He looked around Sirius’ room and also seemed to finally take in the disgusting way Sirius kept it. “Merlin, it stinks in here.”

It truly did. It smelled like old food, mold, a musky animal odor, and a general scent of filth.

Unfortunately, Hermione had to sit on the foot of Sirius’ bed and hold one of Harry’s scarves tightly in her hand.

“We don’t need to dig,” she said. “We need to wait.”

Ron chuckled and sat beside Hermione on the bed, leaning against the bedpost and crossing his arms. “Wicked, so it’s an ambush.”

Hermione grinned, a twist of her lips more than a look of joy, and she leaned against the opposite bedpost from Ron as she twisted the scarf in her hands. She met Ron’s blue eyes and felt a fierce sort of relief at knowing he wouldn’t leave her to face Sirius alone.

“It’s an ambush,” she agreed.

 

They had to wait a few hours, a few hours of ignoring the sounds of Molly cleaning the house, Kreacher yelling vulgarities in the halls, and the twins calling their names. Nobody looked in Sirius’ room, half the house was terrified of him and the other half felt pity for him. It was the perfect place to wait.

And when the doorknob finally turned slowly, Hermione and Ron snapped upright to their feet, wands in hand, just as ready to fight Sirius for their friend as they’d been at the end of their third year.

Sirius bound in the room, his wand already in hand, and his eyes flicked between Hermione and Ron as he kicked the door shut behind him.

“It’s not good manners to go through people’s belongings,” he said, eyeing Harry’s scarf Hermione held.

“Yeah? Well it’s not nice to hide people’s belongings either,” Ron sneered.

Hermione adored him.

She watched Sirius carefully as Ron’s accusation struck him and saw the tick in his jaw and the look in his eyes. He wasn’t scared of their brandished wands aimed at his chest any more than he was scared of their knowledge that he knew something about Harry. He was determined- his grip on his steady wand was tight, his shoulders were squared, and Hermione hoped his determination was solely for Harry’s protection.

Sirius was actually quite terrifying when he wanted to be. Not when he was acting like a madman, but in moments when he wasn’t acting at all and Hermione realized he was rather intelligent and powerful and staring at her as if deciding the fate he would bestow on her head.

“We’re worried about him,” Hermione said softly, hoping to melt the determined look on Sirius’ face. They had a common goal, they didn’t need to be testing each other. “Please, Sirius, we just want to know he’s okay.”

Sirius flicked his wand, and it was all Hermione could do to not flinch. A buzz settled around the three of them though, a nonverbal muffling charm Hermione didn’t know.

The three of them kept their wands raised, but a small amount of tension seemed to leak out of the room with Sirius’ spell.

“A lot of people want to know where Harry is,” Sirius said slowly. “Unfortunately, nobody knows, right?”

Ron opened his mouth, but Hermione elbowed him lightly as she weighed Sirius’ words. The words themselves were a dismissal, but Hermione got the feeling they weren’t quite that.

“I said we want to know that Harry is safe,” Hermione stressed. “Others want to know where the Boy-Who-Lived is, we want to know where our best friend is.”

Ron must have picked up on Sirius’ peculiar phrasing as well because he added, “And nobody knows that his stuff is in your closet.”

Sirius’ shoulders relaxed and he lowered his wand. Ron let out a quiet breath and lowered his as well.

Hermione kept hers up though, Sirius was mad and she wasn’t certain that she trusted him.

“You know occlumency?” Sirius asked.

Ron looked toward Hermione, but she had her brow furrowed in confusion. Sirius was… was annoyingly much more intelligent than she thought. The wards, the silent spells, the knowledge of magic she didn’t know…

“No,” she finally admitted after wracking her mind for the unfamiliar term. “What is it?”

“It’s a way to keep others from plucking thoughts from your mind,” Sirius said bluntly. He leaned against his door and stuck his hands in his front trouser pockets in a casual stance. “It’s a way to keep information locked inside so that nobody untrustworthy can access it.”

“Like Snape?” Ron guessed shrewdly.

Sirius’ lips twisted mockingly and he jerked his chin. “Snivellus is one,” he said lightly.

But… Hermione squinted at Sirius as she would a tricky Arithmancy problem… but Professor Snape (Snivellus was a terrible nickname and Hermione couldn’t believe Sirius used it) wasn’t who he was thinking of, she was sure of it.

“And there’s another,” Hermione said slowly, puzzling it out as she went. “Someone else you’re hiding Harry from…” She chewed her lip for a moment while Sirius watched her with a bland face. “Not… not Professor Dumbledore?” she breathed.

It was absurd, but the almost imperceptible tightening of Sirius’ eyes told her that was exactly who Sirius meant.

“Why?” Ron blurted, bemused and incredulous. “He wants Harry safe too!”

Sirius raised a brow, his mouth kept closed and his face impassive, leaving them to puzzle it out.

Hermione slowly lowered her wand, keeping it at her side as she watched Sirius and tapped her thigh in deep thought.

“Harry asked Professor Dumbledore if he could stay with Sirius this summer,” Hermione said. Sirius didn’t react, so he clearly already knew. Ron jolted at her side though.

“Did he? When? Why did Dumbledore send him to the Dursleys then?”

“He told Harry he would be safest there,” Hermione told Ron. She saw a shadow cross Sirius’ face, causing him to look truly dangerous for an instant before she blinked and it was gone.

“Harry isn’t safe there though,” Ron said. Hermione didn’t have to look to see the scowl that was surely on his face. If anyone knew how unsafe and unhappy Harry was with his relatives, it was the brave boy who broke him out in a flying car with his brothers. “Harry didn’t tell me though…” Ron added quietly. “I would have wrote Mum, had her pester Dumbledore about it…”

Hermione finally did turn from Sirius to wrap a consoling arm around Ron’s waist and tilt her head to his shoulder.

“Harry was upset,” she said, remembering Harry’s broken look of misery when he told Hermione about his talk with Dumbledore. He hadn’t cried, Harry never cried where Hermione could see him, always comforting himself in the heartbreaking way he did, but he looked close to it that night.

“He just didn’t want you to see him like that,” Hermione reassured Ron.

Ron shrugged, nearly dislodging Hermione’s head from his shoulder, but she knew that he would be berating himself for turning his back on Harry during the brief few months that their friendship had been broken.

“Odd that a Headmaster would get to say where a kid spent his summer holiday, isn’t it?” Sirius said as casually as if he were speaking about the weather. “One of the problems of Harry not having a true guardian, I guess.“

None of the three said anything after that. Hermione watched Sirius and Sirius watched them.

The air felt thick with secrets and implications and agendas in a war that Hermione couldn’t begin to unravel.

Finally, Sirius pulled his left hand from his pocket and held out a sheet of normal lined writing paper to Ron.

“Read it now,” he ordered him. “Then I’m burning it and if you say a single word about it, I’ll obliviate you.”

Sirius’ voice was flat, perfectly serious. It was more effective than a death threat- it would be hard to kill them, easy to wipe this perplexing encounter from their minds.

Ron accepted the paper with a lightly shaking hand and he held it up so they could both read it as he unfolded it.

    Guys,
    I’m fine. I’m sorry.
    -Harry

That was it.

“Six bloody words?!” Ron demanded. He waved the paper around angrily. “How do we even know Harry wrote this?!”

Hermione snorted weakly, her eyes tearing up at the undoubtable proof that Harry was alive.

“Because it would have been longer if it were someone impersonating him,” she said. She snatched the paper from Ron and stared hard at Harry’s signature. It was odd, because Hermione had never seen Harry’s writing done with what seemed to be a normal pencil on lined notebook paper, but that was Harry’s cramped scrawl.

And it was just like Harry to go missing and say he was ‘fine’. Voldemort was back. Harry was gone. He’d been through so much, Harry never got a break, but Harry was always ‘fine’.

Hermione despised the word.

“He’s safe?” Ron asked Sirius when Hermione took a last look at Harry’s handwriting and handed the letter back over.

Sirius held the paper by the corner of it and put his wand tip at the bottom corner, incinerating it silently once more.

“He’s safe,” Sirius said. He remained in front of the door and narrowed his eyes threateningly. “Tell me now if I need to wipe your memory or if you can keep this to yourselves.”

Ron looked over at Hermione and she saw the same confidence that she had— if Harry was alive and safe, that was good enough for now.

“We can keep a secret, you know,” Hermione sniffed. “Perhaps you forgot who helped Harry save you from the dementors, Sirius?”

Sirius’ tight expression softened slightly, he still kept his wand pointed at the two of them though. “How sure are you that you won’t slip up and tell Ginny or Molly?”

Ron scoffed, “Pretty damn sure, mate. We never accidentally told anyone about you, did we?”

Sirius smiled and stepped closer, “Excellent. I don’t suppose you’d mind making a little vow between the three of us then?”

Ron paled, but Hermione drew herself up to her full height, which wasn’t much when compared to Ron and Sirius.

“Tell us who is watching over Harry and I’ll take any vow you want,” she said. She’d assumed it was Sirius, but Harry used muggle supplied to write back to them and Hermione had never seen Sirius use a muggle pencil before.

Sirius waited before Ron grunted out an agreement to tell them.

“His father, and I won’t say anything else,” he said, sending Hermione and Ron both in a tailspin of shock—

James Potter was dead.

So who the hell was Harry’s father?!

 

“Hands together now, time for your first Unbreakable Vow, kids.”

 

Ten minutes later, Hermione and Ron slipped out of Sirius’ room, both too stunned over what they learned to even have the swear on their lives to worry about.

“Not here,” Hermione told him when Ron opened his mouth and looked ready to discuss it. Between the portraits, the Order members arriving for their meeting, Kreacher, and the twins, Sirius’ room was truly the only safe room to talk in and he had ushered them away right after they swore to not discuss what he told them and they discovered with anyone outside of himself and each other.

Harry being with his father was… well, it was both horrendously wild and also made perfect sense. Hermione had always just assumed that Harry looked like one of his grandparents or something since he didn’t look like photos she’d seen of James at all, and he only resembled his mum in the color and shape of his eyes.

Also, insane things always happened to Harry, and this was perhaps the best insane thing to ever happen to him and Hermione hoped very desperately that Harry was enjoying having a parent.

“It’s wicked though, right?” Ron whispered directly in Hermione’s ear as they walked, his lips tickling her earlobe and causing a furious blush to spread across her face. “Who d’you reckon it is?”

Hermione breathed slowly, willing the burn on her face to ease up, and ushered Ron in to the bedroom she shared with Ginny. She looked all over and saw that Ginny was absent, probably getting ready to eavesdrop on the meeting with the twins.

“No idea,” Hermione told Ron in a hushed tone. “Sirius said we could write again though and he’d make sure he got it, so let’s do that and then go see if we can learn anything else with the others.”

Ron smiled, his smile more genuine now that they had a true reassurance of Harry’s continuing life, and it only took them a little over fifteen minutes to pen a reply to their best friend. Once they were done and Hermione rolled it up tightly, intending to slip it to Sirius after the meeting, they snuck off to find Fred, George, and Ginny.

It had become a tradition for them to eavesdrop on meetings together. Hermione had balked at first, wary about listening to war planning, but then she realized almost all the meetings were about Harry and her morals about eavesdropping were gone.

“That’s it!” Hermione screeched, yanking Ron to a stop in the middle of the stairs they had been descending. She pulled him down so this time she could whispered directly in his ear. “All the meetings are about Harry because the war is going to put him in danger and that’s why Sirius won’t tell Professor Dumbledore where Harry is,” she said quickly, some of her words running together in her excitement at solving the puzzle. “Sirius took Harry away from all of it!”

Ron straightened up and smiled down at her; her own happiness reflected in his freckled face. “Wicked,” he said simply before ruining Hermione’s excitement, “Sirius has a set of bollocks, doesn’t he?”

“Ew.” Hermione swatted his arm and they resumed walking. “I do not want to think about that, thank you very much.”

Ron laughed, a sorely missed sound as they hadn’t had anything to laugh about the last month while they’d been worried about Harry.

“What’s so funny?” Ginny murmured as they joined them on the second floor landing. She handed over two extendable ears while Fred and George nodded at them, their own ears already in place.

“Kreacher walked in to the wall,” Ron lied baldly as he passed one of the ears Ginny offered to Hermione. “We miss anything?”

“Nah, they’re waiting on Dumbledore,” Fred whispered.

“Sit down and shut up,” George added briskly.

Hermione rolled her eyes, but slid to the floor, crossing her legs and popping the extendable ear in her own ear.

They were brilliant inventions and reminded Hermione of when she would see the neighbors kids giggle and share secrets in tin cans with strings attached. She’d always wanted to join them, but she never got invited to share secrets with those kids.

 

She would have kept their secrets just as she did for her friends now, if only they’d given her a chance.

 

The five of them sat in silence, only Ron moving as he scratched Crookshanks ears while he slept on Ron’s lap, and they listened to the light small talk happening in the dining room.

Eventually the small talk ended as there was a door opening and closing, probably Professor Dumbledore whose voice had been absent and who always used the kitchen entrance of the house.

“I have news.”

They all perked up at the familiar and commanding voice of their Headmaster.

“We have found Harry.”

Crookshanks yelped as Ron accidentally smacked him in the face in his rush to turn a horrified look to Hermione.

Oh.

Oh no.

No.

That…

That wasn’t good at all.

    A birthday of unwanted surprise guests.

    Don’t fret please, but I won’t be updating for a few weeks while I write my Flufftober 2022 pieces & try to finish my IRL book before my deadline so I can, ya know, maybe make money for my hyperfixations one day.
    Abandoned? Absolutely not. Never! This is a very brief hiatus, a month at absolute max (but I’m a weak woman and will likely sneak back before I should).
    If you want to talk about all things Harry Potter or Marvel in the meantime, I have a Discord and LSMH has its own channel.

    I’ll see you soon, pinky swear. 😉

    Flufftober is going great. I’ve gotten nearly 35k words wrote. Unfortunately, that’s just for the first three days. 😂

    My muse kept sliding back here though, and I regret to inform you that this is not Harry’s birthday, but is instead something else.

    Lower your torches, Harry’s very eventful birthday is next chapter.

    Thank you all for somehow making this my top rated WIP in one month. 😂

Chapter Text

July 30

Tony slumped over the kitchen bar, his face buried in his hands, even the scent of coffee brewing not enough to pull him from his slump.

It had been a long night, and it was beginning to look like his day wouldn’t be any easier.

It started at ten with a text from Sirius, a simple and ominous thing:

Albus knows you have Harry.

Tony had called him, needing to know what the wizards knew, and Sirius didn’t know much past that.

“I’m being kept out of the loop now,” he grumbled, sounding as if he were grinding his teeth together. “It’s pretty damn obvious I was the one who spilled the ‘James isn’t your dad’ beans to Harry and now Albus isn’t telling me jack shit.”

Tony tried to get Sirius to tail the wizard who wanted his son to fight in a war (and for the love of God, Harry hadn’t even turned fifteen yet), but Sirius said ‘Albus’ went back to Hogwarts, where Sirius apparently couldn’t follow.

He did tell Tony that he didn’t think Albus would resort to kidnapping (or attempted, anyway, as Tony was confident he could take on a 100 year old wizard). Tony still sent an update to the team, putting them all on red alert.

If the wizards wanted the kid, they had a hell of a fight coming.

It was unfortunate that there was no way to contact Thor, but Tony still liked their odds without him.

 

Then, after barely just falling asleep, Tony got a rude wake up call in the form of seventeen phone calls from Rhodey a little after two.

 

“Someone better be dead,” Tony grumbled when he answered the eighteenth call. He didn’t even open his eyes, content to talk over speaker and hang up the instant he found out why his longest friend thought it was a good idea to irritate the hell out of him in the middle of the night.

“Yeah, you, you prick.”

Tony snorted, practically a snore. “Fantastic. I’ll just plan my funeral in the morning then.”

“There’s a good photo of you that’s going to be spread nationwide in the morning, I’ll use it for your obituary after I’ve snapped your damn neck.”

“Good picture, huh?” Tony asked, nuzzling his pillow, bored and ready to be asleep again.

“Oh yeah, you look great. So does your god damned son.”

Tony sat up immediately, wide awake, and snatched his cell off his nightstand so he could pull up a video feed. Rhodey looked pissed, but he usually did.

“They got a photo of Harry?”

Rhodey scoffed. “Nice name for the kid you never told me about.”

“Sorry, dear, he was a shock to me too,” Tony said with a roll of his eyes. “Let me see the picture.”

Rhodey sent it through immediately. “It already hit stations on the west coast, you’ll be swamped in the morning.”

Tony nearly smiled at the cell phone quality photo of Tony and Harry walking Harry’s dog down the sidewalk. Tony had one of his hands up, mid-explanation of something, and Harry looked much too patiently amused for a teenager.

It was a good photo, it didn’t explain how it uncovered the buried birth certificate that was created when Tony established his paternal claim though.

“Don’t you dare ask,” Rhodey warned him, proving that only someone who spent nearly thirty years as Tony’s friend could pluck a question right from his mind. “He looks just like you. Hell, if he wasn’t so skinny I’d think you just finally figured out how to clone yourself.”

“Not yet,” Tony said absently, reading through the article Rhodey attached with the photo. “Guess the cat’s out of the bag, huh?”

“You’re lucky nobody broke the news before now. How long have you known?”

“Couple months,” Tony admitted. He ignored the little angry face Rhodey was making at him and flopped back against his pillows.

“I am never talking to you again, Tony,” Rhodey said.

Tony rolled on his side and bat his lashes at the video feed hovering above his cell. “So you’re not coming to Harry’s birthday on Tuesday?”

Rhodey rolled his eyes that time. “Of course I am. I’m not missing my damn nephew’s birthday. Text me a list of shit he likes, you arrogant prick.”

“Will do, sweetheart, love you,” Tony grinned and hung up.

Rhodey had never been good at holding a grudge. And, yeah, okay, Tony should have told him about the kid before he found out in the news, but it wasn’t as if he hadn’t been busy.

Plus, as much as Harry wasn’t a fan of Tony’s other friends, the kid was going to love Rhodey.

 

Wide awake after that call, Tony went to check on the kid, paranoia plaguing him as he thought about the way wizards could just pop in and out of locations.

He nudged Harry’s door open, half his attention on the articles and video clips Rhodey buried his inbox in. He text his business manager, requesting they buy out the trashy tabloid that questioned Harry’s mental capabilities as Tony ‘was a well known drug addict’ who ‘supposedly recovered’.

It was more than a little insulting that Tony could save the damn world and nobody questioned his sobriety, but you have one secret kid and suddenly it was all ‘is he back on drugs?’

Tony poked his head in Harry’s room, a weight lifting off his chest when he saw Harry’s body beneath the white comforter on his bed. Harry was home, exactly where he was meant to be.

The weight he lost knowing his son hadn’t been kidnapped slammed right back at him when he lingered in the doorway long enough to see Harry suddenly thrash on his bed, his head turned toward Tony, and Tony could see the kid was drenched in sweat. Harry’s face was all twisted up and he looked like he was being tortured in whatever dream he was having.

It wasn’t that Tony hadn’t believed Sirius when he said Harry had PTSD and chronic nightmares, it was just that Harry looking utterly exhausted was a pretty regular look, so Tony thought maybe the kid slept just fine.

In hindsight, it was a pretty damn stupid thing to think.

Tony had taken a few steps in the room, his mind blank on how to deal with it. Did he wake him up? Hope it just passed? Call Pepper and have her figure it out?

The last idea had merit, actually.

Before Tony could dial Pepper’s number, Harry suddenly bolted upright, a strangled scream wrenching from his throat. Tony darted forward, a desperate urge to reassure Harry that he was fine, he was safe, he was at home, but instead the kid clocked his hand from the corner of his eyes, screamed again, and fell out of his bed.

“Woah, careful.” Tony offered a hand, wincing when Harry flinched away from it. Not his best idea, clearly.

Harry’s eyes were frantic, flickering around while Tony shifted uneasily.

Should he crouch down? Not stand so threateningly? Turn the light on? Call—

Woof!

A small little bundle of fur did a quick dive from the bed, landing on Harry’s bare chest where he was still sprawled on the floor, clutching at the bed frame behind him, searching the room for threats aside from Tony.

Tony watched as Harry immediately looked down at the dog nudging his chest and slowly shifted in to a more conventional sitting position while his glazed eyes focused on the dog. Tony had never been so grateful for the ever-shedding dog as he was when Harry buried a hand in its fur and began slowly petting him.

“So… that was fun,” Tony said after a long silent moment. The air was thick with the scent of sweat and fear, which Tony knew more than anyone carried its own specific odor. Harry’s eyes snapped up to Tony, but he didn’t flinch that time, he frowned.

“You want to talk about it?” Tony offered when Harry didn’t say anything.

Harry opened his mouth, then scrunched his nose and raised one of his hands to his forehead, pressing tight. “Headache,” he grunted, his eyes screwed shut in what seemed to be genuine pain. “Happens.”

“Yeaaah, I also have horrible nightmares when my head hurts.”

Harry looked paler than usual when he dropped his hand and grabbed the bed frame, his legs shaking as he got to his feet while ignoring Tony’s outstretched hand.

“Brilliant, go fucking cry about it somewhere else,” Harry muttered. He edged around his bed, moving to his closet where he snagged a tshirt and managed to get it on all without ever setting down the dog nuzzling his neck.

“I’m good.” Tony leaned against the wall beside the door and watched as Harry purposefully seemed to avoid eye contact with him. “Here’s an idea, you come take some tylenol and we can share our top three worst nightmares?”

Harry scoffed at his bare feet before raising defiant green eyes up at Tony. And Harry’s eye color and shape might be all Lily Potter, but that look in them was pure Tony.

“I said I didn’t have a nightmare.”

Tony hummed and figured it was late (early?), he was tired, they had a shit ton of problems to deal with, and maybe it wasn’t the time to push for a warm fuzzy conversation.

“Fine,” he said, reigning in his skepticism. “Tylenol and a snack then?”

Harry seemed to search Tony’s face for a moment, clocking his skepticism, but he still jerked his chin in a nod and gestured for Tony to lead the way.

 

Tony waited until Harry swallowed a few Tylenol and they both had a slice of leftover pizza in hand, the perfect three am snack, to broach the topic again.

“Get headaches often?” Tony asked when Harry rubbed his forehead, offering the perfect opening.

Harry dropped his hand immediately, giving Tony a brief glimpse of the inflamed looking scar on his forehead before he smoothed his hair down to cover it.

“No,” Harry said.

Tony had been pretty sure the kid was lying through his teeth. “How often?”

Harry picked a piece of pepperoni off his pizza, dropping it to the living room floor for the dog to snatch up.

“Every now and again,” Harry said vaguely. He waved his hand toward his forehead, “Cursed scar, you see.”

Tony did not see. He had been thinking migraines, maybe. He himself took pills for migraines on occasion, but a cursed scar…?

He was suddenly, and unhelpfully, reminded of what Clint said: “We can’t fight magic.”

“Ah.”

Harry smirked at him from the couch. “No brilliant plans for cursed scars then? Pity. Maybe that was why I didn’t mention it.”

Tony smirked right back at his son. “You might not know this, but I happen to be a genius, kid. Cursed scar, sursed car. I’ll find a solution, and in the meantime, Tylenol.”

How Tony was meant to find a solution for a magically cursed scar that gave his kid headaches, he had no idea. But he would.

He was beginning to think there was nothing he wouldn’t do for the kid.

 

After a couple of hours of watching a movie Tony was too tired to focus on, Harry had fallen asleep on the couch and Tony moved to the kitchen for some coffee.

And slumped over the kitchen counter, his face buried in his hands, was exactly where Steve found him an hour later.

“You look like hell,” Steve said bluntly. He had tiptoed past the snoring teenager on the couch, but didn’t hold that same kindness when he scraped a chair back to sit beside Tony, causing Tony to wince at the noise.

“Language, Cap,” Tony quipped, too worn out to even put his heart in teasing Steve.

“Long night?” Steve guessed.

“You’ve got no idea.”

Steve hummed and glanced toward the living room. “I saw Harry’s on the news, ‘Stark’s Secret Son’, it’s catchy.”

Tony snorted and drank some of his cold coffee. “They’re not even creative,” he said. “What about… ‘Clone or Kid: the Mystery Stark Question’?”

Steve didn’t look impressed, which was entirely fair because it wasn’t Tony’s best work.

“Yeah, yeah, I’m exhausted,” Tony defended himself.

“Kid looks rough too,” Steve said, looking at the snoring teenager again. “You guys fighting or something last night?”

“I wish,” Tony sighed. He scrubbed his hands over his face, grimacing at the scratch beneath his fingers which said he needed to shower and shave before he went down to his office for the day. “He had a headache,” he said evasively. He wasn’t going to discuss Harry’s nightmares with Steve.

“A headache,” Steve repeated, deadpan. He folded his hands on the counter and made his ‘I’m the good guy and you can trust me’ face. “You’ve got to get him in therapy, Tony. It can’t be healthy him just bottling all his past up on the inside. You can’t- can’t just love away the trauma. Trust me, I’ve seen some of the guys at the vet center after doing just that, it’s not pretty.”

“He’s my son, hence, everything he does is pretty,” Tony said. “And he’s a teenager, not a war veteran.”

The look Steve gave him would have been condescending if Tony didn’t know that Steve was perhaps the most genuine and guileless person in the damn world.

“PTSD doesn’t discriminate on experiences,” he said solemnly.

“That’s really inspirational, Cap,” Tony told him. He got up and stretched his back out. “Seriously, you should put that on your cereal boxes. Hey, you mind just…” Tony waved vaguely toward Harry, “standing by? Or whatever?”

“Sure.” Steve chuckled and relaxed in his seat. “Go shower, you stink and it’s weird seeing you in your fuzzy pjs.”

Tony raised his brows and quirked his lips up in a slight grin. “I’ll have you know these are silk, not fuzz, Cap. And I can get you fifty affidavits stating I look better without them on.”

Steve crinkled his nose. “Only fifty?”

“Fifty that live within fifty miles of me,” Tony acquiesced. “Alright, alright, I’ll be back,” he laughed when Steve looked like Tony had hurt his sense of purity and ‘waiting for love’. How the guy went through military training and still came out all pure and innocent was beyond Tony. Sure, he’d been a bit scraggly and thin before Tony’s dad tinkered on his physique, but even ugly guys could put on an army uniform and get laid.

 

Tony tried to rush his shower, knowing he did actually have a full day planned, but some things, like foreplay and hot showers, just couldn’t be rushed.

Neither could shaving. Or picking out clothes. Or any of the many menial tasks he completed for the sake of pushing off the workload he had waiting for him.

There would be media to address, a public statement to figure out. Tony had meetings with hopefuls who wanted him to invest in their inventions, a monthly occurrence that oftentimes bored him to drinking, but occasionally found an inventor with promise. There was also a meeting with the guys after lunch, scouting for another possibly Hydra base in Slovakia.

Then, of course, spending every minute trying to research cursed scars, headaches, keeping wizards from apparating in his house, and ‘how to convince your wizard son that he had problems he needed to get sorted out without pissing him off and getting stunned for it’.

Overall, a damn busy day.

 

After an hour of primping, stalling, and silently pouting, Tony returned to the kitchen to find Steve frying up bacon at the stove and Harry, still in his pajamas, frowning at his phone from his side of the kitchen counter.

“Morning,” Harry mumbled distractedly. He tapped aggressively at his screen, “Peter said I’m in the news.”

“You are,” Tony said, attempting to sound breezy and casual. “Pains of having a terribly famous dad, I’m afraid. Nothing to worry about.”

Unlike the wizards and the cursed scars.

Harry looked up from his phone, fixing Tony with an unimpressed expression straight from Tony’s own face. “Peter said the news is speculating on if I’m a bloody idiot because you were on drugs when you knocked up my mum.”

Steve’s lips twitched and Tony rolled his eyes up to the ceiling while he brewed two fresh cups of coffee for Harry and himself.

“Well tell Peter not to believe everything he reads in the paper.”

Harry snorted, “Story of my life,” he muttered before turning back to the phone and adorably typing out a message in the most angry manner Tony had ever seen. “Oh.” Harry looked up, “Do we have plans today?”

“Today? No,” Tony shrugged. He gave Harry the first cup of coffee and popped some of the bagels Pepper dropped off in the toaster while Steve took the bacon off the stove. “I have to work for a bit today.”

Harry raised a skeptical brow. “Work or building more owl chasing robots?”

“Owl chasing robots?” Steve asked. He divvied up the bacon on three plates, sliding one to Harry and leaving the second one on the counter for Tony before he stole an untoasted bagel, like a savage, and plopped down at the bar.

Tony rolled his eyes at Steve before turning back to Harry, “Hedwig loves her OWL.”

“Sure,” Harry drawled sarcastically. He picked up a piece of bacon and swung it around a bit, “Her, what was it? Owl whatever launcher?”

“An Owl Waking Launchpad,” Tony said with a smirk. “And she loves it.”

She did love it and it earned Tony both a grooming session from the OCD-seeming owl and a laugh from his kid.

“You’ve got too much free time on your hands,” Steve mumbled.

“But today I have actual work,” Tony said. He frisbee-style tossed a bagel to Harry, who snatched it with damn sharp reflexes, then put the second one on his place before he ticked items off his todo list as he said them. “One of the beta tested StarkCars we released blew a head gasket before the chick got it home, then I’ve got to meet with my inventors, and the team about a possible hydra base in Slovakia that’s trafficking humans, and I need to follow up on the whole possible sighting of Pettigrew, then—”

“What?” Harry, who actually always seemed to listen when Tony chatted about his work, startled in his seat. “Go back, explain,” he demanded curtly.

Tony wound him up a bit, if only because Harry gave out orders just as Tony did and they both seemed to suck at following them. “Hydra is a terrorist group and Steve had reason to believe—”

“Not that,” Harry scowled, interrupting him again. “Pettigrew? You found him?”

Tony held a finger up and waited to finish swallowing his bacon, ensuring that there was absolutely no confusion on the matter as Harry’s lips might have been turned downward in a frown, but his eyes were lit up with what seemed like hope.

“No,” he said firmly, feeling guilty for dashing that ray of hope in Harry’s eyes. Damn if it wouldn’t have felt better to say yes, just… just make the kid’s whole damn year with the news. “I’ve got facial recognition software running on every camera in the United Kingdom (and in the US, but he had those for all the wizards Sirius warned him about and managed to send photos of), I get alerts when there’s any 60% or above matches, based on the facial cues and a variety of programmed expression, and then I—”

“You know nobody aside from yourself cares about the technology behind what you’re saying, right?” Steve grinned.

Tony would have chuckled, brushed the reminder that he had a tendency to hyper-fixate on the minute mechanisms of something more than the big picture off his shoulder as he always did, but Harry didn’t seem to care much for Steve’s joke.

“Excuse you,” Harry said cooly, fixing his eyes unwaveringly on Steve, “I happen to care, so piss off.”

Steve raised his hands by his shoulders and glanced over at where Tony was sitting on the counter with a twinkle of laughter in his eyes. “My mistake, please, go on.”

“I will, thank you,” Tony said. He shot a wink at Harry, an odd warmth in his chest and the weight of his exhaustion lessening from his shoulders. “So here’s how it works…”

It was… incredibly validating, having Harry give Tony his rapt attention as he got caught up in the explanation. Steve looked bored, even began washing dishes while Tony still talked, but Harry asked questions, wanted terms he didn’t recognize clarified, and overall showed an interest that Tony very rarely got from others.

And, sure, Harry was probably just interested because he wanted Pettigrew found and his godfather’s name cleared, but still, it was nice. In fact…

“Hey, I’ve got an idea!” Tony had long since been standing on his feet, giving him more balance to gesture with his hands while he explained different things, and he rocked back on his heels with a grin. “This thing I’ve got today, with the inventors looking for investments, why don’t you come with me? Most of their shit sucks, but usually there’s at least one or two actually interesting ideas that Stark Industries invests in.”

Harry sat up in his seat, but twisted his lips to the side as he glanced at his cell. “What time?”

Tony glanced at his watch. “Five minutes from now. Lasts about an hour.”

“Tony!” Steve shook his head at him with the ‘I’m not mad, just disappointed’, exasperation only he could truly pull off. “You need to get going.”

“Can’t start until I’m there,” Tony said carelessly. “What about it, kid, want to come with?”

“Think we’ll be done by noon?” Harry asked slowly. “I was going to go over to Peter’s so he could help me with… with a project…”

Tony laughed, “If we aren’t done by eleven at the latest, I’ll ki— I’ll cancel the rest and reschedule them,” he said smoothly. “I, personally, don’t care if you wear your pajamas, but it’s up to you.”

Harry glanced down at himself, apparently not realizing he was still in his pajamas. “Er… right. Be right back.”

Steve waited until Harry closed his bedroom door to quirk a brow at Tony. “‘Kill myself’, right? That’s what you were going to say?”

Tony hummed. “Hey Jarvis, did you hear me say that?”

Jarvis, loyal robot assistance that he was, responded negatively almost immediately.

“That answers that,” Tony said brightly. He picked up Harry’s pup, figuring the kid would get a kick out of dragging his dog to meetings with him, and gave Steve a bland smile. “Sure was great to see you, bring cookies to the meeting later.”

Steve recognized the blatant dismissal and slowly made his way to the elevator. “Therapy, Tony,” he called over his shoulder. “For both of you.”

Tony rolled his eyes at Steve’s back. Unlike the kid, he didn’t need therapy. He needed to solve all his magical problems with nonmagical means, force the kid in therapy, perhaps sneak a bottle of bourbon down to the publicity meeting he had later, and enjoy spending time with his son while he worked.

 

And the pitches he sat through in his board room were a thousand times more bearable with Harry sitting at Tony’s side, making faces, writing down snarky comments, and occasionally asking important questions to the inventors.

 

“Isn’t that what a washing machine is for?” Harry asked the guy who pitched the idea of self-washing clothes using thermal technology and a frankly ridiculous amount of funding.

“Well… yes,” the guy admitted, “but this way there’s no strain on power grids or water supplies for it! It could reduce utility bills by thousands of dollars a year!”

Harry looked at the papers the guy submitted while Tony spun in his chair, perfectly content to let Harry inform the man that he was a moron.

“Why would it matter if they saved $1,000 on their utility bills if every shirt costs nearly $200?” Harry asked, pointing to a line on the paper where costs were outlined. “I dunno, mate, I’d rather just wash my shirts than spend that kind of money on them.”

While the man collected his items, and Tony assured him he could come back with a new invention in the future, as exploring recyclable thermal technology had a lot of merit in Stark Industries, Tony also tried to calculate how many items of his clothing cost over $200.

“You know, I’ve got boxers that cost more than those shirts,” Tony told Harry conversationally while they waited for the next inventor to come in.

Harry rubbed his eyes wearily. “Of course you do.”

 

They were both impressed with the woman who pitched the UV machine meant to be used in hospitals that reduced turnover time for sterilization through the use of UV rays.

“Less time sterilizing tools means more time saving lives,” she explained.

Tony read over her paperwork, combing each line carefully, while Harry got up from his chair to inspect the gun shaped sterilizer (a shape that would have to be changed before it could be marketed).

“This blue light really removes germs?” Harry asked her skeptically.

“It does. Here,” she handed the gun to him, unfazed by being questioned by a teenager, something Tony contributed to the gossip filling the business levels of the tower about the ‘breaking news’. “I’ll scan this chair to show the germs on it, then you clean it, okay?”

Tony watched the presentation, making a mental note to fire his cleaning crew when a disgusting amount of germs were shown on the chair they used.

Harry looked adorably excited when the sterilizing gun did as promised, and the germs were nearly indistinguishable after he scanned it.

“This is brilliant!” Harry told her. He gave her back the invention and then casually pushed the now germ-free chair down by Tony, swapping out the chair he had with it.

“I like it,” Harry whispered to Tony once he was seated.

Tony grinned and nodded at the woman. “We like it,” he said. He let Harry use Tony’s signature stamp before sliding the documents back across the table. “Take this to the girl at the desk, welcome to Stark Industries.”

“She seems happy,” Harry said after the woman left the room.

“We did just invest a million dollars in her invention.”

“We did what?!”

 

By ten thirty, when the list of inventors approved to pitch that day had been completed, the UV sterilizer had been the only invention actually approved. Not that it mattered one whit to Tony, as Harry had haltingly asked if he could attend the next months meeting before dashing off to get lunch with Pepper before Peter arrived.

As if Tony would tell him no; sitting there with Harry had been like.. like probably something Tony’s old man had always hoped for and Tony had never had the inclination to do.

Thank God Harry was a hell of a lot better son than Tony had been.

 

The rest of Tony’s day was a letdown after getting to spend the morning with his son.

The meeting with the publicity team was thankfully short, thanks to a statement Pepper probably prepared before Harry ever arrived at Stark Tower. The head gasket issue on the StarkCar prototype just needed reinstalled, recalibrated, and the codes cleared off the system.

Tony did suffer through nearly an hour of bullshit from his fellow Avengers as they went back and forth on how to best narrow down the possible Hydra base, assess for threats ‘before they arrived’ (as if they had ever done that before), and when they should tackle the mission. Ultimately, Steve decided that he and Nat would scout it out the next week, then return with information to ‘build a concrete plan with’.

And if they weren’t building concrete plans that day, then why the hell did they need a meeting?

The cookies Steve actually brought to the meeting were only a slight balm to Tony’s absolute disinterest.

 

By the time Tony drug himself up to the tower, sending Sirius a message, letting him know the sighting was just of an unfortunately hideous man and not Pettigrew, he had a headache of his own building between his eyes. He got all of the business related tasks checked off, and had no new information from Sirius on cursed scars or how to block apparation. Sirius’ only suggestion on the second was to take Harry to ‘Landfara Way’, a wizarding town hidden in New York City, and hire ‘a master in wards’.

Which just added a new item to the never ending todo list in Tony’s head. Tony thought maybe, with Harry gone, he’d grab a drink, kick back on the couch, and just relax before he tackled the rest of his projects for the day.

 

The kid, apparently, had other plans.

 

“Don’t be mad,” Harry said immediately when Tony stepped in their living room and looked around at the mess covering the floor. “I was afraid Arsehole would chew them up, so I locked him in my room and came out here to work.”

Tony stepped around the mess, playing an odd sort of game of hopscotch, as he tried to figure out what all the papers were.

“Moving pictures?” Tony breathed. He picked one up as soon as he realized what it was and watched in awe as Lily Potter threw a snowball at James Potter, knocking his glasses off his face, over and over. He looked around at the floor and realized they were all moving pictures, nearly two dozen of them, and they all featured the same two people.

“My parents,” Harry said shortly. He started snatching up the photos, moving quickly but handling the photos with enough care to show how much they obviously meant to him. “I’m making copies of these photos, for a new album, but I obviously can’t just bring a bunch of bloody magical pictures to Peter’s place, so…” Harry picked up his cell phone in one hand and wiggled it a little, “I’m making copies and he’s going to print them in his dark room.”

“Aah…” Tony carefully picked up a few of the photos for Harry, smiling softly when he found one with Harry as a newborn, being held by James who looked so proud that it made Tony ache with jealousy. “Hey, mind making me copies of a few of these? Tell your boyfriend I’ll pay him whatever it cost.”

Tony could have it done himself, but he doubted if Harry trusted him enough to relinquish a single one of those photos for even an instant.

“First off,” Harry narrowed his eyes and held his hand out, silently demanding Tony hand over his cherished photo, “Peter isn’t my boyfriend.”

Tony interrupted what was looking to be an excellent tirade with a grin. “You guys kiss again?”

Harry’s sudden blush and quick aversion of his eyes was answer enough.

“Second off,” Harry’s tone indicated the likelihood of him verbally confirming Tony’s guess, “why would you want copies of these photos? What for?”

Tony moved to the couch, swinging his legs up so he didn’t jostle any of the photos Harry still had scattered about, and reclined his head against the armrest. “Is it a crime to want childhood photos of my kid? See you in all your awkwardness before my genes kicked in and you became the good looking kid you are today? Show you off to my business partners like all doting fathers do?”

When Harry didn’t have a snappy comeback after a moment, Tony turned his head to see what he was doing and caught him chewing his lip and slowly replacing photos in a faded red album.

“I’m joking,” Tony said when Harry didn’t respond after another uncomfortable moment. “I’m sure you were a good looking five year old too, but it makes me sound like I need to stay fifty feet away from schools when I say it.”

Harry shrugged at that, his face blanking itself off quickly, all the odd apprehension melting away in to a mask of nothing. “I don’t know if I was,” he said lightly. “If you want photos I’ve got a couple baby photos and then a few when I started Hogwarts.” He lifted his head and gave Tony a challenging look, “Can’t really show off photos of your kid wearing wizarding robes to muggles, can you?”

Tony responded on autopilot as he puzzled over Harry’s response. “Sure I can, kid. I’ll tell them it’s the most elite boarding school in the world, it doesn’t even have a name, it’s so elite, and students dress up like wizards to prompt creativity and innovation. Wait, what the fuck?” Tony’s forehead creased as it clicked exactly what Harry just said, “You don’t have any photos for ten years of your life?”

“No.” Harry’s firm tone brokered no argument or further discussion. “You might have missed it, as easily as she signed me over to a complete bloody stranger, but my relatives weren’t exactly fond of the freak living in their house, were they?”

“You’re not a freak,” Tony said automatically, internally wincing as he recalled Harry telling him how much a freak he felt like for something as minor as his preference in partners. “There has to be pictures of you somewhere,” he insisted. “School records, field trips, hell, even in the background of someone else’s family photos.”

“There aren’t,” Harry insisted with a snap to his voice. He slid the last of the photos in the album and stood up. “I’m going to send these to Peter.”

Tony nodded absently, rolling back on his back and staring up at the ceiling. He waited until Harry’s door had closed behind him then began enacting step one of the plan he quickly put together.

“Jarvis, I need you to run new facial recognition software, go back to October 31, 1998. Focus primarily in Surrey, England, but scan the surrounding counties as well. Send me all stills of anyone that is at least a 65% match for Harry. Check CVT’s, social media uploads, news clippings, everything.”

“Very good, sir. I will send you my findings.”

“Thanks. Oh, hey, text contact Peter Parker, tell him Harry’s dad wants a copy of every photo he’s taken of Harry, even one’s Harry doesn’t know about, sent to me. And tell him he has until midnight or I’m sending Clint over with his bow.”

“Excellent, sir, I will threaten Mister Parker now.”

“Thanks, Jarvis.” Tony kicked his shoes off and closed his eyes. “Also tell him if he tells Harry that I’ll send Natasha along with Clint.”

It would look bad if Tony showed up in person to steal photographs from a teenager with professional photography aspirations, but he could send Clint and Nat and get excellent results, he was sure.

 

Tony was nearly asleep, dozing and relaxed in the silence of the living room, when Jarvis got back to him.

“Sir? Mister Parker said he isn’t scared of your friends and to bring it on, he knows karate.”

Despite himself, Tony chuckled. “Great, tell him I said that either he sends me the pictures or I’ll start inviting over the current Teen Vogue models to meet Harry.”

It took Jarvis less than six minutes to come back with confirmation that Peter had sent him nearly four dozen image attachments and a rolling the eyes emoji.

Harry had decent taste, at least the kid was witty. Peter would need to be, to keep up with Harry’s never ending sarcasm.

“Oh, hey, make sure he knows we’re having dinner here tomorrow at five for Harry’s birthday. Tell him to invite Harry’s other friend, Gwen, and I’ll send Happy to pick them up. Also, tell him it’s business casual.”

It wasn’t, since Tony hated anything that involved not wearing jeans, but he grinned to himself when he imagined the panic that Peter would have trying to decipher what exactly ‘business casual’, a term Tony still didn’t know the exact outline for, meant.

 

With that task taken care of, Tony set an alarm, rolled over on his side, and took what he thought to be an incredibly hard earned nap.

Chapter Text

July 30

Harry sat on the sitting room floor, his back to the armrest of the sofa, his legs pulled up to his chest, his chin propped on his knees. He looked away from the open window, glancing at his phone…

11:57

It was a tradition nearly as old as Harry himself was. Every year he waited up until midnight to be awake when his birthday rolled around. It was stupid, but had been comforting when the Dursleys went out of their way to make him extra miserable on his birthday. From midnight until morning, Harry could pretend that it would be a good day. He could pretend that when he woke up, someone who cared about him would wish him a happy birthday.

It had been a good omen when Hagrid arrived only minutes after Harry turned eleven.

It had been even better the last two birthdays when Harry’s friends had timed their owls to arrive at the Dursleys right at midnight.

Those owls with well wishes, gifts, and oftentimes life saving food, were the brightest spots of the grey coloured memories of the times with his relatives. And now…

Harry looked out the window that remained open for Hedwig, only ever the one in the sitting room—

“Can I open my bloody window?”

“You going to see a therapist?”

“No.”

“Answered your own question then.”

—and sighed.

Harry’s friends couldn’t write, not properly as Harry had Hedwig with him and Sirius assured him that other owls weren’t clever enough or connected enough to Harry to track him to America without an address. It wasn’t as if Hermione or Ron didn’t talk to him, they’d given Sirius a letter that Sirius sent Harry a photo of, one he hadn’t replied to yet. Proof though, that his friends cared about him, even if they didn’t realize what a pathetic coward Harry was.

So it was stupid, waiting up until midnight, thinking an owl would fly in, but…

11:58

 

But still he sat.

 

When his phone blinked over to 11:59, a soft footstep startled Harry in to turning and looking over the armrest he had been leaning against.

Tony.

Tony had managed to make it halfway across the sitting room, clear to the other end of the sofa, before Harry heard him, as lost in his own thoughts as he had been.

“Headache?” Tony asked lightly. He rubbed the back of his neck, looking sheepish as he stood there in the same silky looking black clothes he’d had on the night before.

It was the reminder of Tony finding Harry in the throes of a nightmare—

“Kill the spare!”

“Not Harry!”

—that caused Harry to scowl.

“I needed fresh air,” Harry lied baldly. “I can’t exactly get it in my room, can I?”

Tony grinned a little, his tense shoulders relaxing at Harry’s snappy tone. “Can’t jump out a window that won’t open,” he said with an airy wave of his hand. “Oh, hey, what time is it?”

Harry looked down at his phone just in time to see the numbers click over to 12:00 and the date to change.

“Mister Harry?”

Harry glanced up toward the ceiling as he always did when Jarvis spoke to him. “Yeah?”

“I apologize.”

Harry felt his entire face scalding as Jarvis broke out in an entire rendition of ‘Happy Birthday’ while Tony sang off-key and waved his hands around like a conductor.

As soon as they were done, Harry’s phone pinged and he looked down at the messages on the screen.

Happy birthday, Bright Eyes. -Peter

Happy birthday, Harry!! XOXO -Gwen

Happy birthday! I love you! -Pepper

Your dad is planning a surprise party. I told him you didn’t seem to like surprises, but he doesn’t listen. See you later, happy birthday. -Natasha

There were more, from the rest of Tony’s superhero friends, but Harry looked up at Tony, intending to scowl about a surprise party, and instead blinked in surprise.

Tony had moved quickly while Harry checked his texts. He stood just behind Harry with a wide smile and plate of red iced cupcakes in his hands. The cupcake in the middle had two number shaped candles lit, a one and a five.

Harry felt his throat swell up and had to blink very quickly to keep from doing something stupid, like crying.

“You’re supposed to make a wish and blow out the candles,” Tony said cajolingly. “C’mon, kid, I didn’t bake them, so you know they’re probably good.”

Harry got up and kept a hand on the sofa to steady himself as he got up and walked slowly over to the cupcakes.

“Make a wish!”

For the first time in Harry’s life, he had no idea what to immediately wish for.

Harry still closed his eyes, blew out the candle, and smiled weakly when Tony let out a cheer.

“This one’s made of some sort of weird dog food,” Tony said quickly, pointing at one of the cupcakes on the plate that was a slightly darker shade of red than the rest. “I tried to order one for Hedwig, but sticky foods aren’t good for owls I guess, go figure.”

“You ordered a cupcake for my dog?” Harry asked. He grabbed the one Tony pointed out and crouched down to feed it to Joey.

“Sure.” Tony put the plate on the back of the sofa, apparently not worried about it tipping over and ruining the cushions with red icing, before snagging one for himself and peeling the wrapper off it. “The dog’s my grand-pup, or whatever, it’s part of our family.”

It was that airy statement, coupled with the bloody cupcakes and the midnight birthday wishes and the ‘our family’ that undid Harry.

“Excuse me,” Harry muttered. He jumped to his feet and tore off to his bedroom, probably looking like an ungrateful prat as he slammed the door shut and slid against it. He pulled his knees to his chest and put his head between them. He inhaled through his nose, clenched his eyes shut, and argued against his own annoying and intrusive thoughts.

 

Stupid to be upset over this.

Stupid to be crying over cupcakes and… and a surprise party and Tony getting Joey his own cupcake.

Stupid to—

 

Ding!

 

Harry hit head head on his door and then sucked in a shaky breath before checking his phone, idly hoping it was Sirius so he could give him a call to chat.

I’m bad at the whole feelings thing, always have been really, but I love you, kid. I’m glad we finally get to have one of your birthdays together.

Harry read it again.

And again.

And again.

Then he flung the phone and ducked his head, letting his shoulders shake while his body wracked with sobs he didn’t understand.

Everything he used to wish for- friends and family that loved him- he got, so why did he feel so conflicted over it all?

 

Harry wound up falling asleep right there on the floor and woke up with a sore neck and Joey scratching at his door to be let in.

“Hey buddy.” Harry grinned when Joey attacked him with little puppy licks after he picked him up. He looked around the sitting room and felt both relief and guilt at it being empty.

“Give me just a second,” Harry told Joey. He hurried to get a pair of shoes on, sandals, which he’d never owned before he moved to New York and felt weird on his feet, and grabbed his half-charged phone from where he threw it on the floor.

Harry frowned at his phone as he carried Joey down to let him run in the yard while Hedwig flew overhead and chirped happily at them. Harry wasn’t self-centered enough to think Sirius didn’t have more important things to do than text Harry, it was just that Harry hadn’t ever woke up without some sort of ridiculous message from his godfather and it was worrisome that he did that day.

Their last phone conversation had been at four in the morning Harry’s time a few days prior, and it hadn’t exactly left Harry feeling secure about Sirius’ safety.

“Hey, kiddo.”

Harry had felt uneasy almost immediately.

“What happened?”

“Little mishap…”

“Sirius.”

Sirius sighed. “Albus knows where you are.”

Harry felt the air in his lungs freeze.

That was it then.

Harry was going to be taken back—

Taken from the place he’d began begrudgingly considering a home. It had been nice there, recently. He got to talk to Sirius every day, Tony had been hunting for Pettigrew to clear Sirius’ name. Harry went shopping with Pepper. She helped him buy picture frames and a mirror and a poster to hang up in his red room.

Peter and Gwen had been helping Harry study for high school. Gwen even made up lesson plans to get Harry on track, which had been such a Hermione thing to do that Harry laughed every time she pulled them out.

And… and Harry and Peter had been hanging out a lot.

They hadn’t put a name to the whatever they were doing, but… but it was a bit like dating, Harry supposed. They hung out, snogged occasionally, and text each other songs and Peter kept sending Harry ‘memes’, which mostly consisted of a cat that resembled Crookshanks saying things about hating people.

Peter said it reminded him of Harry.

And now Harry was going to be put in a war. He was going to get more people killed because he wasn’t a hero, he wasn’t particularly smart or skilled or brave. He was someone who got lucky a few times and twice had been at the expense of other people’s lives.

“HARRY!”

Harry startled, jarred from his swirling thoughts. He had dropped his phone at some point and he picked it back up as carefully as if it were one of the bombs in Tony’s lab.

“Sorry,” Harry said quietly. He cleared his throat. “So I guess that’s it then?”

Sirius, shocking Harry, chuckled in what had to be some of the worst timing ever.

“You’re going to hurt my feelings, kiddo. I know I’m old, but do you really think I’ve got no tricks left up my sleeve?”

Harry had been worried, warning Sirius to not do anything rash, but the way Sirius laughed away Harry’s warnings hadn’t exactly been heartening.

And now Harry woke up with no random emojis on his phone from his godfather.

While Joey did his business, Harry sent a text to Sirius. Just a little ‘hey’, crossing his fingers that he messaged back quickly.

 

Even after lingering in the yard for a while, Sirius hasn’t sent anything back when Harry returned to the flat.

It felt ominous.

Harry didn’t forget about it, but he did push it to the back of his mind when he found Pepper and Happy in the kitchen with Tony, arguing over pancakes it seemed like?

“Harry!” Pepper gave Harry a bright smile when she was the first to notice him standing in the doorway, curiously watching them fight at the stove. “Happy birthday! Ugh, you’re so old now!”

“Hey!” Tony had an apron on over the jeans and band tshirt he preferred (Harry was oddly pleased to recognize the band this time, even if he didn’t like Poison much, Gwen did). “He can’t be old because if he’s old then you’re implying that I’m not young.”

“You’re not,” Happy and Pepper said simultaneously.

Tony stuck a lip out at Harry. “Kid, tell them your old man isn’t old.”

Harry usually didn’t fall in the easy banter the others shared, but… but Tony got Joey his own cupcake and made Jarvis sing happy birthday to him at midnight and then sent a text that Harry ignored…

“You’re not old,” Harry said. He took a seat at the counter and shrugged when Pepper and Happy seemed shocked at Harry’s almost unprecedented defense of Tony. “Wizards live to be like 200, so…” Harry tapped a finger on the counter, “so that’s old.”

Tony looked inappropriately happy at Harry’s very small concession.

“See?” He jabbed a finger in Happy’s chest. “I’m young.”

Harry grinned and relaxed. “Are you guys trying to cook?”

Pepper huffed, blowing her bangs up off her forehead. “I wanted to make you breakfast, something special instead of cereal, and these two,” she pointed at Tony and Happy accusingly, “are making a mess.”

Harry mumbled something about her not needing to go through so much effort while he stretched his head up to see that Tony and Happy were covered in quite a bit of flour…

And… there was egg dripping down the kitchen counter…

And milk spilled on the floor.

“How do you keep your lab so neat when everything else you do is so bloody messy?” Harry asked Tony after Pepper waved off Harry’s protests.

Happy chuckled and raised a brow over his shoulder at Harry while he resumed stirring a bowl of what was possibly batter.

“Have you seen his lab? It’s a wreck.”

“It’s organized chaos,” Harry said in a sarcastic drawl that did nothing to take the truth from his words. “It’s not… this,” Harry gestured to the mess they made.

Tony, for some inexplicable reason, looked as if Harry had handed him the quidditch cup as smugly as he smiled while he told Happy and Pepper that Harry ‘understood him’.

Harry entertained himself with watching the three of them make some of the most lopsided and poorly mixed pancakes he’d ever experienced in his life. He ate every bite of the three he took though, puffs of flour and all.

He also quietly mused that perhaps Tony didn’t have many people who understood his erratic, witty, and oftentimes overtly genuine personality.

 

After breakfast, Harry went to shower and put on normal clothes. He’d sort of expected to just do nothing, perhaps try and talk Tony out of whatever mad surprise party he planned, but then Pepper insisted that Harry go shopping with her and he was very bad at telling that woman no.

Pepper was good company though. She drove with the radio on full blast, singing along while her hair whipped crazily from the open windows. Harry knew a few songs and Pepper poked him in the side until he sang with her. Pepper had a nice voice, musical and pretty. Harry did not, but he sang anyway because it made her laugh and made him stress a little less over Sirius’ continued silence.

Then Pepper drug Harry around shopping malls for what seemed like an eternity. Apparently the ten pairs of jeans and fifteen shirts Harry owned weren’t enough of a wardrobe for Pepper.

It was more clothes than Harry had ever owned before. Even combined with his seven uniforms for school, Harry had never owned so much clothes before.

Harry let Pepper pick things out though after they had nearly an hour long conversation about ‘love languages’ and she said that she expressed love through gift giving. It sounded ridiculous, but Harry thought about how happy it made him to buy gifts for his friends, so he figured there was a bit of truth to it too.

“Your dad‘s big on giving gifts too,” Pepper said when she looked at trainers. Her eyes kept roaming toward a pair of pumps though; Harry snagged a pair in her size, having been exposed to shopping trips enough with her to have remembered her shoe size. Pepper winked when Harry grabbed the burgundy colored death traps.

“Oh yeah, you are your fathers son,” she laughed. “You know he once bought me a diamond bracelet as an apology for singeing my blouse?”

Harry furrowed his brows together. “I mean, that seems like an apology?”

“A ten thousand dollar apology for a fifty dollar blouse, Harry.”

Harry shrugged. Even if he didn’t like people spending money on him, he’d never worried much about spending money on other people. Since his eleventh birthday, when Harry realized he wasn’t penniless, he’d never considered how much he spent when he bought things for his friends.

“I once paid almost twenty galleons on owl treats for Hedwig to apologize for her being locked up at my relatives’ house,” Harry told Pepper.

Pepper’s hand stilled from where she’d been reaching for a pair of black trainers. “How much is that in pounds?”

Harry tried to do the math from the currency exchange rate Hermione patiently explained to him once.

“A little over 99?” he said slowly.

Pepper bit her lip and closed her eyes for a moment.

“Harry, darling, I really hope you’re bad at math and not telling me you spent $110 on bird food.”

“Treats,” Harry stressed. “She spent three weeks locked in a cage, Pepper. Trust me, she deserved them.”

Pepper tossed the trainers in the ridiculously large pile of things she insisted on buying and gave Harry an exasperated look.

“I don’t know why Tony bothered with a DNA test,” she mumbled before adding more clearly, “Tell me about magic money.”

Harry did. He explained about galleons, sickles, and knuts. He tried using Hermione’s explanation, but as he’d barely understood it himself, he couldn’t really use it to explain. Instead, Harry talked Pepper through the train of thought he used every time he tried to do the conversion while they ate lunch and finished shopping.

“Why do you think you’re not intelligent?” Pepper asked Harry when they were back in her little silver sports car and driving toward the tower. “You’re so worried about high school, why?”

Pepper didn’t sound as if she thought Harry was an idiot; she just sounded curious. Harry gnawed on his lower lip for a few minutes while he watched the busy New York streets pass his window as he tried to phrase an honest response.

“My friend Hermione, she’s a genius,” he said slowly. “She can read anything and remember it years later, probably the page number too. Definitely the page number,” he added with a small grin as he recalled study sessions spent together with his friends. “But I just- I’m not good at reading and memorizing everything.” He shrugged a little, “I’m not stupid,” he said defensively, “I’ve just never been top of my class.”

Pepper made a thoughtful face. “I bet you do better with your hands.”

“I do,” Harry grinned. “I think practical demonstrations are what kept me from being as bad as Crabbe and Goyle.”

It was a decent distraction, because Pepper began asking Harry questions about his old classmates which was much easier to talk about than himself.

 

“Draco Malfoy sounds like a spoiled brat,” Pepper said when they arrived back at the tower and got in the lifts. They left the proof of their trip in Pepper’s car, as she said they could carry it up later. “Oh, hey, do me a favor? Please?”

Harry eyed her warily, “What?”

“Act surprised.”

The lift doors opened and Harry’s entire body twitched when an absurd amount of people jumped and screamed, “SURPRISE!”

Harry must not have looked surprised despite his racing pulse because Tony put his hands on his hips and glared at his friends.

“Alright, who told him? Jarvis? Was it you?”

Pepper winked at Harry before putting an arm around his shoulders and guiding him in the flat while Tony bickered with his friends.

“Peter and Gwen should be here soon,” Pepper told Harry in a conspiratorial whisper. “Until then, have you met Rhodey?”

Harry assumed it was a rhetorical question since Pepper and Tony seemed to track where he went, who he talked to, and what he did to a borderline obsessive degree.

Despite Harry’s lack of a response, Pepper led him to a tall man with short cropped black hair, dark skin, and soft brown eyes.

“You must be Harry, I’m James Rhodes, everyone calls me Rhodey,” he said. He offered a hand to Harry and raised his voice, “And I’d say I’ve heard so much about you but that would be a lie.”

“I said I was sorry!” Tony cried.

Harry shook Rhodey’s hand briefly. “Harry,” he said, a pointless introduction.

Rhodey held firm to his hand when Harry tried to release it. “I want you to know how truly sorry I am.”

“Er… for what?”

Rhodey jerked a thumb over his shoulder, pointing at Tony who was then fiddling with plates on the kitchen counter beside what looked to be an entire buffet of Chinese food.

“Your terrible misfortune in being related to Tony,” Rhodey said solemnly. His eyes were glittering though, so Harry assumed it was a joke.

“It’s a bit of a nightmare, but it could be worse, I could be related to Clint,” Harry said.

Rhodey laughed and dropped Harry’s hand. “I like you already, I’m going to call you Tony 2.0, the better version.”

Harry gave him a brief grin before taking note of the decorations and things Tony must have set up while Harry was out with Pepper.

“You did say your favorite color was red,” Bruce said with a grin when he noticed Harry eyeing what had to be 100 red balloons floating up on the ceiling.

“Right…” Harry checked his phone once more, still nothing from Sirius, and struggled to force at least a partial smile when Tony came bounding up to him with a wide smile.

“I know this looks like your standard boring birthday party, but you should know that I spiked the punch,” he announced cheerfully.

“And then I replaced it with unspiked punch,” Steve sighed from where he sat on the sofa with the red headed psycho. The psycho winked at Harry, because apparently she thought they were friends.

Which they absolutely were not.

“And then I spiked the new one,” Tony whispered.

Rhodey laughed while Pepper sighed in a long suffering sort of way.

“Tony, you didn’t,” she said warningly.

Tony held his hands up innocently. “Joking,” he said in what Harry dubbed his ‘placating Pepper’ tone.

Pepper walked off, toward the bowl of what Harry assumed was punch set up on the counter to sniff it.

“I’m not joking,” Tony immediately winked at Harry when she was gone.

“I shouldn’t even be surprised,” Rhodey shook his head with a fondly exasperated look. “Harry, this is the same son of a bitch that threw a party in my dorm the night before my finals.”

Harry accepted a drink from Tony, that was definitely spiked, and sat at the kitchen counter with Rhodey and Tony while he listened to what seemed to be a highlight of Tony being a terrible teenager while the others chatted in the sitting room.

Rhodey was in the middle of a story involving what sounded like a lot of drugs, alcohol, and ‘sorority girls’ when Jarvis announced that Peter and Gwen arrived.

Tony, who had drank two cups of punch and had been sneaking sips of a bottle of something he shared with Rhodey when Pepper was distracted, told Jarvis to let them in.

“You’ll like this kid, Peter,” Tony told Rhodey. “He’s really nerdy, really obsessed with Harry.”

As if that didn’t bring a scowl and blush to Harry’s face.

“You’re the only parent in the world who would find that endearing,” Rhodey laughed at his friend.

Harry rolled his eyes and carefully stepped around psycho, Clint, Bruce, Steve, and Pepper where they were having a heated debate about some law or something to go wait by the lifts for his friends.

His greeting died in his throat though when the lift doors opened and…

“Oh bloody fucking hell,” Harry breathed.

Peter stepped off the lift, probably Gwen behind him, but Harry couldn’t see her, because… because Peter looked…

There wasn’t really a word for it, but… good. Peter looked really, very, truly, good.

Peter had on a black button up shirt with the sleeves rolled up to the middle of his forearms (how had Harry never noticed that Peter had attractive forearms? How had Harry never realized that forearms could be attractive?) paired with a pair of black dress pants that made him look even taller than usual. His hair was brushed back in a swoop that had Harry’s fingers itching to mess it up.

And he was beaming, as if Harry were his favorite person in the world.

“Hey, Bright Eyes.”

Harry blinked and tried to get his vocal chords to work again. He probably looked like an idiot…

“You look like an idiot,” Gwen said abruptly with a cheerful laugh. She threw her arms around Harry’s neck and squeezed him in a tight hug. “He looks so handsome, doesn’t he?” she whispered.

Harry managed a hum that Gwen took as confirmation.

“Business casual, huh?” Peter said, looking over Harry’s shoulder with a brow raised.

Harry glanced behind him and saw Tony leaning against the wall with a smirk.

“Harry’s idea,” Tony said. He raised his drink to Peter, “Way to be classy though, Pete.”

“I don’t know what he told you, but it wasn’t my idea,” Harry told Peter quickly. “And his name is Peter,” he added to Tony.

“Don’t worry about it,” Peter smiled again at Harry and handed him a small blue wrapped package. “Happy birthday.”

If Harry hadn’t been a red-faced mess, he was then.

“You didn’t need to get me anything,” Harry told him awkwardly. “I didn’t get you anything for your birthday.”

Peter shrugged with an easy grin. “It’s in ten days, so you’ve got time.”

“Oh my god, you guys should have a joint birthday next year!” Gwen squealed eagerly. “We can invite everyone from school! Oh! We can have it at my place!”

Harry laughed, grateful for Gwen’s inability to let any silence stretch too long, and led them further in the flat to offer introductions to everyone else.

Pepper, thankfully, reacted like a perfectly normal person as she met Gwen and greeted Peter.

Everyone else was ridiculous.

“Wow, Pete, what a look,” psycho whistled, instantly causing Harry to bristle. “Are you making up for the lame shirt from last time?”

“Ooh, I like your look,” Gwen said sweetly, cutting off Harry’s retort. Gwen looked Natasha over from top to bottom in a haughty manner that had Harry and Peter exchanging grins. “Is it like a Sexy Assassin costume? I mean, Halloween isn’t for a few more months, but I suppose leather never goes out of style, if you’re middle aged and obsessed with the 80’s, that is.”

Clint barked out a laugh and leaned on psycho with one elbow. “She’s got you pegged, Nat,” he said playfully.

“And you must be the stalker I’ve heard so much about,” Gwen smiled at Clint and offered a hand. “Sure would be a shame if the paper heard about your unfortunate penchant for peeping in the windows of teenage boys.”

Peter laughed quietly and grabbed Harry’s hand when Clint sputtered and the other Avengers roared with laughter.

“She’s the best,” Harry said fondly as they simply walked away and left Gwen to mock the rest of the Avengers on her own.

“I’m better though, right?” Peter grinned.

Harry scoffed and rolled his eyes. “You’re adequate,” he drawled.

Peter put his hand on his chest and sniffled. “God, you sure know how to make a guy feel special, Harry.”

“He’s good at that, isn’t he?” Tony walked up behind them and threw an arm around both of their necks. “Harry’s a real charmer.”

“Jesus Christ, Tony,” Rhodey laughed from where he stood in the kitchen, leaning against the counter with his arms crossed. “Leave them alone, old man. Don’t you have a Pepper to chase after?”

“Leave me out of it!” Pepper yelled from the sitting room. She sat on the sofa, picking at a plate of Chinese food, and looked up from her conversation with Bruce long enough to toss a wink at Harry.

“Pepper doesn’t like PDO, public discussions of her obsession,” Tony explained. He dropped his arm from Harry but kept his other around Peter. “How about you, Pete? Big fan of PDO?”

Harry gave Peter a mortified and apologetic look, but Peter seemed entirely at ease.

“PDO? Nah. PDA though? Huge fan.”

Harry and Rhodey laughed when Tony seemed momentarily stunned.

“Someone managed to shut Tony Stark up.” Rhodey whistled and raised his glass to Peter, “I like you, kid.”

And Harry decided he liked Rhodey as well. At least he was a normal friend of Tony’s.

 

Harry liked Rhodey that much more when he’d given Harry an entirely normal gift.

“Teenagers love cash,” Rhodey shrugged when Tony rolled his eyes at his card and overly generous gift. He waved off Harry’s thanks though, saying he had fifteen years worth of birthdays to make up for. “They’re all about freedom and independence.”

“It is very important at our age,” Gwen said with a sage nod and a mischievous smile. “I would say that cash is much more highly valued than…” She waved her hand at the actual knives that Clint and psycho gave Harry, “weapons.”

“Weapons can save your life,” Clint argued. “You can’t exactly bribe a stranger in to not killing you.”

“You definitely can and if you can’t, then you didn’t offer them enough,” Tony said from his seat on the sofa.

Harry, Peter, and Gwen sat on the floor with Pepper and Steve, tossing a ball between the five of them for Joey to chase after.

“Hmm… so you’re a pacifist then?” Peter asked Tony. He tossed the ball to Harry, grinning when Harry easily caught it from the air. “That’s not what those aliens said.”

Gwen caught the ball when Harry tossed it to her and paused with her hand on her heart. “A moment of silence, for all those poor, poor aliens.”

Harry and Peter bowed their head solemnly, as did Pepper, the others looked bewildered.

“Now that that’s over…” Peter snatched his gift to Harry off the coffee table and handed it to him carefully. “Open mine, Bright Eyes.”

“Oooh, bright eyes,” Clint laughed and batted his lashes at Harry. “Young love, so cute.”

“Ignore him, kids, Clint’s just jealous,” Bruce piped up helpfully. “Last date he had was with a target he killed.”

“Oh?” Tony gave Clint an interested look. “Do tell.”

Harry ignored Clint’s story about a woman he ‘followed’, see also: stalked, as he slowly and carefully opened Peter’s gift.

“I helped pick it,” Gwen said brightly when Harry had it unwrapped and was shocked in a rather pleasant way by the gift.

Harry tenderly turned the camera around in his hands, absently smiling as he noticed it was the same brand as Peter’s.

“And by that, Gwen means that she paid for it,” Peter said as he ran a nervous hand through his hair, finally messing up the neat swoop it had been brushed in. “But it’s awesome, look…”

Harry let out a startled laugh when Peter quickly snagged the camera and flashed a photo of him sitting there. He was still blinking the stars out of his eyes while Tony and Pepper exchanged pleased looks.

“Ooh! I want to take photos!” Gwen cried.

The three of them wrestled lightly over the camera, Gwen somehow coming up victorious despite being much smaller than Harry or Peter. Harry suspected it had more to do with Peter and Harry being more occupied with each other and neither of them wanting to accidentally elbow Gwen in the face than any proof of her strength.

“Okay!” Gwen got to her feet and danced backward to the doorway of the sitting room. “Everyone squish together!”

Harry rolled his eyes, but it was a brilliant idea, truthfully. He didn’t know if Peter had told Gwen about Harry’s small admission of wanting to have more photos of his life and the people in it or not, but a photo of everyone there seemed like a good idea anyway.

So Harry sat on the floor beside Peter, with Joey in his lap, while everyone else tried to squish themselves on the sofa behind them. Rhodey plunked himself in the middle and Bruce and Steve sat on either side of him. Happy perched himself on the armrest beside Steve after being coaxed in to joining the photo. Clint leaned across the back of the sofa with the psycho propped up on his shoulder. Tony sat beside Harry, Pepper sat beside Peter, and Harry thought of what a peculiar family photo they made.

Harry’s mouth had been more open in surprise as he realized he’d mentally referred to their group as a family when the first flash from his camera went off.

Tony’s friends weren’t Harry’s family, as much as Tony called them his, but…

But it wasn’t as if Harry were someone who could be picky about who his family was, could he?

“Pepper, your boyfriend flipped the camera off,” Gwen laughed after checking the screen on the camera before allowing anyone to move. “We need another—”

Gwen’s (rather bossy) demand was cut off by the lift dinging. Harry turned to glance at Tony, his look of confusion mirroring Harry’s own.

The lift never just opened. Jarvis always announced whoever was on it before it did, when Tony was home anyway.

Clint and psycho were on either side of the lift before the doors could open and Harry scowled when Tony jumped up to stand in front of him.

Gwen turned with the camera in her hands as the doors opened and—

“Happy birthday, kiddo.”

“Sirius?!” Harry pushed Joey off to Peter and jumped to his feet, rushing toward his godfather as he stepped off the lift. He drew up just short of launching himself at Sirius by another familiar figure, one that Harry would rather not see at the moment.

“Good evening, Harry.” Professor Dumbledore stepped off the lift and smiled at Harry before looking around the overly full and excessively red-decorated flat curiously. “I apologize for interrupting what looks to be a delightful party spent with your family.”

Tony stepped up beside Harry, his red metal suit attached to his forearms, and placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder.

Harry didn’t have to look over at him to know they were thinking the same thing in that moment:

Fuck.

Chapter Text

Tony cussed Sirius out in his head with every swear he knew in every language he’d ever bothered to memorize.

Stupid, useless, traitorous, fucking—

“I’m not here to steal your son, you know.”

Tony ended his mental rant and moved his carefully blank face from Sirius’ sheepish one to Albus Dumbledore’s openly smiling one.

“Interesting opener there, Gandalf,” Tony said lightly with a hand still firmly on his son’s shoulder. It felt as if the muscles beneath Tony’s hand were quivering, though if it was fear of the wizard with the long white beard and gaudy purple two piece suit or at Tony’s continued touch, he wasn’t sure.

“When I show up uninvited to people’s homes, I also usually start out by saying I’m not there to steal their kid.” Rhodey stepped up beside Tony, his eyes a calm reassurance that if it turned in to a fight, Tony wouldn’t be fighting alone.

“Maybe you guys should talk somewhere private,” Pepper said.

It was Pepper’s suggestion that reminded Tony that there were three teenagers in the room possibly about to be caught up in a fight between at least one wizard, and god help Sirius if he fought against Tony, and six avengers.

Tony liked Sirius, but he’d feed him to Bruce if he came with that old bastard to steal Harry away.

“Steve, why don’t you take Harry and his friends to your place?” Tony suggested in a way that wasn’t really a suggestion at all without looking away from Dumbledore (even if the suit he wore was burning Tony’s eyes). “Pep, Happy, go with them.”

Harry twisted his head around to glare at Tony. “I’ll stay, thanks.”

“You’ll go,” Tony told him firmly. He didn’t really have time to toe the line between ‘fun dad’ and ‘good dad’ just then. The entire room had the potential to turn real ugly, real quick, and Tony would rather not have his kid caught up in it. “Take your friends to walk the dog, or whatever. Just give me a few minutes to talk to our friends here.”

Dumbledore had the audacity to smile at Tony, as if Tony wasn’t silently sending up the rest of his suit with a button inside his wrist piece.

“I think it would be best if Harry were present, as it is a conversation rather pertinent to his life,” he said.

“And I think Tony is his father and Harry should come with me,” Pepper said coolly.

The ‘Future Stepmom Voice’ seemed to be a universally understood language because Dumbledore nodded his head at Pepper with his annoying little smile.

“Correct you are, ma’am, I apologize. Harry, it was wonderful to see you, dear boy, I hope to see you again soon.”

Tony heard someone growl, and he was pretty sure it was Bruce, which meant that either Dumbledore needed to shut the hell up or Tony needed to resign himself to buying another new TV.

Pepper put her hand on Harry’s other shoulder and nodded toward the emergency exit leading to the stairs. “Come on, Harry, let’s take your friends down and have cake.”

“Wait! Sirius, I solemnly swear…?”

Whatever anxiety rocked through Harry’s body when he asked Sirius his nonsensical question drained away instantly when Sirius answered him.

“I am up to no good,” Sirius told Harry.

Harry’s shoulders slumped and he pushed Tony’s hand off him.

“Brilliant, fuck you then, Padfoot.”

Sirius winced, but he didn’t bother apologizing.

Harry turned toward Pepper and made some face at his friends who… who were probably pretty damn confused. “Er… you guys coming?”

“You have the weirdest friends,” Gwen whispered to Harry.

Gwen was a funny girl, Tony might offer her a job in his media department when she graduated school.

Tony angled his body sideways so he could see Pepper leading the three teens, and the yipping puppy, down the stairs with Steve and Happy following behind before he decided the direct approach was, as usual, the best.

“You have twenty seconds to tell me why you’re here before I kill you.” Tony turned quickly and raised his wrist up and aimed a light at Dumbledore’s beard just as he heard a familiar little- snick -that had to be one of Clint’s arrows aimed and ready to fly.

“Eighteen… seventeen…”

“Woah,” Sirius held his hands up and wisely shuffled away from Dumbledore. “Let’s not fight if we don’t have to.”

“Yeah?” Nat stepped forward, empty handed, but threatening enough, and got nearly right in Sirius’ face. “I’m sure you’ve got a stellar excuse for showing up, unannounced and uninvited then?”

“First off,” Sirius stuck his hands in his jacket pockets and smirked at Nat, “Sirius, pleasure to meet you.”

Tony was counting down the last few seconds of Dumbledore’s life, so he couldn’t laugh, but damn if he didn’t want to just a tad. Only Sirius Black would show up at Tony’s, start a fight with the Avengers, and then flirt with Nat.

“Wish I could say the same,” Nat said in her scathing and cool tone. “Why are you here?”

“Ah, I believe that was my doing,” Dumbledore said cheerfully, acting for all the world as if he wasn’t worried at all. And if it wasn’t an act, then ‘the most powerful wizard in the world’ was as dim as his clothes were bright. “Please, why don’t we all sit? Perhaps…” Dumbledore looked around at Tony’s fellow Avengers, his friends, and smiled. “Perhaps introduce ourselves?”

“Great idea,” Clint said, his arrow aimed at Sirius while Tony and Rhodey were focused on Dumbledore. It was nice to see all those team building exercises finally paying off; divide and conquer and all that crap. “I’m the guy who’s going to kill you if you don’t get the hell out right now.”

“Hey, guys, why don’t we wait to start ruining Tony’s decor before we hear them out?” Bruce held his hands up and shuffled in the middle of the tense stand-off, though not in the way of Tony’s laser.

“Wonderful idea,” Dumbledore said. “Mister Stark, I’m afraid I would prefer to not fight you and inadvertently destroy your electronics. Though, if anything I say is not to your liking, I will accept being tossed out to never darken your doorstep again.”

“Tony, hear him out,” Sirius said over Nat’s shoulder. “Trust me, if nothing else.”

Tony looked toward Sirius, saw the pleading look in his eyes. Twenty minutes ago, Tony would have said he trusted Sirius Black when it came to Harry as much as he did Pepper. And Tony didn’t want to think Sirius would do anything to risk Harry’s safety, but it wasn’t a risk Tony wanted to take either.

He just got his kid, he wouldn’t lose him.

“Five minutes,” Tony said. He moved his laser from Dumbledore’s chest to the loveseat in the living room.

“Have you lost your mind?” Rhodey whispered when Dumbledore and Sirius moved to the loveseat. “Kick their asses to the curb.”

“Five minutes,” Tony told him. “I’ll hear what they have to say about Harry and then they can go. Oh, hey, by the way,” Tony fixed Sirius with a look as unimpressed as he could, “good job texting the kid for his birthday.”

“Been a bit busy,” Sirius said with another grimace. “I’ll talk to him before I leave, try and explain.”

“Yeah, we’ll see about that.” Nat moved to stand alongside Tony and Rhodey against the wall facing the two wizards while Clint and Bruce stood behind the couch. Tony saw Clint’s bow was still armed and raised so he figured he wasn’t the only one who didn’t see it as some friendly chat.

“Talk, now,” Tony told Dumbledore. “You might not care about crashing Harry’s birthday, but I’ve got plans that don’t include you.”

“I’m afraid we didn’t have much of a choice,” Dumbledore said in a grave voice that Tony didn’t like at all. “How much do you know of Harry’s past, Harry’s world?”

Tony didn’t look toward Sirius, keeping a poker face, but it seemed like whatever Sirius spilled, he kept his and Tony’s never ending communication out of it.

“Let’s assume we know everything,” Nat said with a cold smile. “So don’t bother trying to lie to us.”

“Certainly not.” Dumbledore looked toward Sirius and they shared a frown before they both turned to Tony. “Then you are aware of a wizard who calls himself Lord Voldemort who is after your son?”

“Noseless and crazy?” Tony repeated the general description he got from Sirius, who got it from Harry. “Yeah. I’m all caught up there, Gandalf.”

“Wonderful.” Dumbledore clasped his hands in his lap and leaned forward. “Then you may be unsurprised to know that he has managed to track Harry to this location.”

“That is news,” Tony said with forced lightness. The last he knew was that Voldemort, which, by the way, was about as ridiculous a name as Dumbledore was, tried to track Harry and Sirius was certain it wouldn’t work because all of Harry’s possessions were either with him or with Harry.

“I’m afraid that it is a rather easy, if illegal, potion to brew,” Dumbledore explained.

“Fucking wizards,” Rhodey sighed under his breath.

“All that was needed was something of Harry’s to locate him.”

“See that’s really strange to me actually because I didn’t know Volda-whatever had anything of Harry’s.” Tony raised his eyebrows mockingly. “What? Did he keep Harry’s socks as a memento of the good times they shared in a graveyard?”

“His blood,” Sirius said. He ran a hand through his black hair, pulling it free from the tie he’d had it held back with, and sighed. He looked like hell actually. Which suited Tony just fine because he still didn’t know why Sirius brought Dumbledore over to begin with.

“Voldemort used Harry’s blood to build his body,” Sirius said. “They apparently have the same blood now.”

Bruce jerked to a stop where he’d been pacing behind the sofa.

“Repeat that,” he said in a snappy way. When Sirius and Dumbledore turned in their seats to look at him, Bruce pointed a finger between them both. “Did you just say this- this ‘evil wizard’ has Harry’s exact DNA?”

“I’m afraid so,” Dumbledore inclined his head at Bruce.

Any other time and Tony would crack a joke about his other new son, but even he knew it wasn’t the time.

“More unfortunately for Harry, it means that the protection his mothers sacrifice gave him is gone.” He turned back and faced Tony. “There were protections on his relatives home, blood wards, but those are gone now as well.”

Tony was preparing to blast a hole in Dumbledore’s head for implying that anything about those damned abusive pieces of crap was ‘safe’ for Harry, but Clint beat him to it.

Clint took half a step forward and had an arrow pressed to the back of Dumbledore’s head in an instant.

“Your magic spells didn’t keep him safe at all.” Clint’s face was angrier than Tony had ever seen it.

And to think, Tony used to worry that Clint would try and kill Harry in his sleep.

This was the real team building exercise.

“You left him there and counted on your bullshit magic to protect him and what happened? Kid gets treated like a dog for his whole life,” Nat spat.

“I wouldn’t treat my fucking dog like that,” Clint sneered.

Dumbledore raised his hands placatingly—

Tony had the sudden realization that Dumbledore must be as powerful as he was confident. Not many people could have an arrow brushing the back of their skull held in place by Hawkeye, the bird with aim so perfect it was damn near a super power, and not even break a sweat.

—and gave Tony a look that was probably meant to be sorrow.

“If I had known then what I know now, please believe that I world have torn the world apart to ensure your son came to you when James and Lily died. As it was,” Dumbledore sighed and suddenly looked less confident, more old. A terrible look for him. “I worked with the information I had.”

“And the information you withheld,” Sirius snapped.

Dumbledore nodded wearily. “Even with all my best intentions, many mistakes were made. I wish only now to share with you what I know and then perhaps we can move forward together to keep Harry safe.”

“Hold up.” Nat stepped forward and held her hand up. “You said this big bad wizard knows where Harry is? Should we be preparing for an attack?”

“No,” Sirius and Dumbledore answered simultaneously. Sirius was suddenly grinning and Dumbledore looked entirely too amused for Tony’s comfort.

“And why not?” Clint asked, lowering his bow at Tony’s tiny gesture. “Let me guess, he knew better than to pick a fight with the Avengers?”

“Afraid not,” Sirius chuckled in some piss poor timing. “He tracked Harry here then had Snape do some digging, right? Well Snivellus did the first useful thing he’s ever done, he gathered information on your team and shared it with his boss.”

Again, Tony corrected Sirius silently. Sirius told him this guy he hated, Snape, was also the one to pass along some half-ass ‘prophecy’ that sent Voldemort after Harry in the first place.

“And it’s useful to give the enemy information on us?” Rhodey asked Sirius disbelievingly. “Because that’s really the opposite of helpful.”

“Aah, but the information he found was quite the deterrent for Voldemort,” Dumbledore told them all. “I believe you all are friends with Thor?”

Tony closed his eyes and tilted his head up to the ceiling for a moment.

Thank Odin for Thor Odinson.

“Seems like we owe the big guy a thank you,” Rhodey muttered, sharing Tony’s exact sentiment.

“Oh he’s getting a hug for sure,” Tony agreed. “So Harry’s safe as long as Voldemort thinks Thor is here?”

“Mm, unfortunately that was true until this morning when my Order member alerted me that Voldemort would be sending some of his other followers here to assess the situation,” Dumbledore said.

“And you’re just now telling us that?!” Rhodey snapped, once again sharing Tony’s mind in the way Tony suspected only someone as secretly fucked up as Rhodey could do. “For the love of god, man. Jarvis! Lockdown!”

“Nat, go check that everything’s good downstairs,” Tony ordered quickly as Jarvis confirmed lockdown initiation. “Tell Happy to contact Peter and Gwen’s family. It’s too risky to leave with them, not if we have wizard bogeys on our tail.”

Tony pulled his phone out and ignored the string of irritated texts from his kid to send one to Pepper, but Dumbledore interrupted him before he could send it.

“They are not a current concern,” he said, drawing Tony’s eyes from his phone to his own blue eyes. “When I arrived, I made a small show of entering the building, and Carrow and Yaxley left quite quickly.”

Tony looked to Sirius, silently asking for confirmation.

“That’s why we came,” Sirius said quietly, meeting Tony’s gaze head on. “Albus wasn’t going to come until Snape sent him his report.”

“As I said before, Mister Stark, truly I have no intentions on stealing your son.” Dumbledore smiled and Tony felt himself relax the tiniest amount.

“However I believe you should discuss him returning to Hogwarts in September.”

And there it was.

Tony kept his phone in hand while he crossed his arms and glared Dumbledore down. Poker face be damned, if Dumbledore was going to show his cards, so would Tony.

“However nothing,” Tony said. “Harry’s my kid and he’s staying here. With his family.”

Dumbledore laced his fingers together and touched his chin.

“Mister Stark, has Harry been experiencing any strange dreams? Pains in his scar?”

“Depends on why you’re asking,” Tony hedged easily. Harry had chronic headaches, but Tony wasn’t going to say that since it had nothing to do with Harry’s education.

Dumbledore looked as if Tony confirmed it anyway, which was pretty damn annoying actually.

“Your son and Voldemort have a connection,” Dumbledore told Tony. “How far this goes, how deep—”

“Pretty damn deep if they have the same DNA,” Bruce muttered.

“We can only guess at,” Dumbledore went on. “I have some theories, a few that fit better than others, but I will say that Hogwarts is the safest place for Harry.”

“Safer than with us?” Nat scoffed. “I doubt that.”

Dumbledore smiled at her, “I did simply walk inside, my dear.”

Even Nat didn’t have a smart response to that.

Tony didn’t have magic, he didn’t have the ability to keep wizards from showing up or attacking. He could, and would, fight them, and he felt pretty good about winning, but if he was asleep? If he was at work or in his lab or the damn shower?

What then?

“It doesn’t matter,” Tony said, answering his own question and flipping his hand blithely. “Harry doesn’t want to go, I don’t want him to go, we can keep him safe. He’s staying.”

Clint nodded in agreement and Rhodey clapped a hand to Tony’s shoulder. Sirius winked in a way that made Tony wonder what reason he even had for coming asking if he knew Tony wouldn’t just hand his kid over to some white bearded shit who wanted to put a fifteen year old in a magic war.

Dumbledore just looked thoughtful which was really pissing Tony off.

“Harry doesn’t want to go to the school his parents went to? He doesn’t want to obtain his OWLS, scores he would need if he ever wished to pursue a job in the wizarding world? Learn magic to protect himself from those who wish him harm?” Dumbledore gave Tony a piercing stare over the top of his glasses. “I was under the impression that Harry was rather fond of Hogwarts, proud to be a wizard, and quite attached to the friends he has there.”

 

And Tony was suddenly under the impression that he barely knew his son at all.

 

“He’s going to be mad as hell at you, rightfully this time,” Tony told Sirius. “Don’t expect a hug and some happy reunion, not when you brought Dumbledore to his door.”

“Albus already knew where Harry was,” Sirius hissed. “He was going to come with or without me. I just came to try and keep it from being a whole thing.”

“Great job,” Tony drawled in a sarcastic whisper. “Really, Sirius, this is probably top ten greatest ideas you’ve ever had.”

“Hey,” Sirius jabbed Tony in the shoulder as the two of them walked down the stairs to Steve’s floor while Dumbledore waited upstairs, heavily supervised, “I’ve had way more than ten bad ideas.”

Tony refused to laugh.

“You could have called,” he said instead. “Or sent a text. I’m pretty sure you know how to do that.”

“Mate, any idea how much work it is to sneak out of the country and apparate in a new country without getting caught?” Sirius paused on the stairs long enough to roll his eyes at Tony. “The last thing I wanted to do was melt the phone because I tried using it while apparating.”

Tony huffed and pointed at the door on the next landing, the one for Steve’s place.

“Remind me to get you a Stark Phone. Then there’s no more surprise visits.”

“Aye, aye.” Sirius winked and saluted Tony sarcastically. He stopped just before opening the door and turned around the face Tony. “What are your plans for Harry? About… school?”

Tony crossed his arms with a frown.

“I don’t like Hogwarts and I don’t trust Gandalf,” he said bluntly. “What’s the real reason he wants Harry at Hogwarts?”

Sirius looked around them, squinting in the shadows of the stairwell, before he leaned a shoulder against Steve’s door and tapped his boot on the floor.

“Albus likes to have everyone under his thumb,” Sirius said quietly, his voice still echoing in the empty stairwell. “Harry’s a big player in the war, Albus wants him under his watch. Albus isn’t a bad guy, but he’s winning a war, you see. He’s looking at the big picture, not the individuals. And it’s going to be hard to involve Harry in anything now, which is good,” he added quickly when Tony looked unimpressed.

“Mate, look, I don’t want Harry caught up in any of it. If it were up to me, I’d have Harry in bloody Asia acting like a muggle and keeping him out of it all.”

“It’s not up to you,” Tony reminded him, “it’s up to me.”

Sirius nodded and relaxed from his stiff pose. He grinned as if Tony had washed away five years off his shoulders along with a heavy weight.

“So you’re going to tell Albus no?” he asked eagerly.

“If that’s what the kid wants,” Tony said. He smirked and gestured to the door. “I’m not asking him tonight though. I think you’ve ruined his birthday enough.”

Sirius let out a bark-like laugh that sounded enough like the dog he could change in to that Tony wondered how much animagus were linked to wizards’ personalities.

“Let’s get the cold shoulder over with, eh?”

The two of them entered Steve’s apartment through the kitchen entrance and Tony threw his head back with a silent groan when only Steve and Pepper were at the table with an untouched birthday cake in front of them.

“Where’s Harry and his friends?” Tony asked Pepper, shaking his head at the questioning look she gave him.

They’d have plenty of time to talk about all of it. Once Sirius had a minute with Harry and Tony got Dumbledore out of his place.

And once Tony had a drink which he didn’t bother looking for in Steve’s cabinets.

“Happy took Peter and Gwen home, Harry’s in the gym,” Pepper said. She pointed to the spare room Steve had that Tony used as a lab on his floor and Steve used as an at home gym.

Tony waited until Sirius bound off to the gym before sinking in a chair and scrubbing his face with his hands.

“What happened?” Steve asked Tony. “Do we trust him alone with Harry?”

“Yeah,” Tony sighed. He forced a grateful nod to Pepper when she tossed him a bottle of water. Water was good, water was needed when heavy drinking was needed. “Long story short, evil wizard found where we live, sent evil minion wizards, Gandalf the lame came, scared away minion wizards. Now he wants to take Harry to Hogwarts to teach him to be a—”

“YOU’VE LOST YOUR BLOODY MIND, PADFOOT! DO YOU KNOW HOW WORRIED I’VE BEEN?”

Tony grinned smugly. He told Sirius that it wasn’t going to be all hugs and happy smiles.

It was always vindicating when someone else was on the receiving end of Harry’s defensive anger.

“Anyway, Gandalf wants Harry at Hogwarts. ‘Blah, blah, blah, legacy, blah, blah, blah, Harry’s a target, he shares DNA with the bad wizard, blah, blah, blah’.” Tony rubbed his chin and nodded. “Yeah, I think that covers it.”

“Oh my god.” Pepper rubbed her forehead with her thumbs. “Evil wizards.”

“Evil wizards,” Tony repeated.

“God damned evil wizards.”

Tony was too tired, too busy trying to listen to the dull sounds of Harry and Sirius arguing to even give Steve shit for using such naughty language.

 

The three of them sat for another fifteen minutes in a heavy silence that was only occasionally broken by muffled words and barks coming from Steve’s gym. Pepper looked as stunned as she had when Tony came home with a metal heart, Steve had his eyes screwed up in thought, no doubt planning out how he thought the team should handle the wizard. And Tony just felt overwhelmed to the point of being numb.

Tony wouldn’t trade all that made Harry who he was for anything. But it was hard enough protecting Harry from people who wanted to hurt ‘Iron Man’. He never factored on the kid bringing in his own list of enemies against ‘the Boy Who Lived’.

It was kind of funny, in a definitely not funny way. Tony and Harry had so much in common, but it was all just crazy shit. Both famous, both looked at as heroes, both with their own list of enemies.

Except Tony was a forty year man with a suit made of iron and shoulder broad enough to carry his weight. Harry was a scrawny (barely) fifteen year boy who had nightmares and enough baggage to keep a team of therapists busy for a year.

“Team meeting tomorrow at ten,” Tony told Steve just before the gym door opened. Steve nodded in confirmation. They’d need to find this evil wizard hunting Harry and take him out.

It would be an excellent time for Thor to swoop down to earth and lend a helping hammer, but Tony wasn’t too concerned with the teams odds without him either.

Harry and Sirius shuffled out in the kitchen, Harry with his head ducked, shoulders raised defensively. Sirius with a small smile that made Tony think Harry got over his anger pretty quick.

“Hey, kid,” Tony tried to give Harry a smile, but he grimaced instead when he saw Harry’s hands before the kid could stuff them in his pocket. “You take a swing at Sirius?”

Harry’s knuckles were bruised and, based on the swelling in one of them, probably had at least one break.

“I bloody well did not,” Harry snapped, lifting his head and flashing a scowl at Tony. “Steve’s punching bag is filled with rocks.”

“It’s really not.” Steve was already on his feet and grabbing an ice pack out of his freezer that he tossed to Harry. An idiot move considering Harry used his right hand to catch it, hissing when his fingers curled around it. “Come back when that’s healed and I’ll teach you how to throw a proper punch.”

Harry stuffed the ice pack in his back pocket and glanced up at his godfather.

“Hands flat on the table, kiddo,” Sirius said cheerfully, pulling his wand out. He waited until Harry did as ordered before tapping the break lightly and healing it instantly with a flash of blue light. “Once more.”

Sirius ran his wand across both sets of knuckles, disappearing the bruises, and earning a shocked gasp of surprise from Pepper and a deep look of loathing from Harry.

“Suddenly you know a spell for bruises?” Harry asked Sirius as he absently rubbed his hands together.

“Crazy thing that was,” Sirius said with a tiny smirk that Harry clearly didn’t find amusing, “I just learned it the other day. I think it was Hermione who taught it to me. Oh! Speaking of which!” Sirius dug in the inner pocket of his leather jacket and pulled out a manilla envelope that he handed to Harry.

“I told her what you said about pictures and she called her parents, had them dig out her scrapbooks, and I think they’re all in there along with some letters from your friends.”

“Changing the fucking subject,” Harry muttered, though he did open the envelope and grin at the contents when he peeked inside. He aimed that grin at Sirius for a brief moment, getting a full blown smile in return. “Thanks, Padfoot.”

Tony watched the easy way Sirius ruffled Harry’s hair with no small amount of jealousy. They were always like that; Harry was quick to anger with Sirius, but just as quick to forgive. They had a bond that went back over two years and Tony often felt like he’d never eclipse it.

If Harry had a choice, Tony was sure he’d still prefer to live with Sirius. They knew each other, they were so damn alike. Sirius understood magic and their war and Harry’s history and Tony was some foreign exchange student desperately trying to play catch up.

“I guess I’ll go get Albus and head out,” Sirius said with a disappointed huff. He winked at Harry, “Maybe next year we’ll celebrate on a beach, eh?”

“Yeah,” Harry laughed and held his smile all through the goodbyes. Tony watched it fade to a blank look the instant Sirius left though.

“He’ll be fine,” Pepper told Harry softly with a kind smile that only Pepper could make look authentic.

“I know.” Harry’s voice was flat and he began fidgeting with the envelope he held. He glanced around Steve’s dining room and bit his lip. “I’m going to go to bed, actually.”

Tony looked at the cake and felt a flash of anger and grief that the first chance he had to celebrate his kid’s birthday got ruined.

“You have a lifetime worth of birthdays after this,” Pepper reached over and squeezed Tony’s hand bracingly. “He’s not going anywhere.”

“Yeah.” Tony patted Pepper’s hand and forced a smile. “And next year I can take him car shopping.”

“If the wizards don’t interrupt again,” Steve said, suuuper helpfully.

 

“Real nice, Steve,” Pepper snapped when Tony lumbered up the stairs after Harry.

Steve shrugged. “If Tony wants his kid to be safe, we need to deal with the wizards.”

“We do need to deal with the damn wizards,” Pepper agreed.

 

Tony took one look around the clean and no longer decorated apartment and scoffed quietly. He wondered who cleaned while they watched over Dumbledore? Probably Bruce or Rhodey. The threat of death couldn’t convince Nat or Clint to clean.

Tony shot a text off to Rhodey, thanking him for coming, inviting him to the team meeting the next day, then he moved to the liquor cabinet.

If ever he’d earned a drink, it was then.

 

It wasn’t until Tony was on his third glass of Johnnie Walker and aimlessly roaming the too-quiet apartment that he entered his bedroom and saw Harry’s gift on his dresser.

Damn. In all the wizard bullshit, Tony forgot he never even got to give Harry his gift.

Tony traded his glass tumbler for the wrapped book once he saw he still had an hour to give it to Harry. Knowing Harry, he was probably awake anyway.

 

“Come in,” Harry called when Tony knocked lightly on his door. Tony poked his head in and saw that Harry was sitting at his desk chair, his head tipped back, the ice pack covering his forehead. He had the dog on his lap, bird on his shoulder, and the photographs and letters from his friends spread across his desk top.

“Headache?” Tony asked lightly. He moved to sit on the foot of Harry’s neatly made bed, watching the kid with no small amount of concern.

How much weight did Tony’s son carry through the unlucky circumstances of his birth? How much pain could Harry have avoided if Tony had just known about him when he was born?

“Mm,” Harry hummed something that was nearly an agreement. “I like the way ice feels on my face. Reminds me of winter.”

Tony grinned at the return of Harry-sass.

“I thought fall was your favorite season?” he asked.

Harry pulled the ice pack off and tossed it on his dresser over his shoulder with damn good aim considering the room was dark and he looked exhausted.

“It was a joke,” Harry sighed. He stared up at the ceiling before lolling his head to the side to look at Tony. “Are you here to tell me what Dumbledore wants? Am I supposed to go hide out in Grimmauld with Sirius or grab my wand and go fight some death eaters?”

“I figured we’d talk about that tomorrow. I actually just came to give you this.” Tony offered Harry his birthday present and scrounged up a smile for him. “Gandalf the Lame and Clifford the big black dog interrupted before I could give it to you.”

Harry picked his head up and rolled his chair over by the bed to slowly accept the gift Tony got him.

“Do you have a nickname for everyone?” Harry asked curiously as he fingered the edge of the red wrapping paper.

“Sure,” Tony shrugged and leaned back on Harry’s bed, holding himself up with both hands. “Your friend Gwen? Brenda Starr. Peter? Moe.”

Harry kept playing with the wrapping paper instead of actually opening the gift, though he paused even that to give Tony a suspicious look.

“Who’s Brenda Starr and Moe?”

Tony grinned. “Don’t worry about it, kid. Or just Google it tomorrow. Go on,” he nodded his head, “don’t leave me in suspense here.”

Harry peeled back the paper slowly, revealing a dark maroon and gold edged leather album. It wasn’t anything fancy, but Tony hoped the contents got the same smile that Sirius’ envelope of photos did. He opened the album and reached over to turn on his desk lamp when he realized it was too dark to read the first page.

“Last will and testament of Anthony Edward Stark,” Harry read aloud. He looked at Tony with a furrowed brow. “Why is your will here?”

“Safe keeping,” Tony told him with partial honesty. “You have a copy, I have a copy, and our fifty closest lawyers.”

Harry didn’t look convinced and he continued to squint at the legal document until he let out a choked sound.

“You’re mad,” he whispered, his eyes as round as Tony’s favorite oversized coffee mug. “You’re leaving me everything if you die before I do?”

“‘If’,” Tony laughed. “I better die before you, kid, but yeah. I mean, my dad left me the company, I’ll leave it to you, one day you can leave it to your kid.”

“I don’t know anything about running a bloody multibillion dollar company!” Harry yelped. “Leave it to Pepper!”

“Can’t,” Tony said breezily, “family tradition. Flip the page, the real present is past that.”

Tony had only included that to show Harry that when he said what’s his was Harry’s, he meant it.

Harry turned the page with all the slow precision of a bomb technician. If he expected any more shocks, he wasn’t disappointed.

“What…” Harry traced a finger across the youngest photo of Harry that Tony could find. It was grainy even after being cleaned up, but it was unmistakably Harry riding in a shopping cart a few weeks before he turned three. Tony had even done a bit of editing and taken out his ugly cousin who’d been hitting Harry in the head with a bottle of salad dressing.

“Where’d you get these?” Harry asked as he began flipping the pages more eagerly, still carefully, and stopped to stare at every single photo. Tony got distracted by the genuine and childlike smile that began to spread across Harry’s face and didn’t hear his question until Harry repeated himself.

“I’m not in to conspiracy theories, because they’re all true,” Tony told him seriously. “Big Brother? The eye in the sky that watches everything you do? It’s real and it has archives. And the archives just need some effort to dig through and you can find almost anything you need.”

Harry let out a delighted laugh at a photo of himself playing on a playground. He’d been a background picture, not really noticeable in the photo of the little girl with pigtails that had been the star of the photo, but once Tony cropped it and did some light edits, it looked like a photo of a seven year old Harry swinging on a swing.

“This is brilliant!” Harry turned that genuine smile on Tony and for the first time in Tony’s life he felt like he truly did something right. “This must have been a nightmare to do.”

It had taken Tony most of the night before to work on it, but he wasn’t going to admit that. Not when Harry looked so excited.

“The hardest part was picking an album,” Tony joked. “They had a cool superhero one I just knew you’d love, but it didn’t have enough pages to hold all the photos.”

Harry laughed again and moved from his chair to sit beside Tony at the foot of the bed.

“Look,” he pointed at a photo of just the most pathetic looking nine year old Tony had ever seen. Harry was wearing clothes that he absolutely drowned in while his face had a bright smile and a goat was eating corn from his hand. “My class went to a farm and I didn’t have a permission slip but my teacher didn’t even notice, so I got to go and blimey, I forgot about it, but that goat head-butt one of Dudley’s friends and knocked his arse in the mud.”

Tony listened to Harry as he shared crazy little stories for each of the older photos of himself that Tony managed to find.

 

“How’d you find this one?” Harry howled with laughter at a photo of himself and a man that had the be nearly Hulk sized at a train station. “That’s Hagrid, he’s the one that brought my letter. He’s half-giant and the kindest bloke you’d ever meet.”

 

“Blimey. I’m lucky the Ministry never saw this,” Harry laughed nervously at a CVT image of him two summers ago, a wand in his hand and a wooden trunk being drug behind him. The kid looked like hell in that photo too, furious and with a mark on his neck that looked like damned fingerprints. “That was the summer Sirius broke out from Azkaban, I blew up Vernon’s sister and thought I’d have to be a fugitive.”

 

Tony didn’t even mind when Harry put aside the album to snag the photos off his desk and begin telling Tony the story that went along with each picture.

 

“I didn’t even know Hermione took this… alright, it looks pretty bloody odd to be hiding in a bush, right? But I was hiding from my defense professor, this bloke named Lockhart…”

 

“Oh! Brilliant! Look! Hermione got a photo from last summer! Alright, so these are Ron’s siblings, I can’t figure out who’s who from this distance… Anyway, this is quidditch. It’s the best magical sport there is. And I’m seeker for Gryffindor.” Harry grinned cheekily up at Tony. “I bet my Firebolt can outfly your suit.”

 

That led to an hour long explanation on quidditch and what Harry’s role in it was. Which they held in the kitchen with pieces of birthday cake and glasses of cold milk.

 

And by two, when they were both yawning more then talking as they stretched out on the couches together, Tony was sure he’d be smiling in his sleep at the quick, one-armed, hug he’d gotten from Harry after they sorted his photo collection in to ‘magical’ and ‘muggle’ albums.

Even with the wizard bullshit, Tony felt like maybe he’d salvaged Harry’s birthday just enough that Harry would look back at it with some sort of fondness.

Chapter Text

Harry hated the lifts in the tower. He couldn’t stand the way that the doors just opened right in someone’s home. No knocking, no ability to say ‘piss off’, just…

Ding!

And you were standing in their home.

Or, in Harry’s current case, he was standing in Steve’s home, shifting around uncomfortably as he tried to find Steve without venturing too far past the lifts.

Steve had told him to come over after lunch, an odd invite Harry nearly turned down when it came at breakfast.

“You busy today, kid?”

“Very.”

“He’s not.”

Harry had glared at Tony, betrayed by his honesty.

“I figured maybe you’d want to learn how to defend yourself if you were ever in a fight,” Steve said. “It wouldn’t hurt with the wizards on your tail.”

Harry snorted at the mental image of punching Voldemort in the face. He wouldn’t even get close enough to hit him before he’d get crucio’d.

“At a minimum, if you ever saw that asshole Ferret-face again you could take a swing without breaking your hand,” Tony said with a wink.

And since Harry had nothing to do until after Tony got off work and they ‘talked’ about whatever Dumbledore wanted over dinner, Harry figured he didn’t have much to lose. Of all of Tony’s mad friends, aside from Rhodey, Steve seemed the least likely to take a swing at Harry in private.

It’d probably be a bit of a scandal if Tony Stark’s kid said Captain America smacked him around.

It was that reassurance that led Harry to walking casually to the gym door and knocking before poking his head inside.

The gym in Steve’s place was nice, interesting really. Harry had explored it a bit as he’d paced the night before, stressed out and furious to be excluded from the discussion with Dumbledore. The one that Tony swore they’d discuss together at dinner and Harry didn’t believe at all.

A likely story, in Harry’s opinion. Probably just a way to brush him off, ‘don’t worry about it, kiddo, the adults will handle it’.

So pacing the polished floor of the gym, punching the red bags hanging from the ceiling, and throwing the heavy rubber balls across the boxing ring in the middle of the room had been an acceptable way to release that frustration for a while. It eased his frustration almost as much as seeing Sirius in person had eased his worries.

Nobody would be more relieved than Harry once Pettigrew was caught.

“Hey, kid!” Steve stood in a white tshirt and a pair of black athletic shorts, similar enough to Harry’s tshirt and sweat pants that he felt better about his choice. Aside from quidditch practice and running from Dudley’s gang, Harry never had much cause to ‘work out’ and had to guess at what to wear. Not that it really mattered, but Harry would prefer not to look stupid if he’d shown up in the wrong clothes.

Steve swiped his forehead, as if wiping away sweat that… that literally didn’t exist… and waved Harry in.

“Come on in,” Steve said. He waved a hand toward the red punching bag he’d been working over before Harry arrived. “I was just warming up.”

Harry looked at the stack of destroyed bags, bags he knew for a fact felt as hard as if they were filled with rocks, and nodded.

“Right,” he said slowly. “Warming up.”

Steve flashed Harry a smile, clearly amused at Harry’s disbelief. “It’s just super serum, kid, I’m nothing special.”

“I know.”

Steve chuckled and went to a shelf filled with gloves of all sizes and colors.

“You sound just like your dad,” he said as he began picking up gloves then squinting at Harry before shaking his head and picking up a new one. It reminded Harry of Ollivander all those years ago and wondered if finding gloves would be as much of a hassle as a wand had been.

“Try these on,” Steve said. He tossed Harry a dark blue pair, insultingly small.

They fit perfect.

Harry flexed his fingers in the gloves and tried not to compare himself to Dudley with his boxing gloves that dotted Harry’s rib cage with bruises.

“We’ll start with the gloves so you don’t hurt your hands until you get the hang of it,” Steve explained. Harry kept his face impassive, bored even, but he didn’t relish shattering his knuckle again. Especially if Sirius wasn’t there to heal it for him.

“Come stand here.”

Harry kept his face blank and his muscles taut while he slowly moved over to where Steve indicated. As soon as Harry was in place, Steve’s hands moved toward him and Harry jumped away.

And then felt a sick feeling of shame swam through Harry’s veins as Steve’s hands were low and he had only been moving to adjust the punching bag.

Steve was either too polite to say anything or hadn’t noticed at all, but Harry suspected it was the first. Just as Harry was debating on taking the gloves off and going back to his and Tony’s flat, Steve spoke up, casual as could be.

“So you want to start at your hip, then move your shoulders in with the punch,” he said, showing Harry what he meant as he explained it. “And feel how those gloves want your thumb tucked beneath the second knuckle? Hold it like that.”

Harry waited until Steve backed away, leaning against a complicated looking black and silver machine, before he approached the bag again.

“Like this?” Harry asked before pulling his hand back and striking the bag.

“Harder,” Steve said. “Turn your shoulders in with it.”

Harry did and felt the bag give a little beneath his knuckles, a tightness in his chest loosening.

“Harder.”

Harry grunted when he swung again.

“Come on kid, hit that bag like it’s someone you hate.”

Steve’s words caused Harry to pause for a moment, caught off-guard. Someone he hated? There was no shortage of people that Harry hated. He hated Voldemort for taking his parents, he hated Pettigrew for betraying them. He hated Professor Snape for berating him and never giving Harry a chance. He hated Draco Malfoy for his taunts and refusal to leave Harry alone.

Harry hated Vernon Dursley for never treating him like he thought family should. Harry hated Petunia Dursley for surely seeing some part of her sister in him and turning her back on him anyway. He hated the way they so easily signed Harry over to Tony, a relief to be done with him, he was sure.

Harry could make a list of all the people he hated. Truly hated, even. Not just ‘Psycho shook me once and I hate her’.

But hated enough to hit? To strike like Harry had been?

“No.” Harry ripped the gloves off and threw them on the floor. He backed away from it, his heart racing and his blood pounding in his ears. Harry raised his eyes defiantly to where Steve stood and shook his head. “I’m not hitting someone just because I hate them.”

Steve crossed his arms and raised his eyebrows. He looked surprised, but not unhappy. “Why not?”

“Because it’s cruel,” Harry spat. He scowled and kicked the gloves further from him, sliding them across the perfectly clean floor to land at Steve’s feet. “Would you like it if someone hated you so they just hit you for it?”

“Did you like it?”

Harry laughed bitterly, “No.”

Who would? Who wanted to be struck? Especially if someone did nothing to deserve it. Voldemort could get punched by almost any witch or wizard in the world and they’d probably have a damn good reason for it. But Harry? Before he even went to Hogwarts? Spilling milk wasn’t a crime, and Harry never should have had to cry over it.

“Your uncle?”

Harry’s head snapped up. He’d been zoning out, staring at the gloves and thinking of his relatives. But Steve’s words brought him to the present and sent a flutter of panic through his chest. His heart raced so quickly that he thought it may truly explode inside of him.

Steve still stood there, looking casual and relaxed, but there was a look in Steve’s eyes that made Harry realize what he’d inadvertently admitted. It was a look Harry avoided at all costs, one that told him all his denial and refusal to look at his life as the crap show it had been was for nothing.

It was pity.

And Harry needed to get out of there.

“I’m done,” he said. He turned on his heel and stormed to the door, shutting it gently and carefully behind him, before he ran for the stairs and sprinted up them.

Harry didn’t stop running until he made it to his room where he was free to slam the door shut as hard as he wanted.

Steve and his questions and offers to teach Harry to fight could piss off. Harry was a wizard. He didn’t need to throw a punch to defend himself, he had magic.

 

And after a scalding shower to calm himself down, Harry used his mirror to call his links to his magic.

“Hey, kiddo.” Sirius was grinning in the mirror once Harry called his name. His smile slipped as his eyes, much too sharp, scrutinized Harry closely. “Everything good?”

“You have a phone now, let Hermione and Ron use your mirror,” Harry said as he dodged the question. Was everything good? Not really, no. But when were things ever good for longer than an hour or two?

Sirius’ lips pinched together for a moment before he smiled, easygoing as ever.

“You know I made this mirror, right?”

“Yeah, yeah,” Harry grinned just a little. “You’re a genius, Padfoot. Now go give your mirror to Hermione.”

“Fine.” Sirius huffed and Harry had a brief flash of Buckbeak that made him frown.

“Isn’t your house huge?” Harry asked while Sirius walked and Harry saw a little bit of decor behind him.

“Supposedly,” Sirius quipped.

“Then quit sitting in your room,” Harry said. He cleared his throat and tried to remember the exact bit of shit advice Sirius gave him in his fourth year right after he’d been chosen as a champion in the tournament.

“Go be around people who like you, kiddo,” Harry poorly mimicked Sirius’ drawl. He flicked his head, as Sirius did when his hair was down and hanging in his face. “You’ll go mad in your room.”

“Dorm,” Sirius said, correcting Harry’s recitation. He laughed at Harry and shook his head, his grey eyes glittering fondly. “I’m already mad and the only person who likes me is in New York.”

Harry sat in his desk chair and spun it around. “Remus likes you.”

“Not since I threatened to kill him.”

Harry laughed. “Imagine that,” he drawled. “What for?”

“He’s shagging my cousin,” Sirius said casually, either a response or an evasion, Harry couldn’t figure out which. “Oi! Hermione! Here!” Sirius smiled once more in the mirror, “Love you, kiddo.”

Harry hummed and nodded.

It was… uncomfortable when people said they loved him. Sirius had been the first, Tony the most recent.

And Harry never knew if they wanted him to say it back or not.

He couldn’t ponder the issue long though because Sirius handed the mirror over to Hermione who only looked confused for a brief second before her face split in a perfectly white smile.

“HARRY!!” Hermione’s high pitched squeal caused Harry to both wince at the sheer screech of it and also chuckle at the familiarity of it. She had her face right in the mirror, her nose nearly touching the glass. “RON!! RON!” she yelled. “HURRY!”

“Oh, I miss you so much!” Hermione cried in the mirror. “How are you? Where- no, don’t tell me, I don’t know occlumency. Are you okay? Safe? You look good! How are you and Sirius talking so much? Are you coming here soon? Sirius said—”

“Let him breathe, Hermione,” Ron laughed. His cheerful looking face smushed next to Hermione’s in the mirror, triggering a blush on Hermione’s cheeks that made Harry smirk.

They looked just as they always had. Ron and his easy grin and crooked tooth on a face full of freckles. His red hair was longer, hanging in his eyes. Hermione’s skin was a little more tan, a sparse smattering of freckles on her nose, but they were the same.

And Harry felt so different.

“Everything’s changed,” Harry blurted once it clicked in him. “And I think I hate it.”

Hermione’s eyes softened and Ron’s hardened. They were familiar reactions; Hermione was ready to empathize and Ron was preparing to offer solutions.

“Hold on,” Hermione cut Ron off when he opened his mouth to say something. “Harry, I love you so dearly—”

Harry couldn’t imagine why.

“—and of course I want to know everything, but if it’s something you don’t want anyone powerful,” Hermione’s eyes widened as she stressed the word, “to know, then you can’t tell us. Not until we figure out this occlumency and block our minds.”

Harry didn’t understand the entirety of what Hermione was saying, but he did recognize that she was telling him that even if he couldn’t tell them everything, they were still there.

He went ahead and silently forgave them for not trying to write when he was at the Dursley’s house.

“I think the cat’s out of the bag anyway,” Harry said, adopting one of Pepper’s expressions he’d heard her use, “so listen up…”

Harry told them about Tony, heavily editing the details on how his parents apparently both shagged the man (it may be lucky that Harry had much more recent things to dream about or he was certain that would be a frequent nightmare).

Hermione had shrieked, actually shrieked, when Harry said Tony’s name.

“YOUR DAD IS IRON MAN?!”

Ron scrunched his nose, “What is that? Like a disease?”

“Yes,” Harry told him solemnly. “A fatal disease to aliens.”

Ron had been confused, but Hermione hushed his questions and urged Harry to go on.

So Harry told them about Peter and Gwen, scowling with red cheeks when Ron had a knowing grin on his face. Harry didn’t even tell Ron they were kind of together, and as far as Harry knew, hoped, Ron was unaware of Harry’s newly realized ‘sexuality’, so he could quit grinning.

Harry desperately hoped Ron never knew about the dreams about his brother he used to have. Harry hardly liked to think of them, he shuddered to imagine Ron or the twins with that kind of ammunition against him.

Harry also told Ron and Hermione about the night before with Dumbledore showing up and Harry being sent from the room like a child. Sirius refused to tell Harry about it, Tony claimed they’d discuss it later, and Harry felt like he’d somehow been cut adrift.

“It’s mad,” Harry told them as he finished his lengthy tale. “I’m the one who wasn’t too young to fight him in the graveyard, but now I’m a kid?”

“Mm. Who said you weren’t too young for that?” Hermione asked slowly. Her eyes had gone as wide as Dobby the House-Elve’s since Harry mentioned Tony Stark and were just beginning to return to a normal size.

Harry sputtered while he tried to think through Hermione’s question.

“I mean, it’s just- I- I deserve to know what’s going on,” Harry finally said firmly. “Sirius wouldn’t tell me, he said that Tony will.”

“So he probably will,” Ron said. He stuck his tongue out when Harry glared at him. “He sounds like a decent bloke.”

“He’s a hero,” Hermione said. She sounded like she did back in the early days of Lockhart and it made Harry laugh, all the more so when Ron looked putout by her tone. “Harry, I think you can trust him.”

“You think I should trust everyone,” Harry sighed. He spun his chair around and wished he had something to toss in the air. His fingers itched like there was something they needed to be doing.

“I don’t,” Hermione disagreed.

“Certainly not any defense teachers anymore,” Ron grinned.

Hermione gave Harry a familiar patient look. It was the one that said Harry didn’t see the world like everyone else and she was about to call him out on it.

“Harry, he hasn’t let you down or lied to you yet, right?” Hermione said slowly, giving Harry time to process her question. Tony hadn’t really done anything to let Harry down. In fact, Harry just mentioned that he wished he had photos of himself, like every other kid in the world, and Tony got them.

And so far, as sarcastic as Tony was and as many jokes as he made, Harry couldn’t think of a single time when he’d actually lied to him.

“So just ask him and let him explain,” Hermione said when Harry didn’t say anything. “And call us back to tell us what’s happening.”

“Because Hermione is nosy,” Ron said with a sage tone and a teasing twinkle in his eyes. “We do miss you though, mate.”

Harry looked at his two best friends, the ones that had been the first people to like him - mood swings and mad adventures and all.

“I miss you guys too.”

 

Harry wasn’t testing Tony, he merely just waited at dinner to see if he would bring up Dumbledore’s mysterious visit first or not.

Thankfully, he did.

Tony sat across from Harry at the kitchen bar, both of them picking at the tacos and rice that Tony had delivered from a restaurant. Tony had asked Harry about his day, Harry hadn’t responded past a dry comment about Steve being annoying.

Harry hoped he hadn’t gone running to Tony about it. Maybe he should have stayed, smoothed over the moment, but he’d needed space more than he needed to smooth things over.

Also, Harry was very bad at smoothing things over. He probably would have just made it worse had he stayed.

After that though, they’d been quiet and Harry had began to believe that Tony wasn’t going to bring it up at all. But then Tony dropped his fork to his plate and scrubbed his face with his hands.

“The evil wizard with the dumb name knows where you are,” Tony said bluntly.

Harry’s fork slipped from his fingers, hitting his plate with a clatter. It felt as inevitable as it felt ominous. Harry always knew, since he was eleven really, that Voldemort would succeed when Vernon failed and would kill Harry one day.

Harry just hoped to have a lot more days. He’d wanted time, time to live before he died. And, if he were honest with himself, he wanted to die on his own terms. He didn’t want Voldemort to have the victory in wiping out the entire Potter family.

But Harry was a Stark too and Voldemort found him.

“Oh.” Harry said, struggling to pull up his apathy in face of his shock. Harry was grateful when Tony kept talking, sparing him from responding.

“Yeah,” Tony frowned and tapped the counter beside his plate with an irritated tempo. Harry unconsciously felt himself matching the tempo with his own finger, waiting on Tony to elaborate.

“Gandalf,” Harry’s lips twitched as Tony compared Dumbledore to the wizard in the movies he liked, “came to scare away the mini evil wizards that were sent here to see if Thor was around or not.”

“Thor? The God?” Harry asked quickly, recalling seeing him fight his own brother in Tony’s video. “Why did that matter?”

“Because Voldemort, Jesus Christ what a stupid name, apparently didn’t want to be struck down by thunder,” Tony said, a shadow of his usual smirk on his face. “So Gandalf‘s spy on the dark side—”

“Who?”

“That guy Sirius hates,” Tony waved his hand airily. “Snape.”

Harry’s jaw dropped at that bit of news. He’d known that Dumbledore had a hard task he assigned Snape after the third task, he had no idea that it was to spy on Voldemort.

Merlin.

Harry leaned forward, his fingers finally still as his mind raced. “What else?”

Tony looked surprised for a moment by Harry’s intent interest, but Harry wasn’t going to pass up the opportunity of someone feeding him fresh information on the war.

“Well Snape told Gandalf that Darth Vader, don’t laugh, kid, it’s better than Voldemort, was sending some stormtroopers to our place and he came to scare them away.”

Harry waited a moment to see if Tony was done. When he saw that he was, he frowned and sat back.

“That’s it?” he asked.

“Gandalf also wants you back at Hogwarts,” Tony said quickly, saying it like an afterthought. “I told him you didn’t want to go and that—”

“I do.”

It was Tony’s turn to gape at Harry then. For someone so unflappable, Tony looked shocked. Harry himself was shocked, but…

But Hogwarts had Ron and Hermione. Hogwarts had Harry’s quidditch team and his friends. And if Voldemort and Dumbledore knew where Harry was, if they were showing up and causing complications, then why couldn’t Harry go back with his friends to a place he once loved?

Clearly hiding out in New York wasn’t working anyway. And Harry couldn’t be a coward any longer. Sirius said Harry was important to the war, and Tony put on his iron suit and fought evil when he needed to.

And Harry could do the same.

Harry could go to Hogwarts, learn the magic that would actually help him defend himself, and Harry could make them proud - Tony, Sirius, James, Lily - and do what they did.

And then he could go home.

Tony took a deep breath. He took a sip of his canned soda. And then he leaned back in his seat.

“No.”

Chapter Text

“No.”

Tony’s stomach twisted when Harry blinked at him with his jaw practically on the table. It would be really funny if Tony wasn’t sure it was about to be a fight.

How could Harry think Tony would let him go back? What parent in their right mind would? Even a brand new parent doing a half-ass job, like Tony, could recognize that school was insane and kids should stay fifty feet away at all times.

“Pardon?” Harry asked, his voice nearly as warm as Steve used to be.

Tony cleared his throat and leaned back in his chair. “You should go to Midtown with your friends, like we planned, kid.”

Harry narrowed his eyes. “I thought it was my decision?”

“And if you want to go to Illvermony or York, great,” Tony shrugged. “Not Hogwarts.”

“Why not?” Harry demanded. “I’ve been going there for years!”

Tony threw his hands up. Was that a real question?

“And all sorts of crazy shit happened!” Tony said. He took a deep breath to center himself, no need to get worked up. “I’m sorry, kid, I’m the parent here and that means I have to pay the taxes and make some rules.”

Harry got to his feet and kicked his chair beneath the counter, glaring at Tony harshly the whole time.

“I’m going back,” Harry said firmly, more than a little cocky and irritated. “Just because you shagged my mum doesn’t mean you can keep me from going to my school.”

Harry turned on his heel and stormed to his room, pausing long enough to gently close his door behind him.

Tony preferred it when he slammed it, honestly. At least then it wasn’t the weirdest damn thing to see a pissed off teenager closing his door silently during a fit.

The internet really hadn’t prepared Tony for parenting.

 

“You made the right call,” Steve assured Tony later that night when Harry was asleep and the team came over to bond. Tony personally did all his best bonding over a bottle of whisky, which was what he patiently explained when the others showed up only to find Tony still seated at the kitchen island with a bottle in one hand and a glass in the other.

It hadn’t taken long to catch the others up on the newest ‘Tony didn’t know how to be a parent’ dilemma and their support for his decision was vindicating.

“That school doesn’t even sound too bad,” Nat shrugged. She poured herself a second drink and took a sip while the guys gawked at her. “What?” she demanded. “It could be worse.”

Tony grimaced and swirled his drink around, idly wishing he’d thought to grab ice cubes before pouring his fourth glass.

“The kid has some horror story happen every year,” Bruce said, both entirely sober and rational. He patted Tony’s shoulder kindly. “Better for him to be mad now than to risk him dying.”

“Yeah.” Tony sighed and sent a forlorn look at Harry’s door. “It’s just… we’d been getting along so well.”

In fact, Tony had began to feel like maybe he could be a real dad. Like one of the lame ones on TV whose kid didn’t hate him and wish for a different parent. Tony would be a thousand times better looking than Gomez Adams, but only nearly as fun.

But he couldn’t even be Cousin It if his kid wouldn’t talk to him.

“You will again,” Clint said with a careless wave of his hand. “The kid’s all buddy-buddy with his godfather again, right? So send him to MIT with his nerds and he’ll get over it.”

Tony rubbed the back of his neck with both thumbs, pointlessly trying to massage away the stress he’d built since the instant he said ‘no’.

Steve cleared his throat, drawing Tony’s eyes up to him.

“If you’re not sending him to the wizard school, I’m telling you, Tony, the kid needs therapy. I- did he tell you about boxing today?”

“No…” Tony sat up and narrowed his eyes at Steve. “He said you were annoying, what’d you do?”

“I told the kid to punch the bag like it was someone he hated,” Steve said, holding his hands up innocently. “He- well, no offense, but he’s not exactly overflowing with physical strength, so I was trying to perk him up. You know, add some fire.”

“So who’d he imagine?” Bruce asked. His eyes flicked toward Tony and he frowned when he saw Tony catch the movement. “Oh come on, it’s not unrealistic.”

Tony threw back the rest of his drink and sighed. “Did he imagine me?”

“No.”

Good.

“He said he wouldn’t do it because it was cruel to hit someone just because he didn’t like them.”

That… Tony’s lips curled up at the edges. That was actually kind of cute. Sirius said Albus wanted Harry to win a war, and the kid was a pacifist.

Tony Stark’s son was a pacifist.

Hysterical, truly.

Nat caught Tony’s eyes and she smirked, sharing his thoughts apparently.

Then Steve wiped the amusement off all their faces when he added, “He said he didn’t like it when it happened to him.”

“Jesus Christ.” Bruce tossed his glasses on the island and wiped his face with his hand. “You know, I’d really like to let the Big Guy go a few rounds with those people.”

Tony, Clint, and Nat all raised their glasses in silent agreement.

“Don’t get snippy, but… what if that school was the first place the kid felt safe?” Steve asked, his expression frank and genuine. As if Mister Red White and Honest could be anything but. “Even if it wasn’t safe, it must have been better than his home.”

“Helpful, really,” Tony said, his tone thick with fake cheer. “‘This crazy wizard school was safer than a house full of assholes, let the kid go!’”

“That’s not exactly what I—”

“What’s worst case scenario if the kid goes to the wizard school?” Nat asked, cutting Steve off. She raised a mocking brow at Tony and lowered her voice to a juvenile tone, “You miss him too much?”

“Ignore Nat, she forgets that assassin school isn’t normal,” Clint said. He bumped his shoulder against Nat’s and rolled his eyes. “Besides the fact that Harry going to that wizard school is exactly what that manipulative shit wanted, Tony said he’d nearly died there half a dozen times.”

“He did,” Tony agreed with a nod. He refilled his glass and held it across the counter to Clint, clinking their tumblers together. “Sirius said he fought a giant murderous snake and a hundred of those soul stealing demons and that’s not even counting the whole ‘kidnapped’ shit after he fought a dragon.”

The sad part about all that was Tony was certain he was forgetting a handful of life threatening situations the kid had been in.

“He also made his first friends, felt like he had a home for the first time. He was made the youngest seeker in a century, won the quidditch house cup, and saw his parents for the first time.”

The team all spun their heads around to stare at Harry, who had managed to silently sneak up on ‘Earth’s mightiest heroes’. Harry stood between the sofa and the island, his arms folded across his chest and his eyes firmly aimed at Tony.

“I didn’t come here to mess up your fucking life,” he said, ignoring the others who all watched him with various expressions of curiosity on their faces. “And I certainly didn’t ask you to mess up mine.”

Harry, looking more like Tony than Tony himself did, twisted his lips to the side and strode across the room, snatching a bottle of water from the pantry. He didn’t technically turn his back to the silent team sitting together, but he did a damn good job of feigning indifference to their presence.

As soon as Harry returned to his room, his door shut gently, Steve gave Tony a sympathetic look.

“When does school start back up?” he asked.

“September first, apparently.”

***

It took nearly two weeks to negotiate times and places with Sirius; two weeks of cold shoulders and Harry conveniently disappearing with his friends when Tony was home.

Tony had never predicted how much he’d miss the snarky banter he shared with his son, but damn if he didn’t. The cold shoulders were just…

Effective, really. And not at all fun.

Age-appropriate though, according to the research Pepper kept sending to his inbox flagged as ‘crucial’.

Finally though, Tony had secured a meeting with old Albus and would sit down and hammer out the details of if Harry would return to Hogwarts. Just because the kid wanted to go, didn’t mean he should. And, yeah, it was a nice speech he gave, playing the orphan card, the ‘my first friends’ card, and the abusive home card, but Harry also jumped off a building recently so Tony couldn’t let him call all the shots.

Tony sat in the tea shop in downtown London, supposedly just across the street from the entrance to an entire magical village (and he was dying to see if the arc reactor in his chest alone was enough to grant him entrance to the place) waiting on Albus to arrive for a chit chat.

Nothing too serious, just his word, preferably in blood, that if Harry went back he’d be absolutely safe while Tony and his team hunted down Darth Vader. Sirius hadn’t liked the idea of Harry going back any more than Tony had, but they’d talked it through (in calls more than texts because Tony could only deal with emojis so long) and Sirius thought it was a decent compromise.

Tony couldn’t keep Darth Vader from popping in Stark Tower just yet, not until he found a wizard not in Albus’ pocket, but Hogwarts supposedly could.

And in walked the man that supposedly kept Hogwarts such a safe place.

Albus walked in the tea shop with another garish set of suit pants, bright blue that time, purple suspenders, and a pastel pink shirt that made Tony question his ability to see color. Colorblind or not, Albus spotted Tony even with his hat and sunglasses and merrily made his way toward the little table in the back Tony secured.

Tony would never, in a million years, know what made the man so fearsome. He looked like someone’s colorblind grandpa with his beard and his happy eyes.

“Mister Stark,” Albus offered Tony a hand that Tony gripped without getting up, “I was pleased to hear from you.”

“Most people are,” Tony quipped. He waited for Albus to sit before deciding to be gracious. “Tea?”

“Thank you.” Albus smiled warmly while Tony poured him a cup and pushed it over to him. Tony himself already had too much tea, too much coffee before that, and was fighting down jitters. Caffeine jitters would look like nerves, and something told him that Albus’ eyes, a twinkling blue, like Steve’s, were as sharp as they were disarming.

“Let’s not beat around the bush here,” Tony said, cutting to the chase and taking control of the conversation right from the start. “You want Harry at Hogwarts? Sell it to me.”

Albus, to the very little credit Tony would give him, didn’t bother to put up false protests. Sirius told Tony to be subtle, push for answers, but Tony Stark didn’t do subtle.

He was Iron Man, for God’s sake. Didn’t get much more blatant than a shining red and gold suit flying from a twenty-five story building with his name splayed across the side.

“How would I do such a thing?” Albus asked curiously. He stirred his spoon in his teacup, directing it with only a finger. He smiled at Tony’s glance. “I have taken quite a few precautions to ensure our presence is unnoticed.”

Tony hummed and took his hat off, keeping his glasses as a security against those intelligent eyes.

“Great.” Tony combed his fingers through his hair, carelessly messing it up. “So let’s hear the pitch, Albus. ‘If you’ll let Harry go to Hogwarts, I will…’?”

“Does Harry wish to return?” Albus asked. He smiled when Tony said nothing. “I thought he may.”

“He’s fifteen, he also wants to let aliens rule the world and his dog shit in the house,” Tony said firmly. “Let’s get this straight, I am the adult, the parent.”

For better or worse.

“Harry is the child.” Tony raised a brow at Albus’ unchanged or bothered smile. “Understood?”

“Perfectly,” Albus said genially. “Shall I explain to you the layers upon layers of wards that Hogwarts has to keep the students safe? Or shall I tell you how Voldemort would never dare breach our walls while I remain headmaster?”

“Both.” Tony took a sip of the tea and held the cup firmly in his hands while he crossed one leg over the other and sat back in the little white metal chair the tea shop favored. He waved a hand grandly, “Any time now, Gandalf.”

Tony listened intently while Albus described the magic that protected Hogwarts. All of it sounded medieval, but… effective at a base level. He brought up the previous events, the dragon and the snake and the dementors, and Albus sat there and discussed it with them while they went through the tea and scones.

“I will admit to making mistakes, I am merely human,” Albus sighed and his shoulders curved inward. He stared down at his empty cup as if it held the answers to all his problems. “I never meant for Harry to be another mistake on my conscious, Mister Stark.” He looked up and Tony held back a wince at the depth of anguish in his eyes, “I truly do care for your son.”

Tony flicked his sunglasses up on his head, wanting to be sure that Albus saw how serious he was, and leaned across the table until they were eye level with each other. He maintained a solemn and cool expression, refusing to break in the face of one old man’s sorrow.

Albus’ problems weren’t Tony’s, only Harry’s.

“Harry is the only family I have, he is my son,” Tony stressed. “I don’t care how important you are, how powerful you are, how ‘human’ you are. If Harry is hurt at all, if he is unhappy for a single instant, I will find you and I will kill you. I want that perfectly clear, because if you can’t guarantee his safety and his happiness, you damn well better tell me now because I’ll be extremely unhappy to discover it later.” Tony raised his brows, “Capisci?”

Albus’ voice was low, solemn, and the lines in his forehead smoothed away. “I can assure you that your son’s life matters a great deal to me. And,” he gave a slight smile, “I have never seen Harry as happy as he is during quidditch matches and during meals with Mister Weasley and Miss Granger.”

“An agreement, Gandalf,” Tony demanded, refusing to be sidetracked by a pretty picture of a happy wizard boy. There was a dark side to that picture, and Tony saw the aftermath. The aftermath that led to scars and nightmares, insecurities and fears. Flying with his friends wasn’t worth tacking another ten years to the therapy the kid needed.

“I give you my word that your son will be safe at Hogwarts. For the record, Mister Stark,” Albus gave Tony a warm smile, one that felt as real as the beard on his face, “I was quite shocked to hear that James was not Harry’s father. I can admit that it concerned me to discover that Harry came to you.”

“And now?” Tony asked tightly.

“And now,” Albus held his hand out once more, “I believe that you are precisely the parent that young Harry requires.”

Tony shook his hand and internally preened. He didn’t need Gandalf’s approval, God knew that man couldn’t run a school, let alone be a parent, but it was nice to hear all the same.

Tony would still blast his ass to Pakistan if a single hair on his son’s head got hurt at his magic school though.

“Excellent.” Tony leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms over his chest. “Now let’s talk about Mister Evil Wizard. I’ll make you a deal - you tell me what you know, my team takes him down.”

Albus tapped the tea kettle with his finger, instantly refilling it with steaming tea.

“I can think of no better team to work with,” he said agreeably. “Where shall I begin?”

“The beginning, usually,” Tony drawled arrogantly.

“There was once a brilliant boy at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle…”

 

Tony didn’t make it back to New York until the sun had long since set and Pepper had fallen asleep on the sofa. He smiled slightly at the puddle of drool the woman was leaving on a pillow that probably cost a hundred dollars and he sat his bags down long enough to cover her with the blanket from his own bed.

Pepper was good to have around, a steady support for Tony and Harry both.

Tony probably owed her a raise or a shopping spree.

He collected the bags and knocked lightly on Harry’s door.

“Hey,” Tony poked his head in when Harry called out a friendly greeting that was obviously not meant for him. Harry sat at his desk, his lamp on and his phone propped up. Tony had a brief flash of Peter’s face on Harry’s phone before Harry blocked his view with his shoulders.

“I’ll call you later,” Harry told Peter hastily. “Night.”

Tony dropped the bags by the door and leaned against the wall while Harry hung up on his boyfriend and spun around in his chair to glare at Tony. He didn’t say anything, he just sat there, glaring at Tony as if Tony truly had ruined his life by saying ‘no’ to the crazy magic school full of death traps.

Tony prayed to Thor himself that he wasn’t about to ruin the kid’s life by changing his answer.

“I got you something.” Tony reached in one of the bags and snagged the textbook that Gandalf took him to buy. He tossed it across the room to Harry, smirking at Harry’s automatic response to catch it.

“‘Standard Set of Spells…’” Harry trailed off and his eyes flicked up to Tony’s, full of confusion. “Where’d you get this?”

“Diagon Alley,” Tony said blithely. “Gandalf and I went, he told me what books to buy, and I grabbed some stuff for the owl too. Magic city? Amazing, by the way.”

It had been effective in showing Albus’ reputation in their community as well, which Tony suspected was his goal behind accompanying Tony through the shops. People were reverent of Albus and Tony saw fear in their eyes too. Sirius hadn’t exaggerated on the man, he was held in high regard.

By the magical community, anyway. Tony appreciated the information on Tom Riddle, a perfectly normal name that didn’t need changed to anything ridiculous, but Albus wasn’t a part of Tony’s team. So if Albus used Tony to get Harry somewhere he could keep an eye on him, it worked for the moment. Tony had pushed for information on Tom the entire trip, so he wasn’t innocent of any manipulations himself.

As long as Harry followed through on the conditions Tony wanted to set, Tony could handle his son leaving for boarding school. It would be a cold and lonely few months until Christmas break, but Tony could focus on Tom in that time and then maybe convince the kid to go to Midtown instead.

Maybe dangle Peter like a nerdy little gift of hormones for his son to chase clear to the normal high school that would send him home at three every day?

Harry got up and inched toward Tony, now squinting at the bags by his feet. He hesitated at the foot of his bed, his fingers twitching at his sides.

“Why?”

“You need them for school,” Tony shrugged. He pushed the bags toward Harry with his foot. “Let me know if anything’s missing. We can go to Landfara Way if you want normal stuff too. Quills, kid, really? Ugh,” Tony shuddered. “How does Hedwig feel about that?”

Harry’s brow furrowed and he looked from the bags to Tony. “You said no?” he said uncertainly.

Tony sighed and his casual stance became more of a slump against the messily painted red wall.

“Yeah, well, now I’m saying ‘yes with conditions’.”

Harry sat on the foot on his bed and crossed his arms defensively.

“What conditions?”

“You take your phone,” Tony started with the easiest one. “I can send you portable chargers since Gandalf said you don’t even have outlets- Muggle repellent, indeed.”

Harry’s lip twitched and the kid clamped down on it with his teeth while he nodded.

“And?”

“And you check in, like every day,” Tony went on. “No dangerous stunts, kid. No dragons, or giant snakes, or—”

“Or aliens and wormholes?” Harry drawled snarkily.

Tony grinned, “Precisely. Do as I say, not as I do.”

Harry snorted and he relaxed his tense pose. He ran a hand through his hair, his eyes roaming to the bags once more. “So I can go?” he asked slowly. Tony’s metaphorical heart clenched at the tapered down hope in Harry’s voice. “Really? Even after…?”

“Even after freezing me out and acting like every pissed off teenager ever?” Tony raised a brow at Harry’s look of chagrin. “Kid, I didn’t say no to ruin your life, I did it because, well, I care about you.”

Shoutout to you, Dad, thanks for making emotions so easy to express, Tony grimaced at how stilted and awkward he sounded. He added a shoutout to Harry’s scummy relatives for the way Harry looked as uncomfortable as Tony was. He kicked one bare foot in the carpet and Tony breezed ahead, putting them both out of their emotionally stunted misery.

“If you swear to stay safe, check-in every day, even just a quick text, then- then you can go.” Tony swallowed down his disappointment and quietly added. “And I want you to come back for Christmas.”

Harry peeked up at Tony through his messy bangs and eyelashes.

“You want me to come back during the holiday?” he asked quietly. It was lucky the metal in Tony’s chest couldn’t crack or he was sure it would in that moment.

His own dad aside, what parent didn’t want to spend the holiday with their kid?

“Of course,” Tony said honestly. He gave Harry a crooked grin. “There’s nothing like New York at Christmas, you’ll love it.”

Harry nodded and he looked adorable, if a little pathetic, with his cheeks pink and his eyes a little glassy.

“I’ll definitely come home for Christmas, if you want me…” Harry blinked and looked down at his lap, “…Dad.”

Tony blinked and felt like the floor was tilting beneath him. He couldn’t explain the emotions that slammed in him full force- there was shock and joy and pride and—

Harry scowled and shook his head. “That sounds fucking weird, nevermind.”

“That’s more like it,” Tony laughed and gave the kid a cheeky salute.

Harry could take it back, but Tony still heard it. And damn if he didn’t want to hear it again.

“Glad to have you back, kid,” Tony said cheerfully when he left Harry to dig through his purchases.

 

He only wished that he didn’t have to lose him all over again in only two short weeks. Less than that if he caved and let Sirius have him in London for the last week of summer.

 

“Parenting is hard,” Tony whispered to Pepper when he decided screw it and curled up beneath his blanket on the couch with her.

Pepper hummed and repositioned herself to cuddle up against him with her warm and distracting body.

“Yeah, but you’re doing a good job,” she said sleepily.

Tony grinned and touched his head to hers. “Harry called me dad,” he whispered softly. Pepper made a happy and half-asleep sound. “You should follow in his footsteps, call me Daddy.”

Pepper’s eyes snapped open and she pushed Tony, catching him by surprise and causing him to topple off the couch and on to the floor.

“You’re disgusting,” she said. She stretched out then, taking up the whole couch. “Sleep on the floor, Tony.”

“But you’re so much warmer!” he whined. He climbed back on the couch, laying directly on top of her and wrestling for control of the blanket. “C’mon, Pep, don’t be like this. Who’s going to entertain me while Harry’s at Hogwarts?”

“Probably one of your other children you didn’t know about,” she said. She conceded the blanket to Tony and moved so he could lay beside her. “Man whore.”

“That’s daddy man whore to you, missy,” Tony grinned. He accepted the swat to his head that Pepper dished out. “Night, Pep.”

“Night, Tony.”

 

Tony closed his eyes and tried to not think about how quiet his place would be shortly when Harry was gone and he was alone again.

If it made the kid happy, then surely it was the right decision.

 

Right?

Chapter Text

“I’m going to miss you.”

Harry glanced over at Peter and felt his stomach flip at his genuinely despondent expression. The two of them were sitting on top of the ramp at the skate park Peter liked, doing more talking than skating, and Harry had carefully explained that he would be returning to his boarding school in a couple of days.

Technically he’d be staying with Sirius at his family home in London for a week, then he’d be going back to school.

“I’m, er, going to miss you too,” Harry admitted. He was grateful that the city didn’t seem to pay much for upkeep in the park and that half the lights didn’t work when his face turned red at the honest admission.

Harry missed Ron and Hermione, somehow even more once they began chatting once a day on Sirius’ mirror, but he didn’t fancy leaving Peter and Gwen either.

Particularly not Peter.

“I wish you could go,” Harry sighed. In an ideal world, Peter would be a wizard as well and then he could just go to Hogwarts and Harry could spend a couple months with his friends, come home for the holiday, then go back and finish his OWLS.

“Sign me up,” Peter told him with a nudge of his shoulder and a crooked grin. “I can fake an accent, mate,” he said in what was possibly the worst imitation of Harry’s own accent that Harry had ever heard.

Harry laughed and playfully pushed him. “You can’t,” he said with a shake of his head. “That was terrible, Peter.”

“Not as bad as the weird bearded guy and your hot god-dad,” Peter winked at Harry and Harry scowled.

Ever since Dumbledore and Sirius showed up at Tony’s right in front of Peter and Gwen, Harry had been teased nonstop by Gwen about how ‘hot’ Sirius and Tony both were.

And it was disgusting.

“He’s not hot,” Harry said tersely, rolling his eyes for effect. “I’ll tell him you said so though, his ego will never be the same.”

Peter leaned back on the ramp, placing one hand behind Harry, and scooted just a tad closer to him. He kicked Harry’s foot lightly, and grinned.

“Don’t be jealous, Stark, he’s much too old for me. I prefer my guys to be young, shit skaters, and enrolled in mysterious boarding schools.”

Harry sniffed and stuck his nose in the air in a haughty manner. “I’m not a shit skater.”

Peter grinned and looked cocky. “Oh, Bright Eyes, you are.”

Harry got to his feet and grabbed his skateboard from behind him. “Come on then, show me how it’s done oh brilliant one.”

Peter snagged his phone and set it to play what he embarrassingly had titled ‘Peter & Harry’s Playlist’ and then jumped up to grab his board.

“Watch how it’s done,” he winked. He puckered his lips out. “A kiss for luck?”

Harry rolled his eyes but did it anyway. “I hope you fall, prat.”

“I won’t.”

He didn’t.

Peter skated like Harry liked to think he flew. He stepped on his board and flipped it beneath his feet before smoothly moving down the ramp, riding back up the other side, flipping it again, and skating back up to where Harry stood with am impressed look.

“Beat that, Bright Eyes.”

Harry couldn’t, but he had fun trying.

The two of them faffed around for a few hours longer, delaying the inevitable goodbye. Peter skated, Harry fell, and they both sang along to Peter’s little speaker he brought until the moon was directly above their heads and Harry had laughed more than ever before.

 

By the time Harry made it back to the tower, when his clock said three, there was an ache in his chest.

Harry missed his friends, he missed flying, he missed the place he used to love. He hadn’t planned on ever going back, but he also hadn’t planned on Voldemort being able to track him or Dumbledore showing up to ask him to come back.

How was Harry meant to turn away? He couldn’t protect himself as a muggle, he didn’t think anyone would give him the option to anyway. Tony didn’t need Harry to protect him, Merlin knew the man protected himself just fine, but how could Harry look him in the face after all he’d done for him and act like a coward?

Just because Happy said that not everyone was meant to be a hero didn’t mean that people didn’t expect it anyway.

There was a prophecy over Harry’s head, saying he was meant to defeat Voldemort and keep people safe. There were people who cared about Harry - Tony and Sirius and Ron and Hermione - who would despise him if they knew he was a coward.

Maybe not Sirius, but he was the exception.

How was Harry meant to be a part of Tony’s family of heroes as the lone coward? The one who saw a whole world that depended on him to help them and turned his back?

Tony could say he loved Harry all he wanted, an odd sentiment that Harry ignored rather than processed, but he Harry didn’t deserve that love. He didn’t deserve the nice things Tony had done for him or the way that he given Harry a home and an odd group of people to call family.

But he could go to Hogwarts, learn to be an actual wizard, and then he could earn it when he’d done something right.

Even if leaving felt like maybe it was the wrong decision.

*****

“Not too late to back out.” Tony sat in the seat across from Harry on his private jet. He was dressed casually and had his legs crossed and an easy grin on his face. Since it was the fifth time he’d told Harry that he didn’t have to go back, in the last hour since they left New York, Harry didn’t think he really felt all that casually about it.

“It’ll be brilliant,” Harry said. His voice sounded flat even to his own ears, but it had been a truly terrible goodbye with Pepper and Joey that morning.

Pepper had cried and Joey just barked and wagged his tail. Harry couldn’t stand the thought of Joey waiting for Harry to get home and his tail sinking lower and lower when Harry didn’t return for months.

December 18th had never looked so far away as it currently did.

“If you change your mind, just text me,” Tony said, again. “I’ll come get you right away. Okay?”

Harry nodded and stared out the window. He watched the clouds around them and worked to swallow down the lump in his throat. Tony must have sensed that the rest of the conversation would be one-sided, so he fell silent and stared unhappily out the window as well.

 

The trip that took half a day when Harry made it to New York only lasted a few hours in Tony’s jet. When they landed, Harry’s heart lifted slightly to see Padfoot barking his head off on the strip beside the jet along with Professor Lupin and a pink-haired witch that Harry assumed was Sirius’ cousin Tonks. He’d never met her before, but the way she was chatting to Lupin was a bit of a giveaway.

Harry wondered, again, if Sirius had truly threatened to kill Lupin because he was shagging Tonks, as he said, or if they’d gotten into some sort of spat. Sirius wasn’t usually a jealous bloke, but Harry supposed he didn’t know much about his godfathers love life either.

Thankfully.

“Here.” Tony handed Harry a backpack, a red and gold one that looked like a Gryffindor bag if it weren’t for the Iron Man logo on the front.

“It’s got portable chargers and some other junk food you like in it,” Tony explained at Harry’s questioning look. “You have your laser?”

Harry bit back a grin and patted his pocket for the tiny, but effective, weapon Tony gave him and insisted he took to Hogwarts with him. It was beside his phone and the ‘StarkPods’, which were apparently just earbuds that worked around magic.

“You’ve got your clothes, books, camera?” Tony asked. He got to his feet and stretched with another frown aimed out the window.

“In my trunk,” Harry said quietly. He cleared his throat, “Thank you.”

When Tony returned from shopping with Dumbledore, Harry had later been glad for his slip of the tongue in calling Tony dad. It had been perhaps the most uncomfortable thing Harry had ever done, including when he asked Cho Chang to the Yule Ball and got shot down, but when he looked through the bags he’d been thankful for it.

Tony didn’t just buy Harry spellbooks and standard supplies. He’d apparently gone mad in Diagon Alley and supplied Harry with everyone from new robes to a new trunk and a cage for Hedwig that his owl was currently sleeping in. And, best of all, a small black camera.

It was a bit moot since Harry had his phone, but it has made him cry in the shower all the same.

“Last chance, kid,” Tony said after he drug Harry’s trunk from the back of the cabin to the exit. “I’m lying, actually, it’s never too late to go home.”

Harry looked out the window and saw Padfoot chasing his own tail and barking away. It was almost enough to make him smile if it wasn’t a painful reminder that Joey was probably doing the same thing back home.

It was unfair that cats could go to Hogwarts but dogs couldn’t. Psycho called it canine discrimination and Harry was inclined to agree with her just that once.

“I have to,” Harry said apologetically. He grabbed the handle of his trunk and squared his shoulders determinedly. “I’ll be back soon, if- if you still want me to.”

Tony sighed and sat Hedwig’s cage down on Harry’s trunk.

“Kid, I’ll always want you to come back,” he said. He held his arms out and mustered up a smile that looked pained. “Got a hug for your old man?”

Harry hesitated. He stepped forward very carefully and let Tony put his arms around him in a loose embrace. Harry tried not to tense up and he focused on breathing and ignoring the hands on his back.

“Text me every day or I’m breaking in that school and kidnapping you,” Tony said gruffly when he let Harry go and they both averted their eyes from each other.

“Again,” Harry drawled in an attempt to break the awkward air between them. It worked, a bit, because Tony laughed and picked up Hedwig’s cage once more.

“Yeah, again,” he said. He flicked his sunglasses, the silver mirrored copy of Harry’s own sunglasses, down on his face and gave Harry a smirk. “Let’s get this over with.”

All in all, the handoff could have gone worse.

When Harry and Tony stepped off the jet, Professor Lupin let out a startled laugh.

“Jesus,” he breathed. His eyes flicked between the two of them quickly enough for Harry to feel self-conscious. “How the hell did I miss it?”

“Miss what?” Harry asked, shoving Padfoot away when he jumped up on him. “Quit, Pads, this is my favorite fucking jacket.”

Sirius barked in what was definitely amusement and Tonks and Lupin both laughed.

“The fact that you,” Tonks pointed at Harry, “look just like him,” she pointed at Tony. She stepped forward and eagerly offered Tony a hand, “Nymphadora Tonks, my dad’s going to lose his mind when he finds out I got to meet you.”

“Harry’s dad, and I’ll lose my mind if Harry doesn’t make it to your secret playhouse safely,” Tony said brightly as he shook Tonks’ hand. “Moony, right?” he asked Lupin, shaking his hand as well. “Been a while, you look like hell.”

Harry and Tonks frowned, but Sirius let out another joyful bark.

Lupin’s brows pinched in the middle and he sent an annoyed look at where Sirius danced around as Padfoot.

“Thanks,” he said, releasing Tony’s hand. He gave Harry a more warm smile, just as friendly as he’d been in Harry’s third year. “Are you ready, Harry? Molly’s preparing quite the welcome party for you.”

Harry bit his lip and glanced uncertainly at Tony while Tonks shrunk his trunk and handed Hedwig off to Lupin.

“I guess so,” he answered Lupin, still looking at Tony. “Er… I’ll see you soon, I guess. Don’t forget to feed Joey, okay?”

Tony raised his brows, “Do we have a Joey in our family? I could have sworn the little pest was named Asshole with a British accent.”

Harry rolled his eyes, much less effectively behind the sunglasses that were a necessity in New York and less so in London.

“Just… don’t forget to feed him,” Harry insisted. He shuffled his feet and twisted his lips in a scowl. “Please.”

“I won’t,” Tony said. “And you don’t forget to text me and also stay away from dragons and snakes and Darth Vader, okay?”

“Yeah,” Harry agreed, smirking at Tonks and Lupin’s looks of confusion. “Er… bye then.”

“Bye, kid, love you.”

Harry raised his hand in acknowledgement while Lupin stepped closer and held Harry’s elbow firmly.

“Ready?”

No.

“Yeah.”

 

As soon as Harry apparated away with Remus and Tonks left with Harry’s belongings, Tony stared grimly down at Sirius.

“Don’t let him get hurt,” he said. “I’ll kick anyone’s ass I have to if I get my son back in less than perfect condition.”

Sirius did his best to nod before bounding off to apparate back to Grimmauld Place and spend the week with his godson.

*****

After a loud and insane dinner consisting of every Weasley - and Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, and the real Mad-Eye Moody - demanding Harry tell them about New York and about Tony and about his summer, Harry had been relieved to escape to his and Ron’s room to talk with his friends. Or, he had been, until Ron and Hermione informed him of what Harry had been missing in the wizarding news.

Apparently, just because Sirius kept Harry informed on the war efforts didn’t mean he’d kept Harry fully informed.

“So everyone thinks I’m some liar who just ran off to hide from my lies?!” Harry demanded. He had gotten to his feet around the time Hermione mentioned Rita Skeeter leading some smear campaign against him and paced furiously in the large and stuffy room.

The room that was nothing like Harry’s airy and clean bedroom back at the tower.

“Not everyone is going to believe her,” Hermione said quickly. She twisted her fingers together from where she sat beside Ron on his bed and watched Harry nervously.

“‘Not everyone’,” Harry scoffed. He stopped for a moment to glare at Ron and Hermione, misplaced targets for his anger. “And what’s the story about Cedric, huh?” he demanded, pushing past the pang of grief when he thought of the kind Hufflepuff who’d been struck down for no reason. “Suppose I killed him?”

“Freak accident, they said,” Ron answered hesitantly. “Harry, mate, ignore it. Who cares? Look at the bright side, yeah?”

Harry gave him an unimpressed look. “What bright side?”

“You didn’t have to help clean this shit hole all summer, you’ve got a dad who sounds wicked cool, and if Malfoy gives you any shit when we get back you can just have Tony blast a hole in his snotty little head.”

Harry snorted at Ron’s quick list of good things that had happened. Then, at the image of Tony using his Iron Man weapons against Malfoy, he smirked and dug his little laser from his pocket.

“Oi, you guys wanna see something wicked?”

 

Sirius burst in the room only a minute later with a frantic look on his face. He looked from where Harry was hastily pocketing the weapon to where Ron and Hermione sat, wide-eyed, to the smoking hole in the wall that Fred was curiously poking his head through from the other side.

“Accidental magic?” Sirius asked hopefully.

“Yes,” Harry lied with a bright smile that fooled no one. “Accidental magic, set off by my godfather forgetting to tell me that I’m apparently a chronic liar.”

Sirius shrugged, unashamed, and then leaned against the doorway, occasionally glancing at the wall with a grin pulling at his lips.

“Slipped my mind,” he said easily, a lie as unbelievable as Harry’s. “You wanna come see if that accidental magic can destroy an annoying portrait?”

 

Hermione and Mrs Weasley hadn’t been impressed, but Sirius, the twins, and Ginny all cheered when they discovered that, yes, Harry could destroy the portrait of Sirius’ hateful mum, and the wall behind it, with a quick click of a button.

 

Harry’s week at Grimmauld passed by too quickly. He spent time with his friends and exchanged texts at night with Tony and Peter (Harry had to ask Tony if he could buy another StarkPhone for Hermione when she lost her mind the first time he used his in front of her. Tony said he’d send her one and Harry privately apologized to Ron when Hermione declared Tony as ‘her favorite human on Earth’.).

Harry also watched Sirius and Lupin dance around each other with a look of amusement. Whatever happened, and Sirius refused to elaborate, but Harry had never seen Sirius hold a grudge against anyone like he was Lupin. Harry spent a bit of time with Tonks, when she helped him and the twins set pranks for Sirius’ nasty house-elf Kreacher, and had to admit that she wasn’t all that bad, a bit like Sirius really, so his bemusement at Sirius and Lupin’s spat only grew.

Mostly though, Harry tried to spend as much time with Sirius as he could without seeming too clingy and desperate.

“Comfy there?” Sirius poked Harry in the side and grinned when Harry kicked at him from where he was laying in Sirius’ bed. It had become a habit for them to hide away in Sirius’ room after dinner and talk late in the night, and as Harry was set to return to Hogwarts the next day, he found he couldn’t bear the thought of leaving Sirius any more than he had leaving New York.

Sirius had just finished telling a story about Harry’s dad, James, riding his bike in a pond one summer, and Harry fell silent as his thoughts drug him off in a different direction than the humor Sirius had been aiming for.

“Do you think he’d be unhappy for me to have Tony as something like a parent?” Harry asked without looking at Sirius. It had been weighing on him since he called Tony dad and it bothered him to think that James Potter, who loved Harry so much he had died to protect him, even knowing Harry wasn’t biologically his, would be unhappy with him.

“Who? James?”

“Yeah.”

Sirius scooted closer to Harry and wrapped an arm around his shoulders. And sometimes Harry thought that Sirius was the only one that touch came so easily for. But Sirius got it, didn’t he? Sirius knew that touch wasn’t always kind and didn’t come easily to some people. Harry never had to worry if Sirius was going to strike him for no reason; Sirius of all people knew how that felt.

“Not at all,” Sirius said, his voice confident and sure. He smiled down at Harry when Harry glanced up and saw his grey eyes were soft and genuine. “I imagine that James is somewhere in the afterlife with Lily, both just doing happy dances every time your phone dings with a text from your dad.”

Harry fidgeted. “You really think that?”

Sirius ruffled Harry’s hair with his free hand. “I know it.”

Harry swatted at his hand playfully, scowling as he fixed his hair back down. “I’m not sure how I’m supposed to trust you. You are a mass murderer, Pads.”

Sirius laughed, shaking Harry slightly as he did. “Yeah? This coming from the Boy-Who-Lies?” he teased, quoting Harry’s new daft moniker in the papers.

The two of them argued for a while about who had the worse public reputation until Harry finally conceded that being a murderer and traitor was perhaps worse than being a lying lunatic.

“How bad do you think Hogwarts is going to suck this year?” Harry asked softly when they’d settled down and both comfortably laid against Sirius’ headboard.

“If it sucks at all, then you leave,” Sirius said flippantly. He waved his hand airily, “You’re not allowed to be unhappy, kiddo. Not anymore.”

Harry sighed and closed his eyes, breathing away the headache that grew every time he thought of going back to Hogwarts the next morning. All his excitement he’d once felt gave away to nerves once he’d been informed fully of the public opinion of him.

He was idly glad that Sirius hadn’t bothered to tell him, it would have made returning that much harder and Harry barely got off the jet as it was.

“I think you’re wrong, Siri,” Harry said softly after Sirius extinguished the light and tossed Harry the blanket that was unofficially his. “Everyone’s allowed to be unhappy.”

Harry couldn’t see Sirius in the dark, but he still felt the weight of his stare.

“If it’s too much, just tell me,” he said quietly. “No ledges, Harry. Promise me if it gets that bad that you’ll get ahold of me or Tony or someone and we can do something else. OWLS aren’t worth your life.”

They weren’t. Harry wasn’t all that fussed about OWLS, or his grades in general. There weren’t many things more important than his life, but the people who called him family and loved him - Tony, Sirius, Pepper, Ron, Hermione - were and Harry was determined to be a person who deserved their love.

“I promise,” he lied.

Chapter Text

September 3rd

Tony was still awake when his alarm went off at three, reminding him to text Harry. Sirius said that Hogwarts classes started at eight, so Tony figured if he sent the kid a text at seven, he’d catch him before class when he had time to answer. So far, he was one for one.

What’s first on the agenda today?

The time difference was a bit of a bitch, but it wasn’t as if Tony slept much anymore anyway. Not since Harry left and the tower was too quiet, too empty, without him.

 

His text sent, Tony rolled out of bed and slid his slippers on. He nudged the sleeping puppy on his bed enough to wake it.

“Come on, let’s take you outside,” he said. Even the dog looked sad when it lifted its head and stared at Tony with literal puppy eyes.

“I know.” Tony leaned down and scratched the pathetic thing behind the ears. “I miss him too.”

Joey whined and Tony only barely resisted doing so as well.

 

While Tony sipped a cup of coffee and Joey ran laps in the yard, he got a text back from Harry.

Defense and Potions.

Tony chuckled at the deadpan emoji that Harry sent along with his text and fired off a response too quickly to pretend to be casual.

New teacher for defense this year, right? Bring them an apple, really let that sweet personality of yours shine.

Hilarious. How’s Joey?

Tony sent proof of life in the form of a video of Harry’s dog running around in the yard.

Tell your friend I sent her a phone. I sent it to Sirius anyway, since I don’t have a carrier pigeon of my own.

Ron says he hates you.

No phone for Ron then.

Gotta go. Bye.

The small smile Tony had from the familiar banter with Harry slipped away when Harry put his phone away to get to his classes. Returning to the apartment and roaming around the empty rooms only made his smile more difficult to reach. Even if Harry was the quietest teenager to live, there was a thick silence in their place that Tony hated.

Tony wasn’t sure what he did before his summer began and his son showed up and caught his office furniture on fire, but he figured it was probably as bleak and dull as everything he’d done since Harry left.

 

“Would you quit moping?” Nat slammed her hand on the table, drawing Tony’s attention to her. The team had been in a meeting for what felt like hours. A possible new HYDRA base, Steve wanted to ‘plan for an attack’, blah blah blah.

Tony always had a plan when it came to HYDRA: attack.

And since none of the others seated at the round table, save for Clint, maybe, had agreed with him, Tony quit listening pretty early on.

He hadn’t been ‘moping’ though, not in front of them. Currently, he was bored out of his mind. Tony saved his moping for when he ate a solitary dinner of takeout and bourbon; Pepper joined him a couple times since Harry left, but Tony mostly avoided her in an effort to not get nagged at over his drinking.

Plus, Pepper sat in Harry’s seat and chatted about work and ideas she had for the company and a hundred other things that Tony couldn’t be bothered to give a damn about.

Whoever invented the idea of boarding schools had been either sick in the head or Howard Stark. It was a form of mental torture wondering what Harry was up to, if he was doing okay, if he was sleeping or having headaches. Couple it with Tony’s inability to track Darth Vader (and Tony Stark was not a person that others could hide from usually, so he was beginning to take it personal), and Tony had been moping harder than ever.

Just not in front of Nat though.

Tony raised a mocking brow at Nat’s look of irritation and took a long sip of what was probably his tenth cup of coffee for the day. “Oh, I’m sorry, is my opinion wanted now? Because a few minutes ago you didn’t seem to want it.”

“He’s at school, Tony, not dead,” Nat spat after taking a calming breath that did nothing for her little angry face. She shot a filthy look at Tony’s phone, face up and ready for any message from Harry or Sirius. “You’ve been distracted for days, ever since the kid left.”

“I haven’t been distracted, I’ve been working,” Tony lied. He would be working if he were inspired to work on anything. All his projects were uninteresting and he couldn’t force himself to work on things that didn’t currently interest him. Even the StarkCar, now on the European markets, couldn’t hold his attention. All the small bugs in the system that popped up, Tony pushed off on his technicians.

He wasn’t paying them to not handle the things he didn’t want to do.

And all he’d really wanted to do was… well… mope. Mope, drink, and mentally count down the hours until Harry came home.

“You’re drinking a lot too,” Bruce muttered with a ‘disappointed dad’ aimed look at Tony. “I can smell you from here,” he explained.

Tony knew he should have showered before the meeting.

“Can we get to it?” he asked, waving his hand impatiently and evading all conversation. “Some of us have better things to do.”

“Yeah?” Clint put his elbow on the table and propped his chin on his fist. “What’s her name?”

Tony snorted, “Your mom,” he said childishly.

Steve chuckled and then turned in his chair to face back at the hologram outlining the possible Hydra base once more.

“Head in the game, guys,” he said affably. “Now, look,” Steve clicked a button on the remote, zooming in on the base and lighting up the center of it brightly. “What does that look like to you?”

Tony put down his coffee mug and leaned forward. He stroked his chin thoughtfully. “Something pretty damn powerful,” he mused.

“Something like Loki’s scepter,” Bruce said quietly, saying what they were all thinking.

The damn mind controlling stick hadn’t been seen since HYDRA agents stole it from SHIELD. It was the reason no one on the team, except for Mister Righteous and Miss ‘SHIELD Gave Me Purpose’ did any side jobs for Fury anymore. Tony wasn’t going to work for a guy who once ran the agency that allowed something with the possibility of such devastation to get in their enemies hands. Plus, personally, Tony was itching to get his own hands on the scepter. Especially now that he had been closing the gap between magic and technology.

Bruce glanced at Tony and then they both looked away quickly lest they be caught by the two spies.

Ultron was a fantasy for so long. Something idealogical since the aliens first invaded earth. A magic shield around the planet- protecting it from outside invaders. And a few months ago, Bruce had laughed at the idea. But now? Now that they had seen proof that magic existed and it could work with technology?

If Tony could create an AI with both arc reacting powers, protecting it from the magical world he now knew existed, and guided by the same magic that powered Loki’s scepter, then the Avengers could pick tomatoes for the rest of their lives and the earth would be safe.

That scepter could help create the superior peacekeeper that would keep their vulnerable planet safe until the end of time.

It could keep Tony’s son safe, he would never witness the terrors that outside invaders could bring.

And to do that, Tony needed a closer look at that scepter.

“That’s exactly what we think it is,” Steve confirmed, tilting his head to Nat. “We don’t know what they’re doing with it, but we need to do everything we can to retrieve it. If we can get it, get it back to Thor, then it neutralizes the threat on Earth.”

Tony hummed an agreement and then sat back, studying the layout of the base with calculating eyes. He let the others discuss the best place to store a weapon of such magnitude while his mind began whirling with the ways he could best put it to good use.

Aside from his main goal of finding Darth Vader and blasting a hole in his head, it seemed as if Tony had found a project to hold his interest after all.

*****

Every day for the next week, Tony followed the same routine with a fervent focus.

He got up, sent a text to the kid, took the dog out, sometimes he grabbed a quick breakfast, mostly he skipped it. He always had time for coffee in his lab though, the place where he was beginning to spend most of his waking hours in.

He’d been in there one morning, running diagnostics on a magical clock he’d had Sirius send him, waiting for the results, when Jarvis alerted him to Bruce’s presence in his apartment.

“Tell him I’m in the lab,” Tony muttered, distracted by the results slowly appearing on his screen. “Son of a—”

“Woah, language.” Bruce walked in the lab, the door sliding open automatically when it recognized him, with an easy smile and a crisp white shirt buttoned up nicely. “Hey, Tony, Steve’s looking for you.”

“Come here,” Tony said instead, waving Bruce over to where Tony stood before a wall of screens. Steve could wait, discoveries couldn’t. “Look at this, tell me what it reminds you of.”

Bruce pushed his glasses up then tilted his head at the diagnostic results.

“It looks like the same energy that powers your suit,” he murmured slowly, drawing the same conclusion Tony had. Bruce took a step forward and traced a finger over one of the lines on the screen. “Except way stronger.”

“Exactly.” Tony picked up the clock Sirius sent, the old fashioned one that he warned him shot bullets out of it every hour on the hour. “It’s from this.”

Bruce smiled slightly as he looked at the clock. “Did you really need a StarkClock, Tony?”

“It’s not mine, it’s magic,” Tony said. He carefully place the clock back on the table, the face of turned toward the wall since the time getting too close to the hour for Tony to want to dodge another bullet. “Harry’s magic, my reactor, Loki’s scepter, I think it’s all the same,” he said quickly, eager to share his discovery with an equal who would appreciate it. “If I’m right, then we could have Program Ultron done and ready to go before we even touch that base. All we’d need—”

“Is the scepter that Thor’s on his way to help us get and take back with him,” Bruce cut in. He shook his head and rubbed his eyes beneath his wire-rimmed glasses. “Even if you’re right—”

Which Tony knew he was.

“—then that matrix is going to be back in Asgard not even an hour after we get it. Thor isn’t going to just let you play with it.”

“Then we don’t tell him,” Tony said with a shrug. “He’s not here, and friends do sometimes keep secrets. I think Cap and Nat have been going at it for a while. He seems awfully dodgy lately, doesn’t he?”

Bruce laughed and walked over toward the covered window. He pulled up the blinds just enough for Tony to blink disconcertingly at the storm outside.

“Steve isn’t with Natasha, and Thor’s on his way,” Bruce said. The thunder and lightning that struck the sky only emphasized his words. “I’m sorry, Tony, but I think this one is going to need a different matrix to run it. Why don’t you see if Sirius or Harry…?”

“No.” Tony waved him off curtly and then threw himself in his desk chair so he could study the results on the screen and think. Harry couldn’t do magic outside of school and Sirius’ magic wasn’t like the scepter- it didn’t burn endlessly. If Sirius were gravely injured, or God forbid the man died, then Tony imagined the magic that came from within him would go as well. The scepter was a power source of its own thought, and if Tony could copy its code, study its core, he could have a shield that never lost its power. “If we could just distract Thor long enough for Jarvis to run a scan…”

The entire tower shook with the force of the next strike of thunder out in the sky.

“I think you’re out of time,” Bruce said drily. He glanced out the window again, at the peaceful sky, and furrowed his brows together. “Thor’s home.”

Tony snorted and massaged his forehead with his thumbs. He’d thought they’d have at least a few days after the mission before Thor’s watchdog alerted him that they had the scepter.

“Thank you, Captain Obvious.” Tony sighed and glanced down at his phone, picking it up as a way to stall. “You go on, I’ll meet you guys for lunch or something.”

“It’s six o’clock, Tony.”

Tony looked at the clock on his screen in surprise. “Huh. Alright, well then you go order takeout and I’ll meet you guys for dinner then.”

Bruce scoffed and mumbled something no doubt insulting as he left the lab, but Tony distracted himself with checking up on Harry. As uninformative as the kid was in his texts to Tony, he talked a little more when he communicated with others.

There was a recent thread between Harry and Sirius where Harry described his new defense teacher as ‘nearly as nice as Sirius’ mum’. Sirius suggested that Harry ‘blast a hole through her head as well’ and Tony wondered what he’d missed during the week Harry stayed at Sirius’ home.

Nice lady, your mom? Alive? Not murdered by my kid?

His text to Sirius sent, Tony scrolled through a mess of awkward teenage texts between Harry and Peter. Harry told him that studying with his friends ‘wasn’t as much fun as studying with Peter had been’. Tony grinned to himself and wondered if Peter really could be the key to convincing Harry to stay home after Christmas break. Peter told Harry about Gwen’s internship at Oscorp that made Tony frown.

Tony sent a quick email to Miss Gwen Stacy’s school account, requesting an interview for an internship position at Stark Industries in his media department. The girl was bright, Tony would rather have her intern with his company than the genetic based research facility ran by Norman Osborn.

He would have to first actually make an intern position for Harry’s friend, but Tony usually had a good read on people and he thought it might be worth the hassle later.

The truly interesting messages were between Harry and his friend Hermione. And by interesting, Tony meant that they made him want to pull out his hair at their content.

Ignore him Hermione. He’s being a bastard.

Do NOT text me during class! Pay attention!

All I’ve learned today is that I’m an arrogant idiot with an inflated sense of self-worth that I undoubtedly got from my father.

As true as the accusation was against Tony, it was an odd insult to use against Harry who seemed to have inherited none of Tony’s vanity. Or, more accurately, had it beat out of his head that he was worth anything at all.

Tony sighed as he scrolled through a few more messages between the two teens. Hermione complained about a rule someone was trying to enact, banning ‘muggle tech’. Harry responded with a smiling face and a gun, stating that technically the phones weren’t muggle technology or they would have blown up before then. About the time that Tony read Hermione’s texts reminding Harry to ‘eat his lunch, do not simply glare at it’, he sighed and shut his screen off.

He couldn’t get a general mood from Harry’s messages; he couldn’t figure out if another offer to fly in and drag him home would be well received or not. When Tony had been Harry’s age, he would have dug his heels in harder if his mom had insisted he leave MIT and study somewhere else. Harry and Tony had some pieces of their personality similar, but just the crappy stuff that made it hard to get to know the kid on a deeper level.

Although, Harry was a big fan of sarcasm…

I hope your fancy magic school sucks. I hear Midtown has cute nerds with skateboards and sloppy hair.

Despite it being ten Harry’s time, Harry text back before Tony could even make it from his desk chair to his office door. He only sent a middle finger emoji, but it was enough to bring a small grin to Tony’s lips.

Why are you still up? Don’t you have bedtime there? No bedtime here, just saying.

Just finished detention.

Tony laughed and leaned against the wall, shaking his head.

You’ve been there less than two weeks. How do you already have detention?

I apparently don’t know when to shut up. Maybe it’s genetic. Further testing may be required.

Tony had a true smile at that. Sure, detention sucked, but Harry wasn’t wrong, necessarily, either. Harry was a mouthy thing, all prickly and ready to snap at any true or conceived slight. It was something Tony never got tired of, but he imagined a teacher might not really appreciate.

It’s a Stark trait. When you’re out of school it won’t matter anymore because people will be too scared of you to tell you to shut up.

Brilliant. Can’t wait. Goodnight.

Night, kid, love you.

Tony pocketed his phone and whistled a jaunty tune on his way to Thor’s floor, where he assumed the others gathered. He didn’t like to count his pixels before they were placed, but with a mission coming up, a project to work on, and Harry not seeming thrilled with his school, Tony thought maybe things were looking up for him.

Chapter Text

September 10

Hey, kid, I’m off to Slovakia to shoot bad guys. If you need anything, call or text me and I’ll answer. Pepper has Mister Arsehole. Love you, stay safe.

Harry frowned at the screen.

By yourself?

Harry absently picked at the roll he’d nicked from the kitchens to bring to the Astronomy Tower with him while he waited for Tony to text back. He looked up and felt wistful at the setting sun and the way the orange and purple mixed in the sky. It was probably stupid, but…

Harry clicked a photo of the sky above the lake, nothing identifiable about it, and sent it to Peter with a little, ‘wish you were here’.

Or, more accurately, Harry wished he were back in New York. As much as he loved Hermione and Ron, as much as Hogwarts used to be home, it just… it just wasn’t anymore.

Home felt a lot like Harry’s poorly painted bedroom with Joey in his bed and Jarvis updating him on where everyone was in the tower. It felt like Saturday evenings spend skateboarding or playing video games with Peter and Sunday nights having dinner with Tony and his friends.

Home was where his damn hand didn’t ache, his chest wasn’t constantly tight, and people weren’t whispering about him behind his back.

Hogwarts just wasn’t home anymore.

If Harry were honest with himself, it hadn’t been since the night he’d been chosen as champion and the magic he’d felt within the castle turned to malevolence. Once he began to look at everything in a ‘could this save my life or end it’ sort of way, it couldn’t go back to being the whimsical magical castle it had been when Harry was eleven.

Harry was ripped from his quickly devolving thoughts when his phone lit up with a new text. Not from Peter, but Tony.

I’m with the Scooby-Doo gang, of course.

You know I don’t actually know what that means, right?

We have to fix that. Steve, Bruce, Nat, Thor, and Clint.

Harry frowned and tossed his half-eaten roll across the lawns.

I thought you weren’t working for Fury?

I’m not. Forget that guy. I’m working with my friends to destroy a hydra base. Part revenge, part getting Thor’s toy back since hydra stole it. Oh, Thor says hi. Want us to stop by your school on the way back? You can meet your favorite uncle?

Harry laughed lightly and kicked his legs against the rail.

Going to try and drive the dick-mobile to Hogwarts?

Don’t be ridiculous. It’s the Dick-Jet and I can land this baby anywhere.

Harry grinned when he imagined Tony just somehow managing to rip through the wards and landing a jet in the middle of the grounds like Madame Maxine did with her carriage last year.

It’s fine. I’ll meet the hammer guy this summer. Try to not kill any innocent aliens this time.

You’ll meet Hammer-Man over Christmas Break when you come home. And just for that, I’m going to kill three times as many aliens.

Going home for holidays? It was… it was something Harry had never done before and something that lit a small fire in his chest every time it was mentioned. Harry never had a home before, and he certainly never had someone who wanted him to be with them for the holiday, Sirius aside.

Harry’s smile slipped off his face at the reminder of the documentary Tony showed him though. Tony… Tony was a real Gryffindor. Tony was brave, selfless, and more than a bit impulsive, in Harry’s opinion. And Harry wouldn’t have a home or a family to want him there if Tony got himself killed.

Maybe no flying in to wormholes this time. Send psycho instead.

Kid, did you just say you hope I don’t die? That’s practically an ‘I love you so much, dad’.

Harry rolled his eyes. Trust Tony to ruin a perfectly normal message.

I hope Bruce smashes you. I have detention again. Goodbye.

He won’t. Have fun in detention, be safe, I’ll text you when we’re done.

Harry stayed up on the rail of the tower, kicking his legs over the ledge, lingering, and tried to count down how many more days until Christmas holidays. Actually…

Harry held his phone up by his mouth, “Hey, Jarvis?”

“Yes, Harry?”

Harry smiled for the sound of the one friend from New York he’d been able to take with him. He assumed all StarkPhones had JARVIS installed, except Hermione’s new phone, the one she practically shattered the windows when she screamed to receive it, didn’t.

“How many days until the 18th of December?”

“There are 99 days until then, Harry.”

That… that was too many days.

“Thanks, mate,” Harry sighed.

99 days felt like an eternity, all the more so when Peter text Harry back a photo of himself and Gwen grinning outside of a brick building that looked like his school.

Sunset doesn’t look as good as you do. I wish you were here.

 

Yeah… Harry pocketed his phone and slid off the rail so he could get to detention, he really did too.

 

“Oh, Harry.” Hermione sighed when Harry slunk in the deserted common room a few hours later after finishing his third detention with Umbridge. “You look… well, really unhappy honestly.”

She pat the couch cushion beside her, the open one between her and Ron, and Harry went over to it and slumped down. “Was she awful again?” she asked when Harry sat.

“Same shit,” Harry said. He nodded gratefully when Ron handed him a bowl of murtlap essence for his hand. It stung putting the fresh cut in the bowl, but then his muscles relaxed when the relief began. “Thanks, guys, really, you didn’t need to wait up for me.”

“I didn’t, I just got back from practice,” Ron joked. He was windswept and pink cheeked though, so Harry figured he truly had been out flying on the pitch. Harry would have loved to join him, help his best mate earn Oliver’s old spot on the quidditch team, but unfortunately he never knew when to shut his mouth.

“Still,” Harry said, looking between the two of them gratefully, “thanks.”

Hermione moved her head to Harry’s shoulder, careful not to dislodge the bowl on his lap and Ron scoffed and put an arm across the back of the crimson sofa behind him.

“You’re miserable,” Hermione said softly, a statement, not a question.

“Well my hand has seen better days,” Harry quipped, hiding the truth in her words behind a sarcastic front. He was miserable, his hand just had nothing to do with it.

Harry hated it there. He wasn’t sure if he hated it more because he knew there were better places he could have been or if it truly was the worst time he’d ever had in the castle, but every fiber of his being urged him to text Tony a simple ‘I’m ready to go’.

Tony would let him leave, no questions asked. Harry could be back home, enrolled at school with two of his other friends by the end of the week. He could video chat Hermione and Ron on Hermione’s phone and visit over breaks.

He could be done with the wizarding world that didn’t give a damn about him.

But Tony wouldn’t do that.

And Harry wasn’t going to let a little thing like his own happiness stand in the way of earning the casual ‘love you kid’ that Tony sent him every day.

“Nah, it’s more than that,” Ron said, surprising Harry that he’d every noticed Harry’s forlorn mood. It wasn’t that Ron wasn’t observant, it was just that…

No, it was that Ron wasn’t usually very observant.

“You miss your dad?” Hermione guessed tentatively when Harry didn’t say anything. Her voice shook a little on the word ‘dad’, as if she were nervous to mention it, but Harry had long since grown indifferent to people referring to Tony like that.

“No,” Harry lied. He leaned back, resting his head against Ron’s arm, and closed his eyes. “It’s just… well, it’s… it’s not like I ever missed the Dursleys,” he said, scrunching his eyes and curling his lip. “And it’s not like anyone besides the two of you even want me here,” he added, thinking of Seamus up in his dorm and Lavender in the girls’ dorm. All the students who thought he was lying about Voldemort and ran away to get attention. “All summer nobody called me a liar or a freak or a- a…”

“An attention seeking, self-important, brain dead, prat?” Ron offered brightly.

Harry snorted and opened his eyes long enough to give Ron a humorless grin. “Yeah.”

“Don’t get mad, okay? But…” Hermione chewed her lip as she peeked up at Harry through her lashes. “Why did you come back? Don’t misunderstand,” she added quickly, “I’m glad you did, of course, but you’re so miserable, Harry. We can all see it.” Ron nodded in agreement, causing Harry to snort.

“Why not leave?” Hermione prodded. “You said you almost went to school with the boy you definitely aren’t secretly dating.”

Harry twisted his face in a scowl in a fruitless effort to hide a blush. He knew he shouldn’t have talked so much about Peter or shared photos of him with Hermione. Hermione was much too clever for her own good. He glanced quickly at Ron, but Ron just looked mildly amused as he tilted his head back on the sofa with his eyes closed and a tiny grin on his lips.

“I can’t leave,” Harry hissed at Hermione, entirely ignoring her comments about Peter. “I told you about… about that thing those people are guarding.”

“Hmm.” Hermione hummed skeptically. “And you believe it then? You believe that you, all by yourself, have to defeat Voldemort—” the muscle in Ron’s arm twitched beneath Harry’s head, “—and nobody can help you?”

Harry gave Hermione an exasperated look. “Either must die at the hand of the other, for neither can live while the other survives,” he quoted quietly. The common room was empty, but Harry never knew when there was an extendable ear in use. “That sounds like it’s got to be me, doesn’t it?”

Hermione harrumphed and crossed her arms while she sat up. “Well I think it’s a load of tosh from an old fraud and you should just let your dad and his friends handle it. And,” Hermione shot a furious look at Harry’s hand, “I think you should tell someone about what that foul woman is doing to you.”

“Oh yeah, that’ll look really fucking mature,” Harry drawled irritably. “‘Excuse me, Tony? I know you’re busy saving the world, being a hero, but my hand hurts.’”

Harry wasn’t going to go whining about a cut on his hand to Tony. Not when the whole point of Harry going back to Hogwarts was to prove he was just as brave as Tony, James, and Lily. If Harry wanted to be like his parents, then he had to suck it up. The soreness afterward was annoying, and Merlin knew Harry didn’t relish having a scar that called him a liar for the rest of his life, but it was almost as peaceful as it was painful when Harry wrote his lines—

The sharpness of the cut cleared his thoughts and all he had to do was write. It was as if Harry could release all the misery he had inside of him on the back of his hand.

He doubted if it was meant to be a favor, and he hated Umbridge for watching with a sadistic smile as he tore his skin open, but he’d left every detention feeling sore physically and better emotionally.

Probably more proof he was crazy, but it wasn’t likely that he’d go telling the Daily Prophet that.

Ron snorted softly at Harry’s mocking comment, but Hermione only dug her heels in further.

“That’s what parents do,” she insisted. “They watch out for you! If I were in your shoes, I’d call my parents right away!”

“Sorry, orphan who was surprise adopted here, I’m new to this parent thing.” Harry blinked at Hermione innocently. “Maybe explain it in smaller words?”

Hermione, quite maturely, stuck her tongue out Harry. Harry, just as maturely, stuck his tongue back out at her.

“You’re being—”

Harry ignored whatever insult Hermione was muttering about him when his phone vibrated softly in his pocket. Ron shuffled over enough so Harry could grab it and they all three grinned at the picture of Padfoot with his tongue wagging that Harry set as Sirius’ contact photo.

“Don’t speak yet,” Harry called to Sirius, hiding his phone screen as soon as he answered. He didn’t see anyone else in the common room, but his bed would be a safer place to chat. “Let me get somewhere more private.”

“Come on,” Hermione smiled at Harry and helped him stand without touching his left hand. “I’ll walk you both upstairs.”

Harry and Ron shared a bewildered look behind Hermione’s back as she began leading them to their dorm.

Since when did Hermione walk them to bed?

Ron went straight to his bed after a hasty goodnight when they got to the dorm. Hermione crinkled her nose up when he climbed in his bed with his dirty trousers on and pulled his curtains shut.

“Gross,” she muttered. Harry only smiled while he cast a silencing charm around his bed; Ron usually slept in his pants, Harry was certain he just didn’t want Hermione to see him undressed.

Hermione jumped in Harry’s bed, ignoring his peculiar look, and scooted closer when Harry closed his curtains and picked the phone up.

“Sorry,” Harry told Sirius. “I was in the common room.”

Sirius was playing with a little golden snitch - Harry’s, if Harry wasn’t wrong. When Sirius decided to rob Harry, he wasn’t sure, but he swore to never leave his belongings with the man again.

“No worries.” Sirius snatched the snitch from the air then grinned at the camera. “I was just bored. Thought I’d call and see what my favorite godson was up to.”

“I’m your only godson,” Harry smirked.

“Also my least favorite then.”

Harry laughed, as did Hermione, but Sirius brought his face closer to the phone and frowned while he squinted at his screen.

“You look like shit, kiddo,” he said bluntly. “What’s wrong?”

Sirius wasn’t wrong, even if he was rude. Harry knew he looked rough after a few nights spent tossing and turning; there were bags under his eyes, a waxy complexion to his skin, and his bottom lip was probably swollen from where he’d bitten it during detention to keep from snapping at Umbridge.

“I’m fine,” Harry said. He ignored the pinch to his side that Hermione delivered. He didn’t care what she thought, the last person he wanted to tell about his—

“Harry’s hand is quite sore.”

…hand was Sirius.

Harry slowly drug his eyes from the phone to Hermione and gave her a look so furious and betrayed that he was surprised he didn’t blow her up like he once had his Aunt Marge. Hermione met Harry’s glare head on and merely smirked at him.

“I’m off to bed then, goodnight,” she said brightly.

Harry had thought he felt betrayal from Hermione when she turned his Firebolt in to McGonagall, but that was nothing compared to the simmering anger he felt as she flounced out of the dorm. Sirius wasn’t going to ‘drop it’, and Hermione bloody knew that.

“Harry…” Sirius’ voice was slow and his eyes were gleaming when Harry turned back to the phone screen. For the first time since before his detention, Harry’s thoughts felt muddled and his tongue was thick.

“What’s wrong with your hand?”

Harry clamped his jaw shut as he moved his phone from his right hand to his left so he could hold his right up.

“Nothing,” he said, forcing himself to sound as if it weren’t shooting pains down his wrist to hold the phone in his injured hand. “Oh, er, I thought I bruised it earlier, flying, but it’s fine now.”

Sirius scoffed disbelievingly and his eyes narrowed more when Harry carefully moved to phone back to his good hand.

“You haven’t had time to fly because you’ve been in detention every damn night,” he said. Harry cursed himself for being too open with Sirius. He never should have told him about the detentions or Hermione about the quill. “Let’s see that other hand, Harry. What’d you do? Cut yourself?”

“No,” Harry scowled as an answer to both questions. He hadn’t really cut himself, not in the way Sirius was implying. “It’s nothing, drop it.”

“Tell me.”

“Piss off.”

“I’ll call Tony.”

“Do it.”

“I’ll call Pepper.”

“You don’t have her number,” Harry said smugly.

Sirius smirked right in the camera, “Tony does.”

And Tony would give it to his new best mate if Sirius asked. Then Sirius would have Pepper call Harry and she’d be sweet and concerned and sneaky and subtle and Harry would end up spilling his guts.

Then she’d tell Tony.

Then Tony would make Harry leave.

And then Harry’s personal to-do list - learn magic, vanquish Voldemort, be brave, don’t lose your family - would be ruined.

Harry’s stomach clenched as he imagined Tony’s disappointment and Pepper’s sad face if they discovered who Harry truly was inside. Not a genius like Tony, not brave like Tony, but a coward who tried to run from his problems and whose magical knowledge was ‘average’ at best.

“Umbridge has me doing lines in detention and the quill cuts my hand then writes in my blood,” Harry told Sirius in a rush. “Hermione was nagging me to tell someone, and I’m sure she’s smug that she’s forced me to do it now.”

And, strangely, just as it did with the other things he’d told Sirius, a small weight lifted from Harry’s chest while he sucked in a breath. He didn’t think all the tosh Pepper said about how therapy was brilliant because a person could share their burdens and get advice for how to handle them, but… but it sort of worked when it was Sirius.

Sometimes.

Sirius’ face turned as dark then as it had when Harry told him about his cupboard. His (truthfully) handsome features twisted up in the same snarl that decorated all his wanted posters.

“Harry, let me see your hand,” he said slowly, his tone a forced calm over a hurricane of anger. Harry held up his wrapped hand and looked away from the phone when Sirius asked him to remove the bandage.

“It’ll hurt,” Harry snapped. He glared at the embers burning in the fireplace hatefully. “It’s not all that exciting anyway. Sure, one day perhaps I’ll have to explain why my hand says ‘I must not tell lies’, but it’ll be an interesting scar, right? Thank God, huh? Because I was ALL OUT OF THOSE!”

Sirius let Harry scream at him then smirked. “You did put up a silencing charm, right?”

“Nope. I’m a fucking idiot who accepts calls from escaped convicts at midnight without one.”

“Maybe you should have put one up,” Sirius said airily, purposefully ignoring Harry’s sarcasm. “You got your map?”

It took Harry a second to sooth his own irrational anger so he could recognize what an abrupt question that was.

“In my trunk…?”

“Good. Get it out and watch the corridors for Snape for me. I’m on my way.”

Harry’s fierce and immediate protests went unheard as Sirius disconnected the call.

Damn it all.

He knew he should have kept his mouth shut.

Harry scrambled out of his bed, conscious of not waking the other boys, and dug in his overly full trunk for his map. He also kept pressing Sirius’ number over and over, trying to call him and getting ignored each time. Harry found and activated the map and sent a quick look toward where Ron was snoring behind his curtains.

No… this wasn’t Ron’s fault.

Hermione, however…

 

“You cannot honestly blame me,” Hermione hissed ten minutes later. Harry had been nervous to go wake her, as he’d never actually been in the girls dorm before, but thankfully Hermione’s bed was right beside the door and Harry had gotten her out of bed and down to the common room without waking anyone else up.

Hermione giggled peculiarly when she saw Harry using the stairs, but Harry chalked it up to exhaustion.

The two of them sat in the common room, Hermione wrapped up in a fuzzy robe and Harry with a blanket wrapped firmly around himself, and stared at the map. Harry’s stomach clenched and coiled to the point he thought he might be sick every time he imagined Sirius’ dot appearing.

“You’re the one who told Sirius,” Harry whispered hotly. He knew it wasn’t fair to blame Sirius’ idiocy on Hermione, but she was the one who planted the idea in Harry’s head and pushed him into talking about it. Harry never should have opened his big mouth.

It was almost as if he was incapable of shutting up.

Sirius probably would have killed the Dursleys had they been home during the summer, why did Harry think he wouldn’t try and do the same thing to Umbridge?

For an innocent man, Sirius truly was constantly chomping at the bit, always ready to commit murder.

“I thought he would tell your dad,” Hermione snapped. “Not come kill Umbridge like a maniac!”

“Oi.” Harry gave her as severe of a look as someone wrapped up in a rainbow colored quilt could give. “Sirius is not a maniac, Hermione. He’s just… a bit impulsive.”

“You didn’t see him this summer,” Hermione sniffed. She looked disdainfully at the map as if it were Sirius himself. “He was terrifying, Harry.”

“He’s also dramatic,” Harry said, only a little fondly. “He would have made a great Aragorn.”

Hermione’s face whipped up to Harry’s so quickly it would have been comical if Harry didn’t feel sick while he imagined Sirius being captured and tossed back in Azkaban. Sirius being kissed by the dementors, as soulless as Barty Crouch Jr.

Sirius never laughing again or talking Harry into leaving the Astronomy Tower and going to bed.

Sirius never sending him Dreamless Sleep or stupid emojis.

Sirius never ruffling Harry’s hair or getting to enjoy freedom.

“Did you read— oh, Harry,” Hermione’s voice softened and her excitement over Lord of the Rings disappeared when Harry had to screw his face up to keep from actually crying. Harry didn’t want to imagine a world where Sirius lost his soul before he even got to imagine freedom. He never had a childhood, his adolescence was stolen by war, and his adulthood stolen by an unfair legal system.

Sirius never even got to live his life- Harry couldn’t let him lose it before it could begin.

“Which passage do you think Sirius will use?” Hermione asked kindly, politely ignoring the way Harry swiped beneath his eyes.

Harry shrugged and then considered it. “That one,” he said, his voice embarrassingly shaky. He pointed at the tunnel that connected the Shrieking Shack to the Whomping Willow. It was a guess, but it would be the easiest one for Sirius to get to and the one he was most familiar with.

“Okay.” Hermione wrapped an arm around Harry’s torso and hugged him briefly. “I’ll go get Ron and then we’ll go stop your homicidal godfather from killing our professor. Is your cloak in your trunk?”

Harry steeled himself to admit the worst part of the whole situation.

“No. Sirius has it.”

Hermione closed her eyes for a moment before she released a heavy breath. “Of course he does.”

 

Of course he did.

 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione traveled through the castle as quietly as they could. Ron had been annoyed to be drug from bed for all of two minutes before Harry explained what happened in the brief time he’d been in bed and then Ron got them each a knitted jumper and hat and agreed to come help.

It was ridiculous, and Harry blamed his headache and exhaustion, but it had made him swallow back a sob when Ron pulled his hat on Harry’s head and easily said they’d all go together.

“Like always,” he had said cheerfully.

If anyone had better friends than Harry did, he didn’t know them.

They moved in a tight cluster; Hermione tried to cast a disillusionment charm on them but all she’d managed to do was make Ron’s hair a bit lighter. Harry had never had to be out much past curfew without the aid of his cloak and he didn’t enjoy being visible at all. Every footstep, no matter how light, could get them all drug to an office and leave Sirius loose with nobody to stop him.

They had the map though, and Harry blindly followed behind Hermione while watching it to make sure they didn’t cross paths with Peeves or Filch.

Luck was on their side when they made it outside without getting caught. They went over to the Whomping Willow, getting as close as they dared, and then huddled together and watched the map.

“He’s mad,” Ron whispered. He stood behind Harry and peered over his shoulder while Hermione nestled in Harry’s side and offered him her warmth and her calm. “I mean, we all know Sirius would kill anyone who hurt Harry, but he’s going to start with the Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic?”

“He tried to start with my uncle,” Harry murmured absently. His attention was fixated on the map so hard that he hardly blinked.

“Good.” Harry did blink then as he looked over at Hermione’s snarl. She crinkled her nose irritably at Harry’s curious expression. “Oh don’t look so surprised, those people are foul.”

“We were going to kill them ourselves,” Ron added conversationally. “Fred and George were going to help if we didn’t find you before school started. They’ve got loads of failed products that they swear were toxic. I figured—”

“There!” Hermione yelped, her voice traveling through the silent grounds. She jabbed her finger at the map; not at the passage Harry thought, but at the one that came out on the third floor.

“Fuck. Run!” Harry turned on his heel and began sprinting for the castle.

“Language!” Hermione wailed from behind Harry, reminding him idly of Steve. Harry didn’t have time to tease her for it though, Sirius was moving quickly and Harry had to get to him before he did something irreparably stupid.

Harry ran as quickly as he could. He put all his energy on it and ignored the reminder of the last time he’d ran so frantically—

“Take my body back.”

—and focused on saving Sirius from himself.

The loud and echoing footsteps in the castle didn’t matter. The way Harry tripped over the stairs didn’t matter. The nosy portraits asking noisy questions didn’t matter.

Harry didn’t stop running until he made it to the third floor, and he only did it then to check the map.

“Where is he?” Ron asked as he skidded to a halt beside Harry and rubbed a stitch in his side.

Harry saw Sirius’ dot moving ahead of him- silent and invisible in the same corridor. Sirius was a man on a mission and Harry doubted it anything he said would help.

Hermione had went in a different direction than them, but Harry couldn’t think of that because he had to save his stupid godfather from himself.

“This way.” Harry grabbed Ron’s wrist and jerked him toward the passageway that Sirius’ dot moved in. Sirius was quick, his dot dancing out of reach without even a whisper of his presence.

If anyone could pull off a murder and get away with it, it would be Sirius Black. But Harry would prefer he not try.

Sirius’ dot exited the passage, tearing quickly through the tapestry that would bring him to the defense corridor, and then—

“Stupefy.”

Sirius’ dot got close enough to Hermione.

Hermione looked smug when the boys caught up to her.

“You have no idea how long I’ve wanted to do that,” she said happily.

Chapter Text

“Reneverate.”

Sirius groaned when he was abruptly drug from unconscious to conscious. He brought a hand to his pounding head and opened bleary eyes. He…

Where was he?

Sirius tried to remember the last thing he’d been doing before he woke up in a damp and dirty tunnel…

Oh!

He’d been planning on killing Dolores Umbridge. Harry had called him and said his teacher was torturing him for detention. Sirius went to Hogwarts, made it in the castle, and had been evading his too-forgiving-godson when someone stunned him…

Hermione.

That girl was a pain in Sirius’ arse. Worse than Moony was, really. All rule following until it suited her then she was as ruthless as anyone.

Sirius growled softly and a snort had him twisting his head around to peer in the semi darkness.

“Morning.” Harry was sitting on the floor with his back to the wall. He lit his wand with a quiet lumos and Sirius had to blink through the sudden light to see that Harry’s face was pale and he looked terrible. His eyes were swollen, like he’d been crying, and there were bags under his eyes heavy enough to cause the slump in his shoulders.

“Morning,” Sirius said lightly. He used the light to discern where they were. “Drug me back in the passage by yourself?”

“Nope.” Harry had Sirius’ map open on his crossed legs and he nodded down to where two dots - Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley - were crossing in the Gryffindor Tower. “Hermione and Ron helped.”

Sirius scooted over to sit against the wall beside Harry, rubbing his head ruefully as he did.

“You know, I can’t say I’m too fond of Hermione,” Sirius said conversationally. “Is she always getting involved in things that aren’t her business?”

“No,” Harry said with staunch loyalty. “And I can’t say I’m real fond of you right now, Siri. Do you ever think before you do mad things or did the dementors destroy your brain?”

Sirius scoffed. He loved Harry, but Harry (thankfully) had no idea how close to the truth he jabbed. Sirius had been willing to die or kill for the people he loved before Azkaban, spending twelve years being tormented by the memories of all the times he didn’t protect his loved ones only left him more determined to never let them down again.

Once he realized that the only person left he truly loved was Harry, well, it wasn’t mad to want to get rid of the witch torturing him for fun.

“Never and probably,” Sirius said, forcing some cheer to his voice. He dropped his hands limply to his lap. “You expected me to do nothing about you being attacked by your teacher?”

“Precisely,” Harry emphasized. He pulled his left hand in his jumper sleeve when Sirius’ eyes dropped down to it. Harry could hide it, but Sirius wouldn’t forget the bloody rag that Harry had shown him earlier. “I thought maybe you liked having a soul, but I was clearly wrong.”

“I don’t need a soul as much as you need to be safe,” Sirius scowled. What was his soul if his godson wasn’t safe? Sirius would trade the air in his lungs for Harry, a soul was nothing. “It’s illegal what she’s doing.”

“I, for one, am truly shocked to have a defense teacher commit a crime against me,” Harry drawled sarcastically.

“Remus didn’t.”

“Remus forgot to take his potion and tried to eat me.”

Sirius grinned, “Touché.”

They were silent for a few minutes while Harry struggled to roll the map up with one hand. Sirius breathed slowly, inhaling the cool air and clearing his mind. Harry kept sending him little sideways glances until Sirius cleared his throat and quirked a brow at him.

“Yes?”

Harry scowled at Sirius, pinching his exhausted face up and looking more weary than any teenage boy had reason to look.

“Don’t play stupid, it only suits you occasionally,” Harry said rudely. Playing stupid was one of Sirius’ best talents, truly he’d missed his calling in the field of acting. It was no wonder Regulus had always been a little drama queen when they were younger, it was quite fun. “Will you go home? Please?”

Sirius hummed as he considered it. “Who all have you told about that bitch?”

Harry apparently couldn’t even muster up a grin at the incredibly creative insult. “You, Hermione, Ron, McGonagall,” he said.

Sirius momentarily ignored the twitch of Harry’s limbs when he growled low and deep.

“You told Minerva and she did nothing?!” Sirius snarled. What the hell was wrong with her?! Minerva had once struck Argus across the face when he’d grabbed a student by the hair to pull her through a corridor; what happened to that mad witch they’d celebrated in the Gryffindor Tower?

Harry ducked his head and mumbled out a brief conversation he’d had with Minerva while he ruffled his own hair anxiously.

Sirius sighed when it came clear that Harry had not actually told Minerva.

“You told her you were doing lines,” Sirius said with a bite of accusation in his tone.

Harry snapped back defensively, “I am.”

“In your fucking blood!” Sirius snarled. He tried to push away the anger that didn’t need to use Harry as a convenient outlet. “How bad’s the hand?” he asked once he felt slightly less murderous.

Harry’s sleeve rustled as he pulled his hand further in his jumper sleeve. “Not bad, really. Hermione’s a bit soft, you know how she dramatizes things,” Harry shrugged.

Sirius wished Harry were more soft. He wished Harry had grown up with two parents who babied him and made him soft.

“Let me see,” Sirius said.

Harry clamped his lips shut and shook his head no.

“Show me your hand or I’m going to Umbridge and rip the memory from her mind before I choke the life from her body.”

Harry kept his face closed off and said nothing, so Sirius smiled widely and jumped to his feet, ducking his head slightly to avoid grazing it across the top of the tunnel.

“Go kill her,” Harry called at Sirius’ back. “It’s fine, I adore when you choose revenge over me. An old hat, isn’t it? At least this time I won’t end up back at the Dursleys.”

Sirius winced at Harry’s targeted reminder of his worst mistake in life, a guilt tactic, really, but he didn’t back down. He wasn’t going to let Harry down again.

“Fine.” Sirius smiled blandly over his shoulder. “See you later. Wish me luck.”

Sirius had grasped the rungs of the ladder to go back up inside Hogwarts when Harry called out his name.

“Sirius! Wait! Damn you, you dick.”

Sirius turned his head and saw Harry inching his hand out of his sleeve.

“You’re a blackmailing arse,” Harry muttered.

Sirius chuckled humorlessly. “Says the kid who throws my worst mistake in my face every other day.”

Harry paused as he unwrapped his hand. He looked up at Sirius and his green eyes flashed with a shadow of remorse.

“Quit trying to leave me then,” Harry said quietly.

It wasn’t ‘I’m sorry’, but Harry didn’t do apologies.

Sirius didn’t either, so he leaned to read between the lines.

“I won’t.” Sirius nodded at Harry’s hand. “Let’s see it.”

Harry hissed when he removed the rag and Sirius clenched his jaw so tightly that his neck was sure to be sore for days.

There, in the middle of the back of Harry’s bloodied hand, were the words ‘I must not tell lies’.

Dolores Umbridge had permanently branded Harry a liar for the rest of his life.

Harry jerked away when Sirius thoughtlessly reached out for his hand. Sirius wanted to offer some comfort, offer anything, but the heated anger fled him and left behind only misery at the harsh look on Harry’s face.

“Don’t touch it,” Harry told him. He softened his voice at Sirius’ devastated expression, “It’ll hurt.”

Sirius nodded absently and laid his head back against the rough and grimy rock wall.

“What are you even doing here, Harry?” Sirius asked. “You hate this fucking place.”

“I don’t,” Harry lied immediately. It was as if Harry thought that Sirius hadn’t memorized every teary and rage fueled conversation they had last year - Hogwarts wasn’t the place Harry once thought it was, Harry was miserable there and had been since his name came out of the bloody goblet.

Harry glared at Sirius’ look of doubt. “Maybe you forgot, Pads, but I can’t exactly vanquish Voldemort with all my knowledge about muggle chemistry, can I?”

Sirius chuckled and slumped down, paying no mind to the grimy walls behind them.

“You’re not going to vanquish anyone,” he said. He held his hand up when Harry began to argue. “The prophecy is bullshit, Harry, I told you that. No, listen,” he insisted. “Don’t be an idiot, so much of that prophecy is already wrong. Tony’s never defied Voldemort, and you’re definitely born from him.”

The roll of Harry’s eyes and the scathing look on his face was just further proof. James could never have pulled off a look so cynical.

James never had to.

“But ‘marked as his equal, neither can live while the other survives’,” Harry pressed stubbornly. “That’s what you said.”

“If the beginning is bullshit, then the end is too,” Sirius said, impatient to force his godson to understand. There was no reason for Harry to be there, if his only goal at Hogwarts was defeating Voldemort, then Harry should go back to New York where he was safe. “Your dad didn’t defy Voldemort and you’re not going to vanquish him. It’s not happening,” he said firmly. “Let’s call Tony, see if you can’t get home to that puppy and Joey by the end of the week.”

Harry blinked and his irritation melted to quick confusion at Sirius’ lame joke.

“I’ve only got the one dog?” Harry said slowly.

Sirius smirked at him. “Yeah? So there’s not a shaggy haired boy with big brown eyes that follows you around with his tail wagging?” Sirius made his eyes go big and goofy like the posh looking boy from Harry’s party.

Harry’s cheeks darkened and he ducked his head again. “Peter is not a dog,” he said. “Merlin, Sirius.”

Sirius took the chance to reach over and gently place his hand on Harry’s head, curling his fingers in his hair when Harry didn’t fight him.

“Go home, Harry,” he said softly, pleadingly. “This isn’t it anymore, is it?”

Harry scratched his leg with his right hand and shrugged his shoulders up defensively.

“Can’t,” he whispered. “You don’t understand.”

“What don’t I understand?”

Harry didn’t say anything and Sirius kept up his silent stroking of Harry’s hair while he mentally begged Harry to talk.

He couldn’t help him if he wouldn’t talk to him, and Sirius would do anything to lighten the load on Harry’s shoulders.

Anything at all.

“Tony said he loves me,” Harry said, still whispering, as if worried that speaking up would startle Sirius… or perhaps himself. Despite Harry’s constant act of cold defiance, Sirius though he was a pretty sensitive kid.

And since he didn’t get that from Lily, Sirius assumed that Tony had to be pretty sensitive as well. Deep, deep, down inside anyway.

“That’s great,” Sirius said genuinely when Harry didn’t say anything else. “You deserve that, kiddo.”

And Harry did. More than anyone, Harry deserved to have a parent tell him they loved him, were proud of him, and things like ‘don’t worry, I’ll handle this’.

Sirius got that once he moved in with James from Effie and Fleamont and god knew it changed his whole life. Sirius had been on a fast path of self-destruction with the booze and the boys, the bikes and the nights Sirius didn’t remember his own name.

And if someone didn’t do something for Harry, something more than the piss poor job Sirius was doing, then he’d be on just as fast of a track to a half-sized coffin after another plunge from a tower.

Harry didn’t look like someone real thrilled to have a parent - a biological parent who loved him and wanted to protect him and make him happy even - he looked more miserable than ever at Sirius words.

“Do I?” Harry asked. He kept his face ducked and his tone soft. “Do I deserve it if I run away again? Hide out and act like a coward?”

Sirius’ hand froze and he tilted his head as he tried to get a look at Harry’s face.

“You came back to… to earn Tony’s love?” Sirius asked him, trying to clarify the nonsensical thing Harry just stated so simply. It had baffled Sirius when Harry told him he wanted to go back. Harry leaving England altogether had been the best day of Sirius’ life, and it hadn’t made sense when he returned.

Sirius had assumed it had something to do with Voldemort and Albus finding Harry’s location, but… but Sirius forgot about all of Harry’s insecurities and his disbelief that anyone would simply care about him without cause.

Harry nodded shortly and Sirius pinched his brows together while he tried to find the best way to give Harry a hard truth.

“Harry…” Sirius stroked Harry’s hair slowly, waiting for the tense muscles in Harry’s neck and shoulders to relax. “Love isn’t something you earn, kiddo, it’s just… just something people give you for free.”

Harry scoffed and turned his head away. He raised his hand to swipe at his face and Sirius politely pretended not to notice.

“What would you know? Your mum was worse than the Dursleys,” Harry muttered. “You said she didn’t love you.”

Sirius grinned with a bit of nostalgia as he thought of the family that did teach him about love and why he didn’t have to buy it or earn it.

“She didn’t,” Sirius said, the old hurt mostly gone from his heart. “But your dad James did, and your grandparents did. And they never asked for anything in return.”

Effie and Fleamont wouldn’t take Sirius’ money when he’d gotten an inheritance from his Uncle. They wouldn’t let him work for his keep. They wouldn’t accept anything he tried to give them.

“We just want you to be safe and loved,” Effie had said after Sirius burned breakfast in an attempt to earn the affection they kept suffocating him with.

“Perhaps mildly less vulgar,” Fleamont added gruffly as he eyed Sirius’ rather crude tshirt with a bikini model on a bike.

“All Tony wants is for you to be safe and happy,” Sirius told Harry confidently. He moved his hand from Harry’s head to his shoulders and pulled him close to his side. “Maybe less of a sarcastic prick,” he added drily.

“Wonder where I got it from,” Harry scoffed weakly. He leaned in Sirius’ side and they sat peacefully for a few minutes. Sirius anguishing over Harry who was too like him and Harry with whatever thoughts clouded his brain that just didn’t draw the same conclusions as everyone else.

When Harry yawned, Sirius checked the time and poked Harry in the shoulder gently.

“Time for bed,” he said.

Harry nodded and slowly got to his feet. He looked exhausted too, just physically, mentally, and emotionally wrung to hell. Sirius supported him then made an indignant noise when Harry yanked the invisibility cloak off the ground and wrapped himself in it.

“You lost invisibility privileges,” Harry said, sounding mildly more like himself. “I can’t have you coming and killing the professors every time they piss me off.”

“Snivellus would deserve it,” Sirius said cheerily. “Miserable old bat.”

Harry gave him a brief grin before he narrowed his eyes and edged toward the ladder to take him back to the corridors of Hogwarts.

“You’ll go home?” Harry asked.

Sirius nodded, “Yeah. You’ll call me tonight?”

“Yeah. Night, Padfoot.”

“Night, kiddo. Love you.”

Harry gave him a crooked smile then disappeared beneath the cloak.

 

As soon as the trapdoor closed behind him, Sirius turned and made his way back to Hogsmeade.

It had been rather impulsive to go kill Umbridge himself. Why kill her and risk his freedom, upsetting Harry, when Harry had a parent perfectly willing to make Umbridge as miserable as he had Lily’s sister and her husband?

Tony had the ability, and creativity, to scar Umbridge worse than she had Harry. And all Sirius needed to do was make one quick little phone call and he could get Harry out of that hell hole and ruin the witch who had tortured Harry for kicks.

 

Maybe he could get Tony to ruin Snape too - a pleasant idea after a nightmarish day, anyway.

Chapter Text

“Nat, on your left!” Steve snapped, his voice commanding in Tony’s ear.

“I’m on it,” Nat said.

Tony focused on trying to cage the silver haired guy literally running circles around them. “Be a great time to get pissed,” he said through the headset. “Go smash some shit, Br—”

“Mister Stark, Mister Black is calling.”

Tony took a shot at one of the tanks guarding the base. “Patch him through.”

“Sirius, hey, not a great time,” Tony said. He ignored Clint’s snort in his ear at his drastic understatement. They were getting their asses kicked by the witch-bitch and the quick-kid. JARVIS had a lock on the scepter, but Tony was busy playing defense while the quick-kid kept them on their toes.

“Oh, you too busy to hear about Harry’s new defense professor?”

Tony swore quietly and tried again to swerve the superhuman whatever that kept blocking him from entering the building where the scepter was.

“Talk quick,” Tony told Sirius. “When I say I’m a bit busy, I mean it.”

“Tony, help Thor,” Nat ordered.

Tony turned and saw Thor spinning his hammer and figured the God of Thunder could use some juice to strike down the witch with the glowing hands and red hair.

“I’m on it,” Tony said. He sent as much power as he could spare to Thor from one of his repulsers while Sirius filled him in on whatever was going on with his kid.

“Harry’s defense professor’s had him in detention all week—”

“Tony’s son? Shocker,” Clint muttered.

“Yeah, he told me,” Tony said impatiently. He watched as Thor took a shot at the witch and winced at the super-powered shield she used to block herself. Sirius certainly didn’t have her powers.

“Did he tell you she’s carving his hand open every night?”

Tony shot off a repulser with much more power than he intended and cursed just as strongly as it burnt through the trees and left a path open for Cap to advance.

“She’s fucking what?!” Tony demanded while he held himself back. He needed to know what was happening with Harry before he went scooping up the scepter. He waved Clint ahead impatiently when he lingered beside where Tony hovered above the ground.

Sirius sounded as solemn as he ever had in Tony’s ear.

“It’s called a Blood Quill, Harry writes and it carves the words in his hand. He’s got some nasty scars from it already.”

And Harry never said a word about it. Tony talked to him every day, every single day, and the kid didn’t say a word about having to cut himself for a punishment.

But he told Sirius.

“Tony! We could use some help in here!” Steve called over the headset.

Tony wanted to scream with frustration.

His team needed him.

His kid needed him.

“Damn it all,” Tony spat. “Sirius, go get Harry. Tell Albus he broke our deal and Harry’s done there.”

“Oh, sure,” Sirius drawled sardonically. “I’ll just go marching in the school with the ministry hag, shall I? Think you can bust me out of Azkaban before the dementors steal my soul?”

“TONY!”

“DAMN IT!” Tony yelled. “Sirius, give me like an hour and I’ll go get him myself! I’ll call you back!”

Tony hung up on Sirius and flew full blast to the compound the team was in. He didn’t have time to jack around with the super-duo or the scepter.

“We’ve got a pit stop to make when we’re done here,” Tony told the team casually as he flew in the room and began shooting at the blur of silver that was protecting the red-head.

“Are we rescuing your son from the bad sorcerers?” Thor asked loudly. He swung his hammer at the witch-bitch when she approached Steve with her glowing hands and a snarl twisting her face.

“We’re going to—”

Tony cut himself off when a loud growl sounded just outside the compound. The five Avengers fighting inside the room had less than thirty seconds warning before the Hulk burst in the room with his large green fists swinging.

“Guess you managed to piss off the big guy,” Clint said. He ducked to avoid the Hulk as it took a swing at the quick-kid. “Tony, grab the stick and let’s get the hell out of here.”

“Happily,” Tony said. He went for the scepter and then everything was gone.

 

Black.

Empty.

A wormhole in space.

The endless void of nothing.

Tony flew through the dark until he saw a light.

Was he supposed to fly away from the light?

Tony landed on a rocky expanse of some other world planet.

“Dad!” Harry laid on the ground and Tony rushed to him. He laid there with his face colorless and his bright eyes dull and lifeless. Tony couldn’t even think—

How?

Why?

He’d flown in there alone.

Harry coughed and raised a hand to Tony.

“Dad…”

 

Tony sucked in a shuddering gasp as Harry disappeared.

“Harry!” Tony sat up and looked around frantically. “Harry!”

“Someone calm him down,” a familiar voice called. “And get those coordinates pulled up from the kid’s phone.”

“The kid?” Tony sat up and blinked at his surroundings. He was in the jet, laying in the back cargo area. He saw Bruce, no longer green and angry, Steve, Clint, Thor, and…

“What the hell is she doing here?” Tony demanded as he saw the witch-bitch in question sitting quietly between Clint and the silver haired quick-kid.

The witch was peering at him with big eyes and a puzzled expression.

“No ‘thank you for saving my life’?” The quick-kid said with a snotty snort.

“You were the ones trying to kill us,” Clint said curtly with a glare for the duo they’d been fighting before Tony…

Blacked out?

“The point remains,” quick-kid scoffed.

“My name is Wanda,” the witch said quietly to Tony, a musical lilt to her voice that contrasted sharply with her fierce persona he’d been exposed to. “Did you create your son as well or was he born with magic inside him?”

“As well?” Tony repeated. He accepted Bruce’s hand when it was offered and slowly got to his feet. He looked down and saw his suit was off him, probably removed by Steve after he’d blacked out.

“Wait…” Tony narrowed his eyes at ‘Wanda’. “What do you know about my son?”

The magic Wanda had wielded had been nothing like what Sirius had shown him. When Tony had called it magic, JARVIS had recognized whatever power Wanda used as something different than the magic Sirius cast through his wand.

And none of it explained how Wanda knew about Harry.

“Were you in my head?” Tony lunged toward Wanda without a thought for his suit. He’d kill her with his bare hands. “WHAT DID YOU DO TO HARRY?”

Wanda threw her hands up and placed a shimmering red bubble to surround her while Tony’s mind went back to that endless nothing filled with only the memory of Harry dying because Tony hadn’t done enough.

“Tony! Calm down!” Nat ordered from the cockpit. “Give me the coordinates if you want to pick your son up.”

Pick his son up…

Pick Harry up…

Damn.

Tony turned away from Wanda and aimed a harsh kick at a nearby bench.

“JARVIS, put the coordinates for Harry’s phone in the navigation,” he ordered.

“Yes, Mister Stark. We are approximately thirty-two minutes from Mister Harry’s location.”

“Great.” Tony spun back around and crossed his arms as he glared at the duo that had no business on the jet. “That’s plenty of time to hear about why you two are on my jet when you should be in prison.”

The quick-kid crossed his legs and gave Tony a cold look.

“You killed our family, the least you could do is give us a ride on your jet bought with blood-money.”

 

Tony sank down in a seat across from the duo and let them tell him their story.

Wanda described a bombing that took their parents and destroyed their home. Pietro, her twin brother apparently, described laying next to a radioactive bomb for days as they stared at the name ‘STARK’ on the side and wondered when it would explode and kill them.

And, when they were done, Tony wondered if flying in that wormhole would have ever removed the sins that stained his skin for an eternity.

“I’ve never met another user of magic,” Wanda told Tony in an awed whisper. “I saw your son in your mind, was he created with the scepter as well?”

“The scepter?” Bruce had stood beside Tony and listened to their story. He’d probably been too green to hear it the first time, since the others were involved in their own conversations and ignoring the twins. “Is that where you got your powers from?”

“I did,” Pietro said in an arrogant drawl. “Those that saved us, HYDRA, ran experiments. I survived.”

There was an implication there that there were more that didn’t survive HYDRA’s experiments.

“I have always been…” Wanda glanced at her brother and they shared a smirk. “Different,” she said slowly as she turned back to face Tony and Bruce. “I would like to speak with him.”

Tony bristled and curled his lip up, “I don’t think so.”

“Really? Because we’re about to land,” Nat called. “Where am I supposed to put this thing?”

Tony moved to a window and looked down at the forest beneath them. Where the hell they were, he had no idea, but the closest space he could see was a wide stretch of green lawns that surrounded a large abandoned church.

“Oh, it’s lovely,” Wanda breathed as she followed Tony to look down at the ground. “Your son lives here?”

Tony squinted at the church that had the caved in roof and the wild weeds surrounding it and climbing up the sides. The windows were boarded up and the peeling paint on the siding looked like it had been destroyed by the elements. Sure, maybe if used to be ‘lovely’, but Tony would be pissed if that’s where his son had been the last few weeks.

“It better not be,” Tony said. “JARVIS, ping Harry’s location again.”

“Mister Harry is within a ten mile radius, sir. I’ve sent his precise location to your phone.”

“Drop it here, Nat,” Tony said. He frowned at his phone that confirmed Harry was nearby. “Call Sirius,” he ordered JARVIS absently.

Sirius answered almost immediately.

“Took you long enough,” he snarked right off the bat, his voice flowing over the speakers in the jet. “You get Harry?”

“Bit of a problem there, bud,” Clint said. “Is the kid inside the creepy church?”

“Church?” Wanda and Thor both turned toward them.

“You don’t see the castle?” Wanda asked.

Tony looked toward Thor and he looked as surprised as Wanda sounded.

“It is as clear as ever,” Thor said with a deep boom. He waved his hand toward the window. “It is a magnificent home for young Stark.”

“Ooh, Tony, you idiot,” Sirius chuckled. “Do you have your magic proof suit on?”

Tony didn’t, but it only took a moment to get it on.

“Check again,” Sirius told him.

“Holy shit.” Tony moved to the window with his mask in place after Nat landed on the grounds and what had once been an overgrown and overwhelmed building - crumbling and an eyesore, had changed to a gleaming castle. An actual, honest to god, complete with large towers that overlooked the grounds, castle.

Sirius’ smile was clear in his tone, “Welcome to Hogwarts, Tony.”

*****

Tony looked up at the entrance to the castle, a smirk on his lips.

They really were living in the dark ages.

“To knock or not to knock, that is the question,” Tony murmured as he pushed the door wide open.

He stepped inside and immediately felt like he had been transported to some horrible medieval times where they were using candlesticks to light the stone hallway he stood in.

“Jarvis, how much power do we have?” Tony murmured, his eyes zeroing in on the set of doors beside him where it sounded as if hundreds of people were congregating.

“71%, sir.”

“Are we in contact with the jet?”

“No, sir.”

“Better kick on those boosters then,” Tony instructed as he took a step closer to the doors. It might have been a mistake to leave Thor on the ship, but Tony didn’t trust the twins alone with the scepter or his team. “We’re about to fight more wizards.”

“Excellent, sir. May I suggest replacing your face mask?”

“Good idea,” Tony agreed. He waited for his mask to snap in place before settling his nerves with a even breath and kicking one of the doors open as dramatically as he could.

As much of a buzz of noise as there had been, it went dead silent as the people within the room took in Tony and Tony took them in.

There was a very quiet ‘You’re fucking joking’ from a familiar voice though.

Tony spared a quick look, searching through a table of dead silent students dressed in identical and clichéd black robes with Iron Man colored ties, before he found the kid he wanted.

Harry didn’t look so hot. Bags under his eyes, apparently a lot of sleepless nights, and his face looked maybe a little thinner? Or was Tony imagining it? Tony didn’t like the way that there seemed to be a bubble around Harry and his friends either, a bubble that told Tony that his kid was being isolated for something. But that glare on Harry’s face was unmistakable.

“Mister Stark!”

Tony’s assessment of Harry was cut short when Albus stood up — dear God, as bleak as the castle was, it had to be because Albus took all the color in his gaudy robes — and smiled at Tony as if they were the best of friends.

Which was such a damn contrast to Tony’s inner feeling of murderous rage that it was almost comical.

“What a pleasant surprise,” Albus said, his voice filling the room. “Had I known you were coming, I would have met you on the grounds. You had no trouble finding us?”

If Tony were anyone else, he might be thrown off by Albus’ pleasant greeting and polite questions, almost as if he actually had invited him to the castle, but he was Tony Stark and this was his show to run.

“No problem at all,” Tony said, just as pleasantly as he approached the table where Albus sat along with the other adults (Tony would hardly refer to them as teachers, considering why he was there). “It’s amazing the things you can do with the right technology, take central air, for example.”

Someone, a student to Tony’s left, whispered, “Is that bloody Iron Man?”

“In the flesh,” Tony quipped. He watched Albus closely, wishing he could drop his face shield to show him exactly how unhappy he was. “I had some errands to run nearby, thought I’d stop and pick up my son since Albus is a damned liar. Oh, incidentally…” Tony’s eyes scanned the adults slowly as he came to stop in the center of the room. “Which one of you is Dolores Umbridge?”

The stern looking woman in the black robes sitting on the right of Albus coughed and pointed at the—

“Dear God, I can’t even look at you,” Tony cried dramatically. “Ugh. I didn’t even know pink could be so bright and unattractive.”

Tony pretended to shield his eyes as the squat woman with the beady eyes and tacky pink sweater, complete with shoulder pads, turned a deep shade of red and quiet giggles came from the students.

Tony turned his head toward where Harry sat, his friends shaking with silent laughter while Harry looked horrified. “You told me hobbits weren’t real! Or… are trolls real? And do they all prefer to dress in the most clashing shades of pink?”

The girl beside Harry lost her fight and put her face on the table, right beside a plate of food, her suppressed laughter now loud and clear.

Harry didn’t look quite so amused.

“Ahem.” The ugly woman coughed and smiled at Tony, somehow making her even uglier. “I’m afraid I don’t know you, Mister…?”

“It’s bloody Iron Man,” the same student from before mumbled again.

“Is your hearing as impaired as your vision?” Tony asked the woman. Tony turned enough to look through the room, “Was it just me a moment ago who heard Gandalf the Lame say my name?”

More laughter, it was vindicating to know that Tony’s jokes weren’t as lost on the kids as they were the adults.

The girl beside Harry, Hermione Granger, Tony recognized her now from when he searched for Harry’s friends’ identities before, raised a hand, and wow, Tony forgot that he was not a fan of kids who weren’t his.

Harry grabbed the girl’s wrist and pulled it down, shaking his head at her and mumbling something Tony couldn’t hear.

“We heard him, sir,” a red head boy at the end of the table where Harry sat piped up.

“He clearly said: ‘Harry Potter’s creepy robot dad, welcome,’” the identical red head beside the first one added.

“Did he just say that Potter’s dad is Iron Man?!”

Tony shouldn’t have been surprised that Harry hadn’t told anyone about his ‘kidnapping and surprise adoption’, as the kid called it, but there was a wash of whispers from the students that sounded a lot like hot gossip.

“Exactly!” Tony pointed at the grinning twins as he turned back to the adults in the room. “Tony Stark, feel free to call me Mister Stark, or, more accurately, the father of the kid who you tortured as a punishment.”

Tony was pleased to be in his suit as the temperature in the castle seemed to drop ten degrees. Though, whether that was due to the lack of manufactured heat, or the way that the adults all turned to glare at Umbridge and the students seemed torn between looking at Tony or Harry, remained to be seen.

“Perhaps we should take this to my office?” Albus suggested, remaining on his feet and waving toward a door behind him. “Mister Stark, Dolores?” His eyes sought Harry out, “And Harry?”

“No need,” Tony said brightly. “I’m taking my son home, personally writing to every single one of the parents of these students with non-magical parents about the torture my kid went through, and you can all bite my shiny metal ass.”

A couple quiet snorts, further proof that some of those kids had a decent sense of humor. Or a decent cable hookup at home, anyway.

“We had a deal, Gandalf,” Tony added coolly.

And, since Tony was a man of his word, unlike some old wizards with bad fashion sense, he looked down the row of adults until he found the one that had to be the hateful ass Sirius described.

But since they couldn’t see Tony’s eyes, and Tony was a big fan of dramatic productions, Tony went on to fulfill his promise before Albus could try and sweet talk his way in to making the absolute bitch fest Tony had planned private.

“And who is the,” Tony tried to recall Sirius’ precise words before he’d gotten off the jet, “greasy slimeball that called my son an ‘arrogant idiot with an inflated sense of self-worth that he undoubtedly got from his father’?”

The witch that Tony was beginning to realize seemed to be the most relaxed at the table coughed again and pointed directly to the man Tony had been eyeing.

“Awesome, two for one today.” Tony raised a hand, activating a meaningless buzzing noise as he pointed a red laser light at the man’s head. “Greasy looking Cullen—”

Ooh. The loud laughs he got that time had actually hurt, Tony only knew the movie because Pepper watched it and they laughed the whole time. There should not be that many British magic kids that knew of Twilight.

“—care to explain?”

Tony registered Albus’ wand sliding in to his hand, it was presumably the same thing the greasy one, Snape, did when his right arm moved but his lips stayed in a disgusted sneer.

As if Tony were the one who looked like he never showered or went out in the sun.

“Do your worst,” Tony taunted him. He glanced up at his stat screen and saw the suit was at full power. “You think you can shoot a spell at me before I can blow a hole in your head? Hell, I bet I can kill you and the color-blind Miss Trunchbull before you can stun me,” Tony smiled behind his mask at the laughs, proof that muggleborns and half-bloods were really the more interesting students, and then he added on a cool and drawn out, “Snivellus.”

Snape lunged to his feet, his face furious now, and a shimmering wall suddenly appeared between Tony and Snape.

“That is enough,” Albus said, his words silencing the laughing students. “Mister Stark, Mister Potter, D—”

“Potter-Stark.”

Tony kept his arm up, his laser pointing at Snape’s forehead, though he’d rather point it at Umbridge, and turned his head enough to see Harry getting to his feet and slinging a bag over his shoulder.

“I believe the Headmaster was speaking to—”

“Shut the hell up because you’re next,” Tony warned Umbridge when she dared talk to his son. Confident that Snape wasn’t going to do more than sneer at him, Tony moved the laser light to Umbridge’s flat nose. “Think I can carve ‘I will not wear pink’ on your forehead? Because I think I can.”

It was vindicating when the woman cowered, cringing away from the beam of light. Tony wouldn’t kill a woman in front of a hundred kids, but if she said one more word he might forget about their innocent eyes.

Harry darted around tables to stand beside Tony, frowning up at him. “What the hell are you doing?” he whispered. “Have you lost the plot?”

“New plot,” Tony told Harry, “you go get your stuff, I’ll officially unenroll you, then we talk about how secrets don’t make friends on the flight home.”

Tony expected Harry to fight with him, to storm away and refuse to leave. He’d been prepared to simply snatch his kid and fly through the glass ceiling, but apparently he and Sirius both misjudged Harry’s unhappiness within the medieval castle.

Harry glanced toward his friends - the redhead boy beside Hermione Granger - then looked up at Tony and nodded shortly.

“I’ll just grab my trunk and meet you out front?”

Tony beamed and turned his focus back on Gandalf.

“Sounds good, kid. I’ll have my first ever parent-teacher conference in the meantime then.”

Chapter Text

September 12

The portrait hole no more than swung closed behind Harry before it opened right back up. He turned his head and saw Ron and Hermione climbing through.

Hermione’s cheeks were wet with the tears of laughter she had been crying in the Great Hall and Ron looked like someone had made his birthday a national holiday.

“Mate…” Ron was smiling too hard to even speak properly. “Wicked… just… wicked.”

Hermione must have seen Harry’s red cheeks and scowl because she tried to rearrange her face into something more sympathetic.

“Of course I’m sure you were very embarrassed,” she said in a high pitch voice that wasn’t sympathetic at all. “But, Harry, he called Umbridge a colorblind Trunchbull!”

Harry sighed while his friends collapsed in giggles again. Personally, he didn’t see the humor. He was sure it was more obscure references Tony loved to make, but it had been humiliating either way.

Not only did Tony announce to the entire school that Umbridge had Harry write those lines, but then he went on and pissed off two of Harry’s professors.

“Imagine if I were staying,” Harry hissed at the two of them. “Snape would chop me in potions ingredients!”

Ron snorted and tried to control his laughter. “Or he’d never talk to you again,” he said with an annoying grin. “‘Snivellus’, he called him!”

“I’m going to grab my stuff,” Harry scowled when Hermione and Ron started shrieking with laughter once more. “Idiots.”

Harry stomped up the staircase to the boys dorm, fuming all the while. The first thing he did before he started packing was pull his phone out and send a quick message to Sirius.

Traitor.

Harry was never telling him anything.

 

Everything had been packed while Harry’s heart slowed from the frantic pace it had been beating to and he slowly became numb. The thought that he was actually leaving and not returning kept circling his mind. A small part of him was relieved - no more Umbridge, no more whispers questioning his sanity, no more hero one day and deranged lunatic the next - but another part of him was disappointed.

No more magic. No more finding a way to vanquish Voldemort and earn the life being offered to him. No more doing something that his parents could be proud of.

Harry reminded himself that he wasn’t running away this time, not really. Tony was making him leave, wasn’t he? Harry couldn’t attend Hogwarts without his parent’s permission.

A quiet voice whispered that Harry could probably fight to stay, but Harry hushed it quickly.

Harry wasn’t being a coward by leaving, his parent was making him go.

 

It was entirely different.

 

Ron and Hermione were still in the common room when Harry drug his trunk down the stairs. Hermione rolled her eyes at him before swishing her wand and casting a levitation charm on the trunk.

“Honestly,” she muttered.

Ron grinned and held up the fancy golden cage that Tony had purchased just last month. Hedwig hooted happily at Harry inside of it and Harry smiled appreciatively at his best mate.

“Thanks,” he told Ron earnestly. Harry poked a finger in Hedwig’s cage and stroked her beak softly. “Ready to go home, girl?”

Hedwig trilled out a joyful noise and Harry tried to let that soothe away his guilt at leaving. If Hedwig was pleased, then that should count for something.

 

Hermione sniffled when she and Ron followed Harry down to the Entrance Hall. Harry was relieved that the hall was empty, the students probably went to gossip in their common rooms after what had to be the most exciting dinner they’d had in…

Well. In Harry’s history of dinners at Hogwarts, anyway.

“I’m glad you’re going to be happier, but I’m going to miss you,” Hermione said as they lingered by the door. Her eyes were sparkling with genuine tears and Harry resigned himself to being hugged by one of his first ever friends. Hermione hugged Harry tightly and then Ron took her place, giving Harry a quick and manly hug.

“You’ll call us on Hermione’s phone?” Ron asked gruffly, staring at the ground rather than Harry’s face.

Harry nodded at his own shoes. He cleared his throat and looked up at Ron through his fringe. “Yeah, I will.” Harry attempted to smile at the first friend he ever truly made. He felt oddly bashful at the thought of leaving Ron behind, they’d been close as brothers since Harry’s first year - the three weeks last November notwithstanding. “Reckon you two’ll kill each other before Christmas break?” Harry asked as a weak joke.

The tears spilled over Hermione’s lids and she threw her arms around Harry and Ron both as she began crying in earnest. Harry sent Ron a bewildered look and Ron merely shook his head; girls were mad.

Hermione pulled back and gave Harry a trembling and wet smile. “You have to invite us over for Christmas,” she insisted. “We want to meet the rest of your family and Peter of course!”

“And Arsehole!” Ron added. He winced and rubbed his shoulder when Hermione smacked him. “What?” he whined. “Harry’s the one who named him!”

Harry felt a twinge of regret wash through him as his two friends began bickering in a way that was exasperatingly familiar. Neither Ron nor Hermione were perfect, but Harry wasn’t either, and he didn’t think he could have ever asked for better mates to have than the two of them. They were the ones that made Hogwarts Harry’s home when he first started and the ones that made it bearable the last two years.

“I’ll miss you guys,” Harry said softly, interrupting their argument. He hadn’t meant to make Hermione start crying again, but that was precisely what happened.

Harry was buried in a group hug with Ron and Hermione for what felt like ‘long enough for Hermione to soak Harry’s shoulder with her noisy crying’. Finally, just when Harry thought he might actually drown from Hermione’s tears, a familiar buzzing noise filled the corridor and the three of them turned to the staircase.

Tony flew down the staircase in his flashy Iron Man suit and somehow, with a mask covering his face, seemed to radiate smugness in the most irritating way.

“Bloody hell,” Ron breathed. Ron didn’t look irritated by Tony’s smug demeanor or flashy entrance, he looked so impressed that it was a wonder he didn’t fall to his knees in worship then and there. Ron turned a bright smile toward Harry. “Think he’ll kidnap and adopt me too?”

“No can do, champ,” Tony said, apparently overhearing Ron’s joke. His voice came out distorted and flat, but it was unmistakably his.

“Sir, did you really unenroll Harry?” Hermione asked Tony breathlessly. Her eyes were shining as she gazed up at Tony in a very Lockhart-esque way.

“Sure did,” Tony said. “Ready, kid?”

Harry looked around the Entrance Hall slowly. He drank in the feeling of magic in the walls that once made him feel so safe and so special. He looked at the candles floating up on the ceiling and the gleaming doors of the Great Hall.

Goodbye, Harry told his first home with equal parts peace and gloom.

“Yeah,” Harry told Tony, “let’s go home.”

 

Harry took one step on the giant black jet parked on the rolling grounds outside the gate and froze.

“You must be Stark’s son!” A giant man with long blonde hair and a black jumpsuit topped off with a flowing red cape stormed across the jet to Harry and raised a hand the size of Harry’s head to him. Harry jumped backward immediately only to bump into Tony’s metal suit.

Tony maneuvered around Harry and dropped his face shield once he was inside the jet.

“Jesus, Thor, back up,” he grouched. “You smell terrible and the kid doesn’t want to smell the sweat of a God.” He turned enough so Harry could see his crooked grin, “Harry, meet Thor.”

Harry nodded while it felt like his heart was beating inside his throat. He carefully followed Tony toward a bench and then stopped again when two more people were sitting there.

Tony had too many damn friends.

“Hello.” The woman sitting on the bench rose to her feet and her brown eyes were sparkling when she smiled prettily at Harry. “I am Wanda,” she said. She had an odd accent, different than Harry’s and Tony’s other friends.

“And I’m Pietro,” the bloke with silver-blonde hair said. His eyes were sparkling as well when he smirked at Harry and stood to offer him a hand.

Harry looked from his hand to the woman beside him and then to Tony.

“And I’m not interested,” Harry said. He set Hedwig’s cage on top of his trunk that Tony carried to the jet and settled for sitting on the trunk beside her and petting her through the bars.

Tony called out an order to take the jet home and Harry couldn’t resist turning to look out the window as they flew up… up… up… away from Hogwarts.

“It’s a pretty picture,” Tony told Harry, startling him by his ability to sneak up on him in his suit. Harry looked at Tony’s face, scanning it to see what he was thinking, and saw nothing but a glimmer of happiness in his eyes and a grin on his lips.

“Yeah.” Harry looked back down at where Hogwarts disappeared from sight as they moved faster than Harry ever had in his life. “It used to be brilliant,” he said quietly.

Tony’s hand creeped slowly over, giving Harry time to realize what he was about to do.

“For what it’s worth, I’m glad you’re coming home,” Tony said as his hand landed on Harry’s shoulder.

Harry tried to remember that it wasn’t Tony he was angry with - Tony didn’t seem to be able to help himself when it came to being a dramatic prat - and he nodded shortly.

“Was Professor Dumbledore angry?” Harry asked curiously, dodging having to respond to Tony’s sentiment.

Tony laughed and sat on the floor right beside Harry’s trunk.

“Old Albus? No,” he said. “The ‘Minister of Magic’? Yeah, a bit.”

Harry gaped at him and the others in the jet seemed to be eavesdropping without making it blatantly obvious as Tony filled Harry in on his ‘parent teacher conference’.

“Who’s the witch with the bun and the thin lips?”

“Professor McGonagall, she’s- she was my Head of House.”

“I like her. So she called Minister Fudge, who, by the way, is definitely an idiot, to report assault on a student.”

Harry scowled and dropped his head, his irritation at Sirius filling him again. Sirius was a terrible friend. Harry doubted it Sirius would like it very much if Harry went around telling everyone how jealous he was of Lupin and Tonks or how much being in his childhood home gave him anxiety. But Harry wouldn’t tell anyone, because Harry knew how to keep a secret.

Tony went on as if Harry wasn’t silently plotting revenge against his godfather.

“So he shows up while I’m fighting with Snivellus—”

Harry bit his lip hard to keep from laughing at the way Tony adopted Sirius’ hateful nickname for Snape.

“And he decides to say that you’re a liar, blah blah blah, you can’t be trusted, clearly you’re looking for attention, blah blah blah.”

“Clearly,” Harry agreed with a sneer. He lifted his head and saw that Tony actually looked irritated about Minister Fudge’s words, which… which was nice, really. People who believed Harry for things he couldn’t or wouldn’t prove were few and far in between.

Tony raised a brow and nodded. “Right, so I tore into him, asking why he was defending his staff when they were the ones attacking school kids. Then Gandalf got involved, he told Fudge that Umbridge had to leave his school and they were still fighting over it when I asked McGonagall to get me a list of all muggleborns in the school, or anyone with at least one muggle parent.”

“What is a muggle?” Wanda asked.

Harry didn’t even turn to look at her, he just watched Hedwig sleep as he stroked her wings.

“Someone without magic,” Harry told her. “Why’d you want those names?” he asked Tony.

Tony sounded smug, “So I could write to their parents, let them know about what passes for detention in that place.”

Harry snorted. “Right. Did she get it?”

“Nope. Said it was against policy.”

That made sense, especially with Voldemort back and his prejudice against muggleborns. A list of muggleborn students floating around could be a disaster for those kids and their families.

“She told me to take an ad out in the papers.”

Harry looked up at Tony and saw a smile on his face that he hesitantly mirrored back at him.

“Are you going to?” Harry asked him.

“No need.” Tony’s smile was just as smug as it was thrilled. “Umbridge was being terminated when I decided that the lack of actual light and technology was making me itch.”

Harry released a heavy breath. That was a relief. He hadn’t been thrilled to have his detentions told to the entire bloody school, but if it got rid of Umbridge, then at least nobody else would suffer through them while Harry was gone.

“That’s good,” he said evenly. “Hermione’ll be happy.”

“This calls for revels!” Thor boomed, his loud voice causing Harry to twitch as he turned to see the giant God/man standing much too close to them with a hammer the size of Harry’s head in his hands.

“We have secured Loki’s scepter, you have saved your son from the wicked sorcerers, and we have new friends!” Thor said, swinging his hammer toward Wanda and Pietro. “We must celebrate with food and drink!”

Tony jumped to his feet at once with a bright smile.

“Oh, this absolutely calls for food and drink,” he laughed. He waggled his brows at Harry, “You in?”

Harry glanced uneasily where Wanda sat, her eyes hadn’t left Harry’s face since he stepped foot on the jet, then where the others were all practically shaking with excitement.

“As I’ve been kidnapped once again, I suppose I don’t have much of a choice,” he said in a slow drawl.

Tony laughed and put his hand on Harry’s shoulder again.

“That’s the spirit!”

*****

As mixed as Harry’s emotions were about leaving Hogwarts - letting everyone down, unable to defend himself once again - he felt a little better when he stepped in the tower from the jet and Joey came running to him with his tail wagging.

“Arsehole!” Harry crouched on the floor and caught his dog when it came running to him. “Oh, buddy, you’ve gotten big,” Harry scolded him playfully. “You promised you wouldn’t.”

“And you’ve gotten skinnier,” Tony huffed. He dropped Harry’s trunk in the middle of their living room then stretched his back out. “Hungry? We’ve got a couple hours until ‘revels’ are expected to start.”

Harry was starving actually, he hadn’t ate much dinner… or lunch before that… or breakfast at all.

“Sure,” he said. Harry scooped Joey up in his arms and followed Tony to the kitchen. “Where’s Pepper?”

“Hmm? Oh, she’s off in Washington lobbying for something or another,” Tony said vaguely. He opened the refrigerator and frowned at the empty contents. Harry could see just over his shoulder that there were mostly just takeout containers and bottles of water.

“Oh! I know.” Tony slammed the door shut and began digging in his pocket. “Why don’t you go grab food with Happy and pick up your geek? Bring him by for the party, meet the whole family!”

Harry eyed the wad of money Tony offered him warily.

“I’ve got money,” he hedged. In the backpack Tony had sent with him to Sirius’ he’d managed to stuff every snack food Harry had ever eaten along with a months worth of portable chargers along with a thick wad of cash, both American and British.

Ron had been as interested in the foreign snacks as Mister Weasley had been the money and chargers.

“Well here’s more,” Tony said stubbornly. “Grab me a burger or something on your way back, will you?”

“Fine.” Harry scowled and accepted the money when Tony thrust it in his face again.

“How’s the hand, by the way?”

Harry frozen and instinctively shoved his left hand in his robe pocket. “Fine,” he said evenly. It was throbbing and sore, but since Harry didn’t have anymore detentions to serve, he figured it would heal up eventually.

Tony hummed skeptically. “Mind if I see?”

“I do actually,” Harry said shortly before turning on his heel to stride away. “Bye.”

“Maybe change before you go see Lover Boy,” Tony called at Harry’s back, causing Harry to turn and veer toward his bedroom instead of the lift.

It wasn’t like he wouldn’t look like a freak showing up at Peter’s house in his Hogwarts uniform.

 

As soon as Harry changed in a pair of normal jeans and a hoodie, he went to track down Happy while Tony slipped away to his lab with Bruce.

Happy, unexpectedly, was not happy at all when Harry found him on the previously empty floor that Tony said was Thor’s.

“Sure, just move more people in,” Happy complained under his breath once they got in the lift to go down to the garage. He’d seemed relieved when Harry hesitantly interrupted an argument he’d been having with Wanda and Pietro, and Harry couldn’t help but empathize with him.

There were too many people in the Tower and Harry still had no idea who Wanda and Pietro were or why they gave Harry such intense looks when he was near them.

“Are they staying long?” Harry asked Happy.

Happy sighed and scratched his jaw before giving Harry a sideways look.

“Who knows, your dad’s always adopting strays.”

Harry raised an unimpressed brow at him. “Interesting theory to share with his adopted son.”

Happy chuckled and gestured for Harry to leave the lift when the doors opened to the garage filled with a dozen cars, each one flashier than the one before it.

“You’re not ‘adopted’,” he stressed. “You’re his son, the paperwork just got a little messed up on you when you were born.”

Harry scoffed and climbed in the passenger seat of the slick black SUV Happy drove.

“Interesting way to explain it,” Harry said drily. He fiddled with the radio dials while Happy pulled out and headed toward Peter’s house in Queens.

“Well how do you explain it?” Happy asked him.

“Kidnapping and surprise adoption.”

Happy laughed and tuned the radio to the station Harry had been looking for with a button on his steering wheel.

“Man, I bet your dad is thrilled to have you back,” he said with a grin. “God knows he needed someone to argue with.”

Harry settled back in his seat and listened as Happy filled him in on everything he’d missed in the last few weeks. He also ignored the three texts Sirius sent him in response to his single message and chose to send Peter a quick text.

Hope you like surprises.

Harry didn’t much like surprises, but he hoped Peter did.

Or, at least, Harry hoped Peter was as excited to see him as Harry was.

Chapter Text

“I don’t like this,” Bruce murmured for the tenth time since they began scanning the scepter in the lab. “I think we should tell the guys, Tony.”

Tony just barely held back from rolling his eyes.

“Bruce, do you really think any of them can even comprehend what we could be building here?” Tony asked him. “What? Thor took advanced triple integrals? No,” Tony scoffed. “They don’t understand what this could mean.”

“So we’re keeping secrets?” Bruce said. He pulled his glasses off and rubbed at his eyes. “If something goes wrong…”

“Nothing is going to go wrong,” Tony assured him. “We’re just running a diagnostic here, nothing crazy.”

“A diagnostic download,” Bruce corrected him. “You’re copying the data from the matrix in it.”

“You worry too much.” Tony pointed at Bruce while Jarvis continued downloading the information from the scepter. So far, it seemed to share some data with the magical clock that Sirius sent him, but not all of it did. It was an entirely unique matrix - something new that could be twisted to better the world. Secure the world from invasions, keep the world safe for Tony’s son to grow up in.

Bruce sighed heavily. “I worry that you don’t worry enough,” he said.

Tony jumped in a decidedly guilty way when there was a quick rap of knuckles on the lab door.

“Parties over,” Tony told Bruce. He killed the lights in the office and ushered Bruce toward the door. “We’ll have a copy of it before Thor takes off in the morning.”

Bruce muttered about ‘bad ideas’ clear to the door where Happy stood on the other side with a greasy paper bag in hand.

“Thanks,” Tony said gratefully as he pulled the door shut behind himself and accepted the food from Happy. He waited until Bruce wandered toward the elevator to crane his neck around Happy and frown at the lack of teenage boy noise.

“Where’s Harry?”

Happy flapped a vague hand toward Harry’s room. “He’s, uh… not having a great day,” he said. He huffed when Tony gave him an expectant look. “We went to pick his friend up and the aunt said he was sick. No big deal, right?”

That reminded Tony he really needed to get Harry in to see a pediatrician and dentist. Pepper was going to kick his ass when she realized he hadn’t done it yet.

“Right,” Tony agreed. “Kids have germs, they’re disgusting.”

Harry wasn’t, but he was, as usual, the exception.

“Except we circled back around because the Parker’s live in a freaking one-way maze and guess who we saw on a skateboard? Harry’s friend,” Happy said, lowering his voice like the dramatic gossip he was. His raised his brows and nodded at Tony’s surprised face. “Exactly,” he hissed. “And he didn’t look sick at all.”

Tony unwrapped the burger Happy picked up for him and chewed it thoughtfully. Peter had just been texting Harry about how much he missed him earlier in the week. Surely he hadn’t moved on quite so quickly?

Yeah, Tony would have if his boyfriend or girlfriend went off to boarding school, but Peter seemed like more of a standup guy than Tony was. And a hell of a lot more attached to Harry than Tony had ever gotten to any of his hookups at their age.

“Huh,” Tony mused. “That’s… kind of crap, honestly.”

“The kid agrees,” Happy. He shrugged his broad shoulders and frowned when he looked toward Harry’s closed door. “I think his feelings were hurt.”

“Aww,” Tony cooed at Happy and fluttered his lashes at him. “You care about his feelings, Hap? That’s sweet, really.”

Happy huffed and threw his hands in the air just as Tony expected.

“I’m out of here,” he said. “Good luck.”

“Be back in an hour for a party!” Tony called at his back. “Bring booze!”

Happy flipped him off, but Tony was pretty sure he would. Happy was a good guy, dependable and loyal. Like a dog, but with less barking and shitting in the house.

 

As soon as Happy left, Tony shoveled down the rest of the burger and wiped his hands off on his jeans before heading toward Harry’s room. His lips twitched in fond nostalgia at the heavy bass and loud music he could hear once he got outside the kid’s door.

God, Tony did not miss being a teenager even a little bit.

“Knock, knock.” Tony knocked twice then stuck his head in Harry’s room. Harry was laying on his back on his bed, his sneakers and jeans still on, the speakers blaring, somehow sound asleep. Tony smiled slightly at the way Harry always looked so young, so vulnerable, when he slept. When he slept peacefully, anyway.

Tony adjusted the volume of the decent heavy metal Harry must have kicked on before laying down, then left him to it. Kid probably had jet lag from hell after the flight home and he’d had a rough few days, Tony would just wake him up once people starting showing up for ‘revels’.

 

Thor and the wonder twins showed up first and Tony winced on the inside.

He actually didn’t care much for those two and didn’t particularly want them around Harry. Pardon him for being a skeptic, but the witch-bitch and her ability to dig in Tony’s head and pull up his worst nightmare didn’t exactly leave him chomping at the bit for her to be near his kid.

“Tony!” Thor slapped a heavy hand on Tony’s shoulders and smiled joyfully at him. “Where is your son? I’d like to talk with him!”

Tony smoothly stepped away from the God who never understood that puny humans were breakable and ignored the eager looks on the wonder twins’ faces.

“Sleeping,” he said. “Hey, by the way, keep your hands to yourself around him, huh? Harry’s not much for brotherly hugs and manly back slaps.”

Thor, big baby he was, frowned in a sad little pout while more people poured in the apartment around them.

“I give you my word that I will not lay a finger on your son,” Thor said solemnly. He cracked into a wide smile then. “Go wake him! I wish to hear tales of his battles against sorcery!”

“Dibs!” Rhodey pushed past Tony and rushed toward Harry’s room, ignoring Tony’s protests that Harry wasn’t having a super great day.

“Oh, chill,” Rhodey scolded him with a shit eating grin. “I’m his favorite uncle, he’ll be happy to see me.”

Tony threw his hands in the air when Rhodey slipped in Harry’s room and closed the door behind him.

“No, why would anyone listen to me?” he said sarcastically. “I’m just his dad, nobody important.”

“Exactly,” Natasha agreed. She’d already made herself at home behind the temporary bar Tony had set up in the dining room. “Now get your ass over here and have a drink.”

“Flattery will get you everywhere, Miss Romanoff,” Tony said. He moved away from the elevator that was still bringing guests up and decided a couple drinks wouldn’t hurt anything.

His son was home, he was thiiiis close to cracking the code on project Ultron, and his team was all together for a party.

What more could a guy ask for?

 

Tony was only a single drink deep when Rhodey and Harry came out of Harry’s room with similar looks in their eyes.

“Harry!” Clint sat beside Tony at the bar and raised his glass at Harry, drawing everyone else’s attention to him. Harry didn’t look great, still too pale and too much like the kid that Tony first met at the beginning of summer, but Rhodey was a damn miracle worker because there was a smile flitting around Harry’s lips.

Maybe it was another Stark thing- they were powerless against spicy redheads with bossy tones and couldn’t resist Rhodey’s charms.

Harry nodded at Clint and the rest of the team, he gave Thor a sideways look, but Rhodey whispered something to him that had Harry laughing and nodding at Thor more casually.

“Hey, Tony, I’m stealing your kid for a bit,” Rhodey called across the room as he and Harry edged toward the elevators.

Tony straightened up in his seat and tried to make big puppy eyes at his son.

“You’re trading me for him?” he asked with a playful pout. “C’mon, what’s Rhodey got that I don’t?”

“A functioning heart,” Rhodey said, causing the others to laugh at Tony’s expense. “Open the damn window, it’s hot in here. We’ll be back.”

Tony slumped dramatically on the bar top when Harry and Rhodey just slipped away together.

“Give me another one, I’ve just had my heart broken,” he told Natasha.

Bruce was lounging in the living room with Steve and the twins and he turned around so he could smirk at Tony and laugh.

“How many times have you been traded for Rhodey?”

“Only once before now,” Tony said truthfully. “This sorority girl told me she wanted to know if the rumors about Rhodey were true.”

Steve made a face, but his relief at a successful mission had him relaxed and just as joyful and playful as the others were.

“Were they?” he asked.

Tony pulled a surprised look off with near believability. “That Rhodey was a perfect gentleman? Of course.” Tony clicked his tongue and wagged a finger at Steve. “What rumors were you thinking of Captain Purity?”

Everyone laughed at Steve’s blush and stammer and Tony had never felt as fond of them all as he did in that moment.

With Harry home, it really was like Tony’s entire family was inside his apartment. All they needed was Pepper and Sirius and Tony thought the entire evening might be perfect.

 

“What’s big, green, and turns me on?” Natasha ran a sly finger down the front of Bruce’s shirt and Tony hid his snicker at the way Bruce’s eyes dilated past a healthy point.

“W- what?” Bruce stuttered. Poor man was no match for Natasha when she was in the mood to toy with him.

Natasha leaned across the bar and had her cleavage on full display and her lips an inch from Bruce’s while Tony and Clint clung to each other and shook with silent laughter.

Steve and Happy were in the living room with Thor and the wonder twins. And Tony had no idea what the five of them could possibly be discussing that had them all laughing, but he figured it wasn’t nearly as entertaining as seeing Natasha hit on Bruce.

“Shrek,” Natasha whispered, blowing her breath in Bruce’s face.

Bruce grinned gracefully even while his face turned red and he pushed Natasha away.

“Good one,” he said weakly. “Seriously, you should consider stand up.”

“You should consider laying down,” Natasha winked.

Clint was practically dragging Tony to the floor with him as he filled the room with his drunken laughter. Tony gave him a little shove and suddenly everyone was laughing as Clint landed on his ass.

“You’re cut off,” Natasha told him with a tsk.

“He never could handle tequila,” Steve called from the living room. “In fact—”

“INCOMING!”

Everyone’s attention moved from the drunk on the floor to the open windows as Rhodey flew in with his War Machine suit in full display and Tony’s son no where to be found.

“Hey!” Tony felt a bit of panic flutter in his chest and he quickly got to his feet. “Where’s—”

THUD!

The quick-kid was the first one to race over when something? nothing? crashed in the TV, sending sparks and glass flying, and then hit the floor with a groan.

“Oh, shit.” Rhodey’s mask was off and he was moving over by the quick-kid and the busted TV while Tony was trying to process what the fuck just happened. “You good, kid?”

Kid?

Tony’s kid?

Tony was halfway to the living room when Rhodey grasped at the air and pulled a sheet off Harry, revealing Tony’s son slumped on the floor, on top of a broomstick, and rubbing his head.

“He can fly?!” Natasha cried.

“He has mastered invisibility?” Thor was beaming. “It took Loki many years to do that!”

“What the fuck just happened?” Tony demanded. He shoved Rhodey and the quick-kid to the side to kneel down in front of Harry. “Hey, kid, you okay?”

Harry gave Tony a wry smile and winced as he probed his own head with his fingers.

“Bit of a headache.” Harry glanced up at the TV and winced again. “Er… suppose I’m two for two on owing you a telly?”

Tony sighed in relief and helped Harry to his feet without even sparing a look at the shattered flatscreen.

“Don’t worry about it,” he said. He looked from the broom that Harry reached down to grab to the purple sheet Rhodey held and the sheepish look on his best friend’s face.

“Did you take my son flying?” Tony demanded once the pieces clicked together in his head. He ushered Harry on the couch and absently pushed him to sit between the witch-bitch and Steve.

“He likes to fly!” Rhodey said defensively. “I just showed him the sights. I didn’t expect a crash landing!”

Tony tilted Harry’s head around, anxiously looking for any cuts or signs of a concussion.

“Go grab the tylenol,” Tony told Rhodey briskly. “Jesus, kid, you couldn’t wait twenty-four hours before giving me a heart attack?”

“I don’t usually crash.” Harry jerked his chin from Tony’s grasp and glared at him. “I just… er… did this time.”

“Crashing is an important step in mastering flight,” Thor said. “It’s better to get it out of the way now, Stark’s son, it will hurt your pride much worse the older you get.”

Harry stared deadpan at Thor. “I’ll keep that in mind,” he said dryly.

“Catch.” Rhodey came back in the room, sans super suit, and tossed a bottle of Tylenol and bottle of water both at Harry. Harry caught them easily and gave Rhodey a perfectly friendly grin and cheeky salute.

“I won,” Rhodey said smugly while Harry swallowed two tablets.

“You fucking cheated!” Harry told him hotly.

“Says the invisible boy,” Rhodey snorted.

Harry threw the bottle of Tylenol at Rhodey and then nodded toward the TV. The two of them were in their own little world and Tony wished he’d been invited to go flying with his son…

“You said ‘let’s race’, you replace it,” Harry told Rhodey.

Rhodey whipped his phone from his pocket, pressed a few buttons, then pocketed it again.

“Done,” he said smugly. “It’ll be here tomorrow.”

Harry gaped at him for a brief moment before blinking and scowling.

“You all have too much bloody money,” he muttered like it was a sin.

“Uh… can we get back to the invisible thing?” Natasha said. She snagged the purple sheet from Rhodey and held it up. “What is this?”

“Hey!” Harry’s face turned pale and he jumped to his feet. “Don’t touch that, it’s—”

“Here.”

Tony hadn’t done anything more than blink and the quick-kid had raced to Natasha, snatched the purple sheet, and brought it back to Harry with a smirk.

Harry squinted with the same suspicion toward the quick-kid that Tony had, but he quickly grabbed the sheet and held it just as tightly as he did his broom.

“Is that Sirius’ invisible sheet?” Tony asked, equal parts curious and desperate to break the tension filling the room.

“Hm?” Harry looked away from quick-kid and up toward Tony. “Oh, it’s my Invisibility Cloak, Sirius was borrowing it, but he lost privileges.”

“How does it work?” Witch-bitch asked with round eyes.

Harry gave her Tony’s own patented ‘did you go to community college?’ look.

“It’s an invisibility cloak,” Harry said, speaking mockingly slow at her. “I’ll give you two guesses how it works.”

“Can I try it?” Clint asked, finally getting off the floor and joining the group in the living room.

“No.” Harry must have realized he was the center of everyone’s attention because he started edging toward his room with the cloak stuffed behind his back. “I’ll just… put this up…”

Tony shooed everyone away when Harry slipped in his room to put up his cloak and broomstick.

“Let him breathe, Jesus, guys,” he said. “And don’t touch his stuff again,” he warned Natasha.

“Oh, don’t take it personal, it was James Potter’s cloak,” Rhodey said. He walked over to the bar and grabbed a handful of crackers, missing Tony’s surprised look.

“How do you know that?” Tony asked, he didn’t whine, he wasn’t whining, but…

But Harry told Sirius about his teacher and he told Rhodey about his cloak and Harry never told Tony anything.

“He told me,” Rhodey shrugged. “Don’t give me that look, Tony, the kid’s an open book up in the air.”

“Noted,” Tony said sullenly. He sat down in his barstool with his arms crossed, watching Harry’s door and waiting for him to come out.

“Hey,” Rhodey touched Tony’s shoulder and gave him an apologetic smile, “I think he’s happy to be back, if it counts for anything.”

It counted for everything.

“Invite me next time,” Tony told him petulantly. “I want to see him fly.”

Tony would love to fly in the skies with his son. He could take him on the best tour of the city and they could talk and bond and Harry would tell Tony things he told other people. More things even, better things.

They could be just as close as Tony used to wish he’d been with Howard.

“Will do,” Rhodey winked just as Harry’s door opened back up and Harry slipped out of it. “Hey, kid, let’s grab some chow.”

“Yes!” Thor leapt to his feet and threw a fist in the air. “Let us feast and hear stories!”

Harry gave Tony an exasperated look and Tony just shrugged. If Harry wanted to swap stories about magic with Thor, Tony’d be glad to hear them.

Hell, if Harry wanted to talk at all, Tony would be glad to hear it.

 

It started slow. Everyone settled in the living room with plates of pasta that had been catered for the get-together and glasses of wine. Bruce had rolled his eyes when Tony slid Harry a half-full glass, but Tony had been drinking much worse than wine at Harry’s age. And Harry hadn’t touched it after taking a single sip and pulling a quick face of disgust.

Harry sat in a chair he’d pulled up in front of his door, as far from the others as he could get, and listened to Thor describe Loki’s magic while he picked at his food and dropped bits of meatball down to his dog. He gave quick-kid another slightly less suspicious look when he joined in on throwing the dog table scraps with his own chunks of chicken.

“Certainly you’ve experienced mishaps and mayhem as well?” Thor asked Harry at one point after talking about something his brother had done that Tony hadn’t really listened to. “Magic is a mysterious Mistress, and only the truly gifted can wield her.”

Harry shrugged and rolled his eyes at Thor’s eager look.

“I think mishaps can happen to anyone,” Harry said with a bit of snark. “My friend Hermione’s a genius and she turned herself into a cat once.”

Tony chuckled when he pictured the prissy looking girl who’d stared at Tony with hero worship in the castle.

“How?” he asked Harry. “Sirius said animagus transformations are hard as hell.”

Harry smirked and put his hardly touched plate on the floor, giving the dog full access to it.

“Sirius just likes to brag,” he said. “And it wasn’t an animagus transformation, it was Polyjuice.”

Tony the others listened with rapt attention as Harry slowly talked about brewing an advanced and heavily monitored potion when he was twelve (like father, like son, Tony thought fondly) with his friends. With a few more prodding questions, Harry told them about a basilisk in the walls and a hidden chamber where his friend’s sister was taken.

“And then what happened? Did the girl die?” Witch-bitch asked quickly when Harry’s story tapered off after Ron’s sister was left for dead.

“And then I got a sword from a magic hat, stuck it in the snake, and nearly died for my efforts,” Harry said flatly. “Not much of a fun story.”

“It is the most fun story!” Thor protested immediately while Tony did the math on how big the snake had to be if a single fang left a fist sized puncture wound in Harry’s arm.

Sometimes it was a curse being a genius.

“You slayed the beast, saved the damsel, and future generations will sing your praises!” Thor told Harry. “You would have been gifted with armor on Asgard for your heroic actions!”

Instead of looking happy at all, Harry’s face flushed with irritation before he ducked his head. When he lifted it, it was blank, but Tony saw it.

The kid might be a little Tony in looks, but damn if his self-esteem wasn’t shot to hell.

“Yeah, yeah, the kid’s a little Avenger in the making,” Clint said, waving a hand impatiently. “When can I try the flying broomstick?”

Harry raised a brow at Clint. “Never,” he said coolly.

“And Harry already has a team of superheroes,” Tony reminded Clint. He winked at Harry, “The AA, right?”

Harry clamped his jaw shut and Tony saw a tick go through it while he tried to figure out how he’d messed up again…

Damn.

That had been a joke between Harry and Peter.

“What is the AA?” quick-kid asked Harry, diverting the attention from where Tony had stuck his foot in his mouth again.

“Anti Avengers,” Harry told him. “I’d offer you an invite, but frankly I don’t understand why you’re even here.”

The witch leaned toward eagerly and smiled at Harry sweetly, as if she weren’t a demon.

“I also have magic,” she said. She held her palms out and Tony wasn’t the only one instantly on edge by the glowing red light in them. “I believe you and I are the same.”

Harry looked at her hands then over at the quick-kid and up at Thor’s wide smile.

“I doubt that,” he drawled. “For one, my hands aren’t a portable nightlight, and two, if nobody showed up at your doorstep when you were eleven and called you a witch, then that’s not the same magic I have.”

“We were in captivity when we were eleven,” quick-kid said smoothly while his sister’s face crumpled with disappointment. “Perhaps they tried and were unsuccessful in finding her?”

Harry hummed with obvious skepticism. “Or you’re about a magical as that bloody hammer,” he said with a glance towards Thor’s hammer that never left his side.

“Mjölnir is more than magic!” Thor said. He lifted the hammer for everyone to see. “She is a gift from my father and his father’s before him! Only the most worthy are granted her blessing to carry.”

Clint scoffed. “Don’t listen to him, kid, that’s just some mythological bullshit.”

“Oh?” Thor placed the hammer in the center of the coffee table. He waved a hand toward it regally. “Please, by my guest.”

Clint looked around at everyone else’s amused looks and started rolling his sleeves up.

“Alright,” he said. He moved over to the table and grasped the handle tightly. “Just call me— ugh.”

Tony grinned while Clint tried to lift the hammer from the table.

“Put your back into it,” Tony jeered when Clint propped a foot on the table to try and yank harder. “Come on, Barton, it’s just bullshit.”

Clint huffed and leapt nimbly away from the hammer. “You try it then, smartass.”

Tony would have turned it down, he didn’t really want mocked like Clint was, but he couldn’t turn a challenge down in front of his son either.

“Fine.” Tony stood up and held a single hand over the handle the sparked beneath his fingertips. He smirked at Thor, “I can rule Asgard as soon as I lift this, right?”

“Oh yeah,” Thor nodded seriously. “It’s all yours.”

“Great.” Tony winked at Harry, “I hope you’re ready to be a prince.”

Tony grunted when he pulled on the hammer and the damn thing didn’t even twitch.

“One moment,” he said while the others openly laughed at him. He shot another grin off at Harry before darting off to snag his wrist cuff and return with his Iron Man gloves and blasters in place.

“Let’s try this again.”

Tony couldn’t move it even with the extra power. He cajoled Rhodey into helping him with his gloves and still nothing.

“Bad technology,” Tony told Harry breathlessly when he collapsed on the ground beside him and Clint was pestering Steve into trying.

“Or it’s a magic thing,” Harry said, which might have been the nicest thing Harry had ever said to him. Not including the time he called Tony dad and then immediately changed his mind.

“A magic thing? You give it a go then, wizard boy,” Natasha taunted Harry after Steve failed to lift the hammer.

“If it works, we move to Asgard,” Tony grinned.

“Brilliant. My first order as king will be letting Loki free,” Harry said. He didn’t even stand up, he just reached across the table with his right arm and gave the hammer a light tug. Tony bit his lip when Harry frowned and stood up to try again.

“What the fuck?” Harry scowled. He gripped the hammer more firmly and gave it another harsh tug. “I’m not letting some stupid magical tool call me unworthy,” he snarled.

Tony had been laughing on the inside as Harry’s competitive side came out.

All the way up until Harry pulled his left hand from his sleeve to grab the hammer’s handle and Tony caught sight of red cuts across the back of his hand.

Those weren’t scars, as Sirius had implied, they were still bleeding!

“Are you kidding?” Tony lunged forward and grabbed Harry’s wrist before Harry could pull away and he held his hand up so he could see the cuts more clearly.

There, across the back of Harry’s hand, were the words: ‘I must not tell lies’ in Harry’s own handwriting.

Tony’s blood ran cold while his pulse had never beat so furiously. He felt like he really was suffering from a stroke. He couldn’t even think straight—

How dare she?!

—until Harry yanked his wrist away and left Tony’s empty hand dangling in between them.

“Don’t touch me,” Harry snapped. His face was a dark red and his eyes were glowing angrily. Harry looked around at the suddenly silent and solemn group before he slid his hand back in the sleeve of his hoodie and backed away from Tony quickly.

“This has been super fun, goodnight,” Harry said curtly before he snatched his dog from the floor and quietly locked himself in his room.

Tony was still standing frozen in a mixture of shock and absolute unfiltered rage.

“Nat, get the jet,” he said. “I’m going to kill her.”

“Oh gladly,” Natasha said, swiftly getting off the chair she’d been lounging across.

“Tony, hold up, don’t be hasty,” Rhodey said. He reached out to out a calming hand on Tony’s shoulder, but Tony wasn’t in the mood to be calmed.

He was in the mood to carve the skin from the woman who fucked with his son. He finally understood why Sirius had been ready to kill her.

It was one thing to imagine some vague little scar on Harry’s hand, it was another thing altogether to see the infected and bloody cuts that had been gouged in Harry’s hand.

“Oh, this isn’t hasty,” Tony said with deadly calm as he sidestepped away from Rhodey’s grasp. “My lawyers will call it premeditated.”

“Why would you leave behind a body for your lawyers to discover?” Quick-kid asked with a lazy smirk. “No evidence, no crime.”

“Precisely.” Tony pointed at him and nodded, “You’re on mission murder. Let’s go.”

Rhodey and Bruce were still making feeble objections that Tony was ignoring in favor of quick plans when a clattering sound from the hall outside Tony’s office drew their attention.

Slowly… with everyone’s eyes peeled on the hallway and Tony’s mind was filled with wizards who could pop in and out of anywhere they pleased… one of Tony’s scrapped legionnaires drug itself into view, mumbling to itself…

“Murder… murder…”

The legionnnaire stopped and assessed the group that was on their feet, muscles tensed, confused by its presence.

“You’re all murderers,” it said, waving an arm around. “Killers, murderers.”

Notes:

    Since canon in both worlds has been tossed in the garbage and caught on fire… here’s what everyone else is up to:
    Loki- not dead, sorry, he’s just locked up in Asgard for his actions in 2012 Avengers.
    Dr Strange- all finished with magic school, just chilling in NY protecting the stone and being chill.
    Bucky- in hiding, trying to avoid capture and work away the triggers. Steve & Nat know he’s alive, nobody else does.
    Clint- I’ve erased the wife and kids, sorry guys.
    Vision- who’s that?
    I think that’s it… if you have any questions, I answer much quicker on discord, but feel free to ask in the comments too.

Chapter Text

Harry was furious and embarrassed and his stomach flipped with shame until he tilted his head down and everything he’d managed to eat for dinner came right back up and slowly went down the drain with the hot water and proof of Harry’s embarrassment.

The water stung as it rinsed over his left hand, but Harry ignored it as his eyes stung much worse.

It felt like the longest day in history.

Harry left Hogwarts - left his friends behind in a war he started.

Tony made you leave. You didn’t have a choice.

Even so, having the proof of his own damned cowardly weakness brandished in front of a room full to the brim of people brave enough to stand and fight for others didn’t exactly feel great.

And… and there was Peter, but Harry was trying not to think of him.

And Sirius, who Harry was also trying not think of.

Except Harry’s mind was a worse traitor than Sirius was and kept circling back to them.

He didn’t understand why Sirius would immediately betray Harry’s confidences when Harry had always held his. He didn’t understand why Peter told his aunt he was sick when he’d looked fine - better than fine - when they saw him behind a building a few blocks from his house.

Harry was beginning to think he understood nothing and would always feel like he was drowning as he tried to figure out everyone’s motives for everything they did.

 

Not only was it the longest day in history, but it was definitely top ten for worst days as well.

 

Once Harry felt as clean as he could feel, considering his insides were shriveled and coated in shame, he wrapped a loose towel around his waist. He’d no more than grabbed another towel to dry his hair when the bathroom door was thrown open and a very wet and half-naked Harry was faced with a very cold and mechanical Rhodey.

“What the fuck?!” Harry yelped. He, rather stupidly, used the second towel to cover his chest and backed up until he stumbled into the toilet and sat down on the closed lid. “GET OUT!” he yelled.

Harry liked Rhodey well enough, he was funny and a nice guy who decided that flying would cheer Harry right up, but Harry didn’t expect that to turn into chats in the loo when he was starkers.

Rhodey’s face was hidden behind his mask, but Harry reckoned he sensed a bit of embarrassment in his voice when he finally spoke.

“Grab your cloak and broom, let’s go,” he ordered. “Come on, quick.”

“Are you mad?!” Harry yelled. He could tell there was an undercurrent of something in Rhodey’s flat robot voice, but as Harry was the naked teenage boy, he ignored it.

“He did say quickly.” Pietro dashed in the bathroom with Harry’s broom and cloak in hand, even though Harry definitely didn’t give him permission to go rifling through his trunk.

Harry couldn’t even properly begin a tirade before the cloak was tossed over his head and the broom shoved in his hand.

“Come on, Harry,” Rhodey urged him. “I’ll explain while we go, but we need to go.”

Harry moved on autopilot as Pietro all but shoved him, causing him to snarl in irritation, out of the bathroom and toward the finally opened windows in his bedroom.

“Wait! What’s going on?” Harry saw the uneasy look on Pietro’s face and recognized the urgency that Rhodey was moving with. Something was wrong, something major, something dangerous.

“Experiment gone wrong,” Pietro quipped. “See you soon, Wizard Boy.”

Rhodey flew out the window with little jets blasting through his boots and Harry couldn’t even turn his head to yell for Tony before Pietro gave him a harsh shove.

 

Oh Harry was absolutely going to blast a hole through Pietro’s head when he got back.

 

As it was, it was all Harry could do to wrangle his broom beneath his body while keeping the cloak on and cursing his lack of pants. If anyone had ever tried to purposefully ride a broom in the nude, they were completely mad.

Harry grit his teeth against the discomfort and leaned forward to catch himself out of the plummet and shoot after Rhodey. Rhodey wasn’t flying for fun, as he had when they took a leisurely fly earlier, but was fleeing and kept twisting his head to check if Harry was fleeing with him.

Apparently heat sensors built in the lifeless masks could sense Harry, even if they couldn’t see him.

“Where are we going?” Harry hissed when he caught up beside Rhodey. “And what the hell is happening?”

Rhodey’s voice was just loud enough that Harry could hear it over the wind that whipped past them. It was bloody cold out too and the cloak was good for invisibility, not warmth.

“Long story short- your dad made a super robot, they were trying to dismantle it and he told me to get you out while they did it,” Rhodey told him. That didn’t really sound too dangerous to Harry, considering Tony made robots rather often. Harry’s worry that he’d left Tony behind with something dangerous diminished slightly and he felt his breath come easier.

“Do you want to grab a milkshake or something while we wait?” Rhodey asked. “My treat.”

Harry blinked incredulously at him and then remembered Rhodey couldn’t see his face.

“No!” Harry shouted hotly. “I don’t want a bloody milkshake, I am fucking NAKED!”

Rhodey chuckled and continued flying in a straight path away from the Tower and toward the city lights.

“I forgot,” he admitted shamelessly. It was easy for Rhodey to forget, he wasn’t the one straddling a broomstick with only a towel around his waist. “Follow me,” he ordered before tilting downward and flying directly toward the ground.

Harry cursed Rhodey out clear to the ground. Stupid Avenger with his stupid suit and his warmth and his lack of a broom and a cloak being his only cover. Stupid Pietro and his stupid hands digging through Harry’s trunk and shoving him out windows.

Stupid windows.

Stupid life.

By the time they’d hit the ground, Harry had moved on to vilifying Tony and his stupid robots. Stupid genius parent with his stupid protective streak when Harry didn’t need protected from a robot anymore than he’d needed protected from Umbridge.

“Hang tight,” Rhodey told Harry quietly beneath the gasps and cries from the New Yorkers who were taking a million photos of Rhodey with their cameras. “I’ll be right back.”

Harry scowled and backed against the alley mouth when Rhodey strode away in full iron suit to a nearby tourist shop. He held his Firebolt tightly, wishing he’d grabbed his wand.

Or pants.

They were equal desires at that point.

Rhodey wasn’t gone long, and he returned with a plastic bag bulging with clothes.

“I guessed at your sizes,” he said, shoving the bag toward Harry who grabbed it gratefully. “They didn’t sell boxers, but I grabbed some sweats.”

Harry murmured a quiet thanks and leaned his broom against the wall so he could jump around and pull on the baggy blue sweat pants and matching hoodie without knocking his cloak off him. Once he finished and stuffed the towels in the bag, Rhodey was speaking in his mask.

“Clear, we’ll head back,” he said. He turned to where Harry stood, quietly and curiously waiting to hear what had happened, and nodded. “Ready?”

Harry sighed. They’d been gone for less than ten minutes. He was fairly certain that shoving him out a window in the nude had been more than a bit of an overreaction, but he agreed to fly back all the same.

 

And ten minutes had apparently been enough time for a fight to have broken out and Tony’s sitting room to get trashed.

Harry’s jaw dropped at the massive amounts of damage done to the flat when they flew through the open windows. What was a busted telly when the furniture had been flipped and the table was in splinters and some of the windows were shattered?

“Damn,” Rhodey muttered as he too took in the mess. “Tony and his brilliant ideas…”

Harry gave him a sharp look that the man missed as they edged around the mess and moved toward Tony’s lab where raised voices could be heard.

Rhodey kept his suit on, though he dropped the mask, and Harry laid his cloak and broom against the wall before they opened the door and Harry’s blood was immediately boiling.

Thor had Tony held by his neck up against the wall and was screaming in his face. And the rest of the so-called ‘heroes’ were doing nothing but watching.

“Oi!” Harry grabbed the first thing he could, a metal wrench just inside the door, and chucked it at Thor’s head. “Put him down!”

Thor deflected the wrench with nothing more than a lazy wave of his hand, and he dropped Tony and let him land on shaky legs, but he didn’t stop glaring in Tony’s face.

“You are a fool,” Thor snarled. “You have no idea what things you meddle with!”

Harry looked over toward Rhodey, but he didn’t look very worried about the massive God snarling in Tony’s face. Rhodey was frowning and moving over to stand by the others who all had their arms crossed and variously displeased expressions on their faces. Except for Pietro, who was smirking, and Bruce, who was worrying his lower lip and rubbing his eyes.

Which left Harry to square his shoulders and insert himself beside Tony and scowl up at the God. His heart was hammering in his chest and his blood was singing with the idea of a fight, something to do, someone to scream at. Someone to take a swing at Harry and let Harry release some of the frustration that was always burning through his veins.

“Back the fuck up,” Harry hissed furiously. Thor’s eyes flickered to Harry for a split-second before he took a deep breath and backed up enough that Harry could look over at Tony.

Tony looked upset with the lines around his mouth, pronouncing his deep frown, but there was a glimmer of something warm in the back of his brown eyes when he caught Harry looking at him.

“Why are you wearing a tacky tourist hoodie?” he asked, causing Harry to look down at the sweater Rhodey had gotten him.

It was blue, like the sweatpants, but it had a photo of Stark Tower across the front that had Harry scowling over at a quietly laughing Rhodey.

“Why did you trash the sitting room?” Harry asked instead. He turned enough so he could keep an eye on the others while focusing on Tony and waiting for an explanation that rationalized having one of his friends burst in his loo and then push Harry out a window.

“That wasn’t Tony, that was his project,” Steve said furiously from beside the window across the room. “His project which is now on the loose and ready to destroy the world.”

Harry raised interested brows at Steve’s short tirade. Tony didn’t seem like the evil genius sort, but clearly Harry had misjudged him. Or, what Harry actually suspected, was Steve was an idiot. Either way, Tony hadn’t lied to Harry before, so he waited for him to explain rather than one of the fuming Avenger’s.

“It’s a bit complicated,” Tony hedged as his eyes skirted over Harry’s and stared sightlessly at the wall over his shoulder. “Ultron was meant to be a shield to protect the earth, a super-powered shield that would keep invaders away…”

Harry listened and tried to focus on Tony’s brief explanation, but a lot of the scientific terms went right over his head. He summarized the gist of what he did understand once Tony finished though.

“So it’s a robot that thinks humanity is the thing the earth needs protected from?” Harry asked with a pinch of his brows. It was a familiar sentiment to Harry, one that he figured Voldemort shared. ‘Ultron’ wanted to destroy the human race, Voldemort wanted to destroy muggles.

Harry didn’t know why the concept of ‘live and let live’ was so bloody difficult for everyone else to pick up.

A surge of emotion swelled in Harry’s chest when he remembered who had first said that phrase to him.

Sirius.

“In very basic terms, yes,” Bruce told Harry.

Harry looked around the room and wondered if he was the only one who was seeing the obvious answer. Maybe it was because Sirius was already on his mind, or maybe it was because they were all busy blaming Tony for accidentally making an evil robot, but surely Harry wasn’t the only one seeing a way to end it.

“So call your best mate, have him come hit the robot with some spells or grab it and apparate, and magic’ll destroy it, right?” Harry told Tony slowly. “Like my phone that one time?”

Tony grimaced and glanced toward a staff with a green glowing end, the staff that Thor’s brother Loki had used in the video Harry watched of them.

“There is a… 94% chance that Ultron is ‘magic proof’,” Tony said without looking at Harry. “My arc reactor,” he tapped his glowing chest, “this Tower,” he waved a hand around idly, “all my tech is based on a Tesseract which is powered by almost the same thing that powers that,” he nodded toward the staff.

“Which was never yours to play with!” Thor thundered. “You meddled with forces you cannot control and this is the result!”

“Bruce did too!” Harry told him loudly, pointing toward where Bruce stood staring at a screen made of electronic mist. “Why isn’t anyone pissed off at him?!”

Harry liked Bruce, but he liked Tony a lot more. And it was bollocks that they were all glaring at Tony like Bruce hadn’t admitted to helping him sneak off with the staff to study it.

“Because Tony is the one who refused to fill the rest of us in on his project,” Steve said cooly as he glared daggers at Harry’s father.

“And you never keep things to yourself, ever?” Harry asked since apparently Tony wasn’t going to defend himself against baseless accusations. “It wasn’t like he was trying to make an evil robot, maybe you lot acting like fucking prats is why it decided humanity sucks,” Harry added spitefully, missing Steve’s tiny twitch at his accusation over keeping secrets.

“The kid’s right,” Clint said abruptly. “Fighting over whose fault it is isn’t going to end it any quicker.”

It wasn’t an apology, but Tony perked up anyway.

“You’re right,” he agreed quickly. “Why don’t we all grab a couple hours of shut eye then tackle this first thing in the morning? I can have JARVIS track any odd surges in the meantime and we should be able to find Ultron easy.”

Harry drifted to the background while they began making plans and discussing tactics that he didn’t understand. Harry slumped down on Tony’s stool with the wheels on it and scooted around a little and tried to follow the conversation that was quickly getting too technical to understand.

“You will not be joining us?”

Harry blinked and then scowled tiredly at Pietro who was now leaning against the counter beside Harry with his arms crossed and his lips curled in a half-grin.

“Course I am,” Harry said stoutly. This was his opportunity to show Tony that he could be like him. He could help him and be just as brave as Tony was.

It would finally give Harry an opening to start to earn the life he had. He didn’t care what Sirius said about not having to earn love - nothing came for free, not for Harry. And Sirius was usually right about things, but Sirius understood love just as much as Harry did.

Not at all really. But Sirius probably understood it even less than Harry, so he didn’t have great advice on the matter.

“You’re not coming.”

Harry turned his scowl toward Tony who was drawing something on an electronic map filled with millions of blinking lights.

“Why not?” Harry asked harshly. “I can help.”

Psycho snorted, which had Harry curling his hands into irritated fists in his sweater pocket.

“You’re fifteen, you stay here,” Tony said distractedly as he continued using his finger to draw connections between the blinking lights. “I’ll be gone two days, max.”

Harry’s jaw dropped and he had to quickly snap it closed as everyone was watching him.

“I can help,” Harry repeated. He got to his feet and tried to stand tall, like a man. “Let me come.”

Tony looked away from the map and frowned at Harry. “Kid, you can’t,” he said in a pitying way that Harry didn’t appreciate at all. “This is dangerous.”

“I’ve been in dangerous situations before,” Harry insisted. He crossed his arms and squared his shoulders. “I want to help.”

“You can help by staying out of the way,” Psycho said, as if Harry would listen to anything she said.

“I will stay behind with Harry,” Wanda offered swiftly. She stepped forward with a smile toward Harry.

Tony turned and must have given Wanda some sort of look that had her stepping right back against the wall.

“Nat can stay with Harry,” he told her sharply.

“Nat bloody well cannot,” Harry said. If he couldn’t go, then he wouldn’t be stuck behind with a babysitter either. “I’m perfectly able to stay here alone.”

Tony pinched the bridge of his nose when Harry began bickering with Psycho and Wanda over his ability to stay home alone.

“Enough!” Tony barked. He pointed at Pietro and quirked a brow. “Can you stay here? Call me if there’s any problems?”

Pietro smirked smugly. “I can.”

“Great.”

“You’re going to trust him with your kid?” Clint asked disbelievingly. “He was trying to kill us a few hours ago!”

Harry furrowed his brows. He’d been under the impression that Pietro and his sister were new members of the Avengers Team…

Tony shrugged and went back to drawing on the map with his finger. “He was on team murder, I think he can keep an eye on things for a couple of days.”

Harry gave Tony a look both betrayed and furious and then scowled at Pietro.

“He pushed me out of the fucking window,” Harry informed Tony. “I’d rather have Wanda.”

“Wanda gives out headaches, so she goes with us,” Tony murmured. He frowned at the map for a moment then shook his head. “Sorry, kid, time to make new friends.”

Harry was halfway out of the lab when he heard Tony yelp.

“Did he say you pushed him out a window?!”

 

As soon as Harry had his broom and cloak safely put away once more, he threw himself on his bed and pulled his phone out. Earlier, he had ignored Sirius and text Peter, this time he ignored Peter to text Sirius.

I’m still mad at you. How soon can you get to the US?

To Sirius’ credit, he was quick to reply even with the time difference that Harry was too tired to puzzle out.

Depends on if I have Tony’s posh jet. Why?

Tony’s going to hunt an evil robot. He’s leaving me with a bloke that shoved me out a window.

Sirius sent back a picture of a robot then a dog emoji and before Harry could even begin to roll his eyes, a message from Tony popped up on his phone.

I’ll have the jet in London in five hours to get Sirius.

Harry’s brief moment of deep gratitude was washed away as he blinked slowly at his phone.

Chapter Text

Harry fidgeted anxiously with the cuff of his jacket and peeked over at Tony again. They were on the roof of the Tower, waiting for the jet to land with Sirius so Tony and his team could take off to capture the evil robot bloke. The others waited closer to the doors, their faces stony as they waited to take off on their trip.

Pietro smirked at Harry when he caught his eye, so Harry scowled and turned back to Tony.

“You planning on coming home or should I learn to run a company quickly?” Harry asked, masking his concern behind sarcasm.

Tony ran a hand through his dark hair and gave Harry a wry smile. “Oh this’ll be cake, kid, no sweat.”

“Then I can go?” Harry asked quickly.

Tony chuckled and shook a finger at Harry. “Nice try. You hang out with your godfather and Usain Bolt. Try and keep them from destroying our place, huh?”

Harry crinkled his nose and glared down at his trainers. Either it was so simple that Harry should be able to go or it was dangerous enough that Harry would rather Pietro take Tony’s place. It was selfish, since Tony was much more of an asset against the robot he technically built, but Harry would rather be selfish than be an orphan once more.

“Here he comes,” Tony said cheerfully as the large black jet came into view in the sky. Tony smiled over at Harry and Harry wished he had Tony’s never-ending confidence. “This’ll be fine, kid, you’ll see. I’ll be back by Monday and we’ll go get you enrolled at Midtown.”

Harry’s shoulders slumped and he inched closer to Tony as the jet began to whip wind around wildly while it descended on the roof.

“Be safe,” Harry murmured quietly, unsure if Tony could even hear him.

Tony grinned and put his arm around Harry’s shoulders slowly. “I will.”

The instant the jet doors opened, Sirius came barreling down the short ramp.

“Harry!” Sirius was dressed down with a grey hoodie beneath his leather jacket and a pair of jeans on, but the smile on his face was the same one that he always had for Harry.

Even when Harry had a few words about keeping secrets for his godfather.

“Sirius.” Harry stepped forward, out of Tony’s loose embrace, and let Sirius hug him briefly. Sirius was… well, he was everything to Harry. Even when Harry was pissed at him, there was something in his chest missing when Sirius wasn’t around.

It was part concern, since Sirius was a cocky bastard who didn’t take his safety seriously, but it was also… also just things were better with Sirius.

“Who’s the new weirdos?” Sirius whispered to Harry before he released him, his grey eyes wary when they landed on Pietro and Wanda.

Harry snorted, “Avengers, apparently. How’d you escape?”

Sirius slapped Tony on the shoulder as a greeting and laughed brightly.

“I grabbed a few bottles of whisky then slammed my door. Buckbeak’s in charge of storming around and making it seem like I’m home.”

That was the problem, Sirius said that as if it were a foolproof plan, and it all hinged on a hippogriff. A hippogriff that was rather intelligent, but still, Sirius was an idiot at times.

Harry kept silent though as Tony did a brief introduction between Sirius, Pietro, and Wanda and then ushered his team on the jet.

“You’re in charge,” Tony told Harry airily. “Have fun, order a bunch of junk food, do something interesting.”

Harry, impulsively, hugged Tony quickly before stepping backward with Sirius and Pietro.

“No wormholes,” Harry called to Tony.

Tony lifted his hand before he stepped on the jet. “No dragons,” he called back.

Harry smirked and flipped him off and Tony flipped him right back off before he climbed on and the runway closed behind him.

“I’ve got a ton of Polyjuice and a fistful of pink hair,” Sirius announced as he bounced on the balls of his feet and grinned at Harry. “You said there’s a garage full of cars here, right?”

Harry squinted at him suspiciously. “Yes…”

“Any motorcycles?”

 

There were in fact half a dozen motorcycles in the garage, but Sirius got distracted by a bright yellow flashy car that Pietro called a Lamborghini.

“How much do you reckon this cost?” Sirius breathed, running his hand down the side of the car lovingly.

“A fortune,” Pietro drawled. He dashed off quickly and returned in an instant with a set of keys dangling. “Anyone know how to drive?”

Harry looked at Sirius, Sirius looked at Harry, Pietro laughed.

“Dibs!” Sirius cried. He snatched the keys from Pietro and paused long enough to swallow some Polyjuice from a flask. Harry smirked at Pietro’s wide eyes when Sirius abruptly turned into Tonks.

“What is that?” Pietro asked in an awestruck tone.

“Magic,” Harry told him curtly. He moved to the passenger seat before Pietro could take it and quoted something he’d heard Pepper say before. “Shotgun.”

Sirius laughed brightly and Harry wished Sirius could always look so happy.

… and maybe less like Tonks.

 

Harry’s phone dinged and a photo of Peter popped up from where Harry had it connected to the radio.

“Are you not going to answer?” Sirius asked as he took a turn at a speed that had Pietro laughing and Harry clutching the dash and door hard enough to make his knuckles ache.

“I’ll call him later,” Harry grit out when Sirius ran a red light. “Oi! Did you know Tony reads my fucking texts?”

It was hard to read Sirius’ expressions on Tonks’ face, but Harry thought the way Sirius hummed and turned up the radio a bit telling.

Harry hadn’t talked to Peter since the day before when he text him about having a surprise and never got a proper reply. But Harry wasn’t going to chat about it if Tony could read their messages.

Merlin.

They’d sent each other all sorts of ridiculous texts when Harry had been at Hogwarts. Harry felt his face burn when he thought about some of the things they’d said.

Tony was bloody mad.

Pietro leaned forward, sticking his face between Harry and Sirius’. The wind snapped his peculiar silver hair in Harry’s face and made him sputter and Pietro to chuckle.

“Where are we going?” Pietro asked in his odd accented drawl.

Harry turned to Sirius, also curious about their destination. So far all they’d done is run the car out of gas and look like idiots as they tried to fuel it back up with Harry’s bank card.

Apparently Pietro spent most his life being experimented on - a story that made Harry blanch. Sirius didn’t use fuel in his bike. And Harry had never operated a pump before, he’d only ever seen Pepper and Happy do it.

Luckily, a nice looking lady with two little kids had taken pity on them and taught Harry how to swipe his card and get the fuel to work. She’d shook her head and called them tourists, but they probably looked pretty stupid so Harry didn’t dispute it. But that had been half a tank ago, and Sirius didn’t seem inclined to stop anytime soon.

“I’m trying to find Landfara Way,” Sirius explained. “I think the entrance is over by the government building, but I can’t remember exactly where that’s at.”

Harry rolled his eyes. Poor Sirius and his lack of technology.

“Hey, JARVIS?”

“Yes, Harry?”

“Can you pull up a map to get to the MACUSA building? Er, Tony and I went there before.”

“Of course. Directions should be displayed now.”

“Wicked!” Sirius laughed when the map popped up on the radio screen. “We’re only ten minutes away!”

“The way you drive? We will be there in five minutes,” Pietro smirked.

It didn’t take five minutes, despite Sirius’ speeding. It took them thirty-seven minutes because Sirius got pulled over. The stupid prat probably would have gotten a ticket if Harry hadn’t hastily shown his ID when the police officer began to wonder why they were in a car registered to Tony Stark.

“Perks of fame,” Sirius laughed when the officer didn’t write ‘the friend of Tony Stark’s son’ a ticket for speeding or not having the license Sirius definitely didn’t own on him.

Harry scowled and ignored Sirius and Pietro’s jokes for the rest of the drive. It was mildly less embarrassing to be recognized as Iron Man’s son than it was the Boy-Who-Lived, but not by much.

 

“Ladies and gentlemen, wizard and super powered bloke who should pretend to be a wizard, welcome to Landfara Way!” Sirius tapped his wand to the stone archway in the alley behind the government building where the President worked and Pietro made a sound of appreciation as the stones shimmered and the three of them stepped through.

It was as different from Diagon Alley as Tony’s house was to Hogwarts. Where Diagon Alley had been cobblestones and old fashioned shops, Landfara Way looked more like the muggle outlet malls Harry went to with Pepper.

All up and down the paved roads, there were modern looking shopfronts with flashing signs that advertised their services. There was the Big Apple Apothecary, Blooming’s Brooms, Wondrous Wardrobe Essentials, and dozens more.

“Amazing,” Pietro murmured as he quickly ducked to avoid the giggling children racing just above their heads on toy brooms. “This is all real?”

“Nope. You’re dreaming,” Harry quipped. He gave Pietro a bland smile, “Maybe you fell out a fucking window and cracked your head on the ground.”

Pietro smirked at Harry and then gestured grandly toward the rows of shops.

“Educate me then, Wizard Boy,” he said in a low drawl with a sparkle in his eyes.

“I’d love to,” Sirius sniffed haughtily, inserting himself in the conversation. “Come on, let’s see if we can’t piss away a fortune.”

 

And they made a good go of it.

 

Sirius filled three bags full of trick sweets and magical joke items in Jolly’s Joke Shop. He swore he was going to use them all on Lupin, Tonks, and Kreacher, the only other regular occupants of Grimmauld Place, but Harry figured he should at least warn Tony about the possibility of having magical booby traps set up in the Tower.

Pietro had been amazed at the rows and rows of books in Wizard’s Wiki. Harry quietly explained what some of them were while Sirius chatted up a bloke with an odd red cape and intelligent dark eyes.

“Unicorns are real then?” Pietro asked Harry when he flipped through a book on magical creatures.

Harry grimaced as he thought of Quirrell drinking from the silver unicorn to give life to Voldemort.

“Yeah, they’re real,” Harry said shortly. “I’m sure you can read about them in the book.”

Pietro gave him a peculiar look but said nothing else as he chose a stack of books to read.

Then Harry ogled a set of quidditch gloves in the quidditch supply shop that nearly brought tears to his eyes when he thought of how he’d never get to play quidditch again.

“What’s wrong?” Sirius slung his arm around Harry’s shoulders in the store and hugged him to his side. Harry had tensed under the odd feeling of Tonks’ slim arm being the one wrapped around him, but reminded himself it was Sirius and willed his muscles to relax.

Harry shrugged. “Nothing,” he mumbled.

Sirius gave him a searching look. “Missing your friends?” he guessed.

“Not too much,” Harry said evasively. He did miss Ron and Hermione, the twins and Ginny, but he’d gotten a video from Hermione of the five of them in the common room that had made him laugh as they all tried to mimic Tony’s insults to Umbridge and Snape.

“Peter?” Sirius said.

“No,” Harry lied.

“Quidditch?”

Harry shrugged. “A bit.”

Sirius laughed and ruffled Harry’s hair. “You’re definitely my godson,” he said proudly. “I went mad in my sixth year when I was banned from playing. I thought your dad was going to castrate me, it was his first year as captain.”

Harry forced a smile and listened to Sirius explain the many ways that James made his life hell when Sirius had suffered through a year long ban on quidditch. He also, optimistically, bought the quidditch gloves. He thought that if nothing else, he could wear them if Rhodey ever wanted to go flying again.

 

Everything had been going great until someone at the restaurant they chose for lunch recognized ’Harry Potter’ and they decided to make a dash for it before Harry got hounded.

 

“You’re rather famous,” Pietro said casually when they loaded their purchases in the boot of the car and started driving back toward the Tower. “Why?”

Harry turned his head and looked out the window with a frown. He hadn’t considered it luck at the time, but it was lucky that Sirius had a big mouth and explained enough of Harry’s past to Tony that Harry didn’t have to do it.

Who wanted to be famous because their parents had been murdered?

“It’s because I’m an escaped convict and Harry’s my godson everyone thinks I want to kill,” Sirius said breezily with a flick of the pink hair Tonks had been sporting when Sirius stole her identity. He snagged a pair of Tony’s mirrored sunglasses off the rear view mirror and looked as arrogant as ever when he put them on. “It’s really thanks to me.”

Harry smirked at Sirius and raised a challenging brow at Pietro.

“You heard him,” he said drily. “Now be quiet so Sirius can listen to good music.”

Harry turned the radio up as loud as it went and put Peter’s playlist on shuffle for the rest of the drive back to the Tower.

 

Sirius parked the car in a haphazard way, definitely outside of the neat white lines it had been in before they took it, and whistled the whole way up to the top floor that Harry shared with Tony.

“Bloody hell this place looks better and better every time I see it,” Sirius said appreciatively when they stepped off the lifts. His Polyjuice had worn off just before they pulled in the garage and Harry figured he was saving it for any outings in the magical sector of New York. Sirius stood just off the lifts and looked around the flat that had been repaired sometime during the brief few hours that Harry had slept the night before.

Hedwig hooted and flew to Sirius’ shoulder just as Joey barked and ran straight to Pietro. Joey’s tail was wagging quickly while he propped his big paws on Pietro’s knees and panted up at him with what Harry was certain was the dog version of a smile.

“You traitors,” Harry told the animals with no real bite to his tone. “See if they let you sleep with them.”

“I will,” Sirius whispered to Hedwig. He dropped his bags on the sitting room floor and breezed straight to the kitchen with Hedwig picking at his hair. “What are you cooking for dinner?”

Harry laughed and flopped across the sofa, landing on his stomach. He wrestled around to yank his phone from his front pocket and dangled it where Sirius could see.

“I don’t cook,” Harry told Sirius. Pietro took the chair beside the sofa and flipped the footrest out before grabbing the remote and idly browsing channels. “I can order whatever you want though.”

Sirius turned quickly and had a smile a mile wide.

“Anything at all?”

“Anything,” Harry promised.

Pietro smirked at Harry. “Anything?”

“Anything.”

 

They wound up ordering a little of everything from the pizza place because Sirius wanted wings and pizza and breadsticks and Pietro wanted to try the brookie when Harry described it to him.

Then, while they ate in the sitting room and watched a dumb movie about astronauts or something, Sirius decided it was a brilliant idea to break out a bottle of Tony’s whisky.

“I told Tony I’d be the first one to get you pissed,” Sirius said cheerfully. He snagged three glasses from the kitchen and filled them all half full of whisky and then the rest of the way with soda.

“He lets me drink all the time,” Harry pointed out to his godfather smugly.

“But have you been drunk before?” Pietro asked with a crooked smile.

As a matter of fact, Harry had not ever truly been drunk before. A tragedy Sirius was determined to remedy, apparently.

 

“Call him,” Sirius slurred a few drinks later when the three of them were slumped on the sofa, watching Harry’s phone light up with a new text from Peter. “He’s your puppy, kiddo. You can’t leave your puppy hanging!”

“This is your puppy.” Pietro held Joey up beside his face and Harry laughed stupidly when both of them stuck their tongues out. “You don’t need a Peter puppy.”

“Call him,” Sirius insisted. He snatched Harry’s phone and pressed a few buttons before thrusting the phone in Harry’s hands. “It’s ringing!”

Harry tried to scowl at Sirius, but his face was rather numb and he wasn’t sure if he had pulled it off or not and—

“Hello?”

“Peter!” Harry giggled at the absurdity of the situation. “You’ve got a fucking stupid name.”

Sirius raised his glass, “I hate his name. Tell him to change it.”

“Can you change your name?” Harry asked curiously. “I changed mine, or my dad did. Did you know I was sort of adopted?”

“Cheers to name changes,” Pietro said, clinking his glass to Sirius’.

Peter was quiet for a moment on the phone then he huffed out a laugh.

“Are you drunk?” he asked teasingly. “You sound drunk.”

“I am seriously…” Harry, Sirius, and Pietro broke out into ridiculous snickers. “Seriously drunk,” Harry told Peter. “Oi! You should come get drunk!”

“Sure,” Peter said in a way that Harry was certain he was grinning. “I’ll just catch a flight to your top secret boarding school. I’ll be there in sixteen hours if there’s no layovers.”

“Seems like a weird thing to do since I’m in New York,” Harry told him. He smiled when Peter made a shocked little noise over the phone. “See you soon?”

 

Peter showed up at the Tower an hour later with a backpack slung over his shoulder to find Harry, Sirius, and Pietro all tangled up with each other, sound asleep, on the new-looking couch.

Peter grinned at the way Harry’s head lay on Sirius’ shoulder, but frowned at the way Pietro had Harry’s legs across his lap. He carefully moved Pietro from the couch to the floor and then stole the blanket off Harry’s bed and went to sleep beside Harry.

 

Harry groaned before he was even fully conscious the next morning. He felt the unfamiliar sofa beneath him and a familiar bundle of fur in his lap.

“Siri?” he mumbled, slightly incoherent. The sound of his own voice made him wince, so Sirius’ was like nails on a chalkboard.

“Afternoon, kiddo!” Sirius chirped. “Come eat lunch with us!”

Harry drug himself to a sitting position and glanced blearily over the back of the couch. Then Harry rubbed his eyes and squinted hard.

Sirius was sitting at the island where Harry and Tony usually ate, a ton of random food all over the area in front of him. Pietro sat beside Sirius, a tight tshirt on that had Harry averting his eyes from his arms quickly. But it was the third person sitting across from Sirius, looking as casual as if he did it every day, that had Harry wondering if he was still sleeping.

“Morning, Bright Eyes.” Peter grinned at Harry and then patted the stool beside him. “Feeling your first hangover?”

Peter looked just as he had before Harry left- his hair was maybe a little longer, the shaggy brown locks hanging across his forehead. His eyes were the same soft brown, a happy little twinkle in them. And he looked… he looked fit, honestly, even in a pair of loose sweatpants and a white tshirt.

And Harry was suddenly, and painfully, aware that he probably had drool dried on his face, his hair was a wreck, and…

“What’re you doing here?” Harry blurted out.

Peter chuckled and Tony and Pietro burst out in loud peals of laughter that had Harry twisting his face up against the annoying noise.

“You called me,” Peter told him. “I think you said ‘oh Peter, I miss you so much, please come spend the weekend with me and a convicted serial killer and some dude who was cuddling me’,” Peter said in a high pitch that didn’t match Harry’s voice at all.

Harry’s face turned red and he shot a furtive look at Pietro who sipped a cup of what smelled like coffee with a tiny smirk.

“Wait…” Harry messed with his hair, trying to get it to lay flat. “Er… Sirius isn’t a convicted killer…”

Peter whipped his phone out and clicked the screen on.

In the back of Harry’s mind, the small part that wasn’t panicking over Sirius being arrested, Harry was pleased to see that he was still Peter’s screen photo.

“That’s not what Google says,” Peter sang brightly. He waved a hand when Harry’s eyes went wide and were likely bulging in panic. “It’s cool, he says he didn’t do it.”

Pietro spat out a mouthful of coffee and gave Sirius a gobsmacked look. “You did not tell me that,” he said accusingly.

Peter shook his head at Pietro. “Did you think you’ve just been hanging out with a serial killer?”

“It is hardly the first time,” Pietro said nonchalantly as he cleaned up his mess.

Harry was planning on asking more about that, but the bitter taste in his mouth set his priorities for him.

 

It wasn’t until Harry was standing under the stream of hot water, letting it run down his face and wash away the gross feeling of sleeping in his jeans on the sofa, that he smiled self-deprecatingly.

It was an entirely new revelation to have his head pounding and Voldemort having nothing to do with it.

 

Once Harry was clean, and subtly sipped the hangover potion Sirius slipped him, the four of them made plans for the day. And since Sirius couldn’t take Polyjuice with Peter there, they had to be indoor plans.

“Movie marathon,” Peter decided. He took turns pointing at each of them as he listed his reasons for it. “You have never seen anything,” he told Harry, “you’ve been in prison for a freaking decade,” he told Sirius. He paused at Pietro for a moment, “I actually don’t know anything about you.”

Pietro picked at his nails with a bored expression. “I’ve been in captivity for eight years,” he said lightly. “There were not many films being shown.”

Peter frowned at them all. “This is sad, gentlemen. None of you have seen the Fast & Furious movies?”

 

They hadn’t, but Sirius was quickly a big fan.

 

“It looks like your dad‘s car!” Sirius whooped when a similar looking yellow car raced another flashy car on the telly. “Petey, you know how to drive?” he asked Peter with a manic light in his eyes.

Harry slapped his hand over Peter’s mouth quickly and shook his head.

“We cannot race Tony’s cars,” Harry told Sirius firmly. “Quit making me be the adult, Pads, I don’t like it.”

Sirius pouted. “Why do any of us have to be the adult?” he whined. “Tony’s not a real adult.”

“He has a point,” Pietro said with a grin. “What is the worst that could happen?”

Peter licked Harry’s hand, causing him to quickly drop it from his face, and gave Sirius a bright smile.

“Tell your godson to ride with me and I’ll race you,” he told him. His voice got a cocky lilt to it that shouldn’t have been attractive when he added, “I’ve got a license even.”

 

And the race was on.

 

They decided to race to a ‘smoothie’ shop because Peter swore they were brilliant for hangovers. Harry joined Peter in Tony’s sleek black car with the top down and Pietro climbed back in the yellow car with Sirius.

“Sirius drives like a madman,” Harry warned Peter as he carefully drove the car out of the garage.

Peter smiled widely when they hit the highway not far from the Tower.

“Luckily for us, I’ve got excellent reflexes,” Peter bragged just before he pressed on the gas and they were flying.

“So you’re back for good now?” Peter yelled over the wind that was strong enough that Harry’s eyes tearing.

“Yeah,” Harry yelled back. He gripped the dash tightly as Peter wove in and out of traffic at speeds that were unreal. “Fuck, who taught you to drive?!”

Peter laughed and he sounded so happy that Harry risked a glance over at him. His hair was blown backward and his entire face was lit up with excitement. Harry’s stomach curled with something warm at the expression- it was a good look for him, one Harry didn’t see very often.

He took a quick photo and stuck his tongue out when Peter caught him.

“Nobody taught me to drive,” Peter admitted. “I mean I took drivers ed, but— Jesus Christ, what happened to your hand??”

Harry looked down and saw that the bandages he’d wrapped his hand in after his shower were already stained red.

“Uh… I cut my thumb when I was cooking,” Harry said, thinking quickly. “Oi! CAR!”

Peter didn’t even look before he spun the steering wheel and Harry fell against the door at the sharp turn he took to evade the car he’d almost rammed into.

Harry’s heart was hammering in his chest and he suddenly worried what Tony would do if they so much as scratched one of his expensive cars. Tony was laid back, much more than almost anyone Harry knew, but everyone had a line somewhere.

“Sorry,” Peter said sheepishly. He quickly spun the wheel again and skid to a screeching halt in front of an orange business that had posters of colorful smoothies in the windows. “We win though.”

Harry let out a very heavy sigh and then impulsively leaned across the middle console to snog Peter.

“I’m driving back,” he told him.

Peter had a goofy grin on his face when he turned the car off and tossed Harry the keys.

“It’s all yours, Bright Eyes.”

 

Sirius waited (and pouted) in the car while Harry, Peter, and Pietro ordered a variety of smoothies to try once they got back to the Tower.

They’d just paid when Harry got a text from Tony.

Having fun?

Never. Are you?

Always.

Harry felt guilty when they got back in their cars so he gave Sirius a very firm order to drive carefully before reluctantly handing the keys back over to Peter.

“Don’t wreck it,” Harry told him pleadingly. “I’d rather not have Tony wring my neck when he gets home.”

“I won’t put a single scratch on her,” Peter swore. He gave Harry a curious look from the corner of his eye. “Do you and your dad fight a lot?”

Harry considered the very few arguments they’d had since Harry first arrived in New York.

“No,” he said, sounding mildly surprised. “We get along alright.”

Peter hummed and nodded while obediently keeping his eyes on the road.

“He seems cool, your dad,” he told Harry. “Your goddad is cool too, for an escaped serial killer.”

Harry relaxed at the playful tone and kicked on a song they liked while Peter drove the speed limit.

“You’re still a nerd though,” Peter called over the music.

Harry gave him a fond smile. “You’re the geek, Moe.”

Peter laughed. “Moe? What’s that mean?”

Harry threw his hands in the air. “No idea, ask Tony!”

 

The rest of their day was peaceful enough. They camped out in the sitting room and watched the telly while they snacked on the various foods Sirius kept gleefully ordering. They’d finished the second movie in what Peter claimed was a seven film series when Harry and Sirius dipped outside to take Joey to the bathroom.

“How you feeling, kiddo?” Sirius asked Harry while they leaned against a tree and watched Joey chase birds.

Harry shrugged. “Fine.”

Sirius poked him hard in the side and narrowed his eyes.

“Could you be any more of a dick?” he huffed. “Give me something more than ‘fine’.”

“But I’m fine,” Harry insisted. “I’m a bit peeved that Tony left me behind when I wanted to help, but you’re here and Peter’s here and Pietro isn’t too terrible.”

And it was home, was what Harry didn’t tell him. Even when he’d been annoyed at being brushed off like a child the other night, even when he’d been embarrassed by Tony and spied on, and even when a stupid bloody hammer decided Harry wasn’t a good person, it was home. And home was ten times preferable to Hogwarts even on its worst days.

Sirius stared hard in Harry’s eyes, searching for something. Whatever he found, he smiled softly and put his arm around Harry’s shoulders.

“I’m happy for you, kiddo,” he said after they went back to watching Harry’s dog. “This is the life I always wanted for you.”

 

“Alright gentlemen, the name of the game is never have I ever.” Peter poured a bottle of something that smelled terrible in four shot glasses and gave one to each of them. They’d gotten sick of movies around the time that Sirius ordered half of a Mexican restaurant for dinner and Sirius decided that getting Harry, Pietro, and Peter drunk was a good idea.

Honestly, it was no wonder the man wound up in Azkaban. His best ideas were always illegal.

Harry leaned back on the carpet and scratched Joey’s head while Peter explained the drinking game. Everyone took a turn saying something they’d never done, if the others did it, they drank.

It would be hard to play with two wizards, one enhanced bloke with super speed, and a muggle, but Harry figured he and Sirius would just have to be creative.

“Never have I ever… raced before today,” Peter said.

Sirius held his glass up in a toast before throwing it back, just as Harry had to do.

“I raced Sirius on motorcycles in Malibu,” Harry explained.

“And I used to race everyone on my bike,” Sirius said nostalgically. He grinned at Harry, “I raced Tony back when we met in London.”

“Who won?” Peter asked.

“I did,” Sirius drawled before adding, “I also cheated, but don’t tell him.”

Harry gave Sirius a sweet smile that didn’t take away from his narrowed eyes at all.

“Oh I won’t, because unlike some fucking people, I can keep a secret.”

Sirius rolled his eyes as they’d already argued over it the night before when they first began drinking. Sirius claimed it was for ‘Harry’s own good’ and Harry swore revenge one day; perhaps he’d tell Tonks and Lupin about Sirius’ jealousy.

He wouldn’t, but he wouldn’t be telling Sirius if he so much as got a paper cut in the future either.

Sirius didn’t promise not to do it again, but he did tell Harry he’d at least give him a heads up the next time, which Harry figured was as good as it got from him.

“Is that when Tony made you Harry’s god dad?” Peter asked curiously.

“Hm?” Sirius tilted his head at Peter. “Tony didn’t make me Harry’s godfather, James did.”

“Who is James?” Pietro asked.

“Harry’s mum’s husband, my best mate.”

“Wait! Tony slept with Harry’s mom while she was married?” Peter asked with wide eyes. “Damn.”

Harry scowled and kicked Sirius when he either had to let Peter have the wrong impression of his mum or admit something he’d rather not do.

“Tony slept with both my parents,” Harry said in a rush, triggering a blush that burnt his face, neck, and chest. “Whose turn is it?”

Peter bit his lip then ducked his head while his shoulders shook with silent laughter and Pietro volunteered to go next.

“Never have I ever… lived in a robot house before,” Pietro said, eyeing the giant telly and the ‘smart fridge’ and the other electronics that Harry had grown accustomed to seeing in their flat.

Sirius and Peter laughed while Harry was the only one who had to drink, then Sirius wagged a finger at Pietro.

“Doesn’t count,” he told him. “You said you lived in a cell for eight years.”

“As did you,” Pietro countered with quickly. He smiled lazily at Sirius, “Perhaps we have quite a bit in common.”

Sirius perked right up and Harry felt his heart clench painfully in his chest. Sirius was always so excited by anyone’s attention, it was like he thought nobody noticed him ever since he got out of Azkaban. He’d once told Harry that he lost all his good looks and charm to Azkaban just as he’d lost his freedom the same night he lost his best mate in the world.

Harry figured that was the real reason the Tonks and Lupin thing bothered Sirius. Sirius probably assumed him and Lupin would be a thing again and when Lupin chose Tonks, it broke Sirius’ pride as much as it did his heart.

One day Harry hoped Sirius would be free to explore the whole world and find someone that made him happy in a way that Harry couldn’t do. If anyone deserved it, it was Sirius.

“My turn,” Sirius said, a new pep in his tone. “Never have I ever… uh…” Sirius tapped his chin thoughtfully. “I’ve done a bloody lot of things,” he admitted.

“Drugs?” Peter asked.

Sirius nodded.

“Women?” Pietro asked slyly.

Sirius nodded.

“Have you ever actually killed someone?” Harry asked thoughtfully. Sirius had been accused of it, but—

“Sure have.”

Well that was out.

It took a while, but eventually Sirius decided that he’d never flown on a jet before Tony flew him there and Peter decided to let it count. Especially since it meant that Harry and Pietro had to drink while Peter didn’t.

Everyone looked expectantly at Harry.

Harry bit his lip and blurted out the first thing he could think of.

“Never have I ever snogged a girl.”

As soon as the words left his mouth, Harry felt like an idiot, but Peter and Sirius clinked their glasses cheerfully and threw them back while Pietro only shrugged.

“I’ve never kissed anyone,” he told Harry. He lowered his eyelids and raised his brows, “Interested?”

Peter quickly wrapped his arm around Harry’s waist and gave Pietro a strained smile.

“He’s not, actually. But Sirius looks single, flirt with him.”

Harry laughed at Pietro’s theatrics at riling Peter up then quit laughing quickly when Pietro spent the rest of the game bringing up an embarrassing variety of sexual things he’d never done just to see what all Harry and Sirius had done.

Harry had done nothing, Sirius had done everything.

“You’re a slag,” Harry slurred at his godfather when they finally called it quits and were laying all over the sitting room talking drunken nonsense.

Sirius had an odd high pitched laugh and tried to ruffle Harry’s hair and wound up hitting Hedwig and got his finger pecked for it.

“With Tony’s genes, you will be too,” he told Harry. “You’ll get tall and confident and then you’ll be shagging everyone.”

Peter was half-laying on Harry with his head on Harry’s chest and slapped out at Sirius’ hand with uncanny aim considering he was pissed.

“Fuck off,” Peter told Sirius. “Don’t tell my boyfriend to be a hoe.”

Harry’s breath hitched for a moment. Were they- were they actually… boyfriends? Harry peeked down at Peter, but his eyes were closed and his lips were curled up in a half-smile of contentment so Harry figured it was a question better asked when they weren’t drunk.

 

Except he didn’t get an opportunity, because Tony came home the next afternoon, not long after they all woke up.

 

Harry had been laughing his head off as he kicked Sirius, Pietro, and Peter’s arses on the racing game on Tony’s Xbox.

“You lot suck,” he teased them when he won the second round in a row.

“I’m letting you win,” Peter said with a crooked grin. He grabbed a handful of the popcorn they were sharing and threw it at Harry. “It’s called being nice, Bright Eyes, maybe you should try it.”

Harry tilted his head back and caught a piece in his mouth. “Oh yeah?” he smirked after he slowly chewed and swallowed the piece. “That’s awfully chivalrous of you, Parker, too bad you’re a liar.”

Peter had watched Harry’s lips while he chewed and slowly moved his eyes to Harry’s. There was a spark in them that sent a flare of heat from Harry’s stomach clear to his face.

“Oh, Stark, you’ve got no idea—”

Ding!

Everyone’s heads spun to see the light above the lift doors light up just before the doors themselves opened and Tony strode through quickly.

Tony stopped dead in the doorway of the sitting room and looked around slowly, prompting Harry to do the same.

It was… it was more than a bit trashed, actually.

There were pizza boxes and empty glass bottles from Friday night under the coffee table. Empty smoothie cups on the tv stand with the Xbox and a stack of video games they’d worked their way through. Hedwig was preening on the back of the chair, Joey was in the middle of the sofa. And there were pillows, blankets, and popcorn everywhere.

Harry turned to Tony and opened his mouth to give a quick defense, one he was sure he’d think up any moment, but Tony inexplicably had a wide smile on his face.

“Good to see you, Pete,” he said to Peter. He tossed a posh looking black bag toward his bedroom door and then quirked a brow at Harry. “Remind me to never leave a fifteen year old in charge again.”

“I thought I was in charge?” Sirius protested weakly as he stretched a leg out to kick an empty bottle beneath the sofa.

“Where is Wanda?” Pietro asked quickly.

“You were never in charge,” Tony said, pointing at Sirius. He swung his finger to Pietro, “She’s downstairs, pouting with Steve.”

“Why’re they pouting?” Harry asked. He’d been relieved to see Tony whole and healthy looking, no limps or obvious injuries, but if they were pouting…

Tony shook his head and grimaced up at the ceiling. “Mission unsuccessful,” he said flatly. “Oh!” Tony tilted his head down at winked at Harry before smirking at Sirius. “You busy tomorrow?”

Sirius made a show of pulling his phone from his pocket, frowning and moving his lips as he scrolled through it, then pocketed it and rolled his eyes.

“Nothing I can’t cancel,” he drawled sarcastically. “Why?”

Harry felt his heart actually skip a beat when Tony lifted a shoulder casually and propped himself against the doorway with his arms crossed.

“How do you feel about a fair trial?”

Chapter Text

The team had been quiet and subdued on the flight back from Spain where they’d tracked Ultron to.

In layman’s terms, they got their asses handed to them and nobody was happy about it.

Tony had been tapping away on his phone, trying very hard not to check Harry’s texts, when Wanda, who had actually helped them, much to his surprise, moved to sit across from him.

“Will your son be returning to his school for magic?” she asked, completely out of the blue.

Tony snorted and didn’t look up from where he was clearing out his inbox. “Over my dead body.”

“He is finished with learning magic?”

Tony dragged tired eyes up to look at Wanda and sighed as loudly as he could.

“He’s done with magic boarding schools,” Tony said firmly. He flipped his hand irritably at Wanda’s surprised expression. According to his bank alerts and GPS pings on his cars, Harry was already behaving like a normal fifteen year old left home alone, he didn’t need a magical school - he needed normalcy. And if he wanted to be a wizard too, then there was no need to be hasty with it.

“I’m sure I can find a magic tutor or something,” Tony mused. Everyone had a price; maybe the witch with the bun wanted to take her talents in the private sector.

“Why don’t you have Black teach him?” Clint asked, shamelessly eavesdropping. He leaned against the wall of the cargo carrier and shrugged his shoulders when everyone looked at him. “What? He knows magic.”

“Loki knows the ways of magic!” Thor said with a clap to Clint’s shoulder and a broad smile for Tony. “I could bring him, have him teach your son the ancient arts of sorcery!”

“The ancient arts of mind control and evil, you mean,” Nat scoffed from the cockpit.

Tony nodded in agreement with Nat, and Thor’s sensitive ass frowned.

“Loki is truly apologetic,” he said. “If his assistance was required, I’m sure I could convince our father to release him.”

“Yeah, maybe not,” Tony said swiftly. No need to release Reindeer Games while Ultron and Darth Vader were still loose. The last thing they needed were the three of them teaming up to take over the world. “And Sirius can’t stay, there’s the whole traitor business that needs dealt with first.”

“So deal with it,” Clint said bluntly. He lifted his chin arrogantly when Tony looked toward him. “What? Mister ‘I Hacked in the Pentagon’, I thought you could do anything.”

“Oh I can,” Tony said confidently. He was Tony Stark, he could do anything with five minutes, a decent tech setup, and enough money. Not defeat Ultron, or find Darth Vader, or go kill the witch that scarred his kid, but he could probably clear Sirius’ name or get him a damn good plastic surgeon and a whole new identity. Actually…

Tony tapped his chin thoughtfully while the others fell in separate conversations.

Sirius had no reason to be a wanted man in the US. Not when the man in charge of the magical sector seemed much more intelligent than the one in charge of the British side. The MACUSA President had a cell phone and used an ink pen, for crying out loud. If Tony played his cards right, maybe they didn’t need Peter Pettigrew to clear Sirius’ name.

“Christmas is coming early, Harry,” Tony murmured before whipping his phone right back out and calling the number he’d gotten before.

It only rang twice before President Quahog answered with a politely puzzled greeting.

“Mister Stark? How can I help you?”

Tony reclined back in his seat, ignoring his curious team, and chose his words carefully.

“First off, Hogwarts didn’t exactly pan out for Harry, any chance you have a list of tutors who make house calls?” he asked, going with the easy request first.

“Of course, Mister Stark, I can send you a list of witches and wizards who work outside of Illvermony to teach magic,” the President said swiftly. “A great many people would consider it an honor to teach Harry Potter magic.”

“Knock those ones off the list,” Tony said firmly. “If they’re going to gush over him, we’re not interested.”

President Quahog chuckled amicably. “Understood. I can send that list to you on Monday, if that works?”

“Works great,” Tony said genuinely.

“Was that all?”

“No.” Tony spoke slowly, aware that a single wrong step could ruin Sirius’ life, which would ruin Harry’s. “Is there a way to determine if a person is telling you the truth or not?” he asked. “A magical lie detector or something?”

Quahog sounded equal parts confused and intrigued at Tony’s question.

“There is a highly regulated potion we use, but I’m afraid we keep it for criminal cases, not for a parent to use on their child.”

Tony laughed and imagined how much his kid would hate him if he drugged him to get some straight answers from his mouth.

“No, no, Harry’s perfect,” he said, thinking of the speed his cars had been traveling the day before. “I met someone interesting on a mission I’m on, someone magic who said they were framed for a crime. I don’t have the person who framed them, but I’d think you’d like an opportunity to clear an innocent man’s name.”

The President was quiet for a moment, contemplating Tony’s words.

“And who is this magical criminal you’ve happened across?” he finally asked.

“Sirius Black.”

A pause, and then—

“Sirius Black?” The President sounded disturbed, which was totally fair considering Sirius’ crimes. “Mister Stark, I must advise you to bring him in at once. Having him anywhere near your son—”

Tony cut him off, uninterested in parenting advice by a politician.

“Look, he says he didn’t do it, can you prove that or not?” he asked bluntly.

“There is a kiss on sight order for Black, he’s incredibly dangerous.”

Tony smiled wryly and crossed his legs at the ankle. He didn’t like to play politics, but it didn’t mean he was unable to either.

“So you give him the magical lie detector potion and either I’m wrong and you get to be the man who captured a dangerous criminal that Minister Fudge was unable to.” Tony paused, letting the idea sink in before adding the shining flip side. “Or I’m right and you get to pardon a wizard who was wrongfully convicted by your British counterpart. I’m not exactly seeing a downfall for you either way, Mister President.”

Quahog was silent for a moment as he let Tony’s words permeate his brain. Tony could practically see his perfectly political smile in his mind when he finally responded.

“I expect to see you and Mister Black first thing in the morning then, Mister Stark.”

Tony pumped a fist in the air and let out a whoop. He didn’t capture Ultron, but damn if Harry wasn’t going to be thrilled anyway.

“A trial!” Tony crowed. “This calls for champagne!”

Tony began bustling around, pouring glasses of champagne in flutes, whistling cheerily as he imagined Harry’s face when he got home.

Maybe he’d get another ‘dad’ or maybe even an ‘I love you’ or—

“I don’t know why you’d try and clear Black’s name,” Nat said scathingly as she accepted her glass, her feet propped up on the steering wheel. “The kid won’t need you if he has his godfather back.”

Tony frowned at her and playfully swatted her head.

“Don’t be ridiculous,” he said. “I’m Harry’s dad, Sirius can be a fun uncle or something.”

Nat hummed and gave him a pitying look before draining her glass, but Tony ignored her and chose to remain optimistic.

There were a lot of things he couldn’t fix, a lot of mistakes he’d made that were a pain to correct, but he could do this.

 

And Tony had been optimistic all the way up until Sirius was led into an interrogation chamber and Tony hadn’t been able to follow him.

 

Tony paced anxiously outside the room where Sirius was being interrogated. If he had been wrong, if Sirius had done the crime he’d been accused of, then that was it.

Either Tony would have to single-handedly fight the wizards to whisk Harry and Sirius right out of the country or Tony would have to go home and tell his son that he’d let his godfather get locked up. And neither option sounded real enticing.

Harry was as anxious as Tony was, and he kept sending texts that Tony couldn’t bear to look at. His mind kept replaying the desperate look on his son’s face when he told his godfather goodbye that morning.

This couldn’t get fucked up. Sirius had to have a happy ending so Harry could have a happy ending.

Harry would never forgive Tony if he delivered his favorite person directly to the authorities.

 

It seemed to take an eternity, but part of Tony’s mind kept perfect track of time and knew it had only been seventy-five minutes and nine seconds when the large oak doors opened and President Quahog stepped out with a frown.

“Mister Black will need to return later this week to obtain citizenship and register his animagus form. I’ll send a list of reputable tutors with him,” he said. Tony’s heart soared and he began to smile before Quahog raised what seemed to be a supremely unimpressed dark brow at him. “I’ll be sure to list your address on Mister Black’s documents, as he claims he’s been a frequent guest there.”

Tony remained glib while his insides were giddy. He did this. He got Sirius’ freedom in the United States.

He got Harry his godfather back.

In the face of all of Tony’s recent and spectacular failures, he finally got a win.

“Did he? Wild,” Tony said. He offered the President his hand and a genuine smile. “If you need anything, you have my number.”

Quahog smiled politely, but Tony sensed that it was a rocky bridge between them. Not that he cared, because Sirius strode out of the room with a smile so wide it seemed to knock years off him. Standing there in Tony’s suit with his hair pulled back in a neat ponytail, looking like he won the lottery, Sirius looked more like he had when Tony first met him than he ever had.

“Free!” Sirius cried. He lunged forward and wrapped his arms around Tony’s torso and laughed until his chuckles turned to sobs. “Free! I never—”

Tony patted Sirius’ back awkwardly and felt his neck itch at the unrestrained tears soaking Tony’s own shoulder. God, emotions were… were really messy.

Sirius must have sensed his discomfort because he pulled away and chuckled after wiping his face with his sleeve.

“Sorry, mate,” he said apologetically. “I just…” Sirius smiled again and shook his head. “I never really thought I’d be free.”

“Only in America,” Tony reminded him. “If you go back to London you’re still a criminal.”

Sirius snorted and looked straight on at Tony with grey eyes filled with so much happiness.

“I am never going back,” he swore. “Don’t tell Harry yet, let’s surprise him.”

Tony read Harry’s increasingly panicked, and colorful, texts on their way back to the Tower while Sirius bounced in his seat and kept running his fingers over his wand.

And Tony felt great about it, he felt like he’d managed to snatch the moon from the sky for his son. He’d gotten an innocent man an official pardon, he cleared Harry’s godfathers name. Tony felt ten feet tall.

 

Then Harry ran directly to Sirius and clung to him tightly when they stepped off the elevator and Tony’s heart sank while Nat’s words replayed in his mind.

“The kid won’t need you if he has his godfather back.”

Tony excused himself to his lab and neither Harry nor Sirius seemed to even hear him while they laughed together.

 

And Tony shrunk right back down to his normal height of 5’11”.

Chapter Text

Monday, September 17

“You swear you’ll be here in the morning?” Harry asked again.

Sirius laughed before he flipped the footrest of his recliner up and gave Harry a cheeky salute.

“Kiddo, I’ve got no where else I’d rather be,” he said.

Harry grinned against his will at the earnest smile on Sirius’ face and the light in his eyes that Harry had never seen before.

“No murders, no running off to London,” Harry warned him as he backed out of Sirius’ relatively unfurnished sitting room toward the lifts. “Swear it, Padfoot.”

Sirius had his hands behind his head and his eyes closed, the perfect image of a content and free man.

“Goodnight, Harry,” he sang. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”

Harry’s grin grew to a full blown smile as he moved from the flat Sirius was sharing with Thor back up to his and Tony’s flat.

Free.

Sirius was free.

He didn’t have to use Polyjuice or hide as a dog anymore, not as long as he stayed in America and didn’t commit any crimes.

Free.

Harry’s smile slipped a bit when he saw Tony’s lab door closed and the light on beneath it. He shrugged it off easily though and went to call Ron and Hermione.

Free.

 

“That’s brilliant!” Hermione squealed. “Ooh, Harry! I’m so happy for you!”

“Thanks,” Harry was beaming after filling Hermione in. “Where’s Ron?”

Hermione rolled her eyes. “Quidditch,” she said shortly. “Angelina has them training every day for their first match.”

“Oh.” Harry’s stomach clenched uncomfortably, but he pushed past it to keep his cheer up. He’d rather have Sirius than Quidditch anyway. “Well what else is new? Have they found a new Professor for defense?”

“Yes and oh my god, guess who it is? The real Professor Moody!” Hermione said in a rush. “And he’s insane, Harry!” Hermione lowered her voice to a whisper and leaned closer to her phone screen, “I don’t think Crouch really had to act much! They’re both entirely mad!”

Harry forced a laugh, but the reminder of the professor that entered him in the tournament, delivered him to Voldemort, and then tried to kill Harry himself was an unpleasant topic.

“What do you think this means for the Order?” Hermione asked quickly, spotting the lines forming between Harry’s eyebrows.

Harry scoffed, “I don’t think Sirius gives a damn. Tony and his team’ll probably find Voldemort before Dumbledore does.”

Tony had been able to clear Sirius’ name in a single day, something Dumbledore hadn’t been able to do in the two years Sirius had been loose for. Once they caught Tony’s odd evil robot bloke, Harry was certain they’d find Voldemort and then Harry could help vanquish him and everything would work out fine.

Harry could be the son that Tony deserved, Sirius could be free, they’d all live together and Azkaban and Voldemort and evil robots would be a problem in the past.

Hermione smiled at Harry’s swift confidence in his dad’s abilities.

As soon as they hung up, with Hermione promising to fill Ron in as soon as he got back from quidditch, Harry text Peter.

Google needs an update.

Oh yeah?

It should say ‘Sirius Black, wrongfully convicted and officially pardoned’.

LOL! That’s awesome!

Harry chewed his lower lip and tried to find a tactful and subtle way to ask if Peter wanted to do something the next day… Peter swore he hadn’t been avoiding Harry before, when Harry first got home. And since Peter had a tendency for sneaking out, Harry was inclined to believe him.

It didn’t hurt that Peter came over the instant Harry called him the other night either.

Got plans tomorrow?

Nope. I’m as free as your hot god dad is.

Harry rolled his eyes, it was a gross joke that didn’t get any funnier the more he heard it. Gwen had shit taste in blokes if she found Sirius and Tony attractive.

Maybe we could do something? Harry typed hopefully. He held his breath while Peter replied, mentally begging him to not brush him off.

Cool, will you be at school in the morning?

No idea. Maybe.

If so, tell your dad we’ll study together after school. If not, tell him we’re studying anyway and we’ll meet up.

Harry wondered if his day could get any better.

Cool.

 

Harry faffed around in his room a bit. He carefully laid out an outfit - Tony’s Metallica shirt, the leather jacket that looked like Sirius’, a pair of black trainers, and a pair of jeans - to wear the next day, just in case he did start school. He sent Pepper a photo, asking what she thought.

If anyone cared about Harry’s clothes, it was Pepper. She wouldn’t laugh at his need for reassurance, Pepper thought clothes were a top priority.

You dress like a punk.

Harry smirked and tapped back a quick reply.

Am I a good looking punk though?

Pepper sent back a laughing face and a thumbs up.

A Stark for sure. I miss you, I can’t wait to be back. Tell your dad to stay out of the liquor.

Harry text back a quick agreement, but when he went to check, Tony was still in his lab.

“Er… Jarvis?”

“Yes, Harry?”

Harry hovered uncertainly in the kitchen, tapping the counter in agitation.

“What’s Tony’s favorite food?”

“He orders from Mario’s the most often.”

Harry tried to remember which place that was, Italian, he thought. It sounded Italian, anyway.

“Can you order food from there?” Harry asked Jarvis. “Just whatever he usually gets and I’ll just take the same thing. Oh,” Harry paused, unsure if Thor had any food in his flat, “can you make it like three orders of whatever? So I can bring Sirius some?”

Jarvis sounded upbeat when he agreed and Harry nodded decisively to himself. Everyone liked food. And if Tony was busy, then Harry could just do something nice for him like Tony did for Sirius.

Not that ordering dinner was really the same as clearing away a wrongful conviction, but Harry would figure out a way to do something better later.

 

Except Tony still hadn’t left his lab by the time food was delivered and Harry dropped some off for Sirius.

 

Harry sat at the kitchen counter and poked at his food rather than eating it as nerves seized him. Jarvis had said he told Tony that dinner was done, but he never came out. And Harry knew his work was important, Tony was a fucking superhero on top of owning a business so huge that Harry couldn’t properly wrap his mind around it. But… but before Harry went to Hogwarts it had been a sort of rule that Harry ate meals with Tony. And when it was just the two of them, they weren’t even bad times.

Clearly something had changed.

Maybe Tony was too busy? Or he didn’t want to? He could have realized that Harry wasn’t a great person to call a son. He hadn’t seemed mad about the mess over the weekend, and Peter and Pietro helped Harry clean up quickly after Tony returned, but… maybe he was pissed?

Or… Harry’s stomach lurched and he thought he might truly be sick… or now that Sirius was free, maybe Tony didn’t want to bother with Harry. Maybe he figured Harry would go back to being Sirius’ burden.

Maybe he hoped Harry would get the hint and leave him alone.

Harry swallowed harshly and pushed his food away. He got up and carefully stuck Tony’s food in the fridge and made sure he cleaned up after himself, not leaving so much as a crumb behind him.

Sure, Tony had talked about Harry staying forever and them being a family, but that was before. Before he knew Harry was a wizard, before he got to know Harry, before he felt Harry had to be rescued from school, and before he’d seen that Harry had gotten himself scarred by his teacher.

It made sense that Tony would be ready to sign Harry over to Sirius. Dumbledore signed Harry over to Aunt Petunia, Aunt Petunia signed Harry over to Tony. What was another surprise relocation? At least Sirius would want Harry around.

Sirius sent you here in the first place, a nasty voice reminded Harry when he finished cleaning up and began debating what to do. He’d been close to going back to Sirius’ flat and bothering him, but that reminder of Sirius shipping Harry away was like a cold knife in his heart.

Harry could have laughed.

Nobody wanted him. And why would they? Harry failed as a wizard, he was failing as a son, he was just… just fucking failing.

 

The flat suddenly felt suffocating in its silence and its isolation.

Harry snagged a jacket and his earbuds quickly and then clipped Joey on his lead and slipped away, desperately needing air.

 

Harry hummed along to a song as he wandered around the city aimlessly. He could get as lost as he wanted, really, because Jarvis had never failed Harry on directions home before.

Was it still Harry’s home though? Tony had talked about spending the holidays together, but had that changed since he surely knew what kind of person Harry was now?

It had probably been a mistake on Harry’s part to get so attached to their home and Tony himself. Who knew better than Harry how quickly people could change their minds about someone?

Harry tried to not think about it. There was nothing he could do if Tony didn’t want Harry around anymore, Harry couldn’t force people to be around him and he didn’t blame them if they didn’t want to.

Harry didn’t want to be around himself most of the time, why should he force his presence on others?

Walking around was a decent enough distraction anyway. Harry and Peter had tended to avoid the busier section when they were on their skateboards, but that was the direction Harry and Joey walked.

The sky was dark, but the city was so lit up that Harry didn’t have any trouble navigating the sidewalks. Joey kept barking and chasing after stray cats and pigeons, but Harry kept a firm hold on his leash. Or, he had, until Joey yanked especially hard and Harry stumbled and the leash slipped from his hand.

“Joey!” Harry yelled at his dog and began running down the sidewalk, weaving in and out of the people still out and about. Joey ignored Harry, his ears standing straight up as he pursued the mangy looking cat with singleminded focus.

Harry swore and put a burst of speed forward, desperate to keep Joey from becoming just another one of the many ‘Missing Dog’ posters that littered the light posts.

Joey turned right, chasing the cat in an alley, and Harry let out a relieved breath when the alley had a dead end. The cat leapt up on the dumpster at the end of the alley, hissing at Joey out of his reach, and Harry lunged for the leash.

“Gotcha!” he cried. Harry scowled down at Joey and pointed at him seriously. “Don’t do that again,” he scolded him. “You could have been hit by a car.”

Joey whined and tucked his tail between his legs until Harry scratched his ears.

“I’m not mad,” he murmured. “Just- just be smarter, buddy.”

As much as everyone swore Joey couldn’t understand Harry, he did bark softly in a way that sounded like an agreement. And he stayed right beside Harry’s legs when Harry got to his feet and turned to get out of the filthy and gross smelling alley they’d been in.

Except… Harry straightened up and ground his back teeth together… there were a few blokes standing around the mouth of the alleyway that weren’t talking, just standing there, watching him.

The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck stood up and he adopted a carefully blank and passive face. It was his ‘please don’t notice me’ face most used in potions.

Joey stayed obediently beside Harry as they slowly moved to exit the alley and Harry cursed himself silently for not grabbing his little silver weapon or one of the knives Clint and Psycho got him for his birthday. He’d been so desperate to escape the house, to get some air, he didn’t even consider the danger of wandering about the city with only a dog and a cell phone for back up.

Nothing for it, Harry kept his shoulders square and tried to look ten years older than he was as he approached the blokes blocking his exit.

“Excuse me,” Harry said clearly and politely, averting his eyes from the faces of the much older blokes.

“Where’s the rush?” One of them shifted, purposefully blocking Harry’s escape, and smiled sharply. He was older, probably about thirty, and smelled like the sweat staining his shirt collar and something stale. His mates shifted and Harry didn’t have to look to know that he was surrounded. Joey started growling and the fur was standing straight up on his neck.

Harry shifted to the left, the bloke mirrored him.

“My friends are waiting for me,” Harry lied smoothly.

One of the men behind Harry chuckled.

“You looked alone to us,” he jeered in an oily voice that had Harry cringing.

“That’s a nice watch,” another one said abruptly from Harry’s right hand side. Harry glanced at the watch and scowled. It was one Bruce got him for his birthday, maybe it was worth bargaining with.

“Brilliant, you can have it if you get the fuck out of my way,” Harry said with a dismissive glance toward the bloke who mentioned it.

“Mm, no…” The one in front of Harry stepped closer and Harry backed up, only to bump into the one behind him who shoved him forward and had Joey barking.

“You look familiar,” the man said. He reached up for Harry’s face and Harry reared his head back and bared his teeth in a snarl.

“Don’t fucking touch me,” he snapped. Harry’s blood was racing along to the speed of which his heart hammered. He was such an idiot, every bit as impulsive and stupid as everyone had always accused him of being. Why would he go wandering around without anything more than a cell phone he couldn't even grab without being seen?

Joey had apparently become infected with Harry’s impulsivity because when the man lifted his hand again, a sneer twisting his features, Joey leapt forward with teeth snapping and clamped down hard on the man’s legs.

The man yelled and Harry had to wrench his arms away when the bloke behind him grabbed them. Harry lunged for Joey, but the man kicked him and sent him flying into the cement wall with droplets of his own blood following. Joey hit the wall and slumped with a whine and Harry hissed beneath his breath at their god damned audacity.

“Stupid fucking dog,” the man growled before refocusing on Harry. He shoved Harry hard in the chest, sending him to the ground in a huff. Harry went to jump up, refusing to take a beating from the ground, but the one from the left kicked Harry hard in the ribs and knocked the wind from his lungs.

Harry struggled to snatch his watch off his wrist and toss it as far as he could, hoping one of them would take the bait. “Take it,” he rasped. “Just fucking take it.”

“Nah.” The man chuckled while Harry rolled on his side pushing himself up as best he could.

“I remember where I saw you before,” the man chuckled as he peered in Harry’s eyes with his own hazy and dark ones. “You were in the papers, Tony Stark’s kid, right?”

Harry debated on which way it could go - on the one hand, Iron Man was a deadly muggle machine. On the other hand, these blokes might think Harry was worth a lot more money than he was.

“Mm, we’re on the outs,” Harry said evasively. His eyes darted around, trying to find an opening as the men crowded him. “Afraid I’m not worth much ransom, you see.”

“Yeah?” The muggle smiled again, his teeth looking yellowed and crooked in the dim alley. “I find that hard to believe.”

Harry wasn’t able to so much as duck before the bloke’s hand came flying at his face, backhanding him and sending him to the side.

“I said don’t fucking touch me!” Harry swung wildly at the bloke, aiming for his face and hitting his shoulder. One of them grabbed Harry’s wrist and Harry made the mistake of kicking out behind him and got knocked back to the ground for his efforts.

Harry spat a mouthful of blood and saliva at one of them and grunted at the force of which he got kicked in the hip. He fell on his side and someone kicked Harry in the head hard enough that he saw stars and everything was swimming in slow motion.

He was pretty sure he was going to be murdered, or beaten pretty close to death anyway, but then one of the top oddest things to happen to Harry occurred.

Just as one bloke yanked Harry’s hair, pulling his face up, with a fist poised to strike- something shot down from the sky and yanked the man flying through the air and over to the rooftop of the building beside them.

“What the f—”

Something else, something white and rope-like, flew through the air and yanked another man away.

Harry glanced toward where Joey lay in a pathetic slump, his breath freezing in his throat until he saw Joey’s chest move, and by the time he turned back, only the leader of the gang of men remained. He had both his fists raised and was yelling names that Harry couldn’t make out through the ringing in his ears.

Then, suddenly, something - someone - did a spectacular flip from the rooftop where the men had been yanked to and landed directly between Harry and the man.

“You picked a real bad time to pick a fight,” the new guy said in a raspy and deep voice that was either fake or a horrible genetic curse.

“Who the fuck are you?” the man asked. He didn’t seem to want to wait for an answer because he pulled a fist back to swing at the new guy and Harry couldn’t even try to get on his feet before the new guy shot something at him, the same weird white rope thing, and encased his fist in it.

“Whoops, try the other fist,” the new guy said mockingly. He had a black stocking cap covering his head and all Harry could make out from the back was a dark jacket and a pair of equally dark jeans.

Harry tried to push up and get to his feet, but his head spun and he fell right back down.

The new guy turned to look at Harry and Harry suddenly wondered if he’d been knocked hard enough to begin seeing things…

Was this bloke wearing a red mask or did he have red skin?

“Oh, you look like shit,” the guy said softly. He didn’t even look when the other bloke decided to swing at him with his free hand, he just pointed over his shoulder and smacked his hand with the rope thing hard enough to stick him to the opposite wall. One more shot covered the bloke’s mouth, masking his shouts into utter silence.

Harry blinked and used the brick wall behind him to grasp on to, dragging himself on unsteady feet, and shook his spinning head while he and the new bloke stared at each other.

“What the fuck are you wearing?” Harry blurted after having no idea what was going on. It was a red mask of some sort with the black stocking cap on top of it, then paired with pitch black sunglasses even though it was dark outside. If it weren’t for the jeans and jacket, Harry would almost take the mask as some superhero thing like Tony’s friends wore, but…

But what the fuck was going on?

“Oh, hey, uh… don’t move,” the guy said quickly, offering Harry a hand that Harry leaned away from. “Man, you’re like… all busted.”

It took Harry a moment to realize that wasn’t an insult, but probably an accurate statement about his face.

“Fuck,” the guy swore loudly. He spun around and pointed at the guy stuck to the wall, “I’m going to fucking kill you!”

The man’s eyes widened, but Harry had a different and more pressing concern.

“My dog,” Harry said, once more looking toward Joey.

“Shit.” The guy jumped quickly over to Joey and Harry didn’t exactly want him to go grabbing him, but he wasn’t likely to win a fight with a guy shooting something from his wrists.

The guy was gentle when he grabbed Joey and cuddled him in his arms. He put his ear, or where his ear would be, against Joey’s back, and his shoulders relaxed at whatever he heard.

“I’m not a vet, but I think he’s alright,” the guy said. He carried Joey over to Harry and Harry was able to see Joey’s big sad eyes filled with tears.

Harry knew he was fucked up, his face stung and he wasn’t even able to breathe properly, but it wasn’t until he saw Joey’s eyes all watery - like Joey thought he let Harry down somehow - that Harry felt a burning sensation in his own eyes.

“Joey…” Harry said, his voice thick and raspy. He reached out for his dog and the masked bloke kept a hold of him while Harry tugged Joey in his own arms to pet him soothingly. “It’s okay, buddy,” he whispered. “You did good, real good.”

“Hey, you should call your dad or something,” the guy said in his deep voice. “Maybe go to the hospital, get checked out?”

Harry nodded absently as he held Joey against himself and pet his fur gently.

“Harry, hey.” Harry’s head snapped up at the use of his first name (apparently he was really recognizable as Tony’s son), and the mask guy seemed to be radiating a peculiar sense of concern.

“Call your dad,” the guy said quietly, his voice familiar for a moment. It was probably the concussion Harry was sure he had doing his thinking, but Harry thought that the guy probably had brown eyes.

Which was a mad thought and proof that Harry had been knocked about a bit too hard.

The guy sighed and held Joey with one arm as the other quickly and swiftly yanked Harry’s cell phone from his pocket.

“Sorry,” he said when Harry frowned at the invasion. “But you don’t really seem to understand what I’m saying.”

That was fair, because Harry had no idea what was going on. In fact, Harry couldn’t think of a real good reason why he was standing, and he slowly sunk back to the ground, pulling Joey and the masked guy with him.

“Hello? Mister Stark?”

Sounds were hard to understand and Harry leaned forward, resting his face in Joey’s fur with his eyes closed. The stars he’d seen earlier were back and he let them dance in the black space behind his eyelids freely.

“Hey! No, stay awake!”

Harry moaned disconcertedly when someone rapped on his shoulder, sending a small shiver down his back that jostled every bruise he was certain he’d have by morning.

“Harry, hey, your dad’s going to be here real soon. I- fuck… I shouldn’t be here when he gets here.”

Harry lifted his face and blinked away the tears blurring his vision, only to realize it was still blurred.

“My dad?” Harry repeated, the words not really making sense.

Where the guy’s mouth should be twitched, like he was smiling. He slid Harry’s phone back in his jacket pocket and his fingers lingered on Harry’s wrist for a moment.

“Yeah, and he sounded pissed, so I’m going to go deal with our new friends and you go home, okay?”

Harry felt like there was a disconnect between his brain and his tongue, because his tongue was working without Harry’s permission.

“You’re my hero,” Harry said, sounding slurred even to his own ears.

The guy didn’t laugh, but his missing mouth did another twitch.

“Tell me that when you’re not rocking a concussion,” he said. “See you later.”

Harry leaned back against the brick wall and kept his eyes open while the guy shot a rope thing at the bloke against the wall and then…

Then he climbed the wall with just his fingertips and drug the guy up with him, his head bouncing harshly against the wall all the while.

As soon as they disappeared, Harry groaned and bent his face forward, breathing in Joey’s dog scent and letting his fur hide his face.

 

It wasn’t Harry’s first concussion, but fuck if it didn’t feel shitty anyway.

Chapter Text

Tony put all his thrusters and booster levels into his heels as he flew directly out the window of his laboratory and toward where JARVIS had Harry’s location pulled up on his screen.

JARVIS was also sending Tony all street video coverage of the alleyway Harry was in, but so far it was spotty at best. Whatever thugs cornered his kid had probably done it before, they found a nice and remote place to do it.

This was ‘oh have you heard about your kid being tortured for detention’ all over again. Except now it was some random good samaritan calling Tony and telling him his son had been beaten up in a mugging in the city. And what the hell Harry was doing, wandering the city alone, was anyone’s guess. But Tony figured that was a discussion for another time as he flew just above the buildings and zeroed in on the alley where Harry’s location was pinging.

“Mister Stark, there is a person on the nearby roof,” JARVIS informed Tony as he shot toward the ground.

“Don’t care,” Tony snapped, focusing only on finding his son. “Where the hell… god damnit,” Tony swore heatedly, recognizing the slumped body midway through the alley.

Tony landed quickly and retracted his face shield as he knelt on one knee in front of his son who looked to be out cold, curled over his softly whining dog with his face hidden.

“Harry? Kid?” Tony felt frantic as he pulled back his gloves to grab Harry’s shoulder. “Harry!”

“Hmm?” Harry lifted his face and Tony let out a noise between a scream and whimper. Harry’s lip was busted and bleeding, his jaw shaded with a dark bruise, and his eyes were glassy and unfixed with pinpoint pupils.

“Oh, hi,” Harry said in an airy and raspy way that Tony didn’t like at all.

Tony lightly cupped Harry’s cheek and tilted his face upward to try and gauge just how messed up he was.

“Hi,” Tony said, fighting to sound calm and perfectly level. “What do you say we get you to a doctor?”

“Mm, a vet,” Harry said slowly. “Joey’s hurt.”

“Joey?”

“Arsehole, except don’t call him that.”

Tony glanced down at the dog in Harry’s lap and saw that he looked nearly as put out as Harry did. Why someone would mug a kid and beat up their dog, Tony had no idea. The blood on the dog’s muzzle made Tony hope he’d gotten a good bite of whoever dared touch his son though.

“Okay,” Tony agreed with Harry, “I’m going to pick you and Joey up and we’re going to get home now.”

Harry rolled his head back and closed his eyes.

“I don’t have a home,” he said thickly. “Everything’s fucking ruined.”

Tony couldn’t even process that slurred statement as he reached out carefully and pulled Harry in his arms. As soon as Tony jostled his side, there was a sickening crunch of what sounded like a cracked bone, and Harry’s eyes rolled back in his head before he went completely limp.

Someone was going to pay in blood for that.

“God DAMNIT!” Tony yelled. He tried to be gentle and quick, but the increasing whines of the frantic dog were doing nothing but increasing Tony’s blood pressure. “JARVIS, wake Bruce up, tell him to meet me in his exam room. Open the windows too, I’m flying in.”

“Yes, sir.”

Tony locked his arms around Harry and his dog and shot upward in the sky.

Jesus Christ.

While Tony had been in his lab, having a pity party, his kid was getting his ass kicked by some pricks that were going to regret even looking at Harry when Tony found them.

Tony was going to rip their miserable heads from their bodies and use them for target practice.

 

The night was quiet aside from Tony’s own furious breathing and the dog’s frantic pants. Apparently ‘Joey’ wasn’t a fan of flying. Which sucked for him because Tony wasn’t a fan of wasting time when his son needed medical attention.

 

Bruce was already in his lab/exam room when Tony shot through the windows.

“Put him here,” Bruce ordered him, indicating a recently made exam bed. “What happened?”

“Mugging,” Tony said shortly as he placed Harry on one bed and his dog on the other. “JARVIS, full scan on both of them.”

Bruce waved his hand, pulling up an electronic screen while JARVIS ran a blue light over Harry and the dog both.

“Contusions, abrasions, one fractured rib, and a moderate concussion,” Bruce murmured, reading Harry’s results. “And two broken ribs in the dog.”

Tony wasn’t technically heartless, but he didn’t really give a damn about the dog.

“What’s this?” Tony asked with a furrowed brow. He drew a finger across an unexpected result. “Infection? Harry’s not sick.”

Bruce hummed and squinted at the screen before he pulled his glasses from his shirt pocket and pushed them up on his nose.

“Not that kind of infection.” He grabbed Harry’s left hand and slowly unrolled the white bandage that covered the cuts Tony knew it hid.

“Here it is,” Bruce said. He held Harry’s limp hand up and Tony saw the red and swollen skin. “It’s a minor infection, Tony, I’ll get him on antibiotics.”

Tony jerked his chin in a nod and tried to pretend like he wasn’t seething. His son didn’t even heal properly from the last time someone hurt him before it happened again.

Was it any wonder that Tony wanted to wrap the world in a shield so safe that his kid never had to be hurt again?!

“Something for the pain too,” Tony told Bruce when he went to grab a bag from their stocked cabinet of medication.

Bruce’s hand hesitated over the vials of medication and he glanced at Tony over his shoulder.

“Narcotics and concussions don’t go together great,” he said with a pitying look.

Tony grabbed a silver test tube rack and threw it at the wall, desperate to vent his fear and rage any way he could.

“I DON’T GIVE A DAMN!” he yelled at Bruce. Harry was pale and sweaty just from where Tony could see, and he was sure his ribs and hips were in rough shape if the result of his scan was any indicator. And since it was a perfect read, Tony knew it was the only opinion that counted. “HARRY IS IN PAIN, FIX IT OR GET THE FUCK OUT!”

Bruce, who was long since used to Tony’s fits, sighed and snatched a vial of morphine to go with the penicillin.

“Fine, when he’s high as a kite, don’t complain to me,” Bruce muttered. “Hand me the IV kit.”

Tony complied quickly while he switched his suit off, tossing it to the side.

“Hold his arm,” Bruce said after grabbing a needle from the kit. “Don’t let him move, his veins are small.”

While Tony held Harry’s arm and Bruce quickly inserted the IV needle, Harry’s eyelids fluttered.

“Hey, don’t move,” Tony told Harry while Bruce’s quick hands set up the IV drip. He let go of Harry’s arm and carefully brushed his messy dark hair from his face, cringing at his clammy skin. “How you feeling, kid?”

Harry’s eyes didn’t fully open, but he did turn to look at Tony with a little pucker between his brows.

“Fine,” he said, still sounding as drunk as Clint did after his last concussion. “What’re you doing here? Where’s Siri?”

Tony winced, but it was fair. He’d been thinking it all day that Harry would want Sirius- why wouldn’t he? Sirius and Harry had years more time together, years more history together, a million things more in common.

Blood didn’t make a family, who knew that more than Tony?

“You want me to get him?” Tony offered. He kept his hand on Harry’s face and didn’t know if it was a good sign of progress that Harry didn’t push him away or a bad sign of him being completely out of it.

“No.” Harry blinked heavily and Tony checked the fluids drop in his IV. Harry lifted his hand and touched Tony’s hair before pulling his hand back and dropping it on the bed. “Why’re you here?”

“I told you he’d be high,” Bruce told Tony in an irritating know it all tone. Tony only liked it when he used that tone. He rolled his eyes at Bruce, who was taping up the dog, then looked down where his kid looked genuinely curious.

“I…”

What the fuck was he supposed to say? Why wouldn’t he be there if Harry was hurt? He wasn’t Howard, sending his assistant just to jump his ass over it. Tony liked to think he was a better parent than his dad had been.

He sent a furtive look at Bruce, but Bruce was steadily pretending to not notice the awkward conversation happening. Kind of him, really.

“You’re hurt,” Tony said, bewildered. “You got hurt, did you think I wouldn’t want to be here with you?”

Harry looked so vulnerable, so completely guileless, that Tony could see the answer in his eyes before he even opened his mouth.

Tony sighed and sank to his knees beside Harry’s bed.

“I want to be here,” Tony said plainly. His stomach did an uncountable twist when Harry’s green eyes suddenly looked wet.

“Hey, are you in pain? Bruce! Did you give him pain medicine or not?” Tony yelled, turning to glare accusingly at his friend.

“I’m fine,” Harry said quietly before Bruce could even respond. Tony felt more than useless as a little tear trickled out of the corner of his eye. He didn’t look like he was hurting, but Tony suspected he had a higher pain tolerance than Tony had at his age.

“I’m sorry,” Harry added.

Tony’s brows climbed his forehead and he kept up what he hoped was a soothing motion of brushing Harry’s hair off his face.

“For what?” Tony asked. He thought maybe Harry was apologizing for walking around New York alone, or for forgetting to have JARVIS alert Tony the moment he ran into trouble, or for anything rational. But what Harry said was not rational, or logical, and Tony had no idea how he was meant to deal with it.

“You’re disappointed, right?” Harry asked. He turned his head up to the ceiling and blinked heavily at it. “I’m not the son you wanted.”

 

“Well I’m so fucking sorry I’m not the son you wanted! I’m just a big disappointment, right? Come on, mom’s still young enough, you’ve got time to try again!”

“You will watch your mouth in my home, Anthony!”

“I don’t fucking care about my language, Howard!”

 

Tony sat back on his heels and stared at Harry, speechless.

How was he reliving his childhood with his own son?

This whole time Tony had been patting himself on the back, telling himself he was doing so much better than his dad had, and Harry thought Tony was disappointed in him?

Tony looked around quickly, secretly hoping Bruce would step forward with the right words to say, but he disappeared at some point. The dog blinked at Tony slowly, his big puppy eyes demanding Tony answer his owner.

 

But when Tony turned back to Harry, his eyes were closed and his chest rose and fell in an even motion.

 

Tony had pulled up a chair and listened to the steady beeping of Harry’s vitals while he closed his own eyes and let his mind drift.

There were approximately seven billion questions on his mind and no answers in sight; the worst frustration for any man.

Why didn’t Harry want Sirius? Did he not want him to see him all banged up? Did they have a disagreement? Was that why Harry was out walking the streets by himself?

Who attacked Harry? Who called Tony? Why didn’t they wait with Harry until Tony got there? Granted, it took him less than four minutes to arrive, but still. Did they want no recognition for helping him? They’d refused to give Tony a name on the phone, merely stating that they were ‘taking care of the problem’ but that he should ‘come get Harry because he’s all fucked up’.

There were questions about Ultron and Darth Vader and the bitch in pink, but Tony wasn’t really fixating on that.

“I’m sorry.”

“You’re disappointed, right?”

“I’m not the son you wanted.”

He definitely wasn’t a son Tony expected, but damn if he didn’t love him anyway.

It was a tight pain in Tony’s chest that Harry thought of Tony the same way Tony had thought of Howard. Some cycles were best left broken.

 

After a couple hours of Harry sleeping soundly, the morphine coursing through his veins, the lab door opened and Tony peeked through one eye to see Sirius sliding in.

“Oi, what the fuck happened?” Sirius hissed as he approached the bed. His eyes were wide and he still wore his pajamas. Bruce had probably gotten him, which was irritating as hell.

“Mugging,” Tony said tightly. He eyed Sirius subtly while Sirius studied Harry’s face and the IV hooked up to his arm.

Sirius was… well… he even stood like Harry did. They both had a tendency to stand on the heels of their feet, rocking backwards just slightly. Sirius had one hand fluttering out toward Harry’s feet that were bare after Tony struggled to undress the kid and redress him in a gown. Sirius’ other hand was on his right thigh, tapping his fingers the same way Harry did when he was agitated.

“And you didn’t call me?” Sirius demanded quietly. He glared and Tony and the sarcastic way he twisted his lips to the side and furrowed his brows were also expressions Harry mimicked.

Forget the Avengers, Sirius Black was obviously Harry’s personal hero.

“I should have,” Tony admitted. He sighed heavily and ran a hand through his hair, pushing it back. His eyes skipped away from Sirius’ and landed on Harry’s soft face. “I offered, he said no.”

Sirius pulled his dark wand from his pocket and held it up with a mocking expression.

“So you’d rather Harry suffer instead of just having me heal him?” Sirius scoffed. “Petty isn’t your color, mate.”

Tony was left speechless as Sirius went to work healing Harry’s bruises and lacerations. He…

Had he forgotten that Sirius could instantly heal Harry because magic was still so utterly mind boggling or did he intentionally not think of it because it was just another way that Sirius beat Tony in Harry’s life?

The first made him human, the second made him a monster.

“Mind taking whatever this is out?” Sirius asked, gesturing to the IV hookup.

Tony got up, resigning himself to helping however he could, and gently removed the lines from Harry’s arm and twisted them around the pole.

“His rib is broken,” Tony told Sirius flatly, pointing toward the rib instead of touching it. “The dog too.”

Sirius turned and made a sympathetic face at the dog.

“Poor Joey,” he said quietly. He tapped Harry’s side with his wand and Tony heard the bone snap in place and Harry hiss out a sharp breath just before he went back to sleeping. This time, without the creases between his eyes.

“Figures that you’d know the dog is called Joey, apparently,” Tony said bitterly as he took his seat beside his kid once more.

Sirius was running his wand over the top of the dog and only paused long enough to give Tony a look.

“What’s that supposed to mean?”

“Oh nothing,” Tony said with a bit of unchecked bite to his tone. “I didn’t know the dog had a name besides Asshole, but you did. Just like you got told all about Harry’s life and you are the one he called about his teacher and YOU ARE THE PARENT HE WANTS!”

Sirius stood beside the probably perfectly healed dog and watched as Tony ranted at him. He raised an unimpressed dark brow when Tony finished and looked down at his lap while his chest heaved with the fucking unfairness of his son being so difficult to win over because he had an adult he loved already.

And it certainly wasn’t Tony.

“All done there?” Sirius scoffed. “For a genius, you’re bloody daft, aren’t you?”

Tony snapped his head up and opened his mouth to argue, but Sirius cut him off.

“Harry loves you,” Sirius told him. He hopped back on the bed with the dog and let it drop its head on his lap so he could pet it while he spoke. “But—”

Tony flattened his lips in an unhappy line. There was always a but. ‘Harry loves you, BUT he loves Sirius more’. ‘Harry loves you, BUT he also hates you’.

“—Harry doesn’t know how to express love like a normal person.”

“What?” Tony shook his head and tried to shoo away his own thoughts so that he could take in what Sirius was saying with his solemn expression and pitying eyes.

“Harry told you he loves me?” Tony asked, sounding as hopeful as a kid. He thought - before Hogwarts, before Ultron, before Sirius - that Harry at least liked him, but… but Tony would rather have his son’s love.

Sirius’ eyes went soft and he shook his head at Tony. “Of course he didn’t say it like that, he said he wanted to earn your love. And why would he do that if he didn’t love you?”

Tony leaned his chair back and looked away from Sirius so he could study the face of the kid that looked so much like him.

“You’re disappointed, right? I’m not the son you wanted.”

“He’s so much like me…” Tony said softly to himself as he reached out and stroked Harry’s hair. Of course Tony’s kid would see parental love as something that he had to work toward, to earn. Tony hadn’t achieved it when he’d been a kid, and he didn’t know it wasn’t a thing to be achieved until he’d gotten Harry.

Harry taught Tony that some parents just loved their kid no matter what; which meant that Tony apparently needed to teach it to Harry.

“Poor bastard,” Sirius snorted. “What’d you think? That he didn’t want you anymore now that I’m here?”

Tony said nothing, which only prompted Sirius to snort again.

“Peas in a pod,” he quipped brightly. “Look, mate, I’m about as terrible with the whole relationship bit as the rest of you obviously are, but Harry’s easy, alright? Just tell him you love him, tell him he doesn’t have to fight Voldemort for you to be proud of him, and for the love of God get yourselves in therapy and sort yourselves out.”

Tony rolled his eyes when Sirius sauntered out of the lab, whistling a jaunty tune.

 

It wasn’t that he was wrong, it was that Tony wasn’t used to everyone else knowing more than he did.

 

Tony had managed to sleep a couple hours before Harry began tossing and turning on his bed, waking up in a flurry.

“Hey, hey, you’re fine,” Tony said quickly, yanking his hand away from Harry’s head where it had been resting. “You’re in Bruce’s lab.”

Harry sat up, ignoring Tony’s half-hearted request that he stay laying down, and blinked around the room filled with equipment and various experiments Bruce had been working on. His eyes were frantic as they flicked around, not resting until they landed on the dog.

“Joey,” Harry breathed. The dog yipped and did a spectacular leap from its bed to Harry’s, landing in his lap where it immediately began licking Harry’s face.

Tony watched and felt ashamed at the envy he felt at the easy way Harry related more to a dog than he did Tony. If Sirius was right and Harry did love Tony, surely Tony would sense it somehow.

“What happened?” Harry asked, finally pushing the dog away to blink at Tony. He scowled and pinched the green hospital gown he wore irritably. “I don’t think I had this in my dresser.”

Tony grinned crookedly and relaxed in his seat. If Harry was up for being a smartass again, then Sirius must have done a hell of a job healing him. His face didn’t look any worse for the wear, anyway, it was free of the marks that had covered it and only the dirt remained proof that someone had gone after him.

“You had a nasty concussion, I’m not surprised you don’t remember,” Tony said. “What’s the last thing you do remember?”

Harry’s lips twisted to the side and he furrowed his brows together in concentration.

“Er… I went for a walk… and then…” Harry’s eyes unfocused then focused on Tony and his face darkened. “How’d I get here?”

Tony rolled his neck, working out the kink and stalling just a smidge.

“You got in a fight,” Tony hedged, giving the kid the benefit of the doubt. “Someone used your phone—”

“The red skinned bloke!” Harry said abruptly.

Tony raised a skeptical brow at his son. Sure, New York had all sorts of weirdos wandering around, but a guy with red skin seemed more likely to be a figment of a concussion.

“I don’t know,” Tony admitted. “Someone called me and said you needed help so I brought you back here and Sirius healed you.”

It burnt like acid on his tongue to admit that Sirius had been the one to save the day - again - but Tony wasn’t going to lie to Harry either.

“Oh.” Harry nodded and then began twisting his fingers in the blanket that covered his legs. “Er… where’s Sirius at now?”

Tony was proud that he kept his face perfectly impassive when he answered.

“Upstairs, do you want me to call him?”

Harry squinted at Tony, a cloud of confusion in his green eyes.

“Don’t you want to?” Harry turned the question back on him, confusing Tony now.

Why did it always feel like they were speaking two different languages?

Tony ran a hand through his hair again, feeling frustrated at the damned barrier that seemed to linger between him and his son.

“Look, plain English here, I don’t want Sirius here right now, but if you do then I’ll call him,” Tony told Harry bluntly. “So do you?”

Harry leaned back against the pillows piled up at the head of his bed and gave Tony a heavy look as he stared directly in his eyes, searching for something that Tony couldn’t begin to guess at.

“No,” Harry said softly, his usual sarcasm gone. “I’d rather have you here.”

“Alright then.” Tony smiled and felt a little weight shift off his chest. “I suppose I’ll stay.”

Notes:

    Welcome to… Peter’s POV! 🥳

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

Wednesday, September 19

Peter bounced on the balls of his feet outside his school as he waited with Gwen for Harry’s car to pull up.

“I cannot believe you don’t have your camera,” Gwen scoffed. “It’s Harry’s first day at Midtown and we aren’t even going to document it?”

Peter rolled his eyes at her, he couldn’t exactly explain why he knew Harry would rather not have his photo taken, could he?

When Peter saw Harry on Monday night - while he’d been harmlessly swinging through town - he looked terrible. His face had been swollen, his jaw split, and even his eyes weren’t real bright. Peter figured that by the time he woke up the next morning he’d probably be black and blue.

He was surprised Harry was coming to school at all, if Peter could milk a concussion and skip school, he totally would.

Not that he could anymore, since his injuries seemed to heal much more quickly than they should.

Thanks radioactive spider at Oscorp.

“Here he comes!” Gwen squealed. A dark SUV turned the corner and Peter saw the Stark plates on the front that had the other students arriving at school slowing down to gawk at the car.

Peter was excited to have his best friend - boyfriend? - back in the US and going to his school, but he also felt on edge about the whole thing.

Harry sometimes seemed like he was from a totally different world than Peter. He didn’t know anything past a basic 5th grade level of education, he didn’t know any sort of pop cultural references, but the worst part was when Harry was around people and suddenly his hot sarcasm turned into sharp and defensive barbs.

Honestly, Peter thought Harry probably had a shit life before he got reunited with his biological dad. Not that Harry would admit it, but as long as Tony Stark was making Harry’s life better rather than worse, then Peter didn’t mind Harry keeping his secrets.

It wasn’t like Peter wasn’t keeping one from Harry.

The SUV stopped in front of the school and Peter could hear the conversation happening inside the car.

“…laptop?”

“Got it.”

“Cellphone?”

“Yes.”

“Laser?”

“You want me to shoot someone?”

“Yes.”

“I’ve got it.”

“Alright, have a good day, Happy will be here when school gets out and I’ll see you when you get home.”

“Okay…”

“Hey, I love you, kid. I’m proud of you.”

“… right. See you.”

Peter grinned at Harry’s awkward goodbye with his dad and then held his breath when the car door opened and—

What the fuck?

Harry stepped out of the car, and Peter’s jaw dropped. Harry looked good, real good, in a pair of jeans that hung off his hips and his dark leather jacket that gave him a dangerous vibe. His hair was as messy as always and his bangs hung over his forehead, covering part of the mirrored sunglasses he wore.

“You’re soo lucky,” Gwen sighed dramatically with a hand over her chest. “Harry’s so cute.”

Harry was cute; all the way from his black converse sneakers to his dark hair.

But he was also missing bruises, cuts, and the shortness of breath that Peter expected him to have.

“Harry!” Gwen waved at Harry, who had stopped and developed a bead of sweat on his forehead at the crowd of gawking students. “Over here!”

Harry looked toward them and Peter smiled when Harry’s shoulders relaxed a little bit. It always sent a thrill through Peter to see someone so charismatic, so funny and sarcastic, someone so unique and interesting who lit up every time he saw Peter.

Peter didn’t have a lot of people who looked at him like that. Sure, he had friends, Gwen and Harry Osborn; he had his aunt and uncle, who loved him, but nobody ever looked at Peter like they were just happy to see him.

“You’re my hero.”

And Peter had definitely never been someone’s hero before.

“I’m so happy to see you!” Gwen cried. She reached forward and tugged Harry in a hug. “Peter’s being shy, give him a moment,” she whispered.

“People are staring,” Harry whispered back before quickly pulling out of Gwen’s embrace and hiking his burgundy bag higher on his shoulder.

“Hey,” Peter gave Harry a half-smile that Harry easily returned. “You look good.”

Too good. Like he hadn’t gotten his ass kicked a couple days ago by some shitbags that Peter had - maybe - been a little hard on before he’d dropped them off all webbed up at the police station.

Harry’s cheeks turned pink and he quickly turned his head, looking around at the crowd of students watching them.

“So this is high school?” Harry asked, his voice scratchy and judging. He flicked his sunglasses up on his head and Peter didn’t see so much as a shadow where his eye should have been bruised.

“This is the front of a high school,” Peter grinned. “Come on, Bright Eyes, I’ll give you the grand tour before the bell rings.”

“We’ll give you the grand tour,” Gwen corrected Peter. She stepped between them and linked her arms with them both. “As your class president, it’s my duty to welcome you to Midtown High.”

“Are you my class president?” Harry asked her while Gwen breezed past the students crowding the front walkway and led them in the school. “I thought you were juniors? Tony said I’m a… soft-more?”

“Sophomore,” Peter corrected him with a wink behind Gwen’s back. “But Gwen takes her job real seriously, she introduces all the freshmen and everything.”

“I don’t,” Gwen said with a roll of her eyes and flick of her hair. She gave Harry a warm smile, “Only the important new people.”

Harry’s eyebrows raised and his nostrils flared a little. “Because I’m Tony Stark’s kid?”

“Nope.” Gwen laid her head on Harry’s shoulder for a moment. “Because you’re one of my very best friends.”

Peter saw the ice in Harry’s eyes melt and tucked Gwen’s arm in his more securely. Gwen was a pain in his ass, but she did know how to make a guy feel welcome.

They gave Harry a quick tour of the building, pointing out the classrooms and the cafeteria. Peter was disappointed that they wouldn’t share a hallway, but the lockers were divided by grade. If they weren’t, then Parker and Potter would be pretty damn close together.

By the time the bell rang for first period, Harry had a schedule and map in hand, and a terrified look in his eyes. They only shared two classes- Spanish I in third period and PE in seventh, and Peter felt for Harry as everyone eyed him warily in the hallways. He was going to get swarmed and there was nothing Peter could do to help him.

“High school has to be way easier than mysterious boarding schools,” Peter murmured reassuringly as he walked Harry to his first class. “Just, you know, be yourself or something and it’ll be fine.”

Harry gave Peter a weak smirk, one that wasn’t his usual playful look, and shrugged.

“People don’t tend to like it when I’m myself,” Harry told him factually. “Maybe I should pretend to be you.”

Peter chuckled self-deprecatingly and shook his head.

“Nah, you’re way more interesting than I am,” he said honestly. Even with his new crazy powers, Harry was a dark little mystery that drove Peter wild.

Harry smiled more easily than crinkled his nose when he turned to face his English 10 classroom.

“Wish me luck,” he said flatly.

Peter blew him a dramatic kiss as he backed away to get to his own classroom.

“GOOD LUCK, BRIGHT EYES!” he yelled from halfway down the hall. “MAKE LOTS OF NEW FRIENDS!”

Harry sent him a death glare and flipped him off, but there was a little glimmer in his eyes before he turned and entered his classroom.

Peter smiled to himself and wondered how much more interesting life would be with Harry at his school.

 

It didn’t take long for the gossip to start.

 

Peter was hounded in first hour by kids who never even talked to him before.

“Who’s the new kid?”

“Is he really a Stark?”

“I heard he’s an Avenger!”

“Are you two, like, together?”

The last one was the only one Peter bothered answering.

“Yes,” he told Brittany firmly. “We are.”

Brittany sniffed and turned back to face the front of the class.

Peter wasn’t a jealous guy, really, he wanted Harry to have as many friends as he wanted. It was just… Peter would rather be the one that made Harry light up and laugh and blush. And - oddly enough - Peter would rather not have muscular guys with smirky little faces and silver hair cuddling Harry while they slept off a few drinks.

“You’re my hero.”

Peter wanted to be Harry’s hero. A tall order, considering his dad was Tony fucking Stark.

 

Peter got his chance to be Harry’s hero between second and third period when his brand-new super sensitive hearing picked up his favorite British accent running his mouth.

“You knocked the bloody books from my hand, you pick them up!”

“Or what? Going to call daddy and cry?”

Peter frowned and slammed his locker shut and turned toward Harry’s hall quickly as he recognized Flash’s voice. He quickly dropped his board from his bag to the ground and used it to weave in and out of the students clogging up the hallway.

Harry couldn’t catch a break, man. First some dicks in the alley, now Flash? Harry needed a family of superheroes honestly.

And maybe a boyfriend with some cool powers too.

Peter skid around the corner of the hall and kicked his board to his hands then slid it back in his bag just before he heard a slam and a hiss.

“Wow, look! Everyone’s so impressed by you,” Harry snapped. Flash had him by the front of his tshirt and was glaring in his face. “Perhaps if you hit me you’ll really look like a man.”

“Don’t you dare,” Peter said, pushing through the crowd of students when Flash looked tempted to do just that. “Flash, drop him.”

Flash turned and laughed in Peter’s face.

“Or what?” he sneered.

Peter sighed and rolled his neck.

“Or this,” he said before reaching out, quick as he could, and snatching Flash by the back of his letter jacket and yanking him hard.

Too hard.

Flash went flying backward and Peter ducked when Flash flew right over his head and smacked the lockers on the other wall with a hard smack just before slumping to the floor.

Peter groaned quietly and looked from where Flash was out cold to where Harry was on his own two feet staring at Peter with wide eyes.

“PETER PARKER!”

“Guess I won’t be sitting by you in class,” Peter joked weakly to Harry while their classmates began scattering and the principal stormed down the hall. “Later.”

Harry lifted a hand in acknowledgment just before the principal clamped his hand on Peter’s shoulder and turned him toward his office while the teachers attended to Flash.

Principal Rogers shoved Peter on the chair outside his office.

“Sit,” he instructed him. “Don’t move. I’m calling your parents.”

“Better use long distance,” Peter told him seriously. “They’ve been missing for ten years!”

Principal Rogers scowled and Peter smirked before he curled his legs up in the chair and rested his cheek on his knees.

Uncle Ben was going to be pissed.

 

“What the hell is wrong with you?” Uncle Ben demanded an hour later when they left the office together. “You threw a boy across the hall?”

“He was being a jerk,” Peter told him. “He was bullying Harry.”

“Oh?” Uncle Ben turned and frowned in Peter’s face. “And that gives you the right to throw him around? Humiliate him?” Uncle Ben shook his head and looked as disappointed in Peter as he ever had. “You’re a better man than that, Peter. I know it, because I raised you.”

“Yeah?” Peter felt his walls rising and his throat closing. “Maybe I got all my bad qualities from my dad then.”

Because God knew Peter didn’t get his temper from his Uncle Ben or his Aunt May. Nature versus nurture, and nature won every time.

“Don’t start that now,” Uncle Ben told him. He wagged a finger in Peter’s face. “Be home by six tonight, you can walk your aunt home from work so I can stay late to make up for this stunt. Got it?”

Peter nodded and Uncle Ben leaned in closer.

“Hey, got it?” he repeated.

“I got it,” Peter snapped, pushing his uncle’s finger out of his face.

“Six o’clock.”

“Six o’clock,” Peter repeated.

Uncle Ben looked over Peter’s shoulder and nodded.

“Harry, good to see you.”

Peter whipped around and saw Harry standing in the hall with a sheepish look on his face.

“Hello, sir,” Harry said politely in his odd way. “I’m sorry if I got Peter in trouble.”

“Oh, no, Peter does that all on his own,” Uncle Ben said. He pointed at Peter one more time, “Six o’clock, Peter.”

“Six o’clock,” Peter said. He gave Uncle Ben a two fingered salute and then turned to Harry while Uncle Ben left.

“I’m sorry,” Harry repeated. He leaned against the lockers and had his head tilted against the blue metal while he looked genuinely remorseful for something that wasn’t his fault.

“For what?” Peter leaned against the lockers in front of Harry, only a few inches separating them. “For Flash being a dick?”

Harry flashed a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “You’d think I’d occasionally learn to shut my mouth, but apparently I’m rather daft.”

“Mm, I like hearing you talk,” Peter laughed. He raised his hand and cupped Harry’s cheek lightly. He ran his thumb across his sharp cheekbone and felt a thrill go through him when the skin pinkened beneath his touch.

“You’re my hero.”

“Hey can I ask you a question?” Peter asked Harry.

Harry’s lips curled up at the edges and he nodded.

“Does your dad have some sort of super serum that heals injuries instantly?”

Harry stiffened under Peter’s touch and the warmth in his eyes closed off quickly.

“No,” he said just as quick. “Why?”

Peter bit his lip and tilted his head to the side. He didn’t understand why Harry would lie about it, but he also didn’t understand how he showed up at school, perfectly fine, when he’d been busted and fainting in Iron Man’s arms two days ago.

“Nevermind,” Peter said. Harry probably had loads of secrets, just like Peter apparently did. The bell rang, startling them both, and Peter dropped his hand when class doors began opening.

“I gotta go,” Peter told Harry. “I’m suspended for two days.”

“Where you going?” Harry asked him.

Peter shrugged. “Might go skate,” he said evasively. He’d been planning on going to Doctor Connor’s place, see if he knew anymore about the spider that bit him. It was a long shot, but Peter was desperate to know if he’d always feel… everything. Or, worse, if there were any fatal side effects to the bite.

It wasn’t that Peter was overly attached to life, but he’d rather not die before losing his virginity at least.

Harry hiked his bag up on his shoulder and gave Peter a small and uncharacteristically shy smile.

“Want some company?” he offered.

Peter looked at his earnest expression and felt his insides bubbling happily.

“Alright,” he laughed. “Come on, let’s bail.”

 

Peter was laughing his head off at Harry as he awkwardly skated down the sidewalk on his board beside him.

“You didn’t practice at all at your school, did you?” Peter asked playfully. He shot a hand out to steady Harry the instant he saw him wobbling and Harry huffed at him.

“Do you have any fucking idea how many staircases are in my old school?” Harry asked. “I’d look like a prat - a prat with a broken neck.”

Peter made a chicken sound at Harry and tilted his chin to the steps for the convenience store they passed.

“When I die, be sure to tell Tony it was your fault,” Harry quipped.

“Oh yeah, I can see the headlines: ‘Tony Stark’s Son Killed by a Spill from Three Steps’.” Peter laughed again and slid his board to a stop so he could watch Harry carefully climb up the steps and hold his board at his side as he eyed the concrete stairs nervously.

Harry stood on the edge of his board and then pushed off. Peter darted forward and caught Harry just before he fell.

“Fuck, you’re fast,” Harry griped. He yanked his arm from Peter’s grip but then dropped his hand and linked their fingers together for a moment.

“I’ve got excellent reflexes,” Peter bragged with a wink. “Come on, Bright Eyes, I’ll buy you a coke and you can tell me more about this horrible school with the deadly staircases.”

Harry carefully slid his skateboard in his backpack then followed Peter in the store.

“It’s nothing special,” Harry protested. He knocked Peter’s hand aside when Peter tried to pay for their cokes. “What’s the point of Tony being rich and annoying if I don’t waste his money?”

“Fair enough,” Peter shrugged. He opened the door for Harry when they moved back outside and Peter led Harry to a couple of crates just behind the shop. “So? Let’s hear about it, Bright Eyes.”

“Nothing much to tell,” Harry said. He sat on the crate and his eyes flickered anxiously around the alley, causing Peter to mentally smack himself in the face.

Oh, great idea, Peter, bring Harry to an alley to hang out, like he didn’t just get beat up in one less than forty-eight hours ago.

Not that Harry looked like he’d gotten beat up.

“Oh, hey, you wanna go sit somewhere else?” Peter offered. “We can move to the skatepark or somewhere sunnier.”

“I’m fine.” Harry leaped off his crate when a buzzing sound started going off.

“It’s your phone,” Peter told him. “I guess your dad got a call?”

Harry didn’t seem too concerned about skipping his first day of school, but Peter was skeptical. Most parents weren’t real thrilled when their kid played hooky.

“Nope. Er…” Harry glanced at the phone and Peter only briefly saw a partial name, something with an H, before Harry moved to the other side of the alley and answered his call.

“Hey,” Harry grinned in the phone. “My…” Harry’s eyes flickered to Peter and Peter waggled his brows at him.

“My friend is here,” Harry told whoever he was chatting with.

“Your friend?” a girl squeaked. “Ooh, Harry! Can we meet him?”

“Yeah, Harry, can they meet your friend?” Peter asked Harry, smirking at him.

He knew they hadn’t really put a label on their relationship, but Peter kind of assumed the kissing and holding hands and flirting made him something more than a friend.

“You’re my hero.”

But then again, Peter wasn’t in a rush for Harry to call it anything he wasn’t ready for.

“Do not be weird,” Harry hissed in the phone before slowly making his way back to his makeshift crate seat beside Peter. “Hermione, Ron, meet Peter.”

Peter grinned when Harry had to put his face - his perfectly bruise free face - right beside his so they could both see in the phone.

There was a girl, Hermione, Peter supposed, with wild brown hair, dark brown skin, and a bright white smile aimed at Peter. Then a boy, Ron, with milky white skin, more freckles than Peter could begin to count - 412, a part of his mind counted easily - and wavy red hair who was not smiling at Peter. He was staring at him with narrowed blue eyes that looked suspicious as hell.

Both of them had on identical red ties and black jackets, but Peter couldn’t see any further than their shoulders to see what else they wore at the obviously rich, private school.

“It’s lovely to meet you!” Hermione gushed with her friendly smile. “Harry’s told us so much about you!”

“Has he?” Peter shouldered Harry playfully and grinned at the girl. “You’ll have to tell me what he’s said.”

“He says quite a bit in his sleep,” Ron said with a smirk at Harry, whose red face was evident even on the phone screen.

“I do not,” Harry spat furiously. “Shut up, Ron.”

“Mate,” Ron sighed and shook his head at Harry, “you talk in your sleep all the time. ‘Oh, Peter, I love that song’,” Ron said in a falsely high tone with a flutter of his lashes. “‘Oh, Peter, I fancy youuu’.”

“Hermione!” Harry yelped. “Make him shut the hell up!”

Peter laughed while Hermione swatted Ron on the shoulder.

“Quit it,” Hermione told him before turning back to the boys. “We miss you, Harry! I can’t wait for Christmas break! I’ve already asked my parents and they said yes!”

“Mum too,” Ron added. “She wanted me to stay at Grimmauld with everyone, but I bugged her until she said yes.”

“Brilliant!” Harry’s eyes lit up with genuine excitement that Peter didn’t see often. “Oh, uh, I haven’t asked Tony yet, but…”

“But he let Harry get drunk and steal cars all weekend, so I bet he’ll say yes,” Peter cut in when Harry trailed off like he was prone to do sometimes.

“You got drunk?” Hermione asked while Ron laughed and said, “Wicked!”

“Oh, damn, Tony’s calling,” Harry lied. “Miss you guys, tell the twins and Ginny I say hello.”

“Bye, Harry! Love you!” Hermione cried. “Peter, it was lovely to meet you! We’ll see you in December!”

“If you break Harry’s heart I’ll kill you,” Ron said cheerfully while his hard eyes took some of the joke out of his words. “Bye.”

“They’re… funny,” Harry said slowly with a sideways glance at Peter before he pocketed his phone. “Sorry.”

Peter yawned casually and stretched his arm out, letting it rest on Harry’s shoulders.

“For what?” Peter asked him. “Having friends who like you enough to threaten me?”

Harry sighed and his muscles were tense under Peter’s arm, but he didn’t pull away any.

“I haven’t told them much about you,” Harry said slowly. “I… I dunno, I haven’t really told them that I… that I’m—”

“Gay?” Peter offered easily. “It’s not a dirty word.”

Harry’s shoulders curled up, but he still didn’t shake Peter’s arm off. His heart was racing though, Peter could hear it clear as anything.

“That’s because your uncle likes you,” Harry said, sounding bitter and hurt. “Mine wouldn’t brag about me if he knew I fancied blokes, he’d just- just pummel me.” Harry huffed out an angry laugh. “I suppose my parents wouldn’t have minded, since they were apparently all about free love, or whatever.”

Peter took Harry’s words at face value. Harry didn’t usually beat around the bush, even if he was occasionally evasive as hell. If he said his uncle would have ‘pummeled’ him, then Peter believed him.

And boy did he want to have a talk with Harry’s uncle.

“I don’t know what my parents would think,” Peter admitted quietly. “I don’t know anything about them really.”

Harry lifted his hand to lace his fingers with Peter’s, holding his arm at an awkward angle as Peter’s hand had been laying on his shoulder.

“Here’s to being orphans,” Harry said sarcastically. “At least we’ll never be disappointments.”

Peter laughed a little at Harry’s cynical optimism and tilted his head to lean against Harry’s.

“Yeah,” he agreed, “there is that. Except, of course, you’re not an orphan.”

“Mm, touché,” Harry said. “I think it was easier when I was though.”

“Really?” Peter asked curiously. If he found out that one of his parents had survived the plane crash, came back for him, he’d be…

Really fucking overwhelmed, actually.

“I dunno, Tony’s alright,” Harry said. He ducked from beneath Peter’s arm and jumped to his feet. “C’mon, we should go do something before I have to go meet up with Happy.”

Peter debated quickly. He could offer to show Harry his new powers, take him swinging through the alleys or climbing up walls, but… but Harry’s dad was Tony fucking Stark, and he already did crazy shit like spying on Harry’s texts.

And Peter would rather not have his life ripped upside down anymore if Tony found out his secret and tried to experiment on him, or induct him in his band of heroes, or (probably the worst case scenario) decide Peter was too dangerous to be with his son.

“Sure,” Peter grinned. “Come on, let’s go see if we can’t make you a staircase skating pro.”

 

Peter and Harry screwed around for the rest of the afternoon. They didn’t do much, mostly just hung out and skated some, walked some, and talked a little.

Harry told Peter about Hermione and Ron. Apparently Hermione was a bossy genius and Ron was Harry’s first ever friend.

Peter told Harry about his oldest friend, Harry Osborn, and how they only got to hang out in the summers because he also went to a boarding school. Though, Harry Osborn’s showed up on Google, while Harry Stark’s did not.

They talked a little about their goals for the future, Peter wanted to do something with photography or genetic research like his dad had done, Harry had no idea what he wanted to do.

Eventually though, Peter had to walk Harry back to the school so he could meet up with his dad‘s driver.

“Today was better than I thought it would be,” Harry told him as they approached the school. “I sort of thought it would suck, honestly.”

Peter grinned at him. “Well you didn’t really stick around much for the education.”

Harry batted his lashes innocently. “What do you mean? I’ve learned loads today. Watch!”

Peter laughed loudly when Harry jumped up the stairs and then skated down them smoothly. Peter clapped and then egged Harry to take a bow.

“I’m so proud,” Peter said, swiping beneath his eyes happily. “You’re such a good friend.”

Harry paused and then ducked beneath the branches of the willow tree that sat in the front lawn of the school.

“Do you want to be friends?” Harry called.

Peter ducked beneath the branches as well and smiled when Harry hid behind the trunk and he had to twist to the side of it.

“And if I want to be more than friends?” Peter teased him.

“You’re my hero.”

Harry’s head poked out on one side of the trunk and he peered at Peter with his bright green eyes that were so open Peter felt his nerves in his own chest.

“Do you?” Harry asked him.

Peter ducked his head and put his mouth close to Harry’s.

“Not at all,” Peter whispered. “I really hate spending time with you.”

“Yeah?” Harry challenged him, lowering his own voice. “Why do you keep doing it then?”

Peter let his lips brush Harry’s lightly then pulled back when Harry started to lean into him.

“Because I’m such a good friend,” Peter teased him.

Harry’s pupils dilated and Peter probably never would have noticed it if it weren’t for his heightened senses.

“Do you- do you want to be more than friends?” Harry asked. He leaned toward Peter and Peter playfully brushed his lips against Harry’s before ducking away again.

“What? Like best friends?” Peter asked. He stuck his head on the other side of the trunk and laughed when Harry twisted his head toward him. “BFF’s?” he joked.

Harry’s eyebrows pinched together in the middle, causing his nose to crinkle adorably.

“What’s BFF’s mean?” Harry asked as he moved his face back to Peter’s.

“Best friends forever,” Peter told him.

Harry didn’t look amused at all, he actually suddenly looked sad.

“Is that what we are?” Harry asked softly. “Just friends?”

Peter couldn’t take the little vulnerable note in Harry’s voice and he quickly grabbed him by his jacket collar and pulled him in for a long and heated kiss that left them both breathless.

“Hey, Harry?”

“Hmm?”

Peter grinned at him and ran his hand through Harry’s soft and wild hair.

“Do you want to be my boyfriend?”

Harry smiled and his eyes sparkled as he looked up at Peter’s.

“I’ll think about it,” Harry said with a laugh. “Later, Parker!”

Peter stood beneath the branches of the tree with a shocked expression. Surely Harry was kidding. That thing between them was mutual, wasn’t it?

Ding!

Peter grabbed his phone automatically. He glanced at the screen and saw he already had a text from Harry.

Yes.

Yes.

“You’re my hero.”

“YES!” Peter whooped. “YESSS!”

Peter did a backflip and smacked his face on a branch, which really only made him laugh harder.

YES.

Peter was on cloud nine the entire time he skated toward Doctor Connor’s house.

Nothing could dash his happiness.

 

And, after helping Doctor Connor figure out the formula for genetic regeneration, Peter was in even higher spirits while he made his way back home in the dark.

 

Then he saw Uncle Ben sitting on the porch and suddenly remembered his promise to walk Aunt May home from the bus stop.

“I’m so sorry, Aunt May,” Peter said as his uncle led him in the house. “I just got caught up in… stuff,” he finished lamely.

Aunt May, the more forgiving of the two, uncrossed her arms and opened them in an offer for a hug.

“You don’t have to apologize,” she told Peter after he let her give him a quick embrace. It only heightened his guilt that she so easily forgave him. “Honestly, I can walk home myself.”

Peter thought of the guys that attacked Harry and felt ten times worse. That could have been Aunt May, a defenseless old lady, getting mugged and beaten in a dirty alley.

“You will not defend him,” Uncle Ben told her firmly. “Peter was irresponsible and he needs to own up to it.”

“I did!” Peter said irritably. “I said I’m sorry, what? You want me to throw myself on the floor and beg for forgiveness?”

Uncle Ben put a finger in Peter’s face again, giving him a look that was equal parts disappointed and annoyed.

“You listen here,” he said, “you are so much like your father. And your father was a good man, but he had a strict code of doing good things when he could. It’s called being responsible, Peter.”

Peter was so sick of being compared to the man that he didn’t know. The man that didn’t stick around to explain himself or leave behind any information for a son who might go looking for him one day. All Peter had for his father was an empty grave and a headstone that said he was a good father.

“That’s great,” Peter said hatefully, “amazing, really. So where is he? Huh?”

“What?” Uncle Ben pulled back and frowned.

“Where is he?” Peter repeated. He felt his eyes sting, but he ignored it. “Where is my dad? Was it not his responsibility to be here to tell me this himself?”

Uncle Ben looked toward Aunt May, but she had a hand over her chest and a look of devastation on her soft face.

“Come on,” Uncle Ben said, “how dare you?”

“How dare I?” Peter was so angry he could have laughed.

Richard Parker was the ghost that haunted their house and Peter was sick of being compared to a man who dumped his kid with his brother then disappeared into the night like a criminal.

“HOW DARE YOU?” Peter demanded brokenly. He was sick of hearing what a good man his dad was, he was an ideal that Peter could never hope to live up to.

Peter was going to eclipse him in every way.

Peter turned on his heel and stormed from the house. He felt suffocated by the way that everyone pretended like Peter wasn’t the kid left behind that night. He slammed the door behind him and heard it shatter when he was already halfway down the sidewalk.

“I’ll pay for that,” Peter yelled to his aunt and uncle. He hunched his shoulders and picked up the pace when their worried shouts followed him.

He needed space, not consoled that ‘of course his parents loved him’.

If they loved him, why did Peter feel so abandoned by them?

If they loved him, why would they leave him?

 

Peter debated about sending Harry a text as he walked in the corner store to grab a drink. He probably could, Harry would let him crash at his fancy apartment in Stark Tower. Peter could tell him about the fight with his family, Harry would sympathize.

For someone with the most relaxed dad in the world, Harry seemed to understand Peter’s unhappiness like a kindred spirit.

Peter didn’t text him though, he was too angry. He needed to vent off some of his anger, walk it off, then go apologize to his aunt and uncle. He knew they loved him, but they didn’t understand him. They didn’t understand how Peter sometimes felt like that little kid being dropped off on his relative’s doorstep like a heavy burden.

Maybe his parents would have came back, if they lived.

It was the only proof Peter carried that his parents were really dead despite the lack of concrete evidence.

If they were alive, they’d come back - right?

Right?

Peter snapped off at the store clerk who refused to sell him a fucking chocolate milk because he was two cents short. Where was common kindness? He nearly threw the drink in his face and only stopped at the last moment. He just dropped the drink on the counter and rolled his eyes.

It was perfect karma that the guy behind Peter in line snagged the cash from the drawer. Peter saw him as he was leaving, but the guy winked at Peter and tossed him his drink so Peter shrugged and gave the guy a nod.

Fuck that store clerk, asshole deserved to get robbed.

 

Peter was nearly a block away when he heard the shouts from the clerk as he chased after the guy that ripped him off.

“Hey! Kid! Grab him!” the clerk yelled when the robber jogged past Peter.

Peter could have.

He could have grabbed him easily and saved the day.

“Who? Me?” Peter turned and gave the clerk a wide eyed look of innocence. “Sorry, it’s against store policy,” he drawled sarcastically. “Asshole,” he mumbled.

The clerk shoved past him as he chased the robber and Peter ducked his head. It wasn’t his job to chase down some dude just because he ripped off the convenience store. One spider bite didn’t make Peter some hero, and that clerk was a prick anyway.

He smirked a little and took a long drink of his chocolate milk when the clerk began yelling at bystanders to ‘grab that criminal’. Bystanders wouldn’t get involved, they never did.

People just watched tragedies, they didn’t intervene.

 

Until one did.

 

Peter’s head snapped up when he heard a familiar voice yell out.

 

BANG!

 

Peter’s heart stopped.

 

He looked to where the scruffy bearded robber ran off, the scent of gun smoke following him. Then his eyes moved toward the body now slumped on the ground.

 

No.

 

Peter ran, but it was too late.

 

“UNCLE BEN!”

 

Peter grabbed Uncle Ben’s hand and tried to stop the blood that was flowing from his chest—

 

He was looking for you.

 

You could have stopped this.

 

—and felt his own chest crack wide open when Uncle Ben looked at him while he drew his last breath

 

“You’re my hero.”

Peter was nobody’s hero.

Chapter Text

Friday, September 21

Harry held an umbrella in one hand and Peter’s hand in the other.

The skies were crying heavily, but not nearly as heavily as Peter was.

The two of them stood in the rain in the graveyard for an hour after Peter’s uncle was buried, forgoing the ‘celebration of life’ lunch that was happening back inside the funeral home.

Harry stared at the handsome grey headstone and let his eyes blur and his mind unfocus while Peter cried beside him.

Harry was lost in the past—

“You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father. A Muggle and a fool…very like your dear mother. But they both had their uses, did they not?”

He imagined Peter was lost to the ‘what if’s’—

What if his uncle hadn’t died?

What if his aunt had been the one to follow him to the store?

Truthfully, Harry didn’t know what Peter was truly thinking as he’d been quiet about the entire incident. All Harry knew was what his Aunt May had told him when she called him Tuesday after school.

Harry didn’t expect to see Peter there, since he was still suspended, but May Parker’s phone call had been a shock.

“Is this Harry?”

Harry frowned at the quivering and soft female voice coming from a number he didn’t recognize.

“Yes?”

The woman had released an alarming sob. “Dear, I’m so sorry to bother you, but I think Peter could use a friend...”

When Harry asked Happy to take him to Peter’s instead of home, he’d only had to step inside and see the look in Mrs Parker’s face to know what happened. She looked like Cedric’s parents had when Harry tried to give them the tournament winnings, like her entire world had been ripped apart.

Harry had ran up the stairs and burst in Peter’s room and felt his chest ache when he saw the look of abject misery on his face.

“My uncle,” Peter whispered, “he’s gone.”

Peter had opened his arms and Harry had climbed up on his bed and let Peter cry silently while he just sat there.

Mrs Parker had been the one to tell Harry about the funeral, imploring Harry to go for support for Peter. Harry would rather never step foot in a cemetery again, but he was relieved when Tony offered to go with him.

Tony has seemed as uncomfortable as Harry was when they arrived and sat through the service. In fact, Tony had looked pale and a little sweaty, but Harry hadn’t felt much better.

Now he stood there with Peter while the others hid from the rain and the grief inside the funeral home, and Harry didn’t have any words to say.

“Thanks for coming,” Peter said hoarsely when the wind began to blow the rain back in their faces.

“Of course,” Harry said quickly. “Do you- do you want to go inside?”

Peter turned and looked at the innocent seeming white building with a parking lot full of cars.

“No.” He squeezed Harry’s hand and then dropped it. “I’m going to go home.”

“Hold on!” Harry pulled on Peter’s hand when he started to walk off. “I’ll give you a ride, it’s cold out,” he protested.

Peter didn’t seem to even hear him, or he didn’t want to, one of the two. He shook his head and gave Harry a wan smile.

“Bye, Bright Eyes,” he said, lifting his hand in goodbye.

Harry stood alone in the lawn and let the umbrella fall and the rain soak his hair as Peter walked away.

 

“You okay, kid?” Tony asked while they drove home shortly after Peter left.

Harry shrugged, “I’m fine.”

He felt… uneasy. On edge, or something. It was probably just seeing Peter so dejected and upset, or maybe the sight of all the tombstones in the graveyard, but Harry felt off.

Not that he’d be telling Tony that. Ever since Harry got his arse kicked in that alley, Tony had been acting weird and Harry didn’t appreciate it much. He hadn’t asked Harry to leave, yet, and had been pestering him almost constantly, asking what he was doing, what he was thinking, all sorts of mad questions. And on top of that, it seemed like Sirius was avoiding him.

Every time Harry went to see him, he’d only found Thor. And Rhodey was right, Thor was pretty soft despite his size, like Hagrid really, but Harry didn’t go to see him.

He did hang out for an hour after school the day before and listened to Thor talk about his brother Loki.

Harry kind of hoped he’d get to meet Loki eventually, he seemed like a laugh when he wasn’t trying to take over the world.

 

Tony didn’t say much the rest of the drive home and Harry was relieved for it. It had been a long week. He was already buried in homework he didn’t understand, he had essays he had to write, Sirius was avoiding him, and now Peter was in a funk that Harry couldn’t yank him from. All in all, Harry had better weeks.

“You want to watch a movie or something before dinner?” Tony asked when they climbed on the lift to ride up to their flat.

Harry gave him a suspicious look. “I’ve got homework.”

Tony grinned at him while he loosened the tie knotted up by his neck. “How much homework could you have? You’ve only went to school one day this week.”

Harry flushed and looked down at the muddy dress shoes he had on. Tony hadn’t seemed mad about Harry skipping school Wednesday, which he’d called him out on immediately when Harry got home (apparently in muggle schools they called your parents when you suddenly disappeared), but they hadn’t really discussed it much either.

“Sorry,” Harry muttered. He glanced up at Tony through his lashes and tried to gauge if his smile was forced or not.

“Hey I skipped a hell of a lot more than one day when I went to high school, I mean, I was twelve, but still.”

Harry snorted and tried to imagine himself at twelve navigating the halls of Midtown High. He would probably have been trampled within an hour. Hogwarts was mad, but muggle teens were loud and overwhelming. Everyone wanted to talk to Harry, asking about Tony and the Avengers and Harry’s accent; it was nearly ironic that Harry was just as famous in Midtown as he was Hogwarts.

It was no surprise that Harry hated it just as much as he always had.

“What all homework do you have?” Tony asked when they stepped off the lift and into their flat. “Anything I can help with?”

Harry hesitated. Tony probably could help, but then he’d be fully aware of what an idiot Harry was…

“No,” Harry said lightly. “I think I’ve got the gist of it, I just have to do some worksheets.”

And read half a book by William Shakespeare. And figure out how to make algebra equations not look like squiggly lines. And then read a chapter of his history book and answer a bunch of questions on it.

Harry sighed when he considered it all. Without Hermione to help him, it felt like a lot to do.

“If you need me, I’ll be in my lab,” Tony told Harry when they split off in separate directions. Harry gave him a half-hearted nod and then went to tackle the impossible mountain of homework.

Since the algebra was the most confusing, that’s where Harry started. Except he didn’t actually understand it and then he kept getting distracted checking for messages from Peter.

Which then led him to thinking about how miserable Peter was. Which then led Harry to thinking about how miserable he’d be if someone in his family died.

Then Harry text Sirius, asking where he was. A bar with Clint, apparently, was the swift reply Harry got back. Harry scoffed and sent a picture of a face rolling its eyes. Trust Sirius to celebrate freedom by drinking at three in the afternoon.

Harry decided to skip the algebra, save it for when he could pester Gwen for help, and then tried to do the history assignment.

Harry tapped his fingers on his desk while he read. He pulled at the tie he still wore. Then he decided to change into something more comfortable. And since he was in the bathroom anyway, Harry brushed his teeth and removed the bandage on his mostly healed hand. He only covered it out of habit, since it would be a difficult scar to explain to muggles.

Once he sat back down at his desk, Harry lost his place and regretfully started back at the top of the page he’d been on. He didn’t even make it to the middle of the page before he huffed and slammed the textbook shut.

Why was concentrating so bloody hard? Harry felt like he was on a sharp edge of something and he got up to shake it off.

Literally.

Harry shook his hands out, he rolled his neck, he stretched up to pet Hedwig. When Joey yawned from where he was sleeping on Harry’s bed, Harry figured it was as good of a time as any to take him outside.

It was still raining, so Harry stood beneath the awning just outside the door while Joey quickly did his business. Harry was pleased to see that he was running around and playing perfectly normally. Tony had been worried about Harry’s minor injuries from Monday night, but Harry had only been concerned about Joey.

“Good boy,” Harry praised Joey when he came back with an empty bladder and a wagging tail. “Come on, let’s get you a treat.”

It wasn’t a way to stall, it was a necessity. Joey needed a treat for being such a good dog and Harry could use something to crunch on to help him focus.

Except it didn’t work and Harry wound up pitching Shakespeare across his bedroom and complaining about it while he stormed in the sitting room.

“Stupid fucking Shakespeare, just write normal! And who gives a damn about Macbeth?!” Harry muttered darkly. “Whole damn story is rubbish.”

“There’s a lot of dick jokes in there if you squint through the pretentious bullshit.”

Harry stopped and looked toward the kitchen. Tony was sitting was sitting at the counter, swiping away at a screen that Harry knew was called a ‘hologram’. It seemed a bit like magic, really, the way Tony could make them appear out of the air then control them with just his fingertips before vanishing them completely.

“What are you doing?” Harry asked, definitely not as a way to push off his homework.

Tony glanced from the screen he’d been studying to Harry and tossed him a quick grin.

“Looking for Ultron and Darth Vader and your red skinned hero.”

Harry rolled his eyes, but popped in the seat beside Tony to take a peek at the screen. It was nice that Tony had believed Harry about the bloke with the red skin, since Bruce and Sirius had seemed skeptical about Harry’s story, but Tony had taken Harry at his word.

A refreshing twist, really.

“I told you it might have been a mask,” Harry reminded him. It was foggy, like the quidditch March before Harry fell and cracked his skull, but Harry did remember the red-skinned bloke. It was hard to forget someone shooting web-like ropes from their hands.

“Hmm,” Tony hummed and squinted at the screen. It looked like a view of the top of a building. “Well whoever he is, he’s damn good at hiding.”

“Maybe he doesn’t want bothered,” Harry said drily. “Not everyone goes on the telly bragging about their good deeds.”

“That’s because everyone else didn’t have a hell of a lot of bad PR following them around,” Tony quipped. He waved the screen away and turned to face Harry. “I’m guessing from your incredibly eloquent critique of Shakespeare that the homework isn’t going great?”

“It’s… fine,” Harry hedged. He wiped his sweaty hands off on his sweatpants. “I was just taking a break.”

Tony made a disbelieving noise in the back of his throat and studied Harry speculatively.

“You want to go blow shit up?”

Harry blinked, certain he’d misheard him. “Pardon?”

Tony grinned mischievously, a twinkle in his eyes that Harry idly attributed to when Sirius was planning a complicated prank.

“I said, do you want to go blow shit up?” Tony repeated, drawing the words out slowly.

 

That… that sounded brilliant, actually.

 

Harry laughed when Tony’s robot, DUM-E, sent another piece of junk metal in the air and he shot it with the weapons hidden inside the fingertips of Tony’s Iron Man gloves.

“Nailed it!” Tony yelled happily when the piece exploded and sent metal flying in all directions. Tony held Steve’s ‘borrowed’ shield up to cover them from any stray pieces and they both cheered at the destruction.

“PEMDAS, kid, what is it?” Tony asked when DUM-E pulled its robot arm back with another item to shoot. Tony had been quizzing Harry on algebra while they blew stuff up, a surprisingly easy way for Harry to focus.

Apparently he just needed two things to do at a time and then he was fine.

Harry squinted and held his hand up to aim, waiting for the moment he needed to shoot.

“Order of Operations?” Harry said, a question more than a sure answer.

“And what’s it stand for?”

With his previous answer apparently being correct, Harry felt more confident.

“Parenthesis, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction,” Harry said, focusing more on the robot to throw the metal than he was the problem. The metal went flying and Harry clicked the button inside where his index finger rested just as he said subtraction and Tony whooped when another piece of metal was destroyed.

“You’ve got it,” Tony said with a wide smile. “Alright, ready for another?”

Harry grinned, a smaller smile than Tony’s but genuinely excited with the game they’d made up. “Okay then,” he agreed.

 

By the time they were interrupted, Harry thought that he might have had an easier time with his exams throughout school if he’d been allowed to blow things up during the tests.

“Mister Stark, your candidates are downstairs,” Jarvis said.

Tony had been getting ready to reload DUM-E with more scrap metal, but he dropped it to the floor with a loud clang and wiped his hands off on his jeans.

“What candidates?” Harry asked as he regretfully pulled Tony’s robot-glove off his hand and sat it gingerly on the counter.

“Magic tutors.”

“What?” Harry’s head whipped around quickly. He’d thought maybe Tony had more inventors coming, not… not magic tutors.

Was that even a thing?!

“I’m sure I mentioned that?” Tony said with a grimace.

“I’m sure you didn’t,” Harry said tersely. “Interested in learning magic?”

Tony laughed and opened his lab door, a clear indication he wanted Harry to leave the room.

“I don’t have to take some important wizard test this year,” Tony told him in the corridor outside his lab. “Sirius said if you don’t sit for OWLS then you can’t qualify to be a grown up wizard, or something archaic and complicated that only makes sense to these ass-backwards wizards.”

Harry scowled since he was, technically, one of those ‘ass-backwards wizards’.

“I think dropping out of school revoked my ability to take my OWLS,” Harry said with a bite of annoyance in his tone.

Tony raised a brow at Harry’s tone, but didn’t comment on it. “You’re wrong,” he said with a smirk. “You’re not a dropout, you’re homeschooled, there’s a difference, kid. Come on, do you want to interview these wicked witches and wizards or not?”

“If one of them recognizes me, I don’t want them,” Harry muttered as an agreement.

He played with the idea in his mind while they went down to the ‘business’ level of the Tower. It was… a good idea, actually. Studying magic while going to a muggle school was really just the opposite of what Hermione did- studying muggle subjects in the summers and magic during the school year. Harry probably never would have considered it, but he was relieved that he wouldn’t have to give up his magic altogether.

Harry glanced over where Tony was slouched against the mirrored walls of the lift and cleared his throat.

“Thanks,” Harry said quietly.

Tony grinned crookedly and winked at him. “Don’t mention it. Seriously, don’t mention it. Wanda keeps trying to give you lessons and she’s all pissy I won’t let her.”

Harry raised a brow at that, and also as he remembered the fully qualified and recently freed wizard living in the same building as them.

“Why not Wanda? Or Sirius?” he asked.

Tony twisted his lips to the side and rubbed his chin. “Between us, I don’t trust Wanda,” Tony said, lowering his voice to a conspiratorial tone as he looked seriously at Harry. “Her and her brother hated me for years and then suddenly she sees that I’ve got a magic son and she’s all team Avengers? I don’t like it.”

Harry had so many questions about that. He pushed them to the side though to get an answer to the second part of his original question.

“And Sirius?” Harry pushed. If his godfather was living there, free to use magic as he pleased, it made no sense to find someone else to teach Harry. Sirius had helped Harry with a lot more than just spells and tests all last year.

Tony laughed when the lift doors open and he gave Harry an amused look.

“Kid, your godfather has been out celebrating for a week, I don’t think he’s letting up any time soon.”

Harry smiled fondly as he followed Tony to the room where the ‘magic tutors’ waited.

“Sirius has twelve years to make up for,” Harry informed Tony factually before they stepped inside. “He’ll probably grow up in another twelve years.”

Tony chuckled again, “I hope not. Where’s the fun in growing up?”

Harry wondered where the fun in being a child was. He’d certainly never enjoyed being small and weak, but to each their own.

 

And then Harry couldn’t think any more about it because there were half a dozen witches and wizards inside Tony’s conference room and their eyes all swung to him the instant the door opened.

Bloody hell.

 

Harry sat slumped in a chair beside Tony while each ‘tutor’ talked.

 

One witch couldn’t stop staring at Harry’s forehead, so he kicked Tony beneath the table as a silent ‘fuck no’.

 

A wizard with a giant wart on his nose eagerly described his high OWLS and NEWTS. Tony hummed when he looked over his application.

“And what have you been doing since?” Tony asked him. “I don’t see any jobs on here.”

“I’ve been practicing the mystic arts of meditation,” he said, serious as anything.

Tony smiled blandly and dismissed him with the request that he ‘not call Tony, Tony would call him’.

“I don’t think he had a phone,” Harry pointed out when the wizard left.

Tony scoffed, “Exactly.”

 

The next witch didn’t have any background in Defense Against Dark Arts, which Harry quietly informed Tony was his favorite subject.

 

The witch after that could only tutor during the hours Harry was at school, as her kids were all attending primary school during the day.

 

Tony dismissed the fifth one right off the bat when he remarked about Tony being a ‘wizard wanna-be’.

“He’s got a point,” Harry smirked.

“Shut it.”

 

The sixth one came in with his head held high and a twist of a smirk on his lips. He looked vaguely familiar with his peculiar golden necklace and red cape, but Harry couldn’t place him. He had a neat appearance, trimmed facial hair on a sharp jaw and intelligent eyes.

“Doctor Stephen Strange,” he said, offering Harry his hand before he did Tony. He sat in the chair at the opposite end of the table from them and spread his hands wide. “I’m here to teach your son magic.”
Notes:

    Ope, Dr Strange has entered the chat.

    Up Next: Tony’s todo list didn’t have ‘talking about relationship problems with his kid’ but sure, why not add it?

Notes:

    Hello, sorry for the delay, I’m very caught up in a Harry Potter & Wednesday Addams Crossover fic.
    Sorry for the short chapter after you’ve been so patient, but I was stumped and then realized the next scenes had to be Harry’s POV.

    Thank you all for your encouraging comments and constant love, enjoy! ❤️

Chapter Text

Sunday, September 23

It was cheesy beyond reason, but Tony looked around his place and nearly smiled at everyone who showed up for their weekly dinner.

Weekly dinners had been a screeching halt while Harry was gone, and Tony had worried that with the whole ‘let’s blame Tony for the Ultron mistake’ that they wouldn’t resume. But apparently Harry told Sirius about them, Sirius asked Clint, Clint got Nat, Nat got Steve, and by the end there were nearly a dozen people stacked in Tony’s apartment, sharing gyros and easy conversation.

Harry sat by Tony and had his chin propped in his hand, his eyes wide, and his lips twisted to the side while he listened to Thor describe Asgard. Sirius was sitting in the sitting room with the wonder twins, chatting up a patiently amused looking Nat. One of the wonder twins, the witch-bitch, was staring hard at Sirius, causing Tony to chuckle to himself privately. Clint was lounging across the recliner, his feet propped up on the table, talking in quiet tones to Steve about their lack of progress on the Ultron front.

Honestly, it was a damn good day and Tony couldn’t be more at ease with his raggedy band of an enhanced family.

Or, it was a good day, until Wanda spoke up and ruined the relaxed atmosphere they had going.

“Why can I not hear your mind?” she asked Sirius abruptly, drawing all other conversations to a screeching halt.

Sirius slowly turned to look at Wanda, his eyes narrowed.

“What?” he asked her slowly. “Are you- are you trying to legilimize me?”

Pietro bristled, and Harry stood up, rocking back on his heels with a hand on the bar, to see what was happening.

“She is not trying to do anything,” Pietro drawled. “It is one of her powers, she hears what is in the minds.”

“All the fucking time?!” Harry demanded, drawing their eyes to him. Harry looked torn between indignation and fury and Tony felt for him. It didn’t exactly feel great knowing witch-bitch was in their minds seeing and hearing things they would all rather keep private.

Wanda looked at Harry and the soft expression on her face was all the confirmation Harry needed. He spun on Tony and pointed a finger at him.

“Did you know she’s reading my mind?” he asked harshly, a flash of betrayal in his eyes.

“Did I know she’s got some freaky powers where she can fuck with our heads? Yeah,” Tony admitted. It wasn’t exactly a secret, so Harry’s twitch of surprise was unexpected, as was the way he spun around to glare at Wanda.

“Stay out of my bloody head,” he demanded with a finger pointing at her.

“I am not entering your head, your mind reaches out to me,” Wanda told him, sounding genuine if not ridiculous.

Harry scowled and his eyes flicked toward Sirius. “How are you blocking her?”

Sirius shrugged from where he still sat on the sofa. “Must be occlumency, my barriers were pretty shot when I left Azkaban, but I’ve been working on them since I joined the Order.”

“What is occlumency?” Harry and Wanda asked at the same time.

“Why don’t you ask your ‘magic tutor’?” Sirius asked with a roll of his eyes for Tony. As if Tony weren’t doing him a hell of a favor.

Tutoring Harry would eat up Sirius’ free time and could put a strain between him and the kid. Tony hated every tutor he ever had, he’d almost feel guilty if Harry and Sirius stopped getting along because Sirius was taking a different role in his life.

A small part of Tony would be thrilled if they weren’t so chummy, but that was Tony’s own insecurities at play, so he smacked it like a whack-a-mole when it popped up.

“Why don’t you stop being a dick and just answer the question?” Harry snarked right back at his godfather, earning a snicker from Clint and Pietro.

“Occlumency is an ancient art,” Thor piped up helpfully, drawing the spotlight to himself. “It is a worthy art for Stark’s son to learn, it will keep young Stark from suffering from the visions that Wanda forced on Tony.”

Tony sighed in a long suffering way. He’d rather not talk about the reoccurring nightmare that the witch-bitch first showed him. It made it hard to consider her a part of the team when he wanted to throttle her every time he thought of it.

“What the fuck does that mean?” Harry demanded, his voice cold and his head turning back to Wanda with eyes narrowed nearly to slits.

“Okay, dinners over, time to play a game,” Tony announced loudly, interrupting whatever Wanda was about to say. Tony wasn’t defending her, he didn’t trust her as far as he could see her, but he didn’t want to have her spell out Tony’s worst nightmare to the others either.

“My turn to pick!” Nat yelled. She pulled a pack of cards from her jacket pocket while Clint snagged the poker case from one of the drawers beneath the newly replaced TV.

“I don’t know how to play, I’m going to bed,” Harry said with a final scowl for Wanda.

“No, stay and play!” Sirius cried cajolingly. “Come on, kiddo, I’ll teach you.”

“I’ve got school in the morning,” Harry snapped at him, apparently pretty pissed off about something. “Goodnight.”

Tony sighed when Harry stalked to his room, avoiding contact with anyone cluttering the living room, and closed his door behind him with a soft slam.

“You guys go play somewhere else,” Tony told the others, abruptly exhausted. It was always one step forward, one step backward. Teenagers were the moodiest damn things in the world; Tony should just be grateful his kid was a wizard and not an addict like he’d been.

The team filtered out, offering Tony apologies and shrugs, but Sirius lingered before he took the stairs down to Clint’s place.

“Peter hasn’t talked to Harry in a few days,” he said as he rocked back and forth on his heels, holding the door handle tightly. He shrugged when Tony gave him an irritated look as Sirius knew yet another thing Tony didn’t.

He knew he shouldn’t have stopped reading the kid’s texts.

“And… Harry doesn’t like the word freak, so maybe don’t call Wanda that again?” Sirius suggested. “Good luck, mate, you’re doing brilliantly.”

Tony felt his stomach swoop with an uncomfortable feeling of shame as Sirius cheerfully bounced down the stairs. He’d forgotten, actually, it had been a slip of the tongue.

But ‘freak’ was what Harry said his mom’s sister and her husband called him.

And then Tony went and said Wanda’s powers were freaky, like a damn moron.

“JARVIS, what’s Harry doing?” Tony asked as he sunk down in his chair and made bedroom eyes at the liquor cabinet across the room from him.

“He is in the shower, sir,” JARVIS answered promptly.

“Fine.” Tony rubbed his eyes then slapped his cheeks lightly, willing himself to stay awake and alert. He’d wait a few minutes, and then he’d just go talk to Harry. He’d apologize for the insult to Wanda, ask about Peter, clear the air.

 

Easy.

 

Except Tony fell asleep in his clothes right in the recliner and didn’t wake up until after midnight, only to find Harry passed out in his bed.

 

Tony had a box of apology donuts laid out in the counter the next morning and a cup of coffee brewing for Harry when he woke up.

“Good morning,” Tony called cheerfully. His kid was not a morning person, it was adorable. Harry had his face all twisted up in a scowl and his clothes haphazardly tossed on. One of his shoes weren’t even tied.

“It’s morning anyway,” Harry muttered. He looked suspiciously at the pink box of pastries and Tony chuckled.

“There’s some raspberry ones in there,” Tony told him, waggling his brows enticingly. “Come on, eat breakfast with your old man before you go to school. Tell me about your friends. How’s Gwen liking the new internship?”

Harry sighed and seemed to resign himself to a quick chat before Happy drove him to school.

“She says it’s brilliant,” Harry said. He sat down and pulled the box of donuts to him, wrapping his arm around it while he dug for one of the ones Tony knew he liked. “They let her do a press release about the Avengers and she said her manager only made a few edit.”

Tony beamed, more happy about Harry talking to him about his friend than about Stark Industry’s newest intern.

“That’s great,” he said before tactfully adding, “and how’s Pete holding up?”

Harry’s easy posture tensed and his hand paused for a fraction of a second with his donut on the way to his mouth.

“Dunno,” he said shortly, glaring at the donut like it had offended him. “I haven’t talked to him in a few days. He’s upset, I guess.”

Tony could empathize with Harry’s boyfriend, even if he couldn’t really sympathize. He would miss his parents more, had they ever really been present in his life. But to lose an uncle that had raised him for most of his life? It would be like losing Rhodey. Hell, Tony’s only wish used to be that he’d die before any of his friends, it would kill him to go to their funerals.

Now Tony just wanted to go before his kid and hope to God that he never had to bury him like he had his parents.

“Everyone deals with death differently,” Tony told Harry gently. “Give Pete a few days, I’m sure he’ll be following you around with puppy eyes again soon enough.”

“You don’t even have a girlfriend,” Harry snapped, but there wasn’t any real malice in his tone, it was nearly playful coming from him.

Tony grinned crookedly and gave Harry his drink when it was finished brewing.

“Kid, I’m an endless pool of dating advice. I just look at every relationship I’ve had and then suggest the opposite of what I did.”

“So I should always ask myself, ‘what would Tony do?’ and then do the opposite?” Harry huffed, and it sounded close enough to a laugh that Tony melted. “That’s the first bit of good advice you’ve ever given me.”

Tony clapped Harry on the shoulder softly and gave him a bright smile.

“That’s the spirit,” he said. “I’ll make you one of those lame rubber bracelets and stamp ‘W.W.T.D?’ on it for a constant reminder.”

That time, Harry did laugh, and Tony was pretty damn thrilled with himself by the time the kid left for school. He hadn’t apologized about the Wanda thing, but Harry probably wasn’t interested in hearing it anyway. Plus, Tony didn’t make a habit of apologizing, so it was easier to text than talk.

 

Wanda isn’t a freak and neither are you. How’s school?

You’re annoying. I’m at lunch.

I know, that’s why I text you.

Do all parents stalk their kids?

Only the good ones.

Peter isn’t here, I’m sitting with Gwen. Goodbye.

Don’t forget your tutor is coming today. Have fun, kid, love you.

Harry sent back an emoji rolling it’s eyes and Tony chuckled in his office.

As much as Harry mimicked Sirius, he was quite a bit like Tony as well. It made Tony wonder how much of Lily Harry had in him, aside from the eye color.

 

Harry’s new tutor, Doctor Strange, arrived a few minutes before Harry was due back from school that afternoon. Tony had instructed him to arrive early so they could go over his contract and he was relieved that the man could follow a plan to an extent.

Strange was just as strange as his name, really. He dressed like some low budget ninja from a bad movie and talked with a lot of arrogance for a guy wearing a blanket like a cape.

“Tony,” Strange said, offering Tony his hand, “where’s the kid?”

“School,” Tony said. He sat down behind his desk and waved a hand, indicating Strange did the same. “I wanted to ask you a few questions before your first session.”

Strange sat down and crossed one ankle over his other knee.

“I assumed so,” he said with a smirk. “I didn’t take you for someone to hire an employee without playing fifty questions first.”

“You’re right,” Tony said bluntly. He pulled Strange’s background report up on a screen so they could go over it together. “You graduated top of your class at Harvard, specializing in neurology.”

“I did,” Strange said smoothly. “I worked as a neurosurgeon for many years.”

“Before you crashed a car and the wreck left your hands too damaged to use them,” Tony pointed out bluntly. He looked to where Strange’s hands were tremble-free and resting on his leg. “Did you fix them with magic?”

“Magic? No,” Strange chuckled, unflappable. “My hands healed when my soul did. The mind and the spirit are connected.”

“But you do know magic, don’t you?” Tony pushed. “You can help Harry with his OWLS and NEWTS?”

“I can teach your son, yes,” Strange said slowly and evasively. “Which is more important to you, Tony, Harry fulfilling his potential or Harry passing his tests in a traditional manner?”

Tony thought about Darth Vader and Ultron, the witch from Hogwarts, and the Death Eaters that had staked out his house. Tony considered the guys that attacked Harry in an alleyway and the guy in the mask that could have killed Harry, but saved him instead.

Tony propped his elbows on his desk and leaned forward, staring Strange down intently.

“What’s most important to me is that my kid lives to become his own person,” Tony said solemnly. “Harry being safe from threats, able to defend himself, that’s what’s important to me, Strange.”

Strange smiled slowly and inclined his head to Tony.

“Then our goals are perfectly in alignment,” he said calmly. “Your son will make an excellent sorcerer, Tony. I’m going to make sure of it.”

Tony didn’t care much about sorcery or how good at it Harry would be, he just wanted his kid to be happy, healthy, and alive.

Just as every other halfway decent parent in the world, he assumed.

Chapter Text

Monday, September 24

Harry was mildly annoyed the entire drive from school back to the tower.

Not only had Peter been practically ignoring him, but now they were fighting.

All Harry had done was ask him what happened when he saw Peter arrive that morning, late, with a black eye and it set Peter off which set Harry off.

 

“Hey, what happened?” Harry had asked, reaching up hesitantly where Peter’s eye was bruised and cut.

Peter pushed Harry’s hand away and turned his head. “None of your damn business,” he muttered.

Harry bristled defensively. “Sorry for caring.”

Peter had laughed and his eyes weren’t nearly as warm when they met Harry’s. “Oh, sorry, I forgot you’re the only one allowed to keep secrets around here.”

They’d attracted a small crowd in the hallway, students whispering about their argument, and Harry had been embarrassed so he got short.

“I don’t give a damn about your secrets,” Harry drawled. “If someone’s beating your arse, I guess it’s your problem.”

“That’s right!” Peter yelled at him. “It’s my problem, not yours!”

 

If Peter wanted to be a prat and yell at Harry and get bruised up, that was his decision.

Harry just didn’t have to deal with it.

“Bad day?” Happy asked, eyeing Harry subtly from the corner of his eyes.

“And about to get worse,” Harry scoffed, thinking of the ‘tutor’ waiting for him back at the tower. Harry was better at magic than he was at algebra, but Harry was also in a pissy mood and would rather deal with none of it.

Happy nodded understandably and turned the car smoothly in the underground garage for the tower.

“What sounds good for dinner?” he asked when Harry climbed out and slammed the car door harder than was probably necessary.

Harry shrugged. “Do you guys ever get sick of takeout?” he asked, mostly just to be disagreeable.

Happy laughed and pressed the button for the lift. “All the time, but nobody knows how to cook here.”

Harry considered it for a minute while they rode the lift. Tony hadn’t seemed real set on making Harry clean or cook or sleep in any cupboards, and Harry knew how to cook, he just preferred not to.

But one dinner didn’t sound terrible, and Harry could text Sirius and make him come since he’d been avoiding Harry for days.

“Think someone can get groceries if I give you a list?” Harry asked Happy.

Happy lifted a single brow at Harry. “For what?”

“For groceries,” Harry scowled. “Obviously.”

Happy, unflappable bastard that he was, just laughed and raised his hands innocently.

“Fine, fine,” he said amicably. “Send me a list and I’ll grab stuff.”

“Thanks,” Harry said, already pulling out his phone and typing up a list. It didn’t take him long to think of what to cook, something easy but complex enough to help soothe Harry’s annoyance. Really it took the longest to type out all the spices and things that most kitchens always had in stock and Harry knew that Tony’s absolutely didn’t.

By the time Harry finished his list, the two of them had arrived on the floor where Harry and Tony’s flat was. Harry had nearly walked right past Tony’s office, distracted as he was, and only stopped when Happy called out a quiet reminder about his tutor.

“Harry, hey.” Tony was leaning against the front of his desk with his arms crossed and an easy smile on his lips. He nodded his head toward the bloke Harry met before, Stephen Strange. “You remember Strange?”

“Doctor Strange,” Strange said. He stood up and offered a hand to Harry when Harry joined them by Tony’s desk.

“You don’t look like a doctor,” Harry said deadpan. He eyed the weird clothes the man wore, complete with a red cape, and figured he would stand out even amongst wizards.

Strange didn’t seem offended, he merely smirked. “Don’t call me if you ever have a brain aneurysm then.”

“I won’t,” Harry said coolly.

Tony clapped his hands together and laughed. “Alright, well, you guys can work in here and—”

“I’d prefer somewhere more private,” Strange told Tony abruptly. “Somewhere without distractions,” he added pointedly.

“Oh.” Tony deflated and Harry held back an amused grin, certain that he just wanted to watch them practice magic. “I guess you guys could work in Harry’s room, if Harry doesn’t mind?”

Harry shrugged. It wasn’t like they’d be alone in Harry’s room, not with Jarvis and whatever other spyware Tony had.

“Fine,” Harry agreed. He gave Tony a forced grin before he led Strange from Tony’s office to his room. Harry had to shoo Joey away and close the door, otherwise he’d just run back in and beg for Harry’s attention the whole time.

“You don’t need that just yet,” Strange said when Harry pulled his wand from where he had it stored in his closet with his broomstick and cloak.

“I don’t need my wand to practice magic?” Harry asked disbelievingly.

“Nope, because this isn’t the traditional magic that you’ve seen before,” Strange said, perfectly serene. He stood in the center of the room and looked so out of place in Harry’s room that it was almost comical.

“What I can teach you is more centered in the mystical arts of sorcery rather than the more recent magical arts,” Strange told Harry. “Mastering the art of sorcery will have you so in tune with your own magic that spells will flow from your fingers with hardly a thought.”

Harry’s interest was caught in that explanation. He’d seen Strange do a few acts of magic when he’d arrived for the interview Tony set up, and truthfully Harry had never seen anyone else do magic like he did.

“So how do I learn sorcery?” Harry asked eagerly, earning an approving smile from Strange.

“You have to clear your mind; clear mind, open spirit,” Strange said. He sat on the floor with his legs crossed and his hands palm up on his knees. Harry sank down to mimic his position when Strange closed his eyes and inhaled slowly.

“You have an advantage, you already know you have magic inside of you,” Strange said calmly, his eyes still closed. “You block yourself with your disconnect from your body, your mind, and your spirit. To wield you magic to your best potential, you have to make those three areas become one.”

“How?” Harry asked. He’d been leaning forward, drawn in by Strange’s intelligent and smooth voice. “How do I make them become one?”

Strange opened one eye and quirked his lips in a crooked smirk. “Practice. Lots and lots of practice.”

“Brilliant,” Harry muttered. He settled back down in the relaxed pose Strange had and tried to copy his deep and even breathing.

“Surrender yourself to the peace swirling inside you, the magic that cares for you, and give yourself up to it. Allow it to flow freely, connecting your body to your mind and then your spirit.”

Whatever the fuck that meant.

Harry tried to ‘surrender himself’ to peace, but his mind wouldn’t focus.

Somewhere in the house, Harry could hear Joey barking. Hopefully Tony or someone would take him outside so Harry didn’t have a mess to clean up.

It was around nine at Hogwarts… Harry wondered if Hermione would call him before bed.

Focus.

Harry couldn’t feel anything ‘flowing freely’ inside of him except for mild annoyance at not understanding the instructions.

“You’re not clearing your mind,” Strange murmured.

“How do I clear my mind?” Harry huffed, opening his eyes again and glaring at Strange. “You’re telling me to connect my body and not telling me how!”

Strange didn’t get annoyed at Harry’s outburst, he only seemed amused.

“I was like you when I went looking for answers,” Strange said calmly. “I was pissed off at life and looking for something to just fix it all. And you know what I found instead? True purpose, kid. And that’s what you’ll find too.”

“I don’t need ‘true purpose’,” Harry scoffed irritably. “I just want to learn magic so I’m not a sitting duck when Voldemort comes knocking and tries to kill my family.”

Strange nodded and his dark eyes had a glint of understanding in them.

“You won’t be,” he assured him. He lifted one of his hands and tapped the golden eye shaped necklace he wore. “I’ve seen it, Harry Stark, I’ve seen what your future holds. All you need to do is concentrate now and you’ll be the greatest sorcerer to live.”

Harry leapt to his feet, filled with a mixture of some sort of terror and longing.

“I don’t want that,” Harry said quietly. That sounded like something Voldemort wanted. Harry didn’t want to be the ‘greatest sorcerer to live’, he just wanted… he just wanted to live.

Harry wanted to live and find out what life could be like when he wasn’t plagued by problems he couldn’t solve or relationships he couldn’t manage. Harry wanted to find out if being an adult was worth it and maybe learn to drive a car properly.

And until then, Harry had his dad, his godfather, and if Peter ever stopped being a dick, he’d have his boyfriend again.

It was all a hell of a lot more than Harry had over the summer when he’d… fallen… off that rooftop.

“I just want to live to see sixteen,” Harry told Strange firmly, waiting for his nod before Harry sat back down with his legs crossed. “And maybe keep people safe in the meantime.”

“It’s always those who shy away from power the most that are destined to wield it,” Strange murmured. He probably thought he sounded mysterious or wise, but Harry just thought he sounded daft.

“So just to be clear, we’re not working on defense or transfiguration at all?” Harry asked as disdainfully as he could.

Strange chuckled and shook his head, his face once more relaxing in a passive expression.

“Not yet,” he said cryptically. “For now, let’s make you one with yourself.”

 

It took less than an hour before Strange declared that Harry had made some progress and should try and ‘clear his mind’ as homework.

“I’ll do that,” Harry snarled quietly, frustrated by obviously not making any real progress, despite what Strange told him. Harry had a pounding headache and ignored his ‘tutor’ when he went to talk with Tony in his office.

There were bags of groceries on the kitchen counter and Harry sighed, regretting his offer to make dinner. If he’d known that he was going to spend an hour trying, and failing, to ‘become one within himself’ he wouldn’t have bothered.

Come help me cook?

I don’t know how and I’m not home, sorry kiddo.

Then you don’t get to come eat dinner when I cook it.

Sirius sent a string of pleading faces with teary eyes and sad pouts while Harry made the glaze for the pork and began brushing it down carefully.

Fine you can come. Seven o’clock Siri.

Can I bring a date?

Harry paused when he’d been chopping the clean potatoes and stared strangely at his phone. It wasn’t that Harry didn’t want Sirius to be happy, Sirius deserved it more than anyone, it was just…

Have you been avoiding me for a date??

Harry slammed the pork in the oven and began roasting green beans while he waited for Sirius’ response.

It wasn’t like Harry and Peter started dating and Harry said ‘screw you’ to anyone else. He still had breakfast with Tony and tried to see Sirius. He chatted with Hermione almost every night and text Pepper about their days while she was still away on her business trip.

Sirius was a prat.

I’m not avoiding you, I’m giving you space to hang out with your dad. This is something new, someone I met. I won’t bring them if it’s going to upset you.

Oh no, I’m not upset. Bring them. It’ll be brilliant.

Harry clicked his phone on mute and stuffed it angrily in his pocket. He wasn’t upset, he was brilliant, excellent really. Sirius was out partying and getting dates and avoiding Harry. Peter was being a dick and getting in fights and pushing Harry away.

At least Tony was still there.

It was peculiar that he was, as Harry had sort of assumed he’d be ready to push Harry toward Sirius immediately, but… but Harry rather liked having someone around that remembered he was a human being.

 

Once Harry had the different dishes all cooking, he wandered toward Tony’s office and only hesitated for a moment before knocking quietly.

“Come in!” Tony called immediately.

Harry poked his head in and saw that Strange was still sitting in there across from Tony with an easy smile on his face. Harry narrowed his eyes at him for a moment before looking toward Tony.

“I can’t find any Tylenol,” Harry said honestly, curious about why Strange was still there.

“Headache?” Tony guessed accurately. He dug in his desk drawer at Harry’s curt nod. “Hey, actually, you got a minute, kid? Come in and talk.”

Harry scowled and curled his shoulders inward while he stepped inside and closed the door behind him. This was the part where Tony ranted about Harry wasting his money and Strange’s time by his failed session.

Tony tossed Harry the bottle of Tylenol and Harry grabbed three, swallowing them dry, then perched on the edge of a chair beside Strange at Tony’s gesture.

“Are you having a hard time concentrating in school?” Tony asked, knocking Harry off-kilter with the random question. Tony and Strange both looked completely at ease, both watching Harry with patiently curious expressions.

“I…” Harry faltered and his sarcasm fled him in face of Tony seeming genuinely interested. “Sometimes?” he offered. If the class didn’t interest him or it became too much lecture without enough hands on practice, which it seemed like that was all muggle school did.

“Would you say that you’re impulsive?” Strange asked Harry.

Harry said yeah the same instant that Tony said yes.

The two of them met each others eyes and Harry felt his lips twitch in an effort to fight back a grin at the confident response Tony gave.

“Not as bad as some people I know,” Harry explained, thinking of Sirius. “But… yeah, I- er… I’ve been called that a lot.”

Strange nodded and then lifted his hand, spinning it in a small circular motion and causing what looked like a magical hole to appear in front of him. He reached through it, ignoring Harry and Tony’s sounds of surprise at the magic Harry had never seen performed before, and pulled his hand back out with some colorful papers.

Harry accepted one of the papers Strange silently offered him and began reading it while Tony read the copy Strange gave him.

“This is like a checklist of my life,” Harry said with a bemused scowl when he read down the list of questions. It was a test of some sort, one that Harry was certain he’d pass.

‘Do you frequently say things without thinking it through first?’

‘I am frequently bored and look for more interesting activities.’

‘When I am involved in something interesting, I lose track of time, place, and other obligations.’

‘Do you work better with your hands?’

‘Do you find yourself fidgeting or moving around when you’re meant to be sitting still?’

‘I find it difficult to shut my mind off to rest at night.’

“Would you say you identify with most of the questions or statements on that sheet?” Strange asked Harry neutrally.

Harry glanced at Tony, hoping for some sort of clue on how he was meant to respond. Tony was leaning back in his chair though with his hands laced behind his head and his eyes thoughtfully trained on the ceiling.

“Maybe,” Harry said evasively. His stomach felt uneasy with the questions and the way Strange was watching him. If Harry didn’t understand what was going on, it was probably best to stay evasive.

Strange nodded anyway, seemingly satisfied to take Harry’s ‘maybe’ as a ‘yes’. He looked toward Tony and cleared his throat pointedly. Tony nodded.

And then Harry, who had a rubbish day, snapped.

“What?” Harry demanded, jumping to his feet irritably. He looked between the two men accusingly. “What’s this all about? Because I couldn’t clear my bloody mind?”

“No, no, nothing like that,” Tony said hastily. He dropped his hands and leaned toward Harry across his desk. “Strange used to be a doctor before he gave it all up for magic.”

“I am still a board certified neurosurgeon,” Strange snapped at Tony haughtily. “I’m world renowned.”

“Whatever,” Tony waved him off. “Anyway, he thinks you might have ADHD.”

Harry curled his nose. “I don’t,” he scowled.

Tony raised a brow at Harry. “Do you know what it is?”

“Yes,” Harry lied through his teeth. “And I don’t have it.”

Whatever it was.

With his piece said and his headache dimming, Harry turned on his heel and stormed out of Tony’s office. He had food to check on and a friend to call.

 

“Hello?” Hermione answered her phone on the second ring, her voice sounding like Harry woke her up.

“What’s ADHD?” Harry asked. He had his phone set in between his cheek and his shoulder while he juggled finishing off dinner and talking at the same time.

Hermione sighed in the phone and Harry heard the rustling sound of what he was sure would be a stack of homework in the background. Knowing Hermione, she probably fell asleep while studying in the common room.

“Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,” Hermione parroted off, slipping in what Harry and Ron called her ‘I was wrongly sorted’ tone. “And before you ask, yes, you have it and I’ve always thought so.”

Harry scowled even though Hermione couldn’t see it. “What’s it mean though?” he asked.

“It doesn’t mean anything bad,” Hermione said, gentling her voice some when she undoubtedly picked up on the stress in Harry’s. “Your brain just works differently, Harry. Concentrating is hard for you and you’re more restless than everyone else.”

“Can I- can I fix it?” Harry asked. He squeezed his shoulder to his cheek tightly so he could pull the pan of pork from the oven. It looked and smelled perfect, much better than anything else Harry had attempted to do recently.

“You can treat it,” Hermione told him. “It’s really common, Harry. I think most people just take medicine for it. Did you see a doctor or something today?”

“Something like that,” Harry said. He started grabbing plates from the cabinet and begrudgingly got an extra one for Sirius’ date. “Oi, Sirius has a date,” he told Hermione, keen to change to subject.

Harry wasn’t sure how he felt about being told he had some ‘deficit’ that made his brain work differently and he’d rather process it by himself instead of with Hermione. Harry loved Hermione, but sometimes there was such a thing as ‘too supportive’.

“Does he?” Hermione sounded surprised. “I mean, Sirius is handsome and all, but he’s awfully erratic and moody. I certainly wouldn’t date him.”

“He’s really not ginger enough for you, is he?” Harry asked slyly, smirking to himself.

Hermione fired back quickly, but Harry could practically hear her blushing. “Well I’d say you seem to prefer people more athletic, skaters, perhaps?”

Harry’s mood dropped back down at the reminder of Peter.

Peter who Hermione didn’t even know Harry was dating… if they were still dating.

“Yeah,” Harry said absently. “Tell everyone I said hi, will you?”

Hermione said something, but Harry hung up on her.

 

One day, just one bloody day, Harry would like to have things go his way.

 

Dinner was tense.

Tony didn’t bring up the ADHD thing, and he had nothing but praise and compliments for Harry, but it was still tense between them. Happy tried to fill the awkward silence between them with comments about the food, questions for Harry about he made it, and comments to Tony about the building repairs that needed done, but it was still strained.

Harry didn’t think he’d be so happy for Sirius to finally arrive, twenty minutes late, with his date. Sirius bounced toward the kitchen where they were sitting at the makeshift table, pulling some bloke along with him, and Harry smiled just a little to see the wide and happy smile on Sirius’ face.

The bloke with him looked a little young, really, but he was fit too.

Harry could see why Sirius was dragging him around with him.

Sirius’ date had chin length dark brown hair that matched the light scruff he had on his sharp jaws. But Harry thought he seemed uneasy being there and that made Harry uneasy. The bloke was staring at them all with blue eyes that were flickering around so quickly that Harry subtly scooted his chair closer to Tony and further from him.

“Favorite godson! Favorite godson’s dad and…” Sirius paused in his greeting, looking at Happy curiously. “I don’t know your name.”

“Happy,” Happy said. “We’ve met… multiple times.”

“If you say so,” Sirius said cheerfully. He waved his hand toward the bloke with him and was beaming. “This is James.”

Harry coughed on the water he’d taken a sip of with bloody poor timing and twisted away when Tony patted his back.

“James?” Harry asked once he cleared his airway. He glared at his godfather. “Your boyfriend’s name is James?”

Why on earth would Sirius start dating someone with the same name as his dead best mate? Was that not as horribly uncomfortable as Harry imagined it would be?

James raised the hand he had stuffed in his leather jacket and Harry saw his fingers were made of silver metal. He smiled slightly at Harry, a kind and crooked smile, but there was something about him that still had Harry’s hair sticking up on the back of his neck. Something that felt a lot like danger.

“You can call me Bucky.”

Chapter Text

“You didn’t tell me your son’s dad was Tony Stark.”

Sirius loaded a plate up with what looked like the most delicious meal he’d ever had and grinned teasingly at James.

“Did you not see his name on the side of the building?” Sirius whispered to him with an amused grin.

James set his jaw in an irritated clench and Sirius laughed.

“He’s not as bad as he sounds in the papers,” Sirius assured him with an arm wrapped around his waist. “And he’s Harry’s dad, not me.”

“I thought you said Harry was your son?” James asked, his irritation melting away some.

Sirius shook his head. “Godson,” he stressed. He glanced behind them where Harry was sitting with Tony and winked when he saw Harry watching them intently.

“Come eat and then we can go back to my place,” Sirius told James with what he hoped was a winning smile. It used to work for him, anyway. “And we can have dessert,” Sirius added in a very quiet murmur.

James glanced uneasily over his shoulder and then met Sirius’ eyes with a curt nod.

“Fine,” he breathed. “Dinner with Stark. Awesome. Excellent. Perfect.”

Sirius wasn’t sure what his problem with Tony was, but he figured he had a just cause probably. Pietro and Wanda had a real good cause to hate Tony, and they’d gotten over it just fine.

Truthfully, Sirius didn’t know much about James at all. When he told Harry it was ‘new’, he meant ‘I just met a bloke in a pub and I’d like to shag him’. But Harry wanted Sirius to come for dinner so Sirius was just… working both angles, really.

Sirius could have dinner with his godson then take James to his flat, pray to Merlin that Thor wasn’t around, and shag him senseless.

Freedom was the sweetest thing to ever happen…

… besides being Harry’s godfather, of course.

James accepted a plate when Sirius thrust it at him and the two of them went to sit at the counter that Tony used as a dining table. Tony sat on the far side with Harry beside him and Happy at the head, so Sirius and James took the seats across from Tony and Harry.

“So… Bucky,” Harry grimaced when he said James’ nickname, which was fair, because Sirius laughed himself sick over it when he first heard it. There was a tiny twist in Sirius’ gut every time he used the name ‘James’ but James Potter of all people would have wanted Sirius to look past a name in an effort to have really excellent sex.

“So… Harry.” James tilted his head to the side and studied Harry closely. Harry frowned at him and Sirius held back a laugh in favor of tasting the bloody best roasted potatoes he’d ever had.

“You two are…” Harry flicked his fingers between Sirius and James. “Dating?”

“Not quite,” Sirius said brightly, saving James the effort of answering politely. “Shagging hopefully though.”

Harry, predictably, turned bright red and shot daggers at Sirius while Tony snorted and James huffed quietly.

“What?” Sirius asked, feigning innocence. He batted his lashes at Harry playfully. “It’s not like you won’t start shagging people one day.”

Harry glanced quickly at James and Sirius couldn’t tell if it was embarrassment or interest that brightened his eyes.

“Far, far, in the future,” Tony cut in with a grimace. He took a large drink of whatever he was drinking, something Sirius quickly snagged the bottle of and poured himself and James a glass.

“You were younger than Harry when you got started,” Tony’s (assistant? maybe?) mate, Happy, said with a wink for Harry. He was a decent bloke, even if he seemed to have a mum with as bad taste in names as Walburga had, and Sirius was pleased to see Harry return his grin, if a little strained.

“Shut up, Happy,” Tony said with a warning glare toward Happy. Sirius laughed and tried to draw James in the conversation, poor bloke was radiating waves of tension so strong that it starting to make Sirius feel on edge.

“Harry cooked this,” Sirius told James cheerfully. “It’s good, right?”

“I didn’t cook it,” Harry denied snappily before James could reply. “I ordered it and put it in pans so it looked like I cooked it.”

James paused with a forkful of fried greens to his lips. “Why would you do that?” he asked Harry, sounding mystified.

Maybe Sirius should have warned him that Harry was a cheeky bastard who used sarcasm like a weapon, but… but this was rather fun too.

“It sounded fun,” Harry said deadpan. He pushed his potatoes around on his plate with his fork while he glared directly at James. “What do you do for fun?”

“Pick up dates in a bar,” James quipped back just as deadpan. Sirius caught Tony’s eye and they exchanged a quick grin, both amused by Harry’s inquisition of Sirius’ date.

“Do this frequently then?” Harry sneered at James.

James raised a brow at Harry. “You know I’ve seen Sirius take a different guy home every night for the last two weeks, right?”

Tony subtly raised his glass to Sirius and Sirius bowed his head gracefully. It was an art really, and Sirius was lucky that New York City had such a variety of blokes looking for a string-free shag.

Harry’s face twisted up in disgust, but he still seemed determined to push at James.

“So you came with him knowing he’s probably going to replace you tomorrow?” Harry gave James a very Tony-like look of disbelief. “That’s pretty low, mate.”

James shrugged and didn’t even spare a look toward Sirius. “Live fast, die young,” he said flatly.

At that, Harry’s scathing look shifted just enough for a tiny smirk to appear.

“Suppose so,” he agreed, suddenly amiable.

“Or not,” Tony interrupted swiftly. “I like to say live slow and die never.”

“Die never is a good plan,” Happy agreed.

Sirius stayed quiet, as he was all for living fast. Not so much dying young, but he figured Tony was only saying it because he had to be a parent to a kid who jumped off a roof recently.

It wasn’t a lack of love that made Sirius relieved to not be Harry’s primary caregiver, it was a lack of wanting the responsibility. Sirius would do it if he had to, but Merlin was he relieved Harry had Tony.

Being a fun uncle was really more Sirius’ style anyway, he and James had agreed on that before Harry had even been born. Remus was meant to be the parental one - if Sirius and Remus had married like they’d planned, if Harry went to them, if Sirius hadn’t considered Remus to be the traitor and Remus hadn’t believed it was Sirius, if… if… if…

“How’d tutoring go?” Sirius asked Harry abruptly, pushing away the foggy thoughts that wanted to drop his mood low. Sirius was determined to use his newfound freedom to be happy. And thinking about the past was a sure fire way to cock that up.

Except it seemed like tutoring was a sore subject as well.

Harry glowered at Tony accusingly when he answered Sirius. “I can’t clear my fucking mind because sometimes I can’t focus.”

“That’s not what we were saying,” Tony said with an unhappy little pucker between his brows. “Kid, I get it, really. I think ADHD made us rich, but you’d have an easier go at it if you just wanted to look at some of the options for treatment.”

“You could probably find something that treated ADHD and depression at the same time,” Happy interjected, earning identical scoffs from Harry and Tony that made Sirius snicker.

“What’s ADHD?” Sirius whispered to James while what seemed like Tony and Tony the Second argued with each other.

“No idea,” James murmured back while his eyes were locked on Harry. “Sounds like a sex disease. Can we get the fuck out of here now?”

Sirius grinned while Harry continued arguing with his dad, ignorant to the others around them.

“Yeah,” Sirius laughed and pushed his plate away from him. “Let’s get out of here.”

 

Once they made hasty excuses and slipped away to the lower level where Sirius had began to make himself at home, James was clearly on edge. He paced around the sitting room in a twitchy manner, his eyes flickering to the doorways and the windows in agitation.

“Want a drink?” Sirius offered. Thor wasn’t around, probably off pestering Clint or Nat, so the two of them had the place to themselves. James nodded in an aborted motion so Sirius strutted to the kitchen with as much confidence as he could keep up.

Sirius may have made it a habit to pick up blokes lately - with the odd woman thrown in the mix, women were attractive enough with their curves and their long hair, but Sirius found men to be wittier and more open to rougher experiences - but Sirius never made it a habit to bring them back to the place where his godson lived. And he definitely had never made it a habit to introduce them to Harry.

There was something intriguing about James, something more than the classically sexy looks and the ‘tall, brooding, and muscular’ aura that drew Sirius in…

 

Sirius had been sitting at the counter of the pub he’d grown to begin calling ‘his favorite’ and was chatting up the bartender while they swapped stories about drunken mishaps.

“Listen, mate, I once took a trolley to my best mates house, showed up pissed drunk, and accidentally snogged his mum,” Sirius told the friendly bloke who served drinks in the afternoons. “The worst part was my mate saw it and he…” Sirius trailed off with a bitter twist in his stomach. “And he brought it up until the day he died,” he finished quietly.

“Tough luck, man,” the bartender, Pat, said sympathetically. He topped off Sirius’ bourbon and slid it across the counter. “If it helps any, you kissed your friend’s mom? I kissed my own mom.”

That did help, actually. Sirius threw his head back and laughed, focusing on the present instead of the past.

James would be happy for him, Sirius knew that as confidently as he knew his own name. And if the situation were reversed, Sirius would be rooting for James to laugh and love and shag and drink and be as happy as he could.

And then - like a sign from James himself - a bloke sitting at the end of the bar with a ball cap pulled low over his face spoke up.

“I kissed my best friend once, it made him cry.”

Sirius turned in interest to eye the bloke; he was fit with toned arms that couldn’t be hidden beneath his leather jacket and long dark hair that touched his shoulders.

“Yeah?” Sirius grinned and scooted over a few stools until he was beside the bloke. “Are you that bad of a kisser?”

The bloke picked his face up and Sirius was caught by the bluest eyes he’d ever seen in his life.

“I dunno,” he said, his voice smoky and rich, like the bourbon that Sirius had been sipping. “Interested in finding out?”

“You’re forward,” Sirius smirked. He nodded to the bartender, silently asking for a refill of the bloke’s empty glass. “What’s your name?”

The bloke smirked at Sirius with a glint of interest in those eyes that Sirius wanted to drown in.

“James,” he said. He offered Sirius a fake hand, one made of shiny silver metal. “You can call me Bucky.”

Sirius sent a small grin up to the ceiling, shaking his head in disbelief. When James wanted to send Sirius a sign, he certainly wasn’t subtle.

 

“Yeah, a drink, thanks,” James said. He paused by the windows that made up the wall in the flat and looked out at the twinkling New York skyline that Sirius was becoming rather fond of.

“It’s weird being here,” James murmured when Sirius joined him and handed over a glass of scotch from the bottle he pilfered from Clint’s flat last time he’d been down there for a game of cards.

“Yeah?” Sirius grinned and leaned against the window, admiring James more than the view. James was striking, all muscular with a jawline made to cut glass and eyes that caught anyone’s attention in a room. “Are you from here?”

“Queens,” James said flatly. “I grew up there. I haven’t been home in a long time. I didn’t really plan on ever coming back.”

Sirius hummed in mild agreement, returning home when you never wanted to was a nightmare in itself.

“I’m glad you did,” Sirius said coyly, swinging his hand out to grab James’ arm. Sirius slid himself closer, hoping to return the mood to something more sensual and less depressing.

And then as soon as Sirius reached up for James’ jaw, hoping to draw him in for a heated kiss that could lead to the shag Sirius had been looking for, James twitched and snatched his hand just before Sirius touched him.

Sirius let out an oomph of pain when James held his wrist too tightly and twisted it around, pinning it behind his back. Sirius tried to laugh, but it came out as a cry when James yanked his wrist up higher, threatening to dislocate his shoulder.

“Who are you?” James asked harshly, his voice like gravel in Sirius’ ear.

Sirius’ heart was racing a bit in his chest, unsettled by the change in tone. Sirius was also uncertain for his best course of action. He never minded a rough shag, it was why Sirius tended to prefer blokes or women that looked like they could break him in half, but if James wasn’t fucking around then Sirius didn’t even have his wand to curse the bastard with.

“Sirius,” Sirius grunted to James when he twitched his wrist up higher and Sirius felt a real chance that he was going to have his arm broken. “James? James, you good?”

“Who sent you?” James demanded. He slammed Sirius against the glass wall and pressed himself against Sirius’ back in a way that wasn’t actually much of a turn on. “Answer me or I’ll rip this entire fucking arm off,” James growled.

Why did Sirius always find the crazy ones?

Like attracted like, probably.

“I fucking live here,” Sirius said. He grunted again when James yanked his arm higher. “Get your bloody hand off me before I make you regret it, Bucky.”

Sirius had been mocking him, pissed at the position James shoved him in and trying to piss him off with his daft nickname, but a shudder went through James’ body that Sirius could feel.

“I…” James let go of Sirius’ wrist and leapt away from him.

Sirius cradled his injured arm, probably strained, and turned to glower at James… he meant to, but then he saw James’ face.

James was panting heavily and his face had lost all color. He was looking around Sirius’ flat as if he’d never seen it before.

“I’m sorry- I’m sorry,” James whispered, still staring around sightlessly. “I… fuck. I’m sorry.”

“Hey…” Sirius frowned and reached out for him with the arm that didn’t ache like a bitch. “Mate, you good?”

“Don’t touch me!” James yelled, twitching from Sirius’ reach. “I- I’m leaving, don’t- don’t fucking follow me.”

Sirius blinked and James ran from the flat, escaping down the staircase.

“I wasn’t going to follow you,” Sirius muttered to himself. “Bloody mad man.”

After snagging his wand from on the shelf he kept it by the lift, Sirius healed his arm up and cleaned the broken glasses from where they’d been dropped during the quick interaction.

Sirius slammed his drink back and then hunted around for his pack of smokes. If he’d ever earned a smoke, it was then. Out of respect to Thor, and because Sirius didn’t want to set off the smoke detectors again, Sirius wandered down the stairs once he was sure James had plenty of time to make his getaway.

 

“Crazy blokes with blue eyes and metal fingers,” Sirius muttered when he stepped outside. He snagged a cigarette from the pack and lit it with the tip of his wand. “I knew you couldn’t trust blokes with blue eyes…”

“Who do you know with blue eyes?”

Sirius’ head snapped up and he saw his godson sitting on the front steps of the tower with his phone in his hand and an unhappy scowl on his face.

“Pettigrew had blue eyes,” Sirius told Harry after he blew smoke away from where Harry sat. “Little late for you to be out here, isn’t it? Don’t you have school in the morning?”

“I’m thinking about skipping,” Harry said carelessly, arrogant little berk. He turned his phone over and over in his hands and Sirius waited patiently, sure there was something on his mind.

Sirius sat down beside him and propped his hand on the concrete behind Harry’s back. It was close enough that Harry knew Sirius was there, but not so close that Harry felt suffocated by touch.

It was a fine line to walk but damn if Sirius wasn’t brilliant at it. Sadly, it was another instance of like recognizing like.

Sirius just attracted the broken and mad like a magnet.

“Tony wants to take me to see a doctor,” Harry finally said, his eyes trained on his phone. “He said I’ve got a deficit in my brain and Hermione agreed with him and I just called Pepper and guess what?”

“Pepper agreed too?” Sirius guessed.

“Yeah.” Harry sounded truly putout about it. He sighed and his shoulders slumped forward. Sirius watched while he tapped his foot in an irritated rhythm. “I saw your date leave, what happened?”

Sirius chuckled and let the conversation shift. If Harry didn’t want to talk about it, Sirius wasn’t forcing him. He was probably lucky Harry was talking to him at all after Sirius let the Umbridge secret out to Tony- Harry could hold a hell of a grudge.

“Turns out he’s crazier than I am,” Sirius said. He finished his cigarette and stubbed it out on the stairs they sat on. “Just my luck, eh kiddo?”

“He didn’t seem crazy, he seemed… scared,” Harry finally settled on. Sirius shrugged, not too worried about one random bloke one way or another.

“I’ll have better luck next time,” Sirius grinned. He nudged Harry with his shoulder playfully. “Tell me about your boyfriend though, what’s up with you two?”

Harry scowled again and inched away from Sirius just a little. “He’s being a dick,” Harry said bluntly. “I know his uncle died and he’s sad, but he’s getting in fights and screaming at me in the halls and it’s fucking embarrassing, Siri.”

Sirius tried to remember being a teenager and the days he spent fighting anyone who would fight him and pushing all his best mates away. Sirius really tried to remember, but all he could think of was how his James, the only James that really mattered, never let Sirius’ prickly exterior push him away.

Just like Sirius never let James’ prickly son push him away.

“Give him time, kiddo,” Sirius told Harry bracingly. When Sirius looked out across the street he caught something that made him grin.

“Or not.” Sirius stood up and stretched before he ruffled Harry’s hair playfully. “Don’t stay out too late, skipping school is harder than it sounds.”

Harry looked up from where he’d been frowning at the ground and then his eyes caught on what Sirius had seen and Sirius knew his efforts were unneeded.

 

Sirius whistled on his way back up to his flat, leaving Harry and his boyfriend to talk. Sure, Sirius might have struck out, but it was still a good evening.

In fact, Sirius grabbed his bottle of pilfered scotch and made his way upward to Tony’s flat. It seemed like Harry would be busy for a while and Sirius could use a distraction.

Chapter Text

“Anthony Edward Stark, you have got to be kidding me!”

Tony groaned and rolled to face his bedroom door, blinking blearily until the very angry lady made sense to his hungover brain.

“Pep, hey.” Tony propped himself up on his elbow and rubbed his eyes with his hand. “You’re home?”

Pepper slapped her hand on the wall, sending a bright light to flood Tony’s room and cause him to wince and groan.

“Tony, tell me why your son called me last night nearly in tears because you said his brain was wired wrong and a magic hammer said he’s a bad person and then you can tell me why Sirius Black is asleep in your bed?!”

Tony turned his head and looked at the messy head of black hair beside him and grinned when he looked back at Pepper.

“Slumber party,” Tony said innocently. He sat up and stretched, paying no mind to his complete nudity. Pepper had seen him naked more than once, unfortunately Tony was certain she was immune to the sight by that point.

Pepper kicked the door shut behind her and approached Tony like a lion stalked its prey. A very sexy, angry, lion that looked like it was starving for a bite of Tony… and not in the fun way.

“I leave you alone for a couple of weeks and you unleash some robot monster, you move some random enhanced adults in the house where your son lives, and you sleep with his godfather?”

“Wha’?” Sirius groaned and rolled around, his pale arm landing heavily against Tony’s legs that were still on the bed.

“Rise and shine,” Tony told him, prodding him in the side. “Cops are here to bust the party.”

Sirius blinked heavily, his eyes unfocused until Pepper actually growled and Sirius looked guiltily up at her.

“Do you morons have any idea what time it is?” Pepper asked. “It is ten am,” she hissed, answering her own question. “Which leads me to wonder why the hell Harry isn’t at school?”

Sirius nodded slowly, properly cowed by Pepper as all men with more than three brain cells were.

“If you’d just turn around so I can put my pants on I’m sure I can think of an excuse by then,” Sirius told her charmingly. “Unless you’d rather take your skirt off and climb in?”

Tony smiled up at the ceiling when Pepper growled at them again and stormed from the room.

“Good attempt, bad timing,” Tony told Sirius. He leaned back against his headboard and gave Sirius an appreciative look when he literally rolled out of Tony’s bed and jumped up. Sirius was a good looking guy, a wild ride in bed, and damn if he didn’t have a filthy mouth on him, but…

“We can’t do this again,” Tony said with a twinge of regret. He got up as well and tossed Sirius’ boxers to him. “Harry, well, you saw how he was last night.”

Apparently Harry had a snarky little jealous streak and boy had that kid not liked Sirius’ date one damn bit. Tony wasn’t a fan either, any guy who ran away with his tail between his legs wasn’t worth much anyway.

“Yeah,” Sirius nodded and caught his boxers easily. He smirked at Tony when he saw Tony eyeing a tattoo he had on his rib cage, some sort of poetry in Latin. “Wanna not do this again after we get a quick shower?”

Tony considered for a moment.

“What Harry doesn’t know can’t hurt him,” he quipped.

 

Tony snuck out of his room nearly an hour later, waiting to make sure the coast was clear before he shooed Sirius away to go back to his own place.

“Good morning,” Tony sang to Harry and Pepper when he made his way to the living room where his son and his future wife sat. Tony glanced at the clock and amended himself while he took a seat on the couch beside Harry. “Afternoon, really.”

“We all need to chat,” Pepper said, ignoring Tony’s attempt at nonchalance. Harry already looked like he’d been verbally whipped into submission. He had his head bowed and his hands were twitching nervously on his lap.

Tony took the chance to be a reassuring parent who stands beside his kid when they were facing down enemy fire. He stretched his arm behind Harry, letting it rest just behind him. Harry glanced over at him and his cheek twitched like he was trying to smile but wasn’t exactly sure how.

Point, Tony.

“Why are you not at school?” Pepper asked Harry, much more snappily than she usually spoke to the kid.

“Senior skip day,” Harry said tonelessly.

“You are a sophomore.”

“Sophomore skip day then.”

“Tony, your son has to go to school.”

Tony shrugged and smiled winningly. “But it’s sophomore skip day.”

Pepper’s eyes were narrowed so much that Tony wondered if she could even see through the slits.

“Tony, you are an irredeemable man-child with more brains than common sense.”

Tony tilted his head in recognition. “Thank you.”

Pepper looked toward Harry who actually cringed in Tony’s side. Not much, but enough that Tony knew he was finally an ‘ally’ and not enemy to his kid.

“And you are a wonderful child who is going to see a pediatrician, a dentist, an optometrist, and a freaking therapist today.”

Harry licked his lips and held Pepper’s gaze evenly for a long moment while they seemed to weigh each others determination.

“I thought I had school,” Harry finally said.

Pepper’s death stare cracked then and she finally smiled, proving she was human after all.

“And since you decided to skip, your dad’s going to prove he’s a responsible adult by taking you to your appointments,” Pepper told Harry firmly, all business. “Isn’t that right, Tony?”

“Hm?” Tony nodded when Pepper and Harry both looked at him. “Oh yeah, yeah, I am absolutely the responsible adult who will take Harry to all those appointments.”

Sorely overdue appointments, even to an irredeemable ‘man-child’. Kids had germs and diseases and cavities and even magical kids needed to have their eyes examined and their teeth professionally cleaned.

“And now I am going to go figure out why we have three new houseguests, news reports about the Avengers blowing up foreign villages, and then I’m going to find Happy and chew his ass.”

“What’d Happy do?” Harry asked when Pepper stood up.

Pepper rolled her eyes to the ceiling. “He didnt call me the second Tony started letting everything fall apart.” Pepper snatched her phone from her pocket and pressed a few quick buttons. “Harry’s first appointment is at one, Tony, don’t be late.”

Tony sat on the couch beside Harry while they watched Hurricane Pepper strut from the room with her heels clacking loudly.

“I’m going to convince her to marry me one day,” Tony sighed happily, admiring the shape of Pepper’s ass through the tweed skirt she wore. Damn if Tony could ever stand to have anyone else whip his ass when it was needed.

Harry snorted and shoved Tony’s arm off him so he could get up and hopefully change from his scruffy pajamas to normal clothes.

“Not if you keep shagging Sirius she won’t,” Harry said lightly. “Can we at least get lunch before I’m fucking tortured?”

Tony wasn’t caught by surprise often, but he was then. It was one night, it was discreet.

“Sure, kid, lunch then torture,” he agreed faintly. “Whatever you want.”

Hurricane Pepper had left nothing but destruction and casualties behind and Tony wasn’t actually sure that he was the man to play the role of the Red Cross.

 

As an olive branch, Tony let Harry take control of the radio while he drove them around town. The two of them got burgers and fries for lunch and had to move their asses quickly if they wanted to make it to the dentist Pepper set Harry up at.

“Hermione’s parents are dentists,” Harry said when they pulled in the lot and the two of them were staring up at the building with the smiling tooth on it. Tony glanced at Harry and saw that he had a distinct look of disgust on his face.

And just beneath the disgust, Tony thought maybe there was a touch of fear there.

“I see a dentist every month,” Tony said casually. He smiled widely, showing his pearly whites off to his kid. “You think these babies are just immune to coffee stains? I know I make looking good look easy, but dentists probably do at least ten percent of the work.”

Harry didn’t look impressed while he studied Tony’s teeth, but he did nod.

“Does it… is it…”

“Completely painless,” Tony assured him, guessing at his question. He turned the car off and flicked his sunglasses down to cover his face. “The quicker we get this over with the quicker we move on to the pediatrician.”

“I’ll be sure to take my time then,” Harry grimaced. He rolled his shoulders and then opened his car door. “If they try and yank my teeth I’m going to get violent.”

“They aren’t the tooth fairy, kid,” Tony laughed. “It’s a dentist, easy-peasy.”

Harry’s middle finger seemed to disagree, but aside from some flirting by the receptionist old enough to be Tony’s mother, their appointment went smoothly enough.

 

“Seems like I’ll never have to shell money out for braces,” Tony told Harry while they made their way to their next appointment with the pediatrician. Even though Harry had been short and evasive during his appointment, a few x-rays and exam later had dubbed him with perfect teeth. “Your mom had nice teeth too, James were a little crooked.”

“Were they?” Harry turned down the god awful emo crap he’d been trying to bust Tony’s speakers with to talk. “They don’t look crooked in photos.”

Tony squinted while he drove and tried to remember precisely what James Potter’s teeth had looked like.

“Yeah, his… his front teeth on the bottom… one of them were twisted over, overlapping on the one beside it.”

“Peter has a crooked tooth,” Harry said abruptly. “He should get fucking braces.”

Tony chuckled at Harry’s acidic tone and eyed him thoughtfully. “Things not going so great with your geek?”

“No,” Harry said. He reached out and turned the radio back up to full volume so Tony assumed their charming little father-son moment had ended.

 

The pediatrician Pepper found had Harry a red-faced mess almost instantly.

Tony had no problem with Dr Avery, and he was a big fan of the way he pretended to not recognize Tony’s name at all, but Harry’s reactions were the funniest thing he’d ever seen.

“He’s hot,” Tony quipped when Dr Avery left the exam room they were in so Harry could get changed. Dr Avery was young, but he had dark skin, bright blue eyes, and a knack of speaking teenage boy.

Harry scowled at Tony. “Maybe you should shag him next,” he said. “You already shagged my godfather, what’s my doctor after that?”

Tony leaned against the counter and grinned at his son. Harry was sitting on the exam bed in a green gown, his cheeks still glowing red from the list of questions Dr Avery had asked him.

As humiliating as Harry thought it was to have some young hot doctor asking about his sexual history, Tony was just relieved to know that his kid was a self-reported virgin. Which was completely wild because Tony used to think that if he had a son that he’d want him to be a player like Tony used to be.

But being faced with his own actual kid, Tony had been whispering prayers of thanks that Harry had stuttered his way through claims of innocence.

“Doctors make terrible lovers,” Tony told Harry with a smirk. “They’re know-it-alls, they think just because they took a couple of anatomy classes that suddenly they’re the experts.”

“He is the bloody expert,” Harry scoffed. “Or he better be.”

Avery knocked on the door and poked his head in, “All ready?”

“Sure,” Tony called cheerfully. He glanced at Harry. “I can wait outside for this part if you want.”

Tony sure as hell wouldn’t have wanted Howard around when he got a physical from a hot doctor, but Harry shook his head so Tony hung around.

“Vitals are good, blood pressure’s a little high though,” Avery said pleasantly after checking Harry’s vitals. “Under some stress?”

Tony coughed to cover a laugh and winked when Harry glared at him with promises of death in his eyes.

“Yes,” Harry said curtly, a brand new blush burning his face. “A lot of stress.”

“And hormones,” Tony added, unable to hold his tongue. He smiled at Harry when Harry gave him a deep look of betrayal. “Lots of hormones.”

‘I will kill you,’ Harry mouthed over Avery’s shoulder.

‘Bring it on,’ Tony mouthed right back.

“So, Doc, what’s the current trend for treating ADHD?” Tony asked the doctor when he was finishing up Harry’s physical exam.

“Is that a concern?” Dr Avery asked. He looped his stethoscope around his neck and looked at Harry closely, hopefully noticing the nonstop fidgeting the kid did with his hands.

How Tony didn’t notice it in his own kid was beyond him. He couldn’t count how many times he’d had doctors saying he had attention disorders and needed medicine.

Tony always shot them down; he’d built a fortune on his hyper-fixations and mind that didn’t sleep. But Tony had also went to traditional schools and didn’t need any help focusing on studies, so he firmly moved himself to a different category than he placed Harry’s needs in.

“It is,” Tony said pleasantly. He ignored Harry’s pissed off face and tried to be the adult in the room. “I had a consult with a neurologist, Stephen Strange, and he said we should try a low dose of Adderall and Lexapro.”

“Stephen Strange, the neurosurgeon who invented the Strange Method, recommended Lexapro for ADHD?” Avery asked, those blue eyes suddenly sharp.

Tony kept up a polite smile, hoping like hell that the good doctor remembered who was footing the bill for the appointment.

“Stephen Strange, the neurologist who made his recommendation after I gave him an extensive history on my son, recommended that Harry take both medications.”

Harry looked between the two of them, his head bouncing side to side like a spectator at a tennis match.

“And Harry is sitting right here, wondering what the fuck Lexapro and Adderall is,” Harry interrupted the stare off. “Or does it not matter what I want?”

Avery turned away from Tony to give Harry a wide smile.

“Tell you gentlemen what, if Doctor Strange made the recommendation, I’ll coordinate with him to get a full history.” Avery grabbed a script pad from his lab pocket and wrote a couple prescriptions. “And like I tell all parents,” Avery turned that winning smile to Tony, “I’ll write the script, but it’s up to you to ensure compliance. I’ll have the nurse bring in a list of side-effects and things to watch for when she comes to do the blood work, alright?”

“Sounds good.” Tony accepted the scripts then shook Avery’s hand. “Thanks, doc.”

Avery gave them both a smile after he shook Harry’s hand and swiftly left the room. Tony looked at Harry, preparing for the inevitable argument against the medicine, and instead was faced with a pale faced and trembling teenager.

“What’s blood work?” Harry asked Tony in a faint whisper, his eyes round and definitely, inappropriately, terrified. “They’re going to take my blood?”

Tony wracked his brain, trying to figure out if Harry had always harbored a fear of needles.

“They just want to check for shit like your blood count and thyroid levels,” Tony explained. He moved closer to Harry and leaned against the bed instead of the counter he’d been holding up. “It’s just a quick stick, kid, I swear.”

“No, they can’t.” Harry slid off the bed and grabbed his jeans and began pulling them up with his hands shaking. “Please, they can’t take my blood.”

“Woah.” Tony reached out and grabbed Harry’s shoulder when he tried pulling his gown off. Harry jerked from Tony’s grip so Tony held his hands up placatingly.

“Kid, it’s one quick stick,” Tony assured him soothingly. “Nothing weird, it’s routine.”

“I cannot,” Harry snarled, spinning and glaring at Tony. “I cannot.”

“Okay, you can’t,” Tony sat on the abandoned exam bed and tried to stay calm if Harry was going to have some sort of panic attack. A doctors office was a good place for a panic attack, peak placement, really.

Harry seemed to settle some when Tony spoke and he took a deep and shuddering breath while he twisted his tshirt between his hands. His eyes were still flicking around the room and he was more pale than Tony thought the situation really called for, but he wasn’t stripping and redressing himself anymore.

“I’m not scared,” Harry said firmly. “I’m not.”

“I believe you,” Tony said. He crossed his legs at the ankle and watched his son with as much calm as he could. “You’re not scared.”

Even though the kid clearly was. He looked like Steve when he was confronted with too much technology, he was all twitchy and sweaty.

“Is it important? The- the blood work?” Harry asked Tony hesitantly, sounding so childlike.

Tony nodded, “Did I mention it helps screen for things like cancer? Because it does.”

“Fine.” Harry took a few deep breaths and then climbed back on the exam bed beside Tony. “Fine.”

Tony didn’t say anything, he just thought about the scripts in his pocket and the pale kid beside him. When the nurse came in with a tray of blood vials and a needle, Tony continued not saying when Harry’s right hand twitched just before the nurse stuck him.

And neither of them said anything when Tony slid his hand over and placed it on Harry’s and let Harry squeeze the feeling from his fingers while the nurse took his blood.

 

“One more stop!” Tony said bracingly when the two of them finished up at the optometrist and Harry was diagnosed with perfect vision.

Harry was quiet and moody since they left the pediatricians office, but he groaned in the passenger seat then.

“Or we could just skip and tell Pepper we went there?” Harry suggested.

Tony laughed and shook his head while they flew down the highway, headed to their final stop.

“Sorry, kid, I love you, but she terrifies me,” Tony said honestly. “What do you want to do afterward? Got plans with your friends or do you want to do something with your old man?”

“I don’t have any friends,” Harry said flatly. He turned and looked out the window and Tony felt for him, he really did.

“What about that perky blonde? Gwen?” Tony asked.

Harry snorted. “I’m one of her fifty closest friends.”

“Pietro?”

Harry rolled his eyes, Tony could see him in the windows reflection. “He pushed me out a window, we aren’t friends.”

“Fair point,” Tony acquiesced. He cleared his throat before trying one more. “And your geek?”

Harry was quiet while they kept driving and Tony waited to see if he’d be told to fuck off or if Harry would just ignore him completely. What Tony didn’t expect, was for Harry to shrug his shoulders up and actually respond.

“I think we’re over,” Harry said. He coughed and kept his face turned from Tony, but he sounded pretty damn devastated. “He came over last night and we talked and he said- he said he needs time. Time to think, I guess.”

Tony looked over where Harry was slumped in his seat, sounding miserable, talking about his first breakup. And it was Harry, his son, the same kid that had to deal with his dad sleeping with his godfather and a recent mugging and getting his blood drawn even though he’d been completely terrified.

It was Harry, Tony’s kid, that had been through hell lately and everyone kept expecting him to act like an adult - go to school, take a prescription, learn chemistry and magic - and it seemed to slip past them that Harry was just a fifteen year old kid.

“Fuck it.” Tony spun the steering wheel of the car, pulling a U-turn in the middle of the highway, and began speeding in the opposite direction on the 278.

“What are we doing?” Harry asked, sounding entirely too lifeless for a freaking teenager.

Teenagers were supposed to be energetic and annoying and loud and eat all the food in the house. That’s what the teenagers on sitcoms did, the ones with the normal families and problems that were solved in twenty-five minutes or less.

Those were the teenagers Tony wanted to be and those were the teenagers Tony wanted his son to be.

If not all the time, then at least for one god damned day.

“We are turning our cell phones off, keeping our heads low, and avoiding Pepper for the next week,” Tony told him cheerfully. “That therapists office will be there tomorrow, but you know what won’t be?”

Harry sounded excited, even just a touch. “What’s that?”

“Luna Park,” Tony declared. “You can’t call yourself a New York citizen if you’ve never seen Luna Park, kid. I know, it’s my fault,” Tony shook a finger in his own face. “Bad, Dad, bad!”

“So we’re skipping therapy, probably pissing Pepper off, and going to a park?” Harry asked. He laughed, quietly, but still a laugh, when Tony nodded. “She’s going to be furious,” he said happily.

Tony winked at Harry. “That’s why we’re lying low after this. You’ll take these pills and go to school every day and I’ll go to work and not have Sirius come over for naked slumber parties and she’ll forgive us in a couple of days.”

Harry stared blankly at Tony with his eyebrow raised.

“Yeah, we might have to change the locks,” Tony agreed with his son’s silent judgement. “But hey, what’s one angry redhead against us?”

Harry grinned at him and relaxed in his seat. “Angry redheads are terrifying,” he said. He turned the radio up when a rock song switched on. “Remind me to tell you about Ginny Weasley sometime!”

 

Another point, Tony. He really was on a roll with the whole parenting thing.

Take that, Sirius.

 

Tony wasn’t a big fan of Coney Island or Luna Park, too many people and too much noise, but he’d never went with his own kid before.

Harry shed his leather jacket and tossed on a Knicks cap that Tony gave him when they arrived. Tony hit up an ATM on their way in and then let Harry loose.

And, surprisingly, Harry actually let loose.

Tony let Harry drag him around while they threw darts and tested their strength and won stupid prizes that they handed off to little kids that kept shrieking for toys. They got corn dogs and cotton candy and Harry laughed his ass off when fed some of his corn dog breading to a pigeon and got crap on his shoe in thanks.

They played putt-putt golf and laser tag- which Tony totally kicked the kid’s ass. Harry rode his first rollercoaster and Tony bought two prints of Harry’s face when they had been riding down the slope. They also took pictures at a photo boot- Harry had been scowling in the first photo, then he’d been rolling his eyes in the second, and finally smiling in the third one.

 

“This was way better than sitting in a therapists office and talking about our feelings,” Tony grinned when the park announced they were closing and the two of them were headed to the car. Tony had his arm around Harry’s shoulders and Harry had two large bags of cotton candy in his arm.

“I think that roller coaster was as good as flying,” Harry said. For probably the first time since Tony met him, Harry actually looked like a teenager. He had a grin on his lips and a little twinkle in his eyes that made Tony have the warm and fuzzies.

“Nothing beats flying,” Tony said seriously. He unlocked the car with a click of his keys when the two of them got close enough and he had a sudden idea when he looked from his keys to Harry. “Hey, you want to drive?”

Harry tripped over his own feet and looked at Tony with hope written all over his face. “I don’t know how.”

“We had a lesson once,” Tony waved off Harry’s concerns. “Come on, you’ll be old enough for your permit soon, might as well get some practice in.”

“What if I wreck the car or scratch it or pop a tire?” Harry asked.

“Then we call the insurance company and get it fixed up or we go car shopping this weekend,” Tony said. He dangled the keys temptingly. “What do you say?”

Harry reached out then pulled his hand back. “I googled Lexapro.”

“Did you?” Tony asked, surprised.

“I text my friend Hermione.”

Tony grinned. The kid had the whole internet at his fingertips and he relied solely on one bushy haired daughter of dentists, there was something to be said for codependency.

“And?” Tony asked.

“And…” Harry clenched his jaw from side to side and looked at the keys Tony still held out for him. “And it might be a nice change of pace if I wasn’t always thinking about jumping off rooftops,” Harry said quietly with a quick glance to Tony.

Tony’s heart soared with pride. He looked at his kid, his son, who was already three times the man Tony himself was. Tony was an arrogant bastard who scoffed at modern medicine and drowned his demons in booze and bodies. And his kid - his incredibly messed up kid with the shittiest luck - was facing his head on.

“Good.” Tony pressed the keys in Harry’s hands and opened the drivers side door for him. “I’m proud of you, Harry.”

Harry rolled his eyes, the sentimental moment passed and he climbed in the drivers seat. Tony laughed, feeling on top of the world, and climbed in the passenger seat.

 

Sure, Harry immediately backed in a light pole and dented the trunk of the car, but when they stood outside and inspected the damage together, Harry also gave him an apologetic grimace and a quiet, “Sorry, Dad.”

 

And he didn’t even take it back.

Chapter Text

Friday, September 28

Harry felt tired when he drug himself to breakfast. He hadn’t slept great, he felt… shaky.

Harry’s insides felt shaky which wasn’t normal and even with all of Harry’s ‘episodes’, he knew it wasn’t normal.

“Morning, kid, how you feeling?”

“Fine,” Harry lied in an exhausted mumble. Harry’s fingers looked like they were trembling when he reached for the cup of coffee Tony offered him. It was a movement that didn’t go unnoticed by Tony.

“Tremors are normal side effects of the Adderall,” he said. “Having any nausea? Feeling lightheaded? Dry mouth?”

Yes, yes, and yes.

“No,” Harry said. He wrapped his hands around the cup of coffee and let the heat seep through his skin. He’d been taking the two medications for three days already and he felt awful. He didn’t feel ‘focused’ or ‘happy’, just… tired and shaky.

It had been stupid to think that he’d find happiness in a pill or take a medicine and suddenly start understanding chemistry. Harry had gotten his hopes up, thinking maybe Hermione was right and it would be like treating a cold with a Pepper-Up Potion, but Hermione was wrong.

There was a first time for everything, apparently.

Tony watched Harry closely during breakfast and Harry felt his eyes on the back of his head when Harry took one of the orange and white pills—

ADHD medicine in the mornings, antidepressants in the evenings

—and Harry turned snarkily and stuck his tongue out.

“I took it, happy?” Harry scowled. He snatched his backpack off the floor beneath the table. “Bye.”

“Bye, kid, have fun!” Tony called at his back. “Love you!”

Harry turned and barely had the energy to roll his eyes at him before he got on the lift for another fun-filled day of high school.

 

As excited as Harry had once been for school, it was what Tony called ‘an exercise in patience’ for him recently. It was the same routine every day that week- Harry saw Peter covered in bruises or cuts, Peter avoided Harry, and Harry ignored Peter.

Gwen tried to play go-between with them, but Harry wasn’t in the mood for it that day.

“He’s still mourning,” Gwen said loudly, so fucking loudly, while she walked Harry to his locker so he could grab books for his first class of the day. “You just have to give him time.”

Harry hummed and tried to make his clumsy fingers work on his lock. Why did lockers even need a lock? All Harry had in his were textbooks, notebooks, and a mess of ink pens and dull pencils. Who would bother stealing them?

When a sudden rush of anger about why he had to lock up bloody pencils washed over Harry, he swatted the lock harshly and caused it to bounce off the metal and then settle right back in place.

Mocking him.

“What’s your code?” Gwen asked, nudging Harry to the side with her hip.

“07-03-01,” Harry told her flatly, glaring at the lock like it was the root cause of all his problems.

Gwen looked at Harry and grinned, little dimples popping in her cheeks. “As in July 31st?” she checked.

Harry shrugged, refusing to be embarrassed about it. “As in something easy to remember so that my inattentive and wrongly wired and depressed brain can’t possibly forget because it’s TYPED OUT ON MY ID!” Harry aimed a heavy kick to his locker, popping it open the instant that Gwen got the lock off.

“Wow.” Gwen stood there and watched Harry while he glared at the absolute mess inside his locker.

“What?” Harry snapped at her, misplacing his anger at himself, Peter, life, on Gwen.

Gwen, with terrible timing, grinned at Harry and raised a too perfectly shaped eyebrow.

“What’d you get?” she asked.

“What’d I get what?” Harry asked bitterly while he quickly snatched his English textbook.

“Well you got your very own SSRI now, right?” Gwen asked. She crossed her arms over her chest, holding her smile. “So what did you get? Zoloft? Paxil? What pills are making you all cranky and pale?”

Harry waited until the other kids around them, the ones that stopped to whisper about Harry Stark screaming and kicking his locker, wandered off to answer Gwen.

“Lexapro,” Harry told her slowly. “And… and Adderall.”

“Aah.” Gwen looped her arm in Harry’s and smiled at him, Harry’s momentary outburst easily forgiven apparently. “Lexapro is such a bitch, but Adderall? You could totally sell Adderall for like $10 a pop if you wanted.”

Harry still felt crappy, like he was three days post-crucio, but he laughed then in the face of Gwen’s constant pep. Harry swore that the school could explode, hundreds of people could die, and Gwen would find something positive to say about it.

Peter used to agree with him. They used to play a game where they made up increasingly dramatic and morbid situations and then tried to pretend to be Gwen, finding a silver lining.

“Okay, meteor crashes from the sky, blows a hole in the middle of the city, hundreds are dead, more are injured. What’s Gwen say?”

“What an interesting opportunity to study outer space!”

Harry saw Peter up the hall, turning toward his junior English classroom, and he scowled.

“I’ve got plenty of money, why would I sell my medicine?” Harry asked Gwen, his previous mirth gone. “And why would anyone buy them?”

Gwen laughed when she stopped outside Harry’s English class. She patted Harry on the head condescendingly and shook her head at him playfully.

“Oh, Harry, my sweet summer child,” she cooed. “You have so much to learn. I’ll see you later. Toodles!”

Harry stealthily pulled his phone out during his second hour class and hesitated between texting Hermione or searching it up on the internet. In an effort to not listen to Hermione complain about Harry texting her during class, Harry went to the Internet.

‘Selling Adderall for money’

Harry got a crash course on drug use during second hour and just before he walked in third hour he got a text from Tony.

If you need money, let me know. No need to sell your pills.

Harry rolled his eyes and sent Tony a quick reply before he had to go to Spanish.

I’m not. Why are you being nosy again?

Harry pocketed his phone and quickly made his way to class, needing to get there before Peter so he could get a seat away from him.

“Harry!”

Harry looked up from where he’d been glaring at the floor in surprise and saw a girl in his grade, Brittany, waving at him in the back corner of the class. She was one of the ‘art kids’, as Gwen had called her, and Harry had seen her around the school recently.

“Thanks,” Harry said, sliding in the empty corner desk beside her. He hadn’t talked much to Brittany, but every time Harry did she was always polite, if a bit snarky, to him.

Brittany smirked and tucked a lock of her black and green hair behind her ear. “No problem. I figured you were trying to avoid Peter.”

“I am, a bit,” Harry said. He yawned and propped his chin in his hand, exhausted. “And teachers; the more teachers I can avoid, the longer I can sleep.”

“No worries,” Britany said. She stretched out and propped her chunky black boots on the basket of the desk in front of her. “Señorita Carmen won’t see you behind Mike’s big head.”

Harry snorted; their classmate Mike did have a rather large head. It was something Harry never appreciated before he was able to slump down behind him and hope to sleep for a bit.

It was one of the brilliant things about muggle schools, kids just slept everywhere all the time. Harry saw kids sleeping in classes, in hallways, even slumped over the table at lunch.

While Brittany was doodling on the cover of her notebook, drawing little loops that were almost hypnotic to watch come to life, Harry could feel someone looking at him. When Harry lifted his tired eyes, he saw Peter’s bruised ones staring at him from the opposite back corner of the room.

Peter stared at Harry and Harry saw something in his eyes, maybe even regret, but since Peter had embarrassed Harry, yelled at him, and ignored him for days, Harry just yawned pointedly and closed his eyes.

Harry could understand pushing people away and grief, it wasn’t like Harry didn’t understand grief, but Harry wasn’t going to be screamed at in the middle of the hallways.

It was embarrassing, it was demeaning, and personally Harry felt like he was six years old, stuffed in a cupboard, every time someone screamed at him.

So fuck Peter…

Peter…

Harry peeked one eye open to squint at Peter while Señorita Carmen began discussing what they would be going over that day.

What the hell was Peter’s middle name? It sounded better in Harry’s head to curse at him when he had the full name. It was like when Molly yelled at Ron or when Harry lectured Sirius…

Harry quickly ripped a scrap piece of paper out of his notebook and scrawled a question on it. He handed it to Brittany who nodded and stealthily handed it to the girl on her other side. Harry tracked the paper until it was slid on Peter’s desk.

Peter glanced down at the paper and frowned, he scribbled something and then passed it back without ever even looking at Harry.

When Brittany gave Harry back the note, Harry saw that Peter answered his simple question.

Fuck Peter Benjamin Parker.

 

Harry half-arsed dozed through third period, and fourth, and when lunch started he went out front to sit on the wall in front of the school. There were others out there, swapping snacks and chatting together, but Harry wanted to sit by himself for a while.

He pulled his phone out, plugging in his headphones and turning on something loud, and saw that Tony had text him back.

I get alerts when you start googling drugs. How’s your day?

Crappy but I think I found a way to make easy money.

Kid, the dimes and nickels still confuse you and now you’re going in the drug trade?

Harry scowled, it made no sense for the larger size coin to be worth less than the smaller silver one.

You did drugs.

Yeah, but I didn’t sell them. Plus, if you’re trying to make money in New York, cocaine is worth way more than your medicine.

Harry considered the side effects of what the Internet said about why people without ADHD wanted to buy Adderall.

If I open the capsules and the powder in them is white, do you think I can sell it to stupid kids and call it cocaine?

Tony almost immediately sent an entire screen full of faces laughing so hard they had tears coming from their eyes.

That’s my boy. Don’t sell your pills. Stay awake during your classes. Love you.

Since it seemed like Tony had Harry’s schedule memorized to the second, Harry just finished reading his message when the ball rang for fifth hour.

But when Harry hopped up and began winding his headphones up to stuff them in his pocket, he saw a bloke standing across the street on the sidewalk wearing a black jacket and ball cap. Harry blinked, and he was gone.

Which meant that the pills were giving Harry hallucinations as well, which was so bloody brilliant that Harry couldn’t even find the words to describe it.

 

Harry felt like fifth and sixth hour passed in a foggy haze, just a blur of words and piles of homework being handed out.

In Harry’s opinion, Mister Lee gave out more chemistry homework than even Snape on his worst day did.

Seventh hour was miserable though, Harry hated seventh hour. He liked it at first, but Harry hated it then. Seventh hour was when Harry was forced to participate in gym class and watch Peter run up and down the basketball court in shorts and a tshirt, never breaking a sweat, and making everyone else look like uncoordinated toddlers in comparison.

And when Harry was feeling like he was going to throw up or pass out and his fingers were clumsy and shaky, it was even worse.

“Line up!” Coach Mann, the actual name of the burly and mustached basketball coach and gym teacher, blew his whistle and had everyone line up in their gym clothes at the start of the period.

“Listen up! Thanks to a recent injury,” Coach Mann turned and narrowed his eyes at Ashley Corduroy, a pretty junior girl who was using crutches ever since she broke her ankle playing volleyball last week, “we’re going to start a new unit. How many of you have heard of cornhole?”

Harry didn’t raise his hand since he didn’t know what corn had to do with gym class, and Flash seemed to shoulder Harry on purpose when he raised his hand high.

“What’s wrong, Stark? They didn’t have sports in your fancy private school?”

“Shut up, Flash,” Peter snapped from down the row where Harry stood.

Harry turned his head and glared at Peter. “I don’t need your help, Parker.”

“I’m sorry, am I interrupting your date, gentlemen?”

Harry straightened up and glared at the floor with his face burning at Coach Man’s remark that the rest of the class snickered about.

“No, sir,” Harry mumbled, an echo to Peter’s own reply.

Coach Man started practically screaming the rules of ‘cornhole’ to them and Harry couldn’t really understand how it was meant to be a sport, but it didn’t sound very hard either.

“When I say your name, grab your partner and go stand by a board!” Coach Man yelled. “Adams and Castillo, Devon and Drayson.”

Harry had never been so thankful that Tony registered him as Stark as he was then. It would have been annoying beyond belief if he had to—

“Parker and Stark!”

Harry looked over and saw Peter staring blandly at him.

Why couldn’t Tony’s last name be… Zook?

Being Harry Zook would be loads better than being Harry Stark was in that moment.

Harry snatched four red beanbags and then backed up by the blue board across from Peter and his red board.

“You can go first,” Peter said flatly, avoiding meeting Harry’s eyes.

“Fine.” Harry grit his teeth and then tossed the beanbag, over-shooting the board and watching his bag land on the floor behind the board.

“Not so hard, Stark!” Coach Man barked, roaming around the room and getting paid to critique the way teenagers threw beanbags.

Harry’s irritation shot even higher when Peter tossed his underhand and made it land right in the center of the board by Harry’s feet. Harry threw his next one and it hit the board but didn’t make it in the hole.

“God damnit,” Harry breathed quietly, losing his temper for no real reason.

“You almost had that one,” Peter said lightly. He tossed his, another perfect shot, and had the audacity to grin at Harry.

And Harry, who had already felt like he was on a spinning ride of anger that day, did something incredibly stupid.

Harry grabbed one of his beanbags and took a step forward so he could throw it as hard as he could right at Peter’s stupid, bruised face.

“What the hell?” Peter caught the beanbag before it could even hit him and he glared at Harry. “You’re throwing shit at me now?”

“You’re talking to me now?” Harry asked. “What happened to your bloody space?”

Peter threw the beanbag he caught at Harry and Harry barely caught it before it smacked his forehead.

“You don’t understand,” Peter snapped. “You’ve got no freaking clue what I’m dealing with!”

“Yeah?” Harry threw the beanbag as hard as he could and scowled when Peter easily caught it. “You’re right, Peter, I’ve got no idea what it’s like to lose anyone! Not me, I’ve got no bloody clue at all!”

“Parker! Stark!”

“YOU’VE GOT YOUR DAD! I WATCHED THE ONLY DAD I’VE EVER KNOWN BLEED OUT ON THE STREET!” Peter screamed, ignoring the coach just as Harry did. “I COULD HAVE SAVED HIM, HARRY, AND HE DIED!”

“BOO FUCKING HOO!” Harry shouted. “I SAW MY CLASSMATE, A NICE KID, A FUCKING SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD, DIE LAST MAY! AND I COULD HAVE SAVED HIM BUT I DIDN’T! YOU DON’T SEE ME BEING A DICK OVER IT!”

“OH, REALLY?” Peter laughed hatefully and Harry felt his entire blood boiling angrily. “I GUESS THAT’S JUST ANOTHER FREAKING SECRET YOU GET TO HAVE!”

“I HAVE A HUNDRED SECRETS AND I’M NEVER TELLING YOU ANY OF THEM!”

Harry was caught by surprise when Peter threw the beanbag at him, smacking him hard enough in the head that Harry fell backwards on his arse.

“Oh, shit.” Peter ran to Harry, shoving past Coach Man, and crouched down beside him. “Shit, Harry, I’m sorry.”

Harry flinched away when Peter reached out for him and reached up to touch his head where the beanbag hit him.

“I’m bleeding,” Harry said disbelievingly, looking at the dab of blood on his fingers. He looked over at Peter with anger and shock burning in his eyes. “You made me fucking bleed.”

Peter was pale, the bruise on his left eye a startling dark circle in his colorless face. “Harry, I’m sorry, I- I didn’t…”

Coach Man stormed over to them slapped his hand on Peter’s shoulder, causing Peter to twitch.

“Parker, Stark, get to the principal’s office now,” he growled. “Move!”

Harry scrambled to his feet, his fingers absently pushing against his head, and tore through the gym, ignoring the whispers and laughs of his classmates, so he could grab his backpack and go to the principal’s office.

Fuck Peter Benjamin Parker.

 

Harry was so anxious while he sat outside the principal’s office, waiting for the principal to call Tony, that he felt like he was going to be sick.

Why had he started a screaming match in the middle of class? Why did he throw that first beanbag?

Harry bit his lower lip hard and bent at the waist, gripping his hair tightly and trying to keep from actually sicking up in the hallway.

“Harry, I’m so sorry.”

Harry ignored Peter. It wasn’t entirely Peter’s fault, Harry had been the one to throw the first beanbag. Sure, Peter was the one who threw a little bag hard enough to cut Harry’s forehead, Harry was the one who was stupid and impulsive and couldn’t just act right.

And since the only dad Peter had ever really known was dead, Harry was the one who was about to find out what Tony was going to do when Harry got him called for getting in a fight.

 

“You look like shit, kiddo.”

Harry looked up quickly enough to give himself vertigo and let out a heavy sigh of absolute relief to see Sirius strutting down the hallway with his hands in his jean pockets and a crooked smile on his face.

“Oh, thank God.”

Harry jumped up and rushed to Sirius, gripping him in a fierce and hard hug.

“Where’s Tony?” Harry asked after he let go of his godfather who had never looked so perfect before in Harry’s entire life.

“Working,” Sirius said breezily. “He said he got a call from your school and I offered to come pick you up. Is this the headmaster’s office?” he asked, nodding to the principal’s office.

“Yeah.” Harry glanced uneasily at Peter, who was looking away with a clenched jaw. “Don’t- don’t say anything stupid,” Harry warned Sirius in a whisper. “He’s the principal and if I get expelled then Tony’s going to be furious.”

“Me? Say something stupid?” Sirius laughed and ruffled Harry’s hair, ignoring Harry’s wince at the dull pain he’d had in his head all day. “You’ve got me mixed up with someone else, kiddo.”

 

“Muggles are a mystery, mate,” Sirius said while he guided Harry down the hallway to the exit after his quick conversation with the principal. “Oh, and you’re expelled for three days.”

“That’s perfect,” Harry sighed. “Just when Tony and I are getting along… Sirius, you brought the bloody Ducati?” Harry demanded when they got outside and he saw the flashy red motorcycle of Tony’s sitting in front of the school.

“Course I did,” Sirius laughed. He climbed on the bike, throwing his leg over it gracefully then patted the seat behind him. “I don’t know how to really drive Tony’s cars, I’m not being escorted around like some posh prat, and Tony said this baby’s all mine. Let’s go home, kiddo.”

Harry rolled his eyes and climbed on the bike behind Sirius, wrapping his arms around Sirius’ waist and gripping tightly. Sirius drove like a maniac and Harry wasn’t going to get another head injury before Tony even got a chance to kill him himself.

When the bike peeled off, Harry had a fleeting image of a man with a ball cap and a black jacket on, just standing against a lamppost.

Harry couldn’t see his eyes, but he got the peculiar feeling the bloke had been watching him.

 

“What are you doing?” Harry reached out and grabbed Sirius’ wrist quickly when they made it back to the tower and Sirius went to get off the lift at the wrong floor.

Sirius turned and looked at Harry with a confused pucker between his eyebrows. “Going home?”

“You’re- you’re not going up with me?” Harry asked.

Sirius gently removed Harry’s hand from his wrist and placed a soft touch to Harry’s shoulder. “Harry, the worst he’s going to do is ground you,” Sirius said, his tone earnest and honest. “He’s not going to hit you or scream, alright? And if he does, call me and I’ll come kick his arse.”

“Swear?” Harry asked. He had to swallow to make his voice not sound so choked. “Siri, you swear you’ll come up if I call you?”

“Always,” Sirius promised. “Your dad’s a good man, you’ll be fine.”

“You’re just saying that because you shagged him,” Harry said, working hard to detach himself from the anxiety and fear that was pooling in his stomach.

Sirius laughed and stepped off the lift and gave Harry a cocky salute. “A good man with an excellent arse. Good luck, kiddo.”

Harry swallowed hard and looked up at the top of the lift when the doors closed and Harry was moving up to the top floor he shared with Tony.

Tony having what Sirius dubbed an ‘excellent arse’ had nothing to do with him being pissed that Harry got in a fight and got suspended for three days from school.

“Jarvis?”

“Yes, Mister Harry?”

“What… what kind of mood is Tony in?”

Harry waited while his heart raced in his chest, knowing Jarvis would respond, he always did.

“Based on Mister Stark’s facial expressions and the vocal pitch he is using, I would say that he is mildly to moderately irritated and will likely want something with sugar in it for dinner.”

Harry couldn’t even smile at his and Jarvis’ system. Jarvis began tracking what foods people wanted for meals based on their moods during the day. If Tony was ‘mildly to moderately irritated’ then Harry really didn’t want to step off the lift.

Then the bell dinged and Harry squared his shoulders, reminded himself he used to be a Gryffindor, and resolutely went to Tony’s office to get it over with.

“Come in,” Tony called after Harry knocked on his door.

Harry took a very deep and very slow breath and then he stepped in Tony’s office and shut the door behind him with his back pressed against it.

“Wow, you look like hell.” Tony spun in his desk chair and whistled loudly. He did look irritated, he had lines across his forehead and the dark green tshirt he wore was wrinkled with oil stains all across the front. “I hope you beat the hell out of that kid, I never did like him.”

Harry barely caught himself before reminding Tony that he once blackmailed Harry to text Peter. Instead, Harry just stood there silently and watched as Tony tossed a green tennis ball in the air and caught it a few times.

“You wanna come sit or do you wanna just stand there and squint at me?” Tony asked after a minute. “I figure we should probably talk about this mess.”

Harry nodded and slowly moved in the room, sitting stiffly on the edge of his seat with his spine ramrod straight.

“So…” Tony tossed the ball in the air and caught it, a small blip in Harry’s radar. “What happened?”

Harry tucked his hands under his thighs to keep from twisting them around. “I don’t know, I’m sorry.”

Tony wasn’t even looking at Harry, he was watching his ball. “Principal Hardass said you and your geek got in a fight in the middle of gym?”

“Yes.”

“Why?” Tony asked, his nose crinkling up in either anger or confusion.

“I don’t know, I’m sorry,” Harry repeated automatically. He really didn’t know, he just…

“I just got mad,” Harry blurted. “I threw the beanbag and I started yelling and I’m sorry.”

Tony sighed and tossed his ball once more before setting it on his desk and fixing Harry with a look that Harry couldn’t begin to interpret.

“You good?”

“What?” Harry blinked. “I- I’m fine.”

“Your principal said you got hurt,” Tony said. “Move your hair so I can see your forehead.”

Harry did it on reflex, inching back when Tony frowned.

“God damn, what’s that kid eating?” Tony asked. “You’re going to have a goose egg tomorrow. Do you need Tylenol or something?”

“I’m fine,” Harry said. He dropped his hair and smoothed it down before tucking his hands back under his thighs. Harry stared at the desk, watching where Tony’s fingers were, and waited for Tony to start screaming or- or whatever he was going to do.

All Harry heard for almost two minutes was a clock ticking and the occasional vibration of Tony’s phone from his desk drawer.

“Uncle.”

Harry blinked and glanced up to meet Tony’s eyes. “Pardon?”

“Uncle,” Tony repeated. “It’s a universal sign for ‘I give’. I’ve got no idea why you look like we’re at a funeral or why you got in a fight with your friend today. So, uncle.”

“I don’t know why we got in a fight,” Harry said to Tony’s hands. He cleared his throat, embarrassingly feeling like he was going to cry. “I’m sorry.”

“Quit saying sorry!” Tony smacked his desk and Harry twitched back in his chair.

“Damn it, kid.” Tony sighed again and then dropped his head on the desk face down. “Damn it, Harry. Just- just go to your room or something.”

Harry jumped up at once and went straight to his room. He ignored his dog and his owl and stripped his clothes off, leaving them in the middle of the floor, and climbed in the shower after turning the water as hot as he could.

For someone he never planned to like from the start, Harry felt miserable that he and Tony were clearly fighting again.

 

“Harry? Can I come in?”

Harry was sitting at his desk, trying to make a start on the homework he’d been assigned and he called out a quiet agreement.

“Hey.” Tony opened Harry’s door wide open, letting Joey escape to the sitting room, and leaned against the door jam. “Whatcha doin’?”

“Spanish,” Harry told him.

“¿Cómo te va?”

Harry blinked dumbly at Tony and Tony grinned.

“Not so good then,” Tony quipped. He ran a hand through his hair and looked older than usual when he crossed his arms and rested his head on the doorway. “Look, I didn’t mean to snap at you, but you were just sitting there staring at me like I was going to hulk out and bash your face in. And it just- you just look so damn much like me, you know?

And now I’m babbling because I think you thought I was going to hit you and it pissed me off because you shouldn’t think that. Kids shouldn’t think that, alright? So… so I’m never going to hit you.”

Harry licked his lips and thought of the way that Tony never lied to him. Harry lied to Tony all the time, about stupid stuff, but Tony hadn’t lied to Harry as far as Harry knew.

Tony might have claimed ‘uncle’, but Tony wasn’t Harry’s uncle.

Tony was his dad.

“I’m nauseous,” Harry said quietly. He held his hand out and let Tony see how his fingers were shaking. “And I’ve got a tremble.”

“Those are pretty common side effects of the medicine you’re on,” Tony said. He stepped through the room slowly and reached out to lightly grasp Harry’s hand, studying it closely like he did the experiments he worked on in his lab. “If it’s still going on Monday, we’ll ask Strange about it, alright?”

“Alright,” Harry agreed quietly, feeling odd.

“And,” Tony dropped Harry’s hand and grinned at him, “you’re grounded. Not my idea, it was all Pepper, but you’re grounded all weekend.”

“What does being grounded mean, exactly?” Harry asked curiously. He’d heard of people being grounded, but Harry personally had never been grounded.

“No idea.” Tony laughed and messed his hair up again. “It’s been a shit day and I’m going to be gone this weekend. Want to go hit the Xbox? I can make the captions in Spanish so it totally counts as homework.”

Harry closed his textbook immediately and felt something heavy float off his shoulders when he followed Tony to the sitting room.

And Jarvis was right, Tony had wanted something sweet for dinner. They shared a pizza and a brookie while Tony refused to speak English for the rest of the night, claiming it was part of Harry’s punishment and education.

Chapter Text

“This is going to be fine.”

“Mm.”

“Seriously, Tony, this is going to be cake.”

“Mhmm.”

“Bloody hell, you’re a moody bastard, aren’t you?” Sirius leaned his chair backward and laughed. “No wonder Tony Junior’s throwing shit at his classmates.”

“What’s Harry doing?” Steve asked, folding his arms on the table they all shared in Bruce’s place and giving Tony a ‘very serious’ look.

“Nothing,” Tony said with a roll of his eyes. He didn’t need to discuss Harry and his mood swings and his Stark temper with the guys during a meeting. “I think this is going to go really damn badly,” he said, guiding the conversation back on track. “We weren’t prepared last time, what makes any of you think we are now?”

“We’re better prepared, now we know exactly what kind of crazy we’re dealing with,” Clint said.

“And we have more help,” Steve pointed out, looking from Witch-Bitch to Quick-Kid to Sirius. “I think if we all go, we’ve got a real shot at ending this before Ultron wipes out half the damn population.”

“Laaanguage,” Nat sang under her breath, smirking at Tony.

Tony couldn’t even appreciate the jab at Steve. He just stared at the map with his hands behind his head, his mind on Harry.

The last time they went after Ultron, they got their asses handed to them. Steve was confident that with the extra help, the extra ‘powers’, that it would be an in and out mission. And that was great, but Steve didn’t have a teenaged son sitting upstairs with his father and his godfather both headed on a mission with the potential to be dangerous.

Tony never used to worry about his mortality, then he went in a wormhole and barely came back. On his bad days, Tony felt like not all of him did come back.

Where would that leave Harry if something happened to Tony and Sirius both?

“Sirius should stay here,” Tony said casually, kicking his chair back to look breezy. “I don’t think all of us are going to be needed.”

“Tony, maybe being a daddy has scrambled your brains, but we didn’t come out the heroes last time,” Bruce said. “In fact I think the news is calling us the villains this time around.”

“Having Sirius and his abilities is sure to help us,” Steve said. “I think this is an all hands on deck situation, Tony.”

Tony sucked in a loud breath through his nose and twisted his lips to the side.

“No, it’s not,” he disagreed. Tony met each member’s eyes and bobbed his head. “This is not an all hands on deck situation. Sirius stays or I do, pick now.”

“I choose Sirius to go,” Pietro drawled. He raised a challenging and mocking brow when Sirius looked toward him. “What? We failed with Tony before, perhaps you are the lucky charm.”

“I think Tony needs to come,” Wanda said quietly, disagreeing with her twin. “He is the one who created Ultron, he is the one who may be able to finish him.”

“Team Tony,” Clint said, offering Tony a fist that went ignored. “We know Iron Man kicks ass, we don’t know what Sirius can do.”

“Everything,” Sirius scoffed with an easy grin.

“Then I think Sirius should go,” Nat said. “Technology doesn’t like magic, right? Well Ultron is a big pile of high class tech, let’s take some magic to finish him off.”

“I agree, the wizard should go,” Thor said. He stood behind Steve with his arms crossed and Mjölnir swinging from his grip. “We should take both—”

“No teenagers and Tony’s going to be a lot more use than Sirius, no offense,” Bruce said, nodding at Sirius cordially.

Tony looked at Steve and the two of them held each others gaze while the vote tied and knew that ultimately it was their decision.

The Avengers liked to pretend they were the ultimate democratic team of heroes, but just like the country they protected, the democracy was crap.

Tony and Steve led their team and it was Tony and Steve who needed to make a call so they could get their asses on the jet and leave.

“We all need to go, Tony,” Steve said, his blue eyes piercing. “You know that. I know you’re worried about Harry—”

“You don’t know jack or shit about what I’m worried about and don’t pretend you do,” Tony said harshly. “It’s all well and dandy if Sirius and I both go, but what happens to my son if we don’t both come back? Huh, Cap? What then?”

Tony slapped his hand on the table. “What the hell happens to my god damned kid if neither of us come back?!”

Steve wasn’t cowed, damn valiant hero, he just watched Tony snap and scream and sat in his chair like it was all something he expected.

“You tell me what happens to your kid, to thousands of kids, if you don’t both go,” Steve said evenly. “This isn’t just about your kid, this is about all the kids that are going to suffer if we don’t finish this thing, Tony. You know that, I know you know that.”

All the fight fled Tony when he knew Steve wasn’t just making some grand rallying speech. Steve believed what he said because Steve only knew how to be honest.

“Fine. Fine.” Tony scrubbed his face with his hands and shared a long look with Sirius. “Let me make a phone call and we’ll go save the world… again.”

 

Actually, Tony had to make two phone calls.

 

“Rhodey, I wouldn’t ask if I wasn’t hard up here.”

Tony looked at the only man he could really consider his best friend through the screen of his phone. The others were gearing up and loading up on the jet, hoping to finish off Ultron before Monday morning, but Tony had more important things to do.

“Was I your first choice?” Rhodey asked with a half-smile. “C’mon, be honest here, Tony, why me?”

“Because Harry likes you,” Tony said, ignoring the lawyer sitting beside him with the paperwork drawn up. “He’s comfortable around you.”

“He likes Pepper.”

“Just say no if you don’t want to do it,” Tony snapped. “I trust you, I trust you with my life and I trust you with my kid’s life. I thought you’d be thrilled, sorry for the inconvenience.”

“Oh, I am honored.” Rhodey chuckled and looked over to the strait-laced lawyer sitting beside Tony. “I’ll be there in two hours to sign in person. You think if Tony croaks before then that I can still have a brand new son?”

“Yes, sir, Mister War Machine,” the lawyer said, only stuttering a little bit. “I’ll have the paperwork ready for you, sir.”

“You were screwing with me,” Tony sighed. He pointed accusingly through the screen to his friend. “It’s not funny, Rhodes, not about this.”

“I wasn’t screwing with you, I was fishing for compliments,” Rhodey said with an unapologetic smile. “Good luck, man. I’ll rename Harry in your honor when you die.”

Tony rolled his eyes, “Goodbye, Rhodey. Don’t forget Harry’s grounded this weekend.”

“Oh yeah, Uncle Rhodey will absolutely enforce your punishment,” Rhodey grinned. “Seriously, kick ass, Tony. We will see you soon.”

“Yeah, see you.”

Tony disconnected with Rhodey and turned to the lawyer whose name he didn’t bother to learn. He snatched the pen and scribbled his name at the bottom, granting custody of Harry James Potter-Stark to James Rupert Rhodes in the event that he and Sirius Orion Black were both deceased.

It wasn’t until Tony signed his name to that document that he realized morality had green eyes and a little lightning bolt shaped scar.

 

“Don’t forget to brush your teeth.”

“I know.”

“Take your medicine.”

“Right.”

“Tell Strange about the side effects on Monday, okay? All of them, kid, don’t hold anything back.”

Harry looked up from where he’d been scratching his dog behind the ears and he narrowed his eyes at Tony.

“Will you not be back by Monday?” Harry asked.

Tony prevaricated, he didn’t need to force his fears on Harry. Hell, Tony didn’t like admitting that he even had fears.

“I’m not sure,” Tony said, forcing his voice to stay light. “If all goes well, we should be.”

“‘We’?” Harry repeated, the kid never missing a single slip-up. “Who all’s going?”

Tony sighed and rolled his neck. He didn’t look at Harry when he said it, he looked at the jet waiting for him just at the end of the flight pad.

“All of us,” he said flatly. “We all need to go if we want to finish Ultron and move on to the next big baddie. Rhodey will be here soon, you just have to keep from burning down the building for two hours, okay?”

Harry nodded; the kid wasn’t stupid, he’d seen fights and knew casualties happened. Harry knew, just like Tony knew, that things could go sideways and not all of them could return from Sokovia. Sure, maybe they’d take down Ultron once and for all, but they might not all come back.

And Harry knew that.

“If you or Sirius d- get hurt, I’m going to burn this building down with all your mates in it,” Harry said, looking up at Tony with his jaw clenched hard. “I know being a hero is your whole thing, but… but no wormholes.”

“No wormholes,” Tony agreed. He reached out for Harry and pulled him in for a hug, relieved when Harry’s arms wrapped around him for a couple of seconds.

“We’re all coming back and everything’s going to be fine,” Tony said gruffly, holding Harry’s head in his palm. “Alright?”

“Alright.”

Harry stepped back and Tony wondered how much bravery it took for him to let go of Tony when Tony finally understood that he didn’t want to.

“Love you, kid.”

“Love you, Dad.”

 

Yeah, damn it all, Tony was coming home to his son.

Chapter Text

“Welcome to Casa Rhodes,” Rhodey said, spreading his arms wide. “Make yourself at home, your bedroom’s through that door behind the couch. We’ve got a dinner at six.”

Harry was shivering, shaking, and he hadn’t felt so alive in days- weeks, maybe. After Tony left, Harry had resigned himself to laying in the sitting room and watching the news for any report on the Avengers until Tony’s team returned home, but then Rhodey arrived.

And not many things could distract Harry when he was worried that two of the most important people in the world to him were going to die, but Rhodey had done it with a single question.

“Think you can make a four hour flight on your broom?”

So, Harry packed a bag, asked Happy if he’d watch Joey and Hedwig and they left. With Harry beneath his cloak and on his broom, and Rhodey in his robot costume carrying Harry’s bag of clothes, medicine, and toiletries, the two of them flew from New York City to Washington DC where Rhodey lived.

It had been a cold flight, but it had passed by quickly while Harry and Rhodey caught each other up on recent events in their lives.

Harry told Rhodey about his medicine and Luna Park, Rhodey told Harry about a disastrous date with a woman he worked with at the White House. Harry told Rhodey he was suspended from school, Rhodey filled Harry in on a new project the President was working on to change school lunches.

In Harry’s opinion, school lunches seemed to be bloody daft thing for the President of the United States to be concerned about, but maybe he was just lucky with the cafeteria at Midtown.

 

Rhodey’s place was nice, cozy. It was a loft style flat, with Rhodey’s bedroom and bathroom making up the second floor, but the sitting room, kitchen, and guest suite were on the first floor.

Harry was grateful that despite the warm brown tones Rhodey’s place was decorated with, that there was a telly that covered an entire wall in the guest bedroom. It took Harry a few clicks with the unfamiliar remote until he found a news channel that he left on while he showered and changed.

Surely if the Avengers made any sort of spectacle that it would be all over the news.

While Harry showered, he heard weather reports, stock reports, and a story about a woman whose chihuahua saved her life, nothing about the Avengers.

“How long does it take to fly to Sokavia?” Harry asked Rhodey when he emerged from his room, his hair wet, dressed for dinner.

“Mm, they probably won’t be there until—” Rhodey cut himself off when he turned and looked at Harry. Harry looked over Rhodey’s dress shirt and black trousers and Rhodey looked over Harry’s jeans and long-sleeved shirt with the Avril Lavigne logo on the front.

Rhodey’s lips twitched while he kept staring at Harry until he was suddenly laughing hard, grabbing the back of his sofa to hold himself upright. Harry was scowling, unsure why Rhodey was laughing and not actually enjoying being laughed at.

“What’s so funny?” Harry demanded after Rhodey’s laughter died down but his eyes were still gleaming.

“Kid… kid…” Rhodey took a few deep breaths. “Kid, maybe I didn’t clarify, but it’s dinner with my boss.”

“Okay?” Harry asked slowly. He’d been to lunches at Stark Industries before and Harry always wore jeans. “I didn’t bring any posh suits, Rhodey.”

Rhodey bit his lip and looked up to the ceiling, looking like he was barely refraining from laughing his arse off again.

“You know what? Your last name explains everything,” Rhodey finally said. He smiled at Harry and grabbed a set of keys hanging from a hook. “You don’t have any knives or anything dangerous on you, do you?”

Harry gave Rhodey a bewildered look. “No? Where the hell are we going?”

 

The White House.

Rhodey was taking Harry to dinner at the White House.

 

“Rhodey… what’s your job?” Harry whispered to Rhodey when they finished at security and were walking through the fancy halls. Harry had a temporary ID pinned to his shirt and he felt like an idiot since everyone else was wearing suits. Even the security guard that ran a metal detector up and down Harry’s body had been wearing a full suit.

Harry glanced at his phone while they walked, at the news program Jarvis sent him an app for, and frowned when there still wasn’t any report on the Avengers.

“I’m head of the Department of Defense,” Rhodey said, guiding Harry through a left turn down another hall. “All those guys you met, Mike, Sam, and the others? They work for me.”

“And who do you work for?” Harry asked him, his stomach tightening with nerves and possible nausea.

Rhodey stopped at another security checkpoint, this one just as thorough as the last one, and didn’t answer Harry until they got through and stood outside a large white door.

“The Obama’s,” he said. He gave Harry a crooked smile that did nothing to ease Harry’s discomfort. “I hope you like seafood.”

Harry had never had seafood before, Tony was allergic to most types of seafood apparently, but since Harry never had dinner with the President of the United States either, it seemed to be a day for horrible new experiences.

 

“So, Harry! You’re a wizard?”

Harry choked on the ‘starter’ he’d tentatively taken a bite of, some sort of vegetable soup, and turned a dark red while Rhodey patted him on the back. When Harry could breathe properly and probably looked even stupider than he already had, Harry just blinked owlishly at the muggle President and had no idea what to say.

Sure, President Obama and his wife, Mrs Obama, had been perfectly pleasant and polite so far. They’d welcomed Harry and shook his hand and they all pretended like Harry wasn’t wearing a band shirt while they were all dressed up nice. They’d both made small talk with Rhodey while they sat down and waiters in crisp uniforms served starters and drinks and Harry thought he could slip through the dinner silently.

Then the President asked Harry something like that and Harry was struck silent.

“That’s what President Quahog told me,” President Obama said. He took a spoonful of his soup and then smiled warmly at Harry. “Was he wrong?”

“No… no, sir,” Harry said, desperately hoping it wasn’t some trap to trick him into breaking the law.

Mrs Obama smiled at Harry as if he’d given the correct answer. “That’s amazing,” she said enthusiastically. “We thought once that Malia was a muggleborn, but it comes to find out that Sasha was just hiding her stuffed cat from her.”

Harry relaxed some and politely asked about their daughters to move the subject from magic to their kids. In Harry’s very limited experience, parents could talk for hours about their kids. Unfortunately, President Obama did actually seem to be mates with Tony, as Tony had once said, and he started asking Harry about him.

“What’s your father up to, Harry?” President Obama asked when the waiters were clearing away the soups and bringing out the ‘entrees’.

“He’s going to Sokavia, sir,” Harry said. He looked distrustfully at the food in front of him and took a tentative sniff.

“Mussels in chilli curry and spring onion pancakes,” Rhodey whispered to Harry with a wink. He took a demonstrative bite of his, showing Harry how to eat it. “It’s good.”

Harry tried a bite and discovered that Rhodey wasn’t lying, it was good. It burned Harry’s tongue, probably the chili, but it taste okay anyway.

“What’s in Sokavia?” President Obama asked, looking toward Rhodey.

“It’s Mission Ultron,” Rhodey said. He dabbed his lips with the posh white linen napkin. “They’re hopeful with the new additions to the team that they can end it now.”

“Aah,” Mrs Obama nodded, apparently they already knew about it. “Yes, we’ll all rest easier when— Harry, are you alright?”

Harry was not alright, Harry couldn’t breathe because his throat was swelling up and his face was burning and—

“Oh, shit.” Rhodey jumped up and left Harry to scratch at his throat, trying to pull the shirt away because he couldn’t get any air, and Rhodey was leaving him there to die alone.

“Hold still,” Rhodey said, running back to Harry’s side. He had yellow and white tube in his hand and Harry was gasping for air while Rhodey bit the cap off and suddenly stabbed Harry in the leg.

“Easy now.” Rhodey grabbed Harry and guided him to the floor, holding him upright while Harry wondered about the irony from dying of food poisoning.

The Boy-Who-Lived, dead from poisoning by muggle President.

“I should have guessed that you’d be allergic to shellfish,” Rhodey said casually. He grabbed the collar of Harry’s shirt and ripped it, bringing cool air to Harry’s chest while Harry finally felt like his throat was open enough to get oxygen to his lungs.

Harry inched away when staff for the President started swarming him. There was a bloke in a lab coat that reached out for Harry.

“Fine,” Harry gasped, his moment of terror passing and utter humiliation settling in. “I’m fine.”

Rhodey stood up and offered Harry a hand, a hand that Harry ignored in favor of grabbing the chair to pull himself to shaking feet. When Harry looked down at himself, he saw his chest was bare and covered in blotchy red spots.

“Well, Barrack, Michelle, if you don’t mind, I think we’ll call it an evening,” Rhodey said. It was subtle, but Rhodey leaned closer to Harry and Harry leaned on him, just a bit.

“Of course.” Mrs Obama stepped around the large table and her hand fluttered when she reached out for Harry and Harry leaned further on Rhodey’s side, too embarrassed to even look at her.

“Malia is allergic to peanuts,” President Obama said, coming to stand beside his wife and smiling easily at Harry and Rhodey as if Harry didn’t just nearly die at his table.

“Once, we were at a dinner with foreign dignitaries, very formal, and she took a bite of braised duck that had been cooked with peanut oil. Poor girl swelled up like a balloon and we had to call an ambulance,” the President told Harry.

Harry knew he was trying to cheer Harry up, or something, but Harry just glared at his trainers.

“It was probably from the duck,” Harry muttered. “Eating duck is disgusting.”

There was a beat of silence—

Why could Harry never just shut the hell up?!

—and then Rhodey chuckled and the Obamas laughed and Harry decided that maybe he was a democrat.

 

“Does your dad know you’re allergic to shellfish?” Rhodey asked when they got back to his place and Harry’s chest was normal looking again.

“Am I?” Harry asked in surprise. “I thought they poisoned me.”

Rhodey laughed and went to the kitchen, getting them both a can of sofa.

“You thought the President of the United States poisoned Tony Stark’s son?” Rhodey asked, tossing Harry a can.

Harry shrugged, opening his drink and letting the cold bubbles soothe his still sore throat. “Loads of people probably want to poison me.”

“Tony does have plenty of enemies,” Rhodey agreed. He sat on the sofa beside Harry, kicked his feet on the table, and chuckled. “Your dad’s going to laugh his ass off when he finds out about this. The first time he met Barrack, back when Barrack was a senator, your dad was drunk off his ass and tried hitting on Michelle.”

“That sounds like Dad,” Harry said. He grabbed the remote from the table beside the sofa and flicked the news on, looking for anything on the Avengers.

“Dad, huh?” Rhodey asked. “Channel 10 usually has the quickest updates, but if they’re not making the news, it’s a good thing.”

Harry would have made a comment to avoid that whole ‘dad’ topic, but it turned out he didn’t need to.

“We’re here reporting live from Sokavia where it seems as if the Avengers - a team of superheroes - are tackling an enemy in the heart of the country! Evacuations have began and citizens are seized with terror as they wonder if their homes and their loved ones will be there by the end of the day.”

Harry’s breath caught in his throat, his lungs seizing more than they had when he’d apparently had an allergic reaction, when he saw what looked like thousands of robots shooting bombs in buildings and bullets in people.

“I thought they were going after one crazy robot bloke,” Harry said hoarsely. He scooted to the edge of his seat and gripped his knees tightly, looking for anyone familiar.

There- in the back, with his hair pulled up in a messy bun and—

“You swore not to be a hero,” Harry growled, his stomach sinking when the camera zoomed in on Sirius flying through the skies on a broomstick and Harry saw a grin on his face. Harry bit his lip to hold back a yelp when Sirius did a barrel roll, barely avoiding being hit by a bullet, and used his wand to save a building before it collapsed.

Sirius was only free in America; was he going to end up arrested for saving lives?

“Damn,” Rhodey whistled. “That’s a hell of an army Ultron built.”

It was.

Harry’s eyes were drawn to the people screaming, running down the street, being gunned down where they stood. There were blurs on screen, women and children being grabbed and ran to safety by someone that had to Pietro.

“He’s going to get shot,” Harry breathed, horrified. “They all are…”

When Harry saw a familiar red and gold suit shooting across the sky and the reporter began screaming about Iron Man entering the gunfire, the screen went blank and Harry actually yelled.

“Rhodey!” Harry turned to him and tried to snatch the remote from his hand. “Turn it back on!”

“This is exactly the sort of thing that a kid doesn’t need to see,” Rhodey said, holding the remote out of Harry’s reach. “It’s been a long day, why don’t you go do kid stuff? Brush your teeth, take your medicine, go to bed?”

Harry sighed and lowered his head. “Okay,” he said. He got up and moved around behind the sofa and then dived across it, snatching the remote, turning the telly back on, and landing neatly on the floor by Rhodey’s feet.

“Youngest seeker in a century,” Harry murmured smugly. “You’ll have to be—”

“We have reports that one of the Avengers has suffered from gunshot wounds while others enter the synagogue in an attempt to locate the source of the chaos!”

Harry was breathing quickly and he stuffed one fist in his mouth while his other hand searched blindly for his phone.

“Jarvis?” Harry said, his voice sounding wrong even to his own ears.

“Yes, Mister Harry?”

Harry’s eyes were glued to the telly, waiting for someone to appear to narrow down who got shot.

“Can- can you send a text? If I tell you what to say?” Harry asked Jarvis. Rhodey’s large hand gripped Harry’s shoulder for a moment and then slid down his arm, grabbing his phone from him.

“I’ll do it,” Rhodey offered. “Who am I texting and what am I saying?”

Harry saw a woman sobbing, holding a baby to her chest, and Harry thought of his mum.

“NOT HARRY! PLEASE!”

And when the bomb went off and a brick slammed in the woman’s head and she fell on top of her baby, both of them teetering on the edge of a dock before falling in the water, Harry felt like he’d been the one submerged in the ice cold depths.

“Tony and Sirius, tell them I love them and don’t die,” Harry whispered. He couldn’t find it in him to find any snark or sarcasm, no jokes to be had. Not when people were dying and Harry hadn’t seen any of the Avengers on screen since the reporter said someone had been shot.

“Done,” Rhodey said. He grabbed Harry’s shoulder again, not too tightly, just tight enough that Harry knew he was there. “I’m going to grab you a sandwich, your pill, and you’re going to take them or I’m turning off the power breaker and we’re living in the dark ages until your dad gets back safe and sound, understand?”

“Sir, yes, sir,” Harry murmured, completely distracted by the telly. There were arrows flying as quickly as bullets then and Harry could see Clint leaping nimbly from car to car, shooting arrows one after another at the robots terrorizing the city.

By the time Rhodey came back, pressing a pill in Harry’s hand and tapping him irritatingly on the top of his head until Harry swallowed it quickly, Harry had seen Psycho too.

“There’s too many of them… who’s missing?” Harry mumbled to himself. “Clint, Psycho…”

“Psycho?” Rhodey asked, making a choked laugh when he saw Natasha flit across the screen with kids clinging to her. “Ah, fitting. That is one woman I wouldn’t want to cross.”

Harry’s phone rang then and Harry jumped to see who was calling him, only to see it was the actual only woman who Harry was afraid to cross.

“Harry? Are you there?” Pepper asked with too much forced cheer to sound natural. Harry hummed so she knew he could hear her. “Where are you? I’m coming to the tower. Why don’t we go out tonight? Catch a movie? Go shopping? Oh! Do you want to buy a car? Let’s go buy a car!”

“I’m already watching the news,” Harry said flatly.

Pepper swore loudly, creatively even, and Harry couldn’t even crack a grin because he saw Bruce in all his Hulk glory, grabbing boats and putting them in the ocean so Psycho could put people in them for their own safety.

“You’re home?” Pepper asked.

“Rhodey’s,” Harry told her.

“Got it. Harry, try not to panic, okay? Everything’s going to be fine.”

“Someone got shot.”

“I know,” Pepper sighed. “I’m going to call Rhodey, alright? Just… stay calm. I love you.”

Harry suddenly realized that he never told his parents - James and Lily Potter - that he loved them before they died. He couldn’t have, he was only a baby. And… and it seemed like people around Harry were constantly dying young.

“I love you too,” Harry said a bit desperately.

Then he hung up on her so Harry could watch the telly and look for his dad, Sirius, Pietro, Wanda, Thor, or Steve.

“WHY CANT THEY GET MORE THAN TWO FUCKING CAMERAS?” Harry screamed at the telly when the news channel kept switching from two views. One was of the white building that was glowing through the windows that they said the Avengers were inside and one on the streets that kept moving around, showing the deaths and the attacks.

Harry’s phone rang again when lightning began to fly down from the sky to the white building. Harry’s hope that it was his dad or Sirius was crushed again when he saw Gwen’s name and her silly smile on the screen.

“Harry! Hi! Listen, my parents said I can have a friend over and I was thinking you come and we swim and work on homework and—”

“I’m watching the news with Rhodey,” Harry interrupted Gwen’s peppy invite. “I met the President of the United States, I’m allergic to shellfish, and someone’s been shot and I don’t know who.”

“Okay… call me later, love you.”

“I love you.”

Harry clutched his phone tightly when the ground on the telly began shaking and the reported was screaming about an earthquake. Clint and Psycho were shooting down robots while they evacuated crying people, but there were too many people and not enough boats.

Even Harry could do the math.

“That’s Sirius, right?” Rhodey asked when the camera panned to the white building where the lightning had been striking and a red light glowed from the windows.

“Could be Wanda,” Harry muttered. He accepted the sandwich Rhodey forced on him absently and chewed a large enough bite to satisfy him so he didn’t mess with the telly again.

“THERE! That’s Pietro!” Harry yelled, finally seeing a silver blur race across the screen just in time to save a little bit from getting shot.

Harry’s shoulders relaxed some; even if Pietro had pushed Harry out a window, he was also a laugh when he wanted to be and liked to walk Joey with Harry after school.

“Damn it, hang on, kid.” Rhodey let go of Harry and walked off when his phone was the one that rang. Harry didn’t want to listen to Rhodey’s conversation, he wanted to listen to the reports happening rapidly on the screen, but Rhodey was loud.

“What? No! Sir, they can’t. Tell them to stand down. Tony will contain the scene.”

“Civilian evacuations are happening at the south and east borders, but thousands are trapped inside their homes on the west side!”

“I understand the risk of contamination, but there are more than just the army there, sir, there is also a team of guys trying to stop them.”

“WITH THE INCREASE IN TREMORS BENEATH THE SURFACE, VIDEO FOOTAGE IS BECOMING HARDER TO MAINTAIN!”

“IF THEY OBLITERATE AN ENTIRE COUNTRY THEY WILL BE TAKING OUT THE ONLY PEOPLE CAPABLE OF STOPPING THIS!”

Bullets flew across the screen and Clint leaped to save the kid and—

The feed switched to a blurred and shaking view of the white building.

“I AM NOT LEAVING!” Harry snapped the next time his phone rang and it wasn’t anyone he wanted to hear from. “JUST LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE!”

“Harry, I—”

The camera feed on the telly went black and Harry screamed and threw his phone at it hard enough to shatter his phone screen and the telly screen.

“Kid, hey!” Rhodey shouted at Harry and Harry turned around with his hands on his head, pulling hard at his hair.

“Go outside and run the block,” Rhodey said, tilting his phone away from his mouth while he stared hard at Harry. “Run it hard, okay? Then come back. If you’re not back in ten minutes, I’ll hunt you down.”

Harry recognized that for the escape that it was and he was outside pounding the pavement as hard as he could and convinced himself the burn in his throat was from running and not his complete lack of control in anything.

There were robots trying to kill the only family Harry had. Clint was probably dead. Tony was probably dead. Sirius was probably dead. The camera feeds weren’t working and Harry couldn’t call anyone because he threw his phone just like he threw the beanbags and everything was falling apart.

“Need to keep going?” Rhodey asked when Harry poked his head inside the door and saw that Rhodey was still on his phone. Harry had ran the block twice and he needed to keep running or else he was going to start screaming. Harry nodded and Rhodey looked at his wristwatch.

“Ten minutes, poke back in here,” Rhodey said.

Harry ran again and he kept running until he was drenched with sweat and bent over in Rhodey’s backyard, heaving and puking on the grass. When Harry lifted his head, staring bleakly in the sparse trees that lined the back of Rhodey’s yard, Harry finally saw something he could control.

“Hey!” Harry’s throat felt like he’d ripped it down the front, but Harry screamed again. “HEY!”

There was a shadow that tried to hide behind the trees but Harry was on it before the bloke with the ball cap could disappear.

Harry didn’t have a wand or a weapon, but he had absolute out of control rage and fear and he slammed the bloke against the tree before he could even think it through.

“Who the hell are you?” Harry demanded, straining to lean up and glare in the mysterious blokes face. “Death eater? Spy? Who are you?”

The bloke reached up and pulled his cap off his head, lightly shoving Harry away from him as he did.

“Hey,” Bucky said. “What’s a death eater?”

 

“You done shagging my godfather?” Harry yelled at Bucky when he ran from the tower. Harry didn’t have a real reason to be so bitter, but he thought Sirius deserved something better than one night with a fit bloke from a bar.

Bucky turned around and Harry stood from the steps he’d been sitting on when he saw the wild look in his eyes.

“Hey, you okay?” Harry asked, stepping slowly toward him.

“Stay away,” Bucky stammered, holding his hands up. “D-don’t come any closer.”

“Why?” Harry asked. If everyone said Harry had a brain deficit, why not walk right up to the bloke who looked read to kill him. “I’m not scared,” Harry said, his voice steady.

“Stop,” Bucky warned him. Harry stepped closer, brought in by the danger. “I said stop!” Bucky yelled, reaching out and pushing Harry hard on the chest, knocking him flat on his back on the pavement.

“Don’t fucking touch me, you piece of shit,” Harry snapped, scrambling backward on the stairs when Bucky stepped toward him. “You want to run off, leave Sirius alone? JUST GO! HE DOESN’T NEED YOU!”

Bucky shook his head and then there was a sound behind Harry, the inner door of the tower entrance opening, and Bucky fled.

 

“Are you following me?” Harry demanded. “Why?”

“I- I…”

“‘I- I- I…’” Harry mocked Bucky, misplacing all his anger and shaky instability on this mad bloke who had taken up stalking Harry. “SPIT IT OUT!”

“I was making sure you were safe!” Bucky yelled. “You’re- you’re a kid! Why are you living in that place? Do you even know who those people are?”

“Harry? Kid?”

Harry leaned around the tree and saw Rhodey poking his head out the back door.

“Don’t fucking move,” Harry hissed at Bucky. “This creepy conversation is not over!”

 

Except by the time Harry went to assure Rhodey he was fine, he was still running, Bucky had disappeared and Harry slammed his fist in the tree where Bucky had previously been standing in front of.

 

“I am the worst uncle ever,” Rhodey said, forcing Harry to sit on the sofa when Harry went back inside. Rhodey grabbed Harry’s right hand and Harry hissed through his teeth.

“Broken,” Rhodey declared. “Kid, you have to rest and relax, alright? I’m in touch with the National Guard personnel that are headed over there now and as soon as we get an update, I’ll let you know.”

Harry laid his head against the back of the sofa and closed his eyes when it felt like everything was spinning around him.

“What do we do now?” Harry asked Rhodey when Rhodey sat beside Harry a few minutes later and placed an ice pack on Harry’s broken knuckles.

Rhodey sighed and put his arm around Harry’s shoulders, letting Harry rest his spinning and aching head on his shoulders.

“Now we wait.”

Chapter Text

Tony stepped off the elevator, sore, bloody, and not feeling much like a winner.

“Oh thank God!”

Before Tony could even make it past the entrance room of his place, he was attacked by a small and hard body that slammed in him with enough force to knock Tony in the wall.

Tony looked down and saw Harry’s hair - Harry’s really greasy and tangled hair - while his son clung to him like he thought Tony wouldn’t have returned. In the living room, he saw Pepper and Rhodey with stricken expressions.

Pepper bit her lip, Rhodey raised his brows, and Tony shook his head.

They won, but they lost too.

“You’re fine?” Harry pulled back and looked at Tony carefully. His eyes, so filled with joy, dimmed some when he saw the drawn expression on Tony’s face.

“Who…?”

“Come on,” Tony said, wrapping his arm around Harry’s shoulders and turning him back toward the elevators. “The others- they’re in Bruce’s lab.”

“It’s Sirius,” Harry said flatly, his entire body shrinking in Tony’s side. “Right?”

Tony inhaled and his breath was shaky on the exhale. “Right.”

It was Sirius and it was Wanda and it was Pietro.

And it was Tony’s kid with the shaking shoulders preparing himself for the worst.

“Tony—”

“We’ll be back and I’ll fill you in,” Tony told Rhodey wearily over his shoulder.

God, it was like the weekend that had never ended. Tony couldn’t even remember the last time he slept and at the rate things were going, he wouldn’t be able to sleep anytime soon.

 

“Is he dead?” Harry asked dully while they rode down to Bruce’s floor.

“No,” Tony said. He couldn’t lie to him though. “But if we don’t get someone to fix him quick, he will be.”

Harry’s head snapped up and Tony saw a spark in them. “A doctor or a wizard?”

“Wizard, preferably,” Tony said. He ran his free hand through his hair, pulling on it while he tried to think. “I called Strange on the flight, but he said he doesn’t do that kind of magic and I couldn’t get ahold of Quahog. I could try—”

“Shut the hell up,” Harry snapped. “Give me your phone, quick. HURRY!”

Tony grabbed his phone and gave it to him, unwilling to fight with the kid whose godfather was dying on a bed because Tony wasn’t quick enough to save him.

Harry worked quickly with a single-minded focus, unlocking Tony’s phone and pulling up the contact list.

“You snoop on me all the time and you didn’t save Hermione’s number?” Harry muttered, scrolling through the hundreds of contacts Tony had.

Tony coughed quietly. “Bushy Haired Girl.”

Any other time that would have earned Tony a snarky comment or a quiet snicker, but it didn’t get a reaction at all aside from Harry scrolling from the H’s to the B’s.

“Pick up, pick up,” Harry murmured when they stepped off the elevator and Tony led him toward the makeshift hospital they had in Bruce’s lab.

“Pick up, pick— Hermione! Listen, quick, you have to send someone,” Harry said, talking frantically while he skid to a stop outside the door and the blood drained from his face.

“It’s- it’s Sirius, okay? He’s hurt and… and he might be dying,” Harry said, his voice quivering. Tony grasped his shoulder tightly, guilt eating him alive.

He should have done more, been better, been faster.

He wanted to protect the world for his kid and in his unforgivable arrogance, his kid was going to lose the world if Sirius died.

And Tony had a team of doctors in that room - the best damn surgeons he could get to beat the team on arrival - but medicine could only do so much.

“I don’t care if it’s fucking Snape, Hermione!” Harry screamed shrilly. “Go, run! Find someone, anyone, and send them to Stark Tower with potions and shit. RUN!”

Tony waited silently when Harry hung up on his friend and he trembled under Tony’s hold.

“Hermione’s going to send someone,” Harry said like a prayer. “She’s going to send someone.”

“JARVIS, if anyone shows up, send them here,” Tony said. He got confirmation from JARVIS and then waited for Harry to stop shaking with silent sobs to give him a little nudge.

“You ready?” Tony asked Harry gently, nodding his head to the lab door.

“No.”

“Okay, let’s wait,” Tony said. He pulled Harry to his side and held him close. “Your hair stinks,” Tony murmured after burying his nose in Harry’s sweaty and greasy hair.

“Sirius was the one who got shot?” Harry asked quietly. “Is anyone- anyone else… is anyone else hurt?”

“Pietro’s in bad shape, he took a bullet to protect Clint, and… Sirius, he… he was flying and he got hit by a spray of bullets from behind.”

Tony was so selfishly glad that he hadn’t seen it, hadn’t had to watch Sirius fall from the sky and spray the ground in blood. Nat had caught him, took him straight to the jet, and her choice to try and keep Sirius alive took her out of the play.

“Wanda’s gone,” Tony said bluntly, trying to push through the guilt. He hadn’t liked Wanda, he didn’t trust her, and when she went running for Pietro- Tony let her go.

Tony let her go.

Tony took his team on a fucking suicide mission and…

And Wanda was twenty-one.

Pietro was twenty-one.

Sirius was thirty-five and just got a life back.

And Tony led them all to their death because he hadn’t been good enough, fast enough, once again.

“I’m ready.”

Tony looked over at Harry and measured him up. Harry’s eyes were worryingly dry and he was pale, too pale, but he had Tony’s stubborn set to his jaw and a well of misery lurking in the back of his eyes, just waiting to swallow the kid whole.

“No shame in waiting until magical backup arrives,” Tony said.

Harry rolled his neck and shook off Tony’s arm. “Yeah, there is.”

 

As much of a fuckup as Tony was, he’d clearly given good genes to Harry because Tony wouldn’t have been able to walk through that door like Harry did.

 

Pietro was back on his feet, standing beside Wanda’s body on one side of the room, looking like a lost little boy when he stared down at his sister.

Clint stood beside him, his hand on Pietro’s back, staying steady and solemn while Pietro looked ready to collapse.

Nat, Bruce, and Steve were clustered in the back, speaking quietly with the surgeons that weren’t even touching the bullet ridden body on the other bed in the room.

Harry gravitated to that body, shivering every step, but still soldiering on.

“Tony, he can’t—”

“My kid, my rules,” Tony told Steve, holding his hand up when Steve moved toward Harry. “Back up, Steve, I’m not fighting you.”

Because Tony was so exhausted, exhausted clear to his soul, that he’d just as soon shove Steve out the window and not wait around to see if he stuck the landing.

Harry pulled the sheet off Sirius, exposing his destroyed torso and the wires and tubes hooked up to him, and the kid hit his knees and let out a keening high-pitched cry that Tony would never forget.

Tony stood there just as they all did and watched while Harry cried and the monitors beeped on, showing Sirius’ poor prognosis.

It was the single most heartbreaking thing Tony had ever seen.

“I was so jealous,” Tony breathed to himself, watching as his son’s heart was ripped in half. “I was jealous that Harry loved him.”

Tony thought the more Harry loved Sirius the less love he’d have for Tony because that was how everything worked in Tony’s world.

Everything had a number, a measurable unit.

And Tony had wanted to take Harry’s units of love away from Sirius for himself. If Sirius died though, Harry’s units of love would just be gone. They’d be gone with Sirius, never to return.

“Mister Stark, Albus Dumbledore and Remus Lupin are here.”

“You called the wizard?” Clint demanded loudly. “Tony, we can’t trust—”

“Send him here, quick,” Tony said, ignoring Clint’s protests. Gandalf could bring the pink witch herself if it meant they could save Sirius. Tony went to grab Harry, move him away. “Harry, kid, come on. It’s time to move, let Gandalf do some voodoo.”

“I can’t leave him,” Harry sobbed, clenching hard to Sirius’ limp arm. “Siri- Siri, please, please.”

The door opened and Tony couldn’t even look to see Dumbledore stride through the room with the a grim-faced Remus following his steps.

“Harry, come on,” Remus tried to grab Harry and Tony shouldered him away.

“Don’t touch my son, I’ll get him.” Tony grabbed Harry around the chest and began pulling him away while Harry screamed and reached out for Sirius. “Fucking fix him, do you understand? Fix him.”

“I’ll carry him,” Steve said, rushing to Tony’s side when Harry was fighting him tooth and nail to get back to Sirius. Steve bent down and picked up the thrashing and sobbing teenager like it was nothing and looked gravely at Tony. “We could sedate him until it’s over.”

Tony looked at the horrible pain his kid was in, the way Harry didn’t even look like he was with them then, his eyes locked on Sirius and his head who knew where.

“SIRIUS! PADFOOT, PLEASE!”

“Do it,” Tony said, his chest aching in tangent to Harry’s screams.

Bruce jumped forward immediately, a syringe ready to go that he stuck in Harry’s shoulder without hesitation. It took half a minute for Harry to begin calming down, his shouts becoming hoarse whispers for Sirius, and Harry then looked for Tony and reached out to him.

“Don’t let him die,” Harry said when Tony grasped his hand. Harry was focused solely on Tony. “Don’t let him die, Dad, please.”

“I won’t,” Tony said. He looked at Steve when Harry’s lashes began fluttering. “Go lay him on a bed,” he ordered him.

Tony prayed to every god he could think of, the ones he didn’t even believe in, that he hadn’t just lied to his son.

 

“What happened?” Remus asked when Tony moved to watch Gandalf as he worked feverishly on Sirius. The wires and IV cords and the intubation tube disappeared with a wave of Gandalf’s wand and the blood was gone with another flick, leaving Sirius’ torso to show the extent of the damage from what Tony could quickly count was eleven exit wounds from bullets.

God, he looked like Swiss cheese.

“Black took a back of bullets and then fell eighty-five feet from the air, landing on a car and splitting his skull,” Nat said, answering for Tony when he was incapable of doing it.

She, graciously, left out how it was entirely Tony’s fault.

“Dittany, Remus,” Albus said calmly, continuing to wave his wand around in an elegant twirl. Remus pulled a large glass bottle of a thick amber liquid from his cardigan pocket and handed it quickly to Albus.

“What’s that do?” Bruce asked, drifting closer to watch with calculating eyes.

“It is a powerful curative potion that assists in healing,” Albus said as he liberally poured it across Sirius’ chest and used his wand to spread the liquid around without touching him. They all watched as Sirius’ skin began regenerating, stretching and struggling to repair itself.

“Is he in pain?” Bruce asked. His forehead was creased and Tony knew he was thinking of the people he hadn’t saved, the ones that the Hulk might have actually injured.

God knew that Tony wasn’t going to forget the bodies that littered the ground when they left. Men, women, children, infants… they all just woke up one day and had to deal with the consequences of Tony’s brilliance.

“Excruciating, I would say,” Albus murmured. “We like to believe we are so different and yet we all design weapons meant to maim and injure and kill our fellow man.”

Nat raised her eyes where she stood on the other side of Sirius’ bed and tilted her head to the side. ‘Is he serious?’ she mouthed to Tony.

Gandalf could stand there and act as wise and brilliant as he wanted to be and Tony would let him as long as he worked on Sirius.

Tony looked around for Harry and saw Steve had him laying on a bed while he had a protective hand on Harry’s sleeping shoulder.

Pietro still stared at Wanda and Tony looked away before he had to see that flaming red hair haloing around a cold and lifeless face.

“So you’re healing the skin and the organs or are you just covering the organ damage with skin?” Bruce pressed. “Because Doctor Chow was worried about the kidney damage…”

Albus looked up and have Bruce a patient and condescending smile. “I do not doubt that your healers have done as much as they can, I’m fortunate to have magic that follows different laws.”

“I don’t understand…” Remus turned to Tony and Tony saw a lifetime of grief in his eyes. “Who shot Sirius? Where was he flying? Why is he even here?”

“You two don’t keep in touch?” Tony asked, surprised. He kept a watch on Albus from the corner of his eye, his mind only partially on his conversation with Remus.

“I haven’t heard from him in weeks,” Remus said. “I assumed, hoped, he was here with Harry. But then Albus tells me that Hermione Granger told him Sirius was hurt- was dying? So I’m asking you, Tony, what the hell is going on here?”

“It’s my fault,” Tony said tightly, speaking to Remus and watching Sirius. “We got his name cleared here. He was free.”

“And that somehow got him shot?!” Remus snarled.

“Back off,” Nat said, at Tony’s side in an instant. “Black joined us on a mission, he was fucking around and he got shot. That’s the risks.”

“Remus, assist me, please,” Albus called calmly from Sirius’ bedside. “Do you have the blood-replenisher?”

“Yes, yes, sorry,” Remus said, frazzled when he turned around. He dug another bottle from his pocket, a dark red one, and unstoppered it. “Shall I spell it in him?”

“Quickly, yes,” Albus murmured. “Mister Stark, how is your son?”

Tony turned and looked to see that Harry was still sleeping off the sedative, dark bags under his eyes evident from across the room.

“Not so great right now,” Tony said, none of his usual vigor in his tone.

“Can you wake him?”

“Let him sleep,” Steve called to them. He still had his hand on Harry’s shoulder and Tony could only be grateful in that moment. Tony couldn’t touch his son until he knew he hadn’t gotten Sirius killed.

“He’ll want to know that Sirius will make a full recovery,” Albus said, straightening up and pulling a blanket from thin air to cover Sirius’ body with. He smiled at Tony, as if Tony had done anything recently to earn a smile. “I’m glad that Miss Granger was able to get the message, I’m not sure that Sirius would have survived without magical intervention.”

“He’s- he’s fine?” Tony took a quick step toward Sirius and staggered before Nat grabbed his elbow and kept him from falling on his face.

Sirius’ face had some color again, he could have been sleeping when Tony looked at him wondrously.

“We’ve given him a Dreamless Sleep to ensure his body has adequate rest to recuperate, but when he wakes, he should be fine,” Albus said. He patted Tony kindly on the shoulder for an instant. “Sirius is a strong man and he loves your son, I’m glad you were able to do for him what I was unable to.”

“Get him shot?” Tony scoffed. “I’m sure you could have if you tried a little harder.” He reached out and gently touched the side of Sirius’ neck; it was as if a thousand pounds of steel lifted off Tony’s shoulders when he felt Sirius’ carotid artery beating steady beneath his finger.

“You really cleared his name?” Remus asked, crowding Tony on his other side. His eyes sharpened when he saw the liberties Tony took with touching Sirius’ face, but Tony couldn’t worry about his petty jealousy when Tony needed Sirius to live so Harry didn’t die.

“Apparently President Quahog is moderately more intelligent than your Prime Minister. This is the land of the free,” Tony said. “Albus, I… I can’t thank you enough.”

“It is of no consequence, Mister Stark,” Albus assured him. “I should thank you, truly. I’ve been recently exposed to a delightful read that Mister Creevey gave me to educate me on what ‘Gandalf’ was meant to mean.”

Albus smiled at Tony with a twinkle in his blue eyes and Tony just sighed and offered him a tired hand.

“For a meddling old man who clearly doesn’t run background checks at his school, you’re not the worst person I’ve ever met,” Tony said, a truce and an apology in one.

“I hope we can meet soon and discuss our mutual problem,” Albus said amicably as he shook Tony’s hand. “If it is acceptable to you, I do need to return to the school. Remus is quite willing to stay until Sirius wakes to ensure there are no lingering pains.”

“Yeah, of course, thank you,” Tony said again. His eyes flicked to where Harry was and there was something so horribly vulnerable the way Harry slept curled up on his side, his face slack with tear streaks down his cheeks.

“Seriously,” Tony looked Albus dead in the eyes, “thank you. Harry- he… we…”

“I understand,” Albus smiled. “I’m pleased that Sirius has a family once again.”

“A family that got him shot,” Remus muttered under his breath when he pulled a folding chair up to sit by the head of Sirius’ bed.

“That’s pretty par for the course around here,” Bruce said with a quiet and relieved chuckle.

“Wait! Do not leave!” Pietro blocked the door with his entire body, staring at Albus like a man staring at his last lifeline. “My- my sister, please, can you help her?”

At once, the relief Tony felt changed to crushing guilt. Everyone looked at Pietro, hearing the desperation in his voice and the wild look in his eyes.

Tony did that.

Tony broke that kid by killing his sister.

Albus went to stand beside where Wanda laid with her hands folded on her chest and he touched the crown of her head softly.

“Dear boy, I’m sorry.” Albus looked to Pietro with genuine remorse pooling in his eyes. “There is no spell in the world that can bring back the dead.”

“Try,” Pietro insisted, still blocking the door. “Get your magic wand out and try.”

“She’s gone,” Albus said gently. “I am sorry for your loss.”

“GET YOUR WAND OUT AND TRY!” Pietro’s voice broke and everyone felt it echo in their own chests. “You haven’t even tried! TRY!”

“I have to go update Rhodey,” Tony said to no one in particular. He was suffocating in that room that was so filled with Pietro’s grief there wasn’t space for oxygen.

Pietro stepped aside for Tony and Tony fled the room like the coward that he was.

 

“You did the best you could, Tony,” Rhodey said after Tony finished filling him in back in his office. Rhodey poured Tony a drink and Tony shook his head, waving it away.

“The best I could do got someone killed, Rhodes. It could have been three people. Hell, I could have gotten them all killed!”

“But you didn’t,” Rhodey insisted. “It’s terrible what happened to Wanda, but it wasn’t on you, Tony.”

“Yeah?” Tony grabbed a mug off his bookcase, a stupid mug someone gave him once that said ‘World’s Best Boss’ and he turned at threw it at the door, shattering it.

“It feels like it,” Tony said in a harsh tone. “It damn well feels like I got that girl killed today. Hundreds of people killed.”

“And you saved thousands- no, millions of lives,” Rhodey told him calmly, sipping Tony’s stolen scotch. “You’re a hero, Tony, and it sucks.” Rhodey lifted his glass to Tony in a mocking toast. “Congrats.”

“I’m going to quit,” Tony said. “I’m quitting. I’m retiring the suit and calling it quits.”

“You do that.”

“I will,” Tony said determinedly. “As soon as I find Darth Vader and Harry’s safe and—”

“And until the next big bad thing shows up,” Rhodey said. “Then it’ll just be ‘one more thing’ until the next one dead from a mission is you, and I don’t think Harry can handle it.”

“What?” Tony scrunched his face up and focused on Rhodey. “What happened this weekend?”

Rhodey chuckled and held his hand up, ticking things off his fingers as he went. “Your kid’s allergic to shellfish, we found that out at dinner with the Obamas where he wore a trashy band shirt too.”

Tony grinned for the first time in days and went ahead and snatched Rhodey’s glass, taking a sip.

“Then he stole the remote from me like a little ninja shithead and refused to stop watching the news the instant they began reporting on you guys.”

Tony took a larger drink, closing his eyes in more guilt.

“Let’s see… oh, he threw his phone at my TV when the footage was cut off, you owe me an 80” plasma.”

Which explained why Harry didn’t have his own phone to call his friend.

“Then he started running until he made himself sick, he punched a tree and broke his knuckles—”

“Damn it, Rhodey, why didn’t you tell me his knuckles were broken?” Tony scowled. “JARVIS, tell Mopey McGhee to fix Harry’s knuckles.”

“Would that be Remus Lupin, sir?” JARVIS asked smoothly.

“Obviously,” Tony drawled with a roll of his eyes. “Rhodey, what else?”

“Then when I fell asleep your dumbass kid decided he was going to fly his broomstick to Sokavia to help you and set off my security system.”

Tony finished off the scotch and scrubbed his face with both hands. “Of course he did,” he mumbled. “Of course.”

“Then we came here and the kid sat like a statue until you came home. He wouldn’t eat, wouldn’t sleep, wouldn’t shower… the best we got was him taking his medicine and that’s only because Pepper guilt tripped the hell out of him.”

“He’s half in love with her and half terrified,” Tony said. He yawned and slapped his cheeks lightly, trying to wake up some. “I should—”

“You should go get some rest.” Rhodey put a hand on Tony’s shoulder and gave him one of his little ‘I’m not just your buddy I’m also your only friend’ smiles. “You did good, Tony. You did your best. Go grab a cot by your kid so you’re with him when he wakes up.”

“Who said you were just a pretty face?” Tony asked Rhodey with a forced grin. “Thank you for keeping him alive.”

“He didn’t make it easy on me,” Rhodey laughed. “It was mussels, Tony, he started swelling up in the middle of dinner and then thought Barrack had tried to poison him.”

 

Tony shook his head and chuckled to himself on his way back up to their makeshift hospital.

It was both terrifying and adorable that Harry tried to ride a broomstick to come help his old man in a fight.

But that was exactly why Tony couldn’t keep fighting.

Chapter Text

“I hate to say it, but I think I owe Gandalf a fruit basket or something. If Sirius died, Harry- well… I don’t think I could have kept Harry off any ledges.”

Harry kept his eyes closed while he processed where he was and who was talking…

Tony returned from the mission and…

Harry’s blood froze with fear and his chest burst with a sharp pain.

Tony returned from the mission and Sirius was dying. Harry called Hermione and she sent Dumbledore and Lupin.

Then the words he just heard, the ones that had to come from Tony, clicked in his head.

Sirius was alive.

Dumbledore saved him.

Sirius was alive.

Forget a fruit basket, Harry was going to give Dumbledore all the galleons in his vault.

“I think Sirius was the first adult to truly care for Harry in Harry’s memory, they’ve always been close.”

Harry scrunched his nose when he realized that the person Tony was talking with was Lupin.

“Why weren’t you?”

Good question, Dad, Harry thought in puzzled agreement. He’d never thought about it much before, but Lupin was one of the marauders, best mates with his dad, and Harry never got so much as a Christmas card from him.

“I get that Sirius was in prison or whatever, which is absolute bullshit by the way, but I remember you and James being pretty good friends. And Lily never shut up about you.”

“Lily never shut up in general,” Lupin said, sounding uncomfortable.

“I live with Harry, Remus, I can play question evaders all night,” Tony scoffed. “What? Did you and James have some big fight before he died? Some reason you didn’t try and get his son?”

“I’m a werewolf,” Lupin said bluntly. “I’m also not a rich man, I- I never could have cared for Harry.”

“That’s bullshit,” Tony said glibly. “I mean I don’t know the whole wolf business, but there’s welfare and shit to help raise kids. I’d rather my kid grew up in the projects with a werewolf than where he did.”

Harry grimaced and was left in the uncomfortable situation of either pretending to wake up and being drawn in the conversation or containing to feign sleep and listen while he was being discussed.

Lupin’s next words firmed up Harry’s determination to stay out of the conversation as much as he wished he’d fallen back asleep the moment he heard Sirius was alive.

“Albus assured me that Harry was safest with Lily’s sister, I never thought to doubt him,” Lupin sighed. “Had I known that you were Harry’s father from the start, perhaps I could have done something more.”

“Sirius said you taught at Harry’s school when he was thirteen,” Tony said slowly in a tone Harry heard all too often.

Tony was about to trick Lupin into saying something he didn’t want to say.

“I did.”

“So you saw Harry when he was thirteen and I’m guessing he’s always looked like me, right? So why the hell didn’t you do something then? You couldn’t write a letter? Pick up a phone?”

He could have told me… Harry thought to himself, remembering all the times Lupin said Harry looked so much like his father. If Hermione and Justin Finch-Fletchey recognized Tony, and Tony was rather famous, then surely Lupin, who met Tony before, would have seen Tony in Harry’s features?

Harry could have met his dad before his fourth year. Harry could have met his dad before the Triwizard Tournament - before Cedric, before Voldemort.

A sick wave of anger crashed over Harry when he realized that Cedric could still be alive if Lupin had just said something to Harry in his third year.

“I don’t have a good answer,” Lupin said heavily, sounding exhausted. “I may have been a Gryffindor, but I’m afraid I was always the coward in our group.”

“You won’t hear any arguments from me,” Tony said before yawning hugely. “Are you staying on seriously Sirius watch or am I?”

“I will,” Lupin offered quickly. “You look exhausted. I can’t imagine you’ve had it easy with both Harry and Sirius here.”

Harry mentally rolled his eyes. As if Sirius were some sort of burden, all he did was drink in pubs, shag random blokes, and help Tony on deadly missions. Sirius wasn’t near the same level of burden as Harry was with his trail of dead bodies and ADHD and depression and… and all the Death Eaters and crazed killers that Harry brought along with him.

“They aren’t exactly crosses to be carried,” Tony said, making Harry grin despite himself. “Wake me and the kid up if Sirius wakes up before we do.”

After Lupin agreed, Harry heard as Tony’s footsteps approached where he laid and a gently hand was sat on the top of his head for a moment before it sounded as if Tony climbed on a bed near Harry’s.

Harry waited until he heard Tony’s breathing even out and eventually stutter in quiet snores before he opened his eyes and silently looked around the room. It was dark, but Harry could see Lupin’s back in a chair where he sat beside the bed that Sirius laid in. And, if Harry squinted, he could see Sirius’ chest rising and falling, proof Harry hadn’t imagined Tony saying he survived.

Nobody else was in the hospital like room, and Harry was relieved that Wanda’s body was gone, so Harry quietly got up so he didn’t wake Tony sleeping in the bed beside his.

“Harry!” Lupin looked up when Harry padded quietly over to Sirius. Lupin looked exhausted, but Harry was rather peeved at him at the moment, so Harry just nodded in greeting before climbing on Sirius’ bed by his feet and watching him sleep deeply.

Harry didn’t even realize how much he loved Sirius - needed him - until he thought he’d lose him.

“How are you?” Lupin asked in a kind voice while Harry held his hand just above Sirius’ mouth, rejoicing every time he felt a warm puff of air touch his skin.

“Fine,” Harry said, a bit shortly. He stretched out beside Sirius, knowing he wouldn’t care, and yanked the blanket until they were sharing it. Harry slept in Sirius’ bed more nights than not when he’d been at Grimmauld Place.

They were a matched fit for sleeping- when Sirius began thrashing in his sleep, he usually kicked Harry awake from a nightmare. When Harry screamed out in his sleep, Sirius jolted awake and kicked Harry awake.

And now Harry just needed to be able to sleep knowing Sirius would still be warm, breathing, and alive when Harry woke up.

Except apparently Lupin wanted to chat.

“I heard you’re not at Hogwarts anymore,” he said, smiling slightly when he saw Harry cozying up with Sirius. “That must be odd.”

“You mean brilliant?” Harry drawled. “Because it is brilliant.”

Lupin seemed taken aback by Harry’s response, but Harry wasn’t exactly feeling pleasant toward him just then. Not only was Tony right and Lupin never once tried to really interact with Harry or even tell him about Tony, but Lupin was also the one who crushed Sirius’ self-esteem to nothing and made him think he was some ugly, unlovable, loser.

So, no.

Harry wasn’t Lupin’s biggest fan at the moment.

“Oh, well I’m glad you’re adjusting,” Lupin said. He cleared his throat quietly and shifted in the seat that didn’t look very comfortable. “How are you and your father getting along?”

“We’re as close as can be,” Harry lied breezily. “It’s shocking how close you can get to someone when you’ve known them for five whole months.”

“Ah, good.” Lupin sounded and looked discomfited and Harry nearly grinned. “And… has it been nice having Sirius around? I know the two of you have always gotten along.”

Harry rolled on his side so his back was to Lupin so his face was hidden. He really hoped Sirius and Tony were both deeply asleep, he’d hate for them to think he was serious.

“I thought it would be awkward for me, with T- Dad and Sirius, but it’s been great, really. It’s sort of like having two dads now, you know?”

It took a moment before Lupin picked up what Harry was trying to imply, and Harry was smiling outright when he did. It was stretching the truth to its breaking point, since Harry was fairly sure they’d just shagged once - which was why Harry was never going to go looking for tylenol in the middle of the night again - but Harry hoped it bothered Lupin.

Tonks was pretty, but Tony was listed as one of the most eligible bachelors in the world, something Gwen said basically meant he was ‘hot, rich, and single’.

“Your father and Sirius are- are… together?” Lupin asked, sounding shocked.

“Mhmm,” Harry hummed, starting to feel drowsy again. “They call each other ‘love’ and ‘darling’, it’s fucking disgusting, but I’ve never seen Sirius so happy.”

Lupin was quiet for long enough that Harry truly did begin to fall back asleep. And just before he drifted off, he heard a soft, “That’s nice.”

It was nice. It was nice that Lupin knew he wasn’t the only person in the world who got to be happy.

 

When Harry woke up next, it was to the scratchy feeling of being licked on the face.

“Get off,” Harry laughed, shoving the giant black dog on his chest until he fell over on the floor.

Padfoot looked up at Harry with his tongue wagging and a smile curling up his muzzle. Lupin’s chair was empty, so was Tony’s bed, and Harry could see the sunlight streaming through clear windows.

“Are you hiding as Padfoot because you think I won’t be pissed at a dog?” Harry asked him, adopting a stern expression.

Padfoot woofed and wagged his tail, smacking it against the tiled floor.

“Don’t ever do that to me again,” Harry scowled. He slid off the bed and kneeled in front of Padfoot. “I’m seri— I am the opposite of joking,” he snapped, wiping the smile off Padfoot’s muzzle. Harry lowered his voice to something softer, more genuine.

“Please, Pads…” Harry reached out to pat the top of Padfoot’s head and stare in his eyes that were always grey. “You promised not to be a hero. You promised- you promised not to leave me, Sirius,” Harry’s voice broke and his face crumpled. “You swore it, Siri.”

The fur beneath Harry’s hand changed to thick black hair and Harry was pulled forward in a crushing embrace that he desperately returned.

“I’m sorry, I’m so bloody sorry…”

“I thought you were dead. I thought you were gone.”

“I’d never leave you like that, I swear.”

“You almost did.”

“I know.”

“I told you to be a coward.”

“I know you did. I’m sorry.”

Harry pulled until Sirius let him fall back enough that Harry could look him in his eyes.

“Promise to never do it again,” Harry said, his voice rough from crying. He stared hard in Sirius’ eyes and willed him to understand what a nightmare the last seventy-two hours had been for him. “Please, Siri, promise you won’t go with them again.”

When Sirius wouldn’t - couldn’t - Harry got up with a cold mask in place.

“At least you’ll die a hero, right, Padfoot? Always wanted to be like James, didn’t you?”

When Sirius’ face crumpled and Harry hoped he felt even a fraction of the pain Harry did when he thought his godfather was dead, Harry spun on his heel and went up to his flat to find Tony.

 

“Either you quit or I’m moving out.”

Tony was laying on the sofa on his back with one arm tucked beneath his head and another laying over his chest. He had his eyes closed, but Harry knew he was awake.

“Done.”

Harry hesitated, a rant already on the tip of his tongue. “What?”

Tony peeked one eye open at Harry. “I quit. I’m going to kill Darth Vader when we find him, then I’m done. Iron Man is hanging up his jersey.”

Harry moved to sit in Tony’s usual chair and stared uncertainly at him. “Just because I said it?” he asked. “Or- or were you always planning on quitting?”

Not that it really mattered to Harry one way or another, but Harry didn’t understand why Tony so easily gave up something he seemed to love.

Tony sat up and shrugged while he ran his hand through his hair. “I can’t- I can’t just die and leave you with Rhodey,” he said baldly, turning to look at Harry. “You’re my kid and not being shot by some OP robot seems more important than being the hero.”

Harry had no idea what ‘OP’ was, probably the tech-talk that he could never really follow, but he did understand the rest of it.

“I’m- I’m more important than you being a hero?” Harry asked, embarrassed by the croak in his voice.

James and Lily sacrificed themselves for Harry.

Sirius thought saving the world was more of a priority over staying with Harry.

But Tony… Tony was willing to live for Harry.

Tony was willing to take the cowards way out - the same path Harry took when he came to New York - to be there for Harry.

“I guess so.” Tony grinned crookedly, as if he hadn’t just tipped Harry’s world upside down. “How’s pizza for dinner sound?”

Terrible, honestly.

“Sounds good… Dad.”

    ULTRON IS DEAD
    I’m sorry for the confusion- last chapter I know Tony said ‘once Ultron is dead, he’s hanging up the suit’, but I meant ‘Darth Vader’, aka Voldemort.

Chapter Text

Tuesday, October 2

Here’s the thing….

Peter read Twilight, even if he won’t admit it. But he read it and totally thought that Bella Swan had serious issues and Edward Cullen was a freaking creep. They sort of made a perfect crazy couple, like Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.

So when Peter started finding himself hanging around outside Stark Tower and realized he was pulling an Edward Cullen, he didn’t feel great about it.

Except Harry was being stalked and by more than just Peter.

Originally, Peter had spent the last weekend hanging around in the shadows and on nearby rooftops to wait and see if Harry’s dad made it back from Sokovia. The news had said there had been multiple injuries and a casualty on the Avengers team and nobody knew who had died. And it wasn’t like Peter could ask Harry about it since last time he called Harry hung up on him and his phone had been out of service ever since.

So Peter just decided to hang around and make sure Tony Stark and Sirius Black made it back from their latest mission.

Even if he and Harry weren’t exactly speaking, Peter wasn’t going to let some stupid fight keep him from being there if Harry’s dad or his godfather died.

And on the day the black Avengers jet returned and Peter saw Tony Stark and Clint Barton carrying a bloody Sirius Black off it, Peter also noticed the guy stalking Harry.

The guy was obviously bad news if Peter’s new spider-senses could be trusted. He lingered in shadows and hid in alleys and never stopped watching Stark Tower. He was tall, broad, with shoulder length dark hair, and a silver hand Peter could see sticking out of the black jacket he always wore.

Peter thought he was stalking Tony Stark, who surely had no shortage of enemies, until Harry took Joey for a walk and the guy followed him in the shadows.

Harry looked like hell, he’d looked like hell for about a week or so, but he still talked to Joey while they walked and Peter pretended he was talking to him.

“Sirius is a bloody moron,” Harry grouched to Joey the day before both of their expulsions ended and Harry would return to school. “‘Kiddo, you know I love you’,” Harry said in a deep voice, probably mocking his godfather. “‘I can’t just sit by and watch the world burn, not if I can help it’.”

Peter grinned while he climbed along the buildings, keeping his eye on Harry’s stalker and his ear on Harry’s complaints. Peter had seen on the news that Sirius Black, the newest Avenger, had survived his injuries, the only death had been Wanda Maximoff, so he was relieved to know Sirius was in good enough shape to be pissing off harry.

“Why can’t he, huh?” Harry asked Joey, stopping at the little bodega on the corner to scratch Joey’s ears. “If Tony can quit, why can’t Sirius?”

Joey whined and Harry nodded at him as if it meant anything.

“You’re right,” Harry said. “Sirius is a prat. C’mon, let’s get a drink.”

Peter hesitated to swing out and snatch Harry’s stalker, rip him away from Harry before he could make a move, but the guy didn’t seem like he wanted to attack Harry so Peter decided to wait until Harry was home.

Except Harry left the bodega with two cans of coke - Peter really hoped one wasn’t actually for Joey - and then took a detour on his way back that ended in a dead-end alleyway. Peter climbed up on the roof to see what Harry was doing in a place like that - again - and he saw the other guy lingering at the entrance of the alley behind a dumpster.

“Are you going to tell me why you’re stalking me?” Harry drawled, causing Peter to duck behind the ledge of the roof while his heart raced.

He was in costume, there was no way Harry saw him or knew who he was… right?

“Are you going to tell me what a death eater is now?”

Peter spun around and looked over, shocked to see Harry’s stalker walking all casually up to him with his hands in his pockets.

Harry didn’t look scared or worried at all, not like he had the night he’d been ganged up on before Peter could help him —

“You’re my hero.”

But Peter’s senses didn’t scream at this confrontation like they had that night. Instead, Peter felt uneasy at the almost familiar way Harry tossed the guy one of the drinks.

“A death eater is someone who eats death, clearly,” Harry said with a casual shrug. Peter grinned a little, Harry was the most sarcastic person he’d ever met. Harry leaned against the alley wall and took a drink of his coke while he watched the other guy closely. “Your turn, Bucky.”

“You can call me James,” the other guy said. He had a raspy voice, something appealing and dangerous about it.

Gwen would call it sexy, but Peter didn’t find it real sexy.

“I’m not going to do that,” Harry said with a sneer. “Quit playing games, why have you been following me?”

“You live in that tower, right?” James/Bucky asked, slowly moving to lean against the wall of the building where Peter hid on the roof.

“You’d know, stalker.”

It wasn’t that Harry’s sarcasm wasn’t just dry enough to be sexy, it was that Harry was one of those people that Peter was sure would get shot for his mouth one day. One day if Peter wasn’t around, which it didn’t seem like he would be if he couldn’t get his shit together.

“Do you know who lives there?” James/Bucky asked Harry slowly.

“I’d have to be a bloody moron not to.”

God, Harry, please shut up.

“So you know it isn’t safe.”

Peter could see Harry tilt his head to the side and draw his eyebrows down like he was confused. Which was fair because Harry was like the safest person in the world in that tower full of assassins and superheroes and whatever sort of enhanced individual the news exposed Sirius Black as.

“Why wouldn’t I be safe there?” Harry asked the guy. “What do you think I’m in danger of, Bucky?”

“Everything!” James/Bucky lunged forward to Harry and Peter had a web ready to shoot, but the guy stopped just short of actually touching Harry.

“They tried to kill me,” James/Bucky said in a low voice to Harry. “And they’re going to kill you too.”

That guy sounded wacko, like one of the unmedicated schizophrenics who went around shouting about the end of the world.

Harry slid his hand with the leash on his wrist in his pocket and Peter really hoped he had something dangerous in there.

“Mate, it’s not that I don’t have my own problems with them all, but they don’t exactly attack upstanding citizens, do they?” Harry asked, finally a small quiver to his voice, one that said Peter was going to step in soon. “So what’d you do to them?”

“Nothing!” James/Bucky yelled, his voice echoing around the alley. “Or- I don’t remember- I don’t know! I just know they are dangerous and you’re just a kid and I couldn’t save anyone else but I can you! Come on,” the guy grabbed Harry’s shoulder roughly with his silver hand, “I know a place you can hide.”

Aaaaand, showtime.

Nobody was going to kidnap Peter’s ex-boyfriend who might be his boyfriend again if Peter could ever get his shit together.

Peter leapt off the roof and flipped mid-air while he shot a web at James/Bucky and yanked him toward to opposite wall, cracking his head on the brick.

“Oi! What are you doing?” Harry yelled.

James/Bucky was on his feet in an instant, a furious twist of his features, and kicked off the wall to try and snag Peter from where he clung midway up the other wall.

“Making new friends,” Peter said nonchalantly, working quickly to stay out of the creeps reach. “I don’t like yours very much.”

“He’s messed up! Leave him alone!” Harry shouted at Peter. “Bucky, BUCKY! Quit!”

Peter shot another web at ‘Bucky’, but the guy dodged it with some damn good instincts. Peter dropped to the ground and stood in front of Harry when ‘Bucky’ crouched down across the alley from him.

“JAMES BUCKY WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS, QUIT!” Harry screamed as he tried to dart around Peter and Peter wouldn’t let him. “AND WHOEVER THE FUCK YOU ARE, MOVE!”

Peter didn’t move, he had all his senses pointed directly at the lethal guy facing off with him, but Harry’s words clearly struck a cord in the guy.

‘Bucky’ slowly stood up and Peter watched the play of emotions flit across his face quickly - confusion, anger, shock, and then a sort of crushing sadness that almost had Peter feeling sorry for the asshole.

“Look what you did,” Harry sighed when ‘Bucky’ just turned tail and booked it out of the alley. “You’re not very good at making friends, are you?”

Peter turned around and hadn’t been that close to Harry since he lost his temper and threw a freaking beanbag at his face. Harry had his eyes narrowed while he quickly glanced over Peter’s most recent suit and Peter took the chance to see how tired and pale Harry was.

“You okay?” Peter asked, only barely remembering to lower his voice a few notches.

Harry’s angry glare flickered for a second at Peter’s genuine question. “You’re the red skin bloke from before, aren’t you?” he asked. “Are you stalking me too?”

Peter stepped back, giving Harry some space, and shrugged his shoulders since Harry couldn’t see him grinning beneath his mask.

“I was in the neighborhood,” he lied. “Seems like you’ve always got something exciting going on though, maybe I should start stalking you.”

“You’ll have to get in queue,” Harry said, quirking his lips up in a grin. “I’ve already got my dad stalking me and my mate Bucky, I’m not sure how many more I can handle.”

“You and that guy are friends?” Peter asked him. What the hell had he missed?! “He was trying to like kidnap you!”

Harry’s grin was gone in an instant and he huffed at Peter while Joey yipped and ran in a circle.

“There’s something wrong with him,” Harry said coolly. “I think he’s a bit messed up in the head, but he’s not dangerous.”

“Dude, are you kidding me?”

Had Harry always had some sort of death wish?

“That guy is dangerous with a capital D,” Peter said. “You should tell your dad about him, have him locked up.”

“Oh, a capital D?” Harry laughed and took a drink of the can of coke he still had in his hand. “Says the bloke stalking me.”

“I’m the bloke saving you,” Peter pointed out, shocked and impressed by how casual Harry was by the whole thing. “I’m Spider-Man, by the way,” he said, offering Harry his hand.

By the way, I’m sorry.

By the way, I might be in love with you.

By the way, you should run and never look back.

“I’d shake your hand but then I’d have to either put down my drink or let go of the laser in my pocket I might shoot you with,” Harry said with a sarcastic grin.

Peter laughed and dropped his hand. “So you’re going to shoot your hero but not the guy who has some beef with the Avengers and tried to kidnap you?”

“I haven’t decided to shoot you yet,” Harry said factually. “And I wouldn’t shoot Bucky, I told you, he’s got some sort of problem.”

“Yeah, he’s crazy.”

Harry shrugged and finished off his drink before tossing it in the dumpster beside him.

“I should get home before someone comes looking for me,” Harry said. “Do you want to walk with me or stalk me from the rooftops?”

“I’ll walk with you,” Peter offered, not wanting to pass up the chance to talk with Harry.

They hadn’t talked since - since before Uncle Ben died. Nothing more than nasty comments in the halls and a freaking stupid screaming match in gym. And Peter missed his best friend more than anything, but Harry had a whole list of secrets he was keeping from Peter and it wasn’t like Peter didn’t have his own secret now.

It just sucked.

They made a weird set, walking down the city streets- Iron Man’s son, a guy in a spider costume, and a German Shepherd that was getting to be adult sized with puppy energy.

Thankfully, it was New York, so there were a lot weirder people to look at.

“Why aren’t you at school?” Peter asked when a bus drove past them on the street.

“I’m suspended,” Harry said. He glanced over at Peter and raised an eyebrow. “How old are you?”

“Nineteen,” Peter lied. “How’d you get suspended?”

“I got in a fight with… a classmate,” Harry said slowly. “Why do you keep following me?”

“I like to play the hero,” Peter laughed. “I saw your dad was in a fight recently, is he okay?”

“Yeah, he’s fine,” Harry said. They came to a stop at the end of the block where Stark Tower sat and Harry looked up at Peter curiously.

“Why do you care?”

Why did Peter care that Harry’s dad was alive and Harry was happy?

“Why wouldn’t I?” Peter asked, forgetting for a moment that Harry didn’t know who he was talking to. “You’re- I see you, you know, and you’re funny and like way too freaking brave. And you care about some crazy dude even though he was definitely going to kidnap you. Why wouldn’t I care that you’re happy?”

“You don’t even know me,” Harry said flatly. “Stalking me doesn’t count as being friends, I’m mostly sure.”

“Then let’s be friends,” Peter said impulsively. “Hi, I’m Spider-Man, my favorite color is red and my favorite food is tacos.”

Harry stared at Peter’s hand he held out for a moment before he looked up at Peter and grinned.

“Hi, Harry Stark, my favorite color is also red and I don’t have a favorite food.”

Peter laughed, feeling happier in that moment than he had in a long time, while he shook Harry’s hand.

“I’ll see you around, Harry Stark who doesn’t have a favorite food,” Peter said cheerfully when he saw Sirius Black stick his head out the tower door, probably looking for Harry.

“You’ll see me before I see you, stalker,” Harry said with a smirk. He called at Peter when Peter quickly began swinging away, hiding his existence from Sirius. “I like the new suit! It’s better than a red mask and sunglasses!”

 

Peter was on top of the world the entire way home. That was the most he’d been able to talk to Harry in weeks, and they were friends again, sort of.

 

“What’s got you smiling?” Aunt May asked after Peter shed the suit and went inside their home.

Aunt May was at the stove, stirring a saucepan of what smelled like marinara sauce, and she looked a little more peaceful when she smiled at Peter than she had in a long time.

“Can’t a guy be happy to have a beautiful woman making him dinner?” Peter asked, kissing his aunt on the cheek fondly.

“He can be, but he isn’t usually,” Aunt May said suspiciously. She watched Peter with sharp and clever eyes while he dutifully got a few plates - not three… they didn’t need three anymore… - from their worn down cabinets and set them on the table.

“Did you talk with Harry and apologize?” Aunt May asked him after she brought their meal to the table and Peter served them both.

“Sort of,” Peter hedged. He took a bite of the spaghetti she made and smiled. “It’s good.”

Aunt May melted and gave Peter a warm smile. “I’m glad you talked to him, he was a nice boy and you were so happy together.”

They had been happy together, but Harry was a dick.

Harry was a dick in the way that Peter found way too attractive. Harry was a dick like Johnny Cade was a dick and Peter so clearly had a type.

And if Harry was Johnny Cade then Peter was Bob Sheldon, complete with throwing shit at Harry and causing Uncle Ben to die.

“We’re not together, Aunt May,” Peter said, his own thoughts drowning his brief joy. “I- I messed up, alright? Let’s drop it.”

Aunt May frowned at him, but they changed the topic to little odds and ends things that needed done around the house until Peter washed the dishes and went up to his room.

For a while, Peter just sat at his desk and looked at the photos that faded across his computer screen.

Uncle Ben and Aunt May on their anniversary.

Harry sitting on his skateboard, laughing at something Peter had said.

Gwen when she won the regional public speaking event.

Harry drunk in his living room, waving his hands around while he told a story Peter couldn’t remember.

Peter and Uncle Ben when Peter was about ten on a fishing trip. Peter had buck teeth and a teeny tiny little fish he caught while Uncle Ben had been smiling down at him the whole time.

Harry when he was covered in puppies on the day they met.

There were more pictures of Harry than anyone else saved on Peter’s computer. Ever since Harry mentioned not having any pictures of himself as a kid, Peter decided to play his personal photographer. It didn’t hurt that Harry had ‘good looking and I don’t know it’ down to a freaking science.

Peter toyed with his phone in his hands while he watched the photos on his computer screen filter through. He could apologize, he should. He was the one that pushed Harry away when all Harry had done was try and care about the little injuries Peter got from playing vigilante. Then Peter was the one who let himself be dragged in a screaming and throwing match in gym and got them both suspended.

Harry wasn’t blameless in it, but Peter had started it way before that day.

Peter pulled up his texts and typed a short one out, only hesitating for a moment before pressing send.

I’m sorry

Message Not Delivered

Except apparently Harry still had Peter blocked, which was just freaking great.

 

It wasn’t until Peter was swinging through the city that night, looking for the man who killed his uncle when he couldn’t sleep, that he had a realization.

Harry might be pissed at Peter, but he didn’t seem to have a problem with Spider-Man.

 

At school the next morning, Gwen slid up to Peter at his locker before first hour.

“Harry’s godfather almost died, and something big is happening at Stark Tower tonight,” she said immediately. “Harry won’t tell me what, but Tony Stark sent out a memo for a press release tonight.”

“Cool,” Peter muttered. Gwen insisted on playing some sort of go-between with him and Harry even though Peter never asked her to. And Peter already knew about Sirius, he also knew that he was fully healed with whatever super medicinal serum they used to heal Harry when he’d been beat up.

“Hey!” Gwen slammed her hand on Peter’s locker, shutting it just before he snatched his sociology book from it. Gwen glared at Peter with the full measure of a 110 pound, 5’7” girl with braided blonde pigtails.

“You were having a crisis and now I think Harry is,” she said sternly. “He’s upset, Peter. And- and he’s sick and he’s sad and maybe you could just talk to him.”

Peter rested his forehead on the locker and sighed heavily. “Gwen, he doesn’t want to talk to me,” he said. “You go be his friend, alright?”

“Boys are the stupidest creatures to ever walk the earth,” Gwen snapped as she turned and walked down the hall to her own first hour class.

Yeah, boys were. Especially Peter.

 

Peter kept sneaking glanced to Harry in third hour and Harry did look sick.

Harry had his head laying on the desk, his eyes closed and his face turned toward where Peter sat across the room from him. There were bags under his eyes and he looked pale and sweaty. Even while he was drooling on his Spanish book, his eyes flickered behind the lids and his foot twitched intermittently.

Peter wondered what was happening with him and he wondered what Harry dreamt of.

Was it about the kid Harry said died in front of him?

Was it about his dad or his godfather or the parents he used to have?

It was times like then that Peter wished his spider powers came with mind-reading.

 

At lunch, Peter sat in the cafeteria with his headphones in and he tried to resist the urge to follow Harry outside and talk.

“You’re a moron,” Gwen said after sitting down and yanking one of Peter’s headphones from his ear. She gave Peter half of her pb&j, something she’d ate every lunch since kindergarten, and a pitying smile. “Harry cares about you, Peter, and you care about him. Why can’t you go talk to him?”

“Because I messed up, Gwen, okay? I pushed him away and I yelled at him and I threw a freaking beanbag at him and made him bleed.” Peter ripped the crust off his half of the sandwich and wadded it in a ball. “Gwen, I’m such a fuck up, and Harry’s… Harry’s…”

“Sort of a fuck up too,” Gwen said thoughtfully. “Don’t look at me like that,” she rolled her eyes when Peter frowned at her, “you know it’s true. He’s handsome and his accent it to die for, but he’s sarcastic and rude and like your perfect match.”

“Thanks Gwen, really, that’s helpful,” Peter said sarcastically. “You know if journalism doesn’t work out, you should try being a counselor.”

Gwen laughed and then lowered her voice. “Harry’s going to see a counselor after school tomorrow, but you better not tell him I told you. I bet he’d rather talk to you though.”

“He’s going to see a counselor?” Peter asked quietly. “Why?”

“Probably because he’s been freaking miserable lately, Peter,” Gwen said, rolling her eyes. “You’d know that if you two would stop being so self-centered and like go be miserable together.”

Peter shoved the last of Gwen’s shared sandwich in his mouth and pushed away from the table.

“Good talk, really,” he said, saluting Gwen. “I’ll see you later.”

“Talk to him!” Gwen yelled at Peter’s back.

Peter raised his hand in acknowledgement even though he had no intention of talking to Harry yet.

Not as Peter anyway.

 

Gym was uncomfortable with Coach Man watching Peter and Harry like he thought they might start throwing punches any moment.

Peter mostly just focused on dulling his senses and trying to play basketball without making any crazy leaps or busting the ball on the backboard.

And he focused on watching Harry as he tripped and fell up and down the court, really sucking ass at playing basketball.

 

But the instant the bell rang, Peter put his new (definitely stupid) plan in place.

 

“Hey, I’ve been waiting for you.”

Harry had been walking Joey down the sidewalk with a little frown on his face that afternoon. Peter had been waiting around, watching the news vans as they arrived and then watching when they left, until Harry finally took Joey for a walk around seven.

“Oh, Spider-Bloke.” Harry grinned at Peter and Peter wished he wasn’t hiding behind a mask and it was actually Peter that was getting that smile. “You really meant it when you said we were going to hang out?”

“Sure, why not?” Peter said, falling in step beside Harry. It was so familiar that it was killing him.

“Are you hoping to take Tony’s spot on the team? Because I don’t do the interviews, you know,” Harry said while they walked together.

“Take Tony’s spot, what?”

Harry paused mid-step then had a little pleased smile on his face when he continued. “Yeah, Tony quit the team. He had a whole news thing. It was bloody humiliating because he pulled me up on stage and said he was done so he could focus on his family.”

Harry might have said it was humiliating, and he was pink in the cheeks, but Peter thought he was actually happy about it. Peter would be happy if he knew his dad wasn’t off getting shot by super-robots or aliens from the sky.

“I’m glad,” Peter told Harry genuinely, ignoring his jealousy that Harry had his dad and Peter didn’t have a dad or even an uncle anymore.

“Me too,” Harry said with a sideways smile. “Tell me about you, Spider-Bloke, are you trying to join the other superheroes and risk your life like a bloody dunderhead?”

“A dunderhead?” Peter laughed. “Wow, that’s like the worst insult I’ve ever heard.”

Harry laughed too and Peter loved his laugh. They stopped so Joey could raise his leg on the fire hydrant on the corner.

“My teacher at my old school used to call me a dunderhead, it sounds more threatening when he says it, trust me.”

“I believe you,” Peter grinned. “Because when you say it it almost sounds like you’re flirting with me.”

Harry turned so red so quick that it made Peter laugh again.

“I am not flirting with you,” Harry sneered. “You’re probably hideous under the mask, like… no teeth and just ugly.”

“Wooow, listen to you,” Peter whistled. Joey finished peeing so they kept walking with Peter on the outside of the sidewalk and half his senses focused on making sure his danger-magnet didn’t attract any danger. “You think just because you’re like some model that you can go insulting me and my toothless self?”

Harry turned red again and glared down at the ground. “Funny,” he snapped. “You’re a funny bloke.”

“Yeah, I do stand up in my spare time,” Peter said. “I’m not kidding though, if you ever decide to sell your body to the tabloids, I know a photographer.”

“My boyfriend is a photographer,” Harry said lightly, sending a whole thrill through Peter’s body from top to bottom.

Boyfriend? Harry still considered him his—

“Er… ex-boyfriend, I guess.”

“Oh.” Peter’s thrill mellowed down to bitter disappointment. “Ex, huh? What- what happened?”

“He yelled at me,” Harry said, aiming a kick at a crushed pop can on the sidewalk.

Peter raised his brows, surprised at the low grade way Harry described it. Peter never even yelled at Harry, not until Harry yelled at him in gym.

“He yelled at you?” Peter asked blankly. “Why?”

“He showed up to school one day with a black eye, looked like someone kicked his arse, and all I did was ask if he was okay,” Harry said. “He told me it wasn’t my damn business and then yelled at me in front of everyone.”

It took a moment, but Peter finally remembered what Harry was talking about.

It had been just a few days after he buried Uncle Ben and Peter had gotten in a fight the night before with some gang-bangers that got a few good swings in before Peter left them tied up for the cops. Then Peter got to school and freaking hated himself for focusing on some drug dealing shit heads and not using his time to focus on finding Uncle Ben’s killer and Harry had came up to him with his bright eyes all concerned.

And Peter yelled at him, just as Harry said.

“He sounds like a moron,” Peter muttered. “It’s probably for the best you guys broke up.”

“He was my best friend here,” Harry said, his voice echoing Peter’s own sadness. “And now everything’s awful and I can’t even talk to him about it.”

Peter looked over at Harry and thought he looked lonely, just as he had when they met at the animal shelter.

“You can talk to me,” Peter offered. Harry couldn’t see his smile through his mask, but he hoped he could hear how genuine he was.

“I’m not a reporter or trying to join the Avengers or anything,” Peter said, warming up to the idea quickly. “I’m just some guy in a mask. I won’t tell anyone.”

Harry hummed skeptically while they turned around, headed back toward the tower.

“I just don’t feel like myself lately,” Harry finally said quietly. “Everything’s changing, and I don’t usually like change.”

“Who does?” Peter said sympathetically. “But your dad quitting the team is a good change, right?”

“Yeah, yeah it is,” Harry said, bobbing his head. “But my godfather won’t quit the team and I’ve got to go to therapy tomorrow and these bloody pills have my head spinning around and—”

“Woah,” Peter stuck his arm out, stopping Harry in the middle of the sidewalk. He touched his shoulder gently, staring hard in his eyes. “Are you using drugs?”

Peter knew addiction was genetic, and Tony told Harry he didn’t care if he did drugs before a party once, but Peter didn’t think Harry would ever actually do it.

Damn.

Apparently Peter missed quite a bit.

“What?” Harry looked at Peter’s mask and then abruptly started laughing. “No, you prat, it’s legal medicine but forget I said it, please. I’m just… I’m tired… and- and I dunno… I just never have anyone to talk to lately. Well, Gwen, but I think she tells my ex-boyfriend everything I say.”

Peter dropped his arm so they could keep walking, though Peter tried to do it slowly to drag time out. Gwen was a gossip and she did tell Peter a lot of what Harry said, but she hadn’t mentioned any medicine.

“I think like two thirds of Americans take medication,” Peter said, quoting something he heard in health class. “Are you like diabetic or something?”

“First off, I’m British, not American,” Harry drawled in his unfairly attractive accent. “And no, I’m not diabetic. I am allergic to mussels though.”

Peter listened and laughed the rest of the walk while Harry described what sounded like the worst dinner to ever be held in the White House.

“Wait, wait!” Peter was bent over at the waist down the road from the tower, laughing his ass off. “You thought the President had poisoned you?? Why would he do that?”

“Loads of people try and kill me, who knows,” Harry shrugged, grinning sheepishly. “I’ve never had an allergic reaction before, okay? Quit laughing, you wanker.”

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” Peter said, gasping to gain control of his laughter. “But who else tried to kill you?”

“Maybe I’ll tell you tomorrow, Spider-Bloke,” Harry said with a sorely missed grin. “I- er… sorry for dumping all that stuff on you, but I’ll be home tomorrow around five if you wanna go with me to walk Joey?”

“Sure,” Peter said, smiling like an idiot under his mask. “I’ll see you tomorrow so you can dump more stuff on me.”

“We’ll see,” Harry quipped. “See ya.”

Peter waved and watched Harry walk back in the tower before he swung off, humming a song to himself.

 

The next couple of weeks followed the same routine—

Peter and Harry didn’t talk at school, Gwen bugged them both most likely, and then when Peter was in costume, they talked just like they used to.

Harry told Peter he started therapy and now he had therapy on Fridays and tutoring on Mondays.

Peter told Harry he was looking for a man with shoulder length blonde hair, a scar on the left side of his jaw, and a star tattoo on his right hand.

Harry told Peter his godfather, Sirius, almost died on the last Avengers mission and they were fighting because Sirius wouldn’t quit the team.

Peter told Harry about how he got bit by a spider and gained all the abilities he didn’t understand.

They talked more as Spiderman and Harry than they had as Peter and Harry in so long.

 

Harry came outside the tower one day in mid-October with a heavy coat on and no dog.

“Where’s Joey?” Peter asked, tossing Harry a drink as he’d been doing recently.

“I wanted to ask you something,” Harry said, bouncing on the balls of his feet a little with a grin on his face. He looked better, whatever medicine he was on had clearly started evening out, and there was a little spark in his eyes that caught Peter’s interest.

“Yeah? What’s that?” Peter asked curiously.

“I’ve seen you on YouTube, YouTube, right? Right,” Harry nodded to himself. “And my dad thinks you’re a terrorist, by the way, so we don’t know each other, but I’ve seen you flying above the buildings and stuff.”

“Yeaaaaah…?”

“So…” Harry was beaming up at him and Peter knew he’d give Harry anything he wanted. “Can I go with you?”

“Hell yes,” Peter breathed.

 

Harry was whooping and laughing the whole time they swung through the skies. Peter kept a firm grasp on him and laughed when he looked down and saw Harry’s whole face lit up while the wind blew his hair back.

 

“That was brilliant!” Harry laughed when Peter landed them on a roof of an abandoned warehouse. Harry stumbled a little when Peter put him on his feet, so he kept an arm around his waist so he didn’t fall.

“I think your dad might find out we know each other now,” Peter laughed. “I saw a few camera phones aimed at us.”

“Who cares?” Harry said, still jubilant. He was smiling up at Peter so happily that it made Peter’s chest clench. “It was worth it to fly like that!”

“It’s worth it to see you smile like that,” Peter said impulsively.

Harry blinked and his smile faded a little, but the brightness of his eyes didn’t dim.

“Can I see you?” Harry asked softly. “I don’t care if you’re ugly.”

Peter looked down at Harry, who was lit up by his joy and the soft orange glow of the sunset. The wind was strong on the rooftop and Harry’s hair was blowing around; he’d never been so attractive and tempting before.

“I can’t,” Peter said. He kept one arm around Harry’s waist and used his free hand to pull his mask up just enough to show his mouth. “I can’t just yet.”

Peter couldn’t stand to have Harry angry at both Peter and Spider-Man.

“Okay,” Harry whispered. He reached up and wrapped his arms around Peter’s neck. “I- I like you though, Spider-Bloke.”

“I like you, Harry,” Peter said roughly. He tilted his head down so his forehead was resting against Harry’s. “If I could tell you who I am, I would.”

“Maybe I don’t care who you are,” Harry breathed. He tilted his face up until their mouths were nearly touching. “I know you’re a nice guy, you’re funny, and I like being around you.”

It was insanity, it was stupid, but Peter tightened his arm around Harry’s waist and Harry held Peter tightly and their lips crashed together in a kiss that felt just as heated as it did desperate.

 

Oh, Peter, how many different ways are you going to fuck things up?

Chapter Text

Thursday, October 18

“You have got to be fucking kidding me.”

Tony rubbed his eyes hard and looked again at the photo plastered across the front page of every online news report in the country.

There was New Yorks newest vigilante swinging through the skies in broad daylight with Harry clinging to him while the kid was obviously having the time of his life.

Stark’s Son Swings with Spiderman!

It wasn’t even an original title.

Public relations had been up Tony’s ass since the moment he sent Harry off to school that morning wanting to know how he wanted to play it.

Teenage rebellion, Avengers recruitment, or what?

Clearly they couldn’t say that Harry was the victim of a horrible kidnapping since the kid was smiling like a lunatic in the photo.

Tony spun his desk chair around and considered it for a moment…

“JARVIS?”

“Yes, sir?”

“Ask Pepper to come here if she’s free and send me everything on this Spider-Guy. It’s New York, he can’t really stay anonymous for long.”

“Yes, sir. I should have the information in your email momentarily.”

“Thanks.”

Tony scrubbed his face and looked at the photo again, only grinning a little to see the way Harry looked absolutely ecstatic in the photo. He told the kid that Spiderman was a domestic terrorist with the way he went around tying up people with rap sheets a mile long and no current proof of crimes.

Maybe he was catching criminals, but he was also making the criminals look like victims.

Spiderman was likely the one who saved Harry the night he got mugged, so it wasn’t like Tony hated the guy, but he’d rather not have his kid (literally) tangled up in the guy’s web.

While Tony waited for Pepper, he began sifting through the photos and videos on Spiderman that JARVIS sent him.

Whoever he was, he wasn’t camera shy, that was for sure.

There were hundreds of published photos and articles, thousands of videos from the street cameras. ‘#SuperSpider’ was trending on Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram with photos and videos praising him for his ‘good deeds’.

Tony clicked on one video and quickly fixed the resolution so he could clearly see as Spiderman came up on what looked like a car jacking and began toying with the guy.

“Get the fuck out of here!” The guy pulled a knife and pointed it at Spiderman. “Forget you saw this or it ain’t gonna be pretty.”

“Oh my God, is that a small knife? Please, no! I have such a weakness for small knives!”

Tony rubbed his chin and replayed that part again.

“I have such a weakness for small knives!”

Tony kept replaying that on a loop, frowning at the screen. It wasn’t Spiderman’s snark that felt familiar, it was his voice.

The next video he listened to wasn’t much better in terms of jogging his memory. If he had to guess, Spiderman couldn’t be older than early twenties, but that was about as much as he knew for sure.

Tony found a security camera video of Harry and Spiderman up on a roof the day they must have gone flying around together and clicked on it.

“I- I like you though, Spider-Bloke.”

Oh, kid. C’mon… no…

“I like you, Harry. If I could tell you who I am, I would.”

“Maybe I don’t care who you are. I know you’re a nice guy, you’re funny, and I like being around you.”

Tony knew exactly what was coming just before his son raised his chin and Spiderman tilted his down.

“Et tu, Junior?” Tony groaned, pausing the video.

Tony thought Harry’s antidepressant was just doing great work when Harry had been all shiny eyed and smiling during dinner last night.

Was this Tony’s karma for screwing Howard’s assistant after he fired him for theft?

It felt like some sort of karma.

Tony checked the time and was fairly certain Harry would be at lunch, so he sent a quick text to Harry’s recently replaced cell phone.

New rule: when we start making out with terrorists, maybe tell me before the news does?

Dad, you’ve got to come get me. People are being mad and there’s bloody news vans outside. I CANT EVEN EAT!

“Shit.” Tony hadn’t even thought about Harry being bothered at school over it all. Which was pretty damn inexcusable since he knew Harry made front page news that morning.

Sending Happy now, go wait in the office.

Hap, kid, quick.

On it, boss.

“Tony?”

Tony groaned and rolled his neck, working some of the tension out of it when Pepper stuck her head in his office.

“Rough day?” she asked sympathetically as she clicked her way in the room in her heels and skirt suit.

Tony pulled up the holographic screen and pulled his computers mirror screen up on it. “And just keeps getting worse.”

Pepper raised her brows at the very enthusiastic kiss Harry shared with the damn vigilante. “Oh, Harry, we don’t date terrorists.”

Tony snorted and finished off the coffee he had, knowing there wasn’t enough caffeine in the world to counter the headache he had building.

“Clearly he missed the memo,” Tony sighed. “He said he’s being mobbed at school by reporters, I just sent Happy to go get him.”

“I was worried about that,” Pepper said. She sat down across from Tony and pulled her phone out, tapping away quickly. “It looks like it’s News Seven and New York Daily.”

“Hacks,” Tony scoffed. News Seven were the ambulance chasers and NYD only covered celebrity gossip like rehab stints and affairs. They once took a photo of Nat with her torso turned just enough to make her look a bit pudgy and started reporting about ‘Possible Avengers Love Child!’

Tony didn’t know what Nat did in retaliation, but he knew that photo only ran a day before it was never seen again.

“Hey, Tony…” Pepper frowned at her phone and turned the screen so Tony could see some greasy bastard in a cheap suit reporting in front of Harry’s school. “Who’s that?”

“Isn’t his name like Chip or something ungodly stupid like that?”

Pepper rolled her eyes and handed Tony her phone. “Not him. Rewind a few seconds and look in the back, behind the silver Toyota.”

Tony obediently did it, watching the truck in the back until he saw a side profile of someone lurking behind the truck. The guy had a ball cap pulled down low and a dark jacket on while he watched Harry’s school. The dark hair hanging out below the cap was familiar, but it wasn’t until Tony saw a flash of a metal hand that it clicked in his head.

“Why the fuck is Sirius’ fuck buddy at Midtown?” Tony murmured, rewinding and watching it over and over. He was sure that was James… the same James that had gone back and forth with Harry at dinner and then ran out on Sirius…

Sure, he did Tony a favor because Sirius wound up in his bed that night, but why the fuck would he be outside Midtown High?

“JARVIS, where’s Sirius at?”

“Mister Black is in Mister Roger’s living room, sir.”

“Hey, don’t take off yet,” Pepper said, standing up when Tony did. “How are we playing the Spiderman angle? We need to release something before they keep making speculations.”

Tony poured himself a refill of coffee in his silver mug and hummed after taking a long drink.

“Avenger’s recruit?” Tony mused aloud.

“And affiliate him with the team?” Pepper asked skeptically. “He’s getting close to having a warrant out for his arrest, Tony.”

“Okay, yeah…” Tony ran a hand through his hair, feeling more frustrated than he had in a while. “Odds on Harry agreeing not to see him again?”

“He’s your son.”

“Good point,” Tony conceded. “Can this wait maybe an hour? Harry’ll be home soon and I can ask him about it. If we can get ‘Spider-bloke’s’ identity, we can assess it better.”

Tony was sure he’d met him before, his voice was damn familiar. He’d talked to him on the phone when Harry got mugged, but he didn’t think that was the memory niggling at him.

“One hour then text me,” Pepper said briskly. “We need a statement before they start with wild speculations and before that,” she pointed at the screen still showing Harry and the vigilante lip-locked on a rooftop, “gets out.”

“One hour,” Tony agreed. He snatched his phone off his desk and held his coffee like a lifeline. “You know, I sort of thought retiring the suit meant that my life would get easier.”

“You’ve got a teenager, nothing is going to be easy again,” Pepper said. She smiled at Tony and flicked her smooth ponytail over her shoulder. “You’re doing great though, Tony, really. Harry seems to be doing so much better lately.”

Harry had been doing better lately. His grades went up, even from just the straight failing grades he had to something a little higher than 60%. Strange said he was making quicker progress with his tutoring now that he could sit still for more than five seconds straight, and he’d been going to see his therapist every week without a fight. They adjusted the dose of his medicine and honestly Tony thought everything had been going smoothly lately.

Which should have been a red flag, apparently.

“Thanks,” Tony said, accepting the acclaim he didn’t deserve. It was Harry doing all the hard work, Tony was just sitting back and dealing with vigilantes and apparent stalkers. “I’ll text you as soon as I talk to Harry, maybe get some answers.”

“Good luuuuck,” Pepper sang.

Tony would need it, he was sure.

 

“Wow, I call it quits and suddenly I’m not invited to meetings anymore, rude.”

Tony waltzed in Steve’s place, looking around the table they had set up and covered in a bunch of classified documents that stank like SHIELD.

“How can we help you, Tony?” Steve asked, his voice a couple degrees cooler than Tony thought he deserved. Sure, Steve had been on a high horse about Tony quitting the team, but it wasn’t like Steve had kids and could commiserate with the choice Tony had to make.

The others were all friendly looking enough, except for Pietro who looked half-dead in his chair beside Sirius. Tony was surprised Pietro stuck around after Wanda died, honestly.

Tony paid for her body to be sent back to Europe and had all the cremation and funeral costs billed to him. He sort of assumed that Pietro was going to stay in Europe after the funeral; it had been Wanda’s idea to join the team, not his.

Not that Tony minded one way or another, Quick-Kid wasn’t as much of a threat in Tony’s world as Wanda had been, but still.

“I came to chat with Sirius,” Tony said lightly. He took the empty seat across from Sirius and pulled up a screen to play the video for them all. “Watch the silver Toyota in the back,” he said before having it play.

Everyone, aside from Pietro who was either stoned or drunk off his ass, leaned in to see the video being projected. The audio was muted and Tony zoomed in on the only area of interest.

Tony was so busy watching Sirius for any minute reaction that he almost missed the sharp look Nat sent at Steve the moment Sirius’ boy toy made his appearance.

“What am I missing here?” Tony asked, pausing it and looking from Nat to Steve to Sirius. “What? Did we recruit James and nobody told me?”

“How do you know his name?” Steve asked, calm aside from a itty bitty flicker of unease in those ‘baby blue and can’t lie for shit’ eyes of his.

The temperature in the room dropped and Tony felt like he was somehow way in the outfield while everyone else had been running the bases.

“How do you know his name?” Sirius asked Steve, at least reassuring Tony that they weren’t all working against him.

“What the hell is he doing outside the kid’s school?” Nat said, thankfully focusing on the important issue.

“HEY!” Tony raised his voice and the others all looked at him. “WHO THE HELL IS HE?”

“Aside from a disappointment of a shag,” Sirius added brightly.

“You had sex with Bucky?” Steve gaped.

Nat laughed meanly. “You fucked the Winter Soldier?”

Clint gasped, “That’s the fucking Winter Soldier?”

“Who is the Winter Soldier?” Tony and Pietro both asked, Tony furiously and Pietro dully.

Tony hadn’t resigned more than two and a half weeks ago and they all lived in his tower- where did they get off keeping secrets from him? Especially when those secrets were hanging around his son’s school?

“Tony, listen, this is a delicate situation…” Steve started slowly, his body tense and his voice tight. “Fury sent us on a mission back in March, a political assassin that needed caught.”

“And then we show up and it’s the God damned Winter Soldier,” Nat jumped in. “The Winter Soldier first popped up on SHIELD’s radar back in the 80’s. He’s one of the most prolific assassins out there.”

“You sound jealous, Nat,” Bruce said drily.

“They called him the Ghost because he was impossible to catch,” Nat spat bitterly. “He was never caught on camera, nothing.”

“Until we found him,” Steve said. He cleared his throat and looked as uncomfortable as Tony had ever seen him. “And the Winter Soldier was Bucky… my… my best friend, Bucky.”

Everyone looked at Steve- even Pietro lifted his head to blink blearily at him.

Tony’s head was spinning, actually, and he thought he might throw all his coffee back up… preferably on Steve.

Not only was Harry making out with masked vigilantes on rooftops, but he was being stalked by an assassin so accomplished that the Black Widow was jealous.

Tony quickly sent Happy a message, holding his breath until Happy confirmed he had Harry in the car and would bring him straight to Tony.

“You’ve got other friends?” Sirius asked Steve with a mocking lilt to his tone. “Fit ones that hang out in pubs?”

“Oh, you’ll like this,” Nat said, leaning across the table to smile cruelly at Sirius. “Bucky and Steve are the same age.”

“Really?” Sirius didn’t seem put out by Bucky’s age, he just looked appraisingly at Steve. “Bloody hell, well he’s fit for a hundred year old bloke.”

“I don’t give a damn about that!” Tony thundered, smacking the table hard and regaining the spotlight. “What I want to know is why is some superhuman assassin STALKING MY SON?!”

Nobody had an answer, but Steve looked guilty as hell.

“Bucky isn’t in his right mind,” he said firmly. “He was hijacked by HYDRA and programmed to kill.”

“This just gets worse and worse!” Tony yelled, throwing his hands in the air. “‘Don’t worry, Tony, Bucky’s a good guy, he was just programmed by HYDRA’!”

“He was harmless,” Sirius said, trying to assure Tony probably.

“YOU SAID HE NEARLY BROKE YOUR ARM!”

“I can talk to him, find out why he’s hanging around Harry’s school,” Steve said quickly, too quickly. “But Tony, you can’t breathe a word of this. If SHIELD or HYDRA find him—”

“Get out.”

“What?” Steve raised his brows at Tony.

Tony took a deep breath and ensured that he was making a rational decision.

Yeah, he was.

Tony leaned toward Steve and repeated himself.

“I said get out,” Tony said calmly. “When your first concern is about keeping the assassin from being caught instead of Harry’s safety, I don’t want you here.”

“Tony, wait, this isn’t—”

“Shut up,” Tony told Bruce, not taking his eyes off Steve. “It’s my tower, it’s my money paying for the jet and all your other cozy comforts. And more than that- this is Harry’s home. So get out.”

“Fine.” Steve stood up and nodded. “I understand, Tony. Harry is your family, but Bucky is mine.”

“If you find your friend before I do, I’d tell him to stay far the fuck away from my kid,” Tony said harshly. “Russia sounds nearly far enough away from him.”

“And they don’t have extradition treaties,” Sirius said, thankfully siding with Tony.

The rest of the team looked from Tony to Steve, torn as they weighed the heavy tension between the two of them. Tony didn’t look away from Steve, he couldn’t believe that was someone he considered his friend.

Steve’s real ‘best friend’ was an enhanced assassin and Steve knew he was running free and didn’t think to warn anyone. More than that, he sat high up on his pedestal, judging Tony, when Tony didn’t tell anyone about trying to pursue Project Ultron.

Steve stood by while everyone turned their backs on Tony for ‘keeping secrets’ while he had his secret hidden from SHIELD and the rest of the Avengers both.

“I’ll reach out to the rest of you about this trip to Brasília,” Steve said. He collected a handful of the folders and documents on the table and then looked to Tony again. “Tony, Bucky is my family, but so are you.”

“You’re wrong, Cap, Harry is my family,” Tony said with a sneer. “I guess I wasn’t the only one keeping things from the team, huh?”

“I guess since I knew about it, I should go too,” Nat said, rising in a single fluid motion.

Bruce lifted his hand to Nat while his brown eyes went all sad and puppy-like. “Natasha…”

“Tony, come on,” Clint said, “you can’t rip the team apart… you’re not even leading it anymore.”

“I didn’t rip anything in half,” Tony said. He nodded his head where Steve stood still looking righteous and just the perfect shade of apologetic. “If you want to play the blame game, I’d look to Mister Red, White, and Blue.”

Clint scrubbed his face and growled quietly before getting up and snatching the documents that sat before him in his hands. “Steve should have told us,” he shot Steve and Nat a hard look, “but if they go then I guess I’m going too.”

“Fine by me,” Tony said blithely. “Sure, everyone was ‘fuck Tony’ when I kept a secret, but Steve keeps one and nobody cares.”

“Your secret had the potential to destroy the world!” Steve snapped.

Tony got to his feet and slapped his hands on the table. “AND YOURS IS STALKING MY WORLD!”

“Tony is correct,” Pietro drawled tiredly. “The moral high ground is not quite so high now, is it, Steve?”

“If I knew Bucky was an assassin, I wouldn’t have brought him around my bloody godson,” Sirius added, genuinely looking disgusted when he looked dismissively at Steve. “Way to keep everyone ‘appraised on the situation’, mate.”

When Bruce didn’t add anything, but didn’t stand up, Steve nodded again.

“If you need me, you know how to contact me,” he said to Tony. “I’m sorry, Tony. I’ll find Bucky and tell him to stand down, I swear.”

“You do that,” Tony scoffed. He waited until the three of them marched out, Clint patted Tony’s shoulder as he went, before turning to Sirius.

“You’re in charge of finding Bucky,” Tony told him. “I want him caught and I want him locked up.”

Sirius brought two fingers to his forehead then swung them out in a salute. “I’m on it, mate. How’s Harry?”

Tony checked his phone and let out a relieved sigh. “He’s home,” he told Sirius. He looked at Pietro and Bruce and gave them a half-assed smile of gratitude. “If you’re staying here, it means not filling the others in on capturing this guy, got it?”

“Aye, aye, captain,” Pietro drawled before plopping his chin on his hand and closing his eyes.

Bruce looked uncomfortable, but he nodded slowly when Tony turned to him for agreement.

“We work better together,” Bruce said.

Tony scoffed loudly and as disdainfully as he could. “Tell that to the ones keeping a pet assassin, Brucie Bear. Good talk though, glad you kiddies all chose Daddy over Mommy, but now I’ve got my actual son to deal with.”

“Bye, Daddy!” Sirius called cheekily when Tony left. “I’ll bring you a present soon!”

 

Despite the fact that Harry was in a blood-feud with Sirius, Tony was relieved that Sirius put Harry’s safety above a guy he wanted to sleep with.

Not that Tony ever doubted him of course…

 

“Aside from a beetle, at least I can say that Hogwarts never had reporters camping out trying to catch me at lunch,” Harry said when Tony joined him in the living room. Harry had his backpack and jacket tossed on the floor and a bowl of marshmallow cereal on his lap that he was practically inhaling.

Tony took a moment to admire the image before him. Harry looked like any other teenager in the world just then- his shit tossed everywhere, eating a huge bowl of cereal he didn’t ask permission for, and complaining in the self-centered way that teens were so good at.

It was a damn good image.

And Tony was about to ruin it.

“I mean maybe you wouldn’t be harassed right now if you didn’t go around befriending terrorists,” Tony said lightly as he plopped on the couch beside Harry. “Or, you know, sharing your saliva on roofs.”

Harry froze for a moment with his spoon full of marshmallows halfway to his mouth. He glanced at Tony and his eyes were absolutely screaming guilt, but not fear.

So it was still progress.

“Er… listen…” Harry put the spoon back in the bowl and sat the bowl on the coffee table. “I think you’ve got him all wrong, really. Spider-bloke’s not a terrorist, or whatever, he’s brilliant.”

“Yeah?” Tony put a bent arm behind his head, leaning back and getting comfortable. “Why don’t you tell me all about ‘Spider-Bloke’, and I’ll tell you why you’re going to have a body guard for a while.”

“What?” Harry pulled his legs up under himself and turned to face Tony. “Why do I need a bloody bodyguard?”

“You’re being stalked,” Tony said bluntly.

“Oh, Bucky?”

“Kid, what the hell?!” Tony turned so he was resting against the armrest and threw his hands up again. “You knew you were being stalked by some brainwashed assassin with a go-go gadget arm?!”

“Bucky’s an assassin?” Harry asked, looking more puzzled than actually scared.

Sure, Tony yelling had the kid quivering in his Converse, but a brainwashed enhanced assassin trained by HYDRA? Nope, then the kid was just ‘a little confused’.

The worst part was, Tony couldn’t tell if it was a genetic trait he gave him or Lily Potter did.

“Yes,” Tony said slowly, hoping to make an impression. “So when I say, ‘hey, stay away from him’, I mean it.”

“But you said that about Spiderman?”

“And I meant it then too, kid.”

Harry rolled his eyes then glared at Tony through his bangs. “Spider-Man’s not dangerous and neither is Bucky. Bucky’s sick, or something. He needs help.”

“Great, then we’ll find the best prison psychiatrist we can, maybe a Malcolm Crowe but less ghost, okay?”

“Oi!” Harry yelped. “You can’t arrest him! He needs help, not punishment!”

“He’s called the Winter Soldier, Harry,” Tony said, hoping to appeal to that tiny little area of Harry’s brain that processed logic. “He’s enhanced and Nat calls him the ghost. I haven’t had a chance to dig yet, but if he’s been around as long as Steve, who knows who all he’s targeted?”

Harry didn’t look convinced at all, he just looked sympathetic as if the assassin stalking him was a little kicked puppy who needed treats and head pats.

“No bodyguard,” Harry said. “Spiderman, er… he already scared him off anyway, so it’s fine.”

Tony took an incredibly deep breath and closed his eyes for a moment.

Don’t scream… don’t scream… don’t scream…

“Harry, could you please tell me what you mean?” Tony asked slowly and patiently.

“Sure, I’m going to finish my cereal first though.”

And Tony was going to get more coffee. Lots and lots of coffee.

 

Once Harry was finished with his thrilling tale about hanging out with terrorists and assassins, Tony had to call it quits on coffee and go straight for a neat glass of scotch to ease his headache.

“Awesome… awesome…” Tony sighed, throwing the drink back in one motion. “What’s your dashing darling’s name?”

Harry blinked at him. “No idea.”

“Harry! We don’t kiss strangers!” Tony said, like a filthy hypocrite. A hypocrite whose son wasn’t buying it.

“You remember every person you kissed?” Harry scoffed.

“What if he’s got herpes?”

“Herpes??” Harry laughed and relaxed on his side of the couch. “He doesn’t have herpes.”

“How old is he?” Tony asked instead.

“Nineteen.”

“Harry!” Tony groaned and snatched the bottle off the coffee table, clearly there wasn’t enough scotch in the world either. “You’re fifteen!”

Harry shrugged with all of Tony’s own careless arrogance. “He’s fit and we’re friends.”

“Can you get him here to talk?” Tony asked, changing tactics quickly. “You know, meet your father, it’s an important step in any disturbing relationship with a domestic terrorist.”

Harry laughed and grabbed his empty bowl while he gave Tony a condescending smirk.

“I know my grades are bullshit, but I’m not an idiot. I bring him here and you try and lock him up with Bucky, right?” Harry shook his head down at Tony. “You wanna arrest Gwen too? Take all my friends in a single go?”

Tony twisted around on the couch to continue the conversation while Harry went to wash his bowl. “Did Gwen start her own vigilante system? Maybe kill a few people?”

“Maybe,” Harry called back to him. “I’m not a narcotic though.”

Tony fought the urge to laugh at his kid. “Narc, Harry, you’re not a narc.”

Harry put his dishes in the strainer and walked back with a frown on his lips. “Isn’t narc short for narcotic?”

Tony laughed and closed his eyes while he tried to sort through the mess that never seemed to get any cleaner.

“No, it’s not,” he told Harry. He pulled his phone out and waved his thumbs over the screen, thinking it through quickly before he messaged Pepper.

As far as anyone knows, the arachnid is part of the Avengers. And I want the face of the guy behind the truck on every news channel in every country with a 500k reward for capture.

“No more hanging out with terrorists and killers,” Tony told Harry firmly. “Got it?”

Harry hummed and smiled sweetly, a face full of lies. “Of course.”

Tony sighed and went ahead and poured himself a third drink.

“Your grandmother once told me she hoped I had a kid half as defiant as I was one day,” Tony told Harry. “You are my karma for every time I told my father to go fuck himself.”

“I’m only half as bad as you were?” Harry asked. He clicked his tongue. “I can try harder.”

Tony eyed his son with almost as much amusement as he did exhaustion. Harry had a little mischievous sparkle in his eyes and a cocky smirk on his lips.

“I didn’t date a terrorist until I was seventeen, and even then I didn’t know about it,” Tony said, grinning himself then.

“So I’m an overachiever?” Harry asked. “Hermione will be proud of me.”

Tony laughed and then relaxed back, propping his feet on the coffee table and trying to enjoy the moment with his son before he was sure all hell broke loose eventually.

“Excellent.” Tony grabbed the remote and turned on News Seven so he could watch the hacks drag out ‘Stark’s Son Swings with Spiderman’ for as many ratings as they could.

Harry tilted his head at the TV and twisted his lips to the side thoughtfully. “They’re not very original, are they?”

Tony raised his glass in the air. “That’s what I said.” He pulled up the photo of Harry and the pain in his ass vigilante on his phone and flashed it at Harry. “I think this photo could be captioned with ‘Swapping Spit with Spiders: a Stark Son Story’.”

Harry laughed while he looked at the incriminating photo. “How much do you think a reporter would pay for that photo? Peter used to sell celebrity shots to magazines and Spider-Bloke’s a bit famous now, isn’t he?”

Tony snorted at his kid finally picking up the Stark entrepreneurial spirit. “I’ll pay you double to not give it out,” he offered.

“Ten dollars and you send me the picture,” Harry said swiftly with a charming smile. “Then I won’t sell our love story to the magazines.”

Tony looked and saw that Harry was perfectly serious, which sent him in a hysterical fit of laughter because clearly his son - defender of assassins, lover of terrorists - had driven him completely insane.

“Okay, kid, you’ve got yourself a deal.”

Chapter Text

“And I don’t even know what a terrorist is, but I know it’s not Spider-Bloke! He’s a good listener and I feel like I can tell him anything, you know? Sort of like I’m supposed to do with you. Except now it’s suddenly all ‘oh, Harry, don’t hang out with anyone who I don’t like, no you can’t be nice to a sick bloke just because he killed someone’, even though Tony did all those things too! Look at Psycho, they’re best mates! Or, they were, but now she’s trying to help Bucky and he can’t see that! PLUS Tony calls her and Clint assassins, but they can hang around and shake the hell out of me and Bucky can’t even walk down the fucking sidewalk? It’s bullshit!”

Harry’s ‘therapist’, a quiet older bloke named Michael, hummed and nodded behind his desk, watching while Harry paced his office and ranted.

“Why do you think that Bucky is a ‘sick bloke’ instead of a dangerous assassin as your father said?” he asked Harry calmly.

Harry threw his hands up and kept pacing from bookcase to door, over and over. “Why can’t he be both? They said he was brainwashed, which is like the imperio curse, right?”

“What’s the imperio curse?” Michael asked Harry curiously.

It was almost funny, talking magic with a muggle inside a posh office decorated with degrees and heavy books on shelves. Harry didn’t think he’d like ‘Michael Morris’ much, but then Tony had him sign an entire bloody stack of papers with ‘confidentiality clauses’. Then suddenly Harry had a therapist who knew about magic, but only because he thought Harry was an ‘enhanced individual’ who went to a school for other ‘enhanced individuals’.

It helped some that there was plenty of video footage of Sirius and Wanda using magic on all the different news channels, so calling them all ‘enhanced’ didn’t mean that much for the Statue of Secrecy.

As soon as Harry was free to speak freely, it was like a damn burst and Harry started telling the muggle his entire life story.

And now Harry had some middle aged bloke with a bald head and glasses listening to Harry talk every week, but sometimes he had decent advice.

“The imperio is a spell that controls a persons mind,” Harry told Michael while he kept pacing. “And I looked up brainwashing, it’s like being under the imperio, and HYDRA sounds like the death eaters, so it’s like Bucky was imperio’d by death eaters and nobody wants to help him, they just want to throw him in jail!”

“I think it takes a great deal of compassion on your part to see Bucky as a victim rather than a perpetrator.”

Harry scoffed irritably, feeling like Michael was missing the entire point.

“Bucky’s face is all over the news,” Harry said, pointing a finger at the blank telly hanging on the wall in the corner. “What’s the point of having a dad if he won’t listen to me and a godfather who’s leading the charge against my friend?”

Michael nodded again - he was a big fan of nodding - and wrote something down in the notebook Harry pretended didn’t exist. If Harry knew there was a notebook filled with notes about him, then he’d be annoyed and everything would be ruined, so it was better if Harry just pretended it wasn’t there.

“Are you more concerned with Bucky being controlled against his will or that you feel as if your voice isn’t being heard?” Michael asked.

Harry paused in his pacing to shoot a long look at Michael while he played with the question in his head. If Harry was only concerned with the first part, then he was an idiot. If Harry was only worried about the second part, then he was a piece of shit.

“Both,” Harry finally said confidently. He moved to sit in the comfortable black leather chair across from Michael’s chair and grabbed one of the spinning things off his desk to toy with while they talked. Harry pinched the silver circle with his thumb and middle finger and used his index finger to spin the red blades around and around.

“Throwing Bucky in jail for things he did brainwashed would be like throwing me in Azkaban if someone imperio’d me to kill someone else,” Harry said. “And why shouldn’t I get a say in what happens with Bucky and Spider-Bloke? They’re my friends.”

Michael smiled slightly as he smoothed down his sparse grey mustache. “Do you want my opinion or are you using this time to get all your thoughts out?”

Harry stared deadpan at Michael while he kept spinning the little gadget. “What are you getting paid for?”

“Some of both,” Michael said with an agreeable nod of his head. He adjusted his wire-framed glasses and thought for a moment. “I believe that you have spent so long as an independent party- one who was pushed in dangerous situations and treated as an adult in those situations, that it is currently inconceivable to you to have an adult watching for your best interests and laying down boundaries for you.”

“I’ve always had boundaries,” Harry sneered. “‘Stay in the cupboard, don’t speak, pretend you don’t exist’.”

“Those were not reasonable boundaries, those were ways that you were abused,” Michael said, instantly pissing Harry off.

Abuse was… was something sick and shameful and made Harry feel like his boiling blood was cooled with freezing cold ice water.

Harry’s finger moved even quicker, spinning the dumb thing around as quick as he could. “I wasn’t abused,” he said as calmly as he could. “Quit saying that.”

“Alright,” Michael agreed easily, as he always did when Harry shut down certain topics. “Let’s look at other boundaries you had. You were at your school for enhanced students, correct? Now, tell me, what did you do when you were told to stay out of the wing of the school that had the Cerberus in it?”

Harry almost smiled to hear a muggle talking about Fluffy. He only didn’t, because he was scowling.

“That’s different,” Harry insisted. “I know what you’re going to say, that I can’t follow rules, right? But I can when they make sense.”

“Excellent.” Michael made a note on the invisible notebook and then put his templed fingers to his chin while he watched Harry. “Name me some.”

Harry blinked at him incredulously, surely he was kidding.

“You want me to name every rule I’ve ever followed?” Harry asked.

“No,” Michael chuckled quietly. “That would be rather pointless to have you list every time you never jaywalked. What I mean is for you to think back on all the times you were specifically told a directive - whether for or against something - and you followed it.”

“I—” Harry opened his mouth and then snapped his mouth shut. “Once—” No, not that either…

“Give me a minute,” Harry grumbled to Michael.

‘Don’t take your broomstick off the ground…’

‘Don’t go in the third floor corridor…’

‘Don’t be out after curfew or smuggle illegal dragons…’

‘Don’t tell anyone you’re a Parslemouth…’

‘Don’t go in the Chamber…’

‘Don’t sneak in Hogsmeade…’

‘Don’t confront Sirius Black…’

“Aha!” Harry punched a fist in the air victoriously. “Alright, Dumbledore sort of told me to use the time turner with Hermione to go back in time and save Sirius and Buckbeak!”

“Who is Buckbeak?” Michael asked, flipping through his notebook that didn’t exist.

“A hippogriff.”

“And what’s a hippogriff?”

“Er… so it looks like a half eagle, half horse, thing.”

Michael put the notebook back on his desk and made a quick note before looking up at Harry. “Okay, so when you did follow an order, it was when an adult was depending on you to correct a situation that he found dangerous?”

Harry sighed and glanced at the clock on the desk, mentally rejoicing that he only had fifteen minutes left as he was sure he knew where the conversation was headed.

“Sounds about right,” Harry said tiredly. “I suppose you don’t want me to tell you that I also listened to Moody, the death eater in disguise, when he guided me through the tournament that ended in Cedric dying and Voldemort being reborn?”

Harry had to work especially hard to ignore Michael’s notebook when his pen began flying across it quick enough that smoke should be flowing upward.

“On the contrary, Harry, I would very much like to hear more about that.”

 

By the end of the session, it seemed like Michael was trying to say that Harry was a child who couldn’t follow orders ‘made for his safety’. So… it wasn’t as if the bloke was always perfect.

 

Harry and Tony’s flat was empty and quiet when Harry got back from therapy, and Harry jumped at the chance to take Joey for a walk without being bothered about his safety.

“C’mon, Arsehole,” Harry said quietly, clipping Joey’s leash on him before pulling on his coat. “Let’s go see if we can find our friends, huh, buddy?”

Joey barked loud enough to wake Hedwig up from her perch, earning himself an angry hoot.

“Quick,” Harry said, urging Joey on before Tony got back from whatever was keeping him. Happy always drove Harry from school straight to therapy on Friday’s and normally Tony was home by the time Harry got back, but Harry wasn’t going to complain then.

Just because Harry won the disagreement on him being tailed inside school didn’t mean Harry thought he’d win any other disagreements.

Harry probably looked paranoid when he slipped outside, a bag of supplies over his shoulder, as he shot looks from left to right and behind him to make sure he wasn’t being followed.

If Harry wanted Bucky to not get captured, he needed money and food and probably medicine. Harry just hoped the cash he had saved for an emergency, the cereal and crisps in the cabinet, and a bottle of Tylenol were at least a good place to start.

“How do we find a stalker?” Harry murmured to Joey while they traveled further from the tower. “Do we just say ‘come out, come out, wherever you are’?”

“Depends on who you’re looking for.”

Harry jolted when Spider-Bloke jumped down from a rooftop to do a flip land on his feet just in front of him.

“As happy as I am to see you,” Harry rolled his eyes so Spider-Bloke didn’t think he was entirely serious (even if he was), “I’m actually looking for Bucky today.”

“Why, why, are you going looking for the wanted assassin?” Spider-Bloke asked Harry as he fell in step beside Harry.

Harry wasn’t sure where Bucky would be, but he was hoping to find him somehow. He used to reliably be hanging around wherever Harry was, but it seemed like Spider-Bloke scared him off; and the recent news probably didn’t help any either.

“Reward money of course,” Harry said with a smirk. “I’m going to get the money, buy my own fancy jet, and then my team of Anti-Avengers can make their first mission breaking Bucky out of jail.”

Spider-Bloke laughed, and Harry rather liked his laugh. It was cheery and warm, but a bit deep and felt familiar.

“I don’t know that you’ll find a jet for $500,000,” Spider-Bloke told Harry while Harry stuck his head in an alley they were passing, hoping to find Bucky. “And you know, I’d love to join your team of anti-heroes but I saw in the paper this morning that I’m a new recruit for the Avengers.”

Harry straightened up and smiled nervously over at Spider-Bloke. “Really? That sounds terrible. You should quit and join my team.”

The AA was a joke between Harry and Peter, but since Harry hadn’t talked to Peter in weeks, he figured he was sort of off the team… as much as that thought bothered Harry.

“Done,” Spider-Bloke said easily. “Maybe we could make our first mission not looking for dangerous criminals.”

“Hmm…” Harry hummed and pretended to think it over. “Sorry, but I’m actually in charge.” He patted Spider-Bloke on the shoulder and gave him a winning smile. “And Bucky’s not dangerous, he’s sick.”

And why nobody aside from Harry could see that, Harry had no idea.

Every time Harry saw Bucky, he looked like someone terrified of the world and himself. There was something in his eyes that made Harry’s chest ache with sympathy while his blood raced in acknowledgment of the fact that Bucky could be dangerous, but he’d never hurt Harry.

Except for the time he shoved Harry on his arse, but that was hardly Bucky’s fault.

“Sick in the head,” Spider-Bloke muttered.

Harry pretended Spider-Bloke wasn’t being horribly sarcastic. “Exactly, and if other people with messed up heads get help, why not him?”

“Because he’s a murderer?”

Harry huffed and stopped on the sidewalk to glower at Spider-Bloke. “Are you going to help me or are you going to be a prat the whole time? Because I like you, but I’m trying to help him so if you’re not helping me then go away because he won’t come out if you’re hanging around talking shit about him.”

“I’ll stick around, make sure you don’t get killed,” Spider-Bloke said with what seemed like a grin.

It was hard to tell really, with the mask he had on, but Harry was usually decent at judging the moods of people he hung around. Harry really wished Spider-Bloke would just take the mask off, but he figured he was probably shy.

“You should tell me your name,” Harry said as casually as he could while they resumed their walk. “Maybe- maybe your number too? I can’t keep calling you Spider-Bloke and snogging you if I don’t even know your name.”

Spider-Bloke didn’t say anything for a minute, so Harry kept walking with Joey sort of leading him along. New York was rather pretty in the fall- not as good as Hogwarts, but still pretty enough with the sparse trees in the neighborhood changing colors and the lavish fall themed decor on the shops and buildings.

“It’s not that I don’t trust you, it’s that…” Spider-Bloke stopped and grabbed Harry’s hand, holding it between his while he stared down at him, his expression hidden behind the mask. “I don’t want this to get ruined,” he said softly. “And, who knows? Maybe you knowing my secret identity could get you hurt.”

“Maybe me not knowing could get me hurt,” Harry countered with. He grinned a little, “I don’t really like secrets much.”

It wasn’t like Spider-Bloke had a law he had to follow; there was no law saying ‘enhanced humans’ had to keep their identity a secret, not like with wizards and…

Spider-Bloke wasn’t a muggle.

“You’re not a muggle!” Harry cried, suddenly delighted. He momentarily forgot all about Bucky as he realized that if Sirius and Wanda were classified as ‘enhanced humans’ and so was Spider-Bloke, then there was no law saying Harry couldn’t tell him.

If Sirius could be seen on every bloody news channel riding a broomstick and using his wand, then Harry could tell one single ‘enhanced person’ about magic.

“I’ll trade you secrets,” Harry smirked, sure he could get Spider-Bloke’s name. “C’mon, mine’s brilliant, way better than a name. You don’t even have to take your mask off if you don’t want to.”

“Wait, what’s your secret?” Spider-Bloke asked. “You literally tell me everything.”

“Not everything,” Harry taunted him. He looked around the very open sidewalk they were on and pulled Spider-Bloke and Joey both back about half a block until they could duck in an alley.

Harry wondered if he should be concerned about the amount of time he spent in alleys recently, but decided that was a problem for Michael to decipher.

“Quit showing off and tell me your name,” Harry told Spider-Bloke when he began crawling up the wall and doing flips off it.

Spider-Bloke landed in front of Harry and Joey jumped up on him, wagging his tail and begging to be pet, which Spider-Bloke did while he tilted his head curiously at Harry.

“Tell me your secret first,” he said. “If it’s that you think my ass looks great in this suit, I know.”

Harry scowled and kicked a rock toward Spider-Bloke, distracting him from Harry’s red face.

“Nobody’s arse looks great in red and blue spandex,” Harry lied through his teeth. “How do I know you’ll tell me your name if I tell you my secret?”

Spider-Bloke laughed and sat down on the gross ground, loving on Joey while he looked up at Harry. “Trust, I guess. But if your secret isn’t like totally earth shattering then I reserve the right to give you a fake name.”

Harry sat down and crossed his legs on the gross ground as well and considered the new deal.

Magic was earth shattering.

… right?

“Deal,” Harry grinned. He offered his hand to Spider-Bloke for a handshake and instead Spider-Bloke just held it in his while he waited for Harry’s secret.

Harry hesitated, struck by sudden nerves. It was the calm way that Spider-Bloke rubbed his thumb on the back of Harry’s hand that soothed his nerves.

Spider-Bloke was ‘enhanced’. He got bit by a bloody spider and got super powers, he wasn’t in a great position to call Harry a freak.

“Did you see the videos of the Avengers in Sokavia?” Harry hedged, waiting to see what his reaction would be.

Spider-Bloke laughed a little, “I think everyone did.”

“So… so you saw my godfather, right?”

“Sirius? Yeah, the one with the black hair and flying broom? They’re calling him Magic Man.”

Harry snorted; if he ever talked to Sirius again, he was going to take the mickey out of him for such a daft name. Harry didn’t like ‘Black Widow’ but at least she found an original name instead of ‘Iron Man’, ‘Spider-Man’, and ‘Magic Man’.

“Well… I can do the same thing he can. I was born with magic, I’m a wizard,” Harry said in a rush, his stomach twisting and causing him to blurt it all out at once. Harry then stared very hard at his and Spider-Bloke’s entwined hands right next to where Joey plopped his head on Spider-Bloke’s lap and waited for a response.

“You… can… do magic?” Spider-Bloke finally asked, painfully slowly.

Harry nodded. “Your turn,” he said, speaking extra quickly to make up for Spider-Bloke’s stunned and slow speech.

“Are you fucking kidding me? Is that- you’ve got some sort of abilities? Is that why you don’t know freaking algebra?!”

Spider-Bloke moved from the ground against the wall behind himself in one move so quick that Harry nearly couldn’t see it. One second, Harry thought everything would be fine, the next it looked like he’d fucked everything up again.

“I…” Harry blinked and swallowed hard. “Wait… who told you I don’t know algebra?”

That wasn’t something Harry told Spider-Bloke, he was fairly certain of it. Harry hadn’t wanted to seem like an idiot, so he didn’t talk much about his classes with him.

And if the news was reporting on Harry’s grades then Harry would probably be alone and friendless for the rest of his life.

Spider-Bloke reached up quickly and grabbed the bottom of his mask, causing Harry’s breath to catch, then—

“PETER?!”

Harry jumped to his feet then and snatched Joey’s leash off the ground when it wasn’t some nineteen year old fit bloke beneath the mask, it was someone Harry trusted and liked up until he screamed at Harry and started being a dick.

“YOUVE BEEN LETTING ME TALK ABOUT YOU TO YOU?!” Harry screamed as the blood drained from his face quicker than ever before. “WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?!”

How could he?

How the fuck could he?

“I trusted you… twice,” Harry said in a soft and furious voice. “Twice, Peter, TWICE I TRUSTED YOU! You arrogant, self-centered, lying—”

“Oh I’m the only liar here?!” Peter laughed harshly and flung his mask at the wall a few feet to the left of where Harry stood. “YOU HAVE FREAKING MAGIC, HARRY! And you never told me, nooo, BUT YOU’LL TELL SPIDER-MAN?”

“SPIDER-MAN IS A STUPID FUCKING NAME!” Harry shouted. “I DON’T KNOW HOW YOU TRICKED ME INTO THINKING YOU’RE SOMEONE YOU CLEARLY AREN’T, TWICE, BUT BRAVO!”

“Get off the freaking cross, Harry!” Peter scoffed. “I didn’t think I fell in love with some MAGICAL FUCKING WIZARD!”

Harry staggered backward, accidentally tripping over Joey’s leash and nearly falling, as the air was knocked from his lungs and he gaped at Peter.

“You…” Harry didn’t even know what to say. “You’re mad,” he said hoarsely, blindly backing down the alley as he tried to blink back frustrated tears. “You don’t love me.”

“God damn it,” Peter growled. He pulled at his hair and looked upward, spinning in a quick and agitated circle. “Yes I do,” he said, stopping to watch Harry leave. “Please, Harry, let’s just talk, okay? We both fucked up, we both kept secrets. Can we just talk like normal people? Please, please, Harry?”

“Every time you talk you lie to me,” Harry said. He swallowed hard, “Every time.”

Sirius loved Harry, even when he refused to quit the team, Harry knew he loved him.

Tony loved Harry… which was odd, but nice. But Tony was Harry’s dad he didn’t have to love him, but Harry assumed it made dealing with him much easier.

And that was it.

Those were the people that loved Harry.

“You are a FUCKING LIAR!” Harry shouted once more before turning around and pulling Joey along so they could sprint back home.

Harry heard Peter scream once behind him, but Harry pretended he also didn’t exist.

No notebook.

No Peter.

Easy.

It didn’t even hurt.

Chapter Text

Monday, October 22

“Kid, hey…” Tony flicked Harry’s light on and frowned at the lump on the bed. Usually Harry was up and ready, if not before Tony, then typically around the same time at least.

“You’ve got school,” Tony reminded him. “Remember? That magical place with a little less actual magic and more math?”

“‘M still sick,” Harry mumbled from beneath the blanket, barely loud enough to be heard over the emo-crap music he was listening to.

“Okay… I’ll call Dr Avery? See if he’ll make a house call?” Tony offered, wildly out of his depth.

For the right price, anyone would make a house call. And since Harry had been too sick to even take the dog out since Friday night, Tony didn’t think it would be dramatic to bribe the doctor to come to the tower.

Tony offered Harry soup and Sudafed all weekend, but the kid said he just needed sleep. Rhodey laughed when Tony called him about it and teased him for being a ‘worried mother hen’, but Harry went to school when he was nauseous and shaking from his medicine, so Tony figured Harry might now be at a ‘let’s go to the emergency room’ level of sick.

Or, at a minimum, a ‘let’s get your pediatrician here to look you over’ level of sick.

“I don’t need a doctor,” Harry mumbled, still buried under the blanket. “I just… I’ll be fine.”

Tony rubbed his jaw for a moment, debating with himself. He hadn’t actually seen Harry get out of bed once all weekend, aside from a couple trips to the bathroom, and Tony had basically set up shop on the couch where he could check on Harry regularly.

“Do you have a fever?” Tony asked hesitantly. Tony had two masters degrees, three doctorates, and no clue whatsoever how to treat a sick kid. Soup and Sudafed had been a hell of a lot more than anyone offered Tony when he’d gotten sick as a child.

“No.”

Maybe Harry didn’t know how to tell if he had a fever?

“Can I check?”

“No.”

“Are you nauseous?”

“No.”

Tony took a deep breath and counted to ten really slowly before continuing.

“Do you have a headache?”

“No.”

“Then you’re not sick!” Tony said, throwing his hands up in complete exasperation. Sure, kids were like little germ factories, but usually every illness came with at least one of those symptoms.

Harry tossed the blanket off his head and stared balefully at Tony while he coughed twice.

“See? Sick.”

“Then I’m calling the doctor,” Tony warned him when Harry pulled the blanket back over his head and burrowed down in a stubborn lump. “Come take your medicine, kid.”

Harry growled - his kid literally growled at him, like a freaking dog - but Tony heard his quiet footsteps following him to the kitchen.

So he was a feral dog, but obedient.

“Woah, not so fast,” Tony stopped Harry after he took his pill without any water or anything. Harry turned and had his glare on full blast, but Tony ignored it to look the kid over.

He wasn’t extra pale, or flushed, or bright red with a fever. His eyes weren’t glassy or bloodshot. Harry looked tired, but that was it.

“I need some symptoms if we’re playing hooky,” Tony told Harry lightly. “If not, Pepper’s going to storm up here and rip us both a new one and I personally don’t feel like dealing with that today.”

Tony was ninety-five percent certain that Pepper got Harry’s attendance record sent directly to her phone and her finding out Harry was sick from the receptionist at Midtown wouldn’t go over great.

“I have a cough,” Harry snapped. “See?”

It was really hard not to laugh when Harry coughed again, this one just as fake as the earlier ones.

“Right,” Tony nodded solemnly. “So aside from the fake cough, what’s the symptoms?”

Harry glared at Tony, Tony leaned against the counter and waited.

Harry’s glare deepened, Tony took a sip of coffee.

“I’m not going to school,” Harry finally said. “Goodnight.”

“It’s seven am!” Tony yelled when Harry turned around and went straight to him room. “I’M CALLING PEPPER!” he yelled after Harry just shrugged and shut his door.

“‘I wish he was more like a normal teenager’,” Tony mocked himself while he snatched his phone off the counter. “‘Why isn’t Harry messy or loud or EATING ALL THE GOOD CEREAL?!’”

Tony couldn’t quite hear what Harry yelled, but it sounded a lot like ‘piss off’.

Normal teenage boy, fun.

“Tony, I haven’t even made it to the office yet, what have you already done?” Pepper asked briskly when she answered Tony’s call on the first ring.

“You know the other good-looking Stark that lives here? The slightly shorter one?” Tony moved to sit on the couch, opening his laptop while he held the phone between his ear and shoulder. “Well he’s sick so he’s not going to school.”

“Harry’s sick?” Pepper asked, suddenly much more concerned. “What’s wrong with him?”

“Hormones, I think,” Tony said idly while he pulled up the research he had been working all weekend on the Winter Soldier.

“Plain English, Tony, what’s wrong with Harry?”

Tony tapped the screen a little harder than needed, frustrated in his inability to dig up anything recent or concrete on James ‘Bucky’ Barnes.

“I have no idea,” Tony told her. “He laid in bed all weekend saying he was sick, but today I said I’m calling the doctor and suddenly he doesn’t have any symptoms.”

“So he was sick and now he’s better? If he’s symptom free for twenty-four hours he can go to school,” Pepper said. “Unless- God damn, it’s green! MOVE!”

Tony grinned in the phone, poor Pep had the worst road rage in the morning rush hour.

“You know if you’d move in here full-time, preferably in my bedroom, you wouldn’t have to drive to work every day,” Tony reminded her.

“And if you’d use common sense you didn’t need to interrupt my Dolly and Dunkin’s time,” Pepper said sweetly. “If Harry’s been sick all weekend and still sick, call his doctor. If he’s not sick, send him to school.”

“Yeah… about that… can you come send him to school?” Tony asked hopefully. “I told him that it was the doctor or school and he said ‘goodnight’.”

“You did not seriously call me to come parent on your behalf,” Pepper asked, as if that were somehow surprising. “Tony, come on, go in there and be his parent. He’s comfortable with you now and he’s just pushing boundaries.”

“I don’t want to fight with him,” Tony whined quietly. “It’s been so good lately before the damn vigilante romance and assassin bestie.”

“Ooh, poor Tony,” Pepper whined right back. “Welcome to parenthood.”

“Pep…”

“For the love of God, Tony,” Pepper sighed irritably. “He will forgive you. He will not hate you for being the parent. And yes, you have to be the adult here. Time to grow up.”

Tony’s jaw dropped when Pepper actually hung up on him right in the middle of a Harry-emergency.

Some future stepmom she was.

Tony gave his computer a longing look - technology was so simple. Tony knew exactly what buttons to press to get the results he wanted - before heaving himself off the couch to go ‘be the adult’.

“Knock, knock,” Tony said brightly, pushing open Harry’s door. “Listen, I was fine with hooky, but Pepper said you have to either go to the doctor or go to school. Sorry, kid, I—”

Oh.

Harry wasn’t in his bed.

Tony heard the shower running in his bathroom, which hopefully meant Harry was planning on going to school. With nothing else to do at the moment, Tony plopped down on the foot of Harry’s bed and admired the chaotic mess of a bedroom while he waited.

There were owl feathers and what looked like the beginning of a nest in one corner of the room. The closet door was open and there were a couple of hoodies and shirts on the floor that the dog was sleeping on top of. There were books spread across his desk along with his laptop open - clearly he didn’t plan on going to school that morning when he went to bed the night before.

Tony liked seeing his son make his room as messy as Tony’s lab was. It meant Harry was all settled in, comfortable, and not worried that Tony was going to kick his ass for making a mess.

The mess meant Harry trusted him, at least some.

Plus, things that were too clean made Tony itch…

 

Tony had a whole speech planned in his head-

He’d talk about how important education was if Harry ever wanted to work for a living. When that failed, because it definitely would, Tony would remind Harry that kids at school would be more interesting than hanging out with him all day. And then when that probably failed, Tony would turn to bribes.

Teenagers loved bribes.

And then Harry stepped out of the bathroom with a pair of baggy basketball shorts, a white tshirt, soaking wet hair, and skin that looked like it had been burned.

“Jesus Christ!” Tony jumped up and rushed to Harry too quickly, causing him to flinch back, and then a little more tactfully reached for Harry’s wrist to judge the burn.

“Are you actually sick?” Tony asked. Harry burning head to toe from a fever made a lot more sense than the kid silently scalding himself in the shower.

“I’m fine,” Harry said harshly, ripping his arm away from Tony. He sidestepped Tony, making a beeline for his desk.

Tony watched, actually stunned to silence, while Harry sat down at his desk like his skin wasn’t glowing.

There was something familiar in the tick of Harry’s jaw, the way he clenched and unclenched his fingers in a tight roll, and how he avoided meeting Tony’s eyes.

 

For a genius, it took Tony an embarrassing amount of time to realize that Harry’s mystery sickness was coming from his head, not body. Which was exceedingly stupid of Tony considering Harry clearly inherited more than just his good looks, poor kid got his moodiness too.

 

Since Harry was sitting at his desk, Tony sat back down on the edge of his bed and studied his son thoughtfully. Harry was still glaring mutely at his desk, but some of the horrifying red was already fading from his limbs.

“What’s got you down, kid?” Tony asked when the silence became overwhelming and Harry didn’t seem likely to be the first to break it.

Harry flicked his eyes quickly toward Tony then back at his desk.

“Nothing fucking important, apparently,” Harry muttered quietly.

“Listen, as I’m the MIT graduate and you’re the high school student, why don’t you let me decide if it’s important,” Tony said. “I’m no Michael Morris, but I am a lifelong professional in Stark depression.”

He didn’t even get a grin for his efforts, just a slight lessening of Harry’s glare.

“I thought that if I took those pills that I’d be happy,” Harry said with a bite of accusation in his voice. “Or was that a lie?”

Tony rubbed his eyes and sighed. “It’s not foolproof,” he said, trying to sound gentle and not make Harry think an antidepressant was a waste of his time. “It increases the neurotransmitters in your brain which increases the serotonin levels in your body and—”

“I’m not a genius, I’ve got no idea what you’re talking about,” Harry cut in flatly.

“They increase the happy chemicals in your head,” Tony said with a shrug. “But that doesn’t mean you’re never going to have shitty days where your bed looks like a cozy little cave to hibernate in.”

“Ah.”

God, Tony really wished Sirius wasn’t on Harry’s shit list so he could figure out if Harry was always reticent and quiet when he was feeling down or if Tony needed to check the window locks and hide knives.

“Come on,” Tony said abruptly, making a quick decision. “Let’s go get supplies so we can effectively call in sick today.”

A mental health day was still a worthy excuse to call off and spend the day with his son. Sure, Pepper might bitch, but she did it from a place of love so it was easy to tune out.

Harry kept his face down, but Tony saw him raise an eyebrow in Tony’s own silent ‘I’m asking without asking’ gesture.

“It’s a mental health day,” Tony said excitedly. He jumped off Harry’s bed and went to steal a hoodie under the dog to toss to Harry. “We’ll go get a bunch of junk food, rent some movies, and seriously I don’t know any man alive whose blues can’t be cured by Charlie’s Angels, and if that fails then we’ll just go blow shit up.”

Harry caught the hoodie and slowly pulled it on. “I’m not going to get in the car and you drive me to school?” he asked once his head was poking out.

“Nope. You can even drive.”

It wasn’t a smile, the kid looked too beat down to smile, but the glare lessened to the point where it was nearly nonexistent, so clearly Tony was winning somehow.

 

“We look like children,” Harry said when they were at the closest supermarket an hour later.

The supermarket was usually a thirty minute drive on the two occasions Tony bothered to go himself, but Harry drove like an old man. Tony figured he was worried about hitting more lamp posts, and it wasn’t like Tony was going to encourage his son to drive recklessly, so the drive took longer than usual.

Not that Tony minded, he liked watching Harry drive. The kid was hysterical with his hands clenched on the wheel and his tongue poking out between his teeth. One day, Harry would drive as easily as he breathed and Tony would be running out of things to teach him, so it was nice while it lasted.

“We’re too tall to be children,” Tony said as he dropped an armload of various bags of chips in the cart Harry was pushing. “Okay, we’ve got pop, chips, candy, frozen pizza, what else? Oh! Ice cream!”

Harry looked like an exasperated parent while he pushed the cart back to the freezer section.

“I can push,” Tony offered.

Harry shrugged him off. “I don’t mind.”

When they passed the cereal aisle, Harry slowed down and Tony laughed before grabbing a couple boxes of stuff Harry liked.

“Okay- pick a tub any tub!” Tony declared when they made it back to the ice cream section.

Tony went straight for the gallon of brownie batter chocolate fudge and Harry looked them all over before choosing a chocolate and raspberry swirl flavor.

“Anything else?” Tony asked once he was sure they had all the necessary crap for a lazy day together. When Harry shook his head, Tony led them to the register.

 

“We spent more on junk food than some people do on a mortgage,” Harry said when they made it back to the tower and began carrying their bags up to their place.

“We make a hell of a lot more in a month than most mortgages cost too,” Tony pointed out. “I think the new janitor on night shift makes triple what we paid.”

Harry blinked at Tony and then rolled his eyes. Tony heard him mumbling under his breath about ‘cupboards’ and ‘Gringotts’ while they put away their frozen treasures and dumped the rest of it in the living room.

Tony kicked back on the recliner with a bag of chips and a coke while Harry sat on the couch with a bowl of cereal.

That kid could eat cereal like nothing else.

“Ready to witness the glory of Farrah Fawcett kicking ass?” Tony asked Harry cheerfully. Tony had about fifty things to do aside from watching movies all day, but if Harry was with him, then he wasn’t out hanging with terrorists or assassins and he was safe.

Tony still had finding both ‘Spiderman’ and Barnes as his top priorities, but they really sort of dropped to second priority to hanging out with his kid.

Harry shrugged with a mouthful of marshmallows in his mouth so Tony clicked it on and sent Pepper a quick text-

I was wrong, Harry had a fever. I think he infected me as well. No need to come play nurse, I’ve got it handled.

Tony always worked himself up over nothing; parenting was easy. He didn’t need Pepper or Sirius, he just needed to treat Harry like a mission- take it slow and wing all his decisions.

 

“You pick the next one and I’ll pop the pizzas in,” Tony told Harry, tossing him the remote, when the angels saved the world and looked damn good doing it.

Tony should have renamed the Avenger’s ‘Tony’s Angels’ and fired Bruce and found another Nat back when he had a chance.

“You’ll burn the house down,” Harry scoffed, tossing the remote right back. “I’ll put pizzas in, you pick a movie.”

Easy enough.

“What are you in the mood for?” Tony called while he browsed the options. “Comedy? Romance? Action? Horror?”

“Is there anything where a bloke loses his mind and kills everyone?” Harry drawled back from the kitchen.

There was, actually.

“The Shining it is,” Tony decided. He waited until Harry came back to press play. “What’s got you in the mood for murder?”

Tony didn’t actually expect an answer, but Harry still gave him a one word complete explanation.

“Peter.”

“Are we at the shit talking stage of the breakup?” Tony asked while the opening credits played on the TV.

Harry definitely sounded interested when he answered. “If I said yes, what would you say?”

“His hair is a disaster,” Tony said immediately. “And that skater chic style he’s got going on? It’s called grunge and the nineties did it better. His whole ‘I’m a sarcastic loner’ vibe? That only works when you do it, he doesn’t have the snark to really get through it.”

“And he’s a liar,” Harry added bitterly.

“And he’s a liar!” Tony cried dramatically. “A dirty, filthy, liar!”

When Harry laughed, Tony considered it another win.

 

Tony waited until the pizzas were done and they were eating and watching the movie to ask the question he was dyiiiing to ask.

“So what did that filthy and horrible liar actually lie about?” Tony asked super casually.

Harry took an overly aggressive bite of his pizza and Tony patiently waited to see if he’d tell him or give him a charming British curse.

“He said he loves me,” Harry said flatly.

Tony’s brows rose, but he kept his eyes on the TV to keep the pressure off Harry. Apparently geek boy was more attached to Tony’s son than he expected.

“Yeah?” Tony asked. “And what did lover boy lie about?”

Harry paused the movie just as Wendy went to knock Jack out with the bat and turned on the couch to face Tony.

“Peter told me he loved me,” Harry repeated. “That was what he lied about.”

When the punchline didn’t come, Tony just stared at Harry with a puzzled expression.

“He’s obsessed with you,” Tony said slowly. “He’s an idiot and I hate him, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t love you.”

Or whatever passes for teenager emotions anyway. Tony hadn’t believed his first girlfriend that pulled the ‘L’ word on him after sex, but that was different.

It was different because… well, Tony wasn’t someone that people fell in love with. Hell, his own father had—

“Oh, for the love of God,” Tony groaned. He grabbed the remote off the coffee table and clicked the TV off. This was not Tony’s department of expertise this was… this was a problem for the overpaid therapist on his payroll.

There was no shame in admitting when someone was dramatically out of their area of expertise.

“Why’d you turn it off?” Harry asked warily. He put his pizza down and eyed Tony like Tony was a dentist with a pair of pliers coming straight for his mouth.

Bribes.

Teenagers loved bribes.

“What’s it going to cost to get you to go see Morris?” Tony asked, suddenly all business. “I’m willing to negotiate here.”

Harry’s eyes narrowed and Tony could practically see the wheels turning in his head. Then Harry asked the last thing Tony expected, which he seemed to be doing a lot lately.

“Can I invite Hermione and Ron here for Christmas break?”

That was so easy it seemed like a trap. Tony wondered if Harry had any idea how desperately he didn’t want to get involved in the sticky mental space he and his son seemed to share.

Talking about Harry’s issues felt uncomfortably like talking about Tony’s issues and Tony actually liked living in denial, it was incredibly comfortable.

Denial was a California king sized bed with feather pillows and Egyptian cotton sheets and naked models covered in chocolate begging Tony to lick them clean.

Tony liked it there; he thrived there really.

“Do you swear to keep Hermione from touching all the things in my lab?” Tony asked, he didn’t forget how the know-it-all girl had stared at him at Hogwarts.

“I can try,” Harry stressed earnestly. “But she gets a bit mad about knowledge and stuff.”

“Is that all you want?” Tony asked, looking for the loophole. “Just to bring your friends here over break?”

Harry bit his lower lip for a moment. “Can I convince you to leave Bucky alone?”

“Not even a little bit,” Tony said firmly. Yeah, maybe he didn’t care so much about Harry skipping school or bringing over guests from his school, but he did have some rules.

And not associating with dangerous criminals was right up top.

“Joey needs a friend.”

“You have an owl.”

“Can I drive to Michael’s office?”

“Absolutely.”

Harry twisted his lips to the side and tapped his leg with his finger for a moment, apparently looking to get the most from the deal.

“You’ll send your jet to go get Hermione and Ron?” he asked.

Tony scoffed, as if he could buy them tickets on a traditional airline since he doubted if Ronald Weasley - a legal nobody - had any sort of passport.

“Yep. Do you need this in writing or is my word good enough?” Tony held his hand out to Harry, a nicety he never bothered with in actual business deals.

“I would have gone anyway,” Harry said as he quickly shook Tony’s hand. “I like Michael, he’s a decent bloke.”

 

A ‘decent bloke’ that charged Tony triple rate to squeeze Harry in that afternoon.

Overpriced quack, in Tony’s opinion.

Chapter Text

“You are so unfocused that it’s almost like you don’t want to be here.”

Harry huffed but kept his eyes closed as he worked on clearing his mind and channeling his magic. “It’s been a weird day,” he murmured to Strange. “I’m sorry.”

Harry had gotten back from seeing Michael just to find Strange waiting in the lobby of Stark Tower for his tutoring session he didn’t actually want to do.

Therapy was actually overwhelming sometimes and that one had been especially overwhelming.

 

“Why do you find yourself unworthy of love?”

“I’m not ‘unworthy’, it’s just… I- he doesn’t really love me.”

“It makes more sense to you to believe he’s lying than he loves you.”

“People lie to me a lot more than they love me.”

 

Pepper had been right all along, talking to Michael did usually make Harry feel better, like he had someone to help him untangle all the wires in his head, but he just felt off after that talk.

“No need to apologize,” Strange said calmly. They were sitting across from each other on Harry’s bedroom floor again, the same place they usually worked, and Harry had been hoping to have more progress to show.

“Do you feel like trying to bring your magic to life or would you prefer to wait?” Strange asked after another few minutes.

Harry inhaled slowly and held it before breathing it out and trying to ‘connect with himself’.

“Do I say anything?” Harry asked when he felt as calm and ‘connected’ as he could.

“Do what feels natural,” Strange said.

Harry nodded and kept his eyes closed, willing everything inside of him to work.

“Lumos,” Harry whispered, holding one hand out. He felt a spark in his hands, but he was scared to look.

“Excellent!” Strange said. Harry peeked an eye open and saw that there was light radiating from his palm, just like if it was his wand.

“I did it!” Harry cried. He was so excited to see actual wandless magic in the palm of his hand that he stopped concentrating and it disappeared, but it had been there!

“You did,” Strange agreed. He stood up and stretched his arms out above his head. “You’ve made quick progress. Why don’t you keep working on that, see if you can make it happen silently, and we’ll pick things up next week?”

Harry was so giddy that he nearly hugged Strange, something he’d never ever thought about doing to any teacher he had before.

“Thank you,” Harry said earnestly. He patted his pockets down, desperate to call Hermione and Ron. “I dunno what my dad’s paying you, but it’s not enough.”

“I’ll tell him you said so,” Strange smirked. “I’ll see you next week, Harry. And, hey, for what’s it worth, you should go outside and go for a walk or something. Exercise is a good way to generate serotonin.”

Actually, Harry thought that fucking wandless magic was the best way to generate the ‘happiness chemical’ in his head.

But sure.

“Yes, sir,” Harry grinned. He found his phone and quickly whistled for Joey. “I’ll take Arsehole for a walk and you should go ask for a bonus.”

“I’ll do that,” Strange said. He opened the door and gestured for Harry to lead the way. “You know it’s about forty degrees outside, right?” When Harry blinked at him, thinking that was rather hot for October, Strange sighed. “Around four degrees, in British terms.”

“Oh.” Harry grabbed his hoodie off the bed and when he saw his bag of supplies for Bucky underneath it, he shot a stealthy look at Strange before slinging it over his shoulder.

Maybe without god damned Peter around, Bucky would show back up.

“Dad’s in his office,” Harry told Strange on his way out with Joey. “Will you tell him I’ll be back later? Thanks!”

Harry waved once more to Strange, still thinking about that glowing light in the palm of his hand, and had Hermione on his phone before he made it to the front sidewalk.

“Harry! Oh, you look sad,” Hermione said, her smile falling immediately.

“What? No!” Harry was sort of becoming a professional at walking Joey while talking to Hermione. “Hermione, listen, guess what I—”

“Harry!” Ron shoved Hermione over and stole the phone, beaming. “Oh,” Ron quickly stopped beaming. “Mate, what’s wrong?”

“I am happy,” Harry insisted, focusing only on the magic he made. “Listen to what I did to—”

Hermione’s face smushed next to Ron’s and she lowered her voice to a dramatic whisper. “Are you still taking your medicine?”

“SHUT UP AND LISTEN!” Harry yelled. A man walking in front of Harry jumped and turned around, looking at Harry as if he were a crazy person, which… maybe Harry was.

“No need to scream,” Ron huffed. “Just tell us.”

Harry rolled his eyes. “That’s what I was trying to do. So, listen, today during tutoring I fin—”

“Hey.”

This time it was Harry who jumped and turned around, finally seeing the person he’d spent forever searching for.

“Got to go,” Harry told Ron and Hermione hastily. “I’ll call you later, bye!”

Just as they ignored Harry’s not sadness, Harry ignored their complaints before he hung up on them.

“Hey, I’ve been looking for you,” Harry told Bucky. Bucky had on the same jeans and dark jacket as usual, but he traded his ball cap for a beanie and sunglasses.

Bucky backed up and looked around quickly, bloody paranoid he was.

“Seems like a lot of people are,” Bucky said evasively. “I should leave and you should go with me.”

“Hold on,” Harry said, not wanting to lose his chance to finally talk to Bucky without anyone else interfering. Harry looked around until he saw an empty doorway a block down for a bakery that had been there when Harry first came to New York and closed while he was at Hogwarts.

“Follow me,” Harry told Bucky, leading him to the empty store. “Don’t be a coward, mate,” Harry snapped when Bucky hesitated. “I’m on your side, alright?”

Bucky finally nodded and followed behind Harry while Joey led the way.

“Er… you mind?” Harry whispered, nodding to the door when he couldn’t open it even after throwing his shoulder into it. Harry’s ability to do magic and not get arrested was limited to Stark Tower, he doubted if the President would cut him any slack for using his wand to break in an abandoned building.

Bucky grinned just a little before grabbing the door with his silver hand and opened it like it was nothing.

That… that was probably what made Sirius bring him home with him.

“Nice place,” Bucky said drily after he stepped in the store. It was dusty and smelled like mold, and for some reason it made Harry want to cry.

“It used to be,” Harry said, looking around sadly. “They used to sell cookies with dumb shit wrote on them like ‘good vibes only’ and they made cakes out of cookies… I almost bought one once.”

“Why didn’t you?” Bucky asked as he walked up to the counter and ran his hand over the dust coating the empty glass display case.

“It said ‘a smile a day keeps the doctor away’,” Harry told him. He made sure the door was shut before unclipping Joey’s lead and letting him run wild in the store.

Bucky sat on the counter, prompting Harry to sit at the dusty red table in front of the register, and laughed quietly.

“What? You didn’t buy the cake because you didn’t like the message on it?” Bucky asked him.

Harry stared at him with a quirked eyebrow. “Would you?”

“Yeah, probably,” Bucky said thoughtfully. He took his sunglasses off and toyed with them while he spoke. “I mean life’s short, you know? And it fucking sucks most of the time, so why not buy a cake even with a stupid ass message on it? I’d buy it, swipe my fingers through the icing, then eat it.”

Harry shrugged and pulled his bag off his back. “If they ever open this place back up, maybe I’ll buy their cake. Here,” Harry tossed the bag to Bucky, “this is for you.”

“Decapitated head or bomb?” Bucky asked.

“Dog shite,” Harry said seriously. “Just open it, prick.”

Bucky chuckled again and opened the bag cautiously before he reached in and pulled out a bag of crisps. “Uh… thanks?”

“There’s some cash and other food in there,” Harry explained quickly. “So you can hide out, right? I don’t want you to get arrested or something.”

“They could try,” Bucky sneered. His face flashed for a moment and Harry saw that bit of danger that he could always sense lurking just beneath the skin. “I’m hard to catch.”

“So- so you’ll stick around?” Harry asked hopefully. Harry couldn’t explain it, not even to himself, but there was something about Bucky that had caught Harry’s interest and it hadn’t lessened at all.

Bucky was Sirius- a criminal hiding out from unfair prosecution.

Bucky was Harry- a stranger in a place he didn’t fit in.

And after his recent and temporary stay at Hogwarts, Harry felt like he knew how hunted Bucky was feeling, how closed in. Everyone talked about him and nobody talked to him.

It was probably suffocating.

“I can’t,” Bucky said. He found the envelope of cash Harry stuffed in the bag and immediately stuffed in back in and threw the bag to Harry. “I can’t take your money either.”

“Yes you can,” Harry insisted, throwing the bag right back to Bucky. “I- you can leave and I can’t leave, and I’m trying to get my dad to leave you alone, but—”

“Your dad’s looking for me?” Bucky cut in, narrowing his eyes slightly in a way that made goosebumps pop up on Harry’s arms.

It was a mad thought, but Harry suddenly imagined Bucky standing across from Voldemort—

Peter Pettigrew couldn’t tie Bucky to a tombstone.

Bucky wouldn’t hide behind a persons grave—

“We aren’t playing hide and seek, Harry. You cannot hide from me. Does this mean you are tired of our duel? Does this mean that you would prefer me to finish it now, Harry? Come out, Harry... come out and play, then... it will be quick... it might even be painless… I would not know... I have never died…”

“Harry? HEY!”

Harry jolted off his seat, his hand twitching to his pocket looking for a wand that wasn’t there—

“Where’d you go?”

Harry shook his head and blinked until the soft paws on his knees and the soft and thick voice speaking to him made sense.

“Bucky?” Harry asked. He reached down with shaky fingers to curl them in Joey’s fur, reassuring him he was fine.

Bucky was standing as well, but he was still over by the counter, far enough away that Harry didn’t feel crowded. There was a frown on Bucky’s lips, but a spark of understanding in his eyes.

“Sorry,” Harry mumbled, rather embarrassed. “I, er…”

“I do it too,” Bucky said quietly. “I’ve seen you before when you go away, right? Everything in your head gets jumbled and you don’t know where you are?”

“Yeah,” Harry breathed, nodding as he slowly sat back down. Joey whined and tried to climb up on Harry, but he really was too big to comfortably fit anymore so Harry pet him and tried to explain he was fine.

Joey was a good dog, always there with his big brown eyes when Harry had a rough patch.

“That’s exactly how I feel,” Harry told Bucky. “It’s just… I dunno… it’s…”

“It’s like you’re here one moment and then one little thought carries you off,” Bucky said, wording it exactly right. “I bought a slice of pizza in a bar a few nights ago and suddenly I was twelve, scrounging up change to buy something for Steve to eat because that damn scrawny ass couldn’t afford to miss another meal.”

That was how it always happened to Harry too. Sometimes he would walk past a cemetery and he’d be back there, tied to a headstone, Cedric’s dead body in the distance…

Harry knew that Bucky would get it.

“You don’t mean Steve that wears the star suit and doesn’t like to swear, do you?” Harry asked Bucky.

Bucky grinned and hopped back on the counter. “Yeah. We were best friends. I took care of Steve, watched his back when he was getting picked on, made sure he ate and had blankets when he was sick, and he- he… he was there when things weren’t great at my house.”

Bucky cleared his throat and Harry’s stomach tightened uncomfortably at another similarity between them.

“Then I enlisted and Steve became the world’s first super soldier and now he’s out hunting me down…” Bucky dropped his gaze to his legs. “Crazy how life works, huh?”

“Yeah,” Harry said faintly, “crazy.”

The two of them sat there in a sort of easy silence, something comfortable, like the silences Harry used to share with Hermione or Ron.

“Don’t go,” Harry told Bucky when the sun started to set and Harry knew he had to go home soon. “Please?”

“Kid…” Bucky looked torn and Harry wanted to push him a bit.

“Look- I can’t talk to Sirius anymore and I don’t talk to Peter and I have a therapist and that’s it. Please,” Harry begged, laying all his cards on the table, “please don’t go yet. I can help you, I know I can.”

“You don’t get it!” Bucky hopped up and began pacing the store from counter to door. He knocked his hat off his head and began pulling on his hair. “This place is dangerous. This whole fucking city is dangerous! There’s aliens in the sky and killers in that place you live! New York used to be nice and now it’s different and you’re a kid- you’re just a kid. And if I get you away from here, you’ll be safe. I couldn’t save them- none of them, but I can save you. I can. I can.”

Harry hesitantly got up and approached Bucky when it seemed like he was stuck on a loop of just saying ‘I can’ over and over again.

“Mate? Bucky?” Harry reached out to put his hand on Bucky’s shoulder, calm him down, and was caught off guard when Bucky grabbed Harry’s wrist with his silver hand and wrenched it behind him.

Joey jumped up immediately and began barking as the air flew from Harry’s lungs and he was slammed against the wall.

“Fuck you,” Harry gasped. “You’re in a shitty bakery, Bucky. You’re with me, Harry, in a closed bakery in New York. That barking? That’s my dog, Arsehole, and he’s going to rip a hole in your bloody leg if you don’t let go of me.”

Harry had been bluffing about Joey biting Bucky, but Harry heard Joey growl and then Bucky hissed and then—

Black spots appeared in Harry’s eyes as his arm was yanked upward and the sound of something snapping was barely heard over a high pitched scream.

“Oh… fuck.”

Harry slumped to the ground when the arm holding him against the wall disappeared and Harry’s legs refused to work.

Since his dad pulled him from bed that morning Harry had threw a fit in the shower, crying over something that didn’t matter, which had been a low point. Then he watched movies and ate ice cream, a high point. Harry got to drive three times, another high. He had therapy, a real low—

 

“What is required for people to love you?”

“Sirius is my godfather and Tony’s my dad, so… so I guess being family.”

“Like your aunt and uncle?”

“No. Not like them.”

 

Then Harry accomplished wandless magic, a high point that he hadn’t even gotten to brag about before Harry’s right arm was snapped in a bakery that used to smell like cookies.

A brand new depth of low, but sadly not Harry’s all-time lowest point.

“Joey?” Harry swallowed hard, refusing to cry again. It was a broken arm, he was fine. Joey came to Harry with a snout covered in blood and water pooling in his poor little puppy eyes. Harry clenched his jaw hard, refusing to scream, and only let out a whine when he used his left arm to push on Joey’s firm back to get to his feet.

Bucky was starkly pale, halfway across the room, while Harry stood up.

“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry,” Bucky said frantically. His blue eyes looked terrified and Harry would wave his hand or something, but he had his right arm held up by his left hand and couldn’t.

“Can- can you put Joey’s leash on him?” Harry asked thickly. “I’m- I’ll throw up if I let go of my arm,” he admitted.

Harry already felt dizzy and knowing he had to walk six blocks back to Stark Tower made everything in his stomach want to bubble out and spill on the ground.

Bucky did it so quickly that Harry thought of Pietro. Joey bared his teeth in a snarl when Bucky clipped the lead on him and Harry felt a little bad about the wound on Bucky’s leg, but it wasn’t like he didn’t deserve it just a bit.

“Can you just follow me?” Harry asked him. “Don’t come too close to the tower, but—”

“Harry, I’m so sorry,” Bucky said, interrupting Harry. “I- I- people don’t touch me. They just don’t. And when they do…”

“They’re doing it to hurt you,” Harry said. He met Bucky’s eyes square on. “I get it.”

And Harry did get it, he really did. If Harry had super strength instead of a wand he wasn’t allowed to use, Harry probably would have broken so many people’s arms.

Harry wasn’t mad, he was in pain.

Bucky nodded and tossed Harry’s bag over his shoulder and held on to the leash. “I’m—”

“Don’t apologize, just don’t leave,” Harry said shortly. “And don’t make me fucking speak or I’m going to hurl on you and your jeans already have blood on them.”

Bucky faltered, rocking back and forth on his feet for a minute that seemed to be multiplied by every nerve in Harry’s arm screeching with pain, and then he finally nodded and quickly moved to open the door for Harry.

 

“I won’t leave.”

The three of them were two blocks away from Stark Tower when Bucky said that and Harry looked over at him in surprise.

“Swear?” Harry asked.

Bucky’s scruffy jaw was locked so hard Harry was surprised the muscles weren’t twitching, but he nodded without looking at Harry.

“I won’t let them take us alive,” Bucky said, ruining the moment of victory for Harry.

“You need help, mate,” Harry said defeatedly. He bit his tongue so he could let go of his broken arm to hold his hand out for Bucky to slip the leash on Harry’s wrist.

“I know you said not to apologize, but I’m sorry,” Bucky said. Harry forced himself not to twitch away when Bucky’s silver hand came toward him—

“You should stay away from me, kid,” Bucky said after wiping an embarrassing tear of pain off Harry’s face.

“Make up your mind, do you want to run away together or have me stay away?” Harry joked weakly.

“I don’t know,” Bucky said hoarsely, the truth shining in his eyes clearly. “Some days I don’t know who I am.”

Harry gave him his best attempt at a wry smile. “Join the queue, mate. I usually walk Joey after school, so I’ll see you tomorrow.”

“Tomorrow,” Bucky agreed.

 

As much as Harry didn’t want to talk to Sirius, he wanted to have a cast on a broken arm even less.

 

“Bloody hell, Harry!” Sirius was off his sofa in an instant, his wand in hand, when Harry stepped off the lift in his entrance room.

“What happened?” Sirius asked Harry, zeroing in on Harry’s broken arm. “Kiddo, wha—”

“Broken, can you fix it?” Harry asked pathetically, his ability to fight the pain off had diminished so much that Harry thought he might die.

Or, at a minimum, it made Harry want to beg for death.

“Yeah, yeah,” Sirius said absently. He put his hand on the back of Harry’s neck to guide Harry to the sofa and Harry’s knees shook at the comforting gesture.

As much as Harry was angry at Sirius, he missed his godfather so bloody much.

Sirius’ flat was designed just as Tony’s was, but Harry could see pieces of Sirius all over the place. The broomstick by the window, the books on the kitchen counter, the stack of records on a windowsill, and what…

Ugh.

Harry looked away quickly when he saw what seemed to be a woman’s lacy bra on the corner of the telly mounted on the wall. Since Sirius lived with Thor, who was back in Asgard, Harry had to assume the bra belonged to some woman Sirius brought home recently.

“Sit,” Sirius ordered Harry, gently pushing him down on the posh black leather sofa that looked a lot like Tony’s. “I know this is going to hurt like a bitch, but you have to hold your arm out straight so I can snap the bone back in place.”

Harry whimpered quietly and Joey laid his chin on Harry’s knees while Harry slowly forced himself to stick out his arm.

“I know, I know,” Sirius murmured. He held Harry’s hand with his left so he could hold his wand with the right. “Don’t move, let me just… Brackium Emendo.”

Harry screamed, loud, when there was another sharp and painful snap.

“Done,” Sirius said, stepping forward and hugging Harry tightly so Harry could push his face in Sirius’ abdomen to hide the tears that won in the battle against his willpower.

“Thanks,” Harry said when the initial sharp pain dulled to a throb. Harry barely had to pull back and Sirius instantly let go of him and swished his wand, silently summoning a potion that Harry recognized immediately.

“I accept thanks in the form of explanations on how the hell you broke your arm,” Sirius said after Harry drank the potion and the pain had disappeared entirely. Sirius settled on the sofa beside Harry and propped his socked feet up on his coffee table.

“Skateboarding accident,” Harry lied. Harry bent his head down and kissed the top of Joey’s head, grateful for having such a good pet. Hedwig was more of a ‘nag Harry when he was being a berk’ while Joey was more compassionate really.

“You’re such a shit liar,” Sirius said, sounding fond. “What really happened?”

Harry scowled at Sirius and stood up. “Why? Are you trying to play the hero and find some bad guy to beat up?”

“Merlin, but you can hold a grudge,” Sirius laughed carelessly. He smiled up at Harry and Harry scowled even harder. “Harry, be realistic, do you expect me to not help keep the world safe? You know, James and I were meant to be Hit Wizards and I seem to remember you wanting to be an auror, how is ‘Avenger’ any different?”

“Because I don’t know any dead aurors,” Harry snapped angrily. “You wanted me to be a safe coward and now you’re acting like some fucking hero and out ‘saving the world’,” Harry was glad his arm was healed so he could properly do air quotes, “and I have to sit around wondering if you’re going to die or not.”

“Nice turn of events,” Sirius smirked. “I spent all last year worrying that you were going to die and now—”

“AND I WORRY ABOUT YOU EVERY SECOND!” Harry yelled, fed up. “‘I hope Sirius doesn’t get caught’, ‘I’m worried Sirius isn’t eating’, ‘I’m worried Sirius is depressed’, and now I AM WORRIED YOU WILL GO ON A MISSION AND NEVER COME BACK!” Harry shouted.

Sirius’ cocky little smirk dropped and Harry saw actual grief on his face.

“Harry, I love you more than the world, and it’s why I can’t quit.” Sirius got up and reached for Harry, an offer Harry almost refused before flinging himself in Sirius’ outstretched arms.

“I’m going to find these people stalking you and keep you safe. Then Voldemort. And then if aliens jump from the sky or robots take over, I’m going to deal with those too,” Sirius said softly while he rubbed up and down Harry’s back comfortingly. “If I loved you less, then I’d quit.”

Harry truly hated how much that made sense.

“I did wandless magic today,” Harry mumbled in the hollow place just below Sirius’ collarbone where his face perfectly fit when he hugged his godfather.

“Wandlessly broke your arm, eh?” Sirius laughed and ruffled Harry’s hair. “Idiot.”

“Prat.”

“Scrawny.”

“Slutty.”

Sirius threw his head back and laughed so hard his entire body shook with it.

 

Harry figured that making up with Sirius was another high part of his day.

Not that it was worth having his arm snapped, but it was a good moment all the same.

Chapter Text

Time didn’t work like it used to anymore.

There were long stretches where time moved normal and Bucky knew he was in new New York- a place packed with people on cell phones with flashing lights and electric advertisements around every corner. There were smoky bars with cheap whisky and TV’s playing sporting events.

Bucky liked sitting in those bars, having a drink and a smoke made him feel normal, not so out of time and place.

Other times, Bucky would be standing on the sidewalk and all it took was one person brushing their arm against his and he would be off—

Running.

Hiding.

Plotting.

What was the mission status?

Mission…

Mission…

Stark Tower.

Stark.

 

“You will retrieve the plans for the new super serum, understood?”

“Understood.”

“If he doesn’t have it- kill him. If he does, bring it back and kill him. No witnesses.”

“Understood.”

 

Bucky would find himself outside the tower with Stark’s name up top- no memory of how he got there and no idea of what he was doing until the kid appeared.

The kid looked like the Stark that Bucky killed, the one whose photos were in the museum with Steve’s pictures.

It was that Stark’s grandson, Bucky knew that. The son of the man that Bucky made an orphan.

“Mate, I told you you can’t come so close,” the kid would hiss. He didn’t grab Bucky, but he stepped right up to him without a trace of fear on his face. “C’mon, before someone sees you.”

So many kids died - kids always died in war, they were weak and vulnerable and always alone - but Bucky couldn’t let Stark die again.

If this Stark died then HYDRA won and Bucky would never be more than a machine built for murder again.

“Bucky, have you ate today?”

Bucky blinked and he was inside a dusty store that smelled like mold and stale bread. There was the kid that had to live, Harry Stark, in front of him with big green eyes and a nearly full grown German Shepherd at his side.

“What are we doing here?” Bucky asked. “We have to go.”

HYDRA would send people, dangerous people, and they wouldn’t care to kill this kid. They would enjoy it, they’d torture him for information before they sent the Winter Soldier to take the final shot.

It didn’t matter if he was a kid, not even old enough to join a war, they would kill him.

 

“Please, please, I have a son.”

 

Bucky took Tony Stark’s parents, he wouldn’t let HYDRA take his kid.

“We can’t leave,” Harry said patiently. “Here, eat.”

Bucky looked down and there was a brown bag in Harry’s hands filled with something that smelled greasy and warm.

“Sit, eat,” Harry said firmly. Bucky did it because he didn’t know when he ate last and he was hungry.

“What day is it?” Bucky asked Harry while he slowly ate the salty fries from the bag. That was how it worked sometimes, everything was foggy and then it was clear.

It felt like Bucky wandered through a field of mist and then stepped in a hole, falling through the world, and landing in a crystal clear place that apparently came with fries and a burger.

“It’s Thursday, Bucky, the 25th,” Harry said. “I- we just talked yesterday, do you remember?”

No, he didn’t.

“Has HYDRA infiltrated yet?” Bucky asked warily. Were they hiding yet? If not, why? Nobody could kill the kid if Bucky were watching his back, they couldn’t.

Harry sighed and sat down at the other chair at the table that Bucky was eating at. “HYDRA isn’t infiltrating, Bucky. You’re just all mixed up in the head. You want me to talk or you?”

That felt like a familiar question.

“You,” Bucky said. He grabbed the burger Harry got him and his skin settled down while he listened to Harry fill him in on his day.

“Peter went from ignoring me to trying to get me to talk to him, I told you that, remember?” Harry said.

Bucky tried to sift through his memory that was filled with holes and blank spaces and then found a memory of being in that same place before, listening to Harry talk about his friend.

“Peter’s the one in the spider costume that hates me, right?” Bucky checked.

“Right,” Harry nodded. “I might block his number, I dunno. Today in gym he offered to be partners and I said no and then I had to be partners with Brittany and…”

Bucky liked listening to Harry talk, it was like he was sixteen again and huddled up with Steve, listening to him talk. Harry wasn’t like Steve at all really though, Harry was more like Bucky with his harsh words and sad eyes.

“What did you do? Before?” Harry asked after he finished talking about that little asshole with the costume and the webs.

“Before what?” Bucky asked.

Time was normal then. Bucky suspected time always worked normally when he was hidden in an old bakery with nothing but the Stark he could save for company.

“Before you were a brainwashed assassin?” Harry grinned.

Ah.

“I was a soldier,” Bucky said with pride. “I was eighteen when I enlisted. I got assigned to the 107th Infantry, men in boots on the ground,” he explained. “I was a good soldier, a good leader. I made officer and led my men in battle until we were captured in ‘43.”

“What happened?” Harry asked, eyes wide as if he were listening to some thrilling tale instead of Bucky’s worst defeats.

“HYDRA,” Bucky snarled. He crushed the paper wrapper from the food Harry brought him when he thought of it—

His men in cages.

HYDRA using them like test rats.

“Some of them died, all of them would have eventually if it hadn’t been for Steve,” Bucky said flatly. He struggled to recall what happened next- he’d been infused with the serum, but he had no dramatic changes like Steve did, only a disconnect from his memories.

“We became the Howling Commandos,” Bucky said slowly, his face screwed up as he tried to remember. “We had a single mission, eradicate HYDRA at all their bases.”

 

“Bucky, on your left!”

“Dugan! DUGAN!”

 

When Bucky shook his head, clearing the fog and the gun powder away, Harry was sitting there with a patient expression.

“I’m guessing it didn’t go so well?” Harry quipped.

Bucky shivered and shook his head. “I fell, in the Alps. I remember… I remember Steve reaching for me and I went to grab his hand and… and I just fell. I lost an arm and was found by HYDRA. My team thought I was dead.”

And Bucky Barnes did die; the Winter Soldier killed him.

“The silver one’s better anyway,” Harry said. “Might be worth the madness to have a super strong arm.”

“God, you are such a smartass,” Bucky laughed. “I bet Steve hates you.”

“He gave me boxing lessons once,” Harry said, scrunching his nose up. “It didn’t go so great.”

“You don’t look like much of a fighter,” Bucky pointed out wryly. The kid was scrawny, not as bad as Steve used to be, but still skinny. He had some fire in his eyes, but he’d need a damn lot of training to be a soldier.

“Yeah?” Harry’s eyes got some of that fire in them then. “I’d like to see you face off against Voldemort and live.”

“I’ll get right on that,” Bucky said seriously, “just as soon as you explain what the fuck a Voldemort is.”

“It’s not like you’ll remember in five minutes anyway,” Harry smirked.

Smartass.

Bucky became all business though once the kid started talking about magic and wizards- killers and kids being hunted.

It didn’t surprise him that Harry had powers—

Howard had been a genius.

Howard’s son was a genius with a super powered metal suit.

Why wouldn’t Howard’s grandson be a super powered wizard?

 

“HOWARD! HOWARD!”

 

Harry talked about wizards and Voldemort - the magical version of Johann Schmidt, Red Skull.

“What the fuck kind of name is Voldemort?” Bucky asked when Harry was done and his eyes looked like he was drifting away back to a graveyard where he’d been tortured.

“It’s stupid, look…” Harry got his phone out and pulled up a blank screen. He typed in the words ‘Tom Marvolo Riddle’ and began deleted the letters one by one as he added in ‘I am Lord Voldemort’.

Fascists always thought they were so original with their names, but Voldemort was just another Red Skull, another Hitler.

“Where’s he located?” Bucky asked Harry.

“Why? You wanna test you and your metal arm and mad thoughts against Voldemort?” Harry snorted. “Nice try, mate.”

Harry might not think much of Bucky’s chances, but Harry didn’t know that the Winter Soldier was always lurking in the back of his mind, ready to take over at any time.

 

Bucky sat in a bar by himself, his cap pulled low, sipping on a scotch.

It was loud in there, a lot of young guys celebrating one of their friends joining the military—

They wouldn’t celebrate if they knew he’d never come back, not really.

—but it wasn’t so loud that Bucky didn’t clock the woman who sat on his right while a man sat on his left.

“Hey, handsome.” The woman had red hair that matched her lipstick, skintight black clothes, and a sultry voice that Bucky knew was familiar.

Bucky kept his eyes on his glass, mentally calculating his best escape route with minimum casualties.

They weren’t taking him alive.

Bucky had a mission.

He could not fail.

“What’s a soldier like you doing in a place like this?” the woman asked.

“Let’s not do this,” Bucky said quietly. He liked that bar, the bartender gave him free smokes sometimes.

“No can do,” the man said. He had short dark hair and a thick stature of someone trained. “Do you want to do this the easy way or the hard way?”

Had Bucky ever done anything the easy way?

Bucky moved a fraction of a second before the guy did. He jumped backward off his stool and grabbed it, swinging it around and breaking it on the man. The woman kicked out at him and he leaned back, barely avoiding her black boots.

Someone screamed when Bucky jumped backward and grabbed a pool stick to swing at the woman advancing on him, but they weren’t taking him in.

“Come on, don’t you want to see your friend?” The woman got a kick in, square to Bucky’s chest, knocking him backward on the pool table, but Bucky grabbed the eight ball and threw it at the man before he could grab him.

“Tell your friend I’m not interested,” Bucky sneered. He jumped forward and grabbed the woman’s shoulders before raising his knee to her stomach and pushing her away roughly.

“It’s your—”

“Bucky.”

Bucky spared a look through the crowd of people fleeing the bar to see familiar blue eyes looking at him.

“Steve…?”

Bucky didn’t get a chance to dig and discover if he was seeing things or not before something heavy struck him in the back of the head and everything went black.

 

“Mission report,” Howard Stark said curtly. He stood before Bucky with green eyes and black hair. He was younger than he had been last time Bucky saw him, but familiar.

“Decimate HYDRA leader, alias Voldemort,” Bucky reported.

“Mission status?”

“Failed.”

A bullet tore through Howard’s chest- red blood stained the blue sweater he wore -and Bucky watched as he fell.

Bucky failed.

Bucky failed.

 

“I failed… mission failed…”

“Does he dream in assassin?”

“Don’t pretend like you don’t.”

“Guys, cool it. Both of you go outside, this is going to be easier if it’s just me here.”

The third voice was familiar and made Bucky want to open his eyes.

When he did, he must have been twenty again because Steve was in front of him.

“Steve?” Bucky croaked. He went to stand, but his hands were cuffed with metal to the chair he was in. “What the hell?”

“I wasn’t sure who would be waking up, Bucky or the soldier,” Steve said calmly. He sat down across from Bucky and Bucky took a quick chance to assess his surroundings.

“You took me hostage in a hotel?” Bucky asked, looking around and recognizing the bland decorations and nondescript duvet on a bed.

“We’re a little light on housing at the moment,” Steve chuckled. Steve looked good, healthy, and he wore a casual jacket and a pair of jeans. His eyes though, man Bucky could always read his eyes.

“What’s happening?” Bucky asked, seeing the fear in Steve’s eyes. “Why are we here?”

And who was coming?

“We need to talk, Bucky,” Steve said calmly. “Why are you in New York?”

Why was Bucky in New York?

“I have… a mission,” Bucky said slowly. He couldn’t see through the smoke, but the mission was there. “From… Stark.”

“Tony Stark?” Steve asked quickly, leaning forward while Bucky pulled on his restraints. “Is that who gave you a mission?”

No, not the orphaned Stark.

“The kid,” Bucky said, more confident then.

Fuck, if Bucky was in chains then the kid was vulnerable.

“Steve, you have to let me go,” Bucky said frantically, pulling hard on the chains. “The kid, they can’t take him. You know they will. They will. They’ll kill him.”

“Harry gave you a mission?” Steve asked, his eyes thoughtful. “What is it?”

“LET ME GO,” Bucky screamed. He pulled hard and felt the chain cut in his wrist, the wrist that could feel anything, not the cold lump of metal that used to be human. “The kid, Steve! The kid! I’ve got to save him.”

And he could.

He could.

Bucky could save him.

 

“Barnes, clear the field!”

“It’s…” Bucky held his weapon, staring at a group of kids with dirty skin and hungry eyes. They were huddled together and the oldest had long black hair and she whispered prayers in a language Bucky couldn’t understand.

“It’s kids, Sergeant,” Bucky reported through the communicator. “It’s just kids.”

“Our orders are clear, Private. Clear the field.”

“I’m sorry,” Bucky whispered to the kids. He closed his eyes and followed orders.

 

“I won’t clear the field,” Bucky told Steve firmly. “I have my orders, Captain. Eradicate HYDRA, protect the kid.”

“Bucky, there’s no mission,” Steve said lowly. “You have to stay away from the kid, he’s going to get hurt. You don’t want that, do you?”

He was going to get hurt, kids always did in war.

“I’ve got to save him,” Bucky said, a whine slipping through his teeth when he strained against the chains again. The kid could be dead, held hostage, being tortured.

“Bucky, you need to leave,” Steve told him. “You can’t stay here. Stark doesn’t want you near the kid, you can’t keep following him. Harry’s a good kid, he’s got enough to deal with. Okay? What happened to Montana? I thought you were staying there?”

Montana?

Bucky shook his head and relaxed his muscles in the chair, trying to think. He could see mountains, a cabin. It had been warm and Bucky liked the smell of the forest. And…

“Stark had a son,” Bucky said, remembering what drove him back to New York. “It’s Howard’s grandson, Steve. We have to save him.”

“YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE PUTTING HARRY IN DANGER!” Steve snapped. “YOU CANT KEEP FOLLOWING HIM AROUND, BUCK. TONY IS GOING TO HAVE YOU LOCKED AWAY TO KEEP THAT KID SAFE, DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?”

Bucky understood perfectly.

‘Keep that kid safe’.

“I understand,” Bucky said. He raised a brow and looked down at the metal that had to be more than just standard metal. “You mind?”

Steve stood up and pulled a key from his pocket. He held it out, just out of reach, and stared hard in Bucky’s calm eyes.

“Are you going back to Montana?” Steve asked him.

“Yes,” Bucky said. “The woods were nice, you know? It’s different than the city, quieter.”

“Yeah,” Steve smiled softly and undid the lock holding the chains in place. “You need some money, Buck? I can give you a ride out there.”

“No, I’ve got a ride,” Bucky said evasively. He grinned crookedly and rubbed his wrist. “We didn’t grow up in Brooklyn for me to not know how to get a ride.”

Steve chuckled and held his hands up placatingly, backing away so Bucky could stand.

“Alright, Buck,” he said. “I’ll come see you soon, okay? Can you get ahold of me when you get there?”

“Sure,” Bucky said. He took a step back when Steve lifted his arms. “I’ll see you around, Stevie.”

“Bye, Buck.”

Bucky heard the disappointment in Steve’s voice, he always could, but he had a mission to get back to.

 

Bucky had a pack of cigarettes he bought with money he didn’t remember getting. He leaned against the lamp post in the dead of night and watched the tower. He didn’t smoke much, but he did then.

The burn in his chest kept his mind clear and focused on the mission.

There was a party happening up on one of the higher floors; Bucky had seen people arriving and caterers bringing food and booze. It was prime time for someone to make a move on the kid.

Bucky had burnt through four cigarettes before he saw his target; Harry came flying out of the front doors and Bucky was on alert immediately.

When Harry started jogging down the sidewalk, Bucky followed.

If someone was after the kid, they’d have to rip through him to get them.

“Quit following me!” Harry yelled. Bucky looked around, searching for his attacker, but saw nobody.

Harry spun around and Bucky jerked to a stop while they stared at each other under the light of a lamppost.

“You, Bucky,” Harry snapped. “Don’t follow me tonight. I- I need space.”

“It’s not safe,” Bucky told him. He’d seen the spider guy earlier, leaping across buildings. He could attack, Harry hated him.

Harry stalked up to Bucky and Bucky saw that his eyes were as easy to read as Steve’s were. Harry was upset about something.

“Mate, I like you, really, but I will hurt you if you follow me,” Harry said with a glare. “It’s a bad day, alright?”

“Why?” Bucky asked him. He looked around quickly and didn’t sense anyone closing in on them. “We’re exposed here. Your friend could show up any minute.”

Or Bucky’s friend- the one who wanted him to disappear.

It would be easier for Steve if Bucky Barnes stayed dead.

It would have been easier for Bucky too.

Harry sighed and looked suddenly defeated. “Have you ate today?”

“Have you?” Bucky countered with quickly.

Harry grinned then, a tired and joyless grin. “No. Come on, put this on and we’ll go buy food.”

Bucky accepted the purple sheet Harry gave him and held it up in confusion.

“Don’t break my bloody arm,” Harry warned Bucky when he grabbed the sheet. “It’s magic, okay?”

Bucky held his breath and stood frozen while Harry took the sheet and wrapped it around him. When Harry reached up to pull a hood over Bucky’s head, Bucky had to lock his muscles to keep from reacting.

“There,” Harry said with a smug look. “You’re invisible, so just shut the fuck up and we’ll go get food and find somewhere to talk, okay?”

As Bucky was told to ‘shut the fuck up’, he didn’t reply. He did follow Harry down the sidewalk though and paused when they passed a dark store front and he had no reflection.

Magic.

“Christ on a cross,” Bucky whispered. The sheet made him invisible.

“Brilliant, right?” Harry drawled quietly from in front of him. “It’s called an Invisibility Cloak, it’s from my dad.”

“Tony?” Bucky whispered.

“James,” Harry said lightly, an undercurrent of something in his voice. “James and Lily Potter, those were my parents.”

Bucky didn’t understand, Harry was clearly Tony’s son.

“You look like Howard,” Bucky told him.

Harry looked over his shoulder with a puzzled expression. “Tony’s dad?”

Bucky clamped his mouth shut, uneasy with the reply he had. Instead, he continued to silently follow Harry while the kid went to the bodega on the corner and bought bags of chips, bottles of coke, and two loaded hot dogs from the cooker on the counter.

The cashier was a younger woman, one who had on cat ears and whiskers drawn on her cheeks.

“Have a hot date?” she asked Harry with a wide smile.

“Yeah, with the flames of hell,” Harry said flatly.

The woman giggled, she couldn’t have been over eighteen. “You’re funny,” she said. Bucky saw Harry actually cringe when she fluttered her lashes at him. “You know, I get off at eleven and my friend’s having a party.”

“Cool,” Harry said carelessly. He handed over a twenty and waited for her to give him his change. “Have fun.”

Bucky snickered when they are outside and Harry led him toward what had probably been a flower garden before the season changed.

“I think she wanted you to go with her, dumbass,” Bucky said after they sat together on a bench and he removed the invisibility cloak.

“I know people think I’m a fucking idiot, but I’m really not,” Harry said with a roll of his eyes. He gave Bucky half of all the food he bought and then stared down at his lap instead of actually eating.

“I don’t actually like Halloween,” Harry said. “My parents were killed on Halloween, you know?”

Bucky tried to piece his own night together with the knowledge of the date. “Your dad threw a party to celebrate a holiday that your other parents were killed on? That’s sick,” he said genuinely. “What the hell is wrong with him?”

Harry looked up and smiled faintly. “He didn’t throw a party, Sirius sort of did.”

Bucky’s brain instantly supplied him with a memory of Sirius- dark hair, grey eyes, hot as hell.

“Did he not know your parents died?” Bucky asked. Sirius was fun, wild, forward, but he didn’t seem cruel.

“Oh, Sirius was best mates with James, my dad,” Harry told him. He took a swig of his coke and Bucky took a bite of the hot dog he had. “Sirius said they’d want us to celebrate. I think he just didn’t want to be alone tonight.”

Bucky could understand not wanting to be left alone. “Would they want you to celebrate?” he asked Harry curiously.

“Dunno. They were killed when I was one.” Harry sighed heavily and Bucky felt bad for him. “Sirius pushes everything away and tries to ‘live in the present’. It makes him happy, I dunno. I just… I wish I could be more like him.”

“Drinking in bars and sleeping with anyone who offers?” Bucky snorted . “I think there’s better ways to cope.”

Harry turned then and looked in Bucky’s eyes in a way that made Bucky feel like he was staring straight to his soul.

“How do you cope?” Harry asked. “When everything is too much, when you feel like you’re being haunted or hunted by yourself, what do you do?”

Bucky laughed, laughed hard. Bucky laughed until he had tears in his eyes and Harry was staring at him warily.

“What do I do?” Bucky repeated once he felt grounded. “I let it all catch me. I can outrun a lot of shit, but not myself.”

The Winter Soldier was as fast as Bucky was, faster even. And all those people the Winter Soldier killed? They hated Bucky just as much as they did the Winter Solider.

“I do too,” Harry sighed. Bucky felt him relax beside him which helped Bucky to relax.

“You know who Sirius invited?” Harry asked after Bucky finished his food and Harry ate half of his. Bucky shook his head, he didn’t know any of Sirius’ friends.

“Peter,” Harry scoffed. “He didn’t come, but he text me about it, asking if I wanted him there.”

“And you told him no?”

Harry laughed shortly. “I told him he could only if he wore his spider-bloke suit and brought a date.”

“Damn.” Bucky whistled. “You’re cold.”

Harry looked over and smirked, shrugging his shoulders as well. “He’s being a prat. Or- I am, I don’t know really, I just know everything’s a mess.”

Bucky leaned his plastic bottle of coke over to tap it against Harry’s.

“That’s life, kid.”

“Yeah,” Harry sighed. “Life sucks.”

 

Bucky sat out at that garden with Harry until Harry began shivering and he decided to head home. And even after walking Harry back, making sure he wasn’t attacked, Bucky was still thinking it over.

Life did suck.

Chapter Text

Saturday, November 3

Harry liked Saturdays.

There was no school, no tutoring, no therapy.

Sundays meant dinner with Tony, Sirius, Pietro, Bruce, and sometimes Rhodey or Pepper if they were in town.

But Saturdays? Saturdays meant Harry could do anything he wanted, really.

Harry used to spend Saturday with Peter; playing video games or skating, sometimes working on homework or just talking. Now though, Harry tended to spend his Saturday mornings by practicing magic, wanting to do more without a wand as Strange thought he could.

After breakfast, Harry sat on the sitting room floor with his legs crossed while he practiced and his dad sat on the recliner with a computer, working.

The rhythmic tapping of Tony doing whatever it was he was doing was a soothing background noise, one that Harry used to clear his mind.

Focus on the tapping, clear your mind.

Tap… tap… tap…

Ding!

Harry ignored his phone and focused on the tapping…

Tap… tap… tap…

Ding!

“Damn it,” Harry muttered. He opened his eyes and turned around to grab his phone off the coffee table.

Friendly reminder that I miss you, I’m sorry, and can we talk?

Hey kiddo, want to see if your broom is faster than Pietro? He needs something to distract himself.

Harry deleted the first text from Peter and sent Sirius back a thumbs up and a middle finger for good measure.

Sirius was the best, but he was also being incredibly clingy ever since Halloween when they had a minor spat and Harry left to cool off.

 

“I’m so sorry, kiddo. I’m so sorry.”

Sirius had been drunk and Harry was as patient as he could be considering it wasn’t exactly a great day for him either.

“Siri, I don’t blame you and I’m sure neither do they,” Harry said, awkwardly patting Sirius on the back.

Sirius had looked up at Harry and his eyes were bleary and wet. “I should have been the secret keeper.”

“No, what you should have done is told Hagrid to piss off and not go after Pettigrew,” Harry said with a roll of his eyes. “If you’d been secret keeper then they would have killed you.”

“Dying would have hurt less,” Sirius said before breaking into embarrassingly loud sobs.

“Thanks, Siri, that makes me feel great,” Harry scowled. He knew Sirius was drunk, but he was also a prat sometimes and needed more therapy than Harry ever had.

Harry looked around at the others that were there keeping Sirius company until he caught Pietro giving them a curious look.

“Mate, you’re on Sirius watch,” Harry told him. “I- I need some bloody air.”

 

“Geek boy or the dogfather?” Tony asked Harry distractedly, his eyes focused on the screens he had floating in the air and the one on his lap.

“Both,” Harry said. He switched his phone on silent and then turned back to the crisscrossed pose he and Strange used during their sessions.

Harry breathed deeply and slowly, finding it much easier to focus on the single task than it used to be. All he had to do was listen to Tony tapping on his screens and let all his other thoughts drift away…

Tap… tap… tap…

Another inhale, exhale.

Harry turned his hands over on his knees, facing his palms upward.

Tap… tap… tap…

Lumos.

Harry willed himself to stay perfectly calm and focused on holding light in his hands before peeking his eyes open and seeing the golden lights radiating from his palms.

“Dad, hurry, can you take a picture?” Harry asked calmly, needing photo evidence to show off send to Hermione.

Tony looked over at Harry and snagged his phone off the armrest and went to take a photo—

“Wait!” Harry closed his eyes and made himself look as calm and peaceful as he could. “Okay, now.”

“You know, I thought magic would be used for more than just becoming a human flashlight, but it’s a handy tool to have,” Tony quipped after he took the photo for Harry.

“I’m going to try something else now,” Harry said eagerly. He turned around so he was facing the coffee table and willed the lights to disappear.

Inhale, hold it, exhale.

Tap… tap… tap…

All his other thoughts drifting away.

Harry kept his eyes open and focused on his phone.

“Wingardium leviosa,” Harry whispered.

When his phone began rising up in the air, Harry jumped up and threw a fist high with a crow of victory.

“Take that, Hermione!” he yelled, rocking back and forth on the heels of his feet. “Who needs a bloody wand now? Not me!”

Hermione was going to lose her mind with jealousy and Harry couldn’t wait. Strange was a genius.

“You should give Strange a raise,” Harry told Tony after he pocketed his phone.

“Are you learning magic to learn magic or spite Hermione?” Tony asked as he swiped away some of his screens.

Harry considered it carefully. “Both,” he said. He grinned before flopping down on the couch. “You’ve got no idea how much work it is to do magic without a wand. I’ve only ever known Dumbledore to do it and even he mostly uses a wand.”

If Harry could get good, really good, then he could be in a duel and being disarmed would mean nothing.

 

“Bow to your death, Harry.”

And Harry could just shoot a spell from the tip of his fingers.

“Go fuck yourself, Tom.”

 

Harry must have been smiling, because Tony laughed quietly.

“Good daydream?” he asked.

Harry nodded, “The best. Oi, Sirius and Pietro want to go race…”

There was a flash of something in Tony’s expression before it disappeared and he looked entirely relaxed.

“With your broom?” Tony asked.

“Yeah,” Harry said. He hesitated, unsure if he should ask or not… Tony was a busy bloke, working constantly, but also…

“Do you- er… would you want to come?” Harry asked awkwardly. “I just thought my Firebolt could probably outrace you and if we’re going anyway…”

Tony perked up and was beaming so quickly that Harry wondered if he’d wanted to be invited from the start.

“My suit against your broom?” Tony closed the computer and made his hologram screens all disappear with a lazy wave of his hand. “Oh, kid, I’m going to kick your ass.”

Harry scoffed, entirely confident in his broom.

 

“THIS IS BULLSHIT!” Harry yelled a couple of hours later.

Happy drove Harry, Joey, Sirius, and Pietro to a place outside of the city. Tony met them there with his suit on and Harry brought his Firebolt and Invisibility Cloak.

And then he immediately got his arse kicked by Pietro and Tony both.

“How are you so bloody fast?” Harry asked Pietro after landing and ripping his cloak off irritably.

Pietro leaned against a tree, a spark of his old mischief in his eyes, and buffed his nails on his jacket. “Perhaps you should have been HYDRA experiment number 728, then you would have more than a flying broomstick to race with.”

At that, Harry looked around subtly, making sure nobody was close enough to hear them. Happy was in the car with a hat pulled over his face, probably asleep. Sirius was… Harry squinted up at the sky… riding on Tony’s back while Tony flew circles around the little forest area they’d been flying and running around.

“How come you’re… normal?” Harry asked Pietro, drifting closer to him.

Pietro quirked an eyebrow up, smirking at Harry. “You did just see me run, yes?”

Harry waved his hand, brushing off Pietro’s ability. “I mean you’re not fucking insane,” he said bluntly, mentally apologizing to Bucky as he said it. “Hydra experimented on you and you still seem normal.”

“As opposed to the Winter Soldier?” Pietro drawled slowly, grinning when Harry looked surprised. “Did you believe that Sirius was searching for your assassin stalker unassisted?”

“Frankly, I figured the two of you spend more time drunk than productive,” Harry said rudely. “So if I was the Winter Soldier, I’d feel pretty good about my odds.”

“Would you?” Pietro hummed with a sly look that made Harry uneasy. “Even though he must be, how did you say it? ‘Fucking insane’?”

Harry snapped his mouth shut when he heard Tony landing, hoping Pietro wasn’t about to be a narc.

“I had someone to keep me sane,” Pietro murmured with a forlorn expression. “Your soldier did not.”

If all Bucky needed was someone around to help him get his head cleared out, then Harry could be that person. If Harry hadn’t had Sirius last summer, he probably would have gone mad. In fact, if Harry hadn’t had Sirius for the last couple of years, he would have went crazy.

Something to keep in mind next time Harry was annoyed with his godfather anyway.

“Sorry, kid, better luck next time,” Tony called after landing. He dropped his face shield and flew a couple inches off the ground over to where Harry and Pietro were while Sirius still clung to his back with a goofy smile.

Or, Sirius had been smiling, until Tony shook him off and dropped him in the dirt. Then Joey jumped on Sirius and Sirius quickly transformed into Padfoot and began chasing Joey around, barking their heads off.

As much as Harry often felt like he was the parent and Sirius was the irresponsible teen, it was still nice to see Sirius laughing and seeming so openly happy.

“Next time we race I’ll steal your suit,” Harry told his dad, eyeing the iron man costume thoughtfully.

“No can do, kid,” Tony grinned. He pressed a button on his wrist and Harry watched as the metal all folded inside itself until the huge, heavy, bulky suit was nothing more than a black briefcase Tony held in his hand. Tony tapped his chest where there was a faint glow visible through his tshirt. “This one only runs off this baby, the suit without it is nothing more than expensive scrap metal.”

“So what does that make you without the suit?” Pietro asked.

“Uh… a father, genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.” Tony smirked and Harry laughed at his quick response. “What are you without feet?”

“Still rather handsome, I think,” Peitro said without missing a beat. He looked past Harry to where Sirius was still chasing Joey. “Right, любимый?”

Tony coughed quickly, hiding a laugh it seemed like, and Harry narrowed his eyes at Pietro.

“What’d you just call him?” Harry asked sharply. Nobody was going to insult Sirius right in front of Harry.

Padfoot came running up to them on four legs before quickly transforming back to himself. “Nothing,” he said hastily. “Mates, I’m starving. Anyone fancy lunch?”

“I’ll buy,” Tony offered just as quickly. He tossed his free arm around Harry’s shoulder, an unfamiliar but not entirely unwelcome gesture. “What sounds good, kid?”

Harry shrugged. “Pietro can pick, he won.”

“La Hacienda,” Pietro said promptly. “The one on 146th is the only authentic restaurant in New York.”

“What would you know about authentic Mexican food?” Tony asked while they made their way back to the car. “You grew up in a cage.”

Harry listened while Tony, Pietro, and Sirius argued over ‘authentic’ meals the whole drive back to the city. It wasn’t until they began debating on the best sushi place that Harry checked his phone and saw that he had three new texts.

I am sick of you both texting me. Until further notice, I’m not speaking to either of you idiots until you figure your shit out. XOXO, Gwen.

Rude.

HOW DID YOU DO THAT?!?!?! HARRY JAMES CALL ME IMMEDIATELY!!

Harry knew Hermione would be jealous. He was probably lucky he didn’t have a dozen missed calls from her. Harry text her back quickly before just that happened.

Maybe I’ll show you over break. Tony said he’ll send the jet. Miss you.

The third was from an expected, if annoying, contact.

Call me, we need to talk.

Harry frowned. That actually was a bit shorter than Peter usually was.

Can’t talk, what do you want?

Your friend is hurt.

Harry’s insides immediately turned to ice. He only knew of one friend of his that Peter could be talking about.

B?

Yeah. It’s bad.

Fuck… fuck… fuck…

“You okay, kiddo? You look like you’re about to be sick,” Sirius said, interrupting Harry’s sudden panic.

Harry looked up and saw that Sirius and Pietro were both giving him concerned frowns, one Harry was sure would be mirrored on Tony’s face if he looked over at him.

“Yeah,” Harry said. “Er… actually, no. I feel sick,” he said, partially truthful. He did feel sick, but it wasn’t anything physical. “Do you think I can skip lunch? You guys can just drop me off at home.”

“What’s wrong?” Tony asked quickly. He put the back of his hand on Harry’s forehead and Harry twisted away from it.

“Stomach ache,” Harry lied. He bent over in his seat, putting his head between his knees. “Maybe our milk went bad,” he said, inventing a quick excuse.

“You might be car sick,” Sirius said sympathetically. He reached over and put his hand on Harry’s head, scratching his scalp affectionately. “I’ve got anti nausea potions in my place.”

“Thanks,” Harry groaned, laying it on a bit thick.

“Don’t puke in here,” Happy called from the drivers seat. “Puke is a bitch to get out of the upholstery.”

“I’ll keep that in mind,” Harry said drily. He held his phone down by his feet so he could glance at the screen and send Peter a quick text back.

If you can move him, take him to the old bakery down the street from my place. I’ll be there soon.

How Bucky could have gotten himself gravely injured in the short time it had been since Harry saw him, Harry had no idea. But it seemed like befriending a crazy assassin who had a $500,000 tag on his head was a bit more complicated than Harry had foreseen.

 

When Happy pulled up to the tower, Harry expected to be the only one to get out.

“What are you doing?” he asked his dad when Tony climbed out after him.

Tony pinched his brows together. “Uh… isn’t playing nurse one of those things parents do when their kid is sick?”

“No idea,” Harry snapped, “I never had them before.”

Harry felt a small bit of guilt break through his panic and worry when Tony’s face fell some, but Tony rallied quickly.

“You do now,” he said brightly. “Come on, let’s go find those magic potions and see if they work any.”

Harry tried to think of how to make a quick escape the whole way up to Sirius’ flat. He’d rather do it in a way that didn’t hurt Tony’s feelings, since he was a bit more sensitive than Harry used to think he was, but he’d rather make his dad sad for a little while than let Bucky die.

Preferably neither would happen if Harry could help it.

“Where do you think Sirius stores his potions?” Tony asked when they stepped off the lift together, Joey following behind them.

“The bathroom,” Harry lied. “Or the kitchen. Somewhere high and dry. I’m going to grab my jacket I left here the other night.”

“Sounds good,” Tony said cheerfully. As soon as he set off to the kitchen, Harry went in Sirius’ room and opened his top dresser drawer to go through his potions.

Blood replenisher… Pepper-up… Skele-gro… Anti-nausea… Pain reliever…

Harry quickly and quietly grabbed a couple of each type of potion that he thought might help Bucky and stuffed them in one of Sirius’ bags and added his cloak to it before tossing his broom on Sirius’ bed.

“Found them,” Harry called. He grabbed an empty vial and tipped it backward as he opened the door. “Ugh, disgusting,” he told Tony who had still been digging in the kitchen cabinets.

“Who keeps medicine in their bedroom?” Tony scoffed.

“People who have a lot of guests over,” Harry said flatly, staring at Tony until he understood the implication.

“Aah,” Tony finally nodded his head and grinned. “Yeah, that makes sense.”

Harry mentally crossed his fingers and hoped that Tony was a much worse lie detector than Professor Snape had always been.

“I think Sirius was right though, I was probably just car sick, I feel fine now.” Harry shrugged and put the empty vial on the tv stand. “I actually feel a bit hungry now.”

“Oh, good,” Tony said, doubling Harry’s guilt when he seemed so relieved. “Do you want to go catch up with Sirius and Happy or we could order something in and watch TV or something?”

“Actually…” Harry fidgeted and let some of his guilt shine through as he dropped his eyes to his feet. “Er… Peter wanted to get lunch and talk, I thought maybe I’d see what he had to say.”

“Oh.”

Harry didn’t have to look to know that Tony would be disappointed; he seemed to actually enjoy spending time with Harry, as odd as the notion was.

“That’s good because I have a ton of shit to work on today,” Tony said breezily. “I’m trying to figure out an efficient way to mass produce phones like yours in a cost effective way so that those other students at your old school can call home every once in a while.”

Harry’s head snapped up and his jaw dropped for a moment.

“You’re planning on selling phones for muggleborns?” he asked, shocked. Tony had no idea how much students at Hogwarts would love that. Harry had heard more than a few students complain about not having access to a phone and not being able to own an owl, since they weren’t exactly easy to maintain or common pets.

Katie Bell, a nice girl on the Gryffindor quidditch team, had been in tears once because she missed her family so much and she couldn’t send owls because they were too peculiar to be seen flying in and out of the apartment building her family lived in.

“I’m trying to,” Tony stressed, looking suddenly sheepish. He combed his fingers through his hair and Harry recognized the look in his eyes- it was Hermione’s ‘let’s go to the library’ look; except on Tony it was a ‘I need a computer and a toolbox’ look.

“The problem is as it stands, just the materials of each phone would cost nearly a grand, so if I can cut back the material costs without sacrificing the operating system…”

Harry impulsively reached out and gave Tony a quick hug. “You’re a good person,” he said, half miserable about the realization.

Tony hugged Harry back tightly before letting him go and giving Harry a crinkly eyed smile that made Harry’s guilt triple that time.

“You’re a good son,” Tony said, a bit gruff. “Go have your totally not a date with geek boy, but make him pay for himself and grovel for your attention.”

“Okay,” Harry said, backing toward the lift. He waited until the doors opened and he jumped on, quickly pressing the button for the ground floor. “Love you,” he yelled just before the doors shut.

 

It didn’t erase his guilt, as he lied straight to Tony’s face after swearing to himself just a few weeks ago to not do that anymore, but it did lessen it some.

 

As soon as Harry made it to the main doors, he began running as if his life - or Bucky’s, at least - depended on it. Since Peter never text him back, Harry had to assume they were at the bakery and if not then he’d convince Jarvis to hack Peter’s gps or something.

Harry should have found a way to track Bucky before then; it wasn’t safe to have some crazy bloke running around without a way to find him quick.

The further Harry ran, the more worried he was that Bucky was dead and that was why Peter hadn’t text him anymore…

Maybe Peter did it.

Maybe they got in a fight.

Maybe Steve found him and decided to attack.

Maybe Bucky got mug—

No, Bucky couldn’t get mugged. Bucky was more likely to be a mugger.

If Peter attacked Bucky then Harry would… would…

Harry growled while he ran. It was bloody unfair to be at such a disadvantage when it seemed like everyone Harry knew had some sort of superpower and Harry had the amazing ability to make his hands glow.

The door of the bakery was locked, but Harry had enough adrenaline running through him that he shouldered the door hard and literally fell in the room while his shoulder protested the move loudly.

“Bucky?” Harry hissed, seeing nobody in the dining room area. There was a puddle of blood by the register that made Harry’s breath catch in his throat and his heart to pound ferociously loud.

No… no… no…

Harry followed the blood trail on autopilot, his feet leading him past the counter, through the employee door, and to the kitchen without Harry commanding them to do so.

If Bucky was dead, it would be Harry’s fault. Harry thought he could help him, thought he could fix him, and left him alone with nothing more than a bag of meager supplies and promises to check on him…

Harry’s eyes followed the trail of smeared blood straight to…

“Peter?!”

Harry ran then and knelt down beside where Peter was slumped against a wall, dark red blood soaking his spider-bloke costume. Peter didn’t have his mask on and he groaned when Harry slapped him lightly, trying to make sure he was alive.

“He’s- he’s insane,” Peter gasped, his eyelids fluttering. Harry’s hands were shaking uselessly around Peter’s stomach where it looked like he’d been stabbed.

“I’m sorry,” Harry whispered. He pushed his hand against the wound, trying to stop the bleeding somehow. “Peter, I’m so bloody sorry.”

Harry didn’t need to wonder who hurt Peter and finding Bucky wasn’t a real priority while Peter was dying.

“Hey, Bright Eyes…” Harry looked up from the wound to Peter’s face and saw that he was smiling softly. “If I’m dying, do you think maybe you could just be my friend again?”

“Don’t die,” Harry told him immediately. “Please, please, don’t die.”

Peter couldn’t be another Cedric - a teenager dead because Harry was an idiot.

“I won’t die if you promise that later we can talk,” Peter said, a weak joke that Harry ignored.

“We have to get you to the Tower,” Harry said. He cleared his throat and tried to sound more confident and less like he was about to start sobbing. “Can you stand?”

Peter shook his head, looking much too pale, and Harry quickly grabbed his phone from his pocket, covering it in Peter’s blood. It took a moment to unlock it, as slippery as it was in wet hands, and he quickly clicked contacts, planning on calling his dad.

“Harry!”

Harry looked up at Peter and then—

Then something hard and metal struck Harry in the back of the head and everything went black.

Chapter Text

“Miss Granger, you’re looking… whatever an appropriate compliment is for a sixteen year old girl.”

The girl blinking at Tony on his pop-up screen in his office was entirely too shocked to be anything other than an awkward teenager who seemed to struggle with a hairbrush, but Tony kept up his charming smile regardless.

“Um… hi,” Hermione eventually said, her brown eyes appearing as wide as Tony’s entire fist. “Is- is Harry okay?”

“Harry? He’s perfect,” Tony said, his smile slipping to something more genuine. It was a point in the girl’s favor that her first question was about Harry. “I actually called to ask you a few questions, if you don’t mind. Think of this as a consumer product survey for the one of a kind cell phone you have.”

“Oh, okay,” Hermione’s face relaxed and Tony thought he could see some bookshelves behind her, she was probably in a library if Harry’s reports on his friend could be trusted.

Which it could be, in Tony’s opinion.

“What do you need to know?” Hermione asked politely.

Tony pulled another screen up with his list of questions and clicked on a transcriber to record Hermione’s answers.

“How frequently do you make calls to people other than my son?” Tony asked her.

“I call my parents every Friday,” Hermione answered promptly. “But I do let others use it to call their parents as well. I’d say, aside from daily calls to Harry, that the phone makes approximately twelve other calls a week.”

Tony raised a curious brow at her. “Has anyone ever told you that you talk like a textbook reads?”

Hermione twisted her lips to the side in a small smirk. “Yes, sir. Frequently, in fact. Would you like the numbers on that as well?”

Tony chuckled, unwillingly charmed by the dry humor that must have attracted Harry to such a studious friend.

“No, let’s stick to the phone,” he told Hermione. “Okay, next question…”

Tony was able to swiftly flip through his dozen questions as Hermione answered each question factually and with a reasonable amount of intelligence.

“May I ask you a question now?” Hermione asked once Tony told her he was finished.

“Only if it’s incredibly personal and wildly inappropriate,” Tony quipped.

Hermione blushed lightly, but held his gaze. “It is, I suppose. I just wanted to know how Harry’s doing? He’s rather evasive and we worry about him.”

Tony rolled his neck and tried to think of a response that would satisfy the girl and wouldn’t piss Harry off once she undoubtedly quoted Tony later.

“His grades are improving and he’s a big fan of making himself become a human flashlight,” Tony told her.

Hermione smiled rather patronizingly. “And you won’t tell me anything else? Perhaps about his friends or eating and sleeping habits?”

Tony smiled brightly and shook his head. “Afraid not.”

“Is he still getting headaches?”

Tony actually had to think about the last time Harry had a headache from his ‘cursed scar’. “You know what? He isn’t,” Tony said thoughtfully. “Probably low odds that Darth Vader accidentally blew himself up, huh?”

“Probably,” Hermione agreed. “I should get back to my studies, Mister Stark. Thank you for letting Ron and I come next month, we’re terribly excited to see Harry.”

“And thank you for being the Guinea pig of the soon to be seen in stores Stark Phone,” Tony said with a tip of an imaginary hat. A new call blipped up on his screen and Tony smiled at the familiar contact photo. “Duty calls, farewell.”

Tony switched calls with a click and leaned back in his seat with his earpiece in.

“Hey, kid, what’s up?” he asked cheerfully.

“Wrong kid, sorry,” a raspy voice said from the other end that definitely wasn’t Harry. There was a wet cough that had Tony leaning forward intently, something telling him he was really not going to like what he heard next.

“Three blocks east of you is a closed bakery, any chance you can hurry?” the familiar voice asked. “Like… really freaking hurry?”

Tony already had his suit in hand and began clicking it in on him. “Where’s Harry?” he asked as he opened his window for easier take off.

“You’re going to love this about as much as I do…” The voice coughed again, a wet hacking in Tony’s ear that made him cringe. “I’m pretty sure he’s been kidnapped by a fucking psycho.”

Tony saw his own vitals raising on the screen inside the helmet as he took off toward the bakery he’d once taken Harry to.

“Red hair and hot as can be or one arm and oozes crazy?” Tony demanded.

“One arm and fucking insane.”

 

Tony was going to crush James Barnes and Steve Rogers both beneath his boot.

 

Before he even landed, Tony blasted the front door from the building and had all his weapons honed and ready to attack if he saw so much as a flash of silver.

“Back here,” a voice called, the same one echoing in Tony’s earpiece.

Tony followed a trail of blood that made him feel sick to the kitchen of the shop and looked around until he saw a body slumped against the wall like the pot of gold at the end of the morbid rainbow.

“JARVIS, tell Sirius I want him at my location now,” Tony ordered. He couldn’t even properly process the fact that he really hoped Peter Parker, Harry’s friend and ex, was wearing a belated Halloween costume instead of actually being the terrorist swinging around the city.

Jesus Christ, did Harry know his bff Spiderman was the kid he got in a fight with a few weeks ago?

Not important…

“Help is coming,” Tony told Peter, visually assessing what looked to be an abdominal stab wound. “Where’s Harry?”

“The dude had a car, black mustang, plate number GRY3518,” Peter told Tony quickly. “It sounded like he drove west.”

“Probably stolen,” Tony muttered. “JARVIS, alert all departments with that description. Get ahold of Steve, and I want you searching through every god damned camera in the—”

Crack!

“Oh, you’re fucking kidding me, mate.”

Sirius and Pietro appeared from thin air directly in front of Tony and Sirius immediately knelt down beside Peter and pulled his wand out.

“Does Harry know?” Sirius asked Peter.

“Barnes has Harry,” Tony told them briskly before Peter could answer. “I’m hitting the skies, Pietro start running the streets. He had a black mustang, but this guy’s a pro, he might have dumped it by now. Sirius, stay with Petey here and keep your phone on you.”

To their credit, neither Pietro nor Sirius wasted time with questions, though Sirius did snarl in a way that Tony mentally agreed with.

 

Tony hit the skies and had Steve on his earpiece immediately while he began searching.

“Hey, buddy, long time no talk,” Tony spat. “Where’s your friend at? You know, the one that’s like family to you?”

“He left, Tony,” Steve said calmly, probably even honestly. “I told him to leave Harry alone and he said he was heading out of town.”

Tony zoomed in on a black car and scowled to see a middle-aged woman driving it.

“Yeah? That’s super interesting because fucking Spider-Man just told me that your friend kidnapped my son,” Tony snarled furiously. “Call him, beep him, I don’t care, but find a way to reach him because if I find Barnes first he’s dead.”

He was dead either way, but Tony needed everyone out looking for Harry. In his opinion, it wasn’t too early to call in SWAT.

Or the National Guard, at a minimum. Rhodey was Harry’s emergency guardian, surely he’d call in whatever favors he needed to get a search team together.

“What?! Tony, are you sure?” Steve asked, his voice entirely too shocked to be complicit in the plot to take Tony’s son.

“Spiderman was pretty damn confident,” Tony snapped. “Get your asses out here and find them, now. JARVIS will send you what we have. You report to Sirius, is that fucking clear?”

Tony didn’t have time to have a pissing match get in the way. Sirius had the only goal Tony did- find Harry.

As far as Tony was concerned, Sirius could lead the whole damn team eventually. Steve clearly couldn’t make any rational decisions.

“Crystal,” Steve said curtly. “I’m sorry, Tony. We’ll start searching.”

Tony hung up on him, his anger at Steve multiplying every second that he couldn’t find Harry.

“JARVIS, pull up the location of all Harry trackers,” Tony ordered, desperately trying to remember what Harry had on before he left the house.

Tony didn’t want to be a cliché, but it seemed like he’d joined the group of parents whose kid went missing and he couldn’t even remember what the hell he’d been wearing.

“Their locations are on screen, sir.”

Tony flipped through the tags; Harry’s black converses were at the tower, his leather jacket was at the tower, the phone was still at the bakery, but…

“Go, there, now!” Tony ordered JARVIS as soon as he saw one pinging in an unfamiliar location.

There was a tag Tony stuck on Harry’s Invisibility Cloak and it was still pinging in New York. Tony had thought that tag might be overkill, but he thought if the kid could turn invisible, Tony needed to be able to find him.

It seemed like Tony hadn’t actually tagged enough of Harry’s belongings, but the cloak was a good start.

The cloak’s location was pinging on the corner of Bergen Ave and Newkirk St in Bergen, which meant that Barnes was hauling ass.

Tony was faster though and it looked like Barnes had stopped for something.

Sirius called and Tony answered quickly as he flew full blast to where Harry’s location was pinging.

“Hey, Tony?”

“Yeah?”

“Peter said that Barnes struck Harry in the back of the head, knocked him out,” Sirius said, his voice shaking with the same fury and fear echoing in Tony’s chest. “Peter said Harry was definitely breathing though.”

“Excellent, great.” Tony was so damn close to Harry’s location. “Leave Pete wherever you are and do that magic shit to these coordinates. They’re there- the goal is to get Harry, whatever means necessary, understand?”

Tony didn’t need to tell Sirius of all people that Harry’s safety trumped any other concern, but it was still worth saying aloud.

“Got it.”

Tony disconnected with Sirius and started descending on the scene, zooming in to try and spot that familiar head of hair.

Sirius appeared on the scene just before Tony landed and they both looked around with weapons ready.

“JARVIS, ping the tracker,” Tony murmured. Harry and Barnes could be beneath it and Tony wouldn’t even know it.

A ping echoed in the little alleyway and it took a split-second for Tony to realize it was coming from the metal dumpster. If he wasn’t able to see through the metal walls, he would have been hyperventilating.

“Accio backpack,” Sirius said hoarsely after diving over to the dumpster and sticking his head in it. He held up a nondescript black bag that Tony was fairly confident he’d seen on Harry’s back earlier. “You tracked my bag,” Sirius said flatly.

Tony lowered his face shield and stared at the bag in a blank sort of horror. “Harry’s cloak must be in that bag. I was tracking the cloak.”

Tony was wasting time tracking a fucking backpack while his son was slipping further and further away.

“Then Barnes is running the show,” Sirius said. He opened the bag and pulled Harry’s cloak from it, holding it up for Tony to see. “Harry never, never, would have thrown this in the trash.”

Barnes was a professional, that much was clear.

Sirius peered in the bag and his face scrunched up for a moment. “Harry swiped enough potions to heal an army of people…”

And then Barnes threw them in the dumpster when Harry himself might need them.

A chirp from Sirius’ pocket had him quickly grabbing his phone, a spark of hope in guys desperate grey eyes.

“Yeah?” he said. The spark died quickly and Tony activated his thrusters, ready to hit the sky the moment he had whatever information Sirius had.

“No, I’m sure it’s- it’s Harry’s,” Sirius said, tripping over his words some. “Break in the office, find a number for a manager or something. I want to know in the next five- no, three- I want to know in the next three minutes what’s missing. I know. I don’t give a damn about Steve, have Peter tie his arse up if he starts his shite, got it? Thanks, I’ll call you soon.”

Sirius hung up and the two men shared a deep look of absolute misery.

“Barnes dumped the car at a lot car just off the 280,” Sirius said dully. “Pietro’s going to see if he stole something else.”

Tony turned and slammed an iron fist against the brick wall beside him, bursting through the brick and leaving a pile of dust on the ground.

If Barnes had a new car then he had a head start on them and Tony had no fucking way to track his son. And Tony could trace his path easily- the 280 led to the interstate right out of New York.

“You’re sure what was Harry’s?” Tony asked, needing the answer to the only puzzling bit of information.

Sirius swallowed hard and Tony swore his face lost another couple of shades of color.

“Blood in the backseat,” he said shakily. “Pietro asked if you wanted it for a sample.”

Tony closed his eyes for just a moment, one moment to process that.

Sirius was right, Tony was certain it was Harry’s.

 

Tony called Rhodey as soon as he and Sirius split up- Tony to the skies and Sirius to get a new vehicle report.

“Hey, what’s—”

“I need interstate 80 shut down and checkpoints every ten miles,” Tony said, having no time for pleasantries. Every nanosecond that Harry was gone increased his odds that Barnes would kill him.

“What?” Rhodey was confused, but not unwilling, Tony knew him. “What’s going on?”

“James Barnes, alias Bucky, alias Winter Soldier, has Harry,” Tony told him. “I’ve got no way to track him, no idea what they’re in, but it looks like he’s headed west out of state. Barnes is trained, dangerous, and he has my fucking son.”

A message from Sirius popped up, a description and photo of a silver sedan that was missing from the car lot.

“Silver sedan now,” Tony told Rhodey. “I’ll send you the full description.”

“I’m going to make some calls,” Rhodey said, all business. “Let me call you back.”

As soon as Tony disconnected with Rhodey, someone with an unfamiliar number called him.

“What?” Tony snapped. He was attracting a lot of attention as he flew just high enough to look through the windshields of every car he passed on the highway, but no luck so far.

“Uh, Tony? It’s Peter,” Peter said. “Hey, I just heard Steve say that Bucky has a cabin in Montana. It’s up by the Rockies, just past Seeley Lake.”

Tony did some quick calculations. “That’s a thirty six hour drive and there’s no chance Harry gets on a plane willingly. JARVIS?”

JARVIS’ voice pinged in the background, confirming that he would have law enforcement go scope out the cabin.

“This is probably a bad time to mention it, but Harry and Bucky are friends,” Peter said, talking loudly over the rush of wind in the background on his side of the call. “I’ve seen them hanging out, talking, you know. It’s- fuck- it’s my fault Harry was there, I’m sorry.”

Tony was an excellent multitasker- he could panic in his head while searching for any sight of Barnes or Harry and demand Peter explain exactly how his son managed to get close enough for Barnes to snatch him all at the same time.

“Bucky was fighting with these guys when I found him, one of them did something and cut his leg, bad. There were two of them- nevermind, not important- anyway, I got Bucky, moved him to the bakery. I knew Harry was friends with him and thought maybe he could patch him up or something.

“Next thing I know, Bucky drives a knife through my stomach and left. Harry shows up, Bucky comes back, whacks Harry in the head and drags his body out the back door.”

“You’re damn right this is your fault,” Tony spat, his blood pressure soaring even higher to a level that had it flashing red on his screen. Tony took a moment to breathe in and out, it was a shit time to have a stroke.

“No, it’s Barnes that did this,” Tony said, mildly more calmly to Peter. Peter was Harry’s age, just a kid. “You did good calling me, kid. Where are you now?”

“I’m following Rogers,” Peter reported.

“You hurt?”

“No, Sirius fixed me up.”

“Good,” Tony said. “Stay on Rogers and call me if he says or does anything suspicious. Got it?”

“Got it,” Peter said. His voice lowered some, the same concern bleeding through it that was coursing through every vessel inside Tony’s body. “We’re- we’re going to find them, right?”

“It’s seven against one right now,” Tony said with as much false bravado as he could. “There’s no way he gets far.”

Tony prayed to any god that was willing to listen to him that he wasn’t lying to Peter and then hung up and called Bruce, adding an eighth member to the party.

After quickly explaining what happened, Tony had Bruce pulling up video footage from the Tower, sending a clothing description and recent photo of Harry to every police precinct in a five hundred mile radius. And then he gave him instructions to add the ninth member to the search party.

“Call Pep, have her coordinate with Rhodey to get road blocks out,” Tony instructed Bruce. “Amber alert on Harry, whatever we need. This is my son, my kid, if there’s a single god damned rock in this country, I want it flipped. I want Harry and Barnes’ photos on every news station, every fucking milk carton.”

“I’ll see what I can do,” Bruce said, the sound of him typing away heard clearly in the background. “I’ll call you if I get anything.”

“You do that,” Tony said.

Tony had JARVIS send a message to all members of team ‘find Harry’ after another hour of searching with no results.

Pete, go to the tower, I’ll meet you there.
Sirius, start spreading everyone out of state.
PD has the alerts, cooperate but don’t let them BS you.
Everyone else, follow Sirius’ commands and call me if you spot them.

He sent a separate message to Sirius, instructing him to have Pietro tail Steve since there was only so long Tony could have a minor out searching the streets. And Tony desperately needed every single bit of information from Peter about Barnes’ recent movements as he could get.

Tony got a slew of confirming texts back, all of which he ignored to answer Pepper’s call.

“Tony, I’ve got Fury on the other line,” she said, obviously just as distraught as Tony was. “He’s got a full report on the Winter Soldier he’s sending you.”

“Good work, Pep,” Tony said genuinely. He set his destination to home, he needed to get some sort of idea where Barnes might be headed.

“Tony?”

Tony sighed at the shake in Pepper’s voice, the fear that they wouldn’t find their kid in time.

“I know,” he said heavily. “I know.”

“When we find Barnes, I want him locked up in whatever prison Sirius was in,” Pepper said, as harsh as Tony had ever heard her speak. “I want him fucking buried, Tony.”

Tony wanted Barnes buried almost as much as he wanted his son found safely.

“When we find him, there won’t be a body to bury,” Tony swore. Tony didn’t give a damn how much Steve, or Harry, was attached to Barnes.

Harry was Tony’s son and every single minute he was missing was giving Tony time to come up with the most horrifying and painful forms of torture for Barnes.

Pepper, wonderful pacifist she was, sounded as hard as Tony felt.

“Good,” she snarled. “Hurry up, I’ll get started on the research.”

 

It was a mark of how all of Tony’s mind was focused on finding Harry that he couldn’t even appreciate what a mama bear Pepper was turning out to be.

Chapter Text

The first thing Harry became aware of was that his head hurt so bloody bad that it made his stomach shake.

The second thing Harry became aware of was rolling on his side, hitting some sort of floor, and promptly throwing up all over the place.

And the third thing that Harry became disgustedly aware of was the fact that he just got his own vomit on his face and chest.

Which really made him want to throw up again.

Harry tried to think through the smell of bile and…

“Are you okay?”

Bucky.

Harry jolted upright, scowling when he was stuck in between seats in…

Where the fuck was he?

Harry looked around and realized he was in the back seat of a vehicle… a vehicle moving very fast… a very fast moving vehicle that Bucky was driving.

Harry was in a very fast moving vehicle that Bucky was driving while Harry had his own puke on him and it was dark outside.

“Bucky…” Harry met Bucky’s eyes in the rearview mirror and saw they looked clear and not-too-crazy. “Where are we?”

“Nearly to Tennessee,” Bucky said calmly. “We’ll have to stop soon and change cars. Are you hungry?”

Harry sat on the seat below him and took a moment to try and process what the hell was going on.

Bucky was hurt… then Peter was hurt… and then…

“DID YOU FUCKING STAB PETER AND KIDNAP ME?!” Harry yelled shrilly once he remembered being hit in the head while he was calling his dad.

“Mission status changed,” Bucky said, entirely too calmly, while he continued driving.

Oh god…

Harry frantically patted down his pockets, desperately searching for a phone he was certain wasn’t there.

Peter could be dying, or already dead…

Tony was probably panicking, Harry never stayed out so late without at least a message…

And Bucky wasn’t even slowing down in the slightest…

Harry crawled through the little space between the seats to get up front and take the passenger seat, looking for his bag. Unless his memory was wrong, and the fuzziness of it made that a good possibility, Harry had definitely grabbed a couple of calming draughts back when he wanted to help Bucky and not strangle him with his bare hands.

And Harry was also fairly certain that if he didn’t get one immediately to fix the very odd way he was breathing and sweating that he was going to die before Bucky had a chance to kill him.

“Bucky, Bucky, can you hear me?” Harry asked his bloody kidnapper when the bag wasn’t up front either.

Bucky grinned a little. “I’m not deaf or dumb.”

“Debatable,” Harry muttered. He cleared his throat. “I had a bag, where is it?”

Bucky kept his eyes on the highway that was moving so quickly it looked like a blur to Harry. Actually, Bucky himself was blurry as well, so Harry might just be having some sort of fit.

A fit he damn well earned, really.

“We had to ditch it, it could have had a tracker in it,” Bucky said.

Ditch it…

Ditch the bag with hundreds of galleons worth of potions in it and…

Harry’s breathing was definitely wrong when he realized what else he’d had in that bag.

“Where- where did you ditch it?” Harry asked between shallow breaths that did nothing to ease the burning sensation in his chest.

“Dumpster back in the city.”

Harry gripped the door handle to try and keep himself steady when everything went fuzzy and his head began spinning.

His dad’s cloak had been in that bag, Harry was certain of it. Harry never went anywhere without his cloak, not since revoking it from Sirius. It was… it was the only connection to James he had left…

“Pull over,” Harry whispered weakly when his stomach clenched tightly. When Bucky had apparently gone deaf, Harry quickly undid the lock on his door, threw it open, and rolled out of the car.

All in all, not one of his better plans.

 

“Are you insane?!” Bucky hissed. “You can’t jump from a fucking moving car! Do you have any idea how fast I was driving?!”

Harry moaned and looked down at his leg, or what was meant to be a leg, and felt violently ill at the way that the bone was visible through the skin of what had once been his shin.

When Bucky leaned down to lift Harry from the ditch he’d landed in, Harry lost his battle with his stomach and turned and threw up again, this time on Bucky.

Good, Harry thought victoriously before Bucky moved him. The pain rocked through Harry’s body like a crucio, and Harry’s eyes rolled up and his body gifted him with unconsciousness once more.

 

Unconsciousness didn’t last long and Harry woke in the backseat of a vehicle again.

Oddly, Harry didn’t actually hurt much and he opened his eyes solely due to that fact. Maybe he dreamt that he had seen his own leg bone.

Or maybe not…

Harry looked down his body and saw that his left leg was wrapped up in white bandages and strapped to some sort of blue board. Harry also had on a pair of baggy black shorts that he was certain he didn’t own and a white tshirt that thankfully wasn’t covered in his own blood and vomit.

Which made no sense, but Harry was still grateful to not be covered in disgusting bodily fluids.

“Siri?” Harry said, his tongue thick and his voice slurred.

“Sorry, kid, it’s still me.”

Harry twisted his torso around and saw Bucky was driving a different vehicle.

“What’s…” Harry’s tongue didn’t seem to be connected to his brain. “What’s going on?” he finally managed.

Bucky turned his head to look at Harry and then laughed—

Actually laughed.

As if there were anything funny at all happening.

“You’re high,” he said when he turned back to watch the road. “Sorry about that, I wasn’t sure how much you weighed so I guessed.”

Harry looked in the passenger seat and saw a blue bag with a white medical logo on it.

“Did you rob a hospital?” Harry asked as his brain struggled to make sense of anything.

“An ambulance, actually,” Bucky said as if it were the most normal thing in the world. “I set your leg and sutured it and grabbed some extra doses of dilaudid. Your jeans were trash and you threw up on me, so I grabbed some clothes too.”

“From… an ambulance?” Harry asked dumbly.

Bucky chuckled quietly and shook his head. “Nah, I stopped and grabbed some clothes and food from a store. You thirsty?”

Harry was actually. When he nodded uncertainly, entirely lost while someone he considered his friend drove him further and further away from his home, Bucky handed Harry a bottle of water.

“Should I expect to die from poison?” Harry asked after he took a long drink that soothed the dry ache in his throat and made his brain feel slightly more connected to the rest of his body.

Bucky had the audacity to look surprised when he glanced up in the rearview mirror. “Why would I poison you? I’m saving you. They were following us for a while, but we lost them back in Virginia.”

“Who was following us??” Harry asked wildly. “HYDRA? My dad? Peter?! WHO WAS FOLLOWING US, BUCKY?!”

“Wizards,” Bucky said simply. “They work for HYDRA and they planned on taking you back to their base for execution. A thank you wouldn’t kill you.”

Harry laughed hysterically at Bucky.

“Thank you?!” he repeated. “You want me to thank you for throwing away my dad‘s cloak, killing my friend, and kidnapping me to save me from WIZARDS WORKING FOR HYDRA?! Fuck you,” Harry spat. “You’ve fucking lost the plot, mate.”

“I thought you didn’t like Peter?”

Harry laughed again and slammed his head backward, hitting the cool glass window.

“Does it matter?” Harry asked tiredly. “You killed him, Bucky. You killed a kid.”

Bucky killed Harry’s first New York friend. And Peter… Harry closed his eyes and swallowed hard when his throat clogged and a prickling feeling began in the back of his eyes… Peter had been trying to help Bucky.

Peter was another Cedric…

 

“He’s- he’s insane.”

“Take my body back to my parents.”

 

Harry was a plague. If Peter had been a hero while he swung around with his webs, saving little old ladies from muggings and girls being beat up by abusive boyfriends, then Harry had been the villain who ultimately led Peter to his death.

 

“Together, we’ll take the cup together.”

“Take him to the old bakery down the street from my place.”

 

“Are you crying? Harry?”

Harry jolted at Bucky’s voice. He opened his eyes and had to blink a few times to see Bucky looking at him in the rearview mirror again, his blue eyes concerned.

“No,” Harry lied. He reached up with heavy arms and wiped his face off. “I’m great, really, this might be the best day of my life. It’s right up there with the time my uncle dislocated my shoulder.”

Which had actually hurt a lot less than knowing Peter was dead did.

“Smartass,” Bucky scoffed. “That kid isn’t dead, by the way, I saw him on the news.”

“What?” Harry lifted his head while his heart rate picked up. “You saw Peter on the news?”

“Yeah, in that costume he wears,” Bucky said. “He’s with Tony and Steve. You’re, uh… officially a missing person.”

Harry closed his eyes for a moment, hoping that Bucky wasn’t just saying more crazy shit and that Peter was actually alive. The thing was, even though Bucky was acting crazy, he actually seemed as sane as he had the first time they met. Bucky seemed to swing between complete madness and perfect sanity, and Harry used to be able to tell the difference between the two.

Clearly, Harry was a shit judge of character.

“How long have we been gone?” Harry asked Bucky, picking up on the fact that Harry was a ‘missing person’.

“About twelve hours.”

Harry nodded slowly. “And where are we?”

“Memphis.”

Harry had been learning to fly when other kids in primary learned about world geography and Midtown didn’t exactly teach basic geography either.

“Where is Memphis?” Harry asked, trying to imagine a map of the States in his head.

“Tennessee,” Bucky told him. “We’re about three hours from Texas.”

Texas was easy, even Harry knew where Texas was.

“Is that where we’re going?” Harry asked, working hard to stay calm so he didn’t set Bucky off.

Bucky sounded calm, completely in control, when he answered. “Mier is our final destination. I know some guys down there, they’re not allied with HYDRA.”

“Right… right… and Mier is in Texas?” Harry asked.

“Mexico.”

Harry closed his eyes while he inhaled slowly, holding it for a few seconds, then exhaled.

“I AM NOT GOING TO FUCKING MEXICO!” he yelled, causing Bucky to jerk the wheel and smack Harry’s head on the window.

“Bucky, turn around and take me home,” Harry said harshly, his eyes watering from the smack. “We do not need to go to Mexico. We need to go home.”

Home where Sirius could fix Harry’s leg before he was some sort of permanent cripple.

Home where Harry could go dig in every dumpster in New York until he found his dad’s cloak.

Home where Harry could see that Peter was alive.

Home, Harry just wanted to go home.

Harry could be in his bed with Joey curled up on his not-shattered legs and they could sleep in since it was Sunday. Then Harry would spend the day catching up on homework, maybe watching Tony tinker on stuff in his lab, they’d have dinner with Sirius and whoever else was around, and Harry wouldn’t be in a car with a crazy person and a broken leg and no phone and his dad’s cloak in a bloody dumpster.

“Everything’s going to be fine,” Bucky said calmly, sounding rational instead of completely psychotic. “I have to get you to a safe location then I can complete the mission and you can go back, okay?”

No.

Not okay.

Not okay at all.

With very few options currently available though, Harry leaned his head back and closed his eyes, hoping he could teach himself apparation before he needed to learn Spanish. Or, at a minimum, if Harry could figure out how to wandlessly stun Bucky, then that would be nearly as good.

In… out…

Tony was probably panicking. He seemed like a panicky kind of person…

In… out… clear your mind…

Hermione was going to worry when Harry didn’t call her…

Let your thoughts drift away…

In… out…

Harry’s only heirloom from the man who died to save Harry as a baby was in a dumpster…

In… out…

Peter had been bleeding, so much…

Sirius might be freaking out…

Pepper was probably upset…

Childishly, Harry wanted his dad rather badly just then.

 

After what felt like an hour without Harry accomplishing even a weak light in his pinky finger, Harry opened his eyes when the car turned and began slowing down.

“Where are we?” Harry asked dully, rather resigned to be the unwilling participant in Bucky’s insane scheme.

“We’re just changing out cars before places start opening up,” Bucky said. He glanced up and met Harry’s eyes in the mirror and raised his eyebrows. “You want food and something for the pain?”

“Yes to food and no to being high,” Harry scowled. “I’m hoping eventually you’ll wake up from your episode and we can discuss going the fuck home.”

Bucky sighed and Harry truly couldn’t understand how rational he seemed. The last few times Bucky had been… having one of his episodes… he’d sounded frantic and mad, like Sirius when they met in the Shrieking Shack.

“Yeah, sure, we’ll go back to New York so those wizards can kidnap you and Tony can kill me,” Bucky snorted. “Anyone ever tell you that you suck at making plans?”

Harry had to breathe very, very, slowly to keep from absolutely screaming at Bucky. Just because Harry was bad at plans didn’t mean that Bucky ‘I stabbed a teenager and threw away your priceless heirloom’ Barnes was good at them.

Bucky pulled up to a car lot that had the lights off and the lot filled with vehicles.

“I’ll grab a van so you can keep your leg stretched and get some rest,” Bucky said, as if that was meant to be comforting. “Keep quiet, I’ll be right back.”

Harry nodded obediently and the second Bucky disappeared in the building of the car lot, easily breaking down the door, Harry scrambled out of the car.

Putting weight on his leg was a very special kind of hell, but Harry had done more on a broken leg before and he wasn’t going to fucking Mexico. They had passed a fuel station not far from the lot and that was the direction Harry began hobbling in.

Once he realized that he wasn’t going to win any races with his leg strapped to a board, Harry put all his weight on his right leg and bent down and ripped the blue board off.

Fucking Buck—

“Sonofabitch,” Harry swore under his breath when he stepped forward with his left foot and the world swam in alarming way in front of him.

Harry wasn’t a doctor by any means, but he would bet his Firebolt that his leg was in worse shape then than it had been after the third task.

Bucky should just crucio me and really replace Voldemort… Harry thought uncharitably as he grit his teeth and struggled onward.

The fuel station was close, Harry could see the sign all lit up in the sky, Harry just needed to get there. Someone would have a phone…

Harry was struck with the sudden realization that he didn’t know anyone’s phone number.

Why, WHY, had he never bothered memorizing anyone’s phone number?!

It was fine… Harry could call 999 and Tony was famous, surely it wouldn’t be that difficult to get it figured out that Harry was his son. Harry even had…

Nope.

Harry checked the pockets of the basketball shorts Bucky must have put on him (a mortifying thought that Harry couldn’t even worry about at the moment, which said a lot about his current circumstances) and didn’t feel his wallet anywhere. Which meant Harry had no ID, no money, and a fucking broken leg.

Just keep walking, he encouraged himself, dragging a leg that didn’t want to move. Quickly.

To Harry’s immense surprise, he finally made it to the fuel station and managed to drag himself to the automatic doors. As soon as he made it inside, Harry zeroed in on the bloke wearing a red polo behind the front counter and grimaced while he walked up to it, leaving a trail of blood that seeped through his bandages behind him on the previously clean linoleum floors.

“Can I use your phone?” Harry panted as black spots began popping up in his vision, breaking up the face of the wide eyed cashier gawking at him. Harry had to lean on the counter as his left leg shook and refused to move another centimeter.

“It’s- it’s against policy…” the man stammered, clearly caught off guard by Harry’s appearance. “Are you- are you okay?”

Harry blinked a few times, trying to dispel the black spots that were dancing in front of him, and lost his temper. “DO I FUCKING LOOK LIKE I’M OKAY, MATE?! I HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED BY A MANIAC WHO STABBED MY FRIEND AND ROBBED A BLOODY AMBULANCE AND MY LEG IS BROKEN AND I NEED TO CALL MY DAD!”

“Sir, you need to calm down,” the man said, backing away from Harry quickly. “I’m going to need you to leave the store or I’ll call the police.”

“Excellent,” Harry sneered. “Call them, please. GO!” he yelled when the cashier was just staring at him. “Tell them to call Tony fucking—”

“Howard! There you are!”

“Oh, god.” Harry groaned and slid down to the floor, his legs splaying out awkwardly, when he heard Bucky enter the fuel station.

Bucky walked straight up to Harry and smiled over at the cashier, as if he weren’t a stark raving lunatic.

“Sorry, man,” he said casually. “My brother and I wrecked our car, I think he hit his head a little too hard. He must have taken off while I was getting a rental.”

“He needs a freaking hospital,” the guy said. “And a straight jacket.”

Yeah, because Harry was the madman in that situation.

“I am not your brother and don’t touch me,” Harry spat at Bucky when he bent down to grab Harry’s shoulders. Harry reached over blindly and grabbed the first thing he could reach from a nearby shelf, a white coffee mug with a guitar on it, and swung it at Bucky’s face.

“Concussion, probably,” Bucky called to the cashier as he easily dodged Harry’s attack. “Where’s the closest ER?”

Harry tried to punch Bucky when he lifted him, making a fist as Steve once taught him to do, but the blow bounced off the side of Bucky’s head as if it were as inconsequential as a fly.

Bucky nodded along to the cashiers directions and Harry writhed in Bucky’s tight grip- infuriated to be lifted up like a child and horrified that his grand escape plan had failed.

“Thanks, man,” Bucky said, speaking over Harry’s shouts for someone to call the damn police. “Sorry about the inconvenience, have a good one.”

Harry, who was the only one being inconvenienced, bared his teeth in a feral snarl at the cashier as Bucky carried Harry bridal style out of the fuel station.

“Look, I know you’re freaking out, but you’re hurt and you’re not thinking straight,” Bucky murmured as he quickly carried Harry to a dark blue minivan. “I swear, as soon as it’s safe, I’ll take you back, okay?”

“I hate you,” Harry moaned. Bucky scoffed and opened a sliding door on the van and carefully placed Harry in the back. The seats were all folded down and, aside from a couple of bags of what was probably food, Harry had plenty of space to lay out his leg.

“Missions aren’t always easy,” Bucky said drily before closing the door. Once he was in the drivers seat and started the van, he spoke up again. “We’ll get out of here and I’ll reset your leg. You can’t walk on it, kid, you’ll do irreversible damage and you really don’t want to have it amputated.” Bucky held up his left arm, the metal one, and wryly added, “Trust me.”

Harry angrily snatched one of the bags and pulled out a black hoodie that he wadded up and decided to use as a pillow.

“I’d rather have a peg leg than deal with your bloody delusions,” Harry said sharply, no longer worrying about upsetting Bucky. “HYDRA didn’t send wizards to kill me. You’re a lunatic, Bucky. You need help.”

Much, much, more help than Harry could give him, clearly.

Bucky didn’t seem bothered by Harry’s increasingly rude comments, he just calmly pulled out on the interstate before pressing hard on the gas and flying too quickly for Harry to even read the signs they passed.

“You think I don’t know that I’m messed up?” Bucky asked Harry. “I live in my own fucking head, Harry. It’s not exactly a picnic up here.”

“Wah,” Harry said mockingly. “Poor Bucky and your trauma. Mate, MY LEG IS BROKEN!”

“My arm is metal.”

“You kidnapped me.”

“I saved you from wizards.”

“You stabbed my friend.”

“You said you hated him and he’s fine, remember?”

Harry scowled and used the hoodie as a pillow so he could lean his head back and close his eyes. “I never should have been nice to you.”

Bucky laughed, “I don’t know why you were. But,” he turned around and Harry peeked one eye open to see that Bucky was giving him an earnest sort of look, “you were the first person in a long time to treat me like a human being. I can’t let you die, not like Howard. I won’t let them take you.”

Harry blinked, caught off guard by the quiet and solemnly spoken words. Then a sharp pain shooting up his leg reminded him that Bucky was a maniac.

“I hate you,” Harry repeated, only slightly less venomously than before. “You’re tying to give me Stockholm Syndrome and it’s not going to work.”

Bucky laughed again, loudly and genuinely that time, and switched the radio on after turning back to the road.

“Did you learn that in psych class?” he asked over the sounds of a heavy rock song that Harry actually liked.

“No,” Harry said mulishly, trying to find a way to lay that didn’t make him want to scream. “Hermione told me it once. And I’m starving.”

“So here’s the thing, I’m broke,” Bucky said with a shrug. “There’s chips and pop in those bags. If you want, I can stop somewhere and grab something else.”

“Steal something else you mean?” Harry sneered. He didn’t actually have anything against theft, but it was the principal of the matter just then. “Like you did the medical supplies and the cars and me?”

“Yup. Just like that.”

Harry closed his eyes and desperately tried to will himself to sleep or spontaneously apparate back home.

 

It wasn’t the worst kidnapping of Harry’s life, but he’d certainly had better days.

Chapter Text

Sunday, November 4

Twenty-four hours.

It had been twenty-four hours since Tony’s son had went missing.

And how one man and one teenage boy went missing in a country that was being torn apart by the Avengers, every cop on every damned police force, and even the National Guard with interstate checkpoints set up, Tony had no idea.

Barnes was a genius, a trained professional, and he had Harry.

“He’s dead…” Tony mumbled to himself as he paced the floor of his office, trying to think clearly. “That’s the only way they couldn’t have found him by now… Barnes killed him and my son is in a ditch somewhere, probably in little tiny pieces…”

“Tony, stop.” Rhodey stepped in Tony’s path, halting his pacing, and grabbed his shoulders tightly. Tony blinked and focused on Rhodey’s solemn face, the bags under his eyes nearly as heavy as the ones under Tony’s eyes.

Nobody had stopped to sleep, nobody stopped to eat, nobody stopped period.

Sirius and Spider-kid were apparating across the country, turning in information on Harry and Barnes to all police precincts and trying to find any hint of Harry.

Pietro and Steve had went to Montana to stake out the house Barnes had previously been using.

Pepper and Bruce were manning the phones, fielding calls and trying to filter out any real leads.

Nat and Clint were traveling from car lot to car lot, trying to get ahead of Barnes as he kept swapping out cars on what was the most nonsensical path to Montana that Tony had ever seen.

Rhodey was guiding the Guard on their stops, moving them around when new reports of stolen cars came in, and Tony?

Tony’s one grand contribution to the cause had been calling Peter’s aunt and asking her if Peter could stay and help him contact Harry’s friends and go places he might visit, getting parental approval for Spider-kid to join the search.

After that, Tony had lost his ability to think clearly somewhere around hour nineteen when he began thinking worst case scenario.

Worst case scenario was that Barnes killed Harry and then himself and Tony lost the chance to save his kid and destroy Barnes with his bare hands.

“He’s dead,” Tony told Rhodey bleakly. “Rhodey, what if he’s dead?”

“Don’t do that to yourself,” Rhodey said firmly. “Why would Barnes have taken a new car in Dallas if he killed Harry?”

“BECAUSE HE IS INSANE!” Tony yelled, his voice breaking. “He is crazy and he has my son, Rhodey. My boy, my only child.”

Barnes had Tony’s entire world and he wasn’t even making hostage demands. And this was one of those times that Tony would give anything - money, legal pardons, his jet… hell, Barnes could have his suit if he wanted it - to get Harry back.

“We’ll get him back,” Rhodey said, a promise he couldn’t keep and they both knew it. “This isn’t—”

“TONY! HURRY!”

Tony wrenched himself from Rhodey’s grip and ran as quick as he could to the living room. They’d transformed it to a call taking and tracking center somewhere around hour twelve with the furniture all pushed away and tables covered in tablets, laptops, and phones to take all tips and scour every street camera for Harry or Barnes.

Bruce had something pulled up on a screen floating above the table and waited until Tony entered the room, Rhodey on his heels, to start the video.

“This was from four am,” Bruce told Tony. “We just found it with facial recognition software. They were in Tennessee. Watch.”

Tony held his breath and watched what looked like security footage from some twenty-four hour truck stop. There was nothing aside from a pimply guy with greasy blonde hair working the counter and then—

“Harry.”

“Oh, God.” Pepper groaned in her seat and Tony absently moved to stand behind her, putting his hands on her shoulders and squeezing when they saw Harry enter the station.

Harry looked rough, he looked so damn rough. His face was bruised, scraped up on one side, all the more obvious by the paleness of his skin. Worse though was his left leg… his leg was wrapped in some sort of white bandage soaked in blood and Harry looked like it was a struggle to even move it.

“What happened to his leg?” Pepper asked tearfully.

Bruce paused the video and zoomed in, easily clearing away the pixels with a few clicks of a button.

“Fuck,” Rhodey breathed.

Fuck was about right.

Harry’s left leg was swollen, seeping bright red blood, and even Tony could see that there was something wrong with the lower part of his leg. Harry was dragging it and it didn’t seem as if the knee bent at all.

Tony didn’t know if he wanted to cry or scream.

Barnes was a dead man.

“He’s been beaten to hell,” Tony said, cataloguing every bruise, every blood drop, every mark on his son’s body.

Every single mark was going to be drawn out of Barnes in his own blood.

“Press play,” Pepper ordered Bruce, sounding as choked up as Tony felt. She reached up and clenched one of Tony’s hands tightly and Tony just knew she felt as horrified and helpless as he did while they watched their kid drag himself inside a gas station.

Harry practically collapsed on the front counter, his breath coming in heavy and uneven waves.

“Can I use your phone?” Harry asked the young man. Harry’s left leg was shaking hard and Tony couldn’t imagine it was going to hold him up much longer.

“It’s- it’s against policy… Are you- are you okay?”

“DOES HE LOOK LIKE HE’S OKAY?!” Pepper shrieked. “MY KID WAS RIGHT THERE AND HE DIDNT LET HIM USE A PHONE BECAUSE OF POLICY?!”

Tony nodded mutely, filled with fury and concern, too overwhelmed to even make the obligatory stepmom joke.

Harry’s face looked almost as pissed off as Tony was.

“DO I FUCKING LOOK LIKE I’M OKAY, MATE?! I HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED BY A MANIAC WHO STABBED MY FRIEND AND ROBBED A BLOODY AMBULANCE AND MY LEG IS BROKEN AND I NEED TO CALL MY DAD!”

Oh God.

Harry had been right there, trying to call him.

And some god damned twerp with greasy hair and a twangy voice had stopped him.

It felt like watching the worst horror film of Tony’s life.

The cashier seemed terrified of Harry as he backed away quickly, bumping in the rows of cigarettes behind him and knocking a few off the shelf.

“Sir, you need to calm down. I’m going to need you to leave the store or I’ll call the police.”

“CALL THEM!” Tony and Pepper both screamed.

“Excellent,” Harry sneered right at the cashier. “Call them, please. GO! Tell them to call Tony fucking—”

“Howard! There you are!”

Tony’s hands tightened so hard on Pepper’s shoulder that it had to hurt when Barnes jogged in the truck stop with an easy smile on his face and called Harry ‘Howard’.

Howard…

“Why would he call your son by your dad’s name?” Rhodey asked, echoing the same question they all had.

“He was close to Steve back in the day, right?” Bruce said. “Harry looks a bit like the photos of Howard I’ve seen…”

Harry did and it was a logical train of thought to have, but…

“But that means Barnes thinks Harry is Howard,” Pepper said slowly.

“Which means he’s completely deranged,” Tony said tightly. Deranged meant dangerous. Dangerous meant that anything could happen to Harry… as seen by the kid’s busted leg.

Barnes didn’t sound like a psycho when he chatted with the cashier while he tried to pick Harry up from where he’d slid on the floor.

“Sorry, man. My brother and I wrecked our car, I think he hit his head a little too hard. He must have taken off while I was getting a rental.”

“He needs a freaking hospital and a straight jacket.”

“Oh I want his fucking name and home address,” Tony snarled under his breath. Yeah, Harry looked pretty damn wild with the blood and the screams, but Harry was the child.

Harry was the child screaming about being kidnapped and that cashier did nothing.

“I’ll deal with him,” Pepper said harshly, patting Tony’s hand reassuringly while they watched the scene unfold.

“Good,” Tony said, dropping a chaste and fond kiss to the top of Pepper’s head without taking his eyes off the video of his son.

Harry snapped off at Barnes and grabbed a coffee mug off the tourist crap shelf and swung it hard at Barnes’ head.

“Good boy,” Rhodey said approvingly. “Shame Barnes seems to have a head made of metal.”

Tony made a sound of agreement, proud of Harry for trying and disappointed in the lack of results.

The four of them listened while Barnes asked about directions to a hospital - Bruce already began typing away and shook his head when Tony looked toward him - and Harry screamed for someone to call the police.

Barnes carried Harry out in his arms, like the concerned sibling he was pretending to be, and the video ended.

“Switch to the parking lot footage,” Rhodey ordered Bruce, as the only person in the room able to think clearly.

Bruce did it quickly, swapping just in time for them to see Barnes carrying Harry to a dark blue minivan and talking to him quietly.

“Look, I know you’re freaking out, but you’re hurt and you’re not thinking straight. I swear, as soon as it’s safe, I’ll take you back, okay?”

“Does he think he’s protecting Harry?” Pepper asked.

“Who knows? The guy’s a fucking whack job,” Rhodey said.

“I hate you,” Harry moaned.

God, Tony’s chest was aching with how terrible Harry sounded. The kid had to be miserable- in pain, scared, alone…

“I’m sorry,” Tony said hoarsely. He should have done more, tagged more of Harry’s belongings, done something more to keep his kid safe.

“Missions aren’t always easy,” Barnes told Harry before he slid the van door shut and Tony lost sight of his son.

Tony had never needed a drink so badly in his life, but he couldn’t drink while his son was missing.

Tony couldn’t do anything until his kid was home.

“He’s alive,” Bruce said when everyone was silent with similarly grave expressions. “If Barnes thinks he’s saving Harry, then he’s safe for now.”

“Tell that to Harry’s fucking leg,” Tony snapped. He spun around, unable to be around anyone that wasn’t his son, and stormed to his office. As soon as the door slammed shut behind him, Tony lost his composure and began throwing anything he could grab.

Barnes had Harry and Harry was hurt and Harry tried to call Tony and some god damned moron kept him from doing so and Tony needed his son home.

Tony never wanted kids, never. And then he had one anyway; a witty, sarcastic, funny, bright, perfect kid.

And Tony only had five months with his son… five too short months and now Barnes had him and Tony didn’t know if he’d ever see him again.

 

By the time Tony’s office was destroyed, Tony hit his knees in the middle of the floor and cried for the first time in years.

Harry’s damned dog came crawling out from beneath Tony’s desk with its tail tucked between its legs to wrap around Tony and lick his cheek despondently.

“I want him back too,” Tony said brokenly. He pulled the dog closer and hugged it as tightly as he wished he could his son. “I want him back too.”

The dog whined in tangent with Tony’s cries; two miserable beings wondering when the center of their world would return… if it would.

Peter had always wanted to travel, he’d always dreamt of seeing more than just New York.

He just hadn’t wanted to do it on a search and rescue mission for Harry.

Peter groaned quietly when Sirius magically teleported them to a new city- this one in south Texas, skirting around the border.

Originally, they’d thought that Bucky would take Harry to Montana, but then Peter realized that Steve - Mister Red, White, and Blue himself - was either a complete idiot or was trying to help his old friend escape.

The path that Bucky had taken, the path they could definitely track since the guy kept stopping to jack new cars every hundred miles, looked more like he was headed to Mexico than he was Montana, so that was where Peter and Sirius were searching.

But then again the dude was a freaking psychopath so Peter didn’t feel real good about his intentions one way or another.

Peter told Harry that Bucky was dangerous, he freaking told Harry to stay away from him. But did Harry listen? No. Because Harry seemed to like danger.

Damned secret keeping, brave, dumbass.

A secret keeping, brave, kidnapped dumbass that Peter was kind of pathetically in love with.

“Wait out here,” Sirius told Peter when they walked from the small wooded area they’d teleported to over to the huge police department. “You seem sick, maybe sit for a minute,” Sirius added with a grimace.

Peter was sure he looked sick, he had to be green in the face, because teleporting (Sirius called it ‘apparating’) was about the most nauseating experience of Peter’s life and they’d done it probably fifty times in the last twenty-six hours.

“Good call,” Peter said weakly. He dropped on a bench outside the precinct and didn’t even think before he ripped off his mask to try and get some air.

It wasn’t like his identity was some big secret anymore, not now that he’d been added to the freaking Avengers as an honorary member for Team Find Harry.

God, Peter was such an idiot. He should have known Bucky was going to come back. He did know that Bucky was dangerous and he just laid on the floor while Bucky knocked Harry out and dragged him away.

Nobody seemed to blame Peter, but Peter didn’t feel real great about it. He’d wasted time to get Harry the hell out of there with flirting.

“Idiot,” Peter groaned, burying his face in his hands. “Selfish, stupid, idiot.”

Peter jumped on the bench when Queen started singing about friendship out of nowhere. It took him an embarrassing amount of time to realize that it was Harry’s phone in his suit pocket ringing. Peter pulled the phone out, idly curious about who Harry assigned the song to, and saw a photo of his friend with the bushy hair and dark skin grinning on the screen.

Peter hesitated for a moment, unsure if he should answer or not, and then finally clicked the screen to answer the video call.

“You’re not Harry,” Hermione Granger said immediately. “Where is he?”

Peter wasn’t exactly sure how to tell one of Harry’s best friends that he was missing, but it seemed like he didn’t need to.

“Did you know #Stark’sMissingSon is trending on Twitter?” Hermione demanded hotly. She was glaring harshly at Peter, like she somehow knew it was his fault that Harry was missing.

“Harry doesn’t use Twitter,” Peter said, sounding just as stupid and evasive as he knew it would sound.

Hermione’s brown eyes narrowed and Peter actually felt the urge to cringe.

“That’s because Harry grew up in a closet and has been dealing with nonstop trauma for fifteen years, WHERE THE HELL IS MY BEST FRIEND?!”

“DO YOU THINK I’VE GOT HIM HIDDEN IN MY FREAKING POCKET?!” Peter screamed back, taking his frustration out on the wrong person. “I WISH I KNEW WHERE HE WAS, BUT I DON’T! I’M SORRY!” Peter’s voice broke, “I’m so freaking sorry. I’m sorry.”

“Oh, Peter…” Hermione sighed and her look of fury melted to one of concern that Peter didn’t deserve at all.

“Peter?” a rough male voice said. “Give me the phone.”

Peter ducked his head and swiped his face off with his sleeve when Hermione had her phone hijacked by Harry’s other friend, the red headed guy, Ron.

“What the hell did you do to Harry? He wouldn’t just run off for no bloody reason!” Ron snapped furiously. His ears and cheeks were as red as his hair which only made his blue eyes shine more brightly in his anger.

“He didn’t run off, Ronald, the news said he was kidnapped,” Hermione said, fighting Ron to take the phone back.

Peter looked up while they struggled and saw Sirius bolting from the precinct, waving a disc around.

“I swear to god that I will call you as soon as I know anything,” Peter told Harry’s friends. “I have to go.”

“I hate you!” Ron yelled.

“Oh, shut it,” Hermione said. “B—”

Peter hung up on her and jumped up, eager to see what Sirius had.

“They were here!” Sirius said, waving the disc victoriously. “C’mon, let’s get back to Tony’s place so we can see. They found the footage at a rest stop!”

“What are you waiting for?” Peter grabbed Sirius’ shoulder tightly, preparing himself for the sickening trip back to New York. “Let’s go!”

Sirius turned on the spot and Peter was transported through a tube clear from Laredo back to New York City.

*****

“Tony!” Sirius was yelling the instant his feet touched the ground. He had what felt like the first break in finding Harry they’d had in over twenty-seven bloody hours in his hands and he held it up eagerly.

A shiny silver disk that Sirius was certain contained some sort of clip of Harry if his crummy Spanish was right.

The officer seemed to recognize the photograph of Harry and James anyway, seemed as if they’d made some sort of fuss that got caught on security tapes.

The sitting room of Tony’s flat had been transformed completely. The sofas and little tables had all been cleared away, making room for two long tables covered in more electronics than Sirius had ever seen in his life.

It wasn’t really saying much, since Sirius just got his first phone over the summer, but—

“Put the disc in,” Peter was saying, shoving Sirius toward a small telly screen on the table.

Sirius blinked and stumbled when Peter pushed him.

“Right, sorry,” Sirius said, sounding slurred. His brain, his body, his magic had all been taxed in the last twenty-seven hours and Sirius was going to have to grab another Pepper-Up to get him through until he found his godson.

And Sirius had to find his godson.

Sirius couldn’t even bloody breathe until he found his godson.

Tony came tearing in the room, looking just as wrecked as Sirius felt, and his head whipped wildly back and forth between Sirius and Peter.

“You found something?” Tony asked. Tony’s hair was standing on end, there were bags heavy enough to hold the entire damn building under his eyes, and it seemed like everyone was going to politely pretend not to see that he’d been crying his heart out recently.

Not that Tony was alone in that, but Sirius was more emotional than Tony was; nobody seemed surprised to see Sirius crying nonstop since Harry had been kidnapped by a bloody lunatic.

“Yeah, maybe.” Peter ripped the disc from Sirius’ hands and stuffed it in some little slot for it, pulling up a video on the feed for all of them to watch.

Peter, who wasn’t as bad of a bloke as Harry recently made him sound, pushed Sirius in a chair and fetched him a mug of hot coffee that smelled like heaven.

“You too, Tony,” Rhodey, a good mate of Tony’s, said, pushing Tony in the chair next to Sirius.

It was good that Sirius had Tony - the only person who loved Harry as much as Sirius did - sitting beside him because Sirius thought he was going to break when Bruce turned the video on.

At first, all Sirius saw was a giant truck with a long white bed on the back sitting outside a little rest stop building.

Then everyone leaned forward intently when a silver van pulled in and screeched to a stop right next to the semi.

James climbed from the drivers seat and dashed over to the drivers side of the semi and climbed up, opening the door, and dragged the driver right out by his black shirt collar.

Sirius wasn’t the only one who gasped when James began wailing on the man with his silver arm flashing in the dusk.

“Merlin,” Sirius breathed. “No wonder they had the video for us.”

Once the truck driver’s face was mashed to something that looked more like ground beef than a human, James just tossed him to the side and went back to his van.

Sirius reached out blindly, desperate to find someone to grasp on to and wound up clenching Tony’s arm tightly, when James pulled Harry from the van. Peter made a broken sound and Sirius reached out with his left hand to find the kid’s shoulder, holding him just as tightly as he did Tony.

“Almost there, kid,” James told Harry’s unconscious, bruised, bloody, and broken body. Harry was limp in James’ arms and Sirius bit down on his tongue to keep from sobbing.

Harry looked half-dead.

Sirius had seen him after he came back from being tortured, being forced to duel Voldemort, from seeing a classmate die, talking to his dead parents- and Harry looked more alive then than he did in that video.

Sirius’ heart was breaking and he was so bloody useless.

“He’s got to be withdrawing by now,” Bruce said quietly. “Adderall and Lexapro have short half-lives…”

Sirius didn’t know what that meant, but he knew Harry had to be miserable.

“What is he doing?” Pepper asked on Tony’s other side. They watched James carry Harry around to the back of the truck and toss open the hatch before carrying him in.

“Mother fucker,” Tony said. He flicked a finger and paused the video and spun around to point at Rhodey accusingly. “He’s smuggling my son out of the country, Rhodes!”

“In a potato truck?” Peter asked, seeming just as confused as Sirius was by the quick way Tony and Rhodey were both pulling their phones out and making calls.

“Potato’s?” Sirius asked blankly. Peter pointed at the screen and used his fingers in a pinching motion to zoom in on the side of the semi on the logo.

“R & G Potatoes,” Peter said.

“And that’s proof that James is taking Harry out of the country?” Sirius asked, feeling like the dumbest person in the room.

“Why else would he be hiding the kid’s body in a produce truck twenty miles from the border?” Tony muttered quietly, typing away on his phone. “God, FUCK YOU, STEVE!”

Sirius was quiet when they watched Tony throw his phone at the wall, shattering it.

“You’re a moron,” Sirius said hoarsely. “What if Harry calls?”

Sirius had to believe that Harry would call, Harry would come back to them.

Sirius had to believe that his last conversation with his godson hadn’t just been about flying and sushi.

Sirius had stepped back so much, leaving space for Harry to bond with his dad, and now Harry was gone and Sirius didn’t know if he was coming back.

“You’re a moron if you think Harry’s calling,” Tony said flatly, his voice as lifeless as Harry looked in that video. “He’s probably gone in shock, septic from the- the injury… withdrawals are going to be making him sick… and now he’s BURIED IN A GOD DAMNED SEMI WITH POTATOES BEING SMUGGLED FROM THE COUNTRY!”

Sirius inhaled sharply, prepared to scream right back at Tony, and then Sirius just crumpled. Sirius crumpled forward and Tony caught him and then they were two grown men sitting at a table with a room full of people watching them sob their broken hearts out.

“Our kid,” Tony sobbed, grasping desperately on Sirius’ back.

“Our Harry,” Sirius cried right back, clutching the only person who understood the way that his heart was apparently in a potato truck being moved to Mexico.

 

It was a kindness and a curse when the two of them cried themselves out and their bodies shut down right at the table after over thirty hours of no sleep and non-stop work and anguish.

*****

Stephen stood in the lobby of Stark Tower, irritated once again by Stark’s tardiness.

The man acted as if he hadn’t been the one to schedule his son’s unimaginably important lessons every single Monday afternoon at four.

“Excuse me.” Stephen stepped up to the receptionists desk and gave a polite enough smile to the woman working there. “I’m supposed to be meeting Harry Stark. Should I—”

“Oh.” The woman sighed and looked around furtively before leaning toward Stephen and lowering her voice. “Didn’t you hear?”

There was no way the kid was dead, Stephen would have seen it before then. But the woman sounded stricken.

“Hear what?” Stephen asked her, punctuating his words with a bite of impatience.

“Harry was kidnapped,” she whispered. “It’s all over the news! I heard they think he was taken to Mexico and sold for parts.”

Stephen stared at the woman and decided that Stark must have hired her for her breast size instead of her brains.

“Harry Potter-Stark was kidnapped, taken to Mexico, and you think he was sold for parts?” Stephen repeated. He gave her what he hoped was an absolutely disdainful look. “What public school did you drop out of?”

The woman reared back, her red glossy lips opening in an insulted little ‘o’.

“Excuse me, maybe you should watch the news,” she said snappily. “Harry’s been missing since Saturday afternoon.”

Stephen took a very deep breath, working to remain perfectly calm and serene. Surely, surely, Tony Stark was at least half as smart as he bragged about and would have called Stephen if Harry Potter-Stark went missing.

Had Stephen not explicitly stated that he didn’t take on students and had made a single exception for the one person who was destined to become the greatest sorcerer to walk the earth?

“Thank you,” Stephen told the receptionist. “If you’ll excuse me.”

Stephen flicked his fingers around, opening a portal up, and stepped through to shortcut his time taking the elevator up to Stark’s flat.

“Is Harry missing?” Stephen demanded, skipping pleasantries, when he exited directly in Stark’s living room.

The room told him that Harry was actually missing and apparently Stephen allowed himself to be employed by an absolute oaf. It had been a bad weekend to spend teaching Wong the fine skill needed to dominate beer pong while they discussed the new research from Cameroon about the existence of the fabled Soul Stone.

Stephen needed that Soul Stone, but he needed Harry Stark and Stark had lost the future greatest sorcerer to live.

The woman who ran Stark’s company, Pepper Potts, sat at a table, talking rapid Spanish to someone.

“Harry Stark,” Miss Potts was saying, “niño desaparecido. James Bucky Barnes, secuestrador. No! No, hermano!”

Stephen looked toward the other occupant of the room, Bruce Banner, the brilliant scientist who managed to accidentally turn himself into a giant green gamma monster.

“Tony’s there now, blasting holes in every semi he finds, you’ve got to find something before he makes Iron Man a national menace,” Banner was saying to someone on the phone rather quickly. “Pietro, I don’t care if you drag Steve by the hair, get your asses to Mexico.”

For the love of…

“Miss Potts, pleasure.” Stephen pressed a button, hanging up Miss Potts’ call, and offered her a wide smile and his hand. “Where, precisely, can I find your employer?”

“Torreón,” Banner said, moving the mouth of his phone away to tell Stephen while Miss Potts just gawked at him in a disturbing and sleep-deprived way.

“Excellent, thank you,” Stephen said cordially before opening a new portal and stepping directly out in the harsh heat of Torreón.

Stephen had believed that Stark was a brilliant man and devoted father, and yet he managed to neglect to so much as text him when his child was snatched and hidden away.

Just because he had some second rate wizard on his team and Stark thought that Stephen Strange wouldn’t be a quick fix to finding his son?

Idiot.

It was shocking that Harry seemed to have a modicum of intelligence, clearly he got it from his mother.

Chapter Text

Harry was lying flat on his back on an uncomfortable bed, staring at a bland ceiling, willing himself to either apparate back home or die.

Everything in Harry’s body ached, everything in his body felt like it was just shutting down… it was agony, pure agony.

Harry was sweating and shivering, twitching and shaking, too much to even grab one of the bottles of water Bucky left in the motel he dumped Harry in. There were bags and bags of food, but Harry hadn’t been hungry since before he got buried in potatoes.

When Harry lifted his head to try and grab the water - it was so bloody hot, Harry hated Mexico - he caught sight of his left leg and then felt as if his brain got zapped and he dropped his head right back down to the pillow.

There was probably a phone somewhere in that room and Harry couldn’t even move to find it. Harry couldn’t even force himself to slide sideways on the bed to keep from vomiting on the same pillow his head was on.

Harry didn’t need a doctor to tell him that the skin of his leg turning a mottled black pattern clear up to his thigh or the blood spewing from his mouth weren’t exactly signs of excellent health.

“Who knew potatoes would one day kill you, mate?” Ron would say with a bracing smile and a brotherly pat to Harry’s back if he were there.

Harry could picture him sitting beside Harry’s bed, just like he always had every time Harry had been in the hospital wing. Ron was always there for Harry when it counted and he didn’t leave him then either.

And where Ron was, there was always…

“Don’t be insensitive, Ron,” Hermione scowled, always on the boys to mind their manners. Hermione was exactly like what Harry imagined an older sister would be like; bossy and naggy, but always for Harry’s best interests. “Harry, you know I’ve read about injuries like yours before and I’m quite certain that there’s high levels of success in recovery. Oh! I should go find the research on past cases!”

Harry looked toward Sirius, needing his reassurance that Harry wasn’t shutting down and drifting away. Sirius was always there to reassure Harry.

Sirius was always there, full stop.

“Siri?” Harry croaked with his dry throat. “‘M gonna be fine, right?”

Sirius smiled widely at Harry from where he sat on the dresser, swinging his legs childishly.

“Of course you are, kiddo. You didn’t survive your bastard uncle and a horntail just to be killed by a few potatoes,” Sirius laughed carelessly. “You’re tough, Harry. You’re going to be fine.”

“It was not a ‘few potatoes’!” Peter snapped at Sirius. He sat beside Harry on the bed and held Harry’s hand tightly. “That psycho buried him in hundreds of potatoes to sneak him over the border! He probably crushed his organs!”

It did feel as if Harry’s organs had been crushed. None of them seemed to be working right and Harry didn’t know when Bucky would come back, if he would come back.

“We are never buying potatoes from that company again,” Pepper promised Harry. She stroked his hair, just like Harry imagined a real mum would, and smiled down at Harry. With her teal eyes and nearly red hair, Harry could almost imagine she was his mum; holding him when he was sick like Petunia did for Dudley. “You do have to eat other vegetables though,” she added with a playful smile.

Harry smiled around at everyone, grateful they were all there. But none of them were the person he wanted to see the most.

“Where’s my dad?” Harry asked them all, searching for his dad’s face, so similar to his own. It was hazy in there, probably from the heat, and Harry twitched from another jolt in his brain and then whined weakly at the pain the twitch caused in his leg.

“He’s coming, baby,” Pepper swore while she kept stroking Harry’s hair. “He’ll be here soon.”

“He needs to hurry, right?” Harry asked her, blinking through the haze and the tears to search Pepper’s eyes for the truth. “If he doesn’t hurry…”

“He’ll hurry,” Sirius swore gently, dropping the teasing tone when he must have seen how sick Harry really was.

“That’s what Bucky said,” Ron scoffed. “‘Don’t worry, Harry, I’ll be back soon and the mission will be over’, how are we supposed to believe them?”

“We believe Tony because he never lies to Harry and Bucky is suffering from a break with reality,” Hermione huffed. “It’s entirely different.”

“I- I need my dad now,” Harry said, hating himself for being so pathetic. He sniffled and couldn’t even feel any tears on his face even though they had to be there. “I think- I think I’m really sick.”

Harry had been sick a lot of times in his life, but never ‘black skin, puking blood, lightning striking his brain at random intervals’ sick.

“I’ve got to tell him what Bucky said,” Harry remembered, looking over at Pepper. “He needs to know about HYDRA and Howard.”

“We’ll tell him,” Pepper said. “Just rest, try and breathe, okay? We’ll see him soon.”

“Soon,” Peter repeated. He squeezed Harry’s hand and gave him a crooked smile that made Harry’s heart race and his skin to sweat even more. “It’ll be real soon, Bright Eyes.”

“Swear?” Harry asked him.

“Swear.”

Harry closed his eyes and tried to find a comfortable position on the thin motel mattress.

“‘M gonna sleep now,” Harry to everyone. “Don’t leave…”

“We won’t,” Pepper promised. She kissed Harry’s forehead, right on top of Harry’s scar and Harry felt his chest hitch at the warm maternal affection. “We love you.”

“Love you,” Harry murmured back. He didn’t think he’d have a lot of chances to tell them, so he said it again just in case they didn’t hear him the first time.

“Love you.”

 

Harry wished he knew what time it was… what day…

“How long have I been gone?” Harry asked Ron.

Ron checked his watch and frowned. “I think my watch broke, I’m sorry, mate, I’ve got no idea.”

Harry sighed and then shivered, his body shaking with some mixture of a horrible fever and sweat that soaked him from head to black-toe.

“Black-toe,” Sirius snorted. “Sirius Black and his godson, Harry Black-toe.”

“Cute,” Harry said, working to banter with Sirius as easily as they used to. “You’ll be- be…” Harry’s witty retort failed him when his body began shivering hard enough that his teeth were chattering.

“Your dad will be here so soon,” Pepper promised. “You can have a hot shower, a good meal, and—”

“And your medicine, Harry James,” Hermione said firmly. “These are probably those withdrawals I sent you the information about before. I told you not to stop taking them.”

“It’s not like he had a choice,” Peter said heatedly, defending Harry like Harry could see he’d always tried to do. “Sorry his kidnapper didn’t grab his meds before they went on the run.”

“I hate him,” Harry murmured weakly. “My- my leg… it doesn’t hurt anymore…”

“That’s good!” Ron said cheerily. “That means it’s not as bad as it was!”

“Or it’s like fifty times worse than it was,” Peter said logically. He was so smart that it sometimes made Harry feel insecure, like he felt around Hermione occasionally. Like maybe Harry could have been a genius if he’d spent his childhood focusing more on school and less on not getting beaten by his relatives.

“It should hurt, I can see the bone again,” Peter added.

“And the skin is as black as my dear old mum’s heart,” Sirius snorted. “That can’t be good. It’s definitely going to hurt your chances of getting laid anytime soon, kiddo.”

Harry tried to laugh, since he was sure that was what Sirius wanted, but something was wrong with his lungs and he couldn’t.

 

“Oh, shit.”

Harry tried to open his eyes to see who was talking then, but they wouldn’t cooperate.

“‘M sl-sleepin’…” Harry told them, his words slipping out with a tongue too dry to properly use. “Shh…”

“It’s time to wake up, kid, we need to get you home,” the new person said snappily, a familiar tone that Harry couldn’t place. “Actually, scratch that, I’m taking you straight to Metro-General and an operating room. That’s eschar necrosis. We’re going to have to move quickly if you want to keep it.”

Harry didn’t want to keep anything. The mission hadn’t ended and Harry didn’t think it was going to anytime soon.

“Don’t thrash, we can end up in the wrong realm if you do that.”

Realm…

Harry didn’t actually know what that meant.

“Here we go…”

Harry let out an unholy screech that hurt even his ears when his body was grabbed with calloused hands that seemed as if they were trying to be gentle.

“I know, kid, I know. You’re in for a fight, let’s move.”

 

All Harry was aware of in the next couple of seconds was a grateful shift from heat so oppressive that it had filled his lungs to somewhere cool and so loud that Harry wanted to scream.

“I’ll tell them to be quiet,” Hermione promised Harry. “You need to rest now.”

Hermione scolded everyone until the noise became a distant fuzzy sound in the background, leaving Harry alone with the people he loved.

“‘S my dad here?” Harry asked her hopefully.

“Soon,” Sirius promised.

Harry whined and whoever carried him began running, jolting him around and causing everything to send shooting pains through his body like walking on a foot fallen asleep did.

“Bright Eyes, stay awake,” Peter said. “Want me to quiz you on chem or tell you about this jerk trying rob a gas station with a curling iron?”

“Gas station, please,” Harry said. He forgot about the story and screamed instead when something cut his chest open. Pepper was there immediately, smoothing his hair off his forehead.

“You’re at a hospital now,” she said. “I think it’s your tutor, Strange, working on you.”

“You think?” Harry asked. “You don’t know who’s stabbing me in the chest?”

Pepper smiled sadly down at him. “I only know what you know, baby.”

“I heard them say it’s a chest tube,” Hermione said smartly. “It’s really a fascinating—”

“He’s here!” Sirius yelled. “Kiddo, your dad‘s here!”

All at once, the spell Hermione must have used to mute the sounds around Harry failed and he became painfully aware of several people screaming around him.

“WAIT! SIRIUS CAN SAVE IT! STOP! LET HIM TRY!”

“THERE IS NO SAVING IT, IF WE DON’T GET IN THERE NOW ITS GOING TO EAT AWAY HIS ORGANS!”

“TWO SECONDS, STRANGE. TWO SECONDS!”

“YOU HAVE ONE! Palmer, do not move him yet. Understand? I’ll grab the wizard.”

“He’s in— and he’s gone.”

Harry tried to speak but something was over his mouth, stopping him. Everyone was screaming and then Sirius was there and he was crying—

“I- I don’t know any spells or potions for this… we- we usually just heal it right away. Maybe if I could get Snape or Albus…?”

“He does not have time,” someone, Hermione whispered it was Harry’s teacher, Strange, snapped. “Stark, listen to me, if we do not take that leg off now the infection is going to spread to his heart and kill him, if the sepsis doesn’t leave him brain dead.”

“Take my leg?!” Harry looked up at Ron and saw his own terror reflected back at him. “Mate, they’re joking?”

Ron shook his head, eyes wide. “No way, mate. They won’t take your bloody leg. That’s… that’s mad, that is.”

“Kid, Harry, can you hear me?”

Harry tried to answer, he knew that voice. That was his dad even if he sounded like he was choking on something.

“I love you, Harry,” his dad whispered urgently in Harry’s ear. “I’m so sorry; Harry, I’m so god damned sorry.”

“Oh, he’s crying,” Hermione said sadly. “He loves you, Harry.”

“Of course he does,” Sirius laughed. “What’s not to love about a little smartarse Tony Junior, eh?”

“Go,” Tony said to someone out beyond where Harry could see him. “Just- save him. Please, God.”

“Black, you’re in with us,” Strange said curtly. “Whatever we can heal with magic, we will.”

“Aren’t you a bloody wizard?”

“Sorcerer, it’s different. A touch more prestigious.”

“IS THIS THE TIME?!” Someone, a woman, yelled. “His systolic is 197, Stephen! He’s going to stroke out!”

“Let’s move,” Strange said.

Harry felt someone holding his hand, someone real and solid. And then, just a moment before everything went black, they let go of Harry’s hand.

 

Harry wished they hadn’t.

Harry didn’t even get to see his dad.

 

“How’s he doing?”

“He’s not waking up, Rhodes. And… and look at him.”

“He’ll wake up soon, Tony. His body’s been through hell, just give him time.”

“Have they found Barnes yet? I’m going to—”

“Not yet. Strange said he isn’t attuned to Barnes like he is Harry, or some crap like that.”

“Keep me updated?”

“Sure. Get some sleep, he’s back now.”

“Is he?”

 

Was he?

 

Harry shifted around at some point, struggling to understand what was happening. He couldn’t talk, something was choking him, and his eyes wouldn’t work.

“Hey, hey, take it easy, you’re okay,” someone said soothingly. “I’m going to remove the vent, hold on.”

Something burned in Harry’s throat, ripping itself from his body.

“Someone page his dad, tell him he’s awake.”

Harry opened his mouth, a weak croak had replaced his voice. “Dad?”

“He’s coming, sweetie,” someone said. There was a warm rag across Harry’s face, gently washing his eyes. “Can you—”

“He’s awake?!”

Harry could open his eyes then - he stood on his feet when he thought Voldemort was going to kill him and he managed to walk three blocks on a broken leg, Harry could open his eyes to see the face that voice belonged to.

“Dad,” Harry breathed.

There he was, finally.

Ron, Hermione, Pepper, Peter, and Sirius were gone and Harry’s dad was there.

Tony dropped to his knees beside Harry, bringing his tired and lined face even closer, and Harry saw that his hazel eyes were bloodshot and wet and there.

“Harry,” Tony said. His eyes welled up and Harry saw a tear zigzag down his cheek. Tony tilted his face forward until his forehead touched Harry’s.

Harry was still tired, exhausted clear to his bones, but he forced himself to stay awake to tell Tony… something… something important…

“Dad,” Harry said, wincing at the way his throat burned. “Buck-Bucky…”

“Sh…” Tony’s arms were wrapped around Harry’s torso, causing a storm of pain and relief to mix through Harry’s body. “I thought I’d lost you…”

Harry was shocked when Tony’s shoulders began shaking with sobs. Tony seemed so relieved to have Harry back that he was actually crying.

Tony was crying like his heart had been broken and Harry being with him repaired it somehow.

Nobody, nobody, had ever loved Harry so much.

Harry was sure of that.

Chapter Text

Wednesday, November 8

Tony jerked from a restless sleep, reaching out instinctively to touch Harry, feel his son’s clammy skin and reassure himself that he was alive.

Harry was alive.

Harry was safe.

Harry was so fucking sick that Sirius and Strange combined weren’t able to keep the infections from popping up and the withdrawals from rocking through Harry and making him sick.

And…

Tony’s eyes traveled down Harry’s body, stopping at where both legs should be beneath the blanket and now there was only one.

Tony had been a parent for less than a year and he couldn’t even keep his kid in one piece.

Harry’s groaned, a weak sound that made Tony want to scream, and his eyelashes fluttered.

“Dad?”

“I’m here,” Tony said immediately. It made him feel so damned guilty that every time Harry woke, it was Tony that he asked for. Harry opened his eyes and Tony tried to smile for his benefit.

“Are you thirsty?” Tony asked. He grabbed a styrofoam cup filled with water and stuck a straw in it so Harry could drink without having to lift his head up. “Here, you- you need water.”

And a leg.

And a better parent.

And Barnes to be in eighty different pieces.

But Harry was going to have to settle with water.

Harry took a small sip and then struggled to sit up, something Tony was quick to help him with. After Harry laying there lifelessly with occasional bouts of orientation that was dimmed by Harry talking to nobody, Tony was just happy to see him looking more alive.

“Where’s…” Harry cleared his throat and blinked around the room with hazy eyes. “Where are we?”

“The hospital,” Tony said. He grabbed the chair beside Harry’s bed where he’d lived since they got Harry set up in a private room for recovery and pulled it right up against Harry’s bed to sit in.

Tony, who could count on one hand the number of times he had ever felt nervous, began babbling anxiously, trying to fill Harry in on everything all at once.

“Strange was the one who found you,” Tony told him. He grabbed Harry’s hand when it moved toward where his leg once was and squeezed it until Harry looked at him. “You were in a motel, in Mexico. Barnes- Barnes dumped you there and took off, we think. We’re still trying to find him, but Sirius and Strange have been working together to get you better, so that’s kind of taken priority.

“You were septic, kid. And… and that break you had wasn’t set right, there was a blood clot and it caused necrosis to set in.”

Harry’s voice was raspy, unsure, but Tony had never heard anything so beautiful in his life.

“Bucky… Bucky fixed it…” Harry said. His eyes flicked away from Tony’s face to his lower body and he frowned. “He said he’d done it before, in the war.”

World War II, clearly. Because Barnes’ method of fixing the break he caused had let to emergency amputation. Good old Uncle Sam didn’t start teaching the troops better methods until after they sat back and wondered why so many troops had to have amputations when they came home.

Tony reached over with his free hand and turned Harry’s face back to his own, terrified to break the news to him.

“Your kidney was damaged,” Tony told him in a rush. “And the infection in your leg was traveling quick, quicker from the dehydration. And…” Tony had to swallow hard when he saw Harry’s right leg wiggling in his peripheral vision. “They couldn’t save your leg, Harry. I’m sorry.”

Harry’s eyes widened all at once and he ripped his hand from Tony’s with more strength than Tony thought he would have.

Tony’s metaphorical heart shattered at exactly the same time Harry yanked his blanket off himself and let out a horrified scream at the bandaged stump just below his knee.

 

It was touch and go after that.

 

Harry’s vitals kept improving, a regimen of magical potions, medicine, and treatments were constantly trying to return his body to the health had had just a week ago.

But Harry had completely checked out mentally.

Tony couldn’t get him to talk when he was awake, Harry just stared at the ceiling with dull green eyes that used to sparkle with laughter and mischief.

 

Sirius came and went, spending all his time split between searching for Barnes and trying to coordinate treatments for Harry.

When he came, he talked and joked with Harry, doing anything to make him reply.

Harry ignored him just as much as he did Tony.

 

Pepper came and sat on Harry’s bed, stroking his hair and whispering soft assurances to him that they were going to find a way to replace his leg and that what was important was he was alive.

Harry cried then, but he still didn’t say anything.

 

Tony was damn close to sending his jet to Hogwarts, having Sirius snatch Harry’s best friends and bring them to see him. Surely those same kids that called and text every day, asking for constant updates, could get Harry to respond to someone.

By Friday, Tony decided to do just that. Harry was medically cleared to be discharged, his recovery fast-tracked with the apparently nearly unbeatable combination of modern science and ancient magic, but Harry hadn’t spoken or ate anything since Wednesday.

Strange had Harry hydrated through an IV, Sirius had him fed with nutrition potions he spelled directly in his stomach, but Tony watched as Harry slipped further and further away.

 

“Miss Granger,” Tony tried to force a smile for Harry’s friend, but it kept falling up short. “Have your classes ended for the day?”

Hermione looked as terrible as Tony felt, which was sad, yet Tony was kind of glad to see that Harry’s friends cared so much for him.

“Yes, sir, and I had a question—”

“Please come,” Tony said in an urgent whisper. “Harry’s gone completely silent and I can’t get him to talk, Sirius can’t, Pepper can’t…”

And if Harry didn’t start speaking soon then Tony was going to lose his mind.

“Oh thank goodness,” Hermione sighed and gave Tony a small smile. “I asked my Head of House, Professor McGonagall, if Ron and I could come this weekend. I was rather hoping you would approve as she already applied for the portkey.”

“I really wish Harry wasn’t gay because you would be a perfect daughter-in-law,” Tony said with his own heavy sigh. He looked through the window in Harry’s room and saw that he was still just laying on his bed, not speaking.

Harry’s wildly overpaid therapist had assessed him, the hospital psychiatrist assessed him, the best neurological experts had assessed him, and they all said the same thing-

Harry was in shock.

Harry went through a trauma and needed time to recover.

Harry could go home and recover there.

“Give him time.”

If Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley could shorten that time Harry needed, Tony would build them their own freaking floor of the tower.

Hermione laughed and blushed like every teenage girl ever. “I’ll let Professor McGonagall know you’ve given us permission. May I call you back in about half an hour?”

“Perfect. Thank you,” Tony said earnestly. He looked at his kid again and felt his heart break a little more. “Just- hurry.”

Once Tony finished talking with Hermione, he went and signed the discharge papers for his kid. It was technically against medical advice, but Tony could give Harry an IV and Sirius could give him potions when he got home if he still wouldn’t eat or drink anything.

The doctor Strange assigned to Harry’s case, Doctor Palmer, gave Tony a list of physical therapists that Harry could work with, groups for amputees, and a quiet reassurance that Harry would recover.

Tony ignored everything she said and sent Happy a message, telling him to bring up Harry’s brand-new-and-yet-to-be-tinkered-with wheelchair.

Tony’s son was in a damned wheelchair because Tony hadn’t kept him safe.

 

A few minutes later, it wasn’t Happy who came pushing a chair off the elevator, but Harry’s friend, the Spider-Kid, with a mysteriously invisible barking sound coming from the seat of Harry’s chair.

“Tony—”

Apparently they were on a first name basis. Side effect of accidentally adding a sixteen year old to the Avengers.

“—I’ve got something you’ll like in your office,” Peter said with a crooked grin that did nothing to take away the exhausted black bags under his eyes.

“Yeah?” Tony looked down where the barking was coming from. “I’m guessing it’s not a dog?”

“Nah.” Peter stretched up to look in Harry’s room and Tony saw his smile dip. “I… I thought he was cleared to go home?”

“He is,” Tony sighed. He ran his hand through his hair, only mildly disgusted to feel the grease beneath his fingers that was proof of Tony living in the hospital with Harry the past few days. “He’s exhausted and- and I think he’s in shock.”

“I- I would have came sooner, but I couldn’t leave Bucky out there,” Peter said quickly. He didn’t need to explain himself, everyone wanted Barnes found, and it wasn’t like—

“But I found him so I’m here now.”

“Wait!” Tony scrubbed his face with his hands and actually made an effort to focus on Peter. “You found Barnes?”

“Yeah.” Peter’s eyes were burning and his smile became more sharp, sharing Tony’s enthusiasm for seeing Barnes suffer long and hard.

He was growing on Tony, just a smidge.

“He’s in your office. Don’t worry, he’s not really in any kind of shape to escape,” Peter said with a flash of smugness in his eyes. “Pietro, Clint, and Psycho are all there just in case.”

Tony laughed so hard it nearly sounded like a sob then.

Strange and Sirius had been scouring the Earth to find Barnes. Bruce and Rhodey had the damned military searching for him, even Clint and Nat had been using all their resources from their time in the field to find Barnes and it was Peter- this awkward, shaggy-haired kid with some spider bite induced powers and a fucking skateboard that found him.

“I could kiss you,” Tony said with frank appreciation. “Come on, you get the honors of seeing if that dog will get Harry up.”

Peter looked like he won some sort of prize - and he did, actually, a $500,000 prize - when he pushed the wheelchair in Harry’s room and dramatically whipped Harry’s cloak off the dog and plopped them both right on Harry’s lap.

“Hey, Bright Eyes,” Peter grinned down at Harry when Harry blinked slowly at the dog licking his face.

Tony checked his phone quickly, reading one from Hermione and sending one to Sirius.

Professor McGonagall will portkey us to your house after dinner. We should be there at two your time. Thank you.

She was rather polite for a teenager… Tony preferred Harry’s snark. The quick text to Sirius was a necessity, as Tony didn’t want his kid anywhere near Barnes. It burned even having him in their home, but Peter did good taking him there really.

I’m bringing Harry to your place. Expect a gaggle of teens soon.

Hermione got a thumbs up response and Sirius sent a shooting star.

“This was in the trash?”

Tony looked up quickly and saw that Peter Parker was apparently a fucking miracle worker in more ways that one. He had Harry sitting up, his overgrown dog curled up in Harry’s lap, while Harry ran his fingers over every inch of his cloak.

Had Barnes taunted Harry about throwing away his cloak or had Harry been awake when he did it? Either option was crap, but Tony could get his answers soon.

“Uh…” Tony tried to act casual, as if his kid came back from a catatonic state every day, and reached over to feel around the silk fabric until he found the tiny little chip he’d attached to one corner. “I put a tracker on it.”

Tony would apologize, but he wasn’t actually sorry at all and he tried not to lie to his son. The very second he could figure out how to attach an operable and invincible tracker to human skin, Harry would have it on him.

Nobody was going to take Tony’s son from him ever again.

Harry looked up at Tony and Tony had never guessed how much that single sheet of magical cloth meant until Harry looked like Tony saved Harry’s first born child.

“It’s from- from James…” Harry said, clearing up any mystery on why he looked ready to cry.

“Good thing he had it chipped then,” Peter said brightly. “Hey, they said you’re free now. You ready to go?”

Harry’s reverent expression shuttered closed immediately and Tony’s heart sank.

Peter wasn’t daunted by Harry’s quick return to silence though. He moved the dog off Harry’s lap, setting it on the floor which had to be against at least three hospital policies, and then bent down to grab Harry.

“Stop,” Tony said quickly, his pulse speeding up in a way he was too tired to pick at. Peter hesitated with his arms extended toward Harry and Tony quickly moved him aside. “I’ll do it.”

Harry clenched his jaw and shut his eyes when Tony carefully lifted him from the bed - Jesus Christ, if Tony thought he’d been too light before, it was nothing to what he weighed then - and sat him down in his chair.

“And for the finishing touch!” Peter grabbed the wriggling dog from the floor and put it on Harry’s lap, right on top of the cloak Harry hadn’t let go of. “Perfect.”

Tony saw the way Harry kept his jaw clenched and his fingers tightly wound around the dog’s collar and doubted if Harry thought anything was perfect, and Tony could almost agree.

Except just the fact that Harry was alive and going home was perfect enough.

And perfect enough was probably going to be the name of the game for a while.

*****

Harry had made the noise everyone made around him entirely meaningless for the car ride home. He could see Peter talking, his eyes lit up with enthusiasm for something while he spoke, but Harry didn’t want to hear it.

Tony sat beside Harry, one arm wrapped around Harry’s shoulders, and Harry made that meaningless too.

Harry kept looking down and feeling immediately off balance and dizzy with the way one of his legs ended at the knee, the fabric of his sweats loose and empty beneath it.

They took his leg.

They took his fucking leg.

In all of Harry’s worst imaginings - Bucky snapping and strangling him, suffocating beneath a pile of potatoes, wasting away in a bed in a country where Harry didn’t even understand the language - Harry never expected that he’d lose a leg.

And lose was a stupid word to use, really. Harry didn’t misplace it, he didn’t set it down somewhere and forget where it was… they cut it off him.

Someone made a decision that Harry’s fucking leg wasn’t important and cut it off.

Even Joey knew Harry was wrong. He curled up on Harry’s lap, burrowing in the cloak that wasn’t in the garbage, and kept poking his nose where Harry’s leg used to be.

 

Harry managed to make every word Tony and Peter said completely meaningless all the way up until they pulled in the garage and a familiar voice broke through the barrier Harry built around himself.

“HARRY!!”

Harry’s head snapped up from where he’d been staring at his stump, and saw Hermione and Ron standing in of the doors to the lift, running directly toward the car.

“Who…” Harry had to lick his lips and swallow hard to make his words sound like actual words and not hollow croaks. “Who called them?” he asked, feeling sick to his stomach.

“They’ve called us, about fifty times a day,” Tony said slowly. “I thought you’d like to see them?”

Harry was grateful that the car windows were tinted a dark black, but he wished Peter wasn’t in the car with him at that moment.

“No,” Harry said shortly, turning his head to the side and pressing it hard against Tony’s shoulder, hiding the tears he knew were coming.

“Hey, Pete, why don’t you take them up to Sirius’ place?” Tony said, somehow understanding that Harry didn’t want them around him.

“Yeah, okay,” Peter said.

Harry kept his face turned away, desperately trying not to scream, and waited for the car door to shut behind Peter.

“Tell them to go,” Harry said bleakly. He’d wanted to see Hermione and Ron so bad- so bloody bad -but not like that.

It was bad enough that Peter and Pepper and Sirius had all seen Harry laying pathetically in a bed, too weak to move and too miserable to even speak.

Hermione and Ron were two of the only people left that Harry had that only had memories of him when he’d been an entire person.

Harry had thought that a little scar on his forehead made people see him differently? What were his best friends in the world going to say when Harry only had one leg?!

“Freak.”

That was what they were going to say and Harry didn’t want to hear it- Harry didn’t want to hear it from anyone.

It was easier to just drift along in his own head than look at anyone’s face and see their pity or hear their sympathy and disgust in their voice.

Harry didn’t have the energy to snap off at people, he didn’t need the adrenaline from a spat to wake him up. Harry just wanted to be left alone.

And Hermione and Ron came clear from Hogwarts to see him.

“Hey… hey…” Tony leaned away from Harry enough that he could snake his hand between them and lift Harry’s chin up, forcing Harry to look at his face.

There wasn’t pity in Tony’s eyes, but the depth of concern hurt nearly as much.

“I love you,” Tony said, easing the band around Harry’s lungs that Ron and Hermione’s presence brought.

“But if you want them to go, you have to kick them out yourself.”

Harry jerked his chin from Tony’s grip as the band snapped right back around Harry’s lungs.

That was fine; Harry set his jaw and clenched his cloak tightly in his hands. If Tony wanted Harry to go up there then he was going to have to drag him.

“Nobody’s going to think less of you,” Tony said. “It’s not like it’s your fault, kid. They- they love you, you know? That girl, Hermione? She’s been bugging the hell out of me and Pete said that Ron has even figured out texting just to…”

Harry stopped listening to what was probably an earnest and well-intentioned speech right after Tony said it wasn’t Harry’s fault.

It was Harry’s fault.

Buc- nobody pushed Harry from that car, that had been all Harry.

Harry broke his leg and then they cut it off him as punishment for being so ungodly fucking stupid.

And now Harry was some freak with a stump for a leg and his friends wanted to see him and Harry couldn’t face them.

 

Except Tony wasn’t going to give him an option apparently.

 

Tony got out of the car then came around to Harry’s side and reached in and grabbed Harry as if he weighed nothing (Harry wondered how much his leg had weighed) and lifted him from the car.

“I told you before, I don’t know how to be a good parent,” Tony said quietly while he put Harry in a wheelchair.

Harry had a lot of injuries in his life, but he’d never suffered the indignity of being pushed around in a wheelchair.

“But I do know that those two kids have been at least thirty percent as worried as I was and I think you’ll feel better if you see that they aren’t going to treat you differently,” Tony went on. “It’s not like I’d know anything about coming back from a kidnapping with a destabilizing injury though, so feel free to ignore me.”

Harry did.

The closer they got to the lifts, the more Harry felt as if he were going to be sick. In a desperate, and rather pathetic, move, Harry took his cloak from his lap and covered himself in it and held Joey as tightly as he held his eyes shut.

Harry knew it was childish, cowardly, but nobody seemed to understand that Harry could not lose the last two people who only knew Harry before.

Before Harry tried to help someone who didn’t deserve it.

Before Harry jumped from a car.

Before Harry cried and clawed himself beneath piles of potatoes, panicking and thinking he was going to die.

Before Harry paid the price of his idiocy with his leg.

They knew the Harry who could have been worth something one day.

And now Harry didn’t even know Harry anymore.

 

Tony kept up his stream of encouragement during the ride up and Harry blocked it out while he breathed in and out, slowly and steadily, reminding himself it was only dark because Harry chose for it to be.

 

“It’s only twenty miles then I’ll get you out, okay? This is all going to be over soon, I swear.”

Maybe it had been Harry’s crap prior education or the way that converting miles to kilometers never made sense to him- but those twenty miles had felt like the longest and darkest trip of Harry’s life.

Every bump they hit had caused the weights on Harry’s chest to rise up just enough that he could almost take a full breath and then slam back down.

If Harry ever had to smell the earthy and damp scent of a potato again, it would be too soon.

*****

Tony had been so confident that bringing Harry’s friends to see him would bring some small measure of joy to his kid and he clearly couldn’t make a single damned decision right for his son.

When the elevator doors opened for Sirius’ floor, Tony really wished he could just take Harry up to his room and let him stay there. (Un)fortunately, there was a piece of human garbage at their place that needed disposed of - in tiny, indistinguishable, pieces - before Harry could actually go home.

Between forcing Harry to be in the same area as his friends or the man who kidnapped him, broke his leg, beat the hell out of him- it was an easy choice.

Even if Tony felt like an ass when he pushed Harry from the elevator to the living room where Sirius, Hermione, Ron, and Peter were all waiting.

Hermione jumped up from the couch and looked anxiously from Tony’s face to the footrest of the chair where the toe of Harry’s yellow hospital sock could be seen.

“We’ve got him,” Ron said, easily getting up from the couch and coming over to grab the handlebars of Harry’s chair from him with a smile. “Oi, mate, ready?”

“Ron!” Hermione shrieked and Sirius and Peter grinned when Ron took off across the room with the chair and immediately popped it up in a wheelie.

Tony sidled up to Sirius while he listened hard to pick up a small huff of air from Harry beneath his cloak.

“I need an hour,” Tony told Sirius from the corner of his mouth.

Sirius nodded shortly, his eyes sharp where they watched Ron and Hermione with the chair. “Peter told me. I’ve got Harry, go give him hell.”

Tony watched as Harry’s foot twitched and his dog slid off his lap, landing on the floor with a yelp that had Hermione smacking Ron’s arm and taking Harry’s chair, pushing him toward the kitchen.

Tony watched as Harry remained hidden under his cloak, refusing to be seen by the two friends he once went back to a place he hated just to be near.

It was agony.

And it was Barnes’ fault.

“Oh, I will,” Tony swore.

Hell was the least of what Tony was going to bring down on Barnes’ head.

 

Tony stormed off the elevator at his place, his suit in place aside from his mask, prepared to tear apart Barnes until he was nothing more than a nightmare Tony expected he and his son would share for quite some time.

“Move,” Tony said shortly to Clint and Nat. They stood outside his office door with their arms crossed, hopefully standing guard and not trying to stop Tony.

It would be a shame to have to hurt them- but Barnes was in that room and Tony would do what he had to do to get to him.

Clint stepped aside immediately, his face shining with a harsh sense of approval.

“You want help?” he offered, the only white flag Tony needed to repair their once strong friendship.

“He wants to do it alone,” Nat said. She looked Tony dead in the eyes and he saw understanding in hers. “Steve didn’t know.”

“Don’t talk to me about Steve,” Tony spat, even the name leaving a bad taste in his mouth. “Move or I’ll move you.”

Nat smirked, stepping over beside Clint and leaving the door unblocked.

“I’d like to see you try,” she said. She winked just before Tony opened the door so he liked to think that was another bridge that could be repaired eventually.

It would be good to have his entire family back; or, at least the ones he could still trust.

 

“Oh, that boy’s got my blessing when he asks for it,” Tony breathed to himself when he stepped in his office. Peter Parker was a godsend and if Harry decided that he didn’t want to date him again, Tony might just adopt him.

Pietro was sitting at Tony’s desk, his feet propped up on the desk, a pleased smirk on his face.

“He is rather clever for a child,” Pietro drawled.

They both looked up at the ceiling where Barnes was stuck with the webbing that Peter used. All that was visible of Barnes was his face that was so bruised and swollen that it nearly didn’t look human. A steady stream of blood dripped from his face to the floor, leaving a bloodstain in the center of Tony’s white carpet.

“Your work or Peter’s?” Tony asked Pietro without any real curiosity. He didn’t care who beat the hell out of Barnes, he was just glad they did.

“Clint and Peter,” Pietro said simply. He got up and stretched his arms over his head, placing a black pistol he’d been holding on Tony’s desk. “You have your opportunity for revenge, do not let it pass you.”

Tony glared up at Barnes and felt hate like he had never experienced before well up in his chest.

Tony hadn’t even hated Stane as much as he hated Barnes.

Barnes took Tony’s entire world from him, beat the hell out of, then dumped his body in another country where Harry would have died if it weren’t for Strange.

Tony owed Stephen Strange his life just as much as he owed James Barnes a slow and painful death.

“Peter said he had this with him,” Pietro said, kicking a black duffel bag on his way out of the office. “Enjoy your torture, Tony Stark.”

Tony nodded absently and kept his eyes on Barnes’ unconscious face while he dragged the duffel bag over by his desk. Tony retracted his gloves and picked up the pistol and spun it around in his hand, watching Barnes and imagining the most painful ways to destroy the man.

Tony wanted Barnes to feel as miserable as Harry did.

Tony wanted Barnes to feel like he had to hide from people like Harry did.

But Tony wanted Barnes to be awake for it. And since Peter had made sure Barnes wasn’t going anywhere, Tony could wait.

With the right incentive, Tony could be a patient man.

Sirius once said that he didn’t understand why Tony didn’t just kill Harry’s uncle that had abused him and stuffed him in a closet and Tony couldn’t properly explain that there was a small, spiteful, violent part of his brain that knew death was too quick and easy for some people.

Vernon Dursley was in a prison the last time Tony checked. Dursley was living in a cage that was larger than the one he put Tony’s son in, but a cage nonetheless.

And Barnes was going to wish Tony only wanted to kill him by the time Tony was finished.

With perfect clarity in his mind, Tony pulled the slide back on the pistol and aimed it up at Barnes. It was almost amusing, searching for Barnes’ left leg beneath the thick webbing Peter had stuck him to the ceiling with. Once he was reasonably confident he found it, and grateful to be the top floor apartment, Tony held the gun steady while he shot Barnes in the knee and woke him up.

Just because Tony could be patient, didn’t mean he had eternity to wait.

His son needed him.

“Morning,” Tony said casually when Barnes’ eyes opened wide and no scream came from his mouth. A new stream of blood began dropping from the ceiling, staining the webbing a satisfying dark red. “I’ve been looking for you.”

“K-kid,” Barnes said, working real hard to talk with the way his teeth looked like bloody chiclets.

“Kid?” Tony repeated, working hard to keep the fury from his voice. “You don’t mean my kid, do you? Because I’ve got to be honest here, you really don’t want to talk about MY KID to me just now.”

Barnes spit out a mouthful of blood and his eyes were wide and frantic. “He’s sick,” he said roughly. “Needs a—”

“A doctor?” Tony flipped his glove down on his left hand in one smooth motion and shot a warning laser just beside Barnes’ head, sizzling a hole through the ceiling.

“Yeah, he did,” Tony said. “And whose fault do you think that was? Huh? WHO LEFT MY SON TO DIE IN A FILTHY MOTEL IN ANOTHER COUNTRY?!”

“I saved him,” Barnes said, spitting another mouthful of blood, that time directed at Tony. “They were going to kill him!”

“WHO?” Tony demanded, screaming in his burning anger. “Because the only person that tried to kill Harry recently was YOU!”

“The wizards!”

“Wizards?” Tony laughed and knew it sounded hysterical and bitter. “You mean his godfather who has worked his ass off to save his life or his teacher who brought him back home? WHICH ONE DO YOU MEAN?” Tony demanded, shooting another hole on the opposite side of Barnes’ head.

“The ones with the tattoos!” Barnes yelled right back. He sounded as insane as he looked and Tony hated, hated, that his kid had been exposed to a lunatic with super serum in his veins that Tony’s own father had created.

“Oh, I am so sorry,” Tony sneered. “A wizard with a tattoo? You’ll have to be more specific.”

Tony could see where the webbing was starting to come loose from Barnes’ weight and his wriggling. And the second it came loose, Tony was going to grab him and slam his head in the floor until he couldn’t even think the word ‘wizard’ again.

“I saved your kid, we’re even now,” Barnes said flatly. “You don’t believe me? Check the bag.”

Equal?

Apart from the deranged lunacy that was Barnes thinking he in any way possible ‘saved’ Harry, what made them uneven to start with? Because Tony slept with Sirius after their shitty date ended?

“How were we uneven to start with?” Tony asked slowly, desperately hoping he hadn’t been the direct cause for Barnes to take Harry. When Barnes didn’t say anything, Tony shot him in the leg again, only a couple inches lower than where the first bullet landed.

“HOW WERE WE UNEVEN?!” Tony yelled, pissed as hell when Barnes didn’t so much as scream. He would bet that Harry screamed; Harry probably cried too, and Tony knew Harry hated to cry.

“Check the damn bag,” Barnes said through a clenched jaw. “Open it, go on.”

Tony didn’t take his eyes or pistol off Barnes while he reached down with his other hand to open the duffel bag, his incessant curiosity getting the best of him.

“JARVIS, you there, buddy?” Tony asked, keeping his eyes on Barnes in case it was a ploy to escape.

“Yes, sir.”

“What’s in the bag?” Tony asked, not liking the satisfied look in Barnes’ eyes. Anything that made Barnes happy, Tony was certain he was going to really freaking hate.

 

“I believe it is three human heads, sir.”

Chapter Text

Friday, November 10

Hermione sat on the floor of a rather posh and tidy flat, clutching Ron’s hand tightly, staring sadly at where she knew Harry was sitting.

The three of them had been through so much together—

Saving the stone.

Hermione being petrified and the boys fighting a basilisk.

Keeping Sirius and Buckbeak from death.

Harry fighting off hundreds of dementors.

And recently it felt as if Harry had to do everything alone—

Fighting a dragon; Hermione may have helped him study for it, but it was Harry standing so tiny in that arena.

The third task and facing Voldemort.

And now…

Now Harry wouldn’t even come out from beneath his cloak when all Hermione wanted to do was see him.

“Ginny says she misses you,” Hermione told Harry quietly. “She’s been—”

Ron nudged Hermione hard with his shoulder and shook his head. He raised an eyebrow and Hermione bit her lip with a nod, no quidditch, she forgot.

It was a convenient method of silent communication that Hermione and Ron had perfected after so many years of friendship.

“Mate, you’re going to laugh your arse off when you see what all the twins have done!” Ron said with what Hermione knew was forced cheer. “I dunno where they got the money from, but they’ve really expanded their inventory!”

“They are menaces and if they don’t stop testing products on first years then I’m going to tell Professor Moody,” Hermione huffed, rather peeved by the twins and their antics. Not that it was important in the slightest at the moment, but Ron shouldn’t find it as amusing as he did.

“Oh, that’d be excellent,” Ron said with a wistful smile. “Imagine it, Mione, just… bam! And Fred and George are ferrets.”

“Weasels would be more appropriate though,” Sirius snorted from where he and Harry’s (friend? boyfriend?) Peter sat at the little kitchen counter.

“What’s the difference between a weasel and a ferret?” Peter asked curiously, his eyes stuck on the chair they were all looking at.

It was rather sweet, truly, that he was so clearly concerned about Harry. Except he’d also thrown things at Harry and screamed at him so Hermione and Ron would be having quite the talk with Peter.

“I actually have no idea,” Hermione said truthfully after pondering Peter’s question.

“That’s a first,” Ron snorted playfully. “I bet by Christmas break we’ll have to listen to a three hour lecture on the differences, eh, Harry?”

Nothing.

“I’m rather excited to stay next month,” Hermione said. “My parents were terribly surprised about your dad, Harry. He’s quite brilliant.”

Hermione also had to clear up a few misconceptions as she’d complained about Harry’s terrible home life before he’d moved to New York.

Apparently her parents spent a couple of months worrying that Tony Stark was starving and beating his son. Hermione was probably rather lucky that her parents hadn’t accidentally mentioned anything and started a horrible rumor about Harry’s dad.

“Mum’s worrying herself sick over it,” Ron said carelessly. “‘How will I know if you’re safe? What if it’s too dangerous?’ Honestly, the woman seems to expect You-Know-Who to be lurking around the States.”

Hermione adored Ron. Ron was possibly Hermione’s best friend in the world.

But Ron was also an insensitive wart with the emotional tact of a toddler.

“Laugh it up, but Snivellus said that Voldemort is getting quite a bit of information from the muggle news,” Sirius said, immediately catching Hermione’s interest.

Ever since summer ended, Hermione had been kept in the dark about the war and it had been driving her spare.

“V-Voldemort is watching the muggle news?” Hermione asked skeptically. Hermione watched the muggle news now that she had the ability to do so, but she had a hard time imagining Voldemort carrying around a cell phone to check CNN.

“I’m sure he’s assigned some lower level follower to do it,” Sirius shrugged. “But I think Molly’s got the right to be worried.”

Hermione had never in her life heard Sirius say anything so mature. After the summer at Grimmauld Place, Hermione typically equated Sirius’ maturity level somewhere around Ron and Harry being angry at her over a broomstick.

Ron waved Sirius off, always so careless with his safety, then grinned in Harry’s direction. “Still, it’ll be nice to spend the hols together. Oh! Don’t tell your dad, but Mum’s knitting him a jumper, really adding him to the family.”

Nothing.

“How do I get a knitted jumper?” Peter asked with a crooked grin that was rather cute.

“By not being a spider,” Ron scowled with a distrustful side glance toward Peter that made Hermione giggle.

“Ron’s terrified of spiders,” Hermione said smartly, ignoring Ron’s yelp of disagreement. “Though I’m rather curious how venom from a spider managed to alter your DNA.”

It was fascinating and desperately made Hermione want to examine her own DNA. If venom had made Peter’s entire DNA change, would magic have done the same thing?

Was Hermione being a muggleborn just a fluke in her DNA? Was it one that could be purposefully recreated? Was magic a recessive or dominant gene? Were Peter’s abilities one he would pass on to biological children?

Trust Harry to find himself in Hermione’s dream scenario and be more interested in snogging than researching.

Hermione began researching almost immediately after Harry told her that Peter, the ex-boyfriend that Hermione knew Harry fell hard for, was the same person as his ‘Spider-Bloke’ that saved him from a horrible mugging and took him flying around New York.

… none of which mattered at the present moment though. Not while Harry was still hiding silently beneath his cloak after a terrible experience.

Hermione never wondered why Harry used to spend so much time on the Astronomy Tower, staring at the ground like it was a glowing exit sign to a terrible life; Hermione merely marveled at the strength it must take him to not jump.

“Harry, are you hungry?” Hermione asked Harry gently, keeping any trace of pity from her voice.

Even if it was possibly the most pitiable thing to ever happen to Harry - which was truly saying something considering he grew up in a closet - Hermione knew Harry would hate to be pitied.

So Hermione did it silently in her head and heart.

Harry said nothing.

“I’m hungry,” Sirius announced, a brazen lie if Hermione ever heard one. Sirius looked healthier than he had over the summer, freedom seemed to suit him, but he also looked pale and miserable and Hermione just knew he wasn’t actually hungry.

“You guys want pizza? Or burgers?” Sirius offered. “Oi, Harry, what sounds good?”

Nothing.

“I’ve been hearing about ‘brookies’ for months,” Ron said with a laugh. “Harry makes them sound better than sex.”

“Ronald!” Hermione turned a furiously dark red and swatted Ron’s arm with a scowl. “How would you even know?”

“I do have a life outside of studying with you,” Ron sniffed.

Hermione narrowed her eyes suspiciously at him for a moment before deciding that he must be cracking jokes to try and convince Harry to talk.

Sirius was smirking at the two of them in an irritating way. “Three large pizzas and a couple brookies. Petey, you order and I’ll give you Tony’s card info.”

Hermione took a chance to look around the tidy flat they were in that must be where Sirius stayed if the little traces of ‘wizard’ were any indicator. It was quite rich, with plush carpets and a telly so large it took up an entire wall.

“Does Tony pay for everything?” Hermione asked Sirius curiously once she realized that he must.

“Yup,” Peter and Sirius said simultaneously as they typed away on Peter’s phone.

“Wicked,” Ron laughed. “Mate, imagine Malfoy’s face if—”

“Mister Black? Mister Stark requires your immediate presence in his office.”

Hermione jumped at the new voice, an accented voice closer to her own dialect than Peter or Tony’s, and looked around for the person it came from.

“That’s Jarvis,” Sirius told Hermione after quickly getting to his feet. “I’ll be back.”

Hermione melted at the kind way that Sirius stopped behind Harry’s chair and placed his hand on top of where Harry’s head must have been for a moment before leaving.

Even if Sirius was rather frightening, childish, and - if Harry’s recent reports could be trusted - becoming some sort of playboy, he did truly love Harry.

Harry was one of those people that Hermione knew needed as much love as he could get.

Hermione gave Ron a look, raising both her brows and glancing toward Peter and Harry’s dog, until he picked up on her message.

“I suppose we should take Arsehole out before he takes a piss on the floor,” Ron said airily, staring hard at Peter.

“Huh? Uh… yeah, you can, I’ll wait here,” Peter said, glancing nervously toward Harry.

“I’ll wait here,” Hermione said sweetly with a much less sweet glare. “Harry’s perfectly safe with me.”

Much safer than Peter Parker was going to be once Ron had him alone. As unimpressed as Hermione was with Peter, it was truly nothing compared to Ron’s feelings on the matter.

Hermione thought it was sweet the way that Ron looked after Harry. He’d been the one to point out to Hermione how much Harry would have hated being yelled at; Harry spent an entire childhood being screamed at, he certainly didn’t need it from his friend.

Sometimes Hermione didn’t give Ron the credit he deserved.

As soon as the boys were gone, Hermione focused solely on her friend who had to be hurting so terribly.

“Harry, will you please say something?” Hermione asked him quietly. “If you can’t, will you let me take the cloak off your head, please? It’s just us now.”

Harry didn’t say anything and if it weren’t for the soft breaths Hermione could hear under the cloak, she would worry he wasn’t even breathing.

“You know this doesn’t change anything, right?” Hermione asked. “You’re still Harry. You’re still the same ridiculously brave boy who fought a basilisk with a sword. You’re—” Hermione’s voice broke as she imagined how hurt Harry must be. “You’re still Harry,” she whispered. “You’re still my best friend and- and the greatest wizard I’ve ever known.”

Harry’s breath hitched and it made Hermione’s eyes well up. Harry was always so strong, so reserved in showing his emotions…

“I’m going to pull the cloak off your head because I really need to see you, okay?” Hermione said tearfully. “I just want to see your face.”

Harry didn’t make any sound of protest, though his breathing did seem to speed up, so Hermione reached up slowly and grasped at the material until she could pull it from his head and leave it pooled around his shoulders.

Hermione had never truly suffered a heartbreak until she saw Harry with his head ducked and his eyes swollen and leaking tears. Harry who stood up to Voldemort in the face of death, Harry who walked in an arena against a dragon with his head held high, Harry who suffered and suffered and suffered, wouldn’t even look Hermione in the eyes.

And that hurt more than any physical injury possibly could.

“I’m going to hug you because I really need to,” Hermione said as she tried to hold down a sob that was building in her chest.

Hermione reached out and carefully wrapped her arms around Harry’s torso, pulling him against her, and she might have been able to hold back her tears, maybe, but then she heard a sob that she didn’t make and she simply broke.

Harry’s arms, so weak Hermione couldn’t even believe they were his, wrapped beneath Hermione’s arms and he held her while he cried on her shoulder and Hermione cried on his.

“I’m so sorry,” Hermione cried, knowing her words were so terribly useless. She held Harry tight, wishing she had a time turner that could just take her back and keep Harry from being taken. “I’m so sorry.”

“It hurts, Hermione,” Harry sobbed so plaintively. “It hurts so bad.”

For once, Hermione had no words.

Hermione waited until Harry seemed ready and then she pulled back some and moved her hands to his face so she could wipe the tears off his cheeks.

Harry looked so despondent, so terribly broken. And on top of that, he looked quite ill with his pale skin and hollow eyes.

“Are you- are you hurting? Physically?” Hermione asked, sniffling a little to keep from dripping disgusting snot on Harry’s cloak that still covered most of him. It had slid down some, but Harry was quick to snatch it and keep it wrapped around his waist.

Harry clenched his jaw, causing a little tick in the muscle in his cheek, and shook his head.

“Liar,” Hermione said fondly, much more used to this sort of defiance. “Do you have any idea what you can take for pain?”

Harry was such an odd mixture of muggle and wizard that Hermione was hesitant to go searching for a pain relieving potion while Harry took muggle medication for his depression.

Which was such a relief, honestly.

Harry shook his head again and Hermione only hesitated for a moment before sending his dad a quick message.

Hello, Harry is in pain. What can he take for it?

Harry twitched and then grunted out a pained sound when ‘Jarvis’ spoke up only a moment after Hermione pressed send.

“Miss Granger, Mister Stark said he will be with you in a moment and to not give Mister Harry so much as an aspirin until then.”

Hermione huffed a wet laugh at the abrupt, and perfectly reasonable, response.

Harry suddenly looked horrified though. His head snapped up and his eyes went wide.

“I- Can…”

Hermione waited patiently while Harry seemed to work out whatever he wanted to say.

“Where’s Ron?” Harry finally said, his face as red as his bloodshot eyes were.

“He took your dog outside with Peter,” Hermione said, bemused by Harry’s strained tone. “Do you want me to call Peter and tell Ron to come up?”

“No,” Harry said immediately. Hermione frowned while Harry seemed to struggle with something. Whatever it was—

“The loo,” Harry finally said in a horrified whisper, his eyes aimed over Hermione’s shoulder fixedly. “Can you- can you push me to the loo?”

“Oh.” Hermione got up and pretended it was perfectly normal to push her best friend in a wheelchair to the restroom. Poor Harry, honestly, Hermione couldn’t imagine how he felt just asking for something so simple that everyone took for granted. “Of course. Where is it?”

Hermione saw Harry’s shoulders relax and knew that feigning normalcy was the right choice. Harry directed her toward the door that led to the restroom and then they both seemed to hesitate at the same time.

“Harry, I can help you and I swear to not look and never mention it,” Hermione said firmly. “If you’d rather I called Ron or your—”

Harry turned around and looked at Hermione with the most tragic look of despair that she cut off the offer to call someone else immediately. As much as Hermione was so fed up with toxic ideals of masculinity, Hermione knew in her heart that Harry couldn’t bear the idea of another man helping him do something as simple as using the loo.

“Come on,” Hermione said. “I’m stronger than I look, Harry James.”

Hermione waited for Harry’s short nod before she reached down and carefully moved Harry’s cloak off his lap, pointedly not looking at his legs as Hermione knew he’d been hiding them on purpose, and then Harry reached up and Hermione helped him wrap his arm around her shoulder so he could lean his left side against her.

It was awkward, made all the more so by the way Harry was so terribly weak, but they managed to slowly hobble their way in the clean and gleaming restroom. Hermione held Harry tightly, mentally praying she didn’t drop him, and then looked up directly at the ceiling.

“I won’t drop you, do what you need to,” Hermione said. “I’m going to very loudly recite all the uses of dragons blood in potions. Angelina said it would almost definitely be on our OWLS.”

Harry didn’t say anything, but he tentatively dropped his left arm from Hermione’s waist to…

…to do his business…

…while Hermione began very loudly reciting all the uses she could recall and continuing to hold Harry up so he didn’t fall.

It would be rather mortifying if it weren’t Harry.

If Harry needed Hermione to hold him up so he could use the loo, then Hermione would do it.

And she would never speak of it again, for both their sakes.

While they were in front of the sink and Harry was wobbling awkwardly on his single leg while he washed his hands, Harry’s dad began shouting in the other room.

“HARRY? HARRY? HARRY?!”

Harry looked at Hermione and even if Hermione didn’t have the same level of silent understand with him as she did Ron, it was a pretty clear look.

“Just a moment!” Hermione called over her shoulder. “He’s fine!”

Harry made a very tiny sound in the back of his throat, maybe disagreeing with her choice of wording, but as he wasn’t up to speaking much…

The two of them wobbled back out of the restroom and Hermione felt victorious at being able to help Harry avoid what he must see as a horribly shameful situation.

Tony, who truly looked so much like Harry (Harry was going to be quite handsome when he was an adult), was rocking anxiously on his heels when they opened the door. He began to lunge forward, but pulled himself back at the last moment and let Hermione get Harry back in his chair.

“You’re supposed to take this with food,” Tony said, watching closely while Hermione turned Harry around and pushed him back toward the living room. Tony held up a recognizable green pain potion and a lavender colored potion in one hand and two white muggle prescription bottles in the other hand.

“Peter and Ron are bringing pizzas up,” Hermione told him when it became clear that Harry wasn’t planning on responding.

“Ah,” Tony nodded, but kept his eyes on Harry’s downturned face. “Are you going to eat it, kid?”

It was terribly uncomfortable the way Harry wasn’t responding, so Hermione did on his behalf as she was apt to do when she was nervous.

“I’ll make sure he eats,” she promised.

Tony looked skeptical, but he also looked anxious and on edge about whatever important matter he needed Sirius for, and he handed the potions and medicine to Hermione carefully.

“Green for pain with food, purple to sleep when he’s ready, and one of each of these. One for infection and one for—”

“For crippling depression,” Harry said flatly. “Ah, get it? Crippling depression for the cripple with depression.”

Oh, God.

Hermione had never before in her life been as uncomfortable as she was then and she had just been holding Harry up in the restroom so he could urinate.

“You can do better than that,” Tony scoffed without missing a beat. “I’m going to need to steal the Dogfather for a while, you going to be okay here?”

Harry apparently used up the reserve of his words with his horrifying joke and mutely nodded his head.

Hermione accepted the medication and potions and set them on the shelf beneath the telly after memorizing which one was which.

Tony hesitated for a moment, adorably looking so much like Harry, and then he nodded shortly and headed toward the lifts.

“Love you, kid. I’ll be back as soon as I can and we’ll get you in your own bed.”

If nothing else, Hermione was so thrilled that Harry finally had a responsible, loving, adult that cared for him.

 

Hermione adjusted Harry’s chair until it was beside the sofa and then hovered uncertainly when she went to sit down.

“You’d feel more comfortable on the sofa, I’m sure,” she said thoughtfully. Harry was quiet and looked painfully meek in that chair. And if it were Hermione, she would want to be comfortable at least.

“Give me the silent treatment all you want, but my mum was in a chair when I was eight when she- when she broke her leg,” Hermione had to push forward when she realized it was a poor detail to add, “and she said it was very uncomfortable. So up you go, Harry James.”

Harry didn’t fight her, but he certainly didn’t help either while Hermione grabbed him around the waist and heaved and pulled until she practically dropped him on the sofa with a huff.

“You are heavy,” she said, plopping down beside him.

“I used to be heavier.”

Hermione looked over at Harry and his creative choice to make the most morbid of jokes, but then she saw a tiny little spark in his eyes and Hermione somehow just knew that Harry wanted her to laugh.

So she did.

It started as a small giggle and then grew to a laugh and by the time Ron and Peter came back with Harry’s dog and a stack of greasy smelling boxes, Hermione was screaming with hysterical laughter while Harry quietly watched her with an itty bitty smile on his lips.

*****

Just before Pepper stepped from her rental car, she paused a moment to ensure that she was dressed smartly.

Her hair was in a smooth ponytail. Her skirt suit was clean and pressed. And her makeup hid any trace that she had spent most of the drive from the airport crying over her poor baby who was discharged from the hospital that morning.

Pepper didn’t find Barnes- Peter Parker did that.

Pepper couldn’t heal Harry physically- that was Sirius and Stephen’s job.

Pepper couldn’t heal Harry mentally or emotionally, not really- that was Tony’s job, mostly.

But Pepper could do this.

Pepper could do this one thing and then go back to New York and check on her very peculiar family.

With one last smile, checking she didn’t have peanuts from the flight in her teeth, Pepper stepped from her car and smoothed her outfit down before turning to face the very normal looking house she arrived at.

360 West King Street, Morrison, Tennessee, home of Scott Hoffman.

Scott Hoffman was a twenty-two year old high school graduate who completed half of a semester of college before dropping out and going to work at the Shell Gas Station to support his pregnant fiancé.

And Pepper was going to destroy him beneath her heel.

Pepper walked briskly up to the door and knocked firmly, a pleasant smile on her perfectly painted lips.

The very man that Pepper wanted to see opened the door, a frown with his pinched eyebrows and a disgusting cigarette between his lips.

“Can I help you?” he drawled in a thick accent.

Pepper’s smile became more sharp. “Scott Hoffman?”

Pepper knew it was Scott Hoffman because it was the same poorly maintained skin and unfortunately greasy blonde hair that Pepper saw watch her son—

It didn’t matter if Harry was Tony’s son, that boy was as good as Pepper’s child to her.

—scream about being kidnapped and bleed out on a floor and did nothing.

“Uh huh,” Hoffman said, his eyes flickering warily the longer Pepper smiled at him.

“I am so glad I found you here,” Pepper said politely. “I wanted to personally inform you that you have been promoted in your workplace.”

“I have?” Hoffman’s jaw dropped and the cigarette fell on the porch stoop. “You’re from corporate?”

“I am now,” Pepper said with a smug flick of her head. Tony trusted Pepper with Stark Industries and they were always seeking out ways to expand their operations. “And on behalf of Shell Corporation, a new branch of Stark Industries, I would like to congratulate you on your new position as Shell Security Manager.”

A brand new, shiny, role that Pepper created solely for Scott Hoffman. It came with a mere two percent raise, a company fuel card to drive to the other Tennessee based stations, a difficulty as Hoffman had no vehicle registered to him or his fiancé, and a five week sensitivity training on identifying emergencies, mandated reporting, and proper handling of intense situations in the workplace.

The terms were not up for debate. Hoffman either accepted the job or went in search of a new job- a difficult task considering Pepper had released the video on social media under a pseudonym after enduring Harry’s privacy was protected in the clip.

Hoffman’s name was attached to the film and social media could be so nasty.

“Security Manager?” Hoffman drawled dimly. “We don’t have any security at the station?”

Pepper stepped forward, satisfied with the way Hoffman hastily stepped backward.

“You do now,” she stressed with a narrowing of her eyes. “You have a security guard at all twenty-four hour locations to ensure that if a teenage boy comes in a store bleeding,” Pepper stepped forward again, “and terrified,” another step, “and screaming for the police,” Pepper was in Hoffman’s foyer, “that the situation is handled appropriately. Is that perfectly understood, Mister Hoffman?”

Hoffman was cowering against the wall, his eyes blown wide, and finally some recognition in those eyes. “Y-yes, ma’am…”

Pepper straightened up, leaning out of Hoffman’s space she had been purposefully intruding on, and smiled politely.

“Excellent. I’m sure you’ll be given more details at the start of your shift tonight,” she said. “Have a wonderful day, Mister Hoffman.”

Pepper turned on her heel and began striding confidently out of the home she had no desire to be inside of. She stopped just before shutting the door behind her.

“Mister Hoffman?”

“Yeah?” Hoffman asked with the proper level of fear in his tone.

Pepper tossed Hoffman a bland smile over her shoulder while she added her final nail in that disgusting, slimy, worthless bit of a human being.

“I did you the favor of running a paternity test on your fiancés child- DNA is so easy to find, don’t you agree? I’m sorry to tell you that he is not your son.”

Hoffman gaped, strongly resembling a blubbering fish. “You- you…”

“Can’t do that?” Pepper asked with a smirk. “You’re absolutely right, I shouldn’t have. I believe I broke seven laws, most of which were felonies. I recommend you try calling the police. Something you should have done when my son asked you to last week. Good luck, Mister Hoffman, you’ll need it.”

Pepper walked from the house, satisfied that Hoffman was going to either become a better person or become unemployed and unemployable, and drove straight to the airport to catch a flight back to the home where her child needed her.

*****

Harry was so irritatingly stubborn.

That boy had taken precisely one bite of a slice of pizza, swallowed the pain relieving potion, his blue antidepressant, and then stoutly refused to eat more or take the Dreamless Sleep that his dad left for him. Which was soo annoying because Harry was clearly ready to sleep and his head kept dropping toward his chest and his eyes were glazed over with exhaustion.

Hermione, Ron, and Peter kept up a steady stream of meaningless conversation, but Harry merely sat on the sofa with the Invisibility Cloak covering his lap and his legs, listening rather than participating.

“He’s asleep,” Ron whispered after a short lull in the conversation while Hermione had been checking in with her parents. Hermione looked over at Harry and saw that Ron was right; Harry’s chin was on his chest and he was sound asleep.

“Sirius said he needs that potion thing,” Peter whispered, nodding toward the Dreamless Sleep on the coffee table in front of them. “He- he was screaming every time he fell asleep at the hospital until Sirius got these for him.”

Sirius made it so difficult to hate him, but Hermione could be as stubborn as Harry when needed.

“I’ll do it,” Ron said with his chin raised. “Just- back up, you two.”

Hermione hopped up from the sofa and moved toward the kitchen, sticking the pizza boxes in the fridge, while she eavesdropped on Ron and Harry.

“Mate, time to take your potion.”

“No,” Harry said quietly, barely a whisper that Hermione could hear.

Since Peter was going to be entirely rude and peek around the side of the wall, spying on Harry and Ron, Hermione decided to join him.

Ron was kneeling on the floor in front of Harry with the potion in his hand, an earnest and open expression on his freckled face.

Just as Hermione could see Harry one day being tall and confident, looking just like his father, it wasn’t difficult to see Ron as a parent one day, doting on his children, just like his father as well.

“C’mon, Harry, you know you’re tired,” Ron said coaxingly. “Take this and I’ll help you get in bed so you can sleep. I’ll be here when you wake up.”

“I…”

Hermione could see Harry looking around and she ducked quickly, ensuring if he looked behind him that he wouldn’t see her spying on them.

“I can’t,” Harry told Ron quietly. “I’m- I’m… I can’t sleep.”

“Mate, I’ve got no idea what’s going through your head, but I know that you’re exhausted and you- you don’t want to scream or thrash around while you sleep, eh?” Ron put his hand on Harry’s shoulder kindly. “You’ve got to sleep tonight and tomorrow we’ll talk and we’ll try those weird donuts you like.”

Hermione waited, hoping that Harry would do it (she certainly couldn’t have refused Ron in that moment), and even Peter was frozen while they waited for Harry’s reply.

“If I do- will… we always shared a dorm…” Harry said, so anxiously and unlike Harry that it was killing Hermione.

“I’m not sleeping on the floor,” Ron snorted easily. “Jet lag’s a pain, mate. I’m knackered. Let’s take this and we’ll steal Sirius’ bed.”

After years of knowing Ron, Hermione knew that Harry had to be smiling at least a little because Ron lit up and looked as if he’d won a million galleons.

It was so cute how close her idiot boys were that Hermione felt like like crying again.

“Hermione, we’re going to bed,” Ron called to Hermione, winking over Harry’s head after Harry took the potion. “Are you coming or sleeping out here?”

Hermione scoffed and rolled her eyes. “I’m certainly not sleeping on the sofa, that’s where we’re leaving Peter.”

Peter made a playful sound of dismay and Hermione burst with pride while Ron picked Harry up and put him in his chair before pushing him toward what Hermione assumed was Sirius’ room.

“I know you love Harry, but we loved him first,” Hermione told Peter, patting him on the shoulder kindly. “And we haven’t had a chance to smother him in love for quite some time and you’ve made very poor choices recently.

“Goodnight, we’ll see you in the morning.”

Hermione whistled for Harry’s dog and let it follow her to the bedroom they commandeered for the night. Once they had Harry in the center of the bed, Ron kicked his muggle jeans off and Hermione shed her jumper so they could all climb in together.

 

Harry slept with the cloak wrapped around his waist and covering his legs, but he put his head on Ron’s shoulder and Hermione put hers on Harry’s chest and all was right for the night.

Chapter Text

Sirius popped out of the lifts at Tony’s flat, rather annoyed to be taken away from Harry. Sirius was giving Tony the honors of revenge on Barnes (Sirius couldn’t call him James anymore, not even to himself), and then the berk went and called for him anyway.

The first thing Sirius noticed in Tony’s flat was the return of the sitting room furniture that had Pietro, Nat, Clint, Bruce, and Rhodey all sitting on it. Pietro, Clint, and Nat had cards in their hands and Rhodey and Bruce were talking to each other quietly.

“Where’s Rogers?” Sirius asked with a bitter scowl.

According to Clint, Rogers had Barnes twice- once back in March before Harry ever came to New York and then once just a week before he snatched Harry -and Sirius wasn’t real keen on seeing his face anytime soon.

“Parker didn’t find it prudent to inform him that he caught Barnes,” Nat said, looking up to smirk at Sirius. “Last I checked, Steve was still in Montana.”

“Good for Peter,” Sirius said approvingly.

As much as Sirius generally didn’t care for kids that weren’t Harry, that Peter kid was growing on him. Sirius had taken him with him on their search for Harry and the two of them got to talking- Sirius talked about magic, Peter talked about his bloody weird powers.

Peter was smart as a whip, but witty and a bit of a dick too. He reminded Sirius quite a bit of Remus back when he’d been less of a prat.

If Harry and Peter ever got their heads out of their arses, Sirius wouldn’t be bothered much by Peter hanging around more often.

“Tony in there?” Sirius asked, jerking his thumb toward the office. Before anyone could answer him, Sirius heard a bang behind the door that sounded like someone apparating.

“What is that? Shot four or five?” Clint asked.

“Five,” Rhodey said absently, his fingers flying over his phone screen. “There’s not going to be much of Barnes to bury at this rate.”

“Good,” Bruce murmured as he too did something on his phone. “House cleaning’s going to charge extra for the blood though.”

Sirius barked out a laugh, his misery at seeing Harry hide from his friends beneath James’ old cloak diminishing some.

“I’ll go see if he needs help then,” he offered brightly.

“Want us to deal you in when you get done?” Pietro asked, a teasing light in his eyes.

“Can’t, I’ve got a bunch of wild animals in my flat,” Sirius quipped. He winked at Pietro before knocking once on Tony’s office door and sliding inside.

“Bloody hell.” Sirius was certain his eyes were wide while he took in the mess of Tony’s office. Barnes was strung up from the ceiling in Peter’s queer webbing he tried to explain to Sirius once and dripping blood from his face and what Sirius had to assume was his leg. Tony was sitting on his desk with a calm mask that Sirius knew was barely masking a tsunami of rage while he kept a black muggle gun aimed up at Barnes.

“Is he dead?” Sirius asked curiously. It was hard to tell that Barnes was even a human beneath the mess of webs and blood.

“Unfortunately not,” Tony said shortly. Tony looked rough, real rough, but Sirius figured they all did.

“He keeps healing himself,” Tony added, nodding toward a pool of blood that Sirius could just barely make out a couple lumps that he assumed were the muggle bullet things.

Sirius averted his eyes quick, actually not fond of blood, only to notice a black duffel bag by Tony’s feet.

“What’s in the bag?”

“I was hoping you might know,” Tony answered without looking away from Barnes. He used his foot to slide the bag toward Sirius, dragging it through the blood and leaving a sick smear on the floor. “Take a look.”

Something told Sirius he really didn’t want to look in that bag, but since Barnes was Sirius’ fault to start with, he took a deep breath and stepped forward to flip the bag open with his foot.

And then Sirius turned around and lost his battle against the nausea that had been teasing him since he entered the office, sicking up right on Tony’s floor.

“Are those heads?!” Sirius asked once his head stopping spinning and his stomach quit churning. Sirius grabbed his wand and vanished his mess, along with the blood covering the floor since it seemed like he was going to be there for a minute.

Sirius had seen a lot of horrible things in the last war- he’d seen the aftermath of muggle torture and death eater revels. Sirius had seen dead kids and heartbroken widows screaming for their lovers—

And Sirius was pretty sure that ‘heads in a bag’ still took the cake.

“Are they?” Tony asked. Sirius glanced at him and saw that he hadn’t looked away from Barnes even once during Sirius’ mild fit. “Anyone you recognize?”

Sirius wasn’t a bloke who was caught off guard often, he rather prided himself on being able to roll with the punches, but Sirius gaped at Tony then in complete surprise.

“Anyone I… recognize?” he repeated slowly. “Mate, you want me to pull the bloody heads from the bag and identify them?”

Sirius liked Tony, really. He’d liked Tony back when he’d been young and dumb and partying. Sirius liked Tony a damn sight more when he sent his godson to him and Tony stepped up as a parent in an admirable stride.

But Tony had lost the damned plot and Sirius didn’t feel like helping him find it.

“He says they’re wizards, do you know them or not?” Tony asked impatiently, keeping the gun aimed at Barnes.

“Do you think I know every wizard in the world?” Sirius asked blankly. “We don’t exactly get together for tea at weekly meetings.”

“Sirius, check the fucking heads.”

Sirius swallowed his bile down when it seemed like Tony wasn’t taking the mickey and hesitantly reached down to grab a human head.

The first he grabbed, he did it blindly, only holding it up by the hair for a second to glance at the face.

Then Sirius did a double take.

And then Sirius let out a startled and semi-hysterical bark of laughter.

“This- this is Lucius Malfoy,” he said, disgust and glee bubbling up in equal parts at the familiar blonde hair and the empty eyes.

Sirius was entirely bemused when he looked up and saw Barnes’ blue eyes were open and watching him.

“Why…? How…?” Sirius wasn’t even sure which question he wanted answered. “Where’d you find Lucius Malfoy??”

It took Barnes a minute to answer, Tony really did a number on him.

“He was here and then I caught a ride back to their base with him,” Barnes said.

Mad bastard.

“You can’t catch a ride— nevermind,” Sirius sighed and shook his head. You couldn’t talk sense into crazy people; Sirius had 15 years of living with his mother as proof of that.

With a smidgeon less apprehension, and after Tony cleared his throat in an impatient noise, Sirius reached back in the bag and pulled out…

 

Sirius looked across the hall, sticking his tongue out at Narcissa and Bellatrix. They’d go running off to tell Sirius’ mum first thing, but Sirius didn’t have to worry about that until summer.

Sirius Black, Gryffindor.

Sirius laughed again, feeling so terribly free for talking his way out of Slytherin, and tossed his arm around his new roommate’s shoulders.

“Remus Lupin, I think this is the start of a beautiful year,” Sirius declared. “It’ll be me, you, and James all year! We’ll be the best of friends!”

Remus, who Sirius was liking more and more, stabbed Sirius’ hand with a fork; not hard enough to draw blood, but hard enough that Sirius got the message to let go of him.

“Who is James?” Remus asked Sirius, looking up and down the table of Gryffindors.

“There!” Sirius said, stretching his head up to see the boy from the train with the messy black hair and glasses, chatting up some kid while they waited to be sorted.

“We met on the train, we’re basically destined to meet,” Sirius told Remus with the air of someone who knew what he was talking about even while he sort of made it all up. “The stars aligned and you’re here too though- the three lions! The three musketeers! The triple marauders!”

Remus raised a brow when they heard the Sorting Hat call out ‘GRYFFINDOR!’ and a boy with a round face, watery eyes, and flat blonde hair came running uncertainly toward their table.

“I hope the marauders have room for a fourth, if James even come here,” Remus said with a cocky little smirk that had Sirius scowling immediately.

The stars were aligned, Sirius was meant to make great friends that day, he knew it.

His father was the one who taught Sirius to read the stars when he’d been just a boy- Sirius was eleven and a professional at it by then.

“What’s your name?” Sirius asked the new boy rudely, one ear pricked to listen for Potter, James to be sorted.

The new boy sat across from Remus and he smiled uncertainly at them.

“Peter,” he said quietly, shy it seemed. “I’m Peter Pettig—”

“GRYFFINDOR!!”

“Yes!!” Sirius immediately jumped up and climbed right up on his bench to cheer louder than anyone when James got sorted.

James looked up where Sirius was whooping and making a spectacle of himself and their eyes met and James was beaming and Sirius knew he read his stars right.

Sirius and James were the greatest of friends and they forced Remus to be their friend immediately.

Sirius didn’t like Peter Pettigrew, not for a while. He was kind of a baby and cried in his sleep a lot. It was embarrassing.

James cried the first couple of nights, but Sirius gave him a pass because he had nice parents who he missed so it was fine to cry for a couple of days. But when Peter was still crying by December, Sirius had enough.

“Oi, shut up,” Sirius hissed after yanking back Peter’s bed curtains. Remus had been in the Hospital Wing the night before and he still looked sick and Sirius was tired and Peter was too old to still be crying.

Peter blinked at Sirius and sniffled. “I’m sorry,” he said pathetically. “I just- I…”

Sirius sighed when Peter burst in tears again and resigned himself into climbing in Peter’s bed so he could shut the curtain and try to keep Peter from waking the others.

“You’re not a baby, Peter,” Sirius told him. He sat cross legged at the end of Peter’s bed and tried to ignore the memories of being in the same position with Regulus before. “You’ve gotta quit sniveling, it’s annoying.”

Peter sat up and wiped his face off with his sleeve, looking so bloody ridiculous that Sirius had to actually bite his tongue so he didn’t insult him.

James didn’t like it when Sirius ragged on Peter, even though Peter was ruining the dorm with his… his…

Boringness.

“I’m sorry,” Peter said to Sirius. He looked down at his lap and began twisting his blanket in his hands. It was what Mother would call fidgeting and it would get a curse for doing it in front of company.

So Sirius grabbed some of Peter’s blanket and began fidgeting with it too.

It was fun being the biggest disappointment ever; or, it would be, until Sirius had to go home that summer.

“I- my older brother was a Gryffindor,” Peter said meekly. “He graduated a couple of years ago.”

Sirius didn’t really care, but he figured he wasn’t sleeping anyway and listening to Peter talk about his brother was better than thinking about his own.

“He died, last spring,” Peter said dully, his pale eyes tearing up. “He was the adventurous one, you know? Brave and funny and everyone loved him. And I’m just…” Peter looked up at Sirius and Sirius could see he looked miserable. “I’ll never measure up to him,” he said sadly. “I thought I’d feel closer to him in Gryffindor, but I just feel like a fraud.”

Rats.

Sirius really didn’t want to be friends with Peter, but something in his horribly sad story struck a chord in Sirius’ chest and he scooted around until he was sitting stiffly next to Peter with his head leaned back on the headboard.

“I’ve got loads of practice being a big brother,” Sirius said boastingly. “So I’ll make you a deal- if you stop crying so much, I’ll be sort of like your big brother and you won’t even have to measure up to me because I’m a disappointment and a failure.”

Peter laughed quietly. “You sound proud of that.”

“Oh I am,” Sirius beamed. “I’m the first Black in centuries to go to Gryffindor.”

Because, if nothing else, Sirius was an excellent negotiator.

“I think I’m the first Pettigrew ever to have to talk the hat into putting me here,” Peter said with a sigh. He laid his head on Sirius’ shoulder, which was uncomfortable but Sirius did just offer to be his brother, and pulled the blanket over both of them.

“Thanks, Sirius,” he said.

Sirius looked down and for just an instant, he imagined he was looking at thick black curls instead of flat blonde hair.

“That’s what friends are for,” Sirius told him firmly.

It wasn’t until Peter fell asleep and Sirius went to his own bed that he wondered what house the hat wanted to put him in…

… probably Hufflepuff.

 

“THEY TRUSTED YOU!” Peter yelled at Sirius, using the exact line Sirius wanted to use.

Sirius trusted Peter.

When Dumbledore became suspicious of a spy in the Order, Sirius and James agreed that it wasn’t Peter.

Peter was their little brother who needed them to watch out for him.

It couldn’t be Peter.

Not the fourth Marauder.

Sirius stared at Peter as he blew up the street, slipping away as his clever little rat animagus.

Slytherin, Sirius thought abruptly to himself while he cracked under the weight of everything going so completely wrong.

Sirius was sure that the hat wanted Peter and Sirius both in Slytherin and they talked it into Gryffindor.

And because of it, the greatest person Sirius had ever, or would ever, meet was dead.

 

Sirius held up Pettigrew’s head and felt a million emotions rush through him—

Vindication.

Grief.

Joy.

Anger.

Peter, the fourth marauder, was dead.

Wormtail, the traitor, was dead.

“Friend of yours?” Tony asked, his voice breaking through the memories and emotions crushing Sirius’ chest.

Sirius swallowed hard, refusing to shed a tear for the coward that killed James.

“No,” he said, replacing Pettigrew a little more gently back in the bag beside Lucius. “He’s no friend of mine.”

Sirius closed his eyes to steady himself for a moment before he grabbed the final head-

Which he promptly dropped with a girlish shriek that he hoped Pietro didn’t hear from the sitting room.

“Yeah, okay… okay…” Sirius jumped up and hastily backed from the bag, his eyes wide and his pulse thrumming quickly. “I… yeah, it’s time to get Albus.”

“What? Why?” Tony asked, still not looking away from where Barnes was stuck to the ceiling.

Sirius reckoned that Tony was worried Barnes would escape again, run off to some small part of the world where they couldn’t find him.

“Because when he’s got two death eaters and Voldemort’s head in a bag, it’s time to let Albus know,” Sirius hissed shakily, more focused on Voldemort than Barnes.

Tony’s eyebrows shot so far up his forehead that Sirius couldn’t see them beneath his dark hair he usually had styled.

“He killed Darth Vader?” he asked, much too calmly, as he lowered the gun and finally looked away from Barnes to glance appraisingly at the bag. “Damn.”

Damn was such an understatement that Sirius didn’t even have the words to reply. ‘Damn’ was for stubbing your toe or wrecking your bike, ‘damn’ was not for the most feared wizard in the world to be decapitated by a muggle and have his head stuffed in a bag.

“Damn again,” Tony swore under his breath when his phone chimed. Sirius gladly looked away from the bag - the way that Peter was dead in the same bag with Malfoy and Voldemort himself was fair… it was sick… - to see Tony frowning at his phone.

“Jarvis, tell Hermione not to give Harry so much as an aspirin until I get there,” Tony barked. He turned his exhausted face up to Barnes and sneered in a way that was so like Harry that Sirius wanted to laugh and cry in equal measures.

“I’ve got to go give pain medicine to the kid you tried to kill,” he snarled. “Sirius, can you watch him until I get back? I’ll get the bag to Gandalf, but we don’t need Inspector Gadget around to help.”

Sirius nodded and debated his best course of action…

Killing Barnes would feel really good, but that was the same impulsive thought that led Sirius to Azkaban. Barnes deserved to be ripped from limb to limb, Sirius wanted to do it, but Tony would.

Tony was going to kill Barnes like Sirius was going to kill Peter all those years ago and that wasn’t what Harry needed either time.

And, as much as Sirius wanted as little to do with him as possible, Sirius needed to have Albus sort out Voldemort’s head in the damned bag.

“Take your time,” Sirius said airily. “Make sure Harry’s comfortable, Hermione has a habit of clinging.”

“Might be good for him,” Tony sighed. Just before he sat down the gun, Sirius saw a flash of fury pass over his face and he twitched when Tony aimed it up and shot Barnes again.

It was fair.

It wasn’t like their kid had serum in his veins that let him heal like Barnes had.

“I’ll be back,” Tony said, a warning and a parting in one.

Sirius waited until the door shut behind Tony to summon the bag and Barnes both and turn on the spot to apparate away.

Tony didn’t live through the first war with Voldemort; all he saw was someone who hurt Harry she deserved death. And Sirius agreed completely, but first he needed Albus to confirm that Barnes had actually - probably accidentally - saved Harry from a much worse enemy.

 

The way Barnes threw up when they finally made it to Grimmauld, covering the grimy floor in vomit, was rather a silver lining.

“Where are we?” Barnes asked warily. Sirius didn’t bother replying until he had Barnes petrified and tied up, refusing to let him find an opportunity to escape.

“Hell,” Sirius said flatly. He levitated Barnes to the dining room table and reinforced the ropes to keep him in the chair. It was a rare moment, but Sirius had hoped to see Remus or Tonks around, someone to send the message for him. “Don’t think I’m saving you, I’ll kill you myself the second I find out what I need.”

“Have at it,” Barnes said, his voice devoid of any emotion. His eyes flicked around curiously, but Sirius hadn’t seen him struggle at all. His eyes landed on Sirius when Sirius took a seat beside him. “I’m going to guess based on Tony’s stellar aim that Harry’s leg isn’t so great?”

Sirius curled his lip up in genuine dislike, a fierce anger trying to break through his forced calm.

“You don’t actually want to ask me about my godson right now,” Sirius said coldly, his eyes narrowed and begging Barnes to make a move. “You’ve ruined his life,” he spat.

Barnes closed his eyes. “I saved him.”

“We’ll agree to disagree.”

“They were going to kill him,” Barnes insisted.

“AND YOU DAMN NEAR DID IT FOR THEM!” Sirius screamed, slamming his hands on the table and glared in Barnes’ eyes. “YOU TOOK THE ONLY PART OF MY FAMILY LEFT AND YOU ALMOST KILLED HIM! MAYBE YOU DID, BECAUSE THAT KID THAT CAME HOME? THAT SCARED KID WITH ONE GOD DAMNED LEG? THAT IS NOT MY GODSON.”

Something in Barnes’ confident eyes cracked, a well of emotion shining through that Sirius didn’t want to see.

“I saved him,” Barnes repeated quietly, closing his eyes then and making it easier for Sirius to despise him. “I saved him. I saved him.”

It was nearly pity that Sirius eyed him with. Everyone who said Sirius was mad - ‘Azkaban broke him’, ‘he wasn’t sane to start with’, ‘look at the family he had’ - should take a long hard look at Barnes before they started throwing stones at Sirius.

“You’re wrong,” Sirius said, all the fight leaving him. He looked at the bag and felt a cold chill go down his spine. “I’ve got no idea what you did, but saving Harry wasn’t part of it.”

Sirius then levitated the black duffel bag to the table and then worked hard to settle his emotions, a tricky task on a normal day.

 

“Who else would I ask?” James said with a crooked smile. He and Sirius both looked down at the tiny bundle in Sirius’ arms. “You’re my only family left, Pads, you’re a good man and you’ll be a great godfather.”

“You’d trust me with your son?” Sirius asked, choking up on his words and grateful that James ignored the traitorous tears that escaped him.

James wrapped his arm around Sirius’ shoulders and the three of them stood connected.

“I’d trust you with anything,” James said solemnly. “And Harry’s my everything.”

 

“Expecto Patronum,” Sirius whispered in the present, flicking his wand and praying it worked.

“Oh.”

Sirius blinked at the patronus that he hadn’t been able to cast in years.

It… it had changed.

“Albus, bring your pensieve, it’s an emergency,” Sirius said slowly, eyes misting over while he looked at the new form of his patronus. “You know where to find me.”

With what looked like a gleeful yip, Sirius watched his little mini-Padfoot, complete with big youthful eyes and a missing back leg, bound through the walls of the house before going to Hogwarts to fetch Albus.

“That used to be a stag,” Sirius said quietly, unusually solemnly, as he sank down in the chair at the head of the table beside where Barnes was tied up. Barnes didn’t look like he was listening, but Sirius was an old hat at talking to himself. “There’s a lot of lore about patronus; some say it’s the thing that protects you, or the thing you’d most protect. Mine- mine used to be a stag,” Sirius said, swallowing hard. “For James…”

James had laughed his stupid arse off when Sirius first cast his patronus, teasing him that maybe Sirius was in love with him.

Sirius laughed and shoved him, saying James loved himself enough for a dozen people.

But when Sirius thought about it, when he climbed in James’ bed to sleep with his best friend in the world - his true brother - it made sense really. James had always been Sirius’ safe place, since they first met. Why wouldn’t he be Sirius’ patronus too?

And now… and now Sirius had a little Padfoot Junior that Sirius was meant to keep safe… and the bloody thing was missing a leg.

I’m sorry, James, Sirius thought glumly, swinging his legs up on the table and linking his fingers behind his head.

Sirius was meant to keep him safe… watch over him… be a godfather…

Instead, he brought a madman straight to Harry’s own home and started the obsession that lost Harry his leg.

Sirius looked over at Barnes, raising a brow where he sat in binds with blood drying in dark red patches across his nearly healed skin.

“Objectively, you’re not even that hot,” Sirius lied. Not that any level of fit was worth the pain and misery that Harry was going through, but Sirius still couldn’t believe the way he let his prick lead to Harry getting so hurt.

Some bloody godfather he was.

Barnes raised his own mocking brow at Sirius. “So you’re saying that our heated romance is dead?” he asked deadpan.

Sirius snorted and flicked his wand, silencing Barnes.

Yeah, Sirius was done with all forms of romance for quite some time.

Clearly, he had shit taste.

Chapter 68: “What have I done?”
Notes:

    Hi, this is a long note, I’m sorry, but somehow our story has become more controversial than the one I wrote where Harry’s a SA victim, murders people, dozens of deaths and graphic violence scenes were described, and had a field amputation of an arm of a MC, so just to be honest:

    I think sometimes we forget that I’m a person behind this screen, just like you all are.

    I’m a single mom with three young kids, I work as an EMT, I have a cat named Fred I adopted for my daughter’s 3rd birthday, my favorite food is chicken alfredo and I am just as susceptible to hurt feelings as all of you.

    So in case you forget that I’m a human being too- Hi, I’m Jess, and I’m a whole person.

    I know posting your work publicly opens you up and invites people to criticize you, but I can take criticism when it’s constructive. If you’ve enjoyed a story I wrote for the last 225k words, for free, and no longer do, I don’t see how you’ve ‘wasted your time’.

    Calling something I’ve put my time, effort, creativity, knowledge, and occasionally even tears into ‘crap’ is hurtful. Saying you hate it is hurtful. The variety of other comments with just flat negative comments in them is hurtful.

    This has been tagged with ‘author chose not to use archive warnings’ from the start. I’ve not inappropriately tagged anything, and we started this story with child abuse, suicidal thoughts/actions, PTSD, etc. on top of the mentioned moments of food insecurity, insecure attachments, self-harm, and more. It shouldn’t be a surprise it’s not the typical ‘Tony is Harry’s dad and everyone is happy about it forever and Harry heals because of love’ story.

    TLDR; I have feelings too and they are capable of being hurt which sort of diminishes my want to share the story as I already know what happens and it’s not me that would miss out.

    So with that said… if you’re still here, as always:
    Enjoy. ❤️

Chapter Warning for: dissociation, violence, murder.

 

Bucky walked down the sidewalk, sticking to the edges, with a feeling that something was going to happen.

It wasn’t a power he had, it was just… it was a feeling born of a hundred years of fighting.

Something was going to happen and the kid couldn’t get hurt.

Howard’s grandson wasn’t in the city, Bucky had followed him to a spot just outside the city where he was flying around on a broomstick with Sirius, his dad, and the really fast one.

Magic.

Bucky had seen a lot of weird shit before, but magic was almost impossible to wrap his mind around. It shouldn’t be, what was magic aside from just some less scientific enhancement?

But it was still weird.

It was weird walking around the city without the kid too. Bucky had thought that he was someone just destined to be alone, hookups in a bar not really counting, but then he sort of began looking forward to seeing the kid he was supposed to protect.

At least, Bucky looked forward to it when he could remember where he was and what he was doing.

Too many times Bucky had woken up in a place he didn’t remember going to with nothing but darkness in his mind on how he got there.

 

“… Stark.”

“…Potter…”

 

Bucky’s ears pricked up when he had bypassed an alley between a smoke shop and a liquor store.

Potter was… Bucky tried to sift through memories, some real, some not… Potter was Harry’s other dad‘s last name.

Yes!

James Potter.

Bucky remembered because Harry mentioned once that he always called him Bucky because James made him think of his dad.

Which meant that if someone was discussing a Stark and Potter, it meant the kid.

It didn’t take much effort to quickly loop around and climb up on the roof of the liquor store, walking on silent and trained feet to get intel on whoever had been discussing the Stark that was under Bucky’s protection.

There were three of them, all dressed in some god damned weird cape dress things, like some sort of slash between the priests that used to visit Bucky’s elementary school and vampires.

Every Catholic raised kid’s truest nightmare.

“I don’t think we’re going to just run up in that building, snag the brat, and leave,” one of them hissed to the others. “Muggles have electric city, you know. And I read about the bloke, he’s got bloody Thor locked up as a weapon.”

“Excellent,” another one, the tallest of the three with a voice like oil, sneered. “Then perhaps you can return to our Lord and inform him that you feared muggles too much to assist us in bringing him Potter.”

“Scared?” The third one cackled out a laugh. “Lucius, be real, this is a punishment. You didn’t get the prophecy and our Lord sent us on a suicide mission to make up for it. We’re the ones who had to dig up the shite on Stark, he’s not a normal muggle.”

“Our orders were clear,” the tall one, Lucius apparently, said stiffly. “We grab the brat, take him to our Lord, and see the end of Potter once and for all.”

Unfortunately for them, those orders directly conflicted with Bucky’s and Bucky didn’t fail missions. HYDRA could send anyone they wanted to take the kid and Bucky could best them all.

HYDRA wanted a super soldier and they got one, it wasn’t Bucky’s fault that they never safe guarded against defection.

Bucky jumped from the rooftop and had one of the men in a chokehold before the other two even noticed him.

“Who are you?” Bucky growled. He squeezed his neck hard, threatening to twist it until it broke with a flex of his arm.

“Who— Malfoy!” The man gasped and sputtered and Bucky used him as a shield when the tall one waved something that sent sparkling red air toward them.

Magic.

Wizards.

The fight started and Bucky relished in the comfort of it.

There was nothing like a fight to wake Bucky up and clear the fog from his mind.

One of the wizards fled, Bucky went to snap the other one’s neck while the third got a magic shot off that sliced through Bucky’s jeans.

Bucky hissed and unwittingly loosened his grip on the wizard he had. Normal knives, normal bullets, didn’t hurt.

Whatever the wizard used that had Bucky’s skin burning and blood pouring from a cut was anything but ‘normal’.

Magic was so goddamned weird.

“How do you always get yourself in the most fucked up situations?”

Bucky looked up from where he’d stumbled, spotting a familiar red and blue mask staring at him.

… the person had a name, Bucky knew that, but the pain brought the fog back and Bucky was in the HYDRA base, holding on to the last of his strength while his men screamed from their torture.

“Barnes, Barnes, you have to hold on,” Maxwell said from the cage beside Bucky. “Don’t leave us now, Sarg. You hear me?”

Bucky was already leaving.

There was nothing left to hold on to.

“Just hold on, man, Harry’s coming. Just hold on, okay? Don’t die. Fuck…”

Harry…

“You done shagging my godfather?”

Bucky turned around and saw the kid that Sirius talked about, his godson, glaring at him from the steps of Stark Tower.

His name was Harry, but… but just looking at the shape of his jaw and the curve of his lips made Bucky imagine someone else.

The kid looked like Howard and Bucky knew that his past would catch up with him.

“Hey, man, Bucky?” Someone slapped Bucky on the face, dragging him from the past and to a present that smelled like cinnamon and blood.

Bucky blinked and saw a kid’s face in front of him…

Peter.

Harry called him Peter.

“We grab the brat, take him to our Lord, and see the end of Potter once and for all.”

“Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.”

Bucky couldn’t think, he couldn’t.

They were going to take Howard’s grandson back to their base and they were going to kill him.

HYDRA was going to take Tony Stark’s son from him after having the Winter Soldier take his parents.

HYDRA wanted Tony Stark to suffer and Bucky had to make it up somehow. If HYDRA took Harry, then Bucky was a monster and Stark was alone and—

Bucky didn’t remember grabbing the knife from his pocket or flicking it open. Bucky didn’t remember jabbing it in the soldier’s stomach.

All Bucky knew was that his mission had been compromised and Harry Stark needed removed from the battlefield before he became a casualty.

 

The air around him was thick with static, suffocating him in the tank again, while Bucky removed thought and emotion from the situation.

 

Remove the asset.

Clear the field.

Save Howard’s grandson.

 

They needed supplies to leave and they needed them quickly.

Bucky found everything he needed at the store advertising ‘the best guns in the state’.

A bag filled with the kind of weapons that Sergeant Barnes would have wept like a damn baby to wield in war.

Weapons so sleek that Bucky could hide them without trying.

Silencers that would take enemies down without alerting anyone of their presence.

Clips of ammo that Bucky would never go through. Sharpshooters didn’t need fifty bullets, they needed one bullet and a prayer to God.

“You take your shot and pray you were faster than the enemy, Private Barnes. All a man needs up here is one bullet and a prayer to God.”

Bucky had passed the weapons portion of training with ease and pride.

There was car parked outside that just needed a couple of wires clipped and twisted before it started.

All that was left was locating the target.

 

Bucky found the kid he needed when he returned to his base of operations.

I’m sorry, Bucky apologized when he struck the kid and dragged his body out to the escape vehicle.

I’m sorry, he said again when he saw the kid laying in the backseat. Harry didn’t look like magic and fire laying here, he looked like a kid.

Just a kid caught up in a war where his enemies wanted him dead.

Kids shouldn’t be in wars.

“I’m sorry,” Bucky said as he climbed in the drivers seat and drove away with the kid.

 

Driving was easy, simple.

Bucky used to love to drive, back when Bucky loved things.

It was less fun to drive when he knew he was being followed, he could feel it, but Bucky used the kid’s even breathing in the backseat to keep himself focused on the mission and began evasive maneuvers. Wizards could cut things without a knife, but they didn’t seem able to drive, so Bucky figured he had something of an advantage as he tore out of state and began heading to a safe place.

By the time he hit Virginia, Bucky felt confident that he’d shaken the wizard tailing him and knew it was time to change cars.

Just keep going… get him away then go clear the field… Bucky reminded himself when his brain itched and all his senses screamed at him to go back and eradicate the threats then and there. No harm can come to the kid… no harm can come to the kid…

 

Помнить.

 

Harry began to stir when they were about fifty miles from Tennessee. It started slow, just an interruption of his breathing pattern that had kept Bucky calm for so many miles, and then Bucky cringed when he could hear and smell Harry throwing up in the back.

Blood? Great.

Guts? No problem.

Puke was a different story though.

“Are you okay?” Bucky asked hesitantly. The kid had a temper and Bucky knew his own small grasp of sanity was shaky at best and slipped away like sand between his fingers when he had to fight with people.

Screaming and fighting did nothing but drag Bucky back to when he’d been just James, just some nobody kid with dreams of getting away from his shit life through the glory of war.

James was an idiot and Bucky was sometimes glad that he’d died long ago.

“Bucky…”

Bucky glanced up in the mirror when he could feel Harry’s eyes boring in it.

“Where are we?” Harry asked slowly.

Bucky glanced at the mile markers, reassuring himself of their location.

“Nearly to Tennessee,” he said confidently. “We’ll have to stop soon and change cars. Are you hungry?”

Teenagers needed to eat, even Bucky knew that. And Bucky knew that scrawny teenagers with big eyes and bony wrists had to eat even more often.

It seemed as if Harry needed a moment to process things, which made sense because Bucky frequently needed time to think things through when he could.

Then the kid screamed, shrilly enough that Bucky’s skin prickled uncomfortably.

“DID YOU FUCKING STAB PETER AND KIDNAP ME?!”

Bucky wanted to wince at the accusation that made him sound like the Winter Soldier - he wasn’t, he couldn’t be. If Harry lived, the Winter Soldier could die - but someone needed to stay calm and it clearly wouldn’t be the kid that time.

“Mission status changed,” Bucky said simply. There wasn’t any need to terrify the kid, not while Bucky had it in hand. The kid hadn’t seen him at his worst, not even when he touched Bucky and paid for it with a broken arm, but Bucky knew that he could keep him safe.

There was no reason to panic.

Except the kid was panicking and the most Bucky could do was let him work out his own broken wires while Bucky drove him closer to safety.

 

And then a few minutes later, Harry jeopardized their mission by flinging himself out of a car going nearly 175 and down a ditch.

 

Bucky slammed on the brakes and fought against the war happening in his head—

He’s dead.

Nobody survives that.

Even if he survived, they could have found him.

Save the kid.

Howard Stark cannot die.

—as he ran full speed toward the body laying on the ground letting out pathetic cries of pain.

Fuck…

Bucky didn’t remember a lot from his days as a makeshift medic on the field, the Winter Soldier never needed to patch anyone up, but Harry’s leg looked twisted with splintered bone sticking right out of the skin. They would have called it a dead-man’s break in the field, but Bucky couldn’t let Harry be a dead man.

“Are you insane?!” Bucky hissed, his fear coming through as anger. “You can’t jump from a fucking moving car! Do you have any idea how fast I was driving?!”

The kid wasn’t crying though, he was just… whimpering.

Who set your pain tolerance? Bucky wondered idly, thinking of his own father.

 

“People don’t touch me. They just don’t. And when they do…”

“They’re doing it to hurt you. I get it.”

 

Bucky bent down to grab Harry, lift his broken body from the ditch, and the kid turned his head and threw up all over Bucky’s chest.

Disgusting.

Bucky couldn’t focus on the puke dripping down his chest, soaking through his shirt, because Harry’s eyes rolled back in his head and the kid went entirely limp in his arms.

So far, Bucky was doing a bang up job of keeping the kid safe.

 

When Bucky stopped to change cars, he found an EMS station nearby and hurried to grab supplies that Harry needed.

Ambulances were left unlocked so often that it was as if they wanted the public to access their supplies.

And if they wanted Harry to live as much as Bucky did, then who was Bucky to turn them down?

 

Harry moaned weakly when Bucky set his leg in the new SVU he stole. The sutures from the ambulance weren’t ones Bucky was familiar with, but he made do as he stitched up the ripped skin after forcing the bone back in. Bucky tried to measure Harry’s weight to get the right dose of pain medicine, but they never jacked around with it in the field.

“WRAP IT AND GO!”

“TAKE COVER! ENEMY FIRE!”

“I CANT MOVE HIM, GENERAL!”

“THEN LEAVE HIM AND GO, BARNES!”

“I’m sorry, private,” Bucky breathed after injecting Harry with enough pain medicine to hopefully see him through the rest of the trip. Staring at Harry’s cut jeans covered in blood made Bucky’s head spin and his neck to begin sweating.

In a moment of impulsivity, Bucky robbed a small shop- a yellow building with only one car out front -and got Harry new clothes, himself a clean shirt, extra clothes for them both, and enough food to get Harry through the trip.

The news was on in the store and Bucky saw his own face alongside Harry’s on an Amber alert.

Stark worked quick.

 

It was disturbing, stripping and redressing a teenager, but Bucky treated it clinically as he had in the field and got it over with quickly.

 

Bucky listened to Harry’s deep breathing while he drove, letting his mind drift.

Sometimes things ran so muddled in his head that it felt like he’d lived for ten years instead of a hundred.

On a good day, Bucky was in the present and he was free of his chains and past.

On the bad days, Bucky was ten and running to Steve with a black eye and two sisters who didn’t survive the war.

Civilian casualties were a part of life.

Civilian slaughters were a part of Bucky’s life.

Bucky went from one fight to another for his entire life.

It was his dad, a drunken disappointment.

It was the Germans, killing their own people to purify their world.

It was HYDRA, by Steve’s side.

It was HYDRA’s enemies, commanded to not have a conscious.

The fights never ended because wars couldn’t be won.

And each fight left a scar on his mind and his soul until he couldn’t trust his own thoughts anymore.

 

“I’m with you until the end.”

“BUCKY!”

 

“Siri?”

Bucky startled, his mind smacking him back to reality with a slurred word from a sick kid.

“Sorry, kid, it’s still me,” Bucky told him regretfully. Siri must be Sirius, Harry loved Sirius.

Bucky could have.

There was something dark in the back of Sirius Black’s grey eyes, something that Bucky knew lurked in his own.

Bucky recognized it when they met, but men don’t tend to forgive you after you’ve nearly snapped their arms.

Harry forgave Bucky, but that kid was more messed up than Bucky was.

“What’s… what’s going on?” Harry asked slowly, sounding as if he’d had a few too many drinks.

Bucky turned to look at him and saw huge pupils staring back at him, just barely ringed with green.

“You’re high,” Bucky laughed. “Sorry about that, I wasn’t sure how much you weighed so I guessed.”

High was better than hurting though.

Harry peeked his head up front and Bucky saw him eyeing the bag of medical supplies he’d swiped that sat in the passenger seat.

“Did you rob a hospital?” Harry asked.

“An ambulance, actually,” Bucky said nonchalantly. “I set your leg and sutured it and grabbed some extra doses of dilaudid. Your jeans were trash and you threw up on me, so I grabbed some clothes too.”

Harry nodded his head. “From… an ambulance?”

Jesus.

Bucky really overshot that dose of dilaudid.

“Nah, I stopped and grabbed some clothes and food from a store,” he explained patiently. “You thirsty?”

Harry nodded slowly and Bucky snagged a bottle of water to hand to him. Dehydration was a bitch and the kids needed his strength.

“Should I expect to die from poison?” Harry asked after he chugged half the bottle.

Bucky’s eyebrows rose of their own accord when he looked up at the rearview mirror to the kid.

“Why would I poison you?” he asked. How high was the kid? “I’m saving you. They were following us for a while, but we lost them back in Virginia.”

Aside from that, Bucky liked the kid. They were friends of a sort, something linked them together. Bucky wasn’t going to poison him, fuck.

“Who was following us?” Harry asked in a high pitched voice. “HYDRA? My dad? Peter?! WHO WAS FOLLOWING US, BUCKY?!”

“Wizards,” Bucky said. He forgot the kid hadn’t been there when he found them. “They work for HYDRA and they planned on taking you back to their base for execution. A thank you wouldn’t kill you,” he added as a weak attempt at a joke.

Harry began laughing hysterically.

“Thank you?!” Harry repeated. “You want me to thank you for throwing away my dad‘s cloak, killing my friend, and kidnapping me to save me from WIZARDS WORKING FOR HYDRA?! Fuck you,” Harry spat cruelly. “You’ve fucking lost the plot, mate.”

Bucky calmed himself down, he couldn’t break away right then.

“I thought you didn’t like Peter?” Bucky asked, trying to bring some calm to the conversation before Bucky slipped away.

“Does it matter?” Harry asked tiredly. “You killed him, Bucky. You killed a kid.”

 

“Clear the field, Sargent.”

“They’re- they’re just kids…”

Bucky stared at the three kids with dark hair and hollow eyes, praying in a language he didn’t recognize.

If there was a God, he didn’t want these kids to die.

Kids died in war, but God put the gun in his hands and his commanding officer said to shoot.

“Our orders are clear. Clear the field.”

“I’m sorry,” Bucky told the kids. “I’m so fucking sorry.”

In a battle between God and War, War always won.

War won because it was ruthless and didn’t care about children who wanted to live.

 

Bucky’s thoughts were so focused on the past, the lives he didn’t save - the lives he took - that it took him a moment to recognize the sniffle from the backseat.

Harry’s cheeks had thin trails of tears on them and his eyes were faraway, locked in his own hell.

“Harry,” Bucky called gently, not wanting to startle him. “Hey, are you crying? Harry?”

Harry blinked and Bucky watched him pull himself from his own nightmare.

“No,” Harry lied. He wiped his face off and Bucky felt his chest clench at the childlike action. “I’m great, really, this might be the best day of my life. It’s right up there with the time my uncle dislocated my shoulder.”

Bucky’s hand clenched on the steering wheel hard, cracking the plastic beneath his grip.

Whoever the uncle was, he had to wait. Bucky was on a mission—

I will always place the mission first. I will never accept defeat. I will never quit. I will never leave a fallen comrade.

—and the mission always came first.

“Smartass,” Bucky scoffed, knowing the kid didn’t want pity. ‘Victims’ never wanted pity, they wanted to pretend they were soldiers.

Sometimes they went on to become soldiers.

“That kid isn’t dead, by the way,” Bucky told Harry truthfully. “I saw him on the news.”

“What?” Harry’s head popped right up in the back and Bucky withheld a flinch at the quick motion. “You saw Peter on the news?”

“Yeah, he was with Steve and Tony,” Bucky explained, relieved that Harry wasn’t screaming anymore. “You’re uh… you’re officially a missing person,” he admitted.

And Bucky was a kidnapper, which was the nicest thing anyone had ever called him.

“How long have we been gone?” Harry asked.

“About twelve hours.”

“And where are we?”

Bucky checked the road sign. “Memphis.”

“Where is Memphis?” Harry asked, really sounding like a foreigner then. Bucky didn’t laugh because he knew how it felt to be the stranger in a strange place.

“We’re in Tennessee,” Bucky explained. “We’re about three hours from Texas.”

Everyone knew where Texas was. It was a state that was hard to miss.

“Is that where we’re going?” Harry asked, finally sounding calm.

Bucky fed off the kid’s own calmness, relishing in the cool blue it washed his brain in.

“Mier is our final destination. I know some guys down there, they’re not allied with HYDRA.”

They could get Bucky through the border and that was all he needed.

“Right… right… and Mier is in Texas?”

Bucky’s lips twitched, the kid really sucked ass at Geography.

“Mexico.”

All the blue in Bucky’s brain was pushed out by hot red when Harry screamed abruptly from the backseat.

“I AM NOT GOING TO FUCKING MEXICO!” he yelled. “Bucky, turn around and take me home,” Harry said harshly, his eyes watering from the smack. “We do not need to go to Mexico. We need to go home.”

Bucky didn’t even have a home.

Bucky had… he had nothing but this one mission that mattered more than anything else.

And the mission meant that Harry would get home eventually when it was safe again.

Bucky would make sure of it.

“Everything’s going to be fine,” Bucky told him. “I have to get you to a safe location then I can complete the mission and you can go back, okay?”

 

Everything was going to be fine.

Complete the mission, save the target.

The mission came first.

Save Howard’s grandson, eradicate HYDRA, take the kid home.

Tony Stark lost enough, he wouldn’t lose his son.

 

Before the sun could start to rise, Bucky knew it was time to change cars. He took the next exit for a city that he saw, mentally thinking about finding a big enough vehicle for Harry to try and rest and relax.

“Where are we?” Harry asked dully, sounding like he was in pain.

“We’re just changing out cars before places start opening up,” Bucky said. He glanced up and met Harry’s eyes in the mirror and raised his eyebrows. “You want food and something for the pain?”

“Yes to food, no to being high,” Harry snapped with a petulant little scowl. “I’m hoping eventually you’ll wake up from your episode and we can discuss going the fuck home.”

Bucky sighed. It always came back to that.

It always came back to the ‘episodes’.

“Yeah, sure, we’ll go back to New York so those wizards can kidnap you and Tony can kill me,” Bucky snorted with a roll of his eyes. “Anyone ever tell you that you suck at making plans?”

Harry would be a crap soldier.

It was good that Bucky would never let him enter the field.

Stark probably wouldn’t either; Howard never pushed his son in the military, hopefully Stark followed his fathers path to a degree.

 

“I’ll be right back,” Bucky told Harry. “Just keep quiet.”

When Harry nodded silently, Bucky slipped out to grab a new car.

 

When Bucky returned, Harry was gone and Bucky couldn’t breathe.

 

He’s dead.

They took him.

They’re torturing him, breaking his mind, unmaking him.

Howard’s in the tank-

He can’t breathe.

They’re taking his memories, his very essence.

“I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”

 

“Howard!” Bucky found Howard - Howard, Anthony, Tony. “Please, I have a son!” - not Howard, but Harry at the end of a trail of blood that led to a gas station.

The kid was scared, he wasn’t a soldier.

I am an American soldier.

Bucky had to do some fast talking to erase Harry’s terrified shouts from the gas stations mind. It wasn’t hard, Bucky just channeled every person who ever called him a raving lunatic.

People didn’t care about the truth, they cared about who gave them the calmer story.

Bucky didn’t usually win that fight, but against a fifteen year old doped up on pain killers, it wasn’t hard.

 

“Look, I know you’re freaking out, but you’re hurt and you’re not thinking straight,” Bucky murmured as he quickly carried Harry from the gas station to the new van. “I swear, as soon as it’s safe, I’ll take you back, okay?”

You weren’t meant to make promises, not in war, but Bucky would make sure this kid lived.

If Tony Stark’s son lived, the Winter Soldier could die.

“I hate you,” Harry moaned when Bucky gently put him in the back of the van. The kid’s leg was wrecked again and Bucky had never seen an injury so gruesome—

There was Martins in Germany, when the bomb blew his chest cavity open.

There was Helmen in HYDRA captivity, his skin broiled off in an experiment.

Those were men.

Harry was a child.

Kids weren’t meant to be in a war.

“Missions aren’t always easy,” Bucky told Harry solemnly.

Missions with kids were the hardest.

Bucky got in the drivers seat and hit the closest exit to the freeway, needing to get back on track quickly.

“We’ll get out of here and I’ll reset your leg. You can’t walk on it, kid, you’ll do irreversible damage and you really don’t want to have it amputated.” Bucky held up his left arm, showing Harry proof of his own damage, and wryly added, “Trust me.”

Trust him that he would keep Harry safe.

Trust him that losing a limb sometimes felt like losing a part of himself.

Trust him that Bucky lost himself long ago and he still couldn’t find him.

“I’d rather have a peg leg than deal with your bloody delusions,” Harry said sharply. Bucky looked up to the mirror and saw that Harry had grabbed a sweater he bought for him and used it as a pillow for his head. “HYDRA didn’t send wizards to kill me. You’re a lunatic, Bucky. You need help.”

 

“You’re sick, Buck. You need help.”

“Let me help you.”

“You sound- you sound crazy, Buck.”

 

“You think I don’t know that I’m messed up?” Bucky asked Harry. “I live in my own fucking head, Harry. It’s not exactly a picnic up here.”

It was a battlefield and every misstep landed on a minefield that blew up and left Bucky questioning the ground that he used to be able to trust.

“Wah,” Harry said mockingly. “Poor Bucky and your trauma. Mate, MY LEG IS BROKEN!”

“My arm is metal,” Bucky said. As in- his entire arm had been ripped off. He would have loved to have a single break.

“You kidnapped me.”

“I saved you from wizards.”

“You stabbed my friend.”

“You said you hated him and he’s fine, remember?” Bucky reminded him.

“I never should have been nice to you,” Harry snapped. Bucky looked up and saw a petty little frown on Harry’s lips while his eyes were closed.

Nobody should be nice to Bucky.

Bucky wasn’t even human anymore, he was a monster.

“I don’t know why you were,” Bucky said honestly. He turned around so that Harry understood the weight of his truth. “But you were the first person in a long time to treat me like a human being. I can’t let you die, not like Howard. I won’t let them take you.”

Bucky had a very short list of people he would die for, it had dropped to practically none since he left the tank.

Steve.

Harry Stark.

That was it.

Bucky had one kid to protect, one kid to keep safe.

It was the only way to make it up to Tony Stark.

 

Harry snarked off a couple more smart remarks, it was probably why Bucky liked him so much, and then Bucky watched as the kid slowly drifted off to sleep.

 

Bucky drove fast, trying to speed past traffic jams and diverting around anything that looked like a road block.

Harry started sweating just inside Texas, his eyelids flickering and tiny whimpers escaping his mouth.

“We’ll be there soon,” Bucky assured him softly. “We’re close. I’ll get rid of the wizards and you’ll be safe. You won’t die, not like- not like Howard.”

Tony gets to keep his son.

Bucky talked to Harry when he started getting sick, trying to calm him down. All he did was share stories, trying to keep Harry’s mind off whatever illness was plaguing him that had him sweating and shivering, puking and twitching.

Bucky didn’t even know what he was saying, not until Harry asked a quiet question.

“You- you killed Tony’s parents?”

Bucky looked up and saw hazy eyes blinking slowly at him. Harry looked so out of it, it might be Bucky’s only chance at any sort of confession.

 

“I SAW YOU WITH THAT BOY, JAMES! CONFESS YOUR SINS!”

 

Good Catholics believed in absolution through confession and repentance.

Bucky was repenting through saving Tony’s kid, all he had left was confession.

“I did,” he said quietly, watching the road. “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.”

 

“Please, I have a son!”

“Howard! HOWARD!”

 

“I’m sorry,” Bucky said again. He said it until the words were meaningless and Harry was twitching in his sleep again. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”

Nobody ever understood that Bucky was so fucking sorry.

He was sorry for what he did.

He was sorry for who he was.

Bucky was sorry for being born.

 

When they were twenty miles from the border, Bucky knew it was time to find passage through to Mexico.

It wasn’t ideal, but nothing in war ever was.

 

Bucky secured a truck that would keep Harry from being detected and he had to push his emotions away when he grabbed the kid to move him.

“Almost there, kid,” Bucky said quietly. He hated how limp Harry was, he hated moving the produce and placing Harry beneath them, masking his scent from the canine units that would be at the border.

Harry let out a quiet cry, “Dad…” and Bucky swore that kid would make it back to his father.

 

The rest of the trip was a blur.

 

Bucky didn’t remember crossing the border, he didn’t remember his contact letting him pass through with a small nod.

Bucky didn’t remember booking the motel under a fake name with cash he took from the register the last time he stopped to get Harry food.

Bucky didn’t remember putting Harry on a bed, a single tear escaping him when he saw how bruised and battered the kid was.

He looked like a soldier and Bucky was trying to keep him from war.

“I’ll be back soon,” Bucky promised. He smoothed the kid’s hair off his face, thinking of all the times he wished that someone would do it for him as a child when he’d been sick. “This will be fine,” he said, his eyes uneasy when they flicked toward Harry’s leg. “This will be fine.”

It… it was fine… it had to be.

It was better for Howard’s grandson to lose a leg than his life and Bucky could always get one of Stark’s friends to go get him much quicker than Bucky could. Or he could just call the motel, make an anonymous report, have the kid taken to the hospital and then tell Stark where his son was.

 

It was fine.

It had to be.

 

With the field cleared of unacceptable loss, Bucky wasted no time in getting back to New York. If he was lucky, he’d find the wizards quick.

As usual, luck wasn’t on Bucky’s side.

It was as if the world didn’t want Tony Stark’s kid to live, but Bucky wasn’t someone to bend the whims of the world.

Time was an irrational concept that Bucky had never paid much attention to, all he knew was that it had taken an annoyingly long time before he managed to find the wizards again.

 

The wizards were lurking in an alley near Stark Tower, two of them that time.

Bucky dropped in on them with his weapons drawn and relished in the comfort of killing one of them when he tried to bare his forearm, showing a twisted skull and snake tattoo.

The other one pulled his wooden stick from his pocket and Bucky had it in his hand before he could get cut again.

Injuries never hurt, not like—

“Dad…?”

“This will be fine.”

—other parts of the mission did, but Bucky didn’t want to give him a chance to attack. Bucky had the wooden weapon and snapped it, hoping to destabilize its power source.

“You filthy—”

Bucky twisted around, locking his arm on the soldier’s neck and putting his gun against the side of his skull.

“Take me to your base or you die,” Bucky whispered harshly, finally letting the Winter Soldier take control. The soldier would die either way, but Bucky needed a ride and this was the only one of the duo to show any sense of self-preservation as he went limp in Bucky’s grip.

“On your head,” the soldier sneered. Bucky tightened his lock on the soldier’s neck, ensuring he couldn’t run again, and then everything was black.

The mission, Sergeant. Protect the asset and eradicate HYDRA.

That was the mantra Bucky repeated as he was pulled through a black tube and spit out somewhere dark and then twisted away again before he was spit out someplace with cold air so sharp it cut through his skin.

It took nerves of… well, not steel, but iron… to keep his arm wrapped around the soldier’s neck, staying on his feet and not throwing up. Whatever method of travel the soldier’s were using was nauseating and Bucky didn’t care for it at all.

“Forward,” Bucky growled. “Now.”

The soldier marched onward, Bucky right behind him and allowing the man just enough air to breathe. They were at some swanky house, complete with black iron gates and privacy hedges. It was a weird place for HYDRA to hole up, but not any weirder than the cave in Berlin that they converted to a base.

Bucky had a gun strapped to his back, another holstered in his pocket. His jacket was loaded with ammo and a bullet was ready to fire against HYDRA’s soldier’s head.

They went to enter the house and Bucky calculated quickly- the soldier was too eager. The soldier thought that HYDRA would win if Bucky stepped through that door.

Which meant Bucky wouldn’t be stepping through it.

“If you scream, you die,” Bucky said flatly. “Understood?”

The soldier tensed up so Bucky dug the barrel of his pistol a little harder in the side of his head.

“Understood,” the man spat.

Bucky kept a firm hold on the man as they backed away from the door. Recon was needed before Bucky went barging in enemy territory.

That was a privates mistake.

Privates died because of their eagerness to face down the enemy.

True soldiers, men made of machine who were assets to their teams, knew that subtlety could take down the enemy more swiftly.

How many had the Winter Soldier killed? Hundreds? Thousands?

Howard and Maria Stark.

“Please, I have a son!”

No.

Bucky wasn’t some fresh faced kid with a gun and thoughts of glory; he had one opportunity to take down this base and he would do it or die trying.

Howard Stark’s grandson would live.

With his grip unyielding on the soldier, Bucky led him around the home, identifying points of entry and exit, silently gunning down another of the soldiers with the dark robe on.

The soldier he held hissed through his teeth, shocked when the bullet sliced neatly through his comrade’s forehead.

Bucky found what he wanted when they found the back of the house. There were thick and heavy curtains across a wall of windows and Bucky could hear screams on the inside—

Howard isn’t here.

They don’t have him.

They can’t have him.

The usefulness of the soldier had faded for the moment, but Bucky knew he would never find his way out without him.

“I’ll see you soon,” Bucky warned the soldier while he tightened his arm just enough to send him into unconsciousness. He hid his body in the bushes with the soldier whose eyes stared sightlessly upward with dried blood streaking his face in morbid tears.

With his enemies subdued, Bucky went back to that window and began a quiet climb up to the roof with his gun reloaded and ready to fire.

For anyone else, the silence would be maddening. For a fresh private just off the plane, their heart would be racing and their palms would sweat—

“I- I can’t do it, Sarg. I’m sorry.”

“Hey, don’t—”

A folded flag and lies that they died in combat.

Uncle Sam’s kill count was one that not even the Winter Soldier could compete with.

—not Bucky.

Bucky had been trained for the kill for two men’s lifetimes.

Once he was perched securely on the rooftop, Bucky began seeking out an opening to enter the base. It was locked down good, Bucky would give them that, but he didn’t come all that way just to fail the mission.

When he found an unsecured point of entry, Bucky slipped inside it and found himself face to face with an experiment so twisted that it didn’t look human.

“P-please, sirs, Klem is only—”

Bucky put a bullet between its bulging eyes, catching it before it could hit the ground and sound any alarm.

“Rest in peace, brother,” Bucky whispered as he gently laid the experiment on the marble tiled ground.

Someone should have been there to put Bucky out of his misery before the Winter Soldier took hold and turned him into a monster.

Bucky focused on the current mission as he crept through the disgustingly rich looking house that smelled like death and echoed with screams.

The screams were too deep to be Howard— Harry; Harry was Stark’s son and he was waiting on Bucky to return —but they were screams of a man in terrible agony all the same.

During his trek to the back of the house, Bucky encountered two more of the twisted experiments, putting them both out of misery as easily as he had the first one. Whatever serum they were using hadn’t gave any advanced senses to the tiny things and they were simple, if not devastating, to put down.

Big hollow eyes staring at him in fear. Whispered prayers for savior from a God that didn’t exist only to be killed by the devil that man created.

As he neared the back of the house and the screams of the tortured man increased in volume, Bucky began seeking out alternative methods of entry.

If he had to guess- and guessing could be a costly mistake in all missions -he would say the back room was a meeting room of some sort. And where there were meetings, there were troops.

And these troops fired from wooden sticks made of magic and Bucky couldn’t be sure what all they were capable of.

The ceilings of the house were high open beams, an excellent place to perch to take enemies down from above, but they looked like they ended in each room. Bucky didn’t like his odds of clearing the base and eradicating the leader without capture if he just stepped through the large and dark wooden doors with engraved snakes on them where screams and jeers were the loudest.

Bucky didn’t like his odds at all - he hadn’t been briefed on magic enough - until a gift scampered through the doors with a whine and a limp.

All it took was one look from the shadows to see that they had successfully recreated the Winter Soldier, complete with a silver hand to mimic Bucky’s own. Bucky should have known HYDRA would try and rebuild him after he defected. Assets could not be lost and with the right serum, they could always be recreated.

Bucky never planned to fight himself outside of his own head, but if he could best the original Super Soldier, he could best this one.

The stakes were too high to lose.

Bucky stepped forward from the shadows with his gun raised and the soldier looked up with eyes full of shock.

“Who are—”

HYDRA was getting sloppy.

Kill first and question later was a commandment of being a soldier and that one lost his life for forgetting it.

Bucky tore the robe off his dead body and stared down at a pathetic man with a silver hand…

How many had he killed?

Did he ever regret it?

Did he know that the nightmares were coming for him?

Bucky moved his body to the side after donning his robe. If he pulled the hood down low and hunched his back, he could get at least eight seconds after entry to identify the leader and clear the field.

Eight seconds wasn’t much, but the Winter Soldier had done it faster.

Bucky knew that Howard would need proof of a completed mission upon his return, but he would have to come back for the soldier later…

If there was a later.

The kid cannot die.

The mission cannot fail.

Clear the field.

Bucky clicked another bullet in place and didn’t bother to take any sort of deep breath before entering.

Deep breaths were hesitation and the Winter Soldier didn’t hesitate.

Hesitate and die.

Worse- hesitate and fail.

Failure meant good men died and monsters conquered.

Failure meant escaping one hell for another.

I will always place the mission first. I will never accept defeat. I will never quit.

Bucky hunched his shoulders and opened the door, the timer ticking away instantly.

 

One…

If he had ever worried that the leader of HYDRA, a man self-named Voldemort— “Why? You wanna test you and your metal arm and mad thoughts against Voldemort? Nice try, mate.” —according to the briefing, would be difficult to identify, he was wrong.

The man was no different than Red Skull with his enhancements marking him as something overpowered and confident.

Sure, he’d never get laid, but tyrants never seemed to consider that.

 

Two…

“Pettigrew, he told you to bring another from the dungeon,” someone hissed.

 

Three…

Bucky didn’t lift his head as he aimed the gun on instinct alone and shot them in the chest.

 

Four…

Everything stopped, just for a second.

For one second, it was silent.

 

Five…

Gunshots began to fill the room and there was a cold voice that screamed a command—

 

Six…

Bucky looked up and locked emotionless blue eyes with furious red.

 

Seven…

The leader raised his weapon—

Bucky raised his—

Stark’s son could not die.

 

Eight…

Bucky was faster.

 

Eight seconds wasn’t a lot of time, but the Winter Soldier had done it quicker before.

 

Time has no real meaning to him, it hadn’t mattered before the Winter Soldier took over and it never found importance again.

Time was gunfire and smoke.

Time was taking down the remaining soldiers inside the field before they fired their weapons and disappeared in thin air.

Time was blood and proof of a successful mission.

Time was a bag found in a bedroom closet, filled with two heads and a silver hand.

Time was waiting for his ride home to wake up, a barrel staring the man’s cold silver eyes down when he woke.

Bucky held up the head of HYDRA’s recent attempt at recreating the Winter Soldier in one hand and his weapon in the other.

“Take me back,” he ordered the man.

 

As soon as Bucky’s feet touched the ground in New York, he sent the bullet through the side of the man’s head.

No witnesses.

“There can be no witnesses. Do you understand?”

“I understand.”

 

There was a second part of the mission, Bucky knew that. Bucky knew that eradicating HYDRA’s base and clearing the field was only part of the mission.

What am I forgetting? What am I forgetting?

Forgetting wasn’t usually the problem, remembering was, but Bucky knew he was forgetting something as he walked the streets with his bag and his weapons.

The field was clear.

The mission was—

 

Howard’s grandson.

Fuck.

Bucky was the asset of HYDRA, but Howard’s grandson was Bucky’s asset.

And assets had to be protected.

Bucky shivered then, a full head to toe shiver.

The kid had been pale… shaking… crying for his dad…

“I’ll be back soon,” Bucky promised. “This will be fine.”

It was meant to be fine.

Bucky cleared the field.

Bucky saved him.

 

Bucky’s hands were shaking when he looked down at them and saw the blood soaking them—

HYDRA’s blood infecting him.

They wanted to put him back in the tank.

 

“Mission report.”

“Field cleared successfully. Asset has died.”

“Mission failed.”

 

“What have I done?” Bucky whispered to himself. Bucky began scrubbing his hands on his jeans, trying desperately to get the enemy blood off him. “What have I done? What have I done? WhathaveIdone? Whathave—”

“That’s what we’re all wondering.”

Bucky looked up with wild eyes to see the kid he killed—

“Our orders are clear, Sergeant. Clear the field.”

—standing in front of him.

Bucky didn’t even think to duck before he was grabbed by a white sticky rope and slammed against a brick wall.

It was a mercy he didn’t deserve to have everything go so solidly black.

 

I am a guardian of freedom and the American way of life.

*****

Sirius pulled his head from the pensieve with a gasp for air, feeling as if he had been drowning in Barnes’ messed up head.

Being inside Barnes’ thoughts like had the discomfiting side effect of making Sirius want to pity the prat.

And all of Sirius’ pity was back home with his godson.

Albus did the same a moment later, his face grave, but his eyes twinkling harder than Sirius had ever seen them before.

“First, I would like to ask how Harry is?” Albus asked Sirius after sinking down in one of the chairs around the table. Barnes had drifted off to sleep after Albus used a neat bit of magic to coax the memory from him.

Sirius sat down across from Albus, his mind whirling with what all they just saw.

“He’s sick,” Sirius said truthfully. “His… his leg, Albus, it’s gone.”

The sparkles in Albus’ eyes dimmed and as much as Sirius might not trust the old man, he was grateful all the same when Albus reached across the table to place a hand on Sirius’ arm.

“I am sorry to hear that,” Albus said. Sirius couldn’t even doubt his sincerity, not when Albus looked his age for the first time in Sirius’ memory. “It may not be a comfort to him now, but I’m certain that you and his father will be able to assure Harry that he is still an exceptional young man with or without two legs.”

Sirius nodded weakly, unsure how he was meant to do that. Harry’s self-worth was rubbish on a good day, and now he was hiding under a cloak from his friends.

Some breaks couldn’t be mended—

Not Azkaban for Sirius.

Not HYDRA for Barnes.

Sirius just had to hope that Harry having a family that loved him could somehow make a difference.

“And if that doesn’t work, perhaps I could convince Alastor to visit over the Christmas holidays,” Albus added with a small smile. “I have never had such a healthy level of fear for a man as I carry for Alastor.”

Sirius snorted quietly. Personally, he thought Alastor was just mad enough to think that Harry losing a leg was somehow a good thing. Sirius’ snort was just loud enough to cause Barnes to twitch in his sleep, an action that drew both Sirius and Albus’ eyes to him.

“In a twist of irony, Tom was not taken down by the boy who was fated to be his enemy, but his childhood fear,” Albus said quietly, his eyes somber as he studied Barnes.

Sirius tilted his head to the side, puzzled. “What? He was afraid of guns?”

It seemed like a weak fear for Voldemort, even as a child.

Sirius had always been afraid of his mother though, so maybe he shouldn’t be casting hexes.

Albus removed his glasses, wiping them off and he seemed to be deep in thought.

“Tom grew up in a muggle orphanage during the worst of the war,” Albus finally said. “It is perhaps a cruel irony that one of the soldiers he used to fear so harshly was able to put a temporary stop to his reign through such muggle methods.”

Albus had him for a moment, Sirius had nodded his head in understanding, and then he paused and replayed that comment in his mind.

“‘Temporary’?” Sirius asked, glancing significantly toward the bag. “Be a bit hard to cast any spells without a head, Albus.”

Albus smiled but there was no joy in the look. “Sirius, if you would grant me a day or two with both your soldier and his… trophies,” Albus added with a brief grimace, “I believe I can clear your name quite easily and inform the Ministry of what has transpired while they feigned ignorance.”

“And after that?” Sirius asked pointedly.

“And after that I believe I should sit down with you and Harry’s father; I have quite the story to share and I can think of no better team to assist me in permanently ending Tom than the Avengers.”
Notes:

    Harry is adjusting great, thanks for asking. No, really, he’s doing awesome.

Chapter Text

Sunday, November 12

“It’s going to be fine, okay?”

“I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”

“This will be fine.”

“Dad… I want my dad.”

Harry’s eyes flew open and a strangled sound ripped its way from his throat.

There was a moment when all Harry could smell was something earthy and damp and something heavy laid on his chest - crushing him, can he breathe? - and then—

“Shh, kid, you’re okay.”

Harry looked around, his chest heaving as his eyes tried to adjust to the dark. Something brushed Harry’s head and he snapped his head over, looking for the source.

“Dad,” Harry sighed, relaxing some. His dad was sitting in the chair beside his bed. A new chair, one that hadn’t been there before…

Before.

When Harry looked down at his chest, he saw that Joey was the lump on his chest that weighed him down, not… not potatoes.

“Your friends are in the living room,” Tony said quietly. He had his fingers in Harry’s hair, brushing the sweaty hair off Harry’s head over and over. “Do you want to go in there with them?”

Harry shook his head, overwhelmed already.

Ron and Hermione had been at their house for two nights and were meant to go back to Hogwarts that afternoon. Harry wasn’t… ungrateful… to have them there, but he was ready for them to leave.

They were pretending like everything was normal.

Ron was cracking jokes and trying to stuff food down Harry’s throat. Hermione was asking about magic, about Peter, about school.

They were the same and Harry was so bloody different and they were just pretending not to notice. Like it was normal for Hermione to help Harry to the loo, or for Harry to be in a chair and taking three pills and three potions a day.

A pill for depression because Harry hadn’t smiled in… weeks… probably.

A pill for the deficits in Harry’s brain that made his fingers itch and his mind to wander too often.

A pill for infections so that Harry’s stump didn’t get reinfected since Sirius hadn’t been able to just heal the incision. Not that Harry had even seen Sirius since the day he got home, but it wasn’t as if Harry had been asking for him either.

Then a potion for pain.

A potion to sleep.

And a thick and disgusting potion to make up for the fact that Harry didn’t feel like eating anymore.

“Are you hurting, kid?” Tony asked, continuing to brush Harry’s hair off his forehead with his big sad eyes full of pity and heartache.

Tony’s heart ached because he knew that Harry had been a crap son before, a heavy burden, and now that he couldn’t even walk? It was almost laughable what a burden Harry became.

Harry blinked, trying to make Tony understand that Harry couldn’t just… he couldn’t just whine about being in pain. Especially not when everything hurt all the time.

“Yeah,” Tony nodded as if Harry answered him. “You’re in pain. I’ll make you a deal, come out and eat lunch with your friends before they have to leave, save me from Hermione Granger asking me a million questions. Then you take your medicine, I call the freaking Dogfather again, and we’ll watch a movie after the extra hormones have cleared from our house.”

Harry moved his eyes up to his ceiling, fighting down an inappropriate urge to cry.

Nothing inside of Harry wanted to go out in the sitting room and see his friends be the same people they always were. Harry was so different… not just the leg, but… but something inside of him felt different.

Everything was too raw, too exposed, and there was a tiny voice inside Harry’s head that made him want to ask his dad to hold him until all the outside noise and smells and feelings dulled down and Harry could breathe again.

“Fine,” Harry rasped out quietly. He kept his eyes aimed upward, knowing that Tony would just move him from his bed.

Because that was a thing now.

People could just move Harry around.

“Pepper’s going to be home tomorrow,” Tony said while he lifted Harry up. Harry tilted his head on Tony’s collarbone, just for a moment, pretending it was a normal hug instead of Harry needing assistance to do something as simple as getting out of bed.

Hermione said that Harry’s strength would come back and he’d be able to do everything himself again, but as Hermione had two legs Harry figured she was full of shit.

“We’ll be able to make a plan when she gets home,” Tony went on. “You know how she is, she’ll have the best physical therapists, the best tutors, the best therapists all listed for us to go see.”

Harry turned to look at his dad, lifting an eyebrow in a silent question. It took Tony a moment, they were nearly to Harry’s door - Harry reached out to snag his cloak, wrapping it around his waist and covering his legs - when he finally seemed to understand what Harry was asking.

“You- do you want to go back to Midtown right now?” Tony asked.

Oh. They weren’t replacing Strange, they were replacing the muggle teachers.

Harry relaxed some. Mortifying thought that Strange was apparently the one that found Harry in a motel covered in his own sweat and probably dying aside, Harry rather liked the witty man.

Of course Harry had liked Bucky, so maybe Hermione wasn’t the only one that was full of shit.

Harry hadn’t actually even considered school at all. He tried to imagine showing up at Midtown with his stupid chair and his missing leg that couldn’t be hidden there and everyone would stare.

They would stare and whisper and laugh and Harry didn’t want to go at all.

“No,” Harry said in response to Tony’s question.

“I figured not,” Tony said simply, as if Harry wasn’t just putting more of a burden on him by staying home.

Harry opened his mouth, he needed to tell Tony what Bucky told him—

What was Bucky but another Voldemort, really?

He killed Tony’s parents, left him an orphan, and people told Tony they died in a wreck.

—but then they made it to the sitting room and Harry saw that Ron and Hermione were waiting for him.

“Morning,” Ron said cheerfully. He hopped up to grab Harry’s chair from Tony. Instead of pushing Harry to the sofa as Harry expected, he started pushing him toward the lifts. “C’mon, let’s take your dog out back. It’s private, eh? You can get some fresh air.”

“Good idea,” Tony said immediately, causing Harry to feel a bit like it was pre-planned. “Hermione and I will order something for lunch. Kid, any input?”

Harry figured that Tony knew he didn’t have input because he wasn’t hungry, so he just stayed quiet.

Joey seemed thrilled to follow Ron and Harry though and Harry figured that Ron wanted a bit of privacy for whatever thoughts seemed to have his mental wheels turning at…

Harry glanced at a clock on their way to the lifts…

… at eleven am.

 

Harry squinted in the sunlight out back and then winced when Ron pushed Harry’s chair off the pavement and on the grass, the bump jostling Harry’s body in a way that only worsened the pain shooting through his hips downward.

“Sorry, mate,” Ron said apologetically. He stopped Harry’s chair in the middle of the fenced in back yard behind the tower and then plopped down on the ground beside him.

Harry appreciated the few moments of silence. The sun was shining despite the cold wind blowing, it smelled like autumn, and Joey barking was a peaceful melody to listen to.

Even with the awkward chair beneath him and a cloak wrapped around his waist to hide his legs, Harry felt like before for a moment.

If he closed his eyes, it was before.

“Are you going to be okay?” asked Ron quietly.

And then Harry was dropped gracelessly back in the after.

Harry looked over at Ron and saw his best mate, his first friend, staring at him with solemn blue eyes filled to the brim with worry.

Harry swallowed hard and looked out at where Joey was jumping up and down at the stone bench that Harry usually sat on. It was new, it only appeared after Harry came back from Hogwarts. Harry didn’t use it often, because he usually just took Joey on walks.

Not toward the downtown area, because Harry didn’t want to get mugged again.

Not with Peter, because Harry got him stabbed.

Not with Bucky, because… because.

And not at all anymore, because Harry couldn’t walk.

“I don’t know,” Harry said honestly. When it hurt watching Joey jump around, knowing Harry wouldn’t be able to again? Harry didn’t know if he was going to be okay.

Harry didn’t even know what ‘okay’ was meant to mean anymore.

“You’re going to be okay, kid.”

Ron’s large and warm hand moved to Harry’s arm. Harry looked down and saw that all the freckles on Ron’s hand were the same, but Harry’s arm looked small, pale, gross.

Ron hadn’t changed at all and Harry didn’t even recognize himself.

“If I could stay, I would,” Ron said.

Harry curled his lips to the side, a wry and joyless smile. “Even if I could leave, I wouldn’t.”

Where would he go?

Why would he want to?

“Yeah,” Ron sighed. He gave Harry a more genuine smile, less full of pity. “Honestly, mate, you’re lucky you have lifts here. Imagine going to Hogwarts with a wheelchair. All those stairs?” Ron shivered and Harry forced himself to laugh, knowing that’s what Ron wanted. “It’d be a bloody nightmare.”

Lucky wasn’t really a word Harry thought he’d use to describe himself, but he nodded all the same.

“Yeah, I’m lucky.”

 

By the time Harry and Ron made it back upstairs with Joey leading the way, there was already food all over the counter in the kitchen. Courtesy of Bruce, it seemed like, since he was standing in the kitchen chatting with Hermione while Tony sat on the sofa poking angrily at his phone.

“Hey, Harry,” Bruce said, looking up from a holographic screen he’d been examining with Hermione. “Hermione, let’s talk more about this next month when you come back, okay? I’d be thrilled to look into it with you.”

Hermione looked like she had won the Quidditch World Cup when she came bouncing over to Harry and Ron with a wide smile and glittering eyes.

“Genome mapping,” Hermione breathed to them. “Can you imagine if there was a way to identify the gene that makes us magic? See if it can be replicated in muggles? There could be a way to tweak the genes in a muggle and give them magic!”

“That’s possible?” Ron asked, leaning against the handlebars of Harry’s chair. “You can use muggle stuff to make magic?”

Hermione easily pushed Ron away from the chair and guided Harry to the kitchen where the food was sitting on the counter. She chatted on quickly, too quickly for Harry to really listen, about genetics and manipulations and DNA and RNA and when Harry looked up at Ron he saw that Ron’s eyes were glazed over, but he was grinning like an idiot at Hermione all the same.

Harry figured that if you really loved someone, you could overlook something as mildly annoying as them talking too much. It was different, with Ron and Hermione. What was one annoying habit of talking too much about something that nobody else understood as compared to… oh, Harry didn’t know… a person only having one leg?

“Breathe, and eat,” Ron told Hermione patiently. “What…” Ron leaned over the counter and looked at all the dishes scattered around. “What is this anyway?”

For just a second - for one bloody second - Harry got drawn in the familiarity of being around Ron and Hermione. For one second, it was before.

Harry went to stand up to see what food was laying out on the counter out of his sight because he thought it was before.

A shooting pain radiated up from Harry’s stump to his hips and then his back when he landed in a crumpled heap on the floor, right in the middle of the kitchen. It was unintentional, but Harry let out a sound something mixed between shock and pain and suddenly everyone was surrounding him and not only did his vision go hazy from the pain but then he couldn’t breathe.

“Harry, are you—”

“Here, let me—”

“Shit, hold on—”

“Okay, everyone back up, now!”

Harry was trying to catch his breath, trying to swim through the pain, and looked up gratefully when his dad stepped up and forced Hermione, Ron, and Bruce to get away.

“Couch?” Tony asked. Harry nodded, flinching hard when Tony lifted him from the floor and carefully moved him to the sofa in the sitting room. Tony waited until he had Harry settled in the corner of the sofa to subtly wipe the tears Harry didn’t know he’d cried off his face.

“Pain medicine and food,” Tony said firmly. “You like the chicken and broccoli crap, right? Bland and full of greens?”

Harry nodded and then dropped his head down when Hermione came over to sit beside him, snuggling in his side and grimacing when Harry jolted away from her.

“Are you okay?” Hermione asked Harry quietly while Tony began a loud conversation in the kitchen, probably smoothing the topic away from Harry and his idiocy.

Tony was a good bloke.

He really didn’t deserve to be saddled with Harry to start with, and he definitely didn’t deserve to be stuck with him then.

Harry was a coward of a son, one who convinced his own father to be a coward. Tony was a genius, Harry was an idiot.

Tony had a company to run, a team to guide. Brilliant, life-changing, ideas to think up and then bring to life.

The very last thing Tony needed was a- a… a crippled kid holding him back.

“Whatever you’re thinking, you’re wrong,” Hermione said calmly, as if she could read his mind. “You deserve love just as much as anyone. This doesn’t change that.”

Harry snorted quietly, “Whatever you say.”

Really, Hermione was on a streak of being full of shit.

 

Harry was quiet during lunch, choosing to listen as Bruce and Hermione talked rapid fire about genetics and Ron told Tony about the odds and ins of quidditch. Joey sat by Harry’s foot, even though it was once again hidden by his cloak that Ron returned to him, and Harry kept feeding him pieces of his chicken while his brain swam in the pain relieving potion.

At some point, Harry’s phone rang and it took him a moment to realize it was still in his pocket, he must have fallen asleep with it the night before.

It was Peter and Harry clumsily clicked ignore.

“You’re such a dick,” Ron snorted. He was sitting in a chair beside Harry and watched as Harry ignored Peter’s call. “He’s not so bad, even if he is half spider or whatever. Why are you ignoring him?”

“Ron, mind your business,” Hermione snapped.

Harry saw that Tony and Bruce were both watching the three of them with blandly curious looks on their faces so he hastily muted his phone and put it away.

“But Harry likes him!” Ron protested, only causing Harry to scowl harder down at his lap. “And now that I think I really scared him,” Harry glanced up and Ron looked smug beyond reason, “I think he’s a great boyfriend for Harry!”

“Harry isn’t wanting to date right now, he’s- he’s focused on other things!” Hermione said heatedly. “And Peter should respect that and give him time and space and understanding!”

“And I wish everyone would shut the fuck up,” Harry said, leaning back against the sofa and closing his eyes. “For one minute, one god damned minute, I wish everyone would just shut up.”

Harry knew he was being rude, he knew that he should feel happy that Ron and Hermione even wanted to associate with him at all anymore, but it was just exhausting.

Tony’s voice was wry and playful and washed away the heavy feeling in the air after Harry’s snap.

“One Mississippi… two Mississippi… three Mississippi…”

Tony had a gift for making horrible moments a little less horrible. Somehow, that gift got twisted backward in his son.

 

Harry was asleep before Tony got to thirty.

*****

“Harry? Harry?”

Harry blinked slowly, bringing himself out of the dreamless sleep he’d been in. As soon as he was more alert, he looked past Hermione to glare at his dad.

“You drugged me,” he accused.

Tony smiled brightly, reclining back in his favorite chair. “You kicked around so much last night that I found the ginger and bookworm on our couch this morning.” Tony waggled his eyebrows playfully. “They didn’t seem to mind, but you need your rest.”

“Don’t do it again,” Harry said harshly before adding on a muttered, “Bastard.”

“Language, Mister Pot— Mister Stark.”

Harry looked to the right so quickly that his neck cracked and his jaw dropped. Standing inside the sitting room, as if she did it every day, was Professor McGonagall.

Not only was it Professor McGonagall, in Harry’s house, but she had on a knee length muggle skirt with a matching blazer on top of it.

Harry had never been so full of shame as he was when his previous Head of House - the person who fought to put Harry on the quidditch team, the woman who had always been stern, but fair, the adult within Hogwarts that Harry had most liked and wanted to make proud of him - looked at Harry and her eyes flicked down to his leg quickly, revealing that Harry knocked his cloak off in his sleep.

“Harry,” Professor McGonagall stepped forward and offered Harry a small smile and her hand for a brief handshake, “how are you?”

“Fine, ma’am,” Harry lied. His face was a hot shade of red when he snatched his cloak off the floor and covered himself with it, hiding his leg from sight.

McGonagall clicked her tongue and Harry looked up, aghast, when she bent down and snatched the cloak from him.

“Your father left this for you to play pranks and other acts of tomfoolery,” she said sternly. “You will not use this to hide yourself from people who care for you. Is that understood, young man?”

In the face of McGonagall’s sternest lecture Harry had received, second only to when he got caught sending Norbert away, Harry could only mumble an agreement.

“I might love you,” Tony said conversationally to McGonagall.

McGonagall turned from Harry to give Tony an unimpressed stare while Hermione and Ron, who Harry could see had their bags packed, gave Harry sympathetic looks.

“You are the one who is endorsing Mister Black’s new lifestyle?” she asked Tony. When he nodded, Harry nearly - nearly - grinned at the scathing noise McGonagall made. “You are two grown men, Mister Stark. You are grown men with a teenage son. It is time to grow up. Have I made myself clear?”

Ron and Harry exchanged a smirk when Tony mumbled out his own sheepish agreement.

“Very well,” McGonagall nodded at Harry and Tony both and then gave Harry his cloak back. “Mister Weasley, Miss Granger, if you’d like to say goodbye, we have a portkey to take.”

Hermione immediately threw herself at Harry, hugging him until Harry felt tears prickle at his eyes.

“I love you so much,” she whispered to him, sounding just as tearful. “Please be so careful, Harry. I’ll see you next month, okay?” Hermione pulled away and put her hands on Harry’s cheeks. “Call me every day, okay? Or… or just text me if you don’t feel like talking.”

“Please do or she’ll drive me bonkers,” Ron joked. He bent down and gave Harry a brief hug before mussing up Harry’s hair with a crooked grin. “We’ll see you soon, mate. Save some danger for the rest of us, eh? No need to keep proving you’re a Gryffindor, we already know.”

Harry nodded absently.

A Gryffindor?

Harry should have went to Slytherin.

“It was a pleasure to see you,” McGonagall said to Harry, somehow sounding genuine. “I’ll bring your friends to you next month. Mister Stark, watch over him,” she told Tony firmly.

Harry lifted his hand in a horribly relieved farewell when Hermione and Ron started to walk off toward the lifts with McGonagall.

“Wait! Professor!” Harry’s heart started racing as he had a sudden thought. Maybe… maybe…

Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and there was a look in the set of her lips that made Harry think she knew what he wanted to ask. That didn’t dissuade him though. Sirius was smart, but McGonagall was a genius. McGonagall was the wizarding version of Tony.

“Professor, is there any way… can you…” Harry sighed and gestured to where his leg used to be, carefully avoiding looking at it. “Can you fix it?” Harry asked her, sounding rather desperate.

McGonagall walked back over to Harry, leaving Ron and Hermione to stand by themselves with identically pained expressions.

“Harry, I can assure you that I have scoured every resource available since I was told of your… accident,” she said gently, kneeling down in front of him to put their faces on the same level. “I spoke with Albus, with one of the greatest healers at St Mungo’s and even with Severus.”

Harry already knew what was coming next.

If McGonagall found a way to regrow his leg, she would have said so from the start.

“I’m sorry, Harry,” McGonagall said sadly, sounding as if she truly was sorry. “I cannot begin to imagine what you are going through, but I know that you will find a way to come through stronger than before.”

Harry nodded in acknowledgement and McGonagall patted his shoulder kindly before standing back up.

“Was it you, ma’am? That sent me my broom in first year?” Harry asked when she started to walk away again.

McGonagall smiled over her shoulder and nodded. “It was. You- you may not have known this, but I was one of the first to know about your mother’s pregnancy with you. Your father quite adamantly stated that I would be Grandmother Minnie.”

“That would have been nice,” Harry said quietly. He could imagine it, really. Maybe he would have grown up with his parents during the year, Tony in the summers. Maybe his parents would have moved to the States and Harry would have lived with all of them.

They would have had holidays together. Professor McGonagall would have nagged Harry until he was just as good at Transfiguration as everyone said James was.

Sirius still would have bought him his first broom, but McGonagall would have bought him one for quidditch. Tony would be there to tinker with the broom, trying to make it better just like he did their refrigerator.

Harry probably would have been happy. He definitely wouldn’t be who he was then.

“Yes, it would have,” McGonagall agreed with a sniffle so quiet Harry might have imagined it. “Write to me, Harry. Thank you, Mister Stark. I’m sure I will see you both again.”

With a final goodbye from Ron and Hermione, the three of them left.

Harry grabbed the cloak from beside him and covered himself back up with it. Even if clearly Harry needed to get used to seeing himself so utterly broken, he didn’t need to do it then.

Tony cleared his throat and moved from the chair to the sofa, throwing his arm around Harry’s shoulders and pulling him to his side.

“Prosthetics are the wave of the future anyway,” he said brightly. “One day people will be having elective amputations just so they can have prosthetic limbs.”

Harry tried to imagine himself with a peg leg like Moody…

The clunking sound of Barty-as-Moody half carrying, half dragging, Harry from the maze to the castle…

A loud clunk, the wooden leg fell away as a normal leg regrew in its place…

Except Harry wouldn’t need a peg leg; he could have something different, more magical…

Wormtail raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove. He flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder.

“My Lord,” he whispered. “Master... it is beautiful... thank you… thank you…”

Harry closed his eyes and breathed slowly.

No.

No magical hand either.

Which really just left…

“No fake leg,” Harry finally said, instantly jerking his thoughts away from the only other fake limb he knew of. “I- just… I can’t.”

“Okay,” Tony said easily, his heavy and warm arm never wavering from its place around Harry’s shoulders. “No prosthetic. I guess that means you don’t want to see the blueprints for the kick ass Iron Kid leg I’m definitely not already building.”

Harry was such a burden.

Instead of answering, Harry carefully lowered his head on Tony’s shoulder.

“Can we just watch a movie?” Harry asked him quietly, hating the way that even his voice sounded weak and pathetic.

Tony tilted his head to touch Harry’s and rubbed the chill from Harry’s shoulders.

“Of course, kid,” he said, sounding fond. “What do you want to watch?”

Harry shrugged and yawned, grateful when Tony snagged the blanket off the back of the sofa and covered them both with it.

“Dealers choice then,” Tony said. “You know what’s going to cheer you up? Killer clown.”

Harry tried to stay awake to watch Pennywise terrorize a group of kids, but he drifted off to sleep before the good guys could defeat evil.

Good guys didn’t always win.

Who knew that more than Harry?

 

The rest of their day passed slowly, lazily.

It was almost normal, really. Until Harry caught a glimpse of himself on his phone screen after replying to a concerned text from Pepper—

Hey, sweetheart. Are you feeling okay? Is your dad giving you your medicine? I’ll see you tomorrow. Love you.

I took my medicine. I feel like rubbish.

You’re very cute trash. I’ll bring you something to cheer you up, okay?

Harry sent a thumbs up, though his actual thumb had hesitated for a moment over the leg and brain pictures.

A leg would cheer Harry up, as impossible as it seemed. So would a brain, since Harry just went from stupid decision to stupid decision.

When he clicked his screen off though, Harry had to see his reflection in the black screen and it made him cringe. His hair was so greasy that it looked wet and Harry swore that his face used to be… clean… and less thin…

In short, Harry used to be at least a little less Snape-like.

Harry looked around for Tony, hardly noticing when he said he needed to make a call and hadn’t returned yet.

Harry’s chair wasn’t far from the sofa… his bedroom door was open…

Harry slumped down in a miserable ball when he realized that he couldn’t even use his shower.

‘Young man’, McGonagall had called him.

What ‘man’ couldn’t even get to a shower by himself? Almost worse than that, what ‘man’ couldn’t go to the bloody loo by himself?

And… and Hermione was gone.

 

When Tony came back in the flat, it was to find Harry curled against himself, his face buried in a pillow on his lap, and his shoulders shaking.

“Woah, woah, Harry?” Tony sat down beside Harry and started rubbing his back, making Harry cry that much harder because he was pathetic.

“Hey, what happened? Are you hurt? Harry?”

“I CAN’T FUCKING SHOWER!” Harry screamed in the pillow, muffling his voice some. “I CAN’T GO TO THE BLOODY LOO!” Harry lifted his face and turned, refusing to be too cowardly to say what was eating him alive and taking up most of his thoughts to his lap. “I’m a burden, Dad. I’m- I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”

“Hey, what?” Tony wrapped his arms around Harry and practically dragged Harry to his lap, rocking him side to side while Harry broke.

Harry clutched his dad like a lifeline he didn’t deserve and sobbed out apology after apology.

“I jumped-” Harry cried, getting snot and tears and his disgustingly greasy hair all over Tony’s shoulder. “It’s- it’s my fault, Dad. I jumped. I jumped.”

Harry jumped.

Harry was the idiot who jumped from a speeding car and broke his leg.

Tony didn’t say anything, probably even more disappointed in finding out his son shared none of his brilliance, and just let Harry clutch on him.

When Harry felt boneless, hollowed out and limp against Tony, Tony kept rubbing Harry’s back with slow circles.

“I know you jumped,” Tony said quietly, his hold not wavering. He didn’t let Harry pull away when he tried, he just continued to hold him while Harry’s erratic gasping breaths slowed down. “I know- I know you jumped because you’re so freaking brilliant that you saw an opening and tried to take it. I know that you walked on a broken leg, like a god damned superhero, four blocks to a gas station, because you’re insanely brave.”

“Brilliant, brave,” Harry mocked him despite trying to bury himself further against Tony, wanting - just wanting to… to just feel like someone was there.

Harry never needed someone before, he really didn’t.

Harry didn’t need anyone in the cupboard. He didn’t need anyone when he saw the face of the man that killed his parents when he was only eleven. He didn’t need anyone when he thought he was dying in the chamber while Tom Riddle mocked him.

Harry didn’t need anyone during fourth year, not during the tasks, not when he was in the graveyard alone. He had Sirius, but he didn’t need him.

But Harry needed his dad so damned bad then that it was terrifying because Harry just kept ruining everything.

And Harry would ruin the way Tony held him then. He did it almost immediately.

“Did you know B- did you he killed your parents?” Harry asked Tony as he pulled him closer and kept his face hidden against his neck.

Tony stiffened, his muscles going tense for a moment, then he relaxed.

“I do,” he said evenly. “Sirius and Gandalf did some Jedi mind shit to Barnes and- and Sirius gave me an update.”

“I’m sorry,” Harry said again, his voice hoarse. That time he did pull away, slowly shifting off of Tony and on the spot beside him where he’d been before.

Tony turned to face Harry and put his hands on Harry’s face, lifting it up and forcing Harry to look in his eyes.

“Kid, none of this shit is your fault, alright? It’s Barnes and it’s mine and it’s Steve’s, but it’s not yours. You jumped, sure, and you broke your leg. You ever broken a bone before?”

Harry nodded uncertainly.

“And what happened?”

“I couldn’t wash dishes for a week until the swelling went down,” Harry said slowly, thinking of the broken wrist he had when he was nine. Tony’s face twisted in distaste, so Harry swiftly thought of the next time he broke a bone.

“Then Lockhart vanished my broken arm bone and it had to be regrown in the Hospital Wing,” Harry said. “And- and I broke my leg… same leg… in May and Madame Pomfrey healed it. Then… didn’t I break a rib in September?”

And then there was the time that B- that… that Harry’s arm had been broken, but Harry didn’t think Sirius told Tony about that and Harry wasn’t going to either.

When Harry had to consider it, it sounded like a lot of breaks actually. He didn’t even count the three or four times that he’d fractured his knuckles hitting something only to have Sirius or Madame Pomfrey heal them.

“Okay, exactly.” Tony smiled a little, but his eyes were unusually serious while they bore into Harry’s. “Every time you’ve had a broken bone before, aside from the wrist that we’ll discuss another time—”

Harry scowled, it was probably less impressive with his blotchy face and swollen eyes.

“—it’s been healed, instantly. You fly a broomstick hundreds of feet in the air, kid. Do you every worry about falling? Why would you think that any injury you got couldn’t be healed? If you jumped out of the car with Happy, or Pepper, because God knows she drives like a maniac, we’d go to the hospital for a cast or have Sirius heal it, right?”

Harry nodded again, much slower.

“So what makes you stupid for thinking ‘I need to get away and if I’m injured then I’ll get patched right up’?”

“I…” Harry opened his mouth and closed it again. Harry didn’t even consider getting injured when he jumped from the car. Harry never worried about falling when he flew.

Every one of Harry’s injuries since he turned eleven were magically healed.

“Come on,” Tony said abruptly. He heaved himself to his feet and grinned down at Harry. A grin that almost didn’t look fake. “It’s a Stark symptom to blame yourself for everything. You want to take a bath? I’ve got a huge tub in my room. Private with jets and you’re allowed to submerge that leg—”

“Stump,” Harry said quietly.

“You’re allowed to submerge your thigh,” Tony stressed, “in water now.”

“You’re going to lift a naked fifteen year old and put him in a bath?” Harry asked bitingly, masking him horrifying embarrassment behind bitterness. “That’s sick, maybe even illegal.”

“No, smartass,” Tony grinned crookedly and easily lifted Harry up and moved him to the damn chair. “I’m going to help you get in in your boxers- God, you’re wearing boxers right? Good,” he laughed when Harry nodded. “Then you can remove them yourself and by the time you get out, I’ll have something set up in your bathroom so you don’t need help. And tomorrow we’ll have a tub installed in your bathroom. No biggie.”

Harry’s stomach and his chest clenched at the way Tony listed a complete renovation as ‘no biggie’.

“I’ll find a way to repay you somehow,” Harry said, hating what a burden he was.

Tony paused just outside of his bedroom door and ducked his head down, pressing a firm kiss to Harry’s disgusting hair.

“You never have to repay me,” Tony said softly. “I love you, kid. You’re like the greatest son in the world.”

Harry reached backward and touched Tony’s fingers on the handle of his chair, just for a moment.

“I love you,” he said.

And he’d find a way to repay him, no matter what Tony said.

Chapter Text

With the renovators coming the next morning, Tony helped Harry get some pajamas on - an old MIT sweater of his and some sweat pants, a horrible experience that they were both going to pretend never happened - and put the kid in his own bed with his nightly medicine and a heavy dose of ‘dreamless sleep’.

Tony wished he could take dreamless sleep. Instead, Tony laid on one side of his bed, smoothing Harry’s hair off his face compulsively, thinking about all of it.

Barnes took Howard and Maria from him and then he tried to take Harry.

“We’re even,” the bastard said before. As if killing Darth Vader and some of his slimy minions could ever make up for what he did.

Barnes took Tony’s son and used him as a confessional booth to tell him that he killed Howard and Maria.

Barnes was so god damned lucky that Sirius stole Tony’s damn prisoner and took him to Magical BFE to inform ‘Gandalf the Great’ that Darth Vader was dead.

Sirius wouldn’t be so lucky when he came home with his tail between his legs, because Tony was going to kick his ass, but that was moot.

As soon as Harry was sound asleep, stretched out like a starfish that made Tony smile, Tony forced himself out of bed to go remedy the only thing he could at the moment.

Harry had no balance, no real strength. And it meant that the poor kid couldn’t take a freaking leak on his own.

 

The lab was the one place that Tony could still control. All the chaos within it - from the tools scattered where they didn’t belong to the discarded coffee mugs cluttering up the counters - was Tony’s chaos to command.

It was a comfort to be in his lab, doing something.

It didn’t take long for Tony to make a seat that Harry could use in his bathroom. It was set up like any other accessible seat, except with a few adjustments it also raised and lowered with the touch of a button so Harry could get on and off it more easily and the seat warmed up.

If Harry was going to have to sit down to use it, the least he deserved was a warm seat.

 

“I’m a burden, Dad.”

“I’m sorry I’m such a fucking burden, Howard.”

Tony wondered what Howard’s last thought was. He paused his work to wonder if Tony even crossed his mind before Barnes killed him. He didn’t doubt that Maria thought of him, but probably only after thinking of Howard.

 

Next, Tony snagged Harry’s wheelchair and began tinkering with it. If he made the arms drop on the sides, just slide up and down, then Harry could move them out of his way to climb out.

There was a better chair already ordered, one that Harry could control with the touch of a keypad so he didn’t feel like everyone had to push him if he was too tired to do it himself. But until then, Tony could make him feel more independent with his current one.

 

“Mate, I’m- I don’t know how to say this, but… but Barnes told Harry that he killed your mum and dad.”

“What? No, that’s insane. That’s some sort of- of psychological torture he put Harry through. They died in a wreck.”

“Are you sure? Cause Harry thought his parents died in a car wreck too.”

Of course Tony was sure. He’d spent days pouring over the reports.

Howard had went off the road, smashed a tree. He must have hit the steering wheel hard enough to cause a brain bleed. The cops said he had to have been speeding to cause such… such extensive injuries.

But Howard didn’t speed. How many lectures had Tony sat through after wrecking a car because of his speed?

“You won’t get anywhere any quicker if you die, Anthony.”

 

Impulsively, Tony added a built in speaker to Harry’s chair that would operate on Bluetooth so he could play the crap music he was so fond of. Then he took the seat and the chair in the painting booth and made the chair the red and gold colors that Harry liked. The toilet adaption seat just got a gold finish, something that might make it look less like medical equipment.

After fashioning a couple of gold finished bars for Harry to use to grip, Tony left the chair in the living room and took the rest of it to Harry’s bathroom. Harry would have to use Tony’s bathroom once the renovators arrived, but Tony could at least show it to him in the morning before moving it.

Tony got the seat and the bars set up and looked at it proudly.

If Harry grabbed the bars he hooked up, he could drag himself from his chair, after dropping the arm down, to the brand new handicap accessible toilet.

… handicap accessible toilet.

Tony’s kid was handicapped.

Tony’s son was handicapped.

Harry was handicapped.

In a moment of calmness that Tony knew he’d never be able to describe to anyone later, he walked from Harry’s bathroom back to his lab and grabbed a sledgehammer.

While it took Tony two hours to adjust Harry’s wheelchair to drop the arm and to create the easy seat for Harry to use, it only took him thirty minutes to smash every inch of that bathroom. Tony didn’t stop until water was spraying everywhere from busted pipes, masking the hot tears pouring down his cheeks, and the bathroom was nothing but rubble.

 

That was where Pepper found him when she arrived at five am, curled up in a ball on the destroyed bathroom floor, screaming about the unfairness of the world to himself.

“Coffee and a shower,” she said, putting her arms around Tony and helping him to his feet with a kind smile that Tony didn’t deserve. “Come on, Tony.”

Tony looked around at the destruction and sighed, his chest aching. “I’m sorry, Pep. I just…”

“I know,” Pepper said. She walked Tony out of the room, one hand between his shoulders and the other holding his arm. “Let’s get you cleaned up before Harry gets up, okay?”

Tony nodded, feeling like a kid being led around by his mother.

 

How much pain had Maria been in? Did Barnes kill her first or make her watch him kill Howard first?

 

Pepper and Tony entered his room on tiptoe, both of them pausing to see that Harry was still snoring soundly on Tony’s bed.

“Did you have to give him a potion?” Pepper whispered while Tony found a set of clean clothes in his closet.

“He won’t sleep without it,” Tony said truthfully. He checked on Harry one more time, not even minding that the dog was curled up next to Harry, getting fur and drool all over Tony’s sheets.

Pepper sighed and nodded. Tony watched as she moved over to the bed and sat carefully on the side so she could reach out and brush her hand across Harry’s forehead.

“If you’re interested in playing Mom, I can have an officiant here in an hour,” Tony said, working hard to find a playful voice.

Pepper tossed Tony a smile and a roll of her eyes. “Go shower, Tony.”

“Yes, Mommy,” Tony quipped with a fond half-smile.

It was good that Pepper was home, things felt more normal with her there. Or, at a minimum, Tony knew that Pepper Potts would make a list to put everything back on track.

 

Tony took as long as he dared in the shower, trying to wash away thoughts of his parents down the drain with the grime.

They were gone. They were dead.

They’d been dead for a long time.

Tony couldn’t help them, but he had a kid that he could help.

Somehow…

 

Harry was still sleeping in Tony’s bed when he came out of the shower. Harry looked like a kid… just any kid in the world… when he slept. His face was relaxed and his lashes just barely dusted his cheekbone. Harry’s hair was a wreck, he’d went to sleep with it wet and it looked like a mess.

He probably needed a haircut soon.

But, as much as outward appearances meant to Tony, a haircut was sort of low on a list of priorities.

 

“God, Tony, you look like hell,” Pepper said. She sat at the kitchen counter, occasionally wincing at the sound of the builders in Harry’s room. Pepper nodded toward the counter. “Coffee’s hot.”

“Insert obligatory ‘you’re hot’ joke here,” Tony said tiredly. He poured himself a full cup of coffee and then collapsed in the seat beside Pepper. “Are they making any progress in there or just a ton of noise?”

“Progress,” Pepper assured him. She slid a pink box of donuts from Tony’s favorite bakery toward him. “Eat and then we need to discuss the rest of the renovations needed.”

“What other renovations?” Tony asked blankly while he grabbed a chocolate glazed from the box.

Pepper sighed and gestured around the penthouse. “Tony, until Harry has the strength to begin using a prosthetic, everything is out of chair reach. Where’s he supposed to cook? Make food? Do homework?”

Tony looked around, seeing the elevated kitchen counters, the bar top they sat at, even the video game equipment was in drawers out of reach.

“He fell yesterday, trying to see up here,” Tony said. He pinched the bridge of his nose and then rubbed his forehead hard. “God damn, I didn’t even think about lowering all the freaking counters for him.”

“Why would you?” Pepper said. “Tony, you’ve got a million and five things floating around in that brilliant brain of yours. The height of your counters just wasn’t one, that’s why I’m here.”

Tony reached out and grabbed Pepper’s hand, waiting until she looked him in the eyes.

“I love you,” he said genuinely. Tony squeezed her hand when Pepper rolled her eyes. “No, really, Pep, thank you. I… I don’t think I could do this without you.”

Having a kid was hard enough, but- but a kid with all the problems Harry was going to have? Nothing had ever made Tony want to drink more.

And, annoyingly, nothing had ever prevented him from drinking more.

“Tony, you’re doing amazing,” Pepper said, gentling her voice and her gaze going soft. “It takes a village to raise a child, don’t forget you have that, okay?”

Tony swallowed down a sleep deprived lump in his throat and nodded. “So complete renovation, huh?”

“Yes,” Pepper said, moving right along. She pulled a tablet from her purse and Tony nearly smiled to see that there was a list, complete with open squares to check items off, pulled up. “You and Harry should go on a trip while they renovate. You can go somewhere nice, somewhere warm even. Not the place in Malibu, it’s not accessible at all.”

“I’ll ask Harry,” Tony said, imagining sandy beaches (that Harry couldn’t walk on) or clear oceans (that Harry couldn’t swim in). “What else?”

“Physical therapy,” Pepper said smartly. “I’ve found Doctor Torres at New York Presbyterian, she’s the highest rated one in our area. I like what she’s doing with swimming therapy. It’s innovative and gaining a lot of attention.”

“Book her,” Tony nodded, trusting Pepper’s judgment. “Next?”

“School,” Pepper went on, making a note on her tablet. “When does Harry want to return to Midtown?”

“He doesn’t,” Tony told her. “Not now, maybe not ever. Let’s find a tutor and not Spider-Kid,” he added hastily. “Harry needs lessons on math, not mouth to mouth.”

“I’ll send out some feelers and see if I can find someone quickly,” Pepper said. She hadn’t even looked up, the woman was sometimes more robot than Tony. “And that just leaves—”

“Mister Stark, Mister Harry is awake.”

Tony jumped up, spilling some of his coffee that he had in his hands as he did.

“Hold that thought, Pep,” Tony said distractedly. What was the morning medicine? Sleeping medicine, antidepressant, antibiotics at night… Adderall and nutrition potion in the morning.

“Hey, grab one of the oatmeal colored tubes and Harry’s Adderall from the cabinet over the stove, will you?” Tony asked Pepper. “I’ll be right back.”

Tony booked it to his bedroom, knocking twice before poking his head in with a smile. “Morning, kid. How ya feeling?”

Harry lifted his head from his pillow long enough for Tony to see his eyes were wide and his hair was wild. He blinked a couple of times at Tony, looking lost.

“Hungry?” Tony asked him. “Need to—”

Harry’s entire upper body twitched when a loud bang from his bathroom could be heard clear in Tony’s room and Tony hated the way the blood drained from his face and his eyes began flicking around erratically.

“It’s the builders,” Tony said. He stepped in the room and kicked the door shut behind him, muffling some of the noise. “They’re putting the fanciest tub I could find in your bathroom.”

Harry bit his lower lip, his eyes dropping, and Tony breezed past it since it clearly wasn’t the right thing to say.

“Pepper brought donuts,” Tony told his unresponsive son. Harry seemed to have moods back and forth, talking and silence. Tony was a pro at speaking aloud though, so he tried to not let it unnerve him. “I had a text from the Dogfather this morning, he’s coming back home tonight.”

And bringing Gandalf, apparently.

“And I had your bathroom set up but the builders destroyed it so if you need help, I’m willing to pretend like it’s never happened.”

“Brilliant,” Harry muttered quietly.

“This might cheer you up,” Tony said, throwing his closet doors open dramatically and waving his hand to the newly updated wheelchair inside. “Before you think ‘it’s just a boring chair with red and gold paint’ let me show you the new features.”

Tony went over the upgrades of the chair, the speaker, the easy drop arms, the heated cushioning, while Harry watched with eyes that were entirely too dull to be normal.

The dog, the damn dog, jumped up and licked Harry on the cheek though, which at least brought some life to his eyes.

“So bathroom, breakfast, take the dog out?” Tony said, nodding to himself when Harry didn’t reply. “Then we can go crash in Sirius’ place until they’re done in your bathroom. It’s so damned loud out there I can’t even hear myself think.”

Which wasn’t entirely true, but Harry got tired just sitting most of the time and he’d never be able to get any rest while they were jacking around in the other room.

When Harry didn’t offer up any complaints or comments one way or another, Tony lifted him up and sat him in the chair to push him toward the bathroom. It probably should have been painfully awkward, propping Harry up against his side while he did his business, but Tony had shared side-by-side urinals in bars before and just chattered away to keep Harry from feeling embarrassed.

Tony talked about a vacation, mentioning half a dozen different places, clear up until Harry had washed his hands and they were walking back in the living room where Pepper had thoughtfully moved to the much more Harry-capable couch.

“Harry!” Pepper was on her feet in an instant and rushed over to wrap Harry in a hug while Tony watched from behind the handlebars.

“Oh, baby, how are you?” Pepper asked, pulling away just enough to smile at Harry. “You look tired and skinny, your dad isn’t feeding you, is he?” Pepper stood up and winked at Tony before pushing him away from Harry’s chair with a bump of her hip. “I’ve got donuts and your super surprise sixteenth birthday gift.”

Harry turned his head and gave Pepper a curious look. “My birthday isn’t for ages?”

“So?” Pepper shrugged. She parked Harry beside the couch and then took the seat closest to him, leaving Tony to take his chair. Pepper grabbed her tablet off the coffee table and began swiping away while nodding at Harry’s medicine sitting beside a raspberry filled donut. “Take your medicine and eat then you can see.”

Tony went to grab it for Harry and only hesitated when Pepper cleared her throat.

“Harry can reach it,” Pepper said lightly. She smiled at Harry, her sweet little ‘I’m in charge and you know it’ smile. “Medicine. Food.”

Tony was on the edge of his seat, literally, when Harry slowly leaned forward and grabbed the orange pill bottle. Harry scrunched his nose after he swallowed the pill down with the nutrition potion Sirius got for him and Tony was quick to grab him a cup of coffee.

Pepper gave Tony ‘a look’, but Harry seemed grateful for the drink so Tony settled back and tried to not hover while Harry picked apart a third of his donut and Pepper revealed her grand surprise.

“Okay, Harry, see this program?” Pepper flipped the tablet around, showing Harry the design screen for the StarkCar. “This will walk you through the system, from start to finish, and let you design your first car.”

Harry blinked at her and Tony huffed irritably.

He should have thought about that. They had a little over eight months until Harry’s birthday, but designing a car - from the style to engine size to the color and texture of the interior - took a while to get completed.

Harry, apparently, didn’t agree with them.

“Hilarious,” he snapped at Pepper, turning his face away from her. “Hysterical, really.”

Pepper sat the tablet on Harry’s lap, bravely thinking he wouldn’t just toss it away.

“See? This is why I knew it would be a good surprise today,” she said calmly. “You think I’m being cruel? Harry, do you actually think I would do that to you?”

Harry glanced over at her, his frosty exterior melting just a little. “I have one bloody leg,” Harry hissed. “How am I supposed to drive like that? Or did you want me to pick a car to have someone drive me around like they move me around?”

“Harry, no—”

Pepper raised her hand, silencing Tony’s quick retort. “Harry, this is not the end of your life. You will drive, you will laugh, you will live again. So I am telling you to start designing a car today so that when you turn sixteen your dad can stick a giant bow on the hood, we can all scream surprise, and you can drive it. You. Will. Have. A. Normal. Life. Got it?” she asked sternly, as hard as she’d ever been on the kid.

Tough love was tough to watch, but Tony grinned and relaxed when Harry glared at Pepper before snatching up the tablet and glaring at the screen.

‘Best stepmom ever,’ Tony mouthed to Pepper over Harry’s head with a wink.

‘I know,’ she shot right back.

 

It was always good when Pepper was home. It was… it was just the missing wheel that kept the belt on track, really.

 

Tony had a good time for about an hour, describing the pros and cons of every body style of car to Harry. Harry didn’t make a single decision, he started nodding off while Tony tried to convince him to go with a sensible and safe sedan.

“Why don’t you take him down to Sirius’ place and both of you grab a nap?” Pepper suggested. “Make him design a car when he wakes up. It’s good for him to have something to look forward to. Something normal that isn’t just a bathtub or accessible counters.”

“I thought he’d look forward to a prosthetic,” Tony admitted. “He doesn’t want one.”

Even though Tony already had the materials ordered and the blueprints finished. It was amazing the things he could accomplish when he couldn’t sleep.

“Of course he doesn’t,” Pepper scoffed. She got up and shot a look toward Harry’s room, leaving no question on what she planned to do while Harry rested and Tony hovered. “Tony, be serious, he was kidnapped and traumatized by a man with a prosthetic arm. Give him time, he’ll come around. And if not, who cares?”

“Pepper, he can’t just… just not replace his leg,” Tony whispered. What would that look like? Harry just… never walking again? When there was a whole world of prosthetics available? When Tony had dual degrees from MIT and an entire laboratory to dedicate solely to a single leg?

Tony could create legs that would respond to Harry’s thoughts, his mood. Tony could create a leg so realistic that Harry could tattoo it if he felt like getting a tattoo.

And Harry wanted none of it.

“Educate yourself, Tony,” Pepper said firmly. She pulled her phone out and turned her back to him. “I’ve sent you an email. Take a nap first, then read. I’ll wake you when lunch is ready.”

 

“‘Educate yourself’,” Tony mocked Pepper as he pushed Harry’s chair to the elevator. “I’m supposed to educate myself? Pft.”

“‘M sleeping,” Harry murmured, startling Tony and causing his eyes to look down guiltily.

“Hey, kid,” Tony said quietly, hoping Harry hadn’t been awake long. “I thought you were asleep.”

“I woke up when you started whining that I don’t want a fake leg,” Harry said. He clenched his eyes hard for a moment and it had Tony automatically reaching for one of the instant pain potions he’d taken to carrying around in his pocket for him.

Tony waited until Harry finished the pain reliever off before clearing his throat awkwardly as they arrived on Sirius’ currently empty floor.

“You don’t have to get a prosthetic right now, you know? If you don’t want one, then fuck it, you know?”

Harry unexpectedly grabbed the brakes of his chair and slamming them hard. He turned in his chair and looked up at Tony with a face so perfectly blank that Tony knew it was hiding something rough.

“I don’t want a fake leg,” he said with his chin raised high. “I- I know it makes everything harder for you, but—”

“What? No, wait!” Tony shook his head, a little insulted at Harry’s insinuation. “Kid, I don’t give a damn if you have one leg or seven. You’re not a burden either way. If you don’t want it, fine. I’m sure tons of people live happy one-legged lives, just- just hopping along.”

Anthony Stark, for the love of God… time and place.

There were too many times that Tony’s mouth ran ahead of his brain. Elvita Adams was a good instance of it, ‘hopping along’ was another.

Harry’s mouth opened some and he gawked at Tony, momentarily just as shocked at what Tony said as Tony was. Then, because there was a merciful god somewhere in the world, Harry’s lips curled up in a teeny-tiny small grin.

“Rude thing to say to a kid in a wheelchair,” Harry snarked. “It’s not like I can stand up and fight you about it.”

If Harry wanted to do self-deprecation, Tony could do self-deprecation all day long.

Tony was king of self-deprecation.

“Just make sure if you join any gangs, you join the blue side, they’re the crips,” Tony advised him with a grin. “You’ll roll around with them just fine.”

“Roll around?” Harry scoffed. He turned back around and Tony saw his longing look toward Sirius’ plush L-shaped sofa. “Weak.”

“Cut me some slack, I’m running on E,” Tony said. He reached down and picked Harry up from the chair and put him on the short length of the couch, leaving the long length for himself.

Harry gingerly sat Pepper’s tablet on the coffee table and looked at Tony until Tony laid his head down on the armrest and had his feet by Harry’s… Harry’s foot.

Singular.

Tony tossed blankets over both of them and thought maybe he’d close his eyes, just rest his eyelids for a moment until Harry went to sleep, but Mother Mary he was tired.

“Dad?”

Tony hummed and couldn’t even open his eyes at Harry’s quiet and tired call.

“You… you know how you say you love me?”

Tony grinned crookedly. “I know I do love you, kid.”

“What if… what if I don’t ever want a fake leg? What if I’m just making your life harder because- because I can’t use a fake leg?”

 

“Would you love me if I was an idiot, Dad? Huh? Do you even love me now?”

“Anthony, you’re acting disgraceful. Are you drunk?”

 

“Harry, nothing could ever make me not love you,” Tony said with an itching sort of vulnerability. He peeked one eye open and saw that Harry was doing the exact same thing. “One leg, peg leg, red leg, blue leg; it doesn’t make a difference to me.”

Harry’s tense shoulders relaxed some and he closed his eyes. “Thanks.”

Tony gave Harry a tired and lazy salute. “Shh, I’m sleeping,” he joked.

Harry grinned, Tony grinned, and they were both asleep within moments.

 

Tony didn’t know what Harry dreamt of, but Tony dreamt of his parents- imagining their last moments.

Who went first?

Who had to watch the other one be murdered?

What were Maria’s last words? Howard’s?

Did Barnes even consider letting them live?

Did he get whatever he wanted from them? Or did he have any ulterior motives? Did Barnes kill them for fun?

Did either of them think of their son - their only son - in their last moments?

 

Tony would have thought of Harry.

 

Pepper arrived around noon and left a pan of lasagna, a dozen breadsticks, and a note for Tony and Harry to stay at Sirius’ place until the builders were done with Harry’s bathroom.

Tony spent about half an hour over lunch dissecting the heart on the note with Harry.

“Do you think it means ‘I love you like a friend’ or ‘Tony, I’m so passionately obsessed with you, kiss me!’?” Tony asked Harry, sliding the marinara to Harry’s end of the coffee table. “Dip your breadstick in that like a normal human being, kid. Trust me, I’m doing you a favor.”

Harry was sitting up on the couch, looking stronger than he had in a while. There was some color to his cheeks and Tony liked seeing him sitting up with a normal blanket covering his leg instead of the cloak that made him look like half his body was missing. Harry was swapping back and forth between eating and browsing options for a StarkCar.

So far, Harry hadn’t even chosen a body style yet, but at least he was still looking.

“Quit shagging random blokes and ask her on a normal date,” Harry said. “Like… buy her flowers, or chocolate- no, buy her shoes,” he said seriously. “Pepper loves shoes.”

“A nice pair of pumps would be the way to her heart,” Tony agreed. It was the most Harry had talked in weeks and if he wanted to dissect Pepper’s humiliating and all-consuming crush on Tony, so be it.

“Okay, new shoes and then what? A movie and some kissing in a skatepark? That’s standard for dates nowadays, right?” Tony grinned.

Harry glowered at Tony and Tony barked out a laugh when Harry threw a piece of lasagna at his head.

“Peter and I are- we’re over. Can we not talk about him anymore?”

Tony frowned at the quick flash of sadness that washed over Harry’s face before he dropped his head down and began poking at his food.

“Okay, I’m going to count to five and then we’re both going to say what’s on our minds,” Tony said. It was something he used to do with Rhodey back in college. Rhodey could vent about his classes and Tony could bitch about whatever woman of the week was clinging to him. “Ready? One… two… three… four…”

“Peter doesn’t need a one legged boyfriend.”

“Pepper could do better.”

Tony blinked at his son, just as surprised by what came out of Harry’s mouth as Harry seemed to be by what Tony said.

“Harry, no…” Tony slid down the couch to sit by Harry, pulling him to his side. “He’s half-spider, who cares about a missing leg?”

Harry snorted and rested his head on Tony’s shoulder, leaning in to Tony’s embrace. “Pepper likes you, but you’re a slag. Quit being a slag and she’ll go out with you.”

“Quit being a dick and Petey will go out with you,” Tony said.

“Or we swear off love forever.”

Tony laughed and hugged Harry a little tighter. “That’s not going to happen, kid. We’re Stark’s, we’re destined for love.”

“We’re destined for disappointment,” Harry said quietly, sounding pretty pathetic.

Tony rested his head on Harry’s and sighed.

 

“Barnes told Harry that he killed your mum and dad.”

 

“Yeah, that too.”

 

They were cleared to return to their place around three and Tony took Harry on a tour around his new bathroom.

The counters were all ‘wheelchair height’ and the tub had jets and an opening door thing. The toilet was… was handicapped accessible.

“The walls are wet so don’t touch them,” Tony said, forcing himself to sound cheerful about the whole thing. “You want to test out the tub? Look, there’s like five different detachable shower heads so you can wash your hair and—”

“I bet this was expensive…” Harry said softly, looking around the pretty damn nice bathroom. Tony didn’t think that was a compliment though, so he waved it off.

“Nah, I got a good deal,” Tony lied. “I’ll just… uh… leave you to it?”

Harry nodded and so Tony backed out, letting Harry have his victory moment of independence.

His very expensive victory moment of independence that Tony would have paid three times as much for his kid to have.

 

“JARVIS, if he so much as slips or starts breathing weird, alert me,” Tony ordered his faithful AI when he anxiously sat in his office, throwing a tennis ball up and catching it.

“Very good, sir. Mister Parker has arrived, would you like me to allow him entrance?”

Tony sighed. He’d initiated PHaT-K lockdown the night before, desperately just needing… time. Tony had needed time to wrap his head around everything before Gandalf came and before the world had to spin again.

But Spider-Kid had found Barnes and Tony didn’t hate the kid as much as he planned to.

“Alright, sure,” Tony said irritably. “Tell him to come in here though, he’s not going to go jump in the tub with Harry.”

“Yes, sir,” JARVIS replied, managing to sound amused.

Tony waited tensely for Peter to arrive, just throwing the tennis ball again and again. He glanced down when his phone went off, a text from Strange that he planned on ignoring.

Strange had insisted that Harry needed to continue with his lessons, ‘for normalcy’, and Tony had told him in no uncertain terms to fuck off. Harry needed a chance to breathe, adjust to the new normal.

God knew they all did.

And normal didn’t usually include teenage boys storming in Tony’s office with a skateboard under one arm and a check in the other hand.

“I don’t care how rich you are, I’m not someone you can bribe,” Peter told Tony. He waved the check around and had a whole little righteous set to his jaw.

“Good to see you too, Pete,” Tony quipped. He squinted at the check until he recognized it as one he’d sent out last week. “It’s not a bribe, it’s yours.”

“Did you pay me to come talk to Harry? Or because if I’m not rich then I’m not good enough for him?” Peter asked, standing straight with his spine set like steel. He held the check out to Tony like it was diseased or going to bounce. “I love your son, and I don’t care if you think I’m not good enough for him. I’ve been giving him space because he’s going through something pretty freaking messed up, but you can’t bribe me to come over. I don’t want your money.”

Tony blinked.

Not many things could catch Tony Stark off guard, but that little rant did the trick.

“Pete, I sent you that check because it’s the reward money for finding Barnes,” Tony explained slowly, not really used to teenagers that weren’t his ranting at him. “The extra ten k is standard payment for the members of the Avengers after a mission.”

Okay, maybe Tony only usually cut checks for eight grand, but Pete was a minor so Tony threw him a little extra for hazard pay.

Peter was the one who looked caught off-guard then. He reared back like Tony had punched him.

Which Tony absolutely didn’t do.

“I didn’t catch Barnes for the money,” Peter said. He slapped the check for $510,000 on Tony’s desk. “I caught him because he nearly killed Harry.”

Tony relaxed his shoulders and smirked up at Peter. “So you don’t want the money?”

“I don’t want a bribe,” Peter said curtly. To the kid’s credit, his eyes didn’t even flick once to that check. “And I don’t need paid for being Spiderman.”

Tony laughed and picked the check up, holding it back out for Peter. “You got a savings account, kid?”

“I’ve got a trust fund from my parents,” Peter said slowly. “Why?”

Tony waved a hand, inviting the kid to have a seat. “This is your money. Spend it on college, a car, booze or blow, I don’t care. But let’s get it in an account where it can grow interest while you pretend like this money isn’t going to change your life, alright?”

Peter took a seat and Tony launched in a discussion about IRA’s, interest, investments, and the nitty gritty details that Peter seemed to follow with ease. By the end of it, Tony had most of Peter’s money in an interest growing account and fifty grand in a checking account for him to spend how he wanted.

“My aunt is going to freak,” Peter said after Tony printed out the information on his accounts and handed them over. The kid’s eyes were huge and made Tony chuckle. “Just… just totally going to freak.”

“Bring her over for dinner sometime,” Tony offered. “If you’re going to be working with Sirius again, probably be best if I smooth things over with the parental unit.”

“Oh, yeah, I’m not doing that,” Peter said absently, staring down at the papers still. “Harry would kick my ass.”

Pete just got better and better really.

“Hey, you wanna stay for dinner?” Tony asked him. “Harry’s in a decent mood and we can get takeout or something.”

“Yeah?” Peter looked up then. “He won’t mind?”

Probably. But the kid couldn’t just go around thinking nobody would ever love him because of a silly little leg.

Harry was still Harry.

And, against his better judgement, Tony was starting to like Pete.

 

Peter trailed behind Tony as he went to the living room. Tony planned on going to check on Harry, only to find Harry sitting in his wheelchair in the living room, in clean clothes, looking smug as hell.

“I— oh.” Harry’s smug look dropped almost immediately when he saw Peter and Tony winced when Harry quickly snatched a blanket off the sofa and covered himself with it.

“I came to yell at your dad and he invited me for dinner,” Peter said nonchalantly. He strutted over to the couch and draped himself across the back. “Iron Man or Gryffindor?” he asked, nodding to Harry’s chair.

“What would you know about Gryffindor?” Harry scoffed, turning his head from Peter.

Tony figured they could just… figure it out… while he went to order dinner, Pepper, and wine.

Not necessarily in that order.

*****

Albus wants to meet in the morning with the whole team.

Good for him. Where’s my prisoner?

Can I come home without him?

Tony looked up from his text conversation with Sirius to see that Harry and Peter were playing a game on the Xbox, Peter’s idea.

From behind, just seeing the back of Harry’s head while he ran his mouth to Peter, shit talking, it looked so normal.

It looked like any other kid hanging out in the afternoon with his friend.

It didn’t look like a kid who got kidnapped and dragged from the country and left in a motel to die.

All done by the man who killed Tony’s parents.

No.

Sirius stole the prisoner, he could spend another night at his place in London.

 

Pepper arrived with dinner, wine, and a packet that she slapped down on the coffee table in front of Harry.

“You and your dad are going to the Montcalm Royal tomorrow night,” she told Harry. “It’s a seven day stay. Rest, relax, see the sights.”

“I grew up in Surrey?” Harry said skeptically.

“Did you see any sights?” Pepper asked.

Harry rolled his eyes, which was a pretty clear answer.

“And when you two get back, we’re having Thanksgiving dinner and we are doing physical therapy and tutoring. Am I understood, gentlemen?”

“Ma’am, yes, ma’am!” Tony quipped. He stole the wine from Pepper and held it up. “Boys, wine?”

“God, yes,” Peter breathed, tossing the controller on the table.

 

Pepper made ‘disapproving parent noises’ during dinner when Tony let each of the boys have a glass of wine, but Harry was in a better mood than he’d been in since before- before.

They all talked some, the boys made snarky comments about their classmates, Tony flirted with Pepper. Harry even ate almost an entire serving of chicken parm, which was more than he’d ate in eons.

It was so normal that Tony wanted to cry.

 

“I think Peter’s good for Harry,” Pepper said. The boys went to Harry’s room after dinner, leaving Tony and Pepper to relax on the couch with glasses of wine. Pepper had her socked feet in Tony’s lap and Tony couldn’t think of anywhere he’d rather be. “Do you think they’ll get back together?”

Tony hummed. “Maybe if Harry stops thinking people only liked him before, yeah.”

Pepper snorted and took a long sip of her wine. “I cannot imagine where he got that sort of diminished self-confidence from.”

“What is that supposed to mean, Miss Potts?” Tony asked, feigning outrage. “I’ll have you know that Lily Potter was nothing but confident.”

“I mean you, stupid,” Pepper grinned. She wiggled her feet in Tony’s lap until Tony got the hint. Tony put his wine glass on the table and began rubbing her feet. The woman deserved it, she was fixing everything single-handedly.

The real hero in the tower was Pepper Potts.

“Tony, that boy has your insecurities—”

Tony and Pepper both jolted when they heard Harry scream.

“WHAT? WHAT MAKES ME MORE OF A FREAK? THE MAGIC OR THE MISSING LEG?!”

“There’s that Stark confidence I was talking about,” Pepper sighed.

“You think Peter said something?” Tony asked hesitantly. He didn’t want to think Pete - the same kid that helped Tony find all the photos of Harry for his birthday and charged in with a check for over half a million dollars and planned on burning it for Harry’s sake - would go around calling Harry a freak. But Tony didn’t think Harry’s shout was exactly promising either.

“Nope. I think our kid needs locked in there until they figure it out,” Pepper said. She drained her wine glass and leaned back on the armrest. “God. You two are so alike.”

“Handsome? Charming? Talented beyond reason?”

“I JUMPED! I JUMPED OUT OF THE CAR JUST LIKE I JUMPED OFF THE ROOF!”

“The self-confidence of an ant,” Pepper said.

“Oh, Jesus,” Tony sighed. He looked up and saw Pepper reflecting his own misery right back to him. “Do I go grab Petey and save him from Harry’s wrath?”

Pepper closed her eyes and rubbed her forehead, looking exhausted. “I—”

“I GOT CEDRIC KILLED AND I PROBABLY GOT BUCKY LOCKED UP AND I AM RUINING EVERYTHING! I HAVE ONE FUCKING LEG BECAUSE ONLY STUPID HARRY POTTER WOULD JUMP FROM A CAR, RIGHT?!”

“Daily therapy,” Pepper murmured to herself. “Every single day for a month. No, six months. Tony, go break it up, okay?”

“Yeah…” Tony got up and moved to Harry’s room, stepping in just to catch the last part of Harry’s red-faced screaming rant.

“NOBODY’S SURPRISED THOUGH, ARE THEY?” Harry screamed. He was sitting in his wheelchair, his chest heaving, and tears streaming down his face. Peter earned himself a couple begrudging points though, he just stood inside the bedroom door, letting Harry take all his anger out on him. “I’M A COWARD, UNWORTHY TO HOLD A HAMMER, CAN’T PASS BLOODY CHEMISTRY, WITH A BRAIN FULL OF DEFICITS AND A HAND CALLING ME A LIAR!”

Harry laughed then, a terrifying sound since it sounded so vulnerable and broken. “AND NOW I’VE GOT ANOTHER SCAR FOR MY FUCKED UP COLLECTION!”

“Time to go, Pete,” Tony quipped quietly. He put his hands on Peter’s shoulders and turned him around, pushing him toward the door.

Peter let Tony push him away and Tony shut the door behind the poor kid.

“Harry… come on…” Tony knelt down and went to pick Harry up.

“DON’T FUCKING GRAB ME!” Harry screamed, jerking his torso to the side. Harry’s eyes were burning with the same sort of horribly deep loathing for himself, for the world, that Tony used to see in the mirror every morning. “I LOST A LEG, NOT THE RIGHT TO NOT BE LIFTED UP LIKE A BLOODY INFANT!”

“You’re right, you’re right,” Tony said, immediately holding his hands up. It wasn’t as if Tony wouldn’t be the same way. Damn, he’d been carrying Harry around like a toddler, not even asking first, just assuming since the kid had been so quiet.

“I’m sorry,” Tony said calmly. He raised his eyebrows pointedly. “Do you want to grab my arms and—” for the love of God, do not say ‘hop’ “—and climb in bed?” he offered, not missing a beat even while he berated himself.

There was a time and place for horribly morbid jokes, that wasn’t the time or place really.

Harry glared at Tony for a long moment, weighing him up.

“I’ve got to use the loo first,” Harry snapped. He grabbed the wheels of his chair and pushed hard, almost running Tony’s toes over in the process.

Tony looked around the too-clean room while Harry was in the bathroom, hating it. He liked it more when Harry had been running around, making a mess, eating all the cereal in the place.

When Harry wheeled himself out of the bathroom, his face still red and swollen but the snot and tears washed away, Tony waited until he was beside his bed to make his offer again.

“Want a hand getting in bed?” Tony said.

“No,” Harry said with a snarl. He crossed his arms over his chest and glared at the bed as if it had personally wronged him.

“Peter said he loved me again,” Harry said, apropos of absolutely nothing. “Like he- he just… he just…”

Tony was there in an instant when Harry bent at the waist and started crying the most heartbreaking sobs.

“You- you had to spend all this money and my hips hurt all the time and I tried to throw a book and I couldn’t even do it because my arms are tired for no reason!”

“I know, I know.” Tony went ahead and picked Harry up, swinging him in his bed, half on Tony’s chest and half across the middle of the bed. “It’ll get better, it really will.”

“How would you know?!” Harry asked with a strangled sob that was muffled by Tony’s chest. “You’ve got great legs!”

Any other day, Tony would have laughed. Tony would have made a witty joke and veered the conversation to safer waters.

But it wasn’t any other day, it was Harry thinking he was alone and unlovable and… and damn Tony didn’t realize if he had a son that he’d be just like him.

Poor kid.

“Everyone says ‘I know what you’re going through’, but they don’t, how can they?” Tony said. He kept Harry cradled on his chest, calming himself with the familiar feeling of Harry’s thick hair between his fingers. “I… I don’t know what exactly you’re going through, but I’ve got a decent idea about some of it.

“I was in Afghanistan, you would have been… five, yeah, five. Anyway, I was there to promote a new weapon Stark Tech had developed…”

 

Tony talked until Harry was snoring on his chest and Tony followed behind a few minutes later.

Hermione changed Ginger to Ron Weasley.

Hermione: Boys, shut up. Harry, how are you?

Hermione: Harry

Ron: Slytherin won the last match against Gryffindor.

Harry: Fuck.

Ron: Not really. How ru?

Harry: Pissed now.

Peter: He’s in London, living it up in some fancy hotel.

Hermione: Oh! That sounds fun!

Ron: Everyone shut up. Harry, guess what Dad said?

Harry: ?

Ron: U-Know-Who is dead.

Harry: Yeah I know.

Hermione: WHAT DO YOU MEAN ‘YOU KNOW’?!

Peter: Who the fuck is U-Know-Who?

Ron: U know.

Harry: Siri & Dumbledore came before we left this morning and talked to Tony. V’s dead. B’s in St Mungo’s.

Ron: It’s going to be hard for people to take sides. On one hand, B killed V. On the other hand, B almost killed the Boy Who Lived.

Hermione: RONALD WEASLEY!

Peter: Who’s the Boy Who Lived?

Ron: It’s a boy who lived

Harry: I gotta go. T wants to ‘sight see’.

Hermione: Go see the Tower of London! It’s amazing the history behind it!

Harry: Is it wheelchair accessible?

Hermione: I…

Hermione: I have no idea.

Harry: Bye.

 

Hermione Granger to Peter Parker: How is he? Really?

Peter: Hermione, you’d ask me to betray Harry’s confidence?

Peter: Tell me who Cedric is and I will  

Hermione: A classmate that got killed in front of Harry.

Hermione: Harry blames himself, of course.

Peter: Harry’s blaming himself for everything.

Peter: Seems to be a thing of his, I guess.

 

Harry Stark to No Spiders Allowed: I got in a fight.

Ron: Bet you didn’t win.

Hermione: Ronald, I swear to God.

Harry: Lol this woman had one arm

Harry: I said I was jealous

Harry: We got in a fight over which was worse.

Hermione: Harry…

Peter: LMAO

Peter: Losing a leg is way worse than an arm. Is she serious?

Harry: That’s what I said.

Harry: She’s walking around acting like having one arm is a problem?

Ron: I dunno mate… you can fly with one leg.

Harry: I could still catch a snitch with one arm.

Hermione: You all are terrible.

Peter: What’s a snitch?

Ron: Like a tattletale.

 

Peter Parker to Sirius Black: What’s a snitch?

Sirius: It’s a ball with wings, tiny. Seeker has to catch it to end a match.

Sirius: Hang on. I’ll send you a video.

Sirius: videoattachment.vid

Peter: Thanks

 

Peter Parker to No Spiders Allowed: How could you catch a snitch with one hand?

Ron: Harry could catch it blind.

Hermione: Harry caught it with a shattered arm once.

Ron: Harry nearly caught it with a dozen dementors swarming the field.

Harry: I caught it with my mouth once.

Peter: Are we at the part of the post-breakup where I can make wildly inappropriate jokes?

Hermione: No.

Ron: Yes.

Harry: My Dad and I talk shit about you.

Peter: Rude.

Ron: Hilarious.

Hermione: I have to study. I love you, Harry! Have fun!

Ron: Good she’s gone

Hermione: You also have to study, Ron.

Peter: Oh good now we’re alone.

Harry: Goodnight.

Peter: Oh good now I’m alone.

 

Day Two:

Hermione changed group chat to Three Idiots and a Genius.

Ron: Harry! Look!

Ron: imageattachment.jpg

Harry: Is that an apple?

Hermione: Honestly.

Hermione: imageattachment.jpg

Peter: You-Know-Who Killed by Muggle

Peter: Is that a real newspaper?

Peter: It’s a touch evasive.

Harry: It’s not. So am I still a crazy liar?

Ron: Nope! It says you were telling the truth all along.

Hermione: I can’t believe he’s really dead.

Hermione: It feels sort of anticlimactic, doesn’t it?

Harry: Suppose that’s because you weren’t tortured by him or kidnapped by the man who killed him.

Harry: You didn’t see him kill someone or have your blood used to bring him back.

Harry: You didn’t get crucio’d by him.

Harry: You didn’t lose a fucking leg.

Harry: But sure, it’s anticlimactic.

Hermione: Harry I’m so sorry.

Hermione: Harry, please, that’s not what I meant.

Hermione: Harry.

 

Ron Weasley to Harry Stark: Mate, she’s crying.

Harry: Good.

Ron: …

Harry: Fuck you.

 

Harry Stark to Three Idiots and a Genius: I know that’s not what you meant Hermione.

Peter: I for one have never been more confused.

Ron: Who even invited you?

Hermione: I did. He’s Harry’s friend too.

Hermione: Harry, I’m so sorry. That was such a careless thing to say.

Harry: It’s fine. Tony told me that if I join a gang it should be the blue gang.

Peter: …lmao

Hermione: Oh, my.

Ron: Why??

Harry: They’re the crips.

Harry: Get it?

Harry: You guys suck.

 

Ron Weasley to Peter Parker: Wanna snog in the library?

Peter: Not really, no.

Ron: Wrong number.

Peter: Who were you texting?

Peter: WHO WERE YOU TEXTING?

 

Ron Weasley to Hermione Granger: Wanna snog in the library?

Hermione: Not really, no.

Ron: :(

Hermione: :)

 

Peter Parker changed chat name to Three Brits & a Spider.

Peter: How’s the UK, everyone?

Harry: Cold.

Ron: Boring.

Hermione Granger left the chat.

Peter: Was it something I said?

Ron: We’re in class.

Harry: What class?

Ron: Hagrid’s.

Harry: I saw Buckingham Palace today.

Peter: I saw Sirius do magic.

Harry: Are you at my house??

Peter: Sirius invited me.

Harry: Brilliant.

Harry: He only likes blokes for a night.

Harry: So don’t get attached.

Ron: Wow. Look at that.

Ron Weasley left the chat.

Peter: I’m not fucking Sirius!

Harry: You could.

Peter: Yeah if I had way more daddy issues than I do.

Peter: And if I wasn’t in love with you.

Harry: You’re not in love with me.

Harry: You’re just an idiot.

Peter: I’m your idiot.

Peter: :)

Harry: You’re not cute.

Peter: My aunt says I am.

Harry: She lied.

Peter: :(

Harry Stark left the chat.

Peter: I’m killing it.

 

Hermione created group chat.

Hermione changed chat name to Friends.

Harry changed chat name to Interrogations.

Ron: HARRY!

Ron: MALFOY!!

Ron: WHAT?!?!

Peter: That wasn’t even a real sentence.

Hermione: Shouldn’t you be asleep?

Peter: I have insomnia.

Peter: Only true love’s kiss can make me sleep.

Ron: Shut it.

Ron: HARRYYYYY!!

Harry: FFS. What?!

Ron: B killed Malfoy’s dad!!

Ron: AND PETTIGREW!

Ron: What’s FFS?

Peter: For fuck sake.

Hermione: Sirius is free!

Harry: I know.

Hermione: And you didn’t tell us?!?!

Ron: MALFOY’S DAD IS DEAD.

Ron: DEAD.

Harry: You know that’s kind of sad for Draco, right?

Harry: Even if he’s scum and deserved it.

Hermione: You’re right. We’re sorry.

Ron: I’m not.

Ron: He called Hermione the m-word.

Peter: ???

Ron: Mermaid. It’s an insult here.

Harry: Only if they tried to spear you.

Hermione: How’s your vacation, Harry?

Harry: Fine.

Harry: I’m just rolling around London.

Peter: Lol

Hermione: You are impossible.

Ron: Malfoy’s dad is dead.

Harry Stark left the group chat.

Hermione: Excellent job, Ronald.

Hermione Granger added Harry Stark to the group chat.

Ron: You’re the boy who lived again, by the way.

Peter: Why??

Ron: Because he’s alive, idiot.

Harry: But the Boy Who Lied had such a ring to it.

Harry: Hermione…

Harry: Do you still have Rita in a jar??

Hermione Granger left the chat.

Peter: What the fuck…?

 

Day Three:

Hermione Granger to Interrogations: Harry, don’t freak out.

Harry: Oh good.

Harry: My nonexistent leg is on fire.

Harry: And it seems like my day is just going to go up from here.

Ron: They’re calling B a hero.

Hermione: Someone at the Daily Prophet has a squib sibling that leaked the ‘Winter Soldier’ bit and now that he’s killed You-Know-Who, he’s… well, they’re saying he’s a hero.

Ron: ‘Soldier Slaughtered You-Know-Who’ was the headline.

Harry Stark left the group chat.

Hermione: Perhaps we shouldn’t have told him.

Ron: You wanna hear him bitch later if we keep stuff from him?

Peter: What did I miss?

 

Peter Parker to Harry Stark: Hey

Peter: I love you.

Harry: Have you ever looked up harassment?

Harry: Because that’s what this is.

Peter: YA Novels make it sound romantic.

Harry: It’s not.

Peter: So we’re over then? Over over?

Peter: ‘It’s not you it’s me’ over?

Peter: ‘We can still be friends’ over?

Harry: I’m actually not much interested in a pity relationship.

Peter: Pity??

Peter: Who is pitying who?

Harry: Stop, okay?

Harry: Stop acting like you want to date someone—

Harry: Look, I don’t blame you, okay? It wasn’t your fault. You don’t have to date me because you feel guilty.

Harry: I gotta go.

 

Peter Parker to Hermione Granger: Hi

Peter: You speak Harry, right?

Hermione: I’m fluent, yes.

Peter: screenshot.jpg

Peter: Care to interpret?

Hermione: For the love of…

Hermione: I’ll be back.

 

Hermione Granger to Harry Stark: I love you.

Harry: Cool.

Hermione: I’ve been in love with you for years.

Harry: …

Harry: What?

Harry: I

Harry: What??

Hermione: Why do you believe that I could be in love with you and not Peter?

Harry: What?

Harry: Hermione, was that a joke?

Hermione: I am not in love with you.

Hermione: You’re quite fanciable

Hermione: It’s the gay for me though.

Harry: Bisexual.

Hermione: Gay, but irrelevant.

Hermione: You’re smart and funny and kind and handsome.

Hermione: Frankly, Peter would be an idiot to not be in love with you.

Harry: Frankly, Peter would be blind to not see that I’m in a wheelchair, Hermione.

Harry: He likes to skateboard, I can’t really do that, can I?

Hermione: I didn’t think you really could in the first place.

Harry: I’d laugh so hard at that but unfortunately my imaginary leg is burning.

Hermione: It’s called phantom pain. I looked it up. It’s unfortunately common  

Harry: It’s called an invisible crucio.

Harry: And it hurts.

Hermione: Did you tell your dad?

Harry: No point.

Harry: I used all the pain potions we had and this is supposed to be a ‘relaxing trip’ and I can’t keep whining.

Harry: I just have to get used to it.

Hermione: For the love of…

 

Hermione Granger to Tony Stark: Hello

Hermione: Diagon Alley

Hermione: Sirius’ house.

Hermione: Ron’s home.

Hermione: Hogsmeade.

Tony: Yeah, this is a list that makes sense to me.

Hermione: They’re places that you can get pain relieving potions at.

Tony: Harry’s been fine.

Tony: Right?

Tony: Son of a…

Tony: How do I get to literally any of those places?

Hermione: Stand by, please.

 

Hermione Granger to Ron Weasley: What’s the address for your house?

Ron: The Burrow.

Hermione: The muggle address.

Ron: Uh

Ron: Let me ask Gin.

Ron: She said it’s the Burrow

Hermione: Charming. I’ll ask Luna.

 

Hermione Granger to Tony Stark: 2 South Farm Road, Ottery St Catchpole, England.

Hermione: Molly Weasley is a hugger and Arthur is fascinated by technology.

Tony: And they have potions?

Hermione: If they don’t, Molly will know how to order them. I’m in class and honestly you boys can’t expect me to do everything.

Tony: You’re like a tiny Pepper

Tony: Thanks

 

Harry Stark created the group chat Fuck Me.

Peter: I’m already interested.

Harry: WHOSE DAFT IDEA WAS IT TO SEND ME TO MOLLY’S?!

Harry: I know it was you, Hermione.

Ron: Mate, did you apparate there??

Harry: Yeah, Ron. I STOOD UP ON MY TWO LEGS AND TURNED ON THE SPOT TO APPARATE.

Ron: Right.

Ron: Wait, mate, did u fly a jet plane to my mum’s house?!

Harry: Yeah. And you know what happened?

Harry: Your dad fainted.

Harry: And your mum cried the whole time.

Harry: I am soaked in tears.

Hermione: Did you get the potions though?

Harry Stark removed Hermione Granger from the chat.

Peter: Why was Ron’s mom crying?

Ron: Probably tears of joy.

Ron: Harry’s her favorite child.

Harry: I am.

Harry: That’s beside the point.

Harry: I saw Bill.

Ron: Think you missed your chance, mate. He’s been talking about a girlfriend lately.

Peter: Wait! Who is Bill?

Ron: My brother.

Ron: Harry fancies him.

Harry: I DO NOT

Ron: You talk in your sleep.

Harry Stark left the group chat.

Peter: Tell me that Bill is old and ugly.

Ron: Nope.

Ron: He’s 23.

Ron: He’s a curse breaker.

Ron: He’s got an earring, ponytail, and leather jacket.

Ron: Everyone fancies Bill.

Peter: Cool. Cool. He’s super straight though, right?

Ron: I think straight and gay are muggle terms.

Ron: Bill’s tall though, if that’s what you’re asking.

Ron: And not straight at all.

Peter: I love to hear that.

 

Harry Stark to Hermione Granger: Thank you.

Hermione: Anytime.

 

Day Four:

Harry Stark created group chat Bullshit.

Hermione changed chat name to Ron Needs to Study.

Ron changed chat name to Snau52bsJ.

Peter: Wtf?

Ron: videoattachment.mov

Ron: “Hi, Harrikins! It’s your favorite twin! I don’t know how to use the keyboard and Ron’s a bit tied up right now! Convince your shiny robot dad to let us and Gin—”

“AND LUNA!”

“And Luna to come over Christmas too! We’ve got new stuff to show you! Everyone misses you! We can play one-legged quidditch if you do!”

Harry: My dad said the more the merrier.

Hermione: Oh how he’ll regret that.

Peter: Who the hell was that?

Harry: Fred.

Hermione: How do you know it isn’t George?

Harry: Fred’s got a freckle under his eye that George doesn’t have.

Harry: Anyone want to hear how I drowned this morning?

Peter: Yes.

Hermione: Yes.

Ron: YDBWK

Harry: I’m taking that as a yes.

Harry: The hotel we’re at has a pool.

Harry: And it’s indoor and heated and we thought we’d give it a go.

Harry: You don’t need two legs to swim, right?

Harry: Wrong.

Harry: Who needs Voldemort when there’s a pool to do me in?

Hermione: Oh, Harry, that sounds horrible.

Peter: What’s Voldemort?

Ron: UR MYM

Harry: I think Fred meant ‘your mum’.

Harry: That’s only funny if Peter’s mum isn’t dead.

Harry: But she is, soo…

Ron: SRY

Peter: It’s cool.

Hermione: It really isn’t.

Hermione: Are you okay though, Harry?

Harry: My pride?

Harry: Gone.

Harry: My ego?

Harry: Gone.

Harry: My lungs?

Harry: Burning.

Peter: Your leg?

Peter: Gone.

Hermione: PETER PARKER!

Harry: Lol

Harry: Gotta go.

Harry: We’re going shopping.

Harry: Think I’ll get half-off on jeans?

Peter: Nah.

Peter: Shoes though? Maybe.

Hermione: I’m surrounded by idiots.

Ron: HI HARRY

 

Peter Parker to Harry Stark: Your stepmom invited me to Thanksgiving dinner.

Harry: I don’t have a stepmom.

Peter: Pepper.

Harry: Name doesn’t ring a bell.

Peter: So you don’t want me to come?

Harry: …

Harry: Why are you doing this?

Harry: Be honest please.

Peter: Okay

Peter: I’m so fucking in love with you that I can’t sleep.

Peter: I was a selfish dick when my uncle died.

Harry: That’s not—

Peter: I was. All I knew was that I was in pain and I wanted everyone else to hurt as much as I did.

Peter: But I didn’t mean you.

Peter: And by the time I realized I didn’t want you to hate me, it was too late.

Peter: All I want now is a second chance.

Harry: I threw a beanbag at your head.

Peter: I threw one at yours.

Harry: I have one leg.

Peter: I’ve got spider dna.

Harry: My therapist charges double rates because I’m so fucked up.

Peter: Yeah and I’m the image of good mental health, really.

Harry: If you want to come to dinner, I don’t care.

Peter: Can I come early? So we can talk?

Harry: …

Harry: Sure.

Peter: Should I bring anything?

Harry: Mate I don’t even know what Thanksgiving is.

Harry: So no.

Peter: God you’re so British.

Peter: It’s hot.

Harry: I’m shopping. Bye.

 

Ron Weasley to Snau52bsJ: HARRYYYY, why did you tell Fred that they can come to your place?

Ron: It’s not Christmas BREAK with them there!

Harry: They asked and I said yeah.

Hermione: You’ll need extra players for your annual quidditch match anyway.

Harry: Hysterical.

Hermione: You can fly even if you can’t walk.

Harry: I’m ‘summer after first year’ levels of strong.

Harry: Dennis Creevey could kick my arse.

Peter: He could try.

Hermione: You just need physical therapy and regular meals to get your strength back.

Harry: What do I need to get my leg back?

Ron: A time turner.

Peter: What’s that?

Ron: A turner for time.

Peter: Have I mentioned recently that I hate you?

Ron: Have I mentioned recently that Harry’s my best mate?

Harry: I have no best mate.

Harry: I have antidepressants and people staring at me on sidewalks.

Harry: This is my life now.

Ron: To be fair, people have always stared at you.

Hermione: And you’ve always needed antidepressants.

Harry: Or a really tall building to jump off—

Harry: Holy shit.

Harry: I can’t even jump off a roof.

Harry: I could fling myself from a roof?

Harry: Except rooftops aren’t even wheelchair accessible.

Harry: Someone should fix that.

 

Missed call from Hermione Granger

Missed call from Ron Weasley

Missed call from Peter Parker

 

Harry: Just so you lot know, my dad thought it was funny.

Hermione: Well he was wrong.

Harry Stark added Tony Stark to group chat.

Harry: You were saying?

Hermione Granger removed Tony Stark from group chat.

Tony Stark added Tony Stark to group chat.

Hermione: How did he do that?!

Tony: Easily.

Tony: What’s up?

Harry: Hermione says you’re wrong and I’m not funny.

Tony: That’s because she goes to a medieval school.

Tony: Talk to me when you get your PhD.

Hermione: I will, thanks.

Ron: Now you’ve done it.

Harry Stark removed Tony Stark from group chat.

Peter: Iconic.

Harry: I know.

Harry: I got a letter from the President of MACUSA and Minister Fudge this morning.

Ron: Hermione is screeching.

Ron: Let me try and interpret…

Ron: ‘Why would he tell us he drowned and not about this?!’

Harry: The drowning seemed more interesting.

Peter: What’s MACUSA?

Ron: An acronym.

Harry: Lol

Harry: President Quahog wants to meet after thanksgiving about the whole enhanced human thing.

Harry: Minister Fudge wants a chance to apologize he says.

Harry: So probably an interview.

Hermione: Or a chance to kiss your arse now that everyone knows you aren’t a liar.

Ron: Can’t talk.

Ron: Hermione just swore.

Ron: Someone write it down.

Peter: Noted.

Hermione: Are you going to meet with Fudge before you go home tomorrow?

Harry: And give some reporter a chance to get a photo?

Harry: Yeah. I’m dying to do that.

Harry: It’s right up there with snogging Umbridge.

Peter: Who’s Umbridge?

Hermione: The foul woman who cut Harry’s hand.

Harry Stark left the group chat.

Ron: Saw that coming.

Peter: Someone cut Harry’s hand??

Peter: Is that the scar calling him a liar he mentioned?

Hermione: Oh. Did he tell you that?

Peter: Screamed it in my face.

Hermione: He does trust you!

Hermione: I knew it.

Hermione: And yes. She’s a foul woman.

Ron: Azkaban is truly worse for having her.

Hermione: I’m quite surprised that they didn’t send B to Azkaban.

Ron: Dad said there’s no wizarding law against muggle guns.

Ron: And now that he’s almost as famous as Harry…

Peter: Harry’s famous?

Ron: His dad is, yeah. Haven’t you heard of Tony Stark?

Peter: I’ll just ask Sirius, thanks.

Ron Weasley removed Peter Parker from the group.

Ron: Wanna go snog in the library?

Hermione: No.

Ron: Behind the greenhouse?

Hermione: No.

Ron: Slytherins Chamber?

Hermione: If you can get in that chamber, then sure, I’ll snog you.

 

Ron Weasley to Harry Stark: I need a favor and it’s an emergency.

Harry: What?

Ron: Can you send me a video thing of you talking in Parsletongue? Just say ‘open’ over and over?

Harry: This is an emergency?

Ron: Yes.

Harry: Sure.

Harry: videoattachment.mov

Ron: I love you.

Harry: People say that a lot lately.

Harry: I think it went up after they cut off my leg.

 

Ron Weasley to Hermione Granger: Meet me at the second floor girls bathroom.

Hermione: Why?

Ron: You’ll see.

 

Hermione Granger created group chat Help.

Hermione: Harry…

Harry: Why?

Ron: No reason.

Peter: What’s going on?

Harry: No idea but I bet it’s hilarious.

Harry: Oh. Wait.

Harry: Ron! Is the basilisk still down there?

Ron: Yeah. Still looks alive too.

Ron: Scared the hell out of me.

Harry Stark added Tony Stark to group chat.

Harry Stark added Sirius Black to group chat.

Harry Stark added Pepper Potts to group chat.

Harry: Ron, send a picture.

Ron: image.jpg

Pepper: WHAT IS THAT?

Sirius: Where the hell did you find a basilisk?!

Tony: Are all of Harry’s friends idiots?

Hermione: No.

Harry: That’s the basilisk I killed.

Harry: Back when I had 2 legs.

Harry: I probably would have lost if I had to do it in a wheelchair.

Harry Stark removed Sirius Black from group chat.

Harry Stark removed Pepper Potts from group chat.

Harry Stark removed Tony Stark from group chat.

Harry: What are you guys doing down there anyway?

Harry: Research?

Hermione: Yes.

Ron: No.

Hermione: How do we get out??

Harry: No idea.

Harry: Have fun dying down there.

Peter: I’ll remember you fondly.

Hermione: HARRY!

Harry: You could see if Dobby listens to your call.

Ron: Brilliant!

 

Ron: He doesn’t.

Harry: Hold on.

Harry: He does mine.

 

Harry: He’s crying but he said if you call for him he can get you.

Hermione: Harry, Dobby is not your slave.

Hermione: You can’t just order him around.

Harry: Fine. Die in the chamber.

Peter: I’m so confused.

Peter: RIP though.

Ron: We’re free.

Ron: Had to listen to Dobby calling you the greatest warrior known to man though.

Ron: I reckon he’ll be popping the question any time.

Peter: Wait. Who’s Dobby?

Harry: Lol listen

Harry: I can never propose to anyone.

Harry: I can’t get down on one knee.

Harry: Because I only have one knee.

Hermione Granger left the group chat.

Ron: She’s crying again.

Harry: What were you doing down there?

Ron: She said she’d snog me if I could open the chamber.

Harry: Beautiful.

Peter: Is it hard to open?

Harry: Impossible if you don’t talk to snakes.

Peter: People can talk to snakes?

Ron: Just Harry.

Ron: G’night, gents. I’m going to go assure Hermione that of course Harry isn’t destined to be alone just because he can’t propose.

Ron Weasley left the group chat.

Peter: …

Peter: I’m going to go clear my head.

Harry: Wow I’m so good at having friends.

 

Harry Stark to Sirius Black: What are you doing?

Sirius: Playing cards.

Sirius: What’s up?

Harry: I can’t sleep.

Sirius: Take a dreamless sleep, kiddo.

Harry: I can’t. Molly told Tony that they’re addictive. Now I can only take two a week.

Sirius: Bullshit.

Sirius: I take them almost every day.

Harry: I miss you.

Sirius: How bad is it?

Harry: It’s so bad, Pads.

Harry: It’s the worst it’s ever been.

Sirius: Can I call you?

Harry: No. Tony’s asleep.

Harry: I just…

Harry: What’s the point?

Harry: Everything just goes from bad to worse and the only thing everything has in common is me.

Harry: I’m so sick of it.

Sirius: I know.

Sirius: But good things are coming for you, Harry.

Sirius: I swear.

Harry: How long do I have to wait, Siri?

Harry: Because I don’t know if I can wait that long.

Sirius: I thought that for almost twelve years straight. Find one reason to keep going, just one.

Sirius: You were my reason and now I’m so glad I stuck around.

Harry: Siri…

Harry: Pepper told Tony that the ‘renovation’ is done. That means Tony probably spent a fortune doing something because I’m stuck in a chair.

Harry: Strangers stare at me and kids ask where my leg is.

Sirius: Merlin I hate kids.

Harry: I’m a freak, Siri. An actual circus show now.

Sirius: You’ve never been to a circus.

Harry: Sirius.

Sirius: You’re not a freak. You could get a fake leg if you wanted or you could learn to hop around on one leg.

Sirius: Everything will get better.

Harry: When?

Sirius: I wish I had an exact date for you.

Harry: Will you stay awake so I have someone to talk to?

Sirius: Of course.

Harry: Nobody knows how to cook.

Hermione: What do you eat every day??

Harry: Cereal and takeout.

Hermione: That’s not healthy at all.

Harry: What’s going to happen?

Harry: I’ll lose my leg?

Hermione: You’re so morbid!

Peter: God damn it, lmao

Ron: What’s stand up?

Harry: That thing I can’t do.

Ron: Hermione’s crying again.

Peter: She cries a lot.

Harry: She doesn’t get my sense of humor.

Ron: She’s sad, mate. She’s worried about you and she can’t sleep and it’s making her stressed.

Ron: She’s worried you’ll… you know.

Harry: Jump off a roof?

Harry: I could hop off one.

Ron: Mate, don’t joke.

 

Ron Weasley to Harry Stark: Are you doing okay?

Harry: Honestly? No.

Harry: Everything hurts, every day. I can’t sleep. Food tastes like cardboard. It just feels pointless, you know?

Ron: No, I don’t. But I believe you.

Ron: And I believe in you.

Ron: You’re the best person I know.

Ron: I wish you were here.

Ron: We both do.

Harry: I wish you wouldn’t.

Harry: I’ll be fine.

Harry: I always am.

 

Harry Stark to Sirius Black: We’re flying home now.

Harry: Will you be there?

Sirius: Yep.

Harry: Okay.

Sirius: Bad day?

Harry: Bad life.

Chapter Text

Thursday, November 23

Harry looked around the flat and felt… felt…

Overwhelmed.

Tony had the entire place redone while they were gone and Harry was so ungrateful because all he could think was how much he hated it.

The flat was still completely open, with the walkway from the lifts to the rest of the place lined up with doors that led to Tony’s bedroom, office, and lab. Harry’s bedroom door was still on the far side of the sitting room. The back wall of the house was still made up of glass. It was still painted a fresh and clean shade of white.

But everything else was different.

The tall bar table that they used as a dining table that separated the kitchen from the sitting room had been replaced with a longer and more permanent looking fixture. It curved around, truly separating the kitchen from the rest of the house, and instead of being the same height, it was… it was the perfect height where Harry could just roll up to it and be comfortable.

The rest of the kitchen had been redone as well, with sinks low enough that Harry could reach and even a new refrigerator. Harry saw a microwave down low and counters built in low.

Harry was pretty sure the telly had been upgraded, it looked bigger, and the drawers that used to be built up in the wall, the ones with the game equipment, had all been lowered.

It looked posh still, ‘modern’ and ‘techy’ (Tony’s words), and Harry… Harry hated it.

“What do you think?” Tony asked brightly, gesturing around their place. “Wait! Look!”

Harry sat, dumbstruck, when Tony ran around the new bar/table setup and threw open a ceiling to floor cabinet beside the refrigerator.

“Check it out, cereal!” Tony declared dramatically, waving at where Harry could see an entire shelf filled with cereal right at… at Harry height.

Harry looked up at Tony’s smile and felt something cracking in his chest.

“I’m so sorry,” Harry said hoarsely. He looked around the entire place that had been Tony’s home before Harry showed up and ruined Tony’s life- Tony’s home.

“I- I’m sorry,” Harry said again. Apologies didn’t mean anything, Harry knew that, but he couldn’t just not apologize. Not when Harry wrecked Tony’s life and then wrecked his home.

Harry didn’t think Tony would ever hit him, even when Harry had given him a thousand reasons to do it, but Harry would have felt better if he did.

“Sorry? For what?” Tony asked, pretending to be stupid, apparently. He walked casually around the new bar setup, stopping to turn on the additional sink that was at ‘Harry height’. “Anything you need in the kitchen, it’s all here! Look!”

Harry sat silently while Tony went through the entire flat, showing off a million changes, and Harry’s guilt just grew and grew.

“And this drawer…” Tony opened a drawer built in the wall, just beside Harry’s door. “Tada! I had them install shelves to store potions. Just put your thumb on this scanner, the drawer pops open, and you can access all your medicine in one place!”

Harry nodded, since it seemed like Tony didn’t want to hear more apologies.

“Well, home sweet home!” Tony said cheerily. “Of course, we’re going to move the furniture around to set up a table here for dinner tonight, but—”

Harry had never been so relieved to hear the lifts ding as he had been in that moment.

Sirius bound off the lift, dressed in his pajamas still, and stopped to look around at the changes.

“What are you going to do when Harry’s walking again?” Sirius asked bluntly. “Bit of an overreaction, innit?”

“He doesn’t want a prosthetic and he’s got body autonomy here,” Tony said airily. “Plus, he’s still growing, so who knows…”

Harry developed a new super power when they took his leg. It wasn’t an Iron Suit or super speed, it was the very unique ability to make all the noise around him absolutely meaningless.

Tony and Sirius could stand there discussing Harry all they wanted with their hands flying around and their mouths moving and Harry didn’t hear a single word they said.

Instead, Harry just looked around and wondered how much money Tony spent because Harry couldn’t bear the thought of having some fake leg - like Moody, like Pettigrew, like Bucky - attached to his body.

Thousands? A hundred thousand? Two hundred thousand?

Could all the galleons in Harry’s vault repay him?

Would Tony let him repay him?

Tony had done everything for Harry. Tony was… Tony was everything.

And Harry sat in his chair in that flat and felt like nothing.

“Where you going?” Sirius asked, his voice breaking through Harry’s fuzzy bubble that kept him separate from the conversation happening above his head.

“Shower,” Harry said shortly. He pushed his chair to his room and paused when he saw that even his doorknob had been moved. Tony… Tony had his doorknob lowered so Harry barely had to stretch to reach it.

“Dinner’s at five!” Tony called to Harry’s back.

Harry nodded and wasn’t even surprised when Sirius followed Harry in his room and flopped down on Harry’s bed.

“On a scale of Dursleys the summer you were twelve to potions class after your name came out of the goblet, how much do you hate it here right now?”

Harry paused, caught off guard by the way his closet had been redone- all his shirts, jackets, jumpers, and hoodies were lowered. And hung up, which Harry didn’t usually do.

When Harry turned around, he noticed that his two dressers that were filled with jeans, trousers, socks, pajamas, and pants were swapped for a short and wide dresser in a marble topped material that matched Harry’s nightstand.

Hundreds of thousands of dollars, Harry realized with stinging eyes. Tony spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Harry because he wouldn’t just get a stupid fake leg.

“Siri, I fucked up,” Harry whispered, his eyes caught on that new dresser. “I fucked up so bad.”

Sirius sat up on Harry’s bed and scooted to the end of it, his face suddenly more solemn despite the tangled black hair and ratty Queen shirt he wore.

“What’d you do?” Sirius asked. “People have been confessing their murders to me lately, so as long as there’s no decapitated heads in your closet…”

Harry furrowed his brows for a moment, bemused by that remark, and then shook his head to clear that question away.

“I- Tony wanted me to get a fake leg and I said no, Siri. I said no.” Harry looked at Sirius desperately, willing him to understand Harry’s guilt. “I’ve ruined everything. I got my leg cut off and I wouldn’t let Tony replace it and now- now he changed his whole house because I’m an idiot.”

“Oh, yeah, you shouldn’t have gotten in that car with Barnes,” Sirius nodded. “Honestly, Harry, that was about as daft as entering the tournament.”

“Don’t joke,” Harry snapped. He didn’t have the patience to play with Sirius, he needed real advice.

“No, really,” Sirius shrugged. “This is inviting the dementors on the train all over again. You never learn, do you, kiddo?”

“Siri—”

“Merlin, Harry, while we’re on the subject, why did you let Ginny open the chamber? She was only a kid.”

“That’s not—”

“And then you thought it would be fun to play quidditch with dementors.”

“Please—”

“Really, Harry, you just never think.”

“SHUT UP!” Harry yelled, pissed by Sirius’ glib bullshit. “YOU THINK YOU’RE BEING FUNNY AND IT’S NOT FUNNY!”

None of it was funny. Harry couldn’t find a single funny thing in that moment.

Harry was the heaviest bloody burden in the world and Tony didn’t deserve it.

Sirius deserved it, Sirius was a prat, but Tony… Tony was the type of person who didn’t bat and eye before remodeling his entire house just for Harry to get cereal and medicine a little easier.

“Harry…” Sirius leaned forward with his elbows on his knees and his hands wrapped around his neck. Sirius wasn’t joking anymore, he was being… serious.

“Tony doesn’t care to change the place up, he doesn’t care if you get a fake leg or not. He just wants you to be happy in your home,” Sirius said imploringly with his big grey eyes so pathetically like Padfoot.

Harry loved Sirius, but occasionally he preferred Padfoot.

“It was his home first,” Harry told Sirius. “He changed it all because of me; I stole his life and his home.”

“He gave you his home,” Sirius insisted. “It’s your home too, Harry. It’s your life and your home and I think it’s nice that he made it easier for you.”

It was nice.

It was nice that Tony had all of Harry’s clothes moved where he could reach them and potions and medicine put in a drawer he could reach.

It was so nice and…

“Nobody’s ever just nice,” Harry said, his voice breaking at the end. He silently begged Sirius to understand that Harry didn’t understand. “Siri… you’re- you’re the only one who ever does nice things and it evens out because you’re a dick.”

Sirius smirked, unflappable bastard. “You know what your problem is?”

Harry raised a brow; he would love to know what Sirius thought his problem was.

Sirius got up and put his hand on Harry’s should, grinning down at him.

“You spent a whole life getting beat up on, hated on, and told that you were unlovable and a burden to be bore.” Sirius held his hand up when Harry tried to interrupt, grimacing slightly when Harry twitched at the abrupt motion. “Kiddo, I get it. When your grandmum, James’ mum, went and bought me a bed and furniture so I could live with them, I bawled like a baby.”

Harry wasn’t bawling, yet, which made him feel a little better about himself.

“You know what the shiny little therapist that Clint recommended to me said?”

Harry looked up, surprised. He didn’t know Sirius was seeing a therapist, though God knew he needed one.

“What?” Harry asked when Sirius seemed to be waiting for a response.

“Child abuse is some of the hardest abuse to overcome because it’s all done in our formative years and tends to stick around in our brains the longest,” Sirius said, sounding like Hermione just then. “Just because some bloody whale said you weren’t worth changing the size of some cabinets for, it doesn’t mean it’s true.”

Harry’s jaw dropped when Sirius squeezed Harry’s shoulder, ruffled his hair, then just walked out.

Aside from the fact that Harry wasn’t abused, that was the most adult that Sirius had ever sounded in his life.

As with all changes in Harry’s life, he hated it.

 

Harry looked down at himself when he was sitting on the little bench in the ridiculously posh tub in his bathroom. With the clear water and no clothes in the way, Harry could see his… his legs.

His right leg was stretched out, a little distorted looking from the water. It was a bit thinner than normal, Harry hadn’t walked on it since- since his pointless break to the gas station. It took a great deal of willpower to force himself to move his gaze to the left and look at the other… leg.

Even Harry’s left thigh was thinner than Harry’s right. It went down to right above where his right leg had a knee and then it just… it just ended. Harry could lean back and look at it from a distance and trick himself into thinking that there was a knee bent and a leg beneath the stump that was left.

But there wasn’t.

Voldemort was dead.

Harry was in a wheelchair.

Tony spent a fortune to remodel his house just because Harry said he didn’t want a fake leg.

 

Harry laid his head back on the little cushion spot and closed his eyes.

When did everything get so overwhelming?

 

Getting dressed used to be so easy that Harry could do it with his eyes closed and half-asleep.

Now, Harry had to force his left thigh in his trousers and then he had to do an awkward jump and shimmy sort of move to get his trousers pulled up. Putting a belt on was awkward. Buttoning his trousers was awkward. Putting shoes on was awkward.

Harry was awkward.

Harry slid his closet shut after he got dressed and looked himself over in the mirror covered door.

From the waist up, Harry looked decent enough. Pepper had texted him and told him to wear his dark green dress shirt and it used to fit Harry snuggly. It used to make Harry look toned and it showed off all the few wiry muscles he had from quidditch. It set off Harry’s eyes nicely and it was a good contrast to his dark hair and fair skin.

It was the waist down that was painful to look at. The same black trousers that used to make Harry look taller suddenly looked… flat. The left side of the trousers were slack and nothing could make Harry look tall in a wheelchair.

Impulsively, Harry reached out for one of the bars mounted to the walls all over the flat and pulled himself up to stand on one very shaky leg.

Nope.

Even standing, Harry didn’t look tall anymore.

Harry’s thoughts on how he looked were thankfully interrupted by a ding from his phone.

Do you want to come outside or I can come up?

Harry rolled his shoulders and grimaced as he used his fingers to comb down his hair.

“Hey, girl,” Harry whistled at Hedwig, waking the cranky owl up. “You wanna go outside with me?”

Hedwig stretched her wings and hooted softly while Joey heard his favorite word and began barking his head off.

Meet me out back?

Harry checked his appearance one more time, wishing he wasn’t about to go talk with Peter.

Why Pepper invited him to Thanksgiving, Harry had no idea.

 

Harry rolled himself outside, mildly pleased that he was able to do it himself, and then stopped right outside the back door.

Peter was sitting on the bench in the back garden area with his head tilted backward and his neck gracefully curved. He was dressed up as well, in the same suit he wore to Harry’s birthday, and he had his backpack on the bench beside him.

With the sun peeking through the clouds, a little ray touching Peter’s relaxed face, he looked beautiful.

Beautiful was an odd word to use to describe a bloke, but it was true all the same.

“I can hear your heart beat,” Peter murmured with his eyes closed and a small grin on his lips. Peter’s quiet words broke the moment and Hedwig flew off Harry’s shoulder and Joey took off to run around the yard.

“That’s creepy,” Harry said, not moving any further in the yard. Harry wiped his sweaty palms off on his trousers. “How was lunch with your family?”

“Sad,” Peter said bluntly. He lifted his head up and Harry thought the edges of his eyes looked a bit red.

Not that Harry was judging, he seemed to cry at the drop of a quill recently.

“It was at my Aunt Kim’s house, she’s my dad and Uncle Ben’s younger sister,” Peter explained. “Everyone was crying and then pretending to be happy anyway.”

“Oh.” Harry grimaced in genuine sympathy. “Well nobody here has died recently, so… so probably nobody will cry.”

Peter smiled when Joey chose that moment to run to him and jump up on him, getting muddy paws on Peter’s nice clothes.

“Hey, buddy.” Peter scratched Joey’s ears, making him smack his tail on the ground. “You miss me, huh? You miss me?”

Harry pushed himself out in the yard and then scowled at the mud that seemed to be a wheelchair’s worst enemy.

“Want some help?” Peter offered.

“No,” Harry said stubbornly. He kept pushing, willing the bloody chair to move, and then smirked victoriously when he made it in front of the bench.

“So… so can we talk?” Peter asked, sounding nervous.

Harry shrugged. “I thought that’s what we were doing.”

Peter grinned and lightly pushed Joey away, focusing on Harry. “I’m sorry I tricked you.”

“I’m sorry I got you stabbed,” Harry said genuinely.

“I’m sorry I led you to an ambush.”

“I’m sorry I threw a beanbag at your head.”

Even if he deserved it, Harry silently amended himself.

“I’m sorry I screamed at you.”

Harry hesitated, fairly certain he’d apologized for the only things he’d done wrong. “I’m not sorry for not telling you about magic before because it’s illegal,” he explained, wanting to clear up everything that lingered between them. “Or, it was, before Sirius announced it on the bloody news.”

And now Harry, Tony, and Sirius were all ‘formally invited’ to go speak with the President of MACUSA about ‘amending the American Statute of Secrecy’.

America was insane.

“Sirius told me,” Peter said with a frown of his own. “He’s kind of been filling in the blanks for me on what the hell you and your friends talk about.”

Harry grinned faintly at that; Ron had been having a laugh at Peter’s expense. Which had caused Harry to laugh.

He’d screenshot and saved ‘What’s MACUSA?’ ‘An acronym.’ for anytime he needed a quick pick-me-up.

“Sirius is a bit behind on most things because he was in prison for twelve years, so don’t take him too seriously,” Harry warned Peter.

Peter grinned and there was a little hopeful light in his eyes to match the gold flecks. “If I have questions, can I ask you?”

“Can I ask you about your spider senses?” Harry asked, a bit coolly. He knew Peter apologized, but it was still embarrassing that Harry had hung out with Spider-Bloke for weeks and weeks and didn’t realize it was Peter.

“I think all the cats are out of the bags,” Peter said with a shrug. “You… you know about me, I know about you…”

That was what he’d said the last time they talked in person.

 

“We don’t have to have any more secrets! You know about me, I know about you!”

“Brilliant.”

“I just want to talk, to see if we can fix this!”

“There is nothing to fix!”

“Well I’m so freaking in love with you that it hurts, so how do I fix that??”

 

And then Harry had started screaming because if Peter loved him, which Harry really doubted, he could do better.

“You don’t have to do this,” Harry said, thinking of their last conversation. “I- I’m fine, really. I’ve got my dad and Sirius…”

It was a miracle Tony didn’t just drop Harry off at an orphanage, really.

Peter laughed mirthlessly and looked up at the sky in what seemed to be blatant exasperation.

“I’m going to do something really stupid,” he said.

Harry didn’t even get a chance to make a biting retort to that before Peter was on his feet, one hand on the arm rest, one hand cupping Harry’s face, and his mouth on Harry’s.

It took Harry a moment to work through his initial surprise, but then his brain caught up to his mouth. Harry reached out, grabbing Peter by the front of his shirt, and pulled him closer while he tilted his head to the side, offering a better angle to deepen the kiss.

Peter groaned in the back of his throat when Harry slipped his hands between the buttons of his shirt and felt bare skin. Harry made his own sound when Peter slowly, slow enough that Harry could stop him if he wanted, slid his tongue across the bottom of Harry’s lip and then bit it lightly.

Even if it was a pity kiss, it was still a good one.

Peter eventually pulled away and his heart was racing beneath Harry’s hand.

“I don’t feel bad for you,” Peter said. He kissed Harry again, a quick and chaste one. “This isn’t pity. You’re- you’re a freaking badass, Harry, and if anyone’s lowering their standards here, it’s you.”

“You are a domestic terrorist,” Harry tried to drawl carelessly, the effect was somewhat lessened by his shortness of breath from the enthusiastic snogging. “And you’re half spider, which is gross.”

Peter straightened up then and laughed, loudly and genuinely, before smiling down at Harry. “Man, you know how to make a guy feel special, Bright Eyes. Do you call everyone you kiss gross afterward?”

“Yes,” Harry lied seriously. He bit his lip then, looking off to the tree where Hedwig was perched in the branches, and figured if they were being honest then he should be completely honest.

“I’m fucked up,” Harry said without looking at Peter. “When I told you I jumped off a roof, I meant it. And- and a lot of nights I still wish I’d hit the ground.”

And sometimes Harry figured that was how he’d go out, since apparently Voldemort wasn’t around to do him in anymore.

Maybe it would be a hop, maybe it would be half a dozen dreamless sleeps at once, but Harry’s therapist said that Harry was his own worst enemy once and Harry believed him.

Especially since Bucky killed Voldemort.

Peter sat back down on the bench and Harry did some fumbling maneuvers to turn his chair and back up so it was as if they were sitting together.

“The summer I was fourteen, I spent three months in the hospital,” Peter said, catching Harry’s interest immediately. Peter was the one avoiding Harry’s gaze then, his eyes were locked on Joey, moving as Joey moved.

“I took a bottle of Tylenol and my Uncle Ben found me in the bathroom with the empty bottle,” Peter went on flatly. “He called an ambulance, I went to the ER, and after they pumped my stomach and filled me with a bunch of medicine to fix my liver, they sent me to the juvenile psych floor.”

“Why?” Harry breathed, caught up in Peter’s story. “Why did you…?”

Why did he do it?

What would have happened if he’d succeeded?

Harry’s insides turned cold and he crossed his arms over his chest, fighting off the chill that overtook him.

“Everyone’s got shit,” Peter said, his voice still flat. He shrugged and then looked toward Harry, locking eyes. “So if you’re fucked up for jumping off a roof then I’m fucked up too.”

“You should see a therapist,” Harry said with a tiny smirk. “Apparently everyone’s doing it now.”

“Yeah? Maybe I should,” Peter said with his own smirk. “Except I think the whole spider DNA thing might freak them out.”

“I talked about a basilisk to mine,” Harry shrugged. “Michael Morris, he’s a nice bloke.”

Harry checked the time and sighed to see that they needed to go inside.

“Pepper said dinner was at five,” Harry told Peter. “Er… are you- do you still want to go inside?”

Personally, Harry would rather skip the event. He’d probably beg off, except then Pepper would be upset and Harry hated upsetting Pepper.

“Will you tell me about the giant snake on the way up?” Peter asked. He got up and swung his bag around on his back. Harry didn’t argue when he grabbed the handles of Harry’s chair, Harry’s arms were tired from trying to fight through the mud anyway.

“It’s not really that exciting,” Harry hedged. He whistled for Joey and Hedwig on their way back inside and then launched in the story. It sounded ridiculous, trying to explain about a cursed diary and a basilisk filtering through plumbing in the walls, but Peter was a decent listener.

By the time they arrived at the top floor, Harry had been trying to describe the magic in Phoenix tears.

And then they both stopped dead in the entrance of Harry and Tony’s flat because—

Harry had only been outside for an hour?!

—the place was packed with people.

“Hey, kiddo!” Sirius bound over to Harry and grinned down at him. He was dressed nicely, in black trousers and a light grey dress shirt, and he had his hair pulled back in a neat ponytail.

“Peter, good to see you,” Sirius winked at Peter which made Harry scowl. “I’ve always wanted to celebrate Thanksgiving, you know.”

“It’s Sirius’ most recent dream,” Harry drawled, glancing uneasily around at the familiar people filling the flat.

Pepper and Happy were loading the kitchen bar with more food than even feasts at Hogwarts had. Tony was leaning against the kitchen counter, a glass of what Harry thought might be wine in one hand and his other hand waving around wildly, as he told Rhodey some story that Bruce was listening to as well. Pietro and Psycho were setting the obscenely large table with plates, silverware, cups, and candles.

The telly was on in the sitting room behind the table, and some sport game was playing on the screen that Clint was sitting on the edge of Tony’s recliner yelling at.

Harry knew he should have grabbed his cloak.

Ding!

Harry jolted in his seat at the sound of the lift opening behind him. He turned his head and saw Professor Strange stepping off the lift in normal clothes with a bottle of wine in each hand.

“Oh, good, someone invited the ‘sorcerer’,” Sirius muttered, shooting Strange a dark look that Harry didn’t think he quite deserved.

If Tony wasn’t lying, and Harry didn’t think he’d lied to him yet, then Strange was the one who found Harry and kept him from dying.

“Hello,” Strange said politely, stepping up to where the three of them had been lingering. He held up the bottles of wine. “Where should I put these?”

“Oh, Stephen!” Pepper’s voice caught everyone’s attention and Harry glared down at his lap when he was an inadvertent subject of their sudden scrutiny. “You can give the wine to Tony, but you didn’t need to bring anything!”

“I never arrive empty handed,” Strange said smoothly. He juggled one bottle to tuck it in his other arm so he could pat Harry’s shoulder briefly before walking toward the kitchen.

“Harry, come test the desserts,” Rhodey called. He was dressed up in a suit and had his usual easy smile on his face. “I brought brownies.”

“Adult brownies?” Psycho asked, looking up from where she’d been lighting posh looking candles on the table.

“Would I be offering them to a fifteen year old if so?” Rhodey scoffed.

“Tony was doing a hell of a lot more than pot at Harry’s age,” Happy quipped, drawing a few laughs.

Harry started pushing himself toward the kitchen, refusing to look like an easy target to the rooms filled with assassins and heroes, and was absently relieved that Peter fell in step beside him.

“Hey, kid.” Tony put his wineglass down and waved Bruce off when Harry made it to the kitchen. “I’d offer you wine, but your future stepmom might kill me.”

“Or the interaction of medication and alcohol would kill Harry,” Pepper said without even looking away from where she was fluffing some odd looking platter. “No booze, Tony.”

“The fun police strike again,” Tony said sadly.

“The responsible parent strikes again, you mean,” Rhodey chuckled. He grabbed a silver pan off the counter and offered it to Harry before offering it to Peter as well. “It’s my grandma’s recipe,” he explained when Harry was inspecting the square chocolate brownie. “Your dad goes crazy for them.”

Harry took a small bite while Peter ate half of his in a go.

“It’s good,” Harry said truthfully.

“It’s freaking amazing,” Peter said. He reached for another one and stuck his lower lip out when Rhodey moved the pan away from him. “I thought we were friends.”

“You thought wrong,” Rhodey said jokingly. “I hate spiders.”

“Who doesn’t?” Tony asked as he quickly snatched three brownies from the pan Rhodey held.

“Harry doesn’t,” Peter said smugly.

“Harry’s clearly got bad taste,” Strange said as he joined the conversation. He offered Harry his hand now that it was empty. “How are you? Incision healing up? No phantom pains? Temperature normal ranges?”

“I’m a little off-balanced when I run,” Harry said flatly, embarrassed by the focus on him and his leg again. Peter and Tony were the only two who laughed, but Strange had an amused glimmer in his eyes as he shook Harry’s hand.

“Yeah, that’ll wear off eventually,” Strange said with a brief wink. “We’re back on schedule for our session on Monday, right?”

“We’ll see,” Tony interrupted quickly. “Hey, let’s sit down and eat, everyone!”

“Not yet,” Clint called, his gaze still locked on the telly. “Come on… come on… SON OF A BITCH!”

Harry jolted in his chair and Pepper swiftly threw a roll at the back of Clint’s head while Tony turned the telly off with a press of a button on his phone.

“It’s dinner time,” Pepper told Clint firmly. “Eat.”

“I can do it myself,” Harry snapped, probably more defensively than needed when Tony started to push him toward the table.

“Better yet, I’ve got it,” Rhodey said, easily snagging the handles of the wheelchair from Tony. “Jesus, kid, why are you using a chair from the Stone Age? Is your dad too cheap to get one of those fancy electric ones?”

“I don’t need a fancy electric one,” Harry said. He put his hands on his lap and gave Peter a pointed look when Rhodey pushed Harry at the far end of the table where a chair was conspicuously missing. Peter got the hint and took a seat on Harry’s right while Rhodey seemed content to take the left.

Sirius was up at the counter and called to Harry, “Harry, you like turkey?”

Harry opened his mouth to answer and Pepper did it for him, “Just get him some of everything.”

“Everyone! Food! Eat!” Tony called again. “If you have two legs, you have to make your own plate.”

“TONY!”

Harry snorted at Pepper’s affronted tone. “What?” he asked when she whipped her head toward him. “It was funny.”

Tony winked at Harry and it felt like the tension broke and everyone started talking on top of each other, the whole flat filling with a mixture of voices and laughter and shouts.

Harry didn’t exactly understand all the articles that Hermione sent him about the origin of Thanksgiving (how could someone ‘discover’ a country if they were met there by others?), but he thought he might like the holiday anyway.

 

“Hey, you animals!” Pepper snapped at everyone filling the table when they all finally took their seats. “We should go around the table first and say what we’re thankful for.”

“Oh, god,” Psycho groaned and threw her head back dramatically. “I just came for the free food.”

“It wasn’t free,” Happy scoffed. “It costs three times as much to cater a Thanksgiving dinner than cook it.”

“Not if you would go through four turkeys if Tony cooked it,” Bruce quipped, drawing a few chuckles.

“I’ll start,” Pepper said in a no-nonsense tone. She smiled around the table, her soft teal eyes lingering on Harry for a moment. “I am so thankful to have our family all together today.”

“Hear, hear,” Sirius said merrily, raising his glass.

Pepper looked toward Tony and cleared her throat pointedly.

“I am thankful that… that I get to spend this holiday with my son,” Tony said, winking at Harry despite Harry’s ferocious scowl.

Embarrassing. These people were embarrassing.

“I’m thankful for food,” Happy followed up immediately, lightening the solemn air.

Bruce was thankful for ‘his friends’, Pietro was thankful for freedom, and then everyone looked toward Sirius.

Sirius coughed and Harry saw him swallow harshly as he lifted his eyes up to the ceiling.

“I’m just thankful to be here,” Sirius said, a bit gruffly.

Harry didn’t know if anyone else knew about the thoughts that he and Sirius shared - the ones that told them the world was better off without them in it - but Harry knew what all those six simple words encapsulated.

Sirius was there, he was free, he was something close to happy. Sirius was alive, he was making friends and… and shagging half the city… Sirius was there.

Peter looked startled for a moment when everyone looked at him next.

“Uh… I’m grateful for oxygen and water,” Peter said with a shrug of his shoulders. “And for college resume requirements of volunteer work.”

Pepper laughed quietly, hiding a smile behind her hand, and Harry scrunched his nose when the spotlight was on him once again.

What was Harry thankful for? Everything? Nothing?

Was Harry meant to be thankful that Bucky killed Voldemort when it cost Harry his leg? His pride? His entire feeling of becoming a man?

Was Harry meant to be thankful that Draco Malfoy’s dad, a man - a parent - who stood by and watched as Harry was tortured, had been killed? Was he meant to be thankful that Pettigrew was dead and the legal wrongs done to Sirius were swept under a rug?

Harry was thankful to his dad, he was thankful that he wanted Harry, loved him, and didn’t seem inclined to ship him off or sign him away as everyone else in his life had. Harry was thankful that Pepper let him get a dog, that Sirius was always there to listen to him complain, and for a lot of things that a lot of people at the table had done for him.

None of which that Harry could say when his throat was clogged up and everyone was staring at him expectantly.

“I…”

Ding!

Oh, thank God.

Harry actually slumped down in his chair with relief when the lift door dinged and everyone immediately turned toward it with various expressions of confusion.

Sirius had his wand already in hand and Clint had an arrow notched in his bow; Harry and Peter exchanged quick looks of wry amusement.

Steve Rogers stepped off the lift with his head bowed and his broad shoulders curled in some. When he lifted his face and saw everyone looking at him, he raised a hand and glanced at Harry questioningly before quickly fixing Tony with his gaze.

“Hey, Tony. Can we talk?”

Tony stood up so quickly that he actually knocked his chair over and he had Steve by his shirt collar in another movement.

Rhodey put his foot behind Harry’s wheel when Harry immediately went to back his dad up and Harry nudged Peter with his right foot in a pointed manner.

Peter and Sirius were both out of their seats quickly, walking quickly to the foyer while Tony slammed Steve against the wall.

“You really don’t want to be here right now, Cap,” Tony snapped, his face right in Steve’s. “I’m really damned tempted to have you thrown in the same prison as Barnes.”

Hospital, Harry silently corrected him. Bucky didn’t go to Azkaban or muggle prison, he was in St. Mungo’s.

All of Bucky’s problems with himself and his madness could be solved with magic.

Harry hoped Bucky was thankful for that.

“Tony, I had no idea,” Steve said. He put his hands on Tony’s chest until Sirius leveled his wand at his head over Tony’s shoulder.

“I didn’t know any of it,” Steve said, holding his hands up pleadingly. “Can we talk? I… he’s my family, Tony, the last family I have. But you’re my family too.”

“You want to talk?” Tony pulled Steve away from the wall and then slammed him against it, startling a yelp from Pepper and a twitch from Harry. “Sure, let’s talk.”

“Tony!” Rhodey stood up, but he still had his foot firmly behind the wheel of Harry’s chair, as good as locking him in place. Rhodey shook his head at Tony and glanced down significantly toward Harry. “Not here, man.”

“Fine.” Tony jerked Steve to the side and gave him a harsh push toward the door for his office. Tony nodded approvingly when Sirius followed him, but blocked Peter from joining them. “Go sit, Spider-Kid, we’ve got this.”

Rhodey slowly sat back down when Tony, Steve, and Sirius all went in Tony’s office and Sirius slammed the door shut behind them.

“I…” Pepper looked around the table and Harry felt bad for the look of disappointment in the set of her lips. “I guess we can eat, they’ll be done soon.”

Harry wasn’t going to announce it to the whole room, especially not with the thick and unease tension in the air, but he did pull out his phone and sent Pepper a quick and simple message.

I’m thankful for you.

Pepper looked at the electronic watch she wore and then Harry felt more than saw when she smiled softly at him.

Everyone began picking at their food, everyone probably wondering about what was happening in the office. Clint and Psycho kept exchanging looks beside each other and Harry kept his head down when Strange kept giving him thoughtful looks.

“I DON’T GIVE A DAMN!”

“Why Sirius is not using a silencing spell, I will never know,” Pietro drawled. Peter laughed, but Harry had carefully put his fork down at whatever his dad was shouting about.

“Move your foot or you’ll need a wheelchair too,” Harry told Rhodey flatly. He stared deadpan at the man until he pulled his foot away from Harry’s chair so that he could carefully back up and then tried to wiggle behind the row of chairs until he got to Tony’s office.

Harry knocked, politely, and—

“THEY HAD TO AMPUTATE HIS GOD DAMNED LEG, STEVE! HE ALMOST DIED!”

“Oh, this is fun,” Psycho muttered at her seat behind Harry.

Harry knocked again. “Siri, open the bloody door.”

The door flew open immediately and Harry wheeled just in the doorway. Tony and Steve were in each others faces and Sirius was standing right beside Tony, his hand on each of their shoulders. The three of them looked toward Harry and Harry only looked at Tony.

“You’re upsetting Pepper,” he told Tony quietly. “She worked her arse off and you’re kind of ruining it. Feel free to keep fighting though, it’s really great hearing you scream about my leg to every person you know.”

Tony was breathing heavily for a moment, moving his eyes back to Steve, but he finally agreed.

“Harry’s right,” he said. Tony pushed Steve hard in the chest. “Leave.”

Steve was still staring at Harry with blue eyes that were horrified, an incredibly fun way for Harry to make people feel.

“Keep staring at him and you’ll get a matching chair,” Sirius snarled with his wand aimed at Steve. It would have made Harry grin at any other time that Sirius and Harry were using the same threats now. “Go.”

Steve nodded and looked at Tony once more. “I’m sorry, Tony. If you ever want to talk, you know where I’ll be.”

Harry, helpfully, backed out of the doorway so Steve could walk through it. Steve hesitated beside Harry for just a moment and looked down at him.

“You’re a strong kid,” he said quietly. “I’m sorry you have to be.”

Harry nodded and waited until he heard the lift doors opening before he looked up at his dad and godfather.

“Can someone put a chair where I’m sitting so everyone will quit looking at me like I’m the most pathetic person in the room?” Harry asked them shortly. “I prefer when Sirius is the one getting all the pitiful looks.”

“Absolutely,” Tony said. He brushed his shirt off and clapped Sirius on the shoulder before breezing right back out of his office. “Hey, Pietro, go grab the kid’s chair, will you? It’s in Bruce’s place.”

“Why’s it in my place?” Bruce grumbled.

“Sorry, kiddo,” Sirius said as he too went to leave the office. “I couldn’t let your dad do all the fighting though, eh?”

“Sure,” Harry said shortly. He glared at his godfather. “Does he- do I make everything harder?” Harry asked quietly, quiet enough to not be overheard by the others who picked conversation back up in the other room.

“Yup, totally worth it though,” Sirius said with unflappable cheeriness. “Want me to push you to the table?”

“No.”

Harry was actually sick of people pushing him around, literally.

 

After Harry made it back to the table and had edged carefully from his wheelchair to a normal chair, everyone started eating and talking and it felt more like Sunday dinner and less like the most discomforting event ever.

Peter started chatting about their classmates to Harry, filling him in on Flash Thompson irritating Peter only to find his locker later spider-webbed shut. At the opposite end of the table, Tony and Pepper had their heads bent together and were talking about something quietly, something that had Tony chuckling under his breath every now and again. And Sirius… Sirius was doing some odd dance between bantering with Pietro and fighting with Strange.

“Which is better, something you have to learn or something you’re born with?” Sirius asked Pietro while smirking at Strange.

“Something you have to learn means you worked harder for it and you’re less likely to take it for granted,” Strange said, speaking over Pietro’s response. “I know that you probably wouldn’t know what hard work is, as busy as you are with your exceedingly casual lifestyle, but maybe you’ll grow up one day.”

Harry sat up, bristling with indignation, but Peter put his hand on Harry’s knee and shook his head with a grin.

“I think they’re flirting,” Peter whispered to Harry after tilting his head toward him. Harry’s neck heated up at Peter’s warm breath washing over the side of his face. “Look at how Sirius is grinning.”

Harry glanced at his godfather and saw that there was a spark in his eyes, one that Harry didn’t often get to see.

“One more insult and you should hit Strange with a web,” Harry whispered back to Peter.

“Deal,” Peter winked.

“I am an adult!” Sirius told Strange. He probably would have seemed more grown up if it hadn’t been for the marshmallows coating his fork. “Sorry I went to an actual school for magic and you just went to some mountaintop and learned voodoo, but—”

“Voodoo?”

Most the table had quieted their own side conversations to listen to the two wizards bantering at that point. Clint was miming something to Pietro that had the two of them snickering across the table from each other like second years.

“How can you possibly compare your parlor tricks with your stick to the magic I pull from the very earth and stars itself?” Strange asked Sirius mockingly.

“I do a hell of a lot more than parlor tricks with my stick,” Sirius drawled. He elbowed Pietro at his right side. “Right?”

“Absolutely,” Pietro agreed with his own twisted smirk. “It’s truly a magical stick.”

Rhodey choked on his piece of pumpkin pie - a mushy dessert that was nothing like pumpkin pastries - and Tony burst out in loud laughter from his end of the table.

“It’s called a wand,” Harry murmured to Peter. Peter scooted his chair closer to Harry’s and then swapped their plates, taking the mushy pie from Harry and giving him his raspberry cheesecake that he apparently didn’t like.

“It’s an innuendo,” Peter whispered with a grin.

It took Harry a moment to put that together and then his face flushed a hot red once he did.

Magical stick, disgusting.

“A magical stick is nothing if you don’t know what all you can do with it,” Strange fired back at Sirius. He leaned across the table and laced his fingers beneath his chin. “How good with your stick do you believe you are?”

“Do not answer that, Padfoot!” Harry snapped at his godfather quickly. When everyone glanced at Harry’s abrupt argument, his blush only darkened. “Sirius, if you have ever loved me…”

It vexed Harry to no end that Sirius hesitated for a moment before sitting back in his chair and sticking his nose in the air haughtily.

“Grow up,” Sirius sniffed. “You’re embarrassing Harry.”

Tony caught Harry’s eye from his end of the table and pulled a face that made Harry grin, just for a moment, before he winced and looked down at his lap. Hermione and Tony could call it phantom pains, but it felt real and it felt like Harry’s leg was being crucio’d by an especially furious wizard.

Not Voldemort though… because Bucky killed him.

“Phantom pain?” Strange asked Harry from beside Rhodey, apparently catching Harry’s brief grimace.

“Nope.”

“You’re a horrible liar.”

“I’m not,” Harry said, looking up and staring Strange in the eyes. Harry wasn’t lying, there was nothing ‘phantom’ at all about the way it felt like razor blades were being dragged down his leg and then right back up.

The fact that the leg didn’t exist didn’t seem to matter.

“I’ll teach you a trick to keep you off the potions on Monday,” Strange said. He spun his index finger in a small circle and then reached through the glowing ring of light to pull out a pain relieving potion that he floated down to Harry.

Harry pocketed it quickly, hating the curious and pitiful looks the others gave him.

It would almost be worth it to get a fake leg - like Moody, like Pettigrew, like Bucky; like everyone who tried to kill him - just to end the looks.

 

The sun had completely set outside by the time people began leaving. Sirius had magicked away the dishes, Clint and Psycho took the leftovers, Bruce and Pietro restored the furniture to how it normally looked, and Harry collapsed on the side sofa the moment he could.

“Now that you don’t need to look tough in front of Petey, why don’t you take that potion?”

Harry lifted his head and didn’t even have the energy to roll his eyes at Tony. Harry’s invisible leg was on fire, burning every nerve in a way it never had when it existed.

“I wasn’t trying to look tough,” Harry grumbled as he rolled on his side to pull the vial from his pocket. Tony was already grabbing Harry’s other medicine, so Harry waited until he put two pills in his hand to swallow them down with the pain reliever.

“Better?” Tony asked. He sat down on the end of the sofa by Harry’s foot and seemed to actually be waiting for an answer.

“Some,” Harry admitted. He scooted up and stared down at the flat trouser leg on his left side and twisted his face up irritably. It didn’t exist, Harry could see that with his own two eyes.

“It’s normal, but it should fade with time,” Tony said, somehow tracking Harry’s silent musings. “There’s probably some tricks your physical therapist can give us next week.”

Harry nodded and then took a chance as he scooted around until he could put his head on Tony’s lap.

“Tired, kid?”

“Yeah,” Harry said. He closed his eyes and nearly smiled when Tony began combing his fingers through Harry’s hair in a soothing motion. “Dad?”

“Yeah?”

“He really killed Voldemort?”

“He did,” Tony said neutrally. “I saw the head myself.”

Harry swallowed a lump in his throat. “So in the grand scheme of things, the big picture, what’s one leg?”

If Bucky killed Voldemort, someone who killed Harry’s parents, killed Cedric, planned to kill possibly thousands more, how could Harry be upset about a leg?

Harry lost his parents, his childhood really, to have Voldemort defeated once. It shouldn’t matter that it was Harry who had to sacrifice again for Voldemort to be defeated again.

Voldemort was dead, Bucky killed him.

Harry should be thankful.

“There were about seven hundred and fourteen ways that we could have gotten Voldemort’s head that didn’t involve you losing anything,” Tony said, sounding so assured of it. “Am I glad that Darth Vader is dead and all that’s left is finding some little trophies of his and destroying them? Hell yeah. Am I thrilled that instead of getting a competent adult that Barnes decided to take you on some sick cross country trip? Nope, not at all.”

Harry opened his eyes and blinked at his dad. “Trophies?” he asked blankly. “What trophies?”

Tony snorted, but he kept stroking Harry’s hair in a soothing way. “Gandalf the Lame said they’re called horcruxes, which kind of makes them sound much more fun than they are. Sirius about threw up on my office floor when they came to talk about them.”

“Gross,” Harry murmured. He tried to stifle a yawn, he hated that drowsy feeling the potions gave him, but Tony just chuckled.

“Don’t worry about it,” Tony said, his voice swimming in Harry’s tired mind. “Darth Vader is officially not your problem, kid.”

Thankfully, because Harry didn’t know what else he was meant to give up just to keep one wizard from killing thousands.

Chapter Text

Tuesday, November 28

“Good morning, gorgeous, how was your weekend?”

Tony grinned to himself as he spun around in his desk chair at Pepper’s exasperated sigh. The woman really hated to have her morning drive interrupted by phone calls, but some things couldn’t wait for eight.

“What did you do now, Tony?” Pepper asked him.

Tony chuckled as he continued to spin and talk. “What did I do? Nothing. I’m an innocent party here, Pep. The real question is, what can you do for me?”

Marry me.

Give my son a sibling.

Love me like I love you.

“If I ask you that then you’re going to send me ninety different sex positions,” Pepper said, Tony could practically hear the eye roll from over the phone. “Get to the point, please.”

“Fine.” Tony huffed dramatically in his earpiece. “I need you to send out an email that says all important information needs to be sent to you as you are officially the head of Stark Industries until at least the new year.”

Possibly longer.

Maybe forever.

Who knew?

Pepper didn’t seem surprised; she was a smart woman, she probably knew it was coming. Between the new treasure hunt from Gandalf, Harry’s new schedule, and finding time to breathe, Tony didn’t have spare time for the company.

“Okay,” Pepper agreed easily. “Do you still want the monthly investors meeting?”

“Yes,” Tony said quickly. “Harry loves those.”

“And are we making any official release on Harry?”

Tony hummed while he considered it. As much as Tony would love to just lock his son in the tower, keep him away from reporters and sociopaths alike, it wasn’t realistic.

“What do you think?” he asked Pepper. “Get in front of it now, or wait for it to get out and then say something?”

Pepper hesitated, clearly as torn as he was on it. “Maybe something brief? Mention that Harry had an accident, he’s fine, and you’re stepping away from the company to focus on your son?”

“Sounds good to me,” Tony said. He looked at the alert on his watch that said Harry’s shower was on. It was a handy tab to have, since apparently the kid was prone to scalding his skin off when he was in a mood.

“Alright, I’m off to get ready for ensure absolutely going to be a fun filled day of physical therapy,” Tony said as cheerfully as he could. “Oh, before I go, what are you doing this weekend?”

“My sister is coming to visit.”

“Perfect! Bring her to vegas with us to elope?”

“Goodbye, Tony,” Pepper laughed.

“That wasn’t a no,” Tony said quickly, getting the last word in before Pepper hung up on him.

One day it would be a yes. Tony just had to be the man that Pepper deserved before she found someone else.

 

Tony was whistling merrily while he laid out breakfast.

Two cups of coffee, Harry liked cream and sugar in his.

A bowl and a spoon for Harry and a box of the marshmallow cereal he liked, a bagel and cream cheese for Tony.

Medicine for Harry… Tony hesitated when he went to grab them… Strange had been working yesterday with Harry on healing the phantom pains with whatever magic he used to heal the tremor in his fingers, but…

Tony went ahead and grabbed a pain reliever, if Harry didn’t need it then he might want it after physical therapy.

“Good morning, favorite son of mine,” Tony sang when Harry eventually wheeled himself from his room. He looked better than he had over the weekend, less exhausted and miserable.

It was a shame that Tony got lectured by Harry’s friend’s mother about overusing Dreamless Sleep potions because those were a guaranteed way to help the kid sleep through the night.

Damn Harry’s predisposition to addiction; Tony’s fault, probably not Lily’s.

“I’m your only son,” Harry said.

“Only son that we know of,” Tony winked. He waited until Harry was at the new counter to slide him his cup of coffee. “There could be dozens of little Tiny Tony’s roaming around in other countries.”

Harry blinked at him and then shook his head. “That’s terrifying,” he said. “Am I supposed to get a DNA test any time I date someone?”

Tony threw his head back and laughed at the very Tony-like question coming from his (hopefully) only child.

“Petey’s probably safe,” Tony said. “But if you happen to find a dashing young lady with our good looks then a quick DNA test wouldn’t hurt before procreating. I’d rather my grandkids not have crossed eyes and eleven toes.”

Harry snorted quietly while he started eating and there was a tiny glimmer of amusement in his eyes which Tony counted as an absolute win.

“I’ve never thought about having kids,” Harry said thoughtfully after they both made a dent in their food. “I reckon I’d adopt though, keep the poor bastards from getting my genetics.”

“You have excellent genetics,” Tony told him. “My brains, my good looks…”

And Lily’s eyes?

It was a shame that Tony didn’t know all that much about the woman who gave birth to his son. He knew she had curves to die for and had some truly naughty tricks she could do with her tongue.

“My broken brain, my cursed luck, and my depression.” Harry looked up at Tony with his spoon hovering in front of his mouth. “All genetic, right?”

“Not the luck, no,” Tony acquiesced. It was kind of tragic that Harry didn’t want biological kids based on all the things that Tony himself passed on to his son.

Harry raised a shoulder in a ‘there you have it’ move and Tony figured it was time to change the subject.

“When should I be expecting an influx of gingers?” Tony asked, hoping to find something more cheerful to discuss. “I’m not sure when wizard schools decide to go on break. And with their lack of electricity, I’m not sure how they keep track of the date even.”

It was the perfect question to ask, if Tony wanted Harry to look suddenly uneasy.

“You know I can tell them all not to come, right?” Harry said, narrowing his eyes at Tony. “They’re loud, and they’ll probably trash the place. Luna might even bring creatures.”

While that actually sounded like a nightmare, and six additional teenagers were sure to be a migraine, Tony wasn’t going to be the house where his kid couldn’t have friends over.

That was Howard’s house- only distinguished guests, and none of Tony’s friends had ever been distinguished. Hell, Rhodey didn’t get to see the inside of his parents house until they’d died- murdered -and Tony needed help packing it up.

“You never got to meet them, but you would have liked Rhodey’s parents,” Tony told Harry abruptly as he thought of it. “His mom was young, his dad was a general that was always on deployment until Rhodey went to college. They always let him bring home friends for school breaks and had a basement with a pool table and a mini fridge.”

Harry stared at Tony as he tried to find the relevance to their current conversation.

“I’m saying let’s get a pool table,” Tony said with a shrug. He snapped his fingers as he had a genius idea. “The floor under ours is empty now, I think Pietro took Thor’s room in Sirius’ place. Nat and Clint have their own places. We can make Steve’s old place somewhere you can have friends over. I’m assuming they might want to come again this summer?”

And God knew that if Steve wanted to come back he’d have to fight it out with Sirius as much as he would Tony. It certainly hadn’t been Tony who’d socked Captain America in the jaw with a sharp right hook when he asked where Barnes was.

“You… you’d let me friends come over in the summer too?” Harry asked, sounding unfairly surprised.

“Why not?” Tony asked. It was a much less unappealing idea now that he’d thought of creating a whole teen friendly floor of the tower. With JARVIS installed, it would be perfectly safe and the noise would be an entire floor away from Tony.

“You know Ron my first friend,” Harry said as he dug out the remainder of his cereal. Tony raised his brows, interested to hear more. Harry was reticent on a good day, damn near mute on a bad.

“We met on the way to Hogwarts,” Harry told him, the ghost of a grin on his lips. “We met Hermione too, but she was annoying.”

Tony laughed at the thought of the brainiac girl with the wild hair. “Can’t imagine why,” he joked.

“First thing she did was tell Ron off for using magic,” Harry said with his own smile. “Then Ron and I accidentally locked a troll in the loo with her and we’ve all been friends ever since. Well,” Harry paused and scrunched his face up, “we were pissed at Hermione in third year and I was pissed at Ron in fourth, but mostly we’ve been friends. Ron’s family usually let me stay with them in the summer. We saw the Quidditch World Cup last summer.”

“And now Ron can come here,” Tony grinned. “Let’s hear more about that World Cup though.”

Tony, personally, didn’t give a damn about sports of any kind, he never had. But if a sport had involved flying through the skies, he might have given it a shot.

Harry straightened up and poured himself some more cereal while he began enthusiastically describing a quidditch match in nearly painful detail.

Ask the kid to do long division and it’s a blank stare, bring up quaffles and bludgers and it’s all waving hands and rushed sentences.

It was adorable, actually.

Harry used up the rest of their morning by talking quidditch, and Tony made a mental note to himself to find out where next summer’s event would be held at.

 

“What’s physical therapy like?” Harry asked with the tiniest tremor of unease in his voice. The two of them were on the elevator, headed down to the garage to make it to Harry’s first appointment.

“It’s much less painful than regular therapy,” Tony assured him. “It’s basically just working out, stretches and stuff.”

“Ah.”

“I did physical therapy when I got back from Afghanistan,” Tony said. He waited for Harry to push himself from the elevator and thought about the brief couple of months that he’d suffered through the therapy needed to get his body back in shape.

“It’s not terrible,” he said. Tony snagged the key for the SUV, something subtle and big enough to slide Harry’s chair in the trunk. “And I looked your therapist up, she’s one of the best in the country.”

Harry nodded and then seemed to use all of his concentration on sliding sideways from his chair to the passenger seat. Tony hovered anxiously, terrified he was going to fall, but Harry managed it and looked a little smug once he was in. Tony quickly had the chair folded up and packed.

“Ready?” he asked Harry once he was in.

Harry had a brief little wistful look in his eyes when he glanced at the drivers side. “I guess so,” he sighed.

“You know you’re only supposed to use your right foot when you drive,” Tony reminded Harry as he backed out of his spot and headed toward the hospital. “There’s literally no reason you can‘t get your permit in January and be licensed on your next birthday.”

Harry hummed noncommittally so Tony set the radio to connect to Harry’s phone and waited for him to start playing his crap music.

“Peter’s playlist again, huh?” Tony grinned when he saw the name of the playlist Harry pulled up. “You two made up then?”

Harry’s only response was to scowl at Tony with a face as red as his hoodie and then to turn the radio up full blast.

Teenagers were fun.

 

Tony pulled up to the valet in the front of the hospital and tossed the guy his keys after he got Harry’s chair out.

“So much for unnoticed,” Harry said sharply while he gave the gawking valet the stink eye.

“Pains of fame,” Tony said carelessly. The valet didn’t whip his phone out and nobody else had taken notice of their arrival, so Tony doubted if Harry’s privacy was being violated too badly. “Mind if I navigate?”

Harry folded his hands on his lap so Tony figured it was as good as permission.

In the endless amounts of research on handicapped teenagers and lower limb amputees that Pepper sent Tony, he was chagrined to realize he sort of grabbed the chair without asking Harry a little too often. Also, apparently, for some ungodly reason, almost a third of lower limb amputees chose to not use a prosthetic.

Even though Tony could personally ensure that Harry had the most badass fake leg in the world.

 

Doctor Torres’ office was simple enough to find, they just followed the giant signs for physical therapy that were painted with her wide smile.

“Like I said, best in the country,” Tony reminded Harry when Harry scoffed at one of the signs. “And don’t laugh, kid, I’m pretty sure there’s a school in Tennessee that uses my photo on their billboard.”

“Why?”

Tony grinned fondly, thinking of the only other kid he’d ever not-hated.

“I crashed my suit in Tennessee, camped out in a garage. I met this kid, Harley, who helped me. He’s a sophomore now, right about your age. Anyway, he writes to me sometimes and I think I sponsored his school, or something.”

“So he’s like my older brother then,” Harry said, his tone pensive enough to put Tony on edge.

“Mm… maybe more like your cousin,” Tony said carefully. He navigated the chair through the hallway and could see the office at the end of the hall. “I send him a card on his birthday, I’ll sign your name on the next one.”

“Don’t bother,” Harry muttered quietly. Tony backed in the office, pulling Harry in with him, and was taken aback by the packed waiting room.

The packed waiting room of what seemed to be half a dozen veterans with various injuries and amputations.

“Oh, fuck me,” Harry whispered so quietly that only Tony could hear him. Harry twisted his head around and Tony could see the sudden panic in his green eyes. “Dad, I can’t…”

Yeah, Tony wasn’t feeling so great either. But he was the grown up, so he had to show some grit.

“This is fine,” Tony told Harry quietly. He held his head up high and kept a charming smile on his face while he pushed Harry to the window where a pretty, young, secretary sat.

“Hello,” Tony told her, “we have an appointment at ten with Doctor Torres?”

The young woman flashed her own smile at Tony before looking at the computer. “Harry Stark?”

“That’s me,” Harry said, sounding as if he’d rather be anyone else in the moment.

“Great.” The woman smiled at Harry before handing Tony a clipboard with a couple of sheets of paper on it. “Your wife sent ahead most of the paperwork, we just need a little more medical history. You can have a seat out there and just bring it back when we call your name, okay?”

“Perfect,” Tony said, not bothering to correct her on the wife assumption. He backed Harry up to the closest available seat, right next to what seemed to be a soldier missing his entire right leg.

“Hey, look,” the soldier leaned across Tony and nodded at Harry with a little smirk, “we’re a perfect match.”

Harry scowled at him and then tried to hastily hide the scowl while Tony started on the paperwork.

“Hilarious,” Harry said dryly before turning his face to look at the wall opposite them.

“Hey, have you ever had any surgery?” Tony asked Harry as he filled in ‘allergies’ and was at a loss for the rest of the questions.

“Er… no.”

“Any idea what your mom’s medical history was like?”

Harry stared at Tony with a deep look of nearly comical disdain.

“Yeah, Dad, my aunt was real open about her medical history,” Harry snapped. “And Mum told me everything she knew, unfortunately I was one so I forgot it all.”

“Right,” Tony said, bobbing his head. He drew a few question marks on the majority of the questions and then slapped the clipboard down on his lap and checked the time, five til.

With nothing else to keep Tony’s wandering attention, he looked over at the young man sitting beside him.

“What are you in for?” Tony asked.

The guy grinned roguishly, too damn young to have been in any real conflict that could have resulted in an amputation.

“Friendly fire, shot me in the thigh at Fort Jackson,” he said. He offered Tony his hand, “Specialist Ramsey.”

“Tony Stark,” Tony said as he shook his hand. Tony tilted his head out and tried to get a better look at the BDU covered legs. “No prosthetic?”

“Dad!” Harry hissed.

“You’re his dad?” Ramsey asked Tony, indicating Harry. After Tony nodded, Ramsey’s dark eyes became even darker, troubled. “You’re in for a tough ride. Prosthetics are expensive, they’re uncomfortable, and crutches are usually just easier to deal with.”

Tony hummed just before a door opened and Harry’s name was called.

“Hey, send me a text sometime,” Tony said, he grabbed a card from his jacket pocket and passed it to Ramsey. “Let’s talk about those prosthetics sometime, alright?”

“Sure,” Ramsey said, sounding puzzled. He held the card up and then tucked it in his own jacket pocket. “Thanks, man. And good luck, kid, Callie’s great.”

Harry and Tony both nodded in tangent as they moved to the inner office.

“You want to buy him a prosthetic?” Harry murmured up to Tony while they followed the nurse with the swinging hips through a hall.

“Nope. I want to build him one,” Tony said, his mind already creating blueprints and prototypes. “Expenses and discomfort can be reduced, but they’d have to all be individually made, they can’t be mass produced, I think that’s where the expenses come in…”

“You’re right and you’re wrong.”

Tony shook away his thoughts, tucking them in a vault for safekeeping when he could get back at them, and saw that Doctor Torres had came outside her office and waited on them with a smile.

“Doctor Torres, call me Callie,” she said, offering Harry her hand before Tony. “Harry, you ready to lose these training wheels and get back on your feet?”

“Foot,” Harry said flatly. “My foot.”

“Foot, feet, who cares,” Callie said airily. She tossed her dark hair over her shoulder and didn’t let her smile waver once. “You ready?”

“Am I not- not going back as well?” Tony asked, caught by surprise. “I thought I’d be going back.”

“Harry’s practically an adult, I think we can handle it,” Callie said. She raised a black eyebrow at Tony when he didn’t remove his hands from Harry’s chair. “Tony, seriously, it’s usually easier the first couple of times if we just rip the bandaid right off, you know? He’s perfectly fine with me.”

Tony slowly pried his fingers off the handles, hating it the entire time.

“I’ll just wait in the…?”

“We have a family waiting area down the hall and to the left,” Callie said, pointing the way. “We’ll see you in a couple of hours.”

“Couple of hours, great,” Tony said to himself as he watched Harry disappear with the doctor. “Yeah, yeah, I’ll just… I’ll just wait in the family area. Cool… cool…”

Tony found the lounge waiting area easily enough, and it wasn’t a bad place to waste a couple of hours. There were counters and outlets, TV’s covering the walls, even a few laptops set up at the tables against the windows.

There was only one other person in there, a man around his late twenties with dark skin and his eyes closed as he had his head tilted back.

Tony made himself comfortable at one of the stools and immediately pulled his phone out and began transferring all the notes in his head to tangible ones on his phone.

It wasn’t difficult to construct the limbs, and comfort could be tweaked and played with until it felt as natural as breathing, but the individual expense of each limb would be astronomical and Tony couldn’t find a way to lessen the cost while maintaining the quality…

“Can you change the iron to something cheaper and more lightweight, like aluminum?”

Tony didn’t jump, but he certainly twitched at the sudden voice that broke through his design. A quick glance over his shoulder told him that the other occupant was awake and nosing in Tony’s design work.

“Aluminum would crush under too much pressure,” Tony told him. He didn’t mind if someone wanted to standby and bounce ideas off of, it often brought out Tony’s own locked-in brilliance.

The man pulled the chair out beside Tony and plopped down. “Not if you reinforce it on the inside with rods of iron.”

“That’s not exactly conducive to bend at the knee.”

“Nah, look.” The man snatched Tony’s phone and began drawing his finger over the screen, scrapping and recreating the design. Tony watched in rapt attention as the man began drafting out thin rods that lined the calf and the thigh and ended at the knee.

“You’d have to add something here, to connect them, and it would have to bend…” the man said as he paused to scratch at the neatly trimmed black beard around his mouth. “And the knee’s the hardest part, because it’s the most wore down…”

“What about…” Tony took the phone back and wished he’d brought his tablet with him, a bigger screen he could manipulate. “This?” Tony drew out a more flexible device, one that was reinforced with its own miniature rods of iron.

“But then it’s still just as expensive,” the man pointed out, gesturing the the running supply total that Tony kept up on the program.

“Damn it,” Tony swore. He clicked the screen off and slid it away irritably. “A comfortable leg for a wounded soldier shouldn’t cost—”

The man chuckled, “An arm and leg?” He relaxed in his chair and offered Tony his hand. “Sam Wilson.”

Tony shook his hand while the name niggled at something. “Do I know you?” Tony asked, not bothering to share his name.

“We have - had - a mutual friend,” Wilson said. “Are you here for someone in your team?”

“Mm, no, my son,” Tony admitted. “How about you?”

“A brother in arms,” Wilson said. “Pararescue in the United States Air Force.”

Tony figured Wilson was military, he had that look about him.

“Does Torres mostly specialize with vets or does she just accept your insurance?” Tony asked.

“Both,” Wilson laughed, unflappable. “Callie’s great, the guys all love her. How old’s your boy? About sixteen?”

“Who’d you say our mutual friend was?” Tony asked, seeing that Wilson seemed to know a bit about Harry despite not seeming like a big fan.

Wilson grimaced then and leaned his chair back for a moment before resting it on the ground. “Rogers, actually. I haven’t been able to get ahold of him lately, you’re doing, I’d guess?”

“You’d guess I, what? Killed him?” Tony asked curiously. “Locked him in my basement? Sailed his body down the river?”

“Buried in a hole with Barnes,” Wilson shrugged after crossing his arms over his chest. “I saw the news, I tried to help join some of the search teams, and if your kid’s here then I’m guessing it didn’t have such a happy ending.”

“It didn’t,” Tony said, cooling his voice a few degrees. He had no interest in buddying up with Steve’s friend, not now that he recalled seeing footage of Sam Wilson flying through the air, fighting side-by-side with Steve.

“Mind telling me what happened before I see it anyway?” Wilson asked.

“Oh, sure.” Tony turned and stared him down as hard as he could, putting real force in his glare. “Your good buddy, Barnes, kidnapped my kid. Harry tries to escape, what happens? Breaks his leg. Does Barnes detour to an ER? Nope! Kept driving to God damned Mexico, where he buried my son under probably seventy pounds of dirty produce and ditched Harry in a filthy motel where he forgot about him!

“That,” Tony slapped the countertop hard, “is what happened.”

Wilson laced his hands behind his head and whistled under his breath while he and Tony held each others gazes.

“First, Barnes is not my friend, Barnes is a criminal and I don’t understand what fucking hold he has on Steve,” Wilson said evenly. “Second, I was very much Team Bad Call, when Steve let him go back in May. And I don’t have a third, but I can tell you that I haven’t talked to Steve in a while and don’t plan on it for a while.”

Tony eyed Wilson closely; he was usually a good judge of character. Wilson seemed to be telling the truth, he didn’t blink or fidget even once while Tony stared him down.

“Harry’s leg had to be amputated above the knee, that’s why we’re here,” Tony said, sighing as he admitted it.

Wilson reached over and grasped Tony’s forearm for a moment, looking solemn as he did it. “I’m sorry, man, that’s a rough ride for you both.”

“Yeah, yeah, it’s been hell,” Tony admitted with a joyless laugh. He ran his hand through his hair and then gestures toward his phone. “I can rebuild my whole place to be wheelchair friendly, I can build him the best fucking leg known to man, but he doesn’t give a damn about any of it.” Tony huffed and tried to roll the tight tension from his shoulders. “I’m at a loss here, it’s…”

“Hell,” Wilson supplied again. “It’s always hell, for the patient and the family. They don’t know how to readjust to the new body they’re suddenly in, the one with all these restrictions. And they don’t know how to relate with anyone, because who the fuck can understand it? And you poor bastards are stuck with trying to play housemaid and nurse and therapist. It’s tough, man, props to you for doing what you can.”

“I just…” Tony struggled to admit what really bothered him. “I’ve got nothing but money and time and an entire lab and none of it is making a difference.”

If there was one tangible thing on a list that would fix Harry’s life, Tony would find it or get it. Tony was an inventor, a builder, a mechanic- he was a fixer. And there was nothing that he could fix.

“Are you kidding me?” Wilson chuckled warmly and shook his head. “Tony, I’m here because my guy doesn’t have any family to help him; he’s doing this alone. Harry, your son? He’s got you, and you’re here, in this shitty lounge, drawing blueprints for prosthetics. You’re here, that counts.”

Tony stared at Wilson and willed himself to accept the words at face value.

“It doesn’t count enough,” Tony said flatly. “My kid’s in there, probably crying because what I didn’t tell him is that PT is a bitch, and I’m out here just ‘counting’.”

“Hey, tell you what…” Wilson grabbed Tony’s phone and pulled up the contacts, putting his own number in and sending it a text. “I’ll send you the details, but we have a great group therapy on Saturday mornings down at the VA. It’s mostly vets, but Saturday mornings are our amputee group, family’s welcome too.”

“Is there shitty coffee?” Tony asked, gesturing to the pot sitting on one of the counters in the lounge. Tony hadn’t bothered with it, despite the ache in his head that begged for it, since it looked to be about two days old.

“The VA only pays for the shittiest of coffees,” Wilson laughed. There was a cough from the doorway and Tony and Wilson both looked over to see a man around Wilson’s age leaning on a crutch under his left arm to make up for the missing limb.

“Hey,” the guy nodded at Tony. He had the same buzzcut as the soldier from the waiting room and looked to be in decent shape despite the amputation. “Is that your kid back there?”

“Black hair? Devastatingly handsome? Yeah, he’s mine,” Tony said proudly.

The guy smiled widely while Wilson clapped Tony’s shoulder and joined him in the doorway.

“He’s a trooper, and god damn does he have the mouth of a soldier,” he laughed.

“That’s my son,” Tony said. He raised his hand and watched the two men leave, one hobbling along on crutches and one guiding him with a hand on his back.

Tony imagined his kid back with the doctor, working his ass off and probably begging for death if his therapy was as rigorous as Tony’s had been. Tony imagined Harry running his mouth and glaring at Callie, just hating himself and hating his life.

“That’s my son,” Tony repeated softly to himself. He pulled his phone back to reopen the program he’d been designing with.

Chapter Text

Harry had a schedule that was somehow more packed than it had been when he’d been going to school from eight to three.

Monday mornings Harry was supposed to work on homework and ‘independent study’. It mostly turned to Harry sitting at the counter in the kitchen and asking Tony questions while he worked on his own projects. Tony was brilliant, really, he was always able to answer any question Harry asked him, even when Harry purposefully asked the hardest questions he could. Harry would have thought he was cheating somehow if he didn’t hear Tony answer one of the hard questions in Harry’s revision textbook while he dozed on the sofa.

Strange decided that their session on Monday evenings needed to be doubled in time, half spent on Harry trying to magic away the imaginary pain in his lost-leg and then the other hour spent on regular magic. Or, regular for Strange… strange magic.

Harry was beginning to hate and resent that first hour spent on magic. There wasn’t any way for Harry to envision the magical light flowing through him and easing his pains.

Strange expected too much from Harry. Strange thought Harry was capable of too much, really.

“Harry, if you can’t trust in yourself, trust in me. I know you are capable of great things, I’ve seen it.”

That logic had helped Harry produce a patronus at thirteen, but it did nothing to help Harry heal his own imaginary pain.

Harry had pointed out that Trelawney had seen him killing Voldemort too and that hadn’t happened. Strange hadn’t been amused and Harry was beginning to wonder if he had as crappy of a sense of humor as a doctor as he did a ‘sorcerer’ or whatever he called himself.

To add insult to injury, Strange also began leaving Harry with tomes as thick and dry as any History of Magic textbook had been and instructing him to read several chapters between their classes. Harry learned nothing about brewing potions or transfiguration, but he did learn about the Possessors, the Bottle Imp, and Aggamon.

With Voldemort dead and Harry having little interest in sitting his OWLS, it was tempting to drop his life as a wizard altogether. When had magic ever bettered his life, really? It made him feared and hated by his relatives, it caused him to fear and hate himself quite a bit. Magic killed his parents, magic brought Voldemort to life again and again.

It wasn’t until Tony slammed his hand in a drawer, breaking one of the fingers, and Sirius healed it with a lazy flick of his wand that Harry remembered what good magic could do.

Magic showed him his parents in the Mirror of Erised, it protected him as an infant, it kept Sirius from dying, and it healed so many people.

Plus, magic was still loads better than the physical therapy that Harry suffered through on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

“You’re doing great,” Doctor Callie, a pretty woman with a cold heart, encouraged him. Harry had clenched his jaw hard to keep from letting a scream or cry escape him when he was doing the worst exercise known to man.

Harry was laying on his back with his right leg laying straight and he lifted his left stump over and over, having to hold it straight up while Doctor Callie counted to twenty.

“C’mon, kid, you got this.” The other patient who did therapy when Harry did, Taylor Anderson, paused in his slow walking across a thin platform, to ‘encourage’ Harry.

“Shut the fuck up,” Harry hissed at him. His entire leg was shaking and his muscles were burning at something that should be simple.

“And twenty! Lower it!” Doctor Callie said with a wide smile. “Way to go, Stark. You ready to do the walk again?”

Harry was panting and eyed the walkway that stood in the middle of the room with rails down both sides. It looked easy, it should have been easy, but at Harry’s third session on Tuesday, he’d nearly fallen and ended the session in tears.

“Don’t be a pussy,” Anderson said with a mocking smirk that reminded Harry too much of Draco Malfoy. “C’mon, little Stark, you ready to man up?”

“Piss off,” Harry snapped. He struggled to sit up and used the nearby weight bench to pull himself up off to floor so he could sit on the bench. Anderson wasn’t bad, mostly, but it was like he was flaunting his ability to walk around with crutches despite his recent amputation and mocking Harry in the process.

“Fine,” Harry told Doctor Callie. He accepted the crutches she gave him with extreme reluctance and distaste. The crutches were awkward and made Harry’s gait clumsy and shaky, plus they were a lot more uncomfortable to use than Anderson made it look.

Bloody Anderson.

Harry slowly stood up and wobbled with the crutches under his arms. With Doctor Callie following behind him, Harry did a tricky wobbling walk to the walkway and paused to catch his breath when he eyed the first step to get on it.

“It’s as easy as riding a bike,” Anderson told Harry. “If the bike’s on fire and the handlebars are covered in spikes and everything fucking hurts.”

“I don’t know how to ride a bike,” Harry said with a cold glare. To keep Anderson from mocking him again though, Harry put the crutches on the step and then hopped up. He swayed some and there was a sick sinking in his stomach as if he was going to fall, and then he steadied out.

“Who doesn’t know how to ride a bike?” Anderson asked while he leaned against the rails of his own platform to watch Harry.

“People who grew up in cupboards,” Harry sneered. He glanced toward Doctor Callie who gave Harry an encouraging nod.

“Move your foot first this time,” she said. “Feel the difference when you do it that way.”

Harry hated doing it like that, that was what caused him to fall last time.

“If I fall again then I’m never coming back,” Harry warned the doctor.

“Fair enough,” she laughed. “Take your right crutch and put it under your left arm, okay? Then just grab the rail with your right hand and try to put the majority of your weight on your right side.”

“All sixty pounds,” Anderson snorted.

Harry really wished he had a free hand to flip Anderson off, but moving the crutches took up all of his energy and concentration. Once he had them situated, Harry sent a nervous glance to Doctor Callie, hoping she’d actually make an effort to catch him when he fell.

“You’ve got this,” Doctor Callie said. She was right on the other side of the rail and smiling at Harry. It was like playing good auror, bad auror. Doctor Callie was warm and encouraging, Anderson was pushy and competitive.

And Harry was miserable.

Harry held on to the rail with as much pressure as he could before he lifted his right foot off the ground, only the crutches and rail holding him up for just a moment, and then quickly brought the foot down on the top of the platform and followed it with the crutches.

“Yes! Good job!” Doctor Callie cried. “That’s the hardest part!”

“No way,” Anderson scoffed. He tracked Harry with his sharp eyes as Harry slowly walked down the platform, hating it the whole time. “The stairs back down are the hardest.”

Since that’s what caused Harry to tumble forward last time, he was inclined to agree.

“Now what?” Harry asked Doctor Callie when he got to the end of the walkway and eyed the stairs distastefully. It was embarrassing how heavy Harry was breathing and sweating, getting his arse kicked by something that used to be so simple.

“Crutches first,” Doctor Callie said. “Watch Taylor while you catch your breath, okay?”

“Yeah, Stark, watch me and my excellent stair stepping,” Anderson laughed at Harry. “Ready?”

“I hope you fall,” Harry said, the venom in his tone dulled some by the way he was panting.

Anderson didn’t fall, but he did wobble a bit when he climbed down the stairs for the platform he was on. He basically did what Harry did going up the stairs, but going back down them.

“C’mon, Tiny Tim, see if you can top that,” Anderson bragged with his chest puffed out. When Anderson raised his tan colored shirt he wore to wipe the sweat from his face, Harry peeked very quickly at what were abs that most blokes dreamt of having.

It was a bad time to notice it, but Anderson was rather fit. Even without his lower left leg (amputee twins, he’d called Harry during their first session together), he was clearly in good shape with broad shoulders and a sharp jawline that was highlighted by his short buzzed dark blonde hair.

If he wasn’t an arse, Harry might have found him even more attractive.

“Go fuck yourself,” Harry muttered to Anderson. He waited until Doctor Callie had moved closer before he breathed very slowly, only shaking some, and tried to mimic Anderson’s steps.

It wasn’t pretty, and Harry very nearly fell again, but he did it.

“I did it!” Harry cried, shocked. He let out a startled laugh and looked up at Doctor Callie. “I did it!”

“Hell yes you did,” Doctor Callie said. She was quick to grab Harry’s chair and move it behind him, allowing Harry to gratefully collapse in it. “Let’s start with that next time, okay? And are you doing the at home exercises?”

“Er… yes,” Harry lied. He had been doing them, but in the privacy of his room with none of Doctor Callie’s praise or Anderson’s taunts, it was much easier to quit them when they became painful.

“Liar,” Anderson quipped. “Don’t skip the at home shit, kid, or you’re going to be stuck in that chair for a hell of a lot longer.”

Harry eyed Anderson and his crutches thoughtfully. “How long did it take you to walk again?”

“Eight months.”

“Anderson’s a success case, but he pushed hard in the beginning after he healed,” Doctor Callie cut in quickly. “You don’t want to overdue it and set yourself back, if you’re up on your feet—”

“Foot,” Harry and Anderson said simultaneously.

“If you’re up on your foot and using the crutches regularly by a year, then you’re already ahead of the game, okay?”

“But don’t let your rich daddy talk you into one of those lazy people chairs,” Anderson cut in. “Keep using that one and build your arm muscles up.”

“But don’t over do it,” Doctor Callie said again, shooting Anderson a look. “If you’re tired, let someone push you, okay?”

“Sure,” Harry agreed without really agreeing. “Suppose I’ll see you Tuesday then?”

“I’ll see you Saturday morning,” Anderson smirked. “Come to one meeting, I won’t let anyone bite you.”

Harry scowled at him again and did finally flip him off. Tony had mentioned the ‘group meeting’ after Harry’s first physical therapy session and Harry told him the same thing he told Anderson when he brought it up again on Tuesday: not a chance in hell.

The last thing Harry wanted was to sit in a room full of people missing their limbs and listen to their ‘encouraging stories’ and being told how strong they all were.

“Scared, Stark?” Anderson asked, still smirking at Harry in the most irritating way. “What’s wrong? Afraid you’ll fit in too well?”

“Afraid I’d have to see you three times a week, which is already three times too many,” Harry drawled. He started wheeling himself toward the door and waited for the automatic doorway to open. “See you.”

Anderson called Harry a pussy again, which was apparently as good as calling him a coward, but Harry ignored him.

He wasn’t going to be goaded into joining their amputee club.

 

Tony was in the waiting lounge just down the hall from the therapy room. Tony had brought his laptop, tablet, and phone to Harry’s last few appointments and seemed to be working on something with the bloke, Sam Wilson, who drove Anderson to the appointments.

They were both concentrated fully on whatever Tony had on his screen and Harry took a moment to watch Tony work. It was almost funny to see him with his eyes screwed up and his brain no doubt moving in a million different directions. He murmured to himself occasionally, just odd little words that didn’t mean much to Harry.

Hermione swore that Harry looked the same when he was working on homework, but Harry wasn’t sure he ever looked so focused on anything.

“Oh, hey.” Tony caught sight of Harry in the doorway and flashed him a smile before closing up his laptop and packing it away in his bag. “All done?”

“No, I’m making a break for it,” Harry said seriously. “I can’t run far, but I found this convenient chair to use.”

“Smartass,” Tony laughed. He clapped Wilson on the shoulder as he stood up and the two shared a grin. “See you Saturday then? Bring the wings, I want to check them out.”

“Bring some decent coffee or don’t come at all,” Wilson told him. He nodded his head at Harry. “See you around, Harry.”

Harry waited until he and Tony were safely in the lifts to get back to the lobby to ask about it.

“Pepper’s never going to marry you if you keep going out with random blokes,” Harry told his dad. “I’m beginning to think you never plan on giving me a mum.”

It was a joke, Harry hadn’t even thought of it before he said it, but he had to blink quickly to keep the stinging sensation in his eyes from becoming actual tears.

That was the problem with being part of Tony’s family, it made Harry feel like he was replacing the parents who died for him every time he called Tony dad or Tony referred to Pepper as Harry’s future stepmum.

Sirius said that was a daft thing to worry about, but Harry figured he’d been more screwed on having a family than Harry had been so his opinion didn’t really count.

“It’s not a date,” Tony laughed. “Sam’s got a few soldiers who need prosthetics and I’ve got some prototypes ready to fit-test. I told him I’d bring them to their group.”

Harry gaped at his dad even after the lift doors opened and Tony began striding toward the main entrance of the hospital. It took Harry a moment to catch up, and his arms were screaming in protest with every push of his wheels, but when he did Harry was stunned by the nonchalant expression on Tony’s face.

“You’re building fake legs for soldiers?” Harry asked. He laughed once when Tony nodded. “You never quit, do you?”

Tony gave Harry a puzzled frown but they had to pause their conversation for the valet to bring Tony back his car.

“What do I never quit doing?” Tony asked after they’d both gotten in the car and Tony put Harry’s chair in the back.

Harry leaned his head on the cool glass window and closed his eyes only to open them again when he felt Tony drop something in his lap.

“This!” Harry cried, holding up the potion Tony brought with him. “You bring potions for me and you’re building legs for soldiers and you redesigned your entire home just because I said I didn’t want a fake leg!! You’re just- you…” Harry bit his lower lip hard for a second, trying to put his frustration in words. “You just do nice shit, all the time, and you’re getting nothing in return.

“And before you said ‘oh I got a son’, don’t,” Harry snapped. “You got a cripple who does nothing but make your life harder. I say I don’t want to go to Midtown so you pay someone to teach me math and science. I want to learn magic, so you pay for that. I break my leg and you pay for all of this! Sirius needs a place to stay, you give him his own flat. A soldier lost his leg in a war, you give him a new one.”

Harry was panting some, worn down by his own (probably irrational) anger as he was from the grueling two hours spent with Doctor Callie.

Tony was just so… so… selfless and it made Harry feel like he could never compare to any of the adults in his life, no matter how much he tried.

James stood on his feet and tried to protect his wife and baby, the baby he knew he hadn’t fathered, from Voldemort. Lily was given the option to save herself, and instead she died so Harry could live. Sirius was a bloody superhero, off on missions to find horcruxes and protect muggles in equal measure. Tony was the most selfless damn person Harry had ever met.

Tony didn’t just spend what Harry was sure was an insane amount of money on him either. Tony also knew Harry would be miserable after physical therapy so he brought him a potion. Tony quit joining his team on missions because Harry asked him to. It was as if his entire world just revolved around Harry and it was unnerving.

Because Harry was… was just Harry.

Harry was always going to be Harry J. Potter, from the cupboard under the stairs.

Secret, shameful, not worth the fuss.

“So what’s in it for you?” Harry asked, a little more calmly. “Why do you do all this shit?”

Tony didn’t seem fazed in the slightest by Harry’s hateful rant, he just kept driving back toward the tower with his eyes hidden behind mirrored sunglasses and his lips twisted thoughtfully.

“You make me sound like some selfless bastard with some black and white view on morality,” Tony eventually said after the silence lingered between them for a few minutes. “I’m going to be honest here, kid, so don’t be offended. But half the time I’m just competing against Howard in my head and hoping that when I die I can mock him in hell and tell him that I was twice the father he was with half as much time to adjust to parenthood.”

“I’m assuming he had nine months to prepare, you didn’t even get nine seconds,” Harry said. “I’m not sure if you think that makes you less selfless, but it’s just worse because nobody taught you to be a parent and you’re doing a great job anyway.”

Tony looked over briefly to grin at Harry at his slip up. “Aww, you think I’m doing great? This is probably the sweetest thing you’ve ever said to me. JARVIS, make note: on Thursday, December 7th, at 1512, Harry said I’m doing a great job at being a parent.”

“I hate you,” Harry said flatly. He downed the pain reliever, every muscle in his body begging for it, and then leaned his head against the window again.

“Mm, I think you loveee me,” Tony sang brightly. “Can I expect a ‘world’s best dad’ mug for Christmas?”

“You’re getting a bag of galleons,” Harry said. “And a personal apology letter from Sirius for sending me here to ruin your life.”

“That’s not going to be the most depressing Christmas present I’ve ever received at all,” Tony said sarcastically. “I think it’s only second to the year my parents left me home with a nanny so they could go on a trip. And then the nanny left little six year old me home alone so she could go to a party with her friends.”

Jesus.

“I got a tissue one year.”

“I got an intervention and a stint in rehab one fine Christmas Eve.”

“One time my uncle mailed me a hanger.”

“Howard accepted a Presidential Medal for acts of ingenuity and service to the military at a Christmas Ball and mentioned my mother and Steve Rogers in his acceptance speech and not his son.”

Harry snorted quietly. “That’s messed up.”

“See? I’m just trying to outdo him, don’t think this is about you at all.”

Harry managed to roll his eyes despite having his eyelids closed.

If anyone deserved to be thanked in an acceptance speech for an award, it was Tony. Harry didn’t understand how his grandfather could have not been bursting with pride over Tony’s brilliance and his never ending ideas and the way that he grew to become a literal hero who spent his free time building legs for soldiers.

“If I ever win an award, I’ll mention you,” Harry said quietly as the hum of the car’s engine and the potion were lulling him to sleep.

“Deal.”

 

As physically exhausting as Tuesdays and Thursdays were, Wednesdays and Fridays were nearly just as bad.

The tutor that Tony found, a student at a nearby college who was double majoring in education and mathematics, spent all day at the tower on those two days. Harry never thought he’d be glad to escape to his weekly therapy sessions with Michael, but by the time he could pack away his school books, it was a true relief.

Harry liked the tutor the first time they met, she was young, about twenty, and her brown eyes and black braids reminded him quite a bit of Hermione, but then he began to despise her the more time they spent together. Every Wednesday and Friday, Harry was exposed to the tutoring torture.

The tutor Tony found was a cheerful woman named Paris and she was a genius and more strict of a teacher than even McGonagall. She was patient enough though, but the way she seemed to know everything grated on Harry’s nerves.

Hermione knew everything as well, but it was something Harry liked in her that he didn’t in Paris.

“Morning,” Paris said brightly when she arrived for their third session. She had on a jumper with her college logo on it and a casual pair of jeans. Harry eyed her backpack warily though, certain it contained nothing but torture.

“Are we in the kitchen or living room today?” she asked Harry.

“Kitchen,” Harry sighed, wishing he could disappear in the lab as well when Tony slipped away.

“Perfect!” Paris dropped her heavy bag on the counter and pulled a chair out so she could sit across from the little nook that was the perfect size for Harry to sit in his chair at. “How’d you get along with those worksheets I left on Wednesday?”

“Fine,” Harry said. He pulled the worksheets from the folder that sat on his stack of books and handed them to her. “Er… my dad had to help me on a few of them,” he admitted.

“Which one’s?” Paris asked as her keen eyes flicked over Harry’s scrawled answers.

They spent the first hour going over the worksheets with Paris explaining which answers Harry missed and how to answer them correctly. They didn’t spend long on English, as it was the one subject that Harry wasn’t rubbish at, but then science and mathematics made Harry truly want to scream.

The only thing that got Harry through their session was the knowledge that he only had to suffer through it for half as long as he, Tony, and Sirius had an appointment with President Quahog before Harry had to go to therapy.

Harry worked diligently though, determined not to make his time with Paris a complete waste of Tony’s money. As strict as Paris was, and as much as Harry didn’t want to like her, he could admit that she did have a knack for explaining different concepts in simple enough terms for him.

The whole thing would be less humiliating if they weren’t using a math book meant for sixth graders though, which weren’t the same thing as sixth years at all.

“You’re making soo much progress,” Paris said cheerfully when the alarm she set on her phone went off. Harry politely helped her pack her books up and gave her a wan smile when she put a stack of new worksheets in his ‘homework folder’. “I think we’ll be able to move on to calculus after Christmas.”

“Lucky me,” Harry said drily, actually mildly pleased by that. Calculus was a class at Midtown, which meant Harry was finally getting close to his own peers’ level in at least one area.

If nothing else, Peter might be impressed if he still came over that weekend as they’d tentatively planned.

“Text me if you have any questions, okay?” Paris told Harry after she finished packing up her supplies. “I’ll see you Wednesday, have a good weekend.”

Harry thumped his head down on his stack of books, letting out a heavy sigh of relief when he heard the lift doors close behind her.

“Tutoring’s that fun?” Tony asked when he conveniently left his lab the same time that Paris left the flat.

“I think the only thing that can make it more fun is if she stuck thumb tacks under my nails while she explained the periodic table,” Harry said. He looked over and saw that Tony was still wearing jeans and a red tshirt over a long sleeved black shirt. “Aren’t we having tea with the President?” Harry asked him, eyeing his outfit pointedly.

“Didn’t you meet Obama in an Avril Lavigne shirt and holey jeans?” Tony countered with. Harry tilted his head in silent agreement.

“Wanna see my new party trick?” he asked him instead. When Tony leaned against the wall and nodded, Harry closed his eyes and tried to ‘draw on his magic’ as Strange had him practicing nonstop. He managed it the night before, but it was still the hardest magic he’d ever done.

Harry tried to draw a little circle with his finger, something that was easier on the days after he was able to actually sleep, and Harry smiled genuinely when he saw that it worked.

The little circle of light made a lot of sparks and wasn’t nearly as large as Strange’s (though Strange did say that as soon as Harry was ready, he’d bring him a ‘sling ring’ that would help him channel the magic better). It worked well enough for short distances though and Harry reached through it and felt the exact item he’d been envisioning in his hand.

“Ta da,” Harry said as he pulled his Invisibility Cloak from the odd portal. From the kitchen to Harry’s bedroom was the farthest Harry had managed so far and it had Harry’s heart racing with a sense of excitement.

Who needed accio when Harry could create little portals without even touching a wand? If Harry knew he could do that before, he could have just grabbed the portkey and—

And it wouldn’t have really mattered because Cedric would still be dead and Bucky would probably still have wound up becoming the ‘Savior Soldier’.

Ron said the news hadn’t been so flattering since someone let slip that Harry had been ‘gravely injured’ by Bucky when he’d went to kill Voldemort, but Harry of all people knew that those that were vilified one day were revered the next.

“You can’t use magic to hide your legs from the President,” Tony said with a grin when Harry tucked his cloak around his waist and covered himself from the waist down with it. “Don’t make me call McGonagall.”

“I’ll tell her you told me to do it,” Harry deadpanned. “Who’s she going to believe? Someone she’s known for years or some bloke that’s corrupted her favorite student?”

“Who’s the favorite student? You or Sirius?” Tony asked as the two of them made their way toward the lift. Harry snatched his jacket off the hook in the foyer that the lifts were in, already over ‘New York winters’.

“Sirius,” Harry said honestly. “You should hear him talk about her, I think he’s half in love with her.”

And the way that McGonagall talked about James and Sirius made Harry wonder if they truly were as brilliant at transfiguration as she made them sound or if McGonagall just had a soft spot for them. Harry didn’t think he’d ever had a teacher before who liked him as much as McGonagall did Sirius and James. Maybe Lupin, but he had a personal bias.

Not that Harry had ever been the most successful student, or the most participatory, or the most outgoing…

In hindsight, it actually made a lot of sense that teachers never seemed to like him much.

 

Harry kept his face blank and his thoughts to himself while Happy drove him, Tony, and Sirius to MACUSA Headquarters. Neither Tony nor Sirius seemed worried about the upcoming meeting, but Harry felt he’d earned the right to mistrust any magical authority.

Fudge had seemed to be a kindly and bustling businessman until he called Harry a deranged liar to his face and stood by to give Voldemort leeway to start a second reign.

President Quahog had been… accommodating? understanding?… he’d been polite when Harry met him before, but that was before Sirius was seen on the telly using magic in an area packed with muggles.

“If we go to prison, I’m blaming you,” Harry whispered to Sirius when the three of them got out of the car.

Sirius ruffled Harry’s hair and grinned down at him. “If we do, I know a neat trick on how to escape.”

“D’you think if I became an animagus and it was a dog that I’d have three legs?” Harry asked conversationally as they made their way to the entrance.

Sirius blanched, though Harry had just been being an arse to hide his own tension.

“You’d be a bird, obviously,” Tony said breezily, easing away the sticky moment. “Not a clean bird, like Hedwig, but a messy one. A messy bird that leaves clothes on the floor and toothpaste in the sink.”

“Birds don’t use toothpaste,” Sirius grinned, clearly pleased to jump on the ‘Harry is a slob’ bandwagon.

And Harry was a bit of a slob, but only in the privacy of his room. He’d always been like that; his room was the one area that people didn’t used to enter. And in Harry’s opinion, it was controlled chaos anyway, like Tony’s lab. Sure, his favorite Weasley jumper, the one he got first year and Molly always tweaked to continue fitting him year after year, didn’t belong under his bed, but Harry knew it was there.

“If you don’t like my room, feel free to stay out of it,” Harry sniffed.

“Rude,” Tony winked. He held the door open for Harry and Sirius and then walked to the secretary with his head held high and a smile on his face. “Good morning, beautiful, we’ve been summoned by the man behind the curtain?”

The secretary, the same young woman from the last time they were there, smiled at Tony’s effortless charm and then she looked behind him to where Harry sat. Harry saw the instant that she clocked his wheelchair because her eyes went as wide as galleons.

“Oh… I’ll just, um… I’ll let President Quahog know you’ve arrived,” she stammered, still staring at Harry. “If you’ll follow me.”

Harry was scowling the entire way to the President’s office, embarrassed by the way the woman kept glancing over her shoulder at him.

“You’d look less odd if half your body wasn’t invisible,” Sirius whispered while Tony distracted the woman with some flattery.

Harry stared at his godfather for a moment, wondering if he was just pretending to be daft or if he actually believed what he was saying.

“I’d still be missing a leg,” Harry muttered from the corner of his mouth. “At least now she can’t gossip about why exactly I’m in this fucking chair.”

“Fair enough,” Sirius shrugged.

The woman knocked on the office door that Harry had been inside once before and at the deep voice of the President welcoming them in, she opened the door and gave them a weak smile.

“If you buy a phone next time I come then you could take a photo,” Harry said snidely as she started to walk away. “It’ll be easier to gawk at.”

The woman didn’t turn back, but Sirius chuckled and let Harry follow his dad in the office while he followed Harry and shut the door behind them.

“Afternoon, gentlemen.” President Quahog stood up from behind his massive desk to greet them. The office looked the same as it had last time Harry had been inside of it. The bookshelves were lined neatly with thick books, there was an almost obnoxiously large American flag hanging behind the desk, giving the President a red, white, and blue backdrop. The President himself looked the same as well, thick brown hair with hints of grey brushed neatly back and dark blue eyes crinkled in a supposedly friendly grin.

As it was Harry’s second time being summoned over incidents involving magic exposure though, Harry wasn’t quite so brought in by the smile.

“Afternoon,” Tony said, shaking the President’s hand and then taking one of the three chairs that were across from his desk. Sirius dragged away the chair in the middle, leaving space for Harry to wheel up and briefly accept the handshake from the President.

“I heard you were recently injured, I wasn’t aware that it was a permanent injury,” the President said after shaking Sirius’ hand and resuming his seat. Harry was probably imagining it, but for just a second it looked like the President actually seemed bothered by Harry’s injury.

“Nothing more permanent than cutting off a leg,” Harry said flatly. He went ahead and took the cloak off, tucking it securely beside him, and then met the President’s eyes square on. “You don’t know if…?” Harry trailed off, hardly daring to hope that the American wizard president would know of something that McGonagall and Dumbledore didn’t.

“I do not,” Quahog said, clearly understanding Harry’s non-question. Harry knew it was coming really, but it was a blow nonetheless. Quahog looked at Tony and raised a brow. “I presume you have consulted with both magical and no-maj healers?”

“Some of both,” Tony said. He sat back and crossed one ankle over the other knee. “Stephen Strange had to do the amputation after James Barnes kidnapped Harry and left him in a foreign country with a destabilizing and infected injury.”

Quahog inclined his head briefly before tapping his desk with his wand and silently causing four white mugs, a tea kettle, and coffee pot to appear.

“Help yourself, gentlemen,” Quahog said, waving his hand airily. “Where can I find James Barnes?” he asked, looking between Tony and Sirius.

“St. Mungo’s,” Sirius supplied helpfully. He poured Harry a cup of coffee and Harry took it more to have something to do with his hands than anything. “He’s still in the Janus Thickey Ward.”

“Ah.” Quahog grabbed a perfectly ordinary ink pen from a desk drawer and made a note on a remote legal pad. “Have they indicated a date for his release?”

“No,” Sirius said.

“I will send the appropriate documentation to Minister Fudge and St. Mungo’s, but I’m afraid the British government is rather clever when they want to be,” Quahog said wryly. His eyes hovered on Sirius for a moment, “Nothing I need to tell you, I’m sure.”

“Documentation for what?” Tony asked, asking the same thing Harry wanted to know.

Quahog seemed surprised by Tony’s question, as if the answer should be obvious. “He committed a crime against a magical child on US soil,” Quahog said slowly. “He will be extradited here to stand trial once he’s released from hospital care.”

“What?” Harry blurted. The coffee cup shook in his hands and Harry carefully placed it on the desk before tucking his hands away. “You’re charging Bucky?”

“I apologize, Mister Stark, I presumed this would be rather clear,” Quahog said to Harry. “The indictment was approved the day that the Amber Alert was issued.”

“But he killed Voldemort?” Harry said. His heart was hammering and he wasn’t sure why, but it seemed like nobody in Britain had really cared too much Harry had been collateral damage in Bucky’s decision to kill Voldemort.

“And in doing so he committed multiple crimes against a magical minor in the United States,” Quahog said. “The ends do not justify the means, Mister Stark.”

“Hear, hear,” Tony said. He raised his cup of coffee to the President while Harry stared down at his own lap, trying to sort out his suddenly tangled thoughts.

Harry let the conversation happening become nothing more than a buzzing background sound…

It wasn’t that it was a big deal, not really, but Harry was sure that people committed crimes against him all the time.

It probably wasn’t legal to make a kid live in a glorified closet for ten years. And Harry didn’t know the law very well, but he was sure that refusing to feed your nephew and hitting him when the fancy struck were some sort of crimes…

Attempted murder on behalf of a man on the back of your head was definitely a crime, but Harry supposed Quirrell had died…

Lockhart had nearly, at a minimum, committed a crime when he tried to obliviate Harry and Ron in the Chamber of Secrets… but perhaps he couldn’t be in any sort of legal trouble because of his own backfired spell.

Sirius had definitely committed a crime when he broke Ron’s leg, but Sirius had twelve years worth of time in Azkaban to make up for his crimes.

Everything about the Goblet of Fire fiasco had to be illegal, along with the endless articles attacking Harry last year… and Snape threatening to dose Harry with Veritaserum should be a crime, if it wasn’t already. Barty-as-Moody tried to kill Harry, not that the Minister had believed him. Pettigrew had tied Harry to a tombstone and cut his arm so deeply that Harry would always have the scar…

And crucio was meant to be an unforgivable, so why had Harry been at the receiving end of it three times in a night while people just watched?

Nobody ever sat back and said: “Hey, that’s illegal.”

Nobody ever faced any sort of legal action for what they did.

Quirrell was dead, Lockhart was a permanent hospital patient, Barty lost his soul, Pettigrew was murdered, and Voldemort was murdered.

But they were charging Bucky…

Harry cleared his throat and noticed at once that buzzing had ended and he was on the receiving end of three men’s gazes.

“What?” Harry said stupidly as he shook away his thoughts that kept circling around - “the ends don’t justify the means” - and looked toward his dad. “I didn’t hear you.”

It was Sirius that answered though, sounding as thrilled as could be.

“I get to be the first publicly acknowledged wizard in history,” he said, his grey eyes gleaming with so much self-satisfaction that Harry could see his resemblance to Draco for the first time.

“It’s a soft launch of magic in the US,” Tony said thoughtfully, filling in the blanks for Harry. “All my fault, of course, for letting Sirius join the team.”

“It will be an exercise in seeing if no-maj’s have evolved from the days of the Witch Hunts,” Quahog said. “My question, Mister Stark, was if you would like to join your godfather in this excursion?”

“What? Tell the world I’m a wizard?” Harry laughed bitterly and shook his head. “No thanks, I’m enough of a freak in this chair.”

The President raised a brow at Harry’s choice of words, but pushed anyway.

“You’re quite certain?” he asked Harry. “Stephen Strange will be accompanying Mister Black on this release. If it goes well, I imagine that your grandchildren will have freedom to be themselves openly in America.”

“Sirius and Strange can be your poster boys, I’ve got no interest,” Harry said flatly, refusing to budge on the stance.

“That’s that then,” Tony cut in swiftly. “If there’s nothing else, we have another appointment we have to get to.”

“If Mister Black wouldn’t mind giving me another hour of his time?” Quahog asked, eyeing Sirius thoughtfully. “As most of the world has already been exposed to his powers, we have a publicist who would like to go over some interview opportunities and public releases.”

“Sounds good to me,” Sirius said. He leaned back in his chair and grinned at Harry. “You sure you don’t want to triple your fame, kiddo?” he said, hopefully a joke.

“About as much as I want to lose my right leg,” Harry said. He backed up from the desk and waited for Tony to shake the president’s hand again before offering a polite goodbye and leaving.

The secretary was still at her desk when they left, but a harsh look from Harry kept her eyes off his chair.

“That was fun,” Tony said when the two of them stepped outside. Harry blinked at the brightness of the sun that was peeking through snow clouds and light snowfall.

“Depends on your definition,” Harry said quietly. He was able to slide himself from his chair to the car again, a real accomplishment so nobody was trying to pick Harry up like an infant anymore. Harry checked the time and saw that they still had an hour before he had to go see Michael.

“You hungry?” Tony asked after he climbed in with Harry and Happy started the car. “We’ve got time for a bite to eat.”

“I’m fine,” Harry said. He wasn’t fine, necessarily, but he wasn’t hungry either.

Tony studied Harry behind his glasses for a moment. “What’s bugging you?” he finally asked. “I know you and Barnes were something like horribly inappropriate friends, but surely that’s over?”

Harry scoffed. It was over about the time Bucky stabbed Peter. Harry knew that Bucky was sick, he needed help more than anyone Harry ever knew, but Harry barely forgave Sirius for breaking Ron’s leg, he sure as hell wasn’t going to get over Bucky stabbing Peter or killing Tony’s parents anytime soon.

“I dunno,” Harry admitted. “It’s just…” Harry ran his hand through his hair, messing it up and causing it to stand wildly on end in some places. “I dunno,” he repeated, unable to find the words he wanted.

It was just… it was… it was painful, somehow?, to be treated like someone who had been wronged. Harry didn’t have a lot of pity parties, but other people had them even less for him. Which was fine, Harry was fine, he was always fine, but…

“It’s weird, that Quahog is charging Bucky,” Harry said slowly, blinking at the back of the seat in front of him as he tried to vocalize his issue. “People don’t usually…”

“Care?” Tony suggested. “Yeah, it’s weird when people start caring about you, isn’t it?”

“Yeah,” Harry echoed. He inched closer on the seat to Tony and hesitantly laid his head on Tony’s shoulder, only mildly worried he’d be pushed away. “It’s weird.”

Chapter Text

Saturday, December 10

Taylor Anderson stopped just outside the doors of the New York VA Town Hall. Technically, it was called a community center, but as the wide and sprawling red brick building was home to admin, a health clinic, dorms set up to mimic the barracks they were all used to, a gym, meeting rooms, and a decent sized cafeteria that served lunch during the week, Taylor called it a Town Hall. There was a little bit of everything there and it was as good as a second home to him.

Actually, considering he slept there more often than he did his own ‘home’, maybe he should call it his first home.

Taylor shook off his thoughts of the slum of an apartment he rented off his disability check and hobbled his way inside, nodding politely to the Private that jumped in full uniform to open the door for him.

The inside of the Town Hall reminded Taylor of his old high school, and hell the place probably used to be a high school. There was probably some foundation shift or mold in the walls or something that made it unsuitable for students to inhabit but perfect for veterans.

Sometimes Taylor wondered if veterans got the short end of the stick on purpose or if it was all a happy coincidence.

Private First Class Amos, one of the guy’s in Taylor’s unit back at Fort Benning when he’d been going through AIT, had his own opinion about it all.

“Have you noticed that the majority of enlisted US soldiers are minorities?” he’d say while they ran laps together. “The benefits offered to enlist are all ones that are targeted to low income individuals too. Free college, sign on bonus, see the world? Those are dreams for poor kids.”

“I grew up poor and I’m white as fuckin’ bread,” Taylor pointed out.

“It’s the cycle of systematic poverty, man. Offer these ghetto kids all these amazing experiences, use them as canon fodder in the wars- acceptable loss to the supposed melting pot of a country -and if they survive, then they get the shittiest care in the country.”

That was before Iraq, that was before their base was infiltrated and hostile fire began.

That was before Amos bled out, died alone in a foxhole, and nobody found his body until he had to be identified by his tags.

Taylor noticed then the injustice and disparities in the military and being a soldier lost some of its shine for him. By the time he lost his leg, thanks to the helicopter crash and half-ass medical care, Taylor hadn’t expected Uncle Sam to care for one broken body and he hadn’t been disappointed.

The doctors called it an eighty percent disability and crunched the numbers until they discharged Anderson from the service with a monthly check for a little under two grand and a meaningless ‘atta boy’.

‘Atta boy, thanks for believing in our cause.’

‘Atta boy, thanks for signing up right out of high school.’

‘Atta boy, thanks for your dedication and service and the blood, tears, and sweat you shed in foreign soil.’

‘Atta boy, good luck with the disability and PTSD and the fact that you left part of your soul in Iraq with your leg.’

Damn was it disrespectful, but Anderson only had one place where Uncle Sam could shove his ‘atta boy’ and it wasn’t pretty.

Hobbling his way through the building, his crutches clacking and echoing in the halls, Anderson worked toward the meeting room they always used for Saturday mornings. It was a small group, only eleven regulars, but Wilson always brought donuts and coffee and Taylor was starving.

It had been a long night of tossing and turning, eyeing the prescription bottle of narcotics and forcing himself to ignore their call.

Taylor’s on and off again girl, Amy, said he was an idiot not to take the pills, but Taylor saw too many vets strung out and in worse shape than he was. Pain killers for a head full of PTSD was a slippery slope and Taylor was barely walking as it was.

“Hey, man.” Wilson was waiting inside the double doors of the meeting room and flashed a white smile at Anderson when he made it inside. “There’s a hell of a layout over on the table, help yourself, looks like there’s plenty.”

Taylor sniffed and then caught sight of the tables of food.

“God damn.” Taylor had never seen so much food in the meeting room before in his life. “Whose dick did you have to suck for this?”

Wilson laughed loudly, the sound filling the room and mixing with laughter from others. There wasn’t much to make a room full of disabled soldiers to laugh, but apparently a shit ton of food was a good way to start.

“It’s from Stark,” Wilson told him. “Tell the others to cool it with the crudeness, alright? We’ve got a kid coming today.”

“You convinced little Stark to come?” Taylor asked, surprised. He’d been ragging on the kid for weeks to join their group and he got shut down every time. Not to mention that little Stark had a nasty mouth of his own to go toe-to-toe with Taylor on his worst day.

“Nah, I convinced Tony to come and he text me this morning and said that he was bringing Harry.”

Taylor’s lips curled to the side in a crooked smile and he shook his head at Wilson. “Bribery or blackmail?” he wondered aloud.

“Knowing Tony it’s probably some of both,” Wilson laughed again. He checked his watch and then waved Taylor to join the other vultures swarming the food. “Grab some chow, tell everyone to cool it with the dick sucking shit and let’s pretend to be adults for a while, alright?”

“Yeah, we’ll see,” Taylor grinned. He did his hopping shuffle off toward the others that were there for group and his mouth was drooling at the full spread breakfast buffet that was set out for them.

Fuck God, Taylor was thanking Stark for his daily meal.

“Can you believe this shit?” Sanchez turned and grinned at Taylor when he joined them. He waved his left arm, what was left of it, toward the eggs and sausages, bacon and waffles. “What CSM took pity on us poor cripples today, you think?”

“Apparently it was Tony fuckin’ Stark,” Taylor said. He nudged Jones to the side with a playful shrug. “C’mon, Private, make room for your elders.”

“Oh, fuck off, Anderson,” Jones quipped. He aimed one of his forearm crutches at Taylor and pretended to take a knee shot. “And why would Tony Stark be buying us breakfast?”

“His kid’s one of us,” Godwin said. She had her prosthetics on both arms, clicking the metal ends of them together menacingly until Greene moved his wheelchair so she could grab some food. “Do none of you morons watch the fucking news?”

“Why would we watch the news when you’re here to tell us about it, Sarg?” Lawrence grinned. His ass was leaning against the wall so he could shovel down what looked like a dozen waffles in a single go. “I didn’t even know Stark had a kid.”

“I told you about him, dumbass,” Taylor reminded him, rolling his eyes. He nodded gratefully when Stokes used his left hand to help him load up his plate. “Fifteen, skinny, smartass? Left-sided above knee amputation? Ringing a bell?”

“Ooh,” Lawrence nodded as he remembered. “Fuck yeah, he can join the club.”

“The crips,” Simmons snickered. She threw up some dumbass gang sign with her right hand before helping Greene load up a plate.

“Poor kid,” Mendez said, saying what they were all thinking. “Fifteen’s a hell of an age to lose a leg.”

“Nah,” Lawrence laughed again. “I wish I’d lost my leg when I was fifteen, the pity pussy alone.”

“Gross!” Booker squealed. She grabbed a sausage link from the platter and threw it at Lawrence’s head. “Don’t ever say that shit again.”

“Yes, Private Booker!” Lawrence boomed, giving Booker a sharp salute and a wink. “Don’t mean it don’t work though.”

“Wilson said to watch your mouths while the kid’s here,” Taylor warned them all. “No need to have Iron Man on the news claiming his precious boy was dirtied up by the crippled vets.”

“Man, Iron Man says worse shit all the time,” Greene said. He started backing his chair away from the table, his lap covered in a plate overflowing with food. “We can’t say shit that kid doesn’t hear at home anyway.”

“He’s got a point,” Taylor agreed. He finished loading up his plate and began a careful shuffle to the regular circle of chairs in the middle of the room. Little Stark had a dirty mouth and anyone with a brain knew of Big Stark’s sordid history.

Taylor kind of doubted if they’d scare off Little Stark with their dirty jokes, it was all the missing limbs that would send the kid running.

Everyone slowly filtered over to the chairs, each of them with food for themselves and laughter and jokes being tossed about. By the time Taylor finished eating, he finally saw Little Stark wheeling himself in the room in his high tech red and gold wheelchair.

“Let’s hear it for our hero,” Greene announced from his chair when Tony Stark himself stepped in the room, followed closely by Wilson. “If you’ve got two hands, put them together for Stark!”

There were a lot of good natured cheers and claps, a few whistles from those that couldn’t clap, and Taylor winked at Little Stark when he looked surprised by their group.

“If I knew food would get me a standing ovation then I’d deliver it every week,” Big Stark said with an easy smile. “Anyone leave any coffee?”

Taylor nodded his head to the open space beside him when the kid seemed unsure of what to do once his dad wandered off with Wilson to grab coffee.

“Hey, kid, welcome to the crip club,” Taylor said. He waited until Harry was beside him to start the round of introductions. “Hey, dumbasses, this is Harry, left sided-AKA.”

“Hey, welcome.” Jones reached over and shook Harry’s hand with a grin. “Private Jones, right sided-BKA.”

The others went around their circle introducing themselves and Harry full on twitched when Godwin introduced herself by waving her prosthetic hands.

“I- I shouldn’t be here…” Harry said, looking anxious as fuck. He was twisting his fingers around on his lap, his eyes flicking uneasily from each of them, lingering on their boot merch and tattoos and dog tags. “I’m sorry. I’m- I can go…”

“Hey.” Taylor quickly stuck a crutch in one of the wheels on Harry’s chair. It wasn’t cool for the kid to feel like he was out of place just because they were the idiots that enlisted. “You should be here,” Taylor told him seriously. “Wars aren’t always on foreign soil, Stark. That stump of yours? That’s all you need to join our fucked up club.”

“Should have tried to lose your arm instead, it’s easier to walk when you’re just missing an arm.” Stokes waved his own stump around, clearly trying to set the kid at ease. “Try and fail better next time.”

There were a few laughs at the old quote every damn Drill Sargent in every basic ever had yelled at them all until they dreamt about it. Harry relaxed though, his fingers quit twisting, so Taylor pulled his crutch out of the wheel.

“How’d daddy convince you to come anyway?” Taylor asked Harry once he was sure the kid wasn’t going to bolt. “I thought you said you’d rather lose your right leg than come here?”

Harry was a fucking riot, in Taylor’s opinion. Taylor knew he’d fit in the first time they met- the kid had a foul mouth, he was jaded as hell, and Taylor didn’t need to be a shrink to see the PTSD that lingered in the kid’s green eyes.

Taylor did a bit of research, and by that he meant he googled the kid’s name, and read a bunch of news articles about the kid. Apparently the kid got kidnapped before he lost his leg, something most news pages loved comparing to his dad being kidnapped back in Afghanistan. Before that though, nobody even know Harry Stark existed until back over the summer.

So Taylor wondered what kind of shit the kid dealt with before he showed up or if all that trauma floating in his crazy brain was from being kidnapped by the Winter fuckin’ Soldier.

Harry was glaring at Taylor then and he glanced toward his dad‘s back and rolled his eyes. “Guilt trip,” Harry told him. “‘I really want to go but I don’t want to go alone- we never spend time together anymore’.”

Taylor and Sanchez laughed at the oldest guilt trip in the world.

“And you fell for it?” Taylor asked Harry. “Man, I thought you were smarter than that.”

“He’s got very sad puppy eyes sometimes,” Harry muttered. He fell quiet when his dad and Wilson came up to the group. Tony Stark fell in a chair beside Harry’s wheelchair and Wilson took his usual spot between Godwin and Mendez.

“Making friends?” Tony asked Harry brightly. He reached across Harry and shook Taylor’s hand. “You must be that ‘bloody prat’ I’ve heard so much about.”

“Yes, sir,” Taylor grinned. “It’s my job to give little Stark here just enough bullshit that he doesn’t start throwing pity parties.”

“Pity parties are the best kind of parties,” Greene said from his own wheelchair. “Get a bottle of vodka, a couple packs of cigarettes, turn the radio up and just throw the best pity party in the world.”

“He’s fifteen,” Wilson said, jumping in with a sharp look at Greene. “Everyone should find a chance to vent their feelings about their new life, but what do we do afterwards?”

“Drink water and hit up a meeting?” Lawrence grinned. It wasn’t actually funny, not coming from Lawrence. That poor son of a bitch had been struggling with alcoholism as long as he’d been struggling to adjust to civilian life without his right leg.

“In a way, yeah,” Wilson said. “You throw your healthy pity party and then you get your ass up and get back to life.”

“What if you can’t exactly get up?” Greene asked as he wiggled his bilateral stumps.

Harry laughed then and then he looked horrified when Greene looked at him. “Shite. I’m sorry,” Harry said, eyes wide. “I just—”

“No need to apologize, we settle our issues with races here,” Greene smirked. “You should have added some flames to your chair with that paint job, Stark, it’s scientifically proven to make you go faster.”

Everyone laughed and Harry relaxed some after glancing toward his dad quickly and then nodding at Greene.

“I’ll remember that when I get crutches,” Harry said seriously.

“Ignore Greene, man,” Simmons told Harry. “He’s a fucking idiot, he left all his brain cells with his legs in Iraq.”

“That’s not fair,” Booker said, “Greene never had any brain cells.”

“Did any of us?” Taylor laughed. “We all enlisted here.”

“Hey, now, some of us made a pretty dime off Uncle Sam’s back,” Godwin said. She clacked her claw hands together then and laughed bitterly. “Then he made quarters off our limbs.”

“Did- were you all…” Harry looked around the circle and cleared his throat. “Were you all in war?”

“That’s a great question,” Wilson said quickly. He leaned his chair back on two legs and looked at Mendez on his right. “Who wants to share their superhero origin story?”

“Not you,” Jones said, tapping Stark’s ankle with his crutch. “We all know you just dreamt up Iron Man in a fucking cave in Afghany.”

“But superhero origin stories are my favorite,” Stark pouted before wiping the look away with clear practice. He winked at his son, and Taylor saw that the kid relaxed some at the look.

That was cool, actually. Harry was a bit of a defensive jerk, Taylor never knew how he actually felt about his dad.

Taylor absolutely wasn’t jealous that Harry Stark had a dad that clearly supported him and was helping him get back on his feet, pun intended.

“I didn’t have any bombs or any cool story to pull the ladies with,” Mendez said, starting the story time. “Man, I was just walking through the damn forest with my battalion and when we stopped, I went to adjust my boot tuck and this damned snake made its way up my pant leg. The little bastard bit me and by the time I made it back to base, my whole fucking leg was red.”

Everyone knew the end of that story- Uncle Sam and his cracker jack camp clinics cost a twenty year old Private his leg then shipped his ass back to the States for a discharge and a disability label.

“From a snake bite?” Harry asked with his eyebrows flying high up on his forehead. “Bloody hell.”

“It’s those foreign snakes, man,” Mendez insisted. “They’ve got something extra in their venom, I swear.”

“Boy, bullshit,” Lawrence laughed. “You just forgot all those safety briefs about snake safety.”

“Nah, I got that down. Wrap it before you tap it, right?”

“Moving on,” Wilson said loudly, shaking his head at Mendez and Lawrence.

Taylor didn’t think either Stark minded, Harry was grinning even with a little redness to his little innocent fifteen year old cheeks and Tony was smirking in a way that only men who got laid a lot could do.

“Anyone else want to share?” Wilson asked, looking pointedly toward Godwin. It was the pain of her rank, if she didn’t want to be expected to be the shining leader of the group, she never should have became Staff Sergeant.

“Routine rounds in the T-54, a tank for you civies,” she told Harry with a wink, “we got hit with hostile fire. The damn tank blew, took my left arm with it and there was shrapnel through my right forearm. So when the medics found me, they flew me to the closest camp and took that arm too.”

Everyone fell quiet for a minute, thinking of their own injuries. Taylor’s had been bad; one minute he’d been in the air, on top of the god damned world, and the next minute a rocket hit the blades of the chopper and he was crashing to the ground.

“ANDERSON! ANDERSON!”

Taylor couldn’t even talk… he thought he’d die under those sheets of burning metal- choking on the flames and the taste of blood in his mouth.

Some days, more days than not, Taylor wished he’d died out there. Dying would have been a hell of a lot less painful than the bullshit life he was leading.

“You good?”

Taylor looked over and saw Harry staring at him with understanding eyes. Which, fuck that, some kid shouldn’t understand the feeling of smoke and flames filling your brain and dragging your ass back to a place that you shouldn’t have been in the first place.

“Fine,” Taylor lied easily. He grinned and waved a hand at Harry. “Let’s hear your story, Trainee.”

“Trainee?” Harry asked, obviously stalling. “What? Am I auditioning to be in your cripple club?”

Taylor wasn’t the only one who laughed his ass off at that. Harry would have fit right in on the field, but he shouldn’t.

Fifteen year old Taylor never would have fit in with a bunch of PTSD-riddled, pissed off at the world, cynical vets.

“Come on, pussy,” Taylor taunted Harry, pushing him then just like he did during physical therapy. “Let’s hear how you tripped on the sidewalk, broke your ankle, and overreacted by having your leg cut off.”

“Oh, piss off,” Harry snapped at him. “I didn’t trip on the fucking sidewalk, I jumped out of a car.”

Taylor chuckled and shook his head at the hothead kid. “That’s worse, you get how that’s worse, right?”

“Says the guy who played pararescue without a chute,” Stokes scoffed.

“Would you animals shut the hell up so we can hear this?” Godwin said, shaking her head at them all. “Go on, Stark, let’s hear about your origin story.”

Harry coughed quietly and Taylor and the others politely pretended not to notice when Tony Stark reached over, easy as fuck all, and wrapped an arm over his son’s shoulders.

Taylor knew he wasn’t the only one who was jealous of that. Sometimes kids with good homes and happy childhoods grew up to enlist, but more often than not it wasn’t the case. Taylor hadn’t seen his own father since the prick beat his mom and had to be taken from the house in handcuffs.

Taylor knew for damn sure that his old man never would have shown up at one of these meetings and wrapped his arm around his shoulder, all supportive and friendly, and helped hold him together long enough to get shit off his chest.

“Some bloke knocked me out, put me in his car, and when I came to I jumped out,” Harry said quickly. He spit it all out like poison. “I broke my leg and when I went to the hospital, they had to cut it off.”

“Bro, what?” Greene was leaning forward, his elbows on his thighs, with his dark eyes locked on Harry. “Who the fuck knocked you out?”

“And how did a broken leg turn to an above knee amputation?” Mendez asked. “You live in the US, my guy, medical care is like top notch for rich white boys.”

“Hey—”

“Oh, piss off,” Harry snapped at Mendez, cutting off Wilson. “I’m not some posh rich kid with the best medical care. I was laying in a motel for bloody days until my leg turned black and I was fucking hallucinating. The whole damn thing rotted off. D’you know what it smells like when your body is rotting off?”

Everyone went still for a beat.

Yeah, most of them did know how that smelled.

“What’d you hallucinate?” Sanchez asked. He held up what was left of his left arm when Simmons threw a piece of egg at his head. “Hey, Private, calm the fuck down, I’m just curious.”

Harry had been all fire for a moment, but he fell quiet then, looking little and meek while he was locked in his thoughts. Everyone gave him a minute, all too used to those thoughts getting so tangled up that they couldn’t keep track of what was real, what was fake.

“My friends,” Harry finally said, blinking quickly to hide the shine in his eyes. “I dunno, I thought I was dying, I guess, so it was easier if my friends were there.”

“It’s never easy to die, even if you’re surrounded by friends.” Greene only said what they were all thinking. How many of them saw their friends die?

How many of them tried to save their friends and instead wound up being delegated to calling their family or delivering their flags?

“You know what’s harder than dying? Living,” Wilson said soberly, like a broken record. A few of the guys nodded, but just as many of them rolled their eyes. Taylor was a nodder, he wanted to start living again.

“You know what’s harder than living?” Booker looked around until she had everyone’s attention. “Walking.”

Wilson rolled his eyes and Simmons muttered ‘speak for yourself’, but Taylor looked over and saw that Harry was laughing his ass off with Booker’s dumb ass.

“Man, you know what’s harder than walking?” Taylor smacked Harry’s foot with his crutch. “Running.”

“But you’re such a success case,” Harry drawled sarcastically once he finished laughing. “Stupid Anderson and his stupid crutches and his stupid showing off.”

“Hey, Anderson, I think he’s calling you stupid,” Stokes said. “You know what you should do? Fight him over it.”

“Cripple wars!” Taylor cried, raising a crutch up in the air. “May the least handicapped win!”

“The kid would kick your ass,” Lawrence said confidently. “He’s got that fancy chair, he’d just run you over.”

“He’d have to catch me first and I’m fast,” Taylor grinned. “You should see Harry on his foot, the kid’s clumsy as fuck.”

“Oi! I did the bloody stairs!” Harry scowled. “I went up and down the damn things!”

“Well let’s get you a Medal of Honor,” Lawrence joked. “Stairs in PT? Damn, kid, you’re making us all look like cowards.”

Harry twitched then, his smile fading and his blood draining. “You lot are heroes,” Harry said quietly. He looked around and must have seen people a lot tougher than they were. “I jumped from a bloody car, like a coward. I ran from a war, like a coward. You- you lot ran toward a fight, I ran from it.”

“Hey, Tony, you bring those prototypes with you?” Wilson asked swiftly, giving Godwin a pointed look. “I’ll help you grab them.”

“Sure,” Tony agreed after a moment of hesitation. He tightened his arm on Harry’s curled up shoulders for a moment before climbing to his feet. “I’ll be back, kid.”

Harry nodded and suddenly looked like a lonely little island when he turned to watch his dad walk out with his head bent toward Wilson, the two of them whispering about something.

“Your turn, Greene,” Godwin said with authority once Harry’s safety blanket was gone. “Tell the kid how you lost your legs.”

Greene fidgeted in his chair, his face coloring with his old shame. “Man, it was some bullshit,” he said. “You heard of the Battle of Umm Qasr? It only lasted four days,” he said when Harry shook his head. “They were open firing on us, and- and other guys holding their spot, and they were fucking dying, my guy. So… so I took off.”

Taylor hadn’t been there, it was before he got to Iraq, but he heard enough about it from the POW’s they got back.

“I took off, feeling like a little bitch, and hid my skinny white ass in a nearby building. And you know what happened? They blew the fucking thing up.”

Harry’s eyes were wide, shocked, and the others were quiet.

How many of them wanted to run? How many of them wanted to hide?

“But if I’d stayed I would have died,” Greene stressed. “So I didn’t get a fucking Purple Heart, and there’s plenty of douche bags that look down their nose at me, but I’m living, man. I ran and they can call me a coward, but I’m alive.”

Harry stared at Greene hard and everyone saw what question was about to come out of his mouth. “Do you want to be?” he asked. “Did you want to live a coward or die a hero?”

“Kid, you fucking listen to me.” Greene pushed his chair closer, staring Harry down hard. “When your life is on the line, when it’s standing in the fire or fleeing, you fucking flee, got it? You do whatever the hell you have to do to live, because you don’t get anymore sunrises or orgasms when you’re dead.”

Harry chewed on his bottom lip for a moment, just staring at Greene and his story and his advice.

“I’m not so great at fleeing anymore, I could try hopping away.”

Taylor laughed hard and he clapped Harry on the shoulder, feeling the little twitch beneath his hand.

“Guy, you fit in here just perfect,” he told Harry. “Just keep coming back and making your dad buy us breakfast and we’ll whip your ass in shape.”

Harry looked over and Taylor imagined there was one less shadow in the back of his eyes when he nodded at him, a hint of a smile curling his lips up in the side.

 

By the time Tony came back with Wilson, their arms filled with metal limbs that were shined to perfection, Harry was trading barbs with the rest of them.

“Who wants a leg?” Tony Stark asked, waving a sparkling silver leg in the air. He zeroed in on Taylor immediately, setting off an explosion of nerves and excitement. “You wanna give it a go, Specialist?”

Taylor hesitated, his chest heaving while his heart lodged somewhere in his throat. That leg… that leg was everything. That leg wasn’t his, but damn if he wouldn’t make it his own. But it was terrifying too, because if it didn’t work then Taylor was just getting his hopes up for nothing.

It was the kid that prompted him to his foot though. The kid just looked over and scoffed at the torn expression on Taylor’s face.

“Go get a leg, pussy,” Harry said with something between an arrogant smirk and an easy grin.

Taylor laughed and shoved himself to his foot, hobbling over to where Tony Stark was setting up shop. “Stark, when I’m running laps on two legs, I’ll give you my crutches.”

“I don’t want your sweaty crutches,” Harry said, curling his nose while his eyes shimmered happily. “I’m a rich white boy, I’ll get my own.”

Man, Taylor didn’t know when, he was a soldier, not a fucking psychic, but that kid was going to be just fine.

Chapter Text

Saturday, December 17

Harry wasn’t nervous, he was… excited? anxious?… he was something that had his leg shaking and his fingers tapping out on the arm of his wheelchair.

Harry had spent his morning down at the VA, hanging out with Anderson, Greene, and the others, just talking and watching them try on the fake limbs Tony made just for them. Tony took their measurements the first time they went and then Harry hardly saw him all week with as much time as he spent in his lab, creating working arms and legs out of metal.

Greene had cried, sobbed really, and held Harry’s arm like a lifeline while Tony fit the fake legs over his kneecaps. The brilliant thing was that a few of the others had cried too, even Godwin, who was waiting patiently for Tony to make her fake arms to replace the two she lost. They all cried with Greene because they’d been happy for him.

Harry didn’t cry, but he’d seen everyone looking like they were happy and miserable and Greene looked like Tony gave him back his entire life.

It was… it was painful.

It was painful that Greene lost both his legs and it was painful to see a group of adults - all younger than Tony, most of them younger than Sirius - crying because of Greene getting something that he never should have lost.

And now Harry was just supposed to go out with Peter… on a date… in his wheelchair…

They’d hung out since Harry hesitantly agreed to restart their relationship, but always in the Tower. Aside from physical therapy and regular therapy, and the two times he went to the VA, Harry hadn’t been out and about much.

If Harry didn’t desperately need to finish Christmas shopping, he still had to find something for Tony, Sirius, and Pepper, then he might not bother. Peter probably would have caved and stayed there, maybe watched a movie or something, but he said he had something ‘freaking amazing’ to show Harry and Harry wasn’t going to ruin it.

Peter text Harry right at five, asking if he would meet him in the lobby.

“I’m leaving,” Harry called to his dad when he wheeled past the lab he was in. The hand he’d made for Simmons didn’t fit right and he wanted to make it more comfortable for her before next week.

Tony poked his head out while Harry waited for the lift and Harry bit back a grin at his appearance. Tony’s hair was as messy as Harry’s usually was, standing up in wild clumps as if he’d been running his fingers through it repeatedly. There were black streaks of grease on his face and it looked like it took Tony a moment to even recognize Harry.

“Oh, date night with Petey?” Tony asked once his eyes focused on Harry. “Have fun,” he said when Harry nodded. “Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.”

Harry paused in the door of the lift, considering that for a moment.

“Is there anything you wouldn’t do?”

Tony grinned and gave Harry a playful salute. “That’s the spirit, kid. I’ll see you later, love you.”

Harry echoed the sentiment back to him and then rolled his eyes when Tony promptly disappeared in the lab.

“Jarvis? Will you make sure he eats?” Harry asked quietly while he rode the lift down to the lobby that wouldn’t be busy on a Saturday.

“Yes, Mister Harry. Shall I disconnect the power to his lab when food arrives?”

Harry grinned at Jarvis’ manipulative scheme. If Tony didn’t want to have a robot tricking him into eating, then he shouldn’t have programmed him that way.

“Yeah, thanks Jarvis,” Harry said. He hesitated for a moment when the lift doors opened, struck by an unfamiliar feeling of fear. It didn’t make sense, not really, but leaving the lift by himself suddenly felt like a monumental decision.

If Harry left the lift and went out with Peter, shopped and laughed and saw whatever it was that Peter was so excited about, it would be before.

Harry’s fingers grasped the bars on the wheels tightly. If Anderson could his fake leg on and have Wilson help him stand up, crying the entire time, then Harry could push himself out there and quit hiding.

He could quit being a coward, if only in this one instance.

It was worth the internal struggle when Harry wheeled out of the lift and the first thing he saw was Peter in the middle of the lobby, bouncing on the balls of his feet, smiling like an idiot.

“Bright Eyes!” Peter somehow smiled even harder when he saw Harry and he came charging over to him. Harry was caught by surprise when he bent down and wrapped a hand behind Harry’s neck and kissed him long and hard right in the center of the room.

“Good day?” Harry asked breathlessly when Peter pulled away, his brown eyes sparkling so brightly.

“Perfect now,” Peter said. “Come on, you’ve gotta see this.”

Harry was eager to see what had Peter in such high spirits and when they made it outside, Harry’s jaw dropped.

“It’s a 2016 Dodge Challenger,” Peter said proudly, running a hand over the glossy hood of the cherry red car that sat in front of the tower. “It’s an SRT, the Hellcat series. She’s got a V8 Hemi engine and it’s a coupe.”

Harry didn’t know what any of that meant, but he knew that car was stunning and looked fast even without moving.

“She?” Harry asked, looking over at Peter with a small grin. “Is this yours?”

“Yes!” Peter said, pulling a key from his pocket and dangling it in the air. “I just bought her today and… and I thought maybe you’d wanna be my first passenger,” he added with just a hint of shyness in his softening smile. “My Aunt May says she’s a death trap, but I swear I’m a good driver.”

“I’ve drove with you before,” Harry reminded him. Harry tried to push away the itch in the leg that didn’t bloody exist at the thought of riding in the beautiful car.

It wasn’t a big deal, not really… but Harry sort of assumed they’d be walking… or having Happy drive.

Happy driving was fine. Tony driving was fine.

Which meant that Peter driving would be fine.

“Where do you want to go first to shop?” Peter asked, hurriedly opening the door for Harry with a playful bow.

Harry looked in the car quickly, seeing nothing but smooth leather seats, a radio system as nice as the ones in Tony’s cars, and red lights that lit up the floors. Harry’s hands shook some as he reached out for the handle at the top of the passenger side and used it to slide himself from the chair to the car, but he did.

It was fine.

“I don’t care,” Harry said absently, looking around the inside of the car, twisting backward to see in the backseat, and then stupidly trying to glance down beneath his own seat. Peter didn’t notice, thankfully, as he was politely folding up Harry’s chair and putting it in the trunk.

By the time Peter climbed in the drivers seat, Harry knew his shirt collar had to be showing proof of the sweat that felt like it was covering his skin, causing it to crawl and shiver.

“We can go to— Harry?” Peter turned the car on, causing the engine to start humming loudly, and Harry dropped his head to his hands, struggling to breathe.

“Woah, hey, you alright? Harry?”

Harry jolted away when Peter’s hand brushed his arm and felt like all the oxygen in the car was gone. Every breath felt like it was coming through a straw and Harry didn’t know which hurt worse in the moment- his left leg or his lungs.

“Everything is going to be fine.”

“Everything is going to be fine.”

“Everything is going to be fine.”

Harry screamed when his car door opened - “You can’t jump from a fucking moving car! Do you have any idea how fast I was driving?!” - and someone yanked him out, holding him tight in their arms.

“I can call your dad or Sirius, or I can take you upstairs?” Warm and familiar hands were holding Harry against a firm chest, one hand cradling his head and the other wrapped around his back. “Shit, Harry? Can you even hear me?”

Harry buried his face down, burrowing hard in a soft crook between a shoulder and neck, and tried to make his lungs work while he held tightly to someone.

There was no pain in his leg because it was broken anymore, it was gone.

There was no car to jump out of, the engine was off and it was quiet aside from someone’s high pitched and wheezing breaths.

Harry wasn’t on his way to Mexico, left for dead, by someone he thought was his friend, he was…

“‘M fine,” Harry said, his voice shaking as much as the rest of his body. He kept his face hidden as hot and heavy embarrassment washed over him and his surroundings slowly creeped back in Harry’s mind.

Peter rubbed his hand on Harry’s back, apparently perfectly willing to sit on the curb in front of the tower while Harry had a ridiculous meltdown.

“I’m sorry,” Harry breathed, finally pulling away and wondering when it got dark out. Harry averted his eyes from Peter’s and tried to scoot over to a more conventional seating arrangement that wasn’t Harry straddling Peter’s lap. Peter didn’t relinquish his hold though and he merely grinned at Harry.

“I’m actually completely comfortable down here,” Peter said lightly, moving his hand a little lower on Harry’s back. “I mean this so seriously, if you ever get tired of that chair and just want to use me as a seat, you should feel free.”

Harry scowled and then tried not to scowl and wound up scooting over anyway with a grimace as he had to adjust his ‘thigh’ (Wilson told Harry to quit calling it a ‘stump’, but as Wilson had two perfectly good legs, Anderson told him he doesn’t get a vote). Harry didn’t know what to say though, so he just sat there silently until Peter scooted closer and slowly linked their fingers together.

“I have anxiety,” Harry blurted, staring at Peter’s car in front of them and willing himself to be honest. Or at least as honest as Harry could bear being, as repayment for Peter not mocking him mercilessly over his little freak out. “Er… my therapist said it’s a bit more than that, but… but that was stupid, and I’m sorry.”

Because, if nothing else, Harry had quite thoroughly ruined the date that Peter was so excited for.

“It’s not stupid,” Peter disagreed immediately. He squeezed Harry’s hand, but Harry refused to look over at him. “So no driving, that’s cool. Luckily, I’ve got an even better way that we can get to dinner.”

Harry couldn’t help looking over quickly, raising a brow in disbelief. “You- you still want to go out?” he asked, thankfully no longer shaking, but definitely sounding too vulnerable for his own liking.

Peter’s mouth opened for a second and Harry didn’t understand the horrified look in his eyes.

“No, shit, sorry, that’s stupid, right? You don’t want to go out now, wow, I’m—”

Harry talked over him once he realized what Peter was getting at and the two of them seemed to just talk at one another for a minute.

“No, I’m sorry, I figured you’d be freaked out and—”

“—probably upset and want to just stay inside, watch a movie—”

“—trying to ruin it, like usual, I’m bloody—”

Peter suddenly snapped his mouth shut and Harry trailed off awkwardly and the two of them stared at each other right in the front of the tower. Then Peter’s upper lip twitched and Harry’s nose crinkled and somehow Harry wound up letting loose a snicker that grew to a laugh that became full blown hysterics once Peter started laughing his arse off as well.

By the time they were done laughing, Peter was the one half in Harry’s lap, his head on Harry’s shoulder and his legs tossed across Harry’s thighs.

“Do you wanna go inside and order pizza?” Peter offered with an easy smile, seeming as if he wouldn’t mind if that was exactly what Harry wanted. “Or…”

“Or?” Harry asked, curious about the lilt of excitement in Peter’s voice.

“Or, if you trust me, we can grab fast food and I can take you to my favorite spot,” Peter said with a shrug. “No car required.”

“Okay,” Harry agreed quickly. He did want to spend time with Peter, especially with Harry’s friends coming soon and taking up his time, but he also very desperately didn’t want to get back in that car.

“I- I do like your car,” Harry said hesitantly when Peter detached himself from Harry and jumped to his feet. “It’s pretty.”

“Pft, I know,” Peter scoffed with a teasing wink. “She cost me a fortune, she better be beautiful.” Peter reached down for Harry’s hands with both of his outstretched. “Trust me?”

Harry didn’t hesitate, “Yeah.”

Peter grabbed Harry’s hands and pulled him to his foot, not even letting Harry wobble at all, and then winked before he just… just lifted Harry up and easily flipped him around, adjusting Harry on his back like a backpack in an instant.

“Comfy?” Peter asked, turning his head to grin at Harry’s very hot face.

“Show off,” Harry muttered. He put his chin on Peter’s shoulder. “Are you trying to remind me what walking feels like?”

Peter laughed, never bothered by what Hermione called his ‘morbid sense of humor’. “Nope. I’m going to remind you what flying feels like.”

Against his will, Harry’s lips curled up in a smile and he impulsively turned his head just enough to press that smile in the soft part of Peter’s neck.

More than walking, Harry missed flying.

And flying with Peter - more of some sort of mix of acrobatics and swinging - was brilliant.

“Aren’t you worried you’ll be seen?” Harry shouted over Peter’s laughter when they were making their way above the city, getting to see the lights blur beneath them as they swung through the sky.

“Nope,” Peter yelled back. “I told Gwen and Aunt May. I’m grounded, forever, but I think she’ll get over it soon.”

“Does she know you’re here?” Harry asked curiously.

“Nope.”

 

Harry was still laughing when Peter took Harry to the top of the same building they’d been on when Harry kissed ‘Spider-Bloke’.

“This is your favorite place?” Harry asked, sliding off Peter’s back and sitting on the rooftop, far enough away from the ledge that it didn’t look too tempting.

“Sure is,” Peter agreed. He sat down next to Harry and then twisted around until he could lay his head in Harry’s lap and stare up at him. “The view’s pretty.”

Harry raised a brow, the view was pretty, but Peter wasn’t even looking out at the skyline. “It’s hard to see from there, isn’t it?”

“Nope, I can see just fine.” Peter reached up and cupped Harry’s cheek with his hand, his face so wistful and cute. “It’s a good view.”

“You’re daft,” Harry smiled fondly down at him. “And a bloody sap, when did that happen?”

Peter dropped his hand and closed his eyes for a moment, his nose all scrunched up as he thought.

“I just…” Peter opened his eyes up and looked at the sky, the sky that didn’t show a single star with as bright as the city always was. “People die, Harry,” he said quietly. “They die and bad shit just happens, you know? So… I don’t know, I sound stupid, huh? I just don’t—”

“Don’t want to leave something unsaid,” Harry said, understanding perfectly. “I- yeah, I get that.” Harry tentatively put a hand on Peter’s head, his fingers curling more confidently in his hair when Peter closed his eyes and made a sound of contentment.

Harry had been driven by that same desperate feeling when Tony and Sirius had been fighting Ultron over the telly while Harry didn’t know if either of them would make it home. And he felt it again when he was in that motel, doubting he’d make it home, imagining almost all the people he wanted to say goodbye to.

“If you die tomorrow, I want you to know that I think you’re a prat,” Harry said seriously. He smirked when Peter opened his eyes and gave a dramatic gasp of indignation. “And… er… thanks for- for everything,” Harry tacked on quickly, stumbling over his words as he tried to speak genuinely.

“You have such a way with words,” Peter sighed as he fluttered his lashes coyly. “You should write Hallmark cards, you know. ‘Roses are red, violets are blue, I suppose I bloody tolerate you’.”

“That is romantic!” Harry cried, defending himself. “I’m not good with words, I’m better with—”

“Your hands?” Peter asked suggestively with a waggle of his eyebrows.

“My hands aren’t as good as my foot,” Harry said with an innocent smile. “You should see me hopping around with Anderson, you’d really think I’m charming then.”

It was easier to laugh about the way Harry wobbled and leaned in physical therapy when that was all that the others did at the VA. The ‘legs’, as they had divided the group in legs and arms during their session that morning, all laughed their arses off together when the arms tried hopping around the room to ‘put themselves in their shoe’.

Peter’s look softened then and he searched Harry’s face for a moment. “You seem… better,” he said slowly. “Do you feel better?”

“I mean I just had a whole panic attack because I couldn’t ride in your car,” Harry said drily, still humiliated by that.

Peter grinned, “Aside from the fact that you just hate my new ride.”

Harry thought about it all and he shrugged. “I dunno. I guess talking about it helps and- and Anderson and the others help too, you know? I mean, er… nobody would say he’s less of a man, you know? And Godwin has a baby even though she doesn’t have arms… so, I dunno.”

“So better-ish,” Peter said. He grinned and his eyes crinkled up at the corners. “Am I allowed to say I love you yet?”

“No,” Harry said immediately, his pulse thrumming quickly at that. Harry looked away from Peter and shook his head. “Don’t say that.”

“Hey, Harry?”

“What?”

“I like you.”

Harry let out a huff of a laugh and looked down at Peter’s serious face and sparkling eyes.

“I like you too… prat.”

Chapter Text

Saturday, December 17

Sirius looked around the table in his flat and grinned at his team.

Tony was absolutely barking mad for letting Sirius take over his and Steve’s prior roles as leader of the Avengers, but Sirius wasn’t going to say a single word of complaint.

Natasha and Clint though, they looked pissed as hell and it was only serving to increase Sirius’ glee at the whole situation.

Sirius swung his legs up on the table, nearly knocking over Pietro’s morning cup of coffee, and beamed at the others that were gathered.

“Good morning, my team,” he said. “How’d everyone sleep?”

“It’s noon,” Natasha said drily.

“And we’re not your team,” Clint added.

“Mm, Tony says it’s my team,” Sirius corrected them with a bright smile.

“And Tony does pay for our food and lodging,” Pietro added with a smirk. “So I believe that it is now Sirius’ team, yes?”

“Alright, alright, we get it,” Bruce said with a tired chuckle. Sirius knew nobody was really upset about the new leadership of the team, Clint threw a ‘congrats on taking our friend’s role’ party just the other night; it was just fun to pick at them.

“What are we doing here?” Bruce asked Sirius. “Is this about those soul-pieces?”

“Soul pieces?” Natasha asked, straightening up and looking at Sirius sharply. “What soul pieces?”

“Maybe if you’d been here when Albus came by then you’d know,” Sirius grinned. When Natasha looked prepared to stab Sirius in the eye, he rolled his eyes and took his feet off the table, attempting to be serious.

“Voldemort is bad wizard, Barnes killed bad wizard, but bad wizard divided his soul so he can’t actually die until we destroy the bloody things.” Sirius smirked at Natasha and added a wink for good measure, “Small enough words for you, love?”

“Oh, Sirius, everything you have for me is small,” Natasha said coyly, batting her lashes while Clint snorted in laughter. Sirius threw his head back and laughed while even Bruce snickered at the easy banter Natasha was so good at.

“Meetings with Steve were a lot shorter,” Clint pointed out as they had once more gotten sidetracked.

“Less effective though,” Sirius countered. He grabbed the sword and diary that Albus gave him from his bag and plopped them on the table. “Gentlemen and Lady, this is our only current mission of importance,” he said. “No pressure, but pretty much all of wizardkind depends on us not faffing about and getting this done.”

And since Sirius was being trusted by Albus to complete the mission and by MACUSA to be a role model as the first known wizard…

It was a lot of pressure, truthfully.

There were a lot of people depending on Sirius to not fuck it up and Sirius had a long history of always fucking things up.

Sirius told James to use Peter as secret-keeper.

Sirius went after Peter instead of taking Harry with him.

Sirius brought Barnes to the Tower and introduced him to his godson.

The only good choice Sirius had made in his life was sending Harry to New York, and even that had consequences.

Sirius took a few minutes to explain the idea of horcruxes to the others, feeling vaguely nauseated as he did.

“Albus thinks there’s seven of them,” Sirius finished up with. “This diary was one, so there’s likely six more somewhere.”

“So we’re looking in the entire world for six more diaries that may or may not have the soul of a wizard inside them?” Bruce asked bluntly.

“They won’t all be diaries,” Sirius explained patiently. “Albus thinks they’d be trophies, important shite.”

“How is that book important?” Natasha asked. She had her arms crossed and a thoughtful expression on her pretty face. “I thought serial killers used trophies from their victims?”

Sirius almost wished Albus was there to explain it better because he felt like he was doing it all wrong.

“It’s more like… trophies that made little Tom Riddle feel important,” Sirius said slowly. He tapped the diary that Harry destroyed with his index finger. “He wrote in this when he was a teenager and made himself feel important through his parentage.”

Which was such a load of rubbish that Sirius wanted to scoff. That was the sort of thinking that his parents and brother had prescribed to.

“This is going to be a nightmare,” Bruce sighed. He pushed his glasses up on his forehead to rub at his eyes. “Albus has no idea what these could be?”

“They’ll have a tie to the magical world and will be somewhere of importance to Riddle,” Sirius shrugged. He knew it was nearly impossible, but it was his first real mission as the leader of the Avengers and as the first wizard known by muggles. It was an impossible mission and Sirius could not bugger it up.

Pietro nudged Sirius’ leg under the table and gave him a nod and a reassuring wink.

“We will figure it out,” Pietro drawled. “I have the upmost confidence in our abilities.”

Which made one of them.

“Do you have any sort of magical voodoo to make this any easier?” Natasha asked Sirius.

“Yeah!” Clint sat up straight and pointed at Sirius with an eager light in his eyes. “Okay, when you crashed Harry’s party—”

“Showed up a little late to my godson’s birthday, go on,” Sirius corrected him with a smirk.

Clint rolled his eyes. “Sure, whatever helps you sleep. But you said that the wizard could find the kid—”

“Who is also a wizard,” Pietro murmured with his own cocky smirk.

“Shut the fuck up,” Clint said, wadding up a paper ball and throwing it at Pietro who probably could have dodged it even without his enhanced speed.

“AS I WAS SAYING,” Clint said loudly, refocusing on Sirius. “Isn’t there some magic potion you can make to find these? Like the one that was used to find Harry back in July?”

“The one you didn’t have time to make when Harry was missing recently?” Natasha added.

“That’s for tracking people,” Sirius stressed. “Not… not souls.”

“What about Stephen?” Bruce asked. “Couldn’t he—”

Before Sirius could even explain that he’d seen enough of Stephen Strange the day before when they held a joint conference on the release of magic, a bloody portal opened up just beside Sirius.

“I see we’re finally at the only part of this little meeting that interests me,” Strange said with a smirk as he stepped neatly through the portal. When his eyes landed on the chair to Sirius’ left, Sirius turned and put his feet in it.

Strange was an arrogant, conceited, bastard with his ‘I went to another country and learned magic’ rubbish. It didn’t help that the git was the one who saved Harry and then led the surgery that kept him from dying.

Strange was brilliant and handsome and confident.

Strange was everything that Sirius used to dream about being.

Sirius hated him and he was half in love with the bloody berk and Strange knew it too.

“Quit playing hard to get,” Strange said with a roll of his eyes as he easily pushed Sirius’ feet off the chair.

“Quit being hard to want,” Sirius replied with a sneer.

“I wish the two of you would just fuck and quit this dance,” Pietro scoffed. He was gone in a flash then back just as fast with a bottle of whisky and a stack of glass tumblers.

“Sirius says the stars don’t see it lining up,” Strange said mockingly when Pietro passed him a glass. Sirius stuck his hand out quickly and intercepted it. As Sirius threw it back, his face burned some to see the curious looks from Clint, Natasha, and Bruce.

It was daft, really. Strange had cornered Sirius after their meeting with President Quahog and asked Sirius to dinner. Sirius would have been interested enough, for the company if nothing else, but then Strange ruined it.

“I’ve seen the future you know,” he said with a too charming smirk. “You and I? We’re inevitable.”

“Yeah?” Sirius said, scoffing at the arrogance. Sirius was never one to fall for arrogance, it reminded him too much of his family. Confidence was sexy, arrogance was a quick turn off. “I can see some of the future too and the stars say you’re destined to be alone.”

And so was Sirius, but he was insulting Strange at the time. It had been an outright lie anyway, Sirius hadn’t read the stars since the night they predicted a ‘great tragedy’ when he’d been twenty and he ignored it.

James died the next night.

“Ignore my future better half,” Strange said with a pleasant smile at the team. “We’re having a domestic dispute.”

“I’ll show you domestic dispute,” Sirius muttered before clearing his throat. “Are you here to help or be a pain?” he asked Strange.

“Both, probably,” Pietro whispered to Sirius while he gave everyone else a drink.

“Another thing Steve didn’t do,” Clint grinned widely before he downed the drink.

“A vast improvement then,” Pietro responded sagely.

“Business, please,” Bruce sighed. He passed on the drink and Natasha had no problem snagging it for herself.

For such a thin woman, Natasha could really drink. She claimed it was the Russian in her, Sirius figured it was just her love of making men look weak.

“I am here to tell you all that you’re completely unnecessary,” Strange declared, pointing at everyone except Sirius. “So if you would all like to leave, please, feel free. Sirius and I are more than capable of retrieving the majority of the horcruxes ourselves.”

Sirius sat up and bristled at Strange just inviting himself to their meeting and then dismissing the team without his input. “Oi! Where do you get off?”

Strange raised his brows and licked his lips slowly while holding steady eye contact with Sirius.

“Your bed, preferably,” he said, causing Pietro to sputter on his drink. “But if you insist on us cleaning up the soul pieces of Tom Riddle first, I’m not picky about where we go after.”

Sirius scowled harshly at Strange, oddly embarrassed by his witty tongue. It was usually Sirius who turned innocent statements into innuendos and he didn’t appreciate his own habits being used against him.

“Yup, we’re out of here then!” Clint declared happily. He and Natasha jumped to their feet and left the flat through the exit for the stairs before Sirius could stop them.

“You two seem to have it in hand…” Bruce said slowly with an amused lilt to his voice. He gathered up the papers that Sirius had painstakingly made that outlined the horcruxes and shot him a smile. “Good luck, you know where I’ll be if you need me.”

Sirius wondered if Tony ever struggled with loyalty of the team when he’d been in charge of it. When Sirius turned to Pietro to thank him for sticking around, he was gone as well.

“It looks like it’s just us,” Strange said. He stood up and stretched his arms out in front of him and then offered Sirius his hand. “Shall we?”

Sirius crossed his arms petulantly. “Do you even know what we’re looking for?”

“Not only do I know what we need, but I know where they are as well,” Strange smirked. “Come along, Wizard, let me teach you some tricks.”

It wasn’t as if Sirius had much of a choice, loathe as he was to admit it.

 

As soon as they stepped out of the portal that Strange swore required skin on skin contact for Sirius to travel through, Sirius gasped.

“Where the fuck are we?” he asked as he stared around at piles of galleons, shelves covered in treasures, and books so old they could be ancient.

“Bellatrix Lestrange’s vault,” Strange said nonchalantly. He grabbed Sirius’ wrist when he reached for a golden necklace on the shelf just beside him.

“I wouldn’t,” Strange warned him. “It seems like it will multiply with burning and worthless copies since you aren’t the owner.”

“Close enough,” Sirius said. He shook his head at Strange’s curious look. “Nevermind, so we’ve broken in Gringotts,” which was actually bloody brilliant, “what are we fetching?”

“That.” Strange pointed at a golden cup sitting on top of a stack of galleons. It was beautiful with the Hufflepuff crest engraved on the front and Sirius could smell the dark magic pouring off it in heady waves.

“I’ll send it back to your place and we’ll destroy it later,” Strange said. He twirled his finger and Sirius watched with no small amount of jealousy as a portal opened up and swallowed the goblet whole.

“Five to go,” Strange said with a smirk, as if he knew that Sirius was unwillingly impressed. “Want to swipe anything for yourself? Proof that you managed to break in the bank?”

Actually… that was something to brag about. The goblins were positively mad, there had only ever been one person who managed to break in before and that had been Voldemort.

Sirius let Strange take his hand before quickly reaching out and stealing the golden necklace that had the Black family crest on it.

It was hideous and Sirius had no use for it, but maybe Harry would want it for his kids one day.

 

The next time Sirius stepped out of a portal was as different to the vault as day to night.

“Why the hell would someone hide their soul in this place?” Sirius asked with a sneer. The house, shack was a better term, that stood in front of them was old, molded, and nearly overtaken with weeds and snow.

“I don’t pick the hiding places, I just steal the contents inside of them,” Strange said airily. He released Sirius’ hand long enough to draw a circle in the air before them and open another portal.

Sirius squinted through the gold sparks and saw a box float up from a hole in the rotting floorboards. It opened slowly and a ring came from the box, one with a large black stone and engraving on it. Sirius didn’t so much as blink before it disappeared as well.

“That’s two,” Strange said. He raised an eyebrow at Sirius and there was a glimmer of mischief in his deep brown eyes. “When will you admit that you’re incredibly impressed?”

“When I’m in hell, I suspect,” Sirius deadpanned. He sighed when Strange was quick to reclaim his hand. “Where to now?”

“Oh you’ll like this one,” Strange said cheerfully. “Here we go…” He created another portal and pulled the Sword of Gryffindor through it. “You’ll want this,” he winked when he handed it to Sirius.

Sirius rolled his eyes and wondered if the equal exasperation and attraction he felt were how Lily felt for all those years when James tried to get her attention…

If so, James owed her one hell of an apology.

 

“Hey, kill the snake,” was the only thing Strange said before pulling Sirius through another portal.

That wasn’t exactly enough of a warning for Sirius before he stepped out and found himself face-to-face with a giant snake baring venom covered fangs in his face.

Not a Gryffindor for nothing though, Sirius grit his teeth and instinctively plunged the sword through the mouth of the snake. When he yanked it hard to the side, the snake’s mouth was ripped clean off. Another hard stab drove the sword through the neck - did snakes have necks? - and the head was severed off.

“What the fuck was that?” Sirius howled, pinning Strange with a furious glare. “Are you trying to get me killed?”

Strange was buffing his nails on the well-fit black shirt he wore.

“Hm? Of course not, sweetheart,” he said nonchalantly, his eyes on his fingernails. “I thought you might like feeling helpful.”

Sirius sputtered, “Feeling helpful? I’m meant to be—”

“Yes, yes, the old wizard with the ugly beard trusted no one but you with this task,” Strange drawled. He held his hand out to Sirius with another teasing smile. “Isn’t it more fun with a partner?”

Yes.

“No,” Sirius snapped. He ignored Strange’s hand and looked around the posh bedroom they were in. “Did we come for a horcrux or so I can feel helpful?” he sneered.

“We did, you killed it, congrats.”

Sirius quit inspecting the eerily familiar green and silver decorated bedroom suite and looked down at the dead snake in horror.

“It was in the snake?” he asked, shocked.

“Disgusting, isn’t it?” Strange said, not sounding bothered at all.

Sirius didn’t know what kind of mad ‘future reading’ powers Strange had, but the prat could pretend to be surprised by reality every once in a while.

“Ready to visit your Alma Mater?” Strange asked Sirius after sending the snake’s head to the Tower.

“Where even are we?” Sirius asked as he reluctantly took Strange’s hand once more.

“Mm… Lucius Malfoy’s home, well, Narcissa’s now, I should say.”

Sirius laughed his arse off at that and was feeling a touch more fond of Strange. Anyone who helped him break into one cousin’s bank vault then another one’s house couldn’t be all that bad.

And when Strange summoned a cloak that was laying on the bed, more proof of their trespassing, Sirius was even more fond of the sorcerer.

 

Sirius didn’t need told where they were the next time they stepped out of the portal together. Sirius could feel it in his bones that he was home.

All around Sirius were stacks and stacks of rubbish - books and furniture and clothes - but the warm embrace of magic in the air was pure Hogwarts.

“You look happy,” Strange said, wiping the fond smile off Sirius’ face immediately.

Sirius shrugged. “This was my first real home,” he said quietly, too pleased at being back to keep up his snark. “I had everything here.”

Sirius had friends and freedom, love and laughter.

His days at Hogwarts were some of his absolute happiest-

Pulling pranks with James.

Snogging Remus in the library.

Even helping Peter with homework had been fun at the time.

Hogwarts brought magic to Sirius’ life in a way his pureblooded family could never understand.

“Columbia University was my happy place,” Strange said simply. He had a brief flash of sorrow on his face when Sirius looked over at him. “My mother wasn’t what you would call a pleasant woman, going to college was something of an escape.”

Sirius did not feel empathy for Strange, he merely had a moment of shared commiseration.

“Yeah, that’s what Hogwarts was for me.” Sirius looked around the entirely unfamiliar room. “I’m not quite sure where we are though…”

“No idea,” Strange said briskly, the moment of vulnerability gone. He clicked his fingers and Sirius saw a little leather pouch rise up in the air from a stack of what seemed to be old quidditch jerseys.

“This is a horcrux?” Sirius asked when the pouch flew straight to his chest and he had no choice but to take it.

“Nope.” Strange snapped his fingers again and a silver gleaming tiara rose up in the air even deeper in the room. “That is the horcrux, the bag is a gift to make our next stop less painful.”

Sirius narrowed his eyes suspiciously at Strange and he slowly opened the pouch while Strange sent the tiara to the Tower. The inside of the pouch was enchanted and Sirius pulled up all his courage before slowly plunging his hand inside of it.

What he pulled out was entirely unexpected.

“A sketchbook?” Sirius asked, staring blankly at the cover of a clean sketchbook. Sirius tried to open it, to flip through the pages, but it was charmed shut.

“A single drop of your blood on the letter B should do it,” Strange said. He watched Sirius intently, an uncharacteristic frown on his lips. “You’re going to cry, which I’m all for men displaying emotions, but be careful not to drop any tears on the pages or you’ll be even more upset.”

Sirius couldn’t imagine what about a sketchbook would make him cry in front of Strange, but he pulled his wand from his pocket and prodded his fingertip lightly, drawing up a small drop of blood.

A blood lock was an old charm, one frowned on by most ‘light’ wizards. The book shouldn’t have opened if it was done correctly, only fam—

“Oh.” Sirius flipped to the very first page of the book and felt his heart stop in his chest.

There, in black charcoals, was a drawing of Sirius himself. It was Sirius when he was younger, his eyes sparkling happily while his lips were curled in a teasing grin that he used to wear so easily.

It was so lifelike, so detailed, and Sirius knew the signature in the corner of the page before he even looked at it.

‘R.A.B.’

“Reggie,” Sirius whispered bleakly. He tilted his head back some and held the book out safely when the first sting of tears reminded him not to smear the pages.

Sirius flipped through the book slowly and was absently grateful for the steadying hand clasping his shoulder while he hungrily devoured each page.

Regulus was a talented artist, he always had been. Sirius used to buy him muggle art supplies for his birthdays and he couldn’t be sure that the book he held wasn’t actually one he bought.

Each page had a different picture on it, all in tones of black and all so lifelike. There was Sirius on a broomstick with a quaffle in his hand. There was James sleeping at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall. Sirius’ animagus form that Regulus shouldn’t have even known of, in excruciating detail.

James with his head popping out from beneath his cloak, his hair all mussed up and his eyes twinkling.

Sirius with his wand drawn and a fierce look on his young face.

Barty Crouch Junior, laughing his head off about something in the library.

Severus Snape, hunched over a cauldron with steam rising up.

Sirius again, leaning against the rail of the Astronomy Tower, a single tear glistening on his cheek.

James with his head bowed and a sheepish smile on his face in front of an angry Minerva.

Sirius.

James.

Sirius and James.

Reggie spent years hating Sirius from afar and drawing him in his book.

“It’s my brother,” Sirius said, truly choked up and freely crying. The last page was a self-portrait. It was beautiful enough to be in a museum with the greats. Regulus stood in front of a mirror and he was broken and crying on the outside with the dark mark on his arm while his reflection showed a perfect pureblood expression of disdain.

It was as beautiful as it was terrible.

Sirius nearly dropped the book when his shoulders shook with harsh sobs. It was Strange who caught it and it was Strange who wrapped an arm around Sirius when he sank to the ground, crying for all the things he lost.

“I think he loved you a great deal,” Strange said solemnly when Sirius was too wrecked with grief to truly listen. “He must have to spend so much time paying attention to you.”

“I love you, prat.”

“And I love you, little pest.”

 

“YOU TOOK THE MARK?!”

“YOU LEFT ME!”

 

“They’re- they’re saying he got cold feet. I’m so sorry, Sirius, Albus’ spy told him that he’s gone.”

Regulus was gone and all Sirius had left of him was a sketchbook of proof that he’d never lost his little brother after all.

And nothing had ever hurt so badly in Sirius’ life.

 

Sirius bent over at the waist and cried all the grief out that he wasn’t able to do when he first lost Reg-

Not when he died, but when he took the mark.

“I told him I hated him,” Sirius said bleakly. He wiped his face off on a handkerchief that was pressed in his hand. “I said ‘James is my only brother’ and… and Reggie cried, he cried and he never cries.”

 

“YOU LEFT ME!” Reg screamed, tears streaming down his face. “I NEEDED YOU AND YOU WERE GONE!”

“SO YOU THOUGHT THE DAMNED DEATH EATERS WOULD REPLACE ME? FUCK YOU, REGULUS! YOU WANT TO BE ONE OF THEM? GREAT! BUT YOU CANT BE WITH THEM AND BE MY BROTHER!”

“You- you don’t mean that, Sirius.”

“I do. James is my brother and he’s a hell of a lot better than you.”

 

And those were Sirius’ last words to the brother he once protected so fiercely and loved so deeply.

“I’m sorry,” Strange said, sounding as if he meant it. “I think that our next stop might bring you some peace, whenever you’re ready.”

Sirius took a few minutes to calm himself and wipe the snot and tears off his face. When he was ready, Sirius accepted Strange’s hand while he held tight to Reggie’s book in his other hand.

“Where are we headed?” Sirius asked once he was on his feet and relatively composed.

“Your house,” Strange said before he stepped through yet another portal and pulled Sirius with him.

Sirius had hoped that Strange meant the Tower, but he had a horrible feeling in his gut that if a Lestrange had a horcrux, a Malfoy had a horcrux, of course a Black would have one.

The two of them stepped through the portal, hand-in-hand, and Sirius nearly dropped Strange’s hand when he found himself in the sitting room of Grimmauld.

The sitting room where Remus and Tonks were quite occupied on the sofa.

“Sirius!” Tonks yelped and rolled off Remus’ lap, adjusting her crooked blouse as she did. “Bloody hell.”

Remus was a deep shade of red when Sirius looked blandly at him, pushing away the envy and hurt that reminded him that Remus, the first love of Sirius’ life, chose Tonks over him.

“Maybe a warning next time,” Remus said gruffly as he subtly adjusted himself to become presentable.

“For Sirius to visit his own house?” Strange tsk’d and squeezed Sirius’ hand quickly. “Maybe you should consider finding a different hideaway for this sweet little May-December romance.”

Tonks’ hair was hanging in her face, hiding the embarrassment Sirius could feel radiating off her. She bounced on the balls of her feet and shrugged in a sheepish way.

“It’s not really May December,” she laughed. “June August, maybe.”

“Whatever you need to tell yourself,” Strange said evenly. His remark must have drawn Remus’ eyes to him because suddenly Sirius could feel him staring at their entwined hands.

It gave the wrong impression, but that was suddenly the impression that Sirius wanted to give.

“Remus, Tonks, I’d like you to meet Stephen,” Sirius said, stressing Strange’s first name as his eyes met Remus’. “He’s a neurosurgeon, sorcerer, and an excellent lover.”

Strange squeezed Sirius’ hand in obvious amusement, but he didn’t call him out on the blatant lie either.

Remus stood up slowly and had the maturity to offer Strange his hand, no matter how ill he suddenly looked.

“Remus Lupin,” he said tersely. “How exactly do you two know each other?”

“Intimately,” Strange said smoothly, not missing a beat. He glanced down at Remus’ hand and then raised a condescending brow at him. “I’m going to ignore that given what we just walked in on. Germs, I’m sure you understand.”

Sirius laughed gaily and felt much lighter than he had only minutes ago.

Tonks chuckled too and she winked when she caught Sirius’ eye. Tonks was a good cousin, it wasn’t her fault that Remus was a back-stabbing, boyfriend abandoning, baby forgetting, boot licking, dick.

“Look at Sirius, shacking up with the Sorcerer Supreme,” Tonks said brightly. A quick gesture to the Daily Prophet laying on a nearby coffee table cleared away any curiosity Sirius had about how Tonks knew Strange.

Sirius led Strange over by the hand and only let go to pick up the paper - there was no chance he’d let go of Reggie’s book.

“Aw, look at us,” Sirius said flirtatiously to Strange. On the cover of the paper was a moving black and white photograph of Sirius and Strange taking turns shaking hands with the muggle president, a funny bloke named Obama who apparently knew Harry, and MACUSA’s president. The headline was complimentary too: ‘WRONGFUL CONVICT AND SORCERER SUPREME BRING MAGIC TO MUGGLES!’

“I think I’ll just keep that,” Strange said as he carefully took the paper from Sirius and sent it away in a quickly conjured portal. “To show your godson,” he said when Sirius watched an odd blush grace Strange’s cheeks. Strange held Sirius’ eyes evenly and Sirius could hear the word in his head as clearly as if Strange had mastered legilimency.

“Inevitable.”

“How is Harry?” Remus asked loudly, ruining the moment.

Strange shot Remus an unimpressed look over his shoulder. “You should ask Harry. I’m sure you know how to write a letter, correct?”

Fuck.

Sirius might love Strange.

Remus looked appropriately abashed and Sirius was smiling harder than ever.

“We actually have important business to get to,” Sirius said with as much arrogance as he could muster up. It was easy as he stood side-by-side with a fit bloke who could maneuver muggle medicine as easily as he did magic though.

Sirius always did have a soft spot for swots.

“Excuse us then,” Remus said shortly. He gave Tonks a gentle smile, one that Sirius used to be on the receiving end of, and offered her his hand.

Tonks looked confused for a moment as she looked between Remus and Sirius quickly. Sirius wondered if Remus told her about their history, how Sirius begged for a relationship when he came back from Azkaban and Remus turned him away.

Sirius wondered if Remus told her how easily he broke Sirius with his rejection.

“I’ll see you later?” Tonks said to Sirius, making it sound like a question when she took Remus’ hand and let him pull her toward the front door.

“That wasn’t painfully uncomfortable at all,” Strange said as he let go of Sirius’ hand and sat on the sofa. He looked up at Sirius with false innocence. “Care to tell me the story there?”

“Not especially, no.”

“Fine.” Strange swung his legs up and put them on the coffee table. “Then you better sit, because your elf is going to tell us a story before we get the horcrux from him.”

Sirius closed his eyes for a moment, the easy laughter he felt draining away immediately. It used to be so easy to act aloof and unaffected by life.

Perhaps Sirius was growing up, maturing thanks to the bloody therapy Clint pushed him in. If so, he fucking hated it.

“If Kreacher’s involved then I need a drink,” Sirius said flatly. He sat down on the sofa beside Strange and pretended not to notice when Strange scooted an inch closer to him. Sirius sat Reggie’s sketchbook on his lap and then pulled his wand and summoned a bottle of wine from the kitchen along with two glasses.

“Château Lafite Rothschild,” Strange said, pronouncing the wine perfectly. He held his glass up to Sirius until Sirius reluctantly tapped the glasses together. “Romantic.”

Sirius rolled his eyes and took a long drink of the tart red wine.

“We’re in my nightmare of a childhood home, on the sofa where the first love of my life was mid-shag with my cousin while we hunt for soul pieces of a mad wizard,” Sirius summarized drily. “I don’t think this is romantic.”

“Our next date will be,” Strange said with his blasted arrogance and belief that he knew the future. “Care to call for your elf? I’m sure he won’t respond to me.”

While Sirius would rather walk in on Remus and Tonks again than call for Kreacher, they did have a job to do.

Kreacher appeared when Sirius called for him and the insults flowed immediately.

“Kreacher’s nasty master, disappointment of a son, has returned,” he grumbled as he gave Sirius a half-arsed bow and stared daggers at Strange. “And he brings more filth in my—”

“Hi,” Strange interrupted, smiling widely at Kreacher. “We need that locket you have hidden in your totally not creepy and disgusting cupboard.”

Kreacher stiffened immediately and his eyes went wide with false innocence.

“Kreacher is not knowing what the man is talking about.”

Sirius looked at Strange and grinned when he drew a lazy circle with his finger, showing Kreacher’s little hideaway when he did.

“NO!” Kreacher wailed. The elf lunged at Strange when Strange pulled a thick silver locket through the portal and held it high. “YOU IS NOT TAKING MASTER REGULUS’ LOCKET!”

Sirius’ amusement at seeing someone else torment Kreacher drained away as quickly as the blood in his face did.

“Kreacher, I order you to tell me what you mean,” Sirius said hoarsely, staring at the locket that had a Slytherin crest dangling from it.

Kreacher cringed and he cried and at one point he even began beating his head off the floor, but Sirius was finally able to word a command that forced the story from Kreacher’s mouth.

 

And that was how Sirius learned of the bravest act he had ever heard in his life. Not from a Gryffindor, so known for their brash bravery and self-sacrificing tendencies, but from a quiet Slytherin boy who gave up everything in private to work to bring down the Dark Lord.

 

By the end of Kreacher’s horrible tale, Sirius found himself comforting the elf while they cried for Regulus together in each other’s arms.

“M-Master Sirius will finish Master Regulus’ job?” Kreacher asked with eyes shining with both tears and misery while Sirius tried to compose himself yet again.

“Yeah, yeah,” Sirius said, nodding quickly. He was on the floor with his legs crossed and looked up at Strange, pleading with his eyes. “Can you get the sword?” he asked him.

Kreacher followed Regulus’ order to the end, he withstood torture at the hand of Voldemort.

If anyone deserved to finish the horrifying task that Regulus started, it was Kreacher.

Kreacher’s thin arms wobbled when Strange retrieved the sword for him and Sirius stood behind the elf, holding his elbows for support.

“Straight down, Kreacher,” Sirius encouraged him quietly. “Then- then Reggie’s last wish will be fulfilled.”

Kreacher let out a terrible wail of pain as he swung the sword down, breaking the locket and the table beneath it in one go. Sirius kept Kreacher from collapsing and lifted him gently to the love seat. Strange was right behind Sirius, handing him a blanket, and Sirius wrapped it around Kreacher kindly.

“You did good, Kreacher,” Sirius told him, weary to his very soul. “Reg… Reg would be proud.”

“Overkill, perhaps,” Strange whispered when that only caused Kreacher’s tears and shoulder heaving sobs to increase. Sirius nodded in agreement and then turned toward Strange, letting the man catch him when Sirius’ legs wanted to collapse.

“Let’s go,” Sirius said roughly. He didn’t want to stay in the house another moment, he couldn’t. Tonks and Remus would be there for Kreacher, Sirius needed to be somewhere that his brother wasn’t haunting him.

“Back to your place?” Strange asked while his steady hands held Sirius’ arms as support. Sirius would be mortified by his weakness, but he was exhausted.

“Let’s get the last one,” Sirius said bleakly, almost no longer caring about the mission. If it wasn’t for Regulus’ dedication to it and the impact it would have on the last of Sirius’ family, Sirius would call it a day and go drink himself to oblivion while he looked at Reg’s pictures again.

Strange hesitated and Sirius saw in his eyes that Sirius wasn’t going to like wherever the last horcrux was.

“I just want to be finished,” Sirius snapped when Strange wasn’t moving. “If you know where it is—”

“You’re going to be scared and I need you to know that I have a plan,” Strange said slowly. Sirius huffed when the man sent the sword and remnants of the locked through a portal and then opened a larger one. “I lied when I said this required skin-on-skin contact, but I think you might need a friend, if nothing else.”

Sirius held Regulus’ sketchbook tightly and let Strange - Stephen, he’d seen Sirius sob more than once in a single day, Sirius could call him by his first name - take his hand before pulling them through another portal to the final horcrux.

 

Sirius let out a relieved laugh when Stephen must have changed his mind. They didn’t step out of anywhere dark, mysterious, or tainted by memories that broke Sirius’ heart. Instead, they stepped out in Tony’s living room and startled poor Harry who was sitting on the couch.

“I thought you were going to take us to the last…?” Sirius trailed off at the way Stephen was staring at Harry.

“I did.”

Harry looked up from the bowl of cereal he was eating with a scowl and a curious look in his eyes that were so like Lily’s.

“What’s going on, guys?” Harry asked. “It’s polite to use the lifts, it dings instead of sparks, you see.”

 

Sirius’ eyes locked on Harry’s scar - a cursed scar for the boy that somehow survived an unsurvivable curse - and if he thought all he did that day, all he learned, had hurt?

Sirius didn’t know pain until he looked at that scar.

Chapter Text

Sunday, December 18

Tony glanced over at his son and refrained from laughing, but only just barely. The kid was sitting in his chair beside Tony on the launchpad, practically vibrating with some mixture of excitement and nerves. 

Harry was bundled up with a hoodie and a coat on and he had his forearm crutches laid across his lap. Tony asked him why he brought them when they rode the elevator up to the launchpad and Harry had been about as subtle as a rhinoceros charging through their place. 

“Just in case I can use them,” Harry said vaguely. “I’ve used them in therapy.”

Which he had, according to Doctor Torres. Harry had also used them the morning before at the VA after one of the guys there, Anderson, goaded him until he tried. Tony had watched and felt waves of pride wash over him when Harry rose to the bait and took Anderson’s own forearm crutches and pulled himself in a standing position. 

It was shaky and Harry couldn’t do it for long, but he did it. 

Tony had put in an order for the crutches on their way home and had them delivered by the time Harry made it back from his date with his geek. 

“How much longer?” Harry asked. 

Tony checked his watch, “About forty-five seconds before it’s visible.”

Harry nodded and put the crutches on the ground firmly before he started pushing himself up. Tony assumed that Harry had brought them to be able to be standing when his friends arrived so he didn’t say anything, just watched carefully as Harry swayed the smallest amount. 

“Good job,” Tony said lightly, not wanting to startled Harry, once the kid was upright and looking smug. 

“I… can you do me a favor?” Harry shrugged a shoulder up and blushed a little. “Can you take a picture so I can send it to Anderson?”

“Sure.” Tony backed up a few steps after moving Harry’s wheelchair from the frame. “I don’t know that your boyfriend is going to like you sending such badass pictures to another guy though,” he added while he snapped a couple photos with his phone. 

Harry laughed and it was such a sorely missed sound that it brought an unconscious smile to Tony’s face. 

“Don’t be daft, I’m telling Anderson to fuck off with his daily ‘motivational texts’,” Harry explained. “Every morning I wake up to some variety of ‘the world is your vagina, fuck it hard’.” 

Tony threw his head back and absolutely roared with laughter until Harry was laughing with him and they were just a father-son pair of idiots standing in the cold laughing their asses off.

Everything just felt so damn good recently. Tony had finally gotten the blueprints down for prosthetics and while Pepper ran Stark Industry, Tony had been able to spend more time in the lab, creating, and more time with Harry. Sirius had sent a text that morning, saying he and Strange had destroyed all but one of Darth Vader’s soul pieces. Harry was standing and in one week Tony would get to celebrate his first ever Christmas with his son. 

It was the first Christmas Tony could remember actually being excited for. 

Plus, six teenagers were coming to stay for two weeks - seven teenagers actually, if Tony’s top secret mission worked. And it wasn’t as if Tony wanted to have his space invaded by kids that weren’t his, but Harry seemed excited which made Tony excited. 

Everything was such a bright contrast to the darkness of last month that Tony wondered if he’d somehow become the Grinch whose heart grew three sizes. 

“Here they come!” Harry yelped suddenly. Tony saw the black jet flying directly toward them and quickly moved Harry’s chair directly behind him. 

“If you fall it’ll look more intentional landing in your chair than if you land on your ass,” Tony explained when Harry scowled at him. “Humor me.”

Harry rolled his eyes, but he nodded too. “Don’t- don’t baby me when they’re here,” he muttered from the corner of his mouth while the jet landed and the wind did cause him to stagger some. 

“Me? Baby you?” Tony scoffed. He was pleased that Harry thought Tony was attentive enough to count as a ‘babying’ type of parent though. “You’re the one who keeps disconnecting the power to my lab for mealtimes. You’ve stolen Jarvis from me, it’s some sort of British conspiracy, isn’t it?” 

“If I told you I’d have to kill you,” Harry smirked. “Thanks again for- for this,” he said, tilting his head to the jet. 

Tony would have assured Harry that it was his pleasure to let his friends come stay, but then the ramp lowered from the jet and a flurry of gingers exploded from it. 

“HARRY!” A girl with a long curtain of dark red hair and a face full of freckles ran full tilt from the jet toward Harry. Tony had to put his hand on Harry’s back to keep the poor kid upright when the girl wrapped her arms around him in a tight hug and nearly knocked him over. 

“Ginny! Be careful!” Harry’s friend Hermione ran off the jet with Ron beside her and shook her head at the girl hugging Harry. 

“Yeah, he’s only got three legs!” Another red-head, this one with an identical twin, snickered. The twins both held a few bags on their arms and were wearing identical smiles on their faces. 

“Sorry.” The girl, Ginny, apparently, let go of Harry and grinned up at him with pink cheeks. “I’ve just missed you so much, you prat! How come Ron gets a phone to send you videos and I don’t?”

“Favoritism,” Harry grinned. He tilted his head around Ginny until he spotted the little blonde that waltzed off the jet carrying an ominous box with air holes poked in it. “Hey, Luna, whatcha got there?”

The girl smiled at Harry and held the box up high. “It’s Lee Jordan’s tarantula, I promised to watch it while he’s on holiday with his parents.”

The twins and Ginny all laughed when Ron twitched away from Luna with a horrified look. 

“You can’t bring a tarantula to Harry’s house!” Ron hissed. “It’s- he- I’m sure Harry’s dad doesn’t want it inside.”

“Harry’s dad doesn’t really mind,” Tony said airily, winking at Luna. “What’s one more arachnid to join the party?”

“The more the merrier!” One of the twins laughed and then held up the bags hooked on his arms. “Are we camping out here or do we get to see inside the fancy tower?”

Hermione and Ron hovered on either side of Harry while Harry slowly sat down in his chair and laid the crutches across his lap. 

“I’m not actually great at walking yet,” Harry told the kids while Tony led the group inside. “It’s more complicated than it looks.”

“I imagine it takes an incredible amount of strength too,” Hermione said thoughtfully. “It’s quite impressive that you’re able to stand already!”

“Well that’s fucking Anderson’s fault,” Harry laughed. 

Tony smiled to himself when everyone loaded in the elevator and Tony pressed the button for the floor just below his. Harry noticed they weren’t going back to their place and grinned at Tony from his seat, never breaking for even a second while he told the others about his new bestie Specialist Anderson. Tony wouldn’t let Harry see the renovations he made to Steve’s floor and he knew the kid had been dying to peek every time Tony mentioned it. 

Remodeling Steve’s place had been therapeutic in a way- Tony got to take a sledgehammer to Steve’s walls instead of his face and in the end he got to create something that would make Harry happy. 

Rhodey had told Tony it was overboard, ‘maybe he’d forgive Steve one day’, but Tony didn’t plan on it. And even if the unthinkable happened, like Steve got a lobotomy and saw that he fucked up big time, then it wasn’t like Tony would ever want him residing in the same house as Harry anyway. 

And Pepper gave his plans her stamp of approval, so Tony knew it was fine. 

“Merlin’s balls!” 

One of the twins gasped when they entered the floor that Tony dubbed ‘Harry’s place to keep his teenagers so they don’t touch Tony’s stuff’. 

Tony had taken the two bedrooms and converted them to three smaller bedrooms, each still a decent size with two beds and a couple dressers in each room. The kitchen was fully stocked with as much junk food as Tony could fill it with. The living room had plush and comfortable furniture situated around a flat screen that took up the wall and was loaded with every streaming service available. 

The best part, in Tony’s opinion, was the pool table that took up the center of the dining room. It had been a bitch to sand down the legs until it was just the right height for all the kids - Harry would have to stretch some and the others would have to duck - but it was fully functional for all of them. 

Even though that was Tony’s favorite part, he figured that Sirius’ contribution would be more appreciated by the witches and wizards. 

“You haven’t seen anything yet,” Tony said. He gestured to the door that once led to Steve’s private gym. “Mister Weasley, would you do the honors?”

One of the twins shouldered Ron out of the way before giving Tony a bow. 

“I’d be honored,” he sniffed. 

Tony watched Harry’s face as the twin opened the door and all teens made various sounds of appreciation. Harry’s eyes widened and he clenched the armrests of his chair hard while the girl, Luna, pushed him further inside so he could see what Sirius had designed. 

What had once been a pretty standard gym filled with top of the line equipment had been changed to mimic a ‘quidditch pitch’. It was amazing, really, the way that Sirius wove his magic around the room and expanded the area to a size that wasn’t logistically possible. Sirius had added ‘goal posts’ and then bragged about the ‘bloody difficult charm’ he used to make the sky always bright blue with warmth filling the area. 

It wasn’t as cool as a pool table, but Sirius told Tony that Harry would love it. 

“You have YOUR OWN QUIDDITCH FIELD?!” Ginny shrieked. She spun around and smiled at Tony widely, oddly enough reminding Tony a little bit of Pepper herself. “If you ever decide to adopt, I’d like to be formally considered.”

“Us first!” the twins cried in tangent. 

“Harry’s already my brother, if Tony’s adopting anyone, it’s me,” Ron argued. He let out a whistle at the broomsticks that Sirius put in the room along with a trunk full of ‘quaffles’ and ‘bludgers’. “Merlin, Harry, you didn’t tell us about this! I could have been rubbing it in Malfoy’s face these last couple of weeks!”

“I didn’t know,” Harry said, still looking around with wide eyes. Tony couldn’t really tell how the surprise had gone over, Harry’s expression was nearly blank aside from the shock in his eyes. 

“And you shouldn’t be antagonizing Malfoy anyway,” Hermione scolded Ron. “He’s mourning. I heard that his mother is considering taking him from Hogwarts altogether.”

“Good riddance,” Ron muttered. 

Tony’s phone vibrated in his pocket and he pulled it out to glance at it quickly. 

“Hey, you guys sort out bedrooms,” Tony told the teens, grinning at the caller ID. “There’s two beds in each room, I don’t care who sleeps where but nobody’s allowed to get pregnant here.”

While the boys almost immediately started teasing Hermione, Tony walked off for some privacy before answering the call. 

“Petey, my second favorite spider, how can I help you?” Tony asked cheerfully. 

“Is there a reason why my Aunt May won a contest for a Bahama’s Christmas cruise?” Peter asked, skipping small talk entirely.

“She entered a contest and got lucky?” Tony said, feigning innocence. 

“Mm, she didn’t enter a contest.”

“Then it’s amazing she won!” Tony cried. “Imagine the odds!”

“The odds of my aunt winning a two week cruise with her flight paid for, a rental car to take her to the airport secured, and a prepaid credit card for shopping? Yeah, those are pretty low odds, dude,” Peter said, not sounding nearly as amused as Tony was. 

“But she’s going, right?” Tony pressed hopefully. “Because that sounds like a once in a lifetime opportunity that she simply cannot pass up.”

Peter sighed in the phone. “Why did you want my aunt out of the freaking country for two weeks?”

Tony leaned against the pool table and plucked up the eight ball and tossed it in the air casually while he held the phone between his shoulder and ear. 

“I resent the implication that I was involved in this,” Tony said. “Although… if you’re going to be home alone for two weeks and don’t feel like setting up booby traps for lovable yet idiotic burglars… Harry and I would be happy for you to stay with us.”

There was silence on the phone and Tony waited patiently for the response he was hoping he’d get. 

“You… you spent a fortune to send my aunt on a vacation just so I’d come stay at your place for Christmas?” Peter asked, sounding much too surprised. “Why didn’t you just invite me like a normal human being?!”

“Normal’s overrated,” Tony quipped. “So are you coming or not? I can have Happy pick you up in an hour and explain to your aunt that you’ll be perfectly safe here so she can take a well-deserved vacation from all the stress of being Spider-Kid’s aunt.”

Silence. 

Then, “Yeah, sure.”

“Happy will be there in an hour!” Tony said happily. “See you soon, Petey.”

As soon as he hung up on Harry’s boyfriend, Tony sent a text to Happy asking him to go fetch the kid. Then, since everything else seemed to be working out so well for him, Tony decided to press his luck some. 

Would you like to get dinner with me tonight, Miss Potts?

Tony was whistling merrily to himself while he watched Harry’s friends run from bedroom to bedroom, tossing bags at each other, while Harry’s laughter could be heard from inside one of the rooms. 

Honestly, the only thing that could make it any better—

Ding!

Tony felt a small flutter in his stomach - he was a grown man so it was completely stupid, but Pepper was… Pepper - when he saw it was a reply to his invite. 

I’d love to. Send me the details?

Tony beamed as he quickly sent a response, insisting he pick her up at seven from the house she stubbornly wouldn’t move out of. 

“You look happy,” Harry said suspiciously when he quietly wheeled himself over to where Tony was. 

“The sun is shining, the birds are singing, oh and Pepper agreed to go out with me tonight,” Tony said. “I’m telling you, kid, if things keep working out for me then I’m going to become an optimist.”

“You’ve got a date?” Harry asked, his suspicion melting away for a heartening true smile. “I told you if you stopped shagging every bloke you met that Pepper would say yes!” Harry grimaced then as he looked Tony over from top to bottom, clearly unimpressed. 

“You should shower and put on something less… oily,” Harry told him. “You’re taking her somewhere nice, right?”

“Who’s taking who somewhere nice?” Ginny asked as she and Luna loped over to join them. 

“He’s got a date with this woman he’s fancied for ages,” Harry said. “Pepper’s been waiting for him to grow up, I think.”

“Aw, Harry’s future step-mum,” Ginny sighed, wiping away a faux-tear on her cheek. “Yeah, you should definitely change, mate, you’re filthy.”

“And get flowers,” Luna told Tony seriously. “Roses are very clichéd, but I think purple sunflowers would look lovely and send the right message.”

“Lue,” Ginny sighed, “where is he supposed to find purple sunflowers at? It’s December and that’s not exactly a natural color for them, is it?” 

Luna shrugged and let her eyes wander around. “If he finds her purple sunflowers, then that means that Venus blessed their relationship.”

Tony caught Harry’s eye and they both fought hard to keep from laughing both at Luna’s very serious declaration and at the exasperation radiating from the fond smile on Ginny’s face. 

“I will keep my eyes peeled for purple sunflowers,” Tony told Luna. He put his hand on Harry’s shoulder for a moment, grinning down at him. “You think you can handle this mess tonight while I try and woo Miss Potts?”

Ginny slapped her hand over Harry’s mouth and gave Tony a sweet smile that didn’t fool him for a single second. 

“Harry can absolutely handle it,” Ginny said. “You shouldn’t worry about a thing, Harry’s a very responsible bloke and my brothers, Fred and George? They’re adults, technically, so really you’re leaving things in the best possible hands.”

Tony didn’t believe that girl for a single second, but the entire apartment was basically as safe as it could be. The elevator doors wouldn’t even open up to the floor is it wasn’t for a person on Jarvis’ list. The windows that made up the west wall were bulletproof. There were even half a dozen more sprinkler systems set up on that floor than any others. 

“We’ll be fine,” Harry added when he smacked Ginny’s hand so she would release his mouth. “Honestly, you should just focus on Pepper. I dunno if you’ll get a second chance.” 

“What a vote of confidence,” Tony laughed. “Alright then, I’m off to get you a stepmom. Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do, okay?”

Harry stared balefully at Tony with an eyebrow quirked. “So anything is on the table then?” 

“Yup!” Tony made his way to the elevator with a pep to his step. “Have fun, send me a text if you decide to stay down here tonight.”

“Tell Pepper I said hi,” Harry called to Tony’s back. “Good luck!” 

“Who needs luck with looks like this?” Tony grinned as he stepped on the elevator. “A smile here, a smile there, and it’s all sunsets and honeymoons.”

Harry rolled his eyes, but Tony’s excitement couldn’t be dimmed. Not by anything. 

Especially not by Ginny Weasley’s voice declaring that Harry should have a party with all his ‘muggle friends’ just as the elevator doors closed. 

If Harry wanted to throw a party, there really was no better place for him to have it. It was a right of passage for a teen to throw a party when their parent was gone, Tony had done it… at least seventeen times. 

 

Tony’s joy and unfamiliar optimism was at an all-time high when he drove toward Pepper’s house that evening. 

The city was decorated for the holidays, Tony had his very own family to celebrate with, the birds were chirping, the sky was blue, and—

“Son of a bitch.”

Tony pulled off the side of the road quickly enough to get a few honks and middle fingers from other cars that passed him. He just ignored them though as he stared thoughtfully at the little stand he nearly passed. 

Not five minutes from Pepper’s house was a little homemade stand being manned by two women with long flowing skirts and flower headpieces on. And what were they selling, in the middle of December?

Sunflowers. 

Tony grabbed a bill from his wallet and walked over with a smile. “Evening,” he said pleasantly. 

“Oh, you look dressed for a date,” one of the women said with a smile. Tony would put cash down that the two of them were stoned out of their minds, but they had a wide variety of sunflowers and vases on display and Tony wasn’t going to ignore such a blatant sign from the universe. 

“I am,” Tony said with the smile that couldn’t be contained. He carefully chose a dozen of the bright purple dyed sunflowers and picked a clear vase for them. “Someone told me that purple sunflowers are good for first dates.”

“They are,” the other woman said, nodding eagerly. “Purple sunflowers have been blessed by Venus, and Venus blesses those partnerships that honor her. I gave Mystique purple sunflowers on our first date and we’ve been together for five years now.”

The two women shared affectionate looks and Tony pulled the hundred he grabbed from his pocket and slid it across the wooden stall countertop. 

“Fingers crossed that Venus works in my favor then.” Tony held up the vase cheerily. “Have a good night, ladies.”


Tony had no idea if purple sunflowers were lucky or not, and he doubted if they were blessed by anything, but when Pepper Potts agreed to go on a date, then a guy could use all the luck he could get.

Chapter Text

Sunday, December 18

“This was a terrible idea,” Harry hissed at Ron. “I’m not going out there!” 

“It was your idea!” Ron cried. 

“Mm, I think it was Ginny’s,” Hermione said absently as she quickly finished braiding her hair, her fingers flying in quick blurs down her dark brown locks. “And quit worrying, Harry, do you really think anyone’s going to stare at your wheelchair when Fred and George are likely to have hidden a few canary creams in the snacks?”

Harry laid his head back on his chair and focused on breathing very slowly and evenly - he was not going to cry. Harry let Ginny call Gwen and invite people to the Tower. Harry let everyone get giddy about having a party. Harry had even been mildly excited to see all his friends from Midtown, introduce them to his friends from Hogwarts, and now Harry couldn’t leave the bedroom that Ron and Hermione were sharing for the holiday. 

The others were already out in the sitting room, laughing and dancing and probably drinking and eating, and Harry was regretting ever agreeing to the party. 

“I can’t go out there,” Harry said quietly, blinking very quickly at the ceiling of the room. “You guys go, just tell them I’m sick or something.”

“Harry James Potter-Stark.” Hermione crossed her arms and stormed over to stand in front of Harry’s chair. Harry wasn’t sure if it was the odd angle he was looking at Hermione from or the fact that Hermione was dressed in a muggle skirt and sweater outfit that threw him off, but he didn’t like it either way. 

“You are not going to make me go out there and mingle with all of your friends without you,” Hermione said sternly. “If anyone so much as looks at your wheelchair sideways, I’ll have the twins lock them in the loo, but you will go to your own party.”

Harry looked around Hermione to Ron, hoping for support, but Ron just shook his head and grinned. 

“Sorry, mate,” Ron grinned. He waved his hands up and down his body, showing off the casual muggle clothes that he’d nicked from Peter when Peter showed up with a backpack asking for a bed to stay for two weeks. “But I’m ready to go pretend to be a muggle and I’m going to need your help to keep my foot out of my mouth.” 

Harry felt his lower lip quiver so he bit down on it hard and nodded his head shortly. 

“Fine. Let’s go.”

“Harry…” Hermione kneeled down in front of Harry and her stern look melted. “I swear to you, I won’t let anyone be cruel. And neither will Peter or the twins—”

“Or Gin,” Ron added. “She’s worse than the twins, mate, I reckon she might just lob someone out a window.”

Harry couldn’t explain to them that he didn’t think anyone would be ‘cruel’, everyone who came were friends of Gwen or Peter, but they were going to stare . They were going to stare at Harry and when they left they were going to whisper about him and gossip about poor pitiful Harry and his one leg and wheelchair. 

If would actually be kinder if they just said something cruel to his face. 

Instead, Harry forced himself to smile and push himself to the door. 

“Let’s party,” Harry said flatly. 

Hermione huffed, unfooled by Harry’s smile, but Ron laughed and followed Harry with a pep in his step. 

 

The first thing Harry noticed as soon as the three of them left the room was that the twins worked fast. In just the time it took Ron and Hermione to change to casual clothes, the twins and Peter had somehow transformed the perfectly normal flat to something that pulsed with loud music and had flashing lights everywhere. There were dozens of people there, a few that Harry recognized like Brittany and Shani, and many more that Harry didn’t. 

Peter was there though, playing pool with Luna and losing spectacularly it looked like. And Harry was sure that—

“HARRY!” Gwen came running to Harry at full speed and launched herself at him, literally climbing in his lap to hug him. “Oh my God, I have missed you so much! You’re like a total hermit now! I come here once a week and you never have time for so much as coffee? You’re the worst friend in the world!” 

Harry grinned at Gwen’s never-ending rant and pushed her off him half-heartedly with a horrible blush. 

“You said you weren’t speaking to me anymore,” Harry reminded her. 

Gwen stuck her lower lip out in a pout and made big sad eyes at Harry as she batted her thick lashes. 

“But then you and Peter worked out your silly fight so I can talk to you again,” she said. Hermione laughed at her statement and Gwen’s face snapped up to where Hermione and Ron stood just behind Harry, one on each side. 

“Hello,” she beamed. “Gwen Stacey, and you are?”

Hermione reached a hand out with her own wide smile. “Hermione Granger and this is Ron Weasley.”

“Oh, beautiful and British,” Gwen said brightly. “Don’t tell me you’re brilliant too, because then I’ll know I’m dreaming.”

Harry heard Ron make a shocked noise and decided to simply… wheel away. Harry wanted to go over by Peter and hide around the pool table with him, but he kept getting stopped by various prior classmates.

“Harry!” Brittany was dancing slowly in the living room to the music playing off the telly. She smiled at Harry, slow and lazy with black painted lips. “I miss you, dude.”

Harry raised his hand at her, “Miss you too.”

“Cool chair,” the girl Brittany was dancing with, a girl with a short purple bob and thick black eyeliner, said. 

“Thanks,” Harry said with a grin. “Cool hair.”

“I've got more dye at home if you need a change,” the girl winked. 

Harry laughed at the offer and shook his head. “I’ll keep that in mind.”

Harry got stopped a few more times by students from Midtown saying they missed him, an odd sentiment since Harry rarely spoke with any of them, but one he appreciated all the same. 

Fred and George were in the kitchen, standing behind a counter covered in glass bottles of what looked like… Harry squinted at the bottles and then hollered at the twins…

“Hey! Did you swipe those from my dad?” he demanded. Harry was not going to get in trouble or upset Tony because the twins wanted to play bartender. 

Fred shook a silver jar that sounded like it had ice in it and winked at Harry. “Nah, we nicked them from Sirius. You want a drink?”

Harry waved his hand, brushing aside the offer, and Fred shrugged before pouring a blue drink in a plastic red cup and handing it off to a girl Harry didn’t know with a flourish. Harry didn’t actually care if they stole the liquor from Sirius, Sirius drank too much anyway, but he didn’t want Tony to be mad at him either. 

I hope your date’s going good. I’m not saying that we’re having a party, but if we were- would you be mad if there was alcohol here?

Tony texted Harry back by the time Harry made it over by the pool table beside Peter. 

Nobody drives and if anyone asks, I had no idea.

Thanks, love you.

Love you too, kid. Be smart and safe.

“You win!” Peter cried, throwing his pool stick on the table only a moment after Harry put his phone away. Peter smiled at Harry and pointed playfully at where Luna was rocking on her heels with a very smug smile. “Did you know she’s a hustler?” he asked Harry. “Where’d you find her, huh? Scamming the Outlaws down at the pool hall?” 

“Luna’s a genius,” Ginny said loyally as she wrapped her arm around Luna’s waist and laid her head on Luna’s shoulder. “You’re just mad you got your arse kicked by a girl.”

Harry waited until the girls took off to the kitchen for food and drinks before raising a brow up at Peter. 

“You let her win, right?”

“Oh, abso-freakin-lutely,” Peter laughed. “I nearly worked up a sweat trying to purposefully lose without looking like I was doing it on purpose.” 

Peter put his hands on Harry’s armrests and bent down, his brown eyes sparkling with little flecks of gold in them. 

“Do I get a consolation kiss?” Peter asked. Harry laughed when Peter rubbed Harry’s nose with his and then actually yelped when he heard Ron’s voice pipe up near them. 

“Oi! Get a room!” 

Harry, flustered, accidentally wheeled forward instead of backward and nearly ran Peter over before he jumped out of the way and Harry looked over at Ron with guilty eyes and a red face. Ron didn’t look… disturbed or disgusted… but maybe he hadn’t seen that Harry was about to snog Peter?

It wasn’t… a secret, necessarily that Harry and Peter were dating, but Harry had never really talked with Ron about it either…

Ron just grinned and waggled his brows. “Better Peter than one of my brothers. I really thought poor Harry was going to try and snag Bill for himself,” he said to Peter. There was an almost mean taunt to his tone when he added, “If only Harry were a bit older…”

Harry once again turned a furious red while Peter let out a carefree laugh and then dipped his head to kiss Harry squarely on the lips. 

“Drink?” Peter offered. He grinned when Harry nodded. “I’ll be back.”

Ron drifted over to stand beside Harry and sighed theatrically while Harry watched Peter make his way through the growing crowd to get to the kitchen. 

“He’s half-spider, mate,” Ron whined. “You can’t find that attractive.”

“Mm… he’s got a great arse,” Harry said, smiling a little shyly at Ron, warm in an unfamiliar way at Ron’s easy acceptance. 

“He’d have to have a great something to make up for the spider shite,” Ron said seriously. “Oi, by the way, your friend stole Hermione from me.”

Harry looked around the flat - had the crowd really increased that much more since Harry left the bedroom? and was that… Pietro in the kitchen with a stack of pizza boxes? - until he found Hermione. 

“Uh…” Harry gaped at the very un-Hermione way that Hermione was giggling and twirling her hair and smiling at Gwen. Gwen leaned forward to whisper something in Hermione’s ear and Harry could see Hermione’s skin darken with a blush at whatever she said. 

Harry raised his hands innocently and looked up at Ron. “Mate, I’ve got no idea what’s happening.”

Ron sighed and put one hand on his chest. “And I really thought our kiss next to the dead basilisk meant something…” Ron’s eyes roamed through the living room and snagged on Shani. “Course… this is a holiday,” he hedged. 

“And that girl likes accents,” Harry told him cheerily. “Her name’s Shani.”

Ron brightened considerably and ran a hand through his hair before slapping Harry on the shoulder. 

“I think I’ll go see if Shani wants a drink,” he said with much more confidence than Harry usually saw from him. 

Had everyone changed that much since Harry left England? Hermione was giggling at a girl and Ron was swaggering over to someone with a cocky smile. Ginny and Luna were dancing together in the living room, making dopey eyes at each other. The twins were having a riot in the kitchen, cracking jokes and making drinks for the crowd of teens watching them. 

It made Harry a little sad, but also it wasn’t as if Harry himself hadn’t changed, he supposed. 

“You look thoughtful, Bright Eyes.” 

Harry looked up and smiled genuinely at Peter and accepted the drink he gave him, something pink with pieces of fruit in it that smelled like alcohol. It was tasty, the twins were apparently good at making drinks. 

“Just thinking about how much everyone’s changed this year,” Harry told Peter. “Everything was- was so different last year.”

“Bad changes or good?” Peter asked. He was crouched down on his knees beside Harry and tilting his head cutely on Harry’s shoulder. 

Harry shrugged, “Good, I suppose. Just… takes some getting used to.”

Peter turned and kissed Harry’s cheek swiftly before standing up and smiling at him. 

“Wanna see if we can kick the twins’ asses at pool?” he offered. He poked Harry on the nose, causing Harry to scowl at him. “Turn that frown upside down, Bright Eyes.”

“You’re an irredeemable sap,” Harry said. “And I don’t know how to play pool.”

“No better time to learn!” 

 

Harry was a bit tipsy an hour later, laughing his arse off, and winning in pool against Hermione and Gwen thanks solely to Peter when he heard a familiar voice call his name. 

“Hey! Stark!”

Harry’s ability to steer his chair was diminished some by the tingling in his fingers, but he managed to turn and blink up at Flash Thompson. 

Flash was smirking at Harry, his arms crossed and his head tilted to the side. “Thanks for the invite.”

“I didn’t invite you,” Harry said, honesty compelled by the fruit flavored drinks the twins kept supplying everyone with. “I don’t even really like you.” 

Flash laughed and then looked curiously at Harry’s wheelchair. “You really need that chair or do you just get sick of hopping around?”

Harry furrowed his brows for a moment and was struggling to think of an answer when a bright purple pool ball went flying directly at Flash. And, considering it didn’t actually hit him, Harry had to assume it wasn’t Peter that threw it. 

“What the hell did you just say?” Gwen shrieked, bringing the attention of everyone in the living room and dining room to her. Gwen had her pool stick held like a sword and she stalked closer until she had the pointed end at Flash’s throat. “Who even invited you? Do you think you’re funny?”

Flash raised his hands and tried to back up, but Hermione appeared out of nowhere, blocking him from escaping Gwen’s rather terrifying wrath. 

“Hey, be cool, I was just—”

Harry snorted then, finally understanding what Gwen was so pissed about. 

‘Hopping around’. 

It was so terribly cruel that it hadn’t even registered to Harry that it was meant to be an insult. 

Flash’s retort to Gwen stuttered off when Harry’s laughter began filling the room and everyone stared at him. Harry didn’t know why they were all acting so shocked, Flash had only called attention to the thing they’d all been wondering about since arriving at the tower. 

“Five points to team jock,” Harry snickered. “You’ve managed to make my crippling depression somehow worse, Flash.”

Gwen took an uncertain step away from Flash when Flash turned and grinned at Harry. 

“What do you call a guy with one leg in a pile of leaves?” Flash asked Harry. 

Harry raised a brow, waiting for the punchline. 

“Harry.”

Harry laughed and then worked hard to look unimpressed. “Did you look that up beforehand?” he asked. 

Flash carefully sidestepped Gwen and strutted over to Harry. “Did you cut your leg off for pity sex?”

“Even with only one leg, I’m not going to shag you,” Harry said seriously. “I’d need to feel much worse about myself first.”

Flash laughed and then hesitated with his hands over the handles of Harry’s chair, silently seeming to ask permission which Harry gave with a nod. 

“When are you coming back to school?” Flash asked as he easily wove through the crowd to get to the kitchen. “You might actually be better at basketball now in this chair.”

“Yeah, I was pretty bummed about losing my leg until I thought about how much better at basketball I’d be,” Harry snorted. He managed an impressive quick stand on his one foot to snag a piece of pizza before sitting back down and taking a huge bite of it. 

Flash jumped up on the counter next to the boxes of pizza and took two slices for himself.

“So you’re just gonna hide out here for the rest of your life? Too good to come to school with us two-legged peasants?” 

“‘Zactly it,” Harry said around his bite of pizza. “Maybe if you cut off one of your legs so we matched then I’d come back.”

“My old man would kill me if I cut off one of my legs,” Flash said with his own grimace. “I’m not going to college on some brainiac scholarship, basketball is my only hope.” 

“You should try with your good looks,” Harry said. “Might be worth community college anyway.”

Which, according to Tony, ‘shouldn’t even count as real college’. 

“You’re a dick,” Flash laughed. He looked around the flat and prompted Harry to do the same. 

There were entirely too many people there… Harry didn’t even know how more and more people seemed to fit in the flat. 

“Who’s the red-head?” Flash asked, nodding toward one of the twins in the living room. 

“Fred or George,” Harry said. “I can’t tell from here; if he’s got a freckle under his left eye, it’s Fred. If not, it’s George.”

Flash hummed and then hopped off the counter and gave Harry a playful salute. 

“If he asks, I’m a great guy,” he said. 

Harry raised his eyebrows, “Sure, I’ll lie to one of my best mates for the sake of a bloke who acts like a prat.”

“Thanks.” Flash slapped Harry’s shoulder, which Harry was actually getting rather sick of people doing, then took off with a slice of pizza and a grin toward the living room. 

 

As much as Harry had worried about seeing so many people, it turned out his wheelchair was the least insane part of the impromptu party. 

 

Sleepin here. Hope pepper loves u. Cu later alllligator.

 

Harry woke up the next morning with a headache pounding inside his skull, the warm weight of someone on his chest, and momentary concern that he had no idea where he was. 

It took a loud cough for Harry to lift his head up enough to see Peter standing in the doorway of a bedroom, a green potion in his hand, and a grin on his face. 

“I pass out on a couch and you replace me?” he said. “I’m hurt, Bright Eyes.”

Harry blinked at him very slowly before looking down and seeing that Ron was sound asleep with his head on Harry’s chest and one long arm thrown over him. Ron was snoring and Harry was rather disgusted by the puddle of drool he was leaving on Harry’s chest. 

“I’ll dump him here and now if that’s a hangover potion,” Harry rasped out. “And, er, if you can get him off me? He’s heavy.”

Peter pressed the potion in Harry’s hand before…

Harry bit his lip to hold back a noise at the way Peter just lifted Ron like he weighed nothing and deposited him on the other bed in the bedroom. 

“That was hot,” Harry whispered to Peter with a grin. “My hero.” 

“Man, as much as I love hearing you say that, you’re about to hate me,” Peter said. “Your dad’s in the living room, I’m not sure how impressed he is with us right now.”

Harry was sure he paled some even as he quickly drank the potion and his headache and general queasiness disappeared. 

Tony knew they’d had a party, he knew they’d been drinking… 

“Fuck,” Harry whispered. He shouldn’t have drank, he should have stayed alert and made sure nobody did anything stupid that would piss Tony off. 

They’d locked the room that led to the quidditch field, Jarvis never would have let anyone on any of the other floors… Harry actually had no idea what could have happened that would make Tony mad. 

Peter unfolded Harry’s chair for him and Harry quickly slid in it, needing to go face the music. 

 

Tony was standing just inside the living room, sticking close to the doors to the lifts- probably because there were about half a dozen teenagers passed out on the living room floor. 

Harry tried to smile, but as Tony’s face was entirely blank, he was sure his smile looked at least partially terrified. 

“Kid, when I trust you to do things, you have to do them,” Tony said sternly when Harry was right in front of him. “I know you don’t love the medicine, but missing doses can—”

“Wait, what?” Harry lifted his head then and stared at Tony. “You’re mad that I didn’t take my medicine yet this morning?”

“Or last night,” Tony said. He held out an uncurled fist and Harry saw his morning pills in it and he quickly grabbed them and swallowed them dry. 

“I…” Harry looked over his shoulder at the mess that covered the flat along with the people everywhere. 

“I’m sorry,” Harry told Tony, meaning it. Harry felt guilty that Tony had let him have a party and the one thing that Harry was supposed to do, he didn’t. 

Tony relaxed some from his stiff stance and he grinned at Harry. “I’m not mad, to be clear, but you’re going to make yourself sick by skipping doses of your medicine. I’ll have Jarvis remind you from now on, in case we forget, okay?”

Harry nodded, that was fair. “Er… can he not say it’s for medicine?” he asked awkwardly. “Maybe just… could he just beep at me or something?”

“I’ll have him send an alert to your phone and if you don’t answer it within five minutes then he can beep at you,” Tony said. He raised a brow as he looked past Harry to the mess. “Good party?”

Harry shrugged sheepishly. “We’ll clean up, I swear. Oh! How was your date?”

All at once, Tony’s entire face went lax and his eyes sparkled while his lips curled up in a soft smile. 

“Amazing,” he said, sounding like such a sap that Harry didn’t even have the heart to tease him. “Pep wants to go downtown tonight, see the lights and the Christmas stuff they’ve got set up. Think you can rouse your little band of rebels and meet us in the lobby by five?”

Harry agreed and then quickly pushed himself up, able to stand on one leg for just a moment while he impulsively hugged Tony. 

“Thanks,” Harry said, hoping that Tony knew what all Harry was thanking him for—

For bringing Harry’s friends to New York. 

For reminding Harry about his medicine without screaming or belittling Harry. 

For… for everything, Harry supposed. 

Tony’s smile was even wider as he carefully helped Harry sit back down. 

“Anytime, kid,” he said fondly. “Want me to send breakfast down here?”

Harry looked behind him and saw that Peter had reclined back on one of the chairs and looked like he was headed back to sleep. 

“I’ll come up,” Harry decided. “I want to hear about your date. They can text me when they wake up and get hungry.”

Tony lit up and immediately jumped in the story before they even got on the lifts. Harry listened with a stupid smile of his own, rather pleased to see Tony so excited and happy. 

Harry supposed neither of them had really had much reason to be happy lately, but Merlin had Harry missed quiet moments of just talking and laughing with his dad recently.

Chapter Text

Tuesday, December 20

As a general life rule, Tony didn’t like kids. 

They were loud, annoying, messy, and they touched things.

Harry’s band of friends were no exception and Tony had to grit his teeth and bear it when the teens ran up and down the stairs, switching between his and Harry’s floor and the one he very specifically made just for them to stay on. 

The twins, as terribly amusing as they were, were so loud. Tony didn’t even know that two people could be so loud. But they were even louder when they refused to use the stairs or the elevator and they just popped loudly from floor to floor. 

Hermione was a smart girl, something Tony could appreciate, but she also talked so ungodly much . She would ask fifty-two questions before Tony even finished a single cup of coffee and then move on to an entirely new topic before Tony could even register what any of her questions had been about. 

Luna was a funny girl, quiet and a little air-headed, but Tony also couldn’t understand half of what she did say. She told him that he had wrackspurts, but not as many as Harry, and that Tony had a ‘lovely lavender aura’. Luna also kept carrying her pet tarantula around, which never failed to make Ron scramble away from her with a green sheen to his face. 

Ron and Ginny weren’t terrible houseguests, not really. Yeah, they were loud and Ginny had a habit of tackling Ron at random moments, leading to impromptu wrestling matches held anywhere and anytime. And Ron left crumbs everywhere . Tony didn’t even think he had to be eating something to leave crumbs behind him. But they didn’t go out of their way to bother him like the others seemed to purposely do. 

The worst part was quidditch. 

For the love of science, Tony didn’t think that he had heard so much about quidditch in his entire life as much as he did after just three days of Harry’s friends being there. 

Sirius himself kept showing up and contributing to the quidditch talk. Apparently, it was the only sport in the ass-backwards wizarding world. Tony shouldn’t be surprised by that, since they didn’t even use central air conditioning, but did all of them have to be so obsessed with the sport?

Even the little brainiac girl and Petey both seemed willing to discuss positions, point-spreads, statistics, and teams with the others. 

Tony would have hidden away in his lab, avoiding all the quidditch-obsessed, noise-making, things-touching teenagers, but Harry wouldn’t let him. 

Every time Tony started to make his way to the lab, Harry would look at him with a grin and draw Tony in the conversation somehow. 

“Dad, you wanna hear about the Wronski Feint?”

“Hey, Dad, listen to what George found out about Oliver! So Oliver was our quidditch captain…”

‘Dad’ was the most manipulative word that Tony ever heard and it worked every damn time. 

 

“How’s it going?” Pepper asked Tony over the phone on just the second night of the invaders being present. 

“Ugh.” Tony threw himself in his bed with a dramatic groan. “Pep, I hope you only want the one future step-kid because I can’t handle any more.”

Pepper laughed, a joyful sound in Tony’s ear.

“Surely they can’t be that bad,” she said. “You just aren’t used to having more than one kid around.”

“They never stop talking or touching things or breathing,” Tony stressed. “I never realized how perfect Harry was until now. So unless we find a way to clone him, I think he’s doomed to be an only child.”

“And here I thought we’d have half a dozen kids with your brains and my looks,” Pepper said, her voice coy and lighting up a spark of joy inside Tony. 

It had always been Tony pursuing Pepper with corny jokes and glib remarks about their future. And now… now Pepper was the one who said ‘we’. 

“Mm…” Tony rolled on his stomach and reached for his nightstand drawer, pulling out the 2.5 carat, beautifully extravagant engagement ring with the silver band that he desperately wanted to present to Pepper for Christmas. 

“Half a dozen kids, you say?” Tony asked her, staring at the twinkling ring that would fit the fourth finger on Pepper’s left hand so perfectly. “Tell ya what, if they get my good looks, your brains, and Harry’s ability to not make my ears bleed with his chatter… you’ve got yourself a deal.”

Tony could hear the smile in Pepper’s voice when she responded. 

“We’ll see what we can do,” she told him. “Goodnight, Mister Stark.”

“Goodnight, Miss Potts,” Tony replied, wondering how long it would be until he could change that. 

‘Mrs Stark’ sounded much better and Tony would even give Pepper six kids if that’s what it took for her to marry him. 

 

It was a relief when Harry’s physical therapy appointment rolled around, the only appointment that Tony stood his ground on Harry still attending over the Christmas break, and the two of them got to leave the Tower and the other kids behind. 

“We’re driving you mad, aren’t we?” Harry asked as soon as Tony pulled the car out of the garage. Tony looked over and saw that the bright smile that had been painted on Harry’s face the last few days had dimmed and he looked unreasonably nervous.

“I’m sorry,” Harry went on, rambling like Tony did when he was anxious. “I tried to keep them all out of our place, but then I didn’t want to not see you, and they just kept coming upstairs and they’re very hard to tell ‘piss off’ when they’re so excited about the Xbox and CHOW and Luna loves Joey. I want to spend time with all of you, but there’s only one of me, and I can tell they’re driving you barmy, but I’m sorry.”

“Pause, breathe.” Tony flashed Harry a smile when Harry took a pause for air. “Kid, they’re supposed to be annoying, they’re teenagers. You’re not annoying, for the record,” he added quickly before Harry could question it. “But you’re mine, so I assume it’s a genetic stroke of luck that you’re not as—”

“Annoying as the others?” Harry cut in with a grimace. “I’m sorry, Dad, I’ll tell them to stay out of our place.” 

“No, don’t,” Tony said immediately. “I’m pretty sure it’s normal for old men like me to be grouchy when I’m surrounded by you youthful people who never stop talking ,” he finished in a dramatic groan, at least getting a short chuckle from Harry. “Honestly, Harry, you’re so quiet that I forget other teens can make so much noise. And, while I’m thinking about it, what the hell are wrackspurts and why do you have so many?!” 

“So you admit that you’re old?” Harry smirked. 

“That would be what you’d pick up on first,” Tony grumbled playfully. 

Harry laughed and the moment of tension between them disappeared. Tony would have been much more irritated by the noisy invaders, but the constant smiles on Harry’s face were more than an equal compensation. 

 

The two hours that Tony spent in the waiting lounge with Wilson, designing upgrades and venturing in further reach for their prosthetics, was a sort of heaven for Tony though. 

No quidditch. 

No wrackspurts.

Just… adult conversation and crappy coffee. 

“You have no idea how much I needed this,” Tony said when he knew that Anderson would be finishing up soon with Harry not far behind. Tony packed away his laptop and tablet in his bag and Wilson handed him the drafts he’d drawn for more economically friendly materials to be used in the prosthetics. 

“Is it all chaos in Stark Tower?” Wilson guessed. “Harry getting hyped for Christmas?”

“Harry’s hyped for Christmas and Harry’s friends are all just hyper,” Tony told him. “I’ve got eight kids staying until the third. Did you know that teenagers eat a lot? I’m not talking about just at meals either, I mean they eat constantly! And is an inside voice something that develops later in life? Because they are so damned loud.” 

Wilson laughed and stood up to stretch his arms over his head, popping his back loudly. 

“Man, I think teenagers and vets are the same people. I’ve got three extra houseguests for the next week, getting some of the guys through the holidays. Lawrence, Green, and Jones don’t have anyone or anywhere to go. It’s a hard time for them, you know?” Wilson shrugged humbly, as if he wasn’t taking in veterans during the holiday season out of the kindness of his heart. 

“I’d offer to take some too, but I think they might be more suicidal after listening to a constant recap of the most complicated sport in the world,” Tony quipped. He held up his hand when Wilson began to ask the obvious question. “Trust me, you don’t want to know.”

“I’ll take your word for it,” Wilson laughed. He looked toward the doorway and Tony saw Anderson leaning against the wall, looking more run-down from his therapy than usual. 

“How’s the leg holding up?” Tony asked him. “Any pains or discomfort?”

“Nope.” Anderson slapped his hand on his leg, causing a clunk to echo around them. “This baby’s been taking me places.”

“Anywhere good?” Tony asked with a knowing smile.

Anderson’s lips curled to the side in a smirk. “So many very bad places.” 

Tony laughed and accepted Wilson’s parting pat on the back. 

“Well you have my number, let me know if it starts to act up or cause you any pain,” Tony told him. “Have a good Christmas, guys.”

“You too, Tony,” Wilson said. “Try not to let the kids drive you crazy, I’ve heard some parents say they miss those days later on.”

Tony assumed those parents meant they missed when their own kids were teenagers, not their kid’s friends. 

 

Harry was just as tired as Anderson seemed after his therapy ended. He was quiet on the drive home, withdrawn, and hesitated when Tony opened his door for Harry to slide in his wheelchair. 

“I fell,” Harry said. He stared down at his lap where he was twisting his fingers around and admitted it quietly, like he was ashamed. It took everything inside of Tony to not panic - Harry was obviously fine, there was no reason to start asking fifty questions and overwhelm him - and he waited for Harry to get the rest of his thoughts out. 

“Anderson told me I should push myself even though Doctor Torres said I shouldn’t be trying to walk with the crutches yet and she went to take a call, she said she’d be right back, and…”

“And you tried to walk and you fell?” Tony guessed. Harry nodded his head, still not looking at him. “Are you hurt?”

“I’m going to cry and it’s not because I’m in pain,” Harry said, speaking through a clenched jaw. “And I’m sorry for whining, but I don’t want to do it in front of my friends.”

Tony moved the wheelchair away and knelt down beside the open car door. He reached over and took Harry’s hands in his, hating to see him fidgeting so hard. 

“Okay,” he said calmly, “what’s going on?” 

“I know you’re bloody sick of hearing about quidditch, but all my friends play it, and I was good at it, Dad.” Harry’s voice was choked up and Tony smoothed his thumbs over the tops of Harry’s hands, silently reassuring him that he was there and listening. A tear dropped from Harry’s cheek, landing on top of Tony’s hand, and Tony’s heart broke some. 

“I was the youngest seeker in a century and now I can’t even take two steps with crutches. How- how am I supposed to fly, Dad?” Harry looked over at him and Tony hated the miserable look in his eyes, the tears welling at the rim and leaking over. 

“And now we’ve got a perfect pitch - something that Ron and Ginny would crucio a baby for a chance to have - and I can’t fly. I can’t walk, I can’t fly , and it’s so bloody selfish but I can’t sit on the pitch and watch them fly while I’m stuck on the bloody ground!” 

Harry’s voice broke at the end and Tony wasn’t sure if he reached for Harry or if Harry reached for him, but Tony gave Harry a twisted hug while Harry cried about the loss of a sport that he so obviously loved and Tony tried to find a way to fix it. 

When Sirius designed and built the pitch, neither he nor Tony thought that Harry would struggle to fly. Sure, they thought it might take him a moment to find a new readjustment of his weight on the broom, but Sirius had been confident that Harry could do it. 

Tony wouldn’t have put it in the tower if he knew that it was just going to be a miserable reminder to Harry of yet another thing he lost. 

“Have you tried to fly yet?” Tony asked when Harry’s cries calmed to wet sniffles. He pulled away from Harry and winced at the ache in his knees from the concrete beneath them. 

“No point,” Harry said flatly. “I can’t walk, I can’t fly. I’ll just- I’ll fall, I just know I will. I’ll fall and everyone will get worried and then they won’t fly while they’re here because I can’t and I don’t want to ruin everything for everyone.”

God, the kid definitely got his selflessness from Lily. Tony never would have considered his friends’ comfort if he were in Harry’s… shoe. 

Tony tried to picture the physical demands of flying, the physics that went into balancing and staying seated on turns and twists and ‘wronski feints’. It was all physics, weight distribution and angles…

“Let’s get upstairs,” Tony said in a murmur while he tried to picture the flight with his mind. “You want me to clear the cretins from our place so you can rest?”

Harry hesitated after getting in his chair so Tony made the decision for him, to take away any guilt he might have for it. 

“You’re grounded for the next two hours,” Tony told him. Harry didn’t grab his wheels so Tony pushed the wheelchair for him. “Two hours of no friends, no spider-brat, and just a pain reliever and sleep.”

Harry looked over his shoulder at Tony and gave him a small smile that didn’t reach his tired eyes. 

“Thanks, Dad.”

It felt natural to bend his head down, press a quick kiss to the top of Harry’s head. 

“Anytime, kid.”

 

As soon as Harry was asleep in his bed, Tony strolled down the the next floor to barge in on the teens for once. 

“Good afternoon, demons and destroyers of peace.” Tony grinned at the cluster of kids sprawled out on the furniture, all watching some cheesy looking Christmas movie. 

Peter sat up quickly and twisted his neck around. “Where’s Harry?”

“Sleeping, so nobody bother him,” Tony told them all. He pointed at each of them and begrudgingly laughed when Luna pointed back at him just as seriously. 

“I have a top secret mission that I need your help with,” Tony announced. “If you know how to shut your mouth, you can help. If you can’t keep a secret to save your life, go find something else to do.”

“I can keep a secret!” Luna said immediately, waving her hand in the air. “Nobody ever talks to me, so there’s nobody for me to tell!”

“Tragic, and you’re in,” Tony said evenly. “Anyone else?”

“Peter dated Harry under an alter-ego, so he’s in,” Ron said. 

“And we all lived in a secret house for a whole summer,” Ginny said brightly. “So we’re all in.”

“Follow me,” Tony said. He led the teens to the quidditch pitch and threw the door open with a flourish. “The goal today is: how do we get Harry back on a broom? And failure is not an option.”

 

As annoying as the gaggle of teens were, they made up for it as they all spent three hours hard at work, helping Tony find a way for Harry to fly. Tony started to see what Harry must have seen in Harry’s friends while they helped him. 

Hermione, as inquisitive and bossy as she was, went right to work with Peter, drafting up graphs of weight distribution on broomsticks. The twins put their theatrics to use as they took turns flying around the field with one leg bent and tucked beneath them, crashing over and over while they tried to find a way to land. Ron and Ginny followed Tony’s lead, trying out different positions and bringing him different broomsticks to tinker with. 

Luna was an unexpected pleasure when she started a story about Minfrings, some sort of one-legged creature that Tony wasn’t sure actually existed. The story wasn’t actually helpful in the slightest, but Luna’s agreement to go fetch Tony’s toolkit from his lab was. 

And with the kids’ help, Tony was able to have a broomstick for Harry to test out when he woke up and the others weren’t around. 

“As repayment for your valiant efforts, I am gifting you with passes to get the hell out of my house tonight,” Tony said when they were all high-fiving each other with their success. “Petey, I’m trusting you with my credit card and the SUV. Take everyone to the movies and out to dinner.”

“Yes, sir,” Peter said, giving Tony a sloppy salute after accepting the card. “Lobster and sushi, right?”

Tony considered how happy Harry would be to fly again and shrugged with a smile. 

“Whatever you want,” he told him. “As long as it keeps you all busy late enough that Harry can fly without an audience.”

Luna Lovegood was becoming Tony’s second favorite teenager when she gave him a tight hug and told Tony that he was an excellent dad. 

 

Although then she started talking about nargle infestations in the walls and Tony briefly considered jumping out a window to get away from the noise.

Chapter Text

Harry sat in his wheelchair just inside the ‘Stark Quidditch Pitch’ and lectured himself sternly in his head while he kept his face entirely blank. 

He was not going to cry. He was not going to cry. 

Tony had something he seemed excited to show Harry and Harry could do him the decency of at least looking at it. It was cruel, bringing Harry straight from his bedroom to the one place he’d just told Tony earlier that he wanted to avoid, but Harry would look at what Tony wanted to show him and then go hide out to lick his wounds for a while. 

“Close your eyes!” Tony said with something hidden behind his back. “Come on, kid, close them,” he grinned when Harry stared deadpan at him. 

Harry sighed loudly before closing his eyes. 

“Three… two… open them!” 

Harry opened his eyes and blinked at the broomstick Tony had brandished in front of him. 

It was a Firebolt with the gleaming handle and perfect bristles, but it was also altered and messed with, adding blemishes to the perfection. There were metal bars attached to the top of the handle, golden looking handlebars like bicycles had. Then attached to the body of the broom, there was a matching golden attachment that looked like something mixed between a basket and a stirrup. 

“What…” Harry’s throat was dry and he had to swallow to make it work properly. “What is this?”

“This is the first ever Harry-friendly Firebolt!” Tony declared. Harry ripped his eyes from the broom to look up at his dad and saw that he was beaming. 

“I- I’ll fall,” Harry protested. Harry wanted to fly, God, he wanted to fly more than anything, but he couldn’t land or steer or— or fly at all. 

Harry didn’t used to be afraid of falling, but every time he thought about soaring through the sky, he imagined falling and hitting the ground like he had when he jumped from the car. And Harry already lost one leg, he’d hate to lose the other one. 

“You won’t,” Tony said. He dropped to one knee in front of Harry and began showing him the features he’d added. “Look, the handlebars are for extra grip so you have more leverage. And this,” Tony turned the broom so Harry could see the metal stirrup, “this is to rest your leg—”

“Stump.”

“To rest your thigh in,” Tony went on without missing a beat. “And the entire pitch has - I honestly hate saying this - an anti-gravity charm that is somehow keyed to this broom. Watch!”

Tony stood up then and held the broom up high then dropped it. The broom dropped until it was at Tony’s waist and then it stopped to just hover. 

“Crash proof!” Tony said, clearly pleased with the mixture of magic and science. “And I sent all the demons away so that you could take the new broom for a test ride without an audience.” 

“I… can’t,” Harry said, feeling guilty that Tony had clearly worked so hard on something for him. Harry just got the hang of the exercises that Strange taught him to keep from feeling fire burning his leg constantly. 

“One flight around the room?” Tony asked. He stuck his lower lip out and made his eyes go all big and sad. “Please? For your old man?” 

Harry let out a huff of defeat. “Are you going to irritate the hell out of me if I don’t?”

Tony kept up the pouting face and nodded pathetically. 

“If I fall?” Harry asked, trying to sound scornful instead of scared. 

“Do you trust me?” Tony asked, dropping the act to stare Harry straight in the eyes. Harry hesitated for a moment. 

It wasn’t Tony that Harry didn’t trust… It was Harry himself. He was reckless, rash, and a literal danger to himself. But Tony wasn’t… not really. 

The wormhole incident was a bit iffy though. 

“Alright,” Harry said slowly. “If I fall, I’m telling Pepper it was your fault.” 

“There’s the manipulative spirit!” Tony said. He jumped up to his feet and offered Harry his hands. “Stand up real slow and then just climb on. If the stirrup isn’t comfortable, I can adjust it. I really just thought the gold looked flashy.” 

“I like the gold,” Harry agreed. If anything should be flashy, it should be a broomstick. 

Tony helped Harry get to his foot and then Harry used his shoulder to steady himself so he could mount the broom. The stirrup was uncomfortable, but Harry wouldn’t have complained. 

“I’ll fix it,” Tony said, somehow reading the discomfort in Harry’s eyes. “If it’s not terrible, mind circling the field once so I can make any other adjustments at once?” 

Harry closed his eyes and took a deep and slow breath. 

“Hey.”

Harry opened his eyes and Tony stood just in front of where Harry hovered. 

“I’m not going to let you fall,” he said solemnly. Harry nodded and then leaned forward, grabbing the handlebars attached to off-set the way he felt incredibly off balanced, and then he kicked off with his right foot. 

 

And it was incredible .

 

Harry let out a shout of laughter when he was able to lean on his left side and turn without slipping off. 

“IT WORKS!” Harry yelled to Tony, exhilarated to be back in the air. “DAD! WATCH!” 

Harry did a barrel roll on his broom, his fear of falling left behind on the ground. 

“Do the wonky frank thing you were talking about!” Tony called to him, a smile on his face as well. 

Harry went as high as he could, marveling at the amount of magic Sirius must have put in the room. When Harry was above the goal posts, he lingered for a moment, a feeling of rightness filling him. 

Then Harry dove straight down, mimicking what he considered to be the greatest seeker feint in history. 

Tony began running toward where Harry dove but it didn’t matter because Harry pulled up on the handles just before he could hit the ground and wound up three feet from the ground- perfectly unharmed. 

“That was amazing! Terrifying, I think I have at least one gray hair now, but amazing!” Tony laughed. 

Harry laughed as well and made an awkward motion, trying to get Tony to help him off his broom and on his foot. As soon as he was standing, Harry threw his arms around Tony, not for support, but in genuine gratitude. 

“Thank you,” Harry said. He swallowed past the annoying lump in his throat. “I love it and- and you.” 

Tony hugged Harry back just as tightly. “And I love you, kid.” 

Harry couldn’t be entirely sure, but he thought that Tony was probably the best parent a one-legged kid who loved to fly could have. 

 

The very next morning, Harry found the broom his dad made laying against the wall where his medicine was stored. The stirrup had a thin cushion where Harry’s stump would rest. 

Tony was asleep, but there was a note on the counter telling him that he had breakfast delivered to the ‘kids floor’ and ‘wake him only for emergencies’. 

Harry got dressed and gathered his forearm crutches as soon as he took his medicine. Everyone had been wanting to fly and Harry knew they weren’t because of him, and now they could .

 

“WAKE UP!” Harry yelled when he wheeled off the lift in the flat his friends were all in. Peter was asleep on the couch and he jumped up at once with his hair standing up all crazy and making Harry’s smile nearly become painful. 

And… and he was shirtless…

Harry shifted in his wheelchair and averted his eyes toward something that wasn’t Peter’s incredibly toned body. As much as Anderson bragged about a ‘six-pack’, Harry didn’t think he had anything on Peter. 

“What’s happenin’?” Peter asked as he rubbed his eyes. Harry watched him from the corner of his eyes, certain his face was red if the heat radiating from it was anything to go by. 

“Quidditch,” Harry said. He held up his broom when the twins came barging from one room, Ginny and Luna from another, and Ron and Hermione from the third. 

“Food first,” Ron mumbled, his eyes on the kitchen countertop. “Food then flying.”

“Nah, flying first!” Ginny said. She already had an elastic around her wrist and started pulling her hair up. “Come on, Harry, let’s pick teams!”

Harry, loyally, chose Ron right off the bat. Ron grinned from the kitchen and held up a breakfast burrito in a cheers. 

Ginny, being a twat, then called Peter. 

“That’s my boyfriend!” Harry scowled. 

Ginny smirked and tossed her arm around Peter’s bare shoulders. “Should have called him then.”

“Fine. Then I want Luna,” Harry said wildly, not actually wanting her on his team. Harry liked Luna, much more after getting to spend some time with her, but he had no idea how she was on a broom. It was worth it though, because Luna lit up happily and gave Harry a quick hug that smelled like jasmine. 

“I am very good at flying,” she assured him. “It’s just sometimes I get distracted by clouds.”

“That’s… er… that’s fine,” Harry said. 

“George!” Ginny yelled. 

“Fred!”

Hermione huffed with her arms crossed and a peeved look on her face. 

“I’m not useless, you know,” she said hotly. “I’ve read every quidditch book in Hogwarts and listened to Ron read me manuals all year.”

Harry and Ron shared a quick look across the flat, both thinking of first year Hermione in flying class and the charmed key room beneath Fluffy…

“Yeah, Hermione, you’re right,” Harry said, shockingly able to keep a straight face. “You’re right, Gin’s lucky to have you.”

And Harry was lucky to not. 

 

“Want me to lose on purpose?” Peter whispered to Harry after they ate a quick breakfast and moved to the pitch. Peter was just as distracting in Harry’s extra quidditch jersey, a red and gold Gryffindor one with ‘Potter’ emblazoned on the back, as he’d been shirtless. 

“No,” Harry said firmly. Just because Ginny was a cheat who took the bloke with super-senses didn’t mean that Harry was going to cheat as well. 

“Kiss for luck then?” Peter teased him. Harry pushed him back when Peter bent down and stubbornly worked his crutches until he could stand up. 

“No,” Harry breathed after leaning in close to Peter’s face. Harry laughed after Peter kissed him anyway. “You lot don’t need any extra luck.”

“Too late!” Peter cried. He started jogging backwards to where Ginny was calling for a ‘team meeting’. “Hey, guess what?”

“What?”

“I love quidditch .”

Harry rolled his eyes. “You’ve never played.”

“Doesn’t matter! Already love it!” 

“Ahem!” Ron cleared his throat from right beside Harry, causing Harry to jump guiltily. “If you’re done flirting with the competition, mate…”

“Right.” Harry grinned at Ron and carefully circled himself around to face his team. “Fred, you’re beater.”

“What a surprise!” Fred cried dramatically. 

“Ron, you’re keeper,” Harry said. Ron saluted him with a happy smile. “Luna, you’re—”

“The one with the waffle,” Luna said seriously. “Do I throw it directly at the other team's blocking-person or is that just what Slytherin does?”

Harry snickered at the (probably) unintentional slight against Slytherin. 

“Throw the quaffle through the goalpost,” he told her. “No pressure, but if we don’t win then I’m pulling an Oliver from third year.”

Fred laughed immediately while Luna and Ron looked confused. 

“Drowning myself in the shower,” Harry informed them. “So let’s kick their arses, okay?”

“And have fun?” Fred asked. 

Harry shook his head, “No, no fun allowed. Win or die trying.”

“Oliver would be so proud,” Fred sniffled. He held his broomstick up. “Go Team Legs!”

“TEAM LEGS!” the rest of them echoed loudly. 

 

They lost, rather spectacularly. 

It didn’t matter that Luna was a surprisingly good chaser because Peter was a flawless keeper. And Hermione was terrible , so Harry didn’t even know how good Ron was. The twins had a good time hitting bludgers at everyone, and Harry and Ginny chased the snitch for over an hour while the score stayed at zero. 

The spectacular ending was when Harry tried to pull his broomstick up to do a backflip when he realized he needed to change course for the snitch. Harry was used to leaning to the left when he did backward flips, and didn’t even consider it before he slipped right off the broom and fell a little over ten feet to land on his back. 

“I WIN!” Ginny cried, the snitch in her hand. 

“Oh, who cares?!” Hermione landed near where Harry laid, staring up at the sky dizzily. “Harry? Harry? Are you okay?” 

Peter’s face was in front of Harry’s in an instant and he began pulling him to a sitting position.

“Shit, Harry, are you hurt?” 

Harry shook his head and felt the wind that had been knocked from his lungs finally refilling. 

“I’m fine,” Harry said honestly, if a little breathlessly. Harry grinned at the worried faces around him (ignoring Ginny’s smug face). “I fell and I’m fine.”

“Wellll, you lost,” George smirked. He offered a hand to Harry, pulling him to his foot when Harry quickly grabbed Peter’s nearby shoulder to steady himself. 

Harry did lose, which was annoying, but he also fell. He fell off his broom and he was fine .

“Rematch,” Harry said immediately. “I was rusty, Gin, you won on a technicality.”

Ginny sniffed and flicked her ponytail over her shoulder haughtily. 

“Bring it, Stark.”

 

The others seemed to lose interest after another match, but Harry was content to have a seekers battle with Ginny for the entire day. Ginny caught it once, then Harry twice, then Ginny threw a fit and traded out with Peter. 

“Just catch the snitch?” Peter asked. He and Harry were facing each other on the brooms, both grinning, both with the same competitive light in their eyes. Peter had excellent senses, but he wasn’t a great flier. 

“Just catch the snitch,” Harry confirmed. “Ready, sweetheart ?” he asked sweetly. 

“Ready, lovey ,” Peter said, just as falsely sweet. 

“GO!” 

 

“God, you’re fit.” Harry sat in his wheelchair after going four rounds with Peter and was drenched in sweat and aching in the way that he missed from quidditch matches. 

Peter wasn’t even panting, just sweating enough to give him a sheen that gave Harry a million thoughts and none of them quidditch related.

“Yeah?” Peter grinned crookedly and seemed to purposefully lift his shirt up to wipe his forehead, exposing his abdomen and part of his chest in the move. 

“You’re not hideous, I guess,” Peter winked at Harry. “We should play again, but I’m doing it shirtless so your bright eyes are too distracted to win.”

“TAKE YOUR TOP OFF!” Ginny called from the sidelines. The others had grabbed snacks from the kitchen and decided to have an impromptu picnic while Harry and Peter flew. 

“YEAH, HARRY,” Fred yelled, “TAKE YOUR TOP OFF!” 

Harry laughed and shook his head, he was actually worn out. 

“You can fly topless if you want,” Harry told Peter, trying to sound flirty and not stupid. “I’m gonna take a break.”

“Break it is,” Peter said with a grin. “Want me to push?” 

Harry nodded and then laughed when Peter began pushing him at a run with the front wheels popped up off the ground. 

Tony didn’t just give Harry a broomstick, it was as if he replaced a missing part of him that was much more important than just a leg: quidditch . 

Harry had to text Tony after lunch with a string of sad faces that had Tony calling him immediately. 

“Hey, kid, you okay?”

Harry grinned at his friends that were all sitting around on the furniture in the living room and hitched his voice some. 

“No,” he said in a small voice. “Dad… Hermione’s a terrible flier.”

Tony was silent for a moment while the others covered their snickers and Hermione flipped Harry off. 

“That… sucks?” Tony said slowly, clearly confused. “I’m sorry?”

“How sorry?” Harry asked swiftly. “Sorry enough to come fly with us?”

Tony didn’t even hesitate, “I’ll be there in thirty minutes. Your team against mine, kid. Winner takes all.”

“Deal,” Harry said, thrilled with the new game. “Wait! What exactly is ‘takes all’?” 

“Who cares?” Ginny hissed. “We’ll win.”

“Dream on, kid,” Tony said, sounding cheerful as could be. “I’ll have my team ready to win soon.”

 

Harry thought maybe Tony was going to get Sirius, try and take two spots on the teams, he didn’t expect for the entire bloody team of Avengers (and Harry’s magic tutor?) to show up with broomsticks and bemused expressions. 

“You’ve got an extra person,” Ginny said after counting all of them quickly. “Someone’s going to have to sit out with Hermione.”

“I volunteer,” Bruce said immediately. He looked entirely too relieved to step to the side, flashing Hermione a smile. “We can do commentary or something.”

“Oh, thank God,” Hermione breathed as she skipped away. 

Harry twisted his lips when Sirius smirked at him with Clint, Pietro, Psycho, and Strange around him. Tony managed to get Pepper there as well (though Harry suspected that Pepper had already been at their flat and that was why Tony didn’t want to be bothered that morning).

“This is going to be excellent,” Fred laughed. He and George looked gleeful as they smashed their beaters bats in their hands. “Do any of you muggles even know how to fly?” 

Strange scoffed and immediately floated up toward the charmed sky, looking arrogant with his red cape flying him. 

“Oh, I’m sorry, did you need a broomstick?” Strange smirked. “Poor wizard .”

“You’re keeper then, sorcerer ,” Sirius told him with a wide smile. “Clint, Pietro, you’re beaters. Nat, Pepper, you’re chasers with me. Tony—”

“Seeker, right?” Tony asked, winking at Harry. “Stark against Stark, kid, no question on who the better man is.”

“Harry,” Pepper said immediately with a light laugh. “Will someone show me how to fly?” 

Harry’s team moved out in the flat so Sirius could have a ‘team meeting’ and ‘debrief’ them all on how to fly. While they waited, it was easy to divide up his players. 

“Peter’s keeper, Ron, Luna, Ginny, you’re chasers—”

“I’m seeker of course,” George said, puffing his chest out. “Youngest one in a century, I’ll have you know.”

“Oi! Be serious,” Harry said, perhaps getting too competitive. “Do not hit Pepper with a bludger, but try and hit Psycho as many times as you can, got it?” 

As soon as the twins nodded, Harry stuck his hand in the middle. 

“If we lose to them, I’m going to have to hear about it for the rest of my life,” Harry told them all. “Which means you lot will hear about it for the rest of your lives.”

“Mate, you really miss quidditch, don’t you?” Ron asked. “I forgot how bloody competitive you are.”

“Win or die trying,” Ginny said, her voice echoing Harry’s own fervor. “Peter, if you let a single quaffle in, Harry’s going to break up with you.”

“And if you get distracted by clouds, Ginny’s breaking up with you,” Harry warned Luna. 

“Oh.” Luna blinked and gave Ginny a sweet smile. “Are we dating?”

Ginny sighed fondly and nodded. “Yes, Luna. I asked you to be my girlfriend, remember?”

Luna shrugged, “I thought that we were just friends. I’m quite glad though, you’re very beautiful.”

“Everyone ready?” Harry asked, smirking at Ginny’s suddenly red face. He waited until the others put their hands in the middle with him. “Go team!” 

 

“Ladies and Gentlemen, today we have the most absurd match ever.” Hermione’s voice echoed around the pitch with the muggle megaphone that Bruce got for her. “On the - for the love of God, quit letting Harry name the teams! - on team crips , we have Luna, Ginny, Ron as chasers, Peter ‘the Spider’ Parker as keeper, the twins as beaters, and Harry as seeker.”

Harry laughed when the twins and Peter began making broad waves and whistles for themselves. 

“And for team blood,” Bruce sighed loudly, “seriously? We’re encouraging gang warfare? Whatever. On the team that’s too old to be so juvenile, Tony’s playing seeker, Natasha, Pepper, and Sirius are chasers, Stephen is keeper, and Pietro and Clint are beaters.”

Pietro tried to wave his bat and Harry and Ginny laughed a bit ruder than necessary when he nearly fell off his broom. 

“Bloody hell, this is going to be a breeze,” Ginny whispered to Harry. “Catch the snitch before one of them breaks a hip.”

“Will do,” Harry smirked. Everyone floated higher and Harry restrained from laughing at the way Pietro clung to the broom and Clint didn’t seem to understand how to carry the bat without falling off his broom. 

“AND… GO!” Hermione screamed from the ground. 

Harry shot off immediately, Tony following beside him. 

“Everything feel okay?” Tony called, laying forward and looking comfortable. 

“Feels great,” Harry said honestly. “Sorry, Dad, can’t talk, gotta win.”

“So be it,” Tony smirked. 

Harry’s jaw dropped when Tony suddenly shot forward at a ridiculous speed, something boosted by the Iron Man boots he had on.

“YOU CHEATER!” Harry screamed at his father. “FINE! I WAS GOING TO TAKE IT EASY ON YOU!”

“You were going to take it easy on me?” Tony shouted over his shoulder. “I wasn’t.”

Despite the fact that Tony’s entire team was made up of muggles (aside from Sirius and Strange) Harry had to grind his teeth at their… annoying adequacy. 

Sure, Tony was cheating with his thrusters. And, no, Strange shouldn’t have been allowed to open portals when the quaffles flew to him, sending them right back at the Harry’s chasers who threw them. But at least Harry got to see Fred hit Psycho with a bludger three times in a row. 

Pepper mostly floated off to the side and carried on a conversation with Luna, which Harry was fine with. He’d rather not see Pepper get hurt anyway and she didn’t seem very steady on her broom. 

By the time Harry caught the snitch, barely getting it before Tony could, Harry’s team only won by a measly twenty points. It had still been the best game Harry ever played, even if Tony’s entire team were cheaters. 

Sirius was a bloody poor sport; because when he landed he was sobbing and nearly knocked Harry’s entire wheelchair over when he tackled him in a hug. 

“You’ve got no idea how much I’ve always wanted to fly with you,” Sirius cried loudly, embarrassing the hell out of Harry. “I- I love you, kiddo. You know that, right?” Sirius pulled away and Harry was struck with the very uncomfortable face of his godfather covered in tears while his eyes gleamed. “There is nobody in this entire universe I love more than you.”

“I… okay,” Harry whispered. “Fuck, Siri. Are you alright?”

“He’s drunk,” Strange said immediately, popping up at Sirius’ side. “Martinis for breakfast and margaritas for lunch weren’t our best decision.”

Harry shook his head when Strange led Sirius away, their heads bent together and whispering quickly. Harry should probably have a talk with Sirius about drinking so much… it wasn’t healthy. 

 

Since Harry’s team won, Tony said dinner was on him. It was kind, if a little bit pointless since Tony always paid for dinner… 

Everyone piled in a few different cars to go out for dinner and Harry forced himself to get in Peter’s car. If he was fine flying, he would be fine in Peter’s car. 

Fred and Pietro wound up in the backseat and Peter glanced hesitantly at Harry before turning the car on. 

“You sure?” Peter asked quietly. 

“Yeah,” Harry said, much braver than he felt. “Does your radio do the Bluetooth thing?” he asked, changing the subject to something that didn’t make him want to throw up. 

Peter scoffed playfully and kicked the car on, the motor humming loudly. 

“Bright Eyes, I spent a fortune on this baby, Bluetooth was the first thing I checked.”

Harry cracked his window when Peter took off after the other cars, letting the cold air keep him grounded, and then focused entirely on the radio to keep his mind busy. 

“What is this?” Fred yelled once Harry had his phone connected to the radio and Peter’s playlist playing. 

“Fall Out Boy!” Harry said. 

Fred whooped. “I love it!” 

“I also love Fall Out Boy ,” Peter said, winking at Harry. 

Harry rolled his eyes again, though he felt mildly less panicky when Peter reached over and held Harry’s hand. 

And, Harry made it just fine to the restaurant without doing anything more than sweating and privately worrying that perhaps Peter would crash or any of the other many things that he considered while they drove.


Dinner was loud, chaotic, rowdy, and Harry loved every moment of it. 

Surrounded by all his best mates, his family, and… and Psycho… Harry thought that he’d never been truly happier. 

Sirius and Ginny were laughing their arses off as they flicked food at Ron and Strange. Hermione and Bruce were talking rapid-fire to each other, both lit up with a familiar and manic ‘Hermione was missorted’ type of light. Fred and Pietro were getting along famously, laughing and swapping jokes whispered in each other's ears. Even George seemed to be having fun as he arm-wrestled Clint. 

Harry grinned as he watched Tony and Pepper flirt, both of them smiling and blushing like first years. 

“You look happy, Bright Eyes,” Peter said to Harry. He was sitting on Harry’s right side and Harry blushed himself when Peter’s hand landed on his thigh beneath the table. 

Harry looked over at Peter and felt all his joy, all his sense of rightness, all his bloody overwhelming happiness bubbling up inside him. 

“I love you,” Harry blurted out before immediately turning a fiery red and scowling. “Fuck, wait, I didn’t mean to say that.”

“Too late!” Peter cried dramatically. He slapped his hand over Harry’s mouth and they ignored the curious looks from the others at their antics. “You said it! Hey, hey, Fred!”

Fred glanced up from where he’d been showing Pietro a trick wand under the table. 

“Yeah?”

“Harry loves me,” Peter said. Harry licked his hand and then shoved his shoulder hard with a scowl after Peter pulled his hand off Harry’s mouth. 

“Shut up,” Harry hissed, avoiding everyone’s giggles and looks. “I take it back, I hate you.”

“No take backs!” Peter said. He threw his arm around Harry’s shoulders and pulled him to his side. “Ha ha, you love me.”

“Speaking of love…”

Harry was relieved, and terribly amused, when he saw Tony stand up at the opposite end of the table just before dropping to one knee in front of Pepper. It certainly took the immediate spotlight off Harry’s embarrassing admission. 

And Harry didn’t know for sure what love was, not really, but he knew that Peter made him as happy as Tony, Sirius, Pepper, Ron, and Hermione did, so he figured it was love. 

“They’ve had one date,” Peter whispered to Harry, sounding shocked. Harry shushed him, not wanting to miss a word of his dad proposing. 

Tony pulled a ring box from his jacket pocket and held it up while Pepper gasped and covered her mouth with her hand. 

“Virginia Potts—”

Harry actually had no idea that Pepper wasn’t Pepper’s real name…

“I never want to go on a first date with anyone ever again,” Tony declared, his voice ringing loudly and confidently. “Pep, you know all my flaws and you’ve never done anything aside from stand by me, support me, and kick my ass when I needed it. I’ve loved you for years and I know in my heart that you and I were meant to be. Would you, Miss Potts, do me the indescribable honor of becoming Mrs Stark and joining my family?”

Pepper’s eyes were filled with tears when she looked away from Tony, directly to Harry. Harry was feeling a bit choked up himself and he nodded when he saw a question in her eyes. 

Pepper was already family, it would just make it official. 

“You are an impulsive, brash, fool,” Pepper said to Tony, her voice hitching on a cry. “And I would love to spend a lifetime kicking your ass in shape.” 

Tony slid the ring on Pepper’s hand while everyone, Harry the loudest, began cheering and whistling. Tony stood up and pulled Pepper in for a dramatic kiss where he leaned her back in a showy dip. The two of them both ran to Harry with blinding smiles and hugged him. 

“Good surprise?” Tony whispered to Harry while they hugged and Peter congratulated Pepper. “I was going to do it on Christmas, talk to you first, get—”

“Perfect surprise,” Harry assured him, cutting off Tony’s nervous rambling. “I’m so happy for you, Dad.”

“I don’t think I’ve ever been happier,” Tony confided quietly. “I love you so damn much, Harry.”

Harry cried, but so did Tony, so he wasn’t too embarrassed. 

 

Tony ‘banned’ Harry to the floor with his friends that night, and Harry quite cheerfully took the sofa with Peter. 

“Do you really love me?” Peter asked when it was dark and the two of them were cuddling together while a movie played quietly on the telly. Harry grinned tiredly at the note of vulnerability in Peter’s voice, that was usually Harry’s insecurity. 

“Yeah,” Harry breathed, his head over Peter’s heart. “Do you… are you sure you love me?”

“From the first time we met,” Peter said solemnly. “Remind me to get your parents something extra special for their wedding, I have to impress two of them now.”

Harry laughed and smacked him playfully before he turned his head so he could press his lips right above Peter’s heart, directly on his bare chest. 

“I’m already impressed,” Harry murmured. “Quiet now, I’m sleeping.”

Peter groaned and kissed the top of Harry’s head. 

“You’re killing me, Bright Eyes.”

It was funny because Harry thought he’d never felt more alive . 

 

Harry was smiling like an idiot all morning on Christmas Eve. 

While Harry had slept, Tony and Happy went and cut down two giant fir trees, one for Tony’s floor and one for the one that Harry’s friends were staying on. Then Sirius, Pietro, and Strange (who Harry suspected was shagging his godfather…) arrived with boxes and boxes of decorations while Pepper came with breakfast for everyone. 

Everyone got involved in decorating the trees, with the twins apparating between the two floors to steal all the red and gold decorations for their tree. Harry laughed when Tony ducked and suddenly had Pepper on his shoulders and she put the star on the top of their tree. Even Joey got involved, as he ran around barking at everyone and dragging long trimmings of sparkling garlands to Harry to wrap on the tree. 

Pietro eventually pulled out a box of red and white stockings and bottles of paint so everyone could make their own stocking. Luna had immediately offered to paint everyone’s names on theirs before they all decorated them. 

Harry paused while he painted a doggy face on Joey’s stocking to grab his phone and take photographs. 

For the rest of Harry’s life, he never wanted to forget that morning. Harry wanted to always see Sirius filling the room with his laughter after flicking paint at Strange and Pepper giggling at the ornament she stuck on Tony’s head. And the twins sneakily adding flecks of green paint to Ron’s very orange stocking while Luna helped Peter carefully paint a black spider to the front of his stocking. 

It wasn’t even Christmas yet and it was the best Christmas of Harry’s life. 

Harry had just taken a sweet picture of Joey napping beneath the brightly decorated and slightly chaotic tree when his phone dinged with a text from Anderson. 

Instead of the daft ‘motivational text’ he usually sent Harry every day, it was a simple ‘You home?’

Yeah. What’s up?

Come down to the lobby, I got something for you.

“Hey, I’ll be right back,” Harry called to the others. “Anderson’s downstairs.”

“Tell him to come up with you!” Tony yelled, a wide smile on his face that had been there all day. “We can get an extra stocking and he can hang it on the wall.”

“I’ll tell him,” Harry grinned. He whistled for Joey, figuring the sleepy pup needed to go outside anyway. 

 

When Harry and Joey made it to the lobby, Anderson was standing near the lifts in jeans that hid the silver leg Harry knew he had beneath them. 

“You’re supposed to be walking,” Anderson said. He fell in step beside Harry’s chair while Harry moved toward the back door to let Joey out. Harry would rather wait inside though, it was bloody freezing out. 

“I’ve been using the crutches,” Harry scowled. “I can’t fucking use them twenty-four seven, mate. My doctor says it’s counter-productive, you see.”’

“Whatever you say, Baby Stark,” Anderson winked. “What happened to you this morning, man?” 

“My friends came to visit, I didn’t want to leave them behind while I came,” Harry explained. He did want to see Anderson and everyone else at their weekly meeting, but he only got two weeks with his Hogwarts friends before they had to return and they’d be apart until at least summer. 

“Oi, Tony said you can come upstairs if you want, we’re decorating the place and having ‘brunch’,” Harry used his fingers to quote what Pepper insisted the meal was. 

“Can’t, I’ve got some more people I need to see today,” Anderson said vaguely. He must have seen Joey running up to the door from his height because he leaned forward and pushed the door open and Harry yelped when Joey immediately jumped on him with his snowy and cold paws. 

“Man, that’s a good dog,” Anderson laughed while Harry shoved Joey off his lap. “You should bring him along next week. I think Greene has a shepherd too, he had him trained as a service dog when he got home.”

“Sure,” Harry agreed easily. Joey liked car rides and attention, he’d be thrilled to go. Harry hesitated, he’d really like to go back up with his friends and family, rejoin the holiday fun he’d never had before, but he doubted if Anderson stopped by for no reason either. “You sure you don’t want to come up? Pepper brought a ton of food, probably more than even Lawrence could eat,” he joked. 

Anderson snickered and shook his head before plunging one hand in his jean pockets and pulling out a small box wrapped up in silver paper. 

“Nah, I really do have people to see, places to be.” Anderson tossed the box to Harry and Harry caught it on autopilot. “That’s for you though. Open it tomorrow night, when you’re not busy with your family and friends, alright?” 

“Oi, hold on!” Harry hastily put the small box in his hoodie pocket and began backing away. Harry had gotten each of the vets from the VA something for Christmas, it wasn’t anything major, but they’d helped Harry a lot and he just wanted them to know it. “I got you something too, I was just going to—”

“You can bring it next week.” Anderson grinned at Harry and then, because he seemed to need to insult Harry on a regular basis, added, “If you’re not chickening out on coming back.”

Harry rolled his eyes, “I’ll be there next week.”

If nothing else, Harry supposed his friends might be busy packing for their return to Hogwarts the next day or else maybe they’d want to meet Harry’s other friends too. 

Anderson clapped Harry on the shoulder and stared down at him seriously with just a small half-grin on his face. 

“I’m proud of you, man, you know that? You really are kicking ass and taking names.” 

Harry pushed Anderson’s hand off his shoulder even though he was rather pleased by the rare praise from his friend. 

“I’ll kick more arse when I’m able to use those crutches more,” Harry said. “Then we can race, see who’s really fastest.”

“I’m not racing you until you get a new damn leg,” Anderson smirked. “Rich white boys don’t need to suffer with wheelchairs and crutches.”

“Arrogant dicks don’t need to suffer from idiocy and celibacy, but here you are.”

Anderson laughed again and clapped Harry on the shoulder once more. 

“You spend too much time with Big Stark,” he said, his eyes glittering with humor. “I’m outta here, Harry. Have a good Christmas and don’t you dare open that box before tomorrow night!” 

“Thanks.” Harry held up the box and watched as Anderson walked away backwards, probably just showing off. “Have a good Christmas, mate, I’ll see you next week.”

Anderson winked and gave Harry a sharp salute before turning on his heel and strutting smartly out the lobby door. 

“He’s a dick, but he’s a good bloke,” Harry told Joey. “C’mon, let’s get back upstairs, buddy.”

Joey yipped and seemed just as eager to get back to the festivities as Harry was. 

“Awe, it’s your first Christmas with a family too, isn’t it, buddy?” Harry scratched Joey behind the ears while they rode the lift back upstairs. “Well I think it’s going to be the best one ever,” Harry confided to his loyal dog. “And even if it’s not, what do we really have to compare it to anyway, huh?”

Joey barked and Harry laughed to himself, floating on a giddy high from the holidays. 

 

Christmas was much better when Harry had a family to celebrate it with.

Chapter Text

“I love you.”

“I love you.”

Tony turned his head so he could look at Pepper. The two of them laid on the living room floor, surrounded by gifts that filled the room and were stuffed in stockings, enjoying the quiet. Pepper’s face flashed with a multitude of different colors that twinkled off the Christmas tree, and Tony couldn’t bear how full his heart felt.

Pepper loved him.

Harry loved him.

Tony had his own family to celebrate Christmas with and he was determined for it to be the best one yet.

Never in Tony’s entire life had he ever been so happy for Christmas. Christmas used to be something to be endured, dreaded. But this Christmas was Tony’s first Christmas with a son, with a real family. A family that wanted to be around him, celebrate together.

It was already so far beyond every other holiday of Tony’s life that it was unimaginable to try and compare.

“Hey, Tony?”

“Hm?”

Pepper turned her head and smiled at Tony, a softer smile than the friendly ones she used to give him.

“There is a flock of owls with packages outside your window.”

Tony had been distracted, watching Pepper with the lights dancing on her face, but a quick glance to the far window showed she was right. There were at least eight owls, all holding various sized boxes.

“A parliament,” Tony corrected Pepper absently as he scrambled to let the owls in. “A group of owls is called a parliament. And it’s our window, Pep.”

Pepper laughed while Tony went and slid the glass open, giving the owls access to bring in their packages.

“Yes, this is what I signed up for,” Pepper said from where she still laid on the floor. “A lifetime of being corrected on idiosyncratic terms.”

Tony hesitated as he went to add the packages to the piles - there was one for all of them… even Tony himself… - and was careful not to let his smile slip even when a fissure of worry blossomed in his stomach.

“You’re not already getting cold feet, are you?” Tony asked, remaining casual. “I know it was quick, and you might have felt some pressure with everyone watching, but if you—”

“Tony, shut up,” Pepper interrupted. She held her hand out that had his ring on it and let Tony pull her to her feet.

“I have been in love with you for a long time.” Pepper wrapped her arms around Tony’s waist and smiled up at him. “I was only waiting for you to be ready. You’re not getting cold feet, are you? Regretting giving up your playboy ways?” she teased.

Tony dipped Pepper backwards, causing her to laugh brightly before he cut it off with a kiss.

“My feet have never been warmer,” Tony assured her in a murmur before lifting her back up. “And, for that matter, Harry told me that it’s either marry you or he kills me.”

Harry worded it nicer than that, but it was the sentiment that Tony understood.

Pepper grinned and pressed a quick kiss to Tony’s lips, a kiss he’d never get tired of being the recipient of.

“Harry always has been my favorite Stark,” she said. “Really I’m only marrying you to be part of his family.”

“I assumed it was that or my money,” Tony winked. He waved the owls out and shut the window before giving Pepper a coy look as he slowly walked back to her. “If you’d like me to give you an excellent third reason to marry me, I’d be willing to give you one.”

“Mm…” Pepper had her arms around him in an instant, that time cupping Tony’s ass with her hands. “Only just that one reason?” she asked with a squeeze.

Tony lifted Pepper up and grinned when she wrapped her legs around his waist.

“Oh, Miss Potts, I can give you at least three more reasons tonight,” Tony said.

Pepper laughed and Tony carried her to his their bedroom to spend Christmas Eve night with his fiancé.

If there was a luckier man than Tony Stark, he didn’t know them.

 

“Hey… hey…”

Tony swatted at the air above his head with a lazy swipe of his hand when someone yanked a lock of his hair.

“Dad… MERRY CHRISTMAS!”

Tony groaned and reached up to smack his kid when he pulled his hair again, but a quick peek through one eye showed a disembodied hand waving at him above his head.

“Portaling to irritate your old man?” Tony lifted his head just so he could shake it at the grinning teenager in his bedroom doorway, one hand missing through a sparkling golden portal. “That’s cheap magic, kid.”

Harry stuck his lower lip out, using Tony’s own often-used pleading expression against him.

“I’ve let you sleep as long as I can, but there’s food and presents out here and I can’t guarantee they’ll all still be here if you don’t get your lazy arse up.”

“We’re up,” Pepper mumbled. She lifted her head up as well and gave Harry an adorably sleepy smile. “Merry Christmas, Harry.”

“Merry Christmas, Pepper,” Harry said, suddenly looking up at the ceiling with a dark red face. “Er… I’ll just… let you two get dressed… hurry up though.”

When Harry hastily backed out of the room and slammed the door behind him, Tony looked over at Pepper and smirked. Her strawberry blonde hair was a tangled mess, her makeup was perfectly ruined, and she was entirely naked.

“I kept the blanket up!” Pepper hissed, looking affronted. “I didn’t flash him!”

“Step-mom shoulders are just as bad as step-mom breasts,” Tony told her seriously. He rolled over suddenly, straddling Pepper’s waist and playfully pinning her hands down. “I don’t actually mind them.”

Pepper laughed breathlessly when Tony dipped his head and began kissing her neck.

“I think there’s a whole group of kids waiting on us,” she reminded him.

“Ugh…” Tony groaned and rolled off her, torn by his equal desires to keep Pepper in bed all day and spend Christmas with his son. Pepper resolved his dilemma with a slow and sweet kiss and a whispered promise to stay the night again.

Technically, Tony tried to convince her to just move in while they got dressed. No need for slumber parties if she lived with them, but Pepper put up a token protest about ‘occasionally needing privacy’.

Privacy was overrated.

 

In record time, Tony and Pepper were dressed and joined the others in the living room.

Most of the teens were sitting on various parts of the counters, avoiding the even larger pile of gifts that spilled from beneath the tree. Harry sat in his wheelchair and seemed to be complaining good-naturedly about the others eating his cherished marshmallow cereal. Peter already had his camera out and flashing in everyone’s faces, setting off laughter and complaints in equal measure. Sirius was lounging across the couch, using his wand to make Joey chase a red light around the kitchen.

Tony took a moment just to take it all in.

It was loud and messy, chaotic and unruly, and he wasn’t sure how he lived his entire life without having holidays just like it.

“Three more kids, minimum,” Tony murmured to Pepper when she wrapped her arms around his waist from behind.

Pepper propped her chin on Tony’s shoulder and he knew she was smiling.

“Done.”

Harry looked up then just as Peter flashed a camera in their face and he lit up with a smile.

“Finally!” he cried dramatically. “We’ve been up for hours!”

“They’ve been canoodling on our couch and making us all sick!” One of the twins jumped to his feet and pointed accusingly at Harry. “We have been trapped in our rooms, hiding from their debauchery!”

“You’ve been apparating in my room and flirting with Pietro,” Sirius snorted nonchalantly from the couch. “Your mum is going to have my head.”

“I’ll have you know that I am an adult, sir,” the twin sniffed with a toss of his red hair. “But maybe don’t tell my mum,” he added quickly. “It’ll be a brilliant surprise—”

“Surprise! I’m moving to America to shag a fit bloke!” The other twin wiggled his fingers in the air and the teens all collapsed in fits of laughter.

Tony almost moved to London to become the third wheel in a marriage once, so he didn’t see the humor in it.

Instead, Tony moved over to the tree and started sorting the new additions - mostly from Sirius - into piles for their designated person. Just because it was chaos didn’t mean there shouldn’t be some structure to it. Pepper helped him while Harry rushed everyone to finish their breakfast and move toward the living room.

“We have to open the lumpy brown packages first,” Ron told Tony as he settled on the floor beside Harry. “Mum sent them for everyone, I promised we’d get photographs once we have them on.”

Whatever that meant.

Tony tossed a brown package to everyone, including himself, and Pepper laughed brightly when she pulled a pastel pink knitted sweater from hers. Tony opened his package and found that he had a gold sweater with a dark red ‘T’ on the front.

“Your mom made these?” Pepper asked when she held hers up. Tony didn’t notice, but he saw that she had a lavender ‘P’ on hers as well.

“She makes them every year,” Harry told them, showing his own sweater. It was an inverse of Tony’s, dark red with a gold ‘H’, and Tony saw that Harry looked thrilled beyond reason to have it.

Sirius got a solid black one, something he seemed surprised to receive. All of Harry’s friends had them, some with initials on the front, some solid colored. And Harry laughed when Peter showed a blue sweater with a red spider decorating the front.

Ron looked disturbed by the spider, but they all got in front of the tree in their sweaters so that they could take a few group photos to give Molly Weasley as a thank you.

Little Luna even held her hand up, showing the tarantula she’d brought, and caused Ron to scream like a girl in the picture.

Harry was Tony’s favorite, but Luna was a close second.

 

The rest of the morning passed in a fun blur as presents were passed out, squeals were heard, and hugs were shared.

Tony was tackled by teenagers when he gave Ginny, Luna, Fred, and George StarkPhones to match the ones he already gave Ron and Hermione. Sirius was actually buried by red-heads when he gifted them all with their own broomsticks, Firebolts 101’s, and got Hermione and Luna some fancy book sets they both got misty eyed over. Pepper went the same route as Rhodey- gift cards.

Sirius cried, bawled like a baby actually, just as much over the Ducati from Tony as he did the photo album that Harry and Peter made for him. Tony got a similar photo album, one filled with any photograph that had Tony and Harry both present- of which there were more than he realized.

“Jarvis helped some,” Harry admitted as Tony looked through the pages and found quite a few of quiet moments. The two of them playing xbox, sharing breakfast… all little moments that didn’t seem photograph worthy and nearly made Tony cry in front of a bunch of annoying kids.

“Well now my gift is going to look silly,” Tony said after clearing his throat. “Pep? You better get it before he opens Happy’s gift.”

Pepper was admiring the pumps that Harry bought her and sighed dramatically when she had to set them to the side. The teens were all oohing and awing over the clothes and other gifts that Tony went all out for, ensuring they all had as good of a Christmas as they were giving him and Harry.

Harry looked curious when Pepper winked at him before sauntering off in her new sweater to grab Harry’s gift from their bedroom.

“I saw it and it looked like it would fit in here,” Tony said nervously when Pepper came out with her hands behind her back. “And you seem to be one of those people who enjoy having things that irritate you constantly, so—”

Meow.

Everyone fell silent as Pepper pulled her hand from behind her back and brandished the ridiculously adorable kitten that they found just a few days ago. The poor thing had been sitting in the gutter downtown, shivering and freezing, and had looked up at Tony with bright green eyes and he’d been nearly sold. What fully sold him was when Pepper scooped it from the gutter and they saw it had a mangled back leg. Tony took it to the vet and it had to be amputated, which cemented how much Tony decided they needed the kitten in their life.

“Oh,” Harry sighed and his face softened to see the little black ball of fur being offered to him. Tony had gotten it a little red collar and attached a tracking chip to it, one that matched the one Joey wore and Hedwig bit Tony when he tried to give her.

“It’s so little,” Harry said when he cradled the kitten. “Poor baby…”

Ginny and Luna surrounded him immediately, both of them lavishing the kitten in affection.

“It’s a girl,” Pepper told Harry. “There’s supplies from Happy, but don’t tell him we ruined his surprise.”

Harry looked up from where he’d been nuzzling the kittens fur and Tony knew he made a good guess when Harry smiled right at him.

“She’s perfect,” Harry said earnestly. “Thanks, Dad, I love her.”

“Yeah, well… don’t let her poop in my bed,” Tony said airily. He clapped his hands together and looked around at the fully trashed apartment. “Everyone with two legs should grab a trash bag and start bagging wrapping paper. Am I running a bed and breakfast for animals? C’mon now.”

“We’ll do it!” The twins cried in unison. Tony sighed when he saw them pull their wands and immediately turned the mess into a swirling tornado of wrapping paper.

Even when they were being ‘helpful’, they were still menaces to society and Tony would be relieved to ship them back to another country.

 

The rest of the morning was spent lazing around in knitted sweaters while Pepper turned on the Hallmark Christmas channel to play in the background.

Sirius took off to irritate the other members of the tower, rousing them from their lazy slumbers for a Christmas dinner he insisted on holding on his floor. Harry laid on the couch with his head on Peter’s lap and both of them fawning over the newest member of Stark Tower.

Tony had the unfortunate task of teaching a group of technology-inept teenagers how to work smart phones.

“We share a network, so don’t be saving nudes to the cloud,” Tony warned them. “If I get online and see a single red pubic hair, I’m shutting down all devices.”

“You guys share a cloud?!” Peter hissed, paling when Tony looked at him. “How often do you check it?”

Never.

“Every day,” Tony lied breezily. “Petey, don’t tell me there’s spider-nudes being sent to my innocent baby boy.”

“Innocent?” Ron laughed at Harry who seemed determined to avoid entering the conversation. “Mate, you didn’t tell your dad about the Seamus-situation?”

Harry turned even more red and suddenly Ron was Tony’s second favorite teen as he jumped in with a story about five fourteen year old boys playing truth or dare with some booze involved. Ron seemed to take a lot of pleasure in explaining that Seamus had been dared to give Harry a lap dance and Harry had an unfortunate hormone-driven reaction to it.

“I reckon that’s the real reason Seamus hates you now,” Ron finished cheerfully when their friends were all laughing. “You made him realize he’s gay. Oi! Did I tell you he’s with Dean now? It’s bloody painful in that dorm for Neville and I, I’ll tell you that.”

“Petey-Pie was Harry’s gay awakening,” Tony said, jumping on the ‘embarrass Harry’ bandwagon. “One little—”

“Wroooong,” Hermione cut in. She’d been tapping away on Ginny’s phone, helping her make shortcuts to all their contacts. Hermione looked up and smirked at Harry. “Harry, who was your first crush?”

“I hate all of you,” Harry said as he kept his eyes fixed on his kitten. “Should we kill them all, baby? Yeah,” he cooed, making the kitten nod its head. “What’s a holiday without homicide?”

“It was Bill,” Ron said, waving Harry’s threats off. “My oldest brother,” he explained to Tony. “Harry fancies him.”

“You’re all wrong,” Harry said. He turned his head and grinned at the group of them that were spread out on the floor. “If anyone laughs, I’m dropping you in a portal…” Harry took a deep breath. “It was Remus,” he said in a rush. “He was nice and I dunno, he kept giving me chocolate and- and I liked his hair.”

There was a single beat of silence before everyone, including Pepper, burst in laughter at Tony’s adorable son with absolutely terrible taste.

“Is that why you kept going for special lessons?” Ginny drawled with a flutter of her lashes. “‘Oh, Professor Lupin, I can’t figure out this Boggart…’”

“Oi! Someone has to tell Sirius!” one of the twins said as he rolled on the floor. “Like godfather, like godson!”

Harry let them laugh and then abruptly opened a portal right beneath the twin and smirked when he disappeared.

“That’s why we don’t make fun of thirteen year old boys who were a bit needy for attention, right, baby?” Harry asked his kitten. “Yes, poor Fred is going to have to explain to Psycho why he’s in her living room now, won’t he? Yes, he will.”

Harry brought the kitten in to kiss it’s forehead and Tony smiled at the scene. Even with the negative physical changes, it was almost impossible to reconcile the teenage boy openly joking about inappropriate crushes while cuddling his boyfriend on the couch.

Tony didn’t need a photo album or any of the other magical gifts Harry’s friends got him… honestly, as sappy as it was, Tony had everything he never knew he needed already.

Chapter Text

Christmas dinner at Sirius’ was a mess and Harry loved every moment of it.

Sirius, daft idiot that he was, had tried to cook a turkey for dinner and when everyone arrived in his flat, it still smelled like smoke.

Strange - who oddly insisted that Harry call him ‘Stephen’ outside of tutoring sessions - said he had foreseen Sirius ruining the meal beforehand and ordered an outrageous amount of Chinese food to be served buffet style instead.

“It doesn’t take the Eye of Agamotto to know that Sirius would ruin dinner,” Harry murmured to Ron when Ron helped make Harry’s plate in exchange for Harry telling him which meats were spicy. “Sirius can’t bloody cook to save his life.”

“What’s that, oh, darling godson?” Sirius called from the table that he and the twins were working on magically doubling in size. Sirius looked up and winked at Harry. “Sorry my family had a house-elf to cook meals for me instead of mistaking me for one.”

Hermione gasped, looking shocked at Sirius’ jest, but Harry smirked, missing Sirius’ sharp wit recently.

“Oh, boo,” Harry whined sarcastically. “Next thing you know you’ll be complaining about your parents using magic instead of belts and frying pans.”

“Are we playing who had the worst parents?” Psycho added as she moved chairs to new spots at the table as George replicated them. “Quit now, gentlemen, because I will win.”

“Mm, I don’t know, I’ve got a strong case,” Bruce said thoughtfully.

Harry rolled his eyes when Tony and Stephen both raised glasses and added their two cents in.

“It’s Christmas, not group therapy,” Harry told them all waspishly. “And I lived in a closet, so I win.”

“For your prize…” Peter had Harry’s new kitten on the table and he drummed his fingers on the table around her dramatically. “A lifetime of therapy!”

That was fine, Harry liked his therapist anyway. For a nosy bloke who asked a lot of questions, he did occasionally have good advice.

 

Everyone was rowdy during dinner- swapping jokes, showing off things they received for Christmas, and trading around dishes that they liked and disliked. Harry felt the lightest he ever had, wondering if it was how everyone felt on holidays with their family. He even felt a little charitable toward Psycho when she got drawn in a conversation with Luna about… martial arts, for some reason.

Ginny’s girlfriend was odd.

Dinner was already winding down when Harry’s subtle reminder to take his medicine flashed on his phone. Fred and Pietro already left to go fly together. George was trying to convince Sirius or Stephen to match Harry’s investment in the joke shop they hoped to open in the summer. Ron was mocking the Hogwarts professors with Tony for Pepper’s amusement. Ginny was chatting with Clint, Hermione with Bruce, and Luna with Psycho. Peter kept pausing in photographing everyone to pet the tiny little three-legged kitten on Harry’s lap.

“I’ll be back,” Harry told no one in particular after getting the notification. “Going to the loo,” he lied when a few people glanced toward him. Tony looked significantly at the watch on his wrist and Harry nodded subtly, grateful not to be reminded about his medicine in front of everyone like a child.

Instead of using the lifts (and as a way to irritate Hermione as she found sorcery to be a confusing and ‘imprecise branch of magic’), Harry backed up from the table and then carefully opened a portal so he could wheel directly through it to his bedroom.

“I hate him,” Hermione grumbled when Harry disappeared. “Show off.”

“That’s my student,” Stephen said proudly.

 

After taking his medicine, Harry truly did need the loo and it was much easier to use the one in his bedroom than Sirius ‘Harry-incapable’ bathroom at his flat. It was only when he re-entered his bedroom that a flash of silver caught his attention.

It was Anderson’s gift on Harry’s nightstand and Harry felt guilty for not being able to give him his until Saturday at the next meeting. Harry and Tony had picked out a variety of gift cards for each of the vets, most of them to the fast food places they all seemed to liked.

Harry got Anderson something extra, a thank you for driving Harry mad. It wasn’t terribly special, just a sunny yellow mug that said ‘I’m a fucking ray of sunshine’, but Harry thought Anderson would like it.

More to be lazy than anything, Harry opened a portal just above his kitten’s head and reached through it to snag the gift from his table, curious at what Anderson hand-delivered to him.

Anderson told him to open it when he wasn’t busy, so Harry figured it wasn’t something horribly inappropriate or embarrassing. Harry carefully unwrapped the paper, letting the kitten begin shredding the paper with her tiny claws, and saw that it was a small jewelry box…

Which was bloody odd coming from Anderson.

Harry popped the top off and found a silver necklace lying on top of a sheet of paper that was folded up small. When he lifted the necklace, Harry frowned to see that it was Anderson’s military necklace that all the vets at the VA wore. There was only one of the tags on the chain, the other one missing.

Stamped across the front of it was:

Anderson, Taylor B.
9913678152
A Pos.
No Preference

Harry felt his stomach clench uncomfortably and his fingers shook with hesitation he didn’t understand as he pulled out the note and unfolded it to read.

    Harry,
    Hey, Merry Christmas. I’m sorry I’m about to ruin it.

Harry held the letter in one hand and shoved his other fist in his mouth to keep from making a sound while he read.

    I wanted to tell you thanks for everything you’ve done for me, man. I don’t mean the leg your dad built or the food for the meetings, I mean the things you’ve done for me. You inspired me, Harry. You got this whole shit world handed to you and you just said ‘fuck it, I’m still going’.
    You’re a better man than I am.
    I’m not going to bore you with the story of another kid born to parents who didn’t give a fuck who ran off to join the army and found disability and depression instead of the purpose he wanted. I can blame my bullshit on everyone else, or I can say that some people just weren’t meant to live long lives.
    Do me a favor? Keep going to meetings, your cheerful face will keep the others from trying to do something stupid like following me.
    And for the love of God, Harry, get a new damned leg. Your dad is Tony fucking Stark, you could have a leg so filled with weapons that the next time someone tries to kidnap your ass you just blast them to bits.
    I’ll miss you man,
    I’m proud of you,
    -Anderson

Harry’s fist was the only thing that kept him from openly sobbing as he took the quickest route from his room to Anderson’s shitty apartment not far from the VA, via portal.

“Anderson…”

Harry clutched the arm of his wheelchair and let the sobs he’d been repressing wrack through his body. Harry had appeared just where he meant to in Anderson’s living room… directly beneath where Anderson’s body swayed from the ceiling fan, a rope around his neck, his once handsome face colorless and lax.

It was all Harry could do to wave his hand, the magic coming to him easily, and sever the rope and guide Anderson to float to the couch.

And when Anderson’s eyelids didn’t flutter, his chest didn’t move, Harry couldn’t look at his empty face and not see Cedric.

“Why…?” Harry cried. Harry looked at his friend who wasn’t killed by any evil madman, but by his own two hands.

“DAMN YOU, ANDERSON!” Harry screamed, his vision blurring and his throat tearing. “WHY?!”

 

Harry was numb when he called his dad, he didn’t even remember dialing the number. All Harry knew was that one moment he was in his chair, staring across the room at the dead body of his friend, and the next Harry was knelt beside the couch, holding Anderson’s cold hand, and crying as if his heart had been shattered.

Anderson was a prat- he was annoying and immature, he pushed Harry until Harry felt like his body was going to break -and Harry had idolized him and respected him in equal amounts.

“Kid… oh, fuck…”

Someone, Tony, probably, lifted Harry from where he was knelt in front of Anderson and carried him away even while Harry screamed and thrashed, trying to stay by Anderson like he should have sooner.

There were conversations happening, voices shouting and someone giving orders, but Harry curled his face in the crook of Tony’s neck and wept until he must have passed out.

 

Harry woke up in his room, Hermione on one side of him, Ron on her other side, and Peter half-underneath Harry with his arms wrapped around Harry.

Hermione was awake, her big brown eyes were blinking sorrowfully at Harry.

“Harry…”

Harry looked away from her, staring up at the ceiling instead, and hated the way his chest felt crushed beneath the wave of grief when he remembered what happened.

“He’s gone, Hermione,” Harry said, his voice shaking. “Anderson, he’s… he’s gone.”

“I know.” Hermione put her hand on Harry’s cheek softly. “It wasn’t your fault, Harry.”

Harry tried to scoff, tried to sound as angry on the outside as he was on the inside.

“No, it wasn’t my fault,” Harry agreed. His voice rose in fury, waking Ron and Peter both. “It wasn’t my fault, it was fucking Anderson! Anderson couldn’t just- he couldn’t call me? TEXT ME?! HE CAN SEND ME BULLSHIT EVERY MORNING ABOUT DICKS AND VAGINAS AND CAN’T SAY ‘I NEED TO TALK’?!”

Something shattered in Harry’s room, a window if he had to guess, and Harry saw Hedwig screech before taking off across the room.

“Harry, he probably—”

“I DONT GIVE A DAMN WHAT HE PROBABLY THOUGHT!” Harry yelled. He pushed himself in a seated position and clenched his fists to keep his hands from shaking while he glared harshly at Hermione. “LIVING WAS TOO HARD? JOIN THE QUEUE, MATE! THE REST OF US ARE FIGURING IT OUT! WHY COULDN’T HE?” Harry’s voice broke and his face crumpled. “Why couldn’t he?”

Harry’s friends threw themselves on Harry, all three of them managing to hold him when Harry fell forward, his chest aching with grief. Harry clutched to whoever he could, needing them to steady him.

“Why couldn’t he?” Harry cried. “Why couldn’t he?”

Joey whined and joined the rest of them on Harry’s bed, pushing and shoving until he had his head in Harry’s lap, whining unhappily while Harry cried. It was maddening, knowing that Anderson didn’t have to have his life cut so short.

 

Pepper brought Harry his medicine, a dreamless sleep mixed in the bunch, with lunch. Harry debated on taking the potion, sleeping peacefully without the reminder of his friend’s body dangling from a ceiling fan, but he didn’t.

Harry kicked his friends out so he could shower and rolled his eyes when Hermione firmly planted herself on his bed with one of the new books from Sirius.

“I’m not going to drown myself in the shower,” Harry said as he gathered clean clothes. He meant to drawl it, show his annoyance, but his voice was raspy from how much he’d been crying so it didn’t come out as sarcastic as he wanted.

“I’m sure,” Hermione said idly, feigning like she wasn’t watching Harry from the corner of her eye. “It’s quieter in your room, I can’t read around all the noise.”

Harry rolled his eyes again, but then ignored Hermione to go shower.

 

When he returned from the shower and Hermione was still there, she huffed quietly at Harry’s swollen eyes and waited for him to wheel over to his bed.

“You cared quite a bit for him, didn’t you?” Hermione asked, eyeing the chain Harry swore to never take off.

Harry shrugged and toyed with the tag, feeling a bit driven to talk to Hermione at least. Hermione had been there all through fourth year when Harry had some of the hardest times of his life, and she’d been the one more than once to bring a cup of hot chocolate to the Astronomy Tower and convince Harry to go inside.

“Anderson was a git, but he was a good bloke,” Harry said, his eyes on his lap. “I just… I don’t understand why he did it,” he said, looking up at Hermione helplessly. “The VA has counselors and he just got his leg replaced, I don’t- I don’t get it.”

Hermione moved Harry’s kitten from her lap and slid to her knees in front of Harry. She took both of his hands in hers and squeezed them while she looked at him with earnest eyes.

“He probably felt hopeless, like he’d never be cheerful again,” Hermione said softly. “He might have been scared and worried that if he told anyone how he felt that they wouldn’t care. I bet he felt rather alone and didn’t think about all the people who loved him. And… and maybe he didn’t realize how loved he was.”

Harry sniffled and felt uncomfortable as Hermione’s words resonated inside him. He lifted their joined hands so he could use the back of his own hand to wipe off his cheek.

“We would have talked to him,” Harry insisted. “I would have or Wilson or any of the others. He said… he said he’d see me next week, Hermione. He lied, right to my face.”

Hermione nodded understandingly.

“Do you remember the night after Halloween last year?” Hermione asked. “I was nagging you about your charms essay and you were glaring at Ron while he played chess with Seamus?”

Harry shrugged, he remembered it vaguely. Not as well as Hermione did, apparently.

“You said you needed some air and told me that you’d be back in an hour, you were going for a walk,” Hermione said smartly. Harry’s heart flipped in his chest as he did suddenly remember that night…

It had been a bad one, one Harry wasn’t proud to remember.

“When I went to find you, where were you?” Hermione asked before answering herself. “Sitting on the ledge of the tower. Harry, I…” Hermione swallowed hard and shook her head, flooding Harry with guilt. “Harry, I’ve never been so scared before,” she whispered. “You were looking down at the ground as if it was the most beautiful thing you had ever seen… and it took me ten minutes before you even responded to my voice.”

“I’m sorry,” Harry said, truly hating that he put Hermione through that. “Hermione, I’m so sorry.”

“You don’t need to apologize,” Hermione said. She was the one who sniffled then and Harry was quick to wipe the stray tear off her cheek. She gave him a shaky smile and squeezed their hands. “It’s just… I imagine you were in a terrible amount of pain, just like your friend, and weren’t able to see that there were people who loved you who would talk with you.”

Harry pulled Hermione in for a hug, grateful to have always had her there for him.

“Just for that, I’m going to sneak you in Dad’s lab,” Harry said, mildly choked up. “But you have to use a portal.”

Hermione laughed and pulled away from Harry to give him a true smile.

“Let me use your cloak and it’s a deal, Harry.”

 

Tony and Pepper were the only ones in the sitting room when Harry slipped from his bedroom after sneaking Hermione away to the lab.

“Hey, kid.” Tony was on his feet in an instant, his hands fidgeting at his sides. “How ya feeling?”

“Brilliant,” Harry said drily. “And you?”

“We’re sad,” Pepper said, knocking the sarcasm from Harry. “And worried about you.”

“I’m… fine,” Harry hedged. “I was going to go check on Sirius actually… he’s a baby, you know, very emotional.”

And talking about towers and death with Hermione had given Harry to urge to see Sirius, ensure that he was safe.

“Are you using the elevator or portal?” Tony asked Harry. He was clearly trying to grin, but it looked painful on his face.

“Portal, obviously,” Harry told him, adding a roll of his eyes to try and lighten the mood. Harry held up the kitten he had on his lap and bobbed her head playfully. “Tripod likes portals, don’t you, baby? Yes you do.”

Harry opened a portal and wheeled through it, leaving Tony to collapse on the sofa beside Pepper again.

“Did he just say he named the three-legged cat ‘Tripod’?” Tony asked.

Pepper laid her head on Tony’s shoulder and hummed. “That’s your son.”

 

Sirius was sitting at the kitchen counter when Harry let himself in the living room, drinking.

“Too good for the lifts now?” Sirius asked flatly. Harry frowned to see that Sirius looked miserable; his eyes were swollen and it was as if he was the one who lost a friend the night before.

“Snape always said I was arrogant,” Harry shrugged. “Why are you drinking at one in the afternoon?”

“Because I’m worthless,” Sirius said. He looked down in the glass he had half-filled with some sort of liquor and sighed heavily. “I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you, Harry. I should have been.”

Harry was rather caught off-guard by Sirius’ morose thoughts and obvious drunkenness.

“I, quite grandly, forgive you,” Harry said. He pushed himself over to the counter where Sirius sat and grimaced at the nearly empty bottle that Sirius had been refilling his glass with.

“Did I ever tell you about my brother?” Sirius asked abruptly. Harry shook his head, he’d always assumed Sirius was an only child.

“You remind me a bit of him,” Sirius said with a sad smile. “His name was Regulus. He was a Slytherin, one year behind me.”

Harry caught the distinct ‘was’ in that statement.

“Reg was a seeker, bloody good one too,” Sirius went on, blind to Harry’s discomfort. “He drove James mad, always kicking our arses in quidditch. And Reg was an artist too, when- when we were kids he used to talk about making portraits one day.”

“What happened?” Harry asked after Sirius drifted off into silence. Sirius threw down the rest of his drink and laughed bitterly.

“The brat went and took the Dark Mark, joined the rest of the Black’s in the age old tradition of following Voldemort.” Sirius refilled his glass and sighed. “And then you know what he did?” Sirius blinked slowly at Harry, alarming Harry with the tears filling his eyes.

“He snuck off and tried to destroy one of Voldemort’s horcruxes,” Sirius said. “He died. He knew he would die and he did it anyway. Isn’t- isn’t that the most Gryffindor thing you’ve ever heard?”

“I suppose so,” Harry agreed quietly. Sirius nodded as if Harry was as vehement in his conviction as Sirius was.

“To Reg and Anderson and all the rest,” Sirius said, raising his glass high. “To everyone we couldn’t save.”

Harry went from mildly alarmed to completely panicked when Sirius finished the drink and then dropped his head on his arms and began sobbing. Since Harry was ill-equipped to deal with Sirius’ breakdown, he sent a message to Stephen.

Are you shagging my godfather?

Yes, this is an appropriate text to receive from my 15yo student.

Sirius is having a bad day and I think he could use someone who knows what to do with him…

It didn’t take long for Stephen to appear through his own portal, dressed casually aside from his ever-present red cape.

It took even less time for Harry to leave, taking Tripod with him, to go busy himself with his friends and avoid dealing with anyone’s emotions, including his own.

 

On the day of Anderson’s funeral, Harry walked in the VA with his forearm crutches, refusing to use his wheelchair for the event. Tony was with Harry, also dressed up in a respectful black suit. Harry’s friends offered to go with them, but Harry shut them down.

Much like Harry knew he had to use his crutches for the funeral, he also knew it was something he needed to do with just his dad.

The other vets from their group were all there, all in their uniforms and looking as devastated as Harry felt. The gymnasium of the center had been completely altered and was filled with more military personnel than Harry had ever seen in one place before.

“Hey, kid.” Wilson and a few of the others, Godwin with her metal arms and her daughter sleeping against her chest, Greene in his chair, looking shocked, and Lawrence who walked with his head high and his right leg replaced with a prosthetic.

“How you holding up?” Wilson asked Harry after patting him on the shoulder.

“Crappy,” Harry said hoarsely. He looked around again at all the people that were beginning to file in chairs. “All these people came for Anderson?”

“Hell yeah, brother,” Greene said quietly. He was looking down at his lap, all of his usual cheeky cheer completely gone. “Everyone always shows up when you’re dead.”

Harry flinched and Tony bid the others a quick farewell and led Harry to a seat close enough to the front where Harry could hear without getting too close to the large black coffin that was buried beneath a flag and dozens of bouquets of flowers.

“You doing alright?” Tony murmured when they sat down. Harry nodded even though he felt sick knowing that Anderson’s body was inside of it.

“I’m sad,” Harry said quietly. He looked around and thought he might hate all the soldiers that were taking their seats, the ones standing silently up front in a row. Greene was right, they didn’t show up until Anderson was dead. Where were they when he was struggling? When he couldn’t find a point in going on with his life? Why show up when it was too late to help?

“Yeah, I figured that one.” Tony put his arm around Harry’s shoulders and let Harry shift closer to him, leaning on one of the few people that had stuck by Harry when he’d been the one struggling.

When Harry jumped, Tony caught him.

Anderson had no one to catch him before he fell.

Harry sat up as straight as any of the others and stayed quiet through the ceremony. They had the VA’s chaplain eulogize Anderson - he had a little brother that died when they were kids, two parents that didn’t show up, a girlfriend who cried up front with Booker - and then asked if anyone had anything they’d like to say.

Godwin handed her daughter over to Mendez before standing up and stepping to the stage in the smart and sharp steps that Harry was beginning to recognize from all the vets.

“We are here today to honor Specialist Taylor Anderson,” she said at the pulpit, her voice filling the gym. “I met Anderson through the group that we started here.” She looked from where the others from their group sat together and then over to where Harry and Tony sat a couple of rows away.

“Anderson was a pain in the ass,” she said, garnering a few weak smiles from the people who actually knew him. “He had a filthy mouth, a dirtier mind, and cheated at cards.” Godwin’s humor died and she became solemn.

“Anderson was also another good man who took on the age old fight against PTSD, and this time PTSD won. There isn’t a single one of us in this room who haven’t been in Anderson’s boots at least once.” Godwin paused and looked around again before nodding curtly. “Anderson was a good friend, a good soldier, and his loss is felt by every one of us.”

Godwin turned on her heels and faced Anderson’s coffin for a long moment before raising her shining metal right hand to her forehead

“Specialist Anderson, end of duty,” she said as she snapped her hand out in a salute.

Harry cried silently when two uniformed soldiers folded up the flag on Anderson’s coffin and presented it to Wilson, who presented it to Anderson’s girlfriend as the only person anything like family in attendance. It was six soldiers Harry didn’t recognize who carried the coffin from the gym to the car that waited out front, though the vets in Harry’s group were the first to follow them out, nodding for Harry to join them.

They all fell in a line behind the hearse and Harry stared through blurry eyes at the coffin while the others saluted once again.

The others began filling in their cars that made up the ‘procession’ behind the hearse and Harry knew that he didn’t have the mental strength to go stand in a cemetery and watch his friend be dropped in the ground.

“You not comin’?” Lawrence asked when Harry stepped to the side with Tony, neither of them going to Tony’s car until the others left.

“No.” Harry’s arms were already shaking with the strain of using the crutches so much in a single day. If he had to go stand around tombstones and see the coffin be lowered, then Harry’s tentative grasp on sanity would shatter.

“We’ll see you Saturday though, right?” Simmons asked.

Harry didn’t have to think about that, “Yeah. I’ll see you guys Saturday.”

The others nodded at Harry when they left, none of them pressuring him to go watch the burial. Tony waited until the surprisingly long procession of cars pulled out of the lot before gently pushing Harry down to a bench just outside the entrance.

“I’ll pull the car around,” Tony said, his voice rough. “Hey,” Tony waited until Harry looked up at him with teary eyes, “I’m proud of you, kid. I’ll be right back and then we can go home.”

Harry nodded gratefully and then laid his crutches beside him on the bench so he could rest his elbows on his knees and cradle his head in his hands.

It hurt to lose Anderson, it hurt in a sharp and agonizing way, but it hurt worse to picture himself in Anderson’s place…

Harry once thought that there was no point in life, no point in forcing himself to muddle through the days that did nothing but bring him unhappiness… Harry felt the same crushing hopelessness that Anderson must have felt all those times he’d sat on the edge of the Astronomy Tower, wishing for a strong breeze to knock him down… Harry felt it again when he’d accidentally apparated himself to the top of a building and then leaped off it…

 

When Tony came back from pulling the car around, Harry looked up at his dad and felt his lower lip quivering.

“I’m sorry,” Harry told him, a single traitorous tear breaking free.

Tony handed Harry his crutches and looked quizzically at him. “What for?”

“I did jump,” Harry said, admitting it to himself as well as his dad. “I jumped that night and I’m sorry.”

Harry was so damned sorry. If Tony didn’t catch Harry, then it would have been Tony and Sirius, Pepper and Peter, Ron and Hermione at his funeral.

If Harry hadn’t been caught, he would have put all the people he loved through the same gut-wrenching pain that Anderson put Harry and their other friends through.

Tony helped Harry get to his foot and pulled him in a warm embrace.

“Thank you for catching me,” Harry mumbled in Tony’s shoulder.

“I always will,” Tony said gruffly while Harry held him tightly, unbearably grateful to have been caught. They stood there together for a long moment, both of them just holding the other one. Eventually, when Harry’s leg shook with strained muscles, Tony guided Harry to the car and helped him slide in the passenger seat.

“Where to?” Tony asked, hiding red-rimmed eyes behind mirrored sunglasses.

Harry glanced at the doors of the VA, imagining Anderson the last time he saw him… a cocky grin on his face, a playful salute, and taunts spilling from his lips…

Anderson would never again walk through those doors- not with crutches, not with the new leg that they buried with him. Harry knew that he would though, every Saturday morning for as long as he could.

“Home,” Harry told his dad, wiping his cheeks off with his suit sleeve. He looked away from the VA and out the front windshield. “Let’s go home.”

Chapter Text

Friday, January 6

Michael settled in at his desk and went over his notes before his favorite patient came to see him.

It wasn’t just that Harry Stark was his highest paying patient, he was also the most inspiring one he currently had.

Also, he was a wizard, which Michael found to be fascinating.

Harry James Potter-Stark, 15yo cis male (he/him)
Current Diagnosis: Depression, Insecure-Attachment Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Anxiety Disorder
Treatment Plan: H is under medical treatment by physician for depres. and ADHD. H attends weekly therapy and actively participates in his own treatment. H also attends weekly group for amputees.
Home Life: H resides with his biological father since June. Recently, father became engaged and H reports being happy about addition to family. Prior to this, H stayed in a boarding school during term and lived with his maternal relatives in summers. H has alluded to abusive and neglectful conditions with relatives and does not recognize it as abuse. Prior to that, H lived with mother and stepfather until their murder when he was 1yo. H attachment insecurities come from feelings of abandonment and belief that he does not deserve love.
In current home H shares home with father, pet dog, pet kitten, and bird. H’s godfather shares the building as do his father’s colleagues. H is homeschooled with private tutors after recent physical trauma resulting in a left sided AKA. H reports having multiple friends and a boyfriend in a monogamous commitment.
Current Difficulties: In last session, H disclosed that his friend from amputee group committed suicide. H is processing grief in healthy manner, remaining open with father and therapist about emotions. It opened H up to examining his past history of suicidal ideation and H had a breakthrough on the way he handled his depression pre-therapy. H continues to struggle with disability and accepting limitations.
Goal for Session: H was very forthcoming with fears and insecurities at last session. In todays session, H will be sharing these with his father in safe environment.
Future Goals: Continuing to find coping mechanisms for insecurities and ensure open communication between H and people of importance. H requires consistent assurance that he is safe and loved, H also needs to not be belittled for these assurances.
Misc. Notes: H has had constant trauma and little peace; despite this, H is open to possibility of better future and remains an inspirational patient. Since sessions began, H has made true strides in accepting and managing mental health. Requesting a session with father shows clear signs of H healing.

Michael knew that the other therapists in his office were jealous when Tony Stark showed up in the waiting room to drop off or pickup his son, but Tony Stark had nothing on Harry Stark.

If Michael had been in Harry’s shoes, he didn’t think he would be able to get out of bed in the mornings. Between the evil wizard that tried to kill him, the brainwashed assassin that kidnapped him, the amputation, the depression…

It wasn’t a stretch to imagine that the kid did a nosedive off Central Park Tower back in June. The real magic was that he no longer wanted to.

 

By the time Michael went to collect Harry and his father from the waiting room, he thought that their session might be the one. All therapists looked forward to one day, one session, that made all their studying and long hours worth it. It was a unicorn session, one so elusive and magical that some therapists never saw it…

And Michael had a good feeling about the session with Harry and his father being his unicorn.

“Harry, Mister Stark.” Michael nodded to Harry and his father in the waiting room and offered them both a polite smile. “Are you ready?”

Harry looked uncomfortable, the same discomfort showing on his face that he had at the beginning of their treatment, but Stark looked entirely at ease.

“Tony, please,” Stark said. He stood up from the plastic chair he’d been lounging in and offered Michael his hand.

“Tony then,” Michael said agreeably. He gave Harry a supportive smile. “Harry, would you still like your father to come back with us?”

The thing Michael admired the most about his patient was his absolute stubborn determination. Harry looked about as uncomfortable as could be when he glanced up at his father, but he still nodded.

Michael let Harry lead the way with his slow and awkward gait using the forearm crutches to maneuver with. Harry had them at his last session as well and he confided that he felt it was a dishonor to his friend to rely too heavily on his wheelchair. It would be a more concerning sentiment if Harry’s physical therapist didn’t say that it was perfectly fine to use his crutches as much as he wanted.

When they entered the office, Michael took his usual seat and left the loveseat open for Harry and his father to share. It was heartening to see that Harry’s father didn’t shy from showing physical affection when he sat beside his son and looped an arm around Harry’s shoulders in an easy movement.

Michael made a quick note of the ease between the two and then smiled bracingly at them.

“Harry, how are you today?” Michael asked.

“A bit… nervous,” Harry said slowly. He twisted his hands in his lap and Michael was quick to grab him one of the fidget spinners that Harry relied on in prior sessions during stressful moments.

“Thanks,” Harry said when he accepted it. He began spinning it quickly in his left hand while his right settled on his lap. Michael nodded before looking toward Tony.

“And you, Tony?” Michael asked. “How are you feeling about joining us today?”

“Fine,” Tony said immediately. His body language was relaxed, but Michael imagined that a man of Tony Stark’s importance would develop an impeccable social appearance.

“Well, gentlemen, why don’t we get to it then?” Michael suggested. He looked toward Harry. “Do you want to start?”

The two of them had developed a plan during their last session, but Michael wasn’t surprised to see Harry falter. Harry craved his father’s acceptance, love, and affection; it was reasonable that he would become concerned with bringing up difficult subjects with him.

“That’s okay,” Michael told Harry. “Would you like me to start?”

“Yes, please,” Harry said.

Michael faced Tony and kept an eye on the speed of which Harry spun the toy in his hand from his peripheral vision as he spoke.

“Harry has been doing remarkably well with confronting his depression and anxiety. What we are hoping to address today are Harry’s insecurities,” he said. “Harry struggles with accepting that your relationship is unconditional and permanent.”

“Well… it is,” Tony said. Michael smiled blandly at him until he seemed to get the hint and turned to face Harry.

“Our relationship is permanent,” Tony told Harry.

T shows no hesitation in offering reassurances, Michael noted with pleasure. Some men, particularly fathers who were as career-driven as the head of Stark Industries had to be, found it difficult to offer emotional reassurances to their loved ones.

Michael was pleased to know that Tony was not one of those men.

“Harry?” Michael pushed gently. “What did you want to say today?”

Harry continued to spin the toy in his hand as he fixed his eyes on the wall over Michael’s shoulder.

“Sometimes I think that I ruined your life,” Harry said quietly. “I… you rebuilt your house for me and you go to all my meetings with me which means you don’t get as much time in the lab. And you rebuilt your friend’s flat so that my friends had a place to stay when they come… I’m worried that if I do something stupid again it’ll be the final straw and you’ll want me to leave.”

H needed little encouragement to open up; clear signs of trust between H and T.

“Kid… you didn’t ruin my life, you made it better,” Tony said, sounding genuine. “You remember when we met? You said you didn’t need a dad? Well…” Tony trailed off and Michael watched as his throat bobbed with a loud swallow.

“Well I needed a you,” Tony went on. “And there’s nothing you can do that will make me not need a you.”

Oh, yeah, it was absolutely going to be a unicorn day.

Harry looked over at Tony and managed to hold eye contact with him, despite how much Michael knew that Harry struggled with it.

“Were you happier before I came and caught your chair on fire then ruined your flat?” Harry asked quietly.

Michael’s eyebrows twitched downward for a split-second.

Caught chair on fire? he wrote for future sessions.

“Kid,” Tony sighed and Michael saw his arm tighten around Harry’s shoulders. “If catching our entire house on fire made you happy, it would make me happy. And I like our place now, much more modern.”

Harry actually had incredibly low impulse control so Michael appreciated the sentiment about letting him burn down their home, but wished it had been worded better.

“And how do you feel about having to step back from your work detail?” Michael asked Tony, addressing another of Harry’s fears.

“Great,” Tony smiled breezily. “My fiancée, Pepper, basically runs the company so I get to sit back, spend time with Harry, invent shit, and still get rich. It’s the ideal scenario, really.”

“What of your separation from the Avengers?”

Tony scoffed and looked over to wink at Harry, slowing some of Harry’s anxious fidgeting.

“Again, it’s the best case scenario. I just stuck Sirius in charge of the team and now I just upgrade weapons and play cleanup after disasters,” Tony said. “I get all the good parts of leading the team without any of the life threatening risk.”

T prioritizes H above work.

Michael gave Tony an approving smile. “That sounds like acceptable compromises.”

“It works for me,” Tony agreed.

“Harry?” Michael asked. “Do you believe your dad when he says that he is happy to step back and spend more time with you instead of working?”

Harry shrugged, more reticent than usual.

“He doesn’t lie,” Harry said, sparking warmth in Michael’s stomach.

H trusts T implicitly.

“Great!” Michael said happily. “Really, the two of you have came so far!”

It didn’t seem all that long ago that Harry sat in his office, disturbed by even the mere idea of having his father’s love. And now? For Harry to show such complete trust in his father?

It was every therapist’s dream.

Harry seemed pleased by Michael’s praise and he relaxed his shoulders.

“Harry, what other topics did you want to discuss today with your father?” Michael asked, prompting Harry. They had made a list in their last session and Michael hoped that Harry still felt up to tackling it.

“Er…” Harry kicked his foot against the floor. “I’m glad that he- that he caught me… when I… you know.”

Michael waited, his breath held, hoping Harry would find the courage to say the words.

Harry took a deep breath and kept his eyes on the floor as he elucidated. “I’m glad he caught me when I- when I tried to kill myself.”

It was undoubtedly a unicorn day. Saying those words were some of the hardest words that a patient could say. It was painful to admit even to themselves the truth of what they did, admitting it aloud?

Harry Stark was Michael’s favorite patient.

Tony pulled his son in his side and closed his eyes when he tilted his head to touch Harry’s.

“I am too, kid.”

Michael gave the Stark’s a moment to bask in their excellent mental health before he recrossed his legs, gaining their attention.

“How do you feel for saying that, Harry?” Michael asked gently.

Harry twisted his lips to the side and started spinning the toy again.

“Bad,” Harry said shortly. “Not saying that I’m glad you caught me,” he added to Tony, “but just… just thinking that I would have put everyone through what Anderson did us.”

“And what did Anderson put you through?” Michael asked.

“Does it sound bloody stupid to say he broke my heart?” Harry asked. Michael ignored his foreign swear, knowing that Harry had a tendency to swear when he was feeling defensive.

“Not at all,” Michael assured him. “Losing a close friend in a needless way can be heartbreaking.”

“It was needless!” Harry said, glowering deeply. “He texted me every day, every single day. And never once did he say ‘I need to talk’?”

“Is that an easy thing to do?” Michael asked Harry, rehashing an earlier debate. “Telling others that you’re having suicidal thoughts?”

“I…” Harry clamped his jaw shut. Tony remained silent as Michael did, waiting to see what Harry had to say.

“I tell Sirius all the time when I need to talk,” Harry eventually said.

“You do?”

T insecure about H relationship with S?

Harry looked over at his father.

“I… sometimes?” he said. “Just… just when it’s a bad night.”

“Why don’t you tell me?” Tony asked, masking what Michael sensed was his hurt behind curiosity.

Like father, like son, Michael noted with amusement.

“Because… because it’s easier to tell Sirius,” Harry said quietly, no longer looking at Tony. “We talked a lot back before I knew you and- and he already knows what I’m like.”

“What are you like, Harry?” Michael asked before Tony could reply. He needed Tony to see the depth of Harry’s low self-esteem. It had improved some, surprisingly after his accident, but it was still poor.

“I dunno, whiney, I guess,” Harry said flatly. “Sirius doesn’t mind if I whine to him.”

“And you think I would?” Tony asked Harry.

“Sirius… he… he can’t exactly get sick of me, can he?” Harry mused. “I’m his godson, but he doesn’t have any real responsibility. He can’t just- just drop me off somewhere or- or stuff me somewhere to get rid of me if I annoy him.”

“Stuff you somewhere?” Tony sounded bewildered. “Kid, nobody’s going to ‘stuff you’ anywhere. Even if you did annoy me, which you don’t, I wouldn’t get rid of you for it.”

“Not like it feels as if everyone else did, right, Harry?” Michael asked, playing devils advocate.

“Exactly,” Harry agreed. “Sirius left me in my parents house for Hagrid, Hagrid left me with Dumbledore, Dumbledore left me on a bloody front step for my aunt. Then my aunt just signs me over, no fuss at all!”

H carries long history of abandonment.

“And if you irritate Tony by telling him when you’re having suicidal thoughts, you think he may sign you away?”

“Maybe, yeah.”

“Harry, I would not,” Tony said firmly. He pulled Harry to his side again, hugging him fiercely. “I love you. You are stuck with me, no matter what.”

No belittlement when it comes to reassurances, Michael noted with pleasure. Truly, Tony Stark was an intimidating man in the news. Michael could not be more happy to see that his professional persona and paternal persona were complete opposites.

“Tony, would you be open for Harry to come to you the next time he’s having a hard day?” Michael asked Tony.

“Yeah, yeah, of course,” Tony said quickly.

“Harry? Do you think you could do that? Give your father an opportunity to prove to you that your depressive episodes won’t push him away?”

Harry chewed his lower lip for a moment before he jerked his head in a semblance of a nod.

“Yeah, alright.”

“Great!” Michael said, encouraging Harry to continue with his openness. “Gentlemen, we have about twenty more minutes. Are there any other topics you would like to discuss here?”

“Yes,” Harry said quickly. He looked at Michael instead of Tony, though his words were obviously meant for his father. “I want to go back to school.”

“Back to Midtown?” Tony asked. Harry nodded and Michael saw Tony hesitate for the first time. “Is this about Petey?”

“No.” Harry raised his chin and looked his father in the eyes. “I didn’t want to go back before because I felt like a freak. I didn’t want everyone to stare at me, but, you can’t be mad because we already did it, but loads of kids from my school were at that party we had. So they already know, right? And Paris has helped me a lot, so I think I’d do better in class now. I don’t want to hide out, not anymore,” Harry finished quietly.

H advocates for self well.

Michael remained silent with his pen poised and his head tilted for Tony to consider Harry’s request. Tony seemed to think it through, taking his time, before he made a decision.

“Can we talk to Pepper about it before we decide?” Tony asked. “I think if you want to go back, we can definitely discuss it, but you know Pepper will be all stompy if we don’t let her weight in.”

“You and Pepper will talk about it or we all will?” Harry asked shrewdly.

“We all will,” Tony said. “There’s some logistics to work out, with physical therapy and your sessions with Strange, but if we get Pep on our side, I’m sure we can get it done.”

T supports H decisions while maintaining logical viewpoints.

“Thanks, Dad,” Harry said with a faint smile, finally still from his fidgeting.

“This has been a wonderful session!” Michael declared happily. “Harry, I cannot tell you how proud I am of the progress you’ve made. And I think I know something that may help with lightening your schedule… I believe we are at a place where we can begin meeting biweekly, instead of weekly.”

“Really?” Harry asked, straightening in his seat. “I’m better?”

“Better is a relative term,” Michael said with a cheerful wink. “You have came very far, Harry.” Michael stood up and offered Harry his hand. “It has been a pleasure to assist you in your healing.”

“Thanks,” Harry said, smiling. He took Michael’s hand and shook it with enthusiasm. “I guess I’ll see you in two weeks.”

Michael offered Tony his hand next after nodding at Harry.

“Tony, you have a good son and you’re doing an excellent job raising him,” Michael assured him. Oftentimes, parents needed as much reassurance as children and when one was doing as wonderfully as Tony, Michael was quick to provide it.

“Thank you,” Tony said, shaking his hand. He looked over at Harry and none could doubt the fondness in his eyes. “I’m a lucky man.”

“Yes you are,” Michael agreed.

 

As soon as the Stark’s left Michael’s office, discussing disability friendly cars while they walked down the hallway, Michael quickly finished up his notes on the session.

And then, just because he could, Michael pulled out his sticker books for younger clients and flipped through the pages until he found a purple unicorn. As soon as he marked the session as the magical unicorn it was, Michael decided to take the rest of the afternoon off and either go to the country club to play tennis or brag to his fellow therapists.

Perhaps, if Lee and Owen were there, Michael could do both at the same time.

Chapter Text

Tony did exactly what he said he would. He called Pepper and they all sat down over a meal the very next night to discuss Harry going back to Midtown to finish the school year.

Harry tried to not be nervous-

Tony was his dad. Pepper was his… his Pepper.

It didn’t have to be an argument, it could be a normal conversation.

Pepper started it off, her face kind and her voice non-judgmental.

“Harry, your grades have really improved, but… you were struggling at Midtown.”

“I know,” Harry agreed. “I- don’t be mad, okay? But I wasn’t really trying much. Paris makes me try and it’s easier when Dad explains things, but now I have the basics down, so it might be easier… to try.”

“If it’s easier here though, why not stay here?” Tony asked. Harry hated the hopeful look in his eyes, the one that said he seemed to want to keep Harry around more often.

A novelty, really.

“I… I liked going to school,” Harry said, trying to explain without hurting anyone’s feelings. “I have friends there and- and sometimes I feel a little trapped here.”

Stifled.

Like Harry’s life ended when he lost his leg and the Tower was his grave.

“You feel trapped here?” Tony repeated. He looked like Harry did manage to hurt his feelings until Pepper reached over and put her hand on top of his and shook her head.

“Tony, he’s a fifteen year old boy,” she said gently. “He needs more than one environment to be satisfied.”

Harry nodded in agreement even though he wasn’t exactly sure what Pepper was saying.

“What about therapy and tutoring and—”

“Those can be arranged for after school,” Pepper cut Tony off. “Stephen can rearrange his schedule and with Harry only doing weekly physical therapy and bi-weekly sessions with Morris, there’s no reason that can’t be done after school.”

“So we’re really doing this?” Tony asked Pepper, raising his voice just enough to have Harry snap his own mouth shut. “What if something happens?”

“Tony, nothing is going to—”

“That’s what everyone always says until a normal day ends in a kidnapping or a murder or—”

“Your best mate hanging himself?” Harry added flatly. He stared blankly at the tabletop, thinking how Tony was right.

All of Harry’s worst days started completely normal - aside from the Third Task, which was a mad day from start to finish. Hell, Taylor killed himself on Christmas.

A person could wake up and do something as normal as going to school and still have a catastrophe happen.

Pepper gave Tony a severe look that Harry missed as his own thoughts began spiraling downward.

“I mean, yeah, but no,” Tony said. He tapped Harry’s hand, causing Harry to shake his head and blink at him.

“Look, kid, all I’m saying is that you’re safe here,” Tony said, his expression open and begging. “I- I can’t protect you at Midtown.”

Harry bit his lip and thought it over for a moment. He was grateful that they were giving him time to think, not pressing him for an immediate answer. It didn’t sound like Tony didn’t want Harry to go to Midtown just because, it was because he was worried for Harry.

Another novelty.

“I can’t just stay here forever though,” Harry said slowly. “And if I’m going to go anywhere, I think high school is a pretty safe bet.”

“You came home injured before!” Tony cried.

Harry grinned a little, fairly certain that Tony was merely grasping at straws.

“Peter probably won’t do that again,” Harry laughed. “I started it anyway.”

Pepper was relaxed in her seat and smiled warmly at Harry while Tony was running a hand through his hair, not even a little at ease.

“We’re a three person family,” Pepper said brightly. “Let’s put it to a vote- all in favor of Harry going back to Midtown?”

Harry and Pepper both raised their hands and Tony huffed and threw his hands in the air.

“Is this what marriage is going to be like?” he demanded of Pepper. “You and my own son outvoting me when I have legitimate concerns?”

“Yes,” Harry and Pepper said simultaneously. Tony finally cracked and grinned at them, though he tried to look angry.

“Fine, fine, don’t be surprised when I start making a tiny army of Mini-Stark’s to vote on my side,” Tony said. “Harry, you’ve always wanted a bunch of siblings, right?”

Harry felt a twist in his stomach, not an unpleasant twist, but… unexpected. Harry didn’t even… he knew that Tony and Pepper would get married one day. And that was fine, because Harry liked Pepper- loved her probably -and it would be nice to all live together and be like a real family.

But Harry never pictured siblings before… and now that he was… now that he was picturing a little brother with dark hair like his or a sister with Pepper’s strawberry blonde hair…

Harry liked it.

Harry liked it a lot.

“Yeah,” Harry said thoughtfully. “Yeah, I’ve always wanted a bunch of siblings.”

 

Harry called Peter while he took Joey outside and had Tripod on his lap, snuggled inside his hoodie pocket.

“Hey, Bright Eyes!” Peter was yelling and not answering his video call, only audio, and Harry frowned immediately.

“What are you doing?” Harry asked him.

“Me? Huh? Noth— hey, don’t try to stab me! I’m talking to my boyfriend!”

Harry felt the beginning of a headache building behind his eyes when he listened to what seemed like a fight happening.

“I hate you, you know that, right?” Harry asked Peter idly. He heard someone yelp, not Peter, and then heard Peter laugh.

“Nah, you said you loveeeee me,” he sang in the phone. “Give me one second to finish up and I’m all yours.”

Harry sighed and scratched Tripod’s neck while he waited for Peter to ‘finish up’. They’d had a bit of a spat when Harry realized he was still Spider-Blokeing and it hadn’t been pretty.

“YOU’RE GOING TO RISK YOUR LIFE FOR PEOPLE THAT DONT GIVE A DAMN ABOUT YOU?!”

“So would you if you could do this!”

“I CAN DO A LOT MORE THAN SHOOT WEBS FROM MY BLOODY WRISTS, PETER!”

Harry, in a true first for himself, apologized first. And then, less surprisingly, snapped off in anger when Peter wouldn’t see the point he was trying to make.

“I just… I don’t… what if you get hurt?”

“I heal like really quickly. I’m practically invincible.”

“Yeah? That’s good to know. I used to have a friend who thought he was invincible too, two of them actually. Maybe when you get killed trying to stop some bullshit robbery then you can tell Anderson and Cedric that I say hi, huh?”

They ended in a truce—

Harry would never like it because of Cedric.

Peter would never quit because of his uncle.

They ‘compromised’, thanks to Tony.

Peter would patrol whenever he felt like it, but he wore an upgraded suit that Tony made for him. Harry watched as Tony did everything from shoot bullets at the suit to stab a knife in it- he even let Harry try to catch it on fire with a neat blowtorch. The suit didn’t so much as smolder or rip the whole time they tested it.

Plus it was connected to Sirius’ phone so if Peter found anything more serious than a carjacking or mugging then Sirius and the others could jump in to help.

And, if Harry got anxious enough, Harry would simply open a portal and summon Peter through it.

It wasn’t a perfect system, but it worked for them.

Harry waited as patiently as he was able for Peter to finish up so he could share his news. When his phone beeped and he looked at the screen and saw Peter was trying to connect via video, Harry knew he was done.

“Hi,” Peter grinned. He had his mask off and his hair was sticking to his sweaty face in a way that shouldn’t cause Harry’s own face to feel warm.

“Hi,” Harry said back. “How was… whatever that was?”

“Oh, fine,” Peter said nonchalantly. “Some douche bags were trying to break in the bodega on 121st, you know the one with the slushees you like? Anyway, they’re tied up and Gwen’s dad‘s problem now.”

Harry did laugh then. Gwen was shitty as could be when she found out that Peter was Spiderman and Harry was a wizard like Sirius. She didn’t mind being let in on the secrets, she was only angry that she couldn’t write any reports on them.

Gwen said she’d never speak to them again, but she came over the night after Anderson’s funeral anyway.

“Good,” Harry said. “Speaking of Gwen…” Harry paused for a dramatic moment, channeling his inner Sirius…

“Dad said I can come back to school.”

“WHAT?!” Peter stared for a moment before his face spread in a wide smile. “Seriously? That’s- that’s- fuck yes!”

Harry laughed when Peter nearly dropped his phone and pumped a fist in the air.

“You’re sure?” Peter asked after he finished his daft celebration dance. “You’re- you’re good?”

“Yeah, I’m good.”

And Harry was, mostly.

His leg didn’t hurt so much anymore; even if his arms were sore as he refused to use the wheelchair most days.

Every day Harry took his medicine like clockwork and Strange finally cleared him to end the antibiotics, so Harry only had two daily pills. The Dreamless Sleep sat untouched, Harry didn’t need it.

He slept at night; even if he woke in panic sometimes, picturing Anderson’s body swinging above his head.

Harry went to the VA every weekend; he didn’t talk much, but the others kept him included anyway.

And now he’d be going back to school, back with his friends that kept messaging him on some app that Gwen put on his phone.

Brittany said she missed him. Flash offered to ‘hit the gym’ together. Shani asked if Harry’s red headed friend could transfer to Midtown.

Sirius was dating Strange, Tony and Pepper were planning a wedding for the summer.

Everyone seemed happy.

So Harry was good. He was.

****

Harry’s first day back at Midtown had been exhausting.

Thanks to his pride and Anderson’s final taunt, Harry didn’t take his wheelchair and insisted to Tony that he would be fine on the forearm crutches all day.

Which would have been fine, except Harry forgot how bloody large the school was and how much walking he had to do in seven minutes for passing periods. It helped that his friends insisted on carrying his books, preventing Harry from lugging around a heavy bag all day, but it typically resulted in whoever carried his stuff to be late as well.

Not that any of them got so much as a stern word, oh, no. The teachers were all disgustingly sympathetic and understanding when Harry arrived two or three minutes late to class, clanking away as his crutches tapped the ground.

Harry would have preferred detention over the big sad eyes the teachers kept giving him.

Tony texted Harry at lunch, just like he used to, and Harry rolled his eyes at the message.

Ready to come home yet?

At 3:10, yeah.

Tony sent back a broken heart and Harry was relatively sure that he was only joking.

“Do you regret everything?” Gwen asked when she slid in a seat across from Harry and Peter. Harry wanted to go outside to eat, but it was freezing out and the cafeteria was closer to his next class.

“Always,” Harry said seriously. “It’s not terrible,” he amended himself. “It’s just… bloody hell, it’s a lot of hopping.”

Peter laughed at Harry’s jest and passed him some of the chips off his tray.

“You could get a leg and just walk again,” Gwen pointed out. “Then you wouldn’t have to hop.”

Harry shrugged, uncomfortable with the topic of a fake leg. It was… it wasn’t terrible. Harry knew a lot of shit people with fake limbs, but… but he knew nearly a dozen people with new prosthetics that all encouraged him to let Tony fit him for one as well.

And… Harry absently reached up and toyed with Anderson’s military necklace he wore… it was important enough to Anderson that even when he had to be in unimaginable pain, he still insisted Harry get a prosthetic.

“Maybe, yeah,” Harry agreed quietly. He changed the subject quickly before his mind could linger on Anderson’s note for too long. “Oi, I’m supposed to make a creative video for history? Any ideas?”

 

The rest of the day passed by slowly and Harry’s mind was a million miles from high school.

There seemed to be two voices in his head arguing about prosthetics. One was definitely Harry’s voice, thank God because otherwise he’d be concerned, and the other sounded suspiciously like Anderson.

It’ll hurt. Everyone at the VA said they pinch and leave bruises.

And then Tony adjusted them until they were comfortable.

It’s a waste of money. Tony already rebuilt his entire flat to fit my wheelchair, do I really want to say ‘never mind, I’ll take a leg now, please’?

He won’t care. He’s designing a car that you can drive with one leg. Wouldn’t it be better to get it now before he wasted more money on that?

Harry’s mental debate lasted through his afternoon classes. Since he was ‘excused’ from running sprints during gym, Harry tried to pinpoint his biggest worry with the fake leg that period.

It won’t feel real, he realized. It’ll be a heavy and awkward reminder of… of all of it.

Harry didn’t want to remember worrying that Peter had died or that he himself was going to die. Harry didn’t want to think about the conversations he hallucinated when he couldn’t bear to be in his own head anymore.

It’s not like you don’t already remember that though, one of the voices in Harry’s head said rationally. Plus… Anderson said to do it.

Anderson said a lot of things, Harry thought despondently.

Like ‘I’ll see you this weekend’.

 

“Rough day?” Happy asked when school finally ended and Harry could collapse in the car.

“Rough life,” Harry said flatly. He shifted the crutches around so he could throw them in the backseat, thoroughly sick of them.

Happy hummed thoughtfully as he began driving back to the Tower.

“Stupid kids or stupid crutches?” he asked.

“Crutches,” Harry said. “Everyone at school already knew, that wasn’t bad.”

Though Harry’s math teacher did sniffle at him and say he was a ‘brave boy’. Which was mad. It wasn’t brave to get a leg cut off, it was just stupid.

It was stupid to jump from a car, even if it seemed like a good idea at the time.

“If you’d let your dad give you the leg he built then you wouldn’t need crutches.”

Harry whipped his head to the side to gape at Happy for a moment.

“He built one?” Harry asked, shocked. “How do you know?”

“Because he’s Tony Stark,” Happy snorted. “He probably had it designed when you were having the surgery. Tony’s a fixer, kid. He sees a problem and it’s like his fingers itch until he finds a way to fix it.”

That… that made sense.

Harry told Tony that he couldn’t fly anymore and two hours later Tony had an entire broomstick designed for Harry to use. Harry couldn’t shower and Tony redesigned Harry’s bathroom.

Harry didn’t think he needed a family and Tony gave him one anyway.

Happy stayed quiet for the rest of the drive and let Harry mull it all over.

He was being stupid, again. It was stupid to worry about having to learn to walk again, when Harry could walk again. It was stupid to worry about Tony wasting money on Harry when Tony probably did already design a leg for Harry.

It was stupid to not take Anderson’s letter to heart when it was probably some of the last words that Anderson wrote.

 

Harry went straight to Tony’s office when he got home.

“Hey,” Tony smiled at Harry from behind his desk. “How was school? You can always quit, you know. There’s no shame in—”

“I think I want a leg,” Harry blurted out. He didn’t mean to cut Tony off, but if he didn’t say it then he wouldn’t say it. Tony’s mouth snapped closed and he blinked at Harry for a moment, causing Harry to feel incredibly self-conscious.

Harry was about to say never mind and change the subject, talk about the video he was going to make that weekend with Peter and Gwen for history, but then Tony smiled wide right at him.

“And here I thought I missed your first steps,” he said brightly. “Come on, favorite son of mine, let’s fit you for a leg.”

Chapter Text

Friday, January 12

Tony fired up the cupola furnace in his lab and bounced on the balls of his feet while he waited for Sirius to arrive.

He hadn’t slept in… thirty hours. But it was the good kind of insomnia, the kind that came from a project.

Harry told him yesterday that he wanted a leg and Tony hoped to have the greatest leg in the world ready by the time Harry returned from school. They took all the measurements yesterday - the prototype that Tony made was too short - and all Tony had to do was finally create it.

The molds were ready, the various compartment were painstakingly carved out for Tony to add some razzle dazzle to it. But he couldn’t assemble the leg until he had the material he needed for it.

Sure, Tony could have used a mixture of aluminum and plastic for it like he did for the ones at the VA, but that was boring. It was boring and destructible, Harry needed a leg that was as invincible as Harry thought he was.

Even the iron that made up Tony’s suits weren’t what Tony wanted or Harry needed. The only thing Tony really wanted to make the prosthetic out of was—

“Is there a reason you needed Steve’s shield at eight in the bloody morning?”

Tony looked away from the fires building in the furnace at Sirius’ grouchy voice. Sirius walked in the lab, still dressed in a pair of sweatpants and a tshirt, with the shield in his hands.

It was perfect.

Both material wise and irony wise, in Tony’s opinion.

It was Steve’s fault that Barnes had been able to take Harry and it was Steve’s beloved shield that would replace the leg that Barnes caused him to lose.

Plus it was technically Tony’s property anyway. An heirloom, of sorts, if he felt sentimental about it.

Howard created the shield originally. Tony would make it a leg. Maybe when Harry had kids of his own one day, little tiny Stark grandbabies, then he would take it and make it a sled or something.

Sirius slammed the shield on Tony’s work table, causing Tony to howl in dismay.

“HEY! Careful!” Tony cried. “This stuff is important!”

All of Harry’s measurements were jotted down along with Tony’s detailed blueprint of the final product.

“Looks like junk to me,” Sirius yawned. He scratched at his jaw and tilted his head at the blueprint Tony created. “You’re building a leg?”

“Not just any leg.” Tony picked up Steve’s shield and waved it around some. “Imagine the perfect leg. Virtually indestructible, it grows as the person grows, and has a variety of hollowed out compartments for weapons and safety features.”

Sirius blinked at Tony slowly.

“You’re taking a priceless shield meant for wars and making a bloody leg out of it?”

“Not just any leg, my friend, but Harry’s leg,” Tony said. He smirked when Sirius instantly became more alert. “Oh, he didn’t tell you he wants one now?”

“He didn’t!” Sirius said, clearly putout by that.

Tony wasn’t putout by that, Tony was ecstatic about it. For the first time, Harry came to Tony first about a problem he had.

“Don’t take it personal, it’s because he likes me better,” Tony taunted Sirius. He’d dealt with Harry’s preference for Sirius for seven months, Sirius could deal for one day.

“Help me melt this,” Tony told him. “The furnace gets up to almost two thousand degrees, but it has to be at least five thousand to melt this down.”

Sirius watched while Tony carefully loaded the shield in the furnace, silently giggling like a little kid about the whole thing.

It was just too perfect.

“Make the flames hotter?” Sirius asked Tony. Tony nodded and Sirius pulled a wand from his sweatpants pocket.

The two of them watched the flames grow and burn hot enough to drive them both back a couple of steps. The shield inside the furnace melted slowly. The colors dripped off it, the circle slowly wilted, until finally, after ten minutes of exposure to the furnace, it melted down in the pot Tony loaded up for it all.

“Indestructible my arse,” Sirius muttered.

Tony grinned at him. “You really think Harry’s at high risk for exposure to temps that high?”

Sirius stared deadpan at Tony until he conceded the point.

“Yeah, well, maybe he’ll just portal away if so,” Tony said. “Hey, you mind? Normally I’d grab that pan with my hook then pour it, but if you’re right here…”

Sirius sighed dramatically and then used his wand to carefully guide the pan from under the furnace to float above the molds.

“Just dump it in?” he asked.

“Slowly,” Tony stressed. “Don’t let it splash and make sure you get all three molds.”

Sirius screwed his face up in a cute look of concentration - just because Tony was soon to be a married man didn’t mean he was blind - as he followed Tony’s instructions.

“Done!” Sirius said victoriously after he finished. He looked as gleeful as Tony was about the whole project. “What now?”

“Now,” Tony checked the time, “I’ve got an appointment I need to get to. These should be set by the time I get back, then I can build it and have Harry try it on when he gets home.”

“An appointment? Are you sick?” Sirius asked. He put the back of his hand on Tony’s forehead and groaned. “I knew it, getting engaged is killing you, isn’t it?”

Tony smacked Sirius’ hand away with a chuckle. He didn’t know if it was the fact that Harry finally came to him first or just the contentment that came from knowing he would have his family for the rest of his life, but Tony felt oddly fond of Sirius in the moment.

Which was a mostly new emotion as Tony typically felt jealous of Sirius at any given time.

“It’s for Pepper’s wedding present,” Tony told Sirius. “Hey! You want to come with?”

Sirius’ face lit up. “Can we take the bikes?”

“Obviously we’re taking the bikes.”

Sure, it was a frozen and freezing tundra outside, but Tony had a heated jacket and Sirius had magic. So, yeah, obviously they were taking the bikes.

 

Tony felt fifteen years younger on the drive. If he closed his eyes, he was back in London, racing Sirius while James and Lily cheered him on from the veranda of the pub.

Tony didn’t close his eyes though. Aside from the obvious safety concerns that would occur if Tony tried to drive a motorcycle blind, Tony didn’t want to close his eyes.

Why would he go back to the past when he had more than he ever thought he wanted in the present?

Tony had a brilliant and gorgeous woman who loved him and wanted to be with him for the rest of their lives. Tony had a son who was probably the strongest person that Tony knew. Tony had a few good friends who he knew had his back when it came down to it.

Even better than the present would be the future, and that was what Tony wanted to focus on. A future where Harry would walk again. A future where Tony had his own family. A future where they had a home, not just a place to live.

“You cheated,” Tony said as soon as he parked his bike. Sirius beat him to the location by eighty-seven seconds. “I saw that car suddenly decided to turn,” he said, pointing at Sirius accusingly.

Sirius leaned against the Ducati that Tony gave him and was the image of arrogant indifference.

“You got me mixed up with some other bloke,” Sirius said airily. He looked around the empty land they parked in front of. “What are we doing here?”

‘Here’ being the twenty acre lot that Tony planned to purchase. It was perfect, in Tony’s opinion. It sat on the edge of the bay that surrounded Woodsburgh, giving it a beach vibe that Tony liked. It was also close enough to both Stark Industry headquarters and Midtown that commute wouldn’t be an issue.

“This is where I’m going to build a house,” Tony told him. He could imagine it perfectly, so he tried to describe his vision to Sirius.

“I’ll have a detached barn over there,” Tony waved his hand around as he spoke. “That’ll be for my lab, keep it separate from the house. Then I’m thinking a ranch-style house, all one floor? But with a finished apartment style basement for Harry, maybe make it two bedrooms, so his friends can crash here too.

“Then if I put the master room on that far side over there, we’ll see the sunset from our windows. I thought about flipping it to see the sunrise, but I don’t want to be woken at the literal crack of dawn every day.

“So then the kids’ rooms will be—”

“Woah!” Sirius let Tony ramble about his plans for a while but then he abruptly interrupted. When Tony blinked at him, Sirius’ eyebrows were high on his forehead. “Kids rooms?” he asked. “As in, more than just Harry?”

“Yeah?” Tony ran an uncertain hand through his hair before dropping his arm to his side. “Why not?”

Sirius locked his lower lip between his teeth for a moment, stressing Tony out.

Harry said he wanted siblings, but… but Sirius knew Harry a hell of a lot better than Tony did. Maybe Harry only said it because he thought Tony and Pepper wanted him to?

Fuck.

Tony didn’t even consider that.

Just when Tony’s thoughts were spiraling off in worry that Harry was perfectly content being an only child, Sirius stepped forward and put a hand on Tony’s shoulder.

“You’re a good dad, Tony, you should have more kids. I bet Pepper would be a hell of a mum.”

“You don’t think Harry will secretly resent them for the rest of his life?” Tony asked, aiming for sarcasm and failing spectacularly.

There was a flash of something across Sirius’ face, a look of concern or some other emotion that was replaced by a charming smile too quickly for Tony to identify it.

“Harry loves kids,” Sirius said. He squeezed Tony’s shoulder once more before he stuffed his hands in his leather jacket pockets and turned to look around at the land. “You going to sell the tower?” he asked, a complete and appreciated change in subject.

“I do use that tower for more than just hosting the homeless,” Tony joked. He nudged Sirius with his shoulder and pointed toward an area far back from where he planned to put the house. “How many bedrooms do you want? Two? Three?”

“What?” Sirius looked over at Tony in surprise. “What are you talking about?”

“You can’t live in my house, I don’t need Pepper exposed to your naked ass every day, but, yeah, I figured I’d add a place for you.” Tony shrugged. “Harry and his future siblings will want their godfather around. And it’ll save me from having to get more animals, they can just play fetch with you if they get bored.”

Tony felt an uncomfortable itch on the back of his neck when Sirius’ grey eyes glazed over with what looked like tears. Tony was not a ‘let’s cry together’ kind of guy, no matter that he had done it before in Sirius’ arms.

Thankfully, Sirius only sniffed quietly and then turned back to look at the property.

“Three rooms then,” he said quietly. “So my godkids can come stay the night when you piss them off.”

Sirius stayed quiet while Tony met with the realtor and signed the deal for the property. As soon as the ground defrosted, Tony could hire a crew and get the place built. If all went to plan, Tony could move his family in after the wedding that summer.

Everything was almost too good to be true.

 

Tony and Sirius split up on the drive home. Sirius went to meet up with Stephen - and Tony had to assume that Stephen was magical in bed because Tony couldn’t imagine what Sirius saw in the arrogant prick - while Tony rushed back to the tower to finish building Harry’s leg.

The molds had set perfectly and Tony was gentle as he removed pieces for assembly. Even hollowed out, the vibranium mixed with iron alloy was strong enough that it could support an infinite amount of weight without bending.

Tony wanted to test its weight, but he’d seen Thor hit the shield with his hammer without even leaving a dent, so he figured it was sturdy enough.

The assembly took a little longer than Tony planned, but Harry’s leg had a lot more pieces than the ones he made before. The place where Harry’s thigh would rest needed to be able to expand as Harry got older. The upper and lower portions needed to have telescoping pieces installed for growth.

And the knee was just a bitch to do. Teeny tiny screws and paper thin plates to make the joint bend and move just like a leg? It was more intricate than the kneecap on Tony’s favorite suit was.

By the time JARVIS alerted Tony that Harry had returned from school, Tony had just applied the thick layer of gel in the top socket.

With more compartments than Harry could begin to need, three separate trackers imbedded in the metal, and a fail-safe taser connected with the toes that could be activated by a button behind the knee? It was a work of art.

Not to pat himself on the back, but that leg was beautiful. Underneath a pair of jeans and it would be impossible to tell it was even artificial.

Tony hid the leg under a tarp and waited for Harry to make his way to the lab. Harry would know that Tony worked tirelessly on his new limb, but Tony still wanted a dramatic reveal.

When Harry finally clanked his way in the lab (a noise that Tony would be thrilled to not have to hear again), he looked exhausted while Tony had never felt more awake.

“Hey, Dad,” Harry said. He tossed his backpack on the floor by the door and carefully made his way through the path of junk to get to where Tony stood.

“Rough day?” Tony asked, concerned with the tired bags under Harry’s eyes. Harry shrugged and popped down on one of the stools Tony had by his workstation.

“The perk of homeschooling was much less hopping around all day,” Harry said. He winced as he reached down to rub his left leg. “I dunno, it started aching in chemistry, I reckon even my stump doesn’t like chemical bonds.”

“Did you take anything for it?” Tony asked.

Harry rolled his eyes up to the ceiling and sighed.

“Yeah, I was gonna take a pain potion in the middle of muggle school. That wouldn’t be hard to explain at all, would it?”

“Smartass,” Tony said fondly. He had plenty of bottles of ibuprofen laying around, a side-effect of his chronic headaches; he grabbed a bottle and gave Harry two tablets before tucking it in the side of his backpack.

“Take two if you need them at school and let me know what time you took them,” Tony told Harry.

Harry was smart and responsible in his own way, but keeping track of medications was not his strong suit.

Harry agreed easily enough as he made a little portal to get a bottle of water from the kitchen.

“Portaling has made you lazy,” Tony laughed.

“I’ve got one leg,” Harry said drily. “The less hopping I do, the better.”

“Touché,” Tony said. He grabbed the edge of the tarp and waited until Harry took the medicine to gain his son’s complete attention.

“You’ll need to find a new excuse though because…” Tony ripped the tarp off in a dramatic flourish. “Tada! Now you have two legs!”

Harry actually gasped in what seemed to be incredibly vindicating surprise.

“This… you made this?” Harry asked, wide eyed. He reached out to touch the fully functioning ankle and Tony smiled at the impressed look on Harry’s face.

“Sirius helped some,” Tony said. He could give Sirius some credit because that look of shock and admiration was being aimed directly at Tony.

“It looks so real,” Harry murmured. He stroked the metal softly, a smile slowly stretching on his face. “Was it expensive to make?” he asked abruptly.

“Nope, I used some material I already had laying around,” Tony said, not even lying. “You wanna try it on? See if we need to make any adjustments?”

“Alright then,” Harry said, suddenly wary. Tony didn’t give him time to get nervous, he couldn’t wait to see Harry walk again.

Tony grabbed the prosthetic and waited for Harry to roll up his jeans until Tony could see his thigh.

Thanks to Stephen and Sirius, the scarring was minimal and it healed perfectly.

“All you have to do is put your leg in here and then tighten this part, or loosen it, whatever you need,” Tony explained while he fit the leg to Harry’s thigh. Once it was secured, Tony backed up a couple of feet and held his hands out.

“You ready?” he asked Harry.

Harry took a deep breath and Tony thanked himself for installing so many cameras in his lab, it was a moment he needed to have recorded for posterity.

“If I fall and break my other leg, I’m going to tell Pepper to marry Clint,” Harry said, hiding his nerves behind a scowled comment. It was getting easier and easier to interpret Harry-sass - it just took some practice.

“Good idea,” Tony replied seriously. “Then you can have Nat as an aunt.”

“Ugh.” Harry sighed again and then held his hands out to Tony while he planted his feet on the floor. “Don’t- don’t let me fall.”

“I won’t,” Tony said solemnly. “C’mon, kid, you can do this. Two tiny steps.”

Harry squeezed Tony’s hands tight as he shakily stood up and adjusted to the feel of it.

“All good?” Tony asked. “No pinching or anything?”

Harry shook his head. “Nothing.”

“Alright, two steps,” Tony encouraged him. “I’ve got you, you’re not going to fall.”

Tony just needed Harry to trust him again, trust that Tony wouldn’t let him fall.

Harry held Tony’s hand in an iron grip and moved his right foot forward before slowly lifting his left foot and taking a step forward.

“I did it!” Harry cried, he let out a surprised laugh. “Dad! I did it!”

“You did it!” Tony agreed with his own laugh. They both let out victory cheers when Harry took another step.

Tony backed up so Harry could walk forward and it only took Harry two more steps before he let go of Tony’s hands.

“Dad…” Harry looked down at his feet and then up at Tony and there were tears welling up and dripping over the edges. “Dad, I can walk.”

Tony wasn’t a ‘let’s cry together’ kind of guy when it came to anyone else in the galaxy. But when he got to watch his son take his first steps after months of rehab and surgery and trauma?

 

Then Tony was apparently a ‘let’s cry together’ kind of dad.

Chapter Text

Saturday, January 13

When Hermione answered the phone, she looked frantic and exhausted and a little crazy… which meant she was probably in the library.

“Harry, it is seven in the morning in New York,” Hermione scowled in the phone immediately. Her hair was a bushy, tangled, mess, and it made Harry grin to watch her tug on a lock of it.

“Why are you awake?” Hermione asked.

Harry smoothed his smile to something innocent and he shrugged his shoulders up.

“I’m taking Joey for a walk before I go to the VA,” Harry said airily. He waited for Hermione to pick up on what he said.

“It’s cold outside,” Hermione snapped. “You’ll get sick.”

Hermione must have been truly studying something terribly important for her to miss what Harry said.

“Joey wanted to go for a walk,” Harry repeated. Joey was actually being a good dog for their first walk together since the first of November. Harry had been worried that Joey would yank and pull on the leash, which would cause Harry to stumble, fall, and possibly break his fake leg.

Tony said Harry couldn’t break the leg, but if anyone could accidentally break an indestructible leg- it would be Harry.

But Joey was being perfect. He didn’t pull on the leash or chase after birds. He stayed right by Harry’s side and let Harry set the pace for them. Joey was even smart enough to bark when a rock on the sidewalk or a step approached, which gave Harry plenty of time to prepare.

It was awkward, walking with a fake leg. It made Harry’s stump uncomfortable and he knew he wouldn’t manage their usual lengthy walk, but it was still a walk.

Hermione still didn’t seem to understand what Harry was saying and he huffed, annoyed that his dramatic declaration was being ignored for OWLS.

“Hermione.” Harry stared dead at the phone until Hermione gave him her complete attention. “I am taking my dog for a walk.”

Hermione blinked at Harry and he could see the gears in her eyes shifting from OWLS to Harry’s news. It took her nearly an entire minute and then she screamed so loud that Harry could hear Madam Pince in the background scolding her.

“YOU CAN WALK?!”

Harry grinned when the phone screen was a blurred mess and then a familiar and freckled nose pressed right up against the screen.

“Mate, you’re walking?!” Ron demanded. “How? When? Why didn’t you tell us?!”

“What do you think I’m doing right now?” Harry laughed. “I went ahead and got a prosthetic made. Well, I mean… my dad - er, Tony - he made it, but I asked him to. Oh, Happy actually said…”

Hermione had snatched the phone back from Ron and patiently listened to Harry’s nervous rambling for a minute. Harry didn’t know why he felt nervous, but Hermione’s eyes filling up with tears certainly didn’t help any.

“Don’t bloody cry,” Harry eventually sighed. “It’s fine. Look!” Harry turned screen so he could hold his left foot up and wiggle his shoe.

Which would have caused Harry to fall on his arse when the prosthetic twisted on his stump in an unfamiliar motion, but Joey saved him with a quick yank of the leash.

“Does it hurt?” Hermione asked when Harry turned the camera back to his face. “Everything I read said it can be terribly uncomfortable at first—”

“Nevermind that!” Ron cried from the background. “Ask him if it does anything cool?”

Hermione turned her head and scoffed at Ron who was out of Harry’s sight.

“Is walking not cool enough?” she demanded. “Does it need extra attachments to help our best friend walk? Hm?”

Harry nodded in innocent agreement with Hermione. And then, as soon as he made it back to the Tower, he hung up on her and text Ron.

It’s got taser toes. It’s like a jolt of electricity that shoots out if I press a button.

Brilliant!

 

Tony peppered Harry with as many questions as Hermione had on the drive to the VA.

“Does it still feel okay? Any soreness? Doctor Torres said you shouldn’t wear it for more than three or four hours a day at first, how many hours has it been on? Did the knee bend okay? How’s the rotation on the ankle?”

“It’s fine!” Harry all but shouted after ten minutes of questions. “Sorry, sorry.” He felt bad for shouting when Tony made the damn thing and was only trying to be nice. “It’s just… it’s fine, alright?” he said much more calmly.

Tony glanced over at Harry and had his eyes hidden behind his sunglasses so Harry couldn’t see if he was irritated or not.

“Will you tell me if there’s a problem with it?” he asked evenly.

Harry shrugged. “Suppose so.”

Even if that sounded like the most ungrateful way to show his appreciation for the ability to walk again.

“And you won’t wear it for more than three or four hours a day until the doctor clears you?”

Harry crossed his fingers under his right leg and nodded his head.

“Sure.”

 

When they arrived at the VA, Harry was again struck by the same pang in his chest as usual at the sight of the building.

If it hadn’t literally been part of Anderson’s last words to Harry, Harry might never have went to another meeting there.

Sitting in the building of the place where they held Anderson’s funeral? Seeing everyone and thinking of the one who was missing? It was a particularly cruel sort of agony.

It was also familiar though and Harry also felt more at ease around the others there. All of them made an effort to include Harry in their stories and jokes, and Harry even exchanged numbers with Greene and they were currently planning a ‘cripples field trip’.

Greene wanted to go play paintball, but Godwin shut that down at the last meeting.

“You trying to send us all to the psych ward, Greene?” she’d demanded. “The first p in PTSD stands for paintball, dumbass.”

Personally, Harry thought paintball sounded loads more fun than going to a museum, which had been Booker’s suggestion.

Harry wobbled some when he climbed out of the passenger seat of Tony’s car and Tony was quick to try and help steady him.

“I’m fine,” Harry said, brushing him off. Harry wanted to walk in on his own, just like the others did with their prosthetics.

Anderson told Harry to keep going to meetings and get a leg.

So Harry did.

Harry walked in the meeting room in the VA with Taylor Anderson’s dog tags tucked beneath his shirt and his chin held high.

“Holy shit.” Lawrence was the first one to notice Harry and he smacked Simmons until she turned to look as well.

“Am I late?” Harry asked. He beamed when the others stood up (except for Greene who needed work done on his prosthetics and was back in a wheelchair) and clapped and whistled.

“Baby Stark got a new leg!” Stokes cheered. He slapped Harry’s shoulder with his right hand, which was actually a bit painful considering that his hand was made of metal.

Harry dropped in a seat between Godwin and Greene and slapped at Greene when he prodded Harry’s left knee.

“Piss off,” Harry laughed.

“Give us a show, Baby Stark,” Lawrence said. He wiggled his black eye brows at Harry with a stupid grin. “Let’s see some fake skin.”

“He’s fifteen!” Tony yelled. Harry looked over his shoulder and saw that Tony had joined Sam by the coffee cart and watched Harry with a fond smile.

“Try not to be too jealous,” Harry warned them all. He pulled the leg of his jeans up so he could twist his leg out and show the group the shining metal.

“Fuck, bro.” Greene whistled lowly and reached out to touch the metal. “What the hell kind of material is this?”

Harry shrugged, “Metal?”

“No, this is metal.” Godwin leaned down so she could place one of her arms beside Harry’s leg. There was a difference, even Harry could see that. His leg looked like silky silver while Godwin’s arm was a dull gray.

“Er…” Harry looked over toward Tony again, but saw he was caught up in a conversation with Sam that involved a lot of arm movements.

“No idea,” Harry admitted. “Dad says it’s indestructible though.”

“That’s what they say about tanks, man,” Mendez said. “Then a bomb hits and— PEW!”

Harry blinked at Mendez.

“Mate, I think my chances of joining the military ended in a potato truck in Mexico,” he said dryly. “So I’m not too worried about bombs.”

“You should be,” Greene muttered. “The US is going to be bombed in the next ten years, bro. Just when we think we’re safe- boom!” Greene smacked the armrest of his wheelchair hard. “China blows our asses to bits.”

The others were quiet and exchanged worried looks that Harry wasn’t exempt from. There was a faraway look in Greene’s eyes and Harry wished they hadn’t brought up bombs.

“If they do it tomorrow then I won’t have to take a math test Monday,” Harry said.

It was stupid, Harry was just trying to push through the painfully awkward moment, but Greene looked over at Harry and had a faint smile on his lips.

“Better get those grades up or even the Marines won’t want you,” Simmons quipped, breaking the spell.

The others started laughing and exchanging barbs that Harry didn’t quite understand about different branches of the military. And as soon as Harry asked why Marines ate crayons, they took great pleasure in disparaging Harry of any idea of ever joining the Marines.

“Harry’s not joining the military,” Tony said when he joined mid-conversation. He leaned on the wall behind Jones and winked at Harry.

“I dunno, man, they’ll write waivers for prosthetics,” Mendez said. He smirked at Harry with a brow raised. “Think you could do it?”

Harry considered it for a moment.

It would probably come easy to Harry, fighting in a war if it was something he believed in.

Not that Harry had a particular opinion on American freedom as he was British, but still.

Harry could see himself in a uniform like the others wore. Carrying a gun wouldn’t be much different than a wand, except every bullet was Avada Kedavra.

It might even be a natural choice for Harry.

Except Harry could also see himself miserable and dying inside the entire time. Fighting wasn’t… it wasn’t fun. It wasn’t something Harry wanted to do.

Not with a wand, not with a gun.

If a fight couldn’t be avoided, Harry would defend himself and the people he cared about, but that was as far as Harry would consider it.

“Not a chance,” Harry told the others. He scowled playfully at Mendez, who had probably been joking anyway. “I’ve seen what your life is like, I’m not interested.”

Mendez laughed with good-natured humor but Jones shook his head at Harry.

“If the draft comes knocking, I hope you like MRE’s, my guy.”

Harry’s eyes flew to Tony’s, momentarily panicked at the thought. Tony only grinned though, not even concerned.

“Don’t worry, kid, if your last name doesn’t exempt you, your extensive psych history will.”

Harry grinned in relief. “You’re saying having a broken brain has finally come in handy?”

“Being crazy always comes in handy,” Booker said. “‘I’d like to plead not guilty by reason of insanity, Your Honor.’”

Greene was the only one who didn’t laugh at Booker’s joke.

“We’ll see who’s laughing when China strikes and they pull all our asses back in the fight,” he said darkly. “Hell, Uncle Sam might just use us as canon fodder. The more of us that are dead, the less we drain the system and remind them that we exist.”

Harry wasn’t sure what was going on with Greene, but he didn’t exactly seem like he was having a very good time. Harry waited until the meeting broke up to ask him about it though.

Greene wheeled himself to the door as soon as Sam called it and Harry murmured to Tony that he needed a minute before quickly trying to follow him.

“Slow down,” Harry complained when Greene was damn near to the doors and Harry barely made it out of the meeting room. “Your chair is faster than my bloody leg.”

Greene ignored Harry and went straight outside, leaving Harry to catch up with him.

“Mate, what’s up?” Harry asked as soon as he made it outside. Greene was just sitting in his chair, in the freezing wind, staring out at the parking lot.

Harry liked Greene. He was only twenty and the two of them had a lot of common tastes in music and interests. They both had German Shepherd dogs, Greene’s was a pretty brown female named ‘Lucy’. Greene introduced Harry to an app called ‘TikTok’ and kept Harry in constant supply of videos that were just stupid enough to be hysterical. They had even planned on going to a concert together that summer, so Harry wasn’t sure why he was being froze out, but he didn’t think it had anything to do with him really.

And Harry might have dropped it-

If it weren’t for Anderson.

If Harry didn’t see Greene sounding a bit crazy and acting off and didn’t immediately think of Anderson, he would have dropped it.

“Sky?” Harry tentatively put his hand on Greene’s shoulder. “You good?”

Greene didn’t even blink and when he finally spoke, he sounded dazed and shocked.

“I got fired,” he said. “Last week. I just cashed my final check on Friday and it’s- it’s not even enough to cover half my rent.”

“Oh.” Harry was relieved at the relatively simple fix. It was sort of impossible to spend almost all of his time around Tony and Sirius and not see the way that money could fix a lot of problems.

“How much do you need?” Harry asked him. He held his hands up when Greene looked up at him and glared daggers with his blue eyes. It wasn’t hard to guess what his sudden irritation was, Harry didn’t like charity either.

“I can loan you money and you can pay me back when you get a new job,” Harry amended himself. He didn’t actually care to be paid back, but he thought it might appease Greene’s pride.

“I don’t want your fucking money,” Greene snapped. He grabbed Harry’s wrist and threw it off his shoulder. “I want my life back. I want my girl back, I want my shitty job back. I JUST WANT MY FUCKING LIFE BACK!”

Harry reeled back and finally saw what the emotion was in the back of Greene’s eyes that had been there all morning.

It was pain and misery.

It was painfully familiar.

It was the same look Anderson had—

“I’m proud of you, man, you know that?”

It was the same look Harry saw in the mirror for weeks, months.

“Sky…” Harry dropped to his knees beside Greene’s chair, feeling just as lost as he was sore from standing and walking so much.

“Just go home, bro,” Greene said flatly. He looked back out at the parking lot and Harry saw the muscles in his jaw clench. “I’m fine. I’m not going to fucking hang myself.”

Harry flinched and Greene must have seen it because he softened his tone some.

“Sorry, it’s just…” Greene huffed and slumped his shoulders. “It was two years this week since this.” Greene wiggled his stumps. “And life is just… it sucks so bad, bro.” Greene’s voice broke at the end and Harry looked away from his face so Greene didn’t know Harry saw the tear that leaked out.

“Taylor made it look easy,” Greene said bleakly. “I mean, I can’t fucking hang myself because I can’t stand up, but it’s not like I haven’t thought about it.”

Harry, extremely subtly, and with a skill he had perfected during long boring hours in US History, pulled his phone from his pocket and relied on memory instead of sight to pull up Tony and send an SOS text.

If Greene was thinking about killing himself, then he might do it. Harry thought about it for months… months and months… and then he did it.

And Tony caught him, so maybe he could catch Greene because Merlin knew Harry didn’t have any idea what to do to help. He kind of doubted saying ‘Go inside and find Hermione’ would work, and that was the extent of what Sirius said when Harry had dangled on the edge of the Astronomy Tower.

“You believe in Hell?” Greene asked. Harry didn’t think he was really talking to him, since he answered himself. “My mom did, Catholic, you know. Catholicism says if you commit suicide, you go to Hell. But I don’t think Taylor would have went to Hell, I just don’t. My man saved lives, what God would send him to Hell just because he wanted to be done with the pain?

“Hell is this shit, bro. It’s trying to save your skin and still losing your life. I’m still breathing, but I just… I wish I’d died there,” he said quietly, hurting Harry’s chest with his plaintive words.

Someone cleared their throat behind Harry and he put a hand on Greene’s shoulder - just reminding himself that he was still there - and was relieved when it was Tony standing behind them. Harry met Tony’s eyes and felt like there was a moment where they communicated silently with each other.

Tony was there to catch Greene. It wasn’t Harry’s job, it wasn’t a job for a teenager.

“I’ll just go…” Harry trailed off when it was clear that Greene wasn’t listening to him anyway. When Tony offered Harry a hand to get to his feet, Harry accepted it then.

“You think you can drive yourself home?” Tony murmured once Harry was on his feet.

Harry was a terrible driver and portaling was easier, but…

“Absolutely,” Harry said solemnly. He gave away the small spark of glee that Tony’s offer lit with a cheeky grin. “Are you going to kick me out if I wreck?”

“Nope. I’ll make you help me rebuild it,” Tony said airily. He gave Harry his keys and held Harry’s hand in his for a moment. “If you think you’re going to wreck, make a portal, okay?”

Harry flushed that he’d been basically called out as they both knew he had a much simpler method home, but he was still eager to drive the car by himself.

“Deal.” Harry sent an uncertain look to where Greene sat, still silent and distant. “You’ll- you’ll help him, right, Dad?”

“Mm, I’ll get him help,” Tony said quietly. “Go on, don’t wreck. Pep’s at home.”

Harry could admit that he loved his dad, he was certain of it. But Harry was also a fifteen year old with the keys to a flashy sports car, two feet to drive with, and a boyfriend who lived twenty miles away. So when the choice went to being a good son or doing something that sounded fun, well…

Harry didn’t have a lot of fun recently.

 

If nothing else, Peter had been appropriately impressed when Harry showed up at his house not only driving, but also walking.

 

The two of them goofed off for a few hours. Peter tried to help Harry get back on a skateboard, but Harry’s leg was awkward and difficult to manage on a board.

“You’ll get it,” Peter said confidently.

Harry hummed an agreement while he remained skeptical. He was crap at it before he lost a leg, he didn’t imagine that a prosthetic had somehow improved his skill.

Peter was helping Harry with studying for his test on Monday when Pepper texted Harry and asked him to come home.

“Time to face the muuuusic,” Peter sang.

“There’s no music to face,” Harry said. “My phone is tracked, the car is tracked, my bloody leg is tracked. If Dad wanted me home before now, he would have told me so.”

“Point,” Peter agreed. “Hey, you think Greene’s going to be okay?”

Harry thought it over while he packed his stuff in his backpack.

“Yeah,” he said confidently. “I mean Dad’ll probably figure out what to do, you know?”

Peter spun around in his desk chair and cocked his head to the side.

“I’m surprised you let Tony handle it,” he said.

Harry faltered in his prior confidence.

“Why wouldn’t I have?” he asked slowly. “You think I should have stayed?”

He should have. Harry should have stayed. Damn.

Harry just thought that it was one of those things that were out of his ability to fix.

“No, it was a smart move to have your dad do it,” Peter assured him. He stood up and popped his back before grinning at Harry again. “It’s just surprising.”

Harry narrowed his eyes and gave Peter a curt goodbye and only begrudgingly returned his kiss—

It might surprise Peter, but Harry wasn’t stupid enough to ignore his rather fit boyfriend when he was offering up his mouth to kiss.

 

“AND THEN HE CALLED ME STUPID!” Harry smacked the steering wheel and then quickly corrected the car when it caused the wheels to jerk.

Ginny’s sigh was audible even over the Bluetooth connection Harry had going between them. He had called Hermione first, but she asked if it was an emergency (Harry said yes and when he started talking she just hung up on him) and so he called Ginny to vent.

“You are stupid,” Ginny said. “He wasn’t saying it was surprising you made a smart decision, he was saying it was surprising you asked Tony to deal with it.”

“How is that surprising?!” Harry demanded while he kept his eyes on the road. Driving wasn’t hard, necessarily, but the other cars made Harry nervous. If one of them swerved and hit Harry’s car, then it would be tricky explaining how he doesn’t technically have a license.

“Okay, let’s play pretend,” Ginny said. “Remember the Yule Ball?”

Harry snorted. “Yeah, I do.”

“And remember when Ron and Hermione got in that big fight?”

Harry wasn’t sure where Ginny was going with her story.

“Yeah?” he said.

“What would you have done if Ron had gotten depressed over that fight with Hermione and said he was thinking about drinking enough Dreamless Sleep to kill himself?”

Harry clenched his jaw in brief irritation. Every time someone mentioned killing themselves it brought up a sick feeling of shame in Harry for his own actions and a wave of grief for his friend.

“I dunno, tell him not to do it?” Harry said. “Ron wouldn’t do that though, he’s not- Ron’s not…”

Ron wasn’t a quitter was what Harry couldn’t say.

“Your best mate says he wants to kill himself and you’d say ‘no, don’t’?” Ginny scoffed. “Think about it, what would you really have done?”

Harry considered it seriously for a minute while he drove. If Ron had told Harry after the Yule Ball that he wanted to die, what would Harry have done?

“I’d tell McGonagall,” Harry decided. “And then she could take Ron to the Hospital Wing or call your mum or something.”

“Liar.”

“I’m not lying,” Harry said hotly, a bit overly defensive.

Ginny sighed again and Harry was getting as fed up with her as Hermione was him.

“Harry Potter never would have gotten a teacher if his friend was in trouble, he would have handled it himself,” Ginny said. “Which is stupid. So Peter was probably just surprised that Harry Stark—”

“Potter-Stark.”

“Whatever. Peter was probably just surprised that you, for the first time in your bloody life, let an adult handle a situation,” Ginny said. “For the record, so am I. Congrats, Harry, you’re growing up.”

When Harry hung up a few minutes later, after letting Ginny vent about Luna and her bullies that Ginny plotted murder for (Harry mentioned locking them in Slytherins Chamber and Ginny thought it was a brilliant idea), Harry considered what she said.

Maybe Harry was ‘growing up’ or maybe, for the first time in his life, he had an adult he trusted to take care of difficult problems.

Not that Sirius wasn’t trustworthy, but most of his plans tended to be incredibly illegal. And also there was that problem with Sirius also running to Tony about Harry’s problems, so it was just for the best that Harry cut out the middleman on occasion.

 

By the time Harry made it up to the flat, he was limping, sore, and relieved to see Pepper waiting for him.

“For the love of God, Harry, how long have you been walking on that leg?” she asked the second Harry stepped off the lift.

Harry checked his watch and grimaced.

“Er… since I woke up,” he said. “Is Dad home?”

“He stopped by long enough to tell me to tell you that your friend is safe and that you were right to get him,” Pepper said. She patted the seat beside her on the sofa. “Come sit down and rest. You weren’t supposed to be wearing that prosthetic for more than three hours a day.”

Harry limped over to the sofa and immediately breathed easier with the weight off his leg. He’d tried to rest it while he drove, but the stress of driving kept having him tense his leg up.

“Are you hungry?” Pepper asked. Her soft face was wrinkled up with concern as she watched Harry massage his stump over his clothes.

“I’m fine,” Harry told her. “Where’s Dad?”

Pepper hesitated just long enough for Harry to start trying to stand back up.

“Just relax,” Pepper said. She grabbed Harry’s right hand and held it between hers as she guided him back to the sofa. “He’s with Sirius, nobody’s hurt.”

Harry sensed a ‘but’ in Pepper’s tone.

“But we should wait until he gets back to talk,” Pepper went on.

“Is Greene really okay?” Harry asked anxiously. “Shit. He hurt himself, didn’t he? Or- is it Sirius? Did he go on some stupid mission and get hurt? Is it- JOEY!” Harry called for his dog as he tried to mentally list off the people that could cause Pepper to want to ‘talk’.

“Your zoo is fine,” Pepper said quickly. She rolled her neck in what seemed to be resignation. “Your dad is talking with lawyers.”

“What?” Harry’s panic receded and he blinked at Pepper in complete confusion. “Why?”

Harry would have remembered hitting someone else’s car while he drove…

“Harry…” Pepper reached over and grasped one of Harry’s hands again. She held it tightly and smoothed her thumb over the back of his hand and refused to let Harry pull away.

“President Quahag called your dad,” she said slowly. “They released Barnes from the hospital in London, he’s being held in the magical prison in Massachusetts until his trial.”

Harry’s heart skipped a beat and suddenly he could smell his flesh rotting away, he could taste the earthy scent of potatoes in his mouth, crushing him. Harry’s ears wanted to fill with buzzing that would make everything meaningless again, but Harry couldn’t let it.

“Trial?” Harry asked faintly. He felt lightheaded and had to squeeze Pepper’s hand to stay grounded.

“The prosecutor wants to meet with you, to get your testimony,” Pepper said. “They’re charging him with a number of felonies.”

Harry nodded his head even if he didn’t quite understand.

It was… it was something that someone was being charged for their crimes against Harry. But Bucky had been sick. Harry had seen it, felt it.

“When do I have to talk to them?” Harry asked Pepper.

“As soon as your dad and Sirius find a lawyer to go with you,” Pepper said. She was the one to squeeze Harry’s hand then. “You don’t have to do it alone, honey. We’re all here for you.”

“What happens if I don’t?” Harry asked, a bit desperate. He looked over at Pepper and saw that she looked about as happy as Harry was.

“What if I don’t want to talk to them?” he asked again. “I just… everything’s better now,” he said, his voice quivering some. “I can walk and my grades are better. Strange said I’m a good student. And Peter…” Harry trailed off when Pepper didn’t interrupt to say that he didn’t have to. She just let him ramble with her pretty teal eyes sad and soft.

“I have to?” Harry asked.

“If you don’t, then he could walk away from it all,” Pepper said carefully. “It’s unfair, I know. But without your testimony, then there might be no consequences for his actions.”

Why did that burden fall to Harry? Why did Harry have to lose a limb, lose a part of himself, and then have to relive it to complete strangers?

“I know.” Pepper let go of Harry’s hand so she could pull him to her side while Harry stared blankly at the wall across from them.

“You don’t need to decide anything right now,” Pepper murmured. “We’ll talk about it with you dad.”

Harry nodded in acknowledgement and then just let Pepper cuddle him in her side for a while. It was nice having Pepper there, Pepper caring.

 

Harry imagined that if his mum could meet Pepper that she’d probably like her.

Chapter Text

Thursday, January 18

“I want to start this meeting off by reminding all parties that my client is a minor and if he or his father—”

Sirius cleared his throat.

“Or his legal godparent—”

Rhodey coughed.

“Or his other legal godfather have any objections to a question asked or request a break that their wishes will be immediately granted.”

The lawyer that Tony retained on Harry’s behalf, Julian Al Saud, folded his hands on the conference table and stared down all the attendees. He made an impressive picture, Tony would give him that. Al Saud wore a sharp Tom Ford suit and his smooth baby face was no match for his professional demeanor and cool ‘I crush defense attorneys beneath the heel of my leather boots for breakfast’.

For a wizard, he was the best dressed one that Tony had met.

“Is that understood?” Al Saud asked.

The others around the table, Tony, Harry, Sirius, Rhodey, President Quahog, the prosecutor for the state, and Barnes’ court appointed defense attorney, all agreed to his demand.

Tony doubted if the President of the Magical United States got personally involved in every criminal case that was tried, but Harry was a ‘special case’. Tony Stark’s son, the Boy-Who-Lived, whose godfather was the first ever publicly acknowledged wizard in history and who was attacked by the ‘Slaying Soldier’.

It was a high publicity case with the added bonus of it being the first federal case in the last fifty years in MACUSA’s history.

And all Tony cared about was his son getting justice and not disappearing from him again.

“Wonderful,” Al Saud said with one of those cool smiles that didn’t quite reach his dark eyes. He looked at Harry, “Are you ready?”

Harry was pale and quiet sitting at the table beside Tony. He had his fists clenched on his lap with an intensity that made his knuckles white.

“Yes,” Harry said.

They were lucky that Harry even agreed to give his deposition. Harry went back and forth on the matter all week.

Sunday night, he said he would. Then when they were scheduled to leave on Monday for MACUSA Headquarters, Harry changed his mind. Tuesday at school Harry sent a text saying that he was ready and by that night he wasn’t. Tony assured Harry that it was entirely his decision and then waited patiently for a final answer.

The prosecution had spoken with Tony on Monday morning (Tony was such a big fan of wizards with cell phones) and she thought that the state had a decent case without Harry’s testimony. It was only that Harry’s testimony would be the final nail in Barnes’ coffin and everyone involved wanted to give him the opportunity to face Barnes in court.

Personally, Tony wanted Barnes locked up with the key thrown away, but not at the price of Harry reverting back to that meek kid that Tony didn’t recognize from before.

The prosecutor, an intelligent looking woman with black hair and glasses so tacky that Tony could weep, cleared her throat and lifted a paper from the folder in front of her.

“We can start with the charges being lobbied against James Buchanan Barnes,” she said. “Kidnapping in the first degree, an a felony with a punishment between—”

“Objection,” Barnes lawyer interrupted. “What makes this first degree kidnapping?”

Tony and Rhodey exchanged a look over the top of Harry’s head.

It was going to be a long day.

Clearly the President thought so as well because he tapped the table with his wand and a variety of drinks - including a pot of blessed coffee - appeared. Tony grabbed Harry a can of coke before pouring himself coffee and sitting back to watch the lawyers argue.

“Mister Barnes had Mister Potter-Stark for over twelve hours, crossed state lines, and did so to advance the commission of felony murder,” the prosecutor said. She raised an unimpressed eyebrow at the defense attorney. “May I continue?” She continued to read the charges, uninterrupted, at the attorneys nod.

“Kidnapping in the first degree, A felony, with a punishment between twenty years and life. Criminal negligence, B felony, a punishment between ten and fourteen years. First degree stalking, D felony, a punishment between two and seven years. And aggravated harassment in the first degree, E felony, with a punishment between one hundred days and four years. And, to be clear,” the prosecutor glared at Barnes’ attorney, “we will be seeking maximum sentences on all charges, to be served consecutively.”

Tony nodded in firm agreement with the charges and punishments. Harry seemed confused as hell though, a look that Al Saud noticed as well.

“Harry, do you understand the charges being discussed?” he asked.

Harry started to shake his head and only spoke when Tony nudged his foot beneath the table.

They had went over what Al Saud and the prosecutor needed that morning before the others arrived. All Harry had to do was be honest and answer questions out loud for the recording.

“How can someone serve a four year sentence after a life sentence?” Harry asked.

Al Saud smiled, a cosmetically perfect smile that didn’t take warm his expression at all.

“Don’t worry about that, it’s just legal jargon.” He winked at Harry, probably an attempt to reassure him. “Are you ready to proceed?”

Harry frowned and Tony recognized a flash of irritation in his eyes. When Harry’s phone slid out of his pocket a moment later and he began typing without looking - a good skill to have - Tony would bet it was Hermione Granger who would explain that ‘legal jargon’ to him.

“We’re ready,” Tony answered for his son.

“Okay, Harry,” the prosecutor smiled at Harry, “can you tell us about the events of November third?”

Harry straightened up on his chair and Tony put a reassuring arm around his shoulders.

“I went to a bakery down the road from our house—”

“Go back some for us,” Al Saud interrupted. “What led you to bakery?”

“Er… my friend sent me a message and said that Bucky was hurt,” Harry said.

“And Bucky is Mister Barnes, correct?” Al Saud asked.

“Yeah. I mean yes.”

“Had you ever met Mister Barnes before then?” Barnes’ lawyer asked.

Harry glanced at Tony and Tony nodded for him to be honest.

It didn’t matter that Tony warned Harry that Barnes was dangerous. Harry was fifteen, he was a damn kid. Fifteen year olds didn’t have the brain development to think of long-term consequences, and that was on science.

“We met before,” Harry explained. “He followed me around some—”

“Stalked him,” Rhodey said. He lifted his chin with a touch of that good old fashioned military arrogance and stared down Barnes’ lawyer. “Barnes stalked Harry on several occasions which led to his obsession and the subsequent kidnapping.”

The prosecutor leaned over and whispered with Quahog for a moment before she made a note on her paper.

“The state will look into this and will likely be adding a second count of first degree stalking,” she said with a sly smile. “Go on, Harry. Tell us about November third, please.”

“So Peter said that Bucky was hurt and needed help,” Harry said. “I told him to take Bucky to this old bakery down by my house and when I got there, it was Peter who was hurt…”

“Is Barnes not being charged for stabbing Peter?” Sirius asked after Harry described the injury Peter had.

“This is Peter Benjamin Parker?” The prosecutor flipped through a few pages in her folder. “Ah, no. We cannot charge Barnes on behalf of a no-maj, despite his enhanced status.” She nodded again to Harry. “Go on, please.”

Tony kept his arm around Harry while Harry slowly described how he tried to help Peter and wound up being knocked unconscious from behind.

It was some of the worst torture of Tony’s life listening to Harry describe everything. Even though Tony knew what happened, it was worse hearing it all directly from Harry.

When Harry began explaining why he tried to jump from the car, he was interrupted again.

“You’re certain you jumped of your own volition?” Al Saud asked him.

“Yes,” Harry said tersely.

“You weren’t pushed?”

“No.”

“And you’re certain?”

“I jumped from the bloody car, okay?!” Harry snapped. “I’ve fallen from a broom dozens of times, I didn’t expect to break my damn leg!”

“Harry…” The prosecutor shook her head at Harry with a pitying look in her eyes. “Of course you thought it was your best course of action. Merlin knows that any of us may have done the same.”

When even Quahog nodded in agreement, Harry relaxed some.

“Everything’s a bit spotty after that,” Harry said.

“Likely due to the physical trauma and possible concussion,” Al Saud said. “It’s understandable. Tell us what you do remember.”

“And feel free to add how you felt as well.”

Harry looked at the prosecutor as if she had lost her mind.

“Right,” he added flatly. “So I jumped from the car…”

Tony remained blank faced and stoic through most of Harry’s story. It wasn’t until Harry described being drugged against his will that he was interrupted again.

“The state will be adding a charge of third degree assault for drugging Mister Potter-Stark against his will,” the prosecutor said.

Tony wasn’t unhappy that Barnes was going to be buried in felonies, but he needed air.

“I need to make a call,” he lied easily. “Sorry, billion dollar corporation and all.”

“There will be no questions while Mister Stark is out of the room,” Al Saud told the others sternly.

Sirius caught Tony’s eye and nodded shortly before he drew Harry in a conversation about Harry’s old classmate that joined a professional quidditch team.

“Come on, Tones, I’ll walk you outside so you can get signal,” Rhodey offered.

Rhodey stayed quiet while the two of them slipped from the conference room and Tony made a beeline straight for the door to get outside.

“Jesus.” Tony scrubbed his face with his palms and sighed. He stood there for a moment just breathing in the cold air and letting it soothe the slow boiling anger in the pit of his stomach.

“I hate this,” Tony confided to Rhodey quietly. “I hate that he has to sit there and relive it all.”

“I know.” Rhodey put his hand on Tony’s shoulder and squeezed it. “He’s doing good though, Tony. He’s a strong kid. You should be proud.”

Of course Tony was proud of his kid. Harry was the best kid a guy could ask for.

“I am,” Tony said. “I just wish he didn’t have to go through this all over again.”

Rhodey grinned at Tony and jostled him some in a playful manner.

“Listen to Mister Playboy Billionaire Iron Heart,” he said teasingly. “You sound like a real parent, man.”

“Yeah, yeah…” Tony took another deep breath to steady himself and then brushed Rhodey off. “Let’s get this over with.”

As hard as it was for Tony to listen to, it had to be an infinite amount harder for Harry to go through again.

 

When Tony and Rhodey returned to the conference room, Harry was told to continue his story.

“Things were… are… a bit fuzzy,” Harry said.

“A concussion and unregulated dose of dilaudid can do that to a person,” Al Saud said. “Tell us what you remember.”

Harry had his face screwed up in an adorable way that Tony would mentally coo at if they were in better circumstances.

“I remember being sick, real sick,” Harry said. “And Bucky just kept saying ‘we’re almost there’.”

“Excuse me,” Barnes’ lawyer interrupted Harry with a bemused expression. “You were educated formally for four years at Hogwarts School of Magic, correct?”

“It’s a real loose definition of educated,” Harry drawled. He looked at Barnes’ lawyer almost as coldly as Tony did.

It wasn’t the woman’s fault she drew the short straw and had to defend Barnes, but it didn’t make Tony all warm and fuzzy for her either.

“And you are currently homeschooled by Sorcerer Stephen Strange?”

“Yeah and my favorite color’s red, if you’re just asking daft questions.”

Sirius chuckled and even Tony grinned. If the kid ever took school seriously, he’d make one hell of a lawyer.

“It’s relevant,” the defense attorney said. “My question is why did you - at no time - attempt to use magic to escape? You have a citation from this summer where you used magic in a moment of distress. Why not then?”

“While we will remember that Mister Potter-Stark is the victim,” Al Saud glared at Barnes’ lawyer, “you’ll also note that he was suffering from a concussion and began having symptoms of withdrawal within the first twenty-four hours of his kidnapping. If you have any more questions that are less offensive to the victim then you will ask me directly.”

“And I did try,” Harry said. “I tried to apparate or portal away or anything, but my whole body hurt and it didn’t work.”

“I find that I cannot cast as much as a summoning charm when I’m sick,” Quahog said. He curled his lips up just enough to be a smile aimed at Harry. “I believe if you had been examined by healers upon your return that they would have assured you that the moment you broke your leg your magic was attempting to minimize the shock and pain.”

If Quahog ever ran for re-election, Tony would personally donate to his campaign.

“Precisely,” Al Saud agreed. “Harry, if you can continue please.”

Harry sighed heavily and looked directly across the room at the white wall as he spoke.

“I was sick and he kept saying ‘almost there’. I think I kept passing out, I dunno, but I fell asleep in a stolen car and woke up when it felt like I was being crushed.” Harry grimaced and grabbed at his shirt collar while Tony clutched his shoulder in silent support.

“I thought I was going to die,” Harry whispered. “I’ve been cruico’d before, by Voldemort himself—”

Tony didn’t miss the way the witches and wizards twitched at Harry’s words. Sirius even closed his eyes with a pained expression twisting his mouth.

“—but this was worse. I couldn’t breathe. Every time I tried, we hit a bump and then…” Harry trailed off and pulled his collar even tighter.

“Break, now,” Al Saud said. “Everyone clear the room.”

As soon as the lawyers and President cleared the room, Tony grabbed Harry’s hands and squeezed them until Harry focused his glazed eyes on Tony.

“Hey, kid, you’re okay,” Tony said quietly. Sirius was rubbing Harry’s back and looked as miserable as Tony felt.

“I couldn’t breathe,” Harry said frantically. “Dad, I couldn’t breathe.”

“You’re breathing now,” Tony assured him. “Hey, in and out, kid. You’re here.” Tony squeezed his hands hard. “It’s done, over with. You can breathe.”

“Here, take a drink.” Rhodey poured a cup of water for Harry and Tony pressed it in Harry’s hands. It took Harry a moment to make his hand lift the cup, but his rapid breathing slowed down after he drank some of the water.

“You okay, kiddo?” Sirius asked worriedly.

Harry nodded but his hands shook when he put the cup on the table.

“You’re almost done,” Tony reminded him. “This sucks, like ‘accidentally turned yourself into the Hulk’ levels of suck, but it’s almost finished.”

“This is polyjuiced yourself with a cat hair levels of suck,” Harry muttered.

“You can’t use animal hair in Polyjuice?” Sirius said.

Harry nodded over at Sirius. “You should have told Hermione that a few years ago, it would have been useful information to have.”

Tony figured that if Harry was up for being a smartass that he was ready to continue on. Rhodey got up to let the others return while Tony subtly scooted his chair an inch or two closer to his son.

“Let the record show that Mister Potter-Stark experienced significant levels of distress during his deposition,” Al Saud said after he resumed his seat. “It will be my recommendation that he should be allowed consistent breaks during testimony at his or his father’s demand.”

“That’s fair,” Barnes’ lawyer said. She tapped the recording device they had with her wand and everyone turned their attention back on Harry. “Harry, if you can continue, please.”

“I guess we crossed in Mexico, because the next time I felt awake was when Bucky carried me in a motel.”

Tony had to fight to keep his visible composure while Harry described laying in a bed, covered in sweat and blood, and began hallucinating his friends. When Harry described how his leg looked, even Quahog looked a little sickened.

“I know I sound bloody mad, but- but I think I thought I was going to die and I didn’t want it to be alone,” Harry said. Tony didn’t say anything when Harry’s hand snuck over and seemed to be desperately squeezing Tony’s knee.

“When I fought Voldemort before, I thought I was going to die, and my parents were there,” Harry said. Sirius’ face spasmed and Tony wondered which of the three of them were in the worst pain.

Harry, probably.

Tony would shoulder it all if he could.

“I just wanted my dad,” Harry said softly. “I kept thinking he needed to hurry or I wouldn’t be able to say bye or thanks or anything.”

Tony breathed very slowly out his mouth while he blinked up at the ceiling.

That hurt.

“What happened next?” Al Saud asked, not unkindly, but briskly.

“And then I think Strange arrived—”

The prosecutor cleared her throat and smiled at Harry.

“Try and keep your information contained to what you know for sure,” she said. “Only what you absolutely remember, felt, or heard, okay? We’ll get testimony from others for any gaps.”

“I felt like shit,” Harry said bluntly. “Someone picked me up and I remember it hurt so bloody bad that I was wishing I’d pass out. And then the heat was gone and it was cold and noisy. People were shouting and then someone cut my chest open.”

“Excuse me?” Barnes’ lawyer gaped at Harry. “Someone cut you?”

“They had to insert a chest tube,” Tony explained. “Harry’s lungs had collapsed and Doctor Strange inserted a chest tube to keep him breathing.”

“Good Lord, why didn’t he just repair the lung with magic?”

Sirius had a slight smirk when he answered since Tony truthfully had no idea.

“Stephen was a muggle doctor for years, he’s a bloody brilliant one, and he said there are more medical advances for muggles than we have.”

Tony didn’t miss the way Sirius said Stephen’s name; it was the same way he said Pepper’s. Tony had assumed that Stephen was another casual lover of Sirius’, but maybe he misjudged the situation.

“That’s barbaric.” Barnes’ lawyer actually shuddered before she nodded at Harry. “I apologize, please, continue.”

“Next thing I remember is hearing my dad and Sirius screaming,” Harry said.

For as long as he lived, Tony would never forget seeing his son that day.

Harry had looked pathetically tiny on a stretcher in the emergency room of a hospital. There was a tube coming out of his chest and his leg had been black clear up to his waist.

And Tony thought he was going to lose him.

Tony had looked at his kid and only seen a corpse and a lightweight coffin.

There were a lot of nights that Tony closed his eyes and relieved that moment over and over again.

“Mister Stark.”

Tony blinked once he realized someone was speaking to him in the present. The prosecutor waited patiently for Tony to shake off the ghost terror from that day and focus on her.

“Yes?” he said.

“Harry heard you and Doctor Strange arguing, can you tell us what the argument was about?”

Tony tried to remember what they argued about that day…

“Harry’s leg,” Tony said slowly. “Strange wanted to amputate. The tissue was necrotic and if it got to Harry’s bloodstream then he- he would have died,” he finished hoarsely. “I wanted Harry to keep his leg and Strange wanted Harry to live.”

All Tony thought was how hard Harry’s life would be if they amputated. Strange had all the best medical training and Tony wasted time debating over a leg.

Harry squeezed Tony’s leg and tilted his head over until it touched Tony’s shoulder just for a second.

“You were in an impossible position,” Sirius told Tony. His eyes were cloudy with the memories they started of that day but he still worked to smile at Tony. “I was the one who wanted to waste time going to fetch Albus.”

“The only person to blame here is Barnes,” Al Saud said. He really was worth every cent that Tony paid him. It seemed as if every time he opened his mouth he found a new way to blame something on Barnes.

“That’s all I remember anyway,” Harry said with a heavy sigh. “I woke up in a hospital bed with my leg missing and my dad crying.”

Tony wasn’t one of those macho guys who were so insecure in their manhood that they couldn’t admit to having emotions, but his son didn’t have to make it a public record either.

“And how has your quality of life changed since then?” Al Saud asked Harry. “I see you’re walking now, was it a difficult process to get to where you are now?”

“You could say that,” Harry said. “I’m not even allowed to walk more than four hours a day for a month.”

That was because Harry bruised the hell out of his leg and exhausted himself on the first day he had his prosthetic. It had been Tony’s fault, he forgot how stubborn Harry could be. While Tony had been taking soldier Sky Greene to get checked in a mental health facility and had his family on a flight out to New York, Harry had been pushing himself past his limits on the leg.

And now Tony had a timer on his phone that was tuned to the tracker in Harry’s leg. Every time the tracker registered Harry taking steps, the timer counted down. Once it hit zero, Harry had to take the leg off.

Harry wasn’t a fan of the timer, but it was the only compromise they could reach while Harry’s muscles regained strength.

“I see.” The prosecutor made a note on her paper and then looked up at Harry again. “And emotionally? How have things been since this incident? Nightmares? Flashbacks? Anything you want to tell us can help.”

Harry scowled just as Tony expected him to do at the question.

“I’m not winning any bloody races, but my feelings are fine,” he said shortly.

“He was practically comatose for a week and then relied heavily on Dreamless Sleep and pain potions for months,” Sirius said. Tony was relieved that Sirius called Harry out on the bold lie- it meant Tony didn’t have to.

Harry actually scooted closer to Tony and shot Sirius a filthy look of betrayal that Tony was sure Sirius would hear all about when they weren’t surrounded by others.

“Okay then.” The prosecutor made a final note on her page before looking around at the others. Nobody said anything and she smiled again at Harry. “I think we have what we need, thank you, Harry.”

The prosecutor pulled a light brown wand from her pocket and with a flick she had all her documents packed up neatly and the folder in her hand.

“The trial will begin on February first,” she said.

“At which time Mister Barnes will be entering a plea of not guilty due to mental impairment,” Barnes’ lawyer said.

Al Saud smirked at her with obvious amusement.

“That will be quite the difficult sell considering he went on to kill Voldemort and multiple Death Eaters without so much as a scratch on himself,” he said smoothly.

Barnes’ lawyer raised her chin and narrowed her eyes.

“Will it? Because St. Mungo’s has a much different opinion. I will see you all there.”

Tony waited until Barnes’ lawyer left to appraise Harry’s lawyer.

“Will Harry have to testify?” he asked bluntly.

“Unless Barnes accepts a plea deal, yes,” the prosecutor answered him. “Harry, Doctor Stephen Strange, and Sirius Black are our best witnesses.”

“Me?” Sirius seemed surprised. “Why?”

“Did you not assist in Harry’s surgery and the search before then?”

Sirius glanced down at Harry who was still sitting with his head dropped some.

“Yeah, alright.” Sirius sighed and shook the hand of the prosecutor. “I suppose I’ll get my dress robes ready.”

“I hate to brag, but I make a great witness,” Tony said. “Lawyers love me. Will I be called?”

“You will not,” Quahog answered him. “Unfortunately, you are a no-maj and cannot testify in trials regarding magical matters.”

“Yeah, that seems fair,” Tony said. “I mean Harry’s my kid, but so what?”

“I understand your frustration, but we have garnered a waiver to allow you and Miss Potts to attend the trial.”

“Which is a first for us,” the prosecutor was quick to add.

Al Saud clapped his hands together and smiled at Harry. “Harry, do you have any more questions?”

“Everything I just told you, I have to say it again?” Harry asked his lawyer. The kid looked miserable and Tony hated it.

“It is very likely, yes,” Al Saud said.

“In front of more people?”

“The courtroom will be closed during your testimony, but the judge will be there, a jury of thirteen witches and wizards, and Mister Barnes.”

Harry sighed and grasped the edge of the table to pull himself to his feet.

“Brilliant,” he said flatly.

Tony glanced at the prosecutor. “What kind of plea will you be offering Barnes?”

“It depends entirely on the report from St. Mungo’s,” she said. “As soon as my co-counsel and I review the medical reports and speak with Doctor Strange then we will confer on what we are willing to offer.”

“If you can make him take the plea, do it,” Tony told her. Tony would rather they lighten Barnes’ sentence by a few years than make Harry testify again.

“I will do my best.” The prosecutor offered her hand to Tony, Sirius, Rhodey, and Harry before taking her leave.

“I’ll call you once they have a plea offer,” Al Saud told Tony. “It should be in the next few days.”

“Thanks.” Tony shook his hand as well before giving Harry a bracing smile. “You ready, kid?”

“So much,” Harry said.

Sirius stuck around to talk with Quahog for a few minutes while Tony, Harry, and Rhodey made a quick escape.

“The world is your oyster today, kid,” Tony told Harry as soon as they were outside. “Whatever you want to do.”

“Is this a pity offer?” Harry asked with Tony’s own skeptical expression.

“It is,” Tony grinned, unrepentant. “So what are we doing?”

Harry debated for a moment before Tony finally saw the return of a little spark of life in his eyes.

“Do you know how to play paintball?”

Tony loved to play paintball.

“We have…” Tony checked the timer on his phone. “Two hours and fifteen minutes before you’re a crip again. Let’s go run the clock down in an arena.”

 

Harry was a little down the rest of the day, but he was still quick to team up with Tony against Sirius and Rhodey at the paintball arena.

And when Harry shot his godfather with a paintball and let out a delighted laugh, Tony laughed for the first time all day as well.

Chapter Text

Saturday, January 20

“I’LL JUST TAKE MY VAULT TO THE STATES THEN!” Sirius shouted at the huge marble doors of the bank he was just physically thrown from. “WHAT WILL YOU DO THEN? HUH?!”

A passerby stopped to gawk at Sirius and he bared his teeth and snarled at them.

“Keep bloody walking!” Sirius shouted.

Sirius Black was not having a good day.

He started his day with a row with Stephen—

“I need you to trust me. It isn’t time yet.”

“I need my godson to live! Tell me how we’re getting the horcrux from his head!”

“‘We’ aren’t doing anything, Sirius. I will remove it when it’s time.”

Bloody arrogant bastard.

After their row, Sirius left for England.

If Stephen wouldn’t get the damn thing out of Harry, then Sirius would find someone who would. He started with the goblins. Sirius thought they might know of anything - a ritual, a spell, even a curse - that could remove the horcrux. And for the right price, Sirius hoped they’d share it with him.

Instead, the hateful little gits got offended as hell when Sirius said what he was after. They acted like it was an insult that Sirius would come to them for ‘nasty, immoral, magic’.

It was a compliment.

But since they probably didn’t know anything (Sirius was sure they’d be all for taking the Black vaults in exchange for information), it meant Sirius had to swap to plan b.

Moody.

Sirius brushed himself off before he turned on the spot and disappeared for Hogsmeade.

 

When Sirius had briefly trained to be a Hit Wizard - before the first war, before James went in hiding - he did it under the vigilant eye of Alastor Moody. Sirius had liked the man, as much as he could like someone that hexed his students when they weren’t paying attention, but that was before Moody let Sirius get locked up without ever saying a single word in his defense.

Still though, if anyone knew anything about horcruxes, aside from Albus, it might be Moody.

And Sirius rather desperately hoped Moody knew something. Sirius couldn’t ask Albus, he wouldn’t risk it.

If Albus knew Harry was the last horcrux, well… Sirius wasn’t confident that he wouldn’t kill him to end Voldemort permanently. It was a cold thought to have, but Sirius couldn’t trust Harry’s life in Albus’ hands.

Sirius wouldn’t trust Harry’s life in anyone else’s hands ever again.

Besides Tony, obviously.

 

Sirius sent a patronus up to the castle after arriving in Hogsmeade. He sent his little three-legged Padfoot up to find Moody and ask him to meet him at Rosmerta’s place. The Hogs Head would be more private, but it also carried the risk of Albus’ brother that owned the pub overhearing his conversation.

The Three Broomstick’s was packed, Sirius didn’t realize it was a Hogsmeade weekend for the students, and Sirius barely sat down with a drink before he was approached by Molly’s twins.

“Sirius! Old buddy, old pal!” One of the twins slapped Sirius on the shoulder and grinned at him while the other stood on Sirius’ opposite side.

“I don’t reckon we can ask our favorite Marauder for a favor, can we?”

Sirius took a sip of his drink and looked between the identical shit-eating grins cautiously. Sirius liked the twins enough, but they were conniving little shits. They were sneaky in a way that Sirius never could have pulled off at their age. Truthfully, they made a good argument for Slytherin.

“You can ask,” Sirius said casually.

“Brilliant.” The twins sat on either side of Sirius and one of them pulled out a parchment and quill from his pocket.

“What do you know about the shopping district in the States?”

“I know it’s got a bloody lot more than Diagon,” Sirius snorted. He squinted suspiciously at the twin with the quill. “I thought you boys bought a place in London?”

Sirius was certain of it since he’d invested in their joke shop. As conniving as the twins were, they were also a bit brilliant. They had products stocked, plans made, and a hefty investment from Harry that Sirius matched.

“Oh we did,” one of them said. “But we’re thinking three steps ahead, you see? So if we hit our profit goal between opening day in June and the end of the quarter, we’re thinking expansion.”

“I wanted to open a shop here in Hogsmeade for the students, but Freddie decided he likes New York.” George, apparently, sighed at his brother. “So we need to know everything about pre-existing joke shops in Landfara Way and the average cost to buy a business there.”

Since Sirius rather liked the idea of the twins expanding to the States, he told them everything he knew. And he even agreed to do some digging for them to find out about any competition and legalities involved in opening a shop in the States.

By the time Sirius was tucking a parchment of information he promised to get in his pocket, a familiar clunking noise registered behind him.

“Professor Moody!” Fred quickly swept away all his plans and turned to beam at Moody. “Charming to see you!”

“Positively delightful!” George cried.

“You’re looking dashing!”

“Is that a new scar on your cheek? It really brings out your eye.”

“Scram before I remember that you two were supposed to be in detention with Severus today,” Moody growled. The twins were quick to dart away with final winks for Sirius and Moody took up Fred’s seat on Sirius’ right-hand side.

“Interesting patronus you’ve got,” Moody muttered. He waved a hand at Rosmerta when she looked as if she would come check on them and watched Sirius from the corner of his magical eye. “I guess the rumors about Potter are true?”

“I’m sure Albus filled you in already,” Sirius said drily. Moody and Albus were two heads of the same snake. Sirius just trusted Moody a millimeter more than he did Albus.

Moody took a swig from his flask and turned a lopsided grin toward Sirius.

“I don’t believe anything I don’t see for myself,” he grunted. “Tell Potter to get a wooden leg. He’ll get the hang of it eventually.”

“I’ll do that,” Sirius lied. He looked around at the rest of the patrons at the bar and leaned his head closer to Moody when it seemed as if nobody was paying them any mind. “How’s your occlumency?” he murmured.

Moody didn’t so much as raise a brow at Sirius’ question. He kept his eyes, both of them, aimed straight ahead and spoke subtly from the corner of his mouth.

“Impenetrable,” he muttered. “Can’t get too relaxed when I live with scum like Snape.”

Sirius grinned a little. That was the other reason Sirius trusted Moody just a bit- Moody didn’t believe in second chances like Albus did. Moody would never trust Snivellus with that nasty tattoo on his arm and it raised Moody in Sirius’ estimation.

Enemy of my enemy, and all that.

“Excellent.” Sirius lifted his mug to his lips to mask them from anyone watching and pretend to take a drink while he whispered to Moody. “You know anything about horcruxes?”

If Moody was shocked at Sirius’ question, he didn’t show it.

“I think they’re a handy way to live forever if you don’t mind being batshit crazy.”

That was another thing Sirius liked about Moody. For one of the greatest aurors in magical history, Moody didn’t give a damn about right or wrong, not really.

Sirius reckoned that if Moody hadn’t had a squib daughter that died young, he might have joined Voldemort and they’d have been royally screwed.

Moody could take over the world if he wanted, nobody could stop him.

“You ever heard of a human horcrux?” Sirius asked quiet as he could.

Moody laughed then and clapped Sirius on the shoulder hard.

“Laugh now in case anyone’s watching,” Moody said, paranoid bastard. Sirius did though, forcing out a cheery laugh as if the two of them were sharing a joke.

“By human horcrux, you mean a person with someone else’s soul in them?” Moody asked once he seemed sure they weren’t being spied on. His magical eye was spinning around quickly, lingering here and there on people he must have found suspicious.

“Mhmm,” Sirius hummed.

Moody went quiet and when Sirius glanced at him, he could see wheels turning in his real eye. It wouldn’t be a stretch for him to guess at Sirius’ predicament, but Sirius wasn’t keen to confirm it either.

All at once, Moody’s face crumbled and he put a hand on Sirius’ shoulder for a moment.

“It’s one or the other, Black. Potter dies or Voldemort lives.” Moody seemed genuinely sorrowful when he said it. “Don’t ever talk about this again. The walls have ears and there’s a lot of people that would say Potter’s life isn’t worth much.”

Sirius felt his chest aching at Moody’s genuine words. Moody was as close to dark as anyone on the right side could be, if he didn’t know how to save Harry, then Sirius didn’t know that the option existed.

“What would you do?” Sirius asked Moody. He stared hard in the eyes of the man that had once been his mentor and once his captor. “If you were me, what would you do?”

“I’d tell Potter to take an extended vacation as far from this world as he could,” Moody said without hesitation. “Change his appearance, his name, just get the hell out and don’t ever look back.”

Moody took another long draw from his flask before he stood up and put his mouth right beside Sirius’ ear.

“And then I’d kill anyone who might suspect anything,” Moody breathed.

Sirius swiveled on his seat and watched Moody clank his way out the door and pondered that piece of advice.

It seemed as if Moody thought precisely what Sirius did… Albus would kill Harry to stop Voldemort. One life for a future hypothetical thousands.

Mathematically, it made sense.

But that one life was worth the entire damn world to Sirius. And Sirius would burn the world for that one life, keeping the horcrux in his head a secret was nothing in comparison.

 

And maybe Stephen would get off his lazy arse soon and actually do something about it.

 

Sirius spent another hour in Rosmerta’s pub, having a couple drinks. Everything was crap.

Harry was going through a crap time.

Tony was having a crap time.

And Sirius was sure as hell having a crap time.

All the little good things, like Harry walking again and talking about being in love, were tainted in Sirius’ mind with thoughts that Harry would die young or be hunted by Voldemort if he got a body again.

Sirius wasn’t sleeping. Every time he closed his eyes, he thought of Harry being hit by the killing curse or having a poisoned knife drove through his forehead.

Everything was crap.

 

Sirius was working on his fourth glass when a familiar quiet sizzle broke through the soft buzz of conversation happening. The pub went quiet, of course, and Sirius didn’t even bother to turn around.

“Leave me alone,” he muttered down at his drink.

Stephen scoffed and took the empty seat on Sirius’ left side. He didn’t seem to mind being the center of attention from the wide-eyed patrons who had never seen portals before. In fact, Sirius was sure he liked it.

Arrogant prick.

“Come home,” Stephen said, a bit bossily in a way that made Sirius want to refuse on principal. “You’re being unreasonable.”

“Unreasonable?” Sirius repeated hotly. He turned his head to scowl at Stephen with everything he had in him. “So sorry that you’ve given my favorite person in the world a death sentence. Let me just hop up and throw a parade, yeah?”

Stephen rolled his eyes up and Sirius ignored the way that arguing with Stephen usually led to the best sex of his life. He wasn’t going to get distracted, not when Stephen was playing fast and loose with Harry’s life.

“If you would just trust me, you stubborn wizard, then you wouldn’t be here prematurely mourning someone who I have no intention on letting die,” Stephen drawled. “Do you really think I would work so hard to train him if he was destined for a tiny coffin?”

Sirius felt sick when Stephen said it like that. All nonchalant, ‘destined for a tiny coffin’. It was irrational, and probably more a side-effect of the whiskey, but Sirius turned and swung a fist toward Stephen.

Someone shrieked, but Stephen caught Sirius’ fist in his hand just before he opened a portal beneath them and yanked them both through it.

“YOU BLOODY PRAT!” Sirius howled when he landed on a hard floor. He jumped up and lunged toward Stephen again only to be dodged and hit his own sofa instead.

“Sweetheart, save the domestic violence for the bedroom,” Stephen said with a cocky lilt that only made Sirius more angry. He leaned against the dining table and smirked at Sirius.

“YOU CANNOT PORTAL PEOPLE AGAINST THEIR WILL!” Sirius yelled. He balled his hands in fists at his sides and glared at Stephen. “I DIDN’T EVEN PAY MY TAB!”

Stephen laughed and Sirius wasn’t sure if he wanted to tie him to his bed and edge him until he cried or just kick his arse.

They were equal and familiar desires when he was with Stephen.

No one could piss Sirius off quicker and no one else could make Sirius feel fifteen years younger and drunk on love again.

Stephen pulled a large note from his wallet and held it up for Sirius to see before theatrically sending it through a portal.

“Ta da,” he said. “Your tab has been paid plus a very nice tip.”

“I hate you,” Sirius snapped.

Stephen’s smirk only grew. “You love me,” he said confidently. “Now quit being a pain in the ass and go out with me tonight. I’m thinking you’ll like this opera and even if you don’t, you’ll definitely like our private seats.”

Sirius was the one who rolled his eyes then just before he quickly snatched a pillow off the sofa and threw it at Stephen’s face.

“I’ve got things to do,” Sirius said evasively. He curled his lip up at Stephen in a slightly unfair sneer. “Someone I actually respect told me to get Harry as far as I can and that’s what I’m going to do.”

After he told Tony why he needed to take Harry to a new country with a new identity and leave their lives behind. Tony would do it, he’d do it without hesitation.

Nobody wanted Harry to live a long life more than Sirius and Tony did.

“First off- ouch.” Stephen put a hand on his chest and feigned a hurt expression. “You don’t respect me? Is that why you let me blindfold you last night? So you didn’t have to look at me?”

Sirius was not going to blush like a first year and he was not going to let Stephen distract him.

“Secondly,” Stephen’s face became serious while Sirius fought down the blush on his own, “do not go telling Stark about the horcrux. You’re going to panic him, he’ll take Harry and flee, and it’ll severely mess up my timeline.”

“TELL ME WHAT YOUR PLAN IS THEN!” Sirius shouted for the eightieth time since he discovered the horcrux. “Please, Stephen,” Sirius’ voice cracked and his knees shook with his desperation. “Please, I can’t sleep. I can’t even look at Harry, I just keep- I see him in Godric’s Hollow with James and Lily… I…” Sirius felt a few hot tears spill and wiped them from his cheeks with the back of his hand. “Please tell me.”

Stephen’s face softened and he crossed the room to Sirius in three long strides. When he put his hands on Sirius’ waist and pulled him closer, Sirius let him.

“Tell me,” Sirius cried in Stephen’s shoulder. “Please. Please. I can’t lose him.”

It wasn’t a selfish thought. It was a fact.

Sirius couldn’t lose Harry. Harry was the single most important person in Sirius’ life. More than that, Harry couldn’t lose the brilliant life that Sirius had worked so hard to ensure for him.

It wasn’t without some damn terrible moments, but Sirius made sure Harry had a family that loved him and a future filled with possibilities.

Sirius removed Harry from the war.

Sirius finally got to be the godfather he’d always wanted to be.

And none of it would matter if Harry’s life was at risk with a horcrux in his head.

Stephen reached up for Sirius’ face and cupped it gently so he could pull Sirius out of his neck and look him in the eyes.

“Give me twenty-four days,” Stephen said softly. He leaned in and pressed a light kiss to Sirius’ wet lips. “Twenty-four days and I will tell you everything.”

“Why can’t you tell me now?” Sirius pleaded. “I need to know now.”

“Because in sixteen seconds an alarm is going to go off and you’re going to go on a little mission with your friends,” Stephen said. His eyes warmed some and it was that look that Sirius craved, the one that said he could trust Stephen as much as he trusted anyone.

Stephen was arrogant, he was a prat on occasion. But Sirius didn’t truly think he would let Harry die… he hoped. Stephen said he and Sirius were inevitable, and Sirius would never be with someone who let his godson die.

Sirius counted to sixteen in his head while he and Stephen stared at each other and then Sirius’ flat was filled with a high pitched alarm.

“Twenty-four days?” Sirius asked Stephen over the sound of the Avengers alarm.

“I solemnly swear,” Stephen said with a glimmer of amusement returning to his eyes. “Go on, your pals are waiting your oh so legitimate leadership.”

“It is legitimate,” Sirius said. He tried to pull off an arrogant drawl like Stephen was so talented at, but he was a bit snotty from his crying fit.

Sirius summoned a pepper-up potion to wash away any lingering drunkenness, his broomstick, and a medical bag. He shrunk it all down and stuffed it in his pocket before he grabbed Stephen by the collar of his black shirt and pulled him in for a quick and heated kiss.

“Will I be back in time to discover the joys of opera?” Sirius asked. He doubted if he’d like it, but he did agree to go with Stephen since Stephen took him to a rock concert in Florida the week before.

Stephen sighed heavily and shook his head.

“You will, but you’ll be busy,” he said. “Fine. I’ll take Wong tonight.”

“No shagging him or I’ll kill you both,” Sirius said brightly. He kissed Stephen once more before he prepared to apparate to the launch pad.

“No promises,” Stephen said with an amused grin. “You know how Wong loves to seduce me with his dirty talk.”

Sirius barked out a quick laugh at what had better be a jest before he turned on the spot and disappeared to go lead his team on a mission.

Chapter Text

Sunday, January 21

Harry was flying through the skies on his broomstick, looking down at his friends and family.

Tony was throwing a stick for Padfoot to catch while a little girl with strawberry blonde hair and hazel eyes laughed and chased Padfoot.

Pepper relaxed on a chair with a baby on her lap, one that looked a little like Harry with dark hair but with Pepper’s teal eyes.

Peter was making Ron shriek like a girl when he kept shooting webs at him, something Hermione and Gwen found hysterical.

There were others there too- Flash and Pietro were racing. Clint and Psycho were wrestling while the twins cheered them on. Even Ginny and Luna were there while they kept poking Bruce with sticks, trying to get him to transform in the Hulk.

It would be perfect if Harry could just navigate his broom to the ground so he could join them. But no matter how much pressure Harry put on the handle, it wouldn’t go to the ground.

“Fly down, you bloody broom!” Harry growled.

“Have you tried asking nicely?”

Harry’s head whipped to the side and he was suddenly faced with a man flying on a broomstick beside him. Even in his dreams, Harry had never seen him before. The man was tall and elegant with slicked back black hair and green eyes that were so bright it made Harry think of the spell he saw when his mum was murdered.

“Hello,” the man said. He had his hands behind his head and wasn’t even holding on to his broomstick. “You are quite interesting, aren’t you?”

“Am I?” Harry asked.

“I find you incredibly interesting,” the man said. “I saw you in the mind of your godfather and knew we had to meet.”

Harry furrowed his brows down, puzzled at that. Harry had a lot of odd dreams, even odder nightmares, but it was still starting to become one of his weirdest ones yet.

“Sirius does Occlumency,” Harry pointed out to the man. Harry knew logic didn’t work in dreams, but he still felt compelled to say it. “There’s no way you got in his mind, he’s brilliant.”

The man threw his head back and laughed, displaying a set of perfectly white and even teeth.

“The mind blocks of wizards is no match for the power of a God,” the man said.

Harry felt a little thrill of fear at that, but the man soothed it away before Harry could even voice it.

“Your godfather is fine, Little One. He’s under the impression that he defeated me and sent me back to Asgard.”

“Asgard?” Harry asked. “Isn’t that where Thor lives?”

“Unfortunately,” the man agreed drily. “Enough about me, I want to talk about you. I did come quite a way to find you.”

Harry didn’t even blink and suddenly the clear skies he had been in swirled around and Harry was surrounded by darkness until he was in a room that he only saw in his memories.

There was baby Harry in a crib, crying for the woman dead on the floor.

Harry couldn’t breathe when he saw his mum laying there, dead, while the baby cried in its crib.

“You were marked for death as an infant and yet here you are,” the man mused. He walked over to the crib and conjured a pacifier from thin air to offer to the baby.

Harry pinched his arm and tried to wake himself up, but all he managed was to make the scene change again.

It was cramped in the cupboard and Harry couldn’t stand up straight. He crouched down and felt his lungs being squeezed by the lack of air in the room.

The man was still there, peering at Harry through the dark with his glowing eyes.

“You were locked away, treated like a burden for the tragic crime of being special,” the man whispered. “They were ashamed of you. They made you ashamed of yourself.”

“I want out,” Harry said plaintively. He smacked his hand on the cupboard door and caused a cloud of dust to fly up in his face. “I WANT OUT!”

Harry smacked the door again and it disappeared, causing him to fall forward and hit the floor. When Harry sat up, he saw he was on the platform for the Hogwarts Express.

And so was eleven year old Harry with his messy hair, owl in a cage, and his wide-eyed look of excitement as he took in all the magic around him.

“Did you finally feel as if you fit in somewhere?” The man sat crossed-legged beside Harry in the middle of the platform. “When you were here, Little One, did you finally feel accepted?”

It was a dream, only a dream, so Harry could be honest.

“No,” he said, miserable at the truth in his own words. “They- they wanted a hero. They wanted someone special and I just wanted to be Harry.”

“A legacy placed on your head and all you wished for was to be a child.” The man hummed. “Tragic.”

The air whipped through Harry’s hair and the platform around him blurred until it resettled and Harry was twelve, in the Chamber of Secrets, fighting a basilisk.

Harry struggled to get to his feet - even in his dreams he was clumsy with his prosthetic leg - while he watched Harry running for his life with nothing more than a sword in hand.

“RUN!” Harry screamed to himself. “RUN!”

“You slayed a beast as a child that most grown warriors refuse to face.” The man sounded amused, but Harry was busy watching himself sliding against walls, hiding from the basilisk that would eventually get its fang in Harry’s arm.

Harry screamed in tangent with his younger self when the basilisk fang eventually pierced Harry’s arm at the same time Harry drove the sword through the roof of its mouth.

“I would have given anything to have a pet basilisk,” the man said. He smirked when Harry looked at him. “Not all serpents are evil, Little One. Eve took the apple, but the snake got the bad reputation.” The man clicked his tongue and then their surroundings changed again.

“You have a heart made for mischief.” The man and Harry watched as Harry threw mud at Draco Malfoy from beneath his cloak outside the Shrieking Shack. Despite himself, Harry did snicker when Malfoy began whining about ghosts.

“Oh.” Harry grimaced when the next scene he saw was the fight against the Horntail.

“Yet another beast of legends that you evaded,” the man said. He looked at Harry appraisingly. “What were you thinking when you used a wooden broomstick against a fire breathing beast?”

Harry blinked at him. “Er… not catching on fire, mostly.”

The man laughed, a huffy and sarcastic noise, and Harry knew what was coming next as much as he didn’t want to see it.

“Please don’t,” Harry said when the sky darkened and the air became thick with the smell of wet earth and blood. Harry closed his eyes- he saw the graveyard enough when he was the one being tied to the tombstone, he didn’t want to watch from an outside perspective.

“Don’t marvel over the sheer strength of a mere child who stood against a tyrant and refused to bow? Fine.”

Harry didn’t open his eyes until he felt the air around him changing, hopefully to something better. It was better, if an odd moment to choose.

Harry had a bruise on his face, a backpack over his shoulders, and walked without notice through a crowd of people in an airport. Sirius had bought him a ticket, but he also placed a Notice-Me-Not Charm and Muggle Repellent Charm on Harry to get him through customs and on the flight for New York.

“You left behind everything to find your blood kinship,” the man said quietly. “Why?”

Harry swallowed hard and shrugged his shoulders.

“For Sirius,” he said truthfully. “And… and I think a little for me.”

Harry could have run away on the first night at the tower, he could have left when Tony didn’t get him the documents he asked for. But he didn’t.

“I see.” The man raised a brow and kept his eyes locked on Harry while the background shifted and swirled until they were on top of a building, looking out at the New York skyline.

Harry’s knees shook from the force of the wind while he squinted through the dark to see himself sitting on the edge of the building, leaning forward and laughing.

It was a joyful laugh that was wildly out of place when Harry knew what was going to happen.

Harry let out a strangled scream and hit the ground hard on his knees when he had to see himself flipping forward and free-falling off the side of the building.

“Stop,” Harry said hoarsely. The scenery was changing again and Harry wanted to clench his eyes shut to avoid whatever the man wanted to see next. “Please. Please, stop.”

“These are your memories, your legacy,” the man said. “Why would you avoid it? These are your choices, Little One.”

Harry’s eyes teared up and he grabbed his left hand when phantom pains stabbed his hand while he watched himself writing lines in Umbridge’s office.

“What a vile woman,” the man commented lightly. “You should have let your godfather kill her. It’s the duty of a godparent to protect you.”

“I had to protect him,” Harry said quietly. His hand was on fire and he had no idea how he managed to sit there for so many hours, just carving his hand with that quill.

“Sirius is the godfather,” the man stressed. “He is named after Seirios, the brightest star in the sky for the strongest warrior known to the Greeks. Why would you think you could protect him?”

Despite the pain in Harry’s hand and the tears in his eyes, he smiled a little.

“Sirius is too reckless,” Harry explained. “He’s too quick to act. It’s not his fault, it’s just because Sirius loves me more than he loves his freedom.”

“Aah. But does he love you enough to be honest with you?” asked the man. “Is love a good reason to lie?”

That felt like a riddle, one like the Sphinx asked Harry in the maze.

“I don’t know,” Harry said slowly. “I guess it depends on what they’re lying about?”

The man looked too amused by Harry’s answer and it made Harry feel nervous. He had to remind himself that it was only a dream- if an incredibly strange one. He smirked at Harry and then twitched his fingers and everything changed again.

Harry stood beside the man in a hotel room so hot that Harry’s shirt clung to his back. It smelled horrible, like infection and death. And there laid Harry on the bed with his eyes closed and his lips moving as he talked to his hallucinations.

“Was it all worth it, Little One?” The man stared down at Harry with intensity while Harry’s heart raced with the familiar feeling of being so close to death and so helpless to prevent it.

“You’ve faced terrors that would send warriors running for their mothers and yet you never attempted to take your life until after you found your father. You maintained all your limbs through battles with beasts. You lived fourteen years with relatives that despised you without permanent injury. It wasn’t until you sought out a parent that you became so damaged.

“Was it worth it, Little One?”

Harry didn’t know how he did it, but Harry took control of the scenery then.

Harry showed the man the day he played catch with Tony and accidentally broke his telly without Tony beating or berating him. Harry showed him the day he adopted Joey, with Pepper smiling behind the camera and Peter beside Harry.

Harry brought up Sirius being freed. Sirius laughing and singing in his flat while he made objects fly around just to pester Harry. Harry showed the man Gwen’s party and the friends Harry made there that he still had.

For every moment the man had of terrible things in Harry’s life before Tony, Harry was able to find twice as many moments - maybe not so large, but still relevant - of times where Harry laughed without notice and smiled freely.

The last memory Harry brought up was from just a few days ago. Tony drove Harry and Pepper out of the city, claiming he had a surprise for them. Harry talked him into bringing Joey with them and he smuggled Tri-Paw’d in his hoodie pocket.

When they arrived at their destination, it had been a big empty lot. It was a pretty piece of property; huge with green grass and tall trees around the edge while a lake sparkled in the background.

“This is where we’re going to put our home,” Dad said. He put one arm around Harry’s shoulders while his other hand held Pepper’s and the three of them stood there for a moment, taking it all in.

“This is a good place for our family,” Pepper said softly. She looked at Tony with a loving smile before leaning forward to give Harry the same look. “I love you both.”

Harry and the man watched the scene and Harry cleared his throat.

“Yeah, it was worth it,” Harry told him.

 

Harry opened his eyes with a quiet gasp. Automatically, he tried to kick his blanket off him and felt a familiar shock of surprise that his left leg wasn’t there to kick.

That shock was nothing compared to when Harry sat up and saw a pair of bright green eyes peering at him from the foot of his bed.

“Hello, Little One.”

Harry opened his mouth and screamed at the top of his lungs.

Chapter Text

Sunday, January 21

Tony was having the sexiest dream of his life—

Pepper, in a whipped cream bikini, lounging on a plush red rug.

Pepper’s surprise identical twin sister, grinding coffee beans by hand, completely naked.

Even better, Pepper’s surprise triplet was on her knees in front of Tony, filth pouring from her pink lips.

“You’re so smart,” she breathed up at him. Her hair was rumpled in a ‘I just had the best sex of my life and I need more’ kind of way and Tony just wanted to grab it.

“I can’t believe how smart you are,” she said. “And your body? Oooh, Tony. The things you can do with your co—”

Pepper’s triplet’s dirty talk was cut off by a scream.

Not a good ‘you’re rocking my world’ kind of scream, but a ‘my world is ending’ kind of scream.

Tony bolted upright when the scream continued and shattered his dream. Pepper was beside Tony, frowning and clenching her eyes, which meant the scream that Tony could hear echoing in his ears was from…

“Shit. Harry.”

Tony was out of bed in an instant and he had his gauntlet summoned with a tap of his arc reactor. It didn’t even register to him that he was dressed in just his boxers, he just knew Harry needed help.

Maybe it was a nightmare.

Maybe it was some sort of flashback.

Maybe it was—

“What the hell?” Tony burst in Harry’s room and found his kid huddled against his headboard and Reindeer Games of all people at the foot of Harry’s bed.

Tony aimed the gauntlet at him, carefully, and the God quickly snatched up the kitten off the bed and held it in front of his face.

“You wouldn’t kill your grand-kitten, would you, Stark?”

“Oi! No!” Harry lunged across the bed then and Tony hastily aimed the charged gauntlet up toward the ceiling when the kid started fighting Loki for the kitten.

Tony knew that ratty little kitten would be a pain in the ass the moment he found it.

“Hey, HEY!” Tony had to yell and went to grab Harry to keep him from getting eaten or mind-zapped or something completely insane. Harry grabbed Tri-Paw’d and rolled out of Tony’s grasp and away from Loki.

Pepper burst in the room with Tony’s 9mm aimed at Loki even while her eyes flicked toward Harry, checking he was okay.

If Tony wasn’t already head over heels for her, and she wasn’t already wearing his ring, he would have hit his knees and proposed right then.

Was there anything sexier than a woman in a lace nightgown, holding a Glock, and being all maternal at the same time?

“What the hell is going on?” Pepper demanded. She pulled back the hammer on the gun and kept it trained on Loki’s forehead even when he stood up with his palms held out.

“I woke up and he was in my bed!” Harry said accusingly.

“HE IS FIFTEEN!” Pepper screamed.

“I was doing nothing untoward!” Loki said quickly. Apparently even Gods of Mischief cringed beneath the glare of Pepper Potts.

“You were in my dreams!” Harry argued as he clutched the damn three-legged kitten to his chest.

“You were what?!” Tony snapped. He was actually less worried about his son being molested by Loki than he was having Harry’s head jacked up and hijacked.

“I came to visit my descendant,” Loki said, as if he were harmless. As if he weren’t hellbent on taking over the world and forcing all of mankind to worship him.

As if he hadn’t just been inside Harry’s mind.

“Wait!” Tony’s hand dropped a centimeter when he actually worked through what Loki just said. “Did you say descendant? As in…?”

“Great-great-great-so on and so forth-grandson seventy-nine times removed,” Loki said airily. He turned a dazzling smile toward Harry who only blinked at him with his mouth opened in a little ‘o’.

“Well? Aren’t you going to greet your grandfather?”

 

“You shot me,” Loki hissed venomously for the tenth time.

Pepper was kneeling on the floor beside the sofa, carefully cleaning up the bullet wound she left in Loki’s leg. Tony stood just behind her with his arms crossed, watching the God for the slightest bit of trickery. Harry was in the shower because the poor kid threw up when Pepper shot Loki and caused his room to ring with the echo of the gunshot.

“You were in my child’s bed, in his mind, and then tried to hug him,” Pepper said frostily. Loki grimaced when Pepper literally slapped a bandaid on his knee.

“I could have killed him,” Loki said as casually as if saying he could have went for a walk. “But I didn’t. He’s quite interesting.” Loki looked up at Tony and pulled his eyebrows together in confusion. “You’re certain he’s your spawn?”

Tony kept his face blank, not letting Loki know how close to home he was hitting with his interest in Harry. The last person to show up out of the mist and become inappropriately interested in Harry was currently sitting in a cell, awaiting a trial.

“99.95% certain,” Tony quipped.

“Ah.” Loki let out a sigh and adopted a sage expression. “That does leave a 0.05% possibility that there’s a better explanation then.”

Pepper glared at Loki while she moved to stand beside Tony.

“Quit making jokes and explain why you’re here,” she said. “Because I have half a mind to call Thor right now—”

“Oh, yes.” Loki stretched out on the sofa and laced his fingers behind his head. He stared up at Tony and Pepper with complete calm on his face. “I am shaking in my boots that my dearest brother will find time in his busy schedule to come scold me for getting to know family.” Loki smiled slyly right at Tony. “Because isn’t family truly the most important thing, Stark?”

Tony grit his teeth and tried to work out Loki’s master plan there. As far as Tony could tell, Harry wasn’t under his thumb or mental rule.

“Should I shoot him again?” Pepper asked Tony.

“Please don’t.” Loki grimaced and waved a hand over his leg, instantly healing the wound that Pepper just wasted ten minutes patching up. “We would hate to startle my grandson again.”

Harry chose then to open his door and slowly make his way around the couch and to Tony’s side. Tony hooked his arm around Harry’s shoulders, keeping him close, and Loki jumped up with a wide smile.

“So we meet at last!” Loki cried. There was a hungry look in his eyes that had Tony on edge when he stared at Harry. “Your godfather did not do you justice in his thoughts, Little One. A child of Magic learning to conquer Sorcery? You’ll be unstoppable,” he breathed.

“Okay, no.” Tony shifted so he stood partially in front of Harry, blocking him from Loki’s line of sight, as soon as he realized what his game was. Loki saw power in the Hulk before and wanted to control him, there was no way in hell that Tony was letting his son become a weapon of destruction in Loki’s hands.

“Calm yourself, Stark,” Loki said. He disappeared and reappeared behind Harry, causing Tony to spin around to block him again.

“I didn’t come to wield your son as a weapon, I merely came to investigate my descendant with two souls.”

Tony and Harry asked the same question at the same time as the elevator dinged.

“Two souls?”

“Fuck.”

Everyone looked to see Sirius had entered the flat and had an incredibly unhappy look on his face.

“Tony, mate, hey. Why don’t you and Loki,” Sirius glowered darkly at the innocently smiling God, “come chat?” His eyes flickered over Harry quickly. “In private, maybe?”

Tony rarely ever felt like he was the one person in a room that didn’t understand something, but he suddenly felt like Steve in a conversation with Tony and Bruce.

It wasn’t what he would call a pleasant feeling.

 

Tony sent Pepper and Harry off to find breakfast once he realized Sirius didn’t want Harry to hear whatever it was he had to say. Pepper gave Tony a very serious ‘you will fill me in later’ look and Harry had just seemed rather confused.

“It’s four am?” Harry said as he used some of his daily allotted hours with the prosthetic to follow Pepper to the elevator.

“Yeah, I know.” Pepper yawned. “You should drive.”

“Oh, okay.”

“He’s easy to please, isn’t he?” Sirius chuckled after Harry and Pepper left. Sirius might have been trying to sound casual, but there was some anxiety to his laugh and in the way he kept running his fingers through his hair.

Tony looked from Loki to Sirius and then sighed in defeat when he waved a hand for them both to sit.

“What’s happening?” Tony asked. “Why is Loki here? What do two souls mean? And why the hell do you look like you’ve killed Harry’s kitten?”

Sirius licked his lips and then fearlessly sank down on the sofa beside an entirely too comfortable looking Loki.

“You remember Albus explaining what horcruxes are?” Sirius asked slowly. “Right, so here’s what happened…”

It took Sirius twenty-six minutes to tell Tony that his son had the soul of a maniac inside of him, keeping the maniac alive.

It took an additional three minutes for Loki to offer to examine Harry.

It only took Tony two seconds to turn that down immediately.

“Get ahold of Gandalf,” Tony told Sirius. “And I’ll call Quahog. And Strange. Fuck, just call everyone who isn’t Reindeer Games. Oh! Thor! Hey, Thor!” Tony looked up at the ceiling frantically. “It’d be a great time for a thunderstorm!”

“My brother has no knowledge of the magical arts,” Loki drawled. He was inspecting his fingernails carelessly. “It requires a finesse that few brutes can manage.”

“And we really don’t want to tell Albus about this,” Sirius said. “I- I wouldn’t even trust Quahog.”

“Why the hell…” Tony trailed off when the shadow in Sirius’ eyes answered for him.

“You think they’ll kill Harry,” Tony said flatly. That was why Sirius didn’t tell Tony to start with, because every other soul piece had to have its container fully destroyed.

“YOU DON’T GET TO KILL MY SON, SIRIUS!” Tony jumped to his feet and his blood pressure was steadily rising until he felt the urge to either throttle Sirius, destroy Loki, and never tell another person about Harry or just… just grab his kid and run.

Harry always wanted to see Russia.

“No, just… get out,” Tony said. He feigned exhaustion and sat down heavily to bury his face in his hands. Tony could have a new passport and identity built for Harry and himself in minutes. Pepper would have to stay and wait for Tony to get Harry on the opposite side of the world.

They could stop in Lagos, Stark Industries had an operating headquarters there, and Tony could create another set of papers for them before going on to… Mumbai, maybe.

Anywhere.

Tony would take Harry anywhere in the world - and he wasn’t ruling Asgard out as an option as well - to keep the wizards from pro and conning Harry’s life against a maniac wizard from coming back to life.

Sirius seemed convinced by Tony’s weary act. He reached out and lightly touched Tony’s knee.

“Stephen has a plan,” Sirius said quietly. “I’m not going to let anyone hurt Harry, you know that.”

Tony nodded and thought that he’d fooled Sirius.

He forgot about Loki.

“You know he’s going to take the child and run the instant you’ve left, right?” Loki asked. Tony looked up enough to once again aim his gauntlet at Loki’s head.

Clearly his acting needed some work.

“Get out, now,” Tony said harshly, giving up the weary act and showing how pissed he was. He didn’t look away from Loki to address Sirius, but his words were for them both. “Harry is my son. My son. You don’t get to- to lobotomize him over something that might happen.”

They didn’t get to touch Harry even if it meant an entire army of Voldemorts rained from the sky like the Chitauri.

Nobody was making the sacrifice play this time. Not Tony and especially not Harry.

All Tony could imagine was the image that Wanda painted in his brain so long ago…

Harry, crying out for him. Tony only reaching him in time to hear his final rattling breath leave his body. Harry dying in Tony’s arms, leaving Tony alone and with a hole in his chest for the rest of his life.

Was that a dream or had it been some sort of sick foreshadowing?

“Tony,” Sirius stood up slowly with his hands raised in a universal sign of peace, “you know if I thought it was time to run, I’d tell you. Hell, I’d clear the way for you. Stephen swears he can remove the soul. I dunno how, but he’s going to do it soon.”

Tony swung the gauntlet to point it at Sirius’ chest. In that moment, Sirius wasn’t Harry’s godfather who sent Tony his son, but a threat to the most important person in Tony’s life.

“Is it going to hurt Harry?” Tony demanded. When Sirius wouldn’t - or couldn’t - answer, it was answer enough. “HE HAS BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH!” Tony yelled. “JUST LEAVE HIM THE HELL ALONE!”

“For the love of the Allfather,” Loki sighed. He rolled his eyes when Tony spared him a quick glance.

For the first time, Tony didn’t see Sirius as his friend and ally. Sirius was just another wizard who was a threat to Harry. Tony’s hand was torn as he continued to swing his weapon from side to side, indecisive on who the bigger threat was.

It took Tony entirely too long to think to summon his second gauntlet. Once he did, he had one trained on Loki and Sirius both.

“Allow me to examine the child,” Loki said calmly. “I have no reason to harm him, Stark.”

“Yeah? No reason to brainwash him to be your minion either?” Tony snarled.

“Harry hardly has the temperament to be a minion,” Loki said factually. “A willing minion is worth much more than a forced one.”

Hitler must have been shivering in a frozen hell because Tony stared in Loki’s eyes and actually considered it. Loki had been in Harry’s head already without doing any damage… He didn’t seem malevolent toward Harry, just… curious.

“What would you do?” Tony asked carefully, shocked at himself for even considering it.

“Reach inside him, feel the soul, see if I can untangle the intruder and release it,” Loki said in a voice that sounded like he wanted to add ‘duh’. “Soul magic is delicate work, even I may not have the power to manipulate them.”

It was hearing Loki be humble about something that had Tony dropping his weapons by half an inch. Loki was humble almost as often as Tony was.

“It’s worth a shot,” Sirius said quietly. “Stephen probably didn’t know Loki was going to show up.”

“Sorcery is many shades lighter than the true magic that burns through me,” Loki said with a smirk. “Imprecise sciences all around.”

Tony had calmed down some. He would still take Harry and run if he had to, but Tony also knew that Sirius would help him.

“We’re going to trust our kid’s soul to Reindeer Games?” Tony asked. When Sirius shrugged, Tony sighed. “Fine, but if Harry becomes a minion of Loki, I hope you’re ready to join the dark side.”

Because there was just no possibility in any universe where Tony would fight against his kid.

 

It felt like a bad joke, waiting for Pepper and Harry to return… a genius, a wizard, and a God entered a bar…

“I’m making coffee,” Tony decided when the silence lasted too long. When Tony pushed himself off the chair to go start coffee, Sirius followed.

“How long?” Tony asked casually while he started a cup. Sirius leaned against the fridge and hummed questioningly.

“How long have you known about that soul thing in Harry?” Tony clarified.

Because clearly Sirius had known for a while. Sirius knew, Strange knew, God damned Loki knew… Tony was one of two people left in the dark.

And even Tony didn’t know what to tell Harry. Tony had never lied to him before, ever, but the kid had a lot of shit weighing on him. His friend just died a few weeks ago, he had a court hearing approaching quickly, there were nights where Harry still woke up screaming from a mixture of nightmares.

‘Hey, son, you know the guy that killed your parents and orchestrated your kidnapping and torture? No, not Barnes, the first kidnapping. Anyway, you’ve got his soul inside of you, keeping him safe. Don’t worry, either we’ll remove it or we’ll move out of the country. Coincidentally, how’s your Greek?’

Somehow, Tony thought that might lead to more rooftops. Or Harry would just portal himself three hundred feet in the air before dropping to the pavement.

“A while,” Sirius admitted. “How was I supposed to tell you, Tony? I didn’t even want to think about it myself.”

“That’s cute, Sirius.” Tony finished his cup and took a sip of it while he studied Sirius over the brim. “No, really, I think you should keep more things about my son from me. Why be honest when we can live a cozy lie?”

“That’s exactly what I was thinking,” Sirius said with a bite to his tone. “I thought about telling you but figured if knowing about it is ruining my life then maybe I’d keep it to myself.”

“You know the difference? The difference is you think Harry might die. I don’t.”

There was nothing that could convince Tony to sacrifice his kid. Darth Vader killed a million people? As long as none of them were Harry. Darth Vader was never going to rest until he killed Harry? Tony could keep Harry happy and hidden for eighty years.

Hell, Tony could hide Harry on the Island of Cats and Harry himself would refuse to ever leave.

Tony made a mental note to consider that as a distinct possibility for relocation. Sure, it would smell like a botched meth lab, but then Tony would have a photo of Harry in a cat pile to add to his album beside the puppy pile photo.

“You don’t get it,” Sirius said softly, interrupting Tony’s ideas on how to cat-piss proof a house. Sirius had his arms crossed lightly over his chest and genuinely looked miserable.

“Harry’s life keeping Voldemort alive is the sickest irony in the bloody world. If he comes back, Harry will never have a moment of peace. And if Harry thinks that dying would save even one person? He’d do it.” Sirius lifted his shoulders some.

“He’s too much like you, mate. I convinced him to run but only when I made it sound like it would help me. And what happened? Harry looked at himself like a coward, like not saving others meant he didn’t deserve to be your son. He won’t do it again, Tony. I know it’s sick, but you can’t tell him. Because if we can’t get it out? He will die.”

Well how was Tony supposed to be pissed off at Sirius when he was making the most sense that he ever had?

“I don’t lie to him,” Tony said.

“So don’t,” Sirius suggested. “I will. Just go in your office, let Loki take a look at souls, and I’ll make up some rubbish about Loki checking his magic.”

It was a rock and a hard place, Tony’s own Sophie’s choice. Would Tony stand back to avoid lying to Harry’s face or would he stand by Harry while Loki went digging around his soul and lie to the kid?

Which was more forgivable?

Tony hadn’t decided until Harry and Pepper returned and Tony actually looked at his son.

“I’ll stay,” Tony breathed to Sirius. “I’m not leaving him behind.”

Sometimes parents had to lie to their kids… good lies, like ‘Santa is coming tonight’ or ‘no the dentist isn’t going to hurt you’.

“At least he’ll have Pepper when he hates us,” Sirius whispered back brightly. “C’mon, let’s see some magic from a God.”

 

Ultimately, it wasn’t that interesting to witness. Tony and Sirius both assured Harry that Loki was interested in checking his magical health. Pepper gave Tony a skeptical look, but he just shook his head at her.

Tony couldn’t tell Pepper and bring her in on the lie, no need for Harry to hate all three of them.

“So you’re like a doctor?” Harry asked as he laid back on the couch at Loki’s command. As properly wary as Harry had been of Loki, he seemed incredibly comfortable as soon as Tony and Sirius vouched for him.

Something Tony would feel guilty over for quite some time, he was sure.

“Doctors wish they were me,” Loki said. He knelt down beside Harry’s head and raised a hand above his face. “Close your eyes, Little One. Relax, don’t fight me.”

Harry sent Tony one more trusting look past Loki before he closed his eyes and let out a slow and heavy breath.

A glowing light trickled down from Loki’s fingertips and connected him to Harry’s forehead. The two of them both shivered and it was the only physical reaction they gave.

“I don’t like this,” Pepper whispered in Tony’s ear. “What’s going on?”

Tony wrapped an arm around her waist and shook his head again.

“Pep, if I could tell you I would,” he said truthfully. “Trust me on this one, it’s better if you don’t know.”

The clock ticked ominously and Tony eventually shifted around to watch Loki’s face while he worked. While Harry looked peaceful enough to be sleeping, Loki had his face screwed up with concentration. His lips occasionally opened and closed, as if speaking silently, and Tony couldn’t help but think that he’d start the Church of Loki if the God could remove the soul piece from his son.

After nearly twelve minutes of Loki working on Harry, Loki’s face had a light sheen of sweat on it and Harry had his nose scrunched up.

At minute seventeen, the sizzling sound of a portal opened up beside Sirius. Tony looked over and saw Strange step through the portal, take one look at Loki, and then glare at Sirius with irritation.

“Can you not just trust me?” Strange demanded, not bothering to keep his voice down. Strange put his hands on his hips and narrowed his eyes until they were just a little more than slits. “One future, Sirius, one. There is one path to do this and the Trickster God isn’t part of it.”

“Maybe if you’d tell me what this one path is, I wouldn’t have let Loki try,” Sirius hissed. “He’s a God, Stephen.”

“No, he’s an annoying legend that’s best left in Asgard. I’m practically a God.”

“Oh, really? You’re the most arrogant prat I have ever met.”

“Says Mister ‘I completed the animagus transformation at fifteen’.”

“I’d like to see you turn into a bloody animal!”

“I thought they were dating?” Pepper whispered while she and Tony listened to their dispute without looking away from their kid.

“It’s like their foreplay,” Tony murmured distractedly. Something was happening, Loki was breathing harshly and Harry had his hands fisted at his sides.

All at once, Harry’s eyes popped open, the mist connecting him to Loki disappeared, and Loki slid across the floor until he hit the far wall.

Tony didn’t need to see Loki shake his head to know he’d failed. And Tony especially didn’t need to hear Strange whisper ‘I told you so’ to Sirius.

 

The Island of Cats was actually called Aoshima Island, if Tony’s geography wasn’t failing him. Tony didn’t know Japanese, but he could probably invent an automatic language converter to use while learned.

Chapter Text

Harry was in a rather good mood when he returned from school. He’d gotten a B on his math test, his English teacher said his writing had greatly improved, and Greene had texted Harry to tell him he was back home.

Plus Tony said that the lawyers were offering Bucky a plea deal that morning so with any luck it meant that Harry wouldn’t have to go to court.

And Loki was back.

When Harry stepped off the lifts, he immediately saw Loki stretched out on the couch, lazily flipping through telly channels like a muggle. Loki told Harry he’d return to talk magic with him, but Harry hadn’t believed him.

Or, technically, Harry didn’t think Tony would let Loki back in their flat. After the odd experience the other night when Loki went diving in Harry’s head, everyone had sorts of disappeared.

Tony, Sirius, Loki, and Strange went to Sirius’ flat and Harry and Pepper shared breakfast while they speculated over the queer behavior. Pepper thought that perhaps Tony was trying to build another magic powered machine that he needed Loki for. Harry said perhaps he’d damaged his magic by not using a wand and Loki was telling the others that Harry could never be a wizard again.

But then Harry made a portal to let Joey go to the bathroom outside and decided that sorcery was more useful anyway.

When they’d returned, Tony seemed off. He had been acting evasive and didn’t really answer any of Harry’s questions. Loki had been perfectly cheerful though. He told Harry that his magic was fascinating and that he would return to discuss it with him at some point before disappearing.

Harry wanted to ask Tony what that had been about, but he also wanted to go back to sleep. When he woke back up later, everyone had been acting normal and Harry brushed it off as a paranoid thought from his exhaustion.

“Humans are so tedious,” Loki remarked while he continued flipping through channels. Harry peeked in Tony’s office and frowned when he wasn’t there.

It wasn’t a big deal, but Tony was usually always home when Harry returned from school.

“He’s with your godfather,” Loki said, somehow guessing what Harry was frowning about even without looking at him. “I volunteered to babysit.”

“And he let you?” Harry asked, surprised by that.

Loki looked over at Harry and smirked. “He did not. Stark asked Peitro to babysit.”

Harry sighed as he sank down in the recliner. He was more used to his prosthetic, but his stump still ached by the time Harry returned from school.

“And where is Pietro?” Harry asked as he lazily reached through a portal to grab a snack and drink.

There weren’t a lot of things that Harry missed from Hogwarts that weren’t people, but lunch was one of them. American school lunches were tiny and terrible.

“Unconscious in his room, having pleasant dreams,” Loki said nonchalantly. He rolled over to sit up and gave Harry a curious look while Harry popped open a bag of crisps. “You are my descendant.”

Harry chewed a crisp with exaggerated slowness while he stared balefully at Loki.

“My mum’s side or Tony’s?” Harry asked. Not that it mattered, really. Hermione had told Harry that all witches and wizards were descended from the Gods after he told her about Loki.

One of the twins must have heard her because Harry got a very excited video call from them both as they begged to see Loki. Harry was pretty sure that George actually cried when Harry told him he left.

“Your mother, of course,” Loki sniffed. “Stark carries no magic within him. You were a genetic anomaly.”

Harry blinked while he grabbed another crisp.

“That’s rude,” he said. “You’re a rude person, Grandpa.”

Harry had been trying to be rude back at Loki with the quip, but it had the opposite reaction. Loki looked entirely too thrilled by Harry calling him that and he let out a peal of laughter that was almost sinister.

“Oh, we are going to have fun,” Loki cooed. “Come, Little One, let me show you the ways of true trickery.”

Harry actually had a history report he needed to do research for, but… but that sounded much more fun.

“We’re not killing anyone,” Harry warned Loki. He remembered the video he watched of Tony and his team fighting Loki, Harry wasn’t planning on signing up to enslave the human race.

Loki sighed dramatically and then slid down to the end of the sofa closest to Harry.

“You have no enemies that we could conquer together?” Loki asked in a wheedling tone. His clever green eyes flicked down to where Harry had been massaging his thigh through his jeans.

“Kill? No. Trick?” Harry suddenly had a beautiful and lovely image in his head… how many hours did Harry spend in the dungeons being taunted by a man meant to teach him? How often did Harry feel like less of a person because Snape made him hate himself?

“I do have someone we could mess with…” Harry said slowly. “But we can’t kill him.”

Even Snape wasn’t worth Azkaban.

 

Harry wasn’t just invisible, he was completely gone. Loki had made Harry disappear to the point that Harry waved his hand through his arm and felt nothing.

It was a bit terrifying, but also brilliant.

Harry had opened the portal for them, mostly so he could be involved as Loki arrogantly informed him that true Gods didn’t require portals made from sorcery.

It was nearly ten at Hogwarts and the castle was silent while Harry and Loki made their way to the dungeons. Only Loki could hear Harry, so Harry explained all that he knew about Snape while they walked.

“Sirius says he used to be friends with my mum,” Harry said. “But then he joined Voldemort and overheard the prophecy that made Voldemort kill my parents.”

“So this is revenge,” Loki said knowingly.

“Er… yes,” Harry said. “He’s also a complete git. He hated my other dad, James, so he hated me. He spent every class I had with him just mocking me.”

Belittling Harry, mocking him, tormenting him.

Snape was a grown man and bullied Harry worse than even Dudley ever had. No, Snape never hit Harry, but his barbs didn’t need to be physical to hurt Harry.

“Did he?” Loki hummed. “Unacceptable.”

Harry brightened and nodded his head. “Exactly.”

And even if Harry was about to give Snape a taste of his own medicine, Harry was fifteen. Harry could still be a dick. Snape was the teacher that was trusted to teach and guide students, Harry was the kid.

It was too easy to forgive himself while Harry directed Loki to Snape’s office.

Loki paused outside Snape’s door and waved Harry closer. He put his hand on top of Harry’s head and closed his eyes while he inhaled and then exhaled slowly.

“I should kill him,” Loki hissed after a moment. His eyes were a dangerous thing when they flashed with magic and whatever he just took from Harry’s mind. “My descendant was preparing to take his own life while that vermin taunted him?!”

Harry had a very uncomfortable realization of what exactly Loki had seen….

 

Harry couldn’t sleep. He’d been awake for days and it was beginning to mess with his mind. Everything was fuzzy and Harry couldn’t concentrate.

He had been sitting in potions beside Hermione, mechanically chopping daisy roots, while he thought about what it would be like to die.

Just… one jump from the Astronomy Tower and everything would be over. No more tournament, no pain in his scar. Harry wouldn’t be subjected to his classmates who called him a liar and a crybaby since Rita’s article was published.

It sounded so peaceful.

Harry startled in his seat when Snape abruptly slapped his table.

“What are you doing?” Snape hissed. He looked down at Harry’s roots that were mangled and then back up at Harry’s face.

Harry cringed internally as Snape stared hard in Harry’s eyes with his teeth bared and nostrils flaring.

“Daydreaming about your tournament?” Snape asked, loudly enough for the Slytherins to hear and begin snickering. “That’s twenty points from Gryffindor, Potter. And detention tonight.”

Harry’s face had been a dark red but he was too tired to even try and argue against blatant unfairness.

 

Harry went to detention that night and after two hours of scrubbing cauldrons and hearing everything about him be mocked - from the ‘pathetic’ state he was as in to his lack of intelligence and likelihood of dying in the first task - Harry went directly to the Astronomy Tower.

It was only luck that Harry called Sirius, just to hear him one more time. Sirius had been the one to see how bad everything had gotten and eventually convinced Harry to go back to his dorm.

Sirius had saved Harry’s life more than once, truthfully.

 

“You shouldn’t mention that,” Harry told Loki carefully, once again ashamed by how selfish he had been. “Just… you know… mess with him. But not murder.”

“You are tying my hands, Little One.” Loki relented when Harry stared deadpan at him, refusing to allow him to actually kill Snape. “Fine,” he snapped. “But that man is no descent of mine.”

When Loki walked through the solid door, Harry followed. And, because he was rather fond of the twins, Harry pulled his phone out and started recording.

 

As Loki stepped through the wall, he had shifted his appearance to be a perfect replica of Professor Dumbledore all the way down to his overly colorful purple robes.

“Severus.” Loki stood before Snape’s desk and Harry was already thrilled to see Snape jolt at the sudden appearance.

“Albus.” Snape sat down the quill he’d been marking papers with and tilted his head slightly at Loki. “I was not expecting you.”

“I would say that there are a great many things you were not expecting, Severus,” Loki said in Dumbledore’s gravest voice. “I am grateful to you for your service and loyalty, dear boy. It pains me to have to do this…”

Harry held his breath when Loki trailed off and Snape anxiously awaited whatever Loki had planned.

“You’re fired, Severus. Active immediately.”

Harry actually laughed and was relieved that only Loki could hear him. Snape’s face lost all of the little color he had and Harry sort of hoped that he would cry.

If Snape cried, Harry would send the video to Sirius as well.

“Fired?” Snape repeated slowly as he stood up. “Why?”

Loki spread his arms wide and Harry hadn’t noticed that he conjured an exact replica of Dumbledore’s wand, but it was a nice touch.

“I trusted these students to you, Severus,” Loki said regretfully. “I had hoped that you would see the innocence in these children of magic and it would change you.”

“I never wanted to teach these brats, as you know,” Snape spat at Loki. “I took the job to stay close at your insistence.”

Loki smiled sagely in a flawless performance.

“Then it should not bother you that your particular talents are no longer needed, Severus. I thank you and wish you well.”

Harry stayed where he was as Loki turned and strode out the door. Snape looked genuinely shocked and Harry was petty enough that he wanted to remember that moment for a very long time.

Snape might be a brilliant man, he might regret his choices when he was younger, but he was also cruel. School shouldn’t be a place so filled with cruelty that it led students to having their worst fear be a teacher. Teachers shouldn’t grade with a grudge and squash any pleasure a student could get from their class.

Snape finding a new job would be a kindness to every student with a passion for potions.

Loki returned to Harry’s side a few seconds later, as invisible and apparently unheard as Harry was.

“I had hoped that he would cry,” Loki said while they watched Snape grab his belongings from his desk.

“Yeah, me too,” Harry sighed. He grinned up at Loki after he ended the recording. “Wanna meet your biggest fans?”

 

Harry led Loki to the Gryffindor Tower once he was sure that Snape left—

If Harry was a better person, he might feel bad that Snape was under the impression that he’d been fired. But Harry wasn’t that good of a person and Snape was a terrible teacher anyway. If any of Harry’s teachers at Midtown talked to their students like Snape did then Harry imagined they’d have been fired immediately.

Apparently passwords and portraits didn’t mean anything to the magic of a God as Harry and Loki just walked through the tunnel.

There were loads of people still awake and Harry pointed at where Fred and George were entertaining students with some of their joke shop items. Hermione was on the sofa with Ron and continually shot dirty looks at the twins who had the common room in an uproar.

“Oh, I like them,” Loki breathed. He was smiling almost manically as he watched the twins show off a set of hats that temporarily allowed the wearers to swap heads, but not bodies.

“They’re brilliant,” Harry agreed. It was a neat bit of magic and Harry laughed when a first year traded heads with Lee Jordan and nearly toppled over with Lee’s grown head on his much smaller body.

“Are we aiming to make them cry?” Loki asked.

“No,” Harry said firmly. “Just, you know, prank them nicely.”

Loki sighed again and Harry felt like he was trying to raise a very petulant dog.

‘Bad, Loki! We don’t kill people!’

‘No, Loki! Don’t traumatize anyone!’

It gave Harry a new appreciation for what a good dog Joey was.

Harry and Loki had an entire debate over the best way to mess with the twins right in the middle of the common room. Nobody could see them, nobody could hear them, and by the time they settled on a decision, Harry had his phone out ready to record again.

 

When Loki slammed the portrait open and caught every student’s attention, he was Molly Weasley.

Ron jumped to his feet and paled at the look of fury on ‘Molly’s’ face.

“Mum?” Ron asked.

Loki stormed right past Ron in the direct path to the twins that the other students created. Ron breathed a sigh of relief as he sank back down to the sofa. Hermione smacked him in the arm and shook her head but Harry didn’t blame Ron.

If Molly was really there, Harry would be relieved to not be the focus of her attention too.

“FRED AND GEORGE WEASLEY!” Loki put his hands on his hips and glared at the twins so harshly that they actually cowered.

“DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT LETTER I JUST RECEIVED FROM THE HEADMASTER?” Loki yelled. “YOU BLEW UP THE SLYTHERIN DORMITORY??”

“What?!” Fred yelped. “No we didn’t!”

“Swear!” George added.

“I hope Malfoy’s been burned,” Ron murmured from the sofa, earning another swat from Hermione.

“Oh?” Loki gave the twins an incredibly unimpressed face. “I suppose some other set of twins with no regard for safety set off bombs in the Slytherin dorms?”

“I’ve always been suspicious of the Patil twins,” George said seriously.

“Hey! Racist!” Parvati cried from where she sat on the floor with Lavender. “Don’t try and blame your antics on me!”

“You two are coming with me,” Loki told the twins. He grabbed them both by an ear and began dragging them to the portrait hole while the other students began gossiping over their misfortune.

Harry followed them and Loki waited until just after the Fat Lady swung shut to shimmer and then straighten up as himself once more.

“Holy…”

“Mother…”

“Of Loki…”

Harry was rather pleased when the twins’ eyes rolled back in their heads simultaneously. He winced in sympathy when Loki released their ears and they fell backward, hitting the hard ground with their heads.

“Do we wake them?” Loki asked with only slight curiosity.

Harry debated the issue and then shook his head.

“No, they’ll start screeching and then Professor McGonagall will show up and then…” Harry furrowed his brows while he tried to think of what would actually happen if McGonagall knew Harry had snuck in the castle with a God from their myths.

“It’s probably best if we just leave,” Harry said. He wasn’t sure how McGonagall could react and that woman had the potential to be terrifying. Plus, Harry had the video of the twins and the one of Snape, it would hold him over for a while when he needed a laugh.

 

When Harry and Loki returned to the Tower, Harry was content to laze on the sofa and listen to Loki recount his many acts of trickery.

Loki lived a colorful life where his gender changed as often as his mood. Harry listened when he described wars of the Æsir and Jötnar and how he found himself occasionally leading troops to victory and sometimes leading them purposefully astray.

Loki laughed merrily when he described having to go in disguise to help his brother Thor get his hammer back from a king named Thrym. Apparently disguises and face-to-face deceit were some of Loki’s preferred bouts of chaos.

Harry had been rather disconcerted when Loki described disguising himself as a female horse in order to lure another horse, a male, away from his work.

“So you had a horse baby?” Harry asked once he was able to pick his jaw up off his chest.

“Sleipnir, yes,” Loki said. He waved his hand as if it was of no concern at all. “As I was saying…”

Harry liked Loki’s stories if for no other reason than he made Harry’s life seem incredibly plain. In fact, Harry was boring.

Harry was a nobody compared to Loki.

He loved it.

 

When Tony finally returned, Harry had gotten his research for history done (Loki probably invented some of the information he gave Harry on the Mayan Empire, but Harry could fact check with Peter before putting it in his essay) and the two of them were watching a movie.

“Where’s Pietro?” Tony asked with a suspicious look toward Loki.

“He’s asleep,” Harry lied cheerily. It wasn’t actually a lie; Peitro was asleep and Loki said he’d wake up on his own after twenty-four hours.

Harry rolled over on his side to look up at Tony. Then Harry frowned.

Tony actually didn’t look like he was in any sort of a good mood. He didn’t look angry, he looked tired. Harry tried to remember what Loki told him that Tony had to do that day and then felt his insides go icy when he remembered.

“I have to go to court, right?” Harry asked flatly. If Tony had been meeting with the lawyers and didn’t seem relieved at all, then Harry had to assume that it meant the case was still ongoing.

Harry had a lot of mixed feelings about it, most of which he had explained to him by his therapist.

Harry felt angry about it; Bucky’s mental problems had been dropped directly on Harry’s head- or leg, more actually. Harry also felt guilty because his dad told him that Bucky was dangerous and Harry didn’t believe him until it was too late. And a small part of Harry hated that he had been the one to befriend Bucky and Bucky was being punished for being insane.

At the root of it, Harry thought HYDRA should be the one on trial. Except then Michael had tried to say that would be like only punishing Voldemort for what his death eaters did and then Harry went back to being confused and torn up over the whole issue.

Tony sighed and Harry knew when he sat on the floor beside Harry that it wasn’t good news.

“Maybe not,” Tony said slowly. His eyes looked faraway and Harry waited for him to explain.

“I’m going to track down Steve, see if he can get through to Barnes that he should take the deal,” Tony eventually said.

“Or we—”

“We’re not killing anyone,” Harry said. He made a tiny portal to stick his hand through and flick Loki on the nose. “Bad, Loki.”

Loki looked affronted by being flicked in the nose by a teenager, but then the girl that was stuck in a grown man’s body tried to put on a skirt and Loki was focused on the telly once again.

    Up Next: Tony and Steve talk

Chapter 93: “That’s called karmic reparations.”
Notes:

    Man, this chapter fought me tooth and nail to get done. I think the closer we get to the end, the more my muse is like ‘meh’. Also, as much as I fucking adore even numbers (100 would be solid- I won’t lie), I don’t want to add fillers to this story and thus- the end is even closer my friends.

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

Tony rubbed his hands together and resisted the urge to check the time again. Tony was early, he knew that, but he was also annoyed and anxious to get the little meeting over with.

It had been Sam that suggested Tony talk with Steve at the VA. Sam was able to contact Steve, Tony bought breakfast for Harry’s support group as usual, and then he went outside to wait for Steve to arrive.

The last thing that Tony wanted to do was ask Steve for anything. It irritated him more than cold coffee to even reach out. Steve could be traced back as the root problem that was Barnes. If Steve had turned him in to the proper authorities from the start, Barnes never would have been free to stalk and abduct Harry.

For such a ‘we have to follow the laws, Tony’ kind of guy, Steve really screwed the freaking pooch with Barnes.

 

Tony didn’t have to wait long, Steve was Mr Punctual and pulled up on the black motorcycle Tony used to love right at eight. Tony watched with carefully expressionless eyes as Steve put it on the kickstand and walked toward Tony by the entrance.

“Hey,” Steve said evenly, with a hint of a smile. “I’m glad you called.”

“I didn’t,” Tony said flatly, refusing to cave to the politeness of small talk. “Sam did and he only called because you need to talk to Barnes.”

“What?” Steve had his hands in his pockets and he rocked back on the heel of his boots. “I thought this was about us?”

“Us?” Tony repeated, barely holding back a laugh. “Steve, there is no us. We were co-workers and now we’re not.”

Some things in a colleague and friend could be patched up. If Steve got drunk and broke Tony’s TV, sure. But Steve hid away a psycho, had him in his hands post-stalking Harry, then let him go again. And Steve covered for the psycho in question even knowing that he killed Tony’s parents.

There was no patch in the world big enough to fix that.

“You need to tell Barnes to take the deal MACUSA offered him,” Tony said, sticking to why they were there before Harry’s group ended and he began looking for Tony.

It was kind of cute, they were like besties lately. Tony drew up interior models of the new house while Harry did his homework. Harry chatted about his geek while Tony tried to care at all about the business he was meant to be running. It was kind of like what Tony wanted his relationship with Howard to be when he was a kid… except it was reality.

Reality was 3000 times better than a childhood dream.

“Bucky said that he’s got his head on straight now,” Steve said. “There’s no reason for him to be locked up, Tony. He’s better now.”

“And? That means he shouldn’t have any repercussions?” Tony asked. “Twenty years is a hell of a lot less time than the eighty years Harry’s going to be living with one leg.”

“That wasn’t Bucky’s fault,” Steve said quickly. He really had an excuse for everything for his buddy, must be nice to have Captain America justifying every decision someone made.

Tony wouldn’t know what that was like though.

Tony had to take a slow breath to keep from screaming. “Steve, he kidnapped him and left an injury untreated. It’s a crime. This isn’t some personal vendetta—” though Tony did have a personal vendetta against Barnes “—this is the law. He did it, he’s guilty. Tell him to take the deal and spare Harry a trial.”

“Bucky was sick,” Steve said. When he lifted his chin and crossed his arms, tony knew it was a lost cause. Steve was loyal to the end, just not to Tony or Tony’s family. “He thought he was saving Harry!”

“AND HE DAMN NEAR KILLED HIM!” Tony yelled, losing his patience. Tony took a deep breath again and tried to reign in his temper. When Tony was mostly confident he wouldn’t continue screaming, he leveled Steve with a glare.

“I don’t care that he was sick and neither will a jury,” Tony told Steve. “He’s looking at a few decades in prison either way. Personally, I’m hoping for the maximum life sentence, but Harry is fifteen, Steve. He shouldn’t have to go testify and go through all this shit again.”

Harry had enough crap in his life to deal with. He had the totally normal things, like a history report and dates with his geek, then he had the completely horrible things like the horcrux inside of him and Strange dragging his feet on removing it.

“There’s no world where any jury finds Barnes innocent,” Tony told Steve, pleading as much as he could for his kid. “Tell him to take the deal, Steve. It’s a good deal. He’ll be out in twenty years if he takes it.”

Tony didn’t like to think that Harry would still be around in twenty years when Barnes would be released, but it was better than nothing if the jury bought in the insanity defense.

“If it were switched, what would you do?” Steve asked genuinely, his blue eyes pleading just as hard as Tony was. “If Harry were the one who made a mistake, what would you do?”

Tony would back his kid. Tony backed his kid almost eight months ago and Tony thought he was on the run from the law and Tony would back his kid for the rest of their lives.

Family was family.

Tony didn’t answer and Steve nodded. Steve uncrossed his arms and gave Tony an unhappy frown.

“I’m all he has left,” Steve said in the face of Tony’s silence. “If there’s even a small chance that he can get the freedom he deserves then he should take it.”

It was an incredibly tiny chance. It was the slimmest odds in the world that the ‘Soldier Who Slayed’ gets off scot-free after crippling the ‘Boy Who Lived’.

It was the reminder of Barnes’ lawyer being so confident in his insanity defense that had Tony yelling at Steve’s back when he turned around to leave.

“YOU SHOULD BE ON TRIAL BESIDE HIM!” Tony yelled at the man that had once been something like a friend to Tony. “IF YOU HAD GOTTEN HIM THE HELP YOU THOUGHT HE NEEDED, THIS WOULDN’T HAVE HAPPENED!”

Steve paused and he looked over his shoulder at Tony. There was a moment when Tony felt like they were both thinking of the friendship they struck up, the petty fights they had, and the overshadowing cloud of all Steve kept from Tony. There was a chasm between them that was bottomless and too volatile to ever cross.

“I am sorry, Tony,” Steve said quietly. “Harry’s a good kid, he didn’t deserve this. But Bucky’s a good man, he doesn’t deserve this either.”

“Barnes deserves to rot in prison and you deserve to watch him,” Tony said coldly. Tony stuffed his hands in his pockets to keep from acting on the violent urge to throw a punch at Steve. “If it isn’t clear, consider yourself off Sirius’ team.”

It was childish, kicking Steve from the Avengers, but they weren’t really the Avengers anymore. With Sirius leading the team and SHIELD down for the count, they were just a group of people who hung out together and kicked ass when they were needed.

“Fine,” Steve said evenly, unbothered by Tony’s taunt. He turned to walk away again and Tony just wanted to hurt him somehow. Tony wanted to crack Steve’s calm demeanor and make him as angry and hurt as Tony was.

“Oh, and your shield’s gone too.”

Steve whipped his head around and Tony finally got to see some emotion from him. Steve didn’t look pissed, he looked shocked.

“You threw away the priceless vibranium shield that Howard made?” Steve demanded.

“You mean the shield that my dad made? My dad that your buddy killed? No.” Tony grinned and felt his own anger soothing some as he knew he finally found the button to hit to irritate Steve. “I melted it down, made Harry a leg. I think that’s called karmic reparations.”

Steve still walked away, but Tony saw the hurt in his eyes before he did.

It didn’t keep Harry from having to go to court, but it did make Tony feel a little bit better about it all.

 

“Piss off.”

“It will help with the jury.”

Harry looked at Tony, but it was Pepper who responded.

“I believe that Harry said piss off,” she said sweetly to the prosecutor. The three of them had hardly stepped in the magical courthouse in West New York before the prosecutor cornered them. It took even less time for her to piss Harry off by suggesting he remove his prosthetic and sit in a wheelchair during his testimony.

Tony could see the draw of it, immediately sway the jury to the side of the crippled child. But Tony wouldn’t do it and he wasn’t surprised that Harry refused as well. It was hard enough to get Harry to take it easy, he was going on almost daily runs with his geek and their new friend Flash, convincing himself to use a wheelchair when he had just started his timer for time on his prosthetic was a lost cause.

“I understand,” the prosecutor said, as if she had any options. “Al Saud has cleared the gallery and we’re ready for Harry now.”

Sirius have Tony a rundown on the magical expectations in courtrooms. For the most part, it was pretty standard. They had different ways to enter evidence, but two lawyers playing ‘who tells a better story’ was universal. The one irritating difference was that Pepper couldn’t enter the courtroom with Tony and Harry.

Supposedly it was already a stretch to let her attend, but it was a hard limit to let her sit in on a magical trial during a minor’s testimony.

“You’ll do fine,” Pepper reassured Harry before he was taken in the room by the prosecutor. “Just Look at your dad and stay calm, okay?”

It was a sweet moment in the middle of a frustrating situation. Pepper fussed over Harry for a moment before he brushed her off and rolled his eyes.

“I know,” Harry said. He gave Pepper a quick and sideways hug to take the sting out of his terse voice.

“Don’t do anything stupid,” Pepper warned Tony once Harry followed the prosecutor in the courtroom. “This isn’t the Tony Stark Show.”

“It’s always the Tony Stark Show,” Tony said. He kissed Pepper quickly, already sweating over Harry being out of his sight. “Love you.”

“I love you.”

 

The inside of the courtroom was average enough. There was a boxed off segment to the side where thirteen normal-looking witches and wizards sat. The judge over the case sat in the front center of the room. Tony was relieved that all of the benches were empty- they had promised Harry privacy during his testimony but Tony had been skeptical over it. There was a metal bar that separated the gallery from the procedural area that Tony stepped over to take a seat beside Al Saud.

Tony didn’t give a damn about any courtroom rules, if his son was going to be on the other side of the metal bar, sitting up at the witness stand, then Tony would sit his incredibly-unhappy-ass at the table with the prosecution team so Harry could see him the whole time. They already barred Pepper from the room, Tony would be damned if they tried to stick him in the gallery.

Harry looked at Tony, just like Pepper instructed him to, and Tony hated seeing his son’s fingers twitching when the judge made him swear to tell the truth. Tony didn’t think he imagined the irony on Harry’s face when Harry raised his scarred left hand to swear to tell the truth.

It was messed up, because Tony wanted Harry down from that stand immediately, but Tony was brimming with pride for his kid. Harry looked nervous with his twitching fingers and eyes that kept almost moving to Barnes before he caught himself and refocused on Tony, but his voice was confident when he said his name and address for the court.

The prosecutor led him through a series of questions on what Harry had been doing the day that Barnes took him. Tony played it in his mind as well- the flying, the racing, the way he felt like he was bonding with his kid.

And then Harry said he was sick, he snuck off to help Peter and Barnes—

“Then I felt something hard hit me in the head.” Harry was looking at the prosecutor then who strategically placed herself in front of Barnes, blocking him from Harry’s view. “And everything went black.”

“When you were conscious next, where were you?”

“In the back seat of a car, with Bucky. Er… with Mister Barnes.”

Tony turned his head just enough so he could see Barnes from the corner of his vision without losing sight of Harry. Barnes might have been dressed up and made to look like a choir boy with his haircut and perfectly apologetic expression, but he wasn’t truly sorry.

If he was, then he wouldn’t be forcing Harry to testify when they all knew he was guilty.

“Had you ever met the defendant before that day?”

“Yeah.” Harry straightened himself up and Tony nodded subtly when Harry looked toward him.

It really didn’t matter what Harry had done before that day, Harry was the child. It was on Tony’s conscious that he didn’t keep better track of his kid and on Barnes’ conscious for befriending a teenager.

“I felt bad for him,” Harry said, looking back at the prosecutor. “My dad, er… Tony Stark—”

Tony grinned.

“—told me that Mister Barnes was dangerous, but I thought he was wrong.”

“As most teenagers do,” the prosecutor said in a sly way, reminding the jury of Harry’s age that excused his incredibly poor decisions. “What did you and the defendant do when you were together before the day he kidnapped you?”

“Objection! I thought we were here to determine that to be fact or not?”

“I’ll rephrase,” the prosecutor said smoothly. She could rephrase all she wanted, the jury wouldn’t forget it.

Tony knew it, she knew it. She was damn good.

“Before the day you were flying with your father, what did you do on the occasions you met with the defendant?”

“We talked,” Harry said with a shrug that Tony knew would only make Harry look more like a child to the others. “Sometimes he’d be a bit confused, he would think he was working a mission, and one time he accidentally broke my arm.”

Tony made a fist with his left hand at the same time Barnes’ lawyer called for an objection. Harry never told Tony that before, Barnes broke his arm?

Tony should have shot him in the head when he had the chance.

The lawyers approached the stand at the judges order and Harry looked at Tony with his big sad eyes.

‘Sorry’, Harry mouthed.

Tony shook his head, Harry didn’t need to be sorry.

“You’re doing great,” Tony whispered to him before the prosecutor leaned over the stand to whisper with Harry.

“The jury is to be informed that if the next witness, Mister Sirius Orion Black, verifies Mister Potter-Stark’s statement that a charge of second degree assault will be added,” the judge ruled. He nodded to the prosecutor as Barnes’ lawyer sat back down. “You may continue.”

If Sirius knew that Barnes had broken Harry’s arm and never told Tony… Tony actually didn’t know what he would do because it wasn’t like Sirius didn’t keep much worse secrets about Harry from him.

Clearly Sirius never learned that secrets didn’t make friends.

Harry went on with his story, pausing occasionally when asked a question, and Tony made himself envision it all as Harry described it. If Harry had to relive it all, Tony would as well. It was another odd time to feel pride, but Tony was so god damned proud of the way Harry stayed calm, polite, factual.

It wasn’t even bias, Tony just knew he had the best son in the world. It made him feel bad for those other parents with their substandard children.

It wasn’t until the prosecutor played a memory of what had to be Sirius’ that Harry shrunk in his seat. Tony touched his finger to his ear, the sign they agreed on beforehand.

‘Do you need a break?’

Harry shook his head and kept his eyes on his lap while the memory began playing.

The prosecutor entered exhibit C and everyone in the room got to watch the surgery where Strange removed Harry’s leg with quick and measured movements while Sirius followed behind him with his wand, sealing the wound. It was so much more graphic and bloody than Tony expected. Seeing the leg all over again, the black necrotic tissue from the clots that formed at the break, it made Tony wish they had waited until Sirius testified to play it. The prosecutor only wanted it to play with Harry on the stand to ensure victory with one swift wave of sympathy. How could anyone see the actual child on the stand and watch the memory and not want to do what they could to give him justice?

“STOP! Fuck, stop, please!”

It wasn’t Harry who begged for the memory to stop playing, it was Barnes.

Tony looked over at Barnes the same time Harry looked up at him and they both got to watch as Barnes and his lawyer got in a quick and heated whispered argument.

“Your honor, may we request a brief recess?” Barnes’ lawyer eventually requested. As soon as it was granted, Harry flew off the stand and only stumbled once before reaching Tony’s side.

“What was that?” Harry asked him thickly.

Tony watched Barnes’ lawyer lead him from the room and shook his head. Barnes was crying, working to earn his own sympathy probably.

“No idea.” Tony put his arm around Harry’s shoulders and forced a smile. “Come on, let’s go find your favorite future step-mom.”

 

Tony, Pepper, and Harry sat the room that had been sequestered for Harry during the recess. Al Saud sent a silver swordfish to tell them that he would talk to them as soon as he could.

“We should have eloped,” Pepper suddenly complained. Tony and Harry both looked at her, giving her the same bemused expression. They had been quiet so far, both Starks were thinking of the trial they weren’t allowed to discuss outside of the courtroom until it was all over. Tony had no idea what prompted Pepper to say that, but he never missed an opportunity to tease her.

“We are in a court house,” Tony said with a grin. “Harry’s even in a suit.”

“A bloody uncomfortable one,” Harry complained, pulling a face while he tugged on his collar.

Pepper had her legs crossed and one professional black heel was tapping the floor with her usual ‘I can’t wait for this meeting to end’ type of impatience.

“It’s too late now,” she said with a huff. “I’ve missed the bulk of Harry’s testimony.”

“Hear that?” Tony looked over at Harry and winked. “She’s only marrying me to get to you.”

“Understandable, I’m the superior Stark,” Harry quipped. Tony could tell his heart wasn’t really in the banter though, not with the way he too was tapping his foot on the floor and his eyes were on the door.

“You know what we need?” Tony decided. “A vacation. Kid, Spring Break is coming up, right?”

“In March,” Harry said absently.

“March eighteenth,” Pepper clarified.

Tony looked from where his fiancée stared at the door to where his son was.

Yeah, they all needed a vacation. And, if Strange didn’t get off his ass and fix the pesky soul issue he swore on his life that he would, it would be a one way trip to Aoshima Island.

 

After what seemed like an eternity of waiting, Al Saud finally entered the room by himself. Al Saud was dressed as impeccably as usual, but there was a smug look in his dark eyes to go with the whole ‘I eat defense attorneys for breakfast’ ensemble.

“Barnes is willing to accept a plea,” Al Saud said, shocking the hell out of Tony.

“Why now?” Pepper asked sharply, the same question Tony had.

“His lawyer is citing a guilty conscious,” Al Saud scoffed. “My money is on Barnes knowing he’s going to be found guilty.”

“So it’s done?” Harry asked with a twinge of hope. “We can go home?”

Al Saud cleared his throat and Tony knew it wasn’t going to be that easy.

“Barnes is asking for a contingency to the original plea agreement,” Al Saud said slowly, looking at Tony directly. “He is willing to accept an additional five years in exchange for being granted permission to have a single visit with Harry.”

Tony and Pepper were of the same mind,

“No.”

Harry was not,

“Done.”

“Kid,” Tony rubbed the spot between his eyes hard, trying to physically push away the sudden migraine he could feel building, “no, okay? Just no.”

Tony didn’t care if Barnes wanted to face his accuser, try and make some crap apology, or what. There was no reason good enough or length of additional prison time long enough that would make Tony want to let Harry have a conversation with him.

Al Saud nodded and made to leave the room when Harry told him to wait. Harry looked at Tony and Tony could just see himself at Harry’s age, stubborn to the end.

Tony wondered if Howard or Maria ever suffered from chronic migraines. It was typically a genetic condition, one that managed to skip Harry so far.

Until Harry had his own kids one day that Tony kind of hoped gave him as much sass and sarcasm as Harry did Tony and Tony had his parents.

“I don’t care if Bucky wants to talk to me, I have things I want to say to him,” Harry said, perfectly earnestly. It was really well done, the twitch of the prosthetic, the big green eyes.

“You can write him a letter,” Pepper said decisively.

“Or I have one conversation with him and attempt to move on from this extremely traumatic experience,” Harry deadpanned. “I’d rather not be pen pals.”

Al Saud and Pepper looked at Tony, leaving the no-win decision in his hands. Either Tony denied his kid the chance to face Barnes on his terms or he gave in to Barnes’ ridiculous demands.

Eight months ago Tony might have made a different decision. Eight months ago Tony thought he was the expert in any situation and that he knew what was best for his kid.

But Tony was a different man after a crash-course in parenting and with all the other shit Harry had dealt with, Harry was a different person too. Gone were the defensive sneers and prickly wariness. Harry sat in the room and looked at Tony and was asking for one thing-

Not for documents to get to Russia, but for a chance to close the door on a part of his past.

Tony held Harry’s eyes as he nodded, “Okay.”

Harry didn’t smile, he was mature enough to see that it wasn’t a victory. It made Tony overflow with bittersweet pride; Harry had grown and matured so much that Tony felt he could see the type of man Harry would become. He’d be a better man by far than Tony ever was, Tony just wished he’d stay a child for as long as possible.

Chapter Text

February 9

Harry’s knee was jiggling repeatedly like it used to before he started his medicine. Instead of it being because of some extra energy Harry had though, it was pure nerves.

When Harry agreed to meet with Bucky, he didn’t know that he’d feel so anxious and ill over it. It was nice that Harry didn’t have to go to the prison that Bucky was sentenced to for the visit, but he wasn’t exactly comfortable in the office in MACUSA either.

Tony had wanted to join Harry, but Harry knew that he wouldn’t be able to say the things he planned if he had to say it in front of his dad. Pepper had stayed up late with Harry the night before… trying to help him put it all in words like Michael suggested Harry did.

It sounded so stupid to Harry, he regret even agreeing to it then. Harry knew all he had to do was tap the table with his wand and he could leave. It would be easy, Harry would be able to join Tony just outside the office he sat in and go home.

Peter would be there. Sirius would be there. Pepper would be there. Joey, Hedwig, and Tri-Paw’d would be there.

Harry stayed in his chair, jiggling his leg, until the door he watched opened with a click.

An auror in a professional black suit and dark sunglasses entered the room first. Harry watched as he waved his wand and then stepped to the side. Behind him came Bucky, dressed down in the navy jumpsuit Harry assumed prisoners wore and shimmering metallic handcuffs on his wrists.

Another auror followed behind Bucky and blocked the door they entered, but Harry only had eyes for Bucky. Bucky looked… not so crazy. There was a depth of emotion in his blue eyes that were locked on Harry’s, but whatever it was he felt it wasn’t madness.

Bucky sat across from Harry at the small table and they only looked at each other while Harry’s heart hammered and his leg bounced erratically.

The note in Harry’s pocket felt so ridiculous. There was nothing in those scribbled lines to describe what Harry felt.

Regret, that Bucky would be going to prison for something that Harry felt he had a large part in.

Relief, that someone had decided that Harry was a person worth receiving justice for.

Just those two contrasting emotions were causing a lot of sleepless nights for Harry since before the trial. It didn’t even count for the anger, hurt, disappointment, and fear that Harry could privately admit to having.

Bucky opened his mouth and Harry’s leg that no longer existed suddenly shocked his body with an electric bolt of pain and Harry twitched in his seat.

“I’m sorry,” Bucky said lowly, his eyes shimmering when Harry looked up at them again. “It don’t fix it, but I wanted you to know. That’s it, I just… I’m so damned sorry.”

Bucky started to stand up and Harry spoke up before he lost his nerve.

“You seem better,” Harry said in a rush. Bucky blinked and slowly sank back down in his seat. “I mean… you know who I am.”

“I don’t think I’ll ever forget ya,” Bucky said tonelessly. “Be hard to forget the kid whose life i ruined.”

Pepper told Harry not to ease any of Bucky’s guilt, but that wasn’t why Harry corrected him. Harry had to correct him or what would stop Harry from one day being Anderson and thinking his life ended when he lost a limb?

“You didn’t ruin my life,” Harry said. “You changed it, but it’s not ruined.”

Harry could fly, he could walk, if he was ever really drunk maybe he could dance again… probably badly. Harry didn’t lose his family or his friends, he lost a leg.

It sucked, but Harry had lost worse things before.

Harry coughed quietly and his eyes flicked up to the aurors that seemed uninterested before he pulled the things he wrote from his jacket pocket.

“I think that you only wanted to talk to me because of my leg,” Harry read, looking up occasionally at Bucky.

Harry saw how miserable Bucky had been in the courtroom and it hurt Harry to testify against him because Harry didn’t know that Bucky deserved to stay in prison for making bad decisions while his head was so messed up. Harry had made bad decisions before when he’d been the one with the depression that crushed his mind and wrecked havoc on his thoughts. Nobody had beaten Harry in the ground for it though.

Harry said as much the night before to Pepper. They were in the quidditch field together, enjoying the magical warmth and eternal sunshine the room provided. Harry’s pets ran wild while Harry struggled through penning down his thoughts.

Pepper painted her nails, doing a good job at pretending she wasn’t there to help Harry, and he finally caved and said that he’d been thinking.

“I jumped off a roof once,” Harry blurted out. “Everything was messed up in my head and I just jumped.”

“I remember,” Pepper said, not looking up from her sparkling blue toes.

“Right…” Harry struggled to word what he was thinking and he was grateful that Pepper, like Tony, always seemed endlessly patient when Harry needed time to form his thoughts.

“Nobody was mad at me,” Harry finally said. “I was sick—” that was what Michael said anyway “—and I did something stupid. Nobody was mad then.”

“As compared to now when people are angry with Barnes?” Pepper asked, accurately guessing why Harry brought that up.

“Exactly.”

Pepper hummed and Harry repaid her patience with his own while she finished her little toe. Pepper put the brush in the bottle and then stretched her legs out in the grass and tilted her face up to the sun.

“You only hurt yourself when you did that,” Pepper said. “You terrified me and your dad, but physically? You only hurt yourself.”

Harry’s thoughts on Bucky slowed and he blinked at Pepper.

“You and Dad weren’t together then,” Harry reminded Pepper, feeling suddenly bashful.

Pepper grinned over at Harry. “Do you think I didn’t start caring about you until your dad and I got together?”

Harry didn’t answer, he only shrugged shyly.

It was easy to accept Tony in Harry’s life, sort of. It actually hadn’t been easy really at all, but Tony was firmly there.

Tony was Harry’s biological father and he was his dad. James had been just as much Harry’s dad and Harry liked to think that maybe he’d be happy that the bloke he once… did what he did with… was there for Harry in a way James couldn’t be.

Pepper was… something. Pepper was family, but there were times - like then - that the line between family and Pepper’s role in it blurred.

Harry knew he was hurting himself with his fears, but there was nobody he knew that was close enough to his mum to know how she would feel about Harry’s thoughts when that line blurred in his mind.

They focused on Harry’s meeting with Bucky after that, but Harry scooted a little closer to Pepper and was grateful that Tony had good taste in partners.

The awkward semi-relationship he once had with Sirius notwithstanding.

Bucky didn’t interrupt Harry and so he continued reading the disjointed thoughts he prepared.

“I know you were sick but- but I know there were times where you knew what you were doing too,” Harry read with his muscles tensed and his eyes on the paper. “You knew I was Harry sometimes and you kept apologizing.”

“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”

“I think if my leg wasn’t amputated because of decisions we both made—” Harry glanced up then, checking to see that Bucky knew Harry didn’t solely blame him for his leg. Bucky’s eyes were clear of the madness he once had but they were filled with tears that made Harry uncomfortable. “—that maybe you wouldn’t actually regret what happened.

“I’m grateful you killed Voldemort and I’m relieved you took a plea so you won’t be in prison so long, but I wish we’d never met.”

It was probably the hardest thing Harry had ever done- not forgiving someone and trying to move past a bad history. It wasn’t that a large part of Harry didn’t think that Bucky had needed help more than he did punishment, it was just that Bucky’s illness shouldn’t have broken Harry’s bones and left him unable to sleep some nights.

 

Harry was actually attacked by his dad the second he left MACUSA’s office. By the way Tony’s hair was standing up all crooked, Harry would guess that he had been pulling on it the entire time Harry was out of his sight.

“You have problems,” Harry said with a roll of his eyes as Tony attached himself to Harry’s side.

Tony had his arm around Harry’s shoulders in a way that looked casual as they strolled out of the building. It didn’t feel casual, it felt like Tony had been as anxious and ill during Harry’s meeting as Harry was.

“What’s the move, kid?” Tony asked cheerfully when they were outside. “Therapy? Paintball? Go get in the builders way at the new house?”

“Uh…” Harry felt a rush of guilt suddenly. Ever since the first time Loki showed up at their place, Tony had been kind of clingy. And it wasn’t that Harry minded, a part of Harry actually liked that his dad wanted to be around Harry so much, but… but Harry and Peter had plans.

Plans that very much did not include Harry’s father.

Tony looked at Harry with his kind brown eyes and it made it a hundred times worse to tell him about those plans.

“Peter and I are going on a double date with Gwen and her girlfriend,” Harry explained guiltily. “I asked Pepper if it was okay…”

Technically, Harry asked Pepper if she could do something with Tony so that Harry didn’t feel so terrible for abandoning him. Harry really, really, wanted to go out with his friends but he didn’t want his dad to be upset either.

“Oh.” Tony didn’t look disappointed, maybe just a little surprised. “Cool, no worries. Am I dropping you off at Petey’s?”

Harry let out a quiet sigh of relief and shook his head.

“He’s picking me up,” Harry explained. Gwen had offered to just drive Harry with her after she finished work, but Harry still had ‘a thing’ about cars.

Peter never seemed to mind if Harry abruptly decided they had to find alternative methods of transportation when they made plans. It was embarrassing and Harry would rather not have anyone else see him panic over a vehicle.

Harry never struggled when he drove though, which Tony let him do when they left MACUSA. It was awkward to position his left leg in the car, but Pepper said that when Harry had a car of his own that adjustments could be made.

“What’s on the agenda for the LGBTQ date night?” Tony asked cheerfully when Harry pulled off the curb they were parked on.

“A comedy club,” Harry said with a crooked grin. Harry had no idea what that was, but Gwen bought tickets for them and Harry was excited to find out. “After that we’re going to dinner at some posh place Gwen’s trying to impress Brittany with.”

“That sounds fun,” Tony said. “Oh, by the way, what did you and Barnes talk about?”

Harry had been waiting for that. Tony was a lot of things, happy to be left out of conversations was not one of them. While Harry didn’t want Tony present while he talked, he didn’t mind giving him a repeat of the conversation.

“He said he was sorry—” Tony snorted and Harry ignored it “—I told him… I told him that I’m glad he’s better and I wish we never met.”

Harry clenched his jaw to the side when tears prickled at his eyes. It had been a cruel thing to say, but it was still true. Harry knew his life wasn’t ruined anymore than the lives of his mates at the VA were ruined, but Bucky had still somehow managed to up the graveyard in ‘experiences that caused nightmares and anxiety’.

“I knew I should have said no!” Tony threw his hands up and Harry glanced at him curiously before looking back at the highway they were on.

“I was going to say no but then I thought about how much you’ve matured and I thought maybe you knew what was best for you. And now you’re upset and I’m honestly never going to tell you ‘yes’ about anything ever again. Damn your mom’s puppy eyes- no, wait, I didn’t mean that.”

Harry let out a startled and genuine laugh at Tony’s heated rant.

“Dad, I’m fine,” he assured him. He was a little upset over his mixed feelings, but Harry was glad he had the chance to see that Bucky was healed and Harry got to say his piece.

“And… thanks,” Harry added, carefully accelerating past a yellow light. “I didn’t know you didn’t want me to do it, so… so I appreciate it.

“But also you already said yes to me leaving tonight so no taking it back now.”

 

Tony didn’t take it back and so Harry took a thorough shower when they made it back home. They would only be in the tower for another month, their house was supposed to be finished by Spring Break and Harry honestly couldn’t wait.

Harry had been hesitant at first about moving, until Tony and Sirius showed him all the ‘tweaks’ they made to the standard looking house. Harry liked that the entire underground floor of the house (he refused to call it a basement because it made him think of cupboards too much) was set up like an apartment just for Harry. There would be a little kitchenette setup, a living room with a sofa and telly, and an area that Pepper insisted Harry have with a washing machine and dryer.

The underground floor also had three rooms and a ‘Harry-capable’ bathroom. Harry’s bedroom was the largest room, then a guest bedroom for if Harry had any friends stay over (Harry wasn’t sure how he’d fit all the Weasley’s and Hermione in one room that summer, but he’d figure it out). The best room was the quidditch field room that Sirius would recreate for Harry and his pets. It would give Joey and Tri-Paw’d a place to run and Hedwig a place to fly even when it was cold out. There was an elevator that went from Harry’s floor to the other two floors, but they didn’t bother Harry much since the only people inside the house would be his family.

It was almost set up as if Tony thought Harry would never move out… which Harry probably wouldn’t.

Especially since Harry had high hopes for siblings to fill the three extra bedrooms on the second floor of the house. He thought Sirius would take a room at first until he saw that Sirius was getting his own house on the large property.

Harry had a lot of good memories within the tower, but he sort of thought that the house they were moving to would be something magical for all of them.

 

When Peter arrived, Harry was ready to go on their double date. Pepper and Tony were curled up sweetly on the sofa - it actually wasn’t that sweet because they were smacking the hell out of each other as they fought over the remote.

“Er… bye then,” Harry said, pausing for a moment to watch them wrestle like children.

Pepper had one of her hands over Tony’s face while her other hand held the remote up in the air, out of his reach, and she turned to grin at Harry.

“Have fun,” she said. “We’ll be here watching Christian Grey get his Anna.”

“No we aren’t!” Tony lunged and knocked the remote from Pepper’s hand, knocking it to the floor. “That’s some chick flick.” He winked at Harry before he began smacking at Peppers legs to get the remote first. “Have fun, we’ll be here watching Little Nicky.”

Harry hummed and then shook his head at their play fight as he made his way to the lift. When Harry stepped on it, he heard Pepper sighed.

“Tony, you have no idea what Fifty Shades of Grey is, do you?”

“I know it sounds like some French producer who thinks he’s the edgiest bastard to ever live.”

Huh.

For the first time ever, Harry knew something that Tony didn’t.

Harry also knew that he’d probably ask to stay with Peter and his aunt that night since Pepper would likely win the war over the remote and Harry very much didn’t want to return home on a night when he just knew that his parents would be having sex.

 

Peter was in a good mood when he picked Harry up. He had the radio in his car playing at full blast with the playlist they shared that had all their favorite songs. Harry had forced himself in the car and felt clammy at first, but it eased when Peter started signing.

“Hey.” Harry blinked at his boyfriend and maybe it was just rehashing last winter because of Bucky’s trial or maybe it was the way that Peter always looked ridiculous when he sang with his entire chest, but…

“I love you,” Harry told him after Peter turned down the radio for a moment to hear what Harry had to say. Harry shrugged and turned it right back up to full blast.

He just thought Peter should know that.

“Hey, Bright Eyes.” Peter beat Harry out of the car as usual - it was unfair that Peter had super spider powers. Harry met a clan of acromantula before and all he got were nervous ticks when he saw spiders.

Peter was a sap though, he liked knowing he could beat Harry out of the car and open the door for him. Peter offered Harry his hand with a grin.

“I love you,” Peter said as Harry stood up. He moved his arm around Harry’s shoulders and led him toward where Gwen and Brittany waited. “I just thought you should know.”

Harry rolled his eyes, but he grinned too.

 

It was strangely fun having a double date with Gwen and Brittany. Brittany’s cousin’s fiancé opened the club they went to and so they got a table just beside the stage where the comedian went on at.

Harry found a new career goal when he realized that a muggle comedian wasn’t a magician, as he’d been thinking it was. It was just some bloke who told stories and made fun of members in the crowd. They weren’t knock-knock jokes or anything daft, just… a lot of sarcasm that was twisted in a way to make everyone laugh.

Harry could do that.

 

Harry changed his mind when the comic made a joke about the Avengers adding a wizard to their team (“I’ve personally always found Hawk-Eyes ass to be a thing of magic”) and Harry’s friends’ looks and laughter brought him to attention. Then there were a lot of jokes about Tony Stark and Harry ‘hopping along in his footsteps with his two girlfriends’.

 

“Humiliating,” Harry laughed when the show ended. “If I heard one more joke about my dad’s sex life I was going to be sick.”

“I thought his comment about the Avenger Orgies was both pithy and politically charged.”

The four teens were walking to their two cars together and they all stopped to look at Brittany. Brittany curled her dark-purple painted lips to the side in a smirk and rolled her eyes.

“Kidding,” she drawled.

Harry laughed and nodded at her. “See? That was funny.”

They stood around in the parking lot and talked for a bit, nothing of consequence. Brittany talked about a new art exhibit she wanted to see they opened on Valentine’s Day and Gwen was quick to say they would go.

Harry was just as quick to say that he and Peter already had plans when the girls looked at them. They didn’t, but if they did it wouldn’t include a ‘modernist view of ancient wars’.

Whatever the hell that meant.

“What’s our super secret and incredibly romantic Valentine’s Day plans, Bright Eyes?” Peter asked when they left to head toward his house.

Neither his aunt or Harry’s dad cared if Harry stayed over. Tony told Harry to wear a condom so he didn’t have spider-babies and Peter’s aunt said they couldn’t sleep in the same bed.

Since neither Harry or Peter had pushed to do much more than some heavy snogging and light touching (Harry wasn’t sure how he felt about being undressed in front of Peter with his stump exposed), they planned to ignore both bits of instruction.

“Oh. Er…” Harry tried to think of something that they could do next weekend for the ridiculous holiday and came up blank. “It’s a surprise,” Harry said finally. “Oi, I love this song.”

Peter grinned and obligingly turned the radio up and Harry spent the rest of the night trying to think of what they could do for Valentine’s Day.

 

‘Tell Professor Dumbledore that it’s your fault Professor Snape is missing’ was Hermione’s reply to Harry’s frantic text.

Do something special was Ginny’s rubbish advice.

Have sex was Ron’s equally rubbish advice.

The twins sent Harry websites for… horribly embarrassing porn websites after Ron apparently told his brothers about Harry’s dilemma. As payback for the horrifying images they exposed Harry to, he sent the video of them fainting to Pietro, who talked a lot about Fred when Harry was around him.

After that, Fred sent Harry a real suggestion that he take Peter to dinner and ‘somewhere bloody romantic’ but that was daft.

Luna suggested Harry take Peter for a romantic lakeside picnic, which Harry forwarded to Ginny.

Greene, who was dating a pretty nurse, told Harry to think about what brought Harry and Peter together and incorporate that in their plans…

Harry wasn’t sure that alcohol, skateboarding, and a prosthetic leg would make for a very good date. It would certainly be unforgettable, but Harry wasn’t keen on breaking his good leg.

When Harry finally broke down and asked his parents what he should do, the night before Valentine’s Day, Tony looked startled.

“That’s like weeks away, kid,” he said with a wave of his fork. “You’ve got plenty of time to think of something perfectly adorkable for your geek.”

“Tony.” Pepper stared deadpan at Tony and lifted a strawberry-blonde brow at him. “It’s tomorrow.”

“No it’s…” Tony scratched his chin and looked momentarily horrified. “Shit.”

“I was stuck with him,” Harry said drily when he and Pepper watched Tony actually run from the dining table to get to the staircase. “You chose him.”

“I waited a long time for him to grow up,” Pepper said fondly. “He’s bad with dates, but I think that’s a side effect of being irritatingly brilliant.”

“If you saaaay so.”

Harry just hoped that Tony would do something special for Pepper. Sirius and Strange had plans, Harry and Peter would have plans if Harry could come up with something. He’d hate for the upcoming wedding to be ruined because Tony was too busy thinking of a million other things to remember Pepper.

“I do,” Pepper said bossily. She pulled her phone from her blazer pocket and began tapping away at the screen. “What’s Peter’s favorite band?” she asked.

That was easy, it was the same as Harry’s.

“Papa Roach,” Harry said.

Pepper hummed and continued tapping away at her phone while Harry ate his chicken and waited for her to save his arse.

If Harry had fessed up at the start that he only said they had plans because he didn’t want to go to an art show then Peter might have laughed. Instead, Harry carried the lie all week and internally groaned when Peter loudly told Flash that Harry couldn’t meet up with him to work out on the fourteenth because they had plans.

Harry hated Valentine’s Day.

“Done!” Pepper put her phone away just as Harry’s chirped in his pocket. Harry pulled it out and tried to interpret the information Pepper sent.

“‘The Wilma presents Papa Roach’?” Harry read aloud, squinting at his phone screen. “What?”

“You and Peter can take your dad’s jet, go to Montana in the morning, check out the sights and then go see Papa Roach tomorrow night,” Pepper said casually. “I heard they’re playing for an excellent cause.”

Harry’s jaw dropped both at the absolutely perfect plans and the speed of which Pepper just made it all happen.

“Dad won’t want me to be gone overnight,” Harry hedged. Staying with Peter was one thing, staying in a different state was another.

Tony was clingy.

Pepper smiled at Harry and it was a smile like Mrs. Weasley used to give him when he’d stay at her house. It was the kind of smile that made Harry feel wistful and bashful all at once.

“He will be worried and he will be fine when he sees that you’re not going to get hurt every time you walk out of his sight,” Pepper said. Harry liked that she didn’t belittle Tony’s anxieties, it was just further proof that they were sort of perfect for each other.

“You’re the best,” Harry decided. He got up and quickly moved his dishes to the sink before giving Pepper an awkward one-armed hug. Harry needed to call Peter, pack clothes, get his medicine if he was going to be gone the next night. He’d need to make sure all three animals had plenty of food and water, everyone else always forgot that Hedwig liked the bacon flavored dog treats.

“Thanks, Mum, love you,” Harry called absently as he left the room almost as quickly as Tony did to go get ready for the impromptu getaway.

 

As soon as Harry was in his room, Pepper glanced upward to spot one of Tony’s many hidden security cameras.

“Jarvis, be sure to send the last sixty seconds of footage to my email,” she said.

“Yes, ma’am.”

 

In the end, Harry and Peter had to take Happy with them. It was reasonable enough, Tony said that he was too well-known of a person to not give Harry protection when he was alone.

Harry didn’t know why Tony was worried, he had taser-toes and portals, what else did he need?

Chapter Text

February 14

When Sirius was eighteen, he had a whole Valentine’s Day plot. Sirius and James spent months working on it together.

James was going to take Lily on a boat ride, fill the boat with a mixture of multi-colored roses, and profess his undying love to her. Sirius assumed they would also shag after James proposed- because that was just the kind of sap that James was -but Sirius dutifully helped James ensure he had champagne and flowers and a box of Lily’s favorite chocolates ready.

Sirius planned to give Remus his favorite leather jacket, the one that David Bowie signed, and take him for a sunset ride on his motorcycle. They would snuggle close on the bike, ending at the overlook that showed them the London lights. Sirius assumed that they would shag and he would propose after and the four best friends would have a double wedding and all live happily ever after.

James proposed and Lily called him an impulsive idiot before accepting.

Sirius asked Remus to be his for the rest of their lives and planned to give him the simple silver band that he selected for him.

Remus also called Sirius an impulsive idiot before gently saying they were too young to get married yet. Sirius had been hurt, but Remus said ‘not yet’, not ‘never’ and so Sirius hid his hurt and just chalked it up to a really bloody terrible Valentine’s Day.

 

“Moony?” Sirius rolled over on the blanket they’d been using to shag on. Sirius smiled at the man he’d loved for years and knew then that he’d love for an eternity.

Remus smiled at him- it was Sirius’ favorite smile. It was the sweet smile of someone who thought Sirius was the prize instead of the winner.

“Yeah?”

Sirius traced a particularly deep scar on Remus’ chest and tried to keep his courage up.

“Do you think about the future a lot?” Sirius asked quietly.

“There’s a war, Pads. I think all of us are thinking about the future.”

Sirius swallowed and nodded, that was true.

And that was why Sirius couldn’t chicken out.

“Remus John Lupin.” Sirius had Remus’ ring in his jacket pocket and would summon it as soon as Remus said yes. “Will you marry me?” he asked simply.

Remus said no and - like so many intangible things - the ring Sirius bought was lost while he was in Azkaban.

 

Sirius thought about the worst Valentine’s Day he ever had every year after that.

And Stephen managed to top it seventeen years later.

 

“I already hate this,” Sirius breathed when Stephen pulled him through a portal and Sirius recognized where they were.

Even with the snow that covered all the tombstones, making them unrecognizable lumps of white, Sirius’ eyes moved automatically to where his best friends were buried.

“Why?” Sirius asked in a miserable whisper. Sirius and Stephen didn’t hold hands, they weren’t children, but Stephen had his arm around Sirius’ waist and squeezed it reassuringly.

“Trust me,” he said with his usual arrogance. “Come see.”

Sirius trudged through the snow beside Stephen and noticed immediately that there was a new addition to the left of James and Lily’s shared tombstone, one that knocked the air from Sirius’ lungs.

Regulus Arcturus Black

Below the blip of life-dates that Reggie lived was a quote, one that had Sirius sobbing like a baby.

‘How important it is for us to recognize and celebrate our heroes.’

“I didn’t think that your brother deserved to spend eternity in a lake,” Stephen said, just loudly enough to be heard over Sirius’ heartbroken cries.

It was an old ache to have lost his baby brother, Sirius lost him before he’d even died. But seeing a grave and knowing that Reggie’s body was six feet beneath it killed Sirius.

And while it killed him, there was a sense of closure stitching the wound that Sirius would always have. It was a jagged scar on Sirius’ heart, one shaped like regret and remorse. It was the same length as the hyphen between the day Reggie was born and the day he died.

That hyphen could never capture what truly happened between those two dates and at the same time it was a representation of how short a life Regulus lived.

Stephen kept Sirius from falling in the snow on the ground while Sirius looked at the terrible and beautiful gift Stephen gave him. Sirius wanted to be indignant that Stephen went and retrieved Regulus’ body and chose a resting place without him, but Sirius knew that as brave as he liked to imagine himself as, he would have been too cowardly to enter the cave where Regulus died.

How Regulus committed the bravest act of any war on his own was something Sirius would admire until the end of his life.

 

Which, apparently, approached quickly.

 

“We have one more stop,” Stephen said thickly when the sun began to set and Sirius had cried the end of his tears.

“The Soul Stone?” Sirius asked, blinking away the wetness that cling to his lashes.

Stephen told Tony that there was a stone he could get that would remove the horcrux from Harry. Loki had given Stephen a sharp look when all Stephen asked Tony for was time, but their time was at an end.

Stephen swore that the horcrux would be gone by mid-February and Tony swore if it wasn’t that he would take Harry and leave.

It was technically mid-February the next day and Sirius didn’t doubt that Tony would run with Harry if they waited anymore.

“Yeah.” Stephen stared down in Sirius’ eyes and Sirius stared back steadily, thanking him with just a look.

Stephen made a choked noise before he nodded and opened a portal with his free hand, his eyes never looking away from Sirius.

 

“Welcome to… Vormir.”

Sirius looked around the other-worldly place and felt the wind whipping his hair wildly. It looked like pictures he’d seen of the planet Mars- all red rock and deep cliffs everywhere. It felt cold, the kind of ominous cold that reminded Sirius of the dementors…

“Come,” Stephen said. He linked his hand with Sirius’ and pulled him along a path. Sirius smiled lightly, amused that he had just earlier thought about how they weren’t a ‘holding hands’ type of couple. “Our destination is a bit further, love.”

Sirius’ smile became slightly more genuine. It always left him feeling soft when Stephen called him ‘love’. It was such a common term where Sirius grew up, but it felt entirely different when Stephen said it.

The two of them walked hand-in-hand along the path, rocks skirting from their steps and crashing down the cliff. Sirius leaned his head over some, looking down and seeing nothing aside from a black void at the bottom. It made him shiver, imagining Regulus’ last moments… diving in a black body of water, never to resurface…

Sirius pulled his head back, not wanting to think of his brother while he was trying to save his godson.

Stephen led them around the cliff until they found a part where the cliff jutted out in a platform.

“Out here, love.”

Sirius felt the wind tearing in him, shaking his body, when he stepped out on the platform with Stephen.

“What are we doing here?” Sirius asked Stephen, having to shout over the wind.

“You have to get the soul stone to remove the horcrux from Harry,” Stephen called to him. He waved his hand out, showing Sirius the vast expanse of black space the seemed to surround them at the bottom of the cliff.

“How do we get it?” Sirius asked, furrowing his brow. “Summon it? Make a portal?”

“No.” Stephen reached up to unclasp his cape and Sirius sighed fondly when he wrapped the sentient cape around Sirius, probably thinking he was cold.

“How do we get it then?” Sirius asked him. Sirius swallowed when he looked over the platform they shared. The void seemed endless, empty… cold.

“Once you have the Soul Stone, there’s a ritual to use it to destroy a horcrux without the host,” Stephen told him, ignoring Sirius’ question. “I left it on your bed.”

“How do we get the bloody thing?” Sirius asked again. “Rituals don’t do us any good if we don’t have the stone.”

Stephen wrapped his arm around Sirius’ waist and pulled him close.

“There’s a place in your Ministry, where they study the exact matter that makes up the void around us.” Stephen didn’t have to shout when Sirius was pressed against him. “Vormir is the Dominion of Death, love. The Soul Stone rests here because this is where all souls eventually pass.”

Sirius shivered, the now sinister-feeling cold wind having nothing to do with his reaction.

“The Stone requires a sacrifice,” Stephen said. “To understand the power and responsibility that comes with wielding the stone, it requires a heavy sacrifice before it will reveal itself to an owner.”

Sirius felt dread settle low and heavy in his gut.

A sacrifice on the Dominion of Death for a stone that controlled souls… it didn’t take a genius to figure out what sort of sacrifice was needed.

It would be a life for a life then- Sirius’ for Harry.

And Harry… Harry would hate it.

Harry hadn’t wanted Sirius to risk his life for him, he’d begged Sirius to be a coward, stay safe. Staying safe wasn’t in Sirius’ personality though and neither was letting his godson die if he could prevent it.

Sirius would break Harry’s heart, but he would finally be joining the list of people a thousand times better than him.

James… standing on his feet and facing down Voldemort to give his wife and son a fighting chance.

Lily… begging not for her life, but Harry’s. She was content to die if it meant Harry would live.

Regulus… sacrificing himself in a lake of inferi to try and destroy the being he’d once sworn to follow.

And then Sirius… breaking Harry’s heart, but saving his life in the end.

“I understand,” Sirius said. His voice didn’t shake, he wasn’t scared. If Sirius could choose a death, dying for the boy who meant more than life itself was a good way to go. He’d see James soon, tell him all about their boy. Maybe he’d see Regulus too, hit his knees and beg for forgiveness for all the nasty things he’d said.

“Sirius Black.” Stephen cupped Sirius’ face with his hand and raised it so Sirius was caught in his gaze. “Do you love me?”

Sirius’ nose burned with tears that he would not shed. With only moments left of his life, Sirius didn’t want to waste them on crying.

They didn’t say the words to each other, they didn’t need to. Sirius knew that Stephen loved him - loved him in an all-encompassing way that scared Sirius on occasion. Stephen knew Sirius loved him, loved him the best that he was capable of.

Sirius had told people that he loved them before, but they were words he tended to blurt out after sex. The first time Sirius said it to Stephen had been an utterly normal moment…

 

Sirius sat at the table in his flat, playing cards with the team. Sirius was losing, badly, and Natasha was pissing him off with her smugness. Stephen wasn’t even there yet, they just couldn’t wait for him to get done with whatever he was doing with Wong to show up.

It was just after Clint declared that he was ‘all in’ that Sirius saw the first sign of Stephen’s imminent arrival.

Just behind Clint’s shoulder, completely silently, a portal opened. Sirius sat across from Clint, beside Pietro, and pretended not to look at the mirror that appeared in the portal. It showed Sirius Clint’s cards perfectly and Sirius went ahead and folded before he lost his arse.

For the next thirty minutes, Stephen did that. Only Sirius and Pietro noticed the portals and Sirius began making up for his earlier losses. By the time Stephen actually stepped through a portal, scaring the hell out of Bruce, Sirius was winning by over five hundred.

Sirius took in Stephen’s self-satisfied smirk, the cheeky way he asked Clint how it was going, and just everything that made Stephen who he was.

And Sirius knew then that he was fucked because what was meant to be a fun fling had turned to something much more real.

 

“I do,” Sirius said. He cupped Stephen’s face in return and gave him the last gift he could, a smile and his truth instead of the golden band hidden in his jeans pocket. “You’re an arrogant, pigheaded toerag and I love you so damn much, Stephen. I’m- I’m sorry we won’t get forever.”

Stephen bent his head down and tilted Sirius’ face with his hand. The two of them kissed with a fervor from the knowledge that it would be their last kiss. Sirius tried to memorize the feeling of Stephen’s lips on his own, the feeling of his fingers curled in his hair and pulling his enough to open Sirius’ mouth.

Sirius couldn’t help but carefully pull the ring from his pocket and slip it in Stephen’s. It would be selfish to propose seconds before he died, but Sirius couldn’t bear to not leave Stephen with the token of the future Sirius would only sacrifice for Harry.

When they broke apart, Stephen only moving his face centimeters from Sirius’, Sirius saw a tear glistening in the corner of Stephen’s eye.

“We were as inevitable as this moment was,” Stephen whispered roughly. “I love you more than anything, Sirius. In all the timelines, in every universe, my soul will long for yours.”

Sirius had to swallow down the lump in his throat at Stephen’s heartbreaking and genuine sounding speech.

“Nobody’s ever loved me like you,” Sirius told him. “The only person I love above you is Harry.”

Stephen smiled sadly. “I know,” he whispered. He tilted his head to Sirius’ and Sirius felt his shoulders shake with repressed sobs at the bittersweet moment.

“That’s why I have to do this.”

With a single beat of Sirius’ heart, Stephen pulled his Eye of Agamotto from around his neck, lacing it over Sirius’ while they had their foreheads still connected.

“We were inevitable, love.”

Sirius felt a scream rip from his throat when Stephen pushed him closer to the safety of the path and threw himself off the cliff with his arms spread wide.

“NO! STEPHEN!!”

It seemed to take Stephen an age to fall. His body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backward through the void. There was a look of soft acceptance on Stephen’s handsome face and Sirius couldn’t see his hand but knew he must have circled his finger in a familiar twirl when a portal opened beside Sirius.

Sirius hit his knees on the edge of the platform and screamed again as Stephen disappeared into the void. The wind picked up roughly, nearly taking Sirius after his lover, and then fell back into place.

An orange stone flew from the void that took Stephen, his sacrifice accepted, and Sirius caught it automatically when it flew toward him. If it wasn’t for Harry, Sirius might not have bothered. As soon as his fingers curled around the stone, Stephen’s Cloak of Levitation dragged Sirius from the edge toward the portal that waited.

Stephen couldn’t be gone, he couldn’t. Stephen had only just fallen through the void, he would reappear from the void any second…

But Stephen did not reappear.

“STEPHEN!” Sirius yelled, “STEPHEN!”

Sirius’ breath was coming in searing gasps. Stephen must be just hidden in the void, he, Sirius, could pull him back out again…

“ACCIO STEPHEN!” Sirius yelled, pulling his wand with the hand that didn’t hold the stone. Sirius tried getting closer to the edge of the platform, but the cloak continued pulling Sirius by the throat, forcing him away.

“Stop!” Sirius cried, struggling against the cape. “We can get him, save him! He’s just in the void!

“ACCIO STEPHEN STRANGE! ACCIO STEPHEN STRANGE!”

Sirius struggled hard and viciously, but the cape would not let go.

“STEPHEN! NO! ACCIO STEPHEN!”

With a final shout that ripped his throat, the cape dragged Sirius through the portal, taking him from Stephen forever.

 

Sirius’ feet hit solid ground and his knees buckled. He looked around blankly and saw that he had arrived in his own bedroom.

As if his body were acting without his control, Sirius stood up and moved to his bed where he saw two manilla envelopes laid out on his pillow. One was for ‘Harry Stark’ and the other said ‘Sirius Black’ in a familiar black script.

    I’ve seen you read this, my love.

Sirius wanted to smile at Stephen’s arrogance that followed him clear to his death, but he couldn’t, not then.

    I’ve seen you cry, I’ve seen you mourn, and I’ve seen you live.
    I have seen you live and seen you love again. I’ve seen you laugh and that laugh is worth every ounce of the pain I feel at leaving you behind.
    You are one half of my soul and I know that going on without me will be the hardest thing you will have to do, but I know you will do it for Harry.
    The ritual to remove the horcrux from his mind is in your packet, it’s a simple chant that uses the power of the Soul Stone to work. There’s no risk to you, love. You’ll know it worked when the orange light fades. I’ve left Harry information as well- you’ll need to stay by his side to make sure he follows it.
    Harry the next Sorcerer Supreme, the greatest one to exist in your time. When he’s ready, Wong will be there to guide him.
    I don’t know what comes next for me, and I know you’ll smile eventually to read me admitting that, but I do know that every molecule that makes me who I am will weep for losing the love we had.
    I’ll keep your ring, you keep my heart.
    Until we see each other again,
    -Stephen

Sirius read the letter until his mind memorized every single letter. Sirius read the letter until he had to shove his fist in his mouth to keep from screaming in the injustice of it all.

Stephen had done to Sirius what Sirius had nearly done to Harry… and Sirius was in too much agony to even picture Harry having to be the one to read the goodbye letter.

 

Harry would live.

But Sirius wished that he had been the one to jump off the cliff, for surely he was already dead.

Chapter Text

March 20

“Hey, hey, be gentle with that!” Tony cried. “It’s an antique!”

“It’s garbage,” Clint scoffed. He turned his body sideways to fit himself and Tony’s favorite charred chair in the world through the front door. “Where do you want it?”

“Upstairs, my room,” Tony said, his attention already on where Natasha was looking at Tony’s motherboards with a little too much interest.

“Aht! Bad psycho!” Tony yelled at her. “No touchy my tech with your sticky little spy fingers!”

Natasha rolled her eyes at the nickname Tony’s kid gave her that stuck around but she also scooped up Tony’s equipment gently.

“Lab is in the back half of the garage,” Tony told her. “Don’t break anything!”

“If you were worried about us breaking things then perhaps you would have hired actual movers.” Pietro, who was mostly showing off as he ran inside with box after box after box, scoffed with good-natured intent.

“I did hire movers,” Tony said. “I’m paying you, right?”

Natasha, Clint, Pietro, and Bruce all answered as one, “No.”

“No?” Tony stroked his chin thoughtfully before snapping his fingers and grinning. “No, that’s right. I’m housing you, which is a hell of a lot more expensive than paying you would be.”

The others complained playfully and Tony resumed bossing them around while they helped him finally get moved. The house was perfect, it was everything Tony dreamed it would be.

Pepper was already inside, hard at work arranging the furniture just how she liked it. Harry was inside somewhere too with his geek. Tony saw Peter arrive an hour or so ago with two cans of paint and kept his lips zipped when the boys promptly disappeared.

Tony told Harry that he would have his rooms painted any colors that Harry wanted, but nooo, Harry wanted to exhaust himself by doing his own painting.

Sirius was also around somewhere… Tony assumed that Sirius was hiding away in his house off on the corner of the property until he saw a black dog lying beneath the shade of a tree. Even as a dog, Sirius was breaking Tony’s heart with his big sad eyes and general lack of cheer. Even the red cape that covered Sirius seemed sad with its drooping edges.

Tony wished he could do something for Sirius, but there was just nothing to do. Sirius had been miserable for the last month and Tony doubted that he’d ever forget the way Sirius broke down at Stephen Strange’s memorial service.

Everyone tried to be there for Sirius, the team really fell together and closed in ranks, but Sirius seemed to be carrying all his grief alone. It was even harder since everyone knew that Tony was so damned relieved that it had been Stephen instead of Sirius who took a nosedive off a cliff. Tony knew Sirius would have too… Sirius would do anything for Harry, even making the sacrifice play. Tony couldn’t imagine Harry’s heartache if Sirius pulled a stunt like that when they both knew it was one of Harry’s worst fears.

Even with the soul piece finally gone from Harry’s head, the kid would have rather died than lose his godfather. Harry had been devastated enough to lose the man that had been a mentor to him, Tony thought it was a wound only balmed by knowing it had been either Sirius or Stephen. And Tony would rather die himself than lose Sirius or Harry.

If it made Sirius feel better to hide away as a dog, minimize how much he has to talk with anyone, then so be it.

Pietro could move Sirius’ stuff for him.

 

Tony bossed his friends around for a while before Happy called him with an ETA on when Tony’s collection of motorcycles and cars would be delivered that day. Tony kept half a dozen cars at the Tower for his friends who still lived there to use, but he took his favorites home with him.

Home.

It was a simple word that made Tony giddy every time he thought it.

Tony had a house he once shared with his parents. Tony had a dorm in college he started with Rhodey. Tony had a house he lived in alone. Tony had a tower he filled with his friends.

Tony had never truly had a home, but that’s what their new place was.

It was a home that Tony would share with his soon-to-be wife, his son, and as many kids as Pepper would give him. They were going to be so damn happy there, Tony just knew it.

It was when Tony confessed his super sappy feelings about the new house to Pepper that she decided they would spend spring break moving instead of doing it over the summer as originally planned. Tony wanted to take Harry to see Aruba, but Harry said it hadn’t been a good time for him to go on a vacation anyway.

Apparently being the Sorcerer Supreme came with a middle-aged Asian man who summoned Harry at odd hours with even odder requests.

 

Tony was whistling when he found Pepper in her office on the main floor of the house. Tony grabbed her around the waist and pressed a kiss to the side of her neck.

“I’m sweaty,” Pepper complained even as she tilted her head to allow Tony to cover her skin with kisses.

“Mmm, the sweat of a hard-working woman,” Tony murmured. He licked a stripe up Pepper’s neck just to hear her squeal. “I like it.”

Pepper turned in Tony’s arms so he could see the dirt smudged on her cheek and the strands of her hair that fell from her bun.

“You’re not sweaty at all,” she said accusingly. “Have you moved anything?”

“Have I…?” Tony feigned hurt. “Miss Potts, I moved all the clothes, if you recall.”

“You had your son drop all the clothes through a portal if you recall,” Pepper reminded Tony sarcastically. “You haven’t touched a single box.”

That was entirely true. It was a close save though, Harry thought he was going to be responsible for moving his own belongings that morning and he tried to drop them all through a portal. Tony wasn’t quick enough to save Harry’s desk, but he did save the rest of the furniture and other breakable belongings.

“Delegation is hard work,” Tony told her seriously. “You’ll need to take some lessons from me, Pep. You can’t run our company, run our family, and be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen.”

“Then I delegate you to be pregnant,” Pepper said. She kissed Tony entirely too briefly before pushing him away. “Go see what Harry’s up to.”

“Ma’am, yes, ma’am!” Tony saluted Pepper with a wink. “If you change your mind about those lessons, let me know. I think I can find my naughty teacher outfit somewhere.”

With Pepper’s laugh following Tony to the hallway, he whistled his way down to Harry’s floor of the house. The elevator was a little too quiet without Jarvis installed yet, but Tony amused himself by looking at the red droplets of what was either blood or paint already staining the floor.

Tony was already guessing paint and it was confirmed as soon as the elevator doors opened and Tony saw Harry’s floor. The floor plan itself was set up as a mimicry of their place in the tower, Tony wanted it to be familiar and accessible enough for Harry that he never got any crazy ideas about moving out, but the color was entirely Harry.

“This is a lot of red,” Tony whistled as he looked around. It seemed as if Peter had done Harry a favor by moving the furniture into one tarp-covered lump in the center of the floor, but neither of the teenagers were safe from the paint everything else was covered in.

Harry turned and gave Tony a guilty smile when he realized they had been caught - literally - red-handed. There was a lightness in Harry’s body that Tony liked to see. Even with the Eye of Agamotto dangling off Harry’s neck, with a silver dog tag attached to the same necklace, Harry looked more light and free than he had in a long time.

“Peter said he’d clean everything,” Harry swore.

“Hey!” Peter flicked his paintbrush at Harry, explaining why everything was a wreck. “I did not!”

“I’ve only got one leg, prat!”

“Better hop to it then, Bright Eyes.”

Tony could spend an eternity just listening to the easy banter that Harry delivered with a grin. Everything was so different than it had been when father and son were first introduced.

Though… Tony sighed when his phone rang and he recognized his VP of Developments… some things never changed.

“Dinner party at five,” Tony reminded the two of them before answering his phone and walking away. “Mark, what can I do for you?”

Mark hesitantly described a glitch that the handicapped accessible version of the StarkCar’s were experiencing and Tony helped troubleshoot it while he wandered aimlessly around his home.

Damn. Tony would never get sick of using that word.

 

By a quarter after five that evening, the Stark home was mostly put together and overflowing with people. Tony’s friends were mingling with Harry’s friends from the VA. There were teenagers on the back porch that everyone pretended not to notice sharing a flask. Tony’s favorite intern was wandering around, interrogating guests under the guise of being friendly, and Peter was capturing every moment on his camera for Harry.

Sirius sat in the living room with Thor, listening to stories about Asgard with a vacant look in his eyes. Rhodey was in there as well, telling some story to Private First Class Booker that had the young woman laughing so hard she had to oh so casually hold on to Rhodey’s shoulder to stay upright.

Tony winked at Rhodey when he caught his eye and then left to go check on the other guests.

And then he paused and turned around to stare at Sirius with his jaw open.

“You’ve got to be kidding me!” Tony cried as it sank in his brain what he was looking at. “What the hell?”

Sirius and Thor both turned to look at Tony and Tony flapped an incredulous hand toward Sirius.

“I’m calling bullshit,” Tony declared.

Because what didn’t even register in Tony’s brain at first glance toward Sirius sure as hell did on the second glance. Sirius sat on the couch, a drink in one hand and Thor’s hammer swinging idly in his other hand.

The same damn hammer that Tony never managed to lift even an inch.

“It is wondrous news!” Thor boomed with a wide smile. “The stars gifted their child with the power of worthiness!”

“But Sirius is an asshole,” Tony whined, enviously looking at that hammer. “Mjolnir has terrible taste!”

“Don’t hate the hammer for liking me better,” Sirius said with an obviously fake smile. “You get our kid, I get a bloody hammer.”

And since that was obviously the booze and grief talking, Tony made a quick retreat and sent Pietro to go take care of his bestie. Then, before Tony could try and get a turn holding Staff Sergeant Godwin’s adorable little girl, he was waylaid by his very tipsy son.

“Dad, Dad!” Harry grabbed Tony’s shoulder and Tony put a steadying hand on Harry’s back when he nearly tripped and face planted. “Look at Mum, hurry.”

Tony looked to where Harry and the goth chick he was friends with were looking and sighed in patient amusement when he found his fiancée.

“Is she drunk?” Tony asked Harry with a grin. Pepper had to have been sneaking her own drinks because otherwise Tony’s very prim and professional love was just sober and wobbling precariously on Harry’s broomstick while Wong guided some sort of bubble around her to keep her from crashing into people or walls.

“I hope she isn’t.” Peter joined them and Tony was grateful he paused his laughter long enough to click a few photos of Pepper flying. “I doubt you want the baby to have fetal alcohol syndrome. It’s going to be short enough already.”

Tony and Harry both turned as one to stare at Harry’s entirely too casual looking boyfriend.

“Peter… what?” Harry asked, suddenly stone cold sober.

“Hm?” Peter lowered his camera and glanced between the two Starks as his face slowly drained of color. “Fuck. You totally already knew that, right?”

“You bloody prat!” Harry howled with a wide smile. “How long have you known?!”

“And how long have you known??” Tony yelled across the room to Pepper, too stunned to be happy just yet.

It would come, it would come and put Tony’s perfect happiness with life on levels that even the best tech couldn’t read.

Everyone in the dining room where they’d been mingling went quiet as they tried to puzzle out what Tony was talking about.

Peter was actually frantically apologizing in whispers to Harry, using something about ‘spider senses’ excusing how he noticed Pepper’s recently elevated heart rate and minute changes to her body.

Pepper met Tony’s eyes and smiled, clearly knowing exactly what Tony was asking her.

“I’ve known for two weeks,” she said. “And I mean it, the next one is yours, I’m sick of being sick.”

Tony let out a whoop of laughter and ran from one side of the room to the other so he could carefully swing Pepper off Harry’s broom and into his arms. All of Pepper’s recent insistence that they get moved and the way that she had been complaining about constant ‘unhealthy’ takeout finally made sense. As did the way that Pepper had woke up sick recently, grossing Tony out.

“I thought you were stressed about Harry and that whole ‘battle with evil’ that Wong keeps involving him in!” Tony cried between fast and furious kisses on every inch of Pepper’s perfect face.

They weren’t being subtle at all, not in front of all their closest friends, and the chorus of congratulations filled their home while Wong muttered about ‘helicopter parents’.

Tony was already trying to guide Pepper to a chair so she could rest while Harry was so excited for a sibling that he let Natasha hug him. Rhodey laughed and shook Sirius’ hand, congratulating the godfather on his next Stark he’d have to protect.

“Grandpa!”

Tony looked over his shoulder and saw that Loki has materialized in the center of the packed room before he was promptly hugged by an intoxicated fifteen year old.

“I’m going to be a brother!” Harry told him with a smile that eased every fear Tony had that Harry would resent a sibling.

Loki looked around the room, raising an eyebrow at the mess of cheering amputees, and then patted Harry on the head like a dog.

“A terrible curse,” Loki drawled, eyeing his brother with just a bit too much warmth for his words to have any impact.

“Brother!” Thor approached Loki and slapped him on the back with a hearty smile, jolting Loki and Harry both. “You are here for a merry occasion, indeed! What brings you to Midgard?”

“You know me, brother,” Loki shrugged a shoulder up and continued to study the room that was filled with smiles, laughter, teasing jokes, and love.

“I’m a sucker for a happy ending.”
