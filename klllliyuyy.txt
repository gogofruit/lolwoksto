how he live forever but ain't got time for his kids?
virxil
Summary:

        “At the time it made the most sense that All Might was your father. But now, given your multiple quirks—”

        “I just-it’s still just one quirk! My quirk is just weird!” Izuku protested weakly. No one seemed to acknowledge it.

        “—given your multiple quirks, in combination to your relationship with All Might,” Todoroki continued, monotone, mercilessly objective, as Kaminari watched on in increasingly wide-eyed delight, “it makes more sense for his enemy from Kamino to be your father. The one with a lot of quirks.”

    Todoroki posits a new theory on Izuku's parentage. It's all in good fun, until it isn't. Then it's the custody battle of the century.

Notes:

    dad for one is my favorite theory. it's a silly idea, but this whole manga is a silly idea so all of our disbelief is already thoroughly suspended. i love villains being awkwardly squished into paternal roles and i will not be stopped. also i love all might.

    this is a fairly uh lighthearted take on the theory though, like i LOVE dark fic but i also love true crime comedy shit. and tbh humor and horror go hand in hand.

    the title is from the song 'my dad is rich' by danny gonzalez. that is this fic's tone. let me know in the comments if this fic is...anything lmao.

Chapter 1
Chapter Text

No one would suspect a conspiracy of its magnitude to have such an inconspicuous origin—in retrospect. 

But if Izuku had heeded the concept of retrospect, his arms would have considerably fewer fractures, and well...

As his orthopedic specialist bemoaned, under the ruthless light of an x ray, his arm bones looked like pitted, fragile volcanic rock.

(Whatever. At least Izuku could console himself with the knowledge that the Midoriya family had generously supported Musutafu’s local orthopedic specialist through some difficult financial times.

That was heroic, in a way. Right?)

Nothing about the morning that had an absurd conspiracy theory throwing Izuku into a political comedy was out of the norm.

Like so many weekend mornings around the dorms, 1-A was perched around the common room in various stages of sleepy conversation.

Kyouka was huddled in a loveseat off to the corner with her girlfriend, headphones split down the middle between her and Yaoyozoru. Bakugou, awake before anyone else even on a Saturday, had already returned from his morning run, showered, and prepared a full breakfast. As always, he made it clear he didn’t plan on sharing: he held his bowl close to his chest and shoveled eggs aggressively into his frowning mouth.

Mina and Kaminari sat across from him at the wide dining table. They were swinging their feet in leashed chaotic energy, eyes glinting down greedily at Bakugou’s food, while Kirishima rattled off a string of ideas for the class for the afternoon.

Izuku shared one of the low tables with Todoroki, Uraraka and Iida. Spread out in front of them, their notes splayed in messy piles, were their desperate attempts at documenting Present Mic’s latest lecture. The four of them regarded the papers with careful trepidation.

Despite their best efforts, the words in front of them were still in Japanese. Uraraka seemed to be practicing the method of ‘glaring at the words to translate them.’ It was an interesting concept—Izuku was vaguely sure there was a politician with that quirk.

With an exaggerated sigh, Uraraka flopped backward, arms thrown wide across the floor. “Ughhh, Iida-kun,” she whined. “I thought you were supposed to be the studious one.”

That was a little harsh, Izuku thought, but secretly agreed. He snuck a glance at Iida, who was just a bit pink-cheeked.

“We should all be equally studious!” he argued. “We have a prestigious reputation to uphold. Of course, I haven’t had the chance to review Friday’s lesson quite yet, and, ah. Friday English classes are…”

“Unstructured,” Izuku offered. Iida nodded.

“Of course, I cannot, as a student, critique Present Mic-sensei’s teaching methods. And I am not critiquing! But Fridays…”

Iida trailed off, torn between solidarity with his peers and his adherence to propriety. He was sitting strictly seiza, unwilting even despite his embarrassment under the despairing gaze of Uraraka. 

Izuku couldn’t help but blurt out the relevant info dump sticking to his tongue. “I think it’s because Friday nights are when Present Mic-sensei has his most popular segment on his radio show! He hypes himself up throughout the day so that he’s extra enthusiastic for his guests and his listeners, you know, Friday nights are when he hits his highest ratings! So it makes sense, doesn’t it, for him to be a little overzealous throughout the day.”

He caught his voice starting to rise throughout his spiel, and, with practiced restraint, clapped his mouth shut on the ideas that threatened to keep pouring out. Iida and Uraraka stared at him with familiar slight confusion and uneven smiles. Even across the room, Bakugou audibly scoffed, clearly having overheard him. Izuku flushed.

Nothing about this morning was out of the ordinary for the 1-A dorms. In all likelihood, it would have passed by like any other, fading into obscurity in the class’ memory, but Izuku had to go and continue opening his mouth.

In his defense, he didn’t want to leave things to an embarrassed silence. 

With a short laugh, Izuku ducked his head, a hand rising to the back of his neck. “Ah, well, I also find his Friday lectures kind of hard to follow, Iida-kun. Although, I’m not great at English anyways.”

A shift of color out of the corner of his right eye caught Izuku’s attention. Todoroki had shifted from his lazy, half cross leg, half seiza posture that he always ended up falling into. He picked at one of the sheets of his notes on the table. He managed to make idly playing with paper look thoughtful and handsome.

“I thought you would be good at English,” he said casually.

Izuku blinked. That he would have such expectations was flattering, albeit unexpected.“Ah, thank you! But why English?”

“I bet Todoroki-kun knows way more English than us,” Uraraka mumbled. She managed not to sound too bitter.

(Generally speaking, she restrained her ‘goddamn rich kids’ rants to after 7 pm. For civility’s sake.)

Todoroki gave a slight, brief shake of his head. Somehow, he maintained his elegance even when his mismatched hair stuck to his face. “My English is alright,” he allowed. “My father used it a lot growing up, since he wanted to be known internationally. And All Might is fluent in English, so my old man had to be, too.”

Iida gestured energetically, hands chopping in agreement.

“Certainly, that makes sense! My brother was focused on our precinct, so he never prioritized international languages. Of course the number two hero of our nation would need to know English.”

“Yeah.” Todoroki nodded at Iida in acknowledgement, then turned his calm stare onto Izuku. “Anyway, that’s why I thought you would be good at English. All Might uses it all the time. He used to live in the US, right?”

“He did!” Izuku agreed cheerfully, before he caught onto the rest of that sentence and— “Wait, uh, just because All Might knows English doesn’t mean I would know English, Todoroki-kun.”

He could resist talking about All Might. If he had to.

The other boy gave a slight hum. “I guess I thought, since you’ve known All Might so long, you would hear a lot of English.”

A laugh from across the room carried over, the universal sound of joy at a friend’s expense. Izuku flushed red, hands flapping in nerves. 

“Todoroki-kun,” he whined, “I’ve told you. I- I’ve only known All Might since this year at UA!”

“Hm.”

That was hardly a concession. Izuku flailed. “He’s not my dad!”

Uraraka laughed, shoving Izuku in a wide flat stretch across the table. “Stop trying to deny it, Deku-kun! We’ve seen you two together.”

Kaminari—sat at the dining table with Bakugou, and the source of the prior laughter—pointed an accusing finger in Izuku’s direction, hand gripped awkwardly around his chopsticks. Noodles hung from his utensils. Bakugou, to his left, looked at his lack of manners in disgust.

“Yeah, Deku,” Kaminari called, “that’s some familial energy if I’ve ever seen it. He looks like he wants to ruffle your hair and call you ‘my boy’ whenever you answer a question right.”

“He does call him ‘my boy’ a lot, huh?” Kirishima mused. He sounded way too serious for the topic at hand.

“He fuckin’ calls all the guys in class ’my boy,’” Bakugou grumbled. He dug into his plate with unrivaled aggression. “That doesn’t mean shit, you idiots.”

Nodding frantically, Izuku turned his wide, desperate eyes back on Todoroki in hope. He’d been told they worked miracles. 

Todoroki blinked. He was perpetually immune to feedback from the rest of the class: be it encouragement or flak, his expression was eternally placid. And it didn’t help that he absolutely enjoyed testing Bakugou’s patience. “Yeah,” he said. “He does call everyone that. But actually, I don’t think All Might is his dad any more. I just think they got to know each other prior to UA.”

For a very short moment, Izuku allowed himself to hope. Maybe, just maybe, Todoroki could be convinced to drop his theories entirely.

“Aww, Todoroki-kun,” Uraraka said. She was pouting, like she was personally invested in Todoroki’s prior theory. “What happened! You were the first one to really start the ‘Deku is All Might’s Illegitimate Child’ conspiracy.”

“You’re basically club president, dude,” Kaminari agreed. He’d set his breakfast down and crossed his arms, frowning at Todoroki. “As the unofficial president of the unofficial Illegitimate All Might Lovechild club, you can’t just give up on the dream. What about the rest of us?”

“Rest of us?” Izuku squeaked. He glanced frantically around the room, and to his horror Uraraka, Mina, and Kirshima all nodded. Iida didn’t nod, but he did look slightly flustered, and he refused to look directly in Izuku’s direction. For Iida, it was essentially an admission of collusion.

Izuku couldn’t help but feel betrayed, just a bit.

“How many...who else was in this club?!”

“Don’t worry, Deku! It wasn’t, like, an official club,” Uraraka consoled, as if any sort of club dedicated to his parentage, official or otherwise, could be anything other than utterly mortifying.

“Tsuyu-chan’s in the club,” Mina offered helpfully. “So is Shinsou-kun, although he hasn’t attended any of the meetings yet.”

“Dude, what! There were meetings?” Kirishima swiveled to Mina, tone despairing. He gripped at his shirt and leaned into her side. “I didn’t know we were meeting!”

“I wasn’t aware we had any meetings, either,” Todoroki said. There was the slightest inflection of hurt in his voice, the Todoroki equivalent to shouting in misery. 

Was he feeling left out of the club he had, apparently, founded? Could it really be considered his club if he never attended?

Better yet: why was Izuku mentally considering any of these concepts?

Mina shoved Kirishima out of her space, a mischievous grin on her face. “That was a joke, a joke! We haven’t had any meetings.”

“Ah,” Todoroki said. “That’s good. I would have been a bad club president, otherwise.” He paused. “Well, I suppose I’ll be a bad club president right now, since I am officially stepping down as the unofficial president of the Midoriya is All Might’s Illegitimate Lovechild club.”

“Nooo,” Uraraka moaned. It was hard to take seriously, but her tone was concerningly genuine. She swatted Todoroki on the arm with four fingers, to avoid sending him floating away. “Don’t leave us, Todoroki-kuuun!”

Kirishima sniffed. Izuku could only hope those weren’t tears in his eyes. “Sad to see you go, dude. But it’s definitely manly to follow your beliefs!”

All the everyone-please-focus-on-Midoriya conversation seemed to be straining Bakugou’s already short and frayed social fuse. Sparks fell from where his hands gripped his fork.

Despite himself, Izuku couldn’t help but ask. Todoroki had, after all, been the first one to ever bring up the idea to his face, and apparently the first one to announce his theory to the rest of their class , oh god, so hearing that he had abandoned the All Might Parentage Theory was a surprise.

How was he to know that he was handing Todoroki the wood with which to build his coffin.

“You don’t think All Might is my d...dad anymore, Todoroki-kun?” He couldn’t even say it without tripping over his own tongue; the very concept was a grade school dream spoken aloud, and it was profoundly embarrassing now that he actually knew the man.

God forbid All Might actually hears the theory. That would, he was absolutely certain, make this the worst timeline.

(If he had known what would come from all of this, he wouldn’t have jinxed it, even in his head.) 

Todoroki hummed in consideration. “I did think that,” he agreed. “At the time it made the most sense that All Might was your father. But now, given your multiple quirks—”

“I just- it’s still just one quirk! My quirk is just weird!” Izuku protested weakly. No one seemed to acknowledge it.

“—given your multiple quirks, in combination to your relationship with All Might,” Todoroki continued, monotone, mercilessly objective , as Kaminari watched on in increasingly wide-eyed delight, “it makes more sense for his enemy from Kamino to be your father. The one with a lot of quirks.”

The group at large gave this statement the hefty silence it deserved. Izuku felt his jaw hang loosely.

Mentally, Izuku swore at Blackwhip; why did the past One for All users have to have such obnoxious , conspicuous quirks?

“He and All Might obviously knew each other,” Todoroki continued, like the phrase ‘they knew each other’ was at all a fitting description of the number one hero’s decades-long, gore-filled crusade against a powerful enemy. “Plus, you seemed to have an idea of who the villain was when we arrived at Kamino. You looked like you were ready to stand and confront him. 

“Back before you arrived at UA, All Might must have recognized the gravity of your situation, and your heroic spirit. So he helped you escape him and apply to UA.”

On some level, Izuku couldn’t help but admire the thought Todoroki had put into the (absolutely insane) conspiracy. It was convoluted, it held kernels of truth, and it was scandalous.

On every other conceivable level, he couldn’t help but want to burst into tears at what his life had become.

Bakugou, naturally, broke the room’s straining, painful quiet.

“What the fuck,” he said. His teeth were gritted and his hands were smoking. If Izuku hadn’t known him for so long, he’d be afraid he was going to melt his spoon. “First All Might’s his fuckin’ dad, but then that’s not convenient any more, so his greatest enemy is your second guess? Why the fuck would All Might hang around that dickhead’s kid?”

Kaminari, however, grabbed the branch Todoroki was dangling and pulled the whole tree up from the roots. The delight that glowed on his face seemed to trigger an extension of his quirk—an effect Izuku would have, in any other circumstances, found very interesting—and the hair on his head and his eyebrows were standing on end, like static on a balloon pulling all the blond strands on his head afloat.

“Oh, you’re onto something, man! Of course All Might would watch over his enemy’s kid, to make sure, right? But then, then he saw Midoriya-kun’s hero spirit and his super strong quirks, and he must’ve been like, ‘ This will be just like Star Wars!’”

It wasn’t a terrible All Might impression. That made it worse. 

Izuku moaned into the palm of his hand in despair. “What does that even mean, Kaminari-kun?!”

“What, you’ve never seen Star Wars?”

“ That’s not the issue!” Then, barely a mutter: “Of course I’ve seen Star Wars. It’s All Might’s favorite series.”

Kirishima seemed torn between consoling Bakugou’s steaming rage and joining Kaminari in the pure joy of what was undoubtedly the most unrestrained thesis that Class 1-A had created to date. In the end, Izuku guessed, it was too tempting not to throw himself into the jubilation.

“That is a good theory, huh,” he said, smiling tentatively in Todoroki’s direction. “That’s just like All Might, right? He wouldn’t leave a super sweet and strong kid with a crazy villain. So manly.”

“—does that make All Might Yoda, though?” Mina mused.

“No way, he’s too tall! He’d be Obi Wan.”

Hand rising in a desisting gesture, Iida cut off the conversation between the three. “While it is a very interesting and well-constructed theory, we need to stay respectful of All Might-sensei! Regardless of if he valiantly rescued Midoriya-kun from his father’s grasp, he is first and foremost our teacher! We shouldn’t be speculating so much over his personal life and comparing him to fictional characters.”

“Deku-kun said All Might liked Star Wars, Iida.”

Iida hesitated briefly at this comment. Took it into quick consideration. “Regardless, this sensational story is the emotional past of our teacher. We need to be considerate.”

At that, well. The way Iida was talking, they were ready to take this dubious idea and hold it up as codified theory. Izuku wasn’t going to let this keep going.

“This isn’t—no!” he cried. He stood up, glancing around frantically at his friends in desperation. “There is no past. Todoroki-kun, you were convinced that All Might was my father not even three months ago. You all can’t really be considering that All for On e is my dad!”

There was an unusually sharp glint in Todoroki’s eyes. “His name is All for One? That name hasn’t been published in the media. I wonder how you know it.”

Mina cackled.

A lightbulb near Kaminari popped out from the force of his beaming grin, though it was drowned out by the popping sounds made by Bakugou’s clenched hands. He had stood to his feet and was scowling, teeth gritted.

“You’re all talking about shit you don’t fuckin’ understand. Don’t drag All Might into this paternity test garbage. He’s got enough to fucking deal with.”

“Does he?” Mina asked innocently. “He’s retired now, though.”

Bakugou didn’t grace that comment with a response. He’d shoved his chair back into the table and had moved to the kitchen, where he took up a washrag with restrained, passive aggressive gusto. Apparently he had one last comment in him, since, as he turned the faucet on full blast, he shouted back to the group:

“Also, I’ve met Deku’s fuckin’ dad when we were little brats! I think I’d remember if his old man was a goddamn supervillain, especially since the villain fuckin’ kidnapped me!”

Kirishima, Mina, and Kaminari all quieted at that, faces taking on the embarrassed quality of someone who accidentally brought up a sore subject.

Social graces were never enough to stop Todoroki.

“He was wearing a mask, though,” he argued plainly.

“His face was pretty messed up, huh,” Uraraka mused. She held her chin between her thumb and pointer finger. “I bet that was from All Might, too. Maybe when All Might met him before, when he was rescuing Deku-kun…”

Todoroki nodded in agreement. His gaze was directed in a distant stare at the table, like he was focused on committing these ideas to memory. 

Apparently decency and shame had relinquished their hold on the three at the other table, because, with a quick glance to make sure that Bakugou was out of range and absorbed with demolishing dishes, Kaminari strolled over to Izuku’s table and dropped the the group next to Todoroki.

He clapped a hand to Todoroki’s shoulder with a sage nod. “Club prez has me convinced now, guys. I propose we rename our club to, uh… What was his name, Deku?”

“All for One,” Izuku mumbled, since the secret was already out of the bag. This situation had run away from him at top speed. Still. “But. I cannot stress enough how much he is not my father. ”

From the table across the room, Mina pointed a demanding finger in Izuku’s direction. “Mido-kun, what’s your dad’s name?”

“H-Hisashi.”

“Occupation and the last time you saw him?”

“Ah, well, he’s a salaryman, and I think he left Japan around when I turned five…But he called me on the phone all the time until I was about 9.”

“His quirk?”

“Fire breathing.”

With a thoughtful humm, Mina tapped her finger against her lips in thought. Izuku refused to feel like this was an interrogation: the two of them were having a, a conversation. “And your mom’s?” she asked.

“...the ability to attract small objects.” He cut off her protests before she could go further than opening her mouth. “But there are plenty of cases where children develop completely different quirks than their parents!”

Kaminari was shaking his head sadly, his hand patting against where it was clasped on Tokoroki’s shoulder. Sat next to him and mildly perturbed, Todoroki didn’t seem to know what to do with the physical contact. 

“I dunno, man,” Kaminari said. “Your quirks, the vanishing, the adoptive mentor-dad vibes from All Might, it’s all adding up for me.” He shrugged. “Guess we’re gonna have to change the club name.”

Futilely, Izuku glanced between the spread out group. All of them were wearing similar expressions of determination and delight, like they’d uncovered some great conspiracy. This had gone further than just running away from him, he realized. This had full-on taken flight.

This could be...bad, right?

This was bad, right?

“I have to go,” Izuku blurted awkwardly. Papers were unceremoniously scooped into his backpack, and he fired off a text to All Might. Belatedly, he hoped that the text in question didn’t send his mentor into an aneurysm.  

“Aww, Deku-kun,” Uraraka said. She frowned up sadly at him. “We didn’t mean to upset you. Do you not want us to mention it around you again?”

I don’t want you to mention it at all, Izuku thought to himself, mildly hysteric. I don’t want you to think about it at all.

“It’s fine,” he bit out. Hm, that came out too confrontational. He needed to be more casual, like he wasn’t helplessly invested in this conversation. With a forced smile that must have been more concerning than intended, based on Todoroki’s startled reaction, he continued, “Really, it’s fine! Feel, uh, feel free to talk about whatever you want! It’s not like All Might and I are hiding anything,” he rambled with a dumb laugh.

Smooth.

Up at his shoulders, his hands gripped tightly to the straps of his backpack. He was shuffling backward, feet ready to pull him out of the situation and take him to his aforementioned mentor. “I’ll see you all later, okay?”

Without waiting to hear a reply, Izuku hurried off. His heartbeat was loud in his ears, embarrassment warming his face, but it was important he faced this issue now rather than later. If One for All had any more obnoxious quirks hiding for him to uncover….

Well. He’d rather everyone think All Might was his dad.

If his stubbornly conspiratorial class could just stick to that theory, things would be sure to settle down.
Chapter 2

Chapter Text

“Ah,” said All Might. He looked paler than normal, which was saying something, since his usual pale was a swatch away from anemic. 

Stewing in guilt, Izuku scuffed his shoe against the floor.  “I’m sorry,” he said, despite his mentor’s repeated requests to stop apologizing. How else was one supposed to approach this situation? All Might had dozens of books dedicated to teaching, but Izuku was fairly certain he didn’t have any about confronting sudden onset paternity.

(Okay, more than fairly certain: Izuku had comprehensively scanned All Might’s bookshelf and kept a ledger of the titles. For heroic purposes that weren’t creepy. Could be important, heroic knowledge in one of those books, who knows!)

“My boy,” All Might started, settling a comforting hand on Izuku’s shoulder, then seemed to catch himself. “Er, I can see what they were getting at.” With a sheepish cough, he guiltily retracted his hand to his lap.

The atmosphere was potently embarrassing. Both of them looked toward the ground and fidgeted.

“You know,” All Might said, “Todoroki-shounen’s whole idea is, ah, a lot. How he managed to reach such a theory I couldn’t say. But it does make me think…” he trailed off.

Eager for any wisdom All Might could impart, Izuku nodded in encouragement.

“It’s sort of like Star Wars.”

(Kaminari’s impression had been spot on.)

With a shout of anguish, Izuku jumped to his feet. One hand rose and gripped his hair, the other tapping at his lip frantically, as he began to pace his room frantically.

“My boy, what—”

“That’s what Kaminari-kun said,” Izuku hissed. Toshinori startled at the sight of tears in his protege’s eyes, Izuku’s appearance unable to be described as anything but unhinged. “He said, ‘This will be just like Star Wars,’ and I said, What does that even mean , Kaminari-kun? But I’ve—I’ve seen Star Wars!”

“I know you have!” All Might placated. He did his best to sound consoling, despite absolutely not following this sudden desperation. All he had been trying to do was make a lighthearted comparison about the situation! He didn’t mean to cause an existential crisis. “We watched it together, for your birthday.”

“For my birthday,” Izuku repeated. His eyes were wide, staring at nothing, his hands dropping to his sides in defeat. He turned to All Might, tears still pooling. “I’ve seen Star Wars, All Might,” he rasped; he sounded defeated.

With that, the tears started falling. Toshinori flailed. He tried opening his mouth to console his successor, because what did that mean , but Izuku cut him off with a rough voice.

“We watched Star Wars together for my birthday,” he said. “Gods, we both hung out with my mom for my birthday. Does that...am I Luke?” he bemoaned.

Toshinori cut off the rant before Izuku could get too lost in his own head. Goodness knows his boy had the habit.

“Izuku,” he said, and he couldn’t help but take pride in the happy flush the boy always got when he used his given name. Part of it was a takeaway from his days in the States, but mostly he used the name sparingly, wielding it with affection.

“What I mean to say,” All Might said, voice gentle, “is that the idea is, er. Very creative and fantastical, and obviously absurd. The very idea that a selfless, kind boy like you could be any product of that man …” he trailed off, shaking his head and biting back the ancient rage. Izuku watched him with watery eyes, and Toshinori continued. “The plot reminded me of Star Wars, that’s all. A nonsense conspiracy is irrelevant to our relationship and your status as my successor.”

With a sniffle, Izuku protested, “But you like Star Wars,” he mumbled.

How could a kid be so cute while being able to punch a hole in the sky, Toshinori wondered in mild awe. 

Truly, more than One For All, Izuku’s real quirk was the ability to melt the hearts of those around him into puddles. This whole situation was absurd and yet Toshinori felt the incessant urge to ruffle his kid’s hair.

“Forget Star Wars,” he said, to Izuku’s obvious shock. And his own, since well, they were his all-time favorite movies, but if it upset Izuku so much: “If it means keeping you safe from such hurtful rumors, I would be happy to redirect your classmates’ attention to their previous theory.”

It was ridiculous for Toshinori’s heart to be racing; he felt like a schoolboy confessing to his crush, not a retired pro hero offering to let his protege submit a paternity claim.

Izuku blinked. His hands were limp at his side, and he stared uncomprehendingly at All Might. He felt like he had short circuited, bluescreened into a fictional world where All Might, the All Might, was actually suggesting—but no, he couldn’t be, Izuku was just misunderstanding. Was this a willful delusion? There was no way All Might was offering to— 

“I am offering, my boy. Nothing would make me so proud as to call you. Call you. Er.”

All Might seemed to choke. His face had gone as red as Izuku had ever seen it, and Izuku vaguely soaked in the mortification that, oh, gods he had said that out loud? But also, was All Might choking? Was he killing All Might via his classmates’ stupid conspiracies?

Izuku rushed to Toshinori’s side, panicking only a little bit. He looked frantically over his mentor’s wheezing form, and, overcome with panic, Izuku slapped at All Might's back with an open palm in an attempt to clear his airway.

Shit. 

He didn’t mean to use One for All—!

Once Izuku had completed having a mild panic attack, and All Might had picked himself off where he had been body slammed into Izuku’s floor, the two (with a significant amount of blushing and stammering) managed to come to a hesitant, deeply embarrassing conclusion:

It would be a lot more convenient if their class thought Izuku was All Might’s son rather than All For One’s.

It would help them maintain the secret of One for All, and it would explain their relationship. No doubt it would come with its own plethora of issues if it spread outside their class, but those issues seemed significantly less troublesome than dealing with his classmates relating him to an incarcerated villain. There was just one problem.

Well, two problems.

All Might was in his mother’s living room, dealing with problem one. Although, really, his mom didn’t deserve being considered a problem, even just in Izuku’s head. Izuku quickly rescinded that label: his mom couldn’t ever be a problem , she was just a... complication in their plan.

No, there was one complication with the plan, and one problem. An explosive problem.

“Why the fuck am I here,” Bakugou growled.

Izuku sat across from the problem. He fiddled with his shirt and glanced nervously at the problem, who seemed to be seething in frustration, legs splayed and arms crossed aggressively as he slumped in Izuku’s bedroom chair. By no means did he envy All Might—

(“Toshinori,” the All Might in his memory corrected. Neither of them could meet the other’s eyes, but Toshinori had a hand on Izuku’s back as Izuku held his head in his hands in happy mortification. “If we’re going to commit to this, it’s only right you get to use my given name yourself, my boy.”

Neither of them brought up that, if they were to commit to this, he would also have to call him. Well. Dad . Izuku was pretty sure that he would spontaneously combust and burn UA to the ground if he tried.)

By no means did he envy Toshinori. He had the significantly undesirable position of having to explain not only their cover-up but also the entire reason they had to craft one to Izuku’s mother. There was really no way around it, the two had decided: if Inko was going to be looped into their conspiracy, she had to be looped into the truth about One for All.

“Hey!” the problem barked. Izuku jerked out of his thoughts, meeting Bakugou’s frustrated glare. “Don’t fuckin’ ignore me,” he grumbled, hands clenched in his pants pockets. The other boy took a deep breath, saying, “You dragged me back to Auntie Inko’s place on a Saturday night for a fuckin’ reason , right? Everybody knows it’s just you ‘n All Might that make these trips any other damn week.”

Kacchan was being polite, Izuku thought. Polite for Kacchan, but he noticed the other boy practicing his breathing exercises. He had to squash down his pride at Bakugou’s commitment to therapy; now wasn’t the time.

“Sorry, Kacchan,” Izuku mumbled. His hands fiddled anxiously in his lap. “It’s just… You know how Todoroki-kun and the others were talking earlier? About, uh… who my dad could be?”

Bakugou scoffed. “Obviously,” he muttered. “Stupid fuckin’ idiots. They don’t know what they’re dealing with, bringing up that asshole.”

“Oh, they really, really don’t,” Izuku agreed. “But Todoroki-kun mentioned a- a club.”

“That bullshit? Who cares what kind of club a bunch of extras make up.”

“Well…” Izuku trailed off. Bakugou eyed him suspiciously, and he held his hands up defensively. “Look, he’s been bringing up his Secret Lovechild conspiracy for the entire school year! Ever since the Sports Festival—”

“ Hahh ?!”

“—we’ll be in class,” Izuku rambled, “and he’ll silently pass me a note that just says, ‘I know,’ and he’ll just look between me and All Might and gesture. Or, or whenever I go to eat lunch with All Might, he’ll stare at me and say, ‘Father son bonding.’ And everyone else just nods!”

Bakugou’s hands sparked. “How the fuck have I not heard this?!”

“Kacchan,” Izuku pleaded, “whenever Todoroki-kun speaks in class, you pointedly turn off your hearing aid!”

“...I don’t want to listen to the half n’ half bastard, so fuckin’ what,” Bakugou grumbled. He managed to slouch further into the chair, somehow; he looked in danger of slumping to the floor out of the sheer force of his disregard.

“The point is he doesn’t let these theories go,” Izuku said. “And now everyone in class has their hands on this new conspiracy, and I just know they’re going to drag it out for all it’s worth. I can see it now—”

“Get to the point, idiot.”

“—someone’s going to mention Tartarus,” Izuku continued, staring with desperate eyes at Bakugou, “and Todoroki-kun’s going to say something like, ‘Isn’t that where your dad lives, Midoriya-kun?’ And then everyone will stand up and clap. And then it’s going to go viral. ”

“What.”

“The point!” Izuku said, probably too enthusiastically, since Bakugou hissed and huddled himself back up into a relatively normal posture. “The point is, All Might and I were talking, and between this and One For All, we should just...just let them focus on the more plausible theory.”

“...you want everyone to think All Might’s your fuckin’ dad?”

Izuku nodded feverishly. Then, catching himself and blushing, he shook his head. “Yes! Er, no , I don’t want them to think that All Might’s my dad, haha, that would be weird , wouldn’t it? I definitely haven’t written fanfiction about that. But I’d rather they think All Might is my dad and keep One For All secret than drag up All For One into daily conversation.”

Bakugou had seemingly passed through every stage of rage and had arrived at irked and baffled. Izuku relaxed, just a bit; that usually meant he wouldn’t blow anything up, at least.

“This is dumb as fuck. But whatever, it’s up to you two if you want to drag All Might into this shit, I guess.” He leaned forward, intensifying his glare. “None of that explains why you dragged me to your mom’s place at fuck o’clock on a Saturday.”

“Well…” Izuku said, returning to his previous embarrassment. “Everyone knows we grew up together, and you- you said you’ve met my dad earlier today. Plus you’re in the know about One For All...”

“You want me to participate in this goddamn trainwreck.” 

“Kacchan,” Izuku urged, “I want you to help me steer this train directly into the wreck.”

From the living room, there came the unmistakable sound of breaking dishes, followed by his mom’s voice raised in anger. Toshinori could be heard rapidly pleading, but Izuku’s mom became a force of nature in her rare outrage. Phrases like “lying to my face” and “just another deceptive man trying to act like you deserve to be his father” echoed down the hallway.

Izuku and Bakugou both stared in mild terror at the door.

“He told her,” Izuku stated.

“All Might just became a dad,” Bakugou said, red eyes sharp on his door, “and he’s already gonna fuckin’ die.”

In the end, his mom did not kill All Might, although Izuku suspected it was a near thing. Toshinori’s eyes were wide like a man that had been pulled back from a sheer cliff face just in the nick of time. His hand on Izuku’s shoulder trembled, just a bit.

“Ah, in the end, no matter how frustrating it is for these men in your life to hide such things from me,” his mom sighed, face in a slightly strained smile, “I just can’t deny how much happiness he’s brought into your life, Izuku.”

Izuku blushed. So did Toshinori. Bakugou made a choked, gagging sound at all of the paternal sentiment and Izuku briefly worried that he would actually vomit on Izuku out of spite.

His mom clapped her hands in front of her with a brighter smile. “Well!” she chirped. “With all of those secrets on the table, it’s only fair to share what we’re working with, right?”

Somehow, that sounded like a threat.

Rarely opened and just as seldom added to, the Midoriya family’s collection of scrapbooks had been hiding in some cabinet drawer beneath a pile of recipe books. It was pastel green coated in a layer of dust. The phrase ‘Family is Everything’ was wide across the cover in sparkly silver ink, surrounded by bright stickers Izuku vaguely remembered applying.

‘Everything’ was underlined heavily in dark red glitter. This, too, seemed somehow threatening.

“I remember Izuku, Hisashi and I filling this in,” his mom said, trailing her fingers carefully over the cover. She smiled fondly. “Ah, Izuku applied the stickers. I did the calligraphy. Hisashi added the underline—nothing was important to him like family.” She paused, and her voice lowered when she repeated: “Nothing.”

An uncomfortable silence stretched across the room.

His mother’s smile seemed stuck in place. “Yes, he always said family was everything to him. And then he left! But that’s fine. We were fine! Weren’t we, Izuku?”

The way she said it didn’t really sound like a question, and Izuku nodded hastily. “Yes! Yes, we’re perfectly fine, mom! And- and he used to call a lot, too, and that was fine!”

The atmosphere could be cut with a fork. Bakugou stared blankly at the scrapbook like he could ignite it with his eyes. All Might seemed to be looking for some way out of this sensitive topic.

“No matter,” his mom sighed with that same smile. The tension finally drained out of the room, and they all felt their shoulders drop and the tensed lines of their spines loosen. Inko’s hand relaxed from its deathgrip on the book’s top. “After all,” she continued lightly, “Hisashi has been gone for years , and now my boy has a wonderful new male role model to welcome into our family.”

With that, she opened the scrapbook’s cover. The first page was a family portrait of the three when Izuku was still a toddler, his mother and father (in matching, sharp suits) both holding him with wide smiles and Izuku (in a very tiny version of the same outfit) grinning at the camera. It was the same photo he remembered his dad always looking at in his wallet, except—

“Uh, what the fuck.”

“Language, dear,” Inko said faintly, then, “Oh, but. That’s very odd, isn’t it?”

His father’s face had been carefully cut out of the photo, leaving behind his broad, suited silhouette. Izuku felt a shiver run up his spine, feeling like he was looking at a morbid trophy left behind by a serial killer.

“Hm.”

Inko turned to the next page, which documented her and Hisashi’s wedding, and was greeted with a similarly creepy, increasingly uncanny phenomenon. There she stood in her wedding kimono, young and pregnant, and there was a handsome, suited Hisashi. Most of him.

Because his face was cut out of that picture, too. And the next, Inko sharing a wedding kiss with a blank white square in the paper, and there on the next page was Hisashi holding newborn baby Izuku, presumably looking down at his son for the first time. But you couldn’t tell, because his face was torn out of that photo, as well.

And on the next page, and the next. Izuku felt faint.

“I didn’t do this,” he argued, looking at his co-conspirators. “Kacchan, you didn’t—?”

“When the fuck would I ? Why would I?”

Silence settled uncomfortably around the table again.

“This is...certainly concerning,” Toshinori muttered, uneasy. “Perhaps he felt the need to remove himself from the scrapbooks after he removed himself from your lives? Maybe out of, er, guilt?”

“If nothing else, this makes the lie easier, right?” Izuku offered. “We could say, um. We had to cut you out of the pictures for our safety, so no one would find out. And- and I mean, you kind of have the same figure as my dad, right, All Might?”

Izuku made a gesture with his hands to indicate ‘you are very large and muscly,’ but Toshinori regarded the motion with concern.

More quiet, heavy with everything they weren’t saying. Izuku’s mom looked at all the censored family photos like a mortician viewing a body. The pressure in the room squeezed at Izuku’s lungs; he had never seen a look like that on his mother’s face before.

“He ruined my scrapbook,” she said.

Halfway across Japan, Midoriya Hisashi felt a mysterious shiver run down his spine, like someone had walked across his grave.

Tartarus was said to be impenetrable, inescapable, but the sense of an impending threat settled across Hisashi’s tightly bound shoulders all the same.

Chapter Text

The rest of the evening, they worked on streamlining the narrative.

“We should try to keep everything as contained as possible,” Toshinori said, embarrassment with the situation still obvious. “Still, it’s important that if it does come up in conversation, you answer without hesitating.”

Izuku stared down with determination at the timeline he had sketched out across one of his hero notebooks. Although it seemed kind of sacrilegious to fill it out with false information entirely unrelated to actual heroics, it was related to his heroics career . That counted, right?

“Lying without hesitation,” Izuku mumbled, reading over his fake timeline. “Have you had to do a lot of lying in interviews, All—Toshinori?”

Toshinori rubbed at the back of his head. “Ah, quite a lot, I’m afraid,” he admitted. “Particularly about my quirk, of course, but also about. Well, about my personal history, my relationships, my family, my favorite locations—”

Izuku gaped up at Toshinori, distressed. “That’s everything about you, though!”

“God, none of that shit matters. Can we focus on getting your fuckin’ story straight so we can get to the dorms and I can go the fuck to sleep?” Bakugou interrupted

It wasn’t a difficult story to put together, as it turned out. Sadly, with how absent a figure Izuku’s dad had been, he left a lot of (broad, tall) holes in his childhood just waiting to be filled in by any forthcoming father figure. All they really had to improvise was why Izuku was only now owning up to his parentage, and the recent developments with One For All.

“Our fake-but-also-not-fake connection is easy when it’s just the strength, but with the others…” Izuku trailed off. He brought up Blackwhip in demonstration, which helpfully illustrated the obvious issue by being conspicuous.

Immense strength was easy to connect to All Might. Floating black energy tendrils, not so much.

“You’re intelligent enough to think of something,” Toshinori said, entirely unhelpful. His eyes darted away anxiously, and it was obvious that he had the same concerns as Izuku—and that he hoped to avoid having to answer the question.

Izuku stared up at his mentor with despairing eyes. Toshinori did not meet his gaze.

“Er, when you come up with that explanation, be sure to tell me, my boy. Not that I expect this to become an issue! It shouldn’t.”

“Un-fucking-believable,” Bakugou muttered.

“We’ll - We’ll deal with the problem if it arises!” Toshinori insisted. “But it won’t.”

Naturally, the problem arose as soon as class began the following week.

They managed to get through most of the day without his class bringing up anything related to Izuku’s family, thankfully. Homeroom passed without much incident, Todoroki only stared at Izuku for a few minutes in silence throughout history, and even training went okay: Todoroki and Kaminari did lean together and trade concerning whispers when Float activated after Izuku punched the air in victory, but they kept it between themselves. All in all, Monday made Izuku hopeful that his classmates might let things settle.

At lunch, he paid dearly for letting his guard down.

Izuku, as usual, sat with Uraraka, Iida, Todoroki, and Tsuyu. The cafeteria was always packed at lunch, since they shared the hour with General Education and Support and Business classes, so everyone had to speak at a higher volume than usual to be heard. From the next table over, Izuku could see Bakugou angrily adjust at his hearing aid.

To Izuku’s pleasant surprise, Shinsou ended up drifting toward their table. He hadn’t started in the hero course yet—although there was a free space after class 1A’s resoundingly successful campaign to expel Mineta—but he ended up sitting in on almost all of their training, so he was a hero student de facto. 

Still, he tended to be reluctant to socialize with their class. He seemed to be receptive to Izuku, though, and Izuku was (as always) utterly determined to be friends with as many people as he possibly could. He waved Shinsou over to their table, scooting to make a free seat between him and Todoroki.

“Hey.”

“Shinsou-kun!” Izuku greeted. “You weren’t in training today. How are things going?”

“Fine. Busy with physical conditioning.” Shinsou was a man of few words. Maybe that’s why, like Todoroki, he seemed to gravitate to Izuku and Kaminari; they both had a tendency to ramble. Izuku was happy some of his friends were quiet and normal and respectful.

Then Shinsou turned to Todoroki and opened his mouth.

“Heard you’re quitting the Secret Lovechild Conspiracy Club.”

Izuku dropped his chopsticks. Like Todoroki, Shinsou seemed to gravitate to insanity , apparently. Or maybe just a lack of basic social skills? What was it with powerful quirks and socially ostracizing upbringings that made his classmates so obsessed with his paternity?

With a casual shrug, Todoroki admitted, “It’s more of a rebranding. A new theory seems to fit better, now.”

“Oh?”

This was—Izuku didn’t want to bring up their whole fake backstory, but he had to put a stop to Todoroki’s even wilder All For One theory before it could go any further. That was the whole point of pretending that All Might was his dad, after all: constrain the conspiracy to the halls of UA and out of, well, Tartarus .

With the most innocent, pleading gaze he could muster, Izuku waved his hands between his friends to break up the conversation.

(Not that he had to pretend, really, about the pleading.)

“Ah, please guys,” Izuku begged. He made a show of turning his gaze toward the lunch table. It wasn’t even hard to look as pathetic as possible, because his classmates’ conspiracies naturally reduced him to anguish. Quietly, he said, “A- About your theories, Todoroki-kun, I wanted, um. That is. I had to say…”

Gaze unendingly patient, Todoroki nodded in encouragement. Shinsou’s eyes darted between the two of them like he was watching a match in the Sports Festival.

This was it. No going back. Izuku took a couple of deep breaths and tried to convince himself that this wasn’t one of the most profoundly humiliating moments of his life. All Might, no, Toshinori was on his side! He just had to say it once or twice, and once it was out there his classmates would let it go and it would lose its conspiratorial drama and everything would calm down.

Shinsou slurped loudly at his juice packet.

In a hushed tone, Izuku managed to get out what he could. “We’ve—All Might and I—we’ve been...trying to keep all of this quiet, you know?” Out of the corner of his eye, Izuku noticed Uraraka and Iida both turn not-so-discreetly to listen in on the conversation. “I didn’t want to say anything at first, because it’s kind of, well...sensitive?”

The others stared at him with bated breath. Shinsou’s juice packet dangled limply from its straw.

“But- But hearing that you’re trying to say I’m, uh, this villain’s child, we finally thought.” Don’t choke, Izuku, keep calm and think of All Might. “Just between our class! We could maybe be honest. About All Might. Being. The dad. Of mine.”

There. It wasn’t a complete sentence, but he said it! That counted, right? It was out there and now everyone in 1-A could freak out and get over it.

Shinsou’s mouth dropped open and his juice packet clattered to the table. “Wait, really? I was just jok—”

Uraraka vaulted across the table to grab Izuku’s hands. Her expression was unflinchingly earnest, as emotionally affected as a bridegroom at a wedding. “Deku-kun,” she said, “I’m so—so proud of you!”

Iida nodded vigorously. “It comes as no surprise, truly, but we welcome your newfound honesty! And, of course, as a fellow legacy hero student and the next in line of the prestigious Ingenium Hero Agency—”

Todoroki’s eyes were narrowed slightly. He stared at Shinsou’s spilled juice like it would begin spelling out cosmic secrets. “Wait,” he said.

At that, Iida quieted down and gestured vigorously for Todoroki to continue. Uraraka blinked at Todoroki in confusion, and Izuku...well. 

He wasn’t one for prayers, but if one of the past One For All users had some sort of, oh, Let My Friend Be Normal For Once Please quirk , now would be an excellent time to manifest. No pressure! But he was holding out for the third One For All user, personally.

Todoroki brought both pointer fingers into the air. He glanced between the two carefully. “What made me first think that All For One was your father,” he said, “was your quirks.”

“ Quirk. Singular.” Izuku smiled kindly. Compelled, coerced, but kindly. Just radiating kindliness. He urged the power of his smile to soothe Todoroki’s incessant mind into silence. Unfortunately, this was yet another quirk that did not choose to manifest.

With a slow shake of his head, Todoroki gestured with both of his pointer fingers. He brought the two together and then slowly apart, tracking them with his gaze. “I connected them,” he said. “The floating, and the power, and the dark tentacles—”

“ Please do not call it that.”

“—you have dark arm tentacles.” Todoroki returned his merciless stare to Izuku’s own. “Everything else, I can connect it back to All Might directly. It was my original theory, when you just showed the strength, after all. But I can’t see how such vastly different abilities could all be ways that one quirk manifests.”

Izuku thought rapidly. Mentally, he scoured the pages upon pages he’d put into his hero notebook, trying to think of a vaguely comparable quirk. But, of course, there weren’t any—because One For All was a bastard quirk. There had to be something he could bullshit … Oh.

“Todoroki-kun,” Izuku said calmly. “What do you know about the Quirk Singularity theory?”

The other boy frowned in consideration. The pointer fingers he had raised lowered slightly from their previous position, his conviction visibly deflating. “Not much,” he admitted.

Eyes glinting in determination, Izuku turned quickly to Iida and Uraraka and asked, “And you guys? How familiar are either of you with the Quirk Singularity theory?”

Seeming guilty at his lack of familiarity with something they had gone over in class, Iida said, “I know that it involves quirks growing stronger over time, but that is as much as I can think of.” Uraraka puckered her mouth up like she often did when Aizawa-sensei presented a pop quiz, scratching at her cheek and shrugging.

As Izuku swiveled toward Shinsou, the other boy waved his hands frantically. “I’m not a quirk nerd like you, man. And we barely went over that in Gen Ed, I’m with Iida-kun, here,” Shinsou defended.

A placid, unflinching smile crawled across Izuku’s face. Across the table, Shinsou shivered.

“Great,” Izuku chirped. “I was hoping that would be the case!”

What followed wasn’t, strictly speaking, a lie. Quirk Singularity theory was, after all, a constantly developing idea that added upon itself with every new generation of quirk users. One For All just so happened to embody the theory. If quirk academics could learn about Izuku’s quirk, he was sure they would be falling over themselves to publish papers on the subject.

But his quirk was an important secret, and as far as his friends needed to be concerned, it was a wacky result of inheriting the number one hero’s overpowered quirk.

“Well,” Izuku started, heart racing in an odd rush as he spread the truth paper thin to his friends, “the Quirk Singularity theory says that each generation of quirk users increases the power of their quirks exponentially. Every decade quirks seem to trounce the previous decade’s abilities: think of your parents’ quirks compared to ours, and ours compared to, I don’t know, if Kacchan and I had a child. Their quirk would be overwhelmingly strong, right?”

The others were getting it, he could tell. Uraraka nodded. Iida seemed to be taking mental notes. Toroki’s gaze was intense. 

“So, the specifics aren’t exact, obviously,” Izuku rambled, hearing his own pulse thud heavily in his ears. “But with”—he lowered his voice and his eyes—” All Might being my d- dad and his quirk being so insanely strong, it’s only gotten stronger as I’ve had it. But my body’s gotten stronger, too. We think that, with my body finally being strong enough to handle it, the quirk’s stockpiled energy is manifesting in these weird, new ways.”

Even Shinsou, as purportedly uninvested as he claimed to be, exhaled in a low whistle. Uraraka had her hands clenched tightly in front of her, eyebrows furrowed.

“That’s- that’s so much to handle, Deku-kun!” she rushed out.

Iida gave a single, firm nod. “Indeed. To be entrusted with such a powerful family legacy, I can understand why you’d need to keep this all secret. As always, I am impressed by your heroic determination!”

Izuku felt...off. They were buying it? They were just trusting his explanation, without question? A part of him, the part that had huddled alone in middle school classrooms, trying to stay out of sight, was struck with deep affection. To have friends that take his ideas at face value, and respect his wishes for discretion—he was so lucky!

Another part of him, a part that had only recently hatched and that squirmed awake to deal with troublesome questions, found the situation to be weirdly….fun. He wasn’t lying , technically speaking, but he was being deceptive and they just - took it.

Was… was he good at being deceptive? Did he even, on some newly discovered level, enjoy it?

That couldn’t be the case. He was going to be a hero: heroes didn’t enjoy twisting the truth. Obviously he was just relieved that his friends accepted his explanation. Yep. That was it. No deeper self-examination needed.

“That doesn’t make sense.”

Izuku’s heart skipped a beat, but his fake self-conscious smile held firm. “What doesn’t, Todoroki-kun?”

Todoroki was still frowning in thought. “Why would a strength quirk just suddenly develop tentacles? How is the floating connected? It doesn’t make sense.”

“Todoroki-kun,” Izuku said sweetly. “You’re thinking about it too much.”

“I don’t…”

“Iida-kun was born with engines in his legs , Todoroki-kun,” Izuku pressed. “Engines! How did that happen, biologically? Are they organic matter or inorganic? Do they connect to his intravenous system? How does that affect the fact that they seem to create exhaust? What is the exhaust composed of?”

Poor Iida was gaping, staring at Izuku like he’d forecasted the boy’s own death. His mouth opened and closed in silent protest; he had clamped his hands over the engines in his legs self consciously, a man stripped raw in front of merciless spectators.

A necessary sacrifice, Izuku thought desperately to himself. He hated to throw a friend under the bus, but Todoroki just needed to shut up and accept his dumb, fake theory.

Todoroki shut his mouth with a click. He stared at Iida in bafflement. “...huh.”

“Damn,” Shinsou said. He shook his head, mouth slanted in a smile. “He makes a good point, huh? What the fuck are quirks, anyway.”

“Exactly, Shinsou-kun! And your own quirk raises so many questions: what part of the mind, exactly, is affected by mind control? It’s such a broad term. Can a nonverbal response be considered a reply to one of your inquiries? Or better yet, how far can one stretch the very concept of a ‘response’ and how social interactions—”

Uraraka groaned, hands reaching up to grab at her head. “Deku-kun, please,” she groaned. “We’re still on lunch break. I can’t think about this kinda stuff.”

“It was a rhetorical question, anyway,” Shinsou added. “Quirk theory is bullshit and guesswork.”

It definitely wasn’t bullshit and guesswork, but Izuku wasn’t going to argue with someone taking his side. He wanted this absurd All For One theory brushed under the rug, and then he wanted to throw the whole rug out, and then ideally burn the room the rug had been in. Metaphorically.

“I don’t know enough about quirk theory to argue with that,” Todoroki said. He looked vaguely constipated, but maintained his absurd level of handsomeness nonetheless.

“Don’t worry about it!” Izuku replied. “In fact, stop thinking about it at all!”

The other boy hesitated, but ultimately nodded his head.

“I guess...I guess I will retain my position as the head of the All Might Is Midoriya’s Secret Father club. Although, perhaps we don’t need a club, since you’re admitting it now.”

“You really, really don’t need a club,” Izuku agreed. “You never did. There shouldn’t have been one and there shouldn’t be one. No clubs or conspiracies needed!”

“Hm.”

Izuku let out a breath he’d been holding. Sure, Todoroki still seemed to be thinking about his classmates’ ridiculous club, but he was accepting the story. And the others were wearing expressions of unfazed acknowledgement.

“Thanks for not freaking out too much,” Izuku said. “Especially about this, we really value our privacy.”

“Of course!” Iida hurriedly agreed. “A close connection to the former Symbol of Peace is something that would require a great amount of discretion.”

“We’ll keep quiet about it, Deku-kun,” Uraraka said. She looked slightly guilty. “Sorry for bugging about it so much, before.”

Shinsou huffed. “We’re gonna have to check with the other club members before we dissolve. Will we have to refund membership dues?”

“...Please tell me that’s a joke, Shinsou-kun.”

“Is it?” said Shinsou.

Todoroki sighed. “I enjoyed being in a club with friends at school,” he admitted. “I’ll miss the experience, but now that our theory is correct, it seems weird to have a club dedicated to Midoriya-kun’s family.”

“It was weird the whole time,” Izuku groused.

“Midoriya-kun, please,” said Iida, frowning slightly. “Your classmates put a lot of hard work into our—er, their club.”

Todoroki stood up. “As the former club president,” he said solemnly, “I feel I have a duty to inform the others that our club is dissolving.”

Then, to Izuku’s unending horror, he cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled across the cafeteria.

(He had never heard Todoroki raise his voice above a slight shout in the heat of battle. That in itself was enough to draw attention.)

“Kaminari-kun!”

The phenomenon of Todoroki’s raised voice was enough to dim conversation across the cafeteria. Near the edges of the room, the business and general education students paused with utensils half raised to their mouths in bemusement. Kaminari perked up at the table nearest to them.

(There was no need to yell. They were right there. Why couldn’t Todoroki just - just be normal and walk to the others’ table.)

“Yeah, bro?” Kaminari shouted back. He looked inappropriately delighted to be speaking with Todoroki in this manner; he’d swiveled his body around in his chair and put his own hands against his mouth, his voice naturally carrying significantly more than the other boy’s.

Any lingering chatter from the other tables in the cafeteria muffled and died. Izuku faintly recognized a spark of interest in some of the business students’ eyes at the spectacle unfolding in front of them.

(One of them—with slicked blonde hair and sharp black eyes, who was, for reasons unknown, wearing a three piece suit instead of their required uniform—pulled out a notepad. The other business students surrounding him suddenly seemed to materialize tablets and laptops, fingers primed and at the ready.

Izuku suddenly realized why his own classmates were so disconcerted by his notebook hobby.)

“Midoriya-kun has confirmed our initial theory,” Todoroki said loudly, “so he’s requesting we shut down the club.”

“What?!”

It was obviously a rhetorical question, but Todoroki was not a rhetorical boy.

“Midoriya-kun confirmed that All Might is his father,” he called, carefully enunciating his words like the issue with his previous statement had been its inflection. “Thus, he wants us to stop ‘making things weird’ and shut down our club dedicated to the previously unconfirmed theory that he is All Might’s illegitimate love child.”

You could hear a pin drop. Izuku did, in fact, hear a pen clatter to the floor from the heralding blonde business student.

“Whoa, really?” Kaminari grinned, sparks flashing off the tips of his hair. “Hell yeah, Todoroki-kun! We so called it!”

He pumped a fist in the air. Kirishima, from his left, sniffled loudly. “So brave,” he muttered.

Bakugou’s face was blank. He covered his mouth and screamed into his hands.

Izuku’s own face was unmoving from its mask of muted horror. His eyes darted around the rapidly mobilizing cafeteria, seeing the business students scramble to pick up their dropped notes and scribble or type away on their surfaces.

“Oh,” Todoroki added, still loud. Students around the cafeteria froze in what they were doing to focus on him again. “He requested we keep this as discreet as possible. Everyone”—he bowed to the other tables, impervious to his own gaffe—”please be tactful of the deeply personal fact that our classmate, Midoriya Izuku of class 1-A, is All Might’s son.”

“Shit,” said Shinsou, noting that Izuku had gone pale. “Midoriya-kun, were you, uh, trying to keep that on the down-low..?”

The business students had risen to their feet and were flipping through their papers and tablets full tilt, shouting and gesturing with enthusiasm like brokers at the stock exchange. “Put this on the class 3-E Twitter, stat! We have to be the first to tap into this market!” yelled the blonde business student. Another, with short brown antlers, nodded obediently. The preeminent business student tangled a hand in his hair, mussing it into disarray. “I’ll be damned if we fall behind 3-F on being the first to report this…!” he hissed.

An orange-haired girl from the same table, whom Izuku had never once spoken to in his career at UA, materialized in front of Izuku with a wide, sparkling smile—literally, in that her quirk was Sparkling Smile: her teeth caught the light in a manner that was almost blinding.

“Midoriya-chan, right?” she gushed. She didn’t wait for Izuku to reply, turning her disarmingly bright smile onto Todoroki immediately. “And Todoroki-san?”

Izuku didn’t, couldn’t reply. Blearily, he wondered why he got stuck with such an overly familiar honorific while Todoroki was granted blessed neutrality.

“Yes?” Todoroki responded politely.

He didn’t seem to notice the chaotic, miniature Wall Street that his big mouth had unleashed across the cafeteria. Kaminari was taking a selfie with one of the business students.

“You mentioned a club that unraveled Midoriya-chan’s secret connection to All Might. Tell me,” she urged, teeth gleaming white and wide in an encouraging grin, “what else do you know about this relationship?”

She made this all sound so… scandalous, almost. Izuku tried to calm himself; Todoroki had mentioned- he had mentioned being as discreet as possible. He understood the need for secrecy.

“We’re trying to respect Midoriya-kun’s privacy,” Todoroki responded. 

Izuku didn’t even have time to let his guard down.

“Don’t worry!” said the business student, Sparkling Smile broad and trustworthy across her face. “We just need to know what we have to keep private, y’know? We’ll keep it to class 3-E!”

“Oh, alright,” nodded Todoroki, and then he proceeded to run his fucking mouth. A false offer of camaraderie, and Izuku’s naive friend spilled like a broken sink.

“Wow, guys!” Kaminari yelled, waving his phone in Izuku’s direction. “Their class has 1.3 million followers on Twitter! Cool, huh?”

He didn’t like to swear, but— “Fuck,” said Izuku.

Chapter Text

For an impenetrable fortress, Tartarus had a fantastic gossip mill. 

Of course, if he were actually rendered quirkless, it would have been considerably more difficult for Hisashi to obtain the information he desired. Luckily for him, being outfitted with quirk suppression cuffs was more of a troublesome formality. 

The cuffs certainly suppressed a quirk—key word being ‘quirk,’ singular .

Really, the fact that he hadn’t dropped dead the instant they slapped the cuffs on him should’ve been enough to tip the heroes off. Without his anti-aging quirks (yes, he had more than one—it could hardly be a collection if he settled for one per function!) and a few that supported his strained respiratory system, he would have rapidly aged and suffocated the moment All Might crushed his mask.

The heroes could thank his quirk collection for not broadcasting a mummified corpse during All Might’s final stand. When he was done eviscerating them.

He had allowed the quirk ( singular! ) suppression cuffs to muffle a troublesome quirk he had obtained decades ago, one that, despite his emotional attachment, was currently far more trouble than it was worth: 

Pressurized respiratory support system plus fire breathing added up to possibly igniting his own trachea.

Not that he had done so. But if he had , well. Trial and error are the foundation of scientific discovery, and what was the point of regeneration quirks if he didn’t get to practice with them in a controlled environment? 

(Doctor Garaki would never say a word about walking in on his lethal, immortal boss choking on his own burning lungs.

Literally. He was physically incapable of mentioning the incident, thanks to a quirk that invoked oaths of loyalty. Not that the event had occurred, again, but if it had ...sworn to secrecy.)

The cuffs were really doing Hisashi a favor. 

Ragdoll’s quirk was a constant background hum. He couldn’t use it to its full potential; much to his own consternation, it turned out to be a quirk that required significant, single-minded focus and years of practice. Admirable, how the former hero had been so tactful in utilizing the quirk, but—despite having more free time than ever before, thanks to his pseudo-captivity—Hisashi was unable to properly experiment with the quirk.

The quirk mainly provided feedback on physical states, anyway. Not the most useful for monitoring the outside world, as it just gave him a lot of, “Tomura sure is decaying a lot of shit! and boy, is his skin still dry!” and, “There goes Izuku, breaking more bones. How exactly is he breaking so many bones? Who knows!”

Frustrating, to say the least. The quirk—which Hisashi had taken to calling ‘Status Effect,’ because apparently Tomura had rubbed off on him in the worst way—was more of an annoyance than anything else.

He had other observational quirks, but given that his eyes were still, ah, nonexistent...not the most useful.

Instead, he resorted to his faithful pastime: antagonizing the moralistic bastards surrounding him into revealing information.

“Ah, Inatomi-san,” he greeted at the changing of the guards. “Lovely to see you again. Or, hah, not see you.”

(He always left an opening, on statements like that. If blindness had no other perks, at least it left plentiful room for a bounty of sardonic jokes. Not that his current crowd ever showed a glimmer of appreciation for wit.)

Inatomi—a tall, broad man with a durability quirk Hisashi was raging to get his claws on—bristled outside his cell. His guards had, of course, been carefully instructed to not engage with him, but the sanctimonious dolts could never resist.

And oh, how he loved to watch them fume.

Well, not watch . Ha.

Inatomi didn’t respond, predictably. He did, however, lean in toward his mic that he kept clipped to his shirt collar, and murmur quietly to the other guard across the hall (Kawamura-san, who had a lovely set of dragonfly wings). “Gods, I just clocked into my shift, and he’s already talking to me,” he muttered.

Without hearing enhancement, one wouldn’t have known he’d spoken. Hisashi—politely playing into the idea that all three-hundred and forty-seven of his quirks could be erased by a single pair of cuffs—graciously acted as though he didn’t hear every word.

Who said chivalry was dead.

Kawamura shook her head. “You know the drill, Hikki,” she mumbled. “Ignore him. Just pretend you can’t hear him. Stay on guard, but keep—”

“—keep your head down, right,” the other guard finished. Inatomi raised a burly arm to scratch absently at the back of his head. 

There was a moment’s pause. But Hisashi couldn’t allow them more than a moment’s respite from incessant agitation if he planned on getting anything out of them. Goodness knows these boneheads wouldn’t steer the conversation themselves!

They were lucky he was here to gently shepard them to the fiery pits of their future. 

(Really, what has the Japanese government talked about since he’s been locked up?)

It was always simple work to agitate fools into impulsiveness.

“How is the family, Inatomi-san?” he asked, voice low. The guard’s heat signature rose, just a bit. “I assume your children are well. Is your wife still set up in the university hospital in Kyoto? One would hope the heroes assigned to her case would work hastily. After all, it’s not every day one deals with such advanced quirk damage!”

(Well, he dealt with it every day. But Tomura was a growing boy: Hisashi could hardly be blamed if citizens went around losing their skin.)

“Shut up,” hissed Inatomi. The guard’s breathing was heavier, and Hisashi could hear the light creaking of his leather gloves as the man clenched his hands in anger. “Do we need to issue a passive sedative, prisoner?”

“Goodness, I should hope not. Let’s change the topic to something more pleasant, if it suits you. How is the League doing in my absence?” Hisashi replied cheerfully.

“Poorly,” Kawamura said sharply. She was as visibly riled up as her partner, jaw muscles bunched in frustration. When Hisahi opened his mouth to prod the proverbial bear further, the guard cut him off immediately, barking, “No! We’re not doing this routine today. One more word from you about anything and I’m issuing the tranquilizer.”

That suited him just fine. With his guards all riled up and the league at the forefront of their minds, Hisashi settled into his restrains for his daily news.

“...Hasn’t really been a lot of activity from the League, has there?” Inatomi questioned quietly.

“Nope,” Kawamura responded. “Last we heard of them was, damn, that whole business with the Yakuza, right? That Chisaki guy?”

“Last I heard of ‘em, at least.”

Then they went quiet for a bit. Hisashi silently mourned the lack of updates; what had happened with Overhaul was at least a few months old at this point, if not older. Had Tomura really fallen so quiet? But more importantly, how was he supposed to keep himself entertained without the most up-to-date tales of societal destruction?

Fortunately, his guards did not remain silent. 

Unfortunately, they delivered unto him quite possibly the least welcome news of his 200-something years.

“Did you hear about All Might’s kid?” Kawamura asked, voice an eager whisper.

Instantly, Hisashi was on guard, and it took everything he had not to physically startle. He knew everything there was about any possible familial relation to All Might. How else was one expected to manipulate the blond bastard? As far as he had been able to find (and he was nothing less than thorough), the man had no living immediate family. 

“What? No way,” Inatomi said doubtfully. 

“Yep. One of UA’s third-year management classes posted this article about it, and of course everyone was retweeting it like crazy, and then Miyagi was talking about it on the news last night. They caught up to All Might outside of UA and he confirmed it!”

“What!” Inatomi exclaimed, and he was unable to keep his voice as quiet as before. Not that it mattered, since Hisashi was now laser-focused on this conversation.

In his quest to utterly destroy All Might, Hisashi had kept track of all of Yagi’s past romantic and/or sexual partners—by far one of the most, ugh, distasteful parts of his operation. The things one did to annihilate their enemies.

Not that Hisashi didn’t judge him for any of his past relations, because really, Nighteye? The stick up that man’s ass left little room for anything else. David Shield, well, that he could understand (lovely bright eyes and a sharp wit). But All Might only had five female partners over the course of his life, and none of them had borne any children.

All of this was normal and important information for an archnemesis to have. There wasn’t anything weird about Hisashi knowing this.

Point remaining, unless All Might had cloned himself en miniature within the last few months, Yagi didn’t have any spawn.

“Yep. They asked All Might about the Tweet, and he seemed all, I dunno, flustered. But he said something like, ‘We kept everything private to keep my family safe from my enemies,’ which, well”—the guard rudely gestured toward Hisahi—”I can see why All Might would want to hide him.”

“Him?” asked Inatomi. “So he has a son? Does his son have his quirk?”

And then one of Hisashi’s dimwitted guards uttered the words that would throw all of his carefully constructed plans out the window. 

“Oh, he does!” Kawamura responded excitedly. “He’s at UA, actually. You remember that green-haired kid from the Sports Festival, the one that fought Endeavor’s son and kept breaking his bones? Turns out he’d been struggling to get his dad’s quirk under control for years , and…”

The guards kept talking, inane rumors droning in the background, but Hisashi didn’t truly hear another word of it.

Because they were talking about Izuku . His family, whom he had distanced himself from for their own safety.

It was only after Hisashi heard his son’s name at the Sports Festival that he’d learned that his son—who should be quirkless—had been wielding immense strength, and realized that Izuku must have fallen into Yagi’s clutches.

If Hisashi hadn’t given him a quirk, there was only one other transferable power Izuku could have stumbled upon.

Extremely inconvenient, profoundly enraging, but he could deal with it. That plan had even grown to encompass his stay at Tartarus. Hisashi would allow the boy some time to grow into his own strength, let Izuku experience the downfalls of heroic society, and give Tomura plenty of time to build up a strong, independent league. Tomura knew not to kill All Might’s successor.

Once Izuku was an adult and thoroughly disenchanted with the heroics industry, Hisashi would welcome his son back into the family business of dismantling society. 

It was far from a perfect plan, particularly given that a large portion of it involved Hisashi himself being bored out of his mind and chained to a damn gurney, but it would put the pieces where they needed to be. He would have a more confederated league, Tomura would be forced to mature, and his son would be strong and embittered, ready to discover his legacy and stand at his side.

Yagi had infuriated Hisashi, standing against him time and time again, but for him to try to claim Izuku as his own son … 

Well, as the kids would say (he was pretty sure—he was probably at least a few decades behind the latest slang): it was fucking on .

“This has been fun,” Hisashi said, startling his two guards so badly they fumbled the guns in their hands. Quickly recovering, they both pointed their muzzles toward his bound form. Hisashi grinned. “Your hospitality leaves quite a lot to be desired, but I suppose that’s part of the establishment’s theme. All in all, I think I would rate Tartarus...a solid six out of ten! Very secure, stunning avant-garde design, but comfort is where Tartarus truly falls short.”

“Silence, prisoner,” one of the guards barked, but Hisashi had stopped really paying attention to them. As fun as it was to antagonize his enemies (and, oh, it was fun), he had sensed one of the guards pressing the button that would release the chemical tranquilizer.

No matter. Hisashi had obtained a quirk that would allow him to filter out toxins from his bloodstream back in his early 60s, after a rebellious underling had attempted to poison him. Some lessons were more painful to learn than others, particularly the ones that involved Hisashi foaming at the mouth while Doctor Garaki had his stomach pumped.

He’d quickly hunted down a quirk he called Antidote, after he had finished removing the failed assassin’s head from his body.

Ah, the rose-tinted memories of youth. Or maybe that was blood-tinted. Whatever.

Usually he would allow the tranquilizer to take effect, just to add some legitimacy to his poor-restrained-prisoner performance, but he had a son to reclaim.

It was always fun showing the heroes exactly where they had gone wrong. In this case, by helpfully exhibiting that quirk suppressing cuffs only suppressed a quirk, singular. They should be thanking him for such a useful learning experience—after all, there were other villains out there with more than one quirk!

(All of which he was, of course, responsible for. Details, details.)

Slipping out of the restrains was simple: he had obtained a quirk that allowed his body to transform entirely into amorphous sludge from the villain that had so insolently thought to attack his son, which he’d stolen shortly after the man had been imprisoned. 

It was as simple as collapsing into a pile of impact-resistant goo, which harmlessly absorbed and spat out the bullets they frantically shot at his fom. Hilarious. Once he was free of his bindings, it was a cinch to escape swiftly through the unavoidable air ducts. 

Alarms blaring, Tartarus became one prisoner lighter. Hisashi was even courteous enough to leave his two useful guards alive.

To use a youthful colloquialism: All Might could come at him, bro . Ha.

Once Izuku explained to Todoroki why, exactly, what he had shouted had single-handedly thrown Izuku into the darkest timeline, the other boy was appropriately apologetic.

“I’m sorry,” he said, finally, finally seeming to understand why Izuku had hoped to keep things quiet. “To be honest, I wasn’t thinking about your safety. It’s All Might . In my mind anyone close to him is still untouchable. I’m not entirely used to him being….deflated.”

“Don’t use that word,” Izuku said, frowning. He fought back the instinct to defend All Might’s virtue. Todoroki didn’t mean anything bad , he was just. Bad at talking. “He’s still pretty strong!”

“Is he?” Todoroki asked. “He looks like pipe cleaners wrapped in skin.”

“He has bones!”

“But bones may be all he is,” Todoroki said sadly.

“He has one whole lung and both his intestines!” Izuku argued, like he was making some sort of point and not digging himself a nice deep hole. “Besides, two lungs—that’s always been sort of excessive , right? He’s just...a streamlined human being.”

“Highly concentrated All Might,” Todoroki mused.

Izuku would grasp whatever measly olive branch he was offered. “Exactly! My point is, he’s- well, he’s not fine, he has so, so many health problems, but he’s not defenseless. He’s still All Might.”

“Shrink wrapped All Might.”

Wavering, wanting to defend his mentor further but knowing Todoroki didn’t not have a point, Izuku sighed and nodded. “He’s vacuum sealed. Still strong, but since he’s lost his power and retired, my mom and I are at risk.”

“Sorry,” Todoroki repeated. He looked almost embarrassed. “Explaining one’s relationship to one’s father is how I try to build connections with people. That aside, those 3-E students seemed so nice. They said they’d keep it to their class…”

“I know it is, Todoroki-kun.” Who could forget their first, proper conversation, wherein Todoroki provided Izuku with all of his personal history short of his social security number. “And the class wasn’t lying, exactly,” Izuku continued. He pulled out his phone and loaded his Twitter, navigating to their profile. “It’s just that their definition of ‘keeping it to their class’ is ‘we’re going to publicize and market this as a class to our 1.3 million followers.’”

Todoroki took his phone from him, scrolling further and frowning down at the screen. “Are those...t-shirts?”

“....What.”

The door to 1-A blasted open (literally) as Bakugou slammed his own head into the door with a technique Izuku had hitherto never seen: he was a fuming, sweaty mess, and he must have somehow used the sweat from his forehead to headbang open the entrance…

“Kacchan is amazing,” Izuku couldn’t help but mutter. Reflexive, at this point.

“You’re still in deep shit,” Bakugou shouted toward Todoroki, hands catching himself on a front row desk. Red eyes narrowed in, razorsharp. “Oi, Deku, did you rip into that fucker for snitching yesterday?”

Bakugou had been the avenging archangel to rescue Izuku from yesterday’s lunchroom chaos. He had eventually overcome his fuming disbelief and dragged Izuku out of the cafeteria, sparing him from the overeager questions 3-E kept throwing at him.

They had arrived back to their classroom early, and Bakugou had rushed to the window, thrown it open, shoved his head outside, and yelled an ear-splitting “FUCK THIS SHIIIT!” loudly into the outside world.

Izuku had not addressed the screaming. It was a harmless, healthy outlet. Relatively speaking.

Izuku sighed, leaning back into his chair. Todoroki mutely handed him his phone back with a tiny bow, eye diverted in shame. From the front row, Bakugou’s eyes tracked Todoroki’s shrinking, guilty form with prejudice.

“He didn’t mean it like that ,” Izuku argued. He frowned down at his phone where—yes, those were t-shirts, what the hell. “Todoroki-kun just connects with others by bringing up family trauma.”

“Well, what he meant doesn’t fuckin’ matter, ‘cause now even All Might is getting hounded with this shit.” Bakugou gritted his teeth. “You saw it, right? Auntie—”

“Yeah,” Izuku sighed, remorse curdling in his gut. Reporters had tracked his mother down at home to ask her about what 3-E had posted and Toshinori had summarily confirmed. His mom had, of course, gone red and stuttered out an angry request for privacy, before slamming the door in their faces.

Earlier this morning, in response, Toshinori had made one more short (and deeply embarrassed) appeal at the entrance to UA to respect “his family’s” discretion. When a reporter had tried to probe further, he’d only been able to stutter out, “My boy, Izuku, he- he’s very smart, but he’s a rather shy boy, so please. Er. Be respectful of our privacy.”

Then he had bowed so low his bangs hit the ground, shaking so badly with nerves that he almost stumbled over. Aizawa had caught him by the scruff of his suit and held him up, expression world weary. 

And tired. Profoundly, soul-deep tired. An expression that pled Through some act of sheer masochism I have remained a teacher .

“He said ‘ my boy !’” exclaimed a reporter, and the throng of press had gone wild. By the end of first period, #MyBoy had been trending in Japan. Izuku restrained himself from reminding the reporters that, actually, All Might had been calling all the guys in class ‘my boy’ for the past two semesters. Publicly! It wasn’t…They didn’t have to. Y’know. Tweet about it.

Todoroki just sunk deeper into his seat. Izuku patted him delicately on the head in forgiveness. Bakugou growled in frustration and stomped to his own seat, rumbling, “Deku may have forgiven you, bastard, but I fuckin’ haven’t. Your big fuckin’ mouth is the reason All Might and Auntie have to deal with this bullshit.”

As is summoned by Bakugou’s rage, the rest of their class burst into the room in a flurry of chaos. Lunch must be over, Izuku thought—not that Izuku planned on eating in the cafeteria again anytime in the near future. It was scorched earth. 

“Deku!” Kaminari hollered, grinning. He ran up to Izuku and shoved his phone up to his nose. “Look, it’s amazing! ”

It was not amazing. It was the damned t-shirts. 

Izuku carefully restrained One For All from crushing his classmate’s phone between his fingers.

Thankfully, before Izuku had to fully conceive the horror in front of him, Aizawa slouched into the room and his classmate’s scurried to their seats. Their teacher leaned on his podium, rubbing at his eyes tiredly.

“Well, I hope you’ve all had your fill of fun for the day,” he drawled. “Because as of 1:17 pm today, UA is on lockdown.”

Quiet gripped the room, the class frantically glancing between each other. Everyone scrutinized their classmates for the most guilty-looking student, primed and ready to blame someone for whatever was about to unfold.

To Izuku’s unending despair (but also deep sympathy), nearly every eye in the room turned to him.

Deep, deep in his brittle bones, Izuku already know that something…something stupid was going to happen to him.
Chapter 5
Notes:

    hhhh sowwy this is a week or so late lol, my laptop decided to finally kick the bucket last week, after roughly eight years of faithful service. rip in pieces, king. my new laptop is superior in every way.

    as always wow thank u for making me feel validated. hisashi can get it. dilf for one. not much of him in this one but next chapter is probs gonna be like all hisashi to make up for it.

Chapter Text

Despite Japan’s deadliest supervillain escaping captivity over their lunch break, classes resumed after Aizawa’s very brief announcement. Very brief.

“The lockdown isn’t anyone here’s fault, to my own shock,” he had said. “For once, none of you kids have done anything troublesome. It’s incredible. I’ve been praying for a day when I could say that.”

Uraraka had shakily raised her hand. “Um, sensei, if none of us have done anything”—and Uraraka’s eyes absolutely darted in Izuku’s direction, the traitor—”then why are we going into lockdown? None of the alarms have been set off or anything.”

Their teacher just waved a hand. He looked like he was preparing to recite something he didn’t particularly didn’t want to say. “Right. Guess I should tell you, since it’ll probably end up getting leaked to the news soon anyway. There’s been a breakout from Tartarus. The villain All Might fought in Kamino got out, somehow. But don’t worry,” he drawled, sounding utterly unconvinced of that directive, “The HPSC reports everything is under control.”

Izuku fell out of his chair. His classmates looked shocked at the news as well, memories of Kamino still raw in the public conscience, but Todoroki’s reaction was the strangest by far.

Todoroki stood up ramrod straight from his seat. In a terrible echo of his actions from just a handful of days ago, he raised both pointer fingers in the air and gazed between them intensely. Gaze intent, he gestured pointlessly with both fingers.

“In respect of my friend’s privacy,” he said, which was a truly horrifying way for him to begin a sentence, “I will not say what’s on my mind.”

His gaze darted and drilled into Izuku’s own from across the room. From his position sprawled on the floor, Izuku thought about reaching out with Blackwhip and breaking his dear friend’s fingers. Lovingly.

Todoroki cleared his throat, as though there was any need to garner the class’s attention when the room was already in a stupified silence. “All I will say is this. Midoriya”—again, Todoroki brought both pointer fingers together and then apart, like his fingers were connected by a taut string—”I connected them.”

Bakugou let loose a minor explosion against the surface of his desk. Snarling, he rose out of his seat to glare at Todoroki. “Oh, okay, so you didn’t learn your fuckin’ lesson, huh, Half n’ half bastard? You didn’t connect shit! ”

Kaminari stood abruptly, dashing between the two boys’ desks. He smiled nervously, holding out two flat palms as though he could keep his classmates back with an invisible forcefield. “Bakugou, dude,” he laughed, desperate and tense, eyes pleading. “He’s just joking, man. Right, Todoroki? We’re all good!”

“I don’t joke.”

Izuku curled up and hugged his knees to his chest from his position on the cold, cold floor. “Everything is normal,” he muttered quietly to himself. “I’m sure I just misunderstood Aizawa-sensei’s statement earlier. After all, Tartarus is the most secure prison in Japan, possibly the world, and with the vast amounts of safety measures in place there’s no way All For One could have escaped. It’s simply impossible. Aizawa-sensei will clarify his previous statement, and we’ll all laugh and go back to class, and maybe I’ll give All Might a hug and that will be normal too! and maybe we’ll—”

“Problem child,” Aizawa said. His tone seemed to suggest that the real tragedy was not the escape of a deadly prisoner, but rather how he was going to have to deal with it. “You didn’t misunderstand me. The villain from Kamino escaped, we’re all on lockdown, and Todoroki and Bakugou and Kaminari would you all sit down I will not ask again.”

They sat. Izuku whimpered from his comfortable ball on the floor.

“...Midoriya. Existential crises do not excuse you from my rules. Return to your seat.”

Uncurling himself from his cocoon of denial, Izuku slowly crawled back into his seat. He stared down at his desk with defeated eyes.

“Okay.” Aizawa let out a controlled breath. “Like I said: everything is under control, purportedly. Do I believe this? No, I do not, and based on your reactions, this is somehow going to involve our class in some way.”

Izuku sniffled. In a feat of strength, he held back any actual tears.

“You will all continue to attend classes,” Aizawa continued, shooting a red-eyed glare at Mina when the girl let out a disappointed, ‘aww’. “I will escort you back to the dorms at the end of the day. Everyone will stay on campus. Stay together in small groups, keep your teachers in the loop if you notice anything odd, and for godss sake, refrain from doing anything...stupid.”

With that statement, Aizawa’s tired gaze returned to the rear corner of the room, where Mina, Kaminari, and Kirishima had been subtly leaning into each other’s space and whispering. The three jolted back to sitting straight up in their seats. They attempted to look innocent, which only made them look more mischievous.

“Now. With Japan’s imminent doom out of the way, let’s return to learning.” Their teacher smiled, like he was sharing a fun joke with friends and not telling his class to ignore a genocidal maniac. Of course, when Aizawa requested their attention, it was less of a request and more of a sentencing. WIth varied levels of attention, 1-A returned to a truly electrifying lecture on property damage paperwork.

But even the banality of property taxes couldn’t spare Izuku. Despite his best efforts to become absorbed by forms and spreadsheets, Izuku became aware that someone was prodding him in the back. A furtive glance over his shoulder revealed the culprit.

Kaminari poked Izuku, gesturing to his phone. Reluctantly, Izuku turned to classmate.

“Don’t worry,” Kaminari whispered. “#KaminoVillain and #Tartarus are trending, but All Might being your dad is still the highest trending topic in Japan. You guys aren’t gonna be overshadowed by a villain, man!”

“Oh,” said Izuku. “Great. That is...exactly what I wanted, clearly.”

“I know, man,” Kaminari replied, completely disregarding Izuku’s lifeless inflection. He grinned at Izuku and gave him a tone-deaf thumbs-up. “We were talking about putting in a bulk order for the class for some of those t-shirts, by the way! So far we’re thinking about the one that has both you and All Might’s faces on it, but there is this really cool alternate print that says, ‘Mighty Family!’ which is really cool, right? What’s your size? We’ll—”

With a garbled, choking wheeze, Kaminari was cut-off. Aizawa’s capture scarf mummified him from the nose down, their teacher’s glare red in their direction.

Izuku looked at his constrained classmate with a sense of detached, floating peace.

“Kaminari.” Aizawa managed to look disappointed; Izuku was impressed, as he’d thought the man had long given up on having any expectations for their class at all. “You’ll be on clean-up duty tonight. Midoriya, the only reason you’re not also being punished is because I can tell that whatever he said was punishment enough.”

Izuku nodded, eyes fixated on the order form clearly visible on Kaminari’s phone from where the boy’s hand stuck out of his scarf-cocoon. He couldn’t help but fixate on where Present Mic and Toshinori had both added in their own sizes. Traitors.

(He ignored the part of himself that desperately wanted to add his own size to the order, because, hey, it’s still new All Might merch! Even if it was merch built on a dumb lie, as the number one All Might fan, he couldn’t just not want the merch. These shirts cemented a new, dishonest period in All Might’s legacy! 

Not to mention, if he and Toshinori both had the same print...they would match. Matching t-shirts with All Might. Izuku’s stomach fluttered with guilty butterflies.)

The rest of the day passed in a vaguely anxious haze. Between classes, his classmates would pop over to his desk and share the latest developments in ‘his’ trending tag, chattering casually about how cool it was that he and Toshinori were ‘finally just saying it.’

Izuku was tempted to ‘finally just say’ fuck this, but he figured—with the prison break also occupying the class’s consience—Izuku cursing might be enough to overload 1-A’s sense of stability in the universe.

At least the stupid t-shirts were something harmless for the class to cling to. Harmless to everyone except Izuku, at any rate.

By the time classes were over, he felt about ready to vibrate out of his seat. He had a few questions for Toshinori, primarily about why exactly he had seen his name and size listed on the 1-A t-shirt order form, but held off on cornering the man. There was the prison break for the pro heroes to worry about, after all, so his personal drama could wait.

(But primarily because, when he had mentioned stopping by the teacher’s lounge earlier, Uraraka had uttered the words ‘delegated dad discussion,’ which was simultaneously impressive in its alliteration and also horrifying, because Mina had cheerfully responded, ‘Get that All Might triple D, Midoriya!’

To which, of course, Bakugou had promptly screamed and removed his hearing aids entirely.)

With the school on lockdown and security on high alert, Aizawa diligently escorted their class back toward the dorms. Izuku was reminded of elementary school, with his classmates forming a small, overly-energetic mob and their teacher exasperatedly trying to corral the gaggle of teenagers toward their destination.

“Don’t touch that,” Aizawa scolded, following Kirishima attempting to highfive a doorframe. 

“Don’t use your quirks in the hallways,” he chided Mina, who was attempting to skate around their small herd. 

“Management has their own dorms and will not be joining us, don’t you touch that door,” he gritted out at Kaminari, whose fist froze inches away from knocking on class 3-E’s door.

“Just like first grade,” Izuku mumbled, admiring his teacher’s visibly fraying patience. What was it about being on lockdown that caused a group of teenagers to regress roughly 10 years in their behavior?

“A fantastic question, Midoriya,” Aizawa said, and oops, Izuku realized he must have said that out loud. He flushed in embarrassment, but Uraraka just choked out a laugh and Yaoyorozu coughed into her fist, visibly suppressing a smile. Aizawa was not nearly so entertained. “You all walk this way every day after class. Why are you all acting like this is a field trip?”

Iida (who had been marching diligently directly behind Aizawa) protested, red-faced, “Not all of us, sensei!” but Mina just cackled.

“It feels kinda special when you’re escorting us in a big group, Aizawa-sensei!” she said happily.

“Special,” Aizawa repeated. From his position in the center of the controlled swarm, he was at the nexus of chaos. “A murderous, destructive villain has managed to escape from Japan’s most formidable prison, and your security escort makes you feel...special.”

“Yeah! Extra time with sensei!” Mina cheered. Kaminari whooped in agreement, joining Kirishima in attempting to jump and slap the top of doorframes.

Aizawa looked like he was considering the ethics of throwing his students at said villain. Izuku wouldn’t blame him, at this point.

(Izuku noticed Aizawa’s phone screen as he paced beside his teacher: he had been googling bulk order leashes.)

Thankfully, with the dorms in sight, it seemed class 1-A would be spared whatever fate their defeated teacher might’ve been considering. Kaminari and Kirishima pointed at the building excitedly as though they didn’t take this exact path every single day of their lives.

Except—there was something... off .

Despite their overly-cheery mood, even his more excitable classmates seemed to notice the suddenly tense atmosphere. Their class mob shifted subtly behind their teacher, who had activated his quirk and was actively scouring their surroundings.

From their viewpoint near the front of the dorms, nothing was obviously amiss. There weren’t any plumes of smoke, no broken glass, no mobs of villains, but despite nothing visibly disturbing the area, their class had been through enough conflict to pick up on the tension in the air.

The area in front of the dorms was clear. Like a mischief of rats, their class inched forward behind their teacher. “Nothing’s there,” hissed Mina. She squinted, wriggling in impatience. “But you all feel that, right? It feels all tense, like a haunted house, or before a fight!”

“Ashido,” Aizawa scolded. His classmate drooped again, admonished. “Just because this area is clear, we can’t assume the entire campus is safe. I want all of you to head inside, and I’ll—”

“AHH! THERE!” Uraraka shrieked. She pointed aggressively toward the barred entry gates, just visible from the stoop in front of the dorms. Her hand shook as she jumped up and stood on her toes to peek at whatever disturbance she had noticed. “Sensei, at the gates—! ”

Faster than any of their class could rush, Aizawa dashed toward the gates guarding the entrance closest to their dorms. Izuku couldn’t help but admire how quickly their teacher dropped his goggles over his eyes, capture scarf at the ready, even as the rest of his class promptly ignored every direction their teacher had given them and scrambled over each other to hurry after him.

As always, Bakugou followed with a blast. Not as always, he ended up colliding into Aizawa’s suddenly-rigid back. Their teacher’s lithe build belied his strength; Bakugou flopped to the ground with a groan, while Aizawa remained standing, shooting a quick glare at the boy hunched behind him.

“What the fuck, sensei!” Bakugou grumbled. It looked like his cheek had planted onto their teacher’s elbow: he held a clenched hand up to his bruised, scowling face “The hell are you stopping for? I saw you getting ready to throw down. If some shit’s there, lemme blow it up!”

“You didn’t even see what ‘ it’ is.”

“Doesn’t matter!”

Aizawa muttered what could have been a prayer for patience into his scarf. His hair had floated back down around his shoulders in a silent signal that, whatever ‘it’ he had seen, it wasn’t an immediate threat.

Which, when Izuku noticed the aforementioned ‘it’ in question, Izuku couldn’t help but doubt.

Tied up in what could only be described as many, many layers of decorative bows and ribbons, docile and drooling on UA’s porch, was a Nomu. There was a large tag dangling from the ribbon around its neck, though it was too far away for Izuku to be able to read whatever was written on it. 

The whole thing looked like some bizarre, lumpy, demented present. A present you gave to someone you hate.

“Oh no,” Izuku muttered. He bit at his hands. “It’s stupid. I knew it was going to be something stupid.”

As his classmates noticed the monster wrapped up just past the gates, they came to similar gasps of realization. “No way,” gasped Uraraka. “It’s totally not moving!”

Kirishima frowned at it, inching closer to the gate with still-hardened skin. “Can you all read the label? I think I must be reading it wrong, but I can only read the top half: ‘This is not a threat. This is a gift.’”

“Not a threat, huh,” Aizawa murmured.

“It’s a threat to my sanity ,” Izuku said solemnly. “Look at that ribbon! That’s part of the 5th Anniversary Golden Age All Might wrapping paper set! And it’s—wrapped around a Nomu! I have to, we have to, hng. That is a collectible !”

Aizawa grabbed Izuku by the sleeve, and okay, maybe he had been moving to open the gate. But he couldn’t just...leave the All Might merch there!

“You’re not rushing at a potentially dangerous enemy for some merchandise.”

Izuku stared up at his teacher, resolute. “Sensei. Sensei, some things are worth dying for! ”

“You’re not throwing yourself to your possible death for some All Might merch, Midoriya. At least not on my watch; wait ‘til Yagi takes over babysitting duty before enacting any self-destructive tendencies.” His teacher paused, then unceremoniously grabbed Todoroki and wrapped the other boy’s hand around Izuku’s bicep. “Here. Todoroki, you’re on Midoriya duty while I assess the situation.”

Todoroki glanced down at where his fingers had been locked into place around Izuku’s left arm. He nodded.

Izuku squirmed in place, but Todoroki was unflinching and relentless. “Sensei,” Izuku begged, “Don’t tear the wrapping paper!” He paused, glancing around at his classmates self consciously. “Also, uh, you know. Stay safe, I guess.”

“It’s okay, Deku-kun,” Uraraka comforted him, her own eyes shining in excitement as she tracked their teacher’s cautious approach to the Nomu. “We know you have your priorities. Besides, that ribbon has your dad’s face on it!”

Kirishima was standing on his tiptoes, trying to peek over the gate Aizawa had deftly vaulted over. It was obvious he, like most all of their class (minus Izuku, who had priorities ), was on guard, given that he had yet to relent on his hardened skin. “Aizawa-sensei,” he called, “what’s it say, after the whole ‘not a threat’ thing?”

Despite the enduring tension, their class had steadily inched closer to where their teacher was investigating the unmoving, limp Nomu outside the UA gates. At one point, Aizawa had poked the immobile thing with a nearby sharp stick. 1-A had held their breath—and Izuku had hissed out, “Don’t make a hole in it! ” to which Kaminari had choked on a laugh—but the Nomu had remained inactive.

After a solid five minutes of testing and prodding and their teacher routinely activating his quirk (to no reaction), Nedzu trotted up to the gate, along with a wide-eyed Present Mic. Nedzu, as always, wore a placid smile.

“Well, what an interesting situation!” he chirped. Some of their class that hadn’t noticed his silent arrival yelped and startled; Nedzu didn’t react to their shock.

(Izuku was pretty sure their principle delighted in the suffering of humans, which wasn’t the most heroic quality to have, but who was Izuku to criticize? Everyone knew Nedzu’s traumatic backstory. 

Some people psychologically tormented humanity to cope.)

Aizawa seemed to decide that the gift-wrapped Nomu really wasn’t a threat. He had snatched off the attached letter and was reading the note with a tired-looking frown. With a longsuffering glance at his class and the principle, their teacher read aloud:

“‘This is not a threat. This is a gift. You heroes may also think of it as a peace offering, although yours is not the favor I wish to curry. 

‘“To my beloved son: I have never been adept at expressing affection. My own brother lamented the gift I bestowed upon him, and began a legacy targeting my defeat that you now erroneously continue. I can only hope you understand that this nullified weapon is an olive branch.

“‘You have always admired heroes, to my own consternation. I still think you are making a grave mistake, but know that when I began targeting your class, I was unaware you would be among them. When you were injured at that fateful training camp, know it was against my strict orders.

“‘This is not a threat. Izuku’”—and Izuku felt the pavement shift and fall under his feet, felt his world tilt and sway. His classmates made muffled sounds, shouts of confusion, but Izuku couldn’t distinguish anything beyond his own ringing ears—”’my dear son, this is the first of many offerings I will extend to you, to usher you back to my side where you belong.

“‘It’s all for you, Izuku.’” Finally, Aizawa looked back up at their class, at Izuku, who had slumped in Todoroki’s grip and had one knee on the pavement. His teacher’s rattled gaze sought out Izuku’s own, as he finished reading the note, “‘Signed: Your father, Hisashi ‘Shigaraki’ Midoriya.’”

Even Todoroki’s own grip failed, as his friend once more held up both of his hands. Izuku drooped to the ground completely, staring ahead blankly at the (still priceless) vintage All Might-themed ribbon.

(Must not be too difficult to collect all the rare All Might merch when you were already over a century old by the time the hero debuted. Old and already dead set on destroying said hero.)

“I really, really connected them,” Todoroki said, gaze intense on his own hands. Vaguely, Izuku noticed his friend had pulled a spool of red thread from his pocket—which, god, had he just been carrying that around waiting for some kind of reveal?—and had twisted two ends between his fingers. “I connected them.”

“Bleurghh,” Izuku said intelligently.

Kaminari shuffled awkwardly, glancing between his classmates’ shocked and confused expressions. “Uh,” he said. “I thought All Might was your dad, Midoriya? Although, I’m gonna be real here: I didn’t understand half the words in that letter.”

“He said something...about curry, at some point?” murmured Mina. She looked just as lost as Kaminari, and Izuku didn’t plan on correcting her.

His own head had traitorously connected the same damn, stupid threads Todoroki had daintilly planted in his mind. Shigaraki, Midoriya, cut-out faces in a photo album, bizarre happenings with One For All, tied up Nomus on their god damn doorstep. A bunch of fucking red-ass string. Mercifully, even as Izuku’s thoughts tied up into a damning picture, his head rang in silence.

(Would it be weird to ask- well. Did this mean he got to keep the wrapping paper?)

Hisashi patted himself on the back for a job well done.

Look at him, Time Magazine’s Dad of the goddamn Year, giving his son a collector’s item themed with his nemesis’ ridiculous, grinning face, despite the fact that digging out his old collection of All Might’s earliest merchandise—

(Which he had collected for villainous reasons. Hisashi had kept his eyes on All Might’s career since the moment Shimura had set her eyes on the brat. 

His collection of notes on Yagi’s past relationships and strict ledger of every piece of All Might merchandise was completely different from his son’s. Izuku collected All Might products as a fan. Hisashi compiled a curated record of his enemy’s career. Extremely different.)

—kept him grimacing at every turn. Ugh.

Hopefully his son understood the sacrificed Nomu as the peace offering that it was. 

After all, it was only the first step of many in making Izuku realize that his true place was at Hisashi’s side. And how hard could it be to win a teenage boy’s favor?

It couldn’t be so different from winning over Tomura’s own loyalties. He was sure of it.

Chapter Text

Hisashi was beholden to no one’s schedule and no society’s standards of courtesy. This meaning, of course, that he felt no need to alert his allies of his arrival.

If they bothered to watch the news—which, gods help him, they better have some understanding of current events—they would know he had escaped Tartarus, anyway. He had donned an impenetrable disguise following his liberation: dark shades and a medical mask, along with a generic, ugh , department store suit.

(The indignities one suffered for the sake of staying out of prison. Outside of the gaudy straitjacket he had been forced to endure while in captivity, Hisashi hadn’t worn anything this cheap in decades.

He could feel his skin crawling beneath the godawful polycotton blend .)

Disguise in place, Hisashi had allowed himself a brief stroll amongst a mob of unknowing citizens. It was imperative to stay on top of the news cycle, after all. How could he properly rule over a people if he didn’t know what concerns dominated the general consciousness? Not to mention, he needed to know just how erroneous the heroes were in their mad scrambling to locate him.

Which—really, what did they expect to do if they did find him? Who did they think they could send to restrain him now that All Might was out of commission? Endeavor ?

He had to laugh.

His breakout from Tartarus took a couple hours to hit the major news stations, no doubt the result of the Commission trying desperately to spin and wrangle the story into the least damning report they could manage. He could never help but admire just how devious the Safety Commission was in its overarching domination of the heroics industry, but at the same time, well, they were his mortal enemies and his plans did target their fiery downfall.

Within three hours of his escape, however, not even he himself could have prevented the media from blasting the scandal of the year. Well, second major scandal of the year.

For his sanity’s sake, Hisashi was trying to compartmentalize away the rumors that had led to his breakout in the first place. If there was one good thing that came out of having all of Japan’s eyes on the lookout for him, it was that they would, gods willing, stop talking about Yagi’s stupid, enraging lies about his relationship to Izuku.

If they wanted a scandal, oh, we would give them one, damn it . And all the more scandalous for its authenticity.

It was fun to watch the ignorant populace around him stare wide eyed and gaping at the screens around him. There were murmurings and uneasy shifting all around him, as people made their way home or (for those with a lack of self preservation) chose to ignore the red-bannered warnings flashing across a multitude of news stations and go about their mundane lives.

To his own consternation, the media had already assigned him a shortened moniker: the Bastard of Kamino .

The downside of keeping his real villain name a hushed whisper amongst the underworld for generations. Hm. He would have to release a damned statement.

After he finished killing Yagi twice , because apparently the media had come up with the name after asking All Might about whom exactly he had defeated at Kamino, and the idiot, sweaty and anxious, had responded, “What, that bastard?”

It was clear he needed to return to his organization and corral them into a sense of order quickly. The faster he could stop the media from plastering screens with bright graphics exclaiming the dangers of the Bastard of Kamino, the better. It was not the impression he wanted to give Izuku: he had spared his guards for a reason. He could be polite .

Common courtesy aside, Hisashi didn’t presently have a way to alert his followers of his location. All of his belongings had been either teleported away by Kurogiri or annihilated when his warehouse in Kamino had collapsed into rubble. He had no doubt that his backup Nokia had survived, given that it had somehow endured his first beatdown from All Might six years ago without anything more than a cracked screen, but its whereabouts were another matter entirely.

Not that he really needed it. There were only so many places Tomura could be hiding out, and his protege was many things, but innovative was certainly not one of them.

That being the case, Hisashi made his way to the hideout he had set aside that he knew for a fact had the fastest internet connection. If the boy prioritized nothing else, a strong WiFi signal was paramount. 

(When he had described some of his many hideouts to Tomura, this one stood out in particular because—when Hisashi had dutifully shown him the results of the internet speed test the boy had demanded from each secret location—Tomura had described the results as ‘poggers.’ He wasn’t entirely sure he knew what that meant, but given that it had enticed a truly chilling smile from the boy, he was pretty sure it was a good thing.)

Without his favorite warp quirk, he dutifully made his way to the dilapidated building 300 miles south of Musutafu. The best place to hide was just shy from under your enemies’ noses, after all.

It didn’t take too long to arrive: he was without Kurogiri’s quirk, certainly, but he had access to many others that made relocating much easier than it would be without a quirk’s assistance: a very short-range teleportation and speed quirk hastened the process. Unfortunately, Sludge Transport, which he had utilized at Kamino, did not work on one’s self, had a limited radius, and was very disgusting and should be avoided whenever possible.

Within three hours of his escape, he had arrived at the hideout he was 90% sure Tomura would have chosen.

He owned the building, and thus felt no need to knock.

Which apparently wasn’t necessary at all, because—although the location was obviously correct, given the dishes piled in the sink and the quietly droning TV buzzing in a side room—nobody was at the entrance.

No guards. No watchmen. No Kurogiri. Ugh, what had he been teaching this boy?

A quick scan of the building using his heat signature quirk revealed that the side room was occupied, despite Hisashi’s first glance. He crept into the room and peered over the edge of the sofa, noting the snoring figure of Spinner, asleep and prone and utterly undefended in front of the TV.

Wasting electricity , Hisashi thought with a scowl. If you were just going to fall asleep , at least turn off the television. Who did these brats think was paying the electricity bill around here?

He switched off the TV. Spinner, predictably, did not wake.

Hisashi did not stab him. This was very courteous of him.

The unwatched TV burning through electricity wasn’t the only wasteful attribute to catch his attention. From the moment he walked in, Hisashi had been unable to ignore the chilly temperature of the compound. He felt a shiver run over his skin.

Heat Signature informed him that the building was kept at a cool 63 degrees. Unacceptable.

He strode to the hallway, quickly finding the thermostat. With his lack of eyes, he wasn’t able to read the thermostat display, but he was absolutely able to click the up arrow several times. Then several more.

Again, who did they think was paying the damn bills around here?

With his frugal instincts satisfied, Hisashi finally proceeded to the first order of business: finding his protege. Tomura was, as always, easy to find, even in a multistoried warehouse with more spare rooms than an evil mastermind knew what to do with. Hisashi was blind, but he wasn’t deaf.

And Tomura certainly wasn’t...quiet.

Gods help him, Tomura wasn’t quiet. He was, unfortunately… a gamer .

From his position at the foot of a staircase on the ground floor, Hisashi could hear echoes of enraged shouting. Based on the reverberations, and a larger-than-average blob of high temperature shaped vaguely like a teenager, Tomura was somewhere on the second floor, to the far right.

Up the stairs, down the hallway, and following the screams of frustration, Hisashi lingered outside of Tomura’s door. It was shut, but that did little to muffle the sounds coming from his room.

“What the fuck was that?! Are you typing with your feet? ‘Cause that’s the only excuse to mess up that goddamn badly on— fuck! Wait—”

One could only endure these gaming sessions for so long. In deference to Tomura’s ‘gamer rage,’ Hisashi knocked politely on the door. The boy barely paused in his ranting.

“Hang on, guys, it’s probably just my stupid keeper.” Through the door, he heard huffing, and a clattering that meant that Tomura had taken off his headset. “Well, Kurogiri? Get it the fuck over with so I can get back to my game!”

Hisashi opened the door, smiling beatifically. “Are you winning, Tomura?”

Wide-eyed, Tomura disintegrated his controller with a shriek. He flailed and scrambled forward off his chair, falling to the floor. Unfortunately, he was so rattled that he forgot to lift a finger, and—palms flat on the floor—Tomura summarily dusted a wide hole in his bedroom, through which his arms dropped and sent him, flailing, to a faceplant.

“Oops. My apologies, Tomura. I did knock.”

“S-Sensei?! How are you—when! I, uh, I didn’t mean to cuss at you, Sensei.”

Hisashi sighed. “If you had been watching the news, my boy, you would have seen my breakout from Tartarus dominating the headlines. But I can see you have been...distracted.”

For a pale, pasty boy, Tomura could turn an alarming shade of red. “I’ve, uh. I was winning, Sensei.”

“Winning on the battlefield, as a formidable villain? Or…?”

“On...Overwatch.”

His expectations were low, but sometimes Tomura managed to slide below them anyway.

After Tomura had cleaned up the remains of his controller (the boy had a collection of them, stashed in the back of his closet, due to his unfortunate habit of descending into a rage mid-game and dissolving his belongings), Hisashi gathered the boy in a previously shut room he had anticipated being his own before he had been locked away in Tartarus. Shamefaced, still, his successor summoned Kurogiri to the room as well.

To Kurogiri’s credit, the man only flickered rapidly in a tall flume of purple, shape briefly lost in shock, when he saw Hisahi standing casually next to Tomura.

“Sensei,” he said shakily. “I suppose I should have expected your presence soon, given what I saw just moments ago on the television.”

Tomura scoffed, looking at the ground. Hisashi smiled, just barely.

“Well, I’m glad some of you keep up to date with national crises! Now, before I address anything else—Kurogiri. Prior to Kamino, I had you store away a few spare support masks made by Doctor Garaki. If you would retrieve one for me, now, please.”

He liked to add please to the ends of his demands, as though they were a polite request that could be disobeyed. Technically, his followers could disobey, in theory. They would just die. But the option was there, technically.

“Of course.” With a swirl of dark purple fog, the man stepped away briefly. Tomura looked up at Hisahi with a look of concern.

“Sensei...you still need the mask? How are you…”

Hisashi huffed. “You really think the heroes would have managed to heal me more successfully than Doctor Garaki had managed? Or that they would bother? ” He sneered. “No, they had me hooked up to an ancient ventilator during my stay in Tartarus. I am still injured and blind.”

“Then how—” 

“I can manager a few hours like this, but not much further.” He smiled grimly. “Within another hour or so, my lungs would collapse, and I would begin suffering major organ failure. Hence why it was vital to return to you as quickly as possible.”

Tomura’s eyes went wide and—dare he say it?—concerned. Ah, the boy so rarely showed emotion outside of his Thirteen Flavors of Anger, it was worth allowing a bit of vulnerability just to elicit it.

Nothing like a show of strategic weakness to endear your emotionally-dependent followers to you!

Kurogiri returned, carrying a heavy, metallic black replacement ventilating mask, which he handed reverently to Hisashi. He removed the (ugly, tacky, not even brand name ) shades and hat with a sigh of relief, hooking up the complex equipment with practiced ease. For the first time since he dissolved into slime and escaped his prison, Hisashi took a deep, easy breath.

His followers, the obedient little ducklings they were, waited for him patiently. Good. A few months of captivity hadn’t undone years of hard earned conditioning.

“I have some important tasks for Tomura,” Hisashi began. He directed his gaze (nonexistent though it was) toward Kurogiri. He may not have eyes, but he knew his attention held weight. “I have a specific task for you. There is a box of materials in my personal belongings that you will use to wrap and restrain a Nomu. Any will do. Once you have completed this, return to me. I have a letter to deliver along with the Nomu.”

Kurogiri didn’t have eyes in the traditional sense, but the ‘eyes’ he did have were just as easy to read. They went wide, and the edges of his smoky form flickered in confused tension. It was obvious the man wanted to ask questions, but a threatening tilt of Hisashi’s head had the man bowing and stepping out once more.

Tomura did not have the same social graces.

“Sensei, why are you, uh, delivering the Nomu? And where?” Tomura asked. His eyebrows were furrowed and a hand reached up to scratch at his neck in perturbed anxiety.

(Now that was a habit he would need to train the boy out of before moving forward with his plan. Hisashi had allowed the disorder because, frankly, excoriation was unnerving enough in combination with his successor’s quirk to serve as a sort of peculiar intimidation tactic. But since plans had changed, all he could think about was how...unsightly the poor boy tended to treat himself. Inko and Izuku would not appreciate the behavior.)

His successor stared up at him in respectful but confused questioning, and Hisashi knew that he needed to tread carefully.

Tomura was...a temperamental boy. Territorial, certainly, and the last thing Hisashi wanted to do was make the boy jealous of Izuku’s position as Hisashi’s son. Part of Tomura’s indoctrination involved having him see Hisashi as a sort of father figure, a parental savior lifting him from destitution. Introducing a biological family would mean introducing possible competition.

The best way one could prevent any familial jealousy would be to incorporate the insecure member into said family. Simple enough, right?

“Tomura,” Hisashi began, tone as genial as he could manage, “have you ever wanted a brother?”

By the time Kurogiri returned, bound and stupefied Nomu in tow, Hisashi had gingerly introduced the idea that he had a family to his successor. The boy had, impressively, only turned two whole inanimate objects into dust in a jealous fit.

Progress. Dusting inanimate objects, instead of very much animate beings, was progress.

“Who is it,” Tomura wheezed. “Sensei’s family.”

His successor’s stare was intense and longing, now, instead of heated and furious. This was also progress. He could move forward with longing.

Kurogiri started, looking at Hisashi in alarm. Hisashi remained tranquil, hoping that the serenity he was oozing would spread via osmosis into Tomura’s bloodstream. Unlikely, given that Tomura had managed to somehow increase the fervor with which he scritched at his neck, but Hisashi could hope.

Sometimes, when dealing with Tomura, hopes were all he had.

With red, sharpened claws, Hisashi reached toward the Nomu. Fingers sank through its reinforced skin like a knife as he swiftly disarmed the beast. Certain quirks needed to remain for it to maintain its recognizable, monstrous form, but those were passive mutations. For this Nomu to be the gift it needed to be, Hisashi needed to remove anything dangerous.

Which were, obviously, most of the quirks he had given it. In the end, he dismantled 14 quirks from the Nomu, leaving it a lovely, drooling husk. In hideous ribbons.

“Lovely,” said Hisashi. Purposefully avoiding Tomura’s pressing gaze, he strode to the desk in the corner of his room; being as talented as he was, he was able to write his very important letter and speak to his minions simultaneously.

Pen flying across the (ugly, All Might themed) notepad, Hisashi continued casually, “You know, in this world, we don’t always get to choose our family.”

Tomura’s face scrunched up. He looked constipated. Kurogiri just looked nervous—he always was better at reading the atmosphere.

And the atmosphere was a little...tense. One doesn’t begin good news with a disclaimer, after all.

“Family can find you in the least expected ways. Sometimes, by an extraordinary stroke of luck, one can come across their future successor, abandoned by hero society, in a dim alleyway”—he directed his smile toward Tomura, who preened in delight at the implication that his Sensei cared for him—”and sometimes….sometimes it’s your secretary .”

And now Tomura and Kurogiri were both confused, the latter uncomfortable. Not that he disliked making his disciples squirm, but he couldn’t leave his family’s details unclear if he wanted this merger to work. As much as it could work.

Hisashi sighed, signing the note with a short flourish. “It was a simple ‘accounts management’ business I ran a couple of decades ago—naturally, it was one of my many money laundering fronts, but the low level employees didn’t need to know those details.

“I remember the day I first saw her clearly. My wife. Another grunt was hounding the poor woman for her attention while she was trying to work, panting after her. He cornered her in the stairwell. I was watching from above, and I saw it all.”

This time, when Hisashi sighed, it was unmistakably dreamy. (Kurogiri, who had never witnessed such behavior from his master, shivered.)

“Somehow he kept missing that she wasn’t interested. When he wouldn’t decease his advances, she used her quirk: she has an attraction quirk for small objects, and that day, she pulled just so on his tie…” Hisashi smiled, gazing at the fond, distant memory.

“She pulled him face first down the staircase, and he fractured his L3 through L5 lumbar vertebrae and his left arm when he tumbled to the bottom.

“It was love at first sight, really. You could say I was... head over heels .”

Tomura blinked, gaze wide in morbid fascination. The incredible pun flew over his socially stunted head. Kurogiri, who recognized but refused to acknowledge the pun, merely accepted his lot in life and focused on delicately attaching Sensei’s letter to the giftwrapped Nomu.

Hisashi shook his head, refocusing on the present and his very important point. “Anyway, one meeting led to another, and we were married with a son just two years later. When it became clear he wouldn’t inherit my own quirk, I had to distance myself for their own safety, but I never truly abandoned them.”

Visibly restraining himself, Tomura squirmed in his chair, hands carefully entwined with raised pinkie fingers. His eyes wide, he rasped, “Who is it, Sensei? I want to...I want to meet your family. I want to join them.”

And here came the part Hisashi knew was very delicate. He knew Tomura wasn’t exactly fond of Izuku, given that Yagi had infected the boy with a sickening sense of hero worship and a parasitic quirk. But he also knew not to kill All Might’s successor, so hopefully this wouldn’t come completely out of left field.

“Kurogiri,” he said, commanding the man’s attention. “Bring the box that contained the wrapping paper here, for a moment.”

The other was visibly confused, but summoned a small portal nonetheless, one arm reaching through space to pull out a dusty, hastily gathered box. His foggy grip delicately handed the supplies to his master, and Hisashi carefully sorted through the obnoxious hero paraphernalia that largely occupied the box.

Said contents did not go unnoticed by Tomura; his successor grimaced in a manner very similar to Hisashi’s own in the face of plasticy, blond grins. He had raised the boy well, but Hisashi was a man on a mission.

From the dust-covered depths of an innocuous box, Hisashi pulled out one of his most precious belongings.

Tomura squinted at the object Hisashi held reverently in both hands. “Is that, uh...a scrap book?”

“It is. It’s the scrapbook, the unedited scrapbook lovingly assembled by my family and I just months before I left them. For their own safety, I left them both a….censored version. But I couldn’t bring myself to damage the original.”

Hisahi ran a hand delicately over the glitter-covered cover. “Family is Everything,” he read darkly. “Yes, that is a lesson I’ve learned over my many years, ever since my brother…” he trailed off, a finger tracing the cursive letters on the scrapbook’s cover.

For once seeming to pick up on the mood, Tomura stayed silent, though he stared hungrily at the book in Hisashi’s hands. Kurogiri stared awkwardly at the stagnant Nomu.

“Tomura.”

The boy startled, attention flicking back to Hisashi’s face. Hisashi ‘stared’ back at the boy intensely.

“What I’m going to show you will come as a very great surprise, so for now I am going to hold the book myself. To prevent any….quirk accidents.”

His successor scowled at the floor, hands clenching, but nodded. “I’ll be careful, Sensei,” he muttered.

Hisashi smiled, not trusting that one damn bit. “Of course. It’s just that some surprises can be more emotionally intense than others, and as I mentioned before, this scrapbook is one of my most precious belongings.”

All of which was short for: your dusty hands aren’t going to touch this damn book until after you’ve had the inevitable emotional breakdown my family’s identity will cause.

Mute and obedient, Tomura nodded once more. Hisashi’s smile was a stubborn, aggressive thing. He was calm, so Tomura would be calm. He would be calm. 

The sheer pacifying vibes Hisashi was radiating would cool Tomura’s undoubtedly emotional reaction.

This being the case, Hisashi opened the scrapbook to the first page. A lovely photo of Inko and him in tailored suits, with Izuku, a smiling toddler, held between them. If the green curls and freckles weren’t damning enough, below this introductory photo were the delicately penned kanji: “The Midoriya Family: Hisashi Midoriya, Inko Midoriya, & Izuku Midoriya.”

Tomura got it quickly.

“Oh no. It’s that- that’s the All Might brat. The All Might kid I hate. Is this a test. Is this a joke? ”

Hisashi maintained his firm, flat smile. He continued to just absolutely diffuse placidity. “This is my family, Tomura. Please play nice with your little brother.”

His successor gaped at the scrapbook. “Fucking hell. This is so….”

“Not poggers?”

Tomura grimaced. “Not poggers.”
Chapter 7
Notes:

    ahh y'all got me blushy happy at all the positive comments on this. this will probs be the last hisashi POV for a bit, just cause we do need to get back to Our Boy. next chapter, next chapter. for now, back to this bitch that had a lot to say about all might in the press...hisashi, what's good.

Chapter Text

After Tomura finished his modest breakdown, Hisashi felt more confident about his next steps in his extensive plan.

Firstly, he had Kurogiri deliver the carefully wrapped and disbled Nomu. He deliberately attached his letter to Izuku (by fusing it into the defunct Nomu’s flesh, a process which entailed only a teensy amount of blood), then dispensed Kurogiri with his peace offering. Hisashi felt rather like a military spouse waving their loved one away into battle, hopes desperately wished alongside their departure.

One couldn’t be a supervillain without a taste for the dramatics. He didn’t even have to try.

Next, Hisashi needed to begin rebuilding the bridges he had burned to protect his family so many years ago. He couldn’t simply barge in on his wife apropos nothing—he didn’t want to end up with a fractured vertebrae like his unfortunate ex-employee, after all—so he needed to give his beloved family a heads up, so to speak.

Specifically because his own head was still kind of...fucked up.

It was a work in progress. Hisashi was, obviously, aware of the young girl that the heroes had rescued from the Hassaikai just months ago: the guards to his cell couldn’t avoid discussing the raid on the old Yakuza hideout after Hisashi gently herded them into the topic. 

What a quirk that young girl had! Hisashi couldn’t restrain himself from probing for more details, a verbal nagging which led to Hisashi being flooded with massive doses of sedatives.

His guards said he had it coming. Victim blaming, in Hisashi’s mind. He couldn’t help his natural, innocent sense of curiosity.

(Even if his curiosity entailed questions about the truly gruesome, gory details of the torture of a small child. It’s not like he endorsed such barbaric practices, but if the science was already out there ...well, waste not, want not.

He had only ever experimented on one child, and that Tsubasa brat had it coming. Hisashi’s hands were as clean as it got, for a centuries-old mastermind.)

Despite that minor setback, Hisashi had obtained enough information about the girl’s quirk that he had his doubts about its effectiveness. The girl could rewind and reshape matter, but she was, as much as anyone in their quirk-laden world, constrained by the laws of thermodynamics. She could reverse and repair, but she couldn’t recreate mass that no longer existed; it was why she could ‘shrink’ or deage those she grasped, but she couldn’t spin them into health or recreate decimated organs. Thus, Hisashi truly doubted that the quirk would be able to restore his eyes without the sacrifice of, well, a similar piece of organ matter, which no thank you, he— 

“Sensei,” Tomura mumbled, eyes darting furtively around the crowded mall. “You’re mumbling again.”

“Oh, dear.” Indeed, a few heads were craned awkwardly in his and Tomura’s general direction. Hisashi hadn’t realized he’d been theorizing out loud. His hand had even reached up to tap at where his mouth had been running beneath his medical mask.

Some habits were hard to break. Whatever. You’d think people weren’t used to hearing about blood and organ matter or something. Everyone was made of organs! The public just had some growing up to do.

Still, for the sake of blending in (as much as one could when bulkily covering an industrial mask with a hat, shades, and medical mask), Hisashi restrained his natural, innocent curiosity.

“Thank you, Tomura,” he said, a bit belatedly. “I appreciate you looking out for me.” In an effort to encourage his successor’s sense of attachment and to play into their outward appearance of father and son, Hisashi reached out and patted Tomura on the head.

Tomura, whose distinctive hair was tucked into a beanie, ducked his head further into his scarf, blushing. The boy really took after him in so many ways. Mainly in his lack of empathy and hatred of hero society, yes, but also in being flustered by outward displays of affection. Thankfully, with Izuku’s savior complex and Inko’s natural maternal tendencies, Tomura’s blatant unfamiliarity with acts of kindness would work in their favor.

Hisashi didn’t even know he was planning ahead when he refrained from providing Tomura with healthy emotional affection. It must have been his experienced mind subconsciously scheming—he was just that good .

More cheerful, Hisashi allowed himself to leave a familiar hand on Tomura’s shoulder. If the boy ducked any further into his scarf, he’d end up walking into a pole. Hisashi deftly steered him along through the crowd.

Eventually, Tomura recovered enough of himself to raise his head back up and glance around. “Where exactly are we headed, Sensei?” he asked quietly. His successor scrutinized the crowded mall they were navigating with visible distaste. The poor boy was never one for crowds.

TVs on display in store windows still presented vibrant, scrolling warnings about the escape of the Bastard of Kamino, talking heads warning the public of staying alert, but, roughly a day having passed since Hisashi’s escape, the public was already glancing over the warnings. An immense threat to the country’s safety could only hold the interest of hero society for a couple dozen hours—with deadly villains being a daily occurrence, Hisashi’s breakout from Tartarus was delegated to a political issue only hours after he failed to show up and demolish Tokyo.

And so, barely a day after Hisashi’s escape, the people of Japan were once more faithfully crowded into shopping malls. Bless them, Hisashi thought fondly. It was so terribly easy to disappear into a crowd.

Tomura clearly did not share his fondness for the ignorant masses. His successor stared at one of the TVs flashing through a montage of All For One’s last battle against All Might, frown intense on his face, then stared up at Hisashi’s own impenetrable disguise. One gloved hand (Hisashi had made the boy put on soft knitted gloves to prevent him from clawing his neck raw) gestured at Hisashi’s shoddily adorned cover-up.

“Everyone’s stupid,” he said with disgust. 

“They sure are!” Hisashi agreed fondly.

He patted the boy’s shoulder again, in a terribly good mood and refusing to let Tomura’s teenage angst get him down. Continuing to steer the two of them through the familiar mall, Hisashi answered Tomura’s earlier question. “My last phone was completely demolished in my battle against All Might,” he stated. “I need to give Inko some warning about my appearance before I show up at her front door, given my current, hm, lack of face. And, of course, I want to make contact with Izuku to begin building a dialogue. What with me being his idol’s mortal enemy, we can assume things could...get off on the wrong foot.”

Tomura scowled. “Fucking All Might. Fucking hero society propoganda bullshit,” he hissed. Hisashi couldn’t bring himself to reprimand his language, because hey, fuck All Might. His successor shook his head, strands of blue-white hair coming free from the beanie. “I’m excited to meet your family, Sensei,” he continued, “I met that All Might kid before, but that was before I knew he was my little brother. And the foot was all wrong.”

He didn’t correct Tomura’s attempt at a metaphor. It was close enough. “I know it was, Tomura. You’ll have time to correct that mistake, and Izuku is a forgiving boy.” 

Gods knew Hisashi was depending on that forgiving demeanor.

“When I’m done with him—uh, done bonding—we’re gonna be so close. He’ll call me big brother and everything. I’ll help him realize that heros are bullshit, and we’ll play video games together, and I’ll turn all the people he doesn’t like to piles of dust.”

Tomura really was such an affectionate boy at heart. Still. “I don’t doubt that you will, my boy. But remember: indoctrination is a process , not a single action. He may well never completely come to see our (correct) way of thinking.”

At the word ‘indoctrination,’ Tomura’s face had pinched up in displeasure, or maybe confusion. Hisashi needed to remember to taylor his vocabulary. Maybe if he related it to video games again…?

“It’s like he’s a console gamer,” Hisashi tried. “Uh. You can explain why PC is better all you want, but at the end of the day, he’s still going to reach for the GameCube controller.”

That made sense, right? Apparently it made enough sense for Tomura, because the boy’s posture visibly relaxed as he let out a defeated sigh. “Damn. Shit’s more ergonomic, I guess. Heroes always look OP, right? So I’ll help Sensei explain that he’s nerfed himself before he even picked a class.”

Hisashi...understood about half of that terminology. Together, he and Tomura were one-half teenager, one-half Quirk Boomer. But he nodded, because he was pretty sure it sounded right. It was more about the spirit of things, anyway: play nice with your new little brother, or he won’t want to join our party.

Besides, Hisashi planned on doing most of the talking. Ideally, Tomura wouldn’t need to ‘persuade’ Izuku at all. All his successor needed to do was sit there and look sad and redeemable, playing to Izuku’s hero complex. Hell, seeming quiet and downtrodden may even be a bonus.

Arriving at a store with a wide display of phones was ultimately underwhelming, after their robust conversation about persuading family to be sympathetic for the dark side. The grotesque display of commercialism, surrounding Hisashi and Tomura with chipper shop clerks eager to steer Hisashi out of his illegally-earned yen, was enough to have Tomura shoving both hands into his pockets, shoulders up defensively.

He was the picture of teenage disillusion. Were Hisashi a merciful mentor, he would allow the boy to sulk outside and glare at each passersby, but unfortunately for him, Hisashi was blind.

Mercy was reserved for those who could, y’know, see the phone displays. Hisashi’s current disposition did not lend itself to reading.

The pitiful clerk attempting to help the two of them find a phone was starting to pick up on Tomura’s tangible miasma of antisocial rage. It didn’t help that his sloppy beanie and hoodie really completed the image of hikikomori.

And Tomura’s presence really was necessary, apparently, since every time Hisashi named a phone model he was familiar with, the clerk looked more and more uncomfortable.

“Um,” the nameless drone hedged anxiously. “That- that model is also out of production. It has been for about… a hundred years?”

“Hm.” Hisashi considered his options. “Not that I’m over a hundred years old or anything, but if I were , and if the only phones I was familiar with were all antiques, what phones would you recommend?”

“Er,” the hapless boy said, shuffling in place in visible discomfort. “Are you just. Looking for something that isn’t a smartphone? Because pretty much everything is, nowadays.”

“He’s blind , you insensitive NPC,” Tomura hissed. Not the most tactful, but Hisashi appreciated the thought.

“I can see the phone itself,” Hisashi added helpfully. “But only the shape of it. Screens are just rectangles in a heat field.”

The clerk jerked, face flushing and hands help up in deference. “O-oh, I’m so sorry! That’s, you could’ve said something. If you need something more accessible, there’s always screen readers and voice to text…?”

“Ugh, no ,” groaned Tomura.

“Oh?” said Hisashi, interest peaked. “Show me, boy.”

Someone should have told Hisashi about accessible technology years ago.

Not that he really gave them a chance, given that—after he was blinded and wounded by All Might—Hisashi had sequestered himself away behind cables and life support, only showing himself to allies and enemies alike as a voice on a screen.

One didn’t flourish in the underworld by advertising their weaknesses. None of his business partners ever knew he was blind.

Still, he could’ve been using smartphones years ago. Although Tomura didn’t seem to share in his excitement.

“Sensei, could you...turn your phone down?” he gritted out, tension in the line of his shoulders.

Hisashi glanced up at his successor. “Tomura, really. I need to hear my phone to use it.”

Tomura grimaced. “Yeah, I know. I’m not trying to be disrespectful, Sensei. But it’s just- we can hear everything you’re doing.”

Kurogiri coughed, awkwardly. Hisashi frowned down at his phone, ignoring his successor’s advice transiently. 

“Text Inko,” Hisashi directed aloud. His phone pinged in recognition, and Tomura groaned, audibly dropping his head onto the counter. “May I call you soon, question mark. I have a lot to explain before I visit in person, comma, it’s the least you deserve from me.” He paused. “Sad emoji. Send text.”

His phone chimed a confirmation. Tomura grumbled something about ‘old people’ into the wood. Hisashi deigned to ignore that—they had other things to discuss before he called Inko to arrange a family meeting. His first visit home was vital . It would be Tomura’s first attempt at integrating himself into his family’s good graces, and, most importantly, it was Hisashi’s chance to apologize to his wife and garner his son’s empathy.

It took longer than one evening to sway someone to your cause, but Hisashi could start rebuilding their relationship. He could show his son that he made a damned better father than Yagi. He would show Izuku that he would be a fantastic dad.

Losing to Yagi was simply not an option.

Hisashi pocketed his phone, turning his attention back to Tomura. Before he brought his successor to meet his wife, and before he could reintroduce the young man to Izuku properly, he needed to make sure that Tomura could use some...tact.

Unfortunately, teaching Tomura social courtesy was akin to teaching calculus to a swarm of bees.

Telling his successor to play nice led to a furrowed brow and a shaky nod, gloved hands reaching uselessly to claw at his neck in anxiety. Advising him to sympathize with his hero-hopeful son caused Tomura to nod frantically, but simultaneously growl under his breath about the damnation of hero society. Instructing Tomura to engender Izuku’s sympathy ended with Tomura not-so-discreetly Googling synonyms for empathy.

It was clear that Hisashi needed to meet the boy in the middle, so to speak.

“I just don’t get it,” the boy hissed, fists clenched in frustration. “He was bullied for being quirkless, right? Why the hell does he still like people? Why does he want to be a hero when all the heroes snubbed him?”

All of those were questions that dogged Hisashi himself—being a sadistic, cruel bastard had always made it difficult to understand his brother’s idealistic perspective—and he wasn’t entirely sure he had an answer for Tomura. What he did have, however, was experience.

Hisashi sighed in longsuffering understanding. “Of course he wants to be a hero,” he mused. “Back when I was a boy, everyone wanted to be an astronaut, or a pop idol, or a social media influencer—”

“An influenza?”

“—Ah, no. An influencer. They used to fill the void between circus clown, salesmen, and models. Don’t worry about it; I’ve managed to wipe most of them from the history books, anyway. My point is this: Izuku wants to be a hero because it’s what he’s learned to want.”

Tomura huffed. Hisashi sympathized.

“You don’t need to understand someone’s perspective to comprehend it, my boy,” Hisashi advised. Gods knew he didn’t truly understand half the shit he was able to manipulate in order to command his minions’ loyalty, but he perceived the lines of logic and emotion needed to guide the gullible to his side.

Tomura grunted. Hisashi needed a little bit more of an agreement before he moved forward.

“Think of it this way: you don’t need to enjoy the pacifist run, but playing the pacifist run is important to understanding what happens in the genocide run.”

“I guess,” Tomura muttered. “When you put it like that. I just gotta entertain them, huh? Play nice with All Might simps.”

“Very good,” Hisashi agreed, choosing to ignore the use of the word ‘simp’.

(If Izuku was a hero simp, did that make Tomura a...hero incel? After months of captivity, his sanity was already on thin ice; he would not consider it any further.)

With a bright chime, Hisashi’s phone broke into the conversation. Hands rushing to retrieve the thing, Hisashi commanded his phone to pull up his text messages. Aloud, because he literally had no choice but to use voice to text, Tomura, not everyone had perfectly functioning eyes.

One would hope his followers would be a bit more sympathetic to the plights of those disfigured by hero society. Maybe he needed to host a panel in sensitivity to those with disabilities or something.

“Phone,” he ordered, because he refused to give his phone a name otherwise. “Read the text from Inko.”

“Oh no,” mumbled Kurogiri. Rude.

A robotic, monotone voice read aloud, at his established full volume: “From Inko. It better be a damn good explanation. Our boy hasn’t heard from you in years and the first time I hear from you is after we make the news for All Might stepping up the plate. Who do you think you are. A good father—”

“Stop!” Hisashi shouted, fumbling to lock the screen. It was only a feat of perseverance that kept him from throwing his own phone to the ground and shattering it in mortification. He hadn’t blushed in years , but he could feel the blood rising to his face. 

“Oh shiiiiit,” Tomura huffed, voice obviously holding back a laugh. “Maybe you should leave the screen reader on full volume after all, Sensei. I wanna hear the rest of that.”

“Tomura,” Kurogiri chided. Despite his correction, Hisashi could hear the amusement in his voice as well.

“I wanna hear the rest of it respectfully .”

“No,” Hisashi mumbled, pushing down his internal screaming for later, when he could call his wife alone and have a very delightful conversation about his years of silence being due to a medical emergency. “No, that sounds like it will be a private conversation. I think that’s enough screen reading for today.”

“I don’t think that’s how you use it in a sentence, Sensei.”

“As the one with a visual disability, I think I will be the judge of that, my boy.” Tomura may still be respectful, but maybe Hisashi needed to torture or kill off a couple lower ranking followers in front of him to remind him that his respect should be tempered with a hint of fear, as well.

(His quirk-greedy hands twitched in impatience; he hadn’t maimed anyone in months . At this point, he may as well apply himself for sainthood.)

“Does it really county as a disability if you can still beat All Might into the dirt using Heat Sig—” Tomura started, but Hisashi cut him off. He had other, important tasks to address before he could arrange their meeting with Inko and Izuku.

“As much as I love to discuss crushing All Might like a bug,” he acknowledged, “we need to prepare you for more familial interactions.”

This seemed to be what broke Kurogiri’s veil of professionalism. His follower’s misty form wavered in a sharp blurt of laughter, hands fumbling the bottle in his grip. Tomura glared at the other man, arms crossing in a huff of indignation.

“I said I’d play nice,” he grumbled. “I wanna make a good impression for Sensei’s family.”

“And I’m sure you will,” Hisashi said kindly, lying through his damn teeth. “Think of it as...lessons in etiquette.”

“Ugh.”

“Professionalism is important for any villainous leader,” Hisashi continued, voice calm. “You can only spend so much time intimidating your own followers into compliance. If we destroyed our followers and family every time they irritated us, there would hardly be anyone left in Japan!” Hisashi chuckled.

Tomura nodded. Kurogiri looked decidedly uncomfortable. Not everyone was cut out for diabolical leadership.

Hisashi led Tomura up to the boy’s room, a hand at his back. “Not to worry, of course,” he drawled, tone inviting and reassuring. “I am prepared to meet your educational needs in a manner suiting your. Hm. Personality.”

“...what’s that mean.”

If Hisashi didn’t know his successor so well, he would be afraid of offending him. Thankfully, the boy was blissfully at ease in his own social ineptitude, and thus Hisashi could introduce his amended rehabilitation plan.

“It means, Tomura, that your familial integration plan will be….an epic gamer moment.”

“...using centuries old memes like that really, really makes you seem old , Sensei,” Tomura replied, tone flat. He did not seem nearly as delighted at Hisashi’s charming sense of humor as he had hoped. Ah, well. No accounting for taste.

“I am a 200-something year old father of two teenage boys. Allow me my dated humor. Izuku and Inko always found my jokes funny.”

They arrived at Tomura’s room, host to a very expensive desktop, Hisashi still guiding the boy by a hand at his back, as the boy muttered, “Maybe they were laughing at you. And wasn’t the brat, like, five when you left.”

What a generous leader Hisashi was, to choose to ignore impertinence of such magnitude. If his hand between Tomura’s shoulder rose to grip around the back of his neck like a mutt’s scruff, well, who could blame him.

After Tomura had made a couple of semi-concerning choking noises, Hisashi delicately shoved the boy into his chair, head facing forward to the screen. He released his succor’s neck in favor of a fatherly hand on the shoulder. If it was at all threatening after the minor suffocation, that was all a matter of perspective.

“Now,” he began cheerfully, “I’ve taken the liberty of restricting your game library for this mission—”

“What. Holy shit, Sensei, where are my files. Did you delete —”

“Not important! Tomura, really, you must focus on your assignment. Your files will be returned to their previous state after you’ve successfully integrated yourself with my family.”

(Gods, if Hisashi did make a copy of Tomura’s Steam library. Shit. It was all on the cloud, right? He wouldn’t have only kept local files for all of his games. He wouldn’t. For the sake of Japan’s infrastructure, he hoped not.)

Hisashi gestured to the few remaining shortcuts on Tomura’s desktop. “These will serve as your rehabilitation, in between thorough etiquette lessons taught by Kurogiri. Do well at your tasks, Tomura, and you will make me very happy.”

And what more could his successor want, than to make his dear Sensei happy?

Later, once Sensei had retreated to his own sound-proofed room to call his estranged wife, Tomura slouched in his chair and stared despondently at his desktop.

What had previously been a meticulously un-organized collection of an expansive Steam library had been brutally reduced, cutdown without mercy. Only three icons remained on his home screen, and when Tomura went to see if he could download any other games, his system pinged with a popup, preventing further action without a password Tomura did not have.

Three games , he thought to himself. Damn. Do people really live like this?

His choices were, as Sensei specified, focused on rehabilitation. Games he had never played (he could if he wanted to ) out of a sheer lack of any interest whatsoever:

Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, and Harvest Moon.

How soon can I meet Sensei’s family , he wondered to himself, holding back a scream of despair. How soon can I pass this test. This...form of inhumane reprogramming.

A popup notified him that he was not making satisfactory progress in beginning his island journey with Tom Nook. Tomura lost the battle against his screams.

Chapter Text

They obviously didn’t intend to keep the Nomu.

After Izuku had finished delicately unwrapping the drooling, docile monster at UA’s stoop, preserving the (limited edition and very rare!) ribbons and wrappings for his keeping, his teacher and their principle had re-restrained the Nomu. Police had been called, and the monster had been summarily shoved away into a cruiser, driven off for research and captivity.

Principle Nedzu had clapped his hands together, announcing that he would have to follow up with Izuku and All Might very soon. It was spoken politely, a request with an assumed agreement, but Izuku felt a chill run down his spine nonetheless.

“Ohhhh,” said Kaminari, eyes tracking the vanishing shape of their principle. “Shit, are you gonna get in trouble for being in the middle of a super villain custody dispute, dude?”

“No way,” Kirishima argued, clapping a hand to Izuku’s shoulder. Izuku—who had already been slumped in wretched defeat, knees to the concrete—collapsed forward onto the ground. As miserable as he seemed, his friends mercifully left him face-sideways on the cold, hard pavement. “That wouldn’t be cool at all,” Kirishima continued, “to punish Midoriya for a villain trying to drag him into some stuff. Besides, All Might already came out and said he’s Midoriya’s dad. I bet this is just All Might’s enemy trying to piss him off.”

“Hm,” mused Mina. “Obviously the villain’s full of it, but why is he lying about Midoriya specifically? Why d’you think, Deku-kun?”

“Uuuuughhhh,” said Izuku, face still pressed into the ground.

“Yeah,” Mina sighed, nodding sagely, hands on her hips. “Guess villains don’t need a reason to lie, huh?”

That wasn’t exactly what Izuku meant—his mind was droning some repeated plea toward unknown gods about why he, innocent Izuku, had to be subject to cruel, cosmic irony—but Izuku didn’t plan on saying any of that. His classmates might get ideas if he implied in any way that he was even considering the stupidly plausible theory that his mentor’s nemesis had dropped into their laps.

Unfortunately, some of his classmates were already more invested than others. Some of his classmates were bastards. One such bastard spoke his mind.

“Yet again, I am proven right.”

“Todoroki-kun,” Izuku mumbled, turning his blank stare up toward his classmates. He must have looked particularly pitiable, because those in his line of sight grimaced in sympathy at him. As they well should, he thought. “Please. Shut up.”

“Shut up or I’ll shut you up,” Bakugou growled. As always, he had a talent for inserting himself into the conversation; given that Izuku had dragged the other boy into his schemes, he couldn’t complain. If nothing else, his friend made for a great distraction. 

Bakugou stalked forward and yanked Izuku up from his woeful faceplant, sticking him back on his feet and dusting off his rumpled clothes with an aggressive hand.

“Thanks, Kacchan,” Izuku mumbled. He stared blankly at the carefully collected All Might memorabilia in his hands. Is it worth it , he wondered to himself. Is this all really worth it?

(Well, monetarily speaking, almost certainly: Izuku’s suffering was difficult to quantity, but if one added up the pain and suffering, he was certain it came out to at least ten thousand yen. Meanwhile, this vintage All Might merch could go for twice that, easy, on Ebay.

Was it concerning that Izuku could reduce his mental anguish to cold, unfeeling numbers? Perhaps. Izuku’s therapist would, in all likelihood, answer with a firm yes, Izuku, what is wrong with you. 

But Izuku was an All Might fan first and a functioning individual second: what was really concerning was that a centuries old supervillain just tousled up a Nomu in antique memorabilia, like cheap lasso around a hog. Pearls before swine.)

Bakugou just scoffed, single handedly holding up Izuku’s physical form, and also, to some extent, his will to live. “Don’t thank me, stupid. The Rat Bastard is probably already on it, but you should go talk to All Might about this shit before anything else gets fucked up.”

Izuku nodded. Shit would fuck itself up, inevitably, so he must try to un-fuck the shit as much as he could, before the shit was, itself, fucked. So to speak. Bakugou’s words were truly words of wisdoms.

Todoroki squinted at the two of them.

“Warning one father figure about the other, huh,” he mused. His stare tracked where Izuku was clutching his gaudy merchandise in quivering hands.

Before Bakugou could metaphorically explode at the other boy (or maybe literally, it was unclear at this point), Kaminari tilted his head at Todoroki and asked, voice friendly and curious, “I thought you were on board with All Might going public about being Midoriya’s dad, Todoroki? What gives?”

Yeah, Izuku thought bitterly, dazed, What the fuck gives.

“Well, I don’t think All Might is lying, per se,” Todoroki said. “I think they’re both his dads, now.” Then he paused, and added with a hapless shrug, “...You know how it is with quirks these days.”

“Wow,” breathed Izuku, brain-to-mouth filter malfunctioning. “You are so fucking stupid.”

It was the meanest thing Izuku had said to someone. Despite his own, deeply buried horror, he couldn’t bring himself to regret it. He was floating outside of the world, still, the dark comedy his life had become pulling him into a fugue state.

Their class and their teacher, who had been watching this conversation with some amount of bleak intrigue, were not so numb. Bakugou laughed, loud and barking, a sound Izuku hadn’t heard in years; Iida gasped, clutching at his chest like one clutching their pearls; Uraraka made a sound like a very quiet, breathy scream; Kaminari jolted himself with a shock and screeched; and Todoroki went wide-eyed, blinking rapidly at Izuku.

The various sounds of excitement shook Izuku from his dissociative state. “Oh my god,” he breathed, hands clapping to his mouth in horror. “T-Todoroki-kun I. I am so sorry, I didn’t mean that! Well, I mean I kind of did mean it but not in an angry way. Well, hm, maybe a little angry. I just—”

“Alright,” Aizawa said, interrupting Izuku’s tirade. “As entertaining as this all is, and as many questions as I have about all of this , let’s take these conversations back to the classroom. Midoriya,” he nodded in Izuku’s direction with a sharp gaze, “if you want to discuss this situation with All Might, go ahead. Make it brief: you still have class.”

“I’ll take him,” Bakugou said. At Aizawa’s doubting blink, he continued, shaking Izuku by the tight grip at his arm, “He ain’t in any state to be wandering around alone, Sensei.”

To seemingly demonstrate his current uselessness, Izuku wobbled pathetically in Bakugou’s grasp. He was a limp noodle of defeat.

Aizawa grimaced. The look he shot at Izuku’s pitiful form was the same look Izuku had seen the man direct toward particularly wretched stray cats. “Yeah, go ahead and escort him.” He paused. “Make sure you’re back before sixth period. Villainous paternity schemes are no excuse to fall behind.”

With that declaration, Aizawa dismissed the two. Bakugou proceeded to drag Izuku’s limp form toward the teacher’s lounge. Their class shot the pair of them a mixed set of gazes; they seemed torn between bafflement at Izuku’s earlier savagery and pity at his, y’know, general life situation.

Between the shock and the mercy, Izuku was pretty sure he preferred the shock, if only because it didn’t place him at the center of a goddamn custody battle between the greatest hero in history and said man’s mortal enemy.

Maybe he should swear at his classmates some more. That would keep them focused on anything other than the absurdity of his life.

Toshinori was, predictably, less than enthusiastic about the situation.

“That bastard of a man,” he growled, teeth gritted, blood gathering at his mouth in his tense rage. “Even this, he feels like he can get his filthy claws on? Nothing is sacred to him. He just lies, deceives, schemes —”

“About that,” Izuku interrupted awkwardly. All Might’s fiery blue gaze fixed on him, and Izuku squirmed in his position squeezed between Bakugou and the hero on the teacher’s lounge couch. “I, uh. You remember the scrapbook?”

Toshinori nodded.

“I’m, er, not so sure he is lying.”

Toshinori choked on his own blood, covering his mouth with a handkerchief and hunching over himself. “My boy,” he coughed, “You think that- that man really believes that he’s your father?”

“I think he might actually...be related to me? In some way. And the biggest gap in my family tree is the one that was married to my mom.”

Bakugou groaned, slumping, legs spread, with an angry frown. “I hate this,” he grumbled. “I hate that you aren’t fuckin’ wrong.”

“Oh, I think I hate this the most!”

“Hahh?? I can hate it way more than you, bastard!”

“Boys,” All Might sighed. “Please, explain what on earth you mean to this old man.”

“You’re not old , Toshinori,” Izuku insisted reflexively. “But, well. Just looking at some of the evidence, I can’t help but wonder… Why have I been inheriting the past user’s quirks from One For All, when arguably you were much more the zenith of the quirk than I am? At least if we’re looking at it from the perspective of quirk singularity. And then the timeline. It adds up, if you think about it. When my father left, when he stopped even calling our family, it lines up with when I failed to manifest a quirk and with your battle with All For One...”

Toshinori gave this the silence it deserved, brows furrowed. He looked like someone that was lost on their way to a funeral: upset and looking for direction.

Directions to Izuku’s cold, cold corpse, because he was currently digging his own grave.

“It’s just,” Izuku continued, squirming a bit, “I don’t see why he would choose to lie about this? This, specifically, and now. Why break out now , unless he really had something to prove?”

“Because he’s a bastard,” Toshinori argued, very sensibly.

“True. But what does he have to gain?”

“My undying rage?” Toshinori suggested.

“He already has that,” Izuku pointed out. “Anyway, whether it’s true or not, it seems safe to be on the defensive and assume it’s true. Or, at least, he thinks it’s true.”

His mentor-father figure stared despairingly at the floor, handkerchief held up to his mouth. His hands were gripped in angry fists. Izuku stared, pleading with puppydog eyes, until Toshinori let out a long, rattling sigh.

“You know,” he murmured, raising a hand and ruffling Izuku’s mop of hair, “this is more like Star Wars than ever before.”

“No,” said Izuku. “No, nope.”

“Even that bastard’s big, black respiratory metal helmet, it looks just like Darth Vader, doesn’t it? Oh, no. This really is making more sense by the minute—”

“Don’t use Star Wars comparisons as an argument, Toshinori-san,” Izuku pleaded. He let the pressure of Toshinori’s hand on his head push him down until he slouched half-off the couch.

At least the man had the decency to look embarrassed. “Er, it does help me see it from your perspective, though, my boy. Rising above one’s biological origins into a legacy of justice!”

“You’re romanticizing the situation. I preferred and plan on publicly sticking to you being my dad.”

Toshinori laughed, hand moving to clap Izuku on his slumped shoulder. “Oh, my boy, I plan on fighting for the position myself! Rest assured, whoever your biological father is doesn’t matter to me. You , as an individual, are the only one that can define who you are. And I’m as honored as I have been this past week that you choose me to be your father.”

Izuku sniffled. Bakugou groaned, choking down bile at the maudlin stares Izuku and All Might were sending each other. He shoved a pillow over his face. “Let me know when you two are done being so grossly fuckin’ domestic,” he grumbled into the fabric.

“I can’t help it,” Izuku sniffled, tears already leaking out (despite his very best efforts). “I’m just so glad that you would still stick with me, All Might, even if I end up being at the center of All For One’s stupid schemes. You’d still- you’d still want to be my dad!”

Maybe he was wailing, tears soaking into Toshinori’s suit jacket. Who could blame him? Within the last few days, his life had taken a Star Wars-style twist (okay, he could admit it) and gone to shit and back. Now Japan knew him as All Might’s son and his possible secret-evil-dad had broken out of jail and decided that right now was a great time to show his face—or lack of face.

And Toshinori said he’d still stick by him. Wow.

“Gross,” Bakugou groaned. “You’re soaking the damn couch!”

With a comforting pat on the back, Toshinori urged Izuku into standing, pressing tissues at his teary face. “Of course,” he said, expression fond, “regardless of what that bastard of a man plans on trying, I promise I will be by your side.”

Izuku continued to sob with happiness, now at a greater volume. He reached out to Toshinori and threw an arm around him, pulling his mentor in for a desperate hug. With his other arm, he determinedly pulled in his reluctant coconspirator.

“Eugh!” Bakugou shouted. “No!” The other boy squirmed angrily out from under Izuku’s arm. “I’m going back to class. Lemme know if your villain sperm donor tries any other shit, but I do not want in on your fuckin’ group hugs.”

“Kacchan,” Izuku sniffed, “I- it’s an Arm of Friendship.”

“Keep your arm to your damn self!” Bakugou hollered, yanking his backpack across his shoulders aggressively. He shoved his hands deep into his pants pockets, marching out of the teachers’ lounge. “I’m allergic to sentiment .”

Later, once Izuku had finished sobbing into Toshinori’s chest and collected himself, Izuku returned to their class and discretely passed Bakugou a paper note with a wobbly scribbled, ‘thank you for being my friend through these trying times’.

After a moment of furious scratching, Bakugou slapped the note back onto Izuku’s desk. The note (what remained of it, because Bakugou had dug into the thing with his pen so aggressively that he’d shredded into the paper, and ink bled onto Izuku’s fingers) looked more like a ransom letter than anything else, and read simply: ‘AGHHH NO’.

Izuku chose to interpret this as wary acceptance. Pocketing the note, he shot a quick, thankful smile back at Bakugou.

For some reason, his friend just stared back in something between disbelief and dread. 

(From across the classroom, Kaminari observed this exchange with delight.

“Tsundere,” he breathed, but even that was too loud to escape Bakugou’s sharply-tuned hearing aids. After a few moments of incensed writing, he shoved a separate note at Kaminari. It must have been much more succinct in expressing his feelings than his reply to Izuku, because Kaminari stopped chuckling immediately. In fact, he choked. On delight, Izuku was sure.

Kacchan is getting pretty good at having friends, Izuku thought happily.)

Unfortunately, their plans to not keep the Nomu appeared to go the way of most of Izuku’s plans. 

That is to say, they went to shit. Immediately.

When Izuku walked into class the next day—determined to put thoughts of Star Wars and how much, exactly, a paternity test actually costs far away, and determined to focus on his education for once—he was greeted with a truly baffling sight. As always, Iida was one of the earliest to class, and the other boy was indeed sitting ramrod straight in his assigned seat. Yaoyorozu and Todoroki were also early, the former meeting Izuku’s morning greeting with a concerned smile, the latter….

The latter was slumped slightly in his seat, one hand cupping his cheek, as he stared at the Nomu slumped next to Izuku’s seat.

The Nomu, which was there, riiiight next to Izuku’s desk.

“Oh,” said Izuku, “Hm. Um!”

“Good morning, Midoriya-kun,” Todoroki greeted, as though he weren’t looking at a massive black monster sitting primly in their classroom. Iida also shouted a brief morning ovation.

There was a moment’s pause, during which the only sound was Yaoyorozu’s quiet writing and the echoing drip of the Nomu’s drool hitting the floor.

Izuku made a hesitant wide gesture with his hands. “Are we,” he started, then cut himself off, rubbing at his eyes and blinking roughly. The visual did not change. “Are we not going to address the, uh, elephant in the room…?”

“It’s a Nomu,” Todoroki replied.

“It’s- it’s a figure of speech.”

“Is it? I was under the impression that they’re mutants made up of multiple quirks and genetic experimentation.”

“Strictly speaking, Todoroki-kun, we still do not know exactly how the Nomu are constructed!” Iida replied politely. His arms moved with the reply, enthusiastic as always, and he, too, looked supremely unconcerned with the hulking Nomu slouched by Izuku’s chair.

Todoroki squinted. “Oh. Well, either way, it’s not a figure of speech. It’s a Nomu.”

“Yep,” Izuku agreed, walking forward in a daze. “It is definitely, definitely a Nomu. That wasn’t… I wasn’t concerned with its taxonomy !”

“You should be as clear as possible in your speech, Midoriya-kun!” Iida chided, still so damn polite. “Todoroki-kun was answering your question as best he could.”

“Okay,” Izuku said, voice just a smidge away from ‘strained insanity’, “let me be clear: why are none of you freaking out at the Nomu sitting in the room.”

“It’s just sitting,” Todoroki responded. “Also, I poked it and nothing happened.”

“In the grand scheme of things,” Yaoyorozu chimed in, peeking up at Izuku a bit guiltily, “since it didn’t respond to Aizawa-sensei yesterday, I figured it wasn’t going to do anything.” She shrugged, going back to her homework in the spirit of hey, what can you do ?

“UA is a highly secure institution,” Iida argued. “I am sure that the Nomu would not have arrived in our classroom if it was a threat to our safety. Although, I admit, I am not sure what our teachers intend to teach us by bringing it into class.”

Izuku gave all of these responses the consideration they deserved. They deserved very little, because apparently his classmates had zero self preservation—not that he was one to talk. The Midoriya household was Bone-break central, and Izuku was the mayor. And, well, like Yaoyorozu mentioned, the Nomu hadn’t done anything yesterday. The police had taken it away to the precinct without a fuss, so how had it arrived in their classroom…

Izuku walked up to the Nomu hesitantly. In the spirit of things, since apparently this was how they verified their relative safety, Izuku gave the monster a firm, careful jab with a pencil.

Nothing happened. It remained a drool-dripping husk as it was the day before. Just to be on the safe side, Izuku stabbed the Nomu with 5% force of One For All.

Again, no response. The only consequence to his aggressive jabbing was the crackling of his pencil as it broke into pieces against the Nomu’s impenetrable skin.

“Hm,” said Izuku. He supposed, if nothing had happened over a day of violent prodding, and if their teachers had let the monster wander into the school, that maybe the Nomu was just gonna stay there. Sitting by Izuku’s desk, unmoving and stupid like a massive, hairless black guard dog. With careful steps around its unmoving bulk, Izuku took his seat. The Nomu remained slouched directly next to him, like a grotesque piece of modern art.

“Weird,” Izuku said. “This is weird, right?”

“When is our class not weird?” Todoroki replied. It was the most reasonable thing out of his mouth in days. “Just last week, All Might agreed you were his long-lost love child. Yesterday, the most deadly supervillain in Japan broke out and disputed this by claiming that you were his long-lost love child. That was all pretty weird.”

“....” Izuku opened his mouth, then closed it. He considered his friend’s words from an outside perspective, rolling them around in his head and realizing, hey, he had a point. In the end, all Izuku could respond with was, “I don’t think I’ve heard you say that much in one sitting since you first confronted me with your family history, Todoroki-kun.”

“Hm,” the other said, as if he had exhausted his ability to verbalize.

Over the next twenty minutes, the rest of their class proceeded to walk in. Each student’s entrance and response to the Nomu haunting Izuku’s seat was a bit different—Kaminari just raised his eyebrows; Uraraka gasped and clapped a hand to her mouth before moving to her seat, eyes wide and fixed on the Nomu; Mina made a high-pitched eep! but seemed to get over her shock with that exclamation; and Bakugou just stopped, glared between Izuku and the Nomu, and let out a long, growling groan, hands popping.

“We haven’t fuckin’ started class yet,” he grumbled, slamming himself down into his seat behind Izuku. With a heavy booted foot, he kicked the Nomu in front of him, utterly fearless. “Haven’t even started class and we’re already dealing with your bullshit, huh, Deku?”

“I didn’t- I didn’t bring the Nomu! It was just here when I walked in!”

“And, what, none of these idiots thought to freak out ‘n call Sensei?”

Izuku sweated, hands twitching nervously. “Er, we poked it and nothing happened. And it’s just sitting!”

“It’s just sitting,” Todoroki agreed astutely. 

As always, Todoroki’s voice was anathema to Bakugou, and he glared in the other boy’s direction with a sneer. “Just sitting, hahh? You stupid?!”

“Well,” Iida coughed, “it has indeed just been sitting…?”

“Fucking hell, you all better—”

Thankfully, their teacher chose this moment to walk in, cutting off Bakugou’s tirade and sparing Izuku from having to justify his non-response to the insanity his life had become. Not so thankfully, Aizawa shot the Nomu perched next to Izuku’s desk such a despairing look that Izuku was worried the man might just hand in a resignation letter to Nedzu right then and there.

“Who let that in,” their teacher said, a question that wasn’t a question. As always, unfairly , everyone unsubtly shifted in Izuku’s direction.

“I didn’t let it in!” he defended. “Iida-kun, you were here first! And- and like you said, we figured, with how secure our school is—” Izuku emphasized, carefully shifting the guilt to UA’s blatantly shit safety procedures “—all of our- our dedicated teachers must have known it was here.”

Iida was wide-eyed, slightly pink-cheeked, raising a hand to shield himself. “I—well, yes, I did think that, but…”

“Okay,” Aizawa said, half of a sigh, half of a grunt. “None of you let it in. It let itself in, somehow, which is just great. No, Iida, the faculty did not invite an actual Nomu into the school. This is not a learning experience. As far as we’re aware, it should be at the local precinct.” Their teacher pulled out his phone, typing rapidly and holding his phone to his ear. “Nedzu. Yes. No, it’s a Nomu this time. No, he didn’t let it in. I already asked. Right by Midoriya’s desk, how’d you know? Don’t answer that.”

With a dial tone the whole class could hear, Aizawa hung up on their principal. 

Izuku may not have let in the Nomu, but he did feel the insistent urge to apologize nonetheless. He fought down the instinct as best he could; this was not his fault, he reminded himself urgently.

It didn’t feel true, exactly, but given enough determination, a formerly-quirkless boy could manifest his lifelong idol and become his successor in a 2-hour period.

Izuku could ‘determination’ his way into blissful denial.

Before the end of first period, a squad of local police had arrived and escorted the docile Nomu out of their class. It hobbled along as they dragged it away, encased in restraints. The police seemed concerned, obviously, and took statements from 1-A confirming that Nomu had just been there. Sitting, they all agreed solemnly. 

With confused, concerned gazes, the police nodded and took their leave. Nothing would slip past them this time, they assured.

Naturally, within a half hour—and a loud, bubbly pop! —the Nomu suddenly just reappeared exactly where it had been, slouched and dripping drool onto the floor by Izuku’s feet, sans restraints. Their class looked at him.

“Don’t look at me,” he pleaded. They ignored him, and they looked.

“How does the saying go,” Mina mused, ignoring their teacher sighing and re-dialing the same officers he had alerted earlier. “If you love it, set it free. If it comes back, it was meant to be!”

“I do not love it,” Izuku said. 

The Nomu huffed next to him, laying down on its hindlegs like a monstrous dog. Bakugou, from behind Izuku, kicked at it again. His booted feet stomped the unflinching Nomu repeatedly. If nothing else, perhaps Izuku’s new parasite could be a healthy outlet for Bakugou’s violent tendencies.

Another squad of police reappeared within yet another half an hour (possibly the same squad. It was hard to tell, since they were blatantly not meeting any of the students’ eyes). The Nomu was summarily re-bound and grappled away. The police were muttering quietly amongst themselves, sounding very concerned about the whole thing, now, and maybe a little afraid, while Aizawa and Nedzu watched the proceedings like a public execution.

Their teachers waved away the police and their captive. This time, though, Nedzu remained behind in the classroom, perched on Aizawa’s podium. He kicked his short furry legs back and forth, content to bide his time. Aizawa was less content. “Feel free to take this time to study,” he grumbled. “We don’t think this will take too long.”

“What will take too long?” asked Uraraka.

Nedzu just smiled, which was ominous enough to deter further questioning. Izuku pulled out his study guide and focused on not thinking about Star Wars, while his classmates grumbled over homework.

Finally, with all the drama of an expected intermission, the Nomu reappeared. It again took less than half an hour for a bright, bubbly pop! to announce its arrival: gone one moment, there the next, no dramatic warp quirks in sight. Nedzu clapped his hands in delight, patting Aizawa on the back before leaving their classroom in a cheery jog. Aizawa watched him go with palpable longing, before turning back to face the expectant faces of his students.

“Well, back to class, I guess,” he conceded. “Looks like we have a special guest for the unforeseeable future. Try to ignore it and pay attention, please.”

Class 1-A took that as well as could be expected—not well.

“If you love it, set it free,” Kaminari repeated Mina’s earlier words, his voice an obnoxious, singsong drawl. “If it comes back, oh shit, too bad!”

“That doesn’t rhyme though,” Kirishima mused. “If it comes back, wait and see?”

Kaminari grimaced, shaking his head. “Nah, that just sounds ominous.”

“What, and ‘oh shit too bad’ doesn’t?”

“I don’t love it,” Izuku repeated, tugging at his classmates’ sleeves with a whiteknuckled grip. “I didn’t set it free!”

His words—a desperate plea for reason amidst a sea of teenage chaos—went unheeded. Their teacher, being the lone anchor of control, did his best to reign in the anarchy, but the sheer vibrating energy of their class was impossible to ignore. At Izuku’s feet, the hulking Nomu took up gnawing at one of the straps of his backpack. It was quickly coated in drool, fraying at the edges and laying in a limp puddle on the tile floor. Izuku looked at it and understood.

On all levels except physical, Izuku thought, he, too, was the backpack strap .
Chapter 9
Notes:

    this is out earlier than usual! turns out getting more regular sleep makes you more productive?? sounded fake but guess there's some truth to it.
    anyway. when AFO was animated in the last episode (the episode 'vestiges' if you're reading this ~in the future~), my roommate's judgement was a tangible aura. "yes," i said to her, "that IS the hot dad i'm writing about. i DO thirst for a faceless shadowy supervillain." i believe she was disappointed but not surprised. my interest in weird-looking villains has been A Thing since at least 2009. no one that knows me/reads my writing has any room to judge imo. if no one got me i know y'all in the DFO crowd got me.

Chapter Text

Izuku had always wanted a pet, but between a single working mother and a quirkless, rambling encyclopedia of a son, that dream had never come to be.

He was starting to regret ever dreaming at all.

How to return a gift you don’t want???  he typed rapidly into google. Class carried on around him, 1-A having quickly acclimated to the pest at Izuku’s side over the last few days. Izuku’s foot tapped rapidly, anxious, against the floor when none of the search results proved helpful.

Weird—one would almost think his circumstances were unusual. One would almost think that Izuku’s life was an endless circus of irony and frustration, almost. But Izuku was trying his damned best to stay determined. His circumstances, no matter how Star Wars, would not define him.

How to return a sentient gift you don’t want and it can kill people???  he tried.

This yielded somewhat more relevant results; Izuku scanned archived help threads posted by others who were the unwilling recipients of puppies and kittens, smuggled into Christmas stockings like adorable little burglars.

Charming tokens, in comparison to Izuku’s... companion. His stalwart Nomu made Izuku feel more like a prisoner of war being watched over by a malevolent guard. Hm. Google seemed to latch more onto the ‘sentient’ aspect of his search rather than the ‘can kill people’ part. Surely someone else in Japan had been gifted, say, a tiger?

A tiger that could teleport and regenerate and possibly fight All Might at his prime.

Yeah, no, Izuku thought, sighing in defeat at Google’s meager offerings. He didn’t think “kindly return the puppy to the gift giver with an explanation as to your extenuating circumstances, or—in the case where one is unable to return the puppy—contact your local non-kill shelter :)” was very applicable to being charged with a Nomu.

Even Yahoo answers, a bulwark of Japan’s collective guesswork, failed to provide a solution.

Hunched by his feet, his- no, the Nomu chewed placidly on the Stain figurine Izuku had found in a discount bin at the mall. He refused to give it any toy meant for a dog, because that would almost be conceding that the Nomu was a “pet” of any kind, and he refused to give it any of the hero figures Izuku owned for obvious reasons.

For the first and hopefully only time in his life, Izuku wished merch companies had created a Shigaraki or a Muscular figurine; those would make good additions to his “chew toy” offerings. Maybe he could put his own crafting/cosplay skills to the test and make an All For One figure.

(He’d have to look up dog-safe materials. He could only assume if it was dog-safe to gnaw on, it would be Nomu-safe, right? Or, since Nomus were the result of genetic experimentation on humans, maybe he should lean toward child-safe….

Then again, Izuku chided himself, maybe he should just coat the damn figures in lead paint and hope the Nomu dropped dead. Why was he unconsciously considering the safety of his non-pet? Damn his hero complex. Nomus were essentially impervious to damage, anyway. Lead paint was probably a pleasant spice to an unkillable parasite.)

Izuku considered the ethics and logistics of creating custom villain figures for the sole purpose of offering them as fodder to his Nomu. The mental image of All For One checking in on his assigned pet and discovering it chewing away at an effigy of the villain was a damned good one. Good enough that Izuku summarily decided the ethics of making a one-off villain chew toy was, in fact, a great idea. 

Great enough that maybe it didn’t have to be a one-off, he mused. Maybe Izuku could turn this curse into a business opportunity. Briefly, he pictured a world where dogs across Japan gnawed and tore and drooled on sad, disfigured models of tiny little All For Ones. It had a very strong appeal.

Izuku did his best to focus on his burgeoning startup idea, stalwartly ignoring where the majority of the class (sans Izuku and Bakugou, and their teacher) were huddled around Izuku’s “friend.”

He mentally emphasized the quotation marks around the word friend, because Todoroki was on thin fucking ice.

In the center of a circle of desks, hands raised in uncharacteristic, passionate gesturing, Todoroki held court. He spoke to Izuku’s skeptical classmates like a raving prophet, holding up his own tidy notebook like a gospel.

“...so you can see why I think Midoriya’s quirks, plural, are related to both All Might and the Bastard of Kamino,” he said. He was a bit pink in the cheeks, and his chest was raising and falling quickly. He seemed out of breath; Izuku didn’t think the other boy was used to speaking in such complex sentences. “Midoriya may claim that he has ‘just one quirk’ and that ‘his quirk is just weird’, but as you can see on page fourteen, I’ve illustrated why this isn’t the case.”

Todoroki held out his notebook, pages splayed wide, like Moses down the mountain heralding the Ten Commandments.

“You really did illustrate it,” Kirishima said in disbelief. “Wow, hey, that’s a pretty good drawing, Todoroki!”

“It looks just like Deku-kun,” Uraraka muttered, eyes squinted in focus. “Say, have you been studying pictures of him or something, Todoroki-kun…?”

Todoroki didn’t even have the decency to look embarrassed. “Yes.”

Despite his very best efforts to ignore the conversation floating through the classroom, Izuku couldn’t avoid it. He had been trying to focus on their homework, because this was independent study hour , but his pencil had frozen over the page, lead broken off after pressing a long, shaking line into the page. “No,” he whined.

In the desk behind him, Izuku could smell the sugary smoke wafting from Bakugou’s clenched fists. “What the fuck,” his only real friend in the whole damn class, apparently, hissed. “Aizawa-sensei,” he barked, standing in his rage, chair screeching as he shoved it back, “isn’t this supposed to be study hour?! ”

Bakugou gestured angrily at the congregation holding court mere feet away.

Curled in his sleeping bag, Aizawa blinked tiredly back at Bakugou. “It’s independent study,” he muttered. “If your classmates want to waste their time studying one another’s creative scriptures, that’s up to them. Focus on your own work.”

Somehow, Bakugou managed to sit back down angrily. Izuku envied him.

“Anyway,” Todoroki continued, as if he had any room to sound exasperated at the interruption. “I think All Might helped Midoriya escape the Bastard of Kamino prior to the start of the school year. This was All Might’s second break up with the All For One.”

The group nodded in understanding. Mina raised her hand, as if Todoroki was the authority in the classroom, and Todoroki nodded at her to speak. “But how does Midoriya’s mom come in, then?” Mina asked, hand scratching at her horn. “He can’t have more than two parents!”

“Can’t he?” Todoroki posited. He passed his notebook to Mina. “If you review my diagram on page eleven, and the timeline on page twenty-three, you’ll see how I take these items into consideration. Since the age of quirks began, there’s actually plenty of precedent for having three or four different biological parents.”

“Huh,” Mina mused, eyes scanning Todoroki’s writing. She passed the notebook around to the eager classmates next to her. “Wow, I had no idea, Todoroki! You really did your research.”

Kaminari grabbed at the notebook with eager hands. He squirmed a bit in his seat in delight. “Bro,” he said, voice wavering in excitement, “this is so good! Also, whoa, the back of this page looks just like one of Midoriya’s notebooks!”

Kirishima peered over his shoulder. “Wow, hey, it does. Actually, is that Midoriya’s handwriting…?”

Izuku squawked. “What!” Abandoning his mission of pretending the conversation wasn’t happening, he scrambled over to Todoroki’s flock, grabbing at his stupid notebook with anxious hands. Kirishima was right, this was— “Todoroki-kun,” Izuku hissed, “This is my handwriting! Is this—”

“I took a leaf out of your book and started my own journal,” Todoroki explained.

“This is literally a page out of one of my notebooks! Which one did you- when did you take this. You copied it!”

“I said what I said.”

“They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,” Yaomomo murmured, watching this display with morbid fascination. “And Midoriya-san’s notebooks are definitely worth imitating. Your writing is very analytical.”

“This is not just imitation,” Izuku contended. “This is intellectual theft.”

“If he took your actual notebook, even if he returned it after making a copy, that could be considered genuine theft,” Iida chimed in. Like he had any right to add his opinion to the conversation, Izuku thought, given that he was taking his own notes on Todoroki’s earlier conspiracies. Izuku could read a synopsis on multi-parent quirk genetics from where he was standing, hands clutching the copy-pasted notebook to his chest.

One of the ‘explanations’ was just three words: quirks these days. The words were underlined. Izuku had never endorsed book burnings, but, well, there was a first time for everything.

“You’ve bastardized my notebooks,” Izuku mumbled miserably. “This- this page was originally about the genetics behind Best Jeanist’s quirk, and you- you corroborated it together like a ransom note.” He pointed to the chaotically assembled timeline and previously referenced diagram on page eleven.

Todoroki at least had the decency to look a bit ashamed. Not ashamed enough though, Izuku thought bitterly. “I didn’t actually tear it out or anything,” Todoroki justified, gaze shifting guiltily. “I made copies of my favorite pages and returned it and you never noticed, so I thought you wouldn’t mind.”

Izuku stared at the notebook Todoroki had constructed in despair. To his own dismay, it was indeed a well put together collection of writing. Disregarding where his classmate had carefully pasted Izuku’s own writing like a grade school collage, the notebook contained actual academic references (?!) to various cases regarding unusual quirk genetics. And the illustrations were, unfortunately, pretty good.

If the notes were about anything other than Izuku’s theoretical parentage, he’d be deadset on keeping it and adding it to his collection. As it was, however… 

“I’m gonna destroy this,” Izuku said.

Todoroki rose from his seat with a wide, fearful stare. “You can’t,” he objected, more emotion in his voice than when he recited his tragic backstory. “I worked really hard on that notebook. And the Midoriya is All Might and All For One’s Illegitimate Lovechild fanclub is going to need that notebook in order to restart recruitment efforts.”

“Is that so,” Izuku said, considering the notebook in his hands.

Todoroki, Kaminari, Mina, Uraraka, and—he knew it—Iida all nodded. The rest of their little circle looked just as complicit, heads shifting in agreement. Izuku responded with his own determined nod.

“Mephi-chan,” Izuku called, turning back towards his (fine, if he couldn’t return it he would own it) stupid Nomu. Mephi-chan perked up and hobbled over to Izuku, and Izuku patted the thing on its massive, bulging head.

“Here,” he said, smiling at it for the first time since it started haunting his desk. “Open up!”

“What—”

Izuku ignored his guilty classmates and, pulling at his Nomu’s snout, tossed the stupid notebook into its drooling, fanged mouth. Mephi-chan, of course, immediately began chewing away.

“The sacred texts,” Todoroki said. He looked devastated. “I worked so hard on that notebook. Midoriya, why—”

“Oh, you all know why,” Izuku replied with a vicious grin. His classmates shrank back a bit, startled at the menacing aura pouring off of Izuku. Maybe he took after his probable sperm donor more than he thought, Izuku considered, because even he could feel the furious pressure he’d inadvertently sent at his classmates. “There will be no more notebooks about my parentage, please!”

Todoroki’s congregation shifted uncomfortably. Iida awkwardly crumpled up the notepad he had been notating, tossing the creased page toward the trashcan. He raised his empty hands as a white flag of surrender.

Todoroki was lucky he was so handsome. Otherwise, Izuku may be tempted to act less than heroically toward his friend, maybe wrap him up tightly in Blackwhip like a snake choking out its prey. But he wouldn’t! That wouldn’t be very heroic.

Kaminari finally broke the tense silence. “Hey, Midoriya,” he started, smiling awkwardly in Izuku’s direction. “What did you call the Nomu earlier? Uh, Nesi?”

“Mephi-chan,” Izuku corrected.

“So you did name it!” Uraraka chirped, expression quickly morphing into a grin. “I knew you couldn’t resist it forever, Deku-kun.”

Mina moved closer, now that the atmosphere had regained some normalcy. Most of the circle had shuffled back toward their normal seats, Todoroki remaining a solitary, despondent figure standing alone in the center of the room. Mina patted Mephi-chan on its head, blithely ignoring the paper being shredded in its mouth. “That’s a cute name, Deku-kun. Where’s it come from?”

“Did you name him after a hero?” Kirishima asked with a grin, leaning closer.

“It, not he,” Izuku corrected gently. “Please don’t gender my Nomu. But, no, it’s not named after a hero.” Izuku smiled at his classmates. If they were willing to put their previous stupidity behind them, Izuku was more than happy to pretend they hadn’t been theorizing about his villainous background. “I wouldn’t name a Nomu after a hero,” he laughed, scratching at the back of his head. “No, Mephi-chan is short for Mephistopheles!”

“Who’s that?” Mina asked.

“A demon!” Izuku replied happily.

“Oh,” said Mina, smile going a little strained for some reason. Kirishima’s grin looked more like a grimace, suddenly, and his classmates shifted further away from his Nomu.

Izuku couldn’t think of a reason for the sudden awkwardness. He was suddenly cursed with a massive, teleporting monster that stalked his every step. What was he supposed to name it? 

He considered some of his earlier ideas: All Bite? Nomui Woods? Beast Jeanist? Gnaw For One?

He had put those names on the backburner. For now, a ceaseless demon seemed the perfect moniker for his parasite.

If one of the other names ended up pissing off All For One more than the others, he could always adjust it later.

“Oh, Izuku,” his mom sighed, tinny over the speakers. “What was I supposed to tell him? He is your father, after all.”

Izuku gripped his sheets tight, grimacing. “Oh, I dunno! Maybe something like, ‘Turns out you’re a supervillain, and also we basically adopted All Might, so get lost’?”

His mom hummed in consideration, a buzzing sound that didn’t carry well over electronics. Izuku had his phone sat on his bed, set to speaker, with Toshinori and Bakugou both sitting in various states of uncomfortable. Bakugou leaned back in Izuku’s desk chair, legs splayed and frowning at Izuku’s phone; Toshinori sat with his hands clasped close in front of his legs, hunched over awkwardly next to Izuku on his bed; and Mephi-chan sat like a living stain in the corner. His mentor determinedly didn’t look at the numerous All Mights grinning back at him from every angle of Izuku’s room.

“Tempting at that is,” Izuku’s mom said, voice happy but long-suffering, “I already chewed him out. To think he planned on just showing up, as though he hadn’t been gone the past decade! The men in your life, Izuku,” she chided, working herself up into a righteous rant about how Izuku deserved better from his various father figures. Tosinori shifted uncomfortably next to him.

“I know,” Izuku agreed hastily, cutting off that spiel before his mentor had to sit through another speech about how she, as Izuku’s mother, should have been told about Toshinori’s connection to Izuku sooner than later. “It’s just...you want to let him back in? Just like that?”

“Well, he is your father, Izuku. Just because we don’t agree with his business practics doesn’t mean we should cut him out entirely.”

“He’s evil.”

Inko sighed. “You know, when he first told me his work was ‘less than ethical’, I thought he was just involved in hedge fund management or stocks, maybe a lawyer. In hindsight, I should have probed deeper….”

Izuku immediately felt guilty; he didn’t mean to shift the blame for his biological father being a supervillain to his mother. Bakugou looked supremely unimpressed, mouth gaping a bit at Izuku’s phone as he mouthed the words ‘less than ethical.’ “It’s not your fault, mom,” Izuku said, hands fiddling awkwardly with each other. “I just. He could hurt you.”

His mom laughed, a startled and delighted sound, and Toshinori frowned at Izuku’s phone. “Inko,” he interrupted, “Please. I cannot overstate the threat that All For One could pose to you or Izuku. He—”

“Oh, Toshi,” Inko breathed, smile audible. “I’m sorry, I don’t mean to downplay what he’s done. It’s just, well. You should have seen the mess he was at our wedding. It’s not just me that Izuku gets his waterworks from!”

Toshinori didn’t seem to know what to do with this information. The concept that All For One, king of the underworld, had bawled at his wedding was incongruent with the image he had of the man ripping a hole into his side.

“Well, regardless,” Inko huffed. “I meant what I said the last time you visited, Izuku. Toshi has been such a wonderful male role model in your life. Any man that wants to call himself your father has to earn it. Hisashi’s been gone so long, and I’m still so bitter about that, but…” She sighed, wistful and sad. “You should have seen the way he looked at you when you were born, Izuku. He asked to stop by for dinner this weekend, to see you and get to know you again, and I couldn’t say no. Hisashi, well. He’s always had such a way with words!”

“I bet,” Toshinori muttered.

Izuku was quiet, brows furrowed and glaring at the carpet. Across the room, there was a gentle snap! as Mephi-chan bit the arm off of its Stain figurine, followed by a grotesque, loud swallowing sound. Bakugou grimaced at the noise.

“I don’t trust him,” Izuku mumbled. “He’s All For One, All Might already said he’d be my dad, we don’t need him.”

“Izu, baby, I know,” his mom consoled. “We don’t. And if he messes this dinner up, I’ll kick him to the curb and tell him to come back and try again in another five or ten years, okay?”

Bakugou groaned, holding his head in his hands. “Really,” he grumbled, “You’re gonna go home this weekend for a nice fuckin’ sit down with All For One? I’m not going with you, nerd, no fucking way.”

“Ah, Katsuki, you’re there too?” Inko exclaimed, delighted. “Izuku, you should have told me he was there. Katsuki, you have to come visit this weekend, dear. Hisashi hasn’t seen you since you were three feet tall!”

“He saw me when his batshit successor kidnapped me,” Bakugou whisper-yelled into his palms. He gripped his hair in straining, tense hands. Izuku reached across the room to pat him soothingly on the leg, but his friend slapped his hand away. Bakugou huffed, raising his head with a glare at Izuku, and replied louder to Inko, “Okay, Auntie. I’ll be there.”

Inko replied with a delighted ramble about what she was planning for dinner, and how she was so excited to have everyone together again, while Bakugou stared down Izuku with lasersharp eyes. Izuku held up his hands in helplessness. Hastily, he whispered, “It’s not like I can tell her not to invite you! She probably already told your mom!”

Bakugou reached across the room to kick him, the gremlin. Izuku grimaced, hissing quietly in pain, and pointed aggressively to the Nomu resting in the corner. “Take it out on Mephi-chan,” he chided quietly. His friend continued glaring, but he did stomp over to the corner and proceed to take his frustrations out on Izuku’s unflinching Nomu with angry kicks.

Toshinori watched all of this with a concerned frown. “I should come as well,” he said, hesitantly, “to make sure everything is alright.”

Inko shut him down quickly but gently. “I would love to see you, Toshi,” she assured, “But, well, Hisashi said he was bringing the boy he’d adopted, and apparently Tomura-kun isn’t, ah. He isn’t very fond of you.”

At that news, Toshinori coughed blood into the back of his hand, and Izuku stared in wide eyed horror at his phone. His mom continued, ignorant to their mutual despair, “Maybe once he’s warmed up to all of us, and we’ve gentled him a bit, we could all have a big family gettogether,” she said happily. “Izuku and I are very good influences. I’m sure Tomura-kun will warm up to you once we’ve shown him a little love!”

Izuku doubted that, but well. Previously he’d doubted that his evil sperm donor would even want to reach out, let alone schedule a family dinner, and here they were. Maybe Shigaraki Tomura would be on his best behavior.

Either way, his wavering determination to show up back home this weekend was solidified. There was no damn way he was leaving his mom alone with both All For One and Shigaraki Tomura. The former may be tamed by his inexplicable affection, but Shigaraki?

That boy was the definition of a loose canon mixed with a Gamergate hikikomori. A guy that you’d see pulling a knife out on his classmates in a fit of rage, or that would be escorted in handcuffs on the evening news after reacting violently at a girl’s rejection. Izuku shuddered.

“Right,” Izuku said, lying to himself and god. “I’m sure he’ll warm up to us.” 

Maybe to his mom, at least. She emanated powerful maternal love, an unstoppable force of affection. If anyone could win over Shigaraki’s shriveled heart, it’d be her. Not Izuku, hero Otaku and hero hopeful, but hey, if his father insisted on integrating the other boy into their family, they would be...brothers. They would have a solemn duty to put up with each other. Again, Izuku shuddered.

“As long as that’s the only person he’s planning on bringing,” Izuku conceded with a shaky sigh. He ran a hand through his hair. “Hopefully he doesn’t have any other evil children running around to introduce to us.”

At that, his mom laughed hard, which startled Izuku and Toshinori enough to have them making questioning sounds. “Oh, it’s nothing!” Inko said, voice shaking with suppressed laughter. Bakugou made a doubting huff from the corner of the room, where he was sitting on Mephi-chan, swinging his feet into it repeatedly.

“Inko, please,” Toshinori said, hands wringing. “This situation more than any other calls for as much honesty as we can afford. If ‘other evil children’ has you laughing, I just… I worry for Izuku, you know this,” he finished, a statement that made both he and Izuku turn red and avoid looking at each other in mutual embarrassment.

Thankfully, this seemed to be enough to have Inko collect herself, giggles winding down as she reigned in her amusement. Despite himself, Izuku couldn’t help but smile a bit; it had been awhile since he’d heard his mom laugh that hard. It didn’t make any sense, as far as reactions to “do you think your evil spouse has any other children running around out there?” but Izuku was just happy to hear his mom so jubilant.

“It’s,” she started, then cut herself off with another little laugh. “Oh, it’s just. Well, it’s not the most appropriate conversation, I shouldn’t…” 

“Mom,” Izuku interjected, sensing his mom’s reluctance. “C’mon, you don’t know if it may end up being important, right?”

“I’m pretty sure it won’t be. It, well,” she chuckled. She sounded embarrassed, but continued, “Well, I suppose you’re old enough now that I can say this, even though it’s silly and private…”

She trailed off again, quiet huffs carrying over the tinny speakers. Toshinori and Izuku stared at his phone in anxious silence, Izuku now realizing that this topic may be something that he wanted to avoid, but having already dug himself his nice little hole.

“It’s just…I doubt he’s had any other children. On our wedding night,” she said, and oh no, Izuku did not like where this was going, but his mother continued with a chuckle, “That night, he was so nervous. He teared up and admitted it was his first time!”

“All For One was a fuckin’ virgin?! ” Bakugou hollered, hands exploding on Mephi-chan. Izuku, similarly, covered his ears and screamed.

Some intel wasn’t worth learning, he had come to learn. Maybe if he just yelled his denial and shut out the world, he could wipe his brain regarding any knowledge about his mom and All For One’s sex life .

Or lack thereof, his traitor brain whispered, as Toshinori played damage control, face beat red as he stumbled over a response to Inko that Izuku did not and would not listen to.

All For One had been a 200-something-year-old virgin.

Chapter Text

When Bakugou shouldered open Izuku’s dorm door, he took one glance at Izuku and immediately turned around and walked back out. 

The entire movement was a smooth loop, no hesitation. It would be an impressive maneuver if it wasn’t offensive—Izuku hadn’t even done anything! Yet. 

“Kacchan!” Izuku squawked, rushing to throw his door open and gripping his friend’s arm. He stared up at the other boy imploringly. “You said you’d give me feedback on my outfit for this weekend!”

“And I regret that now,” Bakugou ground out, teeth gritted. He reluctantly allowed Izuku to drag him back into the room, his heels dragging against the carpet behind him and palms smoking. Once the door closed behind them with a soft click, Izuku crossed his arms in a defensive huff, but Bakugou just growled and gestured at Izuku’s whole body in a passioned hiss, “What the hell are you wearing?!”

“A t-shirt!”

“I can fucking see that, idiot. You never wear anything else. When”—he spun Izuku around in a dizzying circle, red eyes narrowed in disgust as he took in Izuku’s fashion choices—”did you get this!”

This was, of course, one of the t-shirts, a part of the bulk order that 1-A had submitted to a shady creator on Twitter. When he’d first seen the things, Izuku had wallowed in his fate. Who, after all, could ever want to wear such a ghastly thing: his own face and All Might’s (or, rather, a bizarre cartoony variation of them) grinned back at the viewer, framed by round bold letters that declared them a ‘mighty family’. It was designed with bright, All Might colors, strong lines, and an absolute absence of any shame.

Now, Izuku understood. He would wear such a ghastly thing. It was ugly, and he hated that it existed, but—you know who would hate its existence even more?

His evil biodad, that’s who. Izuku would wear the garish merch with pride, just for the look on All For One’s face when he saw it. Plus fuckin’ ultra.

“I know it’s ugly,” Izuku allowed, ignoring Bakugou’s muttered comments. “It’s ugly and dumb, and the worst part is most of our class has their own matching shirts. Present Mic got one too, and I’m about 78% sure he got one for Aizawa-sensei. Even All Might got one!”

“Why.”

“He thought I wouldn’t notice,” Izuku bemoaned, shaking his head sadly. “I saw his name on the oder form! And that’s not even addressing the fact that I keep track of all of All Might’s online orders!”

“Again, why.”

“I’m looking out for my real dad, Kacchan. The eldery are very susceptible to online scams. Focus!”

“I’m focusing, stupid, I just hate everything about this and every damn thing you’ve said in the past five minutes.”

“You’re not focusing, or else you would’ve noticed the matching t-shirt I have laid out for you,” Izuku declared, gesturing at the hideous shirt laying on his bed.

Bakugou shot Izuku a look of such angry bafflement that Izuku felt the need to ramble an explanation. He was, after all, Izuku’s only remaining friend in 1-A that wasn’t a member of the stupid parentage club, which seemed to change its name and eponymous patriarch weekly.

“I got you a matching one, for maximum impact,” Izuku explained. “Now, before you start arguing about or ‘shame’ or ‘dignity’—”

“I,” said Bakugou, darkly, “am not wearing that.” 

Izuku gestured widely at the offending clothing, eyes wild. If he looked a bit unhinged, wearing a shirt with his own chibi-fied face and empassioned about getting his lifelong friend to do the same, he was sure no one could truly blame him, given the circumstances. “Kacchan, disregard fashion! Disregard your pride!” Izuku hissed. He flung his arms out dramatically. “Focus on coming out on top, like you always do: imagine the look on All For One’s and Shigaraki’s faces when they see it!”

For a few solid minutes, Bakugou was quiet and considering. His gaze was narrowed in on the terrible t-shirt spread on Izuku’s bed, mouth turned down in a sharp frown and brows furrowed as he mentally manifested the vision Izuku was urging him to see.

Think about it, Izuku silently pressed with a wide-eyed stare, trying to meet Bakugou’s eyes (despite the other boy determinedly refusing to do so). Yes, we will look so, so stupid, but you know who will look even more stupid? My evil sperm donor, when he shows up at my mom’s door and is greeted by his hero son wearing a shirt that openly announces his parental preferences.

Mephi-chan stuck its snout out from where it had hidden itself under Izuku’s bed. Izuku kicked it back like a shameful secret. Bakugou was too focused weighing his pride against All For One’s humiliation to add in his own kick.

Finally, he seemed to reach a conclusion. The scales tipped, and dignity gave way to spite.

“...I’m not wearing it all the way to Auntie’s house. No fuckin’ way am I risking the paparazzi staking out your house seeing me wearing this shit,” Bakugou muttered. “I’ll put it on when we get there and no earlier. And I’m taking it off before we leave.”

Izuku beamed. “Thank you, Kacchan! I even got one for my mom!”

Bakugou looked reluctantly impressed, if just a little horrified. “All For Dumb is gonna hate this shit. When the hell did you get so vindictive?”

“Y’know,” Izuku mused, packing away Bakugou’s t-shirt along with his other supplies for the weekend, shoving it into his bulging yellow backpack, “I’m not sure! I think it was some time around when I realized I enjoyed lying to our classmates, back when we first confirmed the rumors about Toshinori being my dad. I thought to myself, ‘Am I good a lying? Do I enjoy lying?’ and it turned out the answer was yes, actually, when I really put my mind to it! I think the vindictiveness was a natural and normal next step,” he explained happily. 

“...right,” said Bakugou, eyes squinting in consideration at Izuku. “Speaking of being pissed off, are you gonna take that anger out on the idiots in our class any time soon? ‘Specially Half n’ Half bastard.”

“Hm?” Izuku hummed, glancing up briefly from where he was filling his weekend backpack. Notebooks stuck out of a haphazard lump of t-shirts and hero merch. He blinked at his friend. “Why would I do that?”

Bakugou threw himself backward on Izuku’s now-empty bed, hands behind his head and feet swinging into Mephi-chan’s head where it peeked out from under the bed. He scowled at Izuku. “You kidding me? He’s been the fuckin’ Ringleader of Dumbassery, talking up the whole damn class about how All Might had to have some kind of love triangle with your sperm donor and your mom. He even made that stupid notebook. You ain’t mad?”

“Oh, I’m mad,” Izuku agreed, nodding and returning to his current task: trying to zip his backpack closed around the bulging contents without breaking the zipper. He huffed, pulling at the cord carefully. “I’m mad but...well. He wasn’t entirely wrong, you know? And he isn’t being malicious on purpose.” He shrugged. “It’s just his personality. And it was probably going to get out somehow, anyway. All Might being my dad was never going to stay a secret for long.”

His friend groaned, feet bracing themselves on Mephi-chan’s head, like Bakugou was going to perch on his Nomu’s face. “Fuckin’ really . You’re just gonna let it go? If that dumbass didn’t shout about your dad to the whole damn school, we wouldn’t be in this situation at all.”

“Maybe,” Izuku allowed. “Or maybe someone else would have spilled. Or maybe I would have blurted it out, actually, I probably would have ended up being...” he trailed off into muttering.

Bakugou was not impressed. “So you’re just gonna let Half n’ Half get away with starting a cult about your parentage. You’re gonna keep sitting with that dumbass at lunch like he isn’t a foundational member of a fuckin’ religion about you having two dads.”

Izuku finally finished wrangling his backpack into submission, huffing with the effort of zipping up all the supplies he planned on bringing to the weekend’s dinner. He walked over to Mephi-chan and threw his arms around its firm, inactive neck, sprawling out on the floor. He grumbled his answer into its flesh.

“Couldn’t hear you, dummy,” Bakugou responded. “Speak up. Why the hell are you even putting up with half the dumbasses in our class.”

“Todoroki is simple and he’s nice to look at,” Izuku repeated, raising his head to stare at Bakugou. “And he doesn’t actively hate my guts. Look. You tormented me for years and I still consider you one of my closest friends, so like...my standards for friendship are kind of basic human kindness. It’s not the healthiest foundation for relationships, but it’s gotten me this far.”

At that, Bakugou didn’t have much of a response. He twitched guilty on Izuku’s bed, feet kicking down on the top of Mephi-chan’s head. Izuku grunted when the heel of his shoes made contact with the top of his own skull where it was pressed into Mephi-chan’s neck.

“Whatever. I’m a better fuckin’ friend than Half n’ Half now , right?”

Izuku’s heart skipped a beat at Bakugou’s use of the word friend. He sniffled, raising already-teary eyes to meet Bakugou’s own. “Are you admitting,” he whimpered, “to being my friend, Kacchan? I’m your friend? Oh, I’ve been waiting for you to say that since—”

“Oh, fuck, nevermind. I take it all back. Be friends with Half a Brain if you want, I’ll come with you this weekend and I’ll put on the damn t-shirt. I’m not gonna join you in a fuckin’ sobfest and hug a Nomu while talking about our feelings, good-fuckin’- bye .”

With that, Bakugou stomped out of Izuku’s room. Izuku watched him leave with watery eyes.

“Mephi-chan,” he whispered into his Nomu’s inert, muscular nape. “Kacchan admitted I’m his friend! He denied it immediately after, but look. This is progress. This is friendship. Wow. Can you believe it, Mephi-chan? I know.”

Mephi-chan, of course, did not respond. It did make a warbly, breathy screech and shuffle its feet, nosing its way out from under his bed.

“I know! And he admitted that Todoroki is my friend too.” Izuku nodded excitedly. “Er, he said Todoroki is a bad friend. But you have to be a friend to be a bad one, right? Wow. This is amazing. I have so many friends.”

Another wheezing shriek echoed out from his Nomu’s throat. Izuku patted it on its head, letting it drag him across the ground from where he had his arms tied around its neck.

He may have to face his evil biodad this weekend, but his friend was going to come with him. He was determined to walk into his mom’s house head held high.

Maybe if Izuku kept his head really, really low, he could walk into his mom’s house with a modicum of dignity.

His classmates seemed determined to really test the concept that Izuku had any dignity at all. It was Friday, classes had just ended, and Izuku was hoping to mentally psyche himself up for the evening. But his classmates weren’t through with him for the week quite yet: Kaminari and Kirishima had cornered him at his desk before he could leave.

The rest of 1-A, perhaps sensing that Some Nonsense was afoot, remained in the classroom as well, gazes unsubtly turned toward where Izuku was confronted by two of their most enthusiastic members. Mina popped bubblegum obnoxiously, and Iida definitely had a notepad of his own poised and ready to note down any important Izuku lore that may arise from whatever he was dragged into.

Izuku’s backpack was obviously already packed for the weekend, stuffed to near bursting and propped up against the Nomu next to his desk. He fidgeted with a strap, glancing up at Kaminari awkwardly. “Um,” he said, gaze shifting from Kamiari’s excited eyes to the obvious stares from the rest of 1-A. “Can I...help you?”

“Remember the 3-E Twitter?” Kaminari blurted, entirely redundantly; as if Izuku could forget the social media account that single-handedly thrust his All Might-associated lies into the public conscience. At Izuku’s tired nod, Kaminari continued, “They have sooo many followers—before all this Mighty Family stuff they had 1.3 million followers, y’nkow, and now? 2.2 million! That’s wild, right?”

“Right,” said Izuku wearily. “It’s great to know that my personal life has catapulted our classmates into internet fame.”

“It really is,” Kirishima agreed with a sharp-toothed grin, oblivious to Izuku’s bitterness. Not that Izuku could even be mad at Kirishima about any of this; the other boy was just too damn pure in his excitement for their fellow students.

(And just like Todoroki, he definitely wasn’t bad to look at. Kirishima’s hero costume left so little to the imagination, Izuku mused dreamily. All those firm muscles. How could Izuku be expected to stay mad at his classmates when they were all so damn forthright and handsome? His bisexual heart couldn’t hold anything against them for long.)

Ignorant to both Izuku’s frustration at 3-E achieving internet fame at his expense and his vague, dreamy musings about how his difficult classmates were all painfully attractive, Kamiari rambled onward.

“I figured, why should they get all the social media clout, right? So Todoroki and Kirishima and Sero and I—”

“Of course Todoroki is involved.”

“—we made a HeroTube channel! Guess how many subscribers we already have, dude? After just two weeks?” Kaminari babbled.

“Oh, I couldn’t say,” Izuku gritted out, shaky smile firmly in place. He would be. A good. Classmate. “Probably too many. Probably more than I want to even think about.”

Kaminari waved his hand, enthusiastic and dismissive all at once, clicking at his phone and turning the screen to face Izuku. His friend’s distinctive yellow-and-black hair, and Kirishima’s spiky-toothed grin, were both clearly visible in the video’s preview picture. Todoroki lurked in the video’s background as a red-and-white blur. The subscriber count was visible, and it was already in hundreds of thousands.

Izuku’s finger hovered over the play button, shaking just slightly. He felt more like his finger was wavering over the detonation to a massive bomb. He clicked play.

And immediately their classroom was blasted with sound.

“WwwwWWWHAT’S UP, HeroTube!” the Kaminari on screen veritably yelled at the camera, face a camera-perfect plasticy grin. Izuku grimaced—why the yelling? The camera was right there, there wasn’t any need! He frantically lowered the volume.

(Was this intensity normal? None of the HeroTubers Izuku followed were quite so...enthusiastic. He was subscribed to dozens of channels dedicated to battle compilations and quirk theory, and the creators of those channels were always calm and collected, if passionate. Kaminari, on the other hand….

‘Unhinged’ was the best way to describe the video’s energy.)

The Kirishima on screen pumped his fist. “Hey guys!”

Next to him, HeroTube Kaminari slammed his hand onto one of the common room tables. “You’ve probably seen UA’s class 3-E’s WILD Twitter post, right?! This one—” HeroTube Kaminari held up a screenshot to the Tweet that had thrown Izuku’s life into chaos. 

The screen flashed to cuts of All Might bowing to a crowd outside of UA and admitting to being Izuku’s father, and to a shot of Izuku’s mom stuttering and closing the door on intrepid reporters. HeroTube Kaminari nodded furiously. “Well! I thought, hey! that’s my classmate! Why should our Senpai get all the credit for breaking the news when we were the ones to dig up the truth and do all the research.”

“I made a notebook,” HeroTube Todoroki said distantly, voice tinny. “But a Nomu ate it.”

“He even made a notebook,” agreed HeroTube Kaminari, nodding solemnly. “It was a damned good one too. With diagrams and everything, documenting our relentless hunt for the truth. But our classmate was embarrassed by our heroic passion, and he destroyed it.

“In this video, we’ll walk you through how All Might and the Bastard of Kamino had a totally dramatic breakup, and then how they met our classmate’s mom and how our classmate is related to all three of them. But before that—

“Be sure to Texas SMASH that SUBSCRIBE button if—”

Izuku paused the video. He took a deep breath. He thought about his journey to this moment: how he went from a quirkless middle schooler to All Might’s successor, to the unwitting spawn of Japan’s greatest evil, from a friendless preteen to having a class full of peers that admired him enough to want to make a whole HeroTube channel about his heritage.

To how said channel now had over 200,000 subscribers, in just two weeks.

“The video,” Izuku said, voice shaky. “It’s. Uh. Good editing.”

He could get nothing else out, his thoughts as wavering and flailing as his determination to face his supervillain biodad this very evening. His hand was unsteady as he handed Kaminari’s phone back to him. The other boy beamed.

“Thanks, man! I know you’ve been kind of embarrassed about this whole thing, but it’s what the people want , you know? And you didn’t like Todoroki’s notebook, so we made sure not to write anything down this time!”

Next to him, Kirishima nodded, grin wide.

Right, Izuku thought. You refrained from writing anything down, very good work. Instead, you made a twenty-three minute long video dedicated to the topic. Normal.

“Why are you yelling in the video so much, kero?” asked Tsuyu, face placid and tilted in consideration. Yaoyorozu nodded in hesitant accord, lowering one of her hands from where it had been covering her ear against HeroTube Kaminari’s shouting.

“Huh?” Kaminari asked, head tilted in confusion. “That’s just being enthusiastic! That’s how all the best HeroTubers do their videos.”

“I think being passionate about our classmates is pretty manly, y’know?” Kirishima added, reaching up to scratch at the points of his hair. “We’re just really excited about you, Midoriya! You and All Might have the coolest relationship.”

Kirishima grinned, teeth sharp and glinting, face handsomely angled and sharp. His shoulder muscles bunched up below his sleeves from where his arms were stretched.

Izuku nodded dreamily at him. “Right,” he agreed mindlessly. Handsome , he thought privately. “Right. You did, uh. You did good, Kirishima.”

From behind him, Bakugou made a disparaging, disbelieving scoffing sound. “Really,” he said flatly. Izuku turned, ready to at least try to defend his honor, but Bakugou’s knowing glower made him squeak and go red.

“Uh,” Izuku stuttered, eyes darting between his friend and the posse of handsome classmates grinning at him. He looked downward guilty. “I just. I hate the topic but. It’s a technically well-made video? And they’re j-just trying to be friendly.”

“Uh huh.”

“Anyway!” Izuku shouted, jumping to his feet and refusing to look at anyone. His hands were fidgeting restlessly, and he summarily dropped his pencils in a loud clatter like an idiot. Fumbling down at his belongings, he rambled at his friend, “Uh, anyway. Let’s head back to the dorms and get ready for tonight, you know? Focus on the goal.”

“You guys are both heading home tonight?” Kaminari asked, eyes wide. He gestured between Izuku and Bakugou. “ Both of you? Is something going on?”

“Shut up,” Bakugou drawled. He bulldozed out of the room, gripping Izuku by the back of his collar. Izuku choked. Mephi-chan grumbled at this, trotting after the two of them. Clenched in its jaws, Izuku’s backpack dragged along behind Mephi-chan on the ground like a carcass.

“You can’t hide the truth from us!” Kaminari shouted after their retreating forms. “What are you hiding! Is it the government?”

“Wait, what?” was the last thing Izuku heard, Kirishima’s tone perplexed. “What does the government—” before Bakugou kicked the classroom door behind the two of them. He stomped angrily toward the dorms, seemingly unaffected by Izuku’s dragging, stumbling feet.

“Kacchan,” Izuku choked. “I can walk!”

“You say that, but you weren’t walking. You were too damn busy ogling our annoying fuckin’ classmates.”

Feet catching onto the floor, Izuku fumbled his way out of Bakugou’s grip. He hastened after his marching friend, Mephi-chan ambling after the two at their quickened pace. “I wasn’t ogling,” Izuku protested, out of breath and mildly self-conscious. “It’s just. They’re just having fun, making HeroTube videos about this whole situation. They don’t mean any harm.”

“And that has nothing to do with our most annoying classmates being ‘nice to look at’, huh?”

“...maybe a little bit,” Izuku admitted. “When they’re all smiling at me and telling me how happy they are that All Might is calling himself my dad, I just can’t stay mad at them. Having friends is just so emotionally overwhelming.”

“Ugh,” Bakugou grunted. “Gross. More sentiment. What happened to focusing on the damn mission?”

“I am focused! I’ve got the t-shirts in my bag. Oh, and the All For One figurine I designed for Mephi-chan—”

“The what?”

“—well, after Mephi-chan chewed through the Stain figure, I realized that it was very cathartic to see the gnawed, plastic remains of his ugly face. And then I started thinking about the business potential of other villain chew toys…” Izuku trailed off, mumbling about the enterprise opportunities of a made-to-break villain toy line.

Bakugou was giving Izuku a look, a sideways sort of grimace, as the two of them hastily made their way back to the dorms to get their things together. “Uh huh. So. You made your own All For One figure.”

“Well it’s not like I could just buy one!” 

“....right. Y’know what, don’t show it to me yet. I want my reaction to that thing to be as genuine as it can fuckin’ be when All For Dumb sees it tonight.”

Izuku beamed. “That’s the spirit, Kacchan! Personally, I’m hoping he’s so offended that he chokes and dies right on the spot!”

Oh, fucking hell, Bakugou thought, for once keeping his mouth sealed tight in a grimace. Izuku’s menacing grin haunted the corner of his eyes. This conspiracy shit has brought the absolute worst out of this fuckin’ loser.

Bakugou thought back to the oppressive, menacing aura that had frozen him to the spot in Kamino. Next to him, Izuku was exuding a threatening anticipation. They weren’t the same—no fuckin’ way could Deku be as haunting as the evil douche—but the oozing anger was similar enough to be….concerning.

All For One wasn’t ready for how much his brat took after him.

In hindsight, Izuku probably shouldn’t have worn the Mighty Family t-shirt on the train home.

At first, he and Bakugou were able to board without trouble. Izuku was really a very plain, inconspicuous person, he thought. Sure, the green hair wasn’t the most common thing, but in a world where his classmate had an honest-to-gods bird head, green hair was as unnoticeable as having a particularly bright-colored tie. Throughout his life, Izuku had faded into the background.

Even the Nomu hunched under their seats and behind their legs, somehow, went unnoticed. Maybe it was the massive sun hat Izuku had shoved onto its head, and the sweater he had shoved over its limbs. Mephi-chan just looked like an ugly, lumpy hairless dog in an equally ugly, lumpy outfit. 

Izuku probably should’ve accounted for the recent interest the media had taken in him. In him and All Might, specifically, he realized, as another passenger did a furious doubletake at his t-shirt.

Oh no, Izuku had time to think, gripping Bakugou’s sleeve in desperation. Don’t look too closely. I am a normal boy, in a normal t-shirt, that doesn’t have a club dedicated to my paternity at school —

“Hey!” said another passenger, an older man who looked like he had just left the office, suit a bit disheveled. “That t-shirt. You’re that kid from the news, right? All Might’s kid!”

At that announcement, nearly every passenger in the car perked their heads and turned in interest, eyes wide and mouths gaping. “Whoa!” said a woman, leaning forward and blinking at Izuku like a bug behind glass. “You so are! You’ve even got one of those t-shirts! Hey, what is it like having All Might—”

The rest of the train ride was an endless, loud cacophony, complete strangers dangling themselves into Izuku’s personal space. He’d lost count of how many unwitting selfies he’d been pulled into. At his side, Bakugou was a fuming, barking guardian, doing his best to swat away the most obnoxious people from latching onto him.

“You just had to wear the damn t-shirt on the way over, hah?” he hissed, teeth bared at the strangers closest to grabbing at Izuku’s arm. “You couldn’t just change when we got there, or wear a fuckin’ hat.”

“I didn’t- I didn’t think—no one’s even noticed the Nomu !” Izuku whispered back, just as furiously. “Is wearing a t-shirt with my own face on it really enough to make me stick out in a crowd? I’ve never been recognized in public in my life. How do I stick out more than a mutated monster?”

“People are idiots,” Bakugou said. “And it’s wearing a sun hat.”

As if in agreement with Bakugou’s declaration regarding the public’s intelligence, a girl around their age leaned into their personal bubble. “Aww, what a cute dog!” she cooed. “And he’s even got a little sweater and big ol’ hat!”

“Thanks,” Izuku agreed blankly, mentally exhausted. “I tried killing it and banishing it, but it just wouldn’t die and kept following me around. So now I make it carry my stuff.”

There was a silence in the train car following that statement. “I see,” eeked out the girl. She shifted away, stumbling into a group of other passengers. “Well. Bye.”

Significantly fewer people came up to Izuku after that. Izuku reveled in the sudden space and relative quiet he was granted. “Huh,” he murmured, tapping at his lower lip. “So violence and threats are helpful when you want to be left alone, I guess…”

Next to him, Bakugou shivered.
Chapter 11
Notes:

    my promotion at work has my brain working overtime into a fried lump, but!! i managed to get this out within a good time. alas, in this chapter our cast are still apart. i'm thinking next chapter i'll be able to drag everyone into the same house. hisashi and tomura are my faves to write tbh, really any amoral character. there's just something about characters that operate outside of societal ethics. problematic faves.

Chapter Text

Tomura had mostly sequestered himself away the past week, immersing himself (reluctantly) in the thrilling world of Friendship Simulators. So, when he emerged from his room to speak to Hisashi, the man was already caught off guard.

“Sensei,” his disciple began, and then said a sentence that no parent wants to hear: “Your child is trending online again.”

Oh no, Hisashi thought, mentally running through an endless list of things that could have gone wrong. “I see,” he said, voice tempered. “And for what reason is my son a topic of conversation?”

If his son could just not attract attention for one week—the dinner was tonight! What could Izuku have possibly managed to get himself into? Well, actually, better not ask that question. The real question was how deep Izuku could manage to get into shit, because the shit, somehow, always found his son.

“You should really get a Twitter…” Tomura grumbled, tapping away at his phone as he presumably found what he intended to show him, and Hisashi shook his head with a smile.

“My boy, you already have so much to say about my accessibility tools. Do you really want to hear my screen reader shouting out Twitter opinions all afternoon?”

“Oh. No, that would kill me, actually.”

Hisashi hummed in agreement, returning to his current task of dismembering a corpse as he waited on Tomura. Some of his followers hadn’t had the best reaction to their overpowered boss escaping from prison. Unfortunately, more than a few of the little rats had assumed Hisashi was going to be locked away for good—goodness knows why, it’s not like this was the first time he had escaped from jail!—and he could hardly let dissenters run free.

Thus, the corpses. And Hisashi was hardly one to waste valuable resources. Thus, the dismemberment. Recycling at its finest.

He was a sustainability-conscious villain; one could hardly let perfectly good limbs and organs go to waste.

Medical science in the era of quirks really owed him a great debt, not that the government would ever admit it. For leeches on societies, government officials could be so absurdly squeamish. They were just bodies . Everyone had bodies! Death was a totally natural part of life—and so were limbs.

Thankfully, Tomura was raised with the maturity to disregard a few stray detached extremities. Hisashi was good at parenting.

“He was on the train,” Tomura said finally, dragging Hisashi’s attention back to the topic at hand (and away from the hand he was dismantling). The boy continued, his voice a flat drawl, “Looks like he was dragged into a bunch of selfies, though I don’t think he was too happy about it. He looks like a startled green deer. With a bush on its head.”

“Ah, my poor boy has always been a bit shy,” Hisashi sighed fondly. “Though I hardly see why everyone feels the need to hound Izuku. Frankly, I’m surprised he was recognized at all! He’s rather plain—”

“He’s wearing a t-shirt with him and All Might on it,” Tomura drawled plainly, “one that says the bastard’s his father. It’s got both of ‘em on it, smiling and shit. Chibis.”

Hisashi froze, wrist-deep into some straggler’s chest cavity. “...I must have heard that wrong, Tomura. Did you say—”

“It’s one of these ugly ‘Mighty Family’ t-shirts. And all the pics he’s in have the hashtags too: #MightyFamiy, #MyBoy, #FatherAllMight. It’s disgusting.”

Although he could hardly breathe fire into a mechanical respirator, Hisashi could feel puffs of smoke curling out of his mouth. His lungs were hot, burning with righteous anger, and the smog found its way out of his mask despite him suppressing any actual fire.

“Father All Might,” he hissed, hands clenching tight around some organ, pulverizing the thing into a gory pulp. “What is he, some religious figure? That is. This is absurd.” Hisashi spun around, stalking and spreading smoke across his workshop floor. He paced restlessly.

“Yeah,” grunted Tomura, face scrunched up and watching him warily over his phone. He shifted in place. “Uh. For what it’s worth, Little Brother doesn’t look too happy to be in the photos.”

“I gave him a Nomu.”

“The Nomu’s in the selfies too, actually. It’s got a big hat on and a sweater and shit.” Tomura squinted at his screen, muttering reluctantly, “Actually, it’s kind of cute. Like a special edition mount.”

Hisashi strode toward his successor, who startled a bit. Doubtlessly he was a bit of a sight: a 6’6”, bulky, suited, and blood-coated masked figure wasn’t the most reassuring character. Regardless, Hisashi was a man on a furious mission, and he gripped Tomura’s arms with bloody hands.

“Tomura,” he said.

Tomura waited for him to continue, and when he didn’t, the boy awkwardly patted at one of Hisashi’s clenched, bloody hands encouragingly. “There, there,” he said, face twisting in some uncomfortable attempt at reassurance. Likely, it was a try at a comforting smile, but Tomura, deprived of such affections, was stuck trying to mimic the pixelated faces he’d studied on screens. Hisashi had never seen nor heard the boy attempt such a look before, so he could only assume his rehabilitation had done its job.

Nonetheless, it was creepy as fuck. Hisashi released his successor’s arms, fists clenching and unclenching in contemplation.

“Tomura,” he repeated, “I am going to win.”

“I know, Sensei. You’re a- uh, you’d be a way better dad than All Might.”

“Izuku must know that I plan on making a fantastic first impression tonight,” Hisashi continued, hand rising to tap at his mask. He pulled out his phone from his suit pocket, saying loudly, “Phone, bring up a text to Izuku.”

“Uh, Sensei, are you sure you should—When did you get his number?” His successor had the insolence to sound surprised; as if Hisasi reaching out to his son was a bad idea, and as if he wouldn’t have sought out a way to contact Izuku. He was hardly an amateur at this whole ‘family’ thing. He was married !

“I know what I’m doing, Tomura,” Hisashi interrupted, lying, but with great determination. How hard could it be to be a doting father? He had only been gone for a decade or so. “And I obtained it from Inko, of course. Phone, text Izuku: My boy, comma, this is your father, period. I look forward to seeing you this evening, period.” He paused, considering the best way to let his son know that he planned on blowing Yagi out of the water. “My parenting will be so overwhelming with undaunting love that you will never smile at All Might again, period. Send text.”

“...Sensei are you sure —”

“I helped raise Izuku for the first four years of his life, my boy,” Hisashi declared, shoving his phone back into his pocket. He’d have to remember to wipe the blood off the screen later; he had to make an excellent first impression, after all, and the dinner was only hours away.

Despite his disgust at Izuku’s clothing choices, he could appreciate the deviousness and spite that doubtlessly fuelled the selection. Izuku was showing Hisashi his true colors, the Izuku that hid behind the pretenses of hero society. His boy was truly ruthless, donning garments denying his connection to his loving, villainous father on the very night they were to reunite for the first time in nearly a decade. How cruel.

As much as he wanted to burn the t-shirt into a fiery crisp, he also wanted to pat his son on the back for his savagery. 

And also get the boy into an actual shirt, one with buttons and a collar. If the rest of Izuku’s wardrobe remained much the same as it was in his childhood, it was undoubtedly filled with kitschy t-shirts titled with their function or designation. Gods only knew the amount of hero merchandise, too, that filled his closet. Hisashi shivered in disgust. Yes, he’d have to get his son a proper suit or ten. 

His phone chimed. Embarrassingly, he found his heart racing just a bit. 

Hisashi rushed to retrieve it from his pocket, while Tomura visibly braced himself, heat signature stiffening and temperature rising with stress. Really, he had no need to be so tense; Hisashi knew to expect Izuku’s tongue to be nothing less than cutting. He had so much ground to make up with his son, after all, but he planned on sticking around now and being the good, villainous influence Izuku needed in his life.

“Phone, read the text from Izuku.”

In its loud, robotic voice, his phone noted, “Image attached.” 

It said nothing else, which left Hisashi a bit surprised; Izuku was not a boy of few words.

He blinked, understanding dawning quickly. “Ah,” he said. “Right. He doesn’t know I’m blind.” With the way he fought at Kamino, anyone that didn’t get a close look at his mask-less face would have no way of guessing he couldn't see. He thought for a moment, considering, then called, “Tomura.”

“Sensei.”

“You heard my phone.”

“Hard not to hear it,” his successor muttered, which Hisashi again chose to kindly ignore. He left his phone’s volume for text to speech louder than the average man because he participated in louder than average hobbies, like dismembering corpses with a table saw.

(He may be blind, visibly, but he wasn’t blind to microaggressions regarding his visual disability.)

“Well,” Hisashi said, tone professional and calm, “I can hardly ignore whatever image my son has sent me. We’re meeting with him tonight, after all. Despite his usual thoughtfulness, he seems to have forgotten to add a descriptive caption, as per typical electronic courtesy. Please,” Hisashi gestured, phone in hand outstretched toward Tomura, “describe the image Izuku has texted me.”

Tomura took his phone with hesitant fingertips, grimacing. He stared down at the screen for a few solid minutes, deciphering both the image and, more importantly, how to describe it to Sensei.

There was no way to soften the blow. Tomura had studied friendship and neighborly kindness for an entire week of endless simulation gaming, but Tom Nook couldn’t save him from having to say the terrible truth.

“It’s a meme, Sensei.”

Hisashi blinked, baffled but determined. “...describe the meme to me, Tomura. In relentless detail.”

“What—ughh, no. Who does that.”

“The blind,” Hisashi declared, maybe a bit threatening, aura radiating his tension regarding the evening’s dinner. “Tomura. I must reconnect with my son, and I cannot fail to All Might in my ability to read Izuku’s texts. Describe. The meme. ”

Tomura opened and closed his mouth a few times, struggling on every level, primarily mentally, to gather the strength to describe a stupid meme to his Sensei. Finally, he relented, voice rasping, “It’s...an image of All Might, but mostly greyed out. The eyes are, uh, red with lasers. He’s glaring, with the laser-eyes. There’s English impact text over the bottom of the image. It says, ‘Then perish’ in all caps.”

Hisashi considered this. Tomura slumped a bit in place, legs growing weak, energy spent on the demanding task of describing his little brother’s stupid meme to the king of the underworld.

“What could this mean,” Hisashi muttered to himself. Tomura stared in confusion, because he thought it was pretty damn obvious, but his Sensei continued mumbling. “Obviously there’s the literal meaning. Izuku is issuing a threat, so to speak, a verbal challenge of wits. It’s only logical that he disputes my claim, as he is the successor to my brother’s quirk, and the usage of All Might’s visage further displays his loyalties. Not to mention his uncouth affection for Yagi. Clearly, my boy is letting me know that he’s prepared for the emotional campaign that will inevitably occur tonight. It’s a proud statement, fearless of—”

“It’s a meme, Sesei. He’s just,” Tomura grunted, voice strangled, gesturing with the phone still gripped in his hand (pinky raised). “He’s just messing with you. Don’t read into it.”

“It’s not ‘reading into’ things to discus and dissect media. Izuku is an intelligent boy. He wouldn’t send such a powerful image without fully unraveling its meanings.”

“It’s All Might with red laser eyes. It’s not that deep, Sensei.”

Hisashi drew himself up, retrieving his phone from Tomura’s uncertain grip. “I must respond in kind,” he mumbled. “I have to let Izuku know that I am prepared to face his challenge head-on. And that I’m not out of touch, so to speak.”

Tomura edged away, subtly skirting the edge of the room toward the door to his own. “Well, anyway,” he said quickly, “just thought I’d let you know Little Brother is trending. I’m gonna go get dressed for dinner, in the clothes you got me, Sensei. And I have to go over some dialogue options so I remember how to talk extra kind and shit.”

“Oh, no. I need you, my boy. After all, a blind man can hardly craft the perfect JPEG.”

“Sensei,” Tomura gritted out, strained. His palms were sweating. “I gotta...gotta talk to my villagers. I need to study being friendly, like you assigned me.”

“You’ve had the week to study up, Tomura,” Hisashi declared, phone held up like a weapon. Tomura had never really felt threatened by Sensei, but the stubborn rage oozing from him had him stiffening in unease. Tone dark, Hisashi demanded, “Help me respond to Izuku. Create a meme that will sway my son’s loyalties to his true family.”

Hands unsteady, pinkies raised and face twisted in a grimace, Tomura took his Sensei’s phone and started editing his reply.

“I can’t believe I just sent that to All For One,” Izuku muttered to himself, hands twisting anxiously together. He and Bakugou (and Mephi-chan) had disembarked from the train, barely managing to dart away from Izuku’s admirers, and they were nearly to his mom’s house. Izuku’s stomach squirmed when he thought of how he’d have to face his evil biodad across his kitchen table.

“You didn’t send it to All For One,” Bakugou corrected gruffly. “You sent it to your evil, loser sperm donor. Remember, he may be a superpowered creep, but he’s still your shitty old man.”

“Right,” Izuku said. He hadn’t entirely convinced himself of that yet—logically, he knew that they’d long since confirmed the man he’d be meeting tonight was his dad, and logically he knew that this was the same man that had broken out of Tartarus. Logically, he knew he’d be having dinner with his biological father, who just happened to be a centuries-old villain.

But emotionally...well. Emotionally, he was in hell.

Bakugou kicked at the ground, then stuck his leg out to trip Mephi-chan. Predictably, that didn’t exactly work; Mephi-chan was built to be impervious, after all, and it had four sturdy legs. Thus, Mephi-chan merely hobbled awkwardly over Bakugou’s outstretched leg, open maw dripping onto his friend’s limb. Bakugou recoiled.

“Fuckin’ gross,” he hissed, shaking his leg free of Nomu drool. As much as Izuku hated having an assigned Nomu, he couldn’t help but relish in the moment. He may have forgiven his friend, but a little karma for poorly behaved boys never hurt.

No, he chided himself. No, Izuku, let’s be kind and spite-free. He’d been more bitter than usual, recently, he couldn’t help but notice. It probably had something to do with a gaggle of their classmates obsessing over his genetic origins. Regardless, Izuku was determined to not be spiteful. He didn’t want to be mad at his classmates when they were all so kind, and so heroic, and so nosy, not minding their own business, heroes —

“Anyway,” Bakugou grumbled, shoving the indignity behind him, “why’d you send your old man a meme? I thought you’d wanna be all noble ‘n shit, but the look on your face when you saw the bastard’s text was fuckin’ pissed.”

Izuku blushed, rubbing at his face. “Ah, so embarrassing,” he whined. “I don’t want to be so angry. I just thought- well, mostly I thought it would be funny. He’s really old, right? And probably wealthy and pretentious, based on how he’s been in a position of power. So, he’s probably really out of touch, I thought, and making him have to decipher a threatening meme would be really funny. Like, good luck, evil quirk-boomer grandpa, right?”

His friend just stared at him for a moment, eyes squinting like Izuku was improperly assembled furniture and he couldn’t figure out where the manufacturer had gone wrong. Such a look was hardly warranted, in Izuku’s opinion.

“Uh-huh,” he finally grumbled. “Right. Anyway, you think he’s gonna look like he did at Kamino?”

“Like…?”

“Y’know, face all fucked up ‘n shit. He didn’t have any damn eyes when All Might punched his Darth Vader helmet off.”

“ Don’t, ” Izuku hissed, freezing in place. He glared hard at Bakugou, face going fierce. Maybe this was a little overkill, a little harsh, but he wouldn’t tolerate any language related to that topic. “We don’t use the Star-words anymore. Don’t even reference its characters.”

Bakugou blinked at him rapidly, hands smoking a bit at his sides. He looked more than a little startled at Izuku’s outburst. Izuku huffed in a deep, calming breath.

“We all know what his mask looked like,” Izuku mumbled, returning to their previous, calm pace, headed toward his childhood house. “ If it was similar to any fictional properties, we don’t have to say it, ‘cause we all already know.”

His friend was giving him that look again. For no reason! Izuku wasn’t behaving any different than usual, and if he was, it was just because people kept trying his damn patience. Which was only to be expected when people referenced Space Battles and paternity theories around him all the damned time, gods—calm down, Izuku.

Bakugou just faced forward and proceeded as if Izuku hadn’t radiated sheer malice. The two weren’t terribly far from Inko’s, anyway. Bakugou continued, huffing, “...okay. His mask, that didn’t look like anything at-fuckin’-all, y’think he’s still wearing it?”

“Hmm.” Izuku tapped at his lower lip, considering. “Well, he could hardly heal himself within the two weeks he’s been out of prison, right?”

“Why not? He could, I dunno, go grab someone like Eri, couldn’t he? Fix his shit?”

Izuku shook his head, amused at Bakugou’s amateur quirk theory. Maybe if his friend hadn’t spent his youth belittling Izuku’s hobby, he would have a better understanding of how these things worked. “I highly doubt it. For one, it’s unlikely Eri’s quirk could fix his body entirely.”

Face scrunched in confusion (which, on Bakugou, always looked more like indignation), Bakugou gestured with his hands, asking, “Why not? Can’t she rewind shit?”

“Well, yes, but think about the biology behind rewind. She can rewind matter, but if you consider thermodynamics, I don’t think she can recreate mass no longer in existence. That is to say, she’s likely not able to recreate destroyed organs from nothing. Maybe if he had similar, spare organ matter available to reshape…” he trailed off, then shook his head. “Well, if we consider other quirks, if he took the eyes of someone else, that could work? But organ transfers are tricky even with quirks, the rejection rates—”

“Holy shit, okay.” For some reason, Bakugou looked kind of green and squeamish. Izuku didn’t think quirk theory was that upsetting. “Probably not Eri. Maybe some fuckin’ organ transfer quirk, which who fuckin’ knows who has that shit. So he’s probably still blind, right?”

“Well, with deep enough connections he could access the quirk registry to find someone with that quirk, but the timeframe—Oh,” he said, coming to an abrupt stop. “Oh, no. He’s probably still blind. This is terrible.”

With a firm shove, Bakugou kept him walking. His mom’s house was in sight, at this point, but Izuku’s mind was racing furiously. Bakugou demanded, “What’s got you freaking out? Ain’t that a good thing, if he’s still blind.”

“For Japan, yes,” Izuku answered, heart racing and determination wavering. His gut stirred anxiously. “But, Kacchan, I sent him a meme! And- and the t-shirts!”

“Hahh?”

“He won’t be able to read them,” Izuku uttered, staring despondently at the stairs in front of him. All they needed to do was climb the old, metal stairs, and take a sharp turn to the left, and the two of them would be at his mother’s house for the night. The evening’s dinner was so close, but Izuku couldn’t help mourning his plan before it had even come to fruition. “It was a JPEG, Kacchan. And I didn’t even consider accessibility.” Disappointment in himself was creeping in.

Mouth hanging in disbelief, face scrunched in anger, Bakugou exclaimed, “Wha- didn’t you send that out of fuckin’ spite anyway? Who cares if he has to have someone else read it?!”

“Oh,” Izuku said, suddenly feeling short-sided. And a little silly. That was- “That’s genius, Kacchan, thank you. It’s probably so demeaning for him to have to stoop to having some underling read his memes for him. He must have been so embarrassed. You’re so smart, Kacchan.”

“I am,” Bakugou said, grabbing at Izuku’s arm and beginning to pull the other boy up the stairs behind him. He continued, “And you’re acting dumber than normal. He’s bringing Hands with him tonight, right? That bastard will be able to read ‘em. And he’ll hardly be able to keep his mouth shut when he sees All Might t-shirts on his keeper’s wife ‘n kid.” Bakugou smirked. “Ha, he’s gonna flip his shit. It’s a good thing I’m here to see it and to make sure Auntie’s safe if he really loses it.”

Izuku smiled up at his friend, appreciative of his forward-thinking and go-get-them attitude. And his animosity, when it was pointed at someone else. Yes, Kacchan was a great influence, an intelligent comrade, a real piece of—

“Fuckin’—” Bakugou stumbled, grip going hot around Izuku’s arm. Izuku yelped, and Bakugou released his arm immediately, patting at the burnt location apologetically, as he turned to bark at the figure camping out in front of Izuku’s childhood home. “Oi, bastard! Who the fuck are you!”

Izuku braced himself, gaze narrowing at the shadow lurking around the corner. It was a tall man’s silhouette, shifting awkwardly in the evening’s shadows, and the man had obviously been haunting the area, waiting for someone to approach. Thankfully, it wasn’t broad enough to be his biodad. Izuku couldn’t see the man’s features in the dim lighting, but he loaded up a low percentage of One For All, just in case. Had All For One sent someone ahead to scout him out?

“Er. My boy…”

And he dropped his quirk just as quickly. “All Might?!” Izuku squawked, squinting at the figure shuffling out of the shadows. Hands raised in surrender, Toshinori’s tall, emaciated figure emerged from around the corner.

“Yes, ah,” his father-figure started, hands lowering to wring in front of himself anxiously. He coughed, fist guarding his mouth from possible blood-spray. “Yes. I know I was not supposed to come, given that Young Shigaraki will be accompanying your father tonight, but I….Well.” Blond hair catching the dying rays of the sunset, Toshinori briefly rose to his full height, face set in determination. “I simply could not leave you to face All For One by yourself, regardless of your relation or his intentions.”

It was a beautiful declaration of familial love. Despite his atrophied form, Toshinori was resolved and brave and—”Ah, hell,” Bakugou groaned, reaching into his backpack. “The nerd’s already crying and we haven’t even gone inside.”

Izuku sniffed, “I can’t help it!” and gracefully accepted the crumpled tissue packet Bakugou shoved into his hands. He wiped at his tears and blew his nose, Toshinori coming over to pat him on the back reassuringly.

“Izuku,” Toshinori said, hand firm on his shoulder. “Know that no matter how this evening goes, I will remain by your side. And if that bastard thinks he can take you from me, he has another thing coming.”

This, of course, led to Izuku wailing loudly, burying his tear-stained face into Toshinori’s chest. Bakugou grimaced. “Yeah,” he grunted, staring at the ground awkwardly, “That’s nice ‘n all, but the reason Auntie didn’t want you coming tonight was ‘cause that Hands Bastard is a loose fuckin’ cannon. You should—”

Before Bakugou could finish advising Toshinori to abandon ship while he still had the chance, the door to Izuku’s childhood home flew open. In the doorway, flustered and clutching at a kitchen rag, Inko smiled widely.

“I would recognize that crying anywhere,” she said, visibly fighting back her own, reactionary tears. “You’re such a loud crier, my Izuku!”

“Mom!” Izuku exclaimed, worming his way out of Toshinori’s grip and flinging himself into his mom’s hug. “It’s so good to see you! It’s been so long, I’m sorry.”

Bakugou groaned, grumbling to no one, apparently, “Fine, guess All Might’s gonna get dusted tonight, great plan. And it’s only been two fuckin’ weeks.” He marched over, wrestling Izuku’s backpack off of his entangled form. “Hi, Auntie,” he greeted, nodding at Inko before making his way indoors, both his and Izuku’s ugly backpack in tow. “I’ll put our shit down and go set the table.”

“Oh, Katsuki dear, you don’t have to!”

“No offense,” he called from further in the apartment, “but I don’t wanna drown in two crybabies’ tears tonight before I have the chance to eat!”

Inko huffed, patting at Izuku one last time before pushing him to arms’ length. She scanned his form, as though he would have changed in any way in the two weeks since she’d last seen him in person. “I’m so happy to have the family together tonight,” she said idly. “Even your bastard of a father. Although, Toshi—” she shot him a quick, doubting frown. “We discussed this, you know! That boy my husband adopted, Tomura, isn’t he...not a fan?”

Toshinori huffed, shrugging. “That is certainly an understatement,” he said, voice more of a mumble. “Frankly, I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t try to disintegrate me at some point tonight.”

“Toshi!” Inko exclaimed, wavering.

“Oh, I’ll be fine, Inko,” Toshinori continued, bringing Inko into a hug alongside Izuku. He patted both of them on the head with his large, skeletal hands. “I just didn’t want Izuku to have to face.... that man alone tonight,” he gritted, “Even in my current form, I want to protect my family.”

Izuku, naturally, proceeded to tear up and sniffle at All Might calling him ‘family.’ Inko patted Izuku’s red face consolingly, glancing up at Toshinori with affection. “Really, Toshi,” she sighed, face blushing just a bit at how openly loving the man was with her son. “I appreciate it, truly. And it’s good to see you. Any family get together would be incomplete without you! But, please, for this family’s sake—” Inko took one of Toshiori’s hands in both of her own, gazing up at him imploringly. “Let’s give Hisashi the benefit of the doubt tonight, alright?”

Toshinori nodded, face set in a gritted smile. He accompanied Izuku and Inko inside, large hands braced on their backs. “Oh, I have plenty of doubt. But none to his benefit.”

Like hell was he going to give up his place in this family to that man, that- interloper. Like Toshinori would just let the leader of Japan’s underworld corrupt his innocent, heroic son.

Yes, Toshinori would doubt All For One. He would doubt him enough for all three of them. He’d doubt that man six feet deep into the ground.

Chapter Text

“Oh,” said Toshinori, guilty. “You, uh. You were the one that took the t-shirt I ordered, huh?”

Izuku smiled beatifically. Clutched in a white-fisted hand, the Mighty Family t-shirt dangled, damning evidence of Toshinori’s compliance. “I was looking out for you, Toshinori! I wouldn’t want yours to get lost before tonight, after all. And I mean, it’s not like you were going to keep this a secret, right?”

“Right,” Toshinori agreed, sweating. What was with this pressure? “Er… my boy.” He took the t-shirt gingerly, stepping away. “I’ll just… go put this on.”

Bakugou watched All Might scurry off to the bathroom to change, the man’s face red and sheepish. “What kind of cowardly reaction was that,” he grumbled. “If he’s gonna order it, he may as well man up to it.”

“Oh, leave him be, Katsuki,” Inko chided happily, fussing from her place in the kitchen. She’d already changed into one of the garish t-shirts; when Izuku had pulled her matching outfit from his stuffed backpack, his mom had clapped her hands to her mouth and proceeded to tear up. “They’re so ugly,” she had whispered. “I love them.”

The shirt’s print was entirely obscured by Inko’s apron, so it was a relatively pointless wardrobe change, but hey, Izuku thought, it was the thought that counts.

And Izuku had a lot of thoughts recently that weren’t so heroic. Thoughts like smearing his biodad’s face in the dirt and dragging his classmates through the UA hallways in a parade of shame. Lining up 1-A like an execution, and summarily listing off their many, many sins.

But that wouldn’t be heroic. Couldn’t think those thoughts!

“He’s just embarrassed,” Inko continued, sounding unduly fond. “To think he loves you so much but feels like he has to hide it. What a silly old man.”

Toshinori emerged from the bathroom, adorned in his own ugly t-shirt. It hung off his skeletal body like an unflattering rag. “Please, Inko,” he said, tugging at the shirt awkwardly, face still pink. “I’m only a handful of years older than you.”

“But you’re so much older in spirit, silly man.”

Bakugou gagged, shoving his way into the bathroom to change. “Gross. Can you two save the damn flirting? At least ‘til the real old man gets here.” He closed the door behind him firmly.

Inko paused in her dinner prep, head tilting a bit. “Ah, I knew he was older when we married. I assumed he was maybe a decade or so older than me…”

With a suppressed, bloody cough, Toshinori lowered himself onto the sofa. He and Izuku exchanged a quick, panicked glance, before Izuku stared uncomfortably at the ground. “Well,” said Toshinori, “he’s certainly. Older than you.”

With a disparaging stare, Inko turned to face Toshinori. Between his sitting and her standing, their heights evened out, leaving the two at roughly eye-level. “Don’t feel the need to shelter me, Toshi,” she chided. She propped her hands on her hips. “I’ve already come to terms with my husband being an underworld mafia boss. Don’t bother keeping something like my husband’s age from me.”

With impeccable timing, Bakugou naturally chose that moment to come marching out of the bathroom. He wore their school blazer over the ugly t-shirt, as though attempting to maintain some amount of dignity. “He’s older than dirt, Aunty. From what the two idiots told me, he’s over 200. Old as balls.”

Inko blinked, dish rag flopping into the sink. “Goodness. Well. I always was drawn to older men…” 

Izuku hollered in despair, clapping his hands over his ears. “Mom, no!”

“Oh, Izuku, he hardly looks a day over 40! Frankly, he didn’t seem to quite act his age. You know, what with him being a vir—”

“No, no no,” Izuku chanted, doing his very best to shut this conversation out of his mind. He wondered if he could convince Shinsou to use his quirk to help him forget the last ten seconds or so ever happened. Thankfully, he was saved by the bell, very literally; his phone chimed from his pants pocket, and Izuku scrambled for the perfect excuse to physically and mentally leave the conversation. He dragged out his phone, scurrying from the kitchen and throwing himself next to Toshinori on the sofa.

He was quiet for a few solid minutes, face screwing up in confusion at his phone. He felt like an archeologist attempting to discern some forgotten ruins. The taxing look on his face eventually was too much for his friend to bear, apparently, because Bakugou snapped his fingers in front of Izuku’s face, fingers blocking his view of his phone screen with mini pop! s of his quirk. “Oi, nerd. What the hell did he send you? You look like you gotta shit.”

Eloquent as always, Izuku thought. Nonetheless, he was grateful to be snapped out of his dazed stupor, turning his phone screen around to face his friend. “What does this mean,” he implored.

Squinting at the screen, Bakugou scrutinized the villain’s response. It took just a moment for him to both grimace in disgust and—despite his best efforts to not enjoy a villain’s reply to an outdated meme—snort disbelievingly. “Pretty fuckin’ obvious, isn’t it? You sent him some ancient shit memes, so how was he supposed to reply.”

“Not like this,” Izuku said miserably. “It doesn’t make any sense. But it’s...funny. I hate it.”

“What did that man send you?” Toshinori asked, trying his best to peer over Izuku’s shoulder.

“Here,” Izuku sighed, shoving the phone at Toshinori, his other hand running anxiously through his hair. “I didn’t expect him to send one back. I just thought he’d respond with something like, I dunno, ‘Very funny, young man. But I will emerge victorious.’”

Eyes widening, his breath catching in his throat, Toshinori stared in horror at Izuku. That response… his boy had no business doing such an uncanny impression of All For One! He took the phone from Izuku’s hand robotically, resisting the urge to hide Izuku away from the world and all its influences, the urge to make sure Izuku never sounded so much like his nemesis ever again. To elicit such a response, whatever that man had sent must have been truly heinous.

He looked down at the phone in trepidation. He analyzed the image on the screen, then titled his head as though that would help him make sense of things.

It was a photo from the battle at Kamino, a shot of All For One hovering ominously above the battlefield. But Toshinori didn’t remember his enemy ever holding his arms out so stiffly, spine straight, arms spread wide threateningly. There was English text over the top of the image, reading simply in all caps: “WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY.” At the bottom of the image, obscuring Toshinori’s half-emaciated form facing his enemy, the screen displayed only the English words “bottom text.”

“I don’t get it,” he said. He was terribly confused. Was he really so out-of-touch? Is this what the kids were sending each other these days? “All For One never held his arms out like that.”

“It’s Photoshop,” Izuku said, “and he’s T-posing.”

“Erm, okay,” said Toshinori, though it wasn’t. “Did he forget to remove the words at the bottom?”

“No, that’s part of the humor, you know?”

He did not know.

Izuku retrieved his phone, locking it and stuffing it away with prejudice. “Don’t worry about it,” he consoled. “It’s ironic. And it’s a really, really old meme anyway. I sent him an old one, too.”

“I see,” Toshinori considered, trying to recover some of his dignity. “Perhaps I’m not so out-of-touch as I feared, then. I don’t understand what that man is trying to say with the joke he sent you, though.”

“Well, I sent him a meme that reinforced the idea that tonight’s confrontation will be proceeded by hostility. I chose an image of you so that he would understand that I had predisposed affection, to let him know that I would have your side right from the get-go. And I purposefully selected an older meme so that he would know that I know he’s old, and—”

“Shut up, gods,” Bakugou groaned, slumping in his seat. “All Might gets Dad Points for not getting memes, anyway. Shit isn’t that deep.”

“It is deep. Every image I exchange with—Kacchan,” Izuku said suddenly, frowning at his friend. He’d only just realized what he was wearing. “Don’t wear the blazer over the t-shirt. You can barely see the print. The whole point is to upset him!”

“Fuckin’ hell, fine.” He shrugged off the offending cover aggressively, throwing his blazer across the back of the couch and crossing his arms with an angry huff. “There. Now All For Dumb will get a face-full of stupid shirt. Not that he fuckin’ wants me here, anyway. I ain’t a part of this family.”

“Thank you, Kacchan,” Izuku said sweetly. “Remember, it’s about getting a reaction!”

“Er,” said Toshinori. He raised a hand like a student in a classroom, embarrassingly enough, before catching himself and lowering the hand self consciously to his lap. “I don’t mean to be a downer, but… my boy, you are aware that All For One is still blind, correct?”

“I know,” Izuku agreed. “He may not be seeing it with his own two eyes, but he might as well, because Shigaraki Tomura is going to blab the second he gets a glimpse of these shirts. He’s gonna hate them so much he won’t be able to stay quiet.”

“Right,” said Toshinori. Truthfully, all this ‘spite’ and ‘underhandedness’ didn’t make much sense to him. The only person he’d ever really, truly held a grudge against was the very man he was going to be confronting within the hour. He had never been one to implement overly-complex mechanactions to drive a target’s temper. How surprising, that his successor would have such a, uh, natural talent for subterfuge. “Shigaraki-shounen will be here to explain things for him. Like a seeing-eye-boy….”

Izuku stood suddenly. “Speaking of,” he said, gaze fixing on Toshinori determinedly. “You have to stay out-of-sight, at first. You’re my surprise trump card. I can’t show my hand right off the bat. I have to wait to see his hand, first.”

(“He’s got plenty of fuckin’ hands,” Bakugou snorted. “He ain’t hiding ‘em.”

“...Kacchan, that’s actually really funny, but now isn’t the time!”

“Hahh?! Don’t tell me what I can and can’t say, fucker!”)

“Er,” Toshinori said, weary. “You want me to hide?” Didn’t that defeat the purpose of him coming at all?

“Not exactly. Just… go hang out in my room, for now. Once he’s gone quiet, and everyone’s settled down, then you can come out. All For One will be too distracted with me and mom to notice you, at first. It shouldn’t take too long to get everyone around the table.”

“Yeah, he’s gonna be focused on you and Auntie,” Bakugou grunted, glaring. “And I’m gonna be stuck making eye contact with fuckin’ Hands. Why did I have to come, anyway.”

“You’re an honorary part of this family, Katsuki,” Inko said, stepping up next to the two boys and ruffling both of their hair. Bakugou grumbled and shifted away, but not entirely enough to completely dislodge Inko’s loving hands. “I didn’t want Izuku to have to deal with all of this alone, you know? It’s so much for a young man to have to bear, after all.”

“I’m not alone, mom! I have you and Toshinori.”

“But no one your age, Izuku,” Inko sighed, hand moving from Izuku’s hair to pat fondly at his cheek. “Talking with your parents isn’t the same as having a friend to confide in. And you’ve known Katsuki your whole life! Isn’t he, oh, something like a brother at this point?”

“Absolutely not, ” Izuku stated, purposefully not mentioning that Bakugou had been one of the first targets of his young bisexual awakening.

“Fuck no,” Bakugou said at the same time, purposefully not mentioning that Izuku had been one of the targets of his raging inferiority complex.

“Oh, you boys.” Inko shook her head. “You’re so stubborn, but you’re good kids at heart. I know there are things teenagers will refuse to tell their parents. You should have at least one of your friends with you to support you, you know!”

“Right,” Izuku agreed, mostly to get his mom to please stop. “I have Kacchan”—”you don’t have shit,” Bakugou interjected, “I just decided I’d come, nerd!”—”and Kacchan is enough. I mean. I tried to include everyone in my class, a little, but they…” he trailed off, frustration stewing and bubbling in his gut. He inhaled deeply to keep it down.

“But our classmates are even bigger idiots than this idiot,” Bakugou finished for him. “They won’t leave Deku the fuck alone, ever since this pick-your-dad shit started.”

Izuku hummed in agreement, rage trickling into his voice just a teensy bit. “They’re a little too forward with things,” he uttered. A miasma of anger seemed to saturate the air, making Bakugou grimace and Toshinori stiffen. Somehow, Inko seemed completely immune. “A little too insolent,” Izuku continued, “to the point where I kind of get the urge to crush th —”

The doorbell interrupted him, splitting the heavy, oppressive atmosphere. Toshinori jumped out of his seat, literally, and Bakugou’s hands sparked against the sofa. In an instant, Izuku seemed to recede sheepishly back into himself.

“Sorry about that,” he mumbled, tugging at his lip. “That keeps happening for some reason. It’s like there’s some other part of me that’s been showing itself recently, y’know?”

“Uh-huh,” Toshinori croaked, because what the fuck. “I’ll just go, uh. Hide, like you said, my boy.” He pet Izuku very carefully on the head, then shuffled down the hallway. Izuku turned his abashed smile back toward his mom and his friend.

“I’ll go get the door, sweetie,” his mom said, giving one last reassuring pat to Izuku’s cheek. She quickly fussed a bit in the kitchen, putting things in their place, before heading to the door. Bakugou seemed stiff, guarded.

“Kacchan?” Izuku asked, frowning. “Are you okay? You don’t have to stay, you know, I can tell my mom…”

“Shove off, nerd,” Bakugou grunted, shaking off his discomfort. Like hell he was going to admit he was starting to be a little weary of the nerd. There was nothing scary about Deku, he declared to himself. “I’m not gonna fuckin’ bail on you and Auntie. Someone’s gotta make sure Hands-fucker stays in line.”

Izuku took a deep breath, hands sweating. He wiped them on his pants, bracing his face at the sounds of a deep voice echoing from the doorway. “Right,” he said. He bit at his lip. “I’ve got this. It’s just my evil biodad. It’ll be fine.”

“Little brother,” came a dry, scratchy voice from way too close, a hand settling on Izuku’s shoulder with a delicately raised pinky.

Izuku yelped, activating Float and 5% of One For All on instinct, shooting himself into the ceiling.

“Inko,” Hisashi greeted, taking Inko’s hand and raising it to his lips, heart racing like a teenager on a first date. “You’re as lovely as always, my dear.”

“Hisashi,” Inko said sweetly, “You already told me you’re blind.”

“Ah,” said Hisashi. “Yes, but beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, th—er, I don’t have eyes but your beauty still shines through via your heat signature...”

There was a slightly strained silence, Inko’s hand delicately held in Hisashi’s increasingly sweaty grip. He could tell, through Heat Signature, that Inko’s heart was very much not racing in the same banner as his own. She wasn’t mad, but she wasn’t swooning. Think, Hisashi chided himself rapidly, Say something smooth.

“Sensei,” Tomura said from behind him, voice as scratchy as always. “I want to meet Inko-san. I’m wearing the gloves so I won’t destroy her accidentally.”

Hisashi screamed internally, face schooled like he had a normal successor trailing him like a sad, dusty dog. “Of course,” he said smoothly, ignoring the slightly narrowed brows on Inko’s face. “Come say hello to my wife, Tomura. Inko,” he said, and it wasn’t quite a plea, but it was definitely getting there. “This is my ward and...business successor, Tomura. He’s been very eager to meet you and Izuku.”

“I already met your son,” Tomura countered, stepping forward and bowing stiffly to Inko. “Except the feet were all wrong.”

“The...feet?” Inko asked carefully, reaching out and wrapping Tomura in a careful, one-armed hug. Tomura responded as though she had handed him a bar of gold, eyes wide and awed in her direction. Seeing this, Inko shot Hisashi a vaguely concerned look.

Hisashi mentally cursed himself for not preparing Tomura to not act like he was strategically deprived of physical affection. Sometimes he was a little too good at villainous grooming.

He cleared his throat. “He means to say that they got off on the wrong foot,” he clarified.

Expression softening, Inko turned her head back to his successor. “Oh, I’m sure that will be alright,” she comforted, her presence radiating motherly care. “Izuku is such a kind, forgiving boy. If you want to go ahead while us adults talk, Izuku is right through there”—she gestured to the living room, down past the entryway—”so you can go ahead and make up for your first impression, alright?”

Nodding, eyes moons of awe at her warm concern, Tomura stepped past Inko. “I will,” he said, already turning and facing the living room, from where Hisashi could hear teenage voices echoing in discussion. “I will,” Tomura repeated, firmer, “I’ll explain I wasn’t gonna kill him when I grabbed his throat in the mall.”

Inko startled. “What?!” she squeaked. But Tomura had already taken the opportunity to walk further into the apartment.

Ah, thought Hisashi, watching his successor disappear with a sense of deep foreboding. So I’m kind of fucked.

A moment passed, during which Hisashi considered the highlights of his long, long life passing him by. Inko turned slowly from the direction of the living room—Izuku had made a loud yelping sound, but the sound of three relatively calm voices reassured him that Tomura was being careful—and pinned Hisashi with a purposefully blank stare.

Diffuse the situation, he thought at himself. “I brought the scrapbook!” he blurted.

It was unexpected enough to break the tension. Inko furrowed her brows in confusion, posture losing its tension. “You brought it?” she asked. “But we have the scrapbook here.” The pinched look that remained on her face told Hisashi that Inko hadn’t realized that the version of the book she possessed wasn’t the original. Oh, no. Did she think he had desecrated such a precious family relic?

“Ah, no. That’s an edited version, as I’m sure you must have noticed,” Hisashi rushed to explain. “I didn’t want anyone seeing my face and getting suspicious of you—being associated with me in my prime was akin to painting a target on your back. I would never damage the original, though.” He reached into the laptop bag he had across his shoulder, pulling out said original. “I’ve kept it safe hidden away all these years.”

Hisashi offered the scrapbook out with delicate hands, and Inko took it just as carefully. She smoothed one hand over the glittery cover (‘Family is Everything’, in charming silver), opening the first pages and pausing at the photo of their wedding. It was moments like this that made Hisashi strongly consider searching out a quirk to recover his eyes; how he longed to flip through the pages of that lovingly crafted scrapbook and reminisce with his wife over photos of their son in his infancy, how he—

“I’m surprised you’re so nostalgic,” Inko hummed, gaze focused on a photo of the two of them holding up an infant Izuku. “Given that you left us for so long.”

Hisashi could feel himself sweating at the back of his neck, beading up at the back of his mask. “My dear,” he started, strained, “It’s as I explained over our last phone call. I left to protect you and Izuku, he was quirkless, I didn’t want to put you all in danger so—”

“Oh, I understand, Hisashi,” Inko sighed, closing the scrapbook with a soft click. Her hands traced over his bright red underline on the front, the line that dug into the soft cover under the word ‘Everything’. “I understand, but you couldn’t have called? Kept up with your son?”

“I called on his birthday…” Hisashi tried, though he knew it was a dangerous line to tread.

“You did. One day out of a year.”

“...in my defense, once you hit a hundred, the years all kind of—” he made a vague, wiggly hand-wave gesture “—blur together. Like, what’s a year of time, in retrospect?”

“It’s first grade, and then it’s middle school,” Inko said coldly. “And then your son is in the news because he’s found a father-figure that wants to stick around.”

Fuck, thought Hisashi, quite succiently. “Er,” he said, less succinctly. “I regret it, as you have heard—”

“Yes, Hisashi. I don’t want you to have to grovel twice. Once was plenty.” She sighed again, casting a quick gaze over her shoulder to where Hisashi could definitely hear the distinctive sounds of the Bakugou spawn’s popping quirk. Distantly, he hoped that Tomura was employing his very best manners. “Let’s not linger on past regrets,” Inko murmured, turning back to Hisashi and bringing a hand up to Hisashi’s shoulder. “I want Izuku to have the opportunity to know his father. I’ve missed you, dear. Even knowing what you were keeping from me, I miss the man I married.”

Hisashi felt himself melting. Inko had the unfailing ability to make anyone fall into her sweet demeanor, the skill of motherly-saccharine coos that could subdue even the dark king of the underworld. And underneath it all, such a delightful savageness. It wouldn’t really be Inko without the spite at her scarcely-there husband.

“My lovely wife,” Hisashi started, “I intend to stay in your and Izuku’s life. No one can take me from my family again, including myself and my own foolish decisions.” 

“Oh, you smoothtalker,” Inko chirped, stifling a giggle. “I would love to kiss my husband, at a time like this. Why the mask, dear?”

“...well. You know how I kind of, er, ghosted you both about six or so years ago?”

“I do,” Inko responded, voice still pleasant but with an undercurrent of I will not forget how you ghosted me. Hisashi cleared his throat, shivering a bit.

“Yes, well. You know about my employment at this point—”

“I”m aware you’re a high-ranking villain, yes.”

“—I’m the high-ranking villain,” Hisashi chuckled, which, shit, shouldn’t have said that probably. Inko was visibly unamused by Hisashi’s enjoyment at his own position on the foodchain. “Anyway!” he rushed, “All Might smashed my face off entirely.”

Inko blinked rapidly. Her eyes tracked over his mask, as though she could discern the face beneath it if she stared long enough. Shaking just a bit, her hand hovered over the surface of his mask. “He did something so violent?” she murmured. “All Might?”

Hisashi caught his wife’s hand in his own, holding it gently. “Indeed. I barely clung to life. I’m afraid what lies beneath my mask is mostly my face’s scarred remains.”

Eyes tracing the metal outlines of Hisashi’s mask, Inko was quiet for a moment. To Hisashi’s slight concern, the raised voices of Tomura, Izuku, and the Bakugou spawn could be heard from further within the apartment. He didn’t want to rush his wife’s sentimentality, but he did want to make sure that Tomura didn’t fuck everything up before Hisashi was even able to step foot into his family’s apartment.

“Let me see your face,” Inko said suddenly. “I’ve seen All Might’s wound. I know what to expect, but I want to see you. You can hardly wear this mask through dinner, dear.”

Well. She had a point.

With slightly trembling hands, Hisashi flipped a switch at the back of his mask, the hydraulics making a mechanical hiss. “I can’t go without the mask for too long,” Hisashi cautioned. “Probably a few hours, but it strains my lungs.” He lowered the mask slowly. 

To her credit, Inko’s only real reaction was the widening of her eyes. Her hand remained raised, and it traced over the scarred tissue of Hisashi’s face carefully. Then she raised onto her toes and kissed him lightly on his lips.

If Hisashi could still blush, he would.

Then the Bakugou spawn ruined the damn moment.

“ Fuck off! ” the brat hollered from within the apartment. He could hear the distinctive, raspy cackle of Tomura, and Izuku’s rapid pleading, behind the pops of the brat’s quirk. Inko startled, hand flying to her chest in surprise and eyes going wide.

“Oh dear,” she gasped. “I didn’t think Katsuki would react so strongly to meeting Tomura. I know you said he was a villain, but I didn’t think Tomura made such a strong impression on him…”

“Oh,” said Hisashi. “That would be because it was Tomura that took Bakugou from their training camp this last summer.”

There was a pause. Inko had gone very still, and Hisashi strangely felt that he had poked some slumbering beast he should have avoided. Inko’s fingers dug into the scarred skin of Hisashi’s face, and he felt his heart race in anxiety. Oops, he thought to himself unhelpfully.

“He was what?” asked Inko sweetly.

Chapter Text

The intro hadn’t gone as smoothly as Tomura had intended. Which made no sense, because he’d dominated all the tutorial levels.

His Animal Crossing village? 5 stars, within the first week of (nearly non-stop) playing. His Stardew Valley achievements? Maxed out, every single stardrop. He’d played through romancing every romanceable NPC in Harvest Moon.

It went without saying that Tomura had managed several pro gamer moves.

This indisputable truth being said, it made no sense for his little brother to jump into the ceiling when Tomura lovingly laid a hand on his shoulder. As he watched the flailing, dumbstruck hero student stare at him, flabbergasted, Tomura wondered what he’d done wrong. He’d lifted his pinky out of habit, even worn the stupid gloves, so it wasn’t like it was dangerous.

He’d done nothing wrong! Ever, really. His Sensei had assured him early on that all of his actions were excusable due to his circumstances.

(What circumstances those were still wasn’t clear. Who cared. It couldn’t have been anything important, anyway—he had Sensei. What could go wrong in his life with his Sensei there?)

The popping sounds of the Explosion Brat snagged Tomura’s attention. Little brother’s little blond friend was here for dinner too, apparently. What was his name again? He’d memorized it when he’d planned on recruiting him…his little brother had called him—

“And Kacchan, right?” Tomura asked politely, smiling in a way that could only be charming.

The Kacchan brat shivered, quirk sparking loudly and teeth flashing in a snarl. Briefly, Tomura hoped that Sensei wouldn’t be distracted from his important reunion with Inko-san. The kid’s face had wrinkled up in anger at absolutely nothing, and Tomura instinctively braced his feet a bit firmer on the ground.

“The fuck? Don’t call me that, Hands Bastard!” he hissed, hands clenched and smoking. “Deku, get down from the fuckin’ ceiling! I’m not handling this asshole by myself.”

“That’s not very nice,” Tomura chided, kind smile stuck in place. “I heard my little brother call you that, and you’re friends. Friends call each other nice names, right?” He reached up to scratch harmlessly at his neck with glove-covered hands. “I’m just trying to be friendly. Not like I’d remember your name—we only met once, after all.”

“‘Met once’? That what you fuckin’ call kidnapping me, hahh?!”

“ Kacchan,” his little brother pleaded. See, Tomura shot a look at Not-Kacchan. The brat just continued gritting his teeth.

Tomura tsked, raising his hands in a ‘what-can-you-do’ gesture. “Geeze, kidnapping is such a strong word, huh?” he murmured, eyes trained on his little brother’s figure. Izuku was visibly concentrating, the weird-ass levitation he’d employed slowly dying as he sank carefully down to the floor. The Not-Kacchan didn’t take his poisonous glare off of Tomura, who continued providing his reasonable explanation once his little brother was safely on the ground. “You crash a single training camp, and give a recruitment pitch to one hero brat, and suddenly you’re a kidnapper?” He shook his head. “Cancel culture these days.”

His little brother had landed upright, but he looked like a strong gust of wind could knock him back off his feet and into the ceiling again. “Shigaraki,” he said.

“That’s me,” said Tomura. He shot his best winning smile at his little brother. “You should call me Tomura, though. Or Nii-chan. After all—” he put his hand right back where it belonged on his little brother’s shoulder “—we’re family, aren’t we?”

Izuku looked like he had more to say to that, but he was rudely interrupted by Not Kacchan. The brat had looked like a living fuse since Tomura had brought up the very real effects of cancel culture, wick inching closer to some inevitable explosion. You’d think he ran his mouth enough to let off some steam.

“That what you call it?” Not Kacchan demanded, rude yet again. He shoved a big stupid finger into Tomura’s chest; a tiny waft of smoke curled up from his shirt at the point of contact. “Crashing camp? Recruitment pitch? Did ya forget the fuckin’ restraints, bastard?”

“It’s not anything that they didn’t do to you at the Sports Festival ceremony, right?” Tomura asked, smile curling a teensy bit cruelley. “Why’s it so bad when I do it, but when heroes do it, it’s fine?”

“You fucker—”

“Kacchan, don’t—”

“See, Kacchan, see? Why does a hero-kid get to call you that and not me? Kind of hypocritical, huh?” Tomura could feel himself slipping back into old habits, habits he’d been doing his damndest to train himself out of over the past week through endless hours of weirdly-enjoyable, mind-numbing gameplay. “I tried adding you to my party. It didn’t work, but you gained some important EXP, right? That must’ve been a lot of personal growth stats you added.” He titled his head, mean smile still growing. “GG, right?”

The Not Kacchan’s quirk sparked and popped, going haywire, the brat’s expression absolutely furious and teeth gritted in a snarl. “Fuck off!” he hollered, fist flying toward Tomura. He braced himself, the thrill of successfully trolling some hero simp flying through his veins, but the fist stopped before the two could actually get into some good PVP.

Little brother was there, hand firm around the Explosion Brat’s forearm, pushing the arm away from Tomura’s fighting stance and off to the side. “Please, Kacchan,” he pleaded, eyes wide and worried. “All For One is at my front door! This isn’t the time and definitely not the place for a, a final showdown!” Izuku gestured at their surroundings, which were almost sickeningly wholesome: photographs of Inko-san and little brother, smiling and hugging, a framed acceptance letter to, gag, UA, a picture of Izuku with the girl he’d taken from the Shie Hassaikai, and a photo of Izuku with All Might, the fucking bastard, invading even little brother’s home—

“Are you boys doing okay?” Sensei asked, stepping up behind Tomura, gaze focused solely on his son. Sensei was relaxed, entirely unthreatening, but Izuku stared at him with wide, emotionless eyes. Was it ‘cause Sensei had taken his mask off? Little brother didn’t seem to be scared or horrified or anything; his face was painted with the same kind of flat acceptance Sensei often fell into when he was deeply unhappy with the circumstances.

Yeah, he could see the resemblance, at least a resemblance to back when Sensei had a face. He could also see the resemblance in the dawning anger, the tightening at the corner of Izuku’s eyes, trained sharp on Sensei, where his hand slackened around the Explosion Kid’s arm and was shaking with some suppressed feeling.

(There was a gurgling burp from the corner of the room, sticking out awkwardly in the tension. Well, that’s where Izuku’s donated Nomu went, at least. Though Tomura didn’t recall Sensei putting a yellow-red-and-blue bow on its head.)

“Izuku,” Inko-san said, looking very worried. She stood hesitantly in the physical center of the tension, stuck between her estranged husband and her son, hands wringing. Tomura didn’t see the big deal. Personally, he was happy to see this intense, not-so-heroic side of little brother. The family resemblance really shone through when he was quivering in anger, really switched him into a palette-swapped mini Sensei, unlike his normal normie persona. Yeah, now he looked more like Sensei and less like that bastard All M—

“I AM—” a deep, horrifically familiar voice called, slightly muffled behind a door that was immediately flung open by a pathetic blond skeleton. “—HERE, COMING OUT OF THE CLOSET!”

Inko shrieked, hand flying to her heart; the Explosion brat flung his hands toward the ground as they burst with surprised sparks; little brother got a look on his face that was a kind of mixture between confusion and exasperation; and Sensei…  

Well. Sensei’s pleasant facade had frozen in place. Now Tomura was feeling a little nervous.

“Erm. You said to come out when everyone was calmed down…?” the pathetic bastard prattled, eyes flicking between Izuku and Sensei. They settled resolutely on Izuku, whom the skeleton approached with a familial hand clapped to his shoulder. “Was my timing bad?” he whispered, not very quietly. “Did he say anything about the shirts?”

“Oh, Tomura has already seen the shirts,” Sensei said, in a voice as pleasantly fake as Tomura’s fragile patience. Sensei’s face was fixed, cold like little brother’s gaze had been, on All Might’s useless figure. His teeth were gritted in his fake-ass smile. “There were plenty of posts about your fashion statement on Twitter, after all. I can’t say I like the shirts,” Sensei continued, turning his focus onto his son, where his expression warmed immediately into an honest grin. “But I appreciate the maliciousness and cunning behind them. Izuku, son, you’ve certainly proven yourself at school. It’s so very good to see you.”

“You’re blind,” little brother said. “You can’t see me at all. Beyond a heat signature, right?” 

“Well, yes,” Sensei allowed, smile going a little frayed. “I mean to say—”

“If you’re going to say something about my personality being conveyed through my heat signature, don’t,” Izuku said, cutting off Sensei in a Super effective! battle move. “I’m not a mood ring. That’s pseudoscience at best, and mysticism at worst.” Little brother’s stare hadn’t left Sensei, as he finished quietly, “I would think that All For One would know better than to think he could win my favor by pandering to me.”

Damn, Tomura thought, staring in awe and horror at Izuku. Little brother really does take after Sensei.

Maybe we’re not too late to add him to the party after all.

Was Izuku’s heart racing, pounding against his chest, as he chewed out Japan’s most infamous villain-cum-deadbeat dad? Maybe.

But seeing All For One—all seven feet of him—in his and his mom’s damn living room, as broad as All Might in his prime and wearing another dark suit, was such a bizarre reality as to send Izuku into an almost out-of-body experience. He was disparaging All For One in a verbal smackdown, yes, but a good portion of himself was also a ghost, hovering right outside his unmoving figure, screaming silently and whacking his head on the wall.

All For One just continued smiling pleasantly at Izuku, but he could tell his raving had had an effect; his eye-less face was wrinkled in strain at tying to keep up his cheery farce, teeth flashing. Anyone with a sense of propriety would feel a tingle prodding at their self-preservation.

But Izuku… well. He had always been a little self-destructive. His fragile, latticed bones could attest to as much. A threat presented itself and he couldn’t help but poke at it.

Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Bakugou grimace and shove his hands in his pocket, hunching his shoulders uncomfortably. His poor mother wavered in the center of the living room, bottom lip tucked under her teeth. Shigaraki Tomura (he wasn’t going to call him Nii-chan; maybe Tomura, for the sake of efficiency, and if his biodad’s family name was Shigaraki, did that make Izuku, himself a Shigaraki?) remained unmoving in front of All For One. Toshinori’s hand on his shoulder had gone tight. And the bastard father himself… 

Well, it was tough to get a detailed read on someone that didn’t have a face.

Mephi-chan decided to remind their tense group that it was there and didn’t like being ignored. A screechy warble cut through the air, and Mephi-chan waddled over next to Izuku and shoved its head under Izuku’s hand, demanding attention. Izuku patted it on the head delicately, minding the bow, and All For One tracked the movement. The bastard’s expression shifted from fake-ass niceties to a genuine, satisfied grin.

“I see you’ve taken a liking to the Nomu I gifted you, Izuku.” The bastard finally moved, stepping closer toward Izuku to peer down at the Nomu. “I had hoped you would understand it as both a peace offering and a bit of security.”

Security, right. “You mean how it follows me everywhere and teleports back to me if I try to leave it behind?” he asked coolly. “Yes, I noticed, All For One.”

All For One scoffed lightly, waving a hand dismissively. “It would hardly be a good security measure it it didn’t keep good track of you!” he chided. “And please, call me dad.”

“No, thank you.”

There was a brief, painfully strained pause, where the bastard’s fake expression wavered and twitched. “Well, I can understand it may be difficult to adjust to having a father-figure back in your life: after all, substitutes —” the bastard’s head tilted pointedly in All Might’s direction “—they just don’t measure up. Literally.”

Then the bastard angled his head downward slightly, as thought emphasizing that Toshinori was a solid inch or two shorter than the villain. Which, really ! Izuku thought indignantly, All Might is well above average height! He’s 6’8”! It can’t be helped that my evil biodad is absurdly tall.

Two can play at the game of pettiness.

Goodness knows Toshinori wouldn’t be able to strategically, passive-aggressively defend himself as eloquently as Izuku could do on his behalf. All Might had always been a more direct sort of man. Thankfully, he had Izuku, pseudo-son successor extraordinaire, to be petty on his behalf—and a lifetime of Quirk-based discrimination made Izuku very good at playing this game.

“Well, there’s something to be said for measuring up,” Izuku agreed pleasantly, his own smile contorting with spite. “And something to be said for stepping up, too! After all, what kind of father-figure…” Izuku trailed off, eyes narrowing at All For One, though his face remained amiable. “...leaves for a decade?”

You could hear Mephi-chan’s drool dripping to the floor. Bakugou’s head was swiveling between Izuku and All For One, All Might’s own face the image of strained desperation. His poor mother could probably feel her life shortening with each word.

“My boy,” Toshinori tried to say, but Izuku wasn’t done yet.

“It’s just so interesting to me, that you’ve lived over two centuries, but you haven’t had time for your own kid!” Izuku chirped, as though he were sharing a fun, quirky fact. He gave sad, fake little laugh, shaking his head.

All For One’s fake-ass smile had finally dropped, as his place-where-his-eyes-would-be furrowed, scarred skin wrinkling further.

“...hm. Well. If you’re not up to ‘dad’ quite yet—understandable, of course, very reasonable—you should at least call me Hisashi.” Hisashi took a couple steps closer toward Izuku, long legs quickly closing the distance. Tomura shuffled after the man like a pathetic stray. Next to Izuku, Toshinori drew himself up with a huff, puffing out his frail, skeletal chest. A sweet gesture, but entirety unnecessary, Izuku thought.

Hisashi had made the situation very clear, had laid his cards out on the table for Izuku to analyze and dissect, all throughout a minutes-long conversation: the villain was determined to insert himself into Izuku’s life, dead-set on shoving himself into the father-shaped hole that had occupied their home since he left over ten years ago, for reasons Izuku couldn’t yet understand. It didn’t make sense, really; the man had just escaped from Tartarus, which—why now? Why wait to break out of prison, right when Izuku made the news for being falsely related to All Might? Unless… unless…

Despite it all, the Bastard of Kamino, the Dark King of the Underworld, the Unseen Ruler of Japan, was infected with that human condition: the yearning for a place to belong and for people to see you. The longing for a family.

If Izuku were a less kind boy, he would smear this vulnerability in his biodad’s eyeless face. Being the gentle hero-in-training he was, though, Izuku would take the high road.

The high road being this: he would exploit his pathetic, evil father for all his deeply-buried sentimentality and use his resources, distract the man for all his worth until Izuku could become the number one hero. He was patient. He could be patient, would have to be to grow strong enough to lock his biological father away for good.

(He just had to put up with his classmates nagging him about conspiracies for a couple more years. He could deal with it, he could, even if it made a certain dark pit in Izuku’s chest tingle and burn in rage, something inside him curling—he could ignore that.)

His mom wanted him to play nice, after all, and Izuku had spent a lifetime smiling at his tormentors. He could play nice, mostly. 

200-something years of investments and money laundering meant Hisashi’s pockets would be deep. Izuku had been hoping to move his mother into a bigger apartment once he graduated and got a position at a hero agency, but now he wouldn’t have to wait.

Using his father for his illegitimately-obtained wealth didn’t mean he had to play completely nice, though—he’d been feeling this urge , recently, to prod and jab at those that insisted on antagonizing him, purposeful or not. Primarily his classmates, but hey.

Who better to show his newly-discovered spite than his deadbeat biodad?

Things had gotten off to a bit of a rough start, Hisashi conceded.

He’d done plenty of research into his son before meeting up with him tonight. He’d watched the Sports Festival from his first year, read the (hacked) notes his UA teachers had written about how he behaved in class, had prodded Inko for dozens of stories describing Izuku’s meek but brave and cheery disposition.

The boy sitting across from him… well. His son had changed, Hisashi was sure about it.

Izuku certainly wasn’t as gentle and chipper as Inko had made him out to be, but maybe it was just the tense atmosphere. The mood smothering their little gathering reminded Hisashi of being rolled into Tartarus—forboding, oppressive. His son was opposite him at the table (as far away as possible, he noted sadly), which their group was awkwardly squished around in mismatching chairs.

Inko’s apartment was a modest thing, purposefully not attention grabbing, but Hisashi was really starting to regret its size. The five of them (Inko was bustling about in the kitchen) were smooshed into their chairs, sides pressing against each other. Only Hisashi was currently spared this claustrophobic indignity; for some reason, no one except Tomura seemed eager to get very close to him. To his right, the presently empty chair would obviously be filled by Inko. And next to Inko’s other side was…

Hisashi’s blood boiled. Yagi would be on Inko’s other side.

Only the two foot gap spared his enemy from annihilation, and the chair. Hisashi wouldn’t destroy one of Inko’s chairs.

The homewrecker of a man had the audacity to sit next to his son, whose other side was pressed into the Bakugou spawn. Said spawn was emitting a low, constant growl, like an angry motor, gaze shooting daggers at the boy touching his other side. The brat seemed torn between leaning as far away from Tomura as possible, not wanting to be in contact with Izuku, and not wanting to let Tomura out of his sight.

Under the table, snout pressed against Izuku’s foot, the Nomu made an occasional whuff ing sound. Hisashi could tell there was something on its head, something crinkly and poofy, but given that Izuku had put it there, he didn’t want to ask for details. Knowing his son’s sense of what he was reluctant to call fashion, it was probably All Might themed. There was something about the Nomu that Hisashi had questions about, however.

“Izuku,” he said, his voice visibly making his son startle in his seat. “I can’t help but notice that you’ve given your Nomu something…?”

“Oh,” Izuku said, tone still flat. “You mean the All Might bow on its head? It’s a limited edition.”

I fucking knew it. “Of course. No, I meant whatever it has in its mouth, actually.”

For some reason, this made Izuku still for a moment. Hisashi was suddenly hit with a bit of trepidation. He’d assumed that his son had given the thing some kind of dog’s toy, maybe a bone, based on the semi concerning cracking and crunching sounds it occasionally made. The way Izuku slowly leaned back into his chair, his head titled in consideration at Hisashi in a move that he couldn’t help but note was very similar to his own mannerisms, had Hisashi realising this may have been an incorrect assumption.

“It’s something I made myself,” Izuku said smoothly. He could hear the smirk in his son’s voice, which—given the Bakugou spawn’s inching away from Izuku and Yagi’s anxious, hovering hands—was a concerning sight.

The short, simplistic answer was so obviously bait, practically luring Hisashi asking him to elaborate further, but Hisashi was curious to a fault. Plus, he couldn’t help but be proud of his son for such an effective lead. “And what exactly is that something?” Hisashi asked, leaning back in his own seat, his own head tilting in eager anticipation, a mirror of his son across from him.

“Nothing too inventive,” Izuku drawled. “Just a modified figure. For the base, I took—well, I won’t bore you with the details. It’s chew toy, in the shape of a specific villain.” His son reached down to scratch at the Nomu’s scruff. “I’m thinking of expanding the range, really making it into an enterprise, you know? It’s already chewed through one of Stain, Muscular, an Overhaul with detachable limbs, and of course—” Izuku grabbed at the Nomu’s jaw, prying open its mouth to extract an obviously deformed, drool-coated figurine. “—my personal favorite, The All For Nomm.”

Tomura vocalized Hisashi’s own inner turmoil, letting out a choked, horrified noise. “Little brother,” he rasped, hand darting across the table to grab at Izuku’s wrist. “Put Sensei down. Don’t let it chew on Sensei.”

Izuku snatched his hand out of Tomura’s grip, stretching it above his head and holding Hisashi’s apparent effigy high like some terrible offering to the gods. “I won’t,” he snapped. “If Sensei is going to decide he suddenly wants to know his son, well, here I am!”

With that exclamation, Izuku waved the figure above his head proudly, a banner of spite and depravity.

Tomura growled, gloved hands clenching at Izuku’s exposed biceps. “Give me Sensei,” he hissed. “He’s all fucked up. I can fix him.”

“I can make him worse,” Izuku replied, then—using his ill-suited quirk, and completely defeating the purpose of it being a chew toy for animals—he gripped the Hisashi-shaped figurine’s arm between three fingers and pulverized the plastic limb to bits.

“No!” Tomura howled, throwing himself bodily onto the table, reaching desperately with both arms to claw at Izuku’s fist. “Sensei!”

“Don’t get so fucking close to me!” the Bakugou spawn yelled, shoving at Tomura. “Get off the fucking table!”

“Ah, boys, maybe you should—” Yagi started, and the whole situation had Hisashi wound up with stress and frustration that he couldn’t help but turn to Yagi and give his own irked contribution.

“Oh, so now the homewrecker is going to give my son a lesson on manners?” he sneered, fists clenching under the table. Yagi froze, his stupid smile turning to the battle scowl that Hisashi was much more familiar with.

“Homewrecker?” he asked in disbelief. His eyes were those blue points of heated rage, narrowed on Hisashi’s broader form. Yagi had to audacity to scoff. “To be a homewrecker, there would have to be a home to disrupt in the first place. I happen to know that my boy’s biological father was nowhere to be seen!”

Oh, okay. So it was going to be like this. Hisashi could feel his suited arm start to pulse, quirks stirring under his skin as rage bubbled up his throat. “Well, maybe if someone hadn’t been a damn thorn in my side specifically targeting all of my legitimate business practices —”

“—oh, legitimate? Please, they—”

“—the businesses I used to support my family,” Hisashi continued, voice a hissing, growling snarl. In the background, the shouting of the Bakugou spawn and the pleas of Tomura only magnified the chaos between himself and Yagi. Izuku was a silent, stalwart statue, holding his prize now well above the group’s head with an extended black tendril that definitely hadn’t been a part of One For All when Hisashi had last seen it, wait, when did Izuku get that quirk—

“What is going on here?!” Inko snapped.

Hisashi froze. So, too, did the rest of the room’s guilty occupants. He was very aware of where Tomura was desperately sprawled across the table, his shirt clutched in the smoking hands of the Bakugou spawn, Tomura’s hand grasping at Izuku’s high-held arm.

The gaggle of angry teenage boys rather remsebled a Renaissance painting. Inko, obviously, did not share this sentiment.

“Sit down,” she said sweetly, voice strained. “Dinner. Is ready. Tomura-kun,” she added, chipper, “please get off the table and take your seat! You, too, Katsuki.”

The boys removed themselves. Inko began setting out empty plates in front of every seat.

“Izuku, please put you toy away,” she added.

“It’s Sensei,” Tomura mumbled. Inko took this in stride.

“Izuku, please put Hisashi away.”

“Inko,” Hisashi tried, but Inko set his plate in front of him with a rather overly-loud clatter.

“I was talking about Little Hisashi,” she said, which was a horrifying sentence. Hisashi was, of course, dutifully quiet as Inko continued setting the table. The boys all stewed in patient silence.

Izuku shoved his twisted, malformed effigy of Hisashi back at the Nomu sitting under the table, which promptly bisected the toy with a loud crack. Hisashi tried not to feel like this was a omen of something to come.

Chapter Text

Hisashi couldn’t help but stay focused on his son’s figure, stewing angrily in his seat across from him.

His lovely wife was fussing about, trying to arrange the hotpot in the center of the table. Tomura seemed hypnotized by it, for some bizarre reason; the boy’s gaze was trained on the large, metallic pot, wide-eyed and a bit slack-jawed. His hands were frozen, gloved and harmless, in an uncomfortable-looking position over his own neck. Hisashi had absolutely zero idea what was so interesting about a damn hotpot—suppressed memories of his pathetic childhood, maybe? Despite his best efforts, even he wasn’t perfect at the art of brainwashing—but the boy seemed to be floating in a state of fascination.

Speaking of being fixated on things…

“So, young Bakugou,” he drawled, nodding his head toward the brat. Stiff and cross armed, the Bakugou boy had been glaring at Tomura since they’d sat down. He seemed torn between instinctively leaning away from Tomura and, teeth gritted, forcing himself to stand his ground. Amusing, certainly, but the fact that the boy had accompanied Izuku at all had Hisashi frowning in confusion. “What brings you to this... family get together?”

He leaned a bit into the word family, since, you know: the Bakugou’s were not related to him in any way, nor was the boy a brainwashed successor.

Thus the brat had absolutely zero reason to be here. Less reason than even Yagi, and Hisashi questioned the reasoning for Yagi’s very existence every day, so that was saying something.

Sharp eyes narrowed at him across the table. With his red eyes squinting like that, and with his pale blonde hair, Hisashi couldn’t help but be reminded of an angry white rat. “To keep the both of you in line, fucker,” Bakugou huffed.

Ah. Well, his attitude certainly hadn’t improved since he was a toddler. His vocabulary didn’t seem to have grown much, either. Hisashi forced a smile. “While I’m happy to see Izuku has such...dedicated friends,” he said, stretching the truth so thin that it could float on water, “I can’t help but recall that all of your school records indicate the two of you don’t seem to get along.”

The brat snarled, like a damned dog. Hisashi must have hit a nerve. “Mind your own business! How would you even get any of that shit, hahh?”

“We invited Kacchan,” Izuku stated, deadpan. His hands were gripped tight around a pair steel chopsticks, which creaked dangerously. “Mom and I. He’s a good friend.”

“You know that he and Izuku have always gotten along, dear,” Inko chimed in. Well, Hisashi thought bitterly, goes to show how much Izuku had told Inko about Bakugou’s prior bullying. Inko continued, not missing a beat, “Izuku, honey, please don’t break another pair of the nice chopsticks.”

Izuku’s grip lightening immediately, the concerning metallic groaning coming to a halt. “Sorry, mom,” he mumbled.

Hisashi was not convinced. A rotten boy does not change their tune over the course of a few years—just look at Hisashi himself! He had been a malevolent child, a malevolent young adult, and now, in his 200’s, he was a malevolent immortal.

A bastard from birth, a bastard to the grave, in his (not) humble opinion.

He hummed in consideration, head tilting and hand rising to tap at his lip in thought. “A good friend, hm? This is a surprise to me, you see. Then again, far be it from me to claim to understand the ways of teenagers: perhaps aggressively targeting your friends is normal at your age...”

Maybe he was poking the bear, so to speak, but he couldn’t resist. The brat just looked so enrage-able, it reminded Hisashi of Yagi’s hatred after he had first disposed of the Shimura’s. As a villain, he couldn’t help but see a sore spot and feel that urge to keep prodding until it snapped.

Snapping was imminent, he could tell. The Bakugou brat seething in his seat, steam visibly rising from his fists. At least the boy was self-aware enough not to protest that he’d always been kind to Izuku, though he hardy admitted as much out loud. Instead, his son’s friend changed the topic with all the delicacy of his explosive quirk. “So we’re just gonna pretend this is normal?” he bit out, smoking hands jabbing toward Hisashi. “Some villain bastard just waltzing into Auntie’s kitchen and trying to fuckin’ woo Deku to the darkside?”

“This isn’t Star Wars, boy,” Hisashi bit out, holding back a defensive snarl. 

(“Don’t mention that,” Izuku mumbled under his breath. “Star Wars isn’t real and it can’t hurt you.” 

He’d flinched at the series title like Pavlov’s dogs to a bell, which was concerning, but not an immediate priority. They could address Star Wars’ triggering affect on Izuku’s stability later.)

Hisashi forced himself to sound at least vaguely amiable. This was a teenager, he reminded himself. A real piece of shit teenager, yes, but his son’s apparent friend. A bad influence, he thought privately. “The world isn’t so black and white,” he continued calmly, like an adult. “Villains and heroes—I’ve always hated such a strict dichotomy of a system. The world is hardly so black and white. Not to mention how political the whole system has always been.”

“Oh, here we go,” Yagi muttered angrily. His nemesis was angrily folding a napkin into various, intricate shapes.

“What was that, All Might?” Hisashi prodded, smile straining across his face. “I could have sworn you were trying to say something, but maybe I misheard the Nomu. You both tend to speak in intelligible grunts, after all.”

“Its name is Mephi-chan,” Izuku grumbled. His arms were crossed, just like Bakugou’s. The two slumped next to each other looked like the picture of teenage angst. “You’d know that if you were around at all,” Izuku added, throwing Hisashi a petulant glare.

Ouch. “I see,” Hisashi allowed, pleasant facade wobbling. “My apologies to Mephi-chan. I’m assuming it’s short for something?”

“Yep.”

Izuku popped the ‘P’ at the end of the word, and Inko audibly took a deep, calming breath. Hisashi couldn't understand why; this was a perfectly normal and reasonable conversation.

So, he wouldn’t be given any hints. No matter—there were only so many words that began with such a distinctive sound, and given that his son was bitter about his gifted Nomu (for reasons beyond him), it was probably a name with negative connotations. Izuku was well-read, for a teenage boy, so it was likely between only a couple options….

“You’re mumbling again, Sensei,” Tomura grunted, finally pulling his attention from the damned hotpot. Inko had completed setting up said hotpot, though the pinched skin at the edge of her eyes betrayed the fact that she was absolutely following their conversations, and she was less than delighted about them.

“Ugh, two mumblers,” the Bakugu spawn grunted, elbowing his son. Izuku stared determinedly at the table and huffed.

“Mumbling betrays a busy mind,” Hisashi argued, refusing to be self conscious. Especially if, as the Bakugou brat implied, it was a habit he shared with his son. “Those with quiet, simpler minds wouldn’t understand.”

“The fuck, you calling me stupid?”

“I said no such thing, young Bakugou,” Hisashi said, faux offended. After all, he’d only implied it. “Back to the topic at hand, the name… is it short for mephitis, or Mephistopheles?”

That educated guess (highly educated: he had four PhD’s to his name. One of his names, that is) had his son raising his head sharply, staring at Hisashi in shock. Even his terrible blonde friend next to him seemed taken aback. “How,” Izuku started, a hand wringing near his face anxiously. “Out of all the words. What would have given it away…?”

“There are only so many words in the common lexicon that begin with the sound mephi, most linking back to Latin. From Latin, it traveled to Germanic texts, although the root of the word wasn’t popularized until the early 19th century, courtesy of Goethe. And given your distaste for my gift…” Hisashi trailed off with a shrug, although internally he couldn’t help but feel incredibly smug. His son was blinking at Hisashi like he was seeing him properly for the first time. To his side, All Might was looking between the two with a furrowed, confused face. Tomura was squinting at Izuku in appraisal.

There was a bit of an awkward silence, broken by the grating voice of the Bakugou brat. “Again,” he growled, “we’re just acting like this is normal?” He shoved at his son’s shoulder, shaking Izuku out of the considering stare he’d been sending to Hisashi. “You don’t get to have a fuckin’ moment with All For One, idiot, snap out of it! Just ‘cause you both mumble and read a bunch of nerdy shit doesn’t make him less of a damn villain.”

Izuku flushed, muttering quiet protests at the table, and Hisashi gave a patronizing sigh. He shook his head, raising his hands in a bit of a theatrical gesture that he’d never been able to shake. As a natural-born villain, he’d always had a flair for the dramatics.

“Oh, young Bakugou,” he sighed. “There are all sorts of families in this world. Just because our family is a little unusual doesn't make it any less legitimate. There’s much to be said for diversity!”

“What, the ‘diversity’ of Deku’s deadbeat dad being a fuckin’ villain?” Bakugou snarked, with a stupid, sneering look on his face that Hisashi just itched to destroy.

But Hisashi was patient, and had put up with much more than a bratty teenager. He smiled placidly. “And the diversity of the skeletal remains of All Might himself as the temporary stand-in!” he added cheerily. Across the table, Yagi gave a short, offended growl that Hisashi daintily ignored. “I think it balances itself out. A former, powerless hero as an interim guardian, and a strong, intelligent, loving father who happens to prefer to work within...less legitimate business regulations.”

“Is that what they’re calling murder and exploitation these day?” Yagi growled. Shadowed eyes narrowed on Hisashi in silent rage. “Business? Is that all it is to you?”

(“Just start getting food, boys,” Inko murmured to the teenagers, who were wide-eyed at the two men beginning a verbal smackdown at the dinner table. She patted Izuku on the shoulder and smiled encouragingly at Tomura when he hesitantly reached to serve himself from the hotpot. “Just let them get their energy out! Go on. Eat, eat.”)

“I have a very diverse portfolio of passive income, as you would know,” Hisashi snapped back. “Seeing as you and your former sidekick worked so hard to dismantle them.”

“A ‘diverse portfolio’,” Yagi snorted, shaking his head. Next to him, Izuku didn’t spare either of the adults a glance, focus entirely on the food. Hisashi couldn’t let his son down by not responding, though, couldn’t risk looking like he was less astute than his worthless competition, and thus he had no choice but to continue responding to his nemesis’ disparaging quips.

(“Why do adults always have to talk about politics at the dinner table,” Izuku grumbled, helping Bakugou and Tomura serve themselves from the hotpot. He pulled out his mother’s chair, who thanked him with a bright, tense smile.)

“Certainly,” Hisashi said, calmly, firmly. “What else would you call a 9% hold of the Japanese GDP, or my place as one of the consistently-ranked top investors in the Tokyo stock exchange, or my vast portfolio of bitcoin—”

“Bitcoin,” Yagi scoffed, shaking his head. He turned to Izuku (who wasn’t looking at him), gesturing at Hisashi with a casual, dismissive wave. “My boy, despite what this man says, remember that he’s made his place in the underworld by stepping over others’ corpses.”

(“It’s always, ‘Let’s get together as a family!’” Izuku mimicked, to which Bakugou snorted and Tomura choked a laugh, pale red eyes widening in delight. “Then two sakes later they’re arguing about why they hate the local politicians they voted for.”)

“Oh, like polite society doesn’t exploit others,” Hisashi snorted. He pointed at Izuku, who was still determinedly not looking at either of them. “Don’t be fooled by Yagi’s superiority complex, my boy: there is no ethical consumption under global capitalism. I’m hardly the only one with blood on my hands.”

“My boy,” Yagi interjected, angry and stubborn. “Don’t forget that the blood on most peoples’ hands is not literal— ”

(“Y’know, even Sensei and the Doctor and Kurogiri would start arguing about that kind of stuff as soon as they sat down together,” Tomura mumbled, stirring his noodles hypnotically.

“It’s weird,” Izuku agreed. “Adults love to talk about things they hate talking about. Oh, Tomura, would you pass the bonito?”)

“You dismember a couple of corpses and suddenly you’re a villain,” Hisashi bit out, waving his hands in a lofty, disdainful flourish. “Are one or two murders really so much crueler than property management? Particularly in the midst of a housing crisis—!”

“Yes, yes it is!” Yagi yelled, fist hitting the table with a clatter. Inko took deep, calming breaths as she silently urged the teenagers at the table to ignore the commotion around the table. Hisashi and Yagi continued on in their own private battle, bowls remaining empty.

“What a quaint way of viewing morality,” Hisashi sneered.

(Izuku slurped loudly at his noodles. The Bakugou spawn poured a concerning amount of ichimi togarashi over his plate, the sight of which made Tomura begin adding the same spice with a competitive glower.)

“It’s the correct way of viewing morality,” Yagi replied, fists on the table. Impolite.

(Now Tomura and Bakugou were glaring at each other, letting spice compile dangerously upon their bowls of hotpot. Izuku seemed completely unaware of Hisashi and Yagi’s Very Important conversation, eyes widening at the sight of Tomura’s and Bakugou’s combative flavoring. Inko continued eating politely, quietly, eyeing the boys’ silent competition with increasing concern.)

“You’ve grown blind to the nuance in this world,” Hisashi argued. “Heroics makes such blindness necessary, to stay ignorant to any real nuance.”

“You’ve been blind to any mercy and generosity for as long as you’ve been a thorn in society’s side,” Yagi said bitterly, pointing chopsticks in Hisashi’s face like a knife. “Metaphorically and now literally, you are utterly blind.”

“So now you’re mocking me for my disability,” Hisashi hissed, holding half of his chopsticks in each hand, each pointing in Yagi’s direction like accusing fingers. “The disability you caused!”

(Tomura and Bakugou each picked up their own chopsticks, large piles of noodles held up in front of their faces. Gazes narrowed on each other, they opened their mouths and shoved the noodles in. Izuku had given up on eating entirely to gawk at the two. Inko looked like she had simply given up entirely.)

“I wouldn’t have needed to smash your face in if you weren’t hellbent on annihilating every hero off the face of Japan,” Yagi said, voice raising. “I’ll mock you for all you deserve, you’re a murderer—”

“I may be a serial killer by definition,” Hisashi replied, “but I draw the line at ableism.”

This very important and valid point was promptly interrupted by the grotesque sounds of Tomura hacking and coughing, mouth open and spilling food like a dog. 

“Hah!” crowed Bakugou, fist slamming on the table in victory. “This ain’t even that spicy!”

This statement was disputed by the tears gathering in the brat’s eyes, and the painful grimace he attempted to cover with a smirk. Izuku stared at the boy in amazement, like making yourself suffer was some sort of accomplishment. Inko rushed to shove napkins into Tomura’s lap.

“Here, Tomura-kun, here,” she murmured, fretting. “Why would you make it so spicy, sweetheart?  This isn’t a competition.”

“Everything is a competition,” Bakugou rasped, mouth huffing cooling breaths. “And I- I won! I always win, obviously!”

“Amazing,” Izuku muttered. It was not amazing.

“Fuhh- Fuck you,” Tomura choked. He wiped his mouth roughly with a napkin and proceeded to chug a glass of water like a dying man.

“Watch your fuckin’ language at Auntie’s table, bitch,” Bakugou snapped.

“Boys!” Inko interrupted, face twisting into a frown. “Let’s calm down, okay? And don’t make a competition out of eating, it’s so wasteful.”

“Sorry, Auntie,” Bakugou grunted.

“Sorry, Inko-san,” Tomura muttered.

“Were any of you even listening to this?” Hisashi asked, indignant. “Izuku, my boy, you should have heard the pedantic, egotistical arguments Yagi was trying to put forth. Let alone the disgusting ableism he levied at me, a man with visual disabilities!”

“No, what he should have heard were your excuses for being a horrible person,” Yagi argued. He reached out and put a hand on Izuku’s shoulder, dragging his son’s attention away from his actual father. “My boy,” Yagi continued, so damn self-assured of his own morality, “you know that this man twists his words to twist the truth. He is a pathological narcissist.”

“Yet further ableism,” Hisashi snarled. “Just because I don’t have the same level of empathy for others doesn’t make me a bad person. It’s just how my brain works.”

“Well, the murders certainly make you a bad person!”

“Izuku, my boy,” Hisashi said, voice urgent. Izuku twisted his head, eyes wide, to stare at Hisashi in overwhelmed confusion. “You are my son at heart. And you’re such an intelligent young man. Surely you can see what I actually mean when I discuss the intricacies of morality and the flaws of hero society?”

“My boy,” Yagi bit out, hand tugging Izuku’s shoulder and attention back to himself. “Don’t listen to a damn thing that man says. He—”

“My boy,” Hisashi snarled, “Yagi is just a hypocritical—”

“My boy, All For One has always been—”

“Stop!” Izuku gasped, hands rising to clap over his ears. He shook Yagi’s hand off his shoulder, finally, but then he stood up and stomped his foot. “First I’m his boy—” he pointed at Yagi “—then I’m your boy—” his finger jabbed in Hisashi’s direction “—at some point even the police chief in Hosu called me my boy.”

He threw his hands up and then gripped his hair in despair. “I can only be so many people’s boy!” he cried.

Yagi looked down at his lap in shame. Hisashi didn’t experience that particular emotion. “There is no such restriction,” Hisashi said stubbornly. “You can be an unlimited amount of boys.”

“I can’t!” Izuku shouted.

“Gender is a social construct in the first place. Why not declare yourself a multitude of boys?” Hisashi argued, maybe just a bit petulantly. “When I made that Nomu, for example, I used the bodies and quirks of at least four men and one woman. Mephi-chan would have an aggregated gender. Allow yourself the same freedom.”

“I’m one boy, and I’m tired of people gendering my Nomu!”

“Not gonna address the part about the bodies?” the Bakugou brat interrupted.

“That misses the point entirely,” Hisashi said dismissively. He would have continued his very good speech, but was rudely cut short by Yagi yet again.

“I would argue the bodies are the entire point,” the idiot said.

“You would,” Hisashi snarked back.

“Okay!” Inko said. Her face was turning dangerously purple, a look that Hisashi knew as her ‘I am going to pull you down a flight of stairs’ look—charmingly threatening, but only when it wasn’t directed at him. “Let’s all go ahead and eat, alright?” For a moment, Yagi looked like he was going to argue, but a truly concerning, blank stare from Inko had the man withering back into his seat.

“There we go,” Inko sighed happily. “Izuku, sit back down, darling.”

Izuku fell back into his chair with a huff, picking his chopsticks back up and stirring at his bowl. Tomura, reaching slowly around Bakugou, patted him carefully on the back. Izuku huffed. Bakugou bristled like a cat.

“Don’t put your arm on me,” he hissed.

“I was trying to console my little brother,” Tomura sneered.

“That’s very sweet of you, Tomura-kun,” Inko said. She’d regained her normal, maternal calm, and she gave Tomura a sweet smile. “You know, Hisashi and Toshinori could both learn a thing from you!”

“They could?” Tomura asked. He stared at Inko like she’d announced Half-Life 3. “Sensei could?”

“He sure could,” Inko repeated, taking a two-by-four to Hisashi’s pride. “Putting your loved ones first is the most important part of acting like family, after all.”

“Right,” Tomura muttered, tearing his gaze from Inko and staring at Izuku with that same enraptured look. “I’m gonna put you first, little brother,” he said definitively.

“....er. Okay,” said Izuku. He fidgeted a bit, painfully awkward under Tomura’s concerningly-intense attention.

“I’m gonna put you so far ahead of me you’ll never even see me coming,” Tomura continued.

“Oh gods please don’t do that.”

At least one of them was making a good impression, Hisashi assuaged himself, finally swallowing his stubbornness and serving himself a plate. Tomura really was a natural at this whole big brother thing.

Why, next thing he knew, Tomura would probably be almost as good at it as Hisashi himself.

    lots of Tomura in this chapter, since they animated his fun family story in the last episode! he got to pet a dog and everything! :)

Chapter Text

Izuku finished eating quickly, and immediately volunteered to start doing the dishes.

And perhaps his enthusiasm for mundane chores was a bit too vigorous. Perhaps his sudden jump to his feet jolted the table, shaking glasses and plates in his haste to get away from two of the table’s occupants.

Perhaps shaking the table unsettled Tomura’s elbow, and perhaps Tomura was choking and wheezing on a mouthful of noodles. He’d be fine, probably; Bakugou was right next to him, and as much as Bakugou obviously enjoyed settling back in his chair and watching Tomura suffocate a bit, he would more than likely Heimlich the shit out of Tomura before he actually died.

(The chances were higher than 80%, at least, and that was good enough for Izuku’s current state of mind.

And the Heimlich wasn’t exactly a peaceful act. Yep, there he went—true to form, Bakugou had gripped and slammed Tomura’s lower abdomen with a violent gusto. Frankly, it looked more like Bakugou was trying to hug him in half. 

Tomura hacked up his half-chewed mouthful like a dog forced to spit out a gnarled chunk of plastic.)

“Are you sure you want to do the dishes?” Inko asked, a furrow in her brow. “You don’t have to, Izuku! Don’t you want to spend more time with Toshi and your dad?”

Izuku looked over to where Yagi and Hisashi were engaged in a silent, cold stare-off, each determined to outlast the other’s pettiness. His bastard-father seemed entirely unaware of his successor gasping in desperate breaths just an arms reach away. 

The only real discussion throughout the night’s dinner had been when Inko would prompt Izuku and Bakugou to tell her about all the interesting things they were learning in school. Izuku had started describing a recent training exercise their class had participated in when, furiously, Bakugou had hissed at Tomura to ‘cover his crusty fucking ears.’ In defiance, Tomura had listened in with unmatched focus. Izuku felt like a bug pinned to a board.

Even if it was out of spite, Tomura’s wholehearted attention was a little unsettling. Like holding the challenging stare of an angry incel.

Both of the adult men at the table had just watched Izuku silently. Maybe they thought they were being encouraging, giving him so much silent attention, but Izuku was just left…disturbed.

The only time Hisashi and Toshinori had spoken was to argue, and only with each other.

So when his mom asked him—innocently, genuinely—if he wanted to spend more time with his dad and his bastard progenitor, all he could manage was to reply:

“No thanks,” Izuku answered his mom. “I think I’ve had my fill of dads.”

At the word ‘dad’, both Toshinori and Hisashi perked up, attention honing in on where Izuku had started collecting dishes and utensils from the table. Izuku purposefully didn’t look at either of them. He gathered up tableware gingerly, with the tips of his outstretched fingers, keeping as much distance from their negative vibes as possible.

“Well, if you want to,” his mom acquiesced. She smiled up at him. “You’re such a sweet boy, Izuku.”

Izuku elected not to say that the primary reason he wanted to do the dishes was to get away from the silent paternity battle not two feet from where he’d been sitting.

“That’s me,” he agreed, forcing a smile. “A sweet boy.”

Abruptly, Tomura stood, his chair clattering dangerously. “I’ll help little brother,” he declared. His voice was only a little scratchier than normal from his prior suffocation. He strode over to where Izuku had started shoveling up the utensils and proceeded to snag two handfuls of dishes from him with a gusto. “I’ll help,” he hissed. The small pile he had ripped out of Izuku’s grip clattered dangerously.

“You, uh, you really don’t need to!” Izuku stuttered, holding his own armful of dishes up as a sort of shield.

“I have to,” Tomura intoned, tone serious. “I told you, brat. I’m gonna be the best big brother. Family is supposed to be inescapable.”

“Who taught you that? Not Animal Crossing.”

“No, Sensei told me that one,” Tomura said. “But the ‘helping’ I got from Animal Crossing. I combined them, to make a support/tank build.” He smiled, which was just as unsettling as it was earlier in the evening. “I’ll buff your skills, but it’s an AoE casting that you can’t hide from, got it?”

“Not really,” Izuku admitted, squinting and turning toward the kitchen. “I’ve never heard someone say those words out loud before.”

“Yeah, well, real gamers don’t get outside a lot.”

Bakugou jumped out of his chair with an even louder rattle. “The fuck, Deku,” he hissed. His eyes darted toward where Hisashi and Toshinori were matching each other’s gazes with prejudice. “Don’t just ditch me here with your fuckin’ theatre troupe of dads!”

Said troupe of dads turned their collective stares onto Bakugou, and Bakugou moved quickly into Izuku’s space away from the table.

“It’s just two,” Izuku huffed, because ‘troupe’ implied that his life had gotten so out of control that he had dads crawling out of cracks in the wall. He rifled through his stack of dishes and handed a single chopstick toward Bakugou in offering. “Here, you can, uh. Help too.”

Face a grimace, Bakugou took the chopstick. He held it between two cupped hands, like one would hold a delicate baby bird. “The fuck,” he grunted. “That’s it? Are you looking down on me or something?”

So, they were going to do this now. Izuku’s patience and sanity were held up by a damp tissue, at this point, and Bakugou wanted to argue.

“Oh gods, I just want to do the dishes and be done with this night, okay?” he hissed. For a moment, his glare on Bakugou seemed to press the boy down. It was an intangible, heavy pressure, the same one Bakugou had felt leaking off of Izuku back in the dorms when their classmates were being especially stupid.

He shuddered. Next to him, Tomura shifted awkwardly on his feet.

“Take the chopstick,” Izuku said.

“Fuckin’ whatever,” Bakugou croaked, shoving past the others like he wasn’t freaked the fuck out by his childhood friend. He held his single, sad chopstick in a firm grip, held aloft like a guiding torch.

Izuku took a deep, calming breath. When he opened his eyes from his small moment of forced peace, he found Tomura eyeing him, one of his gloved hands scratching at his neck.

“What?” Izuku huffed, turning and following Bakugou to the sink. His friend had already started running the water, filling up the sink, and Izuku squeezed in next to him. Bakugou tossed his chopstick into the water with a sad plop.

Izuku admired the singular chopstick as a sign of victory. A small victory, true, but any victory tonight was a miracle.

“You’re a huge hero simp nerd,” Tomura said suddenly. “A normie.”

“Is that supposed to be an insult?” Izuku asked, entirely genuine. Again, he had never actually heard those words said out loud before. Izuku began the mundane process of washing up.

“Kinda,” Tomura continued, as he inserted himself roughly into the too-small space at the sink. He didn’t even move to put his hands in the water, choosing instead to just occupy space inconveniently. “But despite all your flaws, you have your moments where you’re just like Sensei.”

Izuku gaped at him, and not just because Tomura and Bakugou were currently indiscreetly shoving at each other, hip-to-hip, to jab into the space next to Izuku. “No I’m not,” he said finally. He scrubbed a bowl with prejudice, and maybe a teensy bit of his quirk.

“Only sometimes , I said,” Tomura grunted, having been elbowed in the gut by Bakugou.

“That’s not any better,” Izuku argued. “I’m nothing like All For One. I’m a good person! I haven’t even killed anyone yet.” 

“Yet?” Bakugou asked.

“I can’t predict the future,” Izuku replied dismissively—what, it wasn’t like he some moral absolutist. All For One was a centuries-old cryptid that All Might himself had been unable to cow into defeat, and apparently Tartarus was made out of plywood, and UA’s security system was equivalent to Life Alert—so he was well aware that he was probably going to have to kill All For One to really defeat him.

But that was the morally-ambiguous future, hardly something he needed to worry about in his morally-bound present.

Strangely, Bakugou didn’t seem to find this answer satisfactory. He was angling his body unsubtly away from Izuku, and he’d shoved his hands deep into his pockets, a sign Izuku knew meant he was uncomfortable. At this point, it was just Izuku washing dishes, he thought grumpily. He didn’t even say anything weird!

“Sensei isn’t a bad person, either,” Tomura argued. Izuku narrowed his eyes in visible doubt, and also pointed at the towels, because someone around here was going to help with chores. Tomura grumbled but acquiesced, saying, “He has morals too. He took me in off the street.”

“He did that to manipulate you,” Izuku grumbled, rinsing dishes aggressively. Thankfully, Tomura had started wiping plates dry with a towel, setting them very delicately in the drying rack. At least he was being careful. “It’s called grooming.”

Tomura grunted. “What, like you weren’t manipulated by the media? By society? ” Huffing, he dried at spots on the plates with a heavy hand. “You live in a society. You’re ‘manipulated’ by society.”

“Grooming,” Izuku muttered.

“What, like skin care? I taught myself.”

Well, where does Izuku start, with an answer like that.

That claim was apparently unbelievable enough for Bakugou to put aside his uneasiness. “Bullshit,” he said, glaring at Tomura from where he’d perched himself on top of a countertop. “With shitty skin like yours, you haven’t groomed fuck all. You wouldn’t know moisturizer if I was drowning you in it.”

Hands visibly clenching (thank gods he still had those stupid gloves on), Tomura put down one of the last dried dishes with an angry thunk. “I moisturize,” he hissed at Bakugou, one hand reaching up to his throat, which really only emphasized how not-moisturized his cracking skin truly was. “Every day. Not like your chad ass would understand. Bet a spoiled brat like you doesn’t have to do shit to conform. Bet you were just the most popular piece of shit growing up, huh?”

“He’s not wrong,” Izuku muttered. He drained the sink, the rushing water background noise to Bakugou’s betrayed scoff.

“I’m not gonna bother addressing that last shit,” he grunted, eyes narrowed, “‘cause I don’t even know what a ‘chad’ is. But there is no fucking way you moisturize every day.”

“I do!” Tomura waved at his face and his neck with his gloved hand, marching up into Bakugou’s personal space.

“With what?” Bakugou snapped back. “Sand?”

Tomura rolled his eyes. “With water, obviously,” he said. “ Moisture is water. ” He said it like it was the plainest thing in the world, and hey, Izuku wasn’t the best at personal care himself—it took him years to realize he was using the entirely wrong shampoo for curly hair—but even he cringed at that answer. He grew up with Auntie Mistuki, after all, who shoved excess brand-name skincare and fashion giftbags at his mom with semiregularity.

For his part, Bakugou looked like Tomura had told him he’d been drinking out of a toilet. “Water,” he repeated, sounding utterly dead inside, “is drying. You dumb bitch, you use water to wash your fucking face! With a fucking cleanser. No wonder you look like you’ve been exfoliating with a damn brick.”

“What’s exfoliating?”

Perhaps for the first time in his life, Bakugou was forced to experience pity. “Fucking hell,” he sighed, dragging a hand down his (perfect, clearskined) face. “If you’re planning on hanging around Deku, or even coming near me in the future, you’re not gonna do it looking like that. ” He pointed accusingly at Tomura’s whole body with a grimace, which was true, but a little harsh.

Tomura stared at Bakugou with confusion and a bit of trepidation. “I can’t help how I look,” he grunted, and Izuku noticed his face had gotten a little pink out of embarrassment. With color on his cheeks, he looked slightly less like the face of death itself.

“Bullshit,” Bakugou said. “I hate looking at you. Put in the barest bit of fucking effort, and you could at least prevent flaking away in the fucking wind. Also, your hair is greasy and stringy as shit. I hate looking at that, too.”

“I use—”

“Let me fucking guess: water?”

Tomura’s silence was damning. Izuku gave in to his meddling, heroic impulses and patted him on the shoulder consolingly.

“Maybe we could cut it?” he suggested, smiling consolingly. “And style it? And show you how to, uh, take care of it?”

Tomura stared at Izuku like he’d suggested going out in full drag. “Cutting it?” he croaked, touching his own (clumpy, lifeless) hair with curious fingers. The look he moved between the other two boys was the closest to vulnerable that Izuku had ever seen him. “Wh… Who would do that? I can’t go out without a disguise,” he said.

To Izuku’s surprise, he sounded almost disappointed. Huh. Was he actually considering it? Could he and Bakugou actually make some kind of change to Tomura?

At first, when his bio-dad had dragged Shigaraki fucking Tomura along with him for the performance art that was the night’s dinner, Izuku had assumed the older boy was a part of the show. Look at me! he had assumed Tomura’s presence meant. I tamed a previously feral boy, and he only sustained a major amount of emotional trauma! but hey, now he comes with table manners!

A part of him had expected Tomura to pull a rabbit out of his sleeve and start juggling. All a part of the ancient bastard’s performance, not anything that Izuku was going to fall for, but that would at least please his mom.

But whatever Tomura had been up to, he was...different. Amenable.

Impressionable.

It was a good thing Izuku was so heroic. Otherwise, he might be tempted to overhaul his former-enemy turned not-brother into an entirely different, better person. But he was a good person, and… hm.

Briefly, Izuku entertained the image of a smiling, giggling, sociable Tomura. One with decent skin, and that didn’t draw proteins and caloric nutrients from the sad blue glow of a computer screen.

A shiver ran down his back. He shook his head roughly, dispelling the cursed image. No, he wasn’t like All For One. He had no interest in completely overwriting someone’s personality.

(Frankly, subjecting society to more Tomura than absolutely necessary was a villainous idea in and of itself. Best most of his socializing occur in a controlled environment.

If Tomra, miraculously, wanted to put himself out there and make friends, well, that’s what Discord was for. The socially-inept Gamer population had to be controlled, and the Real World had way too many predacious species.)

But if the Bastard of Kamino thought he was being slick, showing off a slightly more tolerable Tomura like a prized, three-legged dog, he had another thing coming. All For One wasn’t the only one that could make allies and influence people.

“Y’know, Tomura,” Izuku said pleasantly, smiling gently at Tomura. “Kacchan is pretty good at cutting hair! I bet he and I could help clean you up.”

If his sudden attitude change was off putting to Tomura, he didn’t show it. If anything, Izuku’s recent, violent mood changes seemed to be a familiar pattern to him, which was a thought Izuku didn’t want to examine closely.

Bakugou, however. Well. Izuku’s dear childhood friend’s face screwed up in disgusted resignation. His wide, red eyes gazed pleadingly into Izuku’s own. Izuku knew him well enough to communication without words.

Really, Deku? his furiously hopeless stare said to him. You’re gonna make me fuckin’ Queer Eye this villain bastard?

Yep, Izuku said silently back, smile plastered onto his face, twitching a bit in the corners. He pressed on that weird pressure that had been coming so naturally, recently. You owe me, if you really want to be my friend, Kacchan.

Guilt tripping, hah? the increasingly narrowed gaze seemed to say, Bakugou’s teeth gritting. I can’t believe you’re stooping that fucking low.

I’m right and you know it, Izuku replied with a tilt of his head, hands shrugging slightly at his side. Besides, this is going to be for the greater good, anyway. Trust me.

“Uhh,” Tomura grunted, shifting uncomfortably. Izuku jolted a bit—hell, he’d almost forgotten he was there. With a confused grimace, Tomura continued nervously tugging at his greasy clumps of hair. “Why the fuck are you two just staring at each other? And, uh. Gesturing.” 

With the hand not fiddling with his hair, Tomura pointed between Izuku and Bakugou. “Are you two flirting or something?”

It was said so innocently, and yet. Izuku muffled a noise of despair into his big, dumb Mighty Family t-shirt.

“Fuck no!” Bakugou shouted, jumping down from the counter (finally, Izuku thought) to stomp over in front of Tomura. He jabbed a finger into Tomura’s chest, baring his teeth. “That’s called fucking non-verbal communcation, you hermit fucker. We were fuckin’ talking. Friends do it all the damn time.”

(“He called me his friend again,” Izuku mumbled into the fabric of his t-shirt. “Wow. Twice in two months. I need to mark this on my Kacchan Calendar.”)

“Huh,” Tomura replied, going a bit cross-eyed as he peered down at the finger burning a small hole in his shirt. “So you’ve built up enough closeness points that you can p2p chat without a quirk.”

“I still don’t know what the fuck that means,” Bakugou sneered. “It’s a social skill, you hikikomori dweeb.” He poked the smoking finger again, aggressively, into Tomura’s chest. “And if we’re gonna be making you look presentable, we might as fuckin’ well make you act like less of a disaster, too.”

“Kacchan,” Izuku said, voice only a little warbly, with a genuine smile. “Thank you! Tomura,” he continued, spinning Tomura away from Bakugou’s accusing finger and clapping both of his hands down onto Tomura’s shoulder. Izuku gazed up at Tomura unblinkingly.

“Kacchan and I are going to make you into a fantastic big brother.”

Like a centipede, a smile crawled across Tomura’s face. Gods, they would have to work on that too, Izuku realized with despair. Tomura really needed to learn how to smile without inspiring horror, ideally before they started letting him go outside.

“Perfect,” Tomura rasped, and to Izuku’s profound unease, he reached up to cover Izuku’s hands on his shoulder with his own. Now Izuku was the one feeling held, bizarrely, like a hostage, right there in his mom’s kitchen.

Gloved fingers twitched over his own. The pose Tomura was holding—cupping Izuku’s hands to cover his own shoulders—looked really uncomfortable, and the fact that he just smiled down at Izuku like that fell just a tad bit short of threatening.

“Sensei will be so happy when he sees us getting along,” Tomura continued.

No, Izuku thought, smiling through the discomfort up at his not-brother, He is really not going to like me influencing you against him.

Out loud, Izuku replied happily, “I’m sure he will!”

Chapter Text

As the boys headed back into the kitchen, a plethora of dishes balanced between them, Hisashi was overcome with an odd sense of foreboding.

Huh, he thought, examining the rare emotion with some sense of wonder. For some reason, this feels ominous. But it’s just Izuku, and Tomura is essentially muzzled, so! he decided resolutely, It must just be my parental instincts.

He was very good at looking out for his family, after all. When his brother was first secured in his safe, commodious room (a room that wasn’t a vault, despite what his distractors might claim), Hisashi was overcome with the feeling of satisfaction. If Yoichi was fixed to one location, he could be better protected from the horrors and heroes of the world.

Yes, when it came to parental and brotherly instincts, it was certainly safe to say that Hisashi was a natural.

Content with that conclusion, Hisashi shuttered away the odd dread and focused on his surroundings.  And, ugh, Yagi was still there, sitting stupidly close to him at his family’s table. As happy as Hisashi was to be around Inko and Izuku again, their presences significantly diminished his ability to crush Yagi into the mud like he wished.

It would be so easy. Like stepping on an old scarecrow and watching it shatter against the pavement, except destroying Yagi would feel like stepping on a pinata filled with everything that made Hisashi happy. And blood, which incidentally also made Hisashi happy.

But he couldn’t, because—for some gods awful reason—his son liked the decrepit idiot. He could only surmise it was due to the man’s previously held power and position of societal importance, which always impressed Izuku when the boy was much younger. Some of it was also likely due to Izuku’s painfully earnest nature, a nature so similar to his late brother’s that it often had Hisashi drifting into nostalgic memories.

Whatever the reason, Hisashi had to play nice for now. He could play very nice. This evening, he knew, had gone swimmingly: no one had bled yet, and Inko had kept up a charming conversation between the boys. Hisashi, of course, had been the pillar of fatherly stoicism. Minimal emotion, a strong, straight back. Largely silent, aside from when he was forced to tell Yagi how moronic and fundamentally incorrect he was. It was the longest, proper conversation in years that Hisashi had partaken in without turning some peon into a corpse.

All things considered, a good family dinner.

“Well. I hope the two of you are satisfied.”

Oh, dear. Inko did not sound nearly as content as Hisashi. A chill ran through him, identical to the chill he had experienced just a fortnight or so before he escaped from Tartarus, like a cold egg running down his back. Now he wondered if Inko had had something to do with it. For what reason she would be angry with him, then and now, he was certain he had no idea.

“I am,” Hisashi said, smiling pleasantly. Next to him, Yagi grimaced, as though this answer was a wrong thing to say. Hisashi forged on, “It was delightful to hear so much of what our boys have been up to. Do you think Izuku—”

“Hisashi,” Inko said.

Hisashi shut up. His jaw clicked together so quickly he nearly bit his tongue. Inko did not sound delighted. No, the tone Inko used in just that one word made his name sound like an expletive. Like something Inko would scrape off her shoe, but he was her innocent (criminal) husband, and despite his frantic searching, Hisashi couldn’t think of a reason Inko would be upset with him.

Aside from the years of silent child support, but they had resolved that mostly. Hisashi had let Inko chew him out for over two hours that night he had first called home—that cursed night he had taken the first steps to reclaiming his rightful place as Izuku’s true father—which was more than anyone else had ever criticized him without Hisashi ripping their tongue out.

(Except his brother, but that had ended with Hisashi thoroughly soundproofing his not-a-vault room.)

The point being that this dinner had gone swimmingly, and the sounds of Izuku’s strained voice and the Bakugou spawn’s hissing growls from the kitchen were all the sounds of well-adjusted, happy children.

“You barely spoke a word to Izuku—” Inko said, and Hisashi couldn’t help the swell of pride.

“I know,” Hisashi boasted, “in fact, I only barely emoted. Like my own father said, stoicism is the backbone of—”

“That’s a bad thing, Hisashi!” Inko declared, one hand coming up to massage at her temples, a gesture that tended to indicate that she was stressed. Hisashi just peered at her in confusion, and with a deep exhale, Inko continued, “If you truly want to be a part of Izuku’s life, you could at least speak to him. The most he heard you speak the whole dinner was to argue with Toshinori!”

“I’ve spoken with Izuku,” Hisashi argued, feeling a creeping shame. It must be because he was being scolded in front of his rival, not due to his own actions, he reasoned. “I spoke with him when I first arrived. We exchanged at least a dozen sentences.”

Inko just frowned at him sadly. Hisashi, despite having done his best to be a resilient, unaffected father figure, felt like the scum of the earth at her disappointed expression.

He had never dealt well with self-critical feelings; naturally, it was the perfect time to implicate his nemesis.

“Yagi spoke as much as I did,” Hisashi blurted, waving a hand at his competitor. Spluttering, teeth gritted, Yagi shot daggers in Hisashi’s direction, but Hisashi wasn’t about to take a lashing laying down, not unless he could pull Yagi down with him. “He is just as guilty. He- goaded me into those arguments, truly; he was glaring at me from the start of this dinner.”

“As if I could let you out of my sight anywhere near Izuku or Inko!” Yagi growled. His spindly fingers curled into fists on the table, which was about as intimidating as being threatened by a handful of twigs. One of his pathetic, skeletal hands jabbed a finger at Hisashi in accusation. “You could turn to violence on a dime. You imprisoned your own brother, so it’s hardly a stretch to think you could kidnap Izuku. He deserves so much better than a bastard as a father.”

“What, like you’re any better?” Hisashi sneered. Again, the man just had to spew the (baseless) accusation about his brother’s charitable accommodations. Rage clawed at his chest, quirks bubbling just under his skin. “You dragged Izuku into the world of heroics by giving him that misplaced quirk. Gods, I’m just trying to be in my own child’s life, doing my best to be a strong male figure, but nothing would be enough for you, would it? You just want me gone.”

“Yes!” Yagi stated. “I do.”

Oh, the audacity of the self-righteous prick. Hisashi could feel the edges of his vision tinting red, that dense anger that settled onto his enemies’ shoulders like a tangible weight. Yagi, the powerless moron, could only grimace at the sensation.

“Cut that out, you two,” Inko sighed. Hisashi shook himself out of his fury, and even Yagi blinked away in shock, because Inko suddenly sounded... sad.

Disappointed.

Lower lip caught between her teeth, the edges of her mouth visibly wobbling, Inko bared that distinctly Midoriya look of being close to tears. Instantly, Hisashi was struck with panic and regret.

“Darling,” he said, reaching for her, but she scooted herself further away from both him and Yagi, sniffling. At least his enemy wasn’t any better: Yagi was stringing his hands together, eyes wide in concern at the blubbering sounds.

“I just want Izuku to be happy,” Inko said, valiantly holding back her customary tears. “He hasn’t seen you since he was just a baby, Hisashi. He- he thought you left because he was quirkless.”

Hisashi shook his head rapidly, as though Izuku were in the room to be convinced by his actions. “No, no no,” he disputed with fervor, eyes pleading with Inko. Across the table, Yagi grimaced uselessly. “That wasn’t it at all,” Hisashi said, “it was for your safety, the both of you! I always- I always wanted to be there, but that was right around when Yagi’s former sidekick really narrowed down my location and associates. Right?” Hisashi urged, shooting a zealous look in the other man’s direction.

To his surprise—because Yagi affirming anything Hisashi said took nothing less than an act of god—Yagi nodded. “That much is true,” he agreed sadly. It looked like it pained him to say it. “Of course, we didn’t think All For One had any living family, but if Mirai-kun had discovered you…” he trailed off, a stern frown on his face. “I can’t imagine he would have disregarded you entirely.”

In the face of a Midoriya’s tears, it seemed even he and Yagi’s eternal feud could be briefly pushed aside to stem the tide.

There was quiet for a moment. It was broken by Inko’s muffled sniffles and the distant sounds of Tomura and Izuku and the Bakugou boy squabbling in the other room, and Hisashi and Yagi sat in an odd sort of guilty understanding.

“Then show him you care,” Inko said suddenly.

Hisashi blinked at her in confusion, and she elaborated, red-rimmed and puffy eyes firm, “Talk with Izuku properly, Hisashi. Show him you can be a good father to him. Take him out and, I don’t know, have some father-son bonding time, okay?”

“Okay,” Hisashi swore. He mentally tallied up and cycled through the few family-friendly activities he could think of. Then he had to cross half of them out. “The, uh… the old comics store, four blocks down? I could take him there.”

“That closed five years ago,” Inko replied.

“Right,” Hisashi murmured. He tugged at his lower lip in thought and mumbled to himself, a gesture which—for reasons beyond Hisashi’s understanding—had Yagi looking deeply unsettled. What, he couldn’t parse his thoughts without All Might expressing his disgust? What’s next, was the man going to faint at the sight of Hisashi pulling out a phone, or gasp at Hisashi performing a clean and efficient beheading?

A man could barely breathe without criticism from his inferiors these days. Back in the good old days, when Hisashi reigned over Japan from the shadows, no one would blink an eye at someone for innocently mumbling their thoughts to themselves.

No one looked too closely at anyone at all back then, actually. The general swine of the populace never knew who was going to snatch their quirk from them or slash their throat for thoughtcrimes.

Ah, yes. Really, he remembered things being a lot simpler at his height in power! Was peace truly worth all this nauseating self-reflection?  

(He had a few trusty not-vaults burning a hole in his back pocket.)

He thought back to the sickening anger that had rushed through him in Tartarus, when he had overheard the guards referring to his son as All Might’s. Gross, just the thought of it, even now. Definitely worth it, Hisashi chided himself. Still, all this reminiscing had him suddenly recalling a particularly fond memory of their family, before Hisashi had had to leave.

“I’ve got it,” he said firmly. Inko blinked in surprise at his sudden resolve. “The little amusement park in the twenty-third block? We went there when Izuku was much younger, and he adored the place—”

“He did love it,” Inko agreed, but the smile she gave him was strained and lop-sided. “But, Hisashi, that park is for those under twelve years old.”

“Ah.” Right, fuck, of course Izuku wouldn’t fit the wobbly Kappa spinning cups anymore. Hisashi remembered having to sit on the sidelines with Inko while their adorable, tiny son spun about in a shiny monstrosity of engineering. He had begrudgingly thought it was cute, and maybe he was a little bit envious of Izuku for being able to ride, but only a very small amount. 

The silence from before returned, except somehow much worse. Hisashi’s thoughts raced. His nemesis was looking at Inko with the most infuriating, sympathetic look in his eyes, which about set Hisashi’s damn blood boiling. 

He was a good father! He knew what teens liked!

He had downloaded HeroTube and LitLok as soon as he had figured out the voice-to-text commands to do so—just like a real, modern teen.

...only for Tomura to make him follow exclusively hero cringe comp accounts. Fucking hell. He really didn’t know what most teens liked, because Tomura was a damn NEET. Hisashi had begun to sweat. Inko’s brows furrowed in concern. This was all Tomura’s fault, somehow, if that boy had just been a little less susceptible to Hisashi’s strategic isolation and went outside for once!—

Thankfully, before Hisashi could come close to any sort of (gods forbid) self-criticism, Izuku chose that moment to reenter the room.

“Hey, mom,” Izuku said, an itchy-looking smile on his face. To Hisashi’s surprise, Tomura followed very closely on Izuku’s heels, staring at Izuku with a look of mild adoration. Izuku’s face contorted briefly when he looked at Hisashi and Yagi, before he added stiffly, “And, uh. Dads. Fathers.”

“Yes, my boy?” Hisashi rushed out. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Yagi’s mouth click shut, and victory ran through his veins. Beaten to the punch, you sack of bones.

Izuku leveled Hisashi with an odd, evaluative look, which Hisashi couldn’t make sense of. Nonetheless, he was determined to meet and exceed whatever judgement Izuku was bringing. He raised his head toward his son, smiling beatifically.

From under the table, Mephistopheles rattled and stirred. The bulk of the Nomu shifted up, as the dumb beast made a curious snuffling sound. It must have caught sight of Izuku, because it opened its maw with a high-pitched keen and crawled over to his son. Gods, Hisashi had about forgotten the damn thing was there. At least it couldn’t shed. Still, Hisashi glanced reflexively down to where the Nomu had lain near his feet.

Grey-green drool clung to the side of Hisashi’s (new) slacks and stained the top of his (also new) shoes. 

He took a calming breath. It was okay, because Hisashi had a shit-ton of money, and he could just...burn them, yes, there really wasn’t any cleaning out Nomu-related fluids. 

What was it that made the mangled remains of desecrated human corpses so unpleasant.

“Tomura and I are going to go out,” Izuku said, which was unexpected enough to snap Hisashi out of his corpse-inspired musings. Yagi’s jaw dropped, but Inko’s gaze lit up like Izuku had announced an engagement.

“Oh, that sounds so nice!” she gushed, flitting over to the two boys. She patted Izuku and Tomura both on the head with one hand each, smile watery and wide. “You’ve made so many friends this year, Izuku! And I’m sure you and Tomura will have so much fun; he’s older than you, dear, so he can probably show you some neat places.”

“No,” Tomura mumbled, peering up at Inko from under her outstretched arm. “I don’t know that many IRL places.”

“...Eye-arr-ehll?” Inko asked kindly. Hisashi winced: he wasn’t really one to feel ‘empathy’, but hell if Tomura didn’t make him experience secondhand embarrassment.

“Uhh.”

“I’ve got a few places in mind,” Izuku offered, sparing Inko and the world from Tomura’s description of ‘real life’. Green curls popped away for a moment as Izuku ducked out from under Inko’s arm, pausing to pat his Nomu on the head, and stepped in front of Hisashi. He wasn’t exactly looking at Hisashi, but his general attention was definitely in Hisashi’s direction, which had a pleased smile finding its way to his scarred face.

Could it be… was Izuku going to have a moment with him? Had whatever conversation he shared with Tomura in the kitchen softened him toward Hisashi’s cause, was he going to show Hisashi affection?  

Anticipation buzzed pleasantly in Hisashi’s chest.

His darling, intelligent child opened his mouth and—

“Can I use your credit card?” Izuku said.

Hisashi’s pleasant smile froze on his face. Izuku looked up sort-of-at him unblinkingly, hands carelessly in his pockets. The hope budding in Hisashi’s chest took a moment to bury itself back into the dirt in embarrassment.

Look at the bright side, he commanded himself, refusing to be defeated by teenage disaffection. At least he’s speaking to me! Words, nay, a request is leaving his mouth and arriving at what remained of Hisashi’s ears, and, scientifically speaking, Hisashi and his son were having a conversation.

“Of course,” Hisashi responded, only a bit stilted. He refused to let his smile slip—he was going to be approachable. He and his son were having a conversation. “Although, I must ask, whatever for?”

“Tomura and I are going to the mall.”

So little said, and so little explained. Discreetly, Hisashi directed his attention toward Tomura, but his successor had returned to silently staring at Izuku in wonderment. No answers there, then. His attention was pulled to the sulking shadow filling his family’s kitchen door.

“Bakuou,” Hisashi said. The single word caused the angriest boy in the room to startle, quirk going off in loud cracks against his own folded arms. Tomura jumped a full five centimeters off the floor.

“What the fuck,” the Bakugou offspring stuttered. The nunplused glare he shot at Hisashi was severe enough to curdle milk. “Don’t talk to me, you fuckin’ creep!”

“Katsuki-kun,” Inko chided, but the boy just scoffed.

“This is my home, Bakugou,” Hisashi rebuked, “and you are a guest I am speaking to. Besides, I was merely going to ask about the plans you boys had.”

With a disgruntled huff, Bakugou shoved himself away from the kitchen entrance, walking stiffly toward the apartment door. He threw it open so wide the handle struck the wall. “Nuh uh, don’t include me in Deku’s stupid plans. I ain’t going to the fuckin’ mall with Crusty Bitch and I’m not sticking around for the rest of this awkward shit. Deku,” he barked, gesturing out the door with a thumb, “when you’re done digging your own fuckin’ grave, I’ll be out here, waiting to go back to the damn dorms.”

The door slammed shut behind him. Inko sighed, shaking her head at the silver-black marks on the wall from the door handle. “Oh, dear,” she sighed. “Such a good boy, but such terrible manners. Izuku, dear,” she continued, turning and pressing a quick kiss to Izuku’s forehead. She stepped back with a loving pat at the arm. “Why don’t you and Tomura finish setting up your plans before you go, okay?”

Izuku nodded, rubbing at the place Inko had kissed with the back of his hand like he could wipe off the affection. Smiling at the childish gesture, Inko turned toward Yagi’s awkward, hunched figure.

“Come on, Toshinori,” she urged. “Let’s let Izuku, Tomura and Hisashi have a moment to themselves, okay?”

The oaf opened his mouth to argue, but with a clever use of her quirk, Inko pulled his jaw shut. Wide-eyed, one hand reaching to try to force his mouth open against the pull, Yagi stood and visibly struggled in indecision.

Thankfully, Hisashi’s lovely wife made the decision for him. Inko took Yagi by the arm and dragged him down the hallway, and Hisashi could hear her speaking to the man in harsh, critical whispers. Ha. Serves him right.

“I don’t need a moment with you.”

Izuku’s voice was as firm as his mother’s. Hisashi huffed, turning back to him. “Didn’t you mention you needed to use my credit card?” he asked. He reached into one of his suit pockets, pulling out his wallet and dangling a sleek black card in front of him like a flashy prize.

His son’s eyes narrowed in on the sight. “Yeah, we do,” he muttered, “but Tomura and I can handle ourselves. I have a pl- I have an itinerary.”

“Oh?” Hisashi prodded. “Do tell.”

Expression setting stubbornly, Izuku frowned. “We’re going to get Tomura’s hair cut. And yes, I know we’ll have to hide his face. I already thought about that.”

“We’re also gonna go shopping for skincare,” Tomura chimed in, finally returning his attention to Hisashi with a smirk. He was obviously flourishing under even the bare minimum of Izuku’s attention, and Hisashi had to fight down the absurd jealousy that inspired. “Did you know some people do that? Care for their skin, like it’s a pet or something?”

“Right, we’re doing a few different things,” Izuku huffed. “We’re getting to know each other and stuff. That’s what you wanted, right? We’ve been talking and sharing political viewpoints and everything.”

“Close,” Hisashi said, leaping onto the opportunity like a predator on prey. “I certainly do want you and your brother to spend more time together, but you’re missing something.”

Izuku furrowed his brow, clearly confused. Next to him, one of those disconcerting smiles started on Tomura’s face; for once, he seemed to have caught on quicker than Izuku. “Huh?” his son asked.

Drawing himself up to his full height, hands smoothing themselves down the sleek lines of his black suit, Hisashi grinned down at his son. “Why, we should all go together, of course! As a family.” He waved his cred card at Izuku, gesturing from his head to his feet. 

“After all, if you’re planning on one makeover, we might as well make it two! And one of the first things we need to do is get you a properly fitted suit.”

Chapter Text

It wasn’t until he was lying sleeplessly in bed that night that Izuku let the panic hit him.

When he’d left his mother’s apartment, blank and lost in thought as he walked two steps behind Bakugou, he had managed to keep his cool. Throughout the train ride back to UA—during which Bakugou had forced them both to cover up their t-shirts so as to not be accosted by the public—he had gnawed at his lower lip and mumbled quietly to himself.

It said a lot about Bakugou’s frame of mind that he didn’t even tell Izuku to shut up once. His friend must be deeply unsettled, to pass up such an opportunity.

As the two walked back up to their respective dorms, Izuku was largely quiet. It wasn’t until he was standing in front of his room door, one hand on his doorknob and his nomu flopped at his feet, that he managed to rouse out of his overly-reflective state.

“Kacchan…” he started, turning to Bakugou with a hesitant, desperate little smile. “You, uh… you’ll come with me next weekend, right? When Tomura and my biodad and I all go to the mall—”

“Absolutely fucking not,” Bakugou declared. His face went flat into a grimace, an expression that generally served as a warning for one of his ‘pissy brat’ moods, but Izuku was hopeless enough to beg.

“But you- you want to make stuff up to me, don’t you?” he tried, hand gone white on the doorknob. A part of his racing, stumbling brain tried to focus on not breaking the handle in a quirk-fueled stress grip. It wasn’t like Izuku wanted to guilt trip Bakugou into anything, but gods, the situation was dire enough to warrant digging up any dirt he could find.

(Sometimes the ends justified the means, even if those means were kind of...mean, Izuku acknowledged.

But look—when you’re put up against the devil in the form of your deadbeat dad, maybe you have to get your hands in the soil a bit. Maybe you poke around and nudge a few cooling corpses aside in your quest for some leverage.

It wasn’t the most heroic thing to do, but surely even All Might had had to blackmail or exploit a comrade at some point. Right? Right.)

Bakugou just grimaced, turning his face with a ‘tch’. “You’re really gonna bring that shit into this, huh?”

“Well, I communicated it non-verbally earlier, and I- I meant it!” Izuku declared, and he only shuttered a little bit. Even just doubling down on his somewhat justified stance made him sweat. 

“Yeah, well that was before All for fuckin’ One decided to invite himself along,” Bakugou stated. His face screwed up even further, like he had smelled something gross. “You really expect me to play nice with that bastard again? No fuckin’ way. Sitting in the same room as him at Aunty’s earlier almost made me barf. Fixing up Crusty Hands alone was already pushing it!”

Izuku didn’t let up on his pleading, hopeful stare. He’d shaken out his whiteknuckle grip on the doorknob and taken to wringing his anxious hands together in front of him. “Kacchan, I need you,” he urged. “Half my wardrobe is novelty t-shirts, you know that, and your parents are fashion designers. I need you to help me Queer Eye this.”

“No you fuckin’ don’t. You’re not straight either, idiot. Act like it for once and Queer Eye the recluse your damn self!”

“I may be bisexual,” Izuku allowed, “but I’m the kind that can’t talk properly with girls or boys and can’t dress myself! I’m a mess!”

With a defiant huff, Bakugou turned away from Izuku, shoving his hands in his pockets and stomping off down the hallway. “Your dad seems to be able to dress himself,” he called. “Just let that evil fuckhead put you in a damn suit or something.”

“He doesn’t even have eyes!” Izuku cried. 

Merciless, coldblooded, Bakugou just flipped him off over his shoulder. He didn’t even bother to turn and face him to do it.

And that had been that.

In a way, he had dug himself into this hole, Izuku acknowledged later that night, staring aimlessly at his own ceiling. It was his own hubris that had confirmed the ‘Dad Might’ theory, and his own easily mislead friends that spilled the theory to their school at large. It was his own big mouth that blurted out the idea of rehabilitating Shigaraki Tomura via makeover.

His eyelids were heavy and scratchy, his mind fatigued from enduring the presence of two psychotic new family members, but his thoughts were heavier.

From the corner, hidden in shadows, the grunt-like snores of his Nomu filled the room. He didn’t think Nomus even had to sleep…? 

(Was that a feature? Why would his evil bio-father bioengineer a Nomu that needed to sleep? Maybe something to do with a cellular regeneration quirk depended on a present REM cycle. Do Nomus dream? He felt his stubbornly shut eyes tear up at the thought, which wow, he really was a crybaby.)

It wasn’t until very late—or very early—that Izuku finally fell into a restless sleep.

He was in a field of black smog. Smoke curled and obscured the distance, heavy in the air and when it brushed against his arms. The distance seemed to stretch on forever, and in that distance, Izuku caught sight of a few human-looking shapes.

Suddenly, Izuku knew where he was, and he knew he was dreaming. He had been here before, after all, when he had awoken the quirks of One for All’s previous users. But why now, unless—

Oh, no. Did they see, could he have seen…

“So,” a considering male voice said from behind him. “My brother really is your dad, isn’t he?”

They did see. So, it was the nightmare scenario. 

Izuku turned to face his metaphorical, and maybe literal, judgement. With his long white hair, oversized clothing, and feeble stature, the first One for All user really shouldn’t have been intimidating. And yet. Izuku fidgeted, reaching up to find, to his surprise, that his mouth was uncovered.

He tried speaking, opening his mouth with an awkward croak. “We found that out weeks ago,” he said weakly. There was no way to have this conversation, even in a quirk-induced dream state, that wasn’t going to be awkward.

“Yeah,” said Yoichi, and he scrunched his mouth up into a little frown. “Honestly, I didn’t believe any of you.”

Staring at the First with a look of betrayal, Izuku choked out, “What, too horrifying to think?” If he were having this conversation in the real world, this is probably where he’d start crying. As it was, he just made a distressed face and continued, “Did you- what, did you think I would want this? That I was making it up for some reason?”

“What?” Yoichi replied, blinking down at Izuku. He seemed to catch on to Izuku’s miserable state, and he waved a hand frantically, as if he could physically dispel Izuku’s doubts. “No, no that’s not it!”

“Then what?” Izuku sniffed. Reflexively, he rubbed at his face to scrub away non-existent tears.

Yoichi seemed to ponder how he wanted to phrase whatever he was about to say—maybe how to lessen the blow, Izuku thought, because obviously the First One for All user thought Izuku was an overly-imaginative baby—as he stared into the foggy black distance. Izuku waited silently, a boy-shaped heap of insecurity.

Finally, with a nod to himself, Yoichi seemed to find his words: “The most unrealistic part of this situation is that someone would actually, willingly marry my brother.”

Izuku just blinked at Yoichi, which the First apparently took as a queue to continue.

“I love my brother,” he elaborated, “but he is fundamentally unlikeable as a person.”

Oh. That all checked out. “He’s pretty rude,” Izuku agreed, only sniffling a little. “And he is a villain.”

“Yeah,” Yoichi sighed, digging a hand into his fluffy white hair. “All the murdering really put me off. I stuck by him for so long. I even put up with all his raving about cryptocurrency and his plans for overthrowing the parliament and everything, but….”

“Murder is bad,” Izuku nodded very wisely.

“Even worse than his NFT schemes, and that’s saying something,” Yoichi huffed. “So yeah. I couldn’t see anyone marrying Hisashi, let alone a kind, sweet woman like your mother, and I didn’t really believe what everyone was saying. Your mom must be able to either shut him up or tune him out, to be able to live with him and not get put into a vault.”

“A vault...?!”

“Ehh, don’t worry about it. It was just a phase he went through.” With a dismissive wave of his hand, baggy sleeve billowing, Yoichi changed topics. 

(Izuku was going to worry about it.)  

“Anyway, his rotten personality doesn’t matter anymore. He’s your dad which means he successfully reproduced, somehow.” Yoichi stepped closer to Izuku, ruffling his hair with a fond smile. “I’m not mad or anything, by the way, you worrywart.”

“Really?” Izuku asked weakly, peeking up at Yoichi.

“That would be pretty hypocritical of me, wouldn’t it?” Yoichi laughed. “I’m just as closely related to him as you are!”

“Oh. Right!”

“Right,” Yoichi agreed, nodding. He stepped back from Izuku and turned away, facing into the undefined, smog-filled distance. “If anyone was going to be mad, it wouldn’t be me, anyway. Like I said, I love him, despite everything; he’s still my brother.” Squinting into the black fog, Yoichi muttered, “The Holders that would be the most upset would probably be Eight, but he’s been pretty understanding of this whole thing, from what I’ve seen in your world. Yagi really cares about you. And of course—”

“Me!”

At the bright, feminine voice cutting through the inky mist, Izuku swirled around, a hand going to his chest. His heart wasn’t racing, because they were in the mental-space of a quirk and he didn’t even have a heartbeat here, but in the real world he would have probably jumped out of his skin at the sight of the Seventh One for All holder.

“Sh- Shimura-san!” he gasped, staring up even further at her. Wow, she was tall, and muscly, look at those biceps—!

“Thanks, kid,” Shimura Nana said with a grin. She flexed her arms, which wow again: no wonder her costume was sleeveless. “I worked out a lot for these guns.”

Oh no, did Izuku say that out loud? Gods, this was embarrassing. This was his mentor’s mentor, he shouldn’t be complimenting her musculature! He needed to stop mumbling, and apparently stop thinking because his bisexuality was too loud to be kept inside his head.

“You did say it out loud,” Nana confirmed, solidifying Izuku’s mortification. “But hey, feel free to keep the compliments rolling!”

“The only thing rolling will be me,” Izuku said, “in my grave.” He kept his eyes on the hazy white ground, since he seemingly couldn’t even look at strong people without blurting every humiliating observation.

“Don’t be such a damn downer,” Nana sighed fondly. She reached out and punched Izuku lightly, friendly, on the arm. It felt like being tapped by a handful of bowling balls. Izuku would probably have a bruise there when he woke up.

(He would treasure the bruise forever.)

Even in the face of Nana’s incessant cheer, Izuku felt shame curdle in his stomach as he looked downward. It was true what the First said, that he wasn’t the first One for All user to be related to his biofather, but for some reason, being a direct descendant felt more damning than Yoichi’s status as his brother.

“You’re really not mad at me?” he asked her quietly.

Nana heaved a big sigh, and Izuku caught the commiserating look she shot at Yoichi. “I’m really, really not,” she confirmed. “You can’t help who you’re related to, kid.”

“He killed you.”

“Yep,” she popped, and she gave a bitter little smile. “But that was the past, and I chose to stand up to him. You’re not your father. No point in taking anything out on a sweet kid like you. Besides, it’s not like I’m getting any deader!”

“Shimura-san!” Izuku gasped. For some reason, just flat out referring to herself as dead felt kind of… inappropriate. Even though Izuku was talking to the spiritual remains of her ghost living in a quirk. Nana laughed. Yoichi even huffed out a chuckle.

“I think the strangest part about this situation is how closely Nine’s mom resembles Seven,” he said. 

He had to gall to say this casually, as though the statement wasn’t something purely disturbing. Izuku felt his brain stop and restart, processing rapidly in horror. “What?” he said flatly.

Reaching a hand up to pat at her hair, Nana grimaced at Yoichi. “Ew, dude. The hair, sure, but… ughh. The face too, huh?”

“Uh huh,” Yoichi nodded.

“No,” Izuku said. They didn’t seem to hear this, and continued like they weren’t saying utterly horrifying things.

“Maybe he’s got a complex,” Nana said jokingly, striking a pose that showed off the strong curvature of her body. “Did I make that much of an impression on him? He not used to big, strong women punching him in the face?”

“Definitely not,” Yoichi laughed. “I think you may be one of the first to manage it! It probably rocked his world.”

“No,” Izuku repeated.

“Do I look like your guys’ mom or something?” Nana pondered, smirking. “Maybe it’s some kind of mommy—”

“Please stop I am begging you,” Izuku blurted. He pinched at his arm, hard, to maybe wake himself up from what had rapidly become a nightmare.

Nana scoffed, reaching over and ruffling Izuku’s hair. It was a move he was quickly beginning to associate with parental figures casually flipping his world on its head and then depositing said world in a garbage can.

“Okay, okay, I’m done!” she said, holding her hands up in forfeit. “I was just saying, though!”

“Never say it again, please,” Izuku begged. Pinching his arm hadn’t worked, so he could only assume that this whole nightmare sequence was his penance for being related to All for One.

“I thought you’d want to hear from her directly,” Yoichi stated, smiling guiltily. “That she wasn’t mad at you, I mean. You tend to internalize a lot of misplaced guilt.”

(Ironically, Izuku felt guilty the First had to explain this to him. Ouch.)

“Thanks,” he said, in lieu of confirming his own martyr complex. “It, um. It helps to hear it.”

“That’s all I wanted to say,” Nana provided. She smiled down at Izuku again, more genuinely than before. “I’ll leave you two to talk about the development with your quirks and stuff. C’ya, kiddo!”

“Bye,” Izuku returned, before catching what she said and choking on his own spit. “Wait, did you say—”

Shimura Nana had already faded away into the black mist, gone as quickly as she had arrived and leaving no trace of herself, aside from the smarting bruise on Izuku’s upper arm. Izuku didn’t know where exactly the other One for All holders went when they weren’t speaking to him, but he assumed it was somewhere in the ether where they laughed at him.

He turned toward Yoichi, wide eyed. “She misspoke, right?” he pleaded. “She- she meant I’m awakening one of the previous user’s quirks?”

Yoichi hummed in reply, tapping a finger at his lip and glancing off to the side. “Yes, but no.” His mouth was tight at the edges, like he knew how bullshit his own reply was. 

“That means nothing.”

With a guilty grimace, Yoichi nodded. “You’re right. I’m just trying to think of how to explain it. It’s… tough to say.”

“You’re just making it worse!” Izuku exclaimed. He had gone from slightly unsettled to very unsettled, so if the First could stop being so damn cryptic and just explain things, he would appreciate it!

“It can’t get much worse than this,” Yoichi responded, then crossed his arms and declared: “You are awakening a previous user’s quirk, but that quirk is my brother’s.”

(Izuku did not appreciate it.)

There were a few moments of heavy, confused silence. Izuku had frozen in place, blinking up at the First with a baffled expression. The first thing he could think of saying, a rational refutation, was, “But All for One isn’t a One for All user.”

“He made it,” Yoichi explained. “So, in a way, he used it.”

“That’s dumb. That’s- that’s not how that works.”

Yoichi shrugged, a helpless gesture that had his baggy sleeves falling down to expose his skinny arms. “Look, you’re his biological son and it looks like you’ve inherited his quirk. I’m just saying what I can feel happening inside One for All. Maybe his quirk never would have manifested within you if you hadn’t received One for All, but it’s definitely sprouting up.”

Mouth hanging open, Izuku squinted up at Yoichi in confusion. “But… I have the toe joint,” he argued.

“So did I,” Yoichi grimaced, “and so does Hisashi.”

“What the fuck,” Izuku said.

Izuku woke up.

“What the fuck,” he repeated, voice rough with sleep. It certainly bore repeating, because the First One for All user must have been misinterpreting whatever the hell he was sensing or seeing within their quirk.

How the hell does a quirk ‘sprout’, anyway? That’s not how quirks worked. There was a whole science to quirk manifestation. It was logical, and based on genetics. It was rational.

Izuku had eaten his mentor’s hair to obtain his quirk, then broken both his legs when he first used it. That wasn’t very logical, he could admit.

He rolled over in bed, coming face-to-face with the drooling, fanged maw of his Nomu. Head slightly dizzy, he reached out a hand from under his duvet and poked it in its forehead. 

“Quirks used to make sense,” he bemoaned. He jabbed his finger into its head with force. “I loved studying quirks. Then All Might gave me his, and then my evil sperm donor showed up, and now nothing makes sense anymore.”

Mephi-chan stared at him with all the awareness of a particularly stupid dog. It groaned in some sort of consolation and licked his arm.

Weirdly, it kind of helped. “You’re a genetic abomination,” he cooed to it. “You don’t make sense and you’re an undead bioweapon, yes you are.”

It huffed in excitement and rolled over, flopping to the ground and releasing a truly earsplitting screech of (what he assumed was) joy. Mephi-chan had taken to gnawing through the multiple variations of All for One figurines Izuku had made for it—he made one with an intact, smugly grinning face and white hair, and another with the scarred, helmeted head—and it was always cathartic to observe. 

Izuku glanced away from Mephi-chan and flexed his hand in front of him. It didn’t make any sense that using One for All could awaken some kind of dormant strain of All for One hiding away in his genetic code, but the First seemed pretty certain about it.

And nothing really made logical sense in his life anymore, anyway.

He rolled back over in bed, holding his hand to the ceiling. If he did have All for One, how would he even go about using it? He couldn’t feel it, didn’t feel any different from before. One would think a quirk as powerful as All for One would make itself known.

Would he want to use it? Taking people’s quirks wasn’t exactly very heroic, but it seemed negligent not to acknowledge what was really another tool in his arsenal. Reflecting back on a previous conversation with Shinsou-kun, Izuku acknowledged that quirks weren’t inherently good or bad. 

He would learn how to use it, he decided on, but he wouldn’t really use it on anyone.

Next weekend was his outing with his biodad, and as much of a bastard as he was, the man definitely knew how to use his quirk. He would ask Hisashi then about the mechanics of All for One—all in theory, of course. He didn’t plan on showing his hand quite yet.

No, if and when he ever had to use the quirk, it would be a surprise to everyone. Not that he was planning on it.

(Something about knowing he had a powerful quirk hidden up his sleeve felt... good. It felt good to have the upper hand for once.)

Chapter Text

Returning to class after having dinner with arguably the deadliest man in Japan was kind of surreal.

Izuku sat at his desk, kicking his feet at the Nomu under his chair, tapping his pencil incessantly at his notebook. In front of him, Bakugou’s shoulders were noticeably tense; Izuku was pretty sure he saw him practicing his deep breathing techniques. Not that there was a reason for Bakugou to feel stressed: he had wisely decided, per yesterday’s one-sided pleading, to bail on him, once his sperm donor had invited himself along his little rendezvous with Tomura.

No, Bakugou really had no reason to be tense. Izuku was the one having to deal with an impending weekend with a fixated supervillain, he was the only one around here that had any real reason to be anxious!

There was a loud crack! as Izuku’s pencil dug through pages of his notebook and into the top of his desk. Bakugou’s shoulders twitched threateningly at the sound, noticeably tensing, and Uraraka jumped a bit in her chair. When Izuku lifted the tattered remains of the notebook up to check for damage, amongst the uneasy silence of their class, he was dismayed to see he had fractured the surface of yet another desk.

That was the third one this month… Izuku lamented. 

Aizawa paused in front of their classroom, bringing a merciful halt to his lecture on evacuation safety protocols. “Midoriya,” he stated, both a summons and a chastisement. From the corner of the room, Mina and Kaminari were snickering. “Is there something you’d like to say?”

“We- well, I—”

“If the situation doesn’t put anyone in the room in mortal peril, say no.”

“N… No, sensei,” Izuku sighed in defeat. He’d never felt guilty for not putting people in imminent danger before, but he supposed there was a first time for everything when your life was a circus of stupidity. 

“Oh, thank gods,” Aizawa muttered. He ran a hand down his face. “For a second there, I was worried something absurd was going to happen. Again.” He hesitated for a fraction of a section, before adding, “For the record, if something actually is going on, don’t let me stop you from bringing it up.”

“You couldn’t stop me if I didn’t let you, Sensei,” Izuku mumbled into the tattered pages. He tossed the mangled stub of his pencil toward his Nomu, which promptly gnawed it into bits.

Bakugou whipped around at this, eyes narrowed in suspicious. Oops, Izuku thought casually, No one was supposed to hear that. At least it’s just Kacchan.

Bakugou silently mouthed at him, ‘What the fuck?’ but thankfully didn’t say anything out loud. Izuku just gave his friend a bashful smile.

‘Just talking to myself,’ he mouthed back. With that being said, he ripped out the torn, ruined pages from his notebook, a brutal tearing sound that had some of his classmates flinching, and shoved the pages along to his Nomu too.

Strangely, Bakugou didn’t seem appeased by Izuku’s genuine reassurance. His posture stayed stiff in front of him for the remainder of the day, and he shot suspicious glares at Izuku whenever he was unable to stop himself from mumbling varied plans to himself for dealing with his biodad.

When he brought up Bakugou’s behavior to his other friends at lunch, Uraraka squinted at him, lips pursed as though she was holding herself back from saying something chastising. Iida just looked vaguely uncomfortable, stirring at his noodles stiffly, which surprised Izuku: since his family had gone public about All Might being Izuku’s dad, Iida was generally eager to discuss the ‘burden of upholding a heroic legacy’ with Izuku. He wouldn’t have any idea of the drama with Izuku’s genetic procreator, so it wouldn’t be that. Maybe something else about the conversation made him uncomfortable…?

“It sounds like Bakugou was creeped out,” Todoroki said bluntly. Izuku blinked at his friend, startled, and Uraraka facepalmed.

“You don’t have to just say it like that, Todoroki-kun!” she bemoaned, muffled behind her hand. Next to her, Iida cleared his throat tactfully, but neither agreed nor disagreed.

“Why not?” Todoroki asked, tilting his head in confusion. “He was wondering why Bakugou was looking at him oddly, and I’m pretty sure I’m right. Why shouldn’t I say it?”

“‘Cause it’s rude,” Uraraka grumbled, finally sliding her hand off of her face. “Yeah, what Deku said was creepy—”

“Oh,” Izuku mumbled sadly. So he had been creepy.

“—but you could bring it up a little more gently, you know?”

“Oh,” said Todoroki, frowning down at his soba. He turned to Izuku, gaze serious, and put a hand on his shoulder. Izuku jolted, startled; Todoroki wasn’t normally the most tactile person.

“Midoriya,” he whispered softly, patting his shoulder with a featherlight touch, “it sounds like Bakugou was creeped out.”

Izuku couldn’t have stopped himself from blushing if he tried. Not that he had it within himself to try, caught so off guard as he was. “I, I don’t think so?” he squeaked out. “Kacchan isn’t easily creeped, and, um. Your hand is still on my shoulder?”

“Uraraka said to be gentle,” Todoroki replied. His hand patted his shoulder again. “I’m not a very physical person, but I’ve seen a lot of people comfort others like this. It’s gentle.”

“I take it back,” Uraraka said, grimacing at where Todoroki’s hand rubbed across Izuku’s upper back. “Maybe stick to being blunt, Todoroki-kun.”

“And, hm. What Todoroki-kun said has some merit, don’t you think?” Iida added. It looked like it pained him to say anything so critical of his friend, but Iida was nothing if not persistent. He pushed onward, continuing firmly, “Not that you were in the wrong to speak your mind, Midoriya-kun! Well, that is, you shouldn’t suggest that our esteemed teachers are incapable of controlling their classroom, because that’s terribly rude. Our teachers at UA are very skillful and deserve our full respect.”

“I wasn’t trying to disrespect Aizawa-sensei or anything,” Izuku rushed to clarify, mildly horrified. “I would never! He’s amazing, he’s a really good hero and a great teacher and everything! It’s just. Erm.”

“What were you trying to say, then?” Uraraka prompted, genuine and kind in a way Izuku probably didn’t deserve, because…  

I was just thinking that I apparently have this new, terrible quirk that could make everyone around me effectively powerless, and I just haven’t figured out how to use it yet, Izuku didn’t say.

“Maybe I’m just going through my rebellious phase,” he said instead, like a liar. Todoroki nodded understandably at this, and Uraraka smiled sympathetically. Izuku wondered at the fact that his friends just accepted what he said at face value so often. He was so blessed to have such gullible trusting friends.

Iida nodded sagely. “Many people our age go through such a phase, but you should try to work out this rebellion in a healthy way, like exercise, and not by critiquing our distinguished teachers,” Iida advised, as though he hadn’t tried to hunt down a serial killer in an act of viginalente fury himself in his first year of high school.

“Right,” Izuku agreed mindlessly, “I’ll try sparring more, or something.”

“I could join you,” Todoroki offered. “I’ve been meaning to work out a few moves, recently. I could use some hands-on practice.

Something stirred, eager, in the back of Izuku’s thoughts. It felt like the urge that overcame Izuku when he saw some new All Might merch that he hadn’t obtained yet, greedy and restless. He didn’t want to name it, so he acted appropriately:

He ignored his problems and brushed them aside. It had worked wonders so far!

“Sounds great, Todoroki-kun!” he smiled. “Maybe Wednesday night? We have that quiz tomorrow, after all, so I’m gonna be busy studying tonight…”

“Sounds good,” Todoroki confirmed, speaking over Uraraka’s startled squawk of, “There’s a quiz tomorrow?! Wait, what subject?”

As their conversation turned to studying, Izuku was distracted by a persistent tickling in the center of his hands. 

His palms itched.

Sparring had always helped him relax and break down his thoughts. Usually, these thoughts centered around battle strategies or quirk theory or his most recent hero fixation. That evening, though, his mind kept straying.

Like it was tugged by a string, his right hand kept raising and flexing on itself. It was an oddly focused feeling: right in the center of his palm, a concentrated itching had his hand twitching outward, incessantly, as though reaching to grab his sparring partner.

The back of his mind was squirming, too. It was a feeling not unlike anticipation, like his instincts were looking forward to some great meal Izuku wasn’t consciously aware of. He wanted… he wanted…

“Something wrong?” Todoroki asked. With a quick stretch, he dropped his stance and reached his arm over his head, letting blood flow to his exerted limb. His eyes, as always, remained totally placid.

The two of them stood in the center of one of the gym’s open sparring areas, freshly done with a cardio warm-up. A dozen or so other students flitted around in the background, chatting as they went about routines, the natural clangs and grunts of the gym filling the atmosphere. Usually Izuku’s attention would stray, unable to entirely disregard other students staring his way, but today, Izuku was having trouble even focusing on his friend.

“Hm?” Izuku hummed mindlessly. He couldn’t seem to take his eyes off of his hand, for some reason. Idly, he hoped the weird buzzing feeling wasn’t some kind of terrible, terminal illness. He didn’t really know of any diseases that originated in the hand. Usually extremities were some of the first things to go, if there was an interruption in blood flow or something off with the nervous system, but there was little fatty tissue in the hands to develop—

“Don’t die at school,” Todoroki said. “Aizawa-sensei said that earlier today, remember? If we die under his jurisdiction, he has to fill out the paperwork, and he said he’d ‘hunt us down into the afterlife if we make him deal with that level of bureaucracy.’”

“Oh, sorry, I didn’t. I said that out loud?” Izuku asked, which, obviously. His friend nodded, expression frowning just the slightest bit, so Izuku shook his head and waved his (tingly) hands with a frantic smile. “I’m fine! Nothing wrong here, nope! Not anything at all!”

“You were mumbling about your limbs falling off,” Todoroki responded, not convinced by Izuku’s reassurance. He eyed Izuku’s scarred skin. “Given the state of your arms, I don’t think I’m wrong to assume one of them could do so.”

“My arms aren’t falling off.” (He was mostly, mostly sure about that. If anything was going to fall off, it would be his hand. Which it wouldn’t.)

Todoroki squinted at him suspiciously, his swoopy hair falling across his eyes. “Not even one of them?” he probed, staring at the hand Izuku had guiltily stuffed behind his back to keep it from twitching.

“I’m at least 95% sure that neither of my arms are falling off,” Izuku replied honestly. (He was only 70% sure one of his hands wouldn’t fall off, though, but Todoroki hadn’t asked that.) He shook his arm out, flexing and stretching with a big smile. “Enough about my arms, though. I’m good to go, if you are?”

Todoroki nodded, falling into form: crouched, arms out, and body low to the ground. They’d agreed to limit the use of quirks, since Izuku was trying to work his anxieties out, and the best way to do that was good old fashioned sparring. They bowed to each other, eyed one another up, and then, pushing himself off with a kick, Izuku sprung into action.

As frustrating as Todoroki could be when he ran his mouth, his sparring abilities more than made up for his lack of social skills. He met Izuku blow for blow, and his fighting skills were significantly better than Izuku’s. Whereas Izuku had mostly put together his moves from hyperfixating on All Might and through the incredible education of grainy, disconnected HeroTube videos, Todoroki had a proper martial arts education.

In no time at all, Izuku was brushing off the weird tingling in his hand. The rush of sparring had him smiling, focusing on the physical movements an the internal strategy required of him in fighting Todoroki. By the time he and his friend were getting out of breath, he had almost entirely forgotten about the weird sensation.

And then, wrapping up the fight, Izuku delivered a flat palm strike to Todoroki’s chest.

It was like sticking his finger in an electrical socket.

With a jolt, Izuku froze in place. He couldn’t move his hand, like his contact there was holding Izku firmly in place, anchored from his hand’s barely-there contact with the other’s body. Todoroki’s brows furrowed at Izuku’s frozen posture and look of bewilderment, and he attempted to step back. Izuku’s traitorous hand clenched close in his shirt, holding the other immobile.

“Midoriya?” Todoroki asked. He peered at Izuku’s stricken face and lifted a hand up to grip where Izuku had attached to his chest at the wrist. “Are you okay…?”

“I can’t move my hand?” Izuku warbled. His heart was pounding hard, and the center of his palm was heating up, like he was holding a pot fresh off the stove. “Oh. I think, uh, my quirk, there’s something—”

Of its own volition, his hand clenched tight into a fist above Todorki’s chest, and Izuku reeled at the feeling of something in his hand being caught in some kind of invisible hook. Todoroki paled dramatically and swayed on his feet, like he’d suddenly blood and was closed to passing out, but Izuku was too busy being overtaken by a hot-cold wave of full-body shivers to focus on helping his friend.

He yelped, the bizarre rush of temperature overwhelming him into falling over onto his ass. Thankfully, the moment his hand removed itself from Todoroki and flailed behind him to catch himself against the floor, the surge of buzzing, bubbling voltage vanished, and Izuku was left gasping and gaping up at the other.

Todoroki wasn’t much better. He had stayed on his feet, despite his swaying, but he had bent over and grabbed at his knees, breath equally as heavy as Izuku’s. While Izuku was busy being flabbergasted on the floor, though, Todoroki recovered characteristically quickly.

“That was really weird,” he said, only slightly out-of-breath. “For a second, my quirk was acting up too, I think.” Raising his hands up, Todoroki let off tiny, quick bursts of ice and fire, testing his control. He shook his head in dismissal.

Izuku didn’t know what to say, except the one thing that was running over and over through his mind, which was: “That was fucked up,” he gulped. “I don’t know what I did but it was fucked up.”

“You swore,” Todoroki observed. “You don’t do that very often, so it must have been pretty bad for you, too.”

“Yeah,” Izuku replied mindlessly. “It was…something.”

“I felt like my quirk was trying to jump out of me,” Todoroki continued, frowning down at the floor. “I’m sorry. I must have lost control, somehow, even though I don’t understand what happened.”

Izuku shook his head, guilt crawling over him. “No, I think it was all my quirk,” he stated. ( One of my two quirks, plural, he kept to himself.) He pulled himself off the ground and stood back up on wobbly legs. The hot-cold electric feeling throughout his body had disappeared, like it was never there at all, but he was dismayed to feel that his palm had regained the previous tingly, buzzing feeling.

Whatever his biofather’s stupid quirk had tried to do—and there was really only one thing that the All for One quirk could do—Todoroki was obviously fine. He had used his quirk and didn’t seem to have any issues, based on the tight control he demonstrated when testing it himself.

Izuku promptly engaged Todoroki in a conversation about the test tomorrow. Todoroki seemed surprised by the change of topic, but, bless his socially incompetent heart, took the blatant attempt at brushing what had just happened under the rug with all the stoic grace he did everything else.

Nothing had happened, Izuku affirmed to himself. Well, something had happened, something stupid with a stupid quirk that he didn’t want from his stupid sperm donor. But nothing permanent had happened, so. So.

That’s an event for the Suppressed Memory box in the back of my mind, Izuku thought. He didn’t need to worry about it. He already had plenty to worry about, anyway, to add an unruly new quirk to the list.

It was a fluke, that was all. This had been a normal, perfectly fine day!

(Izuku’s palms, shoved into his pockets, continued tingling throughout the day.)

Sensei was acting weird.

Tomura had observed the man smile at nothing, humming to himself through the black steel of his industrial mask, more within the last 24 hours than he had ever before. There were only a few things that actually made Sensei happy: murder, conspiracy, and his family. Given that Sensei had been bloodstain-free since their family dinner, and given the lack of mutilated corpses, it could only be the latter.

Meanwhile, Tomura…

Well, what his little brother and his rotten blond friend had said was sticking to his mind. When he was gaming (with the few games he had access to), and the screen would go briefly dark during scene transitions, he would catch sight of his own reflection. His scowling, flaky face looked back at him.

“Water is drying…” Tomura muttered at his screen. “...water is wet, but it’s drying. Wet shit makes you dry. That’s what that chad-looking douchebag blond brat said.” He leaned back in his ergonomic gamer chair, head hanging backward; across the room, Sensei was listening to something on his phone, expression focused and eager. He had a notebook, of all things, in front of him, and occasionally he’d tap at his screen and pause to scribble something down with a fervor, muttering to himself.

Tomura squinted at him. Maybe it was because he was looking at Sensei upside down, but when he smiled and muttered at himself and scrawled notes, Sensei really looked like his son. 

If his son was a giant, and wore a big metal bucket on his head. Or if his son ripped half his face off.

Wait a damn minute. “How does he know what he’s writing if he can’t see,” he grumbled to himself, and, a bit reluctantly, Tomura removed his cat-eared headphones (which he bought for because the microphone sound quality was good and not because he wanted to have cat ears) and righted himself in his seat. His limbs contorted awkwardly as he sat back in his chair like a normal person.

“...I see,” Sensei mumbled, hand raising to tug at his lip. “Phone,” he commanded. Ugh, why was Sensei so bad at naming things? Tomura grimaced. Now that he thought about it, he gave his green-haired wife the family name Midoriya, so painfully on-the-nose anyone less kind would tell you to try again.

“Sensei, how do you write when you can’t—”

“Phone,” Sensei repeated firmly, raising one of his broad hands toward Tomura in the universal gesture to stop. Tomura swallowed his words reluctantly. Sensei nodded at him, then continued, “Is there a BookFace page for phone contact Midoriya Izuku?”

Oh, no. Sensei was trying to learn more about his child from his online presence. Tomura grimaced, prepared for the worst.

In its monotone voice, Sensei’s phone chimed back: “I wasn’t able to find a BookFace account for your phone contact Midoriya Izuku. However, I did manage to find accounts for this phone number on Instablam, HeroTube, and WaffPad.”

“Those first two, I’ve heard of those,” Sensei mumbled to himself, tapping his pen on his notebook. “You showed me HeroTube, certainly. That last one, though. What’s a WaffPad?”

“Don’t know,” Tomura lied, throat dry.

Godspeed, little brother, he wished out into the universe. Sensei wants you to like him, whether you want to or not. And he’s gonna do his research.
Chapter 19
Summary:

    hiiii 🤡 happy new year x2. That's correct, this fic isn't abandoned!

    you know how cicadas burrow underground for like 17 years and then only emerge for a bit to reproduce and scream?? that's me, except with writing. and two years instead of 17.

    I won't get too into details on 'where were you?' bc frankly it's not that deep, but bc I'm always curious when other authors emerge from their caves, brief timeline: i got a promotion at my old job, hated it, got a new job and now i like it. now i work in law like i've always wanted. yeehaw.

    I plan on finishing this fic soon-ish since it seems like the manga is also wrapping up—which is crazy because BNHA has been my hyperfixation for like five years. nooo hyperfixation don't reach a narrative conclusion ur so sexy noo.

Chapter Text

Hisashi knew over a dozen languages, but he found himself unable to comprehend what he discovered on WaffPad.

To Tomura’s credit, the boy had tried to warn him. Well, he’d hedged around and carefully avoided explicitly warning Hisashi away from the cursed website, but he had at least voiced a feeble caution.

“Sensei,” he’d muttered, looking down at his dusty red shoes with a still-visibly-cringing expression. “Maybe you shouldn’t…spy on your kid like that.” He paused, then—in a moment of elusive courtesy, which really should have alerted Hisashi to the true danger of the situation—added on to the sentence, “Respectfully.”

Ever a kingpin egomaniac, Hisashi had waved off Tomura’s concerns. “My child is find,” he had stated, navigating swiftly to Izuku’s unveiled WaffPad account. “It’s not like I didn’t spy on him before this, anyway. I always do at least a little spying before entering any situation.”

“A spy…You mean the private investigator, the one with the glass quirk?” Tomura asked, scoffing. “You have that NPC keeping an eye on little brother?”

Ohh, that guy, right. “No, I killed him ages ago,” Hisashi huffed, recalling the murder of whatever-his-name-was with fondness; that worm of an underling hadn’t even intervened when Izuku found himself in mortal peril under a bridge, back when his darling child was a feeble, quirkless middle schooler. “Now that I’m back in Izuku’s life,” Hisashi continued, smiling to himself with pride, “I plan on giving my surveillance that special, personal touch once more. There’s nothing quite as reassuring as keeping one’s eyes on one’s own family.”

Under his breath, Tomura muttered something along the lines of Hisashi “not having eyes, though,” but Hisashi chose to ignore this little bit of ableist insubordination. They were halfway through the week, and he would be spending hours of precious time with his son this weekend. He needed a broader view of Izuku’s interests beyond heroes; he could only spend so much time discussing heroics before he felt the urge crash over him to overthrow society in a wave of fury.

At least that’s how Hisashi felt, anyway. With the heroics drivel he’d seen filling the history of Izuku’s HeroTube account, it was likely his son didn’t share the sentiment. Still. Sweet Izuku was a hero hopeful, but he had to have other interests, right? A well adjusted teen would be interested in a variety of subjects.

Back when he was a teen himself, Hisashi fondly recalled a hyperfixation on military history. He’d watched clips from pre-quirk conflicts with bated breath, and cheered with excitement when the NHK had shakily announced Japan’s entrance into World War III.

(Wow, it had been over a century since the last World War! No wonder things felt a little stale. Maybe Hisashi could bring up the idea of another one to Izuku once he got over the whole ‘saving people’ thing.)

Point being: well adjusted teens had plenty of whims. And Izuku—star student of the best high school in the country—could be nothing less than well adjusted. He was Hisashi’s son, after all. His child was fine.

Tomura’s warnings were sweet (those games must have been working!), but unnecessary. Hisashi clicked on the link his phone provided and took the opportunity to have it read aloud the surely fascinating details of his son’s WaffPad page.

“SmallMight1507 is following one WaffPad account,” his phone faithfully recited in monotone. Tomura grimaced at the username, and Hisashi shared his pain. “SmallMight1507 has posted one story.”

“Oh?” Hisashi smiled, tapping at the link. Izuku was so clever, he was sure any story he had taken the time to write was brilliant. His hero notebooks were wonderful compendiums of analysis, so whatever fiction Izuku was putting out into the world could be nothing less than—

“Sold to All Might,” his phone stated, and Hisashi felt the mental equivalent of being kicked in the solar plexus. His mouth dropped open in horror, but the phone continued: “Chapter 1: My favorite hero bought my contract? I woke up and blinked my forest green eyes, it was my first day at my new job. But it wasn’t just any job, I don’t go to school anymore, I’m 12 years old and I have a contract for hero analysis and All Might bought it! I put on my dark green blazer with white stripes down the side and white gauntlets that—”

Hisashi manually powered down his phone mid sentence. It felt like smothering something to death, which was appropriate, because hearing what Izuku had written felt like he himself was dying. 

Tomura was silent. Hisashi appreciated this; he wasn’t sure what exactly his face was doing, but he was pretty sure if he had eyes they would be crying. Processing what he had heard was taking up all of his profound intellect.

“So this is what Izuku writes about,” he said. His own voice sounded dead, spoken out into the world. Silence rung over the room.

“Izuku is romanticizing child slavery.”

Shuffling awkwardly nearby, Tomura’s gloved fingers scratched swiftly at his neck. “Maybe he was…venting. He writes fucked up stuff, ‘cause he’s always sweet IRL,” he rasped. Even he didn’t sound like he really believed it, but Hisashi appreciated the effort.

“Maybe,” he said to himself. He tried to talk himself into it: “Yes, young boys do tend to create violent drawings, don’t they? I myself would sketch what certain organs might look like if they were pulled outside the body, or I would write my ideas of what exactly it would feel like to push someone down the stairs…”

Tomura nodded, stringy hair flying about his face. “I do—uh, I did stuff like that too,” he hastened to say. “I made Sims that looked like heroes and I drowned them, and I poisoned them or I trapped them in a maze and starved them and shit.” He paused very briefly, then added, “When I was younger, I mean."

With a strained smile, Hisashi nodded along. “Yes…Yes, exactly. I’m sure Izuku was just working through some difficult feelings when he wrote about being bound in contractual servitude to All Might. Perhaps it’s a satire? Maybe he goes on in this story to critique hero society.”

“Maybe,” Tomura reiterated, without enthusiasm.

Hisashi forced himself to turn his phone back on and pull up Izuku’s WaffPad. He braced himself this time, but it couldn’t get any worse.

(He ignored the part of himself hissing in the back of his mind about erotic hero fiction—Izuku was 12 when he made this account.)

Outside of pornographic hero fiction, which he would not consider! , there couldn’t be anything more embarrassing than what Izuku himself had already published. Romanticizing your own indentured child servitude to a hero was about as rough as it could get. Izuku was only following one account, at least, so Hisashi comforted himself with the knowledge that he just needed to click this one link, check this one author, and then he could give up on trying to find out about Izuku’s other possible interests outside of heroes.

He pulled Izuku’s page back up and clicked on the only author he was following.

“XxExplozionMurderGodxX has posted one story,” his phone read. The amount of X’s in that username had Hisashi squinting in confusion. Surely using X’s like that had fallen out of fashion back when he himself was young, well over a hundred years ago? What kind of deranged person was still using an edgy username like that in the age of quirks! His phone provided the painfully obvious answer:

“My name is Dynamight, full name Great Explosion Murder God Dynamight, and I have short blonde hair with spikes and red eyes like fire. I’m not related to All Might (A/N: if you don’t know who he is get the FUCK out yu extra) but i wish i was cause he’s the fucking best. Today I was wearing my black skull t-shirt and my black chain jeans and my black platform boots. Some shitty extras stared at me and i put up my middle finger at them. Then I exploded them with my quirk, and everybody cheered—”

(With dawning horror, Hisashi realized: Izuku genuinely thought Bakugou was cool.)

Hisashi turned off his phone once more, holding his helmeted skull in his hands. “Is this what they’re referring to when they use the expression ‘fatherless behavior?” he muttered to himself, hands clenching. “I always thought that the nuclear family unit was a heteronormative construct, but now…”

“I didn’t think the second one was that bad,” Tomura said. He grumbled something about clothes with skulls on them sounding cool.

That monstrosity. Sounding cool.

No matter how muddled Tomura’s words were, they hovered in the air like a toxic miasma. 

The fact that these two boys he had raised had the same very stupid opinions struck him. Hisashi was forced to confront the impossible.

It was beyond the realm of rational thought, it was a concept he had never truly considered, but…

Could it be that he—the Ruler of the Underworld, the Bastard of Kamino himself—wasn’t an excellent father?

Izuku woke up feeling great.

He hummed to himself in consideration, doing his morning stretches to the soothing background sound of Chill Beats to Relax and Fight Villains To.  

Last night he had fallen asleep restless, palms itchy and senses twitching, but when he woke up, it was to the spontaneous thought that somewhere, for some reason, All For One was suffering.

It was a pleasant, fluttery feeling, he thought. Back twisting, he reached for his toes. The thought that his biodad was dealing with something he hated seemed to come out of nowhere, but quirks were weird, his especially. Besides, it was a harmless enough pleasantry.

The sun was shining, Izuku’s bones were creaking, and somewhere in Japan, All For One faced great adversity.

Izuku had a smile on his face as his body made sounds like crackling cereal. 

He was determinedly not thinking about the ever-encroaching weekend. There were still a couple of days before he had to see his evil father again, over 48 whole hours! That was plenty of time to decide what he was going to do about The Situation (™).

As if in disagreement, the skin of his palms twitched against his dorm carpet. Izuku ignored it. He finished his stretches and plopped onto his bed, grabbing his notebook and pen and treating The Situation (™) like he would any normal quirk analysis.

Thursday, 7am: Palms itching, feels like hands are being extra twitchy? He paused, considering if it was connected or not, then shrugged and added: Possible connection to AFO via quirk? Woke up somehow knowing AFO was feeling really bad about something. Yay! :)

That about summed it up for now, at least, Izuku nodded to himself. He was doing his best to not overthink ( or think too deeply at all, really, nope nuh-uh ) about his new quirk manifesting. On an impulse, feeling maybe a bit too satisfied about knowing that his biodad was suffering for some reason, he pulled out his phone and shot the man a quick text. It was the first time he had contacted the man willingly since he replied to him with a meme.

Things are good on my end! Hope you’re ready for the weekend.

A bit vague, maybe even a tinge threatening, Izuku considered with contentment. He could add  an emoji or something to give an indication about tone, but no. He sent the text as it was; better to let the man stew over the text’s deliberately ambiguous nature.

Before he could talk himself out of it, he also sent an actually warm and friendly morning text to Tomura. The guy really needed any sociability he could get: now that Tomura had started actually opening up to him, Izuku had realized he had an opportunity to make a true difference in the world. He could hold Tomura’s hand (metaphorically, even with those gloves he wasn’t keen on five-finger contact) and show him that Izuku’s way of seeing things was better.

His evil biodad may have spent years indoctrinating Tomura into villain society, but Izuku had the sheer determination of the formerly-quirkless. With the right words, some actual affection, Tomura would melt and be reformed in his scarred and crooked hands.

…Hmm, that almost sounded manipulative, Izuku thought with a frown. He shook his head, stepping into his shoes and out his door, backpack slung over his shoulders. Mephi-chan tottered along behind him.

Tomura had been groomed into hating the world and everyone in it. He was a victim because that way of thinking was wrong.There was nothing manipulative about convincing Tomura not to be a villain. If anything, it was anti-manipulative. It was manipulatisn’t. Manipulativain’t?

“Whatever you’re mumbling to yourself,” Bakugou huffed, “that sounds stupid as shit and those aren’t fucking words.”

Izuku jolted and snapped his mouth shut—he hadn’t even realized he had walked all the way to class and taken his seat. Sure enough, his classmates were shooting him concerned looks out of the corners of their eyes. Izuku smiled back weakly.

“Sorry,” he whispered back to Bakugou. “I’ve just been thinking, is it bad to want to change someone for the better?”

Bakugou frowned, but before he could answer, Aizawa-sensei stepped into the room, and their class stood to bow and begin their morning lecture. It was interesting stuff; they were learning about who to save first in different situations, how to prioritize certain injuries or people depending on the circumstances. With an unpleasant squirm in his stomach, Izuku couldn't help but think it was appropriate.

He wouldn’t be sacrificing anything in his situation, though, right? He anxiously reached to tug at his lip, eye catching on the conspicuous dark spot that had begun to form on him palm.

Maybe it’s just really stubborn dirt, he pretended. Or maybe it’s Blackwhip, and it’s going to wrap over my hand and take over my body like the Black Suit in that one Spiderman comic. Or maybe it’s a growth and I’m going to die of, like, the plague.

He occupied his thoughts with such pleasant (delusional) musings throughout their morning classes. By the time their class headed to lunch, he was out of morbid ideas for what the Not-All-For-One spot in his palm could be. At this point, he mused to himself, he really just needed to give in to the itchiness in his palm and maybe grab a classmate and take their qu —

“Midoriya!” Uraraka called, and Izuku jogged to keep pace with her and the others.

“Sorry,” he said, running a hand through his hair and keeping his palm carefully out of sight. “I’ve just got a lot on my mind.” He fell into his seat at their table like a sad little sack of a boy, which he was.

“Want to talk about it?” Todoroki asked. Izuku bit his lip; he kind of did, but he didn’t want them all to start talking shit again. And also, whenever he was close to Todoroki, his palms seemed to be especially itchy. He wasn’t ready to think about why his new quirk was so eager to grab at Todoroki.

“Well…” he began, and Iida nodded across the lunch table in encouragement. “I’ve got plans this weekend,” he continued, carefully avoiding the fact that he would be in the presence of Japan’s oldest serial killer, “and one of the people I’m meeting with is, er, a hikikomori.”

That was a gentle way of putting it, he figured, but not dishonest. He was pretty sure Tomura could identify computer processors with greater accuracy than he could identify proper human emotions.

Uraraka blinked in confusion. “And..?” she prompted. Was she really going to make him say it? he internally bemoaned.

“And I’m trying to decide if it’s okay to manipulate them into being a kinder and more open person?” he said, voice lilting the statement into a question. Perhaps that would make it sound less contriving.

Iida made a face like his engines were emitting black smog. “Midoriya-kun,” he started, tone firm, “Manipulation is wrong!”

“Is it, though?” Izuku muttered down at his plate.  “Is it always, always wrong?” He stirred his rice despondently. 

You meet one evil supervillain dad, start to manifest one supervillain quirk, and suddenly it seems like moral ambiguity was all around you.

(No wonder Tomura was so messed up.)

Todoroki at least seemed to give the question some thought. “I don’t know,” he answered. “I guess you kind of manipulated me into using my fire at the Sports Festival, and it was for my own good, in the end.”

“I don’t know if I’d consider that manipulating,” Uraraka mused. She tapped at the table, brow furrowed in concern. “Deku-kun, I get that they’re hikikomori, but I think the why you want to change them is the most important part.” She nodded to herself.

Why did Izuku want to change Shigaraki Tomura? There were almost too many ways to answer.

I don’t have a choice , he didn’t say out loud. He didn’t want them—didn’t want anybody —gossiping about how he was going to spend his weekend strolling around a mall with Shigaraki Tomura and All For One. It was bad enough he had to deal with this cruel reality himself.

And really, he did have a choice, it was just…the lesser evil. On the one hand, dealing with Tomura and All For One together—in public, no less!—would be like wrangling the hounds of hell. On the other hand, giving up on Tomura just wasn’t right.

(More importantly: he didn’t want to give up on Tomura because that would mean that his biodad won by default, and Izuku really wanted to win one over the bastard. Tomura was just a means to an end.)

(Oops, don’t think that part too loudly.)

“It’s just the right thing to do,” Izuku said as earnestly as he could muster, which ehh, close enough. His friends smiled at this, though, so clearly it was the correct and heroic answer.

“I don’t think there’s anything wrong with trying to help someone break out of their shell, Deku-kun,” Uraraka said. She flexed her arm to show off her muscles. “I had to break out of mine to get stronger, too!”

Iida nodded. “It isn’t manipulative to show someone that they may have been limiting themselves.” He adjusted his glasses, adding, “Similar to how your display of selflessness at the entrance exam, Midoriya-kun, helped me realize that there was more to a test than simply earning points.”

“I guess I don’t see the harm in showing a shut-in guy around,” Todoroki stated. “I was kind of a shut-in myself.”

Izuku refrained from correcting Todoroki that he hadn’t been a shut-in, he had been groomed and harshly trained by his father into a role as his successor…huh. Izuku reconsidered things for a moment, taking his preconceptions of Todoroki and flipping them around a little, rolling them in the dirt a bit, and adding a bit of blood.

Well. A lot of blood. If you added a lot of blood, he could start to see a few similarities. 

Maybe Izuku was more prepared to talk with Tomura than he thought.
Chapter 20
Summary:

    thank you for the warm welcome back. \(UvU)/ more of this nonsense now. somehow this chapter ended up being all Tomura, which is just fine because I love Tomura. he's so sad (aesthetically), and when he has his longer hair in the manga i just want to brush it and give him sparkly clips and hair ties. he's slept on as a pretty boy and i will stand by that.

Chapter Text

Meanwhile, Tomura was having a crisis.

Him being in a state of crisis wasn’t, strictly speaking, anything new. It was pretty much weekly that Tomura would fly into a Gamer Rage, black out, and come to his senses having dusted one of the low-level NPCs that filled the League of Villain’s ranks.

At this point, the ranks below Inner Circle were starting to look a little thin. Even his own Party was taking some KO’s: there was him, Dabi (a bastard), Toga (Yandere Simulator), Spinner (loser), and Mr. Compress (too gay to function).

“Ah, Mr. Compress was actually taken into custody and placed in Tartarus,” Kurogiri felt the need to reply to Tomura’s ranting. Tomura cut himself off, blinking in surprise.

“The hell? When was he caught?”

“Two months ago,” Kurogiri answered, and he was taking some kind of tone with Tomura. “I had assumed you had noticed, Shigaraki Tomura.”

With a huff, hand rising to scratch at his neck—he couldn’t, the fucking gloves—Tomura stomped away from the bar. “I’ve been busy,” he hissed. “Sensei came back, and I’ve been training to be a good fucking person.”

“Of course,” Kurogiri conceded. There is was, Tomura’s training was already paying off, because Tomura could now identify that tone Kurogiri was using: condescending.

This was why Tomura didn’t fucking count Kurogiri when he was counting his Party. If anything, Kurogiri was a summon. Or a mount. No, he was the pop-up companion that tried to get Tomura to Hey, listen! when Tomura already knew how to play the stupid game.

Except he wasn’t supposed to think of things like NPC underlings being thrown into Tartarus or turning into dust or corpses like playing a game anymore, Tomura reminded himself. People allegedly had “intrinsic value.”

It sounded fake to Tomura, but he could follow new rules.

He stomped up the stairs of the base a little more aggressively than he needed to, slamming to door to Dabi’s room shut for no reason other than whimsy.

“Hey!” came Dabi’s muffled shout from behind the door. Furniture creaked and fabric rustled, and Dabi’s ugly scarred face revealed itself as the bastard threw his door open. He leaned against the door, scanning Tomura with squinty eyes. “You’re throwing a fit, huh. What’s eating you, Leader?”

“I’m not throwing a fit,” Tomura bit out. “Can’t a guy just be angry in his own fucking base?”

Dabi shrugged. Burnt fingers picked idly at a fraying sleeve, ruining his already ruined clothes further. “Don’t need a reason, I guess. Just trying to be a pal. Isn’t that what we’re doing now?”

“Don’t mock me,” Tomura warned, feeling a familiar, itching rage in his hands.

Deferentially, Dabi raised his hands, palms out. “Not trying to. I know you’re doing the whole ‘being friendly’ thing now, just trying to make it easier on you.”

“I don’t need it to be easier.” 

Yes, he did. But he wasn’t telling fucking Dabi of all people that. Like Dabi could relate to family problems. Tomura was pretty sure Dabi crawled out of an ash pit after a ritual involving a shit ton of cigarettes.

With a raised brow, Dabi gave another, careless shrug. “Alright then. Wanna go burn down a building? Or we could go find a hero to stab for a bit, get some frustrations out.”

Ohh, Tomura wanted to—but no, arson was Bad. Stabbing even more Bad, he was pretty sure, although he wasn’t great at this whole ‘morality’ thing, so he could be wrong as far as scaling.

In answer to this obvious attempt at sabotage, Tomura kicked Dabi’s feet out from under him (the bastard stumbled and fell backwards with an indignant, “Hey, hey, c’mon Leader—”), and kicked his door shut again in his stupid, scarred face.

Because, again, Tomura was having a crisis—beyond staffing concerns.

For as long as he could remember, Tomura had delighted in violence and villainy. Nothing relieved the itch (literally) quite like turning an irritating NPC into a pile of dust and collecting cool loot.

Villainy was as much an impulse as it was instinct, for Tomura. That’s just part of what made him such a good party lead.

But since he’d been training at the whole being good thing, Tomura would find himself…hesitating. Hitting pause before initiating combat.

Just yesterday, he’d been preparing for his weekend plans with Little Brother by increasing his training’s difficulty: Tomura had lurked around an Animal Crossing forum and picked a recent poster that didn’t seem completely hopeless. Code in hand, he’d gone to some random loser’s island.

As was his nature, Tomura immediately started to pocket anything valuable he found left lying unsecured. He’d kicked down flowers, antagonized villagers, and hung around the host, scaring away any fish.

True acts of evil. And yet.

The host had just sent sad faces, and kept playing along. Hell, when Tomura had obviously stalled to admire a piece of furniture, the guy had packed it away to give to Tomura, as a gift.

“What do u want from me u npc?” Tomura had furiously typed, baffled and betrayed.

“lol nothing!! just thought you’d like it :) you’re fun, i hope we can hang out again,” the host had replied.

It was beyond Tomura’s comprehension. This random island host was just giving him something cool, despite Tomura’s overt acts of trolling. It was masochism. It was lame, noob behavior. It was…

Something Little Brother would do, Tomura realized in horror. 

After Tomura had left the island, someone actually added to his friend’s list, he had sat there for a while as the sun set, eventually finding himself staring at his idling screen in the dark.

Eventually the screen went dark with inactivity, and his own crusty reflection stared back at him. Tomura stared into his own wide eyes, locked in his own gaze, hypnotized.

No, nonono! he realized in horror, throwing his switch across his room. It fell to his bed with a soft thud, but Tomura was already pacing across the floor. 

Thoughts like these, he chided himself, I can’t afford to have them.

I’m becoming…self-reflective.

A chill ran down his spine. Reflexively, he reached to scratch the itch, but that didn’t work because he was wearing the damn gloves. He growled to himself. Even online gaming wasn’t a relief when, instead of his usually favored environment (VC or loading lobbies, he could really be himself there and threaten everyone), everyone was being nice.  

First Little Brother, now strangers he accidentally befriended in a game, everyone was suddenly wanting to reach out to him. What was changing—was he changing? Was that a good thing, what would Sensei think? He was only supposed to act like a good person, not join the good persons.

This was all too damn much for one guy to deal with on his own. He needed a second opinion.

(Kurogiri didn’t count, he was a literal talking corpse. Dabi was out due to being insufferable. Toga was Toga. Spinner was…well, Tomura wasn’t trying to become less sociable.)

Sensei, then. He may be a villain, but he got married to Inko-san and had a kid and everything! Peak normie behavior. He at least knew how to fake it. 

With a determined stride, Tomura walked upstairs right up to the door to Sensei’s room. His hand only hovered over the door, building up the courage to knock, when he heard his Sensei speaking from further into his room. It was muffled, but it was obvious:

Sensei was talking to his damn phone again.

“Phone, what is the statute of limitations for murder in Shizuoka prefecture?” Sensei was asking. 

In its monotone voice, Sensei’s phone chimed back, “The Japanese Diet abolished the national statute of limitations for murder in 2010.”

“...Hm,” Sensei said. “Damn. That means I can’t tell Izuku about any of those years I spent in Hokkaido...”

Tomura swallowed, hand falling limp like a wilting stem. The door remained un-knocked, and he could hear his Sensei muttering away.

…Tomura would not ask his Sensei about self-reflection actually.

Turns out there were downsides to only really knowing about a handful of people. It had never really come up before for Tomura—it wasn’t like he was going outside all that often outside of grabbing snacks, staking out a mission, or going for a relaxing murder.

Surely, he couldn’t be the only villain dealing with this? 

As much as he hated the name Herotube, Tomura pulled the site up. Why name a video hosting site HeroTube when it hosted literally any kind of videos? Hell, there was tons of pro-villain content on the site!  Despite the inane name, though, it was the biggest video site by far, and Tomura was looking for answers.

(The site VillainHub was out. He wasn’t looking for a self-help demo to turn into a handjob.)

Obviously he’d gotten everything he could out of the games first. He’d accumulated hundreds of hours on Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, and Harvest Moon, so maybe the answer couldn’t be found in his limited repertoire of games. Sensei didn’t plan on unlocking his Steam library until after he’d made “sufficient progress,” whatever that meant, so video tutorials were his next shot. With gloved fingers, he typed in his dubious inquiry:

What does it mean to be self-reflective?

Tens of millions of results stared back at him. Tomura glared. There can’t be this many self-reflective people! he thought, furiously scrolling down the page. If they were really self-reflective, obviously they would’ve become villains like me! Not- not these… smiling normies.

His mouse hovered over a profile by some mogging chad with a beard. One video title was what got his attention, because it was weirdly prescient.

VILLAIN helps out a bullied student…What happens next will SHOCK you!!! NOT CLICKBAIT!!!

“What kind of ominous title is that,” he muttered, considering. It was obviously trash, but…the ‘student’ previewed in the thumbnail had fucking green hair and freckles, just like Little Brother. The villain was wearing all black, a stupid hero society stereotype. (Tomura ignored that he was himself wearing all black.) The villain also had scraggly blue-white hair.

He squinted. Yeah, blueish white hair, and the bullied kid’s looks…”That’s fucking creepy,” he decided, feeling strangely watched. “There isn’t some HeroTuber with a quirk that lets them get character ideas from real people, is there? This is invasive as shit.”

He’d ask Sensei later. Nonetheless, Tomura clicked the video.

For some reason, it seemed to be some kind of skit. Tomura’s skin crawled; he hated plays and skits and farces of all kinds. Just like hero media, it all came off as insincere bullshit, catering to the blindly smiling masses. Still, he persisted in suffering through the video.

This particular channel—Gharrd Man, Tomura noted with disdain—had tens of millions of subscribers, so obviously this jawline-flexing asshole had to know something about being a good person. 

The eerily familiar villain in the video was suspiciously named Shrimpura, he realized in utter horror. Said villain was introduced snacking on shrimp tempura, but there was no denying the similarities.

“What the fuck, what the fuck,” Tomura hissed, hands grasping at his desk. In the obnoxious skit playing out on his screen, the villain Shrimpura turned everything he touched with all five fingers into fried, crispy snacks.

This was uncanny. Surely villains had some kind of licensing protection, or identity protection, right? Could he have Sensei issue some kind of cease and desist?

The skit continued to play on despite Tomura’s increasing dread. Shrimpura bumped into the eponymous bullied hero student, inadvertently saving the latter by threatening to turn the victim’s bully into a human-shaped fried snack. The hero student watched in awe, and the stupid Shrimpura gave the bullied student an obnoxious speech about standing up for yourself.

“I may be a villain,” declared fucking Shrimpura, “but I draw the line at bullying!”

Unnamed hero student burst into tears, green hair and freckles and all. Between overly-emotional, maudlin pleas that it was ‘never too late to be a hero!!’ the hero student somehow got Shrimpura to promise to be his friend.

(Tomura did not draw the line at bullying. He bullied his underlings all the time!)

There was some vague time skip, some more inane dialogue about ‘standing up to bullies!’ and then a big, bullshit reveal.

After standing up to a couple of bullies for the first time, the hero student made some kind of bold declaration to the onlooking crown (why was there always a crowd in this video?) that anyone could be a hero.

“Even a villain,” sniffled the green-haired hero student, then, after a drama pause, “...or the SON of a villain!!!”

There were dramatic gasps from the crowd and everything. Shrimpura was suddenly there, for some reason, and the hero student took the villain’s hand, unafraid of his fried-snack quirk, and promised that he could be a hero.

“After all,” continued the apparently-monologuing-now hero student, “my father…is your boss!!!”

Yet again there were gasps. The bullies all quivered and stuttered out apologies, blithe platitudes about how they had learned their lesson. Shrimpura stared sadly at the hero student, asking, “You’d help even a villain like me?”

“Even you!” cried hero student. “Because when I was being bullied, and you knew nothing about me, you still helped me. That makes you a true hero!”

Shrimpura started crying then, admitting his tragic origin story for all to hear: “When my quirk manifested,” he admitted, “I turned my whole family into fried snacks.”

There was more absurd talking about how standing up for what’s right is what matters, it was never too late to turn your life around, blah blah blah, the hero student turned out to be really rich?? and then, out of nowhere, the channel owner mogged his way onto screen.

“So you see, standing up for yourself and your friends is—”

At this point Tomura closed the tab. He let the silence of the room engulf him for a moment, holding his head in his hands. A glance at the time confirmed that he had indeed wasted almost twenty minutes of his mortal life on the garbage he had just watched.

“That wasn’t helpful,” he grumbled into his palms. Also, talk about unrealistic!

A crybaby hero student turning out to be the secret son of a villain? The hero student ending up befriending the villain, ending up in some kind of redemption plotline?

“Like that would ever happen,” he huffed, shoving himself away from his desk. 

Maybe HeroTube wasn’t where he needed to go for answers, he admitted to himself. He’d been putting it off, because he didn’t want to seem pathetic or anything, but if self-improvement videos weren’t going to help him, he’d have to go to the one person he knew that wasn’t a villain.

Phone in hand, he pulled up his texts with his Little Brother.

They’d been texting back and forth since they’d met at Little Brother’s house for dinner. Mostly, Izuku sent him simple daily greetings, but he’d also ask Tomura about his day. Tomura was careful not to reveal any of his plans for the League—he wasn’t an idiot, he just didn’t put any points into his charisma stat. Still, he’d chat with Little Brother a bit throughout the day, mostly about how he was being a good person, even when idiots made him want to dust them. And video games.

Doublechecking the time, he made sure Little Brother wouldn’t be in class with, ughh, pro hero teachers. It was later in the day, though, and there were only a couple days until he’d meet up with Izuku with Sensei, so he stopped idling at the loading screen and called him.

It rang four times before the line was picked up. “...Er, hello?” the hesitant voice queried. 

“Little Brother,” Tomura answered. It had been a while since he’d properly spoken louder than a mumble, so his voice came out kind of scratchy, and he scowled. He didn’t want to seem pitiful or anything.

There was a squeaky “eep!” sound from Izuku’s end, and a clattering sound like something had been dropped to the floor. This was followed by a “Sorry, sorry!” in Little Brother’s slightly distant voice, before a bit of a rustling.

“Sorry!” Little Brother repeated. He sounded kind of out of breath. “I didn’t mean to drop the phone, you just, er, took me by surprise! And my classmates were all around the common room, so I didn’t want them to hear me replying to you by name or anything, and—”

“It’s fine,” Tomura interrupted, feeling distinctly uncomfortable. “...Did I interrupt you.” It wasn’t exactly a question, because if he had interrupted Little Brother, he would feel like a huge loser and didn’t really want to know.

“No, no, we were just studying! You know how it is, it’s a Thursday, and there’s usually some kind of quiz or surprise test on Friday, so we were just looking stuff over.” In the background, there was the sound of rushing wind, like Little Brother had ran out of whatever room he had been in.

Either way, he could only answer honestly. “I was homeschooled,” he stated. “I don’t know how any of that stuff is.”

(Surprise tests from Sensei usually ended up being painful reminders to always be on his guard and to destroy whatever lied in his path without hesitation. Couldn’t really study for that.)

“...right. Um, sorry.”

There was a painfully awkward stretch of silence. Even Tomura, stunted as he was in social INT points, felt uncomfortable. On Izuku’s end, Tomura heard the click of a closing door. A disturbing, gurgling thump echoed tinnily over the speakers. 

“The hell is that sound?” Tomura couldn’t help but ask. It sounded like a clogged drain bubbling for help in morse code.

“That’s Mephi-chan,” Izuku sighed. Right, the nomu, Tomura remembered. Why Izuku had bothered to name it in the first place, he didn’t really understand; Tomura always just ordered the nomu around and in general treated them like sentient blunt weapons.

His stomach squirmed a bit, for reasons he didn’t really understand. What the hell was this wiggly, uncomfortable feeling he kept getting, and why was he feeling this way when he was just reminiscing about the various nomu he had commanded over the years?

“Why’d you name it?” he blurted, then grimaced. Ugh, he was meaning to ask about this whole self-reflection thing, but that ugly stomach feeling, like after he had trashed the island of that random normie on Animal Crossing…it had to be connected.

“Hm? I mentioned it when you were over at dinner. Mephi-chan is short for Mephistopheles, and that name comes from—”

“The demon,” Tomura interrupted, “I remember, Little Brother. I’m not stupid, I just didn’t max out any points in looksmaxing.”

There was a moment of silence, in which the only thing Tomura could hear was his own embarrassed heartbeat (he wasn’t insecure!) and the dog-like panting of nomu. Finally, Izuku broke the lull, admitting, “I don’t really know what that last part means, but I know you’re not dumb, Tomura-kun.”

Right. Little Brother was nice; he was trying his best even when Tomura kept getting distracted by unpleasant feelings and technicalities. He elaborated, “I know what the name means. I just didn’t get why you bothered naming it.”

“Huh? Of course I named it. It’s following me around, so I have to call it something.”

“I just call all my nomu ‘nomu,’” Tomura said, feeling that stomach-twisting feeling again for some stupid reason. “I don’t see the point in naming them, they’re just summons or equips for my party.”

“Hmm,” Izuku acknowledged. There was a soft thumping sound, like Little Brother had thrown himself down on his own bed or a squishy chair. “I guess it just seems like the right thing to do. I’m responsible for it, so I should give it a name.”

Tomura scowled at the ceiling. “You sound so sure when you say things like that,” he grunted. “Things being ‘the right thing to do.’ I don’t know about things like that. But then, when I said I don’t name my nomu, I got this feeling —”

“Oh,” Izuku started, sounding deeply uncertain, “um. Maybe you should talk to a doctor about that—”

“No! It’s a bad feeling. My stomach gets all twisted up, and it feels like I have worms in my gut,” Tomura hissed. “It’s like embarrassment, but worse. I felt the same way earlier when I was beating up this loser’s village in Animal Crossing. It’s a new feeling, and I don’t like it at all.”

“...Ah,” Izuku breathed, and he sounded weirdly enlightened. Good for him, Tomura thought bitterly, all it took was Tomura describing his feelings vaguely and Little Brother seemed to have already figured it out.

Tomura would appreciate it if he could have some of that understanding, because all this confusion was starting to piss him off. And getting pissed off made his quirk prickle at his skin, which made him itchy, and he couldn’t currently itch properly! It wasn’t right.

“Tomura-kun,” Izuku finally said, patient and earnest. “It sounds like what you’re feeling is regret.”

Tomura blinked up at the ceiling in bafflement, absently considering that what Little Brother was saying checked out (based on what Tomura had heard about ‘regret’ in more story-heavy games), but:

“That can’t be right,” Tomura argued.

“I think it is!” Izuku insisted. Now he was sounding excited, for some reason, the absolute hero simp. “Regret, or guilt. You don’t like that you treated someone badly, right? That’s guilt.”

Definitively, Tomura stated, “But I can’t feel guilt. I talked about it with Sensei before—I’m above that. I’m just built different.”

A sigh carried over the phone, tired and expectant all at once. “You’re so…diagnosable.”

Before Tomura could dispute that (there was nothing wrong with him, it was society that…!), Izuku adopted a lecturing tone that was very reminiscent of Sensei explaining a new venture.

“Guilt and regret are normal parts of the human experience, and you are not immune to propaganda, so let’s start there…”
Chapter 21
Notes:

    a little later than i'd like, especially bc the manga is going to end like...literally any week now 😬😬 but let's not think about that or i'll go insane. i had an anime convention, which meant prep. then the convention. and then, inevitably, i got sick after the convention. 💀 the fumes and b.o. at cons always manages to make me sick lmao.

    adulthood is cool because i spent over $100 on a Tomura figure. it's going to go on my professional work desk, in the criminal law office i work in, so everyone can reflect on the tru victims of the justice system. 😔 #deep

Chapter Text

For the sake of not starting another hashtag scenario, Izuku didn’t wear any particularly branded t-shirts to his outing on Saturday.

He woke up much like he usually did: anxious for no apparent reason and ready to cry a little bit about it. But then he remembered why he had had trouble sleeping, and why he had set an alarm on a Saturday, and then he had a good reason to cry.

Thus, he cried. So his Saturday morning was off to a pretty typical start, for him.

He’d stuck to his usual outfit for a day off; he had on a plain, striped green t-shirt with the words ‘Special Occasion’ across the front, shorts, and his by-now iconic red sneakers. Mephi-chan’s disguise (because apparently it wouldn’t leave his side even when he was headed out to meet with All For One directly) was a bucket hat. It was large enough to fit over its misshapen head comfortably, hanging low enough to obscure the worst of Mephi-chan’s…unique features.

It also had cute bunnies printed all over it. Yaomomo had presented it to Izuku without a word when he’d mentioned needing more items with which to hide the hideous face of his nomu, and Izuku wasn’t going to look a gift nomu in the mouth.

(Well, he’d already looked his gifted nomu in the mouth, when he was conducting his initial, thorough examination, and he had been stunned to find that his nomu’s dental health was absolutely pristine.

Why his supervillain father perfected the oral hygiene of an undead abomination…Izuku hadn’t dared to ask.)

Overhead announcements chimed out across the train, and Izuku couldn’t help but jump. Under his seat, Mephi-chan gurgle barked, and Izuku fidgeted with his backpack straps. A blessedly normal looking businessman across the traincar shot Izuku a look, probably because jumping at perfectly normal train announcements was suspicious as hell.

Why was he so jumpy, anyway? The restless sleep he’d managed hadn’t truly helped, he supposed, forcing himself to slum back against his seat.

Sorry, Mr. Salaryman Man, I’m a teen with anxiety going to meet my evil dad and hero incel brother, he tried to communicate across the train silently, hoping for both patience and to be ignored. But don’t worry about me…please worry about me, I’m very worried about me.

“No corpses today,” Izuku muttered quietly to himself. “If we all stay calm, no one will die.”

The nameless business man seemed to hear this pep talk (maybe a hearing quirk?). Gray eyes shot a deeply concerned, slightly disgusted look in Izuku’s direction, and the suited man shuffled away out of the train car.

It might have been unrelated to the pep talk, Izuku reasoned. There was nothing wrong with wanting to prevent corpses! That was the default state!

The train rattled along around him, scattered passengers carrying on heedless of Izuku’s silent frustrations. Now that the business man had fled, his gaze caught on a prominent, spiky tail poking out from an older man’s coat. 

Izuku’s palms itched. He pointedly ignored this, just as he ignored the fact that his palms got more twitchy whenever his eyes lingered too long on anyone with a particularly visible, interesting quirk.

There were many things that could mean, but Izuku was currently blocking out the part of his brain the thrived on analyzing quirks. It didn’t have to mean anything, after all. 

Izuku was pretty sure it wasn’t the itchy hands that had kept him up, anyway. There was the normal dread, and there was the bonus dread from having to entertain his biodad today, but there had been something else.

Brows furrowing up, Izuku stopped glancing about the traincar and tried to remember what exactly he’d been dreaming about…ah. That was it, he remembered suddenly. That fogginess, the hazy darkness: he’d had another insight into One For All. It was slowly starting to come back to him, but why had he seemingly forgotten the dream in the first place…

Black haze drifted across Izuku’s line of sight. The horizon, always out of reach, blurred slightly, and an indistinct figure walked steadily toward him. The person was slight, walked with just a bit of a limp, and had shaggy hair.

Izuku shook his head, dispelling the fog covering his mouth. He’d been able to speak last time, so he gave it a shot once more. “First!” he called out.

As if in answer, the figure clarified before him. Yoichi looked as unassuming as always, kind of gangly and a bit freckly and fluffy hair and all, and wait a minute, was he only now realizing—

Yoichi smiled down at Izuku, ruffling his hair. “Admiring the similarities?” he teased. He reached a hand up to tap at his own cheeks. “They’re not very visible—I was usually too sick to go outside much—but I have freckles, too!”

Izuku smiled as much as he could at the reminder of his heritage, which ended up being a sort of watery grimace. Yoichi’s hand in his hair turned into a comforting pat.

“Hey now,” Yoichi chided. “Don’t go getting upset about it again. I was just pointing out some family similarities. Being related to Hisashi doesn’t have to be all bad!”

Sniffling a bit, Izuku nodded. “I know,” he agreed. “It’s only mostly bad. Like 95% bad, I think.”

“Right,” Yoichi stated, sounding a bit strained himself. “There are plenty of good things about our family line.”

For a few agonizing moments, Izuku and Yoichi stood there in infinite space, unable to think of good things about their family tree. Yoichi even opened his mouth a couple times, only to hesitate and say nothing. It was awkward.

Yikes, Izuku thought.

A blessedly welcome voice hollered a greeting (‘ Heyooo!’) from the indistinct shade around them, and a muscular woman came tumbling into view. Seven staggered a bit against Yoichi, who stumbled forward and nearly fell to the ground. “I heard the word family!” Nana said, voice carrying in a sing-song. “If we’re talking about the All For One mom issues again—!”

“We’re not!” Izuku interrupted, hands clapping to cover his ears. “Not ever again!”

Nana sighed, drawn out and exaggerated, shrugging her (very impressive) shoulders and raising her hands in surrender. “Alright, only teasing you,” she said, smile growing. She reached out and forced Izuku’s hands down from their defensive position. “Teasing, teasing! Besides, I heard you guys talking about your father.”

Guiltily, Izuku shuffled in place. He fidgeted with his hands, admitting, “The looks don’t bother me so much—I look more like First than my dad, really—but. The quirk…”

Yoichi smiled sadly down at him. Nana gave a curt nod, hands going to her hips. “We felt it happening, when you were sparring with the annoying, fire-ice handsome kid,” she said. “You really have manifested All For One, huh?”

Miserably, Izuku nodded down toward the floor. There was a huff, and four arms curled around him in a loose hug. First and Seven cooed some commiserating sounds at him, and for a timeless moment in the fuzzy space of One For All, Izuku let himself wallow in teenage misery.

Finally, Yoichi broke the silence. “If it’s any consolation, you’re doing a lot better than when my brother manifested his quirk.”

“I am? I mean, I haven’t used it at all.”

Yoichi pulled back from the hug, hand going to tap at his lower face. “Exactly. Much better than when Hisashi manifested All For One.”

Izuku stood patiently, looking up at Yoichi with wide, beguiling eyes. Mouth crinkling into an awkward, placating smile, Yoichi shook his head. “No, I won’t get too into it now,” he defended. “You should really get the details on how the use the quirk from Hisashi, as much as it pains me to say it.”

“Advice?” Izuku asked, disgusted. “From All For One?”

Nana looked solemn. “I can’t think of a worse person to ask for advice about anything.” She paused for a moment, and Izuku wondered what she might add to that, but she ended up just clarifying: “I can’t think of a worse person.”

The elaboration was shorter than her initial statement, but she was so, so right. 

With a huff, Yoichi put his hands on his hips. It was Nana’s favorite power pose, but when Yoichi tried it, he ended up looking like a skinny puppy. “I know my brother isn’t a good person, by any stretch of the definition—”

“Sometimes I don’t think he’s much of a person at all,” Izuku agreed.

“—but if he knows anything, it’s quirks,” Yoichi finished, nodding definitively. “Just talk to him about it. At least if you talk about quirks, you won’t have to talk about what he’s been reading online.”

Blinking in confusion, Izuku and Nana both turned to Yoichi. He waved his hands defensively, rushing to add, “Don’t look at me like that! It’s not like I can see Hisashi all the time, it’s just, when you’re a vengeful ghost, sometimes you stalk your family!”

Izuku nodded. If he died, he would stalk his biodad for sure: if he scared him badly enough, he could maybe give the man a heart attack. Or maybe he could use some kind of ghostly, One For All-fuelled ESP and rip the man’s mask off in his sleep. Maybe he’d suffocate!

However he could manage it, Izuku could end up being the first hero to take down a villain from beyond the grave!

This was obviously a very fun and interesting idea, so he shared it with his comrades. 

The dropping expressions of concern did not inspire confidence, but something else did. Right before Izuku woke up, a third figure seemed to begin to materialize in the fog: right behind Yoichi was a taller, broader male figure with pointy hair, but Izuku’s alarm blared before he could even see his face.

Right, Izuku thought, arms coming up to cover his face in embarrassment. He had made a fool of himself in his One For All dreams in front of two of his incredible predecessors. No big deal, he told himself. 

Clattering and overhead announcements from the train were mercifully loud. Hopefully it would cover his muttering. “It wasn’t that bad…” he mumbled to himself, words garbled by his shielding arms.

To think, he had suggested that he would have to wait to die to commit his first murder! What happened to going plus ultra? What happened to using one million percent of One For All and blasting a villain into a mountain?

What happened to breaking his actual, literal limbs just to prove a point?

No one was going to die with that defeatist attitude.

“I could kill him whenever I want, if I wanted,” Izuku declared. Shifting himself up a bit from his slouch, he nodded to himself in determination. Yes, that was obviously why the two past One For All holders had looked so profoundly disquieted! 

First and Seventh were already ghosts, after all, but they weren’t quite able to destroy All For One. For them to have to listen to Izuku so boldly declare that he would accomplish as a spirit what they had been unable to achieve as ghosts themselves, when this whole time, he was still alive. With two powerful quirks!

Maybe today was about hanging out with his evil biodad and his indoctrinated brother, but that didn’t mean it was too early to set goals.

“I don’t have to wait ‘til I’m a ghost to kill him!” Izuku reaffirmed. Confidence swelled up in his stomach, and he smiled to himself; it felt a lot like when he first used Full Cowl successfully. Self confidence, such a rare thing prior to these past few months, surged up within him. 

(So entirely focused on his pronouncements, Izuku failed to notice the side eyes and hushed whimpers from the other occupants of the train car. The pedestrians around him carefully inches their way out of the car.)

For a good half hour, Izuku cheered himself on. He reminded himself that he was a hero student, so that meant that fighting and stopping villains was a good, moral thing for him to do, whenever. He had his license and everything. 

Maybe the past One For All users were a little hesitant about killing. Izuku could get that—he reminded himself that All For One was Hisashi, his biodad, and his mom would probably be upset if Izuku full-on brought him home as a corpse.

There were other ways to stop him. He couldn’t think of any right now, given that even All Might himself had failed to completely defeat All For One even when bashing his head into the ground, but there had to be something. Izuku was clever.

“I could beat him,” he whispered to himself, despite the train car being almost entirely empty.

There was one person left, lingering out of the corner of his eye, slouched over on a seat just a few spots away from him. The stranger didn’t seem put off by Izuku’s affirmations at all. Actually, they scooted closer, leaning in.

“Psst, kid,” the stranger said. “Heard you monologuing about destroying All For One. It’s about time you figured out that violence was the answer.”

Izuku startled, flying around to face this person who should not know that. “What—who—”

The (very handsome) stranger straightened out of slouch, orange hair sticking out in a spiky puff, and it was only now that Izuku realized that he was blurred around the edges, slightly fuzzily fading into the seat. Wait, that meant this was…

“You’re one of the former One For All—” he cut himself off abruptly, before looking around and realizing that, huh, the train car had emptied out at some point. Had he missed the last stop somehow…?

“You didn’t miss your stop. You just creeped everyone out enough that they left. You secured the premise,” the man declared. He nodded, mouth almost smiling from its permanent grimace. “Good strategy. I’m the Second. Kudou.”

Izuku noticed he was gaping a bit, but he couldn’t help it; between his brusque manner of speaking, muscular folded arms, and the dramatic scar across his face, Kudou was cool.

“Wow,” he said breathily. Then he shook himself: he couldn’t look lame in front of this really cool previous holder. “Why are you showing yourself now?” he asked. 

“You weren’t ready before,” Kudou answered. The rushing countryside out the window was just slightly visible through Kudou, bringing him into vibrant colors. Between his spooky form and his intense stare, Kudou’s aura was kind of intimidating.

“Wow,” Izuku said stupidly. Then added, “Oh, wait, what’s your quirk? Why am I ready now?” He was still training, of course, just like always, but if anything he wasn’t doing quite as much robust high intensity interval training as before all this drama with his dad(s) started taking up so much time. 

If a new quirk was finally revealing itself, it could have picked a better time, frankly. Izuku was already handling a new quirk, so he kind of had his hands full.

(Full of holes, because y’know, it was All For One.)

Kudou shifted backward, leaning his hands behind his head and staring out the window. “Gearshift. Don’t worry about the quirk.”

“...Oh. Um, okay—?”

“ —I showed up now because you’re ready,” Kudou said, somewhat dubiously. “Before this last week or so, you were too… smiley.”

Izuku forced his face not to awkwardly smile. “What’s wrong with that?” he asked weakly. “All Might is always smiling, it makes people feel safe…”

He trailed off, suddenly uncertain when Kudou scoffed, shaking his head and bringing one of his hands down to Izuku’s shoulder. “I’m the Second,” Kudou stated. It sounded like an explanation in itself, and Izuku rapidly cycled through the historical implications of what being the Second One For All user must have meant.

“There ya go,” Kudou added, nodding agreeably at Izuku’s thoughtful frown. “That’s the mastermind you have, deep down under all the industry shit you’ve internalized. Let that go. Focus on your core.”

Izuku’s core muscles were pretty well defined at this point, but—

“You’re thinking something stupid,” Kudou barked, jabbing a figure at Izuku’s chest. “Your core, your heart! Control your heart!”

“I’m controlling my heart!” Izuku blurted, nodding furiously and maintaining the stern face Kudou had complimented before. “Kudou-san, please elaborate what it means to be the Second!”

With another nod, Kudou leaned back against his seat once more, ghostly outline flickering. “I was part of a revolutionary, liberation group. I was a solider. We were the first ones to really fight back against All For One’s reign of tyranny, and it meant every day was kill or be killed.”

“Wow…” Izuku breathed, unable to uphold a stern demeanor is the wake of such an introduction. “Is that how you received One For All? What does that have to do with me being ready?”

“One question at a time,” Kudou replied. “You let your mouth run ahead of that clever mind of yours. My being a solider was how I got One For All, but only because it’s how I met First.”

This time, when Kudou paused, Izuku sat patiently still, and Kudou dipped his head in approval. “It was a reckless mission. Initially, I was planning on killing All For One’s hidden treasure, whatever it was. But then I broke into his base, and it turns out his treasure was Yoichi. So I ended up kissing him instead.”

Izuku was now much more confused about the moral of this tale, but he nodded along unflinchingly. He would get to it. Probably.

“Yoichi was so damn pathetic. Stubborn but cute. Puny, but strong. He had this stupid, messy hair that kept flopping into his face, like one of those dogs with the long bangs—”

Izuku was sure he would get to the moral soon???

“—so anyway I busted him out of All For One’s base. Probably killed a few dozen men that day. It wasn’t ‘til after Yoichi was gone that I realized he’d passed the quirk to me when we were making out. There was blood everywhere.”

There was an ethical or logical reasoning to be sharing this information, Izuku was sure. Rapid fluctuations between romantic declarations and battlefield statistics were difficult to put together as anything other than a sort of horrifying collage. 

“—His hand was dismembered. And then Yoichi died, two months later.” Mercifully, Kudou stopped there, gazing pensively out the train car window.

Izuku was glad he paused, because he was stuck on that whole two months bit. Two months?! This whole time he had been mentally mapping out a grand war timeline, intertwined with a tale of starcrossed lovers, and Kudou had only spent two months with Yoichi?

Was this what his peers meant by trauma dumping?

“So, that’s why I waited ‘til you were ready.” Kudou’s voice startled Izuku out of his thoughts, and he looked up and jumped a bit in his seat, because Kudou’s face was right there, intense eyes staring straight through him. “I wasn’t impressed before. But ever since you started manifesting All For One, you’re different.”

“I’m not- different,” Izuku protested, shifting a bit uncomfortably. “It’s just a new quirk.”

“It’s not about the quirks,” Kudou argued, moving somehow more into Izuku’s personal space. Izuku was torn between being intimidated and admiring, because dang, how was Kudou so brazenly cool. “It’s about your heart.”

Briefly, Izuku tried and failed to come to a solid conclusion. “If anything,” he muttered, shifting uncomfortably and staring at his lap, “I’ve been, um. Meaner.”

“Exactly.”

The sharp words his Izuku looking back up again into Kudou’s face. It was still too close, but Kudou charged onward: “You want to save everyone, right Izuku? Things are feeling a little confusing, a little ambiguous?”

“Yes,” Izuku agreed, glad somebody got it. Even though this somebody was a ghostly manifestation from his quirk, it counted. 

“Learn from my own story. Control your heart.”

“I will!” Izuku promised. Kudou nodded, imparting some final knowledge before the edges of his ghostly projection faded into the street car seats:

“Peace was never an option, Izuku. Aren’t you tired of being nice? Don’t you just want to go apeshit?”

Yeah, Izuku realized. You know what, he was tired of being nice. 

Maybe he did want to go apeshit.
