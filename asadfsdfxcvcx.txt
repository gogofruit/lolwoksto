Peter the Pizza Guy
Irisen
Summary:

    Strange’s second spell does not have anything to do with memory. Maybe Peter should have expected it, as the previous one acted in the same way.
    Instead of erasing the memories of the ones he loves across the world, the incantation plucked him from his universe, erasing all traces of his existence, and threw him into a new one.
    Now seventeen, having lost his family and friends, he finds himself in a strange world, alone in one of the most dangerous cities across all dimensions.

     

    Or : Peter needs money to survive Gotham and picks up a pizza delivery job.

     

    Spider-Man/DCU (Specifically Batman) Crossover

     

    Do not repost to monetized websites like webnovel

Notes:

    Inspired by Dark Matter by mysterycyclone
    Inspired by Spiderhead by emmacortana

    The idea of Peter ending up in Gotham was straight up taken from Dark Matter by mysterycyclone, which is a great ongoing fic series that you should definitely go read right now.
    Despite the base idea being the same, I’m planning on going a different way with characterization, plot and relationship between characters so definitely go and read it all because it’s worth it :)

    I also added Spiderhead which while not a direct inspiration is a cool story set in a Spider-Man/Batman crossover (Dark Matter specifically) so I just put it there for people to read it because it’s great!

(See the end of the work for other works inspired by this one.)
Chapter 1: Lost and alone
Chapter Text

Doctor Strange (Stephen, Peter corrected himself mentally) had warned him about the consequences of the spell, about how he had just signed up to erase his own existence from the world, making everyone he ever knew and loved forget about it.

He did warn him.

Peter, however, assumed the spell would affect the memory of the people who knew of him, not shift reality itself in the way it seemed to have done.

He sighed and set down the newspaper he had been flipping through. Gotham Gazette, it was called. He had found it close to the place where he had landed, a few heartbeats after he got to tell his last goodbyes. It was soaking in a puddle of filthy water, abandoned. The mud made it hard for him to read anything but the bigger prints.

Gotham Gazette, he read at the top. He had never heard of a town called Gotham before.

After climbing on top of the nearest buildings, he had confirmed his suspicions. The city appeared to be extremely large, perhaps even on the scale of New York itself. Unlike New York, though, there was a sense of unease floating in the air. A tension he was not used to.

Now, Peter was not a slacker. He had spent most of the last year studying for entrance exams and interviews and the map of the United States was something he had memorized in details several times over the year. There was no city of this size named Gotham.

Maybe the newspaper was using an odd name. However, something in him, a slight tingle of a feeling, told him it was not the case. 
After all, he had just been through a multiverse convergence, proving once and for all that there were plenty of parallel universes.

He almost felt like cursing, crouching at the top of the dilapidated building. The previous version of the spell had not affected memories, it had affected reality. Of course something that was derived from it would have similar effects.

Now was the real question : Did he get transported to another universe, one where Peter Parker did not exist, or did the spell change the world he already was in in such a severe way that he ended up in a strange, alternate version of New York City?

He could have kept wondering about it for a while but, quickly, the weight of his situation dawned on him. He was alone, in a town he had never been in before, one that made his Spider-sense scream with unease. This was not good.

He bit back the anxiety and the fear, buried it in the same place he buried his grief and his despair, both results of the past few days’ events. He needed to focus, to prioritize.

He shivered. He was still wearing his Iron-Spider suit, without its mask. The think was offline, metallic parts uncomfortably heavy against his skin. He had a few cracked ribs from the fight earlier. His head was throbbing.

First thing first, he centered himself. He had to find shelter and food. He needed a lot of energy, ever since he started developing his powers.
Thankfully for his odds of being picked up by child protective services while looking for food, Peter was fully aware of the way his body had changed in the last few years. His face was now a lot more mature, his chest broader, and he was slowly gaining a few inches every couple months.

On top that, he might have only turned seventeen a few months ago, but he had shouldered plenty of responsibility and knew how to act grown enough that he thought he shouldn’t have any problems looking like an adult.

At least, he hoped so.

Food and shelter first, he decided, nodding to himself.

He rose to his feet, clenching his fists.

A feeling of unease had not left him since he appeared into the city so he decided to keep his travelling to the roofs. It was a good decision anyways : his heightened senses had detected a good dozen or so gunshots around the area, and no police siren. In broad daylight.
In any other circumstances, he would have put his mask on and went to help out but, in this unknown city, he didn’t trust himself to save anyone quite yet.

To be honest, he also was not at the top of his game. His body ached with cuts and bruises and his spirit was completely crushed. The only thing he wanted to do, truly, was lay down and let himself die, but-…

He couldn’t do that to Tony. To May.

To M-J.

Not allowing himself to spiral down a well of grief, he shook his head and started walking, then running, on the roof. Overhead, the sun was barely peaking through the heavy clouds that covered the city’s sky. Pollution, in a way, but he could also smell salt in the air, a clear indication that the ocean, or at least the sea, was not too far away.

He might truly be in an alternate version of New York.

Reaching the end of the roof, Peter leaped, easily closing the few dozen feet that separated the two housing units. To his surprise, despite their broken down appearance, they looked to be inhabited, with laundry hanging from some windows, and the sound of heartbeats coming from inside their walls.

He could relate to such living situations. May had had to go back to school after Ben’s death to be able to support them while still living in New York City. The few years she took getting there had them live in a one bedroom closet of a place, without plumbing or electricity, and, often, without much food.

It had worked out in the end. That was May’s philosophy, making it work, no matter what.

Her death hit him again suddenly and he felt his heart twist. He stopped in the middle of his run and lowered his head. 

It took him a few minutes to get back on track but, after breathing in and out slowly, he eventually calmed himself enough to be able to keep moving. As he jumped, rolled and climbed, he thought about his options. Anything to avoid remembering what had happened earlier today, anything.

He eventually reached a larger street, after a good thirty minutes of travelling through one of the poorest districts he had seen in a while. It reminded him a bit of New York post invasion, people carrying weapons everywhere they went, burning vehicles and walls marred by signs of fire and gun fights.

No alien influence there, just a very, very dangerous area.

He frowned. At least Stephen dropped him somewhere where, once he got his bearings, he could be of some help. The people here looked downtrodden, lifeless.

He sat above them for a while. It was the afternoon, he thought, but this city was terribly cold. It must be winter, then. The air was heavy and wet, wind wrapping around him, slowly wearing him down.

He needed something to wear that was not his Spider suit. In fact, he probably needed to take a serious look at his suit. Ever since he had been sent to this strange reality, it had been offline, unable to be powered back on.

Peter drew closer to the edge of the building he was on, peering down into the street. The people there looked like humans, regular ones. Various skin tones and body shapes but, when he focused on individual conversations, he could clearly make out an American accent. Not a New York one, though, but still noticeably East Coast.

He threw a glance at the few crumpled up bills he kept in his suit in case he ever felt hungry while on patrol. They were all ones, most of them picked up at the top of buildings, carried by the wind. It couldn’t be this easy, right? This was another reality, the bills wouldn’t be the same.

But he had been able to identify the accent, maybe the face on the bill wouldn’t be so different that they wouldn’t recognize it. Washington had stayed on there throughout the years, after all, despite all new Super Hero bills introduced in the recent years.

He would lose nothing attempting it.

He counted out all the money he had. Eleven dollars. He sighed. This was… not going to carry him long.

He needed to find a way to make money. A way that would not require him to provide valid government ID or a work history. Or have him be asked too closely about his age.

Crap, was Spider-Man going to have to turn to a life of crime to makes ends meet?

He chuckled awkwardly. No, there were other ways to make money.

His choice made, he stealthily climbed down from his spot, blending into the shadows of a nearby back alley. People around him did a double take when he joined the larger streets in search of a second hand clothing store but, after a few surprised looks, all of them went their own way.

Spider-Man obviously was not a thing here.

He felt odd, walking around in his vigilante get up, even though he had put on the mask before stepping into the street. He couldn’t simply show up to a store naked, after all, and this area of town, where all of the stores where, looked like it had less secluded areas to jump down into.

Still feeling extremely embarrassed, Peter ducked into the first thrift store he saw. His budget was so low he immediately went for the "1$/item" bin. In it, he found an alarmingly large number of bloodstained clothes and also, thankfully, a grey dress shirt that, while too big for him and quite unsightly, looked clean and in good condition.

Alright. Ten dollars left.

He had no budget to buy himself new shoes, so he would have to stick with the spider boots. He did, however, find a pair of shorts that fit him inside of the bin, as well as a ratty scarf and another, large nondescript black shirt.

Not what he would usually choose for winter but he had to work with the tools he was given. The shop keeper sneered at him when he went to pay, evidently taking him for some kind of troublemaker because of his outfit. The state of the bills he handed them probably did not help either.

Peter scampered out and then back into the shadows to change into the black shirt. He should probably be cleaning them but his enhanced sense of smell allowed him to know that at least they had been washed before being brought to the shop. This has not been the case for several of the other items he had looked through back in there.

Gross.

The shorts, scarf and t-shirt at least helped take some of the edge off of the wind and cold weather. He wore it over his suit, of course, not reckless enough to leave the thing out in a new, unknown city.

It still surprised him, that his money had been accepted at the store. The man had looked at it closely, before giving it a pass. Of all things that stayed no matter what side of reality he was in, Dollar bills were apparently part of it. At least the ones.

And now he was left with 9 dollars.

He sighed, already knowing he was about to spend a very, very long night getting settled in this weird city. Since he had left the store, the sun had started going down, and he still hadn’t found food or shelter.

Giving up on finding any other way to scavenge for food, Peter resigned himself to spending the rest on his money on a lighter and four cans of food. Half of it was peaches, the other pasta.

He had to eat it cold, with his bare hands, sitting at the top of a large bridge as the night settled. The spot, at least, was beautiful, letting him see most of the city. It had been quite easy, sneaking up there. Most of the police officers he had seen down there had looked troubled. He could hear some of them talking, when the wind carried their voices up enough. Something about a break-out.

He licked his finger clean of peach juice. Keeping his mind busy helped with the seemingly every present emptiness in his chest, he tried his best to keep his thoughts from wandering there. It was hard, though.

Peter felt his stomach twist at the memories that washed over him. His hands were shaking. 
No. He reminded himself. He didn’t have enough food to waste it by vomiting. His eyes burning with tears that he knew would come out soon enough, he finished the rest of the can. It tasted too sweet, too slimy. 
He want to spit it out and scream. He wanted to curl up and let the cold take him.

Instead, he put the rest of the cans in the grey dress shirt, then folded it into a makeshift bag that he tied to his waist. Coming that high up had allowed him to watch the city as he ate, appreciating how big it truly was, but the cold was getting to him quickly. 
Peter easily made his way down, sticking to the bottom of the bridge to avoid being spotted. Spider-people were  apparently not a thing in this universe, nobody even glanced in his direction as he slid down.

By the time he reached the street and the homeless camps under the bridge, night had fully fallen upon Gotham. Despite not having a place to stay himself, and no money to pay for a room, he could not stay there. He did not have anyone to introduce him to the camp members and, at his age and wearing this kind of oversized clothes, he could be mistaken for a minor.

He sighed when he remembered that, technically, he was indeed a minor.

Fighting universe-ending threats yearly sometimes made him forgot that.

He crawled up what looked like a half finished tower whose construction had been halted for a reason he couldn’t figure out. From there, he jumped to another, lived in tower, then down to a smaller, square building.

To his surprise, even the most dilapidated of buildings in this part of town appeared habited, either by full on families or by groups of men and women, most of them wearing weapons, some of them using drugs.

People live in those? He thought, horrified. Once again, he was reminded of the post-invasion crisis. It hit close to home.

Eventually, he found himself a spot to spend the night in, under the roof of yet another broken down housing unit. Only a few humans lived in this one, and they were all on the lower floors. The basement was crawling with rats, he could hear them running around.

Peter laid there, looking at the night sky through the broken window he had climbed through, his head resting on the folded up grey shirt. His three remaining cans of food were lined up neatly next to him, his lighter safely stored in the shorts’ pockets.

He closed his eyes.

A face flashed in his mind, he could smell burning, blood. 
Slowly, he could feel himself sliding into despair.

 

He did not realize that he was falling asleep, having chosen to deal with his grief by looking at the few stars visible through the haze of pollution. He did, however, wake up in the morning, feeling as exhausted as he did when he laid down in the first place.

He did not eat, instead packing up his few belongings and making his way to an even higher point. The sun was barely starting to peak out from behind the Gotham skyline, he had not slept long.

He couldn’t imagine laying back there again, images of his loved ones haunting his mind. The tiredness he felt was, anyways, deep bone. A few more hours of sleep would not help.

"Today…" he promised himself "I find a job"

That goal in mind, he jumped down, his makeshift bag hitting his hips as he landed in a crouch and sprung back up, latching onto a wall and crawling up it. He had a lot of recon to do.

Surprisingly, it was not hard to find a hiring agency. Considering the looks of the city, or at least the parts he had visited so far, he’d have thoughts those were a far concern for its inhabitants but apparently, no matter how troubled a town was, people still needed to find jobs and pay rent.

This one, Peter noticed, was not one he had heard of before. Probably a product of the reality shift Stephen had caused, he thought. 

SOUTH GOTHAM JOB AGENCY

Sponsored by the Wayne Foundation


Peter had never been into a place like this for himself, but he had on occasions accompanied May to some, back before she got her degree. He knew how they worked, vaguely, and hoped that he would not have to provide any paperwork to prove his identity to the agent.

If he did, he had no idea how he would be able to make money legally, his experience of job searching was as blank as he felt emotionally right now.

With a sigh, he pushed the door and stepped in. The place smelled like tobacco and coffee. Despite the nice furniture and the gun-carrying security guard at the entrance, it was completely empty, the only other living being a bored looking employee, sitting alone in the center of the large room.

Whoever or whatever the Wayne Foundation was, it was losing money funding this thing. Obviously not a lot of people used it.

Then, it was barely eight in the morning, the place had opened recently. Maybe he should give them more credit…

Peter stepped forward, shifting uneasily when the employee gave him a dubious look-over, raising an eyebrow at his choice of shoes in particular. He was aware that his suit went up to his neck, and that also earned him an unimpressed glance.

"Looking for work?” The employee asked, looking terribly bored. Her tag read "Mary", her hair was frizzy and dark, she looked exhausted.
Why did everyone in this town look so tired?

"Yes ma’am" He nodded, eager to please. If she liked him, maybe she’d let him get something even if he didn’t give her papers.

"I…" she started "… am not even going to ask how old you are. I guess it’s our job to keep kids like you away from the gangs."

Peter frowned at that, but didn’t say anything. The older woman bent down and retrieved something from one of her desk’s bottom drawers, handing it to him. 
A sheet of paper, covered in small print writing. Lists of names and phone numbers.

"All of those places will let you work for a commission." She explained. "Won’t ask questions. I can’t give you a contract without seeing your papers."

Peter grimaced at that, which made her nod, as if she had been expecting all along that he could not provide any identification.

Gratefully, he picked up the sheet, rising up to leave. As he did so, the door jingled and a young woman walked in. He left as she went up to the counter.

Maybe the agency was not a complete waste of money, then.

He stepped out into the morning sun. The clouds had parted today, but Peter was still shivering. The air was so humid that every gust of wind felt like a blast of ice water right onto his face. He grimaced, even without rain, the place made him feel soaked and cold.

After he figured something out for permanent shelter, he would need to get himself new clothes. The air was not freezing enough for January, it must be early December, still into Autumn, then.

As he started walking away, staring at the list in his hands, at the foreign names on it, he was suddenly struck by a deep wave of despair.

This time, he had truly no way home. That was what Stephen had said. They would all forget. No one could remember who he was, back there, no one would be looking for him.

He shook his head. He couldn’t think about it for now, he has to focus on survival. Then, when he was settled, maybe then he could…

Maybe then he could think about May and everyone else he had to leave behind.
Chapter 2: Strange city, lonely boy
Summary:

    Peter gets a shady job in a shady way.

Chapter Text

The shower had to be short, before anyone wondered why someone was using it when the gym had just opened. Peter was not even supposed to be in there, he had no money for the membership but had snuck in through an open window on the second floor. Climbing down from the employee level to the main gym floor had been easy, as long as he stuck to the ceiling and avoided cameras.

He dried his hair as best as he could without a towel and, for a second, considered putting his clothes under the water spray. They were not smelly yet, but there were several stains on them from the place he slept in the night before.

Then, he remembered the wind, the humidity and the cold that was waiting for him outside of the gym and he decided to keep his clothes away from any more moisture.

He did, however, wash his underwear and socks thoroughly. Those, he would not buy more of at a thrift store so he had to be responsible.

It reminded him of his childhood, scrubbing clothes in the sinks of emergency public bathrooms, after the invasion. Back then, it had seemed hard, that way of living with May. Now, though, he would give anything to go back to those days. He would have no powers, no responsibilities and, more than anything, his aunt would still be alive.

Power and responsibility, he could handle. This crushing loneliness, though, was the single most painful thing he had ever been through in his whole life.

Peter had never been as alone as he was now, with no friends and no family to turn to. He was determined to survive it, though, to live on on his own and eventually build himself a new life but…

Trying not to let his mind wander to much lest in land in too dark of a territory, he shook himself and headed out.

He closed the door to the shower room behind him and quickly made his way to the men’s restroom, blessedly empty, à before slithering out of the window. He put his palms flat on the wall and climbed up as fast as he could until he reached the top. Business as usual.

A low whistle, coming from the street below, made him freeze on the spot.

Horrified at the idea of being spotted when he was in such a weak position, Peter whipped back, gazing down into the dazed face of an old man.

Said old man waved happily at him, although his other hand clutched a gun.

"What lab are you from?" He asked Peter conversationally, his gun hand slowly rising, finger shifting to move towards the trigger.

"Hey man-" Peter replied, trying his best to look inoffensive. "We don’t need that gun to get involved, do we?"

The old guy shrugged, scratching his head with his free hand, the other one, however, was still tense, clenched around the weapon.

"This side of town… Not for some freak like you. You’re not welcome here." The friendliness was all but gone from his face, turned into a mask of stone. Hostile, his senses said, not that he needed any superhuman help to find that out.

Peter’s danger sense was not going off yet  but he still kept his eyes tracked on the firearm, ready to leap back at any moment. He still had some web fluid left, but he was reaching his limits and had been saving it ever since he got into this strange new universe. 
He hoped he wouldn’t have to use it now, he barely had enough left in it for a dozen or so short swings.

"Freak? Come on… I’m not that weird." He chuckled awkwardly. "I’m not gonna hurt you or anything. I just came here to take a shower."

This made the man’s eyes tighten. Like Peter, he was quite noticeably homeless at the moment, yet seemed protective of the neighborhood. It was, indeed, in a much better state than the one he had spent the night in. That one did not have any gyms in it and all the public bathrooms had been full of people half gone into a haze of drugs.

This amount of drug use, in fact, had been seriously worrying. Peter never had to investigate anything related to illegal substances, but even he could tell that something was off in Gotham. The misery and the dread in the air was almost suffocating.

"Fuck off." The old man finally said, lowering his gun. "Don’t come back here. I’m being nice. Next time I’m fucking shooting you."

Peter nodded abruptly and took the chance as it was offered, running from the edge of the roof and further into the rest of Gotham. He had to be more careful.
The encounter did give him some information, despite being utterly terrifying to go through. The stranger had not seemed overly surprised to see a teenager stick his way up a wall, which meant that this universe had to have some form of mutant abilities. Somewhat worryingly, however, the civilian’s immediate reaction had been to draw a weapon on him.

That was not a good sign for his standing as a mutant in this universe. As he jumped from roof to roof, he couldn’t help but wish he was back home, where people had finally started to become more tolerant.

Then, he remembered that home was not even home anymore, now that May, M-J and Ned were gone and he missed his landing, hitting the metallic roof of a warehouse with a loud clang.

He groaned, even though the bruises caused by the fall were healing before they even started marking his body, and slowly got to his knees. His breathing had started to pick up, and he had to stay there, frozen to the spot, until he managed to get it back under control.

Tears prickled at his eyes, ones that he could no swallow back no matter how hard he tried. He stayed there, on the roof, for a long time. He barely felt like a human anymore. What was the point of living if all the ones he loved were gone?

He shook his head. He had to make it work out. That was what May would have wanted for him. He couldn’t just give up. 
Still, he remained there, laying on the dirty roof, gasping in the cold air for a few more moments. Above his head, the sky looked just the same as the one back in his universe. For a second, he felt like he was back home.

It came back to him again. The loneliness was bitter, painful. The only exchange he’d had all day had been hostile and it made a little part of him want to curl up and cry.

Or course, most of him wanted to curl up and cry right now, although it was for different reasons.

In the end, he kept on going, standing up and running on. Years of haunting the New York roofs had prepared him well for this city. He could tell, as he travelled over them, that most of the lower streets were troubled, dangerous. Several times, he had to duck down to avoid a stray bullet.

It wasn’t even lunch time yet!

"Something is seriously wrong with this city." He groaned, rubbing his ears, which rang with the sound of the shot he had just dodged. His throat felt scratchy, his eyes burned. There was no one to help him out, at the end of the day. No one to welcome him home and cook with him. No one to talk after a long day of school and an evening of patrolling.

He had to get by on his own, find his way past this and make a life for himself that would make his aunt proud.

Peter landed softly on yet another roof. He had followed old road signs, looking and listening for the place he was seeking. Eventually, he managed to find it. It took him hours, even with his powers, which was odd for someone used to simply typing his question into a search engine and getting an answer right away.

His stomach rumbled as he settled down on the roof or the Gotham Public Library. He thought about eating one his cans before deciding against it. He still did not have any cutlery and, even though he could easily open them with his hands, he did not want to show up at a public library with dirty fingers. Especially not when he was planning on using the computers there.

With a sigh, he tightened his shirt-bag, cringing as it made the cans inside clang against each other. He must have been quite a sight right now, with his oversized dirty t-shirt, too big camo shorts, frayed scarf and the boots from his spider suit peaking out, adding even more incongruity to the whole outfit.

Well, it was a public library, surely they wouldn’t throw him out for this, right?

He made his way to the library’s entrance, climbing down the service ladder, not wanting a repeat of the confrontation he had earlier. Nobody batted an eye at him when he stepped inside. Apparently, he looked normal enough to blend in with the usual crowd. He didn’t know if he should feel good or bad about it, considering the kind of town he seemed to be in.

As soon as he spotted the computers on the second floor, half of them already taken by young children and other adults down on their luck, Peter headed straight their way, sitting down in front of one with a happy sigh.

This, sitting down on an uncomfortable desk chair in a public space, about to use an outdated computer for research, reminded him of the days from before Spider-Man. He used to meet up with Ned at the library, back in the days to look up Magic the Gathering strategies and Star Trek facts. He had many fond memories of those times.

Using a guest session, as he doubted he would be able to get a library card without flashing an ID, or at least a phone number, he started on his research. At first, he wanted to be pragmatic, looking only at the locations of the businesses on his list. Very quickly, however, he began to get distracted.

Unable to help himself, Peter gave up looking for adresses after the second business and instead went back to the browser homepage, typing :

"Gotham City"

A few million results popped up but Peter scrolled past the few obvious advertisements for travel agencies to get to the Wikipedia page dedicated to the city.

Apparently, he read, Gotham and it’s surroundings had almost eleven million people living in it. What he assumed was the commercial district the day before had just been part of one of the city’s many major districts. His stint on the bridge probably hadn’t even allowed him to see all it.

Looking further down, his eyebrows shot up significantly. Gotham was rated as number one in the whole United States by crime rate. However, the article added, even though it was in the lead now, and still was back then, the crime rate had been slowly declining over the past thirteen years due to the involvement of…

The "Batman"?

Now having completely forgotten about his quest for employment, Peter clicked on the affiliated Wikipedia article. The picture at the head of it was a blurry shot of a man, wearing a dark suit and what appeared to be a cape, although the way he held himself made him seem like he was melting into the shadows.

"Picture taken of the Batman during a Justice League intervention. Credits : Lois Lane”

This looked a lot like a superhero to Peter. As for this "Justice League" it sounded even more like a super hero team.

Heroes still existed in this world, then. It made sense, considering he had established mutants existed over there too. He probably would fit right in with that crowd, as long as he didn’t mention he got his powers from a radioactive genetically modified mutant spider.

Sometimes, Peter lamented that he had never gotten to look in depths at the metabolism of the spider that changed him. Too bad it had died right after biting him.

M-J used to joke about the spider taking over his body as it died and him actually having been a spider all along, during that beautiful week in which she had known and no one else had. 

If mutants existed here, however, it meant that some of them, at least statistically, would have taken the same path as him and many other heroes back home. This Batman person must be one of them too.

The page had a large section about the Bat’s history. Most notably, it had a record of the number of arrests attributed to him (and holy shit it was in the thousands), pictures of the aftermath of his most iconic fights and a whole section about his philosophy.

A wave of relief crashed over Peter when he read that the Bat was known to never make any victims. It was a code he had never broken. This was a hero he could respect, he decided. Maybe this town wasn’t all bad, if this was the person protecting them.

Linked to the Batman page were several others, namely ones showing the names of fellow super heroes as well as a list of Gotham’s major criminals. Peter almost  clicked on them to keep reading then suddenly remembered he was in a public library, which was probably going to close in a few hours.

He groaned, dropping his head into his hands. If only he had more time…

"Hey you." A cheerful voice called from behind him. "Anything I can help you with?"

He turned around, coming face to face with a smiling woman. In her early twenties, she had beautiful red hair and a genuine smile on her face. From where she was, sitting on her wheelchair, she was almost the same height as Peter. He blushed, ashamed to talk to a fellow human when he was looking as messy as he currently was.

She didn’t appear judgmental at all, simply waiting for him to answer. A badge on her Star Wars hoodie identified her as "Barbara - Library Staff". It was hard not to smile back, especially since he had really been going through a bad time recently.

"Hm.” He stuttered. "I uh was looking up some info."

She peered over his shoulder to look at the screen.

"Batman, uh? New in town?"

He blushed again.

"Is it that easy to tell?” He rubbed his head with his hand, feeling awkward. This place, Gotham, was turning out to be more and more… unique by the hour.

"The accent gives it away a little." She smiled. "New York, right?"

So New York did exist in this universe! Gotham must be located somewhere else on the East Coast.

"Yeah. I’m kind of lost honestly." Peter admitted. “Wanted to find out more about this city."

Barbara nodded. "Wise choice. You’re not going to want to leave your home a lot at first, it’s safer that way."

He didn’t feel like telling her that he currently had no way home, as she was apparently assuming he was just the unfortunate kid of some financially struggling family. He had been that kid, once.

"Yeah. Uh. I was wondering if you had any way of printing pages here."

She smiled at him again. Barbara apparently really liked her job, or maybe she felt bad for him. 

"You can get a card for free, and that would allow you to print up to 100 pages a day. I’ll just need your phone number and ID and I can set it up for you."

Peter cleared his throat. Awkward.

"I uh… don’t have a phone. My ID is uh- it’s home."

Technically, neither of those affirmations were lies. Barbara raised an eyebrow then took another long look at him. After a while, she narrowed her eyes and leaned over.

"Kid, Gotham is not a good place for a runaway. I know you think it’s less likely for people to find you here but best case scenario you end up shot or robbed in a week. You are better off in New York.

Peter shook his head.

"I’m eighteen." He lied.

She raised an eyebrow at that and he sighed. Damned oversized clothing! 

"Look." He finally answered. "I’m not a runaway. That’s the truth. I’m just not in a situation where I have access to those. It happens. There’s a reason why I’m here."

Once again, no lies there. They stared at each other for a few more seconds before Barbara shook her head and pulled something out of her pocket.

A library card.

"You can print 150 pages on this. I need the other 150 for my thesis draft."

Then, upon seeing him hesitate, she winked at him.

"Staff gets 300 free pages."

Barbara took the time to explain to him how to send the documents he wanted to the printer then told him to get her card back to her before he left. He watched her wheel away to help a little girl and her mother log in to their library session. She seemed like a good person.

After that, it became a race to pack as much copy and pasted text as he could on a Word document without making it impossible to read. He tried to grab as much as he could on Gotham, including the map of the city, a page on every active vigilante, and info on the many high profile criminals haunting the streets. He used all of his remaining pages to gather more knowledge on heroes from other cities, as well as recent world history. 
He wished he could get a card, find a few books. He did not, however, have the time to stay and read at the library, not when he was so short on money and supplies. As for getting a card and borrowing the books for free, it was out of the question until he found a way to get a form of ID and money for a phone plan.

Peter had no idea how much an average phone plan costed. May had often complained about it, though, before Mr. Stark gave them a lifetime subscription to Stark Services.

There was no billionaire to hand him favors this time. The best he could do was to print all he could and learn from it. 

By the time he was done compiling information, it was thirty minutes to seven, which a friendly disembodied computer voice had reminded everyone was the library’s closing time. Thankfully, there was no one at the printer so he managed to get everything out and the card back to the friendly librarian before closure.

"Thank you so much." He told her honestly. "This helps a lot."

She smiled, something a bit sad in her eyes.

"Remember what I said, kid." She said before he left. "Gotham isn’t safe for people who are on their own."

He wasn’t a kid anymore. He had fought monsters, he had seen death, faced death.

There was no way she could know that.

He went out of the library with a stack of paper in his hand, having no other way to carry it. He made it halfway down the front stairs leading into the street before realizing he had gotten completely off track.

Out of the fifty or so adresses on his list, he only looked up two of them. Worse, he could only remember the direction to one of those.

There was simply no way that this single address he remembered would take him on, not dressed like this, not when he was carrying a bunch of sheets of paper in his hands. He probably looked like a total weirdo.

Still, mostly because he had nothing else to do, he ended up going there. His stomach was hurting by now with how hungry he was. He had tried to make his rations last by skipping lunch and delaying dinner to when he had found shelter. He was finding that out to be a bad idea.

Peter stopped in front of the pizzeria as the sky darkened and the Gotham streets took on their nightly looks. He could hear whispers of death and deals around every corner.
He looked at the shop front. Old bright red paint promised a traditional, homey experience. Peter had known this place was a restaurant from the name, Marco’s Authentic Pizzeria, which had made him expect it to be in a somewhat safe area.

It was not. Marco’s was situated in the middle of the neighborhood Peter had slept in the night before. The buildings around it were all severely damaged and the restaurant itself looked like it had seen better days, with its front door handle hanging limply and what looked like a few bullet holes marring it’s wooden planks.

He pushed open the door, hearing someone shuffle in the back to come meet him. A man in his early forties slowly came out of what Peter assumed was the kitchen. Looking exhausted, he was wearing a grease stained apron and, judging by the heavy limp he moved with, there was a reason why he was looking for a new employee.

It was probably a delivery job, Peter deduced. This part of town was bad so no one wanted to come eat in there. The pizzeria was probably surviving on deliveries. The issue now was that he had no driver’s license, as well as no resume or-

"You here for the job?”

The man wiped his hand on the apron and walked over. He smelled like spices, oil and beer.

Peter could only bring himself to nod. He had had some small jobs before, but May had always been there to give him a pep talk before he went in to the interview. He had no idea what to do, now that he was on his own.

"Okay." The man said, surprising Peter. "I’ll be honest with you, kid, I don’t expect you to last more than a night."

He didn’t leave him time to interrupt, instead going on : "We deliver to anyone who asks. Everywhere. Cause of that it’s a bit more expensive. Used to do the deliveries myself but."

He gestured at his foot. Now that he was closer, Peter could see that most of it was wrapped in bandages.

"So, kid. You’re probably not gonna last. Got any iron?"

Peter gave him a blank look, not really understanding why he would need metal. The man barked out a sharp, unamused laugh but did not explain himself.

"Guess I don’t have a choice. Got to keep working. You get 5$ a delivery and you keep all tips. You also get this." 

The man set on the table a monster of a gadget. It appeared to have once been a car GPS, ripped from its stand and hooked to a portable battery. It looked clunky and old but, as long as it worked, it should help Peter get lost less.

"Did you steal this off a car?” He asked, because he couldn’t help but put his foot in his mouth.

The glare he got was enough to get him to close his mouth and lower his eyes.

"Hope you at least have a knife or something kid." Something softened in the man’s face and he leaned over the restaurant counter. "You sure you want the job? I know it’s tough for brats like you out there but this ain’t an easy business to work for in Gotham."

"I don’t have a choice." Peter shook his head, too tired to be anything but honest. "I’ll do it."

The man looked at him thoughtfully then :

"When can you start?”

He almost answered "tonight" but thought better of it. He did need the money but he was feeling terribly hungry, and carrying food around on an empty stomach sounded like torture. Instead, he replied he could start the next day, getting a nod in as his only answer. No contract was drafted up, he wasn’t asked for his ID.

Later, Peter realized what “iron" meant and, upon wondering why one would need a gun to deliver pizza, he concluded that the pizzeria owner did not, in fact expect him to come out of his first food delivery unscathed. There was something about this town, everyone was more violent than what he was used to.

And yet…

He thought about Barbara, who had not pushed him to answer her questions, who had helped him out more than she was supposed to. Someone had been nice to him today. Things were not so dark. Gotham was not always so gloomy as it seemed now, as it settled into an uneasy, violent evening.

 

Peter spent the night barricaded in a shed next to a small boatyard. It was a bad idea, as far as shelters went but, by midnight, he could hear people fighting and yelling not too far away from where he was hiding, and that was enough to make him stay put. He eventually fell asleep, exhaustion taking him down after he polished off a disgusting can of cold ravioli. He was so hungry that, for the first few bites, they almost tasted good.

He slept on a pile of empty boxes, with his grey shirt as a pillow. The shed’s walls were thin and he kept waking himself up by shivering too violently and knocking his elbows and knees on the wood.

Still, it was better than the streets.

In the morning, he snuck back into a gym, a different one, this time, to clean his body. The water was warm and felt like heaven on his cold skin. The tip of his fingers had started to turn blue, when the night had gotten really cold. He had to hold them up to his lighter to make it get better.

It was harder for him not to clean his clothes this time as they had grown humid from his night on the shore. He didn’t, though, knowing he could trash it for better clothes as soon as he started working that night.

Ashamed of his current looks, he spent the day on one of the tallest buildings he could find in this forgotten part of town. The sun was gone, on that day, leaving him cold and shivering.

He took the sheets of paper out from the waistband of his shorts. He had time to spare before his shift started, he had only been hired to cover nights after all, and he did not intend to laze around. He couldn’t. He had to keep his mind busy, focused.

Survival was his priority, he couldn’t look back, couldn’t think about what had happened.

His heart beating slightly too fast and his hands shaking, Peter started to read. As he progressed through the pages, his mind quieted. He didn’t even know if he was properly absorbing all of the information in front of him, with how tired and cold he was, but at least struggling for understanding allowed him to distract himself from darker emotions.

Through the whole day, though, he could not shake the terrible, empty sense of absolute loneliness that had taken over his life.

He didn’t know if he would be able to survive the months to come but, for May, for M-J, he would try.
Chapter 3: Pizza Time

    Peter delivers pizza.

(See the end of the chapter for notes.)
Chapter Text

He showed up at the pizzeria thirty minutes early, unable to focus on reading any longer, as the city was starting to grow colder and colder. Moving around would, at least, allow him to keep warm.

The owner (Marco?) took a long look at him, his dirty clothes and his messy hair, before sighing and inviting him inside.

"To start you with." He told Peter, "I got only five orders right now. Haven’t delivered for a while, I guess." He shook his head. "At least should be easier for you."

Mentally, Peter did the maths. Five deliveries would get him at least twenty-five dollars. He would be able to get more food, perhaps even a second hand jacket, or a long sleeve shirt.

As he thought, a pile of boxes was dropped in front of him. The smell coming from them made his stomach grumble. He did eat his last peaches can earlier, but this amount of food was not enough for a mutant like him, who relied on physical abilities. He kept his hunger at bay, though, knowing he would get to eat later that night, once his job was done.

Each pizza box had a small piece of paper taped on top, with an address scribbled on it, and an order of delivery. Curiously, there was no name. Peter distantly wondered what kind of people he was about to deliver them to, if he was expected to carry a gun and couldn’t even read the client’s name. Knowing better than to ask questions, he was about to grab the pile when his boss shook his head.

"I am not letting you touch food with your filthy gloves." He told him, pointing at Peter’s hands, still covered in his now worse for wear Spider suit. "Here."

The man limped back into the kitchen. Peter could hear him move around, opening a cupboard, grabbing something in it.

Marco came back, holding something dark and soft in his hands. He threw it in his direction and, by reflex, the teenager snapped it from the air.

It was a hoodie. The back of it had "Marcos’s Authentic Pizzeria" written across it. It looked almost identical in quality to the million of others professional print-to-order hoodies he’d seen.

”Now please, get rid of your little costume. I don’t even know in which dumpster you found something like this." The cook grumbled.

Peter hesitated but, in the end, relented. He kept the lower part of the suit on, changing in the restaurant’s bathroom, but took off the gloves. Most of his outfit could be disassembled thanks to hidden mechanisms Mr. Stark had helped him put there. A wave of nostalgia hit him, he bit it down.

He came back out into the main room. While he was changing, Marco had put the pizza in a strange looking backpack, that looked like a square. Peter had, of course, seen people go around with those on before. He’d never really ordered food himself, it was too expensive and he didn’t mind going to pick it up himself, when he did have the money for a treat, but he’d seen plenty of delivery bikers and drivers back in New York.

The hoodie fit loosely on him, obviously meant to be worn by someone larger and older than he was. He slid the pizza bag onto his shoulders. On the  table, an address had already been entered into the GPS. Peter picked it up.

"Good luck, kid." Marco told him before he left, "Be careful out there."

With the way the man was talking it almost seemed to him that he was heading to his death. He was not, of course, but he would rather not tell other people of his abilities if he could help it, especially not after what had happened back at the gym the other day.

The GPS informed him that he was headed to Chinatown for his first job. Peter couldn’t help but smile. Some things in this world were so different from his own, with all new heroes, villains and history, but at least there was still a Chinatown in big cities no matter the universe.

He made his way up the little pizzeria, crawling to the roof. His back felt warm against the pizza bag, the hoodie smelled clean.

Peter started running.

It was hard to move in a way that wouldn’t shake the pizzas too much but, in the end, he decided to simply keep away from bouncing, flipping and rolling, using only soft landings after a leap, and making sure the bag did not flip over.

It wasn’t easy, made him feel like he was transporting something much more valuable than he truly was. He put all of his focus on the task, shoving away thoughts of his family and friends.

He was almost starting to enjoy it when, as he reached his destination, he heard a gunshot ring in the night. Then another. He sighed.

He couldn’t get involved now, not when he did not have a functioning suit, was running low on web fluid and firearms were involved. He grit his teeth in frustration. Gotham was a huge city, despite how many vigilantes it had, and he did remember reading about them, it was not a safe place to walk in at night.

He made sure the way was clear before heading town to the alley below, Spider sense blessedly silent, which could only be a good sign.

Peter knocked at the door of the building his GPS took him to. It was a residential one, with several people living in it. After a short wait, the door opened to reveal a surprised looking man. In his early fifties, he looked down at Peter with a confused frown, then saw his backpack and smiled.

"So it’s true, uh?” He smirked. "Marco’s is delivering again."

Peter nodded silently, sliding the bag in front of him. To his rising discomfort, he could see a gun on the man’s belt, and was pretty sure he heard odd noises coming from the basement.

It took a lot of effort on his part not to go investigate the place. Instead, he handed over the pizza, keeping the address in mind, hoping he could come back and check it out later, as Spider-Man. The stranger accepted the food with a large smile then dug in his pocket.

The ten dollars bill he handed Peter looked completely foreign to him but he took it gratefully.

"’s great you guys are back in business," He got as an explanation for this sudden generosity. "All other places only deliver to the Heights, Old Gotham ‘n other rich folk districts."

He didn’t know what to say to that so he just smiled awkwardly, before glancing at the next address on the top box. 

The door closed as he was entering it into the GPS, he took that as a sign for him to start climbing away, which he did, after making sure no one was around to see it.
The next area he was heading to was called "The Bowery". It sounded familiar to him and he desperately tried to remember what he had read about it during the day.

He came up with no solid answer. It was becoming increasingly hard to focus and simply think, with how worn out he was. His stomach had started to grumble periodically, which did not help him focus on his current predicament.

The Bowery, as he quickly found out was, in fact, the area he had slept in during his first night. He recognized the damaged buildings and tense atmosphere as he slid around the roofs. He could hear voices conspiring in the dark. Gangs, he remembered. The job agency lady had said they were trying to keep kids like him away from them.

Not that he was a kid, of course. He had stopped being one the first time he saw someone he loved die in front of him. He had to act grown up now, especially now that May was-…

He buried the thought deep in his chest, focusing on the feeling of the tiled roof under his fingertips and the warmth of the bag on his back. He was almost to the right spot for his second delivery of the night.

"Here!” He heard as he reached the roof of the target building. "Come here!"

He frowned, looking around. There was a shape sitting at the top of one of the unused chimneys on the roof he was on. The moonlight lit his face enough that Peter, when squinting, could make out his features. He did a double take.

The man, sitting nonchalantly and smiling down at him, was wearing a domino mask. His outfit was clearly a battle suit of some kind, with leather, Kevlar and metal mixing and interlacing. It was hard to see colors, this deep into the night, but he thought he could identify some blue.

"This Marco’s?" The stranger beamed. "I can’t believe the one night I come help is the one you guys are open for deliveries again."

Peter nodded, intimidated by what he assumed was the first superhero he had encountered since he came to this new world. The man was acting extremely friendly, which threw him off a bit as most of his previous hero encounters had been either strictly professional or hostile, with some exceptions.

He remembered his older selves. They had both been very nice to him. He missed them, oddly.

”Come here, kid. I won’t bite." The hero told him, beckoning him over. Peter, feeling his heart thundering in his chest, took a few steps forward, sliding his bag off.

He grabbed a pizza from it, the top one, and slowly made his way up to the chimney, making sure not to use any of his special talents to get there. The gym altercation was still fresh in his mind. Mutants, in this world, obviously had a propensity to become agressive and dangerous, why else would the man have reacted this way? Peter was not in a hero suit, other than his pants and boots at least, there was a real risk that he would be taken for a hostile if he showed his true abilities.
A hand wrapped around his wrist, tugging him up.

"There you go." The man said, smiling gently. He helped Peter settle on the chimney next to him which, thankfully, appeared to have been plugged with a grid of some kind.

Still a bit dazed, Peter handed him the box. He couldn’t for the life of him remember the name of the hero but he did look familiar. He probably would have to read the sheets of paper again, once he was done with his job at least.

The adult handed him a bill in exchange for the food. It was a 5$ one, with yet another face he could not recognize. He really did get lucky with the Washingtons. Most other bills had changed, but ones stayed the the same.

"Thanks-hm… sir."

The man nodded thoughtfully, then asked :

"Kiddo, you carrying any weapon on you?"

At first, Peter flinched back, worried he was being taken for a criminal. Eventually, he noticed that there was no hostility in the hero’s voice, only worry.

"Um…" He stuttered. "…No. I uh… don’t need it."

The way he spoke made the other man freeze for a second.

"New York?" He was eventually asked.

He nodded, a blush slowly creeping its way up his face. He had no idea his accent was this recognizable.

"Okay, kid." The hero sighed, flipping open the pizza box and grabbing two slices. He bit into one and handed the other to Peter, who took it hesitantly, not knowing if he was allowed to stop and talk with the clients. "You’re from New York. I don’t want to know how you ended up in Gotham delivering pizza but if you want to survive this town, you need to be a bit more careful."

The odd man finished his slice in three giant bites, which was somewhat of an impressive feat, then set the box aside on Peter’s knees. Before the boy could protest, he was handed a small, cold piece of metal and the box was taken away again.

"You should eat your pizza," the stranger said, "The cheese is dripping."

Peter nodded blankly and did as he was told. The pizza tasted delicious, almost making him tear up. He kept his traitorous emotions under control as the older hero explained, knocking a finger on the metallic object he had given him:

"This is a taser. Pretty small, pretty compact, looks sneaky, too."

He put his hand over Peter’s, moving his fingers to show him the hidden pressure points on the weapon. When he pressed down, an arc of electricity crackled at the tip of the taser. 
Peter felt his blood go cold.

"I understand not wanting to carry iron- a gun- but you can’t go around with nothing in Gotham."

On those words, the blue-clad hero slowly rose to his feet, pizza still in hand. He gave Peter a sad smile, helping him down the chimney and back on the roof.

"Be careful out there, kid. Don’t hesitate to use this, if you get into trouble."

His fingers clenched around the cold metal, the boy could only nod. He felt very small and very alone but, still, he had to go on. He slid the weapon into the pocket of his shorts, next to the unused parts of his Spider suit.

He looked up to thank the man, who was, after all, only trying to help him, but he was already gone. He stayed there for a few more minutes, on the cold, windy roof, before remembering he had three more deliveries to make before he could head back and get his pay.

The warmth of the pizza slice in his stomach comforted him, in the dreary night. He made his way to his next stopping point with more energy and speed than he had before, sliding and jumping carefully until he had crossed most of the Bowery to reach its northern half. There, in a backstreet, was where his GPS was taking him.

He climbed down a rickety, obviously very old, ladder. As he put his feet on the ground, however, he heard a familiar click, and felt a cold weight settle on the back of his head.

"The fuck you doing here?" A gruff voice asked him. Behind him, heartbeats and the sound of breathing told Peter that he was definitely not alone. He would not have time to draw the taser before being shot, and if all of the men were carrying weapons, he did not have enough web fluid to safely deal with all of them.

So, Peter did the only thing he could think of. In a small voice, he said :

"Pizza… delivery?"

The gun against his head did not move, but he did hear someone take a sudden, surprised breath.

"Holy shit." Another different male voice said. "Are you from Marco’s?"

This time, the pressure on his scalp relented a bit as the gun owner relaxed his grip. "Marco’s?" He repeated. "Let me see your back.”

Peter obeyed immediately, heart pounding. He put his bag down gently, letting them see his empty hands all along. As soon as the men saw the logo on his back, he could feel the atmosphere shift.

"I really didn’t think they would come." One of the men said. "Thought they were closed."

"We reopened tonight." Peter piped in with a strangled voice. He still did not turn around, the gun, while not on his head anymore, was now resting on the small of his back. He heard someone open his pizza bag, take out a box.

"Shoulda ordered more,” the gunman complained to his friends, stepping away from him. "Here kid, sorry for scaring you."

He did not throw money at him, but instead a bag of something smelly and odd. Horrified, Peter realized he had just been tipped in cannabis. It took all he had not to throw it away, he was a good boy, and May had always told him to wait until his brain had finished developing to touch any mind altering drugs. In the end, he slid it in the pocket of his hoodie, hoping to drop it off on the roofs once he was further away.

"Thanks." He lied.

"Yeah yeah, now fuck off."

Not wanting a repeat of the gun-on-head incident, Peter immediately scrambled back up the ladder. He managed to clear three buildings before collapsing to his knees and puking up the slice he had been given earlier.

As Spider-Man, he had been in much more difficult situations than this. As Peter Parker, however, this was close to one of the most stressful things he had experienced in a long, long time. Close but not quite there yet. This town was messing with his mind, not being able to talk to M-J and the others was only dragging him further down.

He sighed and took out the small drugs bag. Standing up, he brought his arm back, readying his muscles.

His full force throw was enough to send the bag flying up in the air, away from the Bowery and into another city district. He watched it arc up in the night sky and fall in the distance. Someone might find it, hopefully an adult, who wouldn’t risk anything when using it.

Two more deliveries to go.

He had not expected his pizza delivery job to be this stressful, but he had no other choice than adapting to his surroundings.

To his dismay, after dropping off the fourth pizza in the hands of an astonished looking woman (who was carrying way too many weapons to be a civilian), Peter ended up in an area of Gotham that, somehow, looked almost as dangerous as the Bowery.

"East End", was what his GPS told him the neighborhood was named. It seemed to have less drug use than the Bowery, and the buildings were in better shape, but he could hear and smell enough gunpowder and sex to know that crime ran high in those parts.

Once again, he stuck to the heights, only looking below when an altercation broke out. To his surprise, some of who he assumed were gang members had make up on. They looked like demented clowns. He remembered reading about a clown criminal, earlier, maybe they were his lackeys.

He eventually reached his destination, on top of one of the rare nice buildings in the area. Made of white stone, it reminded him of some of the other, much nicer, districts he had been through in Gotham. He climbed down to the street, rang the bell.

A young woman answered the door, looking him up and down. Her face was blank, expressionless, as she took him in. Eventually, she gave him a small smile. Behind her, he could hear the shuffling and meowing of pets. Did she own the whole building?

"Marco’s Pizza." Peter introduced himself, having decided this was probably a crucial step in not getting shot.

”So he did reopen, uh? Didn’t think I’d live to see the day." The woman replied, digging through her pockets for a handful of ones. She handed them over, trading it for the pizza box. In total, he had made 22$ in tips that night. That, plus the 25$ he’d get for the delivery, should allow him to survive for a bit longer.

This one client was not talkative and he was sent back pretty quickly after, which he was grateful for. His body had already burned through the parts of pizza slice he got to digest before puking and, although he knew that he would not be getting anything better than cold canned ravioli that night, he was still looking forward to eating something, anything.

Making his way back to the pizzeria, Peter was struck again by how different Gotham was from New York. The lights seemed dimmer, here, the air heavier. The people, too, were more quiet, more wary than what he was used to. 

As he pushed open the pizzeria door, Marco welcomed him with a stunned look and a slightly hanging jaw. He had not, apparently, expected him to come back from this round, and had started to down a bottle of liquor, a cigarette in his hands. A half-full glass rested in front of him, the liquid inside too thick to be water.

"You’re back." The man said. “Did you complete the deliveries?"

Peter nodded, which earned him another astonished look.

"Shit." Marco said. "Guess I’m back in business, uh."

He shook his head and took out a few bills, that he set on the table in front of him. After some hesitation, he held out his hand. "Wait here." He told Peter.

After grabbing and counting the 25$, the teenager nodded, awkwardly shuffling around the small restaurant. It looked dusty, as if nobody had stepped foot inside in years. Several cleaner spots on the walls indicated that pictures and posters had once been hung there, only to be taken down recently.

After a dozen or so minute, the smell of food started to hit Peter’s nostrils and Marco came back, a small box in his hands.

“Here. Individual size pizza. Good job tonight, kid."

Peter blinked, looking at the offered box.

"This is for me?" He asked dumbly, not fully understanding the kindness that people were showing him, in a town that appeared so dark and hostile.

"Yeah." Marco said. "Now shoo. I need to clean the kitchen."

"Y-Yes sir." Peter nodded, gripping the pizza box tightly. He left the bag and GPS in the restaurant, as requested, but was told to keep the hoodie. Feeling slightly dazed, he ended up sitting on top of a water tank a few blocks away, staring at the food on his lap.

It was a simple pizza, cheese, tomato sauce and onions, no meat, olives or anything special added to it. It was basic but Peter ate it with as much care as if it were a precious three-star meal. The warmth spread down his throat and into his chest. Before he knew it, he had devoured the whole thing.

It really was a good pizza, no wonder everyone had been so excited about Marco’s being back in business.

Now with a bit more money in his pockets and a full stomach, Peter had to find a place to spend the night before being able to spend his earnings. He was already thinking about how to use the 47$ in his possession, his brain had not quieted since he first came to Gotham, he couldn’t let it be quiet.

If he did, the memories would come back.

 
Notes:

    In this story, Peter does not look like he did in No Way Home for the very simple reason that Tom Holland is around 25 and, in this, Peter is 17.
    So when you picture him, think about a younger version of the actor!

Chapter 4: Welcome to Gotham
Summary:

    More of Peter doing stuff.

Chapter Text

Shortly before morning, as Peter dozed, curled up under the roof of a rundown subway station he was pretty sure was being used for weapons deals, it started to rain. It was one of the heaviest storms he’d seen in a while, water crashing violently on the fragile roof above him, shocking him awake.

He blearily opened his eyes, shivering slightly. Frostbite was a serious concern of his, and he was starting to realize than sleeping outside in barely appropriate shelters was taking a heavy toll on his body and mind.

Ever since the previous night, the gun incident, he’d been rattled. It had stung to feel so powerless to know that, no matter what he did, he had no way out of the situation without getting injured.

And then if he got injured, what could he do? There was no one to patch him up anymore.

That was probably the hardest part of it all. As he had kneeled on that dark, damp roof, puking up the only warm food he’d had in days, he had been faced with the oppressive loneliness of his situation. With the fact that he would have no one to laugh this off with, nobody to tell the story to.

Peter didn’t think he’d be so afraid of being alone. Even at his most troubled, he always had the knowledge that, somewhere, May was thinking about him, M-J still loved him, Ned would help…

And Mr. Stark, Tony…

He didn’t want to think about it.

It was odd, being so terrified of something so intangible. Even as he shivered in the cold rain water, he barely noticed it as he considered the possibility that, maybe, he would indeed stay alone forever.

He shook his head abruptly, trying to drag himself away from his dark thoughts. He had to focus, he was Spider-Man, he was-

But he wasn’t really Spider-Man anymore now, was he? His powers were still there but, with how tired and hungry he was, he didn’t trust himself to fight more than a couple people at a time. His web fluid was almost out and his suit would not work.

Distantly, he remembered one of the two Other Peters. He had been able to produce his own web biologically, and, like the third of the Spider-Men, his suit did not appear to have any technological upgrades.

He used the man’s memory, someone like him, but without any of his gadgets or tricks, to shake himself off of his daze. He gathered his belongings, soberly considering his last can of food. At least he had money.

To his dismay, he had not woken up right as the rain started but, instead, several minutes later. This meant that his clothes, along with the paper he got from the library, were soaked. He regarded the file he compiled, wondering if he could maybe salvage it. It didn’t seem likely, the ink had already started to run and most of the pages looked like messes of black and gray.

Disappointment weighed heavily on his mind. He should have though this through better, considered the weather, found a better shelter. Thinking properly, however, was difficult. Hunger was not so much a problem as it once had been, thanks to the pizza from the day before, but exhaustion had settled deep into his bones.

It had been several nights spent in barely functional shelters, almost freezing to death. His sleep, already filled with nightmares, had not been restful. His emotions, frayed from the recent events, were almost unmanageable.

He needed a safe place to rest, to get his bearings. He had not been himself lately, could not be himself with everything that was happening around him.

Peter jumped out of his hiding spot, not hearing anyone else outside in such a weather. As soon as he stepped out from under the broken roof, water crashed on him and went through his clothes. He might as well be naked, that would help about as much.

At four in the morning, according to the giant clock tower he could see in the distance, there weren’t many places open and he didn’t want to spend his money on a fast food. More supplies could be stretched out from 47$ than he would get off of a burger and fries. He needed more than that to sustain himself, anyways.

Another disturbing thing he had noticed, since he came to, was the deafening quietness of his Spider sense. It had not went off once, not even when guns were drawn on him. The sense, being a somewhat more recent addition to his powers than the wall climbing, super strength and other more physical attributes, was something he was less familiar with. He had never had it up and disappear on him like this before.

Having it go away now of all times was not helping with his general anxious state. At first, he had thought it was just a sign that he was safe, but since last night’s delivery, he wasn’t so sure anymore. He had been in danger. Yet, it had come as a surprise.

Water poured on him and he started fearing for his money. He had cleaned out one of the cans and stuffed the bills in it, underneath his gloves and mask, to make sure they wouldn’t get stolen or damaged as he slept. Now, however, the rain was falling so hard that it might get wet despite all of his efforts.

No fast food, he had decided, but what other place could he hide out in safely and away from the water? He had returned to the Bowery, feeling like its dangers were, at least, familiar to him. It had helped him find a spot for the night, as a lot of buildings were abandoned and only squatted up to the first flew floors. Now, however, it was working against him. The high areas he had used to hide from the gangs and rest up were all poorly protected from the water.

He didn’t know where to go.

Aimlessly, Peter walked around the roofs, trying his best not to slip and fall. After a while, he managed to find an emergency staircase that wasn’t occupied and was also miraculously somewhat sheltered thanks to a balcony a few dozen feet or so above it. He wriggled his body into the small parts of it that escaped the rain and settled down there, knees against his chest.

Almost as bad as the loneliness, he thought as he watched water drop in front of his eyes, splashing at his feet then falling down to the street below, was the cold. Like New York, Gotham City’s weather appeared heavily influenced by the ocean it was built next to. The humidity, however, was even higher than it was back home, somehow. It made the cold able to penetrate through his clothes and set deep into his bones. It had been a while since he had been so cold for so long.

The memory came up in his tired mind, and he did not have the strength to bat it down. Their first winter without Ben. They had spent most of these dark nights huddled together under the two blankets and two coats they owned, sharing the same mattress. After school, May took him to her second job at a coffee shop, where he could sit in the spinning high chairs and get a free pastry, as long as he was nice to the owner.

Peter smiled, remembering how lost and scared he had felt then. Abruptly, his smile soured. As scared as he had been, he could rely on May.

She died because of him.

The thought punched him in the guts, making him clench his fists and close his eyes. He knew it was not true, knew she would be proud of what he had done, would have wanted him to be too, but he was not proud. He felt guilty.

He sat there until the sky started to lighten up, watching the rain fall and listening to the sounds of a somewhat subdued Gotham. Once in a while, he could hear screams. Something in him wanted to go help, he didn’t.

He hated himself for it. He was too weak though, too conflicted.

As the sun rose, the rain didn’t stop, forcing him to head out under it. The Pizzeria hoodie at least allowed him to protect his face and hair, but the rest of him was shivering badly. He ducked into the first open convenience store he found, breaking down and grabbing a 1$ umbrella from the front. The thing was heavy and probably easily breakable, he would need to get his hand on some tape and string to make sure he could repair it.

Once he felt more confident about the safety of his dollar bills, Peter started looking for any kind of low budget store. There was, to his surprise, a very large number of them scattered throughout the Bowery. Maybe he should have come there on his first day, instead of making his way into the richer districts.

It made sense, in a dark sort of way. Most of those second hand places were also pawn shops, and Peter had noticed a high rate of drug use in the area. He had himself on several occasions had to figure out his way around a drug-withdrawal related crime. If some people were desperate enough to commit crimes when in that state, most of the ones that wouldn’t ressort to violence would probably sell their belongings.

Even then, as a thief, you had to sell your loot somewhere.

It was hard for him to understand some of the troubles adults and more unlucky teenagers went through, but he always tried to at least attempt to see it their way. He felt it was only fair, when he beat them up to a pulp, to not assume they were just all doing this because of some inherent evil nature.

His 46$ safely stored, Peter made his way towards the closest of the pawn shop. He tried to, at least.

As he walked, a hand closed on his shoulder, attempting to tug him backwards. Despite his smaller frame, due to his age, he didn’t move. It took a lot more than a tug to overcome his super strength. He yanked his shoulder forward, tearing it free from the stranger’s grip.

"What the hell, man?" Peter whipped around, coming face to face with two boys, barely older than him.

There was a hollowness to their cheeks that hadn’t settled in in his yet and their clothes looked as ragged as his felt over the Spider suit. Both of them were holding weapons, one a knife, the other, a baseball bat.

“Got cash or loot?" The boy who had grabbed him asked, dragging his words slightly. There was an unfocused look to his eyes, but his heartbeat and breathing sounded sober to Peter. Head trauma? Illness? Maybe a speech impediment.

The other boy stepped forward slightly. They were both taller than him but, as long as guns were not involved, the New-Yorker did not have anything to fear in contests of strength. Now, he just had to make sure he fought them off in a way that did not scream "mutant" to them and the people undoubtedly watching from inside the buildings lining the street.

This was going to be harder.

His fingers brushed past his shorts as he tried to figure out how he wanted to handle the situation. As they did, he could feel something hard inside of his pocket. Was it the can? No… it was too small…

With a sudden flash of inspiration, Peter snapped the taser out of his pocket, his speed bordering on unnatural just enough that he helped it wouldn’t draw too much attention. It took him a second longer than he hoped to find the correct finger placement but, once he did, electricity sparked menacingly from his weapon.

"Back off." He warned.

The two boys exchanged a look, obviously weighing the risks and benefits of going after him now that he had revealed he wasn’t defenseless. They were still two against his one, though, which in their mind meant they still had a chance to win.

Peter was weak enough that he didn’t trust himself to dodge several gunshots at point blank range, that did not mean he had lost all of his strength. They didn’t know what they were going up against, if they decided to-

Yep.

He saw the first boy’s shoulder muscle tense, perspiration dripping down his forehead. His movements seemed slow to Peter. It was terribly easy to strike before the knife moved even a few inches. His hand shot forward with inhuman velocity and wrapped around the attacker’s wrist. He squeezed slightly.

In front of him, the taller boy’s face paled, as he found himself unable to move his arm any longer. He tried to tug himself free of Peter’s grip. Of course, it was in vain.

"What the-"

Abruptly, Peter let go of his wrist and shoved his shoulder into his chest. He tried to put as little strength as he could behind the blow, but it was still more than enough to make his opponent fall backwards, crashing into the ground with a gasp.

In his other hand, he still held the taser, sparking threateningly.

"Back off." He repeated, voice even. His head was thumping, he was starting to feel hungry again. 

This time, they listened to him, scrambling away and cursing at him and his mother, father and great-uncle. He watched them leave with a sigh, putting the taser back into his pocket and scratching his head.

At least they didn’t notice there was anything odd about him, and he didn’t have to actually use the weapon the hero had given him the night before.

Hoping nobody would try to attack him again, he ducked into the store, hand still wrapped around the taser.

Inside, a dark haired woman was sitting  behind the counter, looking at her phone. She raised her head when he walked in, narrowing her eyes.

”I have money." Peter spluttered, not wanting to make her think he was going to rob her store.

She shrugged and bent over, taking something out from under the counter. When she sat a revolver down on it, tip turned towards Peter, he let out a long sigh.

"I’m not looking for a fight." He tried "I just want a bag."

”As long as you pay for it, no need for me to use this." The shopkeeper replied, sending him an unamused glare. Not wanting to push his luck, he nodded and elected on ignoring the weapon. The silence from his Spider sense didn’t help putting him at ease either.

Riffling through the different bins and shelves in the store, Peter managed to find an old pair of shoes, priced at 12$, and a backpack, for 14. Those were quite an investment, taking a chunk out of his budget, but he couldn’t keep walking around in his spider boots. He also needed a way to carry his stuff, at least until he found permanent housing.

Upon seeing him walk to the counter and pull out his bills, the woman relaxed, putting her weapon back into the counter.

His new shoes on and his belongings transferred into the ratty, grey backpack, he hunted down a small clothes store, in which he invested 15$ for underwear and socks.

By the time lunch rolled around, he only had 5$ left out of the 47 he had started the day with. That went into a large jar of peanut butter, a loaf of sliced bread and a pack of beef jerky sticks.

He ended up eating a few slices, having to dip his fingers into the jar, since he still did not have any cutlery, but kept the jerky closed, afraid that it would attract insects if he kept it open. He yawned. Now that he had eaten something, his tiredness was catching up to him. Unfortunately, it was still raining heavily.

And that was how Peter ended up at the Gotham Public Library for the second time that week. 
He noticed the high amount of people in the building as he entered it. Obviously, he wasn’t the only person with poor living situations who had thought of taking shelter there.

It put a bit of a damper of his plan to doze off in a random chair. With this amount of people there, he didn’t feel confident sleeping in public and not getting his bag swiped. There was, of course, nothing of monetary value inside but, to him, it was all he had.

Barbara was there on that day too, although she was too busy at the front desk for him to come and say hi to her. She probably wouldn’t even care anyways. He waved at her nonetheless, still grateful that she had shown him kindness at a time of his life when he truly needed it.

Blessedly, two computers were still free on the second floor when he climbed up there. There were a lot less children this time and, Peter, who had not kept track of days, weeks or dates, assumed it must be a school day. He logged in to the guest session.

Well, he had a whole afternoon to spend before heading to the pizzeria, might as well brush up on the vague knowledge he remembered gleaning from the waterlogged documents.

First things first, he went back to the Batman Wikipedia page, remembering about the hero he has met the night before. Obviously, it had not been the bat, Peter remembered that there had been no cape on the stranger’s back, but this page linked to many of the other vigilantes active in Gotham. Surely, he would be able to find him.

After reading through the Robin page, which he found fascinating considering his home world did not have hero assistants, or sidekicks as some of the articles called it that he knew of, he ended up somewhere that made him straighten up abruptly.

"Nightwing" he whispered, eyes locked on the small, blurry picture of a man in mid jump, clad in black and blue body armor. There were several changes to his outfit, compared to the one he has seen the night before, but it was similar enough that there was no doubt.

Nightwing had been the first of the Robins, many years ago, before moving away from Gotham to the nearby city of Blüdhaven, which he had been protecting ever since. Peter did remember him mentioning something about coming back, but his headache was stopping him from thinking too hard about it, worsening when he made the mistake of doing so.

To his confusion, the article specified that Nightwing, like Batman, was not suspected of being a "metahuman". The foreign term lead to another page, which he followed.

Metahumans…

From what had been made public of the researches that had been conducted on them, then posted on Wikipedia, metas were this world’s equivalent of mutants, being directly connected with a set of genes, specifically one, which was apparently the source of the supernatural abilities they could get.

Unlike the mutants of his universe, most metas were suspected to need a form of trigger or life event to happen, as every iteration of meta abilities came on suddenly and abruptly. At the bottom of the page, a list of suspected meta humans was written. Unsurprisingly, most of them were either superheroes or villains. Neither Batman nor Nightwing, or Robin, for that matter, where in it.

"Metahumans?" A familiar voice read behind him, making him jump violently.

Barbara smiled innocently when he turned towards her, a hand on his chest, heart thumping. How the woman could be so stealthy while in a wheelchair perplexed him somewhat, but her interest in him confused him even more.

"It’s interesting." Peter eventually replied, trying his best not to look suspicious. "I never really looked into it."

The look she gave him was dubitative, to say the least. She didn’t make any comment though. Just like before, she didn’t push him, even though he could tell she was just choosing to let him get away with his lie.

"Aha." She nodded instead. "That they are. You’re probably going to meet several of them in Gotham, if you haven’t yet in New York."

"Oh I have,” Peter said, thinking about the sand person he had just encountered a few days ago. "I met a lizard-man once."

She whistled at that, although not looking overly surprised that such a thing existed. Good, that meant he hadn’t blundered. 

"We do have a crocodile man, here, but I wouldn’t recommend talking to him.” She leaned it and whispered : "He’s a bit murderous."

Before coming to Gotham, Peter would have assumed she was joking. Now that he had experienced it for himself, he was not so sure.

"Oh gosh!" Barbara gasped. "I almost forgot about this!”

She gestured to her lap, on which sat what appear to be a small pamphlet. After having it handed to him, Peter flipped through the thirty or so laminated pages. Every single one of them was dedicated to a specific criminal and included a picture, a transcription of their dedicated siren rhythm, and a list of things to do and not do in case of an emergency involving them.

Most of the "dos" involved hiding and praying.

"This is called ‘Welcome to Gotham’” Barbara told him proudly. "The Library staff had the idea to write it, the GCPD and Wayne Industries helped us make the idea into a reality."

Peter flipped back to the front page of the pamphlet. It was, indeed, named "Welcome to Gotham".

"Did you chose the name?" He asked, smiling despite himself.

She shook her head. "My father did. I think he did pretty well on this one."

"I think so too. Thanks a lot."

"Of course," she said, starting to wheel herself away. "I saw that you were looking up criminals earlier this week, figured you hadn’t been given this when you moved in."

Yes, because Peter had not "moved in" and, from the way she said it, Barbara knew that. She let him have his secrets, though, and he was grateful for it.

"I’m Peter." He stammered out, before she got too far away. She turned around in her chair and laughed, smiling at him.

"Welcome to Gotham, Peter!"

Then, she left for good. He sat in front of the computer in silence for a bit, looking back at where she had gone to take the elevator down. She wasn’t his friend, she was just doing her job but still… It felt good to talk to someone.
Chapter 5: Dangerous dealings
Summary:

    Peter meets two important Gotham figures without realizing it.

Notes:

(See the end of the chapter for notes.)
Chapter Text

The pamphlet Barbara had given him was a lot more intimidating than what Peter originally thought. As he sat above the door of building in front of Marco’s, he flipped through it again, grimacing as its content did not change since the last time he had gone through it.

The abilities of the criminals featured in the document were not the most impressive he had been up against. He still remembered the altercation he had with Stephen, less than a week earlier. The guy had turned back to his side eventually but, gosh, fighting him had been stressful. He was just a dude with spider powers, Strange’s magic could alter reality itself.

Compared to this kind of power, Gotham’s rogues seemed almost inconsequential. He certainly thought so, when he read about them online. Barbara’s document, though, was showing him how wrong he had been to assume this.

At first glance, only a few of the criminals in the city could handle a one on one fight with a trained meta like him, however, as he looked more in details into each of them, it became apparent that they did not rely on physical strength to commit their crimes.

Scarecrow, for example, was a villain known for using and spreading something called "fear toxin" throughout the air and water system whenever he managed to free himself. The top advices given when infected with the toxins were to immediately inject an antitoxin and, in case one was not available, lock oneself far away from other people and any sort of sharp objects.

The pamphlet did specify Fear Toxin inhibitors and more potent antitoxins were distributed daily at three different GCPD stations in the Gotham area. Of course, none of them was located in the Bowery. Peter groaned upon seeing only a few hundreds were available each day. It was a first come, first served situation. In a city with ten million people.

He’d just have to be careful, then. There was a large section higher on the page about mitigating risks of contamination during a Scarecrow alert. Unfortunately, the main recommandation was to barricade oneself in a room with bottled water and rations, and plug the doors and windows with wet towels.

Peter did not have any of the elements required to successfully use this strategy so he just resigned himself to a very, very bad time if he ever got contaminated.

"Hey kid!" Marco called him, distracting him from his reading. He packed the pamphlet in his bag and waved at his boss, who frowned up at him.

"What are you doing up there?" The older man grumbled, gesturing at the door. He didn’t wait for Peter’s answer, turning back into the pizzeria, muttering under his breath about ‘kids these days'.

Peter shrugged at that, not bothered by the man’s attitude in the slightest. This town looked like a place that swallowed up people with its darkness, the ones that didn’t fall into addiction or crime, yet still chose to stay there had to have a way to cope. It wasn’t the first time he had seen someone act like that before.

He jumped down from the stone ledge above the door, landing in a crouch, a hand coming to rest on the ground to stabilize himself. The posture reminded him of being Spider-Man, and he looked down, pensive. He had to figure that part of his life out too, once he was in a safer situation.

"You look tired, kid." Marco told him when he entered the restaurant. “Up past your bed time?"

Peter glared at him, shaking his head.

"Well,” Marco drawled, "If you make it to the end of tonight’s delivery, I can help you with that."

"Help me with my bedtime?"

He did not get any sign of recognition for his question, instead being handed the square pizza bag he’d worn the previous night, and the suspicious GPS.

"Good luck tonight.” Marco said, limping back to the kitchen. "If after this you’re still wanting to work here, I’ll help you out with some stuff."

Peter nodded, surprised.

After being left alone in the dining room, he took the time to type in the first address that night. There were eight pizza this night, two of them sharing the same delivery place.

His first job was to Old Gotham, to the GCPD headquarters of all things. Peter had never had the best of relationships with law enforcement, his recent experiences making him a bit wary of them but he was just a pizza delivery boy, surely they wouldn’t bother him.

Halfway there, he remembered that he did not have government ID, a work contract or even a bank account to speak of. And his clothings were a dead give away of his financial struggles, too. What if they tried to contact social services?

He couldn’t afford to lose the job, his peanut butter, bread and jerky would not last him long, and he had no other way of getting money that night. He would just have to try and make the best of it. Worst case scenario, he could still run away, he would just have to make sure not to use his web shooters. Unless there was an absolute emergency, he didn’t want to spend his web fluid reserves until he had found the chemicals to make some more.

That would cost him about 100$, if the materials were even available in this universe.

No way he could afford it right now, but once he found housing, he would be able to start saving up for it. Marco said he would help him with it, after all and, so far, the man had been fair with him despite his rough exterior.

Old Gotham was beautiful, in its own way. Each buildings had a distinct, gothic touch that reminded him of some European churches he had studied in class. The stone they were built out of, under the grime and shiny wetness left over by the day’s downpour, were white and chalky. Statues of animals, demons and angels decorated the rooftops, gargoyles visible in almost every street. It was almost surreal, how dedicated the district was to this gothic, ancient European theme.

It was charming, in a way. It also helped him picture what the Bowery had once looked like, as he recognized a lot of similarities between the less pompous buildings in Old Gotham and the few unscathed housing units back in the poorer districts.

He landed a few streets away from the police station, not wanting them to see him clamber down from the rooftops. It might be seen as trespassing, now that he thought about it.

As he got closer to the place, he couldn’t help but feel slightly nervous. Wanting to make this as fast as possible, he took the pizza out in advance, holding it in front of him, as if it would protect him from any unwanted questions.

The police station was large and bustling, despite the fact that it was almost 8pm. On top of officers running around, Peter could make out a large number of cars, and several other types of vehicles, parked in an open garage connected to the headquarters. He could see a police van, a bus and… was this a tank?

"Hey!" Someone called out to him as he approached the station. "You from Marco’s?"

A man approached, wearing a beat up tan trench-coat, at odds with his crisp black suit. He appeared to be in his early fifties, or perhaps late forties, with graying temples and slight wrinkles on his temples and forehead. He looked like a typical detective from an old movie. In fact, he was so stereotypical with his mustache and serious face that Peter stayed silent for a second too long, staring at him.

"From Marco’s?" The man asked again.

Peter nodded, pushing the box into the police officer’s hands. Before he could walk away, however, the adult raised a hand, almost putting it on his shoulder, hesitating, then withdrawing it slowly. 

The man cleared his throat.

"He did open up for business again, then?”

"Y-yes sir.”

The policeman nodded, looking grave. Somberly, he told Peter :

"Walk with me kid, I need to talk to you."

A bit confused, he obeyed, not wanting to get on the man’s bad side. He followed him quietly, listening as the gothamite explained :

"I wanted to make sure the rumors were true. Seems like they were. Also wanted to set down a few rules with you."

He took a cigarette out of his trench coat pocket, lighting it in a smooth movement. With his heightened senses, Peter could clearly read the little "Best Dad" that was scribbled on his lighter in red. It was a small thing, but it made him relax a little bit.

"I have nothing against the man you work for, it’s in his prerogative to do business with whoever he wants to." He took a drag of his smoke, puffing out a large cloud with the experience of a regular smoker. Peter had a hard time not coughing when the wind blew some of it into his nose. 
"You should probably be made aware, however, that due to him being the only one to deliver to every single person in this city, you might be exposed to some illegal activities."

Peter thought back to the previous night.

"Someone gave me marijuana yesterday." He blurted out, desperately wanting to be helpful and avoid suspicion. "I threw it out."

This caused the man to look at him for a few seconds, a frown on his face.

"Hm." The police officer said. "Something a bit more… large scale.”

"Ah." Peter replied, his cheeks reddening. "Sorry."

They stayed silent for a while. Then, the adult finished his cigarette with an alarmingly long drag, turned it off by smashing it on the wall, and, after checking it was fully out, threw it into a nearby trashcan.

"You’re not from Gotham, are you, boy?” The man asked. Peter shook his head, knowing his accent betrayed him. This earned him another nod. "I’ll be straightforward, then. Marco’s delivers all over the town, to all kind of people. Once a week, I will be ordering food from your place. We will meet here, behind the station."

By now, they had stopped walking, stopping in a parking lot that was solely occupied by police cars and officers talking together. If he focused, he could understand what they were saying. Most of them were talking about a penguin. Did something happen at the zoo?

He was brought back to his current conversation when the officer he had delivered the pizza to started talking again, he had stopped to finish his second cigarette.

"Depending on what you can tell me about your deliveries, I’ll give you a tip. Believe me, if your stories are really good, and truthful, I can be quite generous."

Was… Was he being recruited as a police informant? He gulped. This might be outside of his pay grade but… he couldn’t exactly say no, could he? The police was on the right side of the law, and even if the pizzeria’s clients learned about it, Peter could just disappear again. Marco didn’t even know his name.

"Um… okay." He mumbled, shifting uncomfortably. This earned him a satisfied look from the older man, and yet another nod.

"Good. I like to talk in person. Don’t deliver to anyone else if I’m the one ordering. If I’m not there, ask for Gordon."

"Yes sir."

”You made a good choice kid. Keep working and keep away from the gangs." Gordon patted him on the back, slipping a piece of paper into the jacket of his hoodie before leaving, hands in the pockets of his trench-coat. He did not ask his name, his age or to see his papers. Peter could hardly believe it.

Then, he took the 100$ bill out of his pocket, saw how much it was worth, and almost had a panic attack right there and then. What in the hell had he just gotten into? And how did a police station have this much money to throw around at informants as inconsequential as a pizza delivery boy? One who had just started on the job, nonetheless.

Deep down, the logical part of him suspected that it was an attempt at keeping him on the right side of the law early on, luring him in with a large gift to make sure he would stay loyal to the GCPD, and to his contact. It was hard not to feel grateful, of course, as this single piece of paper would allow him to eat for more than two weeks, if he didn’t spend it on anything else. He could probably stretch it even longer, too.

Peter Parker, police informant. Back in New York, he had been a perfectly ordinary teenager, Spider-Man had been the one with an exciting, dangerous life, but Spider-Man was not even active in Gotham yet and still his life had managed to become a complete mess. Trouble had seemed to follow him from his vigilante life into his civilian one, now that he was taking an involuntary break from heroism.

Remembering he still had seven deliveries to make, he shook himself out of his stupor, hid the bill at the bottom of his brand new secondhand sneakers, and headed out of the police area. Nobody glanced at him. In fact, now that he was paying closer attention, he could tell that several of the figures he had taken for officers were in fact civilians like him. He wondered how much they were getting paid for the infos they were delivering.

Maybe he could find a way to make this work in his favor. He did need money, after all. As long as he didn’t get found out as a snitch, he should be fine.

Right?

The second and third pizza took him back to East End. He delivered one to what smelled and sounded suspiciously like a brothel, dropping it off and leaving with a few one dollar bills more in his pockets. The other one took him to a suspiciously hidden man, who was wearing a suspiciously dark outfit and had a suspiciously large black case next to him. Considering he was crouching at the top of a building, Peter was seriously worried about the content of the case.

"You good here pal?" He asked, wishing his Spider sense was still there to guide him. 

The man grunted, flipping him off. He didn’t get any tips this time, but he was honestly happy to get off with his life. He sincerely hoped the dude was an undercover police officer, and not something more sinister.

The fourth pizza led him even further into Gotham, to the northern edge of the Bowery. As he climbed down to the street, he spotted the remains of a vandalized road sign. Initially showing the name of "Park Row" in bold white lettering, someone had painted over it a large red “CRIME ALLEY" and then, for good measure, "ACAB". He squirmed uncomfortably at the nickname. This was not a good sign.

As he walked down the alley to get to his drop off point, he started hearing shuffling coming from around him. Feet, people trying to stay stealthy. He frowned, wishing his Spider sense could be working again. Wishes and prayer, though, were not going to be enough to get him out of trouble, if he ever ended up in it.

He heard a click, metallic, familiar, and immediately tensed up. Firearm. He slowed down his pace, senses stretched out. He could pick out several heartbeats down into the street, five-no… six of them were scattered in the shadowy areas.  He wouldn’t let himself be taken by surprise again. 
His delivery spot was past the men. He walked in that direction slowly, ready to leap as soon as he saw movement. He could feel the air move as the group snuck in the shadows. The one with the gun was coming with them, slinking to his left. He probably hoped he could take him by surprise, put the weapon to his head and take his money.

Peter sniffed the air, trying to judge how many guns were around him. It was made impossible by the Alley’s own smell, a mix of blood, urine and gunpowder had seeped into its stones. He would just have to act fast.

As soon as the gunman got to ten feet of him, he sprung into action, using his superhuman speed and strength to pummel into the thug before he could aim his weapon at him. The stone ground cracked when he used it to launch himself at the man, and so did said man’s nose, when Peter, after digging his shoulder into his chest, punched up at his face and knocked him out cold.

One down, five more to go. He had moved so fast the other men had barely started to react. With a grin, now realizing he had missed the adrenaline rush of a good fight, he used the wall of a nearby building as a launchpad, flying through the air and straight at another of the thugs. Still mid-air, he twisted his hips, planting his heel in the man’s cheek. He always held his strength for those kind of kicks, to make sure he didn’t break any necks, but a few teeth were still knocked out by the impact. 

By now, the other four finally had time to react, and he could hear a few more clicks. One was from a pistol, he noted, another sounded unfamiliar, which was never a good sign. He headed for this one first, staying low this time, pushing on the ground with his arms and legs to leap as fast as he could.

Shotgun, he noticed, as it was pointed at him. His Spider sense did not go off.

Reacting immediately, he plunged to the left, slightly too fast for an ordinary human, and rolled away from the blast. His ears rung painfully but he did not have time to stop and worry about it. He had to get to the shotgun holder before he reloaded.

It was as he planted his fist in the man’s solar plexus, sending him flying back and crashing into the wall, that he remembered about the second firearm. And about the fact that he had forgotten to pick up the first.

Cursing his tiredness, he resolved himself to using his web shooters, as close to empty as they may be, when a bang rang through the night.

He couldn’t feel any pain, when he looked down at himself, there was no blood.

Surprised, he looked around. He could, in fact, smell powder residue, which meant a gun had been fired, but it wasn’t coming from around him, besides the shotgun, which was already cooling. No, this new scent was coming from further down the street.

"Ah shit." One of the three remaining conscious men cursed. "I told you dumbasses not to be noisy."

Peter, who had been distracted by the fight, had not heard the newcomer approach, even as they drew their gun and shot into the air, a very unsafe practice, as Happy had taught him.

”Boys, Boys, Boys…" A high-pitched voice, toeing the line between amused and hysterical, sung in the shadows. "I’m waiting on a delivery. All of this fighting is going to scare them off. How naughty of you…"

She came into the light of the one functioning light bulb in all of Crime Alley, rolling her hips like a top model as she walked and twirling a customized revolver as if it was a prop. Peter could smell its heat, over the scents of the Alley itself. It was the real deal.

He fully expected a gun fight to break out there and then but, instead, the men hung their heads low, putting their weapons away.

"We’re sorry Harley." Shotgun man apologized, his erratic heartbeat betraying his fear.

"We didn’t know he was a pizza guy."

"Are you kidding?" Peter complained, "I have a pizza bag on my back! It’s huge!"

"It is." Harley agreed. Then she cocked her head to the side and shrugged. "Alright boys. I’m counting to 3. Slowpokes get shot." She said cheerfully.

Oh God.

"Erm-“ Peter cut in, "How about that pizza?"

That seemed to distract her long enough for the thugs to run away, dragging their unconscious friends with them. He felt a bit bad about going this hard on them, hoping he didn’t give them too bad of a head wound.

It was hard to fight without all of his usual tools. Incapacitating regular humans without his webs was proving to be a very delicate task. Even tired and underfed as he was right now, a regular blow from him could easily accidentally kill someone who wasn’t trained to take it.

"Sooo…" Harley leaned in maliciously. "Are you a meta? Cause the way you punched this one guy! BAM!"

Her exclamation was accompanied by another loud BANG as she shot towards the sky.

"You really shouldn’t be doing that." Peter commented, hoping the bullet wasn’t going to hurt anything on its way down.

"Watcha gonna do?" The woman laughed. "Cops don’t come here unless there’s like a big BIG gun hidin out there."

Now frankly uncomfortable, and not wanting to answer her question about being or not a meta, Peter focused on opening his bag and taking out her order. She got two pizza, one was vegan, the other one a super meat combo.

He stared at the orders for a moment, hoping they weren’t mixed up, before handing it to her, hoping not to get shot if he was, in fact wrong about it.

"Aaaw." Harley cooed, "You’re so sweet. Wanna come in?"

Red flags flying everywhere in his mind, Peter flashed the woman a polite smile and shook his head. "Sorry, still got three pizza to deliver."

"Oh yes…" she hummed thoughtfully, "You’re working right? Well, then, I’ll see you tomorrow."

"You probably shouldn’t order pizza two days in a row either." Peter replied automatically. It was pointless as, before he even opened his mouth, the woman had turned on her heels and strolled away. No tip there either, but perhaps coming out of this interaction still alive was enough of a reward. Plus, the generous bribe from Gordon was more than enough to cover the night.

Thankfully for his heart, his last deliveries were uneventful, taking him to the docks, where a GCPD officer on what appeared to be lookout duty thanked him profusely.

"Didn’t think you guys were still around." He told him. "Used to order Marco’s on stake-outs all the time, back in the days."

He gave him a generous 15$ tip for "old times’ sakes" and patted him on the back, telling him to stay on the right path. The cops in this city seemed oddly focused on getting street kids away from a life of crime.

His last two jobs had him visit Diamond District for the first time. Most of the gang members there appeared to be working together. He had started to be able to tell the different groups apart by color of clothing and type of weaponry but still wasn’t unable to put proper names on each of them.

Once he was done, he was left with 145 dollars in tips, most of it a contribution from the GCPD. Once again, he wondered what kind of financial sponsor they had in this town to afford to have this kind of cash thrown at kids like him.

It didn’t look like they were lacking in funds, though, if he remembered properly. Their weaponry was new, and so were their vehicles, back in the garage. The issue with this city’s crime rate was not police funding, then, it was something else.

His money hidden in between his shoes and his washed out can, he made his way back to Marco’s. Seen from above this way, Gotham was almost beautiful.

Scratch that, it was beautiful. In its own, dark way, the city’s elegant downtown spires and detailed gargoyles had their own charm. It was also unsettling and threatening. All in all, Gotham was a place that divided Peter a lot. Somehow, it seemed to have great evil in it, but he also saw evidence of a lot of solidarity, in some people at least.

Now that he didn’t have to be careful in his running, it only took him twenty or so minutes to make his way through the town. It would have been faster had he been using his web shooters but that was out of the question. He was already glad he hadn’t had to use them earlier, even if that did end with him catching the attention of a clearly unstable and very confusing woman.

Well, she hadn’t seemed cruel or threatening towards him so it should be fine.

He landed softly next to the restaurant, adrenaline slowly leaving his system, leaving him tired and eager to find a place to sleep in. Hopefully, it wouldn’t rain that night.

Marco looked a bit less surprised to see him enter the restaurant this time, but he still did raise an eyebrow. He was drinking again, it was only beer, this time.

"You survived Crime Alley." The man observed.

Peter bristled at that. "You knew I would get jumped?" Anger started to rise in his chest.

Marco barked out a sharp laugh, then drowned his beer in one long gulp. "Kid." He chuckled. "This always happens in Crime Alley, there’s a reason it’s called that way. ‘Sides, if you want to work here, you’re probably going to end up in more dangerous places."

"How? This is a pizza delivery job."

The man glared at him, unamused.

"Don’t act dumb, brat. You wouldn’t have survived in Gotham that long on your own without a bit of brains. This place is the only that delivers in all of Gotham, do you understand what this means?"

Peter sighed.

"It means you get all kind of clients." He replied, crossing his arms. "You don’t reject anyone, right?"

"Exactly." Marco nodded. "I didn’t ask you if you had a gun for nothing. Guess I’m lucky, though, it’s been a while since I had a delivery boy as efficient as you. Most of them usually come back with at least a couple undelivered pizza."

Peter blinked, having not even considered not completing the jobs he was given. He didn’t even know that was an option for him.

"So now, boy, I’m gonna tell you how it’s gonna be, working with me. You’re going to listen and, once I’m done, you’ll tell me what you decide."

Surprised, the teenager nodded, feeling very much out of his depth.

"If you work for me, I will let you make money in a way that isn’t traceable but isn’t harmful to anyone. I will never ask you to commit a crime to complete your job, that’s a promise."

Peter nodded, a bit relieved despite himself. Gotham was so odd, he had been afraid he would be forced to carry a gun or something of the sort.

"However, you need to be aware of the dangers of the job. Most gangs respected us, back in the days. We’re a neutral party. It’s a commercial relationship, get it?"

Peter thought about Gordon and the deal he had just made. He paled. Marco noticed the look on his face and chuckled, shaking his head.

"Don’t worry about old Jimbo. That’s part of our business, we see more things than the usual person does. Stuff that doesn’t mean anything to us but could be very valuable for someone else. I don’t give a shit who you sell it to, as long as you keep me out of it. Do be careful with it, though. Things can go wrong very quickly in this city.
You’ll be risking your life every time you go out. I’m not gonna lie about that, kid. But this is a way for you to get out of the gutter, in a way. If you work with me, I’ll hook you up with a contact of mine who can get you a place to stay in. You’ll have to pay for it, but you’ll be able to afford it and food with what I give you."

He stopped talking for a moment, rubbing his chin, deep in thoughts.

"I can’t understate the risks, boy. Gotham is very dangerous, especially for lonely kids like you. If you can, you should leave town, go somewhere safer."

Peter shook his head. He could, technically, wander away from the city, as nothing truly held him there, but he felt like, once he was done settling down, there was room for him to help. In almost a week, he had heard and been the victim of several assaults, yet still had not encountered any of the city’s dedicated vigilante.

Well, outside of pizza delivery, that was. Either way, it clearly meant they were overworked and couldn’t protect all areas at the same time. Considering most of them were probably regular humans, and not metas, it was more than understandable.

”I’m staying in Gotham. All of this sounds good to me."

Marco sighed.

"You don’t know what kind of place you’ve landed in, kiddo… But you’re good at staying alive, I give you that."

He put a piece of paper down on the table he was sitting at. On it, an address Peter didn’t know.

"It’s in the Bowery," his boss explained. “Go in tomorrow morning and tell her you work for me. Got a deal with her. She’ll set you up."

Peter thanked him profusely, clutching the paper in his hands. A roof for him to sleep under, and a proper roof too. He smiled at Marco, his exhaustion temporarily forgotten.

"Last thing, kid." His boss told him as he rose from his seat. "Try to look more into who you’re dealing with. You should start with old Jimbo you just met earlier."

"You mean officer Gordon?"

"He isn’t just an officer, brat. You need to do your research before selling any info or you’re not going to last long in this city."

Marco didn’t explain his words, limping towards his kitchen after a last goodbye to Peter. The teen was left confused and a bit worried, hoping he hadn’t made a massive mistake with talking to officer-was he even an officer?- Gordon.

Still, despite this, he could rest a bit easier tonight, knowing this was going to be his last without proper housing.

He left the restaurant with a lighter heart, feeling like things were finally starting to fall into place. Dark thoughts tugged at the edge of his mind but, now used to it, he pushed them back. It was easy to distract himself, for the pain, there was so much for him to do here.

Peter jumped up and latched himself on a ladder, which he used to get to higher ground. Ever since he’d started living in Gotham, heights had become his safe place. He knew it wasn’t true, knew plenty of people could still reach him there, but he felt protected up there, in a way he didn’t when he was on the ground. He started making his way back to the Bowery, hoping to find some dry floor to lay on, his last uncomfortable, cold night before he could truly rest.

He was thinking about what kind of place he would end up into, hoping it had some form of plumbing, when a shrill sound burst through the night. He jumped up, startled. To his horror, the sound repeated itself, again and again, in a strange rhythm.

"Shit." Peter whispered. He knew what this was, he remembered it from Barbara’s pamphlet.

It was an emergency siren. The rhythm was meant to help people identify who was the criminal currently threatening the city but, unfortunately for him, he had not yet been able to memorize them.

He went through his bag frantically, trying to burn the siren into his mind in case it turned off before he could find the pamphlet. As soon as his fingers recognized the laminated texture of the pages, he took it out, laying it down on the roof in front of him. The flickering flame of his lighter was his only source of light as he flipped through it, trying desperately to identify what he was dealing with.

Before he could find an answer, a flash of heat made him turn around. As he whipped back, his eyes fell upon a column of flames, a few blocks away from him, stretching up into the clouds.

He almost dropped the pamphlet in surprise.

”Holy shit." He swore, which was definitely a good time to curse, whatever Captain America might think, back home.

To his horror, a man flew up from the flaming building, jets of fire coming from his hands and jet pack. He was too far away for Peter to tell if he was using a weapon or some kind of meta ability but, before he could try to look closer, the arsonist ducked and flew down into the street he was above. More fire shot up in the air.

Suddenly, Peter remembered the criminal’s name.

"Firefly." He recalled, flipping through the pamphlet to reach his page. Fire obsessed arsonist. Used machinery to commit his crimes. Considered highly unstable, he was marked as ‘flee on sight’.

Tired, and without having eaten yet that night, he knew he wasn’t in top shape but, even if he couldn’t defeat the guy, perhaps he could distract him until help came. That seemed feasible.

He took his mask and gloves out of the can, slid them on. His dirty black shirt and shorts went into his bag as he flexed his muscles, trying to get himself motivated before the fight.

His backpack strapped tightly on his back, his web shooters ready, Peter took a running start and leaped in the air. He couldn’t let the fire get too hard to manage, he had to make sure it didn’t spread to the rest of Gotham.

He shot into the night, all pretenses of not being a meta forgotten. His mask was on, he didn’t care who saw him.

Feeling foolish, brave and terrified at the same time, he jumped into the burning street, ready for a dangerous, difficult fight.

He wasn’t disappointed.

Chapter Text

Heat seeped into his suit as Peter got closer to the active crime scene, ramping up in intensity with each blast of flames shooting up into the sky.

He had to save his web fluid for the confrontation. Irresponsibly, he had grown to rely on the Iron Spider suit’s ability to tell him how much he had left in his shooters. It made it hard for him to try and judge how much of the formula remained in the small tanks strapped to his wrists, now that the suit was malfunctioning. A few days earlier, he had taken them out, attempting to guess how much he could still use. 
He remembered estimating he had about ten short swings left. He would have to go with that number, he didn’t have any other choice, really.

Having to rely on his legs and arms to move fast, Peter jumped like he never had before, reaching heights that surprised even himself. With a leap, he cleared two buildings, landing with a roll in the street right next to the inferno Firefly was creating. Warmth crept its way up his cheeks and through his mask. It would have felt comforting, had it not been caused by such a dangerous situation.

Fire. He tried to remember how good the Iron Spider was with it. It wasn’t fully ignifuge, even when powered up. In this state, it would probably only offer him protection for a couple seconds before the flame seeped through and burned him. He needed to be smart about it.

He didn’t, however, have time to stop and strategize. He could hear police sirens, in the distance. It would take them a few minutes to get there, more, if the streets were congested.

Peter crouched lower on the dirty pavement, chest almost touching the ground as he put the palms of his hands flat in the ground.

Then, putting all of his strength into it, he sprung up, wind hitting his face as he cut through the air. In a fraction of a second, he reached the top of the one building row between him and Firefly’s playground. He used the height to try and spot the man.

Bringing his knees up to his chest, ready to flip in any direction if he needed to, Peter smelled the arsonist by the incredible amount of fuel the man was carrying on himself. Fuel and powder. Firearms and flamethrower. He had to be fast, make sure he wasn’t noticed before he attacked.

There was only one way for him to reach that velocity.

Peter flicked his hands forward, engaging his web shooters. As Firefly cackled further  down in the street, hovering over the burned remains of a city bus, Spider-Man latched his strings on the front of the building behind the criminal. The man turned around, alerted by the noise, frowning as the webs stuck themselves to the stone wall, tense as guitar strings.

Nine swings left.

Bringing all of his remaining energy into the move, he clenched his fists against the strings, pulling on them until his muscles screamed. He shot forward, as fast as a bullet, plunging towards Firefly.

Both of his feet crashed into the man’s unguarded back, ripping through his jet pack in an second, hot fuel exploding out of it, coating Peter’s Spider boots with a terrifying hiss. The criminal yelped in surprise, the strength behind the blow enough to shove him into the stone wall, hard enough to make it crack.

Peter’s feet were hurting. A lot.

The fuel had not been ignited but it had still be scaldingly hot, spraying his feet and legs with what felt like hot, fuming lava.

He gagged, shooting another string by reflex to get himself away from the pyromaniac. He landed in a heap on top of a broken down, charred bus. Pain made his vision swim but, when he managed to prop himself up on his shaking arms, he could see that Firefly, too, was standing back up.

The man’s jet pack had been disabled by his first assault, although Peter had not properly thought the maneuver through and gotten himself injured, he at least accomplished something. Unfortunately for him, though, it looked like the suit the man was clad in was not just for show. Now that he was closer, the teenager could clearly see that this wasn’t a silly costume but a full blown battle suit.

A pyromaniac armed with dozens of weapons, if the ones on his belt and in his hands were any indication, and an intact armor, Firefly was still dangerous, even stranded on the ground.

Having to react quickly, Peter didn’t leave himself time to hesitate and bent forward, grabbing his Spider Boots and tearing them away from his feet. As he has suspected, the fabric and plastic in it had started to melt into his skin. Blood spread on the blackened bus roof as his skin ripped apart. Tears sprung to his eyes but still, he forced himself back up.

Despite all the suffering he has just gone through, it had barely been thirty seconds since he first jumped into the battle. He couldn’t give up right now.

On the other side of the street, Firefly had spotted him. The man screamed curses at him, grabbing the broken, battered remains of his jet pack and-

Uh oh.

Using his third web shot, Peter managed to snatch the jet pack from the air as it was hurled at him, twisting around to swing it around himself. The weight pulled at his shoulders as the machine swung around him but it was easily manageable. He had lifted heavier things.

"What the-" Firefly managed before his jet pack came back to hit him in the face. The man grunted but, somehow, managed to stay standing. What kind of armor was he wearing? There was barely a scratch on it, after everything Peter threw at him.

This was exactly why he didn’t want to intervene as Spider-Man this soon, he didn’t have enough information about this world and the people inhabiting it. He barely even knew enough about this fire guy to fight him properly.

"Cocky brat." Firefly grumbled, as Peter lowered his hands to the warm, warped metal he was crouching on. He leaned forward, putting most of his own weight onto his arms and shoulders, to give his feet a break. Blood had stopped pouring out of the open skin, and he could feel a familiar scratchy sensation start to settle in his toes and ankles.

His healing factor was kicking in.

"You with the bat?” Firefly asked him, reaching down to his belt to pluck what appeared to be several different types of grenades. Peter gulped, feeling extremely out of his depth.

The police sirens were getting closer and, over the traffic, he could hear the loud roar of an engine he assumed was some form of fortified vehicle. One mile away, he thought, maybe a bit less. He had to hold on for just a bit longer…

"Can’t say I’ve met the Big Man yet," Peter replied, hoping to buy himself some time before having to dodge the explosives.

"Hm.” Firefly said, looking down at the grenades in his hands. "This won’t work on you."

He said it with an alarming amount of confidence, as if he had already figured him out. His scowl at Peter slowly morphed into a smirk. He raised bis hands, twirling the grenades in between his fingers.

Then, he turned around and hurled them further down the street, at a still unlit blocky building. Over the roaring of the flames, Peter could hear panicked whispering coming from it. His heart skipped a beat, horror chilling his blood.

"That’s not fair!" He snapped at the arsonist as he aimed his web shooters. He couldn’t just send web bullets at the grenades, that would only serve to either make them explode or push them further towards the civilians.

Seeing no other option, he spent another of his six remaining swings to grab two of the explosives off of the air. He wouldn’t be fast enough to get all of them, he realized. Gritting his teeth under the mask, wishing he still had access to the full range of the Iron Spider’s abilities, he whipped his arms up, launching the two grenades he’d grabbed into the air. He let the strings go, moments before they were torn apart by the explosion.

His heart sunk in his chest as the two other explosives he had not managed to divert crashed into the front of the building. Screams erupted from behind the windows as flames started to creep out of the blast. The walls began to shake.

A crunching sound to his left-way too close- forced him to tear his gaze away to snap his head to the side. Shit. He’d been stupid.

He forgot he was in a fight! 

Firefly grinned at him from the other side of the bus’ roof, fire already launching straight in his direction. He had a flame thrower in one hand, in the other…

Peter plunged to the side, off of the bus and into the street. The fire singed his suit, warming the metallic parts and making them sear his skin. The arsonist laughed hysterically and followed his jump with the nozzle of his flamethrower. Fire found him once again, hitting his shoulders, back and head. The small fabric parts of his suit started to burn too.

He was in so much pain.

Forcing himself to his still bleeding feet-the fast forming scabs had been ripped when he had jumped- trying to ignore the pain from his back and legs, he leaped up. Higher than the bus, higher than the buildings.

Where the flames couldn’t get him.

He arched his back, trying to control his position and trajectory. Scalding hot metal burned into his shoulder blades and spine. He gasped.

Firefly was yelling at him, but Peter didn’t listen. He felt like time was slowing down, although he knew that it was only a side effect of adrenaline. Ever since he had been bitten, the chemical had had more effect on him than it did before, helping him tremendously when he ended up in a fight.

He opened his hands, readying his web shooters. This would be a difficult maneuver to pull off, he had to be focused.

As he shot his fifth strings of the night, he could hear vehicles driving into the nearby streets. The pavement crunched under the weight of too heavy tires. Did they bring the tank with them? 
He did not have time to think about it, his attack had already started, he couldn’t abort it. His webs stuck to the street, one on each side of the bus. Firefly looked surprised at that, then smirked, nudging the nozzle of his weapon upwards.

Peter launched himself at him, heading full speed towards his death. As soon as he gained momentum, he let go of the webs, twisting his whole body to turn his back to the flamethrower. He felt the fire brush at the remains of his suit, but, as he was about to fall into it, he shot his sixth string, tugging himself to the side with unnatural speed.

He landed on the wall with a loud thump, sticking to the stone with his hands and feet, feeling himself sink a little into the cracked surface due to the impact.

Blood spurted from his damaged feet, but he didn’t want to let this opportunity go. He had moved fast, so fast, in fact, that Firefly hadn’t been able to follow his position.

Pushing further into the stone wall, he launched himself at the criminal, this time aiming for his exposed back. The jet pack being gone, he could see leather straps where it had been, no doubt used to secure it to the body armor. An idea formed in his mind.

Just as he was struck with inspiration, he hit Firefly straight in the mid back, shoving his arms under the man’s armpit and brutally bringing them up, locking them around his shoulders. He then twisted his muscles slightly, leading to a loud, sinister crack.

Firefly yelled in pain as both of his arms broke at the shoulder, he did not waver though, attempting to push Peter away with his legs. He was still holding the flamethrower, with the trigger pushed, and fire was spreading at their feet, slowly heating up the metal they were standing on. The teenager’s battered feet throbbed in agony. If he didn’t know about his enhanced healing, he would probably be afraid of suffering nerve damage from this kind of abuse.

Not wanting to damage them even more, he jumped up, pushing his feet into Firefly’s back, tugging his broken arms back as he kicked him. The man groaned again. Down the street, Peter could still hear screams. 
Thankfully, he noticed, as he jumped down and landed on the villain’s back, pushing his head into the ground, the police was there now, he could hear the tank rolling into the street, and-

Wait.

Raising his head in horror, Peter looked at the end of the street, fully expecting an army of police officer to be there at the ready, guns drawn, ready to fire. For a second, he felt like he was back in New York.

The illusion shattered quickly, however, as his eyes landed not on the police vehicles he had seen the day before but, instead, a monstrous beast of a car. Solid black, it roared as it came full speed towards them. It looked like a mix between a sleek racing car and a military tank, due to the heavy armor spread all across its body.

It did not look like it was going to slow down.

Peter yelped, now afraid he was going to be run over by a rogue tank. Firefly’s suit was black too, maybe this was his car. He punched the arsonist’s face into the ground once again, then jumped away. Immediately, his eyes fell on the burning building he had failed to save.

Not paying attention to see if Firefly was running or not, he spent a seventh swing to make his way as fast as possible to the crumbling house. He could still hear coughing and whimpering inside. It was, however, a lot fainter than the screams from earlier.

He bit back a wave of guilt, swinging through a broken window, passing through a sheet of flames, that finished completely charring his suit, then rolled into a corridor. Family pictures were put all around the walls, bringing back bitter memories. No time.

He followed the whimpers through another wall of flames, kicking open a collapsed door as he entered what appeared to have once been a bedroom. There, crouching under a desk, faces smeared with tears and soot, two children were cowering.

He stepped towards them. One of them, a girl with frizzy black hair and an angelic face, spotted him and shrieked in terror. Peter didn’t even hesitate, ripping off his mask and raising his hands. 

“It’s fine. It’s fine. I’m a human like you. I’m here to help."

A loud crack sounded behind him, and he could feel the floor start to shake. He had to get the kids out. Fire was already spreading into the room from the opened door. He spotted a window, walked towards it. Smoke was starting to get to his head, giving him a headache.

He tried to pull the window up, only to realized it was locked. A child safety mechanism, no doubt.

He forced the thing up anyways, causing it to groan loudly. The sudden rush of air from the outside made the fire gain in speed. It had almost reached the desk.

Not caring if he was scaring them anymore, Peter scooped up the children, one under each arm, and jumped through the window, sticking his feet to the closest building. This one was starting to catch fire too. He cursed.

He couldn’t drop the kids in the street, not while Firefly was still there. He could hear police officers driving down the next road over. He would drop them here, then.

Running up the wall, hoping to make it fast enough so he could run back and try to rescue someone else, he jumped above ruined houses and slowly spreading flames. The girl hadn’t stopped screaming, her sibling, a lot younger than her, was shaking and crying violently.

He landed away from any fires, trying to look around for any sort of officer. To his relief, he could see a group of a dozen or so cars clumping together towards the entrance of the flaming alley. Police officers in full body armor were slowly creeping into the battle zone. Peter nodded, sliding his mask back on, jostling one of the little ones as he did so.

He jumped again, landing behind the police barricade. The screaming girl made the nearby officers start and quite a few of them trailed their weapons on them.

"Drop the kids." Someone barked. Peter immediately obeyed. They were taking him for a villain. No good.

Not wanting to get shot after just surviving through a violent beating, he threw himself in the air, swinging away, feeling from the weight that his web fluid tanks were almost empty.

He catapulted himself above the chaotic scene, narrowly dodging a volley of bullets as some officers shot at him as he escaped. Alright. Time to flee the place.

He made his way back to the roof he had started his attack on, a few blocks away from the battle ground. Nobody followed him, and he could hear a few explosions going off in the distance. He had been right to stick to higher spots, as it seemed like the whole street had been littered with traps and explosives.

Back on the roof, he picked up the battered sneakers, grabbing the 100$ bill hidden in them with trembling hands. His backpack was gone, burned away by the flames. His food, his clothes, even the pamphlet Barbara gave him.

Suddenly, he remembered the building, the people still trapped in it. He turned around, heart thumping, but the explosions had stopped, and he could hear firemen bells ringing. He breathed out shakily, ears ringing.

Slowly, he got to his knees, tugged his mask off, put his forehead on the cold stone.

He was crying. He could taste salt and blood. Ashes and fuel.

What kind of villain was this? In the middle of a fight, he had used human lives to distract him. And Peter had been to weak to save them. He only got two children out, not even their parents. He failed them too. He hadn’t had to face this kind of person before, his enemies certainly hadn’t been honorable, but they hadn’t been so…

… vicious. Evil. Twisted.

He shook his head. He always tried to see the reasons behind people’s actions, there was a reason behind every decision. There had to be some form of story behind Firefly’s behavior.

Still, he couldn’t bring himself to understand him. He hated him, he realized. This was why he broke his arms, why he smashed his face into the ground so brutally. He hated this man who destroyed innocent lives just to get a tiny advantage on him.

Was this how it was, in Gotham? Were all of the rogues like this?

He rose slowly back to a sitting position, crossing his legs, hanging his head low. There was a greater evil in this place than he had thought. He had to help in some way, he had to-

His back burned and ached, most of the Iron Spider suit melted into his skin. He would have to tear it away, bit by bit. His feet had stopped bleeding, the pain still terrible enough to make his head spin.

He couldn’t stay there, he had to leave before someone found him. He didn’t want to be shot at again.

He limped away, feeling numb.

He was right. Getting involved without proper information on Gotham’s rogues was a mistake, if he hadn’t done it, maybe those people would still be alive.

"I’m so sorry." He whispered to the wind. "I wish I could have saved you."

Silence was the only answer to his sobs.
Chapter 7: After the long night
Summary:

    Peter is still reeling from the Firefly encounter and tries to get back on track.

Chapter Text

The sun was high in the sky when Peter finally made his way over to the address Marco had given him. Just like everything else, it had been in his bag when it went up in flames, but he had been able to eventually remember enough details to find it in the Bowery.

He had had to resort to thievery to hide his injuries and his destroyed spider suit, grabbing clothes off of the lines that were forgotten outside. He didn’t have much choice in the matter and ended up with straight black pants that were slightly too big for him and a blue hoodie with a large S on its back.

He felt absolutely awful for the theft, memorizing the address he had taken the clothes at, determined to wash them and bring them back as soon as he could. In his sneakers, the only thing that had survived his fight with Firefly, he could feel his feet ache and itch as the skin grew back over his wounds. Regular humans would form scar tissue but he knew from experience that, although he could scar, it never stayed for longer than a few weeks, and that was for the worst of injuries.

His face was still a mess, a public bathroom full of drunks and passed out adults was the only washing up he got that day. He could feel that some of the cuts on his brows and forehead hadn’t closed yet, his healing focusing on the worst injuries first.

His back, by far, hurt the most. The skin hadn’t regrown over it yet, leaving it tender and irritated. He wouldn’t get an infection, that was almost impossible for him, but he had been in so much pain that he hadn’t managed to sleep that night. Exhaustion was like a heavy weight on his bruised shoulders, making him drag his feet, hang his head low.

He still had to go on though, learn from his mistakes and become a better person. His family and friends would have wanted that for him and, even if he would never see them again, he didn’t want to disappoint them in case there was indeed an afterlife. He wanted to be able to face his parents, Ben, May and Tony, and be satisfied with what he had done in his life.

He wasn’t proud of the previous night’s events. He had acted recklessly and, as a result, caused the deaths of civilians. If he had waited a few more minutes, the police would have arrived in time to stop Firefly. 
He had done nothing but make the situation worse.

He would not go back out as Spider-Man. Not until he had learned everything there was to know about Gotham, just like he did with New York, back home. He needed to learn the streets and the buildings, the criminal situation and the various vigilantes he could encounter.

For once, he was walking down the streets of the Bowery. He didn’t have a weapon anymore, the taser Nightwing gave him had disappeared alongside the rest of his supplies. He had been hungry all day.

People didn’t bother him. His knuckles were dirty, full of blood and grime, and his face was set in a mask of stone. He melded in with the crowd of this district, as if he was one of them.

Could a city really change someone this fast?

But then, it wasn’t just the city, was it? It was everything that had happened recently, with Mysterio, M-J and May. It was everything that had happened before, too, when Thanos almost destroyed them all.

The street he was in was long and sinuous, the address he’d been given being at the very end of it, blocking the path, turning the alley into a dead-end. He looked up at it. It was large, ancient. One of those classic gothic buildings spread around Gotham. It was in a remarkably good state, for the Bowery.

He knocked at the door.

Inside, he heard shuffling, then grumbling. The door opened slowly, an eye peeking through the gap in the door before he heard a loud sigh, and it was opened fully.

In front of him stood an old woman, wrinkled with time. Her features were East Asian, her hair a bright silver. She spoke slowly but sharply, an air of authority in her voice.

"You’re the new Marco’s delivery boy, I assume?" She narrowed her eyes at him. "You kids always look the same."

He nodded, not knowing if he was able to speak in his current state. She rolled her eyes.

"Come on in. Did Amelio explain the deal?"

"Amelio?" Peter echoed, not understanding. He stepped after her, into the entrance hall. Some mailboxes were sat on the left side of the room, quite a few of them busted open, and a staircase could be seen further into a corridor, going both up and down. Despite its intimidating exterior, the inside was very mundane.

"Since you work for him, you get to choose between one of the two attic rooms. They come with a mattress and a private bathroom. Electricity comes on at 7pm and turns off at 3am. The heat is on from December to February." The strange woman told him, waving him forward.

She led him up the stairway and he followed, body aching with every step. As they moved, she kept talking :

"You can get hot water from 8pm to 10pm and 5pm to 7pm. Otherwise, I turn the gas off. There are no cooking appliances or cutlery in the units."

They climbed up the spiral staircase, Peter noting that, even though there were plenty of apartments there-three per landing in a ten story tall building-, there were no names anywhere. So, this was this kind of establishment.

"No illegal activities can go on within those walls. This includes dealing, kidnapping, murder, sexual assault and terrorism. Arson and any other kind of violent crimes are also forbidden. If you think the cops are on your back, you can’t stay until it’s cleared."

Peter nodded, throat tightening, wondering where he had ended up. He could hear movement in several of the apartments, where those people all criminals?

"Rent for you is only 10 a day, since you work for Amelio. There is a communal kitchen you can use in the basement, as well as a laundry room. Cannibalism is banned, if you want to use the machines to wash blood, make sure to decontaminate the inside with isopropyl alcohol or another form of disinfectant and wash it off with water before leaving."

Peter decided there and then that he would try to avoid his neighbors as much as possible. He did need housing desperately, but it sounded like he had ended up in a criminal hiding place.

They walked in silence to the attic, which only had two apartments in it, one on each side.

”This one," the woman said, pointing to the door on the left. "Has a television and a closet." She then pointed to the right. "This one has a radio and a desk."

"I’ll take the desk." Peter replied immediately. He had never been one for TV anyways, and he needed a place to do his research.

"Very well." The woman nodded. After a moment, she added, politely : “You may call me Xiuying."

"I’m Peter,” he told her in answer. He felt bad for not being as friendly and enthusiastic as he usually was, but the night had been long and the only think he could think about was that he couldn’t wait to take a shower. Then, he would collapse in his bed and try to sleep.

Seeing her held out hand, he blushed, digging into the stolen hoodie’s pocket. She frowned at the 100$ bill, but did not comment on it. She probably had been paid in much weirder means before.

"Can I have some of it back? I need to buy food." He asked her, too tired to be overly polite. She nodded curtly, businesslike, and took three crisp ten dollar bills out of her purse. He exchanged them thankfully, handing over his hundred.

"Very well, Peter. Rent is covered for the week. Now, keep your head down and don’t attract attention to this place."

She shoved a small metal key into his hand then left without any other words, leaving him to stare at it in silence. A place for him to sleep in. A place he could even lock the door of.

It felt supremely weird, stepping into the little apartment all on his own, without May by his side. They had moved a lot and he remembered that feeling of opening the door to some empty, dreary room, but still believing they could make it into a home because, at least, they were together.

It took all that he had not to punch through the wall, but he contained himself. Instead, he toured the small room, eyes taking in every details.

There was indeed a mattress on the floor, separated from the rest of the room by a dark curtain, that could be pulled back and tied to the wall if need be. Just as Xiuying had explained, there was no cooking appliances, not even a table.

There was however, a little desk, standing by one of the two windows in the room. Made out of wood, it appeared to be of surprisingly good quality, considering the neighborhood. A small radio sat on top of it, turned off.

The only other thing in the apartment, aside from those two areas, was a door that, when he pushed, led him to a cramped little bathroom with a shower and a toilet seat. Of course, there were no towels or soap.

He did spot a mirror above the sink, which somehow fit in between the toilet and the shower cabinet. He stepped forward, looking up at his reflection. He looked exhausted and dirty, his eyes seemed like they had been punched, with how dark the circles under them were.

With a sigh, he stripped off his sticky, dirty clothes, shivering when the fabric brushed the flesh of his back.

The shower was cold and short. Despite not having any soap, he managed to scrub off a lot of the blood and soot that had stained his body. He came out into the main room, drying his hair with the blue hoodie, feeling too exhausted to even stand on his own two feet.

Staggering, he walked over to the mattress, lowering himself down on it.

He was out cold in an instant.

His dreams were harsh and cruel, full of screaming, crying and whimpering.

Over and over, he watched as fire burned through his skin, leaving him a charred carcass, barely able to breathe. Before he could die, however, he was dragged into the ground, suffocating on the dirt. Cold fingers wrapped around his ankles, stopping him from clawing his way out.

When he looked down, May’s decomposing face smiled at him sweetly, a parody of the gentle looks she used to give him, just before ruffling his hair or hugging him.

He tried to grab her hand, go further down into the dirt, even if it meant dying. As soon as he reached her, however, her face morphed into a cruel smile and her features melted away, replaced by the scarred face of an armor clad man.

"Why won’t you burn, Peter?" The man asked conversationally. "Why won’t you burn burn burn-"

The litany echoed in his head, and the only thing he could do to fight it was curl up in a ball, putting his hand on his ears to try and block out the words. The smell of burning flesh reached his nose, it didn’t know if it was coming from him.

He woke up with a gasp, sitting up violently. His head throbbed and his throat was paper-dry. He needed a drink.

After stumbling into the bathroom to down the equivalent of a few glasses of blessedly clean running water, Peter straightened up, glancing at himself in the mirror. The cuts on his face were gone, so was the pain in his feet.

He looked down at them, unsurprised to see them perfectly smooth and intact. His back, however, still hurt terribly.

Of course, he needed more food to heal a wound as big as this.

Distantly, he wondered how long he had slept. It looked like the sun was still shining, so he did not miss work. He walked over to the nearest window, pulling open the blinds.

Ah.

He had slept through work.

The sun was far too low for it to be anything else than morning, and the smells in the streets, coffee and bread mixing with smoke and sweat, confirmed his suspicions. He sighed. Good job, Peter, not even a week into a new gig and he already blew it.

His stomach twisted painfully and he forced himself to get out of his daze. He needed to take care of himself, build his strength back up. There was no point in letting himself die.

So, even though he felt empty to his core, Peter put his stolen clothes back on, grabbed the rest of his money, his keys, and stepped out of his shady new apartment. His shoulder hurt when he closed the door behind him, he needed to be careful, he was pushing close to his limits.

Stepping out into the street, he could tell something was different in the atmosphere. The usual Gotham gloominess had magnified somehow, making the city appear even darker than it had before. Civilians walked with their heads slightly down, eyes darting over left, right. He could smell fear in the air.

Was this a result of the Firefly incident? In a flash, he remembered the smell of fuel, the heat on his back. He had to stop, close his eyes and take a few deep breaths before he could keep moving.

Peter wandered around until he found a convenience store that looked like he wouldn’t get stabbed if he stepped into it. In there, he grabbed two large sandwiches, a bottle of soda, and some chips. It wasn’t healthy, it was probably too expensive for what it was worth, but he didn’t care. He needed something to make himself feel better.

He started tearing through the first sandwich almost right away, heading to a back street to make his way up a house, using it to launch himself a bit higher, at a little administrative building. The roofs still felt safe to him, his ability to get to high ground quickly was the only thing that had saved him during his fight against Firefly. He needed to adapt to his surroundings better, needed to learn how to fight on the ground.

If only he hadn’t been so reckless.

The roofs took him down the now familiar path to the Gotham Public Library. He thought about going in, maybe talking to Barbara, before realizing she didn’t even know him that well, and probably would find it creepy.

He was alone. It was hard to remember that, sometimes.

With a sigh, he elected to use the fact he was now in a slightly richer district of Gotham to look around for a hardware store. He only had 20$ left, but he hoped to be able to find some tools that would help him dismantle what was left of the Iron Spider. If he was right, there would be useful components in it.

Turning away from the public library, he walked the streets for a good hour before finding what he was looking for. With his small electronic kit in hand, which he had to spend all of his money on, and only contained four different hand tools, he headed back to the Bowery.

He could hear conversations around him, could see headlines on newspaper, could make it out from the radios of passing cars, Firefly was on everyone’s mind. Apparently, he had been gone for quite a while before being spotted, and had used that time to plant explosives around the city.

He hoped nobody else died that night because of his foolishness. He tried to ignore the advertisement screens. Several of them were talking about a mysterious meta that had clashed with the arsonist.

"Friend or Foe : Unidentified meta defeats Firefly" a sodden newspaper front page welcomed him as he stepped on top of a grocery store. He picked it up and crushed it in his fist. He did not defeat anyone. There was no victory in what had happened that night.

By mid-afternoon, he was back in his small apartment, sitting on the wood floor and staring at the destroyed Iron Spider. His last memory of Mr Stark, of Tony. It was in shreds, now, the back melted and torn, chunks of it strewn around the main body of the suit. He had a few hours to work on it before he had to head out to convince his boss to let him keep his job, but he couldn’t bring himself to.

Every time he lowered the scissors to the fabric or tried to pull some components out with tweezers, memories overtook him. His first missions, meeting the Avengers, fighting alongside Iron Man.

In the end, he had to slide off the anti-static wristband he had gotten to make sure he wouldn’t accidentally destroy components, and push back his tinkering. He felt nauseous whenever he thought about taking the suit apart.

He hoped Marco wouldn’t fire him from the delivery job, as he was now short on cash again. If he kept it, he just had to keep his head down, learn as much as he could and, once he was ready, come out to patrol again.

The only issue was that he wasn’t sure if he would ever be ready again.
Chapter 8: Bouncing back
Chapter Text

Peter was not fired from his job.

Instead, Marco sat him down, handing him a brand new pizzeria hoodie. This one smelled fresh and, when he changed in the bathroom, it fit him perfectly.

"You were there during the Firefly attack." His boss told him as he came out of the Men’s room.

He didn’t try to deny it, nodding silently instead, hoping he wouldn’t be asked anymore questions. The events were so fresh in his mind, the memory so raw, that he doubted he could think about it for too long before breaking down.

"First time, I assume?" Marco said, after his statement was left unanswered. "It happens once every couple of months, one of them showing up."

Peter shivered. "Every few months?” He repeated, feeling numb.

"They break out. Did anybody give you that paper Gordon made?"

He didn’t answer, not knowing what the older man was talking about, looking at his hands instead. His boss sighed, limping away to the kitchen and coming back with a beer. He didn’t offer one to Peter, which was alright. He didn’t even like alcohol anyways.

"I thought not." Marco grumbled. "I’ll get you one tomorrow, if you decide to stay."

"What do you mean?"

Cutting through the numbness that had been affecting him all day, surprise sprung in his mind. He looked up, confused. As an answer, he was given a sad smile then, after the adult had taken a swig of his bottle :

"Kid. When I called in yesterday night and heard you had showed up to the Bowery smelling like smoke and fuel, looking like you had been beaten up by the Bat himself, I thought I was never going to see you again, thought you’d take the first train back to New York."

Peter couldn’t even afford a ticket if he wanted to.

"There’s nothing for me up there." He sighed instead. "I already told you I don’t have a choice."

The man hung his head, something cloudy flashing through his eyes. It was easy to recognize, as someone who was in the throes of it.

It was grief.

He could have asked, could have tried to comfort him. He lacked the energy, though. Even though it was now cold and dreary, he still felt the heat of the flames against his back.

Marco raised his head again, looking at him for a long time. Peter squirmed uneasily, hoping he wasn’t acting suspicious.

The man did throw him a question, but it wasn’t about Firefly:

"What’s your name, kid?" He asked him, looking like it pained him greatly to do so.

It looked like his answer was important to him so, still a bit shaken, Peter told him the truth. It earned him a nod.

"Alright Peter, time to get to work, then." His boss grunted, darkness still on his face, barely suppressed.

Fourteen deliveries that night, more than he ever had before. Either the word was getting around that Marco’s was open for business again, and old regulars wanted to rekindle their habits, or the recent arson attack and subsequent explosions had scared civilians into hiding out inside and relying on delivery.

He would have to split it into two trips, his pizza bag being only able to fit eight boxes maximum. He carefully placed his first load into the backpack, then slid it on.

He cringed as he felt the heat of the freshly made pizza seep into his back. It was not painful, only deeply unsettling. He used to see the warmth as a form of comfort, before Firefly, but now it felt nauseating.

Peter took a few deep, calming breaths. He did not have a choice. This place helped him get an apartment without asking questions and was allowing him to make money in a way that didn’t contradict his ideals. This wasn’t something that looked to be very common in Gotham.
He was going to have to get over this new issue, even if the fight had only been a couple days ago and fresh in his mind, he needed the cash. More than that, he needed the distraction. Thinking about having to sit down alone, in front of the broken Iron Spider, with nothing else to do but reminisce about the past, made him want to puke.

Despite his aching, itching back, his body answered him more easily than he would have thought, with how terrible he felt. It distressed him a little bit, how rapidly his strength had come back as soon as he had started eating more.

He already knew that his metabolism required him to consume more calories than the average person, but he could truly feel the change in his body as he slowly got his living situation sorted out. His senses were sharper, his body more flexible, powerful.

Getting to sleep on a proper mattress, with the relative safety of a locked door and closed blinds, the sound of cars coming from behind surprisingly thick walls, had also helped tremendously. His back was the only reminder of what happened barely a couple days ago. He felt completely fine otherwise.

He should feel grateful to be able to physically bounce back so fast, but he wasn’t. He couldn’t help but remember the burning building, the crying children…

The terrible snap, as he broke Firefly’s arms.

It was terrifying, thinking about it. As he slowly climbed up a service ladder, not wanting to be spotted jumping around too close to the pizzeria, he realized something disturbing. Lately, he had fought a lot of people who were augmented in some way, "metas", as people called them here. Sandman, that weird doctor lizard… they had been able to handle his strength. He also knew how to pull his punch with smaller, street level criminals, it had become almost instinctual to him.

Unfortunately, he wasn’t used to having to restrain his strength when fighting for his life. The most influential villains in this town were mostly regular humans but somehow most of them had the ability to be dangerous even without any special power, Firefly was the living proof of that. He would need to learn very carefully who was or was not a meta among the rogues.
If Spider-Man came back… when Spider-Man came back, he couldn’t go around breaking people’s bones.

It was simple : Breaking regular people’s bones was a slippery slope towards using his strength irresponsibly. It could end up with him causing grievous injury to someone accidentally, could degenerate into something even worse.

Peter would never let that happen. If he had been more cool-headed, he could have used his strength more wisely, finishing off the man earlier. Then, he might have managed to save more people.

His GPS led him deep into an area he hadn’t visited before, although he didn’t notice it right away, too deep in his own thoughts. Eventually, though, the change in building style perplexed him enough that he stopped running and looked around, frowning.

This part of town had a lot of red tiled roofs, vegetation but, also, verticality. Houses seemed to stack on top of each other, forming small towers. Some of them almost looked like fortresses, with cameras on their walls and what seemed to be look-outs. It was strikingly different from the white stone gothic architecture found in the rest of Gotham.

He hummed thoughtfully, wishing he had memorized more of the city’s areas. He was clearly in a different kind of district than the one he has just left. Instead of small groups of men and women, most of them visibly part of a gang, the people here were dressed more discreetly, although almost all of them were carrying guns.

Organized crime? Maybe. He would have to spend more time at the library to get a clear idea of what was going on. He was kind of looking forward to it.

A chill went down his spine as the heat of the pizzas reminded him of his situation. He shouldn’t be wasting time sight-seeing, he had a job to do, and he needed to earn money.

His first delivery took him not too far away, to another red-tiled building, covered in moss and small plants. He smiled unconsciously. Gotham seemed good at finding ways to surprise him, in small ways, he hadn’t expected there to be so much green down there, but it was heartening, in such a big city.

His good mood soured quite a bit after he got a gun pulled on him, yet again, by his first clients.

"Sorry, sorry…" One of them laughed apologetically, once they figured out he was just a delivery boy. "We thought you were someone else."

The one good side to this encounter was the large 20$ tip they left him. He still ran as fast as he could once he got out of view. Nobody in this town respected basic gun safety rules, their trigger discipline was absolutely awful and he wanted as little to do with it as possible.

The next three deliveries were uneventful, excluding the fact that, for two of them, he had to climb up one of the strange towers and pass the boxes through the window to the clients. Both times, the people inside had been wearing an alarmingly large number of weapons.

When his GPS led him out of this odd district and back into the familiar chaos of the Bowery, Peter felt relief wash over him. At least he knew more about this part of Gotham, and where to find shelter there.

Oh. Right. He didn’t need to find shelter anymore, he had an apartment now. It felt odd, thinking that he would be going back somewhere specific after his shift and not just wander around until he found a free spot to try and rest at.

The next pizza took him to a basement apartment, whose heavy, metallic door was slowly opened by a middle-aged bespectacled man. He glanced up at Peter, a frown on his face.

"Pizza?" Peter offered, pushing the box forward.

That earned him an incredulous look, as if the man had expected him to say something entirely different. That was a bit hard to understand, considering he had a huge pizza bag poking out from each side of his body.

"… sure…" The man eventually whispered, pushing up his glasses with a gloved hand. The thing appeared made out of green velvet of all things, which made Peter grimace, thinking about the pizza grease that was about to stain it.

The man kept the door opened even after the pizza was handed over to him. He looked genuinely surprised, still.

"So… Marco’s is open again?"

Ah, probably an old regular then. Maybe the pizzeria went on break for longer than what he had originally thought. He had assumed the owner’s injury was the reason for the temporary closure, but that had obviously been a recent development and everyone had been acting so surprised to see him that he was starting to wonder how long their hiatus had truly been.

"Uh-… yeah. Since a couple days ago."

The man nodded, his shoulders jerking with each head movement, his whole body tense and sharp. He looked down at the box in his hands, then back at Peter.

”Do you… want to play a game?” He asked eventually, lips twitching slightly, sometimes heading up, sometimes down.

"Ah… I’m sorry… I still have more pizza to deliver."

"Don’t worry, don’t worry. I will make it brief. You can even stay outside."

Peter, who had not even considered entering the basement apartment of an odd man who lived behind a bunker door, smiled politely. The civilian obviously took that as an agreement, beaming at him.

"Alright alright… If you can solve my riddle, I will give you ten dollars. If you can’t, I will give you five."

It seemed like a supremely convoluted way of handling money but Peter didn’t want to complain. He was now going off the assumption that every single person in Gotham except him owned and carried a firearm of some sort and, without exception, they all had terrible trigger discipline.

Therefore, making sure they didn’t recklessly point a firearm at him was going to be one of his main goals, even if he had to go through some loops to keep in their good grace.

"Sure." He said, "Gimme your worst."

"Alright, alright… Let’s see…" The man rubbed his chin with his free hand, also gloved in green, still holding the pizza in his other hand. He straightened up as inspiration seemed to have struck him and he asked, smiling as he did so: "What goes through cities and fields… yet never moves?"

Peter had heard that one before which was a bummer, but the poor guy looked so invested in his game that he pretended to think about it for a while, which made the man grin.

"A road." He said after faking working through the puzzle mentally. His answer earned him a round of applause from the man.

"Pretty tough, uh?" The stranger smirked.

"Yeah!" Peter lied, accepting the bill he was handed. "Thank you sir."

The man happily waved at him, before slowly dragging the metal door closed. The boy could hear it click over and over again as multiple locks fell into place. More odd clanking came from inside, adding to the oddness of the whole encounter.

This was definitely a close contender for the weirdest interaction he had had while delivering food, but Harley still took the crown. At least, no guns had been involved this time, he was making progress.

He went back to the roofs, feeling uncomfortable staying so close to the ground for too long. Five deliveries accomplished, nine more to go.

Gotham was such an odd town, he thought, tapping a new address into his GPS. People in there seemed to be an entirely different brand of eccentric, compared to what he was used to. And he thought he was odd for dressing up as a spider and going out to beat up criminals after school.

He followed the directions from the device, eventually crossing a sign reading "Crown Point", at one of the main intersections. It had been decorated with little skulls and Peter though he could smell some blood around it. This was such a lovely way to set the mood.

The GPS led him into a dark alleyway, which he couldn’t help but sigh at. He was probably to get jumped again, wasn’t he? He missed the edge his Spider sense used to give him in those kinds of situations. It still hadn’t come back, even after getting sleep and two sandwiches.

Maybe he should try getting more sleep and more sandwiches, maybe it was a puberty thing, maybe he just had no clue how to bring it back. He wished he could figure it out, its absence was making him feel even more acutely how useful of a tool it was.

He could barely hear any breathing inside of the alleyway, and it was coming from a single person. He stepped forward, missing the taser Nightwing had given him. Without it, it was going to be hard to defend himself without using too much strength.

"Hey! Up there!" A voice called.

He jumped, looking towards the sky. There, sitting on a broken down lamppost, a shadowed figure peered down at him. Peter frowned, wondering how he was supposed to hand them their food.

He ended up walking around, searching for an inconspicuous way up, eventually finding a ladder that, if he used a running start, he could probably reach while still pretending to be an ordinary teenager.

He did so easily, smoothly making his way up the rusted metal and closer to the stranger’s level. Said stranger stood up on their spot, then turned and jumped in his direction, landing on a window ledge right next to him.

"Don’t worry," they said, "I’ll get it from your backpack."

Even for him, it was hard to see the person’s features in the darkness, but Peter thought they appeared young, probably around his age, or perhaps a bit older. He thought he could make out a familiar domino mask on their eyes and nose, but couldn’t get a close enough look to be sure. The build was all wrong for this to be Nightwing, though, and the voice was also completely off.

Just like they said they would, the stranger opened his pizza bag, taking great care not to let any box fall out. Peter heard them slide the top one out.

"I honestly didn’t think you’d come," he heard next, as they shuffled away from him after sliding a bill in the pocket of his hoodie. "Nobody delivers here usually. Guess things are changing."

They left before he could say anything, using some kind of rope-a grappling hook, maybe?- to move faster. Peter waited until the sound of them zipping away faded into the distance before he discarded the ladder and, carefully, stuck his way up to the roof. Honestly, crawling up walls was much better.

The rest of his night was extremely relaxing, when compared to those first few deliveries. He only got jumped once more, which he handled by grabbing the knife he was being threatened with before it was fully raised, and tugging it out of its owners hands. He then finished him off by grabbing him by the collar and throwing him into a dumpster. As a punishment, and also because he needed it, he kept the knife.

"What the fuck?" He heard as the man went flying, making him worry he might have been a bit unsubtle about his super strength in this specific case. He didn’t stick around long enough to find out just how much, heading back to his route, eager to finish his shift and head back to the apartment.

In total, if he added his tips to his salary from Marco’s, he made almost 110$ that night, and he didn’t even have to sell any information for it. It wouldn’t carry him very far, in the grand scheme of things, but it would get him far enough that he could make his situation slightly better thanks to it.

New clothes! Finally he could wear something that wasn’t dirty and stolen. He had been waiting for it for a while, had even hoped he could have saved some of the 140$ for it. Unfortunately, the cash he hadn’t hidden in his sneakers had all been lost to the Firefly confrontation, so he hadn’t been able to do it in the end.

His numbness now replaced with a slight eagerness, he allowed himself to pick up a slightly above average speed, jumping, rolling and swinging from poles to gargoyles to hanging road signs. He was fast and it was dark so he wasn’t too worried about being spotted. Plus, the velocity, the wind in his face, in his hair… all of those things were making him feel more alive.

And he really needed that right now.

He wasn’t out of breath when he slowed down, a block away from Marco’s, but he was starting to sweat slightly. His chest still felt empty, his mind was still clouded but, as he stood there, cheeks flushed from his mad dash, he felt a bit better.

By the time he made his way back to his apartment, night was well underway. He didn’t have a way to tell the time precisely yet, he would have to find himself a cheap phone once he had more budget, but he thought it must be around midnight.

Climbing up the spiral staircase, he could hear people talking on the lower floors. The difference in volume told him that these apartments had several more rooms than his, as some voices appeared to come from much further away. The rent probably went up with the size of the place, he thought, so that was perfectly fine by him. Plus, he liked being under the roof. Sure, it meant the window was angled a bit oddly, as it had to follow the slope, but it allowed him to open it and then, if he wanted to, simply climb out through it.

He hadn’t thought about it before, too busy thinking about the fight with Firefly and hesitating over the remains of the Iron Spider.

He had almost forgotten about that, he remembered glumly. He would have to bring himself to dismantle the suit, the components inside of it, and the gold that they contained, were too valuable for his future projects for him to simply let them collect dust. He didn’t want to, but he would have to and the sooner the better.

He unlocked his door, darkly glancing at the mattress, under which he had hidden the ruined suit. He walked over to his desk, which lacked a chair and, not knowing where else to sit, climbed up on it.

Being made of sturdy wood, it held his weighty quite well, allowing him to set his dinner on his lap. Marco had given him a small pizza again, and this time it even had a few slices of pepperoni on it.

He didn’t feel tired yet, his body still alert due to the exertion of running home from roof to roof. He needed to think, then, not wanting his mind to wander into dark memories. Now was not the time. He needed just a bit more control before he could think about it, just a tiny bit more.

After eating, he went into the bathroom to clean up, sighing as he remembered that he had long missed the hours during which he could get some hot water. Shivering under the cold blast, he ended up staying there longer than expected, as the temperature shock soothed a bit of his back’s terrible itchiness. The pain wasn’t fully gone yet, but it had quieted considerably, it had now gone into healing mode, which was always deeply uncomfortable.

As he went back into the main room, dripping water everywhere, he noticed that, although his mattress had some sheets on, it lacked a blanket, something he hadn’t noticed before. Yet another thing he had to add to his shopping list.

Glancing at the empty pizza box over at his desk, it dawned on him that he also did not own a trashcan, and he still didn’t have soap.

Being on his own was proving to be challenging, there were a lot of details he had to think of that sometimes came as complete surprises to him. He was so used to May running the household that he completely lacked any experience in that regard.

His heart twisted as he remembered his aunt. He missed her. He wished she could have been here, visiting his first appartement with a proud smile on her face. Well, ideally, he wouldn’t want her to see it in this state, as it lacked a lot of essential furniture, but just having her there would make even that small humiliation alright.

It hurt too much to think, and he couldn’t distract himself from the memories now that he had been trapped by them. Wanting an escape from his mind, he closed his eyes, hoping for a nice dream to take him away from his grief.

He did not have a nice dream.

Instead, his sleep was troubled with the smell of smoke and the sound of explosions. Blasts of energy, tongues of flames.

Just another normal night in Gotham.

Chapter Text

Peter wished he had a way to write down his ideas, as he paced back and forth on the ceiling, hands in his pants pockets. He had a lot of planning to do, that much was for sure. He missed his old Stark pad, a gift he had gotten to help him design new versions of his suit and help around at the tower… but it had been lost even before he ended up in Gotham. There was no way he would be able to afford such a piece of tech nowadays.

Well, he had less technology but at least here no one knew his secret identity and, to the people of the city, there wasn’t even a Spider-Man yet, only a mysterious "unidentified meta".

He sighed as he remembered that the police had arrived just in time to see the worst part of the fight, when he lost his cool and lashed out in anger, instead of doing what he should really have done and go save the civilians. That probably had not been a good first impression, especially if violent mutants-… metas- were a common occurrence.

The shock and rage he has felt at Firefly’s actions had overpowered him. Even during the worst parts of puberty, his temper had never caused him so much trouble. Ever since what happened after Mysterio’s death, since Thanos came to earth, even, his emotions had become harder and harder to control.

Nobody had warned him that being a vigilante could have this kind of effects, and he was confused as to why it was happening to him. He did not want to change, he liked who he was before, a happy, optimistic teenager.

But now it felt like that he had trouble smiling and acting like he usually would more days than not. Maybe that was just a side effect of growing up, he had recently turned seventeen after all.

As he spun the thoughts in his head, trying to make himself feel better, he could hear Gotham move from the outside of his windows. Only a small part of his ceiling was flat and high enough for him to walk on it without knocking his head on the floor and, when he stood there, he could spot the sky. It was surprisingly blue that day. He couldn’t see the civilians road but he didn’t mind. He trusted his ears to warn him, now that his Spider sense was gone.

It seemed like, as he had to compensate with the ability’s disappearance, he got more attuned to his basic senses. He felt like they were sharper, in a way.

He groaned, leaning his forehead against the ceiling. Once again, he had gotten sidetracked. Without a proper support to take notes, it was dreadfully easy for him to lose focus, always had been.

Understanding he wouldn’t be getting much done until he set up a proper workspace for himself, Peter resigned himself to spending the money he had earned the previous night. He needed food anyways.

His dirty clothing did not seem out of place as he walked around the Bowery, ducking into a convenience store before anyone could stop him and try to rob him. More people were out that day, it seemed like gothamites did not stay cowed for very long and the threat of hidden explosives wasn’t enough to keep them inside more than a few days.

After grabbing enough ramen noodles to last him for a week and some onions and garlic to flavor them, he got himself a notebook and some cheap pens. He didn’t want to spend all that he had, but he did need a lot of supplies to start up his research and get himself a new suit. He couldn’t really avoid spending his cash, no matter how uncomfortable it made him to think he might end up broke again.

Shopping in the Bowery was a bit like a treasure hunt, paired with a very dark version of hide and seek. More than once, not wanting to get into a fight and attract attention to himself, Peter ducked behind a dumpster or car to avoid being spotted by weapons carrying stranger. Most people here carried guns openly as a way to discourage others from assaulting them. The fact that he didn’t most likely made him a bigger target.

Even if he had the money for a gun, he wouldn’t feel comfortable owning one. He didn’t need more ways to harm people, his body was strong enough to do that for him, whenever he lost focus or control.

A second hand blanket, simple plastic trashcan and some more tools later, Peter gave himself a small budget to find himself some new clothes. Thrift stores around there had a surprisingly large amount of children and teenager’s clothes available and he was more than able to find some more cheap used shirts and pants. Carrying the plastic bags he’d been given to put it all in in one hand, he snuck around thugs and suspicious alleyways until he found his last stop of the day.

Soap and laundry detergent acquired, he managed to head back to his apartment without getting into any altercation, using the heights to his advantages by heading back to his favorite mode of transportation : roof jumping.

He opened the window to his apartment from the outside, having left it unlocked for that very purpose. He dropped his grocery bags on the desk under him, sliding down after them. The wood groaned but held, allowing him to hop down.

He should probably get a chair or a stool for this desk eventually but furniture tended to be expensive, if he remembered correctly. It had taken May many years to refurbish their New York home after they had to sell everything to pay for Uncle Ben’s hospital bills and funeral. The fact that they still had to hand over their money even though he had died shortly after arriving at the clinic had confused his younger self greatly.

They had tried to avoid hospitals after that, afraid to be stuck with unfathomably high bills again. It had helped him out as Spider-Man, since it meant their first-aid shelf was always fully stocked when his healing did not always kick in fast enough for him to recover in a few days.

Doing laundry for the first time in a week was enough of a draw for him to make his way to the basement. He hoped not to encounter anyone, still more than suspicious of the kind of people who lived there if "No cannibalism" was one of the ground rules.

The basement was blessedly empty when he reached it. Most of the other tenants were probably at work, he suspected.

Peter looked through the small communal kitchen briefly. It was small but well equipped, with a microwave, two fridges, an oven, a teapot and several drawers no doubt full of more appliances. It would become cramped pretty quickly, though, if more than two or so people tried to use it at once.

A door at the back of the room led him to the laundry room. It had four machines, three for washing and one for drying. Once again, he was struck by the fact that the place would get tiny really fast with even a small amount of tenants in it.

Maybe the bigger units had more appliances than his. He still hadn’t been able to estimate just how much larger those were but it wasn’t like he could break into them to check. He’d just have to keep listening and figure it out from the sounds. It was good practice for night recon, he supposed.

Stuffing all of his new clothes into the machine as well as his blanket, Peter turned the thing on, grinning as it immediately started rumbling loudly. An ancient model, that one. It reminded him of his childhood. He used to love sitting in the bathroom and watching the colorful fabric spin through the glass, wondering how it would feel to be tumbled around like this.

He had brought his notebook down with him so he sat in front of the washing machine and set it on his lap, finding the nostalgia oddly comforting. That was a safe memory, with no pain attached to it. It was a relief to find out he still had those.

He started writing. The most important thing for now was for him to gather his thoughts into something more organized. A plan of some sort.

 

TO DO LIST :

1- ASSEMBLE AN OFFICE AND WORKSHOP AREA.  
- GET COMPUTER TOOLS  done   
- GET READING MATERIALS    
- GET CRAFTING SUPPLIES   
- GET A SEWING MACHINE   
- GET A CHAIR

2- PREP A SPIDER SUIT   
- SCAVENGE THE IRON SPIDER    
- WORK ON NEW SUIT SCHEMATICS   
- FIND MATERIALS     
- PROCURE MORE SEWING TOOLS

3 - GATHER INTEL         
- FIND A MAP OF GOTHAM       
- IDENTIFY MAIN GANGS
- LEARN ABOUT VIGILANTE        
- RESEARCH MAIN ROGUES


Peter tapped the pen on his chin, trying to decide if he wanted to add anything more quite yet. This was quite a large amount of tasks already, but there was one thing he had to eventually think about, he just had no idea how to achieve it.

4 - GO TO COLLEGE

Going to university was an old dream of his, one that he didn’t want to give up quite yet. He’d wanted to study engineering and computer sciences, back in the days, but now he wasn’t so sure anymore.

Peter felt foolish, scratching up the last line, frowning. He didn’t know what he wanted to learn, and he didn’t even legally exist in this world as far as he could tell. Trying to go to school was pointless. Even his high school diploma was useless, in the end. It had probably been erased from reality too, because of Stephen’s spell.

His financial situation didn’t leave him a lot of choices as to what it he could cross off of the list. A sewing machine was out of the question right now, as it would need to be heavily modified to work on a Spider suit, and that required expensive components, on top of the original machine itself.

Same went for the crafting materials. Both the web fluid and the suit had many different parts in them, and each of them needed a lot of quality elements to function properly.

If the Iron Spider had still been intact, he could have used it as a base but, as it was now, it was pointless to try. Its back and boots had been lost to the fire, and several other parts of its body had been burned severely. There was no way around scraping it, Peter thought glumly. Every square inch of the outfit was filled with valuable technology and, from what he had left, he could probably make several pieces of equipment.

His hands started to move instinctively, sketching a few concepts. He could either try to replicate the Iron Spider and use most of its components to create a tech oriented suit, mostly made of metal with little other materials, or he could split up the nanotechnology and computer systems in between different outfits. That would take longer to craft, as he would need a higher amount of good, resilient fabric… but it might also be easier to produce, and each suit would be faster to finish.

The second option would be more expensive in the long run but could also allow him more flexibility. He found himself envisioning a fire-proof spider suit, one that could have given him a leg up during the Firefly confrontation.

Didn’t one of the Gotham rogues use gas in his attacks? He could design a toxin resistant suit, with an air filtering system installed. He wouldn’t be able to power the tech in the same way, but there were ways around it. He could move to batteries, either replaceable or chargeable, but that would be a bit awkward…

Kinetic energy, maybe? He did use a lot of strength and speed as Spider-Man and-…

Peter gasped, ideas flowing in his mind. A limiter, maybe? He scribbled down in the notebook, moving from sketches to equations to short sentences. The pages were filling quickly and by the time he switched his wet clothes to the dryer, he had several good concepts to explore.

His first instinct was to focus on his original idea, the fire-resistant suit, but his logical mind made him doubt slightly. Firefly had not been a meta and, with how beaten up he had been at the end of their confrontation, it would most likely take him months to recover, perhaps even more.

He needed more intel on the main rogues in town, find out if anymore of them used explosives and flames. If they didn’t, he might have to push it back for later.

The dryer beeped and he yelped in surprise. He had been so focused on the suits he could potentially make that he hadn’t noticed the machine had finished its cycle. Two hours had passed since he had first stepped into the laundry room, but he felt like it had been much shorter.

He wished he had more time before his shift to work more on his projects but, as he left the basement, he could tell the sun was starting to go down. The light coming in from the entrance hall windows had an orange tint to it, something a bit like gold.

He kept scribbling ideas until the last possible minute, wishing he could bring the notebook with him out on his deliveries. He wasn’t able to see in the dark however, so it would be pointless as most of the roofs were only lit by the moon. Maybe a flashlight should be his next investment.

He had missed having a project to work on but now that he had his own private space, he would make sure to keep himself busy. He was a good problem solver and this town was, so far, throwing him off balance. That was something he would fix, and a lot of that would come from his designs.

For the first time since the fight, he started to feel like there could be a way for Spider-Man to adapt to this new universe. Thanks to the Iron Spider he had Nanobots and plenty of complex computer components to use, once he had taken them out. Now all he had to do was save money, get more supplies and tools, and make sure he wasn’t kicked out.

As long as he kept his head down, everything should be fine.
Notes:

    Based on comic Peter who makes a lot of his own specialized suits… I also thought it would be a fun thing to have him do.

    Shorter chapter today cause I spent the day out. Already wanna start writing fight scenes again but gonna have to settle on spider suit rambling.

Chapter Text

When he saw that his last delivery would take him to Park Row, Peter felt extremely disappointed. So far, his night had been relatively peaceful, most of his clients had been civilians or low level criminals all of whom had treated him quite nicely.

It would have been his first time not getting a gun pulled on him during his shift but, of course, this was Gotham. He couldn’t be this lucky.

As he slowly crept northward, leaving the center of the Bowery and heading towards Park Row, most often referred to as "Crime Alley" from what he had heard around the streets, a strange feeling spread up his back and up towards his neck.

Wait a minute… was that?

He straightened up then froze, focusing on his body. He couldn’t feel anything out of the ordinary, outside of the remaining itchiness of the few scars that had yet to smooth over from his old burns. Was it psychological, then? A ghostly Spider sense when he felt like he should be feeling it, just like a ghost limb for a regular human.

The thought disturbed him a lot more than what he had expected. If the Spider sense had been cut away from him completely, what had caused it? Could he ever regain it?

It felt like terrible timing but, maybe, it wasn’t. Dimension travel would be the kind of events that could potentially disturb ones’ abilities like this. He had to look more into it, now that he had managed to stabilize his situation a little. He should try and add it to his to do list, if he remembered.

Crime Alley was full of life when he entered it. He could hear people of various genders panting in some of the nearby alleyways, as the local brothel had apparently reopened. Several groups of gangsters stood together along  the dark street, smoking, drinking and laughing. He could spot weapons on all of them. A lot of back alley deals were going on behind each group, solitary buyers coming in and out of the darkness to exchange cash for substances or weapons. All of it was very blatant, as if they didn’t have a care in the world about who could spot them.

The place had not looked the same last time he had been there, and that had been before the Firefly attack. Unlike most other areas in the city, the locals here did not appear more tense after the incident but, instead, more relaxed.

His mind worked through the paradox, taking it apart like a puzzle. People here were more criminally inclined, he could smell it in from the powder in the air, the distinctive scent of drugs, which he had learned to identify from his time in New York. Now that he was focusing, he could hear people locked away inside of their apartments, civilians. Those people were still scared.

What would make criminals relax but civilians hide? The answer dawned upon him and he crossed his arms, unsettled.

Ah. Of course. There must be an ongoing investigation about the incident, and the explosives were still going off, from what he had seen on the newspapers while shopping for food earlier that day. A lot of the police force must be focused on stopping that, and if the city’s vigilantes worked with them, which he wasn’t yet sure about, they probably were distracted as well.

That left more time for the little guns to come out and play. The amount of cocaine he could smell alone was worrying, the substance was expensive, having so much of it in out on the street, hidden away in backpacks and large pockets, only taken out to be exchanged for a couple of bills, was a sign of confidence. Of course, cheaper substances were there too, and in even greater numbers. Thousands of dollars worth of merchandise was spread across the alley. Way too much to take out if the gangs weren’t absolutely convinced that they wouldn’t get busted.

Really, who could even try to stop them? There were a good fifty people standing around with guns. Even with a full police squadron, the ensuing gun fight would be a blood bath.

Peter walked into the alley, feeling several eyes follow him as he progressed. This would not end well.

He had barely made it a hundred or so feet into the long, tortuous street when he heard someone shift behind him, the sounds of footsteps falling close to his, matching them to hopefully throw him off.

Not wanting this to degenerate into yet another unfair fight, and with only a couple shots left in his web tanks, he decided to act immediately. Better show them that he wasn’t an easy target as soon as possible, the faster the word spread that he could hold his own, the less he would be bothered during his deliveries.

It was something he was starting to learn about Gotham. In the streets, there was a very animalistic hierarchy among the different residents. The strongest, sneakiest, smartest and more experienced prevailed over the weak. In his neighborhood, most of the weakest gothamites had been driven out… or maybe they were the ones hiding inside, waiting for the sun to rise, hoping that it would drive the gangs away.

He had heard many gunfights at night, many assaults too. He didn’t have a Spider suit anymore, there was nothing he could do about it, right?

Peter twisted around as the person behind him kept walking, unaware that they had been spotted. His hand shot up, grabbing the collar of their shirt, tugging it forward with such force that they stumbled and almost fell. It was a man, with a black jacket and dark make up around his eyes, making them blend in with the darkness off the night. He yelped in surprise as he went down.

Trying to keep his balance as to not disturb the last remaining pizza in his bag, Peter crouched and swung his leg in a wide arc. His sneakers collided with the thug’s ripped jeans, giving his legs the last push they needed to fully give out. The man crashed to the ground, cursing.

"I’m not looking for trouble." Peter told him, putting his foot in the small of the adult’s back, pressing down slightly. He could hear several people, also wearing black, reach for their guns. "I’m just here for a delivery. Please leave me alone."

"Fuck you!" The man spat at him, struggling his vain to free himself from the pressure he was putting on him. A dozen feet or so towards the entrance of the alley, his black clad friends were drawing various weapons.

Oh boy. This was not going as planned. Of course they wouldn’t be intimidated by him. He had shown some ability to fight, but they were still eight, including the one guy groaning on the floor, and all of them were larger in size and carrying a more dangerous arsenal that he was. To them, the conclusion of the fight was obvious.

At least their group was the only one dressed in this specific way, which was probably the reason why they had stayed close to one of the alley’s exits. Further down the street, he could identify several members of other gangs, most of them now having noticed what was going on. He could hear them laugh, as if this was just some sort of show.

No way he could use his webs with so many people watching, especially not now that his clash against Firefly had made the front page of several newspapers. He would have to rely on his strength, flexibility and speed, all the while attempting to look like a normal, regular teenager and also not ruin the last pizza in his bag. That meant he couldn’t flip around, he had to keep his back straight.

Well, he knew what to do, now he just had to survive it somehow.

Two men came running at him, too far away from the one functioning Crime Alley lamppost to be anything more than shadows in the night. At least that meant that most of the fight would be hard to see for the other criminals in the street.

Clenching his abs and back muscles to make sure he wouldn’t do any flips by reflex, Peter leaped to the side of the alley, one foot resting on the wall, immediately pushing and jumping once again. One of the two men stumbled at that, staying back, but the other didn’t flinch, still charging even as the boy was flying through the air.

Not a good choice, Mr. Thug.

Peter twisted his waist, spinning on himself in the air and sending his foot crashing into the poor guy’s face. He hadn’t put much strength behind the blow, but it was still enough to make the guy collapse like a puppet with cut strings. Ouch.

He landed in a crouch once again, just in time for the other guy to reach him. Behind him, he could hear that several of his friends had taken their guns out but hadn’t shot them yet. He understood : it was so dark right now that the bullets were likely to hit pretty much anyone standing in the alley, not just him. If they missed and got someone from another gang instead, things could go ugly very quickly.

Out of the five still standing, two other were coming at him. One had something that smelled like metal in his left hand, the other had a slight glue and wood polish scent. Knife and baseball bat.

He grabbed the foot of the second of the two initial attackers, who had finally gotten over his surprise and was now right in front of him, as he tried to kick him, stopping him with one hand. His other went to grab the man’s ankle and he twisted it savagely, sending the thug’s whole body into an out of control spin that ended with him crashing face first on the stone.

Some of the criminals from other gangs had started cheering him on, he noticed, cheeks flushing. He did not need this right now, it would only bring more attention to the scene.

As if caused by his thoughts, several lights started to turn on from the buildings around them, casting away some of the shadows that had, so far, kept the gun holders from shooting at him.

Great.

Civilians were watching now, from the relative safety of their apartments and squats. He would have kept on feeling terrible about it if he had the time but, as it was, knife woman and baseball bat man were already almost on him.

Thankfully, the three assaillants he had already disposed of had decided to stay on the ground. He hoped it was because he had knocked them out and not because they had figured out he was a meta and they didn’t have a chance without a gun. If that last option was the right, it was smart of them as it gave their colleagues a lot more space to shoot.

Hoping the last pizza hadn’t been ruined by his jumping and crouching, Peter walked a few steps back, bending his knees slightly, ready to pounce.

As the knife wielding woman struck, aiming the blade at his stomach, he side stepped her easily then slid against her back too fast for her to react.

He then grabbed the back of her leather jacket and, pretending like it was a great effort for him, swung her right into baseball man. The two collided with each other and he used this opportunity to bail.

He wasn’t about to try and fight three gunmen while the whole street was watching. He heard them yell at his retreating back but, as he has suspected, none of them followed him deeper into the alley. Too dangerous for them, since other gangs were represented in greater numbers there.

Now, he just had to hope that those gangs didn’t try to pick a fight with him either. No time to think, he was almost reaching another band of criminals. They were laughing at the scene he had caused, some of them clapping.

“Hey kid!” A man wearing a green hoodie and a strange patched up denim jacket covered in buttons and had, for some reason, a plastic flower on its lapel. "Wanna make some cash? We can use a fighter like you."

A clown themed gang? He was so surprised by the concept that he stayed silent, gazing up at the man with a confused expression. Eventually, he shook himself out of it and replied as politely as he can :

"Thank you but I already have a job."

"He works for Marco’s" another flower wearing man piped in, before anybody could get worked up over his refusal.

A wave of "aahs" and "ooohs" went through the older gang members present, the younger ones still noticeably confused but smart enough not to say anything about it.

”He got a good one this time." Someone remarked as he was let go. "Probably gonna last longer."

”Should we tell the boss?"

"How are you gonna tell him, dumbass? They’re not gonna let you in to talk to him."

"Only the Bat and Gordon can see him, I heard."

Their talk was interesting enough for Peter to keep spying on them as he went further down the street. He was left alone by the other gangs, his handling of the earlier assault and his exchange with the clown group (he still couldn’t believe that was a thing) having been apparently enough of a deterrent. Maybe they also just didn’t care.

Apparently, from what he could make out as he walked away, the leader of the "joker boys" had been captured a few months back and, ever since then, kept locked away from the world. The prison’s name started with an "A” but he had trouble making the full word out. Arcane? No… the second part hadn’t sounded exactly like this.

As he reached the spot his GPS had led him to, he suddenly realized who had ordered the pizza and he couldn’t help but feel very, very tired. He rung the bell to the correct apartment anyways, preparing for the worst.

”It’s you!" Harley beamed as she swung the door open. In the street behind him, Peter could hear a group of thugs hurriedly shuffling away after spotting her. She seemed to be somewhat of an institution around here.

Unlike last time he had seen her, the woman was not wearing a firearm, both of her hands empty. She was still dressed provocatively, wearing jeans that had been cut so short they almost looked like underwear and a white dress shirt that was not buttoned all the way. He tried his best to advert his gaze, not comfortable with the display.

”I didn’t think you’d ever come back," the woman cooed. "Come in!"

He really shouldn’t do it. She was quite obviously unstable in some way but he couldn’t help his curiosity. From the way she behaved and the reactions she got, she had some amount of influence in the Gotham underworld.

He needed information and other than the public library and spying on street level thugs during his deliveries he didn’t really have any other leads.

Peter stepped inside.

Harley led him up the stairs to a gaudily decorated apartment door. Someone had wrapped a garland around the wooden frame, lights shining red and green in rhythm.

"Are those Christmas lights?" He asked, wondering if it was getting close to this time of the year. He lost tracks of days easily but remembered he had seen the date on several newspaper before. They were indeed in December, he just couldn’t remember which part of the month.

”What? No that’s just my door."

She said this with an incredulous grin, as if his questions had been completely incongruous. Thing was, Peter was almost certain he had seen those exact lights in a Christmas themed store a few days ago.

Well, at least they only clashed slightly with the scratched up pink paint that had been applied to the door itself.

He rubbed his sneakers on a bright green "Welcome Home" mat. Some blood had gotten on them when he kicked the thug earlier and he hoped it wouldn’t stain. Those were his only shoes.

"I wanted to apologize,” Harley told him as he followed her in. She didn’t explain herself and instead ran off into what looked to be a kitchen, tucked right next to her front door, on the left. Her living room was on the right, dimly lit by yet some other Christmas garlands.

Her place was small and filled from floor to ceiling with things that made Peter extremely uncomfortable. On a comfortable looking pink and white couch, a dozen or so handguns were laying around. He could tell by the smell that they were all loaded.

In front of the couch, a little table held empty wine bottles and cigarette buds. He could see pill bottles scattered around the floor, some spilling over, medication spread in between knives and old newspapers that had been forgotten there. The living room was small and those two pieces of furniture took most of the space available, but Harley had still managed to fit in a small flat screened TV. It didn’t seem to see much use, as the stand it sat on was covered in dust.

On the walls, the faded brown paint had been covered by various posters and artworks. In between those two things, of course, several guns had been mounted as decoration as well. Way too many of them to be legal, he thought.

Well, that it certainly cost quite a bit of money to get an arsenal this big and this was only the living room. He had definitely found something interesting there, he needed to keep digging.

Harley came back into the living room, holding two open beer bottles in her hands. She sat them down on the table with a smile.

"Come sit!" She gestured at the couch.

Peter slid off his pizza bag, taking the box out and handing it to her before carefully making his way to the seat. He took the time to pluck a few guns away and set them on the table before sitting down.

This was probably one of the worst ideas he had ever had.

He awkwardly took the beer Harley chucked at him. Droplets fell over his pants and on the couch but she didn’t seem to care. She was looking at him with a huge smile.

"Thought you were dead." She said eventually. "Called in to order and the old man said the place was closed."

"Sorry?" Peter tried, holding the alcohol uncomfortably, not really wanting to drink it.

Harley nodded gravely, gulping down some of her own beer. "Very disappointing. But you survived! So I decided to throw a survival party!"

She waved her arms around, as if to encompass all of her little living room. Considering the mess it was in, Peter could only smile politely, trying very hard not to show on his face that he had noticed the dozen or so grenades under the TV stand.

"We just met, though." He pointed out.

He was completely ignored as Harley had started to dig into the pizza. It looked a bit messy but probably not as bad as it could have been, considering what he had put it through during the fight earlier. This time, it looked like it was vegan only, with a lot of spices throw on top of it.

He swirled his untouched beer into the bottle, squirming uncomfortably on the weapons covered couch.

"Um… thank you for intervening the other day." He managed to say, hoping it would open an interesting conversation. Trying to get her to talk about gangs and crime in the city was why he was here after all.

”Oh yeah!" Harley smiled. "Those idiots. They’re all like that, mad because their boss is no longer the big boss." Her laugh as she finished the sentence sounded slightly hysterical and his unease spiked up once again.

Well, that was interesting intel. Maybe he had been right to follow his instincts on this one. He tried to push a bit harder:

"Do you think they’re gonna try to do anything about it?"

She cackled again, downing the rest of her beer and throwing the empty bottle at the wall violently. It shattered on impact, making him flinch. Maybe he should stop before he got her more upset.

Harley plucked the untouched beer from his hands, putting a slice of pizza in it instead. She drank his bottle as well, sending it flying just as she had before. She didn’t look very happy.

"Aaah…" she sighed. "’M not supposed to drink but what can you do?"

Not wanting to trigger more extreme reactions, Peter stayed very, very still. She didn’t notice how pale his face had gotten, thankfully, instead grabbing a pill off of the floor and crushing it in her hand. She shoved the powder into her mouth and swallowed, grimacing at the taste.

They stayed silent for a few minutes. He felt like he was dealing with an unstable, wild animal but, really, this was just another human being. He had to remember that.

"Those guys…” She eventually told him, slurring a little. "… they’re losers. They chose the wrong guy and they don’t want to admit it. Not that anyone would want them in if they tried to. They suck." She repeated it a couple more times, punctuating each repetition with a snap of her fingers. "You need to be smart when you chose a boss, ‘specially in Gotham."

"Oh?" Peter said, encouraging her to keep talking while still trying to sound as neutral as possible. He bit into the pizza slice, it was almost cold by now but at least it gave him some energy.

"Yeah." Harley nodded. "I wasn’t smart. At least, I don’t think so. People say I wasn’t." She shook her head, looking pained. There was a story there, but she definitely did not look stable enough for him to ask about it. "At least the guy I chose wasn’t a total loser."

Her hands were shaking slightly. She took another pill, which she also crushed and swallowed. It didn’t look like a very healthy habit.

"Let’s talk about something else." Peter blurted out. He wasn’t feeling good making her so visibly upset, and intel wasn’t worth acting like a douchebag. He grasped for conversation topics, completely out of his element.

Harley was still shaking. She had picked up a knife from the carpet and was twirling it between her finger. Her precision and speed were impressive.

"You wanted to apologize?" He managed to ask, hoping it would be enough to pull her out of whatever it was she was going through. He had to repeat himself a few times before she noticed him and, once she did, her shaking calmed down a bit.

"Oh yeah!" She exclaimed, jumping to her feet and clapping her hands together, her previous state of mind completely forgotten. "See, last time, I didn’t notice but my girlfriend told me!"

She whirled around dramatically, pointing at him then putting a hand on her forehead. "I forgot to tip you!" She said, sounding absolutely heartbroken about it. Of course, he could by her heart rhythm that she was just putting on a show. She was a very good actor, he would have to remember that.

"Wait…" he suddenly had an epiphany. "Is this why you invited me in?" He shook his head right after the words left his mouth. She had also invited him to come with her last time. He could be an idiot, sometimes.

"No! I invited you because I was curious! But I do want to give you a little something as an apology."

She ran out of the living room once again, this time heading down a corridor and into what he assumed was her bedroom. She came out of it clutching a large pink and green box, which she dropped on his knees.

"You really didn’t have to," Peter told her, having a really bad feeling about the kind of gifts a woman like her would come up with.

"Oh but I did! It was so much fun watching you knock their teeth out! I wish I was a meta, too…" she sighed dreamily.

He pointedly ignored that last comment, opening the present instead. Inside of the box sat a bright pink, butterfly and hearts covered sawed off shotgun. It even came with several boxes of ammo, which intimidated him a bit, considering the things had just been dropped carelessly on his lap.

"This is my third favorite gun." Harley told him. "I wanted to get you chocolates but I can’t really be seen in public so I thought this would do."

"Thank you." He croaked out. He did not want a gun. He had no need for a firearm. He didn’t think he could say no to Harley, though, not with the amount of weapons she had scattered all around the room.

"I’m so happy you like it." She winked at him. "I hope you have a lot of fun using it!"

"Y-Yeah."

He left pretty quickly after that, knowing that Marco would be waiting for him at the restaurant. “That’s fine," Harley nodded when he told her. "Gotta respect your boss."

Her slurring had worsened dramatically, she looked about to pass out. He hoped she would be alright, as he made his way up to the roof from the staircase outside her apartment. He had stored the shotgun box into his pizza bag, not wanting to be seen with it, even if he stuck to the roofs.

The surprise of having a gun handed to him had been all he could feel at first but, now that he was (very carefully) making his way back to the pizzeria, he found himself thinking about what he could do with it. Guns had several interesting components inside of them, maybe he could try to take it apart and turn it into another tool, something less dangerous.

If he did that, he might have to find himself a soldering kit, depending on whether or not he wanted to modify the weapon’s frame. He could also just try to grab the insides… Maybe he could do something with the bullets too. He had to use everything he managed to get his hands on if he wanted to survive Gotham.

He hadn’t gotten as much information out of Harley than he had hoped for but what he had heard already intrigued him. The black leather gang used to rule the underworld but now the balance of power had shifted.

He had found his first contact into the underworld. Now he would have to keep digging into it. The more he learned about this city, the more mysteries he uncovered.

Gotham was the weirdest place he’d ever found himself into and, coming from him, that meant quite a lot.

(See the end of the chapter for notes.)
Chapter Text

There was one major issue about being a seventeen year old living on his own. Outside of the whole loneliness aspect, of course. It was that he had no clue what he was doing.

Many things that should be obvious to him, and that would have been to May, he kept missing. That was why, after more than three days in his apartment, he still ended up with no towel as he stepped out of the shower. When he entered his room, the floor was littered with clothes, both clean and dirty, and his desk, already quite small, was overflowing with the few items he owned, as well as a significant amount of trash.

Unfortunately, he had forgotten to buy trash bags back at the convenience store, and he already had used up all the plastic grocery bags he had brought back so the junk had piled up. That was without mentioning the many hygiene items he had forgotten to grab, including deodorant, toothpaste, toothbrush, hairbrush and a razor. He also didn’t have any shampoo.

He hadn’t expected to need to buy so many things to live comfortably. Back in New York, all of those items had been as easy to acquire as slipping a word to May about needing one of them. Whenever she would do groceries, she’d always remember to grab what he mentioned.

He had kept on acting as if she would be here to take care of him in those little ways, forgetting what had happened last week. It was so easy to keep on living, especially now that he was in a new city, a new universe. He could pretend that she was still alive, just far away. That, eventually, she would come back and help him out again.

She couldn’t. She wouldn’t. He was alone in this, and he had to be an adult. He felt like a teenager, sometimes, but he couldn’t afford to be one anymore.

It was hard.

Peter took a deep breath, running his hands through his messy hair. He needed to take care of himself now, that was what his aunt would have wanted. It was so hard to remember everything though, even now that he had housing and a job.

He ended up leaving his apartment and laying down on the roof to calm his thoughts. The clouds were heavy that morning, it would probably rain in the afternoon. He listened to the city move and breathe, commuters heading to their jobs, their schools. Planes sometimes flew overhead, leaving white trails behind, sometimes blending in with the clouds, sometimes cutting through the small spots of blue still visible above Gotham.

He rose after a few minutes, feeling significantly better. Heights had always helped. Ever since he had been thrown into this world, he had only indulged his love of high buildings once, when he climbed on top of the bridge. Everything else had been to hectic for him to even think about doing it again. Maybe he should have.

It helped clear his thoughts, to look down at a city this big. Made him feel both small and big, a cog in the machine but one that was able to see it all from the outside, on occasions.

Jumping back down into his apartment, he promised himself to take the time to explore the Gotham skyscrapers later this month. Perhaps for Christmas, if it wasn’t too cold.

His heart twisted in his chest as he realized that, this year, he had no one to celebrate the holidays with. They had been a multicultural family, back in the days. Ben came from a non practicing Jewish family, like his own father, and May had been raised Christian, same as his mother. They had never pushed their cultures on him but he had childhood memories of both. Faith was not something he thought about a lot since becoming Spider-Man. He didn’t have much time  to think about spirituality.

No matter what, they had still celebrated every holidays. He still had gotten a gift even the year his uncle passed : a sketch book and a set of pencils. It had probably cost only a few dollars but, back then, they had been his treasures.

Later on, of course, May could afford more gifts and spoiled him with miniature sets, comic books and, once, a brand new computer. He cherished those early Christmas and Hanukkah the most, though, when Ben had still been there. Presents didn’t matter as much as family to him.

For what seemed to be the hundredth time, Peter left his apartment to go buy more supplies for it. Adulthood seemed to be nothing but an endless string of expenses so far, very different from what he has envisioned when he thought of going off to MIT back before this all started.

Thankfully, most of the shops in the Bowery were cheaper than the ones he’d seen in the rest of Gotham. In one of them, he found an old metal locker that most definitely had been snatched from a school or a gym. The thing was ancient, with scratched up paint and some doodles inside. It only costed 10$ so he grabbed it, refusing politely when the owner, a kind older gentleman, offered to help him carry it to the streets.

At least that helped him remember that he was supposed to struggle with the thing a little. He pretended to drag it back to the building then, once inside and after checking nobody was looking, hoisted it up on one of his shoulders and ran up the stairs as fast as he could.

He would have to clean, modify and paint it a bit for it to become usable, but he felt like it had a lot of potential. If he could find a metal bar and some hangers, it would become a perfectly fine closet. He could also find some boards to put a couple shelves at the bottom to store even more of his belongings.

Of course, it was pretty thin, as locker tended to be, but it was better than putting everything on the ground.

Now decided to turn around his living space, hoping he wouldn’t have to move everything out too soon, Peter gathered the rest of his money up. He still had some left over from his second to last shift and the previous night had built up on top of that. He was sitting on 175$. After some hesitation, he grabbed a hundred, split up into smaller bills, and hid it under his mattress, where the Spider suit was. He’d have to find a better spot for it, maybe build a hidden compartment inside the desk…

It would do for now.

He pocketed the rest and went out to find what he hoped would be enough to furnish an apartment worthy of the adult he was supposed to was. He gathered up basic personal hygiene supplies, splurged on a brand new towel from an actual mall that he found south of the district, and used the opportunity to look around for some paint to fix up his locker.

He ended up in a crafts store, in which he spent almost all of his budget. The paint wasn’t the worst of it, he had been relatively conservative and had only chosen one color : red, but he also had to grab some brushes, one large for furniture and one small for equipment, some wooden boards, a pair of sewing scissors, a long circular wooden stick and finally some sanding pads. He barely had enough left after this for some trash bags, a sponge and a bottle of cleaning product.

Money went away so fast, even when he tried to buy only the cheapest version of everything. At least he had already gotten a tiny handsaw a few days back, during his first hunt for tools.

On his way back to the apartment, he dropped the stolen "S" hoodie and pants on the window ledge of the apartment he had grabbed them from. Hopefully, their owner wouldn’t be too weirded out by them suddenly reappearing. He hoisted himself back up on the roof smoothly after that, picking up his purchases and heading back.

Once back in, Peter realized he had completely forgotten to grab anything to protect the floor, which was ancient and made of pure wood. He spent the rest of his morning up til lunch hunting dry, forgotten pieces of newspaper in the streets to put under the furniture as he painted it.

As he ate his ramen noodles, after coming back from his paper hunt, he almost gagged. He had had too much of that exact same meal, and it was starting to make it harder and harder to force it down.

Unfortunately, he still had a dozen portions to go through. Maybe he should splurge into a small fridge for himself, next time he got paid… Or maybe not. If he got kicked out, the thing would be useless unless he found another place with electricity.

It was tempting though. He was too paranoid about the building and its inhabitants to leave anything in the fridges and, considering they were both empty when he did check inside, he probably wasn’t the only one to think exactly that. Being able to keep his own vegetables, meat and fruits without having them spoil and then being able to take them down and cook with them would be such a luxury…

He pictured himself cooking in the cramped basement and shuddered. It felt wrong. He and May had often cooked together when they made it home at the same time, it had become a ritual of sorts over the years. She taught him recipes from her side of the family but also some of Ben and his parents’ favorites. He was forever grateful for that. One day, if he had children, he would share those meals with them just like she had with him.

He missed her. It hurt to think about her the most out of everyone back home. His best friend and girlfriend… ex-girlfriend, were still alive, probably still trying their best to achieve their dreams. It helped him, pretending that one day they would meet up again and talk like old friends.

He couldn’t fool himself like this with May, he had seen her fade in front of his eyes, had held her body in his arms.

His eyes were starting to burn, repressed tears trying to break out. He slowly slid to the floor, dropping his shopping bags as he did so.

Loneliness hit him once again, eating at his heart and soul. He wanted to curl up on himself and stop existing, he had lost everything he had ever tried to achieve, everyone he had ever loved.

But letting himself die wouldn’t make his family proud, would it? He would disappoint them by doing this. He had to be strong, he had to be an adult.

He slowly wiped his eyes, tears having won against his willpower in the end. He had six hours before he had to head out for his shift and he had a whole lot of work to do.

First of all, he started picked up all the trash he had laying around, stuffing it in a trash bag, which he took downstairs. After setting up his trashcan with yet another bag, he turned to the locker, the second and most crucial part of his "Clean the Apartment" initiative.

No one was there to tell him to clean his room so he had to figure out how to keep it tidy himself.

Peter set the newspapers on the ground, putting a few layers down to make sure no liquids seeped through. He then grabbed his sponge, dabbed it in the nondescript cheap cleaning product (which was probably mostly made out of ethanol), and started wiping down the outside of the locker. It was dusty and grimy, with several suspicious sticky spots that smelled slightly of alcohol. It took a good half an hour of energetic scrubbing for him to be satisfied but, once he was done, he couldn’t help but feel accomplished.

Then, he remembered he had to do it all over again inside the locker and he groaned. He was already bored, the activity really wasn’t stimulating. He missed his headphones…

Wait a minute. Didn’t he have a radio on his desk? He slapped himself on the forehead, feeling like a fool. He had completely forgotten about it. That would have made his sleepless late nights a lot easier to deal with.

He wiped his hands clean before bringing it over, setting it on the ground next to the newspaper. It was connected to a wall socket with a cable so long he could probably take it through the window and up on the roof. That was a nice idea.

Peter sat cross legged in front of it, turning it on. Music started to play from it and he lowered the sound until he was sure no one else would be bothered by it. He then started switching in between the stations, looking for-

"bzzzzzt-lity news stories straight from Gotham city!"

Perfect.

A cheerful, feminine voice informed him that he had tuned in to "Gotham Watch", a show focused on covering events around the city. It was daily, she informed the listeners, and it ran for four hours on the clock. He scribbled it down in his notebook to remember to check it out regularly, a news channel was exactly what he was looking for.

Of course, teens his age didn’t really listen to radio anymore unless they had a car and, even then, most people just used Bluetooth. He had gotten most of his infos straight from his phone or computer and therefore had not even thought about using the radio he had been lended… yet another thing that he had overlooked.

"The GCPD has published a statement today on their official Twitter account, announcing that progress was being made on the Firefly investigation. Commissioner Gordon will hold a press conference this Friday to update the public more in details.”

Peter, who had started scrubbing the inside of the locker, almost dropped his sponge at that. Commissioner Gordon? Like pizza Gordon? Police contact Gordon?

His contact to the GCPD was the commissioner himself?

He had been confused as to why Marco had handed him the same pamphlet that Barbara had given him, after referring to it as Gordon’s, but if the man was the commissioner that made more sense. He did remember the librarian telling him the police had been involved in writing the guide.

He hadn’t had time to go over it again but he had put it on his desk, next to Harley’s gift box and his new tools, in preparation for his next research day.

It could also be a coincidence, there could be two men named Gordon in the GCPD. That seemed more plausible than the head of the whole of Gotham’s police force wanting to keep a mere pizza boy as a source.

Then, their last exchange had barely lasted five minutes and the man had mentioned having several other informants. Maybe that was why he had gotten to this position in the first place, thanks to his own network of eyes in the underworld.

Unable to decide what he believed yet, Peter went back to his work, speeding up his scrubbing to get done with it as fast as he could.

"Gotham’s new daytime vigilante, The Signal, has been spotted in the Narrows once again. As a reminder to our more irregular listeners, it’s okay we still love you, Signal has been active for two months now. It is suspected he works alongside the Bat, but, considering how hard it is to get the man to sit down for an interview, we can’t confirm anything yet!"

Information about the city’s heroes! He mouthed the new, unfamiliar name, elbows deep into the locker, now cleaning up the back. He’d have to wash it all over with water to get the smell of the product out, then dry it with his one and only towel to make sure he could start painting before his shift.

Urgh. He’d have to go down to the laundry room again. Something else he wasn’t used to but had been forced to learn due to his situation. As long as he folded all of his clothes, May would clean them for him, unless she was too busy at work.

"And now some news from Arkham! Firefly has been reportedly secured and escorted there by the Dark Knight himself, ladies and gentlemen! He will join the many criminals that have been locked away in there, thanks to our local vigilantes! This time, though, if you remember correctly dear listeners, the Bat Clan was not involved in the fight… at least not unless they have a new member!"

Peter grimaced as the woman moved on to talking about the mysterious meta that had burst in during the arson attack. She was going easy on him, saying he had managed to stop the spread of the flames before the police got there, but immediately brought his mood down when she mentioned that the confrontation had been especially brutal.

"All in all, listeners, we don’t know if we have another violent power hungry meta on our hands, yet! Let’s hope it’s not the case and the Bats are simply adding another meta to their ranks. It’s only fair, with the kind of people we have roaming around this city."

He sighed, wishing he hadn’t lost his cool and injured Firefly this badly. Because of this, everyone was now afraid that he was a raging meta, no better than any other rogue. He was probably the source of much of the anxiety in the city, now that he thought about it. What was more terrifying than a danger you didn’t know? He was a completely new addition to the cast of super powered individuals in the town, they had to be at least a little wary about his intentions.

He switched out the cleaning product for water and started washing off the locker again, getting as much of the chemical smell as he could out of it.

"On the other side of city news, here’s some rich folks talk! Wayne Tech recently made a move into the phone market, snatching one of Luthor Corps’ brightest engineer, the man behind the immensely successful LexPhone. I’m happy those never caught on in Gotham by the way, what a terrible name am I right?"

Wayne was a familiar name, Peter had encountered it several times around town, yet couldn’t precisely remember where.

He soaked up the water with his towel, drying as much of it as he could. Once he was done, he threw the piece of fabric into the bathroom then stood up and grabbed his brushes and paint from the shopping bags.

He started painting the outside with careful strokes, taking great care to keep them even, even though the original layer was scratched up. He would have to set several layers anyway, and polish the bumps away with the sanding pads.

"The holiday season is coming up! Here is a quick sum up of the events you can attend to celebrate. First of all, the Wayne Foundation is sponsoring an Arts week, which will see every museum and theater in the city open for free for the week leading up to Christmas! I don’t know how Brucie is earning this much money to throw away but the man keeps doing it!"

Peter considered visiting some museums himself. It was a luxury he hadn’t thought he’d be able to afford anytime soon but, if they didn’t ask for his ID, maybe he would check it out. He loved learning new things.

He now also remembered where he had heard about Wayne Tech. The Wayne Foundation had been the one sponsoring the job agency he’d been to, as well as Barbara’s information pamphlet. It sounded like the owner, or at least head of the organization, was a man going by the name "Brucie", which was kind of odd but he tried not to judge.

A first layer of paint was quickly applied to the outside and he moved on to the inside. The radio lady was babbling about a bridge project that was happening between one of the main downtown islands and some of the outer districts. He didn’t really care about this so he zoned out then, when she didn’t change subjects, eventually switched to another News station.

This one was a global network. Some of the cities the host, an older man, mentioned were completely foreign to him. He kept talking about a "Metropolis", which seemed like the most redundant name for a city Peter had ever heard.

The program introduced him to other super heroes, some of which he remembered reading about on Wikipedia. There was Superman, Flash, Wonder Woman…

Gotham was briefly mentioned, in a slightly joking way. The host cracked a joke about the crime rate, as if it was some kind of laughing matter and Peter turned the radio off in annoyance. People had died in that incident. Even if death was common here, it didn’t make it right to make fun of victims like that, especially so soon after it had happened.

He finished working in silence, going until  the locker’s surface felt smooth under his touch. The paint was quick to dry and he only had to wait half an hour between each layers, which he spent putting the wood boards in front of the locker, figuring out where he needed to cut them, then turning them into what would eventually be shelves.

At five in the afternoon the paint had fully dried, just in time for him to close his windows. The rain had finally decided to fall, thundering on the roof above him, and he wanted to spare his floor the flooding. The sound was a bit overwhelming, sounding louder than what he had expected. It was soothing too, in an odd way.

He had a bit more time left before having to head inside so he started making notches inside of the locker, where he would set his shelves and the stick he’d use to hang his clothes on. Thankfully, he didn’t have much so he should be able to fit it all in.

The wood fit in easily, the hanger first, then the shelves. He took a few steps back, examining his handiwork. It looked good, better than he thought he could achieve, in fact. The red had been a good choice, the paintwork looked brand new, despite him having used simple, cheap brushes and not an airbrush. The sanding pads had turned out a bit hard to use as pressing down too much scratched the paint, but he had eventually gotten the hand of it.

He didn’t have anything to hang his clothes off of so he folded his clean ones instead and slid them into the shelves. He only had four shirts and two pairs of pants in total and only three of those items were clean, which left a lot of space available.

He eventually stored his tools at the bottom then picked up the locker to take it off the newspapers carpet. He set it in the corner between the desk wall and the bathroom adjacent wall. It looked pretty good, made the place look a bit less empty.

And now his apartment was tidy. He had managed that, at least.

Before heading out, Peter shot a look at his umbrella. He didn’t think it was sturdy enough to survive a night of running in the wind, unfortunately. He’d just have to put on a shirt, his pizzeria hoodie, and hope for the best.

That was yet another thing he had forgotten to get : rain clothes. He’d just have to bear with the humidity for now, unfortunately.

He didn’t go out through the window, not wanting to ruin his floor because of the rain and took the stairs instead. As he climbed down to the second floor, he had to step out of the way of a burly, scarred man. It was the first time he had met one of his neighbors and the guy looked pretty much exactly like what he had pictured when thinking about them.

Big, though, mobster guys.

Then, maybe he was judging too quickly. Maybe this big dude was lacking an ID, like him, and didn’t have a choice other than live here. And maybe the pistol Peter had spotted in his jacket’s inside pocket was only there for self defense.

He really didn’t like thinking about how his neighbors could potentially all be criminals. If he had still been active as Spider-Man, it would probably have stressed him out even more, thinking about how they could spot him entering the attic. At least, now, he wouldn’t risk getting caught with the suit on, because he didn’t have a suit anymore.

It took only a dozen seconds for the water to get through his hoodie and to his skin. It was cold, of course. With his luck, he would end up catching a cold by meeting so many people in such a dreary weather.

He mourned the loss of his scarf, fallen during the fight against Firefly. He probably needed to get another one to prepare for the colder half of winter, which was quickly approaching. January would be hard to get through without proper gear, if the temperatures were at all like the ones in New York. At least his landlord was kind enough to keep the hearing on through winter. That had not been a luxury they had always been afforded, back as a child.

Soaked to the bone, he made it to Marco’s dripping with water, his socks completely drenched and his shoes so wet they were squeaking with every step. His boss took a long look at him when he entered the pizzeria then sighed, looking exhausted.

Peter’s "hello" went unanswered as the man stood up and left for the back room, limping heavily. He came back with the pizza bag, the GPS and what looked like a grey plastic tarp.

"Put this on." He told him, throwing the tarp at him. "Plastic poncho. You can keep it." He’d heard of those before but had never worn one. He knew they looked ridiculous but with the current weather, he didn’t care.

"Uh… thank you?" He grimaced as the question left his mouth, feeling awkward. His boss was nice to him, but it also made sense for him to be. He would definitely be making less money if Peter got pneumonia and couldn’t deliver food for him anymore.

As he put the ugly thing on, Marco brought something out of the kitchen. Another tarp, this time see-through. He started pulling on it until it unfolded. It looked like a large box, a bit like his pizza bag but with some holes in it.

Oh. He realized, as the plastic sheet was wrapped around the bag that it was there to protect the food. His backpack itself wasn’t waterproof but this would make sure the pizza would stay safe. Pretty smart. Also pretty terrible looking.

"Twenty deliveries tonight." Marco grunted. "’s lot so I’m giving you 50 upfront for overtime."

Peter gratefully accepted the money, thankful for the poncho, which would protect it from the water.

"You could hire someone else." Peter told him, "And not have to pay overtime. I don’t really mind, though."

The rain was a bummer but it wasn’t that bad, now that he had something to wear for protection. He also badly needed money for his suit and web fluid, not to mention everything else he hadn’t bought for his civilian life. He had somehow managed to forget to include a med kit in his shopping list. Classic Peter move, really.

His boss didn’t look overly thrilled by his suggestion, mouth turned downwards, brows furrowed. He crossed his arms, visibly displeased at the prospect of having to take someone else on.

"I didn’t think we’d get this amount of orders this quickly." The man eventually admitted. "Getting a second kid to deliver is a big risk."

Peter could see how it could be uncomfortable, sending teens out into the Gotham night. Of course, he would be safe, even if he got shot he could always walk it off after a few days of recovering but a non-meta? It might be a bit harder for them to get through the deliveries and come back in one piece.

"I guess you could also limit the number of orders per night, if you don’t want it to get too extreme." He suggested instead, not wanting to push something that was getting him such a negative reaction. Marco nodded thoughtfully.

"I’ll think about that while you’re out. ‘Let you know when I decide, might not be today." He waved him off with a grunt. "Get to work, boy."

Peter obeyed, holding his GPS under his poncho to keep it dry. It felt weird to wear so much plastic but it worked pretty well. The water bounced off the poncho easily. It was thick and coated with something that he couldn’t identify the smell of, not some low-quality coat then. He felt a bit touched at that, and also very relieved : that was one less thing he had to worry about.

His first pizza led him to the Bowery, to a trio of plastic flower wearing men, who greeted him with smiles and cheers, sheltering from the rain in a bus stop that looked like it hadn’t been used in decades.

"Pizza, no fucking way!" One of them exclaimed when he took it out of the bag. "Since when do they deliver here?"

"Told you it’d come, brat." The oldest member of the group bragged, accepting the box Peter was handing him. "Thanks kid," he told him, "it’s nice to have some neutral parties around."

"I still can’t believe you got pizza delivered to the fucking Bowery." His friend was muttering, shaking his head.

Peter accepted the tip he was given and eagerly left the place. He was never fully comfortable around the clients he knew were gang members. Out of everyone in Gotham, they were the ones he was the most likely to end up beating up one day, when he began acting as a vigilante again.

Still in the Bowery, he ended up under an old bridge, bringing pizza to a duo who suspiciously looked like undercover cops. They looked so bored that they were probably on a stake-out. Those could get old really fast, he remembered.

They did look heartened by the delivery, cheering up a bit when they opened the box and saw the intact pizza inside.

He wished them good luck and left them to their unsubtle stake-out. At least the bridge protected them from the rain, which hadn’t always been the case for him in New York. He’d tended to hide on top of buildings, where the downpour tended to be even worse.

A surprisingly large amount of civilians had ordered in tonight, spanning all across the various districts he delivered to. It was a nice change of pace, to hand over the food to families and young adults and not get threatened at gunpoint as he did so. He made the first trip back to Marco’s with pockets full of cash and a distinct lack of blood on his clothes.

Truly, it was nice to finally get a break.

Then, he remembered how nice the previous night had been and how it had all gone downhill once he stepped into Crime Alley.

He had probably jinxed himself, thinking about that. Was he cursed to end up in a fistfight every shift?

Of course, his first delivery of his second load broke his stroke of relaxing, stress free runs by directing him straight to the GCPD headquarters in Old Gotham. Apparently, it was time to report to Gordon.

The fact the man might be the commissioner stressed him out slightly. He was afraid he would slip up, betray his identity somehow. The police couldn’t know about him being involved in the Firefly incident, they probably already assumed he was a violent meta, they might not even ask questions before shooting.

For a second, he was transported back in time, to a building lobby, to fire and gunshots and sirens and lights. A man laughing, his aunt collapsing.

Peter wondered if that night would ever stop haunting him, if the guilt would ever lessen. He didn’t know and, now, he had no one to ask it to.

Still.

He had to keep on going, even if that meant meeting up with the potential head of the GCPD, who thought he was just a teenage informant. Lying was not his strong point, he was aware of it, but he would have to learn, and quickly.

But first, he needed to figure out if his Gordon was truly the commissioner.

No time like the present to learn how to extract information, and no better training partner than an experienced police officer.

He was so screwed.

Chapter Text

There weren’t many officers outside of the GCPD headquarters this time around. Peter could hear them inside of the station, holed up in their dry offices. He wondered if he should enter the building too, not really comfortable at the prospect of being surrounded by law enforcement.

Thankfully, Gordon hadn’t forgotten him, he could spot the man waiting under a sturdy black umbrella, a few feet from the entrance. He waved at Peter when he saw him, leading him into the parking lot again.

Guess the man didn’t fear rain.

They walked to the very back, up to a police van which had its back door open. Gordon sat in the large trunk, used to carry men and women through the city, and Peter did too, after some hesitation. His feet hung under the rain, as he stayed on the very edge of the vehicle’s exit, but the rest of his body was relatively protected. The vehicle faced away from the wind.

Was this how the GCPD met all of their informants when the weather was like this? With how heavily the water was falling, it was hard to see anything further than ten feet away, or hear sounds other than the thundering of the rain, it did wonders when it came to privacy. 

Gordon didn’t light a cigarette this time, which he was grateful for considering how close they were sitting. The older man accepted the pizza box he handed him, opening it and generously giving him a slice.

"Seen anything interesting during your deliveries?" The policeman asked him after a while, his voice barely audible over the sound of the rainfall.

Peter had thought about what he would tell him all the way from the Bowery to Old Gotham. Firefly was out of the question, so was Harley, he didn’t want anyone to dig into why he had a shotgun and where his papers and license were.

That left only a few of the strange encounters he had had over his first week.

"Anything out of the ordinary," Gordon pushed him. “Might be meaningless to you but could be important to us."

"Well…"

He lowered his head, deep in thought. Anything odd that had happened…

"There’s a lot of activity in Crime Al- sorry, Park Row. Last time I went, there were at least several gangs there.” He tried to grasp for anything more to say, as this did not seem like anything new to Gordon. "Uh… one of the gangs was kinda kept apart from the rest."

This seemed to get his interest. The man perked up slightly. “Any idea which one?"

Peter remembered the confrontation. He shook his head, then hesitated and nodded.

"I don’t know the name but they were all wearing black jackets."

He was handed a twenty dollar bill for that piece of intel. "Anything else?" Gordon wondered.

"Maybe. But I’m not sure it’s-"

"Go ahead."

“Uh ok."

Rain pattered on his shoes as he recalled the odd encounter, it dripped down and pooled on the ground. His battered sneakers were useless against the downpour and he could feel his feet ache with the cold.

"I delivered to a man who lives behind a bunker door a few days ago. It had a lot of locks. A lot." He cringed internally, hoping he wouldn’t be asked to explain how he had noticed that.

Gordon frowned, stroking his chin pensively. "Anything else you can remember about this man?"

He focused as hard as he could. "He had gloves on." He said, "Even when touching the pizza. And he had me play a game for tips, asked me a riddle."

Over the rain, because they were so close and he was paying close attention, he could hear Gordon’s heart beat slightly faster in excitement. For some reason, this information seemed to be of great importance to him.

"Do you recall where in town that happened?" The man asked, hand flicking to his pocket as if to grab a smoke then shooting back awkwardly when he changed his mind.

"I don’t know the exact address," he admitted, "but it was somewhere South-East of the Bowery. And it was a basement apartment."

"Part of a building?"

Peter nodded, remembering the row of white faced gothic houses. It had been in the Bowery alright, he even remembered seeing some "joker boys" hanging around the area. He had delivered to so many people, however, that outside of the weirdest details, he had forgotten a lot about the interaction. The man’s face, for example, was blurry in his mind.

This one tip earned him a whopping hundred dollars. He felt his heart skip a bit when he realized he was now carrying double that on himself. His suit budget looked like it was expanding pretty fast.

"Thank you so much sir," he grinned, pocketing the cash.

"Thank you, kiddo. That was some good info, could really help us out. Anything else you spotted?"

He shook his head, still not wanting to mention Harley or Firefly too scared to implicate himself. Before Gordon could dismiss him, he remembered the question he had meant to ask him. Things had gone a lot better than he had expected, with the man treating him gently, which was surprising for a police officer and he was feeling a bit emboldened by it.

"Sir… I have a question."

Gordon grunted, looking impatient. He had closed the box again and was now looking at his smartphone, a sleek black thing that made Peter drool with envy. He missed having access to technology.

"Sorry if it sounds weird but… are you the commissioner?"

The astonished stare he got as the only reply to his question made him blush deeply. Gordon opened his mouth to answer, closed it again then, out of nowhere, he started to laugh.

”If I am the commissioner?" He chuckled. "That’s a good one, never heard it before." Peter’s flush grew to reach his neck, he felt like an idiot.

Once he was done laughing, the policeman grinned at him, an expression the teen had never seen on the older man’s face before. So far, he had acted serious and his only smiles had been to make him feel more at ease. This, however, looked genuine.

“You’re my first informant who isn’t from Gotham, sorry about that, I should have expected it." Gordon shook his head. “I am the commissioner. I thought you already knew."

Peter didn’t feel as intimidated as he was expecting to upon hearing this. Their talk that night had made him feel significantly better about his police contact. Privacy appeared to be something many people in Gotham were willing to respect and he hadn’t expected a police officer to do the same, yet he did. The man had only been concerned with professional information, not about him or his life. He hadn’t asked about anything specific either, other than pushing for details about the location of the bunker, letting him pick what intel he offered up.

This was, all in all, a lot less dramatic and stressful than what he had pictured earlier. He felt foolish, and also like a bit of a jerk. Gordon was a good man from what he could see, and he had assumed he wouldn’t be one. It wasn’t like him, to judge so quickly.

There was something about the police in general that made him anxious, recently. He had tried to ignore it again and again but, sometimes, when he heard emergency sirens, he could smell smoke and blood, he could hear a man laughing hysterically, feel the hot stain of blood on his clothes, the stillness of a woman’s chest in his arms. Every flash of police light reminded him of bullets, tearing through the nights despite his screams.

He didn’t know why those things would come to him, in such a relaxed setting, invading his mind against his will. He had to clench his teeth hard when he shook Gordon’s hand in goodbyes. He felt …

Angry. Afraid. Sad. Lost. Lonely.

 

He left Old Gotham as fast as he could after that, disturbed by the way his heart was betraying him. Cops were the good guys, weren’t they? Why did he have so much trouble trusting them?

He wished M-J was there to help him talk through his feelings. They had always tried to that, work through hard times together. He missed her so much and failed like he had failed their relationship. He had promised her that he would make her remember him. There was no way he could keep that vow now.

Peter ended his shift later than he ever had before, deep into the night, probably one or two. Marco hadn’t decided if he wanted a new hire yet by the time he came back. Despite the hour, he had still been waiting for him. As he often did, the cook slid him a box. It wasn’t a pizza this time but a salad, loaded with meat, cheese and bread.

"Used to sell those too, back in the day. Gimme your opinion, might put it back on the menu. Small ones go with pizza, big ones, well…"

He shrugged, digging in his pockets for Peter’s salary. 100$ that night. He was carrying on himself a lot more than he had been able to ever earn since he got to Gotham. It made the prospect of getting furniture for his workshop a lot less daunting, suddenly. He could probably find a good sewing machine and modify it to work on harder materials with only half of what he had earned that night. That was without even counting the money left in his desk.

He did the maths, walking out of the pizzeria with the salad box in his hands. Gordon had given him 120, Marco 150. His other deliveries had earned him a total of 60 in tips, and he had 100 back at his apartment. 430 dollars. In only two days.

He had never been able to make this much money this fast. Most high schooler jobs did not pay that well, and he remembered M-J often took a week or more at the coffee shop to make this much, and that included her tips.

His appartement looked slightly better than it had every other time he had came back after a night of work. The red locker added a touch of color and life that the room had been missing. He wished he still had his old movie posters and ship miniatures, to make the place feel more like home.

The feeling faded as he remembered that he wouldn’t ever be home, couldn’t ever be home. There was no one to share this place with him, as pretty and put together as he made it, it wouldn’t fix the loneliness he was still feeling.

He turned on the radio and dug into the salad, not wanting to keep thinking about his situation. It was pretty good, and more than nourishing enough. He had seen traditional Italian places offer other meals than pizza before, so he wasn’t surprised by it.
He wondered if Marco’s had ever thought about doing pasta, those were pretty easy to package.

Also, he really liked pasta.

It wouldn’t be very on brand, though, for him to start going around delivering noodles and, if Marco was alone in the kitchen, he probably wouldn’t have time to deal with so many different recipes.

At least salad had similar ingredients as some of the more traditional pizza. Spices, cheese, vegetables, meat, mushrooms and many other could be shared between the two. A bit harder to do that with pasta…

Disappointing but not the end of the world. At least it gave him some variety from the endless cycle of ramen noodles and pizza, and it was probably better for his health, too. He didn’t really gain weight, he needed too many calories in a day to be able to put on fat easily, but he did know a bit about nutrition. Technically, he was aware that it wasn’t good for him to only eat a specific kind of food.

Now the hard part was actually doing something about it. He didn’t have the patience to try and figure out a way to eat healthily and without having to share the basement fridges with his shady neighbors, not when he had Spider suits to think about and a whole city to investigate. He could think about that later, especially if Marco’s started selling other food than pizza.

Tomorrow, he decided, he would start researching again. He would have to stop by the library, probably, unless he should go and buy some actual books. That would allow him to read while at his apartment, which was a boon.

Plus, he had to find a map of Gotham somehow.

Peter threw himself on the mattress,  which he had dragged under the second roof window, so that he could see the sky. The rain was still falling hard, reducing every other outside sounds to mere whispers. He was starting to find comfort in sleeping in an attic; the height and easy access to the roof alone were worth it.

Next to him, his radio was playing a tune he had never heard before, probably from a band unique to this universe. The foreign song helped him calm down, oddly. He was learning new things, meeting new people.

And, tomorrow, he would start prepping his apartment for research. Getting books was a good idea, but he still needed to use the computer for some informations he wouldn’t be able to get that way. Book store in the morning, Public Library in the afternoon, then.

Once that was done, he hoped he would have enough intel to decide what suit he wanted to develop first. He had started envisioning yet another one, a stealth oriented suit that would blend in with the darkness of Gotham. He had been partially inspired by the few pictures he had seen of the city’s vigilantes : most of them wore black.

What should he call it? Night Spider? Dark Spider? Hmm… Maybe the Black Spider or the Sneaking Spider.

He fell asleep halfway through his musing. He did not have nightmares that night, for the first time in a long while.
Notes:

    Introducing new characters soon…… maybe some people can figure out who lol but I have two people in mind specifically.

    Italian salads are delicious.

    Peter is gonna be able to start working on his suits soon :) if he can bring himself to take apart the iron spider at least lol

Chapter 13: Figuring it out
Summary:

    Peter does research. Yes I looked at Google to see what his webs are made of ;-;

Notes:

    I really appreciate all the name suggestions last chap and will probably use one of them BUT it’s for the suit not his hero name ^^" I’m sorry I might go back and change the last few sentences a bit to make it more obvious.
    Peter names his suits I thought it would be cute lol.

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

Although the Bowery had a great deal of pawn shops and cheap furniture, it lacked in the one thing Peter was looking for this day : books.

It made sense. Unless they were exceedingly rare or signed by a famous author, those didn’t tend to go for that much secondhand. People who could afford buying new books wouldn’t be living in this area of Gotham in the first place, and people who had to buy their books used didn’t resell them as they tended to be too damaged by then.

That meant Peter had to go away from the Bowery and into one of the richer districts to find what he wanted. He ended up walking over to Old Gotham, which he at least was more familiar with than any of the other more stable districts due to his trips to the GCPD headquarters.

The Clocktower cast its shadows on the streets of the district as he entered it, looming over the buildings. It was impressively tall, for a construct of its kind, and he wondered what the view looked like at the top.

Maybe next time his shift ended early he could swing by and check it out. He had promised himself he would take the time to climb Gotham’s skyscrapers and, although this one tower was ancient and smaller than most of them, it had an old school charm to it.

Yep. He would definitely climb the Clocktower. He even felt somewhat eager at the idea, a nice change from the darkness that had been plaguing him recently.

Due to the GCPD Headquarters being located in its heart, Old Gotham had a much higher police presence than any other districts he’d been into. Despite that, he could still see some signs of gang activities, further from the main streets and down into the back alleys.

No one was passed out high on the sidewalk, though. The place was a lot more put together than the Bowery, and it evidently came with a rise in rent as the people walking the streets alongside him were all wearing new, quality clothes.

He felt a bit out of place with his pizzeria hoodie, baggie pants and torn shirt but no one seemed to mind. Apparently, he wasn’t the first poor kid to make his way out to the better districts. The fact he wasn’t wearing a gun, probably helped with that. Most of the civilians in this district were not carrying firearms, although he could see and smell some on the occasional passerby.

Interesting how much the mere presence of a larger police force seemed to keep most of the gangs away from the daylight. They had been so blatant back in the Bowery that he had almost forgotten that this was not regular behavior.

Then, the Bowery wasn’t the only district with rampant violence. East Side, when he had been there, and Park Row, which was at the border between different neighborhoods, both could be worse than it sometimes.

Park Row especially. He had never been to Crime Alley without ending up in a fight of some kind. Even before Firefly’s bombs became the GCPD’s main concern, the place had been rife with drugs and brutality.

Peter shook his head, wishing he could head back out as Spider-Man to help in those smaller ways. He wasn’t so foolish to try and fight a major villain, not when he had so little intel, but with a full suit and his webs he could easily take care of a few street level thugs.

He didn’t have a suit, though, and his web fluid was almost completely gone. He maybe had enough left for a couple swings, but even that was optimistic.

He wondered if he would be able to find a chem kit in the Bowery’s pawn shops. Considering the drugs problems in the area, it would probably be a common item, he just hadn’t looked at that kind of merchandise last time he visited the stores. That was a necessary expenditure, unlike his older, alternate self, he wasn’t able to produce his own strings.

They had talked about it, while waiting for the big fight. The man needed even more food than the two of them to sustain his abilities, but thankfully not as much as a regular spider would need, proportionally.

The webs had been much stronger and stickier that what should have been possible, he remembered, thinking back to the fight. He had to carefully design his own fluid and this other Peter just happened to be gifted with the perfect ability right after his bite.

He had avoided recalling their meeting, not because he didn’t like them, quite the opposite, but due to everything that happened around it. As odd as it seemed, meeting two alternate versions of him hadn’t been as impactful as what had come after. He didn’t want to think about that, though, not in public.

To distract himself, he looked around, taking in those surprisingly orderly Gotham streets.

The stores in Old Gotham had bigger windows than any of the ones he’d seen previously, and their doors were clean. The displays were obviously worked on thoughtfully, with many of them shining and twinkling with Christmas lights and fake snow.

He hadn’t seen this many lights in a while. He found himself dragging his feet and looking into the stores. Expensive clothes, chocolates and technology. Gifts for the holidays. It made him nostalgic, yet bitter, in a way. He didn’t have anyone to buy anything for, even if he had the budget.

Peter turned away from the colorful displays, clenching his fists inside the pockets of his hoodie. Just his luck that he would land in a world about to celebrate the one holiday during which you saw family and friends just when he had lost all of his.

Bookstores weren’t hard to find but he had to look into smaller, dimmer streets to find some that weren’t dedicated to new releases. He eventually managed to find a shabby little store, only a few streets away from the Clocktower, filled to the brim with old and used books.

An old man looked up at him from behind the counter when he entered the shop, which didn’t look so little anymore now that he was under its roof. Another employee perked up as well, a much younger girl, probably a student. Peter could see some other clients walking in-between the full shelves. Each section was indicated by a little sign on the low stone ceiling, above the corresponding row.

He made his way to the "Tourism and Travel" area, hoping to find a map that wasn’t too outdated, or maybe a guide to the city.

A lot of the books he found there were about other places in the world, including some he had never heard of before. He almost grabbed one about Metropolis, which sounded familiar, but decided to save it for later. Even if the differences between universes were fascinating, he had to focus on what was of importance to him right now.

First, research for his apartment, then some time online at the library. He could look up Metropolis then, but also dig into some of the names he had heard over the week. He needed to know more about Gordon if he was going to work with him. Since the man was the commissioner, he could most likely easily find intel about him online.

After a bit, he found a small shelf, the bottom one, filled with travel books about Gotham. He flipped through their covers and spines, trying to find the most recent one.
One of them had only been published two years ago. Small and compact, with a sober black cover, it was welcomingly titled "Surviving Gotham”. The under title did not inspire much more confidence either as it read : "A guide to America’s most murderous city". The author was left unnamed, probably a native, then.

It had detailed descriptions of many of the districts Peter already knew and a whole section on the safest places in town. He grabbed it, interested to find out more about the neighborhoods he hadn’t been able to identify yet.

All of the others documents on the shelf were too old to have usable info but he did find an outdated map, stained and yellowed by age that, when unfolded, showed a surprisingly artistic and detailed rendition of the city. He took that as well. He would use it as a starting point for his investigation into Gotham, it was the perfect size to be clipped onto a board and then on the wall. He had always secretly wanted to do that.

Maybe he should grab some red strings, then it would be exactly like in a movie.

Amused at the idea, Peter decided to stay a bit longer to browse the shop. He liked it, the overflowing shelves and occasional piles of books and magazines, the sheer size of the store, which had many more sections than one would think when looking at it from the outside. It went down into the ground into an even bigger area. It felt comfortable.

In the "Biology and Genetics" area, he found a document penned by several researchers, none of whom he’d ever heard the name of before, explaining the origin of the discovery and everything known about the meta gene. This one was a must have for him. He was not a meta but, to everyone else in this world, it would be the first assumption if he was seen using his power. It had been the first assumptions the journalists reporting on his involvement with Firefly, after all. He had to make sure his powers were accurate to what was known by the general public.

To his surprise, he found several books on alien biology, based on encounters that the people of this universe had had with them. Extraterrestrials were a thing there, and a thing that had been studied in more depth than back in his own home. Once again, the names written were unfamiliar. No mentions of Asgardians, for example.

Strange, how whole civilizations had disappeared in between those universes yet New-York and much of the cities he was familiar with had remained.

Aliens were a fascinating topic but not one that would help him immediately. Instead, he headed to the "World History" section. As he had suspected, he found a whole trove of superheroes and villains oriented books. It had been the same, back at home, hundreds and hundreds of works had been written after the Invasion, and even before, about Captain America. He even had a couple of the comics, when he was a kid!

His hands were starting to get a bit full, as he got three books from that section. One of them was quite soberly titled "Superheroes in the contemporary world", but two were focused on Gotham: "A short history of Gotham’s organized crime" and "The Bat Clan : A new form of vigilantism".

All of those, added up to the one science fiction book he allowed himself to pick up, a classic Foundation anthology, by Isaac Asimov, cost him barely twenty dollars. Peter really, really liked used bookstores.

The store’s owner rasped a laugh when he saw the books he had selected.

"New in town?" He asked him, scanning his items with a machine that looked like it had seen better times. “Should head back home if you can."

”You’re not the first person to say that." Peter sighed.

The old man hummed, unsurprised, and handed him his books, safely packed into a paper bag. He didn’t have any weapons on him but, when he reached out to grab the bills Peter was handing him, the teenager could smell metal and powder on his hand. A firearm was hidden somewhere, and he knew how to use it.

It seemed like self defense was a necessity for shop owners in Gotham, even if the only thing they sold was old books.

Five books richer, Peter headed back to the Bowery. There were many things he needed to buy in order furnish his research and workshop areas, including more pens and a board for his wall. He hoped to have enough on him to find a sewing machine as well, although that wasn’t a priority yet. He still hadn’t extracted anything from the Iron Spider.

He now blended in well enough that he didn’t have to be overly careful when walking in the streets. He still kept track of any suspicious civilian he could see or feel in the area, and especially of whoever was walking behind him, of course. He didn’t want to be jumped for appearing to relaxed.

No one targeted him, though, and he made it to his destination without any trouble. Immediately, he started digging around for a chem kit. As expected, he found several of them in the back, some looking dirty and used, some relatively new.

He knew from previous gifts that new chem kits could run quite high, even without any chemicals included. There were only utensils in those, most of them made out of glass and fragile.

The prices ranged from twenty dollars, which included dirty and occasionally damaged kits, to three hundred, which were of obviously professional quality. He could smell substances coming out of both, some he was able to recognize, unfortunately.

Yep, someone had definitely been either synthesizing or testing drugs with those.

It hurt a lot to grab a 150$ kit out of the pile. It was large and would probably have been heavy to a non meta, stored inside of a sleek metallic case, all of its pieces were in perfect state and looked brand new. It was a good compromise between the broken, dirty bags and the luxury items he definitely could not afford.

The back of the case proudly announced that this was "the perfect compromise for a professional on a budget". Since labs usually payed for equipments as long as they stayed inside of their walls, this was most likely not aimed at researchers. He sighed. What kind of people owned this kit before him and how the hell did it end up in this shop?

He didn’t feel comfortable handing this much money over but he had no choice. He hadn’t thought about having to pay so much for a quality kit : May had gifted him one for his fourteenth birthday and he had been using it ever since then. He didn’t expect them to be this expensive… His heart twisted at the memory. His aunt had always spoiled him, as soon as she got the opportunity to.

His hands shook slightly as the cash changed hands and he made a beeline for his apartment. He didn’t want to walk around with something this fragile (and expensive) in the Bowery. It only took him a dozen minutes to reach his roof, which he was very careful walking around on. He could not afford to drop the case. He slid into his room slowly, using a bit of his unusual ability to stick to items to keep a safe grip on the expensive equipment.

Setting the supplies on his desk as gently as he could, Peter sighed, rubbing a hand through his hair. He felt exhausted mentally, disappointed in himself for spending so much money. Maybe he should have gotten one of the cheaper kits, but they had been damaged and…

This one was bigger, allowing him to make more web fluid in a batch, and the fact it was clean would significantly boost the synthetic webbing’s quality. It was a good compromise and a good choice.

Now, he had to find all components.

Back in his world, it had cost him quite a bit of his allowance to gather them all up, and he didn’t know if he even had enough on him right now. He would probably have to chose between his webs and his suit at first, he just didn’t have the budget to start working on both right away.

First, he would need salicylic acid, which was around thirty dollars for a large bottle. Then, toulene, one of the cheapest items to procure.

Methanol, however, tended to be more expensive than those two, and he also needed it for his formula. Between the first three components, it would likely cost him at least a hundred.

And there was, of course, the carbon tetrachloride issue. The product had been deemed a restricted substance by the government back in his universe and, if it was also the case in this one, it would make the price shoot up. He just had to hope for the best.

Potassium carbonate would be easy to find. His last ingredient, however, could go for as much as 90 a bottle. Ethyl acetate had been hard for him to get back in the days.

He hadn’t thought it through, he should have done the maths earlier. All of this would probably add another 250 to his expenses, and he hadn’t even started working on the suit yet.

Peter took a deep breath. Panicking now wouldn’t solve anything. Stocking up on vigilante supplies was expensive, more than what he had expected, but he would just have to live with that.

Not wanting to go out and spend more money quite yet, he started setting up his little lab, having to pull some of the clutter on the desk into his locker. The shotgun felt extremely awkward to handle when he moved it. He would have to work on the thing as soon as he could, he already had some project ideas for it.

He would need webbing for it to work, though.

After eating a disgusting lunch of ramen and onions, which he was growing more and more tired of, Peter headed back out. He hadn’t brought any more cash with him, still rattled by how much he had had to spend. Even when he got the exclusive Avengers game, the only video game he had ever bought new, with all of his pocket money back when he was fifteen, he didn’t have to spend much more than fifty or so dollars.

Old Gotham looked exactly the same as it had earlier in the day, with now even more people spilling in the streets, heading to their mid-day break. He looked at them enter restaurants or order at food trucks, wishing he could do the same. His mouth still tasted like onions and noodles. He couldn’t spare the money, however, not when his Spider Arsenal was completely empty.

Barbara wasn’t at the front desk of the library, he noticed. Instead, another student was manning it, greeting him with a glazed, distracted look on their face. He couldn’t help but feel a bit disappointed at that. He barely knew her but the woman was a familiar, friendly face in a sea of strangers.

The computer room was empty, allowing him to sit in front of one of the most recent models. It even had a flat screen and a bluetooth mouse! He wished he had enough to get his own computer, or even a phone, but this would have to be enough.

He could probably get the last of the two, if he spent all of his remaining budget on it. He didn’t want to grab something too cheap as he would eventually modify it to hijack police radios and, hopefully, also some gang communications. It also needed to be able to connect with the trackers he hoped he would be able to salvage from the Iron Spider.

His latest suit had been designed to send them out with a simple command from him but he would have to design another, simpler contraption to use them now. He missed his Stark connections almost everyday. It had been so easy to work on upgrades and repairs, back when he had access to all of that brand new, often secret and exclusive technology.

Back into the guest session, he began his research.

Looking into Gordon revealed a goldmine of information. The man had been in the police force since he had graduated, and the articles went back a lot. He had first been promoted to captain after helping rat out corruption inside of the GCPD. A good sign, to say the least.

A lot of controversies came from other cities’ law enforcement due to Gordon’s habit of working with vigilantes. That also made him breathe a sigh of relief. Some vigilantes in Gotham were metas, that he was willing to work with them, or at least with the one Peter knew of, Signal, showed that he wasn’t one to judge too quickly.

Gordon was also linked with several arrests of many criminal figureheads, including the mafia network of the Falcons family. Almost all of the city’s rogues had, at some point, been put in jail thanks to him. He was incredibly popular in most of the population, and had often been targeted by the mob.

Now feeling much more comfortable at the idea of working with the Commissioner, and not wanting to look too much into his private life, he started reading news articles related to crime in the city. Everyday, dozens more seemed to pop up, but he restricted the search to the ones that were related to gangs or vigilante intervention.

The villains of this town were apparently known to rally behind them dozens if not hundreds of street criminals. Some of them, like Killer Croc, worked alone, though. A man named "the Penguin", or Oswald Cobblepot, was cited as one of the main suspects behind a lot of the more unsavory activities in the city.

He focused on him, finding a disheartening high amount of "Penguin freed again!" articles in the midst of all of the “Penguin suspected of being involved in shoot-out/heist/assassination” ones. He was the kind of man who was very careful to keep himself clean from all evil deeds, then. Dangerous.

He had never really went against someone like that, it was way above his pay grade, and he didn’t feel confident doing it even now. As Spider-Man, he specialized in recon, small street fights and all out super powered battles. The last and middle ones, though, were also the only fields of vigilantism, outside of tech, that he had any experience in.

He was aware that he would make a good spy, with his unnatural flexibility and his ability to stick up any solid surfaces, but he had never had time to focus too much on it. Maybe he should, if he wanted to be of any use against a man like the Penguin.

From what he could read, the only way he would be able to defeat the criminal would be to get his hands on some incriminating material. Those were often disproven by corrupted judges and jurys, though, so they had to be absolutely water-tight. He would have to infiltrate some of the man’s hideouts to have a chance to find any of that.

He shook his head. He didn’t have enough experience to deal with Penguin right now. Hopefully, the other vigilantes were better at handling him.

Closing off the Cobblepot tabs, he started looking into more of Gotham’s rogues. Killer Croc was one who sounded like he could potentially be useful against. Extreme strength, protective scales, giant teeth, extended breath holding abilities, enhanced speed and stamina… outside of the teeth and scales it sounded a lot like a version of his own powers.

A weaker version of his powers, he soon discovered, finding a report written by doctors who had studied Croc in what was only referred to as "Arkham", a prison, if he remembered correctly. The meta human could lift a maximum amount of two tons. He knew for a fact that his limits, proportional to a spider’s, were much higher.

The scales would be the real challenge. They were as hard as iron, the report said, and no civilian should under any attempt try to hit or shoot Croc, as it would result in more arm than good.

Yes, because apparently bullets bounced off of the meta’s scales, unless they were very carefully aimed at weak spots and scars. He wouldn’t be able to pull his punch with him, even if he wanted to.

That was someone Peter could potentially fight. Low levels of situational awareness and decision making skills were also noted in the public files. He felt like it was a bit shady, to put it all online like this, but Gotham seemed to care more about the safety of its civilians than the privacy of its villains.

It still felt invasive to read that Croc had been diagnosed with a severe mood disorder that caused him to blow up in anger at non augmented humans. He squirmed in his seat, uncomfortable. This wasn’t the kind of things you were supposed to learn about someone when you didn’t even know them.

Still, the explosive nature of his crimes meant that he very rarely planned to do anything devious during them and simply lashed out in anger. That, he knew pretty well. He could handle it.

It was odd, how much better he felt now that he knew that he wasn’t completely useless in Gotham. Most villains, he didn’t have any experience with but someone who focused more on brawl than brains? He could fight that person.

Now, he would have to keep looking in the rogues, finding the ones he could potentially fight and the ones he had to avoid at all costs. Excitement made his heart thump faster, his fingers flying over the keyboard as he typed and read. He wouldn’t remember all those names, but he still had the pamphlet at home. This time, he would be able to keep working on it while away from the library.

Bane was another figure with potential. The man showed significantly more cunning than Croc and tended to have henchmen along with him, but he had a very obvious weakness, one Peter could exploit relatively easily. Unlike the previous criminal he had researched, this one relied not on the meta gene but on a mysterious serum to draw his strength from.

There was a lot less information about him than there had been about Oswald Cobbeplot or Killer Croc, and nothing about the contents of his serum. Maybe a mix of stimulants and steroids paired with some muscle enhancing-no… It was more likely to be something more like Captain America’s own-… No what if-

He shook his head, stopping his train of thoughts before it could get too far away from him. Bane. He had to focus on that.

If Peter could cut the supply of serum, which was constant, it would give him an edge. He could see from the few pictures of the man after being defeated, that the tubes leading to the back of his neck were often off.

Maybe, if he was on a good day and had all of his gear, he could take Bane. He needed to look more into him, but his time at the library was running out and he would soon have to head to work. He wanted to get some more leads before.

Now focusing mostly on metas and other augmented rogues, Peter started looking through the amount Gotham had to offer. Those people, extraordinary due to their bodies first, would be the least likely to trick him.

Something in the list caught his eye and he blinked, incredulous.

Man-Bat?

Wasn’t the main vigilante in Gotham named Batman? Was this a copy-cat or-… He clicked the link and sat in stunned silence as a picture slowly loaded. A giant bat-Human hybrid. An angry giant bat-Human hybrid.

In a city where the lead hero was bat themed, they also had a bat themed villain? That seemed like an incredible coincidence.

He was unable to focus on anything after that, coming back again and again to the sheer ridiculousness of it all. Batman and Man-Bat fighting each other… what would it look like? If it happened, it would be hard not to laugh at it.

He ended up leaving early, more reading was pointless in his state. He felt almost like he was in a good mood, it was surprising.

The Christmas lights still hurt as he walked away from Old Gotham’s center, but he was able to push the bitterness down and instead enjoy the thought that this city, no matter how dark, was also incredibly silly.

At least now he knew that Spider-Man wouldn’t be useless against some of the rogues. He would just have to restrict his involvement to the few villains he thought he would have a chance against.

Things were starting to look up a bit for his vigilante career.
Notes:

    Foreshadowing some bullshit that might happen…… or maybe not.
    Also lol at Peter wanting to fight Bane my man has no idea.
    Next chapter will either be terrible pain or introduce a new friend. I don’t know yet. Both happen roughly at the same time.

    ALSO:
    Some of you may have seen in my other fanfictions that I’m a huge Dark Souls fan and the studio that made it released a new game yesterday, which my husband got me as a surprise gift.
    So I’m moving from updates every day to an update once every two days because I love suffering and dying in video games.

Chapter 14: Destroying Memories
Summary:

    Peter disassemble the Iron Spider.

Notes:

(See the end of the chapter for notes.)
Chapter Text

The suit was laid down in front of him, on a tarp he had grabbed from one of the many stores in the Bowery. From the outside, it looked like a perfectly ordinary superhero costume but, when he brushed his fingers against it, he could feel cold metal and tiny mechanisms under its surface. This suit was so much more than what it looked like from the outside.

Despite the technology inside of it, the Iron Spider had died when he left his universe and it hadn’t come back to life ever since. It was supposed to be self sufficient, running on Stark Industries’ best energy gathering and redistributing system, yet it was now completely off, with no sign of ever powering back up. 

He wondered if it was the trip between worlds that had damaged it or maybe simply the differences between their two universes. Although most universal rules of physics seemed to be shared between the two Earths he had lived on, he couldn’t assume that everything was identical. Vibranium, the element discovered by Tony all those years ago, had only impacted the twenty first century. Any other recent scientific breakthroughs could have been something unique to his world, as he had no way of knowing if it existed there or not.

For that, he would either need to work his way up to an important lab position, or manage to get in the good graces of someone important enough to know about any of this.

He sighed, resting his palm against the suit. Peter Parker was a nobody, especially in this universe. And although there were heroes in this world and what appeared to be hero organizations, Spider-Man was not active nor well known here.

It didn’t help that he had landed in perhaps the most violent city of North America, where it seemed the average response to any form of meta activity was to take out a gun and shoot at it.

He was only a pizza boy, as far as the world cared, and pizza boys didn’t get access to information like this.

Technically, if he studied physics for a few more years and managed to get a secure lab and all the equipment he needed, he could perhaps try to figure out one or two of those major differences between the rules of the two universes. It would require a lot of time though, and a significant amount of money.

He didn’t have either.

His heart twinged at the reminder of what could have been. MIT with MJ and Ned, May waiting for him back in New York, a bright and happy future.

He screwed it all up. For himself. For May.

Hopefully his friends got a second chance at life, with Stran-… Stephen’s last spell. They could get their happy ending. And he hadn’t given up either. He would never allow himself to give up.

Peter’s hands were shaking. His stomach felt heavy, upset. He knew he was trying to distract himself from the task he had to finish but-…

It was so hard.

He had so many memories connected to this suit. Most of them were painful yes, but this was his last connection to his home. Well, that and his web shooters, of course.

It hurt to have to take it apart and he had expected it to, that was why he had delayed it so much, even after getting the necessary tools. He couldn’t wait any longer though, he had no more excuses. Earlier that day, he had found a cheap sewing machine and, although he hadn’t made the trip to find the kind of fabric needed for a super suit, he managed to kit the machine out with enough modifications for him to create pretty much anything he wanted.

With the welding gear and precision computer tools, that was all he needed to scrap the Iron Spider. The one and only thing he was missing was the willpower to do it.

He took another calming breath. He needed to stop thinking and start acting.

The Iron Spider wasn’t an easy suit to take apart, even if he had worked on it for several years now, and knew its blueprints by heart. It was a marvel of technology, originally designed by a man much older and experienced than himself. He understood most of the way it worked but still felt very inadequate as he started gathering his equipment.

The least complicated aspect of the suit was its internal skeleton, the same since the original one, made of an alliage of different metals. This frame was stronger along the arms and legs, although it still covered the rest of his body, different joints clicking into place with hundreds and hundreds of small plates, thousands of fibers strung together along those, keeping it all together.

That, he knew, was the easiest thing to dismantle in the suit. That was why he had, very carefully, turned it inside-out, making it so that the parts closest to his skin were now exposed. The frame laid there, under a few layers of armor, cables, nanopods and computer parts.

A lot less layers than on the other side, which held even more plating, parts, and the lines for his secondary web shooters, included into the suit itself.

Slowly, Peter stated working on the exterior, peeling off a first layer of armor on the suit’s thigh. Everything below the knee had been destroyed during the fight against Firefly. A big issue with having such a technologically advanced suit was that a lot of its parts were susceptible to very high temperatures.

Most of the back and the shoulders had also been burned to the point where he had to cut away the edges around the damage. Metal had melted together, ruining all nano material and computer information there. Peter’s heart sunk as he realized what it meant.

The most important data in the suit was stored around his head, which made the loss that much more disheartening. Both his shoulders had been ripped away, data blown into the wind. Whatever program had been loaded there he would have to rewrite. The nanobots and every other complex sensors and computing systems would be useless until this was fixed. And he didn’t even know what had been lost yet, just that he probably had weeks-or months of work ahead of him.

He felt extremely tired. To program that was not only a step above his own skill, since Ned, MJ and Tony’s notes and AIs had helped him significantly the first time around, but something he needed a functioning computer for. His own computer. Not one from the public library.

Another shopping trip, then. At least once he had the budget. He was probably going to replace a lot of whatever he got in the future with computer parts from the Iron Spider anyways so it shouldn’t be that much…

Expenses kept adding up. Even with a job, not having a sponsor behind him was a serious hindrance to his ability to get back to the field.

Peter shook his head. Focus, Parker. He grabbed a few tweezers, pinchers, a scalpel and a dozen or so pins, along with his bran new second hand leather scissors.

Without his enhanced strength, he wouldn’t have been able to use such simple tools to pull the armored layer of the suit off of the main body, and it remained a hard task anyways: even this relatively simple layer had several microscopic hatches meant to help the nanobots in the suit move around its surface, and he had to make sure not to rip any cables out as he separated the different layers.

The sun was still high in the sky when he finished gathering that first exterior, warming up his skin through the roof windows. He had still a lot of work to do. He couldn’t rest yet.

The second layer was thinner than the first, although both were only a fraction of an inch -or a few millimeters-. This one required him to take out his anti static wrist strap to make sure he wouldn’t damage the most sensitive computer parts. He hooked it up to one of the many metal tools spread out on the tarp around him. This would redirect the electricity in his body away from what he wanted to keep intact.

Although he was only working on a small portion of the suit, it took him more than an hour to finish taking apart this layer and separating everything into the different plastic boxes he had purchased earlier.

The components there were still relatively simple. Several sensors with basic processing power to send information to the "brain” of the suit, some pumps and cables, slithering between the armor plates, sending energy and information to his boots, and dozens more exit routes for the nanobots.

He sorted through each one carefully, sometimes having to use a magnifying glass -how archaic- to make sure he wasn’t breaking anything.

It was more stressful than he had expected. His whole attention had to be locked on the task at hand as even the simplest twitch could severely damage the fragile inside of the suit. Yet another issue with technologically advanced armors: they required either a lot of time or a lot of money to take apart.

Peter stood up, the inner layer of the suit exposed in front of him, the last one before he got to the frame. He felt too anxious to work more on it, yet he couldn’t leave it exposed for too long. The nanopods were there, he could see them faintly, little white bumps against the dark cables and plates. Those were powerful but also terribly fragile.

He groaned, crouching back down. He hated having to work like this, with so little material. Sure, it was more challenging, but everything just took so long!

At this rate, he’d need a whole week to take the suit apart. And that was if he worked on it every day, morning and afternoon, which realistically wouldn’t be the case.

Maybe he could spread it out? He was already thinking of using the Iron Spider to make several suits, splitting its parts in between them. But the arms, the chest, the mask and the legs didn’t have the same kind of elements in it, so the result could be unbalanced…

But, really, maybe it was alright. If he was taking apart the Iron Spider, the resulting suits would be less balanced than it no matter what, as they would have less components. Maybe he should use it as an opportunity to think about more specialized suits, like he had been before.

Most of the hydraulic jump enhancers in the boots had been lost to the fire, but he still had a couple around the thighs and arms. They weren’t meant to make him jump further but, instead, allowed him to leap quicker and with less damage to whatever he was using to propel himself. It had been a life saver for his reputation, back in Queens, although he sometimes got carried away and accidentally chipped a statue or stone wall.

He could use this for his main suit, limiting damage to buildings and vehicles was something he had to do everyday. This meant that thighs and arms were the first things he had to work on, then, to try to salvage as much of the enhancers as he could.

He could also use the plating and sensors to include simple environmental detection. Maybe heat tracking? He wouldn’t be able to include every Iron Spider feature in his next suit, that was for sure, so he would have to select everything very carefully.

As he thought, he moved back to the suit, picking up his work. The last layer was the most complicated and he had to store every parts carefully into little nests of cloth and cotton tucked inside plastic boxes. The sun fell as he finished moving up the thigh and uncovering the frame of the suit. It was only slightly thicker than the other layers, but the materials it was made off was stronger, if less flexible.

His shift was starting soon, however, and he had to carefully cover the exposed layers and store the extracted components in his locker. The Iron Spider couldn’t go back under his mattress in this state, so he had to put it there as well, folding it awkwardly and trying not to damage anything as he did so.

The locker was starting to get a bit full, even with the little knobs he had nailed at the top to hang tools from, and the wire he was running in front of them to hang his clothes off of. He didn’t want to think about having to buy, clean and customize yet another broken down piece of furniture though, so he chose to ignore it for now.

A blast of cold air hit him as he jumped up on the roof, making him shiver under his hoodie. Despite the sun, Gotham remained a coastal town and winter was harsh. It was now late December, only a few days before Christmas and although snow wasn’t falling yet, the wind was enough to make him wish he had invested in a coat.

Too bad his Spider powers didn’t include resisting to the elements, that would have been very useful right about now.

The night settled in as he ran above the roofs, leaping across dark alleyways and crouching occasionally to sneak past suspicious groups cluttered on the rooftops.

Oddly, even though darkness had barely fallen, the streets were already starting to stir, and with greater energy than usual. More thugs crowded the rooftops than usual and he could see armed men patrolling several staircases. Something was happening.

The shift wouldn’t have been noticeable for anyone who didn’t walk those neighborhoods regularly but for Peter, who had spent the past week in a state of extreme alertness, it was obvious. Criminals weren’t usually this bold so early into the evening.

He was even more careful than usual making his way over to the pizzeria. Even there, things looked unusual. He could identify at least five gang members roaming around the street, something he had never witnessed this close to Old Gotham.

Most of them were wearing flowers on their jackets, all were carrying weapons. They didn’t pay him any attention as he made his way past them, hands in his pockets. They laughed together, seemingly in good spirits.

Tonight’s shift was going to be an interesting one. He was going to have to be careful, of course, but it looked like something had shifted in the Gotham underground, he needed to figure out what it was.

And then what? he scolded himself mentally. His suit wasn’t ready yet, there was nothing he could do to intervene, and he didn’t have any contact to relay informa-

Gordon.

His eyes widened. He did have someone to give information to, someone important as well. The commissioner worked with the Batman, he remembered reading about that. If he did hear anything interesting, it might make its way back to an active vigilante.

His mind made up, Peter decided to pay close attention to the underworld that night and the following ones. He wasn’t completely useless, even without a mask.

It made him feel a bit better about himself.

Chapter Text

Marco was already sitting in the dining room of the pizzeria when Peter stepped in. The man’s face was pale, dark circles under his eyes. A gun sat on the table, not pointed towards the door but close enough for the owner to grab it in an instant if he needed to.

This, added to the disquieting trip from his apartment to the restaurant, significantly reduced Peter’s enthusiasm. He kept forgetting how dangerous Gotham could be sometimes, not only to its vigilantes but to its citizens, to the point that most of them had to carry and show off weapons to avoid being robbed.

"Everything alright?" He asked, shuffling uneasily. Marco blinked and looked up sharply, seeming like he hadn’t even noticed him enter, despite the noise he made. Whatever was happening in town was serious enough to disturb him.

"You came, uh?" The older man sighed after staring at him for a long, awkward moment. "Do you even know what’s happening around here?"

Peter grimaced and shook his head. Marco snorted at the admission but there was no humor in his eyes, only a deep worry. His brows were furrowed and his left hand kept tapping the table, inches away from his firearm. The teenager focused and, as he had expected, he could hear the man’s heartbeat, slightly faster than it would usually have been.

"Well kid," his boss said, lighting himself a cigarette as he spoke then sticking it in his mouth and taking a long drag. "We have two dangerous madmen on the run tonight."

"Ah." Peter said, his blood freezing as he started wondering if, maybe, Firefly was one of these two men. He wasn’t ready to face him yet, he wasn’t ready to face anyone in Gotham.

Marco breathed out a large puff of smoke, exhaustion dragging his shoulders down. His heart still sounded anxious, although his breathing was calm and measured.

"Know anything about our city’s freaks?"

Peter cringed a bit at the last word, remembering how he had been called that, just before having a gun pulled on him. Would Marco turn on him if he found out he was a meta? He hoped not, he desperately needed money and shelter to start gaining a semblance of life back and this job was all he had.

"A bit." He said eventually, clenching and unclenching his hands in his pockets. "Mostly by name. It’s hard to remember them all."

"You should." His tone was deadly serious. 

"Y-Yessir."

Marco waved him forward, pointing at the seat across the table he was sitting at. He flicked his cigarette off when Peter walked closer, a simple gesture but one the teen appreciated nonetheless.

"Last night," the adult sighed, rubbing his temples, "there was a breakout at Arkham."

Arkham was a detention center, he remembered, some kind of prison where the police sent enhanced criminals. That was where Croc had been examined in the documents he had read online. Definitely a place with dubious moral standings, if they allowed private informations like what he had read to be posted for anyone to find.

"Good news," Marco sighed, "is that it was only one inmate."

He didn’t look particularly relieved to say that, which made Peter anxious as to who exactly had broken out.

"Bad news," he continued, "is that it was the Joker."

The way he said it made him think he should probably have a stronger reaction to this information than slightly raising an eyebrow but, other than the fact the criminal was at the head of the clown gang, Peter didn’t really know anything about him.

”Uh… How bad is that?"

Marco sighed, looking like he wanted to bash his own head into the table for a second. He regained control of himself almost immediately however, crossing his arms and answering:

"It is very bad. He probably won’t do anything for now, Joker is the kind of man who likes to plan out some kind of big finale, but the simple fact he’s out is going to distract not only the Bats but also the GCPD."

"Is this why there’s so many people outside?" Peter waved at the door.

His boss nodded.

"They’ll still be doing some busts and crackdowns but the amount is going to be seriously reduced. Doesn’t help that Riddler is also back in town."

Peter remembered reading about the Riddler, a man who liked to entrap and control other people for his enjoyment, subjecting them to various tests and puzzles. Not the kind of villain that would have existed back in his universe, and not someone he felt particularly well equipped  to deal with as Spider-Man. The man did not rely on his strength to commit his crimes, he definitely was not a safe target for him.

"So what should I look out for?" He asked after a minute or so of turning the new informations in his head.

This did change things significantly. One of the main gang leaders was back in town, emboldening his followers, and he was the type of rogue to use his time out of jail to plan out some big, destructive event. He wished he knew more about the Joker. As it was, he had no idea of what said event would look like.

He couldn’t even remember if the man was a meta or not, the long list of Gotham villains blurred together in his mind. He needed to spend more time reading about them.

He just didn’t have enough hours in his days to do everything he needed to. That was also something he was discovering about adult life. Before, he had had a fixed schedule : Waking up, getting ready, going to school, going on patrol, doing homework, sleeping. With some hanging out in between and some time with friends and family, it had been his rhythm for years now.

Suddenly, he was supposed to make up his own rhythm, something he was struggling with. He wished he could speak with May or Ben, asked them how they had done it.

Not going to happen now.

As he was lost in his thoughts, Marco had kept talking and he found himself snapping back to reality with a start.

"-off the streets and be careful on the rooftops. I don’t know yet where Joker wants to set up his place, or even if he will, but he’s going to start tightening his grip on the city."

"You don’t think they’ll catch him?" He asked, trying to look like he hadn’t just spaced out in the middle of a conversation.

Marco shrugged.

"I hope they will, but we can’t count on it. Every single time the man has been out, he’s caused some kind of catastrophic accident. It just takes a while to build up to it."

"How long?"

The question left his lips immediately. He would have to make sure his suit was ready for whatever was coming, this would be his deadline. He hoped he had more than a week, because he didn’t think he would be able to fit one in that little time. Even a month would be hard, considering everything he needed to buy and craft for it.

Thankfully, when he replied, Marco was a lot more generous with time than he had expected:

"Couple months, probably. City’s been quiet for a while, and Penguin holds a lot of territory right now. He won’t be able to act right away. But the city’s gonna get worse the longer he’s out."

Two months was plenty of time for Peter to get his suit running, but he didn’t like the way the man was talking. Listening to him, it sounded a lot like the already gritty and violent city would become even more dangerous very soon. It was hard to picture.

Distantly, he wondered why Marco wasn’t trying to convince him to get a gun anymore, especially in those circumstances. Not wanting to get into a talk about it, he chose not to mention it, instead listening to his boss as he continued :

"Main thing you need to be careful about is gas. They keep it in the flowers they wear on their shirts. Dangerous shit. If you see green smoke, hold your breath. Believe me, depending on how strong it is, you could seriously regret breathing it in."

Peter nodded, feeling a chill run down his spine. What kind of gas was this… poison? He had never been poisoned before so he didn’t know if he had a resistance to it, although he assumed his Spider physiology helped with some types of venoms. This probably wouldn’t be one, though.

Chemicals could be a problem. A lot of arachnids were sensitive to a lot of common ones, and he had found out the hard way that he had inherited this weakness, during a prank turned emergency with MJ and Ned.

"What about Riddler?"

Marco shook his head.

"Probably won’t encounter him. He only takes in a few people or targets the Bat, lately. He’s also on the run. GCPD tried to bust him out, heard a few bats were there too."

"They didn’t get him?"

The man ran a hand through his hair, looking weary. "No. Said so this morning. Don’t you have a phone or something?"

When Peter looked down as his only answer, the adult groaned.

"Kid, this isn’t New York. In Gotham you need to keep informed. If you don’t know exactly who’s free and who’s behind bars, it could kill you."

"I- didn’t think about that."

"Of course you didn’t," his boss sighed, "you aren’t from here. It’s alright. You just need to learn before it’s too late."

They stayed silent for a few seconds before Marco straightened up, still tapping the table anxiously with his left hand.

"-nyways, wanted to talk to you about something before you go. And not all of that Joker shit."

The man bent down and picked up something from under his chair. He threw it on top of the table, sliding it towards Peter. It was a small map of Gotham, printed in black and white on a sheet of cheap paper. The boy took it.

"I’m opening for a new delivery person, gonna get interviews in next week. Probably gonna look for someone with a ride, too."

Peter frowned.

"You didn’t give me an interview." He pointed out, confused.

"That’s because I expected you to come running back in after an hour, brat." Marco snorted. “Didn’t think I’d actually be opening again so soon."

"Ah."

"Yep. But doesn’t matter now, you made it." He pointed at the sheet of paper, looking serious. "Chose four neighborhoods, they’ll be yours. I’ll have the new hire cover the others, if they do have a ride."

Peter looked down at the map, now understanding why it had been given to him.

"The Bowery." He said automatically, which made the man grin. They both knew how dangerous the place was, yet it was also one of the closest districts, considering the pizzeria was in between it and Old Gotham, at the very north of the city. For good measure, he added that neighborhood to the list.

Delivering to the GCPD would keep him in touch with Gordon and, indirectly, the city’s vigilantes. Sure it would be as Peter the delivery boy and not as Spider-Man, but he needed to take any win he could.

"Is Park Row its own area?" He asked, hoping to avoid it in the future, despite Harley living there.

Marco shook his head.

"Sorry kid, it’s officially part of the Bowery."

He eventually added East End and the Docks to his small list, the first being closest to the Bowery and the second for the nostalgia of seeing waves crash against the city’s shore. He missed New York.

Marco didn’t argue with him about his choices, simply nodding and taking the map back from him. He was told once again to be careful before the adult limped away to the back room to bring him his GPS, bag and pizza boxes.

"Sixteen deliveries tonight, brat. Be careful out there, they haven’t started to shoot on sight, but it might start soon."

This last sentence did not help calm his nerves at all. How much worse could the city get? And, more importantly, was he going to be able to wait for his suit to be done before doing something? If it got too bad, there would be a point where he had to intervene no matter what.

If someone was shot in front of him, if he was jumped again… how was he going to hide his abilities, without his suit to hide his identity? Peter Parker would be busted as a meta and, in Gotham, it didn’t seem to be a good thing…

He stepped out into the night to an even more crowded street. Packs of men and women had started to form, most of them wearing flowers. He tried his best to smell anything out of the ordinary but, outside of blood, urine, powder and drugs, there was no new scent there. Either the gas hadn’t been distributed yet or it didn’t have a smell.

He was mostly ignored as he made his way up a fire escape. Gotham felt like it was rumbling, an old motor waking up, whispers rising all around him in the streets and behind walls. He didn’t hear any police sirens, they were probably busy investigating the break-out while it was fresh.

Just how dangerous was the Joker? It was hard to guess with so little information at hand. He hadn’t looked into the man, focusing instead on the rogues he felt like he could handle in a fight. This might have been a mistake.

The roof in front of the pizzeria was blessedly empty of any criminal activities, which allowed him to type the first address into the GPS. Bowery, not too far away from where he was right now.

Down in the streets, Peter could see various groups moving and talking. The flower wearing thugs had been obviously emboldened by their leader freeing himself. They were walking around with their chest puffed out, mocking some of the other loiterers. Other gangs were still present though, specifically the ones wearing black leather.

It seemed like the criminals he had learned to associate with the Penguin’s crew, dressed with more expensive clothes than any of the other mobsters, had retreated to the Docks since he couldn’t see any of them around. Tensions in between groups, then? Or perhaps their leader wanted to keep them close, to build up his own strength.

Sticking to the roofs, he slowly made his way to his first drop off spot, a residential building that looked a few weeks away from completely crumbling. Typical, for the area.

Climbing down was not an easy decision to make, considering the tense atmosphere down in the streets, but he had to. He handed off the pizza to a worried looking woman, holding a baby in her right arm and a knife in her left hand.

"Take care of yourself, kid." She told him, stuffing a handful of crumpled bills in his hands. "Thank you for coming." She looked about to cry, her lips were shaking. He could smell fear on her. He could smell fear everywhere around him.

He felt out of the loop but still, he smiled at her as gently as he could before hurrying back up the roofs. Staying down on the pavement made him feel anxious, vulnerable. But, even as he reached the top of the damaged building, he could hear movement around, people shooting up drugs, guns clicking, boots grinding against stone.

He started moving again.

Staying still was dangerous, during this kind of nights. At least, that was what his instinct told him. As such, he immediately leaped away from the roof and into another one, sliding down then jumping up again, pushing himself higher and higher up. He needed to be fast, impossible to catch.

The next delivery was described as "roof only", which was always nice. He tried to enjoy the run leading there, picking up a bit more speed than he usually did with pizza on his back. The idea that something big was coming, that the police and the heroes were distracted, that two dangerous men were out and active on the streets, was more nerve wracking than he thought it would be.

He had messed up his last outing as Spider-Man, what if he didn’t get better during those two months? What if he failed to protect civilians again?

The questions haunted him all the way up the abandoned residential tower he was supposed to deliver to. Not one to judge after having to spend some time without housing himself, he didn’t stop his climb, making sure to look like he was scaling the building in a boring, totally not supernatural way.

It was slower than it usually would be but he made it to the top without jostling the food too much. There, sitting on top of a dilapidated staircase, feet dangling off of its edge, two men were looking down at him.

One of them was Nightwing, wearing his trademark black and blue outfit. This high up above the Bowery’s squat buildings, the moon allowed Peter to see him a bit better than he had before. His hair was dark, slightly curly, and he had a strong, muscular build. He smiled when he saw him, looking absolutely delighted.

"You came!"

The other man next to him was also quite obviously a vigilante. Unlike his partner, though, he wasn’t wearing a domino mask but instead what looked to be a bloody red helmet and a lot of firearms. It was a bit odd to see the two of them sitting together, as their heroic aesthetics were very much clashing.

"Uh… yeah…" Peter answered awkwardly, sliding his bag off of his shoulder.

"Did you make the kid climb all the way up there?" Red Helmet Guy asked Nightwing, sounding slightly incredulous. His voice was muffled by his headwear, which made Peter wonder how he could breathe properly with it on. His body armor was different than the other hero’s, too, with thicker plating and what looked like a lot more metal, over the other’s more flexible mixed materials suit.

"It’s okay," Nightwing replied, now ignoring the pizza entirely to talk to his companion. "He’s from Marco’s"

"Shit, they reopened?"

The blue hero nodded enthusiastically before jumping down the staircase and landing in a crouch in front of Peter. He was a lot taller than him and smelled like powder, Kevlar and blood. He had been in a fight already that night, despite it only starting.

Red Helmet followed him, landing as smoothly as he had. Both of them moved with a grace Peter had rarely seen in non-meta humans. It reminded him of the Black Widow, back home. He knew that, if he acted naturally, he would probably look the same. However, he tried his best to make himself as unassuming as he could.

Too bad this city wouldn’t let him act innocent and powerless.

"You might want to rethink the job." Red Helmet told him as Nightwing swapped the pizza with a (very) large tip. "Gonna get messy soon."

"I actually agree with him for once." The other hero piped in, opening the box and grabbing a slice for himself. "Not a good time to work nights."

Peter shrugged. Being scolded by vigilantes about having a dangerous job was a bit hypocritical but he decided not to point it out. As far as the men knew, he was simply a parkour loving pizza boy with a knack for survival. And they were right, in a way, he had no idea what he was getting into. His lack of knowledge about the Joker, which everyone seemed to fear terribly, was evidence enough.

"No choice." He said eventually. "Not a lot of people hiring here."

Nightwing nodded in agreement. Red Helmet had already turned away, munching on his own pizza slice.

There were so many questions Peter could ask them. They were directly connected to Batman. Nightwing was, at least. And the Bat was a member of the largest hero organization of the planet. They probably had all of the answers he needed, but-

He didn’t exist, legally. Not only that but he had been in contact with several criminals without denouncing them and was, on top of that, definitely living in a criminal hideout. He also did not know their secret identities or have any indication that they would believe him or treat him as an innocent civilian. For all he knew, they might throw him in Arkham. Contacting them as Peter Parker would be a bad idea, he needed to wait until Spider-Man was active again, to talk to them from equal to equal.

"Well… good luck, guys." He told them, backing away towards the edge. "Hope you enjoy the pizza."

Nightwing beamed at him again, waving him goodbye. Out of everyone he had met in Gotham, he was by far the most cheerful.

As he made a show of hoisting himself down and grabbing a windows ledge to head to the ground, Peter wondered what the man was doing there. Maybe he wanted to help out with the crisis happening in the city? That would definitely make sense, considering his strong ties to Gotham herself.

If other vigilantes were visiting the city, the situation must be quite dire indeed. He needed to finish his suit quickly.

His next few deliveries were to a various assortment of criminals and civilians, with nothing out of the ordinary about any of them, other than the tense atmosphere and abundance of weapons. Thankfully, the word had gotten around that there was now a pizza delivery guy roaming the streets at night so he didn’t get any weapon pulled on him.

He was almost done with his shift when he was direct, once again, towards Crime Alley. This time, however, the drop point was to a small park north of it. Knowing what kind of people populated parks at night, especially in this area, Peter readied himself for a difficult few minutes.

Thankfully, as he passed the rusty, dangling park gates, he could see that it was mostly empty. The poorly cut grass did have some people sitting on it, but they looked too high-or drunk- to attack him.

No benches in this park, no trash cans either. Only a lot of rubbles, burned down remains of unrecognizable furniture and dying trees.

Peter walked on the main path until he reached the end of the small garden, marked by a tall, busted open iron gate. He frowned. Nobody seemed to be waiting on a delivery.

Then, he started noticing something.

Or rather, hearing something.

"Pssst… Pizza boy… Hey… Pizza boy…"

He whirled around, trying to find the source of the whispers. They were coming from behind a large, headless stone statue, to the very left of the park, shaded by a couple sick, blackened oaks. He could hear someone breathing behind, giggles occasionally breaking through.

When he realized who had ordered the pizza, he almost wanted to walk away, leave it right there and ignore his duty. Unfortunately for him, he needed intel and money so, against his own better judgement, he started to make his way towards Harley’s hiding place.

The woman was sitting cross legged against the back of the statue, a large black sports bag and a pink suitcase on the ground next to her. She smiled at him but, under the cheerful expression, Peter could read something very dark. She looked exhausted and pale, under the little amount of moonlight that made it past the oaks. She, too, smelled like blood but with an added mix of alcohol and tobacco.

"Heeeeeyyy… pizza kid…" She greeted him. "Come here…"

He did, keeping a distance of a few feet in between them, in case he needed to back off quickly. She had never been violent towards him but he could tell something was clearly wrong.

"Are you okay?" He asked her, worried despite himself. She might be unstable and intimidating but she was still a human and he could clearly see that she was upset.

She didn’t reply for a long time after he asked that and, when she did, it didn’t have anything to do with his question. Her voice did shake slightly, he noticed.

"Am gonna have to move away for a bit… wanted to talk to you before."

Peter had a very bad feeling about where this was going.

"You want to talk to me?"

"Well, I also wanted a pizza," she admitted. "But I need money."

That was awkward.

"I don’t have money." He told her, not adding that, even if he did, he would probably not give it to an almost stranger. He needed funds too badly for that. Charity would come later, when he had more income.

"I know." Harley nodded.

That was a surprising statement but, before he could ask more questions, she elaborated, sounding slightly smug :

"You don’t wear a coat in December, always have the same shoes on, and your soap is the cheapest kind at the store."

Peter took a few steps back in shock. Harley had struck him as an influential but unstable person. Sure, he had suspected she was more intelligent than she let on but he hadn’t expected her to be this perceptive.

"You need money." She was still speaking. "I need money. We can help each other out."

He was definitely not interested in what she had to offer, considering the kind of people she was hanging out around and what he had seen at her apartment. He shook his head, although he doubted she could see, or feel, it.

"I have a job," he told her, trying to sound confident.

"One that doesn’t pay enough for a new coat." She pointed out. She sounded more lucid than she ever had in front of him. If there wasn’t a slight edge of hysteria to her tone, he would have assumed she was a smart but inoffensive woman.

He knew better, though. He could smell guns in her bags, in her clothes, too.

"I want to stay legal," he said eventually. “That’s why I work here."

"Poor little boy." Harley cackled. " You really don’t know where you are, do you? Gotham doesn’t care about legality."

"I do." He protested, taking her pizza out, intending to shove it in her hands and walk away.

She didn’t grab it though and, as he had had to step closer to hand it to her, he could now see her eyes, digging into his. She looked like a completely different person that night, serious like he had never seen her.

"You are a meta."

She said it matter-of-factly, confidence dripping from her voice. There was no fear here, or disgust, only interest.

"I…" she continued, "… have contacts."

He didn’t know what to do, holding the pizza box in front of him like an idiot, feeling very much out of his depth. What was Peter Parker doing there, talking to a woman who was most definitely a criminal, in the dead of night?

"The kind of metas like you… can make a lot of money. We both need that. You know how to fight, I’ve seen you."

There was now an urgency in her tone, something she had managed to keep hidden earlier. Peter hesitated. He wanted to leave but, also, he couldn’t help but be curious.

"I’m not joining a gang," he warned her.

"Good. Am not either. That’s the whole point."

He still didn’t understand what she wanted of him, especially now that gang activities were out of the questions. He asked her and she laughed, the second time that night. Hysteria was bubbling under her breath, he could hear it.

"Metas are very prized in fighting rings." She told him in a fake whisper, her eccentric behavior slowly resurfacing. "Meta against meta, several normal guys against a meta… it’s all a good show. Good money."

Peter couldn’t help but be astounded at that. He shook his head slowly.

"You want me to fight in some kind of… underground meta ring?"

"Yes." She sounded delighted.

"Me?"

"Yes."

His first instinct was to say no, however something stopped him. As far as illegal activities went, that was probably one of the least morally ambiguous ones he could find in Gotham. With non-metas, he could pull his punches, with metas, he could go all in.

That, however, made him pause.

"Wait… metas are valued?"

She nodded so energetically it was noticeable even in the dim light. Clouds were now covering the moon, bathing everything around them in shadows.

"Yep." She said. "Lots of metas in Gotham nowadays. Most of them can only bend spoons."

"A guy pulled a gun on me because I’m a meta." Peter protested, realizing too late he had admitted what they both already knew. Harley didn’t remark on it, though, instead cackling :

"Inner city folks get touchy. Get scared. But people here… stuff like this happens more often. Lots of metas in the underworld. Weirder ones than you, for sure."

"Can I wear a mask?" He asked, crossing his arms.

Harley tutted.

"No, no, no." She sung. "Too easy to sneak bugs in. Are you worried about people recognizing you?"

He blushed, blessedly hidden by the night. Harley’s cackles turned into a high-pitched burst of laughter and his cheeks started burning harder.

"Why do you care?" She asked him. "You think the people there don’t have shit to hide?"

That made him pause, adding a second, sudden advantage to the offer than money. He started pacing a bit, wishing he didn’t have to hold the pizza this awkwardly. Harley hadn’t yet made a move to grab it, though.

"What kind of person goes to those?" He asked finally.

He could feel her satisfaction as she somehow sensed that he was allowing himself to be convinced. With a sweet, syrupy fake voice, she replied :

"To the regular ones? Nobody of importance." She stopped talking for a few seconds for dramatic effect, then continued : "For the metas? Well… those are considered the highest form of entertainment here."

"Penguin?" Peter fired, not thinking about the kind of information he was giving the woman.

"He loves them." Harley cooed, clapping her hands. "Who wouldn’t?"

"I assume it’s a no pictures zone, then."

She laughed again, hysteria now breaking through her façade, creeping into her demeanor. Something like terror lingered in her scent. He could only smell it because of how close he was to her, but it was overpowering. Why was she so afraid? More importantly, what was she afraid of? It most definitely wasn’t of him.

"Of course not, silly! No contact zone, black-out, no camera, no electronics. No traces. Not with the kind of people watching."

Penguin never allowed himself to be caught on tape participating in any kind of illegal activities. That he would be a regular spectator, on its own, was a good indicator of how secretive it was. The man had never stayed in prison more than a few months, as his lawyers always managed to sway judges and juries in his favor.

"Do I have to use my real name?"

That earned him another pitying cackle. She was right to laugh, it was a stupid question. Peter Parker didn’t exist in this world. The only thing he was protecting by hiding his identity from those people was his future. He was still relieved when she told him nobody cared about the name he used as long as he obeyed the rules.

Because, even if it was hard to think about, he did want a future in this world. He wanted to find a way to go to college, get a job he liked, maybe one day reunite with MJ or, if he couldn’t…

He didn’t want to think about that.

Denial, a part of him accused. He ignored it.

What would May think of him? He wondered as he opened his mouth to ask his next question. What would MJ, his MJ, the one who remembered him, so if she saw him like this, getting involved in all sorts of criminal activities with strange adults at night?

"You don’t get busted?"

He felt a sour taste fill his mouth as he realized that he was considering participating in activities that were most definitely not legal. To the point where he had to worry about being arrested when partaking in it.

"Ah… they did. Used to. Not anymore. The key is timing."

He understood what she meant immediately, remembering the talk he had had with Marco earlier. "It’s only open when they’re distracted." He whispered. "The GCPD, I mean."

"And the Bats." Harley added. "Yes it’s not that common, it tends to make a lot of noise… they can hear the whispers if there’s nothing distracting them."

"But there is. Because of the break-out."

It all made sense. It was a bad time for the average Gotham citizens, with the bombs, the Joker and the Riddler but, for the underworld, it was perfect to throw these kind of… twisted festivals. That was what it sounded like, from what Harley was saying, some kind of highly anticipated event.

When the bats were away, the rogues came out to play, he thought, feeling oddly disconnected from what was happening around him. Everything was happening to fast, he was getting talked into something he wasn’t sure he was fully alright with.

It was so tempting, though. All of this, information and money, was exactly what he needed to start up his vigilantism in Gotham. There was no way Harley would knew aware of it, though. How would she know how important it was to him?

"I’ll help you get in." She told him. "In exchange, I want half of what you win. I’ll let you know where to drop the money and I’ll have someone take you down there."

She sounded so confident that he would accept her offer, despite the astronomically high percentage, that he was struck silent for a moment.

Then, maybe she was right to value herself that much. Without her telling him, he would probably never have heard of those fighting rings, even less have had a shot at entering one of them. He had been right about her having influence in the underworld. One of the only things he hadn’t been wrong about, in Gotham.

Money, of course, was a big draw. The rewards had to be high, if Harley, who barely knew him, thought it was worth a try. Then, she really didn’t seem particularly mentally healthy, and her judgment may very well be impaired. He has no guarantee that this wasn’t just some delusion or, even worse, a scam.

If it was the real deal and he went there, he would have to fight with his face uncovered, in front of people who might have seen him deliver pizza before. He could use a fake name but still, he had never used his powers in front of strangers without hiding his identity. It felt wrong to do it, like he was putting everyone he loved in danger, but-

Well, he didn’t really have many people left, now, did he?

He couldn’t even think of any one who would be at risk. The house he lived in was already filled with criminals, and his boss carried a gun wherever he went. He didn’t have friends in this world, and everyone in his family was dead.

That was one instance where being completely alone was an advantage, he thought bitterly. There wasn’t any reason for him not to accept this offer. He could even use it to relay information to Gordon, pretending he had found out about it through other means.

Plus, the money could help him speed up his suit making process. The pizza job wasn’t enough to fund his projects as fast as he needed to.

Really, the only thing holding him back was his sense of right and wrong, the idea that this was too close to toeing the line between good and evil. It didn’t hurt anyone, though. He truly did not have anything left to protect anyways, not even his identity. He didn’t exist here.

His mouth was dry when he asked, feeling numb :

"How much?"

"A few thousands for the group ones." Harley answered, grin audible in her voice. "More when it’s two metas."

That-

That was an incredible amount of money.

"Cash?" He asked, his voice sounding strangled even to him.

"Of course!"

A few thousands.

If he won, he would have enough not only to make enough web fluids to last him for months but also to get materials for several suits, a new wardrobe, and perhaps even find someone to get him papers.

This would change everything.

"That’s a lot." He eventually said, still reeling a bit at the amount.

"Told ya. People like watching metas fight. It’s fun."

Peter ignored her, not wanting to argue when he was about to become one of those metas fighting for some criminal’s entertainment. Instead, he put the pizza down on the back of the statue, next to its foot, on the stone pedestal.

"When does it start?" He asked Harley, feeling his throat tighten with anxiety as he stepped further down a path he wasn’t sure he was fully comfortable following.

"Ah… I’ll have my girlfriend sign you up." The woman told him, putting the pizza box on her lap and opening it up to dig into her meal. "You have a phone?"

"No."

"Me either."

They stared at each other in the dark for a few seconds before Harley straightened up, an olive falling from her slice as she moved. Peter could smell it crash on the ground and roll away towards the oak.

"I’ll just order pizza." She told him cheerfully.

He was about to nod, then he stopped and explained:

"Uh… I’m only gonna be delivering to the Bowery, Old Gotham, East End and the Docks. We’re getting a new driver."

"That’s alright," Harley reassured him, "We can keep meeting like this, it’s fun."

Peter did not agree. This way of meeting was more nerve wracking than anything, honestly. 

"I’m gonna go now." He informed the woman, not wanting to stay any longer and get talked into participating into yet another illegal morally dubious activity.

The worst part of all this was that he wouldn’t be able to avoid the woman, since he had to deliver her food as part of his job. There was no backing out of this, he was stepping into a world that was completely foreign to him.

As he finished his shift, he couldn’t shake the thought that, as good as the deal had seemed back then, he had just made a terrible mistake.

There was something itching at the back of his neck, as he thought about it. It was distant, barely noticeable and, when he brought his hand up to scratch himself, he couldn’t feel any bump or injury.

Oh boy.

This was not a good sign.

Chapter Text

Snow started to fall on the day before Christmas Eve, just as Peter left his building. It had taken a while to come this year, but it always did eventually. The wind, already cold before, was now leaving behind a white frozen fog after every gust.

He was happy to have found a place before the blizzard came. It was hard enough to get out with only a hoodie and a scarf to protect him, he couldn’t imagine having to sleep out there.

His heart went out to everyone who wasn’t lucky enough to have meta abilities to fall back on during hard times. Even when he first came to this universe, with no one and nothing he knew in it, he had been able to have some level of comfort and safety. He had no idea how bad it could truly get for others who were as unprepared as he had been when they ended up on the streets.

And the streets themselves were going to become more and more dangerous. He felt powerless to help in this situation and it frustrated him endlessly. Those issues were beyond what a vigilante could accomplish on their own.

Time as Spider-Man, talking to and meeting New-Yorkers from all walks of life, had taught him that every homeless person had a different story and different needs. Most of them did not have anyone left and those who did tended to have a complicated relationship with whoever they still had. Helping them was a delicate tasks for someone as uneducated as he was about the very adult issues many of them were going through.

Mental illness was common among the homeless, going from depression to schizophrenia. He remembered spending long nights reading studies and testimonies, trying to understand. It was hard for him, back then. He had only been sixteen.

Today, it was still hard. Mental health was not something he was very educated about, they just didn’t really talk about it at school, outside of the one time a doctor had come to talk to the whole class. May and him had had a lot of long talks about death and self worth, after Uncle Ben died, but she wasn’t that much more informed than he was. Like him, most of her knowledge came from personal experience.

Often, he wished he knew more about the subject, but he never really had the time to learn in depth about it. There was always something else to do, some cataclysm to stop.

Blasts of icy wind made their way through the thin fabric of his hoodie and started seeping into his skin, dragging him away from his thoughts.
He wished he had enough money to get himself a coat but he had spent almost all of last night’s salary on rent for the next two weeks. The few bills he had left were barely enough for some food and water. He hadn’t originally intended to buy the later but reading up on Gotham’s villain had revealed a disturbingly large amount of cases of poisoning the city’s water supplies. He still didn’t know how vulnerable he was to those types of poisons and he wanted to be careful.

Scarecrow, apparently, was known to try and sneak his "fear toxin" into the underground water system. The Joker had also been known to do it, a couple of times. Those might not work as intended on him, a lot of medications did not after all, but he had no way of being sure of it.

If he had the means, Peter would try and test the water from his faucet but, as it was, he simply didn’t have the budget for it. He would just have to trust his gut and, if the water started to taste weird, fall back on the bottles he intended to buy.

It wasn’t the safest option, nor the smartest, but he didn’t have a choice.

As he headed towards the closest convenience store, he found himself thinking about Harley and what he had gotten involved himself into a few nights earlier. The itch he had felt then had disappeared almost as fast as it had come, leaving him uneasy and confused. It hadn’t been as strong as his Spider Sense but, still, it had seemed familiar.

Now it was completely gone again, and he had no way of knowing if it had been a fluke or not. What he had agreed to, however, seemed to be more and more of a mistake as time went on.

It was too late, now. Harley didn’t strike him as the kind of woman who would take well to him backing off and he wouldn’t have any idea of which order would be hers, since Marco’s didn’t take names.

In other words, he was doomed to go through with her plan. Hopefully, the underground ring was as private as she had assured him. He didn’t want his future to be ruined.

Still regretting his impulsivity, Peter pushed the door of the convenience store, barely blinking when the shopkeeper pulled a gun on him before setting it back down quickly. Everyone outside was tense, it only made sense that people working inside would be too.

He spent his meager 15$ on a box of eggs, a few pounds of rice and two gallons of water. Food prices had gone up slightly in the span of a few days and he could see that a lot of products were missing off the shelves.

Should he start stockpiling food as well? He didn’t know enough about Gotham to figure out if it was typical doomsday panic buying or a smart survival move. New York had never needed him to stock up on food like this. The only major event he could think of where it could have been useful was the Invasion… but that had been sudden.

He remembered the few months of chaos after it, the military rations and the uncertainty. The awe, too. The Avengers was the name on everyone’s lips. The very first super hero team!

Things had soured, later on. Public opinion had shifted. Peter still remembered those days with an odd mix of fondness and sadness.

Then, Ben and the bite. Everything had changed so suddenly once again and, starting from then, his life had never truly stopped being chaotic. From his fourteenth birthday to his seventeenth, it had all been a constant flow of action and danger and duty.

And loss.

He shook his head, paying for his purchases and heading back out into the freezing streets. Dark thoughts were something he had to avoid. He would not let himself crumble.

By the time he was in front of his building, snow had started to pile up on the sidewalk, covering everything with a thin white layer. It muffled a bit of the edge of Gotham, making trash and bloodstains disappear under its cold blanket.

He wasn’t a fool, though. He remembered winters spent without heating. Snow might be beautiful, but it was a killer. The humidity it brought when it melted made the wind bite much harder. 

Once again, he felt bad for the ones in Gotham who couldn’t get shelter. People would die from the cold, he knew it. As Spider-Man, he used to walk around at the beginning and end of each winter patrol to spot people who had fallen asleep without protection from the elements.

Sometimes, he made them emergency tents out of web fluid and whatever else they could find. Most of the time, he would have to carry them to an emergency room or a clinic that partnered with charities. They would make sure they wouldn’t let them die.

Of course, they often ended back up on the street right after. It always made him feel powerless.

He didn’t have webs to move as fast as he did back then but he promised himself to keep an eye out during his shift. Maybe he could use some of his salary to get emergency heat blankets and some hand warmers that he could bring out with him.

He was so focused on thinking about this project that he almost bumped into his landlady. Thankfully, she stepped away right in time, giving him enough time to regain his balance and notice what was going on around him.

They were in front of his apartment, he had climbed the stairs robotically, lost in his own mind and she…

… was coming from the apartment in front of his?

"You should pay more attention to your surroundings." The older woman scolded him, dusting the sleeves of her dress. She was wearing a tight bun, that day, and he could smell a gun hidden under her clothes.

"Sorry…" He apologized, feeling embarrassed. "Uh… is something happening?"

She sniffed, looking equally annoyed and sour. He shuffled uneasily up the last step to leave her space if she wanted to head down. She chose to answer him, though.

"Yes. You are most likely going to get a neighbor very soon. I have known your boss for a long time, he can be quite predictable.” She said it in a long suffering way, shaking her head slightly.

Uh. She was right, though. The kind of people who would accept a job as dangerous as delivering pizza at night in Gotham’s most violent neighborhoods were often either desperate or foolish. Peter himself was a bit of both. There was a high likelihood most people who would answer the job offer would have less than ideal housing situations.

Probably not as bad as his back then, considering they would at least have to have a ride. Sleeping in a car did sound a lot more comfortable than sleeping under a broken roof.

He knew MJ and her family had had to sleep in her parents’ car, back when she was a child and the New York Reconstruction project was still ongoing. She had told him a bit about it, but never any details. Like most people, she had lost someone in the incident and those times were always harder to talk about. He understood.

His landlady had turned her back on him as he reminisced. Suddenly, as she was walking down the first step, he remembered in a flash that he has meant to ask her a question. Before he could second guess himself, he blurted out:

"Wait please! I uh… I have a question, ma’am."

She stopped mid-step then, slowly, turned to look at him. She looked mildly surprised that he would call her back so unceremoniously.

Peter cleared his throat.

"Hum… hypothetically… if … would you … uh …"

It was so hard to get the words out. He could see the woman’s eyes start to darken with impatience and he tried his best to ask his question without having his heart burst out of his chest.

"Hypothetically if I needed to… hm… buy some… identification … paper… would you know where to… uh… how much… well…”

His sentence devolved into a string of mumbling as his cheeks grew warm. He couldn’t believe he was asking this to his landlady!

Unfortunately, she was the only person he suspected had some form of knowledge into the administrative side of the underworld, due to the kind of business she ran. Marco might too, but he didn’t really want to get him involved.

"Straighten up, boy." Miss Xiuying snapped, her patience running out. "You cannot act indecisive when asking this type of questions."

"Sorry." He muttered, shuffling on his spot. "But do you?"

She narrowed her eyes at him.

"I do not partake in free counseling work. If you want to ask me for information, you will have to pay for my time."

That was awkward. He had spent the rest of his money on food for the week. There was nothing left in his savings, which was a huge oversight. He should have planned for something like this. What if there was an emergency?

He needed to start keeping a stash of cash for emergency. He was an idiot not to have though of it in the first place, especially since he had known for a while that his aunt and uncle both took great pain to save what little money they had left at the end of the month… If they did have any.

"I… uh… don’t have money right now. I gave it to you for rent."

She smirked, cold amusement in her eyes.

"Rent is rent, child. Information is something else entirely, especially in Gotham."

She sighed, shaking her head slowly.

"You might think me greedy, but I see it as a service to you. Nothing is free, here. It’s a lesson you need to learn." She started making her way down the stairs then stopped and turned back one last time. "Bring me two hundred. I will answer any question you have about this type of business when you do. Take all the time you need."

Peter watched her disappear down the stairs, feeling a mix of disappointment and relief. He hadn’t been wrong, she did have inside information, she was able to help him. Only thing was she wouldn’t do it for free.

After all why would she? She didn’t know him personally. Their relationship was purely transactional.

Two hundred, though. That was a significant amount of money for him. Of course, if Harley’s business idea did turn out in his favor, he would be able to easily pay for it and perhaps even some of what came after. If it didn’t, it would take him forever to scrap enough funds. He had to think about more important things than papers right now, and that was his priority, budget-wise.

Marco had said it would take an average of two months for the Joker to let loose whatever he was planning on Gotham. That placed the event around late February to early March. The very end of winter on this side of the United States.

He locked his door behind him, storing his food into the now empty ramen cardboard box. He would have to think about a more airtight container for the rice, to avoid attracting insects or mice, but more expenses was the last thing he wanted to think about.

Absently, he turned his radio on, carefully taking the remains of the Iron Spider out of his locker. He should probably be doing more research right now, but there were so many things he had to think about that he was finding it hard to focus on one of them. Automatically, he defaulted to what he had been doing the day before.

As he carefully dislodged part of the metal frame, he started listening to the radio. He had tuned in to a Gotham News station, which was cheerfully going through advertisements as he readied his workspace.

"Weeeeeelcome back Gotham! Vicki back on the mic for today’s daily dose of ‘What the flying fuck is going on in this godforsaken town?!', every family’s favorite program."

Peter frowned at that. Radio broadcast in this city was very unlike anything he had experienced before. People just started not to care that much about political correctness, when their safety kept being endangered, it seemed.

"News on the Firefly investigation : our beloved and bemustached GCPD Commissioner, Jim Gordon, has handed over the reigns of the case to Captain Harvey Bullock and his team. Although he hasn’t made it official, many-our station included- believe he is intending to take the lead on the most recent Arkham break-out.

By the way! In case you haven’t gotten to pick up the phone to answer the calls of your distressed relatives, yet, I would like to let you know that Joker is -once again- free and out in Gotham!"

Peter had to cut away some part of the frame to be able to detach it from the rest of the body, something that was surprisingly hard to do. Titanium was only a fraction of the alliage but even the trace amount present there made the thing as solid as diamond.

"Now a little reminder as to basic safety rules during Joker break-outs. First of all, follow GCPD updates religiously, we still don’t know where the man is located, which isn’t good for anyone!"

He now started working on the outer layers of the thigh, further away from the skin. The armor was much more resistant there, stronger metals pieces enter-twinned so precisely they looked like fabric from far away. He could probably use some of this material to protect his vital spots, splitting it in between various suits.

He was itching to start working on his new suit. Especially as the broadcaster kept listing all of the dangers associated with the Joker, which was painting a darker picture by the minute.

"Most importantly, do not let any child or vulnerable person alone, either outside or inside, whether it be at night or during the day. Keep in touch with your loved ones and remember, only go out after dusk if it’s an absolute emergency.

I cannot recommend the use of firearm without a proper license but if you live in North or East Gotham, remember you can get an air gun without one, and as long as you are of age, you can also buy a taser or a pepper spray."

Carefully, Peter pried out a dozen nanopods, cursing when one of them fell out of the tweezers and crashed on the floor. He didn’t even have to check it to know it was broken. Without energy to keep them active, the microscopic robots were dreadfully simple to damage.

The Joker sounded more dangerous than he had expected. The kind of man to prey on the weak, from what he could understand. It was a far cry from the villains he was used to fighting but in line with what he had experienced in Gotham.

"Lighter news now! This year’s cast of ‘Gotham’s Greatest Game’, our yearly celebrity torture fest has dropped. You’ll never guess who finally accepted to join in- No I’m not talking about Gordon, that one will take a few more years- … The one and only Bruce Wayne! So if you have ever wanted to see a billionaire humiliated live on television, tune in to the show, I for sure will!

Honestly, who in Gotham hasn’t dreamed of seeing good ol’ Brucie on that stage? I for sure will be watching-and laughing."

Wayne, that name again. The man seemed deeply involved in the mythos of the city, like Tony Stark had been back in New York. Unlike Tony, though, "good ol’ Brucie" was not a hero, nor one of the founding members of a superhero organization. His importance to the city must come from somewhere else, then.

He did remember that his company, Wayne Industries, had been involved in funding a lot of the projects he had come across. A philanthropist, that was the proper word to describe this type of behavior. Peter really hoped he wouldn’t see the man spectating at the underground fighting ring. He had been lucky once, when it came to billionaires, there was a high likelihood that the next one he met wouldn’t be this well intentioned.

He spent the rest of the day listening to relatively inane news, sometimes interrupted by a string of useful information. The Riddler still hadn’t been caught, the host said, but the GCPD was considering him one of its two highest priorities.

She didn’t have to explain what was the other.

That night, as he stepped onto the roofs, the snow was thick enough to go up to his ankle and the downpour had no sign of slowing down. He shivered violently, eager to start running so he could warm up.

He had to be even more careful than usual as well, since ice had started to set in under the few inches of snow. His suit’s boots had been useful, sheltering him from the cold and allowing him to keep sticking to surfaces. The cheap sneakers he was wearing did not afford him such luxury, however, which made the risk of slipping and falling much more real.

Several times, he had to slam his hands on various walls and floors to keep from losing his balance. Not having access to his usual outfit was slowing him down during this kind of weather.

This, however, wasn’t helping his fingers, which were starting to turn worryingly red. He could barely feel them anymore, the bitter cold digging into them like needles. He needed to get himself proper gloves… but if he did, how would he right himself if he fell?

Awkwardly, he tried to slide down a sloped roof, snow flowing around him as he moved. As long as he was paying attention to what was happening, he could use his unnatural sense of balance to keep straight.

He almost crashed into the building at the end of the roof, a taller residential tower, but managed to stick his hands to it and turn his momentum upwards, flinging himself up, twisting, then resting his feet and palms on the stone.

He scrambled up the icy building, the exercise not strenuous enough to warm up his body. He needed better gear, winter was only starting and it would most likely get worse.

He didn’t see anyone out in the snow other than the usual criminal crowd as he got closer to the pizzeria. He didn’t know if that was a good or bad sign, Gotham and it’s people were  still mostly enigmas to him.

Marco looked just as tired as he had the previous day when he sent him out. He spent the whole of their interaction shuffling through a stack of paperwork-job applications maybe?- and barely looking up at him. His phone kept buzzing. 

The warmth of the pizza bag made him feel more alive, at least. Despite it, he couldn’t help but be anxious before every single one of his deliveries, fearing that it would bring him back to Harley and her ridiculous schemes. It took him longer than it usually would to get to each spot, snow having turned to ice on some buildings.

Relief filled his body as he reached the last delivery spot, a few minutes past midnight, and he didn’t spot the woman. He had been anxious at first, since this last pizza took him to one of the least habitable parts of East End, brimming with criminal activity, brothels and armed thugs.

It really wasn’t any better than the Bowery, especially now that the police was distracted from every day crime. The blizzard, as cold as it was, helped him this time around, allowing him to sneak past trouble easily.

He found the client inside of what appeared to have once been an European themed bar, most likely Irish. She was sitting on the counter, legs crossed, busy typing something on what looked like a heavily customized smartphone. Its case was covered by little flowers and vines, it had likely been made by an artisan.

The bar itself had long been abandoned, Peter noticed. Plants and moss had started taking over the main room, somehow thriving despite the raging blizzard outside.

His neck started itching. The feeling lasted barely a second before it faded into nothingness, leaving him confused, standing in the middle of the odd bar, his almost empty pizza bag sagging against his back.

"Oh." The woman noticed, looking briefly up at him. "It’s you."

Her eyes were bright green, cutting through the air to stare into him with an intensity he hadn’t expected. She slowly slid down to the ground, red hair cascading behind her, smooth and luscious. Her face was fair, like a model’s, except she didn’t appear to be wearing any make up.

His heart skipped a beat as, somehow, her beauty seemed to magnify with every passing second. How could he have lived without having her with him? He needed to serve her and protect her, obey her every orders.

Peter felt his mouth dry up. She was the most beautiful person he had ever had the privilege to look at. He wasn’t worthy of such an honor, he-

"How old are you?" The goddess, his goddess, asked, raising an exquisite eyebrow at him.

"S-seventeen." He managed to stammer out.

She nodded, her every movement a thing of infinite beauty. He almost felt like tearing up from how gorgeous she-

He blinked.

His nose was itching, and his neck was tingling in a familiar way. He took a few steps back, raising his hands in front of him. Something was wrong. His stomach rolled, nauseous. He could feel bile rise up his throat.

"Too young for this type of game." The redhead tutted. He blinked dazedly at her, legs shaking slightly. She still looked beautiful but the ethereal quality she had earlier had completely disappeared.

She now appeared to be an exceptionally gorgeous woman, but one with a dangerous edge to her gaze. He felt very cold and small as she looked down at him from the top of her high-heeled boots.

"W-what was…" Peter stopped in his track, coughing violently. Something sticky came out of his throat and crashed on the ground. Pollen? He had never encountered that kind before…

"Shh…" The woman whispered, patting him on the shoulder. "Don’t ask questions, I hate it."

"But-"

"Hush, I said." She snapped and he felt a wave of dizziness overcome him. He stumbled back once again, bringing his hands up to his head. This wasn’t normal. He couldn’t think properly, but he was sure of it. Something was off.

The woman slid the pizza bag off of his back, taking great care to avoid touching his skin as she did so, as if it would burn her. He felt frozen, unable to move, feeling too nauseous to even-

"I see why Harley likes you." The odd lady hummed, taking the last pizza box out. She flicked it open and let its content fall to the ground with a sneer. "Trash." She whispered.

Peter blinked, trying to make sense of the words he was hearing. His mind was so slow, so muddy. His lungs felt weird, so did his throat, as if something was blocking them.

"You-…" He coughed out, "You’re… Harley’s girlfriend?"

She glared at him and he started choking, his throat swelling and burning.

"No questions." She hissed. "I do not trust you, little boy. I am only here as a favor to her."

Peter collapsed to his knees, scratching at his chest with his nails, trying to make the burning stop if only for a moment. Black spots started appearing in front of his eyes. He still couldn’t think properly.

"S-S…" He mouthed, gagging. "S-sorry."

She sighed in annoyance and he felt the pressure on his airways lessen, the heat slowly fading away. He could feel tears and snot on his face, as well as bile on his tongue. He had been dry-heaving, without even noticing it.

"I despise children." The woman, definitely either a powerful Metahuman or a master of poisons, informed him. "Get up. We have somewhere to be."

"It’s only been two days." He protested, still dragging himself back to his feet. He didn’t want to go through another round of choking on poisonous pollen. Maybe he needed to make that toxin resistant suit earlier than he had expected…

"The situation is urgent." His fellow meta replied. "We need to have you introduced before Christmas Eve."

"That’s tomorrow." He stammered, dizzy and wavering where he stood.

"Exactly."

Dropping his bag to the ground, she headed out of the bar. As she walked away, plants started to whither and yellow. Alright. Metahuman for sure, then.

He grabbed his pizza backpack from the dusty wood floor before following her. Evidently, Harley’s girlfriend was just as unhinged as she was. It had only be a single day since he accepted the woman’s offer and he was already supposed to be okay with fighting into a ring? People in this city ad absolutely no chill or common sense.

Well, with a bit of luck, he would just be shown the location of the fights, not actually thrown into one.

He was, however, strongly doubting it.

"Do not," the redhead hissed at him, as he fell into step next to her, "mention anything about Harley to anyone. If you do, I will learn about it and I will end your life."

She said it in such a confident way that Peter could do nothing but nod, cold sweat running down his back. What kind of people was he involving himself with in the name of intel and money?

He was regretting every single one of his recent decisions right now.

"Do you know who I am?" His dangerous guide asked him, as they left East End and walked south towards the docks.

He shook his head, not trusting her not to attempt to murder him if he said something she didn’t like. This, for some reason, earned him a laugh.

"Yes… this is why she likes you. Foolish boy." She shook her head. "Unless you are powerful enough to afford this level of idiocy, you will not live to see this summer."

They went down a flight of stairs that seemed to lead straight into the water of the Gotham Bay but suddenly curved and led into a tunnel just before it reached its surface. Harley’s girlfriend did not appear the least bothered as they made their way down a damp, dark waterway.

The smell, barely noticeable back at the entrance, became more and overpowering. They were in the sewers, Peter realized. He remembered that those were considered a dangerous place in the city, due to the amount of rogues who liked hiding out there.

They turned again and again until they reached what appeared to be a locked gate. They stopped in front of it and his guide, still perfectly calm in appearance, knocked on it rhythmically. One. One-Two. One. One-Two-Three-Four. One-Two.

Slowly, the door cracked open and a face peered through. A man in his twenties was standing on the other side, frowning in their direction.

"No more spectat- Oh shit." His eyes looked about to pop out of his skull as they landed on Peter’s companion. "Fuck. Sorry Ivy. Uh… ma’am. I uh…"

He cleared his throat and opened the door, stepping aside and bowing his head. Now that he was fully visible, his body armor was on full display. It was a step above what one would usually find on the streets. The weapons he was wearing also looked in better shape that what Peter had encountered during his shifts. This man wasn’t a common street thug.

Ivy -that name sounded familiar but he couldn’t quite remember why-, ignored the spluttering criminal and walked past him, heels clicking on the now dry floor. The area past the gate appeared much cleaner than the rest of the sewers, it made him feel extremely uneasy. He had no business being there.

He followed Ivy though, anxiety spiking. The man had mentioned spectators, were the fights already on? He didn’t dare ask anything, not wanting to make the woman angry.

Chattering reached him from the end of the corridor, which was closed off by a large steel gate, itself guarded by two more armed men. The older of them stepped forward, sweat visible on his brow.

"Welcome miss. We’re honored to have you with us." His voice was shaking slightly as he spoke, hands clutching his rifle.

Ivy ignored him, pointing at Peter instead.

"I came to sponsor the boy. I want him to compete tomorrow."

This seemed to startle the guard slightly but he quickly recovered. Apparently the woman’s short temper was somewhat well-known around town.

Where had he heard her name again?

Or maybe… did he read it?

"Ah. Of course!" The guard laughed uneasily. "Any… affiliations?"

It took Peter a few second to realize he was being spoken to directly. He coughed and straightened up, trying to look confident but knowing he was utterly failing.

"No… sir… I uh…"

"He won’t be competing as part of a group but as a meta." Ivy cut in, sounding supremely annoyed.

The man who until then had been regarding Peter with something between pity and amusement, narrowed his eyes. He shifted slightly, obviously reassessing the situation he was in. The poor guy was facing not one but two metas and, considering who had introduced him, he probably expected him to be as dangerous as her.

"Very… Very well. Narrows?"

"Just get on with it." Ivy snapped, glaring. The poor guard’s breath caught in his throat and he started rubbing it, looking more distressed by the second.

"He’ll have to fight a group tonight, make sure the show is good." The man warned after taking a few deep, visibly painful breaths. "A thousand if he wins but you have to dispose of the body yourself if he doesn’t."

Ah. Lovely.

Peter really, really missed his home. It had been so much easier when he had his aunt and his friends. He felt so out of his depths it wasn’t even funny anymore. His neck hadn’t stopped itching since they had stepped into the sewers, which only disquieted him more. What kind of powers did this woman have exactly?

"Schedule him soon, I am not fond of waiting." Ivy hissed, tapping her foot impatiently.

They were ushered in quickly after she said that, the two guards bowing politely as she walked past them. Peter’s nausea was getting worse by the minute.

"You better qualify." Ivy whispered as they made their way past the men. "A thousand is not enough."

"I keep half." He reminded her.

Surprisingly, that didn’t earn him another trip to pollentown but, instead, a nod.

"I know." His companion said. "Either way, it’s not enough. The Christmas Eve show will be worth more, there are always metas there."

He grimaced. He was expected to fight a meta tomorrow? He had no idea how powerful he was compared to the people of this world. This was a mistake. This was a terrible, foolish mistake.

It was all happening too fast. The corridor they were in slowly gave way to what appeared to be an arena dug into the stone. Every seat was filled with all kind of people, although a lot of them wore gang-related outfits. Hundreds and hundreds of them, all focused on the center of the room in which a large cage had been set up.

It was bigger than Peter’s apartment, several dozen feet wide and currently occupied by what looked like a complete free for all, people punching and kicking. The crowd screamed and surged every time one of the fighters hit the ground, blood was flying everywhere.

He felt dizzy.

"No weapons." A woman, dressed in all black except for a two-toned jacket informed him as he approached the stairs leading down to the cage. "We will provide the outfit to make sure you don’t sneak any in. You’re entering as a meta, right?"

Peter was too busy watching the absolute massacre that was happening in the arena to answer right away. It seemed like there were two opposing groups in there, each trying to bring the other down. Every fighter was, however, wearing the same non descript black shorts, sneakers and sleeveless shirts. It made the splash of blood on their fists and faces that much more striking. Red and black.

He felt like vomiting.

"You are entering as a meta?" The woman pressed him. Although he could tell she was irritated, she was still trying to be polite.

"Y-yeah." He breathed out, watching in horror as a man kicked a woman in the face, sending teeth flying. This was not anything like the boxing matches he had seen on TV, back when Uncle Ben was still alive. This was brutal.

"Epsilon? Delta?" She asked him, scribbling notes into a small book he hadn’t even noticed she was carrying.

"I… I don’t know…"

She snorted. "Guess we’ll see. Moved to the Narrows, uh? Got lucky there, kid."

His demeanor was apparently not intimating enough for him to be treated with the same amount of respect as Ivy, who had now disappeared. He didn’t even realize she was gone until now. The sounds, smells and emotions around him were overwhelming. It was hard to keep calm, to think straight.

What was he doing here?

"You’re going next." The notebook woman informed him. “You’ll be up against the Black Masks. If you survive, you’ll get a slot at tomorrow’s exhibition, during the beginner round."

This criminal underground fighting ring was oddly organized for something that had started only a couple days ago. That said a lot about the efficiency of the underworld in Gotham. Everything worked like a well oiled machine.

He was directed to a changing room, left of the arena, opposite from the entrance. There, several versions of the same outfit were laid down on benches, as well as keys to different lockers. The furniture in the room looked old-school, dusty. It was the only detail he had spotted so far that indicated the arena had been shut down until recently.

He could still hear the crowd yelling, voiced mixing with each other, turning into a muddled cacophony of sounds. He tried to plug his ears with his fingers, closing his eyes and breathing in.

It was useless. Even if the sound was muffled, his hyper-sensitive skin still detected every vibration. It ran up and down his body like insects, making him shiver.

Too much noise.

Slowly, he changed into the new clothes, feeling himself become more and more detached emotionally. He felt as if he was looking at himself from the outside as he moved, just a spectator to some bad, ridiculous movie.

What was he doing?

There was a mirror inside of the room, cracked and dirty. Someone a punched a hole in it, shattering most of it. In the shards that remained, he could see himself. Wearing all black, looking like he was about to go to gym class.

He felt like screaming.

What was he doing?

He walked towards the door, back into the arena, arms hanging limply at his sides. He was about to fight people in front of an audience full of criminals.

The crowd was still roaring, making his ears hurt and his head swim. It had happened too fast, everything seemed completely out of control.

Peter descended the stairs as if he was in a dream, or perhaps a nightmare, barely noticing people moving around him. They were jumping in their seats, shaking their fists, some of them cursing.

In the cage, one group had overtaken the other, two battered fighters standing over a heap of groaning bodies. They screamed together in exultation. He didn’t understand.

How could they be so happy when there was so much blood?

He reached the bottom step, still feeling dizzy and disconnected from his body. Someone cussed him out from blocking their line of sight before stopping and staring at me.

"On your own?" They asked, their face a blur in the midst of the surrounding chaos. "You a meta?"

The word was picked up by the people sitting next to him, spreading into the crowd. His face was uncovered, visible to all. He couldn’t breathe.

The gate to the cage opened, letting out the two victors. Their grins were marred with blood and grime, lines of sweat slithering down their faces.

What was he doing?

They walked past him, their eyes crossing for a moment. They didn’t look anything like the kind of people he was used to hanging out with. They looked cruel. Cold.

He wanted to go home.

He wanted to go home so bad.

Peter started walking towards the open gate, side-stepping the arena staff dragging the unconscious bodies out. One of them was not breathing.

One of them was not breathing.

He had just witnessed a murder.

Oh what was he doing here?

The brand new sneakers he was wearing squeaked as he stepped onto the stone floor inside of the cage. Blood, teeth and various bodily fluids were already spattered everywhere in dots or puddles. The night was getting late-

Oh no.

Oh no.

Marco was still waiting for him.

His heart sunk into his chest. It was too late to go back, though, he could already hear the footsteps of a group of adults, all heavier than him, approaching behind him. Making it past the gates. Only a few dozen feet away.

The crowd yelled in excitement. "META" some of them roared. Harley was right, superpowers were considered highly valuable in this place.

His cheat was hurting. He was so anxious.

"NEXT FIGHT" A voice cut through the fog of screams, flickering through speakers that hadn’t been used in months, perhaps years. "BLACK MASKS VERSUS META KID"

Meta kid? Really? Was that the best they could come up with? The indignation dragged him out of his stupor, bringing him back to the moment.

Suddenly, it all came crashing down on him. Where he was, what was about to happen. Time, which until then had seemed to trickle down slowly, regained its normal speed. His heart was beating way too fast.

He needed to focus.

He couldn’t waste his time spacing out like this, he had to get himself back together. He was going to get in a fight. He-

The fight had already started.

Peter was so panicked, he has missed the starting bell. Reality crashed into him once again as a fist slammed in his chest. It wasn’t strong enough to hurt but still, it shocked him into action.

He acted by instinct, grabbing the wrist of his attacker and twisting it, making them yell out in pain. He was about to follow that with a knee to the gut, finishing off the grunt for good, when something slammed against his back.

Of course. They were ganging up on him.

He looked around, twisting back to block another blow. Five of them, without any weapons or armor.

Well, that seemed hardly fair.

Still, he couldn’t let himself lose, even if he wasn’t in danger. His earlier panic subsided a bit as he let his instincts take over. No sticking, he thought over and over again like a mantra, only strength and speed.

The guy he had sent on the ground was getting back up, he could feel it, and the woman who had hit his back was still wailing down on him.

The other three thugs were circling him, ready to pounce.

He wouldn’t give them the time.

The woman feinted for his head and tried to take him by surprise by kicking his stomach. His back foot slid on the stone as he pivoted on his front leg, narrowly dodging the assault. Faster than any human could ever hope to move, he shot his left hand forward, grabbing her ankle and tightening his grip around it.

Peter finished his rotation and swung her around, holding her by the foot. She slammed into the first assaillant, who had been slowly getting into position to tackle him from behind.

It took less than a heartbeat. They collapsed in a heap, blessedly still breathing.

The thugs circling him cursed and jumped in.

At least… two of them did.

The last one stayed back, gasping, face deathly pale. Peter could barely hear the crowd’s roar but he could hear the man panting, smell his fear.

"That’s the fucking pizza guy!" The man screamed as his two fellow grunts reached Peter. "He- He did it again!"

His voice faded into the background as a first punch came in, followed immediately by a kick. Those two were trying to attack at the same time.

Dodging the blows were easy, even without his webs. Their movements seemed slow to him, simple to read. He ducked under the fist and diverted the leg away from him with the palm of his hand.

Too easy.

It made him feel strange, dispatching opponents in this way, without any struggle. The fight was completely unfair, rigged in his favor. Unless they had enhanced strength or a whole lot of training nobody could hurt him with their body alone. His skin was too resistant to shock, his healing too fast.

His fingers joined into a fist that he pushed into the chest of the kicker, who was still unbalanced, as he had thrown his whole body behind his leg. Beginner’s mistake. Those guys were street punks, little fry. No wonder the poor scared guy had recognized him : those were exactly the kind of low level thugs that would sell on the streets, one the lowest ranks in the criminal hierarchy.

Peter twisted his fist up, lifting the unfortunate grunt off the ground. He snapped his fist back to his side and, once again moving faster than humanly possible, planted his foot into his chest.

The guy went flying, rolling into the dirt for a few feet before slumping completely, out cold. His heart was still beating.

Meanwhile, the fourth assaillant, the one who had tried to punch him, was still finishing his attack, unaware of what had happened next to him. That kind of speed was not something he would have encountered in person. He was too low ranked for that.

Before the thug could get his bearings, Peter brought his foot back from its kicking position and shot towards him. His elbow slammed into the man’s ribs with a foreboding crunch. Too hard. He needed to hold back more.

The last of the four opponents who had tried to go against him slid to the ground, gasping. He didn’t get back up.

On the other side of the arena, the young man had rushed to the gate and was trying to get it to open. It wouldn’t budge. Everyone had to be down on one side of the fight for it to end.

Peter slowly walked towards him, hating himself as he could hear the man’s racing heartbeat, smell the terror coming off of him. He felt like a monster.

This wasn’t who he was.

This wasn’t who his aunt had raised him to be.

He could see the mobster’s face clearly now that he didn’t have to focus on taking out other assaillants. The man was barely older than him, probably still a teenager, his nose had been recently broken, twisted and blue, and Peter suddenly remembered Crime Alley and one of the fights he had gotten into there. Was this guy the one he had kicked in the face? It had been too dark for him to be sure but, considering the reaction he was getting, it seemed likely.

Wanting to end it once and for all, Peter surged forwards, closing the distance in between them in an instant. He reached out and grabbed the man’s shirt, dragging him with him.

For a moment, they were close to each other, he used those precious few seconds to lean forward and whisper :

"Pretend to be in pain."

Not wanting to have the exchange last too long and be spotted, Peter didn’t wait for a sign that the man had understood and, instead, lifted him off the ground by his shirt, which immediately started ripping. The momentum wasn’t lost, though, and the man went flying, rolling and tumbling away.

He leaped after him, landing next to the prone, groaning grunt. He hadn’t been slammed hard enough against the ground to be injured, but the stone was hard and it must have still been quite unpleasant.

Hoping that the few seconds he had to whisper his idea to the man had been enough, Peter brought his hand back and pretended to punch his defenseless opponent in the stomach. The crowd, which he had almost entirely forgotten by now, covered up the lack of noise as he stopped his hand before it hit skin.

It seemed like he had been understood. On the ground, the man yelled out in fake agony, twisting and curling his arms around his stomach protectively. It was a very convincing display.

And, just like that, Peter was left the only one standing in the cage.

It had taken only a couple minutes for him to dispose of the five attackers. He hadn’t even broken into a sweat, his breathing was even. In fact, he was still feeling cold.

Slowly, his eyes reached up towards the crowd, which was losing its mind over the display. He could see people yelling at him, cheering and cursing. Faces blended together, sounds clashed to become unrecognizable.

He kept looking, further above. There, a couple dozen feet above the last row of stone seats, an alcove had been dug into the cavernous walls. A flash of red caught his attention and he focused on the area more, noting more details as he did so. A buffet had been set up there, a small group gathering around it.

They were only a handful, talking between themselves. Peter could see Ivy there, sipping on a flute of what he assumed was champagne. Every other person around her was a complete stranger to him but he still tried to memorize their face. Clearly, this was were all of the important figures of the underworld gathered to spectate the fights. This what the intel he was there for.

An older man was standing apart from the tiny gathering, staring straight at the cage -at him. Behind him, the higher ranked criminals socialized and laughed. One of them had an odd hat on, another one was dressed like she came straight out of a costume store, with bunny ears and a skintight bodysuit. Another, yet, had a tight, cat themed outfit on.

All along, the crowd rumbled with excitement. It dawned upon him that he had won, and quite spectacularly at that.

Harley’s plan had worked. He proved that he was a meta to whatever criminal enterprise was in charge of organizing the event, and he would be getting his prize. Five hundred dollars, all for him.

It was dizzying. He had never really thought about using his abilities to get money in such a way, although one of his alternate self, the oldest one, had mentioned having to do something similar when starting out. He had assumed it was a joke but now he was almost certain the man had been perfectly serious.

Normal humans didn’t stand a chance against metas like him, not when they weren’t allowed to carry weapons.

It was odd, Peter expected to feel something a bit stronger, once the fight ended. Now that he was calming down, however, he found himself overtaken by a single, overpowering feeling.

Emptiness.

He stood there, listening to the crowd roar and the announcer declare his victory.

He stood there and he felt empty.

Alone.
Notes:

    Spoiler alert : "The pizza guy did it again!" becomes a huge meme in the Gotham criminal scene.

    The meta classification used here is expanding on some of the canon DC one. Quick rundown :

    Alpha/Level 5 : God-like being (Superman, Wonder Woman). There are only a handful of them in the universe.
    Beta/Level 4 : Very powerful, likely immortal or close to it. Powers such as : manipulating all elements, unlimited time and space control… etc. They are exceedingly rare but more common than Alphas.
    Gamma/Level 3 : Strong meta without immortality or reality bending abilities but still powerful enough to be less than 0.1% of the meta population. Tend to have either one very strong power or several powers at once. Peter is a gamma.
    Delta/Level 2 : Powers such as basic super strength, flight without anything else, enhanced healing, limited telepathy… etc. Basically a weak Gamma. About 5% of metas.
    Epsilon/Level 1 : Bending spoons and forks, having unnaturally good instincts, being able to read passing thoughts… About 94% of metas.

    -> Strange would be a Beta, Captain America a Gamma, Thanos with the gauntlet an Alpha, Daredevil a Delta. Hope it helps clear it up!

    When encountering a meta, DC universe people will assume that they are an Epsilon or a Delta, unless they see them doing something weird first.

Chapter 17: Regrets (But it’s too late)
Summary:

    The rest of Peter’s night doesn’t go too well either.

Chapter Text

Less than twenty minutes after the ending of the fight, Peter was back in his regular clothes, pizza bag secured, five hundred dollars in his pocket.

They had handed him the price in a wad of tens, sporting the face of a woman he couldn’t identify. Ivy took half of the cash as they left the main arena, looking like she wanted nothing more than to be out of the place.

He understood why. The fighting had resumed almost immediately after he had left the cage and the crowd was still wild. They would probably be going until morning, considering how many black uniforms Peter had seen in the changing room. He didn’t know how they could bear it, the sound, the smells… He had been there for less than an hour and, already, he wanted nothing more than to leave.

He would have to be back soon, however. His next fight was the very next day, and with a meta at that.

"You’re going at one tomorrow," the large man who gave him the money had said. “Delta division.”

That last part had been confusing to him, he still didn’t understand what the Ancient Greek alphabet had to do with illegal fighting rings, but he nodded either way. Numbness had started to spread through his body and was slowly settling in, making it easy to simply accept what was happening around him without questioning it. He couldn’t believe what he had just done.

Not only had he shown his face to every single criminal in the room, but he had also blown his cover as a regular teenager. Now that he had been outed as "the pizza guy", it would be easy to track him back to his regular job. Marco’s was, after all, the only restaurant in Gotham to deliver to anyone, anywhere.

And then what? Would they try to recruit him to join their group? Would they kidnap him? Every time he thought about it, the numbness was pierced by a sudden spike of anxiety. It was like a knife stabbing him through the heart, fear rising in a tide.

"Good job." Ivy told him, side stepping the corpse of a large rat as they headed towards the exit of the sewers. "It will never be as easy as this again, though."

Peter frowned, shaking away some of the emptiness to force himself into paying attention. His guide was walking slightly ahead of him, green dress miraculously devoid of any of the grime present everywhere else. His own shoes and pants were absolutely ruined, drenched in sewage water and blood.

There had been so much of it on the ground, before he even started fighting. He wondered if more people had died that night. It made him sick. He was a willing participant to a festival dedicated to violence and death. Him. Peter Parker from Queens.

He had to make it count, had to make sure he got good information off of this, had to use the money properly.

He wouldn’t be selfish with the price. He’s invest it into what really mattered : Spider-Man. Gotham needed more vigilantes, despite the large amount she already had. They weren’t able to be everywhere at once, especially not in times like those. He remembered Crime Alley and the way the streets had degraded since the break-out.

He was needed here.

Ivy turned her head to look at him, a displeased expression on her face. He didn’t know what he had done to make her angry, this time around. It was hard to figure out the people of this city, especially the criminals.

"Not asking any questions?" She remarked.

He shook his head. He remembered very well what had happened the last time he had made the mistake of treating her like a normal, balanced person. She was very much extraordinary, both in how she reacted to what he did and in how powerful she seemed to be. That was something she had in common with her girlfriend, with the exception that Harley appeared to rely on weapons and reputation rather than meta status.

He wished he could question her about her abilities but that, too, would have to wait until she warmed up to him, which might never happen. He wasn’t even sure if he wanted it to happen, in fact. Harley supposedly liked him and look where that had gotten him…

"Good. At least you can learn." Ivy noted. "They classified you as a Delta. The next time you have to fight a group, it will be a bigger one, and they will be allowed weapons."

He started, surprised that she would tell him all of this. She had seemed not to like him very much so far, why would she try to help? Was this a trap?

Ivy noticed his confused frown and sighed.

"You have potential, child. You are an extremely useful tool."

She said it in such a calm way that it took a few seconds for her words to fully register in Peter’s mind. Lovely. Now he had another dangerous potentially murderous woman wanting to use him for her own benefit. Only the second one in a week.

"I don’t want you to die so soon." Ivy told him. "It’s likely you won’t survive what is coming but, in the meantime, helping you is helping the one I love."

She was very careful never to say Harley’s name, Peter realized, even now that they weren’t in the arena anymore. Whatever was happening with her girlfriend must be serious if even someone this feared in the criminal community was watching her tongue. Did she accidentally piss off the wrong person?

They finally reached the mouth of the tunnel and Peter took in a deep breath. Salt, smoke and sewage mixed together, alongside a sharp, cold, feeling. The blizzard was still raging outside, and the moonlight reflected itself off of hundreds of chunks of ice, floating in the waterway.

The Bay itself hadn’t frozen yet, but it was probably only a matter of time before the rivers cutting through Gotham did. He wondered if it would be solid enough to walk on.

Ivy seemed completely unbothered by the snow and the wind despite only wearing a dress. He envied her. Why did he get all kinds of powers except frost resistance?

The obvious answer was because spiders tended not to do well in below freezing temperatures but still. It was unfair.

They stepped up onto the docks and Ivy stopped, turning to face him.

"I will meet you here tomorrow at midnight. Don’t be late." She blew him a kiss.

As soon as the words left her mouth, Peter’s throat started to swell up. Dark spots flew in front of his eyes and his knees gave out. He gagged, kneeling on the snow, his whole body shaking and burning.

It hurt.

Then, as suddenly as it had appeared, the feeling went away, leaving him aching and exhausted, curled up in the snow.

He was not surprised to see that Ivy had disappeared, once he regained his bearings. She probably didn’t want him to follow her back to where Harley was hiding out. Not that he wanted to, really. The only thing on his mind right now was a hot shower and-

Ah. Right. Warm water wasn’t on this late at night.

A cold shower would have to do, then.

Peter got to his feet awkwardly, still rubbing his chest and throat. It was hard to feel his face and fingers, as the cold had only worsened since the last time he had been outside. They were truly in the middle of winter, now.

At least he had money for a coat.

He didn’t know what time it was but he could tell it was late. The streets were quieter than normal, even the usual gangs chased away by the snow. He didn’t feel like braving the icy roofs again so he went back to Marco’s on foot. For once, he didn’t have to worry about being jumped.

He hoped his boss wasn’t too worried about him. Maybe he could tell him that the GPS malfunctioned in the cold and he got lost? That he had been involved in an altercation? Those excuses seemed flimsy to him, especially considering the state of his clothes. He just had to pray that the man wasn’t too informed about the state of the criminal world.

There was only one building with lights on when he reached the pizzeria’s street. Inside of it, Peter could see the shape of a man, Marco, hunched over a table, head in his hands. As he got closer, he noticed the large amount of cigarettes laying at the bottom of an empty beer bottle, as well as a half full jar of what looked very much like hard liquor. Bad sign.

The door jingled as he pushed it, making his boss jump violently. The man looked up at him with surprise, as if he hadn’t expected to see him come back.

Crap. He looked disturbed enough that he might actually be aware of what had just happened.

"Uh." Peter stumbled, trying to remember the excuses he had been planning to give. "Sorry I’m late, I-"

"Sit down." Marco snapped, straightening up, a glare slowly starting to form on his face.

"Yessir." He gulped, feeling like a child being scolded. He hurriedly took his bag off and plopped down on the seat he was being pointed to.

Was he going to get fired? He squirmed uneasily, twisting his hands in his lap.

Marco did look angry in a way he had never seen before, his jaw clenched and brows tight. He was also obviously intoxicated, if the smell of his breath was any indication. 

"Peter…" The man sighed heavily, rage bleeding out of him in an instant, replaced with something very much like exhaustion. "Are you trying to get yourself killed?"

"I-uh…"

He didn’t understand what was happening. Words clashed in his head but he was unable to turn them into a sentence. Unfinished ideas and raging emotions kept him from doing anything more than stammering.

He didn’t want to lose his job.

"When I learned that you were a meta…-" Marco started, "… I was really happy. I thought: finally, a kid who has a chance. But no. The kid’s got to be an outsider. Knows nothing about this town."

He was slurring heavily now, wavering a bit in his chair. Peter wanted to reach over and steady him. He didn’t, though. He felt frozen to the spot, stuck in his own seat.

Then, the meaning of the words hit him.

"W-Wait… were you at the-"

"Of course not!" Marco snapped, slamming his hand on the table. "I’ve lost enough people to this fucking death trap.”

"Then… how?"

The adult snorted humorlessly, eyes still dark. 

"How?" He repeated. "Kid, you showed up to my restaurant with the same boots and gloves that were splattered on every newspaper a few days after. I’ve known you were a meta since Firefly attacked."

Peter couldn’t help but stare at him, mouth slightly open. Marco knew? He had known for days now and…

He was happy that he was a meta? Even after seeing him fight Firefly?

Oh god. Marco had seen him in the Spider Suit. He had seen him in the Spider Suit and then had traced it back to him.

That was one too many twists for that night. His head was starting to hurt, he wanted to go back to his apartment already, hide under the covers. He wanted May, he wanted Ned…

He wanted MJ.

"Look, Peter…" Marco sighed, shoulders slumping. "Kids like you are exactly what those people love to break. You’re getting in over your head and it is not a good time to do it."

Peter didn’t have the energy to defend himself or to explain. Really, part of him agreed with the man. He was being an idiot, getting involved in the underworld.

Issue was, he couldn’t really stop. Ivy had been quite convincing when it came to making him not want to cross her. On top of that, he kept thinking about what kind of people he would see during the Christmas Eve fight. If it was as big an event as what he suspected, he might get a glimpse of some of the most important crime lords.

It would give him a good idea of who was active in Gotham or not, which he could then relay to Gordon, whenever the man asked to see him again. That was the whole reason why he had accepted Harley’s offer in the first place.

In front of him, Marco was grabbing a cigarette and his lighter off of the table. He then stood up and walked a few feet away, towards the entrance of the restaurant. His leg still looked painful, he was dragging it behind him, limping more heavily than usual.

He opened the front door, letting in a blast of cold air, and leaned against the wall closest to it, lighting his smoke. He looked defeated and old. When he spoke, his voice was sad.

"There’s nothing I can do to stop you. It’s your choice.” He shook his head, took a drag. The silence weighed heavily between the two of them before he started speaking again, more quietly : "Just know, kid… I’ve made this kind of choices before, and I’ve regretted it. If you stick to this job, well… It might not be the safest, but I’m pretty sure you could survive it."

As he spoke, smoke escaped his lips, lazily curling into the snowy wind. Peter stayed silent, guilt eating him up.

"This ring," Marco told him, "is known for attracting powerful spectators. Very powerful. Some of them like a challenge. I’ve seen it before, back in the days. There are only two endings to this for you."

The hand that wasn’t holding the cigarette reached up slowly, shaking.

"One." His fingers shaped the number, still trembling. "You lose and get killed." Getting the words out looked almost painful, his face was pale. "Two." He mimed it again. "You survive long enough to attract the attention of someone stronger than you and then you lose and get killed. Believe me, Gotham has some extremely dangerous people living in it."

Peter shuddered. He was already anxious enough at the idea of facing his first meta in this world, and this wasn’t helping matters.

"I can’t back out." He finally replied, hating the way his voice shook. 

"I know." Marco told him somberly. "I’m sorry Peter. Fuck.”

He threw the half smoked cigarette out into the snow. He still sounded drunk, his speech lightly slurred. Despite this, his eyes were surprisingly clear when he turned back towards the inside of the restaurant.

"I need you to promise me something.” He said, pointing at Peter. "Listen. Carefully." A deep breath, then : "Mgonna do interviews tomorrow. We’ll get a new driver by the 26th. Listen."

"I-I’m listening."

"Promise me. Do not. Ever. Get them involved. If you make any money off of it, don’t flaunt it to them, don’t make them want to try it. Shit, even for non-metas it’s a fucking…"

He clenched his fists, visibly unable to go on. Peter felt absolutely terrible. There was obviously something very sensitive about the subject and he had just… Because of him, Marco was…

"I promise." He swore, standing up to face the older man. "I won’t get them involved, I swear."

"Good." Marco whispered. "And you be… you be fucking careful. If it gets too bad, let me know. I can get you out of the city."

Although unneeded, this was a really touching gesture. But also a worrying one, since he was now starting to wonder if the pizzeria was actually a front for a criminal organization of some kind. The way Marco had said that last sentence seemed to imply something a bit less… legal than just buying him a plane ticket.

"Than-"

"Don’t fucking thank me." The man growled. "It’s my fault you’re in this situation in the first place. I don’t want to have your death on my conscience too."

Silence stretched after that last word, sometimes broken by the howling of the wind or a distant police siren. After a few more seconds, Marco began limping away from the door.

"We’re closed tomorrow. No time for cooking. Here’s your pay for tonight."

He slammed a couple of bills on the table next to Peter and left him there, without any further goodbyes.

The boy was left alone in the cold night.

He felt like he deserved it.

Chapter Text

Peter didn’t sleep much that night but, once he did, it wasn’t peaceful. He woke up to the wind howling outside, gasping and sweating, his aunt’s name on his lips.

He didn’t know what was making him feel worse, the guilt over having to beat up a group of unarmed, defenseless non-metas or the fact that he was going back to the serpent’s nest this very evening. Ivy had been quite clear, she expected him to compete.

The previous night, after dragging himself back from the pizzeria, he had spent some time looking through the "Welcome to Gotham" pamphlet. As expected, he had found her in it, on page fifteen.

Poison Ivy, she was nicknamed. Known to be able to spread poisonous and sometimes mind altering pollen, as well as control plant life. She was considered highly dangerous when crossed, but the page noted that she tended to go after those who went against her beliefs.

She was a staunch ecologist, which he could have gotten behind hadn’t she also been a confirmed murderer and terrorist. Killing for one’s ideals was a line that Peter never wanted to cross himself. Death was too extreme, it was an admission of powerlessness. It wasn’t the only option, in many cases, nor the best one.

Harley wasn’t mentioned on the page, and she didn’t have an article herself. Either she wasn’t dangerous enough to warrant it, or she hadn’t been active back when the pamphlet had been written.

Still, learning who he had spent the previous night with was enough to chill him to his core. Ivy was a murderer. She had been linked to several cases of poisoning, sure, always connected to major cases of corruption or environmental disasters, but killing was reprehensible either way. That was what uncle Ben and aunt May had taught him.

At least now he had an idea of how to avoid getting trapped by her poison. Although he didn’t have much resistance to cold, he did have the ability to hold his breath for an unnaturally long time. Ned and him had timed it together, years ago, when he had just started developing his powers. He could easily go ten minutes without air and, with some discomfort, could extend that up to fifteen.

Considering regular humans could train themselves to last longer without air, he might also be able to do so.

That was something he would have to try, at least until he could make his first toxin-filtering suit.

Staring at the roof above him, Peter tried to find comfort in thinking about spider suits, web fluids and programming. It wasn’t working, he kept shivering and being dragged back to reality whenever wind crashed against the walls of his room. It was so loud, under the roof.

His thin secondhand blanket wasn’t enough to ward off most of the chill. Attic rooms weren’t well insulated, and the snow piling up above the building was making the walls and ceiling as cold as ice.

Groaning, he dragged himself off of his mattress and stumbled into the small bathroom. He was awake earlier than usual, might as well take advantage of it and enjoy some hot water.

Grime and dirt pooled at his feet as he scrubbed his skin, rubbing his hands over and over again. They looked perfectly ordinary but he knew that they were strong enough to kill a grown man with a simple shove.

A flash. He remembered cracking, his elbow digging into ribs, too far, too hard. His foot making a nose explode, his hand clenching again and again as he slammed a man’s face into the stone, fire roaring around them.

Peter turned the water off, kneeled down in the small shower. He was feeling nauseous.

He wanted someone, anyone, to talk to. He missed the video calls he used to have with MJ, the evenings he had spent playing games online with Ned, whispering so his aunt wouldn’t catch him staying up late on a school night.

Being alone at all times wasn’t good for him. The loneliness was worse than any guilt, any fear. But how could he meet anyone to befriend? He didn’t exist in this world, didn’t have papers, didn’t go to school, didn’t have coworkers or…

Right. He would be getting a coworker soon.

He blinked, noticing how cold he was starting to get, sitting like this in the shower. He wasn’t feeling like himself lately, his emotions were almost impossible to control.

If only he had someone to talk to.

Maybe the new delivery driver would be around his age, maybe they could even become friends.

He didn’t dare hope too much, though, not wanting to be disappointed. So far, he hadn’t met anyone his age worth trusting in Gotham. That probably had something to do with the fact that most teenagers like him were in school, not walking around the worst parts of town.

Peter started drying himself off, staring into the mirror as he did so. His skin was smooth, free of any scars or bruises.

Less than a week ago, his body had been severely burned and injured. All traces of it had faded in a couple days and he looked as healthy as ever. He was lucky to have such a gift, many vigilantes probably dreamed of being able to bounce back right after they got injured.

He shouldn’t let his powers go to waste. He would be careful. He would show Marco and Ivy that he could survive Gotham. It wasn’t like he was planning to do it forever, anyways. As soon as he and Harley had enough money to accomplish what they needed to, he would stop.

First of all, he needed to find a computer. Without it, he couldn’t research the materials available to him, nor order anything, once he got his hand on a pre-payed credit card-assuming they existed in this universe-. Christmas being right around the corner, there would be plenty of used laptops to grab in every secondhand store. That and likely many other useful things.

It was a bit odd to think he would soon be able to afford every piece of equipment he needed to make his new suits, especially after having struggled so hard to get what he already had.

Peter didn’t feel like going out in the cold before he had to, but he didn’t feel like working or reading either. After getting dressed and eating rice off of an old pizza box -he needed to get some proper plates-, he ended up sitting down on his freezing ceiling, radio on.

"-fident that only a few explosives are left in town, most likely underground. Once again, police asked citizens not to try and disarm any device on their own and instead contact the proper authorities."

Not in the mood for yet another set of gloomy Gotham news, Peter bent back, reaching out with his left arm and unsticking himself from the ceiling. He landed on his hand easily, lowering himself to his feet with a little flip.

It was fun to move like that. He missed having the city as his playground to run, jump and swing around in.

Soon. He would get that feeling back soon. He was going to get the money for it, after all. The only other thing he needed now was hard work.

He switched the station to a music only one and jumped back up to the ceiling, sticking to it with the tip of his fingers. He swung around for a bit, playing with his powers as safely as he could in the small space, before stopping and closing his eyes.

He took a deep breath, closed his mouth.

He had some free time, might as well try to use it for some of that breathing practice.

 

oOo

 

Breathing practice was boring.

Unfortunately for Peter, he was so preoccupied by the upcoming fight that he didn’t have the motivation to do anything else. As such, he spent the afternoon bored out of his mind, walking up and down his walls. The good thing with snowy windows were that they completely hid whatever he was doing inside of his apartment. Not that anyone would see him either way, as they were connected to the roof, but still.

Darkness fell and, soon enough, it was time for him to head out. Gotham was very different that night when he jumped out of his window to land on the soft snow covering the roof. Even there, in the Bowery, people hung lights on their windows and doors, making the streets glitter with a distinctively festive mood.

He could smell food cooking from inside the buildings around him, hear people chatting. It was as if, for one evening, the break-out and everything it entailed had been forgotten.

Peter ached for that kind of normalcy. Holidays with his loved ones, gifts and well wishes, all things he had taken for granted as he grew up, all things he had now lost.

How gloomy.

Snow stuck to his damaged sneakers and scuffed pants when he walked but he tried to ignore it. He wouldn’t be wearing them for the fight anyway.

Climbing and running through the blizzard, Peter wondered what kind of meta he would have to face. He hadn’t fought any super powered villain yet in this world, and the one battle he had been involved with had not turned out well for anyone there. Hopefully, with the setting being more controlled, nothing bad would happen that night. He wasn’t even going to be the only one fighting, this was an exhibition after all.

Maybe he should try to stick around after his turn in the cage, attempt to glean more information by watching meta criminals fight. He wasn’t sure Ivy would let him, though. She had been very insistent on leaving as early as possible the previous night, and had no reason to act differently that day.

The docks were almost empty, a few look-outs from various gangs and industrial groups the only souls walking along the bay. Even criminals had holidays, it seemed.

Ivy was waiting for him where she had told him to meet her earlier, wearing a brand new dress that appeared to be made of plants rather than fabric. It moved across her skin in small, intricate patterns, flowers burgeoning and fading in the span of a few seconds.

"That’s amazing." He whispered, before he could stop himself.

To his surprise, it earned him a small smile from the woman. It was then that he noticed the small box she had in her hand. It wasn’t wrapped, only a simple cardboard cube. He was extremely confused when she handed it to him.

"This is a test." She informed him flatly. "Take good care of her."

Hesitantly, Peter grabbed the offered box and peeked inside. Snuggled there, inside of a pot that seemed slightly to big for it, was a little plant.

"Is this… for…" He snapped his mouth shut before the question could leave his lips. Now was not a good time to get poisoned.

"She is from the Haworthia family. They are relatively easy to take care of. Do not overwater her."

On those words, the redhead turned away and headed towards the stairs leading to the sewers. It took Peter a few seconds to get over the strange interaction, staring helplessly at the small plant in his hands, before he ran after her.

They followed the same path they had the previous day. He tried to calm his nerves by focusing on remembering the way ahead. Left turn, right turn, right turn, climb up a ladder, now go down a slope.

The door again. They were there.

His breathing had calmed a bit but he still felt anxious. He couldn’t hear the crowd yet, but his skin could feel the vibrations coming from the loud cheering. A large bang managed to pass the two iron doors between them and the arena.

The fighting had already started of course. This time around, every single person in that cage would be a meta, like him.

Important people would be there, too. More so than the ones he’d seen the night before. He wished he had spent more of his afternoon memorizing the rogues’ faces but what he knew would have to suffice.

Ivy knocked at the door, he counted every hit of her knuckle on the cold iron. One. One-Two. One. One-Two-Three-Four. One-Two.

Focusing on information instead of emotions helped him deal with his anxiety, separating himself from what was happening to Peter and trying to think of it as a Spider-Man mission.

Except he didn’t have a mask.

It was too late to go back. He knew it. His hands squeezed into fists, the only way to stop them from shaking. Fighting another meta with his face visible to all… He wouldn’t be able to restrain his strength, everyone would see how dangerous he could be.

It was nerve-wracking.

As Spider-Man, it was fun to play with his powers and do tricks. As Peter, however, it went against everything he had tried to accomplish these past few years.

Old habits were hard to break, especially when he didn’t really even want to break them.

He still dreamed of going to school, getting a job and a house. He still believed in it. That wouldn’t happen if it became known that he was a meta, and one involved in dangerous criminal activities, on top of that.

Ivy led him past the first gate into the dry stone corridor. Lights had been added on the wall, this time stripes of red cutting accros the harsh ceiling and walls. The ground had been covered by a plush, black carped.

Peter gulped. Just how important were the people coming to this event? Most of the previous day’s audience had been younger street criminals, the kind he would see at night while delivering orders. This was looking a bit more extra than that.

The guards in front of the second gate did not ask any questions this time. They were the same as the two from before, and they greeted them with a nod, stepping aside to let them through.

His stomach churned, thinking that he was now known by face among a part of the underworld. Would he really be able to go back to a normal life after that?

The noise slammed into him as the door opened fully, louder than ever before. Alcohol, smoke and other various smells mixed together, before being overpowered by another scent: blood.

The arena was darker than it had been the previous night, spotlights shining on the cage alone. Several strips of red LED tape decorated the walls, creating patterns in the darkness. What a strange way to celebrate the holiday… it was in character for Gotham, though.

In the cage, two metas were fighting. One of them, he could recognize, especially since he had read about him before. Seeing a picture online, however, didn’t compare to witnessing it in real life.

In a way, Killer Croc looked a lot like the lizard man he had fought and eventually cured with his alternate selves a couple weeks ago. He was a lot bigger, though, perhaps eight or nine feet tall, and his teeth looked much longer.

Sharper, too.

He was facing a strange creature, humanoid but winged and wrinkled, with large claws instead of fingers. The strange being stayed to the top of the cage, away from Croc’s reach. The tension between them was so thick Peter could taste it.

It was something primal, he knew. His DNA had been modified by the bite and his instincts had changed with it, even outside of the Spider Sense. He could smell emotions and sense fear in people, like a predator hunting for prey.

Spiders were tiny hunters, but their instincts remained the ones of a killer. Prowling, setting traps, killing, eating.

And, right now, Peter could feel the presence of several other metas such as him. Croc, surprisingly, wasn’t one. His appearance must come from something other than an actual animal then…

The creature he was fighting, though…

Peter barely noticed Ivy leaving him to climb towards the VIP lounge, focusing on the fight and not on his surroundings. The flying hybrid was attempting a dive attack, going for Croc’s eyes with its claws, mouth wide open, showing off long, glistening white fangs.

The bigger meta, however, saw him coming, shielding his face with an arm that was five times as wide as Peter’s thigh. The claws scrapped away at the green scales covering it, barely managing to chip its surface.

Slashing didn’t work well against Croc, he noted. This was good for him, as he mostly relied on blunt force while fighting. He would have to try it out himself, though.

The hybrid tried to fly away from its opponent before it could be grabbed. Instead of using his hands, though, Croc reached upwards with his head, opening a mouth that was full of several rows of sharp, dangerous fangs.

Peter grimaced as the teeth sunk into the creature’s ankle. The hybrid howled in pain, shrill and unpleasant. Next to him, he could hear some audience members curse.

Right.

He was supposed to be fighting soon, too.

Trying to calm his nerves once again, he looked across the hidden arena. The people present tonight looked older and with nicer clothes than the ones from the previous day. He could see weapons, clean and new for the most part, on display next to many of them. Some didn’t even look to be part of the criminal world, dressed like upstanding citizens with suits and ties.

As for the alcove he had noticed earlier, it was hard for him to see it from where he was as it was situated right above the entrance. He’d have to talk to the book lady and go get changed to get an excuse to switch to the other side of the room.

He could see her further down on the stairs leading to the cage, holding the same notebook as before. She was wearing a full body suit, two-toned pink and black, an attire he could see on some other spectators around the arena, despite the lack of light. Her hair was tied in a tight, precise bun.

Tonight was indeed a big deal, all of those mobsters were dressing up like they were going to a gala.

Peter started climbing down the stairs towards her. A loud booming noise, however, made him stop in his tracks.

Inside of the cage, Croc had grabbed the winged hybrid by the throat and had slammed him against the ground, shattering the stone around them. The man let go of his hold, raising his fist and pummeling his prone opponent again and again.

Peter’s neck started tingling, soft and distant.

On the ground, broken and bloodied, the creature slowly lifted its head under the unrelenting assault.

It opened its mouth.

And then it screamed.

The sound bounced off the stone walls of the underground arena, magnified by the space, echoing in Peter’s head. It was one of the worst sounds he had ever heard, making him grab his temples and yell out in agony. His ears felt like they were burning, his body was shaking violently.

He slammed his hands on his ears, pressing down as hard as he could. It was useless, the scream was still ringing, leaving the hybrid’s broken maw in a long wail. Tears started coming up to Peter’s eyes, his stomach rolled.

He was vaguely aware of the crowd around him cursing and groaning, of the smell of puke and bile. Several people collapsed next to him.

The shrill, suddenly, was covered up by a howl. Anger. Rage.

"SHUT UP!" Croc roared, grabbing the creature by its throat and squeezing until the sound stopped. Silence, precious silence soothed Peter’s mind like a balm. He staggered, somehow managing to stay on his feet.

His vision cleared to the picture of the giant meta throwing the hybrid on the shattered stone ground and digging one of his feet in its ribcage, bringing it back, then stomping again.

"SHUT UP!" The giant was still screaming, well after the hybrid has lost consciousness. "SHUT UP!" His eyes were wild, furious.

It took a while for Peter to regain his bearings. The criminals around him struggled back to their feet, some of them clapping.

"Show him Croc!" The bookkeeping lady cheered, rubbing at her temples with her free hand.

Croc roared in pleasure, obviously enjoying the positive attention from the crowd and resumed his merciless beating. A rumble of approval spread through the seats as more and more people managed to stand back up and get back to watching the show.

His ears ringing uncomfortably, Peter stumbled down the few steps between him and the suit-wearing woman. She noticed him quickly, flashing him a smile. There was a glint of excitement and rage in her eyes that disturbed him greatly.

The people who worked for these kinds of shows were obviously not the most trustworthy… or stable.

"Oh yes, you’re the Pizza Guy." She beamed at him. "Good luck tonight, you’re going after them."

She sounded distant, as if she was coming from behind a waterfall, or a wall. His mind was still ringing with the echoing wail.

Her breath smelled of something chemical, and her pupils looked too small for her to be completely sober. From the behavior of those around them, Peter knew that she wasn’t the only one under the influence that night.

"Oh. Right." She laughed awkwardly, "Prize money is five grand." She leaned in and whispered : "I don’t think you’re going to win, though."

She giggled after saying this, as if it had been a particularly funny joke. Peter narrowed his eyes at her. He might look like a regular teenager, especially out of costume, but he had faced stronger people than what this place could throw at him.

That was it, he realized. Fighting without his suit and webs was throwing him off but, even without them, he knew he was strong. As gruesome as Croc’s rampage was, as strong as his blows looked, Peter knew that Spider-Man could take him down.

Now, he just needed to prove to himself that good ol’ Peter could do that too. Obviously, he wouldn’t be fighting Croc but…

Wait a minute.

The lady had said the price was…

Five thousands?

His mouth dried up, heart missing a beat. This was money beyond what he had dared to expect. With that amount, added to the cash he already had, he would be able to get a computer, materials, tools, chemicals, clothes…

He shook his head, amazed, then headed to the opposite side of the arena. There was so much money to be made in a place like this, it was honestly terrifying.

The ruthless assault kept going on inside the cage, the hybrid miraculously still breathing despite most of the bones in its body being broken. Enhanced healing perhaps? He had to walk past the scene to get to the other side of the arena. People there were still groaning on the ground, holding their ears.

He hurried to the changing room door but didn’t push it when he reached it. Instead, he looked straight at the VIP area, hoping they were too distracted by the fight to notice him staring.

There were significantly more people than before standing there, some of them chatting, most of them watching the massacre. His eyes flickered from unknown face to unknown face, until he settled on one he recognized.

He breathed out slowly.

Short, overweight, with a cane and a sneer on his face. He had seen him before in pictures but hadn’t expected to ever meet him face to face.

Oswald Cobblepot, The Penguin, one of the most powerful crime lords in Gotham had come that night. And, next to him, Peter could see Ivy, looking down at him with a slight smirk.

What are you waiting for? Her eyes seemed to say. Go and make us some money.

He needed to find a way to sneak a camera in, take a shot of Cobblepot next to all these other crimin-

His neck itched. He felt like he was being watched.

Further left from the Penguin, still inside the VIP lounge, the old man he had noticed the previous day was staring at him. He was mostly hidden in shadows but Peter could recognize his stark white hair and posture.

This night, he was wearing a body armor without a helmet. Black and orange, half of it melted into the darkness while the other part reflected the few lights around him, glowing slightly red.

Peter shivered, taking a step back. The old man had one of the most threatening auras he had ever felt, unsettling him to his core.

He backed away into the changing room, disturbed. He kept walking away from the door once he had closed it, not daring to turn his back to it, captivated by the stranger’s presence.

"Look where you’re going, brat!" A rumbling voice growled behind him.

He jumped, turning around as fast as he could.

What he saw was one of the oddest creatures he had ever laid eyes on.

Her body visibly feminine, another human-animal hybrid was standing behind him, towering over the room, so tall she almost reached the ceiling. Her skin looked thick and slippery, simple white and black patterns spread across her muscular arms, legs and chest.

As for her face…

She was a killer-whale.

She was a woman with the head of a killer-whale.

Not only that, as she looked down at him he could see the sharp teeth inside of her… mouth? Oh why did he have to be aware of the facts that orcas had one of if not the strongest bites among all sea mammals?

With enough luck, she would be a bit less powerful than her ocean-bound cousins. He didn’t really want to find out, though. He was reminded of Croc’s fangs digging into the hybrid’s ankle.

"S-sorry ma’am" He let out, unable to tear his gaze away from her head. She had a fin at the back of it. A fin.

The humongous lady narrowed her eyes at him, cracking her massive knuckles.

"Are you the one I’m supposed to fight?"

Her voice was low and deep, more inhuman than masculine as she seemed to drag the sounds from a different set of vocal chords than what regular humans had access to.

"Y-yeah." He was distracted by the way her muscles moved under her skin. It looked odd, shapes all different than what he was used to.

"Tch." She shook her head. "Easy money."

He stepped aside as she headed out of the changing room, the mandatory sports clothes tight on her. She hadn’t bothered with shoes, her body too large for this kind of apparel.

Peter watched her go silently, frantically trying to remember anything he knew about killer-whales other than their agressive tendencies and incredible strength. They were fast, for marine animals. Not nearly as fast as him, but still much faster than a regular human.

He visited the bathroom adjoined to the locker room, washing his face with cold water and staring at himself in the sink mirror, which had not been broken. He looked like himself, same hair, same nose, same mouth.

His eyes, though, were colder.

He really needed to find some company. Interacting only with his boss, delivery clients and high ranking criminals was not doing anything good to his personality or mental health.

Peter changed into the night’s uniform. The black shorts were still there but the shirts had been switched for white ones. His stomach rolled when he realized it was probably so the audience could see any injury more easily.

The sneakers slipped on without any struggle, perfectly fitting his feet. Lucky. Hopefully, that was a good sign for the rest of the night.

He stored Ivy’s plant and his day clothes into one of the lockers and, after another trip to the bathroom to drench his face in cold sink water, opened the door.

Peter stepped back into the arena, heart thundering.

The killer-whale woman was already stepping into the cage, sneering at the broken body of the winged creature, rasping weak, dying breaths, sprawled on the stone. She snarled and grabbed the back of its head.

She swung and, without any apparent effort, sent the large hybrid flying away from the fighting area. It crashed in front of the first row of seats, to the excitement of the crowd.

”LADIES AND GENTLEMEN" The speakers announced: "HERE FOR THE SECOND TIME THIS YEAR, READY TO TEAR THE COMPETITION APART, I GIVE YOU… ORCA!"

Orca smirked as the audience chanted her name, raising one of her fists into the air. She seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the event.

Peter started walking, back straight, eyes staring ahead, straight towards the cage. Adrenaline flooded into his veins, making him feel awake, alert.

This time, he would actually have to be careful. This orca lady could definitely be dangerous, especially with those teeth of hers. He would have to use his speed to his advantage, try to take her down before she got her fangs on him.

"AND NOW JOINING HER INTO THE CAGE, SOME OF YOU MAY RECOGNIZE HIM… IT’S THEEEE PIZZA GUY! WILL HE DO IT AGAIN TONIGHT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN?"

Orca snorted. "Pizza guy?" She taunted him as he stepped into the ring. "Is that your power, shrimp?"

"Guess you’ll see." Peter smirked, now ready for the fight. He had to trust in his skills and abilities. He had faced stronger foes.

Even without his suit, he could do it.

So, he forgot the crowd and the villains watching and began circling Orca, walking with his hands to his sides. The door closed with a clang and, soon, the hybrid woman followed him in his pacing.

They circled each other, neither of them ready to make the first move yet. The crowd has quieted, waiting and watching. Tension was at its peak.

Then, with a roar, Orca leaped in his direction, feet thundering on the ground, sending bits of gravel and rocks fly with every step. She picked up speed as she approached, mouth wide open, arms ready to strike.

Before she could reach him, Peter jumped into the air, timing it so his feet ended up above her face by the time she got to where he was standing. He used her forehead as a springing board, pushing as hard as he could as he jumped behind her.

Not knowing how effective the maneuver had been, he slammed his hands on the ground, vaulting and twisting in the air to land in a crouch, facing his opponent’s back. To his surprise, she didn’t seem to have been affected by his blow at all, turning her head to look at him, rage burning behind her glare.

"Brat…" she growled.

"Fish!" Peter replied, his tongue getting ahead of his brain now that he was getting into the fight. His Spider-Man mannerism were coming back.

No sticking, he reminded himself.

They sprung towards each other at the same time, Orca yelling in anger as she charged, Peter staying silent as he pounced, jumping up in the air, bringing his foot back for a spinning kick.

Reading his intention, the meta woman stopped in her tracks, feet skidding, digging into the stone. She raised her arms up just in time to block his foot. He hadn’t put all of his strength behind it, only about a fourth of it, and she took the blow without flinching, the impact rippling on the surface of her skin.

"That’s kinda cool." Peter informed her, pushing away from her arms before she could try to grab him.

He landed a few feet back and had to immediately duck to the ground to avoid a massive fist, shortly followed by a low kick, which he managed to dodge by leaping and rolling.

For a while, Orca kept attacking, forcing Peter to keep backing away, ducking and sidestepping her blows. Eventually, his back hit the side of the cage. He bit his lips. He would have to time this properly.

Seeing that he was backed against the metal bars, the killer-whale barked out a satisfied laugh and brought her left arm back, ready to put all of her strength into a single punch.

Oh boy. He definitely did not want to be hit by that.

His speed, thankfully, was much greater than hers and he threw himself down as her fist shot through the air. A loud clang, followed by creaking, sounded behind him. Orca howled.

Perfect. Now was the time to strike.

Staying low to the ground, Peter planted his palms on the stone and launched one of his feet to the woman’s stomach, now not bothering with holding his strength back.

His kick connected with a loud THWACK, making Orca grunt and bend over slightly. Her left hand was bruised and swollen, the bars she had accidentally hit were bent, several of them inches away from falling apart completely.

She had incredible strength and resilience but that was something he could use against her. He smiled. He was starting to figure her out. This kind of fight wasn’t so different than what he was used to!

Then, he felt something close on his foot, still buried in her chest. White hot pain blinded him, blades of fire crept up as-

Peter kicked Orca’s head with all of his might, making her release his foot before she could apply the full force of her bite to it. He groaned as it hit the stone with a wet thump, blood spilling onto the ground.

Well, now he understood what the winged meta felt when Croc started munching on him.

"Holy crap." He breathed out. "You’re not joking around."

He used his god legs and arms to push himself away from her and from the damaged iron bars, back towards the center of the cage. His injured foot was leaving droplets of blood behind as he stumbled backwards. Then, it started to itch.

His healing kicked in, faster than it had been during the Firefly fight, thanks to the regular meals he was now eating. The wounds would still take a few hours, perhaps days to completely disappear, but he should be able to use it -although with significant pain- in a couple of minutes.

"You’re a tough one, little shrimp." Orca sneered, holding her chest. Her face was starting to swell where Peter had jumped on her. The impact must have made her bite down on her own fangs as one of her teeth had fallen from her mouth, leaving a black, bloody gap behind.

With a roar, she shot towards the metal bar, grabbing them with both her good hand and her bad one and tugging.

"How is that allowed?!" Peter complained, watching in horror as she tore off a large portion of the cage’s walls, then dislodged a first metal bar, weighing it in her hand.

"Less talking, shrimp." She laughed. "More dodging!"

She threw the first of the bars at him. It tore through the air at amazing speeds and Peter barely had the time to jump to the side before it rammed into the ground, bits of rocks flying everywhere as it dug several inches into the ground.

Oh that was bad.

He thought quickly, ideas racing through his brain. He couldn’t jump up, that would only make him vulnerable to a second shot, and he didn’t have his webs to change direction mid-air. He had to stay low.

That would make him more vulnerable to Orca’s close quarter attacks, with how much larger than him she was, but it was better than to get impaled by a metal bar.

Speaking off.

Another rod was shot at him, forcing him to keep moving to the left as it was immediately followed by another one. How many of them did she grab from the wall?

Another throw later and he was getting dangerously close to the left end of the cage. Orca still had several rods in her hand, though, and she was getting ready to shoot again.

This is a stupid idea, his brain screamed at him as, impulsively, he started sprinting towards her, a half-baked plan forming in his mind.

Rarely did he let himself reach his full speed due to how damaging it could be for everything and everyone around him. His strength was only magnified by velocity, which could quickly become extremely dangerous. This time, though, he would have to do it if he wanted to survive this frankly foolish move.

Orca barked out a laugh and let go of another rod, obviously thinking she had goaded him into a trap. However, if he timed everything right, this should be the only one she would have the time to throw before…

Peter pushed down, a burst of pain punishing him for his foolishness as his injured foot protested. Ignoring it, he jumped, still going at full speed. His bleeding foot brushed the cold surface of the bar as he barely dodged it. The stone where he had been standing exploded as the weapon stabbed through it.

He was moving so fast that everything was a blur. The only thing he could see clearly was Orca, getting closer and closer every moment. She was moving in slow motion from his perspective, reaching down to grab another improvised weapon, still smirking. She wasn’t able to see how fast he was moving, her brain hadn’t processed the information yet.

Peter’s knee crashed right above her mouth into what served as her nose. He immediately followed it up with a punch to side of her face, keeping on digging it in even after the initial impact.

This time, the shock was too much for Orca’s skin to absorb, she was sent flying, slamming through the hole she had made into the wall, the broken ends of several bars digging into her back. She howled in pain.

Peter landed in a crouch, breath starting to speed up ever so slightly. This was a challenge, not a massacre. Better in every single way than the last fight he had been through.

"Fucking… brat…" Orca groaned, tearing herself away from the broken rods. Blood dripped down her back and shoulders, pooling at her feet. It looked darker than the usual human red, but flew out just as easily.

Peter shakily got to his feet, clenching his teeth as a spike of pain shot through his leg. His enhanced healing was struggling to keep up with his pace. He had to end this soon before his foot gave out.

He started backing up as Orca began moving forward, foam and blood dripping between her teeth. She prowled closer, hands clenching into fists then relaxing, over and over again.

She hunched her shoulder, preparing for a charge. Thankfully, Peter had backed away far enough to grab what he had been aiming for. He reached back, fingers closing against cool metal and, with one strong tug, pulled the rod out of the ground where it had stayed planted, ever since Orca threw it at him.

"Insolent pest." The woman cursed. "This stick won’t help you."

"Just watch me!" He shot back, clenching it in his hands, trying to stay steady on his feet. Pain was still coursing through his lower body, making it hard to focus.

His opponent picked up her pace, running towards him like a bull seeing red. He counted her steps in his head, trying to find the perfect moment to move away.

Her mouth opened, spit dripping and flying away as she kept getting faster and faster. She would be on him in less than a second.

She lunged at him, arms coming around his body to stop him from dodging, shoulders hunching to stop any jumping attempt. With no other choice, Peter swung the rod in between them, raising it parallel to the ground, in front of his face. Hopefully, it would hold.

Her teeth collided with it, biting down full force. He had to try and push her back, as, even if her teeth were now wrapped around the metal, she was still towering over him, attempting to push him to the ground, where she could stomp him out.

He groaned in pain, the weight too much for his injured leg, which was now shaking violently. He couldn’t hold this position, not with his foot in this state.

Struck by a flash of inspiration, Peter suddenly let go of the rod, leaping forward, towards the woman’s stomach.

Orca, not expecting this move, stumbled, falling right into his arms as he wrapped them around her body. He squeezed.

Then, heaving and panting, he lifted the squirming meta into the air. He went as far up as he could before slamming her body into the stone ground, damaging it even further. Several holes were spread around the arena, traces from this fight and the others that had come before.

Not wanting the woman to get back up, Peter bent down and swiped the bar that had saved his life, starting when he noticed that several glistening white teeth had stayed stuck to it, some of them cracked and shattered.

He shook his head, turning back to Orca. Painfully, he limped over to her head, kicking her down as she tried to get back up.

"Stay down." He warned her. "Or I hit you in the head."

Her only response was to shoot one of her large hands towards his legs, which he easily batted away with his improvised weapon. She then attempted to prop herself up and bite him but, before she could, he followed through with his threat.

The metal bit into her cheek with a thump that echoed throughout the arena, overpowering the crowd’s maddening cheers. She moaned in pain, crashing back to the ground and shaking violently.

Slowly, Peter put the end of the rod on her fin.

"Stay down." He repeated.

And she did.

For a moment, everything was silent, people taking in what had just happened. Then, as Peter stumbled away, dragging the bent metal bar with him, the room exploded into noise.

"THE PIZZA GUY DID IT AGAIN!!" The speakers yelled, over the frantic crowd. "HE DID IT AGAIN!!"

This felt a lot more like victory than the last fight he had been through, he thought gladly. He didn’t care for the cheers, but he did feel like he had earned the prize money.

He was starting to smile, excited about being finally able to work on the sewing part of his suits when his neck began itching.

Frowning, he followed his instincts and turned his head, raising his eyes towards the VIP lounge.

All chatter there had ceased.

In stark contrast to the rest of the audience, which was cheering and laughing, the crowd gathered in the alcove had fallen silent, somberly looking over towards the cage.

Most of them, he realized, were staring at him.

The itching heightened, turning into a full-blown tingling like he hadn’t felt since he arrived to Gotham.

Marco was right, he thought, this was a terrible idea.

Behind The Penguin, who was stroking his chin while observing him, the old man was still there, staring with just as much intensity as he had before.

This, he thought, is what prey must feel when it’s being hunted.

It was terrifying.

Chapter Text

They handed him the money inside of a small sports bag, the kind high schoolers used to carry around shoes or clothes for gym class. The contrast between the packaging and what he knew was inside of it made him want to laugh.

He didn’t. Several of the rogues in the VIP section were still staring at him, he could feel it. It was less than before, since the fighting had resumed, but it was enough to make him uncomfortable. That was way too much unwanted attention from exactly the kind of people he had been raised to avoid.

As soon as the cash changed hands, Ivy dragged him out, making him wince. His foot hadn’t healed fully. It would probably take a couple days for it to be back to its normal state, and a bit less than that before the pain faded.

Peter groaned, dirty water splashing against the holes in his shoes as they exited the arena, gazes still burning the back of his neck. With the amount of bacteria in the sewers, he would have to be lucky not to get an infection. That would delay his recovery by maybe a day, hopefully not more.

Maybe eating a more diverse diet could help. He did know food was an important part of getting energy but he wasn’t well versed in dietetics or what kind of food he should prioritize. May had been the one grocery shopping, back home.

He fell into a tired, robotic walking rhythm until his dazedness was broken by a voice. He tried to focus back on his surroundings.

"You have two weeks." Ivy told him, jumping the ladder leading to the outer area of the sewers. Vines grew out of her dress, roots like thousands of insect legs, carrying her through the air. All pretense of being an ordinary human was gone.

Peter used his good leg to jump after her, easily keeping his balance as he landed on one foot, the money on his back and the plant box clutched in his hands.

"Two weeks." He repeated, adrenaline still pumping in his veins, making it hard to focus on the conversation.

It was odd not to try and hide his abilities but Ivy clearly did not care about showing off her meta status. As long as he didn’t give off that he had any other powers than the two he had shown -strength and speed-, he had no reason not to follow her lead.

It was nice, talking to someone else with superpowers, even if she was a dangerous criminal dragging him into even more of a mess than what he had landed himself into in the first place. He had missed it.

Of course, nothing could beat meeting his alternate selves. Their powers had been similar yet different in some tiny, interesting ways. He was still amazed that his oldest self could produce his own webbing.

The amount of food needed for that…

His foot twinged, burning in the grimy water, bringing him back to the present. Ivy had already started walking towards the exit, plants retreating into her dress.

"Two weeks is the time you have to recover."

He started, remembering that nobody here knew about his enhanced healing. That was one ability he would have to keep secret, alongside his more spider-like characteristics.

"Alright." He nodded, trying to keep his face even. Lying was not one of his strong suits but, hopefully, she would mistake his behavior for apprehension.

"Good. You learn fast, little boy." She smirked, eyes sparkling. He had seen her relax slightly, once he handed her the money. For some reason, Harley was in a situation where this kind of cash was important, that was the only reason he could see behind her reaction.

With her powers, she could easily make money herself, and probably was. She didn’t want him to say Harley’s name next to other criminals…

Maybe she didn’t want to be associated with her? Or maybe the person Harley was hiding from was skilled enough to track her location from only a few details.

That was a slightly chilling prospect. Ivy herself appeared to take this seriously, which meant that whoever it was must be particularly dangerous. She was one of the most powerful metas he had met in this universe, could this mystery person be stronger than her?

He felt like he was missing something, a strange feeling down in his stomach. His leg still hurt, cramping periodically. He tried to ignore it, but it was hard to keep from grimacing.

Good, the more he could sell that his body didn’t heal any faster than anyone else’s, the safer he was. Between his ability to hold his breath for a dozen minutes and his healing, he knew that it would be easy for him to fake his death, in case of an emergency during a fight.

He had to keep that as a last resort, though, and make sure whoever he was facing then couldn’t take his pulse.

His mind kept wandering away from the cold reality around him, mostly because he was trying to avoid thinking about the state of his foot and how he would have to peel his shoes off of the skin later.

Ivy didn’t seem particularly interested in talking to him, though. They walked the rest of the way in silence. The wind, hurling into the tunnels louder now that they were getting closer to the docks, would have covered most sounds anyway.

But then, maybe she was just like him, and would have been able to hear despite it. Either way, he didn’t want it to be known that several of his senses were enhanced. That would definitely make people more wary of him, especially during deliveries.

Before they could step out, Peter stopped, shuffling uneasily.

Ivy raised an eyebrow at him, foot tapping on the icy ground impatiently.

"I… uh… will wait until you’re gone."

She shrugged and, thankfully, must be very eager to get away from the sewers since she didn’t argue, walking out and leaving him behind. Not ending the night by getting choked by poisonous pollen was a win in Peter’s eyes so he took the time to wait an extra few minutes, making sure he wouldn’t come out too early.

The night was dark when he eventually followed her but the blizzard had thankfully stopped. Snow covered the stairs in a thick blanket, rising above his ankles when he stepped up on them. It made it extremely easy to see, moonlight reflecting off of the white streets, lighting up the docks. There weren’t many buildings to hide the sky, in this part of Gotham.

He snuggled the little plant box tightly against his chest, under his hoodie. It was cold still, he didn’t want it to suffer from the temperature shock, especially now that Ivy was gone.

It took him much longer than it usually would to get back to his apartment, his body protesting every few feet, pleading with him to take a break and sit down. He couldn’t, not in this weather, nor with damaged shoes and no coat. He endured the discomfort, finally reaching his building after two hours of limping and cursing under his breath.

He really hoped a good night-or rather morning- of sleep would deal with most of the damage. If it still wasn’t enough, maybe he should invest in some more food. He had so much money now…

Dragging himself up the stairs, he pushed open his door, letting the bag of money drop next to his bed as he triple locked the room. He settled his new plant on his desk, under the window to make sure it would get as much sun as possible. He would need to research how to take good care of it once he got access to the Internet. He cleared the area around it, not wanting any tool to fall on it.

A short, cold shower was all he could manage before collapsing on his mattress, shivering under the thin blanket.

It had been hard but he had managed to get his hands on a significant sum of cash. Hopefully, it would make his life easier now.

Peter fell into a deep, dreamless sleep, the first one since his aunt died.

Maybe he could make things work out in the end.

 

oOo

 

He woke up later than he usually did, his body needing more sleep than usual to recover from the wounds. Thankfully, when he sat up and looked down at his legs, the only marks left from the previous night’s fight were a series of scars, going up to his ankles, pink and tender.

They were extremely itchy. He would have to live with it. He would also have to make sure no one present during the fight saw him-

Ah.

His job.

He was going to have to run and jump for his job. The only thing he could hope for was that no one he was delivering to had witnessed the confrontation between him and Orca. Unfortunately, that seemed unlikely. About half of his orders went directly to various street level criminals, sometimes higher ranked.

He would have to be especially lucky to avoid suspicion.

Needless to say, it was hopeless.

Well maybe people wouldn’t jump to conclusions right away. He had no way around risking it unfortunately, he needed the apartment. He didn’t know how much rent was in Gotham but he was aware of the fact that, while three thousand dollars was a huge sum of money for him, it would only be good for a few months of rent at full price at most… And he still did not have an I.D.

Then, maybe living here was less expensive than what living in New York City had cost his aunt. Both cities seemed prone to villain attacks but Gotham had a distinctively more dangerous atmosphere.

Peter shook his head, raising to his feet and stretching. Now was not the time for speculation.

Now was the time to get himself a computer.

He felt so excited at the idea that he had a hard time standing still in the shower and was practically bouncing up to the ceiling as he got dressed. Peter loved computer stuff. He wasn’t as good or knowledgeable as Ned, of course, but he had learned several programming languages alongside him, with his help most of the time too.

He had helped his friend build his first computer, that had always been something that they had fun doing together.

Now, Ned didn’t remember who he was and Peter had no way of seeing him ever again. He’d have to build up from what he knew and…

Well maybe, somewhere across the multiverse, Ned and MJ would be tinkering with something too, at the same time as he was. That thought made him smile.

He practically ran down the stairs, heart pounding with excitement. The sports bag, now with all of his money in it, bounced against his back with every step. It was so full. He couldn’t believe he was casually walking around with this small fortune on himself.

He didn’t fear being jumped, though. Word had spread a few days after he moved in that he shouldn’t be messed with. His clothes, old and scuffed, blended in well with what the locals were wearing. If he didn’t speak, it was easy to assume he was from Gotham.

The Bowery’s limitless supply of shady pawn shops did not disappoint, once again. Laptops were often among the most stolen items on any given campus or in any big city. Not only could they be sold for a large sum of cash, but they were pretty easy to grab.

They were also worth it to sell, even if they weren’t stolen, so a lot of families moving in to this district might get rid of theirs in order to spend money on more urgent needs. Food and shelter were more important than having access to the internet, he knew that very well.

Nobody blinked when he stepped into one of the largest stores of the area. Guarded by two men wearing sweatshirts and hiding firearms in a holster under their baggy pants, it was one Peter had been to often. It was there that he had found his chemical kit.

Compared to many downtown shops, this one was tiny. For the Bowery, however, it was huge. Several rooms of clothing spread across the ground floor while most of the technology and appliances were relegated to the basement, which was more tightly watched.

In between the two, games, musical instruments and anything worth selling were displayed, some items in better state than others.

He didn’t care. He was already on his way to the basement, not stopping to browse the video games like he would have a few months ago. Of course, he missed spending time playing but he didn’t have anything to even run those programs on. Games could wait until after he was settled down in this world.

A teenage girl, holding a baseball bat in her left hand and swiping through her phone with her right, greeted him with a warning glare. This was supposedly the most secure part of the store, she likely wouldn’t hesitate to hit him over the head if she thought he was here to steal.

He smiled awkwardly at her, shuffling past her chair to reach the rows of various tech appliances and furniture. Radios, televisions, cameras, no computer so far…

Peter walked past an older gentleman, dressed quite oddly for the Bowery with an expensive looking coat and perfectly trimmed hair, who was busy looking over the many turntables on display. The man nodded politely at him as he walked past, then resumed his search.

Besides him, the store was almost empty. It was Christmas morning after all, most people with a family would be spending it at home with their loved ones.

Turning into another aisle, Peter sighed when he noticed it, once again, was not one with computers in it. The shelves were full of kitchen appliances, from a simple toaster to a full oven.

He was about to turn away and keep on looking for a computer when he hesitated.

There were several small fridges at the end of the aisle, most of them barely reaching up to his waist. They were tiny but that probably meant they were also cheaper.

If he had a small fridge, it wouldn’t be that much of an investment that he would be at a loss if he lost his apartment and had to dump it. It would, however, allow him to buy many more things than ramen and rice.

His mouth started watering as he thought about meat, vegetables and …

Milk!

He loved milk. Especially with chocolate.

It would even help him as a vigilante. He had been recently thinking of trying to switch to a better diet to give his powers more energy to work with. If he could store ingredients safely, that would leave him so many more-

Oh and they had a tiny oven too.

Having so much money made so many things he would have considered absolutely out of the realm of possibilities a few days ago now completely possible.

The oven, as small as a microwave, was only 30$. The fridges went from 40 to 200$. He grabbed one of the cheaper ones, a bit less than 60$. It was absolutely tiny, stopping at his knee, but…

An oven and a fridge. Even if they didn’t work fully, he was confident in his ability to fix them up and, if they did work, then everything was perfect!

Realizing he probably shouldn’t be walking around carrying a small fridge with only one hand if he didn’t want to attract attention, he made a show of hoisting it up the stairs. He saw the old man ahead of him, a beautiful turntable in his hands. He was happy that the stranger had found what he was looking for.

"Can I keep this here?" He asked the shopkeeper, a pregnant woman with clips in her hair and a riffle on her back. "I have more stuff I wanna get downstairs."

"’s long as you have the cash for it." She answered. She wasn’t the same person than the one he had bought the chem kit from. Not that much of a surprise, considering the size of the store.

Peter nodded enthusiastically and jogged back downstairs, grabbing the small oven. This one, he didn’t have to pretend was too heavy for him. He kept it under his arm as he wandered around, trying to find what he had come to get in the first place.

He found it in a side room, at the very back of the basement. Another girl was sitting next to the open door leading into it, a revolver on display on her lap, safety off.

People had such terrible firearm habits in this city.

"Can I go in?" He asked, pointing at the rows of laptops and phones he could see on the inside.

She nodded silently, looking at him up and down with narrowed eyes. He didn’t push his luck with her, hurrying past her chair.

This last room was a lot smaller than every other one in the store. Dimly lit by colorful LED strips on the wall, it had a few rows of metal shelves in its center, and several glass cases on its walls. Most of it was filled with electronics, specifically phones and computers.

He immediately started looking through them, trying to figure out what he wanted to get. Several brands he could recognize as  being the same as the ones he knew back home, but some others -like the Lexbook- were completely foreign to him.

He decided to get something he knew, so that he wouldn’t get any surprises. If the computer he happened to grab was stolen, he might have to wipe it completely and reinstall an operating system to avoid it getting bricked. He also had to think about getting a charger with it.

That left him with a lot less options, several of which cost way too much for him. He was looking to spend a few hundred dollars, not a few thousands. Some of the tech here was extremely high quality…

Surprising, for a pawn store.

Peter eventually settled on a 400$ Asus laptop, sleek and black, its casing in good shape. He had experience working with this kind of computer before and, hopefully, it would translate in being able to learn how to use this one faster.

Thankfully, the laptop came with its own cable and case. Satisfied with his choice, he grabbed them, sent a mournful look at the phones, and made his way upstairs, arms full with his purchases.

"You gonna be able to carry all that home?" The shopkeeper asked him as he counted the bills he owed her.

"Uh… yeah. I’ll just put everything in the fridge."

She stared at him, obviously wondering where he would get the strength to lift everything. The fridge was barely big enough to fit the computer and the oven in it, sure, but it was still quite heavy and, added to the rest, Peter would have to carry around a hundred pounds of appliances back to his apartment.

That was nothing to him but he couldn’t really let that be known. Instead, he flashed a bright smile and handed over the money, trying to look as innocent as he could.

"I’ll manage don’t worry!"

Before he could get another dubious look, Peter lifted up the small fridge, pretending to need both of his hands to carry it. He made sure his pace was slow as he exited the store then, as soon as he was out of view, he sped up. He couldn’t wait to get home and start tinkering!

He was so excited he barely felt the cold as he half walked half ran through the snow. He wanted to have as much time as possible before his shift, and it was already past one! He had to be fast.

After making sure no one was able to see him, Peter ran up the stairs to his apartment, fridge as light as air in his arms. He opened his door up, stepped inside, closed it behind him.

He couldn’t stop smiling. He still had so much money left! Thanks to the fight he was able to afford so much, this was awesome.

He set down the fridge opposite to his bed, opening it up before plugging it, taking out the oven and the computer. He would have to find something to put them on other than his desk, which was covered in a few layers of clutter.

For now, he would have to settle with the ground. He plugged both of the appliances in, not turning them on quite yet, almost jumping up and down when they lit up immediately. No need to fix them up yet.

Of course, the laptop didn’t turn on right away when he flipped it open. He had to walk around his room to find another plug, making a mental note to try and grab an extender next time he was at a convenient store.

As he waited for the computer to charge, Peter thought about all the food he would now be able to make. Maybe he should get some plates and cutlery? And a pan or maybe some sheets to put in his oven… He was going to be able to eat tasty food everyday!

His mouth watered at the thought. Chicken and pork. Fish and vegetables. Pasta and cheese. Lasagna!

His stomach growled but he ignored it, focusing instead on the screen in front of him, which had switched on. Blessedly, it seemed like the computer had either not been stolen or had not been bricked by its previous owner. It worked perfectly, with many of the files and programs still installed on the desktop, which featured a stylized picture of a cat as background.

"Time for a wipe." Peter whispered to himself, rubbing his hands together in anticipation. This would take some time but not enough to have him waste his entire afternoon waiting. He had so much work to do!

After starting the deletion of every piece of data outside of the OS, Peter left the computer open and charging on his mattress. He turned on his radio, listening to the now familiar advertisements as he rolled out his work-tarp.

Scrapping the Iron-Spider would be a good way to spend the time waiting for the laptop to complete the wipe. He needed to get the data logs next to the head anyway, to check which parts had been damaged, what programs he would have to rewrite.

"Welcoooome Gotham! Vesper here today, covering for our dear friend Vicki! Some of you may already know me from my daily podcast: What’s Up Today? Where we talk about all the most important Gotham news along with some very exclusive interviews!

If you don’t know me, don’t worry listener, by the end of the next few weeks, we will be very well acquainted!"

The laptop was only 10% done with its task, which gave Peter plenty of time to extract sensitive parts from the suit. He crouched down next to the shoulders, or what was left of them.

With a sigh, he picked up his scissors and started cutting off the burned, melted edge of the rips in the Iron-Spider. Fire had damaged it severely, ruining a lot of its technology.

"Some financial news first, boo, I know. LexTech stocks falling slightly as local billionaire and philanthropist, Bruce Wayne, announced this morning they would be releasing their brand new phone, the M-Direct this January.

It’s the first phone ever released by the company but, from their press release, they have announced that durability and toughness was one of their primary goals when making it.

Many of you may also not know it but the phone is named after Mr Wayne’s mother, which is why you might see it referred to as "Martha"! Some citizens are unhappy with the name, an online poll is already set up to get it changed to… drumroll… the Batphone! Yes, very Gotham, isn’t it? But it will be the first smartphone produced in Gotham by Gotham for Gotham in almost six years!
What do you think listener? Batphone or M-direct? Make sure to let us know on our official Twitter page!"

Peter wished he still had social media, he really liked to post skyline pictures on his Spider-Man account. Maybe, once he had a phone again, he could start doing it. It had helped his image a lot, and it also allowed him to interact with civilians outside of emergencies.

He was done trimming the damaged edges, which left him having to grab his anti static strap and tweezers. Dislodging the chips he knew contained data was going to be a delicate business. Even scraping them could ruin some of the information contained there, and he didn’t even have a clue about what it was.

The AI systems might have survived, or the strings, or the sensors… he really had no idea. Other than the AI, he was fairly confident he could replicate most of the coding for the other systems, as long as he had a lot of time to do so. Then, he could connect them to the various technologies he had already extracted and automate parts of the suits again.

His first would be a basic one, but he needed an air filtering one as well as a sneak one on top of it. Something to protect against fire would also be useful, if he could manage to find some materials for it.

Really, getting materials would not be that hard once he settled on what he wanted. He of course would be including some of the Iron-Spider in every suit, which meant they would all have some amount of metal in them but…

Should he go with something like Spandex for flexibility or maybe something like Kevlar for more protection? Maybe he could layer it or… have different parts use different materials?

He missed his first suit, and the fabric Tony had developed to make it so resistant. It had originally been done with the Hulk in mind but it had worked wonders for him.

"Now for the headline of today! Riddler behind bars! The criminal mastermind we all know and hate has been arrested during a combined intervention between the GCPD and the Bat-Clan.

No death was reported but it is noted that several officers were injured during the confrontation. Riddler is currently being transferred to Arkham Asylum as we speak! We can all rest a bit easier tonight knowing that there is one less murderous maniac out in the streets tonight."

Peter started. He remembered reading about the Riddler, and also knew he had been on the run recently. Looked like the police finally caught up to him and sent him behind bars. Maybe now that the man had been stopped, they would dedicate more time to keeping the streets safe.

Surely the Joker couldn’t be that much of a drain on their resources.

He spent another thirty minutes listening to the radio explaining the current state of the Gotham sports teams -which were apparently doing terrible this season- before his computer’s screen turned black then lit up again, indicating that it was ready to be worked on.

He had four hours before his shift started. He was going to make it count.

Peter carefully put the Iron-Spider away, storing the small parts he had gotten into one of his many plastic boxes. All of them were tiny but made in a way that they could be plugged into a micro-port, which some computers had to read SIM cards and other tiny chips. This one, blessedly, had several.

He plugged it in, grimacing when his laptop told him the chip was unreadable. Of course, it wouldn’t be this easy. The program used in the Iron Spider was protected with several layers of code that made sure only certified Stark Tech could read and edit it. Tony had been extremely paranoid about people stealing his tech for as long as Peter had known him.

That meant he would have to program an interface for the Stark data to be able to communicate with his lowly Asus computer. He had no idea where to start.

With a sigh, he tried to turn to the internet for some leads, only to be hit with a reality he had somehow forgot about earlier.

He didn’t have Internet.

Of course he didn’t have any connection! He didn’t even have a wifi box in his apartment, and his landlady had never mentioned helping him set up an Internet line. He was such an idiot not to have thought about this before.

He briefly lamented his entire existence, staring forlornly at the dinosaur on his screen, which was helpfully informing him there was no network available. After glaring at the poor thing for a dozen minutes, he eventually stood up, shoulders sagging.

There went his afternoon of coding and ordering materials. He was going to have to go out again.

Well at least he would be able to get some pre-payed cards while he was in town, since he didn’t think he’d be able to get what he wanted in the Bowery. With those, he’d be able to order things to deliv-

Ah. Yes. People didn’t deliver in this part of Gotham. People other than Marco’s of course.

Then he would have to use a pick-up point, at least if he couldn’t find a store that carried the materials he needed.

He felt like this town was fighting with him, trying to make his life more complicated. He had no choice but to adapt, though, so he headed to Old Gotham and its shimmering Christmas lights. Despite the holidays, many stores were still open there and, as he left the Bowery, he could see groups of people walking on the streets, together.

Of course, not everyone celebrated Christmas. He didn’t this year, and he wasn’t the only one, whether for cultural, religious or other personal reasons. He felt a bit less lonely as he joined the small crowd heading into a shopping gallery.

He couldn’t help himself this time around and splurged on a jacket made of light brown thick fabric with a double layer of fluff to protect from the cold on the inside. He felt a bit guilty to spend his prize money on something so selfish but he didn’t want to keep on walking around without a coat and cause people to wonder how it was that he never got sick despite it.

New shoes eventually followed, sturdy leather work boots that would likely last him a decade. Uncle Ben used to have a pair just like this one, which made it impossible to ignore when he walked past it after getting his jacket. He felt warm and nostalgic as he finally made his way to the phone store, protected from the elements at last.

He had just spent so much on frivolous belongings, yet he had many more dollar bills in his pockets. It felt surreal.

Deep down, he remembered how stressful the previous night had been, how terrifying the gazes from the rogues felt but his excitement drowned out his worry. Finally, he didn’t feel like he was struggling to keep his head out of the water.

Being a meta was truly a blessing, maybe that was where all of his luck went.

Then, being a meta had also caused him to lose quite a lot.

At the store, he easily found what he was looking for. Like New York City, Gotham had a lot of blank network areas, which meant that boxes using the phone network to hotspot for a computer or a television were common there. He easily found a box connected to the 4G network, and payed six months of subscription upfront, for a couple more hundred dollars.

It wasn’t cheap but it was necessary for him.

Stuffing his purchase in the large pockets of his brand new jacket, he stepped out once again, smiling as the wind crashed on the thick fabric he was wearing, barely making him shiver.

This was nice, he was feeling good.

Instead of running home and starting to work on his computer right away, Peter walked around the neighborhood, watching the civilians go about their daily lives. He even got himself a hotdog and a little bag of fries at a stand. He might be alone but he still deserved to treat himself for Christmas. He watched couples and families ice skate on an outside rink, wishing he could join them.

Eventually, though, it was time for him to head to work and he barely got to drop off his Internet box at his apartment before having to jump on the roof and run out. Night was falling and snow was back in the air, flakes getting stuck in his hair as he jumped across gaps and over chimneys.

He made it to Marco’s in records time. His work boots had soles good enough to crunch the ice under him, keeping him from slipping. It was a welcome change from his old used sneakers, and one he was very happy about. Even if it was a selfish investment, it had been a good one.

He was about to climb down the building in front of the pizzeria and head inside when he noticed something unusual. The front of the restaurant, which was usually clear of any vehicles or human presence was occupied by something.

A large black motorcycle stood there, parked in front and held to the ground and the walls with several thick chains, which was likely necessary in Gotham to stop it from getting stolen. Peter wasn’t very knowledgeable in bikes but even he could tell that this one was very well cared for. Its surface was shining, free of dirt and grime as if it had just been polished. A fresh coat of paint had been applied to it, he could smell it, strong over the scents of the city and the snow.

Did Marco park this here? No, he was too injured to drive a motorcycle, he could barely walk for more than a few minutes, then who…

Oh.

Of course! The new driver.

Peter gulped, intimidated. This new person was a lot cooler than he was, and probably more experienced too. He had to run around to deliver his pizza and here they came with a gorgeous vehicle. Not only did they have their license, they knew enough about bikes to keep it in that state.

Because the wheels smelled worn, to Peter, and he could tell there was history to the engine from what he could see of it. Stains the owner hadn’t gotten to yet under the bulk of the bike. It was hard to tell with how polished the thing was, but it had been used a lot.

Feeling incredibly anxious now, somehow more than he had before the fight with Orca, he put his hands in his pockets, took a deep breath…

Then took his hands out and used them to climb down the building. He landed on the snow with a soft puff, flakes sticking to his brand new boots.

Thankfully, they were waterproof.

Heart racing, Peter pushed the door of the pizzeria open. There, sitting at his usual table, was Marco. In front of him, sitting sideways to see both the back door and the front door, was a young man. He was barely older than him, with no lines on his face and not even the start of a beard, but he looked like an adult in ways that he himself never felt like he did.

The teen had jet black hair with a white streak in the middle which, surprisingly, did not smell dyed to Peter. His skin had a slight tan and, even though he was sitting, he was clearly much, much taller than him. The Marco’s hoodie he was wearing under his hard leather jacket did not hide at all how muscular he was, almost on par with Captain America or Thor at his prime.

Alright, so this was the kind of driver Marco would usually hire. Someone who would have survived the gangs but for some reason did not want to work for them. Someone from Gotham. It made sense now, that his boss thought he wouldn’t make it past an hour out at night if this was his standard.

Not only was the new driver built better than many of the thugs he had seen around Crime Alley at night, but he was also carrying several guns, all of them loaded. From the smell, Peter detected at least four on himself, including one hidden in his left boot, and at least five more inside of his bike, as well as explosives.

A-alright.

Maybe Marco’s was more into helping former gang members out of the underworld than lifting up random street kids, then. Or maybe it was not that unusual in Gotham to have so many weapons? The bike and the guns did look expensive, why would someone who could afford that work as a pizza delivery boy?

His heart was racing even faster now, as his mind went through the options. Time had slowed around him, or rather he was allowing himself to perceive it as he usually would, without slowing himself down. The humans, in comparison, seemed like they were sloths, each of their breath dragging on forever, each twitch of their muscles stretching for an eternity.

He rarely allowed himself to do this, it was a bad habit to take when out of the mask. Spider-Man could afford to think unnaturally fast, lift weights and move at a speed that humans could never hope to achieve. Using his powers as himself was making him slip in his civilian identity.

He chastised himself and tried his best to slow his perception down to a normal level. It was hard to quiet everything down but he had a lot of practice and, eventually, time trickled out again, seconds falling back into place.

"Ah, this is your senior coworker…" Marco was saying, pointing at Peter, of all things.

It made the teen cringe. This dude had at least three inches and probably sixty or eighty pounds on him. He was also clearly older, being called his senior really did not feel right.

"… Peter." His boss finished, not aware of his silent suffering. His new coworker was looking at him intently, somehow not scoffing at the fact that he, Peter Parker, was being called his senior. His eyes were a vivid green, almost as bright as Ivy’s had been.

Oh god was this guy also a plant muta-meta?

No, he couldn’t hear, smell or feel anything unusual in his heartbeat, sweat, blood or breathing pattern. According to the book he had started to read, metas were unusual, powerful ones were even rarer. The likelihood of two metas working at the same pizza place would be almost as low as the one of two vigilantes working at the same pizza place.

Especially when said place only had three employees, and one of them was the boss.

Ah damn, he was doing it again. He had to focus on slowing himself down, stop his thoughts from racing out of control like this.

"Peter." Marco was saying, extremely slowly from his perspective, then more normally once he calmed himself back to a human rhythm. "This is Jason, the new driver."

"Nice to meet you." Jason nodded politely, eyes still burning into his, like he was trying to read his thoughts-oh god was he a tele-don’t think about it.

"Yeah- Nice to- uh nice to meet you uh… man." He cringed at the last part, gritting his teeth. Socializing with a cool older guy should not be this hard.

Jason probably drank beers with his friends, he would never want to hang out with someone like Peter. He totally looked like the kind of guy who would go out with a giant crowd of people. He even had a leather jacket. Maybe he had biker friends.

Peter had never had biker friends. Peter had nerd friends. Peter was a nerd.

His dreams of making friend with his new neighbor evaporated instantly, then he realized the guy probably wouldn’t even be his neighbor because he had an amazing bike and ten guns and a great leather jacket and he probably went out and drank beer with his friends.

Calm down, Parker.

He was the senior coworker. He had to act cool, too.

Jason raised an eyebrow at his greetings, his top lip rising slightly. Micro-expressions. He could see them but had never really taught himself to read them. He hadn’t needed it, when he had MJ to analyze people for him.

He would have to learn. That and so many other things.

He slowed his perception down, again. This was always so tedious. At least he wasn’t slipping up with his other abilities, although he knew that was now a risk since he was allowing Peter Parker and superpowers to mix.

Mentally, it was messing with the neat little boxes he had put his civilian identity and his vigilante one in. No powers without a mask, that had been the rule, it had eventually become a reflex, just like breathing.

And now he had gone against it. Just like when he remembered he was controlling his breathing, it would take him a while to fall into the habit and be able to do it unconsciously. Until then, he would have to keep on reminding himself to do it.

"I want you guys to work together for a while."

Peter started. Was he supposed to teach the new guy free running or- maybe he just meant-

Marco looked down pointedly, eyes digging into Peter’s foot. An instant after, he was back to his usual posture. His expression, bored annoyance, hadn’t changed all along but a twitch in Jason’s right eyebrow showed he had noticed the silent exchange.

The guy was perceptive, on top of being built like a professional boxer. But that was barely more than a passing concern as suddenly, Peter realized that Marco knew about the fight, enough to have heard about his injury.

He was even more well connected that he had thought. All of the people in the arena the previous night were higher ranked than streets thugs. Whoever his informant, or informants, were, they were quite high ranked.

"Peter, people know who you are and won’t shoot you on sight. Can’t say the same for you Jason, ‘specially with the bike."

"That’s why I have the guns." The older teen piped in, twirling one of his two visible firearms on his index finger. His voice was pure Gotham, which made Peter think once again that everyone from this city had terrible gun safety issues.

Who taught these people how to shoot? Before he event got to learn during his training course-not that he would ever use the knowledge, he did not need guns nor want them- the Avengers had taught him how to behave around a firearm.

They said it might be necessary to learn one day, May didn’t agree but, since Ben had always wanted to teach him how to shoot, he had decided to listen. He had sworn off firearms, though.

Everyone in Gotham loved to carry guns so he couldn’t blame someone born there and raised in that culture for owning them. Not everyone was a meta. Not everyone would be able to punch Firefly down.

For many civilians, the only way to take Firefly on would be with a firearm, a vehicle or a very potent trap. A lot of people only had the budget or the time for the first.

"Stop twirling those." Marco snapped. "Not inside the store."

Jason wrinkled his nose in annoyance but complied, which made their boss relax. The rules were set and he was alright with them. Not into the store did make sense, but never twirling charged guns with the safety off should not be limited to a single place.

Gotham was incredibly dangerous, not just because of its villains but because of the way its residents acted.

"Peter, you’ll be introducing Jason around town. Current climate being that way, it’s needed. Jason, you’ll be driving the two of you.”

"Do we have to split pay?" The young man asked, now twirling a combat knife, which he had fetched from an inside pocket in his jacket. This was apparently not an issue for Marco, who ignored it and replied flatly:

"No. I can cover it."

That made Peter frown. He would be able to keep paying them the same, despite them delivering together? Even if the motorcycle was faster, they would both be delivering at the same time, so it still scaled up…

Either Marco was making a huge margin on the pizza, enough to keep the place running and them payed, he was operating at a loss or he was getting income from another source.

That was a bit intimidating, considering the kind of place Gotham was. Maybe he was getting some kind of insurance payout for his leg… but then insurance in this city couldn’t be that much considering how dangerous it was to live there.

"Alright." Jason nodded, standing up and stretching, apparently satisfied with the answer. "Let’s go then. You can cover me when I drive." He nodded at Peter.

"Uh…"

"He doesn’t shoot." Marco sighed.

Jason looked at him slightly incredulously.

"You don’t?"

"I can’t drive either." Peter blushed, feeling extremely inadequate.

His coworker shook his head. "Wouldn’t let you drive anyway, but…" He laughed sharply, sounding bitter. "Everywhere I go I’m followed by pacifists."

"I’m not a pacifist." Peter frowned. "I just don’t need a gun."

Instead of a rebuke, his reply got him a sudden heavy silence. The implication, one he hasn’t intended to make aloud, hung in the air.

"I see." Jason said, narrowing his eyes. "Narrows?"

He shook his head. "New York." He replied with a sigh.

His coworker hummed in answer, not probing any further. Peter still felt like he had been instantly figured out. But such an innocent comment wasn’t an admission of anything, at least not in his eyes.

"Stop blabbing." Marco cut in, snapping his fingers at them. "More working. Peter get the GPS, Jason get the pizza."

The younger teen obeyed immediately but saw the older boy bristle slightly at their boss’ tone. He didn’t like authority that much, it seemed. Why was this kind of person working at a pizza restaurant?

Was this truly the kind of people Marco usually hired? The adult was watching them move around with an unreadable expression, arms crossed.

Before the two of them could leave, their boss stopped them, calling Peter forward. He gulped audibly, hoping he wasn’t about to get fired now that a more competent, non meta driver was there. Instead, Marco grabbed his wrist and tugged him closer, whispering:

"Don’t let them know you can heal."

"-How do you know?"

His boss raised an eyebrow and he remembered the man knew about Firefly. It had taken him a few days to recover from the injuries, mostly due to his poor diet at the time. Despite being slow for him, it was months faster than it would have taken for a regular human.

He was let go shortly after, stumbling after the older boy, who was busy unlocking the chains holding his vehicle down.

They eventually switched loads, Jason holding the GPS with a dubious look on his face and Peter putting on the back pack. The bike was large enough for both of them to sit on it without touching each other, which he was very glad about, mostly because of the guns he knew the older teen was carrying.

"You’re gonna fall." Jason warned him when Peter scooted back on the bike, sitting straight with his hands flat down its side. "You have to grab something."

"I’ll be fine." He replied, sticking his palms and fingers to the smooth motorcycle surface.

His coworker shrugged, not arguing with him and, obviously expecting him to lose balance right away, he started his bike up, going slowly.

Peter stayed relaxed, easily keeping his balance.

"Suppose you don’t need a helmet?" Jason said, stopping the motorcycle after a few feet of slow riding. He probably intended to show him it wasn’t this easy to keep his balance while sitting this way, but didn’t try to talk it out with him. He liked action more than words, then.

"I’ll be fine without one." Peter replied.

Despite his terrible gun practices, Jason appeared to at least be a safe driver as he slipped a sleek black helmet, also freshly re-painted, on his head. The smell would be barely noticeable for a human, the work was of high quality, but to him it was obvious.

The next time the motorcycle started up, it was with a loud roar, the engine fully awakened. Peter tightened his abdominal muscles, trying not to apply too much pressure with his hands, to keep from damaging the vehicle. It was easy to stay still though, the wind wasn’t stronger than he was and he could go faster than this bike simply by running.

That was a dangerous thought to have as Peter Parker, especially around strangers with guns.

Jason tore through the streets with ease, not bothered by the ice and the snow, twisting between cars and passerby. This was definitely not the right or safe way to drive but, in this side of Gotham, nobody really seemed to care.

Their first delivery was to the Bowery, a familiar place for Peter. The motorcycle slowed down significantly as they got closer to their delivery point, before stopping entirely.

"Okay." Jason told him. "You go ahead."

He blinked, confused.

"Wait… why me?"

"Because they know you." The older boy sighed, sounding like he thought this should have been an obvious answer. "If I just show up on a motorcycle, they’ll shoot."

"Will they really?"

"Yes." Jason nodded. Despite the impatience in his tone, he still took the time to explain the situation to him, which Peter appreciated. He had never been shot at while delivering, but he looked a lot less intimidating than a six foot tall man on a giant bike.

All things considered, maybe he was lucky to be relatively short. This way, people weren’t scared into shooting before talking.

He unstuck his hands from the bike and jumped off smoothly, stretching his arms, the pizza bag warm on his back. Jason was looking at him, eyes sometimes flickering downwards.

Right.

Peter pretended to wince, hoping he did a good job of it before asking, hands shoved in his jacket’s pockets to shield them from the cold:

"What should I tell them?"

Jason sighed long sufferingly but answered: "Tell them you’ve got a new coworker and Marco sent you with him. I got the shirt, he said it should be good." After a brief pause, he added: "Tell them I’m coming on a bike."

"Ok." He nodded, trying to calm his nerves. Having company during his deliveries was very unusual.

Jason watched him as he walked towards the drop-off point, his gaze burning into the back of his neck.

Peter couldn’t help but feel a bit disappointed. The guy was really cool, way too cool for him. He knew how to get around in Gotham, unlike him. He had money, he was actually an adult.

Even though he was a vigilante and a meta, next to Jason, he felt like he was back in high school, looking at the popular kids’ table. It was stupid, because high school was long gone and he was already supposed to be going to college.

He stepped in the small alleyway the GPS was leading them to. There, standing around a small barrel fire, were a group of men, wearing the two toned uniforms Peter had seen around the city. There had been more of them gathering recently, more gang activity in general.

They seemed to be focused around the Bowery, just like the Black Mask gang and the clown gang, which both appeared in other districts as well. It seemed like the different sides were biding their time, not clashing for territory yet, but…

There was tension brewing in the air. He didn’t see several groups belonging to different gangs in the same street that night, hadn’t seen that for a few days.

"Oh hey! Pizza kid!" One of the clients greeted him. "Two cheese!"

The other ones mumbled, looking on edge, several of them messing with their guns. They were glancing around, trying to spot something…

Oh, right! They probably heard the engine.

"Uh… I also have to introduce you guys to someone." He said, taking out the order, which smelled divine.

His words sent a shockwave of suspicious glares and safety clicks around the group. One of them even raised his pistol slightly, not quite pointing it but obviously ready to shoot.

"Yes?" The leader of the pack, the one who had welcomed him, replied, voice very soft. It sent shivers down his spine but he spoke through them:

"New coworker. Uh… He’s driving a motorcycle. He’s uh… he’s there. He uh… he has a shirt too."

Nobody relaxed at his explanation, but they did ask him to bring Jason over, voices still tense. He did so while fully aware of the weapons now pointed at his back, of the speed of the men’s heartbeats.

Jason was waiting, leaning on his motorcycle slightly, smoking a cigarette. With his leather jacket and his dark hair, he looked like a biker cut straight out of a movie. Peter really hoped he wouldn’t try to draw his weapons.

"Hey." The young man greeted him, nodding in his direction.

"Hey." He replied shakily. "They said they want to see you. They’re kind of…"

"… Twitchy?" Jason finished. "Yeah that’s fine. Let’s go."

He took one last drag of his smoke and smothered the flame, slipping it back into a bland pack. Saving it for later? It didn’t fit with the image Peter had of him but he couldn’t see any other reason for his behavior.

They both hopped on the bike and drove forward slowly, coming into the view of the group of men. Several of them tended up noticeably when they spotted Jason, who was still openly wearing weapons.

"Hey guys…" Peter smiled weakly. "That’s my coworker Jason…"

Said coworker slid off his motorcycle, putting his hand into his jacket as he walked forward. This caused several men to curse and raise their weapons, guns clicking.

"Chill." Jason said, unperturbed by the fact he was seconds away from his own death. "I’m offering you a smoke."

The pack he took out looked a lot nicer than the one he had used in front of Peter, and two third of the cigarettes in it were still there, all of them pristine. Guns went down slowly.

"You first." The leader sneered, not accepting the gift immediately.

Jason smiled politely, an odd look on his face, and lit one of the sticks, putting it in his mouth and taking a long drag. After a moment, the group of men stepped forward, several of them grabbing an offered cigarette, two fetching the pizza from Peter’s hands, who had been left holding the boxes.

"You local?" One of them asked, after food and smokes had been distributed. Jason was still looking relaxed, completely at ease around them, it seemed to have some sort of calming effect, albeit a slow one. Some of the thugs were looking a lot less tense.

"Kinda." His coworker replied, "have only been in town for a few months. I was born there, though. Left for some time…"

"Where’d you go?"

Peter didn’t have to go through this kind of questioning, which made him reconsider just how old he looked. Jason was getting such a different response than he did on his first deliveries!

"Ethiopia." The older boy replied, unbothered. "Other countries."

"Military?"

The young man shook his head, still smoking calmly.

"Merc?"

This earned the leader of the group a smirk. The atmosphere had completely changed, each answer getting the thugs to relax a little.

"You could say that." Jason nodded, taking one last drag before flickering the cigarette’s remains into the snow. "Working here now. Here, take that."

He handed the man the pack of quality cigarettes, face unreadable. His gift was accepted with a confused but pleased look.

"Let your other boys and girls on the street know about me and my bike." He said, sounding more like he was giving an order than asking for a favor. It worked though, as he got a few nods in answer, all guns now down.

"Guess Marco’s hiring guys like you again." Someone snorted amusedly as the two of them got back on the motorcycle.

Peter was an outlier, then. He was right to think the pizzeria usually took on tougher people than him.

"Guess so." Jason replied flatly.

Then, with a loud engine roar, they were off again.

Chapter Text

Despite having to pause for several minutes every time they delivered to members of the underworld, Peter and Jason handled more orders in one night than the New Yorker had on his own during his whole two weeks working for the pizzeria. The motorcycle was a lot faster than he could ever hope to be while still looking like an ordinary, but very fit, human.

He didn’t feel completely useless, though. Every group of street criminals they had approached had reacted in the same tense way, pulling weapons out once he told them he had brought someone with him. Somehow, his coworker always managed to de-escalate the situation before any shot was fired. He wasn’t particularly tactful but he acted and looked like he belonged there, on the streets of Gotham. He was at ease and his confidence affected everyone around him.

Still, he got a lot of suspicious glares every single time he rolled into the delivery spot. His frame was intimidating to Peter, who could probably take him out with both hands tied behind his back if he really tried to. It must be even more impressive to someone who couldn’t rely on super strength to fight. Without him there to introduce his new coworker, the situation would likely turn sour very quickly.

But then, once the situation was explained, every thug they encountered accepted it easily. Surely, once they were done with introductions, there wouldn’t be much use in him going out to deliver at night. He couldn’t compete with a bike.

Other than a few words every time they arrived at a new delivery area, the two of them were mostly silent, the engine covering up any exchange they could have. Peter appreciated it, not because he didn’t want to learn more about Jason, who had been nothing but nice to him so far, but because he really had no idea what to say. He never interacted with someone like the older boy before, he didn’t know how to act around him.

The young man looked like he liked sports. The only sports he himself was into were parkour, gymnastics and-not that he’d ever admit it to a guy like his coworker- ballet dancing, which he had studied as a kid. Worse than that, he didn’t know anything about the teams in this world. He could only pray that he wouldn’t be forced to talk about it and reveal his lack of knowledge.

Either way, even if he had wanted to make small talk, the motorcycle and the wind combined were too loud for them to exchange anything other than yells. Of course, Peter was easily able to distinguish between sounds, but by now he was pretty convinced that the new guy was not a meta. If he was, it wasn’t a type that affected his body in any way he could notice.

Even Ivy had given out a strange aura with how plants acted around her, and he knew that he could look quite uncanny when he truly let loose powers wise. There was nothing of that sort there. Jason smelled, looked and sounded like a regular human, albeit one who was, at his core, from Gotham.

Like many civilians in the dark city, there was an undercurrent of blood and gunpowder to his scent. Violence was everywhere in the streets, and it was only ramping up, it seemed like even delivery boys were affected by it.

The Clocktower’s bells had just rang midnight when they wrapped up their last route. Marco had them stick to North Gotham, which Peter knew a lot better than the rest of town. It was only a short drive to the pizzeria from their last drop point and, soon, they were in front of the restaurant.

The light was on as usual, the only thing cutting through the darkness of the street. 
Their boss was waiting inside of the main room, smoking a custom rolled cigarette and reading something on his phone. He looked up as Peter, who had wasted no time jumping off the bike, making sure to grimace as he landed, pushed the door open.

"Anybody shoot at you?" The man asked, smothering the fire on a dark ashtray. He didn’t look particularly concerned about their safety, which was more than understandable. Peter could punch through walls, which he was aware of, and Jason had a small arsenal on him at all times. If the guy could use half of the weapons he carried properly, he was very dangerous indeed.

"No." He replied, handing Marco the pizza bag. "I went ahead."

"Smart choice." His boss nodded.

As they were speaking, the new driver had finished securing his motorcycle and joined them, hands in his pockets. For some reason, he looked extremely surprised when they were handed their pay in cash, as if he hadn’t actually expected to be payed. He stared at the bills in his hand for a few seconds in disbelief before putting them away.

"You actually pay, uh." Jason whistled, which made Marco’s eyebrow twitch and his teeth grit.

"Of fucking course I pay, you brat." The man snapped, glaring at the teen.

"Can’t blame me, old man." Peter’s older coworker replied, sounding just as annoyed now that his surprise was gone. Definitely not a fan of authority. "This is Gotham."

The two of them exchanged glares for a while before, abruptly, Jason nodded and held out his hand. To Peter’s surprise the two men, who had looked about to jump at each other’s throat a second prior, exchanged a firm handshake.

"Thank you. I wasn’t actually expecting this to be legit." Jason said with a shrug. "Guess I got lucky."

"What did you think I had him deliver drugs or something?" Marco rolled his eyes, pointing at Peter, who was trying his best to fade into the background.

"Yeah." The young man nodded. "Pretty much. This is better though, I guess. Is the room still free?"

Wait… so he was going to be moving in next to Peter? Why would he even need a place to stay if he could afford a bike, gas and weapons? This was all extremely confusing.

"It is." Marco grumbled, picking up the GPS from the table. "You can go in tonight as long as you pay for it first thing in the morning."

Jason nodded, arms now crossed. He looked pensive and still vaguely surprised, although his shoulders and body were relaxed.

Peter, who was feeling extremely awkward and did not want them to get into an argument again, decided to pipe in, eager to get the two men away from each other:

"I can show you where it is. I live there too."

That earned him another surprised look, Jason obviously not expecting people in Gotham to be so helpful. The older teen frowned slightly, replying:

"I need to grab some stuff first." He drawled out, index tapping on his forearm. "At my old place."

"That’s fine." Peter nodded. "I can help you carry it."

Marco’s glare reminded him that he was supposed to be injured, something he was forgetting quickly now that he wanted to be helpful. He just really hoped he could get the new guy to like him, especially if they were going to become neighbors.

Them becoming friends would be very unlikely, with how different Jason was from him but, maybe being helpful would help with that. He had to try, at least. Not having anyone to hang out with was weighing on him more and more every day.

"I…" For the first time since they met, the older boy looked openly conflicted, brows furrowed and finger tapping his skin faster. "… okay, sure. You can come."

Their boss nodded at that, visibly pleased at how things were turning out. Apparently, them getting along was something he wanted to happen. Survival by the numbers perhaps?

They were shooed out shortly after that exchange, Peter having to wait for the bike’s chains to be unlocked before jumping on. He stayed quiet, hands shoved in his pockets, watching Jason step out and rummage through the large amount of keys he seemed to have on himself at all times.

It would have been more uncomfortable without his new clothes but, thanks to them, only his face and legs felt the bitter cold. The snow had stopped falling once again, but the wind was ever present so close to the coast. He hoped spring would come early, so that he wouldn’t have to worry about dressing warmly anymore.

It only took Jason a few dozen seconds to undo the complicated layer of chains and locks he had wrapped around his motorcycle, an impressive feat. He stored the large bundle into a compartment on the back of the vehicle, which Peter hadn’t noticed earlier, as it completely blended in with the dark sheets of metal around it.

"That’s pretty cool." He forced out, still trying his best to be friendly. He had no idea if this was a normal motorcycle feature, considering how little he knew about them.

The other boy frowned in confusion at that, turning his head to stare at him. Eventually, he gave him a small smile.

"Thanks." He patted the body of the motorcycle, a grin spreading on his face, making him look much younger than he usually did when frowning or glaring. "She’s amazing."

Jason looked genuinely happy to talk about his bike, which made Peter feel like he had won a small battle. Unfortunately, he didn’t know anything about motorized vehicles, and his knowledge of engineering was more focused on what would help him out on the field.

Then, maybe asking questions could be a way of befriending the older teen. Every time he asked him something, he had gotten an answer after all.

"How did you get her?" He wondered, blurting out the first question that came to his mind.

To his surprise, his question earned him a roguish smile. Jason’s eyes sparkled mischievously as he replied, helmet in hand:

"Stole it from my foster father."

Peter sputtered, taken aback by the brutally honest answer. His coworker’s amusement turned into outright laughter at his reaction.

"Okay New York, hop on." Jason smirked. "Don’t worry, it wasn’t even registered."

"It wasn’t?" Peter replied weakly, sitting at the back of the apparently twice illegal vehicle.

"Nah. And it was mine in the first place. I just took it back."

The last of the young man’s sentence was muffled by his helmet and the rest of their talk ended abruptly, swallowed by the roar of the motorcycle. They left the street in an instant, driving full speed in the night. If the area wasn’t already plagued with nighttime disturbance, the noise would have been rude.

Considering this was North Gotham, nobody minded. They drove past several small gatherings of gang members, each drawing weapons as they approached. They were gone to fast for anyone to shoot at them, thankfully.

Jason was an amazing driver, effortlessly avoiding obstacles and somehow managing not to crash the bike despite going faster than what would be allowed on the highway. Peter was as impressed as he was worried by the reckless display. Sure the guy was skilled but still, accidents could happen.

If he was out as Spider-Man, he would definitely ask him to be more careful. As himself he stayed silent, almost biting off his tongue when the bike swerved right in the middle of a road, straight towards a small stairway and…

They lurched in the air, body slightly lifting off of the machine as gravity lost their grip on the two of them for an instant. Peter’s hands kept him anchored safely, blessedly, and he managed to keep from crying out when they landed in a lower street, having flown over at least fifty steps on the way.

Jason was almost completely relaxed, only his legs tense and tight against the frame of the motorcycle, accelerating almost immediately after the wheels touched down, sending them racing through the night once more.

Scratch that, this was more than reckless driving, this was downright illegal. Well, even more illegal than speeding.

Peter’s heart was still pounding wildly when they left the road, heading down towards the southern shore of the northern Gotham peninsula. There, bridges lead to the richer districts of the city, but it wasn’t where they were headed.

Instead they went down a muddy path, driving slower now as they rode past several homeless camps scattered in between broken down buildings and illegal dumping sites. They kept going under several larger bridges, bike effortlessly switching from pavement to dirt, wheels swallowing the grass and easily going over the few ponds they came across.

That thing was an absolute beast, probably able to drive through or across anything. Even a sports bike wouldn’t do this good so no wonder it wasn’t registered. This bike was custom made for sure, and likely had not been checked to make sure it complied to regulations. Jason’s foster dad must have either found it by a pure stroke of luck or commissioned someone extremely talented to modify it.

Still, Peter was now more focused on where they were going that how they had gotten there in the first place. He thought his coworker had an apartment of his own already, but he couldn’t see any buildings around, only a small wasteland in the space between the end of the roads and the shore of the river.

He kept his mouth shut as they got closer to what appeared to be another dumping ground, this time featuring several shipping containers, abandoned to rust out there where no one would pick them up again. They slithered in between the dark metal shapes, patches of sky stretching out in between their sheet walls.

Deep in the container labyrinth, Jason stopped the bike, gesturing for him to get down. Once they were both on foot, the young man pushed his motorcycle towards what appeared to be a homemade box, made out of varying materials, going from wood planks to metallic roof sheets.

It was only when he saw him put a lock on a makeshift door, made of a wood panel and metal bars, that Peter realized this was where Jason lived.

Immediately, everything he thought he knew about the other boy collapsed in his mind. He had assumed that the teen had a lot of money due to his bike and his weaponry but he had been completely wrong. This was looking a lot like his own situation, a few weeks prior.

What about his foster family? Did they throw him out? It felt weird to think that this cool, tall and muscular guy could perhaps be struggling just as much as he also was.

"Don’t be weird." Jason warned him, noticing his wide eyes. He looked tense, hands tightened into fists, teeth clenching.

"It’s fine." Peter hurriedly answered, blushing. "I slept under roofs for a bit."

Blessedly, the darkness hid his cheeks as they reddened even deeper. His coworker had now turned to look at him up and down, tension bleeding out of his frame.

The young man sighed, rubbing the back of his head with his hand, looking somewhere between tired and exasperated.

"You wanna find a good shelter first, if it ever happens again." Jason eventually grumbled. "I can give you some tips."

"That would… actually be pretty helpful." Peter blinked. He had not expected that reaction but it was much better than the anger he thought he was about to be confronted with.

He wasn’t lying, too. He needed advice, they both had a roof over their heads thanks to their job, but it seemed they were in the same unstable situation.  If they happened to lose employment for whatever situation, they would end up back on the streets.

"Kay. Well first thing is…" Jason bent down, reaching in his jeans pocket for a small key, which he used on several locks along the side of a large container. This unit was bigger than most of the others, its walls covered with more layers of metallic sheets, nailed down every few inches along their edges. "… You’ve got to expect people to steal. It’s just something that happens, you can’t stop it. No matter how much you threaten someone, they can always get desperate enough to still go after you."

Peter nodded, watching him pull out more keys and getting more locks, several of which where hidden behind plaques and sheets.

"So one of the thing you can do is to make sure no one else can get in." Jason turned towards him, holding up a finger. "Now this only apply for people like us, who have some money saved up. Priority is grabbing a safe, secure place."

"Wh-What about the bike?" Peter asked, now utterly fascinated by the older teen’s confidence. "Won’t people try to steal it?"

"They can. A lot of people tried, that box is easy to get in. You can’t start it without the key though, and you can’t high jack it."

"You stole it though." He pointed out, frowning.

Jason smiled at the reminder, visibly proud of his criminal accomplishment. He turned away from the metal bar he was dislodging from the many chains keeping it locked to the door and replied:

"It used to be mine. Of course I know how to steal it back."

He tinkered in silence for a good more minute before, finally, the door leading inside the container slid open, letting them in. Peter followed in silence, a bit amazed that his coworker was able to make this kind of shelter. To him, it sounded like it was barely a challenge, he only had needed a bit of money.

But to Peter, ending up on the streets had been so shocking that he hadn’t even thought about making his own shelter, let alone customize it in such a way. He had been solely focused on getting the bare essentials: food and respite from the cold. He still remembered how fuzzy his mind had been, how hungry and lost he had felt.

It would have taken Jason days to put all this together, let alone find such a good spot in the first place. He had barely been able to keep himself fed. Of course, his meta abilities had allowed him to find a job easily after that, but that wasn’t something he had truly earned.

While he thought about the time it must have taken to set up a camp like this, his coworker was crouching in front of him, busy putting down something that smelled like batteries inside of a small box. As soon as they clicked in, a lightbulb slowly ticked into life. Its glow was weak, tinged more yellow than what Peter was used to. It was an old spiral shaped model, the kind that used less electricity.

The inside of the container was very neat, separated in two rooms by what appeared to be a shower curtain, which had been stitched back together and attached to a long wooden pole, itself nailed to the roof. Behind it, a sleeping back as well as a small pile of books were visible.

The side they were standing on was much larger than what Peter assumed was the bedroom. Two large boxes occupied the end of the container, one appearing to be some kind of camping cooler, the other a professional looking military suitcase. On the wall, several different postcards from different countries around the globe reflected some of the flickering light.

Jason had found a rug, which had been scrubbed many times but still smelled distinctly of blood and dirt to his enhanced senses. It appeared to be the main place he sat at, since it was covered with notebooks, half finished electronics projects and even an old bulky laptop.

Nailed on the walls, a few makeshift shelves held pots and bowls, as well as a few spices. Under it, tucked against the wall next to the cooler, was a camp stove, constituting of a gas bottle and small metallic area to put down a pan.

For some reason, on top of the smell of the rug, Peter could detect a strong fuel scent, coming from under it. A hidden compartment? It sure smelled like it.

He didn’t have time to think about that, though, he was too busy being impressed. This was one hell of a setup, he hadn’t been able to even do half that well before he got his pizzeria job. Jason was more than a bit smart, going by how well he managed to scrap different parts and put it all together to make himself a temporary home.

"Dude." Peter whispered. "You’re doing so much better than I was."

"Had some money already." Jason shrugged, picking up some books and handing them to him in a pile. Most of them were about vehicles in some way, but there were some novels among the lot. "It’s also not my first time. I know where to go to sell stuff and where people will leave you alone. People move in and out of this place but they don’t stick around, it’s better for me. If you can’t fight, it’s generally better to buy a tent, some bribes, and try to join a camp."

He was opening up a lot more now that they had established they were both equally struggling in life. Peter himself felt more at ease, his shyness replaced by fascination with how efficiently the space had been transformed. He could tell the walls were several layers thick from their smell, the door itself had been such a complex system…

They put the books and the less damaged cutlery into a dark sports bag Jason took out of his small bedroom. It smelled like hair and soap, he had probably been using it as a pillow.

"You mind getting the cooler?" His, hopefully, new friend asked him as they wrapped up putting the electronics and computer stuff into the now tightly packed bag. Before Peter could stand up to head over to the kitchen area, the older boy stopped him, adding: "You can dump the ice out."

"Ice? Like snow?"

His question was answered as he opened the cooler to take the items out. There, wrapped in plastic grocery bags, were hundreds and hundreds of ice cubes, as well as a significant quantity of shaved ice.

"Did you get this from a hotel?" Peter wondered aloud, remembering the few times he himself had stayed at one. Ned and him had found it cool how they could just wander around and get their own ice and drinks.

"Yeah." Jason replied, sounding smug. "A lot of the ones up north have permanent residents. It’s really easy to blend in and go scoop some for free."

That was a smart and efficient way of getting ice, Peter had to give him that. Now, of course, the inside of the box didn’t seem particularly well optimized in his opinion. Half of it was filled with beer, the other half had a whole lot of cheap frozen burger patties and a couple bags of green beans. Food contamination, who?

"Uh… I have a fridge at my place if you wanna borrow it."

"You have a fridge?" Jason repeated, staring at him, sports bag now flung on his back and rolled up sleeping bag tucked under his arm.

"A mini fridge. It’s small." Peter corrected himself, elbows deep into the freezing cooler.

"We have electricity?" The teen’s voice was more shocked than what he had expected.

"Uh… yeah. And warm water for a few hours a day." Peter took out several bags, setting them down next to him before digging back into ice cube hell. "I think you also have a TV."

"I have a TV." Jason replied. "This deal is too good to be true."

Disbelief was evident in his tone but, other than shaking his head, he didn’t add anything else. They finished packing up in silence, leaving the two rooms almost empty, the curtains and the rug the only items left there.

"Alright, stay next to the bike." Jason pointed at Peter, after clearing some snow to put down the military case -probably where he put his weapons at night, it smelled of oil and gunpowder- and the cooler. "I need to get one last thing."

As he has suspected, the rug rolled back to reveal a small trap door, inserted into the container’s floor. The smell of fuel reminded Peter of Firefly, of flames and blood. He shook his head, trying to banish the thoughts from his mind.

Jason came back holding three red jerry gas cans. Of course, oil would also be something worth stealing, he hadn’t even thought about it.

Somehow, the two of them managed to fit everything on the bike, using a copious amount of chains and locks to secure it all. Peter watched, sitting cross-legged with the cooler on his lap, as his coworker expertly closed the doors behind them.

They rode back to the Bowery more carefully than before, sticking to dark areas and shadowed alleyways. Thankfully, the neighborhood was familiar to them both and they easily navigated to their building.

"Damn." Jason noted as he stopped the bike in front of it. "That’s in good shape."

Indeed, most of the Bowery was in such a state that this one establishment looked almost like a manor with its electricity and somewhat clean front door. There wasn’t even a visible hole on the roof!

Peter waited patiently as Jason walked around the neighborhood to find a spot to anchor his bike at. He must be really confident about how secure it was. Did he not worry about someone towing it… or maybe even his foster father tracking it and claiming it back?

What kind of person even was his former foster parent, to have a motorcycle like this? Even for a racing fan, this kind of power in a vehicle that was being used for deliveries was more than unusual.

"Are you sure it’ll be okay?" He asked for the tenth or twentieth time, anxiously looking around, ready for a fight. Jason answered him by shrugging, looking worried but resolute.

"It’ll be good for now. I’ll find a better spot tomorrow." He mumbled, piling the boxes and items they had recovered from his room into his arms.

He handed Peter the cooler, still full of food and alcohol. The boy remembered to carry it with both hands, pretending to struggle with its weight. He didn’t know how convincing he was but at least he was trying.

They made their way to the cramped entrance hall, dimly lit by a single lightbulb this late into the night. The two of them didn’t waste time touring the lower floors and, instead, started up towards their apartments.

"I’m pretty sure this is a hideout." Peter whispered as they climbed the steps. "I’ve seen people with guns and everything."

Jason snorted, turning his head to smirk down at him. "New York, everyone has guns here."

"Not me."

"For now." The older teen pointed out. "You can’t lock yourself out of stuff like that, you might not have a choice."

He sounded vaguely exasperated, as if it wasn’t the first time he had had this argument. If he had been honest about traveling the world, he had probably met plenty of civilians from other cities than Gotham. Surely, he knew that what was common behavior here was not shared everywhere else in the country, let alone the world.

"There’s always a choice." Peter said after a brief silence. He didn’t want to antagonize Jason, who he hoped could become a friend, them clashing like this was making him uncomfortable, but he also did not want to let go of his principles, especially in Gotham.

Thankfully, they reached the last floor before they could debate any further. The door to the apartment in front of his, his new coworker’s, had been left ajar, with a key dangling from its handle. Through the crack, the apartment looked nearly identical to his, only with a large wooden cupboard opening into the wall, next to where to bathroom was located.

Peter’s apartment was slightly smaller than this one, but he was happy with his choices. Now that he had a computer and internet, he wouldn’t need a TV and the desk would be useful now that he had to focus on programming and research.

He handed off the items he had helped bring up, backing off silently, still feeling awkward as neither of them had spoken since the gun conversation. He really hoped he hadn’t just messed it all up by speaking out, maybe he should just have kept his mouth shut…

"Hey." Jason called out to him as he was about to open his own door. "Uh… thanks." He looked oddly shy, for a man who was usually so confident.

Peter couldn’t help but beam at the other boy, his hopes of finding a friend now burning brighter than ever in his mind. Even if they didn’t agree on the topic of firearms, it was apparently not enough for the older boy to get tired of him. Good, he loved to debate with people, it would have been sad if his first ever friend in this world wasn’t able to take it.

Feeling emboldened, he took a deep breath and asked, anxious despite himself:

"Do you- … want to- uh… use my fridge?"

Something odd passed through Jason’s eyes as he heard the question. His pupils dilated abruptly and his nostrils twitched, barely noticeable to the human eyes but blatant to Peter. Surprise, anger or…

Fear?

The emotions disappeared as quickly as they had appeared, barely a flash really, and the young man shook his head.

"Nah, thanks. I’m good."

Disappointment weight heavily on his shoulders. Maybe now was not the right time to ask the older teen to come in, considering how late it was, but helping people was good for making friends and he really wanted to get to know his neighbor better.

"Are you sure?"

"Yeah…" Jason awkwardly rubbed his head with his free hand, the other one holding his weapon case tightly. "No offense but uh… it’s not really a thing here. People don’t uh… share food… stuff." He coughed awkwardly at the end of that last sentence. It was likely an unspoken rule in Gotham, one he probably never had to spell out before.

"Oh."

"Yeah. Don’t worry about it."

They started at each other in uncomfortable silence for a few more moments before Jason cleared his throat and thanked him again, retreating into his own apartment. Peter stayed standing there for a few more seconds, staring at the closed door in front of his, listening to the new set of heartbeats in the building, before shaking his head in disappointment and stepping into his room. He would find a way to talk to his neighbor tomorrow, and then hopefully they could be friends.

He had been wrong about Jason. He thought the young man was out of his reach, wealthy and too cool for him, but he had let appearances trick him. The boy was just like him, someone struggling to survive in this city without anyone on their side.

He was from Gotham, born and raised here unlike Peter. He knew things instinctively, walked in this town like he belonged.

But maybe there was a way past the cold, distant air most Gothamites put on.

Peter would do his best to find it because, as he settled into his mattress, hair wet with ice cold water and computer pushed to the ground, he could hear Jason do the same from behind his door and, for what seemed like the first time in an eternity, he didn’t feel completely alone anymore.

He wanted that feeling to last.
Notes:

    Sike, this Jason is like 18 and just out of Under the Red Hood (6-7 months) he doesn’t have a support system, an apartment or really anything except spite and an existential crisis

    Tweaked the timeline a little, he stopped trying to kill Bats a few months ago but only talks to a few of them. Definitely on very bad terms with Batman.
    He has not met the outlaws yet. We’re at the very start of the DC Rebirth timeline with some changes because I wanted drama.

    Hahahahahahahaha i love using characters who are going through the most unstable part of their lives

    If you’re only there for Peter don’t worry about it and just enjoy the ride :)

    Jason stole his old robin bike from Batman and repurposed it cause I thought it was funny so here you go

Chapter Text

Having a computer again was both amazing and, potentially very dangerous. Not for his life, of course, but rather for his free time.

It was dreadfully easy for him to get distracted when he went online. He had a tendency to fall into rabbit holes and stay up reading about various topics until the early morning. He had more free time now, since he only worked nights and wasn’t at school anymore, but going back out as a vigilante should still remain his priority.

So, after setting up his Internet, he started looking more into how to connect the remains of the Iron Spider to his laptop. Of course, Stark Industries did not exist in this universe. That complicated his task since there would be no available software to port data from it to another operating system.

Last time, Tony had gifted him a key with all the necessary apps to run the suit on it, many of which he’d developed himself.

Now, it wouldn’t be Peter’s first time creating his own piece of software from scratch, but it would be his first time on his own. Ned, who was more experienced at it, had always helped him out whenever he struggled with something. The projects he had worked on had also been simpler, mostly games he programmed as a kid, before he became Spider-Man.

He tried to remember everything he could about Stark OS. Tony used several languages when he wrote code, depending on what he was developing. The only one Peter was confident in, from the four or so he could remember seeing when he looked over the Iron Spider’s programming, was Python.

First things first he needed to be able to look over the micro drives he had salvaged to have an idea of the damage. Recovering the files without breaking them even further was the hard part, but it would come later. He really hoped the security systems had been among the ones disabled, having to go up against that kind of software would take him weeks, at least.

Blessedly, after spending a couple hours wanting to throw his laptop out of the window, he was able to wrangle his way into scanning the drives’ content.

Several files had been corrupted, either by the dimension shift, fire or his attempts at brute forcing his way into the system. More than half of them, though, were still intact.

About two third of the heat scanner subroutines were intact, from what he could tell. Most of this first drive had to do with different scanning systems, which would definitely be useful out in Gotham. He’d have to make a list of everything he needed to fix and prioritize which tech he wanted to implement in his first suit.

His suit!

Peter started, shaking his head. He completely forgot to look up where he could get materials for the suit. That was the priority, even above looking over the files.

Even better, he needed to automate the scanning process so he didn’t have to painstakingly look at every single one. That wasn’t available for Stark files but the task was simple enough that he should be able to write it himself and leave it to run in the background.

Of course, it was easier said than done. He didn’t trust himself not to spend the whole day obsessing over it so he chose to push it back. Instead, he switched tabs to look into the different crafts store around Gotham.

The city was absolutely massive and, therefore, it had a wealth of hobby shops. The only issue was that they were south of the Bowery, deep into the richer districts. He would have to leave as soon as possible and probably even grab lunch on his way there if he wanted to make it back to his apartment in time to drop off the materials before getting to work.

He had so much choice in where to go that he could afford to be picky. He mentally crossed out several generalized hobby stores, narrowing it down to sewing and costume making only. Looking at their online catalogue, he was surprised to see that a disturbing amount of them offered body armors do it yourself kits.

Of course, that wasn’t what he needed but it was nonetheless a sign that Gotham must be one of the best city to find costume components in. They would definitely have Spandex, which he wanted to put in the flexible spots of the suit. With luck, they might have Kevlar outside of their kits. If they didn’t, he could probably find it at a heavy crafts store in the form of gloves. Having a roll would be easier since he wouldn’t have to undo the patron first but he wasn’t picky.

He narrowed it down to one of the three stores that offered the most body armor kits options. Unlike the others, it was located closer to where he lived. South of Old Gotham, it must be in one of the safest places in the poorer districts. Both the GCPD and the various gangs of the adjacent neighborhoods were likely familiar with the place.

His choice made, Peter shoved as much money as he could in his jacket’s pockets. His new boots covered his feet up to his ankles, hiding the last traces of injury. Only a few faded pink lines remained where he had been bitten. By the end of the day, they would disappear.

Before he left, he checked up on the plant Ivy has gotten him. It seemed comfortable under the window, sunlight hitting it straight on. Maybe he should go back to that bookstore he had visited the other day, find a guide on how to take care of plants.

Or he could just go online. It was easy to get out of the habit of googling everything for an answer but he had his own computer now. A quick search before leaving taught him that he needed to be careful while watering it. They could drown with too much water, so he would have to keep in mind how often he did it.

Plant food was also risky when using commercial fertilizers. It could be done, from the few articles he was skimming through, but it had to be only once in a while, and other specialized mix or nutrient teas were better for them than generalized products.

Hopefully the fabric store being in Old Gotham would mean he would get the time to swing by a gardening store.

Thinking about how many inches he would need, Peter pushed his door, turned around to lock it and-…

A sound behind him. His neighbor’s door creaked as he heard it slowly swing open. Jason was coming out at the same time as he was and he hadn’t even noticed it with how focused he had been on his suit project!

"Hey!" He turned around to greet his coworker, trying not to look too eager at the idea of being involved in a positive human interaction.

Jason didn’t appear surprised to see him, his heartbeat remaining even through their talk and his pupils only shifting slightly, mostly due to the change in lightning. He was as collected as he had been most of the previous night, something Peter himself could only dream to one day achieve.

"Morning." The older teen greeted him, despite the fact that it was almost noon. He didn’t look like he had slept in, though, his eyes alert and his back straight. "Heading out?"

Wow. Jason asked him a question. He wasn’t the only one trying to make a connection there. That simple fact made Peter want to smile abut he managed to swallow it back. He really didn’t want to come off as a creep and mess up his one shot at getting a buddy.


Both of them were apparently on their own, maybe his coworker was also looking for a friend? It would be perfect, then they would both be helping each other out. Hope was burning bright in his mind, perhaps a bit too much as he stumbled through his answer, too distracted by the idea that he had to not be creepy to think about what he was saying.

"Um- yeah… Need to get… uuuuh… stuff."

Jason raised an eyebrow at his lackluster answer, leaning back against the wall in a way that was way too cool for Peter to ever hope to emulate.

Where did he learn how to act like this? He looked like he had been plucked straight out of an old detective comics about a roguish antihero. Outside of his suit, Peter just looked like a normal kid and out of the two of them he was the vigilante!

"Are you finally buying a gun?" Jason eventually asked, crossing his arms in front of his chest. Peter frowned at the comment, immediately trying to clear up the misunderstanding:

"No!" He shook his head. "I’m not even old enough to-"

His coworker smirked at that, rolling his eyes but still looking amused by his reaction. It seemed like getting him riled up about firearms was a source of entertainment for the young man.

"You’re old enough." Jason told him, pushing away from the wall to head towards the stairs. Peter hurriedly followed him, happy their disagreement wasn’t turning into an argument. His stance on using firearms was not one he intended to budge on anytime soon.

"You’re not pushing it." He pointed out, curiosity getting the better of him as always. "Me getting a gun I mean."

Further down the steps, the dark haired teen shrugged.

"You’re not trying to get me to stop using them, why would I try to force you to do something you don’t want to?" Jason’s shoulders tensed briefly after he said those words, something a bit like bitterness or regret in his tone.
It wasn’t directed at him, Peter could tell that much. Maybe someone in the older boy’s life had tried to do just what he was describing. Perhaps that was even the reason behind his hatred of authority.

He did previously mention having to deal with pacifists in his life… A picture was starting to form in his mind of what Jason’s life could be like. It was still missing several pieces though, details he couldn’t connect together.

The two of them quickly reached the ground floor. As usual, no one was around in the entrance hall, most residents off at work or in their apartment sleeping. A lot of their neighbors, unsurprisingly, worked at night. Many people did in the Bowery.

Gotham almost seemed more alive after dusk, at least in the northern areas. There was a whole second layer of the city that only stirred once the sky darkened, one Peter was slowly learning the codes and rules of. He wasn’t a participant in the underworld but, as he had to interact with it more and more often, it became easier for him to decrypt the culture that surrounded it. Night was a constant companion to many criminals here.

"Need a ride?" Jason asked him as they stepped over the puddles of melted snow that welcomed them in front of their building. "I’m also getting some stuff for my place."

Peter’s first instinct was to object, worried about giving out too many informations, however he remembered about his supposed injury and the fact that, in Gotham, it was apparently common to buy a do it yourself body armor kit. It probably wouldn’t be that odd of him to want to get some safe gear for his deliveries, right?

On top of that, it wasn’t as if Jason himself wasn’t blatantly carrying weapons. Out of everyone he knew, his coworker would be one of the least likely to judge him for buying paramilitary supplies.

"It might be out of your way." He warned, still uncertain but now mostly due to the fact he didn’t want to bother his neighbor.

"As long as we don’t go south, I’m good." Jason reassured him. "I need to get a bunch of shit from all over north Gotham."

"It’s uh- Okay. It’s in Old Gotham, a fabric store."

To his surprise, his coworker’s eyes lit up and he snapped his fingers in recognition.

"Three Gs, right? Good place. Smart choice. You do need better night clothes." He punctuated that with an approving nod. 

"Three Gs?"

Jason once again appeared amused by his confusion. The older teen started walking away from their building, motioning for him to follow.

"Gotham General Gear. People call it Three Gs."

"Oh yeah that’s the place." Peter nodded, recognizing the full name. "Is it famous?"

"Famous isn’t the right word…" Jason mused, willing to humor his curiosity as always. "They’re more like an institution. They’ve been there for a while."

"Kinda like Marco’s."

"Yeah. Except they didn’t close."

Closing down seemed to be a very real risk when setting up a business north of Gotham. Many empty stores had been turned into squats in some of the areas Peter used to sleep in before he got his apartment. He had even found a mall, completely abandoned and dilapidated, but hadn’t dared step in due to the gang activity around it. Empty, secure buildings didn’t only attract the homeless, unfortunately.

They were reaching the motorcycle’s parking spot by now. It had remained intact throughout the night, although several of the chains anchoring it to the ground looked like they had been cut through. It was wrapped so tightly that whoever had tried to grab it had quickly given up, leaving it protected by several layers of metal still.

Jason crouched down next to the severed chains, cursing under his breath. He grabbed them and stood back up, arms reaching back as if to throw the broken gear away. Peter stopped him before he could go through it, clearing his throat to get his attention.

"I can fix it if you want." He told the older teen, explaining in the same breath : "I have a soldering kit at my place."

"You have soldering stuff?" This seemed to catch his coworker’s interest like nothing else he’d said before. Rather than be appalled at his poor safety practice of using flammable tools inside of a wooden room, the young man grinned. "You into making shit?"

"Yeah!" Peter replied enthusiastically. "I’m more into robotics though, but uh… you like bikes right?" He remembered the books they’d brought back from the container shelter. Most of them had been about vehicles.

"No shit." Jason grinned, patting his motorcycle fondly.

An half baked idea formed into the vigilante’s head, bursting out of his mouth before he could really think about it. He needed to work on his impulse control.

"I’d love to learn how they work, if you have time to show me." Peter said, embarrassment catching up to him before he even finished his sentence. "I mean I know robots and computers but not much else."

His neighbor stared at him with wide eyes for a few heartbeats before abruptly straightening up. There was a slight upward tilt to his mouth, a shadow of a true smile, one that reached his eyes. As always, Jason looked much younger when he wasn’t frowning, barely older than him in fact.

Yep. He had been right. Showing interest in what people liked was a good way to make friends and it was more than easy to see how much the other boy loved his bike. Plus, learning more about a subject he was completely ignorant about could only be a good thing. If anything it would allow him to expand his skill set as Spider-Man. Many times, he had had to lift a broken down car out of traffic only to have to lower it in a nearby parking lot, unable to fix it.

Living in New York City meant he had never been pushed to learn much about vehicles. Maybe his life would have been different had he not been pushed towards computers by Ned, engineering by Tony, and biology by his own mutation. He was a bit relieved that, even across the multiverse, he could still find ways to teach himself more skills.

"Shit. Yeah." Jason nodded, sounding slightly dazed. It had taken him more time than usual to reply. "You really want me to teach you?"

The emphasis he put on the second half of the sentence betrayed his surprise, which was confusing. Did nobody ever ask him for this kind of advice? Maybe he was just too intimidating for other civilians… but then this was Gotham. Even with his bike and his guns, Peter’s coworker didn’t have anything on Orca or Ivy when it came to being intimidating. It just seemed to come with being born in this city.

He focused back on the conversation, trying his best to go through with his impulsive request since it seemed to actually make his coworker happy.

Don’t be creepy, Parker.

"Uh… yeah. I really like mechanical stuff and you look like you know a lot more than I do. Cause I don’t know a lot. About bikes."

Awkward.

This time however, he got a full-blown smile in answer. Jason looked honestly happy to share what appeared to be one of his passions with someone else, despite his initial surprise.

"I’ll show you a few tricks." The young man told him, packing up the rest of the chains and locks wrapped around his bike. "But not today."

Peter nodded. He also had a lot of work in front of him that day, even if being dropped off at the store would make him gain some time. He had thought out of several patrons for the suit but hadn’t drawn any yet, wanting to wait and see what he was going to have to work with. Different materials might require different techniques and if he wanted to mix components, the patron would have to be even more specialized.

It would be his first full suit on his own. His first attempt at it, years ago, had been terrible. Since then he’d learned a lot, mostly from Tony but also from talking to the other Avengers and then going over the information with Ned and MJ. He practiced over and over again at the drawing board until his blueprints looked clean enough. He asked May to teach him more advanced sewing technique, learned soldering, metal working and engineering at Stark Industries then, later, on his own.

He had eventually reached a point where he could modify the Iron Spider without having to ask for authorization. By the time Tony died, he had felt confident in his ability to design and repair his own suits.

He would put all of it to the test now. He had been planning to make the Spider Suits ever since his old one got burned but still he couldn’t help but feel slightly anxious. Even if it had been years, even if he had learned a lot since then, this costume would be how civilians would see him, how criminals would be introduced to him. If he messed it up, it would ruin his entire image.

As he thought, Jason had finished freeing up his bike from the cocoon of metal and plastic sheets he had wrapped it in.

"Hop on." He told him, sliding his helmet on.

Peter settled at the back of the motorcycle just as he had the previous night, watching with interest as they drove through the winding streets. In the daylight, their ride was less daring than it had been the previous night. They didn’t jump from one street to another or slid ridiculously close to the ground, thankfully for his stress levels.

The city’s landscape was shifting ever so slightly. He could see more security cameras than before, as well as a large police presence, especially as they got closer and closer to Old Gotham. Almost everyone on the street carried a firearm, the ones who didn’t walked fast, tense and anxious. About a fourth of the people they drove by had a body armor of some kind under their clothes. It was easy to see from the stiffness of their movement, the  way their clothes pulled at their shoulders.

Every day that passed, the atmosphere became more tense. How long would the pressure keep on building up like this before the whole city erupted into violence? There was no more time to wait and learn, he had to get out there again.

Jason did not need any directions to drop him off at the fabric store, heading there quickly, cutting through several side streets as he did so. He was obviously very well acquainted with this side of town as he never stopped once.

Gotham General Gear stood as far away as one could get from Crime Alley while still being in North Gotham, its front facing one of the three bridges that led into the more stable districts in town. Of course, all areas of the city had issues with crimes, the news shows he listened to on the radio made that quite clear. The difference between the broken down, dirty street of the Bowery and this clean, secure shop remained stark nonetheless.

It was bigger than what Peter had envisioned and quite openly advertised the many options it had for self defense clothing. Mannequins lined the glass windows, each clad in various jackets or military pants and adorned with signs that certified them fire proof, acid proof and many other things that he would never have though about when shopping for a new outfit. Several hoodies on display had a gas mask function.

"They sell clothes?" He wondered aloud, sliding off the bike and walking closer to get a better look at the items.

He half expected Jason to answer him and then drive off but, to his surprise, his coworker stepped down after him, securing his motorcycle expertly as always.

" They don’t. They’d get robbed almost immediately if they sold gear. Those are just examples of what you can make with their stuff. They do have kits though."

He said that as if he expected Peter to jump on those. To his credit, the aforementioned kits were likely extremely popular, with how many of them lined the entrance of the store. Most of them were priced in the hundreds of dollars yet several models looked to be sold out. Safety didn’t come cheap in Gotham but the citizens did not have a choice.

Some cheaper options were offered, further inside, using weaker, softer metal alloys for its plates. He turned around to ask Jason why the kits weren’t being stolen, since they were apparently worth quite a lot, but realized that his neighbor had slipped away without him noticing.

It required a great deal of sneakiness to move without him noticing. He filed the information in a corner of his mind, already focusing back on browsing the first few aisles.

They were all relatively lively, with several customers looking through the rows of shelves and many tables covered with rolls and samples. A lot of the fabric on display was ordinary, the kind used for day to day clothes, but a significant part of the store was dedicated to gear making. More than half of it, in fact. From floor to ceiling, plates, helmets, gloves and raw materials were laid in front of him. He had never seen anything quite like this before. Gotham truly was in a league of its own.

Their selection was massive to the point that Peter had never heard of several of the items he was staring at. He felt a bit lost. He hadn’t expected there to be so many choices available. It made sense, considering how unstable Gotham was, but it was still an extremely odd experience.

"What’s your budget?" Jason asked him, tapping his shoulder and making him jump. Once again the teen had managed to sneak up on him. Sure, he was distracted but that was some next level quietness. 

His coworker was holding a large cardboard box under his left arm. No label was attached to it but he could smell metal inside of it. He was not the only one looking to make some kind of body armor, then.

Was that a normal thing in this city? With how different the patrons of stores looked from each other, Peter could believe it. One little old lady was noticeably loading her basket full of Kevlar and metal plates, several of them much too small to be aimed at protecting an adult. Gotham was the kind of town where grandparents would rather craft armor for their grandchildren rather than knit scarves or hoodies.

"Your budget?" Jason asked again, dragging him out of his thoughts.

He didn’t sound impatient but it didn’t stop Peter from blushing. How embarrassing of him to space out like that.

And then, how was he even supposed to answer this question? He couldn’t exactly let the other teen know how much he had and especially not how he had gotten it. They had the same job and, even though it payed surprisingly well, they both knew it wasn’t enough to afford the most expensive materials in the store.

"Hey dude." Jason called, looking way too relaxed for someone who was talking about potentially criminal matters. "I don’t care how you get your money. I’m not gonna ask. I just want to make sure you get good stuff."

"You’ve made one of those before?" Peter cleared his throat, trying to change the subject and gain enough time to decide just how much information he wanted to give up. It seemed to work, probably because he was being humored.

"I’ve made tons of them." Jason replied, sounding proud. "Learned to a while back. I’ll help you out."

He looked very serious about it. Everyone in this town probably thought Peter was a hopeless child, with how they treated him whenever it came to facing danger. He still nodded, trying to look grateful. This was a good move to protect his secret identity. If he looked incompetent or inexperienced, it would be harder to connect him to Spider-Man once he came back.

"Sure." After some hesitation he added, trying to remain vague: "I can spend a few hundreds, maybe more."

Jason did not appear surprised at his admission, as if this answer had been expected. The dark haired teen nodded silently, walking a few feet away and calling him over.

A bit confused, Peter followed him. He hadn’t expected his coworker to come inside with him, even less try to help him chose materials.

"Where are we going?" He asked, as they passed several shelves of boxes filled with armor kits and various outfit patrons.

"Raw materials." Jason shot back, sounding oddly gleeful. He appeared to enjoy projects of this sort, as gloomy as it may seem to an outsider.

"Not a kit?"

"Nah. Those wouldn’t work for you. You need something to wear under your work clothes."

They fell silent as they got closer to the back wall of the store, which was lined with racks and piles of folded fabric, strips of leather and metal plates. Under the displays, crates of tools, many of which he had never seen before, where neatly stored.

Jason tapped several samples as they walked past, waiting patiently when Peter checked each and everyone of the ones he’d selected that way. The new driver appeared to know his stuff, every sample he’d chosen so far looked pristine, without any scuffs or tear, and felt extremely resilient when he tugged at them. He didn't know most of the things he was being recommended, a lot of them being synthetic mixes or expensive sounding materials he would never had the budget to think about before he met Tony. Once he did meet Iron Man, though, he didn't really have to worry about the materials of his suit anymore.

"A lot of those are hybrid materials." The young man told him conversationally. "You could also go for a classic like Kevlar, of course. It’s always reliable."

As he spoke he handed him several different pieces of fabric to test, even taking out a pocket knife to slash at some of the most expensive ones. The blade, although it wasn’t pushed hard, slid harmlessly on the different materials, leaving no trace. If someone tried to attack him on the streets, wearing something like this under his shirt would be a good excuse as to why he could shrug off most blows, at least when it came to blades. Maybe having a thicker looking jacket could help with making him seem more sturdy? He didn't feel like buying a new coat quite yet, though and, although his new friend looked intimidating in his biker jacket, he felt like he wouldn't be able to pull off that specific look. He always had looked more of a track kid than a biker...

"Do you do this a lot?" Peter wondered, noticing how comfortable Jason appeared testing out armor parts. The older boy had put his knife back in his pocket and was now squinting at a square of cloth through what appeared to be a small cylindrical looking glass.

"Uh yeah." The older teen nodded, stopping midway down the aisle to shrug. "Biking and-…"

He didn’t finish his sentence but it was easy to fill in the blanks. Jason used to be a mercenary and had been operating outside of the law. From what he had noticed until then, the teen was crafty, even more so than him. Making his own body armor was in character for him. Despite his curiosity, Peter didn’t push his luck by asking questions he didn't really want to know the answers of and instead focused on getting the supplies he had come for. Having Jason with him complicated matters slightly, since he wouldn’t be able to stock up on materials and make several suits as he had originally intended. Only one would have to do. Even that made his heart skip a beat. Soon, he would be back out.

At least he could use the current violence in Gotham to justify reinforcing most of his clothes, especially considering his job. If he explained it properly, he might even be able to get some Spandex to complete his design, as he had originally intended. His mind started racing through different excuses he could give, even as his hands and fingers ran over the surface of the display table, trying to feel something different, something that would help him decide between the different rolls of fabric. He had narrowed it down to a handful then narrowed his eyes, noticing a detail he had previously overlooked, not thinking it would be of any importance to the making of a suit.

Out of all the samples presented to him by Jason, one stood out, not only for its quality but also for something very… odd.

It smelled familiar.

Not only that but as he rubbed his fingers across the small square, he could feel a strange satisfaction start to spread through his body. This was right. Felt right.

Curious, he turned the dark cloth over, eyes widening when he read the label that had been attached to its back. The price was high, a couple hundred dollars for half a yard, but it wasn’t what shocked him the most.

"ENHANCED SPIDER SILK - SYNTHETIC MIX" danced in front of his eyes, instantly explaining why he had been so drawn to the smooth fabric. It was hard not to grin. Spider silk? It felt like it had been placed here for him.

He had a hard time believing such a smooth, flowing textile could be useful for defense but Jason’s knife test proved him wrong. Stabbing and cutting left the silk intact, so did tugging. His coworker grunted approvingly at his choice, patting him on the shoulder with a hand that was a touch too rough. The left corner of the young man's mouth was tensing slightly, flexing then tensing back up again. He was thinking about something. What exactly, Peter couldn't figure out.

Looking at the specifics on the product pamphlet that had been placed next to the silk on the table, Peter felt his mouth go dry. This unassuming piece of cloth was stronger than Kevlar by several magnitudes. No wonder it was so expensive. He knew about silk being resistant but this was better than what he could ever have envisioned.

All plans of hiding how much money he had went out the window instantly as he realized that this was it. This was the one material he had been looking for, it fit perfectly. If he could pair it with Spandex for added flexibility, he would be able to make the perfect lightweight patrol suit. He would have to come back later for another suit, or perhaps go to another store, to make himself harder to track. He still wanted to work on a fire resistant suit, and fully intended to make one designed for sneaking, which seemed to be a bit of a requisite to deal with some of Gotham's villains.

Jason politely didn’t say anything as he grabbed two yards of dark grey spider silk, the small pile almost as light as air in his hands. It would cost a significant amount of money but, for some reason, the other boy seemed to expect him to have this kind of cash available. Maybe he really did think he was selling info and well... He wasn't exactly wrong. It had been a few days since he had seen Gordon. The man must be busy, with all the recent breakouts.

His coworker did raise an eyebrow when, instead of paying for his purchase, Peter walked past the counter and into the other half of the store, dedicated to more mundane material for clothes making or arts and crafts projects. He felt a cold sweat start to run down his back as he realized he would have to lie to explain why this wasn't enough. he still hadn't decided what his excuse would be, he had gotten sidetracked.

"Looking for something more?" He heard Jason ask, still following him nonchalantly, cardboard box under his arm.

Think fast, Peter.

The excuse left his mouth a bit too quickly for him to fully flesh it out, but he hoped speed would make him look more honest:

"I’m getting Spandex for a cosplay." He lied, remembering about one of the most famous superheroes of this universe, a man who used red and blue as his main colors. If he lied about dressing up as him for a convention, he could get away with grabbing his titular colors.

However, instead of clearing things out, his explanation only seemed to confuse his coworker more.

"Cosplay." Jason repeated, sounding like someone who had never heard the word before. Peter turned on his heels to squint up at him, walking backwards. To his surprise, the teen appeared earnest in his ignorance.

Somehow, and despite being from roughly the same generation as he was, he had no idea what cosplay was.

Did it not exist in this world?

"Dressing up as someone famous." He elaborated, waving his hands around to mimic a cape, although it looked more like he was brushing the air around his shoulders. "Like a hero. Like uh… Superman."

The name felt foreign on his tongue and he had to swallow the urge to replace it with something more familiar like Captain America or Iron Man.

This time, Jason’s eyes widened in understanding and he nodded thoughtfully, although he still appeared somewhat unsettled.

"That’s-" The boy shook his head. "I’ve heard of it before. I didn’t know that was what it was called." He sounded bitter and sad, with an undercurrent of rage.

"It’s pretty popular." Peter nodded. "I used to do it in New York." A lie. He hadn’t dressed up in a full costume since he was a child, at least in a costume that wasn’t a superhero one. Suiting up as a vigilante was close enough to the truth that he didn't feel overly guilty at his lack of honesty. Point being he hadn’t actually done any cosplay but, if he could make it seem like he had, it would explain away his ability to use a sewing machine. Maybe it might even get Jason off his back.

It wasn’t that he didn’t like spending time with the older teen, quite the opposite. It was extremely nice to have someone to talk to, even if they weren’t really close yet. Unfortunately the one thing they were currently bonding over might be one of the most dangerous subjects for him if he wanted to maintain a secret identity.

"Who did you dress up as before?" Jason asked, tone free of any judgement but still vaguely confused.

His question was perfectly innocent but it sent Peter’s brain spinning into a whirlwind of thoughts, panicking as he tried to remember the name of any hero that wasn’t Superman.

"Flash." He eventually blurted out, the red figure he had read about days ago in one of his books barely more than a hazy memory. What did he know about the guy? Anything that could make his claim of being a cosplayer more credible…

The only detail he could come up with was a pathetic: "I like red" which, while true, was also terribly inane and made him want to melt into the ground.

Blessedly, Jason must have been an angel in another life as, instead of laughing at his awkwardness, he smiled at him ruefully, eyes shining.

"I like red too." He grinned. "And Flash isn’t the worst person to dress up as."

Peter nodded, happy to have managed to get away with his lie. He was getting better at making up stories on the spot.

They ended up walking past a whole two shelves of hero cosplay supplies, several of which made Jason pause. He appeared the most disturbed by a drawer full of do it yourself Robin costumes, poking some of them with the tip of his knife, a dubious expression on his face.

"Everything okay?" Peter asked him, already selecting several yards of blue and red Spandex for his first project. It was significantly less expensive than the silk, which made him relax a bit. He would still have more than enough for some homeware and food for weeks.

"I-…" His neighbor sounded choked up, not from emotion but rather from disbelief. "I never realized how this looked."

A pile of fabric in hand, the New Yorker walked over to peer at the costume in question. While the materials were raw and untouched, a large picture showcased what the outfit looked like once finished. It was a garish mess of red, yellow and green, dubbed "Second Robin outfit" by a bold line of words painted above it. the boy modelling it was posing with one leg up in the air, as if in the middle of a kick, a bright smile on his face, his eyes hidden behind a dark domino mask. It made him think of Nightwing, but the man had been the very first to take on the cape next to the Bat, not the second one.

"Second Robin?" Peter read, tilting his head to the side. He vaguely remembered reading about the sidekick during his first few days in this new universe. Unfortunately, sleep deprivation and hunger had caused most of his first week in Gotham to remain as nothing more than a hazy blur in his mind. Of it, he remembered the grief the most.

"Yeah." Jason sighed. "That was a while back."

There was a venom in his words, one that was surprising to hear coming from him. So far he had appeared to be reckless and distrustful but not downright hateful like he sounded now. Whoever Robin was, however many of them there had been, it sounded like the teen had an issue with the hero. It made him slightly uncomfortable and he shuffled on his feet, hoping his uneasiness would be mistaken for hunger or anything that wasn't the slight apprehension of a vigilante in hiding trying to make friend with someone who might hate his fellow heroes. 

"Well uh- I’m all done." Peter cleared his throat, nodding at the pile in his arms. The whole of it was so light yet it was worth almost a thousand dollars. 

All things considered, despite how dangerous it had been, he didn’t regret competing in the underground rink. At least now he had money to buy what he needed. At this rhythm he would be able to go back on patrol sooner than expected, which he couldn’t wait for. He was itching to get back out on the streets.

"Let’s go then." Jason sighed, tearing his gaze away from the garish outfit.

They payed for their purchase separately but Peter’s enhanced hearing allowed him to hear clear as day that, although it wasn’t worth quite as much that his stab proof spider silk, his neighbor’s metal plates cost him several hundred dollars. Like him, he had to have another source of income to be able to afford this kind of purchase. He felt a spike of discomfort rise up in his throat once again and he found himself hoping that he would never have to find himself facing his coworker while he was out as Spider-Man.

Or, maybe, he still had savings left. But, if that was the case, why would he have been living out in a container instead of renting a room somewhere?

Remember, he stole a bike from someone.

Maybe Jason was trying to avoid attention, stay low. But then, him getting a job as a delivery guy didn’t fully fit since he would have to be out and about…

Pieces of the puzzle were missing in his mind but he didn’t have time to dwell on it as he followed his new friend out of the store. His backpack was now full of several yards of fabric and his pockets were noticeably lighter, most of the money he had brought with him he had to leave behind at the counter. He was too excited about being able to go back out that he did not really mind.

"Anywhere else you need to be?" Jason called out, taking a box of cigarettes out of his jacket pocket and twirling a lighter in his other hand. In a smooth gesture, he plucked a stick out and lit it up, taking a long drag as it reached his lips. He smoked with the ease of a long time user

"Gardening." He replied. "I can go on my own though."

"Uh. Can’t say I know a place. Got an address?"

He shook his head, causing his coworker to grimace.

"Got a phone?" The older boy asked, cigarette smoldering between his fingers, ashes fluttering in the wind.

Peter cleared his throat in answer, looking away. He wished he could say yes, he really missed the ability to get online wherever he was, but that wasn’t exactly something he could lie about.

"Uh." Jason said, looking into his eyes, his face blank. There was something in the way he was staring at him… curiosity?

It was indeed very odd for someone their age not to have their own phone. Then, the person currently giving him a dubious look was also the one who apparently had not known what cosplay was until a few minutes prior.

"I can look it up." His neighbor eventually said, still looking at him oddly. True to his word, he flipped a phone out of his pocket. The thing had clearly seen better days: its screen was shattered in several places and its case was heavily scratched. It turned on immediately, though, and apparently found a store for them to go to almost right away.

"Mind if we stop on the way?" Jason asked, undoing the restraints against his bike, which they had just stopped in front of. "I’m hungry."

Peter, who lived in a constant state of hunger ever since he had lost access to May and the well supplied kitchen they shared, was happy to accept the offer. Groceries were on the lists of items he would have to get. That and something to allow him to cook while in his room. He had a few ideas of what might work but, as usual, he would have to adapt to what he could find in the Bowery's pawn shops. His own comfort was less important than his vigilante duties, it was only logical that the budget he assigned to it was smaller.

They ended up stopping at a nearby burger joint, the kind one would usually find in a city much smaller than Gotham. As odd as it appeared, the town seemed to favor independent businesses. Almost every store and restaurant he had come across in the northern peninsula had been small and not part of any big franchise. Of course, that wasn’t to say that brand names weren’t a thing in Gotham, that couldn’t be further from the case. Products still had brands on them. The places where they were sold at, though, tended to be individually owned. Maybe the constant danger of the gang violence and villain activity was enough to keep many big corporations down south, into the more stable parts of the city.

As he looked around the tiny dining room, Peter almost missed his cue to order. He absently picked a random hamburger combo, distracted by the mist that had started to rise outside, slowly swirling up in the air. It was pretty, in a gloomy, sad way... very much like the city itself.

They walked a few blocks down the street, pushing the bike along and keeping quiet, both absorbed in their own thoughts. He let Jason take the lead, following him until they stopped next to one of the many benches overlooking the bay. Despite its damaged paint, layers of it peeling down from the wood, it was sturdy and well made. A plaque indicated who had funded the project but it had been scratched over so many times that it was now impossible to figure out what it said. They sat down and he looked up towards the water. This far north, he could simply turn his head south and see the Gotham skyscrapers peak out from above the buildings and houses he had grown to know. It was odd to realize that, despite how often he swung in between buildings back in New York, Spider-Man had never travelled in between those ones.

He’d have to learn their layout all over again. It was exciting, as well as nostalgic.

"What took you to Gotham?"

Jason asked the question nonchalantly, while unwrapping his meal and swapping through his phone. Peter sputtered, taken by surprise. They had been silent so far, and he had expected them to remain that way. To give himself some time to think, he started picking at the paper around his burger, tearing it off in small chunks. Lying had never been one of his strong suits and Gotham was forcing him to get better at it.

Well… maybe he didn’t have to get too far from the truth. Having a basis of reality in the yarn he’d spin would hopefully help him keep his story straight.

Once he could delay his answer no more, his food now unwrapped on his lap, burger slowly cooling down as a chilly wind swirled around and past them. His voice felt rougher than he had intended it to be, and he couldn't help but frown as he replied, a bitter taste in his mouth:

"I made mistakes, tried to help too many people."

Jason snorted at that, although there was no animosity on his face. If anything, he seemed to be reminiscing about his own experiences.

"Didn’t work out?" The young man had already finished his sandwich in a few large bites and was now plucking fries out of his bag, occasionally throwing one or two at nearby seagulls.

Peter shook his head, his appetite slowly disappearing as memories trickled back into his mind. Events he had tried to forget, people he missed terribly… all rushed back at him and it took all he had not to break down.

He still had to wait a few seconds before replying, his voice too shaky to let him speak properly.

"No. My aunt-"

He hadn’t planned to talk about May, originally, but mentioning his mistakes made it all come back. The fire, the sirens, her lifeless eyes as he realized that this was it, she was gone.

He didn’t know how long he had stayed silent, was only vaguely aware of the fact that Jason had stopped moving and was now staring at him, frozen in place. Tears welled up in his eyes and he had to lower his head to swallow them back. It still hurt. It had only been a bit more than two weeks since he travelled universes, since he left everything and everyone he knew behind. It felt like months had passed, with how much he had to go through, but right now he could believe that it had only been a few minutes ago. His chest throbbed with each breath.

"Shit dude."

Jason’s voice cut through the fog of pain, anchoring him to the present. He latched onto his presence to distract himself from the void, the utter loneliness he felt trapped in. Peter’s throat slowly relaxed as he listened to his friend speak.

"I’ve also messed up pretty bad…" The teen was saying. "Honestly now I don’t know if I regret it or not."

"Same." He found himself laughing bitterly, remembering what they had accomplished together with his other selves, and what they had to sacrifice for it to happen.

He took a first bite of his burger, hoping the taste would distract him from his bitter thoughts. It didn’t, feeling like plastic in his mouth, like cold worms on his tongue. For a moment, he almost spit it out but hunger was still a bitter, recent memory. He couldn’t bring himself to waste food like that and, eventually, he pushed himself to eat more. 

"I guess you can’t really ever come to Gotham for a sweet, wholesome reason." Jason mused darkly, finishing up the rest of his meal and crumpling the paper bag it had been stored in into a ball.

Peter didn’t want to keep talking about his aunt, his past and his failures. He tried to change the subject, grabbing onto the first question he could think of:

"So why did you come back then?"

He came off as more blunt than he had wanted to be and had to hide his blush into the rest of his sandwich.

Jason wasn’t offended by his attitude, however, and instead leaned back, eyes tilting up towards the sky. He sighed, rubbing his short black hair wearily.

"I guess I have unfinished business." He eventually replied. "I didn’t exactly leave because I wanted to."

Peter was about to ask more questions, but one look at his coworker immediately changed his mind. The older boy’s face had paled slightly, and he could see beads of sweat start to roll down his forehead. Just like him, Jason had some dark memories haunting him. Oddly, it made him feel a bit less alone. They probably didn’t even share the same struggles but at least he wasn’t completely on his own.

Neither of them talked as he finished his fries, the silence in between them only cut by the screams of neighboring birds, who tried to steal crumbs off of their laps.

"Sorry." Peter mumbled when they stood up to head back to the bike. "I didn’t mean to-"

"It’s no big deal." Jason talked over him, raising a hand to calm him down. "I guess I’m sorry too. About your aunt."

He spoke gruffly and looked away during most of it, but his tone was earnest. The words tore at Peter’s soul despite it all, but he took them with a smile. A small, sad one sure, but it was better than breaking down and crying.

He felt a light tap on his shoulders, a friendly gesture. With a start, he looked up at Jason, who grinned at him, pointing to his motorcycle.

"Let’s go. Gotta drop you off and then I have to run."

True to his word, the young man drove him down a few streets, leaving him in front of a small seeds and fertilizer store. It was in a surprisingly good shape for Gotham, its proximity to the GCPD headquarters was likely the reason it survived so long.

Peter watched the motorcycle speed away after he stepped away from it. The afternoon had barely started, he still had a lot of time before it was night.

He sighed, trying to clear his head from the last remnants of grief that still haunted him. MJ always told him talking about his problems would help him get better mentally, but it did not feel that way currently. If anything, talking about May and the events around her death had made him feel significantly sadder than if he simply hadn’t mentioned it.

Even days, weeks after the fact, just remembering that night was enough to disturb him to the point of tears.

At least he hadn’t been alone that time, and that had helped him keep it together. He hoped he hadn’t scared Jason off with his erratic behavior. Losing his one shot at friendship would be disheartening, especially now that he was starting to think the two of them might have more in common that what he had originally expected.

With a sigh, Peter stepped inside of the gardening store, the scents of soil, compost and fertilizer overpowering his senses almost instantly.

All of those worries would have to be solved later. Right now, he needed to focus on finding the right mix for his plant.

Hopefully, this place would have what he needed. He had a feeling that getting on Ivy’s bad side was a terrible idea.
Notes:

    This was a hard chapter to write. Got it done, hated it so I rewrote it, then hated it again. Then my wrist bone decided to displace itself and once it got better i rewrote it all again for the third time.

    I still dont like it much but im just excited to write action scenes again so here you go T-T im just happy to be able to type again.

    (also that spider silk thing is inspired by a real thing i think biosteel was the name? or golden spider silk one or the other)

Chapter Text

The small bag of soil and box of fertilizer tea he carried back to his apartment were significantly heavier than his newly bought suit materials, and they barely weighed anything as he trotted on the roofs of Old Gotham. It still made his head spin a bit, thinking about how much money he had spent a couple hours earlier. He had everything he needed for his first suit but if he wanted to make another one with similar materials, he would have to fight again, or sell a lot of very good intel to Gordon to be able to afford it. He looked forward to neither but knew he was bound to end up doing both, with how things had been going for him.

You made those choices yourself. Take responsibility for your actions, Peter.

The voice in his mind was a bitter mixture of May and Ben with some hints of MJ. Only the latter was still alive but he knew that all three would have told him this. The memory made him feel slightly better, especially since the words were reassuring in a way. He had made the choices that had lead him to where he was now, him, nobody else. He would be the one to decide how he would get out of it, no matter how much work he would have to accomplish to make sure of it. He could see how the fighting ring could be useful to him, same for his relationship with the Commissioner. He could also see the dangers involved in both of them, now he only had to keep clear of them.

If only it was this easy...

Shaking his head, he pushed away the gloom that had started to spread in his mind. Instead, he tried to focus on the roofs he was running on, the small, cramped alleyways he was leaping above. He made sure never to be seen jumping too far but free running, even when trying to keep within human limitations, had always allowed him to clear his mind. Sports had always played that role to him, that and crafting projects, whether they be digital or physical. Once he got into his zone he often found himself focusing so intently that he lost track of everything except what he was doing. Sound helped and, for the first time, he remembered about the loss of his earbuds. He missed listening to music when he was running and off duty. Not only did it help soothe his mind but it also kept away some of the noise he always heard around him. The sounds of the city, sometimes dull rumbles, sometimes screeches, barks, moans, thumps... It all got a bit overwhelming, sometimes.

With or without earbuds, it only took a few minutes of running for him to slip into a comfortable emptiness, all his focus on the path in front of him, on keeping his strength and speed in check. He ran a few steps up a small wall, leading to a slightly higher building, just few enough to be believable, and leaped up, pushing with his work boots, reaching up and hoisting himself up on another roof. As soon as his feet hit the stone arch that decorated the gothic building, he sprung again, dashing with the wind against his back, pushing him, making him faster, faster...

By the time he stopped in front of his window, he was grinning widely and his eyes were shining back at him on the glass. He carefully slipped inside, checking on his plant first thing to make sure the cold air seeping into the room hadn't damaged it. It felt cool to him so he resolved to repot it as soon as possible, into the slightly larger gardening jar he had gotten. It had small holes at the bottom to drain excess water so he had to complement it with a small hard clay plate. They hadn't been expensive, thankfully for his quickly disappearing stash of money.

Before he started on this new task, he locked up his windows and went to check on the Iron Spider, hidden in a bundle under his folded clothes. None of the wrinkles on his shirts or pants looked different than the ones he remembered from the last time he had shoved it inside. Nobody had been through his things. He sighed in relief, shoulders sagging slightly, and turned back towards Ivy's present. With as much care as he could, he took the tiny thing out of its equally tiny pot, using his spider abilities as much as he could to make sure he didn't tear anything, moving with extreme precision.

It seemed to take hours but it was only a few minutes before his plant was tucked into its new pot, now looking even smaller than before, swallowed by the larger space. It would grow into it, if the articles he had read online were accurate.

And then what? Would he have to get a new pot or would it eventually stop getting bigger?

And what was he supposed to do with the pot the plant had come with? Did Ivy want it back? It was probably safer to clean it and hand it back to her next time he saw her but-... what if she thought it meant he accidentally killed the plant? He just wanted to give it more space, not put himself in danger. This place was so difficult to navigate, he had no idea if a misstep with his fellow metahuman would lead to violence or simply to indifference on her part. She had treated him like a fly stuck to the bottom of her heels. He didn't know if it was any better than the way Harley treated him, as if he was one of her dearest friends despite them barely knowing each other.

He tried his best to ignore his anxiety, sitting on the ground in the center of his room and unpacking the rest of his bag. The two bundles of fabric ended up in front of him and he stared at them intently, twisting his hands into knots.

Well.

That was awkward.

Up until now he had been so focused on working on blueprints, scrapping components off of the Iron Spider and acquiring materials and funds that he had not really thought about how he would make his suit.

Now, Peter wasn't a beginner at sewing. He had spent many many hours learning how to work different types of fabric with May, silk included, and he had learned from Tony how to repair and upgrade different, thicker materials like leather or metal. He had always worked supervised, however, and he had never gotten to truly make and lead his own project until the end of the Thanos situation, until Tony...

He bit his lip, hard. Blood spurted in his mouth, drying up as fast as it had come out, the small cut already mending himself. He breathed out, running a trembling hand through his hair. It was starting to grow long enough to flop down on his forehead, but he had no budget to pay for a haircut, and no aunt to do it for him for free.

Remembering about his dead loved one would not help him right now. For the time being, he had to figure out how to make a skintight suit from scratch without the help of Stark technology, and without May there to give him advice, not that she often did when it came to suits. His counterparts had been able to make their own so it made sense that he would be able to as well... Sure his first and only attempt at making a vigilante outfit on his own looked more like a strange kind of streetwear than a superhero body armor, but he had learned a lot since then.

He eyed the spider silk and gulped, sweat beading on his forehead. It had been really expensive. He had used silk before, and he had drawn patrons but...

Maybe he should make himself a Spandex outfit first, just to make sure-...

No! He didn't have time for that. He needed to get ready to go out and Spandex alone would not cut it in Gotham unless he wanted it to end up slashed to pieces every night. But... if he messed up, he would have to pay for the silk again, and he didn't have components for his web yet. He needed to think about that. Money was quickly drying up.

With a heavy sigh, Peter dragged himself towards his mattress, snatching his laptop and settling it on his lap as he sat there cross-legged. He quickly created himself an account to the most popular video website in this dimension, which was a very similar yet different version of the one he knew from back home, and created a new playlist, feeling a bit discouraged at the amount of information he knew he was going to have to absorb. He had to learn years worth of skill in only a few days. At least, he would be able to follow a sped up video, which should help make it go a bit quicker.

[NEW PLAYLIST : SUPER HERO SUIT COSPLAY TUTORIALS]

At least, if Jason ever ended up coming into his apartment, he could now leave the laptop open and back up his claim that he was working on cosplay. After all, even someone competent in one domain could still learn and he definitely was not very competent when it came to making a skintight, good looking suit without the assistance of Stark Tech. It would also no doubt take longer to finish, even with his enhanced speed and precision. He allowed himself a few seconds to mourn the loss of his high tech equipment, which would have made the task ahead of him significantly easier.

The rest of the afternoon was spent in a blur of information, schematics and notes he managed to scribble on one of his notebooks, hanging from his ceiling by the tip of two of his fingers, slowly swinging around the room. He was lacking a lot of what he needed for the finer details of his outfit. The dark webbing he was used to sporting, for example, would require a lot of very precise work, and likely a lot of time and mistakes with it, to complete. He would not be able to use silk or Spandex for him, but something more rigid.

What if that was were he put some of the Iron Spider’s components? He had looked over many of the files recovered from the micro drives and had started to repair some of the scanner subroutines but he had not yet found any programming regarding the nanobots, which he thought would fit perfectly as a pattern on his suit, ready to be deployed whenever needed. As long as he kept them secure in the pods, they would fear very little. He just had to steer clear of fire. And explosions. And lasers. Gotham was dangerous but surely not every villain would be carrying around a small arsenal.

It would all be so much easier if he had managed to find anything related to Tony’s AI. Unfortunately, either the information he was looking for was in a drive he hadn’t scanned yet or it was too damaged for him to make sense of it. Either way, he had to stick to what he had available to him right now. The situation in Gotham looked to be worsening by the day and Spider-Man simply could not afford to lay low any longer.

His eyes wandered over to his red locker, in which he kept the remains of his old suit, and a few box containing all the nano pods he had salvaged from it. He did know some basic robot programming, and had worked with machine learning and AI in particular alongside Tony. In fact, those were the fields he was the most comfortable in, when it came to robotics. He simply had to, especially after the death of his mentor. He and Ned were the only people he knew of who were able to change the behavior of his bots, and it was the single area in which he considered himself as skilled, if not more, than his friend.

Peter Parker might not have been able to hack into a government agency, not yet at least, but he could program a thousand different ways for his bots to act and, on top of that, make it so they would learn and adapt each time they were taken out. That would have to be enough.

He started thinking about what he would need to write for the nanobots to deploy from his suit’s web design and, surprisingly, he found that he felt able to do it. More astonishingly, he was confident he could accomplish it on his own. He dropped down in a crouch, landing on his toes next to his mattress. With a grin, he turned off the tutorial videos and started brainstorming, taking notes and putting down burgeons of ideas, testing out some lines. He had a lot of thinking to do, he had decide what languages to use, how he would mix them together, how much machine learning he wanted to put in and how much pre-written behavior…

It seemed to him that barely a few minutes had passed since he started typing away but, to his surprise, he was soon interrupted by a knock at the door. Jason, his ears and nose told him.

Closing his laptop, Peter slipped on his boots and his jacket, reminding himself that he was supposed to be injured. Once he had repeated the thought half a dozen times or so, he took a deep breath and unlocked his apartment, flashing his neighbor a bright welcoming smile.

Said smile faded quickly, replaced by a confused frown when he noticed what his (hopefully) new friend was doing. On Jason’s shoulder, held there with ease as if it had not weighed anything at all, was a mannequin.

Not a mannequin you would see in a store, no, one you would see in a workshop, adjustable in several ways, from tightness of the chest to height. He had never seen one from so close, but had sometimes spotted a couple at the back of a fabrics store, when visiting them with his aunt. Peter blinked when the older teen set it down in front him.

"Thought I’d get you one." Jason grumbled. "Got a place I used to make stuff at. Had two of those." He crossed his arms in front of him, raising his chin as if to dare him to say anything.

Peter ignored the threatening look, thanking him profusely. From what he could see behind the man, a pile of boxes and another similar mannequin, he was indeed moving equipment into his room. So that was what he had been doing all afternoon, getting his furniture back from wherever he had stored it. Maybe, before he left Gotham, he had an apartment or a house in the area.

"Was this all in the containers?" He asked, too curious to worry about appearing nosy. If his coworker could keep all of that hidden out in town, he was even more savvy than what he had first suspected.

"This?" Jason shot a quick glance behind his shoulders. "No. Some places in town don’t get used so much anymore, it’s easy to snag a spot there."

Peter nodded thoughtfully. As an outsider, he didn’t know that much about the Gotham districts he hadn’t visited yet. What would make someone abandon their home, if the people here could still be fine living in the Bowery and Crime Alley? He shuddered slightly, thinking about the pain those poor civilians would have no doubts gone through.

"Yeah." The older boy agreed, mistaking his discomfort for fear. "Not going there if I can help it. This place’s pretty sweet, the owner is very skilled."

The New Yorker did not need to ask what skill exactly their landlady possessed. If there were so many criminals using this building as a safe house, it was more than obvious that the woman was very good at staying under the authorities’ radar. This was likely the main reason that brought people to her in the first place. Not for the first time, he wondered how Marco had met such a person. The man was surprisingly well connected, for a small time business owner. Perhaps it was a necessity here, to survive one had to cooperate and know people in the underworld. it would be in line with everything else he had learned about Gotham.

"Anyways, you’ll need one for your … cosplay." The word sounded foreign to him but he said it anyways, testing it out with a frown.

They lifted the mannequin together, Peter struggling not to make it obvious that he could have carried it on the tip of one of his fingers. After settling it down in front of his still cluttered desk, he offered to help his neighbor store the rest of his belongings, which they did, mostly in silence.

Jason’s apartment was slightly larger than his, but just as sparsely furnished. A mattress laid on the ground, topped by a camping pad and with for blanket the sleeping bag he had seen in the man's container not so long ago. A walk-in closet, devoid of any door but as large as the bathroom it was right next to, was one of the main differences with his own room. It was still bare, save for a pair of muddy work boots, looking very similar to his own. As his gaze slid across the empty walls, he spotted a small TV, perhaps five or so years old in this universe. He distantly remembered having to chose between two different sets of furniture when he first moved in but, with everything that had happened, the memory was nothing more than a vague blur. It had only been a few weeks, but it felt like years had passed.

"Thanks dude." Jason told him earnestly, standing in the center of the room, looking at their handiwork. On top of the mannequin, they had added a half dozen or so boxes of varying sizes, as well as a large sewing machine, what looked like a case full of tools and a worn down leather punching bag.

Peter looked at the last item regretfully. He often wished he had a way to take out his frustration now that he wasn’t able to simply go out and swing between the skyscrapers anymore. A single punch from him however and this flimsy bag would burst open. Back in the day, he had the occasion to use a training room specifically made for the Avengers. Most of the furniture there had been able to handle him at half strength, and a few could take all of his might. That occasion had stayed a one time thing, however. Chaos had followed soon after that summer, and he never really had the time to go back there, nor the wish to, after Tony passed.

"You box?" Jason asked suddenly, looking excited. He was likely an adept of the sport, considering his enthusiasm. His build was also typical for a guy addicted to working out and that type of combat sports was extremely in character for the teen. Unlike him, he looked like a guy who would like to throw some punches around.

He shook his head, embarrassed.

"Sorry, no. I- uh… Some adults I know showed me some stuff but I never really-… I’ve been in street fights but-…" How did one explain that they spent most of their teenage years fighting crime as a masked vigilante? Not easily, that was how.

"I see." There was a brief pause, then: "I go to a gym nearby if you wanna try it out. Knowing some moves might be good if you wanna keep working nights."

Peter had a hard time finding an excuse to back out of it. He had been honest when saying he never really practiced, not in a club or a class at least. Although the Avengers had sometimes given him crash courses on self defense, he’d never studied a discipline properly. Of course, after spending so long fighting thugs and villains, he had picked up quite a few techniques, from all around the world -or at least all around NYC. His flexibility and strength helped him pull out pretty much anything he tried without much effort. He had never seen the need to spend hours practicing every week when, physically, he was superior to most people he came across.

However, that was back in his universe. Here, it seemed every villain was either extremely devious our had some sort of power. On top of that, Gotham had a plethora of bad guys, significantly more than what he had had to deal with back in New York.

"S-sure." He stuttered out. He would have to watch his strength and speed but learning some proper moves could only make him more efficient. Even if he didn’t pick up anything new, he needed some practice acting like a regular human. Having to slow down his punches and restrain himself would help him stay under the radar.

Jason’s smile did not quite reach his eyes, he could see it in the muscles around his temples and in the quirk of his mouth. He pretended not to notice, grinning back.

”Guess you’ll be showing me a lot." Peter noted self consciously, suddenly hoping he wasn’t annoying his new friend.

Thankfully, the friend in question only shrugged, then frowned and slid what looked like a very neat-up phone out of his pocket. He peered down at it and his frown turned into a full blown grimace.

"Shit." He said, eloquently. "We’re late."

Peter blinked, then started sweating profusely. He peered over at the screen, noticing the background: a picture of Gotham which appeared to have been taken from a vantage point over the city, and confirmed that, indeed, they only had ten minutes to get to work. Memories of barely making it to school, hair messy and shirt wrinkled, came back to him and he cringed. He didn't think that he would ever feel the very specific panic that came with being late to a class but adulthood never failed to disprove his hopes and dreams. Being stressed out about being late appeared to be something of a curse every human was saddled with.

They didn’t exchange another word while inside, rushing to exit the room and make their way downstairs, almost stomping a burly, mean looking woman as they did so. They reached the street in record time and Peter had the presence of mind to add a limp to his dash. It wasn't as hard as he had expected it to be: his coworker might be fit, but his running speed was less than a tenth of his own, if he really tried. He pretended to catch his breath while Jason freed his bike from the sarcophagus of chains and dangling locks he had secured around it.

It was only when they sped away that Peter realized he was about to experience yet another unfortunate instance of reckless driving. He couldn't keep from grimacing as the motorcycle swerved past a slow-moving truck, its tires looking about to roll away from under it. To his horror, the wild ride did not stop there and they ended up speeding around a good dozen or so vehicles, one of them a cop car. No chase started, unlike it might have back in New York. The GCPD had more important crimes to solve than traffic in this part of town. He hoped this wasn't true for every neighborhood, the death toll from vehicle crashes could be severe.

After a few minutes that felt like an eternity to him, they reached the restaurant. He jumped off the motorcycle as fast as he could, heart beating wildly. He was not scared for himself, a crash would likely leave him unscathed, but he couldn't say the same for his friend. Jason rode as if he did not care whether he lived or die and, incidentally, everyone else on the road was a second thought to him. He was extremely skilled, evidenced by the fact they hadn't ended up splattered against a wall or the back of a semi, but even the best of the best could slip. He had seen it happen before and he prayed that he wouldn't witness something similar again.

"Burn your tires yet?" Marco asked when they stepped in, his nose buried in an old school newspaper, the back of it covered in an add for a new burger chain comic to the city, "Big Belly Burger". Somehow, despite being black and white, it managed to look tacky. Their boss folded the piece of paper before he could study it any longer, staring at them blankly. "Heard you brake from behind a closed door."

Jason snorted, smirking at the older man, his eyes glaring daggers. "She can handle it." He sniffed, arms now crossed, fingers tight against his leather sleeves.

"Wouldn't want you to ruin the orders." Their boss' voice was cold, meeting his employee's defiance with calm confidence. "Reliability is key."

"Of course."

Peter, once again, started feeling deeply uncomfortable. Why did he have to get caught in between those two?

He sighed, glancing outside to try and gather his nerves before interrupting the two older men. Snow had started to fall once more, slowly fluttering to the ground, remaining light for now. He wondered if his jacket would be enough to keep the chill away, especially with the wind that always game alongside a bike ride. His neck itched slightly and he frowned, barely stopping himself from reaching up and scratching the sore spot. It was a distant, weak feeling but it was unmistakable. His mind slipped into calm almost immediately as he considered what dangers they might be likely to encounter. An ambush, perhaps? He hoped no villain would attack while they were out in the cold. His suit wasn't ready yet and he had forgotten his web shooters, not feeling like he would need them when helping Jason move in.

He took a deep breath and turned his gaze back to the two civilians. They were still glaring at each other, although Marco looked relaxed, and was even cracking open a can of beer, some of it fizzing and dripping down to the table.

"You guys better be careful." The man suddenly sighed, straightening up and taking a long gulp of his drink. "Some guy ordered a salad, don't bust the thing open."

"We won't." Peter hurriedly replied, grabbing the first opportunity he saw to dispel the hostility in the room. "We'll be careful."

"I know." Marco nodded, still frowning. "You have guns, right?" He was talking to Jason, who started and hesitantly nodded, looking wary. Their boss went on: "Good. Make sure you have one close. The city is weird tonight. Too silent."

As if on cue, the snow picked up in strength, wind slamming more and more forcefully against the building. The night was only getting started and, already, it looked like a storm was brewing.

The foreboding feeling did not leave him as the two of them gathered up everything they needed for their first round of deliveries, taking great care not to bump the cardboard bowl the salad was stored in. They stood in silence in front of the pizzeria for a tad longer than what was needed to put the first address in, both of them looking around uncomfortably. The city was indeed quiet, the restaurant street devoid of any gang activities, any and all of the usual groups of thugs and dealers having disappeared off to some other place. Maybe they were sheltering from the cold... But no. It wouldn't make sense, they had never avoided the elements before, not here in North Gotham. Marco was right, something unusual was going on.

"What do you think he meant?" Peter asked, fidgeting slightly, his neck now itching more noticeably. "Is this normal here? People leaving I mean. Not being there.”

Jason looked up from the lock he was opening, face hard but lip twitching ever so slightly. Not in amusement, he realized, in anxiety. "It does happen." He replied after a beat. "They call it withdrawing. Or hiding out."

"From what?"

His friend stood up, chains gathered up in his arms then stored away inside the hidden compartment on the bike. "Each other, I guess. They do it when they get a tip one of them is planning something dangerous."

"So they work together." Peter grimaced.

"Not... Not really." Jason frowned, rubbing the back of his head wearily. "The guys speak to each other. In whorehouses-" The language made Peter flinch. "-or in bars. Places like that, you know. They get a feel of when shit is about to go down."

"And- you think… tonight?" He shifted on his feet, uncertain. "But Marco sent us out."

"You heard him. Reliability is key." He sounded bitter but resigned. "Gotham has been pretty quiet lately, it only means there’s a shitstorm brewing."

"And it’s gonna hit tonight."

"Maybe."

He really hoped it would not. He had barely gotten his hands on the materials he needed, his suit was days away from being functional. On impulse, he asked Jason for a helmet, hoping it would at least help him keep a semblance of anonymity if trouble was indeed brewing. He wouldn’t hide away from his responsibilities. If he had to go out without his suit to save people, he would do it. He would try to be sneaky about it, but he would still do it.

To his surprise, his coworker did not dig the helmet he asked for out of his numerous bike compartments and instead ducked inside the restaurant. Apparently, he didn’t want to have to carry it around every night just in case. Up until then, Peter had assumed he wanted nothing to do with Marco, and now it looked like he trusted him enough to keep some of his belongings there. Gothamites truly were odd people.
No matter. He slid the black helmet on, grimacing as it limited his field of view in a way that was very much unlike his own mask. It was bulky and smelled of dust but he kept it tight, hoping the fact his Spider sense had been rather weak throughout the evening was a sign they wouldn’t really be in danger. Perhaps they would get into a crash. He almost hoped they would, if that meant he had more time to get his suit ready before having to face anyone.

"The wind is cold," was the only explanation he managed to give Jason as they settled on the bike. His friend shrugged but he could tell by the tension in his shoulder and the sound of his heart that he, too, felt uneasy. He didn’t call out his obvious lie, however, letting it slide gracefully, as he often did.

They drove off in silence, going at a much slower pace than usual. Both of them peered down every alley they passed and stared at every shadows. Some people were still out, despite what Marco had said. A few poor souls shivered under streetlights, wearing too thin clothes and haggard expressions. He wished he had scarves or gloves to give them but his jackets and boots were the only things sheltering him from the snow. They passed them in silence, plunging back into the blizzard and the darkness as they left them behind, hopefully not to freeze to death.

The first few addresses they visited housed civilians, who thanked them profusely but hurriedly, closing the door as fast as possible once money changed hands. Most payed online but some still insisted on using cash the old fashioned way. Perhaps, like Peter, it was the only kind of currency they owned. He accepted everything politely, making most of the conversation while his friend watched the streets worriedly, hands tight against his leg, sometimes turning into fists.
An odd mood seemed to have spread to the whole town, but no one appeared able to find out what exactly was wrong. The only thing he himself knew was that he was uncomfortable, and that everyone else appeared to be as well. Every second they spent standing still in one place, his discomfort grew.

Their third delivery took them to a winding alley in the Bowery, far enough away from any source of light that they were both tense by the time they reached the drop off point. Behind the door, he could hear the shuffling of boots and the clicks of weapons, both common noises in this part of town. His Spider sense did not itch any more than it had earlier, neither did it break into full tingles as it would when he was about to encounter something truly dangerous. He still determined to be careful, hopping off the motorcycle smoothly, and making his way towards the building. If he kept his back to his coworker, perhaps he could remain inconspicuous even while using superhuman strength.

"Take off the helmet." Jason reminded him, grabbing his arm to stop him from knocking on the door.

Remembering he was supposed to introduce his coworker to the underworld, Peter nodded and tried his best to smooth his hair down, helmet tucked under one of his arms. He managed to comb a few curls out with his fingers when a couple men cracked the door open, peering at them suspiciously. They held weapons behind their backs, he could smell their discomfort in their sweat. He didn’t recognize the logo on their jackets, one of the city’s gang no doubt. He smiled innocently, praying they wouldn’t force him to use force against them.

"T, come here." He heard one of them whisper. "That the kid?"

More voices came from inside, then shuffling and creaking. He glanced back at Jason, who probably hadn’t heard anything but was as tense as he felt, frowning with his own helmet held in in his hand, his other under his jacket, ready to draw a weapon.

A chill ran down his spine but his neck did not tingle. He stayed tense, ready to spring into action if needed. First, he thought, he would have to drop the helmet somewhere soft, then he could follow it with a kick to the legs or-

"It’s him yeah." A rough voice replied, equally quiet. He closed his fingers into fists, stuffed them in his pockets, tried to calm his nerves.

The door opened wider but, instead of guns, the two of them were met with the pale face of a man who looked like he wanted to be anywhere but where he currently was. The poor guy cleared his throat shakily, then accepted the pizza box and all but threw a few fifty dollar bills at them. Both Jason and him watched as the wood frame slammed shut before the money even touched the ground. They exchanged a look, frowning.

Peter knew why the men had reacted that way of course, but he did his best to appear innocent, playing up his confusion by asking his friend if he had known those strange people. He knew the answer before the question left his mouth but he still pretended to listen intently. He did not feel proud to be acting so deceitful. Gotham had changed him. It had only been a few weeks and already he was behaving in a way that would have made his past self ashamed. He had lied before, but he never liked outright manipulation, no matter the context.

His little act did allow him to leave the place without raising his friend’s suspicion and he couldn’t help but feel relieved at that thought. Jason seemed like a good guy: even if he acted tough most of the time, he had helped him out enough times for him to see that, deep down, he was kind. He didn’t have to drive him to work or to get him a mannequin for sewing, yet he did. Of all people, he wanted that one innocent civilian tangled up in his vigilante business the least.

By their sixth delivery, he had started to relax slightly. So far, everyone had been behaving in the same way: shoving tips in their face and heading back inside as quickly as they could.
Nonetheless, the streets were stiller than they had ever been, everyone outside smelling and sounding like they wanted nothing more than to be back between four walls, safe from the cold and whatever else was brewing that night. Whenever they crossed a civilian, they quickened their pace or ducked into the shadows, not wanting to attract attention from whoever was driving outside in such a night.

Their seventh delivery led them somewhere that forced both of them to perk up. Instead of a house or even a squat, Jason stopped in front of a dark, empty shopping mall. At least five stories tall, it towered over a parking lot that, according to the sign in front of it, went down to ten levels into the earth. It was one of the more put together places he had had the opportunity to see in this part of Gotham, and it still looked ancient and damaged.

"The old mall." His friend’s voice was almost a growl, full of an inexplicable anger-… or was it bitterness? "That’s one of their-…" The young man shook his head, gritting his teeth. As they slowed down next to the delivery point, he had taken off his helmet but he settled it back on his head, clenching his fists rhythmically, as if wishing he could punch something. Peter thought about imitating him but, before he could decide, a whooshing sound made him look up sharply, then gasp.

Up there, falling down from the top of the building-… no-… jumping down from the top of the building, was a child. He recognized the outfit distantly, even if the colors were slightly different from the ones he had seen earlier in the day. He felt torn between consternation and horror.

This was a child. A little, small, tiny child.

The kid landed softly in front of them, straightening up smoothly, apparently so used to such theatrical entrances he did not expect them to react. Peter didn’t stop himself from gaping openly, however. He thought he had been young starting vigilantism at fourteen and, in the back of his mind, he had known Robin was twelve, perhaps thirteen at most. But thirteen hadn’t been so far away from his own age when he had started out. This one child could not be older than ten years old. Not only that but he exuded a cool calm so distinct from his physical appearance that, instantly, he knew the boy had been through a horrific, horrific event, if not events plural. There was no other reason for someone so small to act so coolly, to seem so confident standing there, alone in the dark in one of the most dangerous parts of town.

He did not know the Bat, he did not know the city really, not yet. However, he found himself hating both of them suddenly. They sent a kid out to fight. Someone who was even younger than he had been. This wasn’t right.

"Your salad." His voice seemed distant, disconnected from his mind somehow. It was as if his mouth was being controlled by a separate entity, a stranger or perhaps a robot.

He mechanically handed the bowl to the boy, who took it just as distractedly. He was staring behind Peter and straight at Jason who, his helmet still on, had stayed standing next to his bike, hand trailing one of the compartments hidden along its body. His shoulders were tense but his knees were slightly bent, ready to jump, to run…

"Pizza delivery." Robin said suddenly. There was a slight accent to his voice, audible despite the buzz that attempted to disguise the true sound of it. Perhaps it worked for humans whose meta abilities did not involve enhanced hearing. "You do pizza delivery." He appeared stunned, for some inexplicable reason. By now, the word should have spread that the pizzeria was back in business.

"We do." Peter nodded, "and salad!" He awkwardly pointed down at the bowl the boy now held. They both looked at it silently and, for the first time, he noticed the kid was wearing the same kind of domino mask as Nightwing.

He couldn’t blame the first Robin for not seeing anything wrong with sending a ten year old out to fight men with guns, the vigilante probably had been in the same situation at the same age. He did blame the city and the Bat for letting it happen, and he hoped there was a very good reason for them letting this kind of things go on under their watch. There had to be a good reason, he hoped. There had to.

Robin and him stared at the salad in silence for a moment longer then the boy looked back up, this time at him.

"Do you have utensils?" He asked, his politeness dripping with condescension. Flushing with embarrassment, Peter hastily shoved a plastic knife and fork in his hand, croaking out an apology. How was this tiny kid managing to make him feel worthless?
It was in the way the boy held himself, the slight drawl in his tone. He looked more composed and civilized than he had ever felt in his life, and he was too young to be in high school.

The kid sniffed at him and pointedly turned back to Jason, the eye slits of his domino mask suddenly sliding closer together, reminding him of his own mask. Well. His former mask. Whoever had made it had a taste for the dramatic, which he could appreciate.

"Interesting vehicle." Robin said, crossing his thin arms in front of his chest. He puffed his chest, as if to appear more threatening, but it only served to make him look even younger.

Despite his young age, Peter could see a few scars peaking from under his gloves, rugged pink lines that looked like they had been gotten in battle, or perhaps in a severe accident. His skin was a few tones darker than his too, making the scars stand out starkly. He memorized every detail in the same distant way he had spoken. He still felt shock rattling through him and, once again, he shivered. They sent a ten year old out to fight the kind of criminals he saw every night. Men like Firefly. Women like Orca. This just was not right.

"Let's go, kid." His coworker told him, snapping him out of his horrified daze. Unlike him, the older teen did not seem concerned by the fact one of the active vigilante of the city was younger than a middle schooler. Under the artificial street lamps, it was hard to tell if his composure was fake.

Jason ignored the glaring child and grabbed his arm, tugging him towards the bike. The boy behind them tightened his gaze further and bared his teeth in a snarl, visibly offended by the way he was being treated. He didn’t say a word, however, watching them retreat with tightened fists. In a tense silence, they climbed on the motorcycle and drove away as soon as their feet left the ground, leaving him quivering with rage but helpless to stop them.

Jason took them through a maze of dark, winding street, ignoring Peter when he tried to tell him where their next, and last, delivery was. Instead of heading to the address their client had given, they went in circles, loops and through unpaved, muddy streets. A few times, they stopped and waited for a dozen seconds before driving off again. 

It took a while for him to understand why they were wasting time going around in circles but, once he did, he started glancing around anxiously, tugging at the hem of his jacket with trembling hands. Now was not the time to get involved with a clan of vigilantes he did not know if he wanted to associate with yet. For all he knew, they might all be secretly villains. Nightwing probably wasn't one, but he had been indoctrinated as a child and-...

He took a deep breath. He didn't know the bats or their ways. There could be a reason behind Robin being out like this at his age. There had to be one, in fact. Batman was a good guy, that's what his research told him. He tugged at his sleeves, wishing once more for his suit to be functional.

They slowed down and stopped next to a dark, old stone house, its walls ornate and sporting large stone gargoyles. Jason parked the bike under one of them, making them melt into the shadows. The engine quietened smoothly and they stayed still for a moment, listening intently. The snow had started to form a soft layer on the ground, muffling noises and making it feel like they were somewhere smaller, more private.

"Do you think he'll follow us?" Peter eventually asked, checking the roofs over them for any footsteps but hearing none. "I don't think he is."

His friend turned his head, eyes unreadable under his helmet.  "I don't want to take chances." He sighed, then punched the air in front of him, fists shaking slightly. "Look P- ...kid... you don't want to get involved with the Bats. Trust me. Nothing good comes out of it."

"I-..." He found words failing him and, after opening and shutting it a few time silently, he closed his mouth with a snap. His usually composed neighbor had an edge of panic in his voice, and on his skin, under the artificial scent of the helmet, was something that smelled a lot like anger. Without his enhanced senses, he would never have noticed it but, with him being able to hear the older boy's erratic heartbeat, his unease was obvious. He truly believed what he was saying. More than that, he was afraid of the bats, somehow.

"Some of them are alright." Jason said, spitting the sentence out grudgingly. "But in general good things don't happen around them. It's just-" He hissed, this time seemingly more in frustration than anger. "They're dangerous people to know."

"Do you know them?" His curiosity betrayed his good sense once again and he winced at his own bluntness. It was too late to back out however, and it looked like they were going to hide out in the shadows for a while longer.

"Most people know them." His friend sighed. "You kinda have to eventually run into one of them if you live here. Can’t say I really know that one, but I really don’t want to risk it."

He looked about to add something more, his shoulders tensing in the way they did when he was out of his comfort zone but, as he slowly straightened up, a loud rumble made both of them look up sharply, cutting him off. A foreboding silence stretched for a while, snowflakes floating down gently in the quietness, making the moment feel that much more eery. Peter swallowed, a hard lump in the back of his throat. His neck itched badly, he had to consciously stop himself from reaching up, not wanting to attract attention to himself.

A strange howl cut through the uneasy call. Not human, it creaked on the edges like metal bending or perhaps a building groaning, about to collapse. Sinister cracks and bangs followed the noise, coming from a few streets away on their left. A deep roar, making the ground under the motorcycle tremble almost imperceptibly, echoed against the houses surrounding them. They both turned in that direction, although it was impossible to see anything, with the snow, the wind and the shadows. They would have to get closer to find out what was happening, but he didn’t want to involve his coworker.

Perhaps he could get him to drop him off somewhere? He was about to ask when he felt the man in front of him shift, leaning forward slightly.

Wordlessly, Jason kicked his bike to life, heading towards the rumbling, his heart sounding steadier than what what would be expected in this situation. He did not seem to hesitate as he sped into the night, not slowing down as they swerved abruptly to the left, now only a few blocks away from the origin of the tremors. Peter could feel the air get heavier, although it was hard to smell anything with his nose blocked by his visor.

The wind was loud, slapping their helmet with wave after wave of billowing snowflakes. Their jackets glistened with frost and humidity and, under them, the tires squealed with every tight turn taken, sometimes skidding worryingly on what could only be black ice. Somehow, no matter how badly frozen the road was, it never fully slipped out of control. Robin had been right, this was an extremely interesting vehicle. Whoever had been its first owner, they must have even more money, or brains, than what he had first estimated.

Crashes and screeches mixed together in a disturbing rhythm, the first coming ever closer to them as they rode. The second, however, started behind them and slowly echoed further away in the city, strangely haunting. They did not sound human but he did not think dogs could make such a sound. He turned several times on his seat, trying his best to make out the source of the shrill cries but never managed to. Whatever was making those sounds, it was nowhere close to them, which made it all the more worrying that they could hear so many different ones and from so far away. None came from the source of the rumbling, thankfully. He did not feel like he wanted to find out what was causing that second disturbance, not when he still hadn’t discovered what was happening in the first place.

Clutching the sides of the bike, Peter wondered why his coworker felt the need to head there. He was a vigilante so, even without his suit, he himself felt a responsibility to go check what had happened, to help. At least, he could keep his helmet on. If anyone saw him doing anything odd, or worse, caught him on tape, his identity would be somewhat protected. His heart pounded in his chest as he remembered Firefly. he found himself hoping he wouldn't have to fight anyone. He wasn't ready. Not yet.

The bike slowed as they reached a darker spot in the town, a block where seemingly all lights had vanished. It was too cloudy for the moon to help much but he thought he could see what looked like billowing plumes of dust and smoke swirl on the ground as they passed.  His blood froze in his veins when they rounded on the street the sounds had originated from. The smells his helmet had kept away, dust, metal and blood, all mixed together, clogged his nose and throat. He coughed, cursing under his breath. Pushing past his discomfort, he squinted in the darkness, noticing first the many fallen streetlight, then taking in the rest of the scene.

Several of the buildings that had stood lined next to each other on each side of the road had collapsed, and a few others seemed to be seconds away from destruction themselves. Holes marred their walls, like gaping wounds bleeding out dust and rubble. He could hear crying, breathing and screaming coming from inside many of them, some of the voices too high pitched to belong to an adult. More yells and crashes sounded further down the road but he focused on the closest building first.
Without thinking, he sprung into action, dropping the pizza bag on the ground and rushing into one of the still intact units. Behind him, he could hear Jason hop down and follow him, entering another of the damaged houses, seemingly uncaring of the danger. It was hard to see anything but he found that he could easily tell his surroundings by listening to the vibrations of his footsteps, and the way his fingertips felt when he tapped them on the walls. It was his first time trying to find his way around by relying solely on his tremor sense but it seemed instinctual to follow it. Spiders found their preys that way, he knew. Following the vibrations on the net.

Disturbingly, he had taken off his helmet without even noticing what he was doing, leaving it laying in a dark, dusty corridor to be able to feel the odd vibrations more easily. His face tingled, and he felt goosebumps on his skin, under his clothes. Usually, his spider side took over when he was climbing, making him contort in all kinds of weird positions but he had no time to question this new side of himself. It wasn’t like he had been in this situation before either, his former suit allowed him to see even in complete darkness.

Peter's neck itched, not tingling quite yet but slowly heading there. He gritted his teeth and sped up slightly above what was humanly achievable, following the sounds of crying and shouting. He reached the third floor in seconds, leaping above a hole that was rapidly gnawing away at the main staircase. The walls around him shook every time he took a step. He could hear moaning coming from under his feet, down in the basement, where the street side apartments had already collapsed. A few people were trapped down there, under feet of rubble and metal. His stomach twisted thinking of them, but he had no choice. He had to save the people he could get to first, the ones who had a better chance at survival.

Fully giving up on his normal kid act now that he was in complete darkness, in the middle of an ancient building on the verge of collapse, he kicked open the door he was heading towards. Further down behind it, he could hear yelling and pounding. The wood panel slammed out of its hinges loudly but he barely noticed it, his eyes taking in the room in front of him. A small kitchen and living area, with a stroller on the side and-

The screams came from the second door to the left, behind the couch and the TV. He was past it before he finished his next breath, opening it more carefully this time. There, the ground and walls had already started to crumble, several larger pieces of rumble pinning a man down by the leg, looking heavy enough that his limb had probably been crushed. Next to him, crouching, sobbing but looking determined to stay by his side, a woman and a small child, presumably his family, tried their best to pry the heavy stone blocks off of him. For once, Peter cursed Gotham's propensity towards extravagant, gothic stonework. Flimsy plywood or even glass would have been easier to deal with.

He crouched down next to them, one of his knees digging into the quivering floor, feeling rolling pebbles and broken metal. Carefully, he slid his hands under the one block that had been crushing the man, grimacing when it proved heavier than what he had expected. A part of it was connected to the wall he noticed dimly, a strange colorless picture or the whole room clear in his mind’s eye. It wasn’t as if he was smelling the furniture, nor hearing it… But the shaking ground somehow translated in his brain, turning into a somewhat blurry idea of his surroundings. The slightest shift of his muscles sent shivers up and down the floor and what remained of the ceiling. He could sense it, even though he did not fully understand how.

"I’m going to lift this." He told the civilians, sounding a lot calmer than he felt. "Drag him out as soon as it gets off of him. We need to get out fast."

The woman nodded silently. He could smell the tears and the sweat streaming down her face. She didn’t question how he would be able to lift something so heavy and he thanked the darkness for hiding his features, especially now that he didn’t have Jason’s helmet to protect hid identity. As gently as he could, aware of every groans and moans of the metal frame encasing them and inexorably crumbling apart, he lifted the heavy block. His muscles shook with the strain. As he had suspected, tons of stones weighed on the poor man’s leg. Whatever state it was in, he would probably not be able to keep it if he wanted to survive.
The building creaked ominously but he went on nonetheless, feeling a cold sweat run down his back, his neck itching maddeningly.

Just as he had told her to, the civilian plunged down, grabbing her partner’s shoulders and dragging him away from the rubble. Carefully, Peter lowered the collapsed slab back, fingers bleeding and healing in an infinite, lightning fast cycle. He would need to eat and sleep a great deal to recover from this night but he didn't care. Saving lives in the present was more important. His arms twitched. He didn’t know how much weight he had just had to hold, but it felt dangerously close to his limits.

As soon as his hands were free, he grabbed the man, shouting at the woman to take the child with her and follow him, trying to make himself heard over the rumbling and creaking. His neck tingled in time for him to forcefully drag all four of them out of the room just before the rest of the ceiling collapsed. Giving up all pretenses of being a regular teenager, Peter ended up almost carrying them over the hole, dropping them in a heap in front of the groaning building. He stood there panting for a minute, coughing and trying to catch his breath. The air was just so heavy, there was so much dust…

Disturbingly, the screams coming from the basement had ceased, and he could now hear a quiet gurgling, buried under the rumbling and banging. He felt like vomiting but forced himself back into a semblance of his usual vigilante composure.

He didn't have much time to make sure the three civilians were fine but he did quickly check on them, cringing at the state of the injury he hadn't had time to examine yet. He felt terrible for not staying with them any longer but he could still hear cries coming from inside. He dashed away once again, vaguely aware of the sounds of further crashes down the street and of a shape running away, ducking into a house, coming back out, madly flailing as it ran. The dust of the collapsing apartments engulfed him before he could see more and he lost himself in the terrible rhythm of barely rescuing the survivors of the disaster. Sometimes, he wasn't fast enough, and the floor crumbled before he got there. Sometimes, he was just in time but he could tell a wound was simply too severe to be healed. He still carried those victims out, mostly so that their loved ones, often still at their side as they laid dying and trying desperately to help in any way they could, would come with him. At some point, maybe it had been minutes, maybe hours, he noticed his hands were smeared with blood. He didn't have time to wipe them, however, there was always one more person to rescue, one more child to carry out.

The darkness hid his identity and he found he did not need light to get around, even when his nose and ears felt overwhelmed by the smells and sounds of death around him. Even phones were useless and the dust clouds were so thick they felt like water when he breathed in. Eventually he resolved to hold his breath, knowing he could go on for much longer than a regular person without needing to take another one. He could hear coughing from behind him, spluttering, vomiting. Sometimes, would be rescuers had to back away from a crumbling house, scared off by the darkness, by the smells and the lack of air. He went in when nobody else could, sometimes digging barely breathing bodies out of caves made of destroyed walls and broken tiles, sometimes crawling down there himself, blessing the fact he had learned first aid years ago, wanting to be able to help in situations not unlike this one.

It reminded him of his childhood, of New York and the thwarted invasion. The smell of dust, old stones, plumbing and gas crumbling and mixing into one another brought him back to his old self, wandering the ruined streets of his former neighborhood, holding his aunt's hand as tight as he could. This was only a street, however, and the perpetrators were not aliens but- He shook his head, focusing back on carrying the girl he had managed to rescue dangling over a pit in the ground, a sinkhole that had opened as a result of the collapsing houses. He had people to save here, fighting was not his job, not out of the costume. He wasn't even sure there had been anyone behind this. For all he knew, this could have been a freak accident, a gas leak accidentally ignited or something related to the buildings' structures. Not everything was related to a villain.

As if on cue, a dark shape moved in front of him, almost crushing him and the child in his arm as it passed them. It hulked over him by several feet, muscles rippling behind the clouds of dust. It smelled unnatural, like chemicals, although he couldn't quite make out which one.

His neck tingled and his eyes followed the stranger as they disappeared into the dust and the smoke. He could still smell their scent, and the stench of blood underlying it. Nobody else seemed to have noticed or, if they had, they did not care enough to follow. There were still dozen more to rescue.

But what if this odd person caused another building to collapse? More people would die. No one else was going after them.

Peter set the civilian down and sprinted after the shape, having already made the decision to stop whoever it was before he had even realized he was wondering if he should act. As always, his body moved on its own, leaving no place for reason. The scents coming from this shadow were so unnatural, so sharp and disturbing that he simply knew that it was connected to the incident. His neck started itching again, but he ignored it. Using his newfound vibration sense to duck and jump above and past rescuers and survivors, he focused on the chase only. Distantly, he noticed a few parked police cars, their lights barely strong enough to pierce the walls of dust. They were gone too fast for him to react or tell them anything and he was back to the dust clouds and the fleeing person in front of him. He could hear the thumps of large feet grinding into the old stone road, too heavy for a regular person. He gritted his teeth and sped up slightly, taking advantage of the lack of visibility to catch up with the creature.

He heard it groan and moan as he got closer, its back rippling with muscles, veins popping out every few inches, looking more like tubes than blood vessel. In the back of his mind, he realized that the creature he was chasing was a person, a human. The knowledge was sobering and, suddenly, he felt horrible for whatever had caused them to transform into what he was now chasing.

They were a human, but they had caused dozen of deaths. He had to stop them. No matter what, he had to.

He stopped for a fraction of a second, crouching on the ground, one hand reaching down, palm touching the rocks and the rubbles. As quickly as he had bent down, he shot forward, cutting through the air, dust smearing his face, entering his nose and his mouth as he leapt. He gathered his legs in front of his chest, curling up in the air. Moments before he would hit the back of the fleeing villain, he kicked his feet forwards and pulled his back straight, as fast and hard as he could. His boots smashed into muscle, skin and flesh with a loud THWACK and a sinister crack.
His target yelled out in pain, stumbling and reaching behind them to try and grab him. He had expected it, however, and had used the impact of his kick to push himself back, landing on his hands then lowering himself to a crouch. He let out a long exhale and filled his lungs with the dusty night air. Snow was still falling, sticking to his hair and clothes, although he didn't truly feel it.

By now, they had reached the edge of the disaster zone, and some lights from nearby buildings made it a bit easier to distinguish what was going on, unfortunately for Peter's anonymity. Not many people seemed willing to go out into the streets, although he could hear a lot of activity behind him, police and ambulance sirens alike, and another, deeper, louder motor roaring. Maybe the bats were getting involved, maybe they had called the army. For the first time in a while, he realized the haunting screeches had still not stopped.

"Why?" He yelled, over the bangs and the howls, the rumbling and the cries of the dying. "Why would you do this?"

Instead of answering, the villain he was chasing started running again, each step barely more than a stagger yet heavy enough to shatter the ground under them. With a curse he did not know himself capable of saying out loud, he followed, only allowing himself to sprint as fast as he had seen some of the best track runners at his former school run. Although the mound of muscles and veins that had once been a person was strong, they were not particularly fast and he easily kept up with them, plunging into dark alleyways and tight stone staircases. He jumped over a stone wall when the villain chose to smash through it, bouncing off the dumpsters and metal trashcans the stranger tried to push in his direction. He could hear them panting and moaning, they sounded in pain. He could not allow himself to feel bad for them, not here, not in Gotham. Not after what had happened last time he gave someone like this the benefit of the doubt...

They sprung out of the housing district and straight into a construction zone, abandoned at this time of the day. The villain's pace had slowed by then and, although they tore through the fence protecting the site with ease, they stumbled to a walk, then stopped completely and turned to stare at Peter, letting him see their face for the first time.

They looked like a man, although it was to tell, every single muscle in their face and neck bulging out so grotesquely they features seemed to have melted somehow. The only recognizable feature in this tangle of flesh and bone was a pair of eyes, looking small under the layers of chemically enhanced musculature. To his surprise, he thought he could see something that looked a lot like horror in them. Moisture dripped from under the damaged lids, it smelled exactly like tears. Stunned, he stopped in front of the strange person, fist raised but not striking, staring into the horrified gaze, watching silently as the villain backed away from him, still crying.

They were still moaning and, suddenly, he realized those very moans were mangled words, spoken in a raspy, broken voices. Fearful mutters, pleading for mercy, talking of demons and horrors. Despite their massive size, the person he was chasing was trembling and looking at him as if he was the most terrifying creature they had ever seen.

"I-" He gulped, voice trembling despite himself. "Are you alright?" He took a step forward, trying to appear non threatening. "I'm sorry for hitting you, I thought you-"

His Spider sense tingled in time for him to bend his back in half, a large, veiny fist cutting through the air where his head had been moments prior. He gritted his teeth and bent further towards the ground, planting his hands and sending his legs upwards. They arched up smoothly, with a grace he knew was almost impossible for humans to achieve, and once again he planted his feet in the weird mixture of muscles, bones and flesh. His strike sent the villain reeling backwards, crashing into a pile of bricks, sending them flying to the ground.

"I was trying to be nice." He snapped, now irritated. Crouching down, he readied himself to jump above the creature once more and finish them off with a falling kick or knee to the gut.

A wail was the only answer he got from the figure as they sprawled in the mess of bricks, snow and mud. They twitched violently, arms reaching up then down, legs shaking. The wailing turned into ragged sobbing, then to howls. Their hands, twisted, broken things covered in veins and muscles that had no right being there, crawled up to their face. Their nails dug into their own skin as they yelled, now wordlessly, an animalistic howl.

He closed his mouth, not knowing what to say. This person had caused the collapses, or at least been involved with it, he was sure of it. They sounded so pathetic, crawling and bawling that he had a hard time believing they had done so willingly, or even fully understanding what was happening around them. They attacked him, though, they had been lucid enough for that. But had it been a trick, or simply a kneejerk reaction to what could be a form of psychosis? He started regretting the kicks he had thrown. If he was the cause of their death, he would never forgive himself.
The way their muscles bulged looked terribly painful, especially around some of their joints, who seemed to have been all but crushed by the mass. He could see an unhealthy green tinge start to spread in spots on their necks and chest. When he listened to their heart, it was beating sluggishly, skipping several beats in a row.

"Oh." He whispered. The beating was erratic, fading away quickly. "Oh no."

He didn't know why but he stepped forward again, now so close to the deformed human body he could feel their skin quivering. He touched the person's face, wincing when they did not react, their muscles so tense they were most likely unable to move. They were burning up, their eyes now rolling in their orbits, tears, blood and a strange white foam dripping from them. Their lungs sounded clogged up but, looking over their body, he thought it might be rather be that they were being compressed by all the muscles. All of that growth could not be natural, it appeared to be so extreme that it broke bones, which must be excruciating. And their veins looked so thick yet their heart was so slow... if it wasn't pumping blood then what was running in there? He noticed that some of them had stopped pulsing altogether and he grimaced.

He knelt down next to them as they laid in the snow, arms and legs spasming, gasping for air. Their eyes were still open, unblinking and teary, but the terror had left them. He could only see pain now, and their face was so stiff that only their scent and gaze betrayed the way they truly felt. Helplessly, he put his hands -so small on this deformed chest- over their ribcage and pushed down, trying to get their heart to beat more regularly. He couldn't give up. This wasn't this person's fault, they had not intended for this all to happen. He could feel how terrified they were but, as he pressed down again and again, their blood never started flowing any faster. He tried for a while longer, ignoring the way some of the veins burst when he pressed down too hard, letting out the same foam that had dripped out of their eyelids. Eventually he had to back away, his hands covered in the weird liquid. He wiped it on his pants then on the ground, muddying his fingers. Grime was better than whatever this was.

"You're dying." Peter said softly, feeling shocked and very small. He could see marks on the strangers naked wrists, bulging scars now opening up again, left by bounds that had stayed on for too long, he tried his best to fix the memory in his mind, make sure he would remember it later, when he revisited this moment. "I'm sorry."

He would make sure that whoever had caused this would be stopped. If those truly were marks left over from time in captivity, then this poor civilian really was innocent. He knew the Gotham underground used several toxic gases and liquids that could induce neurologic effects, some of them causing people to laugh hysterically, others plunging any victim into a deep psychosis, in which they hallucinated their worst fears. This did not look like either of them, and he could not remember what else Barbara's pamphlet had described. It had been so long since he had read it. He would have to look into those substances, however. He had a gut feeling that whatever he was witnessing right now had a connection to a drug of some kind. The acrid chemical smell coming from the frothy tears on the deformed face and his own hand, despite all his wiping, only served to confirm it.

He sat down on the cold ground, suddenly drained of all his energy. Next to him, the dying person's hand was twitching, fingers mangled and broken beyond repair, muscles bulging and quivering, alongside too big veins and splotches of green skin, like bruises. On impulse, he reached down and grabbed the hand in his, squeezing it tightly. He did not know what had happened, nor why it had, but he did not want to leave someone to die on their own, feeling like they were alone in the world. He could not allow that to happen.

The stranger's back arched suddenly and they twisted in pain, moaning and groaning, spit flowing down their damaged chin. As their lips parted, he could see that their tongue was severely swollen, taking up most of their mouth. Their breathing was barely more than a low whistle. He bent down towards their ears, whispering that he was there, that they were not alone, that it was going to be alright and it would be over soon. He was crying, both because of the horror he was witnessing and because of the terrible things he already had to experience that night. He hoped Jason was alright, he had not seen him in hours. It was still so dark, dawn was so far away... He wanted the sun to rise already, to wash away this nightmare of an evening and bring some clarity. He still did not understand what had happened.

The raspy breathing became a gurgle, then a rasp again. The cycle went on for a few minutes until, finally, the gurgle turned into a heart wrenching rattle, the one that sometimes left the throat of dying humans. After the last of it faded into silence, the large form stilled. Peter let the mangled hand fall, wiping his cheeks with his fingers, smearing more dirt and blood on his face as he did so. This was not what he had expected would happen. He thought he was chasing a villain but he couldn't shake the feeling that the person he had just watched die had been a victim, the same as everyone else who had perished that night. They had looked so afraid.

Their body looked just as grotesque now that it was still, muscles so ridiculously big their skin looked about to rip apart.

He could not tell what kind of person they had been while they had still been alive. Their gender, age, even their ethnicity were impossible to make out. The only thing he could see clearly, as he tried to calm his heart and his mind, was their eyes. Their irises were dark brown, almost black, and framed by long eyelashes. He couldn't look away from the lifeless gaze, every detail of it burning into his memory. He knew he would see it in his nightmares, that and the twitching and arching that had accompanied the stranger's death.

He sat there in the snow, staring at their lifeless form, at their chest that would never rise again until his tears dried and his hands began to hurt from the cold.

Still, he could not tear his eyes away.

    Chapter notes:
    Robin is 10, turning 11 in a few months. He has been Robin under Bruce for a few months now. Jason and him never really talked in person out of costume so Damian is a bit weirded out.
    Spiders feel vibrations through the hairs on their body. peter has a body and he also has hair. He mostly feels it through his exposed skin.
    Asgakdkak i have plans for the spider boy... so many plans...

    Update babble:
    As some of you may have noticed, I’ve slowed down my updates. This is in part because I’m more busy now than when I started writing this.
    Mostly, I’m working with horses and writing other non fanfiction stuff
    I’m also working on another fic that I’m trying to finish before uploading, so that’s another thing.

    UPDATE SCHEDULE:
    I will aim to post every two weeks to one month maximum. I might do more or less depending on irl stuff.
    I estimate this fanfic will be between 40 or 60 chapters long and will have a sequel, although a sequel would be depending on irl stuff as well.

     
    thank you for reading my brain worm. As always go check out the other amazing crossover stories that inspired this but tbh I’m pretty sure most of you already have lmao.

Chapter Text

Snow was still falling by the time Jason found him but he could barely feel the cold. All he could think about was what he had just witnessed. Veins bulging, muscles expanding…

It was almost a puzzle except, for once, it was one he had trouble solving. He was missing pieces, so many in fact that he had no clue where to even begin putting it together. What had happened could have been some form of extreme mutation, the result of chemical exposure or injection, a drug or the effect of some mutant-meta power.

As he stayed there, frozen and staring at a corpse, he heard his friend walk up behind him, felt a hand rest above his jacket -or rather what was left of it.

"Come on, we’ve got to leave." Jason tugged his shoulder, not managing to make him move an inch. "What the-" the biker cursed, trying to pull him once more.

Peter could smell the unnatural scents mixing in with those of early death. Chemicals, yes… but was it an accident or something more deliberate? He shook his head, lost in thought.

"Dude, you really do not want to be here when the lures run out." Jason tried again, now shaking his shoulders to snap him out of his daze. "We need to fuck off right now."

"I-" Peter bit down on his lip, shook his head. "Okay. Okay."

"Thank fucking God." His friend half cursed half sighed in relief. "Hop in, they’re gonna be here soon."

"What about-" He looked at the body, slumped in a puddle of stinking chemicals and bodily fluids. Death was never nice on the senses of the living or the dignity of the deceased.

"Nothing we can do."

Jason pushed him again and, this time, he had enough common sense to pretend to stumble slightly. "We need to go now."

As if to make his point, a low rumble reached them from the street, getting louder as it sped towards them. Peter had heard it before, during a night of ashes and flames. He gulped.

"Bats?" He jumped on the back of the bike, clenching his fists. His powerlessness was making him angry.

"You fucking bet, kiddo." Jason grunted. The older teen slid on his helmet, stopping any other attempts at conversation. One heartbeat later, they were on their way, the roar of their bike mixing in with the sound of the vigilante group approaching them.

Do they think we have something to do with this? He wondered, casting one last look at the prone body of the stranger in the center of the ruined construction zone. If they got hold of his DNA during the encounter with Firefly, would they be able to find more traces of it here?

He felt like he had forgotten about something and, as the icy winds of winter hit his bare face he suddenly remembered what.

"I left my helmet behind!" He yelped, causing Jason to flinch slightly.

"What?" His friend replied over the roar of the engine and the whistling wind. Of course, he was only human and his senses were nowhere as sharp as Peter’s.

Nothing you can do about it, Parker, he tried to calm himself. With a bit of luck, maybe it got crushed under the ruins. Like all those poor civilians he did not manage to save.

He took a deep breath of frozen air. He had had long talks with his friends and older vigilantes in the past about guilt and what he should and should not feel after failing to save someone but it had never really stuck to him. It was even more disheartening to go through it now, when he felt like Spider-Man was at his most useless.

Behind them, the roaring of an engine made for speed and power rolled closer and closer. The bike might be a marvel of engineering but it seemed to lag a bit compared to whatever the Bats were using to chase them down.

Do they really think we caused this?

Abruptly, Jason turned the bike, skidding on ice and swerving so low both of them almost touched the ground. Miraculously, the powerful motorcycle held on and kept balance.
They headed into a tiny alleyway, their shoulders brushing past protruding planters and Christmas ornaments in the confines of the cramped street. They swerved a few more times, each time burrowing deeper into the small alleys that made up the vessels around and inside of Gotham’s heart. Peter could feel his anxiety rising, as well as a tingling feeling at the back of his neck.

Without thinking, he slammed a fist into Jason’s shoulder to get his attention. The older teen cried out but seemed to listen as closely as he could when he yelled at him to turn away from the street they were about to enter, a dim alley, as silent as a graveyard.

Miraculously, the young man heard him despite his helmet and nodded. The sudden turn slammed both them and the bike into the wall of a nearby building but Jason did not waste a second speeding away. As if to confirm what he had just felt, Peter heard a second engine join the chase, then a third.

He turned back on his seat to squint at the darkness and cursed mentally. Two bikes were riding just behind them, both of them with a costumed vigilante behind the wheel. They were getting worryingly close, only a few car lengths away.

He was in such a rush he had trouble identifying the body armors they were wearing but, although he could not put a name to them, it was obvious they were part of the greater alliance of heroes in Gotham. Not the people he wanted to go against at all.

"We were helping!" He shouted. "We want to help!"

In reply, one of the figures tugged a strange machine out of the side of their vehicle. It was only when the wires it shot hit him and he was struck with a bolt of electricity that he realized what it was. The reach on this taser was simply insane. And for it to be so reliable when they were engaged in a motorcycle chase made it even more impressive.

Pain made his teeth clench so hard he heard one of them crack. Shakily, he tore the wires out of his clothes and skin and, his mind clouded by the burn quickly forming and, just as quickly, healing on his chest, he tugged at it with all his strength.

The machine went flying from the vigilante’s hand and he grabbed onto it by reflex, slightly surprised at the outcome of his rash decision making. He was so taken aback that he almost fell out of his precarious seat when Jason decided to take them up a flight of stairs, no doubt ruining a few steps in the process. The shaking made his burning skin ache as it rubbed against what was left of his poor jacket. He grimaced, glancing back to see they were being followed as closely as before. The taser burned his hand, uncontrollable and, likely, made to only work for its owner. He threw it away, smashing it against a nearby house.

I am not getting into a fight with the local vigilantes, he promised himself. This was definitely not a good situation to be in if he ever wanted to cooperate with the Bats but he could at least avoid sending one of them to the hospital if he could. That would make the likelihood of them not arresting him on sight slightly better. Not that it looked very good for him on that regards, with them already chasing after him.

Jason, apparently, was not in agreement on that point as, after reaching a larger road and being welcomed by the foreboding form of a large, almost tank-like vehicle, he cursed and slipped one of his many firearms out of the body of his bike. Although it looked like a handgun, its barrel was longer and thicker than anything Peter had seen before and, when it shot a few rounds, the sound was loud enough to have belonged to a shotgun.

"Holy shit," he gasped, ears ringing. "Don’t shoot them!"

"My bike, my rules!" Jason shouted back, emptying his magazine on the armored vehicle as it followed them onto the road.

Despite all of the older boy’s mastery of the road and knowledge of the city, it seemed to become harder and harder to stay ahead of the beast that was chasing them. As if to make matters worse, more vigilantes joined the hunt, pressing them further and further ahead. Peter could already see what would happen to them once caught. They would be blamed for what had happened, even though they had been helping. Just like what had happened to him in his original universe. Just like that…

No. No, it couldn’t end that way. He couldn’t be labeled as a criminal for something he had not committed, not again, not now. He was only starting to figure things out!

Perhaps he couldn’t fight them but he could slow them down. It would require revealing what he truly was but-

Well he had already been failing at hiding most of his powers while in Gotham, worse he had showcased them in front of a crowd of hundreds only a few days earlier.
He took a deep breath. He did not need to fight the Bats to slow them down, he just had to be fast about it, not leave them a chance to capture him. He could not underestimate them.

Not wanting to give himself time to question his decision, Peter brought his legs up and crouched on the seat behind Jason. "I’ll catch up!" He yelled over the wind, not knowing if he would be heard. "Please don’t shoot me!"

He already knew his jump would hit the bike pretty hard but he still felt a sliver of guilt as his friend almost lost control of the vehicle from the amount of force he put behind it. His concerns were quickly forgotten as he arched through the air, twisting backwards to face the Gotham vigilantes, feet up in the air and head pointed to the ground, now so far away that, were he not a super, a meta, he would have died on impact.

As it was, he finished his backflip and slammed down onto the black vehicle with all of the strength of an unleashed meta. The alloy of the armored hood crunched like thin aluminium under his feet as he bore down on it. It did not stop, still speeding after Jason. His bare face burned as he knew it was being recorded for the vigilantes to study later. There was nothing he could do about it. He had to help his friend escape.

They would not be blamed for something they did not do.

With a roar, he stuck his hands to the metal and tugged. The armor flew away from the outside of the vehicle just as sparks of electricity were starting to gather at its edges. The hair on his arm stood as he was hit by a small wave of current, travelling through the damaged vehicle. He gritted his teeth, vapor and smoke burning his lungs as he kept wailing on the engine.

"We were trying to help!" He snarled, anger rising. "Don’t you have better things to do?"

He ended his sentence by hoisting himself up on his hands, ignoring the weaker shots of electricity and the speed of the tank-car, still rushing through the streets. He bent backward, hands holding onto the burning hot core of the machine, and his left foot slammed into the glass of the windscreen. To his surprise, it did not break immediately and instead cracked, a spider web of damage spreading across its length.

"What the fuck?" He heard someone yell from his side and, suddenly, he remembered the bikes.

Three other vigilantes were speeding alongside the main vehicle, on motorcycles that looked so technologically advanced they reminded me of some Stark Tech in his home world. The figures on them were slim but muscular, clad in varying outfits. Two of them had a female silhouette, one dressed in full black and the other in purple. The other one reminded him of the pictures he had seen of Robin online, only with more red and black.

And… all three were pointing something -a gun?- at him. The back of his neck itched and his mind screamed at him to JUMP!

His instincts had saved him many times before. He put both feet down on the windscreen, snarling with rage at being suspected of something he would never even consider doing, and he pushed back as hard as he could.

He felt the reinforced glass give out under the pressure but, even as it groaned and splintered, he was already off, faster than even the bikes. He slammed his hands on the rugged stones of the old street they had ended up into and used the ground as a springboard to jump again, his arms doing all of the work for him. Behind him, three different weapons went off, electricity crackling so strongly that he could smell it in the winter air.

"Catch me if you can!" He called out to the vigilantes behind him. "See you never again!"

A heartbeat after that, his feet hit the ground. He started running, as fast as he could, leaving the Bats in the dust.

Or so he thought.

Although the bikes struggled to keep up, he could hear the damaged car somehow still following him, engine roaring louder than a train now that they were both being pushed to their limits. He felt a bit amazed to find such advanced technology in this world, without any Tony Stark to push it forwards.

If they don’t have Tony or Wakanda, they probably have some other genius or advanced civilization hiding somewhere, he mused, quickly looking back to see the tank-car still following after him.

"Time to do some parkour." He muttered. His thick leather boots would not do for this kind of sticking. With a heavy heart, he tore them off, ending up running into the snow on socked feet.

He tossed the ruined shoes away and crouched down, hearing his pursuers getting closer and closer behind him.

"Seeya, Bats." He called one last time, before springing up. He jumped high enough to land on one of the many ancient apartment buildings of old Gotham. Straightening up, he cast a look down just in time to see the roof of the black vehicle opening up suddenly and-

Something zipped past him, slamming into the chimney he was standing next to. His Spider Sense tingled, hard.

Peter did not question his powers, he knew better than that for now. He took off before the Bat was done grappling his way up to where he had escaped but, even as he jumped from roof to roof, he could hear the whirling and whizzing of several grappling hooks being shot out of different guns. At least four people were after him, the same ones that followed him on the street, maybe? He did not have time to turn around to find out.

The cold made his toes hurt as he skidded into ice and stuck his way up walls that were too slick for any regular human to climb. He could hear the hooks getting closer and closer but still, he went on.

Just as he was about to use the last of his energy for a burst of speed he did not know if he could manage, he heard a click, coming from a roof to his left.

Heat.

Extreme heat blasted behind him, yet his Spider Sense did not act up. He turned around to see a small round object hit the top of the building he had been on a second earlier, releasing a burst of flames into the night. Behind the fire, he could make out four figures, three thinner and smaller and one who was…

He was tall, even more than what he had expected from his research. His muscular form was framed by a long, black cape floating in the wind. His eyes glowed in the dark, no doubt a feature of the otherwise fully black cowl he was wearing. His very aura was so intimidating Peter could not help but take a step back.

"Here!" A familiar voice shouted on his left. "Come here!"

He followed it to its source even as another grenade went off. There, somehow standing next to the bike he had grown to associate with him, was his friend of less than one week. They barely knew each other yet here Jason was, waving at him and tearing off part of another explosive to hurl it at the vigilantes.

"Come here kid!"

Peter shot a last glance at the bats, who were now regrouping on other buildings to avoid the many explosions. Miraculously, the roofs were left intact by the blasts but still, it was clear those weapons could kill.

He took a deep breath, then jumped. He landed in a crouch next to his neighbor, who looked less than surprised by his display of power. Figures. He hadn’t been very good at hiding his skills anyway, not in Gotham, where he constantly needed to use them.

"How are you getting the bike down?" He asked Jason, settling in behind him.

"Like this," His friend frowned, his face a mask of grim seriousness. He looked about to murder someone, hopefully not him.

To his horror, the older teen pushed the motorcycle forwards, speeding off the edge of the roof and straight towards the pavement below. Peter braced for impact, grimacing.

He did feel the landing but, instead of shattering bones and breaking the bike, they simply bounced slightly on their seats, teeth rattling and were soon off again. Neither of them was wearing a helmet, yet they had never gone this fast before. If anything, the bike now seemed able to rival even the strange black car that had pursued him. It felt hot under his skin, as if the effort was putting such a strain on its engine it was about to explode.

"How?" He gasped but, at the speed they were driving, the question was left unanswered, swallowed by the noise around them. He peered back, unable to see anything but the shapes of constantly shifting streets and buildings as they burrowed deeper into Gotham’s heart.

"It’s alright." Jason was muttering under his breath. "We’ll make it out. It’s alright." He said over and over, like a prayer, deaf to anything else that was happening around him. Peter clenched his fists tightly, heart pounding. He had almost been caught, for something he had not done.

"Spider-Man killed Mysterio" a voice mocked him, deep inside his mind. "He is a murderer, a criminal."

Except now, they saw his face. They saw his powers. Worse, they might even be able to scrape some of his DNA and, once they did, they would realize he was not a meta human but something different, something that did not belong to this world. What would they do then?

He shook his head, trying to cast away doubts and questions he could not find the answer for yet. They had to escape, reflecting on their situation would come later.

If only they hadn’t gone after his friend too, he would never have gone for their car, or engaged them at all. But he could not let someone be blamed for something they did not commit. He understood that feeling more than anyone after all. What did it matter that Jason had once been a mercenary, what did it matter that he carried firearms? He had tried to save people, the same as him.

No matter what his past held, Jason Todd did not deserve to be treated like a criminal for wanting to rescue civilians.

No one did.

And with that belief burning in his heart, Peter held on, hoping against reason they would make it out safely.
Notes:

    Spiderman max speed is 250 mph, normal max speed for batmobile is around 230 mph but it can go up to 300+ with some boosters because Batman does not fear hospital bills.

    More Bats soon UwU

    Finally getting some time to write by using my phone during breaks. It’s slow going but I’ll try to post more soon!

Chapter 24: Late night conversation
Summary:

    Peter and Jason have a talk, choices are made.

Notes:

    I hate writing dialogue so here is a chapter of nothing but dialogue.

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

"This fucking asshole!"

Jason slammed a fist down on the workbench he stood in front of. Banged up and covered in notes and tools, it was tucked away in the corner of the tiny one-car garage he had led them to. The chase had been long, taking them through the underground and even, at some point, up the roofs but, eventually, they had managed to lose the Bats.

The place was even smaller than Peter’s apartment and, with it being in East End, it was surrounded by a large amount of unsavory businesses. Despite the walls of the cramped room being made of rough stone, they could still occasionally hear sounds of partying and various arguments breaking out. Then, perhaps it was simply Peter’s hearing being too good, once again.

Still, as he sat there, staring at his fully healed hands and blistered feet, he could not bring himself to feel anything negative about the storage unit. He was alive, he was free, and so was Jason.

But they know your face now and, soon, they will know everything about you.

The stray thought made sense. With the kind of technology the vigilantes had used against them, they surely had the means to look into his identity. Not that he had much of one anymore… 

He groaned, resting his forehead on his knees, grimacing when he felt the tears and scuffs on one of his only pairs of jeans. Yet another thing for him to worry about. All those issues and he still did not have his suit ready. Good job, Spidey.

"He didn’t even look into it before going after us!"

Another slam, the sound of tools clattering to the ground. Peter rolled his head to the side to peer at his friend, who was still bent over the work table, his entire body shaking with rage. His face sported a few cuts and bruises from everything they had been through that night and his usually immaculate leather jacket was covered in dust and grime.

Memories of the crumbling buildings rose in his mind and he found himself wanting to push it away for now. It was still too fresh for him to reflect on it. Haunted by the sounds of pillars of stone bearing down on civilians and the feel of a chase through the night, he tried to distract himself.

"Weren’t you expecting them to come? You talked about lures" He asked, his voice sounding distant. Too much had happened in the span of a few hours and, now that they were settling down, every feeling he had been repressing in order to survive was hitting him at once. "You know them, don’t you?" He had to keep talking to push the memories away, had to busy himself with a task or a puzzle.

Jason turned around so fast he accidentally sent yet more tools flying. They joined the clutter of pieces, screws and metal already spread on the ground from his earlier flash of anger. "What-", the young man began, tone low and dangerous. As abruptly as his temper rose up, it fell back down and he shook his head, taking a deep, long breath.

"I have had run ins with them before." The young man eventually replied, bending down to pick up a bent screwdriver and glaring at it as if it had decided to break by itself. "We don’t like each other very much." Without looking, he tossed the tool behind his back. It landed in the only trashcan of the room, on the other side of his bike. Obviously, he was extremely familiar with this place.

Why sleep in a container when you have access to a room, even one like this?

"Those run ins didn’t go well, I assume." The younger of the two noted absently, plucking at the tears on his pants. He could probably fix them up, with a bit of time.

The mattress he was sitting on was too thin to stave off the chill from the cold ground it laid upon. He tugged his jacket closer to him, shivering slightly. Perhaps that was why Jason had chosen not to live here. The cold was simply dreadful.

A shipping container couldn’t be much better, though. 

"Aren’t they vigilantes?" He asked after a few seconds of uneasy silence. "Why did they go after us without proof?"

Jason snorted. "Because I was there." He shrugged, bitterness obvious in his tone. "I told you, we have history.” By then, he had turned to face him fully, resting the back of his thighs against the workbench and crossing his arms in front of his chest. He sounded confident but the words did not make full sense.

"It can’t be that bad," Peter protested, shaking his head. "You aren’t that bad. You want to help people. It just doesn’t make sense."

His friend’s expression shifted to one of deep sadness. The silence between them stretched for a while. Outside, they could hear the wind blowing and, sometimes, the sound of sirens.

"People change, I suppose." Jason sighed. "I did some terrible things not too long ago, before we met."

That sounded extremely familiar and Peter could not help but be reminded of his own past, of the people he had tried to help. Some of them were consumed by mental illness, some saw no other options or where completely overcome by their own mutation.
Everyone had a different reason behind their actions but, still, he strongly believed anyone could change. Or at least, that anyone should have the opportunity to. He thought the bats did as well but, now that he had faced them and ran from them, he was not so sure anymore. To him, it had looked a lot like they were shooting before asking questions.

"You’re not doing them anymore though, right?" He insisted, tapping the cold ground with his fingers, sticking and letting go in a rhythm. He wanted to be swinging right now. He missed New York.

His friend grinned, a smile without mirth, with no trace of joy in it. "I cut most of it out, yes. Hard to go around committing crimes when you’re dragging a brat along with you."

"You’re not that much older." Peter glared at him, not having the energy to make his frown last for more than a few seconds.

Bantering seemed an almost impossible task, he was too tired to think properly. His feet were cold, the socks damp and his boots long forgotten, probably lying in some dark alleyway, covered in snow and frost. Maybe someone would find them and make something out of the remnants. It was a lot more likely they would end up in a dumpster, if anyone even bothered.

"You would be surprised," Jason grunted.

Slowly, he pushed himself away from the workbench and walked around his damaged bike to crouch in front of what seemed to be a tiny electric cooler. He flipped the top open and took out two glass bottles, filled with an amber, bubbly liquid. Peter spluttered when he handed him one, not sure what to do.

"I don’t-"

The older boy opened his bottle with one of the many knives he seemed to constantly carry around and swung it back, taking in a long gulp of beer. "You’re old enough." He rasped, wiping foam off his mouth with the back of his hand. "And tonight has been really shitty."

"I- no thank you."

Jason shrugged. "Suit yourself." He took another long swig, spoke again: "To answer your question properly, yes I stopped doing most of it. I still am thinking of taking some deliveries and spying jobs, they pay good." Another drink, then: "I think I’m done with the killing though."

Peter’s blood ran cold. He had suspected his new friend had a particularly dark past, and may even have ended someone’s life before, but to have it confirmed in such an offhand way was more than disturbing.

What about Natasha and Tony? What about Captain America? They have killed before as well. And this is Gotham, not New York.

Still, he shifted on the tiny cot, wrapping his arms around his legs, trying his best to avoid the older boy’s gaze. He did not want what he was feeling to hurt his friend. The conflict remained however, no matter how hard he tried to smother it.

"Are you still- Would you still-"

Jason sighed, draining the last of his beer and popping the one he had offered Peter open. He turned the bottle in his hand, peering down at it as if it held the answers to whatever he was looking for.

"I would." He said after a long time, eyes still angled down. "But not to anyone." His voice was stronger now, full of rage and determination. "I would kill one of those assholes making this city their playground, and I would have no remorse for doing it." He spat the following sentence out, disdain wrinkling his nose: "Joker and Penguin, Scarecrow and that asshole Bane. Fucking Riddler too, and that psycho Strange-"

"Strange?" Peter perked up, heart skipping a beat. "Stephen Strange?"

"-and… What? No." Jason frowned at him. "I don’t think that’s- no." He shook his head, taking a drink out of the second bottle. "Not the same Strange, I suppose. But anyway. I would kill those guys." He paused for another swig, wiped his lips again. "Wouldn’t kill the guys and gals under them though. I think I’m past that. Most of my weapons have rubber bullets or are electricity based." He rubbed his nose, looking sheepish. "Except a few real ones."

Peter rubbed his toes, trying to heat them up as best as he could. He was not sure if he was immune to frostbite and he had no desire to find out, especially not that night. As he moved, he spoke again, now more curious than disturbed:

"So you would only kill the boss, right?"

Jason shrugged. "Unless I have no other choice, yeah. Most of the guys that work for them aren’t as bad as them." He paused for a second then added, with a wry laugh: "Some of them are pretty fucked though."

"Then why are they going after you?" Peter insisted, pointing a finger at the closed garage door. "And why after me too? Why did they chase us like that if you only go for the big rogues?"

"Ah, kid…" His friend sighed, emptying the rest of his bottle down the drain of a sink that seemed barely functional, half of it missing and the rest dirty and covered in small cracks. "I wasn’t always like that. And it hasn’t been that long since I stopped, only a couple months."

He shook his head, slipping off his leather jacket to reveal a large amount of bruises poking out from under his shirtsleeves. Unlike Peter, he was not gifted with enhanced healing and the rough drive there was already leaving its mark on his skin. He flexed his arms, grimacing at the various cuts and bumps staining his skin red and blue. Still, he spoke in an even tone:

"And it’s not like I’m squeaky clean right now either. I’ve gone up against them in the past and they have no reason to think I’ve changed, especially since they probably know what I’m up to in my free time."

The New-Yorker frowned. "What are you up to in your free time?"

He didn’t expect his question to be answered but, once again, he was taken aback by his coworker, who grinned roguishly. "Breaking into places, getting stuff. I have some… ideas I need funds for." He snorted. "Nothing as dangerous as fighting in the Pits, of course."

Peter’s jaw fell so low he felt it would soon hit the ground.

"You- You-… Is that-"

"How I knew you were a meta? Let’s just say yeah for now." The grin on the young man’s face now seemed genuine, his eyes sparkling with amusement. "You’re not very subtle about it 'Pizza Boy' was it? Half of the underground knows Marco’s delivery boy is a meta. Word spreads fast."

"And you’re fine with that?" Peter eventually managed to croak out, twisting his fingers into his ruined jacket to hide the way his fists were clenching again and again. His first friend in this world and there was so much he had not known about him.

"I’m more than fine," Jason shrugged. "I’ve worked with my share of metas before. Can’t say I approve of who you hang out with, though. Ivy? She’s a dangerous one."

"I need the money." Peter muttered, looking away. In a week, he would have to step back on the ring for the two women he had accidentally tied his fate to. He did not look forward to it at all.

The older teen surprised him again, walking in front of him and sitting down on the ground, legs crossed. He did not appear to be bothered by the cold but then, he had shoes on. The biker clasped his hands together, then rested them on his knees. He took a deep breath, as if he was about to plunge into some icy water, or perhaps lunge headfirst into dangerous territory.

"You need the money," Jason began, then proceeded to shatter Peter’s expectations by adding: "…because you want to become a vigilante."

Once again, Peter was left speechless. He had thought his jaw could not go any lower but, apparently, he had been mistaken. He was so stunned he forgot to feel the slightest bit of panic.

"Am I right?" The older teen insisted, tapping a hand on his leg, the only sign of nervousness he was letting show. His eyes were so intense it was impossible to hold his gaze. Whatever was on his mind, he obviously thought it was of major importance.

"I- No- Uh- Nope."

His friend leaned forward slightly, eyes shining with an enthusiasm he only rarely exhibited. The nervousness was gone now, and only excitement was left behind. He grinned. 

"I want to do it too. I think we could work together." Jason told him, with all the subtlety of a truck ramming through a door. "I think we would do very well." 

"W-What? No, I dont-"

Jason shook his head, crossing his arms but looking as determined as he usually did.

"I know you’re not making a cosplay, kiddo. And you don’t need that kind of armor with that healing power you’ve got going. How many mutations do you even have?"

"Many." Peter blurted out, fully out of his comfort zone by now.

"I can see it in your eyes too, like I see it in me. We both want to help but we can’t, because some narcissistic asshole decided the city is his playground." Jason scoffed, sounding disgusted at the idea. "He’s not letting anyone operate unless they’re part of his team. But we don’t need him to help people. We shouldn’t need him to help people, in fact."

"A-are you talking about Batman?"

"Of course I am!" The anger was back, but it was not directed at anyone currently in the room. "This fucker wants everyone to work under him. He doesn’t even let his buddies from the League help in Gotham most of the time. He’s a total control freak."

"You- sound like you know him well."

Jason winced, regaining his composure almost immediately after losing it. "It’s common knowledge. Everyone know the Bat is unhinged and controlling. It’s probably a good thing they already think we’re working together-"

"Well we are." Peter interjected.

"I’m not talking about pizza." His friend tapped the holster on his hip. "They think you’re up to no good because they saw you with me. And that’s a good thing."

"How is that a- It’s not a good thing!" The younger boy protested, shaking his head. "If anything, it’s really bad."

"No. It means the Bat won’t want you under him. It means you’re free from getting dragged into his little private club. It means you don’t need the exclusive Batman approved card to go out and fight crime. Neither do I."

Peter shook his head again, looking down at the cold stone floor in between them.

"You want to be a vigilante." He muttered after a while, thoughts racing and bumping into each other. It was hard to find the words for what he wanted to express. "You want to work together but not with the Bats."

"Exactly."

"I don’t kill."

He did not mean to say it in such a forceful way but the words came out of his mouth before he could control himself. Jason’s face did not change one bit however. If anything, he looked like he had expected this answer.

"I’m not expecting you to kill anyone. We don’t have to go after the big guys, we can just help out in the neighborhood. The Bats are always busy with the rogues, there’s a lot of crime that ends up swept under the rug. A lot."

"I- What would that even entail?" Peter sighed, running a hand through his hair.

Jason beamed at him, no doubt thinking he had already convinced him to take part in his more than dubious plan. A vigilante team in full defiance of the Bats? That did not bode well for his desire to keep clear of them.

"We can patrol when we’re on deliveries, and after too. If we see something, we intervene. No killing required."

The wind blew in a loud whistle outside their temporary hideout. Peter fidgeted, feeling uncomfortable. "Wouldn’t that make us more of a target for the Bats?" He asked, gesturing at the closed door.

"You’re going to do it either way, we both know that." Jason said, voice perfectly calm but eyes still shining with excitement. "We’re going to show them we don’t need fancy toys to help around. We’ll do it better than them. I know Gotham extremely well and you’re a meta."

"If we do this-" Peter sighed, already knowing it was a mistake even as he spoke the words aloud. "If we do this. You can’t be taking criminal jobs on the side. You just can’t."

"Are you going to stop fighting in the Pits, then?"

The retort caught him aback. He opened his mouth and closed it, not knowing how to reply to the question. A pathetic "I can’t" was all he managed. How to even begin explaining the mess he had gotten himself into with Ivy and Harley?

Jason took his answer with a sad smile. "It’s the same for me, I have some loose ends to tie up. As I said, it’s only some breaking and entering, nothing major."

"I have fought people over breaking and entering." Peter pointed out. "I will stop the Pits as soon as I can, and you should do the same on your side or I- I can’t work with you." He grimaced. "I can’t even believe I’m considering it."

"Believe me, I can defend myself so don’t worry about that," his friend patted his shoulder gently. "I think this is an opportunity. I-" He took in a breath and held it for a while, looking down. "I knew what you were as soon as I met you but still, I wasn’t planning this. I guess-"

Jason swallowed, tried again:

"I guess I trust you more than most people in this town. I didn’t expect it but-"

Another pause, another deep breath.

"I used to be a sort of- beginner rogue I suppose. Even had a name. A costume, too. I want to use them again, to show that Bat bastard."

"A beginner rogue." Peter repeated flatly. "You used to be one of Gotham’s rogues. And you want to be a vigilante." His mind was screaming at him incoherently, the panic now setting in. A rogue. Not a mercenary. A villain. It was so similar to the multiverse incident it hurt to think about it.

The older boy shrugged. "I want to try it, at least. It’s not just about showing that dickhead, too. I also want to help."

"I know that. It’s just-… I thought you used to be a mercenary, not a-" He bit his tongue, not wanting to say anything that could be taken the wrong way. "How can I- I-" The words simply would not come to him. He slumped down, head in his hands, feeling like the world was spinning around him. "I-"

A hand on his shoulder, staying for a bit longer this time. Jason’s smile was gone now, but his eyes remained soft, something rarely seen on his face, usually stoic and cold.

"I have experience making suits, I can guide you through yours. I also know this city and every companies operating in it, legally and illegally.” The young man tilted his head, smiling again. "I also have a very large network in the underground. I can fight and shoot guns, I can drive and I’m decent with computers. You-" The smile grew. "You are not only powerful, you have insanely good instincts, and probably a better moral compass than I do. We will make a good team."

"I can’t work with you if you’re dealing with criminals." Peter insisted, biting the skin of his thumb. He had rarely felt so conflicted before. He had no other friends in this world yet this seemed as risky as the deal he had made with Ivy, if not more.

"And once I’m done with those lose ends, I’m off that game." Jason’s heart sounded steady, his voice was calm.  He might have been telling the truth. Might being the main point of contention. How could he know whether or not his friend was honest?

But then… information was one of the things he was lacking since he landed in Gotham. Having an insider’s viewpoint and knowledge could make his life significantly easier. Any investigation would be much easier to complete with someone like that on his side but still…

The last time he had worked with presumably redeemed criminals had not gone well for him or his loved ones. He could still feel May’s blood on his hands when he slept at night, and sometimes during the day as well.

He hesitated, teetering between two drastically different decisions. He felt as if he was on the edge of a massive cliff, peering down and wondering if jumping would be worth it in the end. A leap of faith, that was what Jason was asking of him. Faith in a man he had met less than a week ago.

A man who had supported him, saved him, been his friend.

But still, Jason was just a man. Men made mistakes, men had the ability to lie and betray, he knew that better than most.

What would May want me to do? Would she proud of me if I simply refused without even trying?

What about Ben?

What about-

"I will-" 

Peter had to stop for a few moments, gathering himself before he could speak again, his heart pounding.

"I will give it a try." Jason’s wide grin was enough for him to add, urgently: "For a month. Let’s try it for a month. If it doesn’t work, we can-"

"-go our separate ways." The older teen nodded vigorously. "I agree. One month. You won’t regret it."

He seemed so happy Peter felt a bit guilty at the doubt he still could not crush. It wasn’t that he didn’t like the other boy or didn’t consider him a friend but although he had worked with redeemed criminals before, this was different. Not only was he in Gotham but, according to what he had just been told, the crimes in question had taken place not so long ago and they carried heavy baggage with the city’s main vigilante team.

Maybe if they see us helping, it’ll help their relationship. A pleasant thought but perhaps a bit too optimistic. Whatever had happened between them in the past has been bad enough to leave Jason with a grudge the size of New York City. Hopefully, the Bats would be a bit more open-minded. Somehow, he doubted it.

"Perhaps we’ll even manage to wrestle some of those kids away from him," Jason was saying, still grinning wildly. "They deserve better than this stuck up asshole. What does he even do for them aside from getting them killed?" Behind the smile there was a real, burning anger, Peter could feel it.

He shivered, wondering how big of a mistake he had just made and how exactly he was going to get himself out of it.

His friend Jason, a former rogue? It was hard to believe but-…

… Everyone should have a second shot at life, right?

May would want me to try, at least.

And…

I want to try it too. I want to help him.
Notes:

    Just to make it clear, I’m not gonna be repeating the story beats of the Red Hood comics. Familiar characters might appear (and they will) but I’m not going to be replicating the plot, sorry :P
    I wanna do my own thing story wise even tho the og concept of Spidey in DC is definitely inspired by Dark Matter and not from me (go read it and reread it again, quality stuff ❤️)

    Also lol at Jason thinking Bats will be less interested in Peter by making him team up with him.

Chapter Text

The top of the Clocktower was covered in snow but, thankfully, the wind had been calm so far this afternoon, and the blizzard had long since stopped. The city glistened with frost and ice, a jewel with a dark and corrupted heart. It looked beautiful.

Even better, the sun was high enough to help with some of the winter’s chill. Peter felt infinitely thankful for it, as he could feel the cold even with his brand new coat on -yet another cut taken out of his budget. Jason had insisted on dropping him in front of a secondhand clothing store when he heard he wanted to take some time to think on his own. For a human who drove so carelessly and had no issue shooting directly at a vigilante’s tank, he was oddly concerned about his younger friend’s health.

As soon as he had finished picking up some new cheap clothes and shoes, he had headed out, to get some privacy. He needed to think.

The highest place he knew in that area of the city was the Clocktower. By then, he did not truly care who saw him run slightly faster than the average human and the trip to Old Gotham had been fast, full of jumping and sliding. He missed the freedom of swinging between buildings but, hopefully, he would soon feel it again.

He had not been able to find a jacket as good as his damaged one but he did sport an almost new pair of pants and some thick leather boots. He simply would have to wait until he had more time to fix it up. Until then, he would have to settle for the thick fabric of his winter coat.

Well… technically he did have time. He was simply choosing to spend it on top of a Clocktower, right next to a police station.

Sneaking past the dozen or so officers around the old church had barely been a challenge, what with everybody seemingly being busy with various forms of work. He had quickly ended up sitting there, on the edge of the roof, staring at the city under him. The streets were oddly quiet this late in the morning. He could taste the apprehension dripping off the civilians who did dare come out of their houses and apartments. It was thick and sour, a mix of fear and excitement.

It wasn’t quite the highest spot he could get to in North Gotham but the bridges seemed too risky in bright daylight. On top of that, he had always had a fondness for old buildings, especially when he needed some time to think by himself. Ancient stones spoke to him in a way glass and metal never could. 

Still, he wished he did not have to deal with so much snow and, more than that, he dearly missed his perfectly insulated suit. Unfortunately, he doubted his next one would protect so well against the cold, a necessary sacrifice to be able to make the more importants parts of his outfit.

Better get used to it, I suppose, he thought idly. Jason never seemed as affected by the cold as he was, at least not in the few days since he had met him. Yet another thing the older boy appeared more experienced with than him. 

It had been such a short amount of time between now and their first encounter, yet it had seemed much longer. He felt as if they had known each other for weeks, perhaps even months. Having to go out during a disaster so soon after meeting each other likely had a lot to do with it. More than most, he knew the power this type of shared experience held in the way of forging bonds. Nothing quite like having to face life threatening odds together to bring people closer.

Still, it had truly been a short amount of time. Jason had said it was an "opportunity" for him, yet had also mentioned that he was beginning to trust him. Was it the truth or was it simply a way to convince him to work together?

He did not use to doubt people that much but, after so many surprises and bad experiences in Gotham, and after what happened in his original universe, he couldn’t help but feel a bit jaded. Only a few days… But they had spent a lot of time together, all things considered.

He sighed, bringing his legs back from the edge of the roof to cross them. He rested his elbows on his knees, chin tucked in his hands. A former rogue…

The more he looked at it, especially with a calmer mindset, the more it looked like Jason had either made a rash impulsive decision by asking him to join up, or had been thinking about it all along but did not wish to tell him. The second option was a lot more worrying than the first, especially since, as teammates, they were supposed to trust each other.

I do trust him to have my back, he decided. But do I trust what he told me?

He felt like something was missing. Going from villain to vigilante was quite a switch in attitude and, although he wanted to take a shot at helping rehabilitate someone, would always want to take a shot at it, he still could not shake that thought. There was something he didn’t know, or did not fully understand about Jason. It could be something the other teen wanted of him, or perhaps something in his background he hadn’t divulged yet.

Whatever it was, it was disturbing him enough that he had to come there.

Only a few days…

But if he had been a villain on the way to redemption, how would he have reacted at the opportunity to team up with someone he was friendly with? It wasn’t like Jason hadn’t been helpful or kind before that night.

He already knew you were a metahuman.

Even then, his friend- yes, his friend, had ran into a collapsing building with him. He had come back to help him escape a group of vigilantes who clearly outgunned both of them in terms of technology and means.

Jumping on an opportunity or planned manœuvre? 

Still, he had agreed to a month of working with him and he would not go back on his word. If there was a shot at helping someone get out of the environment that had ended so many lives he had once loved, he would take it. Rehabilitation was something he believed in with his whole heart, despite everything that had happened.

In the end, his convictions had been validated, he had managed to help people, before Strange cast his second spell.

"Whether or not he’s lying," he muttered, his words accompanied by puffs of pale air, "I still have to try it."

He liked Jason, he was becoming a close friend. Even if he had hated him, he would have taken this opportunity. That was what it was, in the end, an opportunity to do something, change someone’s life.

"I need to encourage him." He whispered to himself, hands aching from the cold. "Do it right."

Peter nodded, his mind now fully made up. Getting up on the very edge of the roof, less than an inch away from the void, he stood up and stretched. He felt worn out but having reached a decision helped settle his nerves tremendously. He breathed in and out, tasting the crisp, cold air and smelling the thousands upon thousands of humans going about their daily lives under his feet.

He had not slept well on that thin, cold mattress, but at least he had gotten a couple hours of rest. The same couldn’t be said for Jason, who had insisted on taking the floor. Same floor that was nothing but stone. He did not understand the older boy sometimes. Still, his friend had looked completely unbothered by his sleepless night.

Maybe he should put a carpet there, if he meant to sleep in the garage regularly. Then, with the bike, perhaps it wasn’t such a good idea.

"I should put a carpet in my room."

And, on those wise words, Peter let himself fall forward, grabbing onto a stone gargoyle a few feet into his fall and quickly beginning his climb down. It only took a few seconds for him to reach the ground and, once he did, sticking to the shadows was enough to let him leave the area undetected. This was a good spot to sit and think, he would likely come back, especially once he finished his suit.

The way back to his apartment was familiar by now, most of North Gotham being part of his delivery route. He slid and jumped over mounds of snow and slates of thick ice, sometimes stopping to look down at the streets below. The previous night had left its mark on the city and only a few citizens were out that day, all of them armed. In contrast, the GCPD was roaming the neighborhood with numbers he hadn’t seen them use before. Every road seemed to host at least two police cars, if not more. Thankfully, they did not seem to be patrolling the rooftops.

Now he just had to hope he didn’t run into any Bats before making it back home. That would be a disaster.

 


oOo



The remainder of his run home was blessedly free of any trigger happy vigilantes. Better even than that, his room was completely devoid of bugs when he combed through it. He could hear Jason move around from behind the few walls separating them. Oddly, his presence remained calming. He had a friend, someone he could talk to.

Someone his age who knew he was a superhuman… a metahuman. More than that, someone who was aware of his desire to become a vigilante in this universe. Perhaps he should have felt wary, considering his neighbor’s criminal history, but he had to go through with what he said. He had to try and, in order to give the team up a proper shot, he would have to trust the man, no matter his own misgivings.

You have met and worked with people who have done much worse, Parker. It’s not like there’s anyone he can kill if he betrays you anyway, May isn’t there anymore.

Instead of soothing him, the thought sent a pang of pain in his mind and he had to sit still for a moment, breathing in and out deeply. He missed his aunt. He missed MJ and Ned.

How long had it been now? Two weeks? Three? His time in this world felt both like it had dragged on forever and like it had lasted the span of a few days. Everything was going so fast and changing so abruptly yet the events surrounding Strange’s two spells seemed to have happened only a few hours ago. He remembered it in every single details, the fights, the research, the deaths…

The look on his friends’ faces as he was dragged away into a maelstrom of raging colors, torn from their existence and thrown into a new one. Thrown into Gotham City.

If I had a chance, would I go back? Are they better off without me or do they miss me?

He never found the answers to his dark thoughts: a knock at the door shook him out of them before he could. He let Jason in with a smile, determined to give everything he had to their team up. It would not fail because of him.

"Hey kid, got some stuff for you." The older boy informed him, pushing the rest of the door open with his shoulder. His arms were full, carrying a large box that smelled like cardboard, fabric, leather and something… mechanical.

"Is there a sewing machine in there?" He wondered, trying to peer inside. "I have one already."

"Can you read minds too?" Jason raised an eyebrow, setting down his burden in the center of the room. He shot an unimpressed glance at Peter’s tiny machine, shaking his head. "That isn’t going to get you anywhere."

"Hey, I modded it!" The boy protested, heading towards his desk to pick up the item in question. "It can do a lot." He fidgeted with the various different add ons he had attached to it, raising an eyebrow at the other teen.

"It can do a lot, sure." As he replied, his friend crouched and started opening his box, revealing a monster of technology that had of sewing machine only the name. If Peter had modded his, Jason had completely deconstructed the concept of the machine to turn it into something both completely over the top and extremely complicated looking. It was bulky, with many different parts dangling, clamps and mean looking hooks. For some reason, it had also been painted bright red.

Whatever it had been modified for, it was not for simple clothes making. This had been designed to work with something extremely resistant. He thought he could see several different end pieces to fit on the machine, all with different shapes and sizes. Some were so small he would be afraid to break them by simply breathing too hard in their direction, some big enough to look like a comically large needle straight out of a cartoon.

"What is that?" He asked, once he was done staring in astonished silence. "Does it really need to be that big?"

Jason shrugged. "It can do pretty much anything I want it to. I even rigged it to help with soldering."

"Soldering."

"Yeah, not everyone can get away with Kevlar and some fancy synthetic fabrics, some of us need proper armor." The grin accompanying the sentence took all the bite it had out of it, but it did not help explain any of what the young man was saying either.

"Your sewing machine can solder metal." Peter repeated, just to make sure he hadn’t misheard anything.

His friend grinned at him, looking more than smug now that he realized how much he had surprised the younger boy. "It can do that and more." He fiddled with the metallic beast for a few seconds then beamed again. "It can also insert cables and chips, among other things."

The New Yorker shook his head, at a loss for words. Upon seeing his friend’s satisfied expression he shrugged. "That’s not a sewing machine that’s a- I don’t even know what it is."

"It’s Jason’s Craft-It-All®." He was still smiling widely when he added: "I call it that because it can craft it all."

"I-" Peter sighed. "I don’t know if that’s any better than just calling it a sewing machine."

After a few seconds of silence, he leaned forwards, trying to figure out how exactly the beast of a machine was staying together. Not only was it large, it was also quite roughed up. Obviously, it had been taken along as his friend travelled and it had been broken then fixed up many many times before.

"Are you going to teach me how to use it?" He asked, wondering if he really wanted to be using this unholy amalgamation instead of his more rudimentary but still efficient tools.

Jason hesitated, frowning. "Depends, do you already have an idea of what you want?"

Peter snorted. "Of course I do!"

He shook his head with a laugh and headed to his red locker, pulling out the remains of the Iron Spider and his boxes of nanopods and components. After setting them down in front of his friend he went back to his desk and picked out his current main notebook, flipping through the pages until he found the schematics he was looking for.

'Spider-suit Mark I, by Peter Parker', the bottom of the page proudly identified the main sketch. He looked over it, overtaken by an odd feeling of anxiety as he read his ideas over and over again. His very first completed Spider-Suit and one he hoped could rival the efficiency of Tony’s old and now defunct technology. No Stark machine to help him make his projects become reality this time, he only had his hands and his wits.

It was only after he plopped down next to Jason that he realized his friend had been silent for an uncharacteristically long time, staring at the destroyed battle suit on the floor.

Right. Not everyone had access to that kind of technology, especially not in this world. He fidgeted uncomfortably, wondering for yet one more time that day if he had just made a major mistake. 

"Did you steal this?" Was the first thing out of the older teen’s mouth. It would have been offensive if not for the fact the young man had himself stolen his own hyper advanced bike. He could go with it as an excuse but, in the end, he could not bring himself to tarnish the memory of Tony’s gift to him.

"No." He sighed, remembering Iron Man as he had been, at the very end. "A friend had tech he lended me to make this. It’s destroyed now though."

"You made this." Jason mouthed, voice so quiet it was barely more than a breath of a sound.

"With help from his tech. He had a whole interface and AI to help with it. It’s not that big of deal." He crossed his arms, now quite uncomfortable. "It’s destroyed now." He had to repeat it a few times and, each time he did, it hurt a bit more.

It was hard to tell how advanced the suit was simply from looking at it but the level of craftsmanship that was put in it still remained obvious. It was a state of the art battle-suit, even now that it had been partly taken apart and that half of it had melted away.

"Sounds like you were friends with some interesting people." Jason mused, not pushing any further. That was one of his greatest qualities, in Peter’s eyes. The young man would never push him, especially if he sensed he was uncomfortable with a topic. As if he had not revealed a high tech battle suit, the older boy went on: "So you said you had an idea?"

Biting his lower lip, the meta pushed his notebook forward, explaining his thought process as he flipped through the pages showcasing his first project. As he went on, Jason’s posture straightened and he leaned forward slightly, nodding.

"The lower layer would be a mix of spandex for the inner joints and the synthetic silk. I thought of adding other materials but this will have to do for now." He switched to another page, tapping the spider web patterns drawn there with his index finger. "This will be made from the salvaged Ir-… the salvaged battle suit." He had to flip through the notebook a few more times to find the example he was looking for, showcasing the two different layers to his friend.

"So the web will be made of metal?" The older boy asked, crossing his arms and tilting his head back slightly. "Won’t that hinder movement?"

"It’s not just metal," Peter smirked, his anxiety now replaced by inspiration. "This suit was made to be fully programmable, the plates can move on a microscopic level, you just have to program the patterns in, or have an AI do it."

"I assume we don’t have an AI available so do you plan on-"

"-writing it myself, yes."

His friend did not appear overly offended at being interrupted. Instead, he nodded thoughtfully, looking down at Peter with an odd look on his face. Was it curiosity, or perhaps… surprise? He couldn’t stop himself from talking long enough to do more than wonder about it, though. He kept thinking about his project, what they could make together, how they would build it.

"So in the end this suit would be two layers, one of fabric and padded material and one of intelligent technology. When deactivated, it would look like this." He tapped the web pattern again, then turned the page. "When activated, it would go through different shapes, moving along the web to spread wherever I need it on the suit."

"A shifting spider web." Jason whistled. "I guess I should have expected you to pull something like this, you’re very good at surprising me."

"That’s not the only thing," Peter smiled, feeling his face heating up ever so slightly under the praise, "On the areas I can’t bend, like the back of my thighs, I want to keep a larger amount of metal. If something shoots at me or hits the suit, I can shift it to where it’s needed. I would need to program commands for it of course but-"

"-you would have an built in shield against brute force attacks."

Perhaps they weren’t interrupting each other, he realized. They were simply finishing the other’s idea, a good sign if they were meant to work together. His smile grew. He reached back to pick up the laptop on his bed, opening it to show the progress he was making on his coding projects. He did not mention most of it was a direct translation of the old Iron Spider protocols, instead staying silent and watching Jason’s eyes widen.

"You wrote this?" His friend sounded more impressed than incredulous. "Damn kid, you’re better at this than me, I can barely read what you made." He shook his head, whistling. "This is really solid. This might actually work."

They kept scrolling through the different files for a bit before focusing back on the two bundles in front of them. The damaged Iron Spider and the pile of fabric would come together to form a brand new suit and, if Peter was right, they should have enough materials left to make at least two more intelligent body armors. He had several different ideas for a more specialized Spider suit he could use in difficult situations. It would take a lot of effort to make it happen, but if he figured it out, he knew he would have a massive advantage out on the streets.

He clapped his hands, too excited to hold his energy back any longer. They still had more than five hours before having to head to work, a lot could be done in that time.

"If you want to help, I could really use someone to work on the lower layer. I’m more into tech than fabric, and there’s still a lot I need to salvage." He pointed at the destroyed Iron Spider and the precious technology it held.

Jason nodded, rummaging through the cardboard box he had brought in, taking out a small silver object. As he started pulling a long strap of plastic out of it, Peter realized what it was.

"I need to check you out before I can do anything," the older teen wiggled the measuring tape at him, motioning for him to stand up. "It’ll be a second."

And so, the two of them started working on the suit. It would not be done that night, or even the one after. However, once it was finished, it would be everything Peter had hoped for and more. Not quite as impressive as Tony’s last gift to him but powerful enough to take on anything Gotham had to throw at him.

At least, he hoped so.
Notes:

    Spider-man will be back soon ❤️

    Am writing a side story with Dick’s POV starting from the Firefly fight. It will be a mostly serious fic about what the bats are doing and what they think of our two boys.

    Also we’re getting close to the point where everything will start going faster. It’s not quite there yet, but in a few chapters get ready for some violence.

Chapter Text

Twin lines of smoke curled up in the air, vanishing into thin clouds before they could hit the ancient wood ceiling of the pizzeria’s dining room. Peter stared up at them uncomfortably, feeling the tension around him grow every second that went by without any of them talking.

They had been welcomed in by a less than satisfied Marco who, instead of handing them their gear and the pizza planned for deliveries, had told them to sit down with him. He had been staring at them ever since, dragging on his cigarette with the same poise as Jason, who had apparently decided to mimic him. Both of the older men’s faces were hard to read but to a meta like him, it was easy to feel and smell the dark cloud of emotions surrounding them.

Their boss was the one who eventually cut through the silence, his voice colder than it had ever been before.

"I believe we may have to set some ground rules, boys."

Jason frowned, fingers tightening around his smoke and mouth quirking down. "Don’t call me boy, old man," he spat, eyes burning with anger. He had never seemed comfortable with authority, he was a rebel at heart, or so Peter thought.

Marco’s eyes tightened. Abruptly, his hand turned into a fist, crushing the cigarette he held. He dropped it into his improvised ashtray, an empty beer bottle, and lit a new one. Despite the tension radiating from him, there was no anger in his scent. Frustration mostly, and a strong touch of annoyance were the only things he could smell.

"Remind me again who put a roof over your head, boy." His gaze was not quite a glare, however it felt just as uncomfortable as one.

Peter shifted in his seat, not used to his boss talking to him in such a tone. This reminded him of high school, which he thought he had left behind months ago. A life time ago, truly, in those circumstances.

He wasn’t the one being reprimanded but still, it made him uneasy. He had never been one to provoke people as readily as Jason, at least not while he was outside of his suit. He lowered his head slightly, fidgeting more and more as his discomfort grew.

"Here are the rules we will go by." Marco took another drag, exhaled it slowly, yet more smoke to join the twin trails. "They are the same I give every brat who works for me, and you will follow them."

The man was slouching in his chair but the intensity in his eyes was enough to make Peter feel as if he were towering over them. Jason seemed perfectly unthreatened, leaning back and taking his time with his own smoke. The furious rage in his eyes had quieted somewhat and he now seemed more irritated than truly upset.

"You have three shots at this. Missing work is one strike, so is going against our business." A pause, he tapped his stick on the ashtray, watching in silence as cinder fell down at the bottom. "Yesterday counts as one strike for the both of you. You have two more shots before I fire you."

Despite himself, Peter felt the urge to protest. They had missed work, that was true, but they had also saved countless lives while doing so. He opened his mouth, ready to defend himself, when his eyes crossed the steady gaze of his boss. He did not look like someone ready to change his mind. If anything, he appeared so calm this was likely something he had said several times before.

What could he do? Marco was indeed the reason why they had access to affordable rooms in a somewhat safe apartment building. He did not have any form of government ID in this world, any bank account or savings big enough to allow him to find another roof easily. Of course, he could stick with Jason but neither the container nor the garage were big enough for two people. He doubted the older boy wanted to hang out with him to the point of having them share a single room space for anything longer than a night.

As if reading his thoughts, Marco raised an eyebrow in challenge, asking in the same even tone as before:

"Do you understand my conditions?" He tapped his cigarette again, more ashes falling down, grey flakes joining the small mound forming at the bottom of the bottle.

Jason’s glare intensified but, to Peter’s surprise, he nodded silently. Not wanting to be the odd one out, the younger of the three hurriedly acquiesced. Their boss smiled without any emotion in his eyes, speaking again:

"Of course, any injury or illness is a valid reason to miss work. I will not be kicking you to the street because you have the flu or broke your leg." The remains of his cigarette dropped into the bottle as he swiped a new one out. "You being responsible for yourself is the only thing that matters here. If you choose to miss work, I have no reason to keep you on."

"You don’t need to go in details about it," Jason gritted his teeth, also finished with his smoke and now crossing his arms. "We got it the first time, grandpa."

"Good. Then you can get to work."

Before they could stand up however, Marco tapped the table with his hand, just hard enough to make them jump. He pointed at the two of them, face devoid of any feeling.

"You are not going together. I don’t know why, but you two have a bad influence on each other when it comes to work." His finger turned towards Jason. "You can handle yourself, I can tell that. You’ll just have to be careful." He looked at Peter soon after, the muscles around his eyes softening ever so slightly. "Don’t fuck up again, kid. I don’t want to have to fire you."

Soon after, they ended up standing together in front of the restaurant, a pizza bag and a GPS each. The dark sky remained clear of any clouds but the cold was keeping most of the previous days’ snow intact, mounds of white frost stretching down the street and up the roofs as if that very day had not been sunny from morning to evening. Wind was picking up, blowing around them in lazy gusts, gathering strength with each blow.

Jason rubbed the back of his head, looking down at Peter with an odd look on his face. Apprehension? Worry? Whatever it was, he wasn’t acting much like himself as he hesitated to speak then managed to mutter:

"Let’s not start tonight." A shift of his legs, some fidgeting. "I want to be able to contact you if we-… and your suit isn’t ready." He cleared his throat, showing his hands deep in his pockets.

"Are you worried about me?" The New Yorker narrowed his eyes, surprised that his older friend would feel that way towards him. Gothamites had never struck him as overly emotional and seeing him uncomfortable was, if not a first, highly unusual. "You know what I am."

Jason shook his head, looking less than enthused by Peter’s attempt at comforting him.

"Kid, jumping into fights with the idea that you’ll be fine because of what you are will get you killed in this city. I’m not joking." He was quite obviously very serious, shoulders tensing up and brows furrowed. "Don’t go in without a way to contact me. Having someone at your back is-"

He paused for a second, took a deep breath.

"Having someone at your back is safer. Don’t rush in and get killed."

There was an odd weight behind his words and, suddenly, Peter realized that he might be talking from experience. Perhaps his former partner had died that way, perhaps this was even why he had decided to end his run as a villain. There was no remorse or sadness in his scent however. The only thing he could smell was a dull anger, hiding a tiny amount of pain behind it.

"I- I won’t." He choked out, distracted by the emotions he could feel coming off his friend. "I wasn’t planning on it, I want the suit to be done before- you know…"

Jason nodded, seeming a bit relieved to hear him agree. "Good, good." His frown turned into a smirk. "Now don’t be too slow delivering, I don’t want to have to wait for you with Mr Sunshine back there as my only company."

"The day you can beat me in a race, you get to call me slow," Peter shot back, also grinning widely. "’Til then I won’t accept it."

"I know a guy who could beat you in a race while he has a broken leg, brat. Don’t they have speedsters in New York anyway?"

They split off soon after that, heading in opposite directions to start on their respective delivery routes. He could hear his friend’s bike speeding away as he started his climb towards the rooftops. Snow crunched under his feet and ice threatened to send him slide off the edge of the building he hoisted himself up on, yet he went on. It was easy work for someone like him, he only missed his webs. Swinging was always more fun than plain old running.

He did not fear falling, his balance was as perfect as it could ever be: he had enough control over his body to keep perfectly still while doing a handstand over a frozen lake, which MJ and him had tried before. It had been a fun evening, one of the best dates they ever went on together.

He missed her a lot, even now that he had a new friend to spend time with. Not a day went by without him thinking of what she was doing, of the way she felt about his disappearance and of what had happened after he was banished from their world. Would he feel bad if she found someone new? Maybe. It had only been a few weeks… He still felt like he loved her, despite knowing he would likely never see her again.

His upper body stayed perfectly straight as he jumped over a large alley, landing in a soft crouch to avoid jostling the food warming up his back. That was one thing keeping him from freezing at least. He did not look forward to patrolling in his new suit, with the weather being this dreadful.

His first delivery that evening was to a couple of civilians living in the southern part of the Bowery. Neither of them appeared overly surprised to see him knock at their door. The word that Marco’s was back in business had spread far and fast. They tipped him generously, sending him back to his route with a few well wishes.

To them, his choice of occupation must seem ridiculously risky. Unlike most of the criminals he encountered, none of the regular Gotham citizens knew about his meta abilities. He was just a stupid kid in their eyes, one who would likely not survive for more than a few nights outside.

The next two addresses revealed similar patrons, each staring at him with pity in their eyes as he headed back out. The tension was ramping up, it seemed like everyone was expecting the city to blow up at any moment. Perhaps it would happen but he hoped to have a few more days of respite before the rogues struck again. Another encounter with the bats did not seem like a very attractive possibility at that time.

The first gang he delivered to greeted him with cheers and clapping, several of the men congratulating him for his win at the Pits. "Two of them!" The oldest of the group repeated over and over again. "Two victories, Pizza Guy!"

He smiled awkwardly, feeling his cheeks burn as the terrible truth settled in his mind. By now, everyone who had even a passing knowledge of the Gotham underworld knew the Marco’s delivery boy was a metahuman. Worse than that, they knew he took part in some very illegal, very violent underground fighting rink. No wonder the bats thought he was up to no goods if they had managed to catch wind of the rumors about him.

"Glad to see you’re back up, heard Orca took a bite outta ya." Another man laughed, twirling a loaded pistol in his hand. He wore a plastic flower on his lapel, it smelled strongly of chemicals.

They cheered again as he left, handing him a wad of bills as a tip, way more than a hundred he estimated. He tried not to look overly disturbed as he walked away. It took everything in his power not to dash off as soon as possible. They knew his face, they knew his occupation.

At least, they didn’t know his name but, unfortunately, it didn’t mean much to him. Just the idea that he could be recognized as a meta was enough to significantly unsettle him. He had expected something similar after his first fight in the Pits but it had happened so much faster than what he had imagined. His first fight had only taken place four days earlier, how fast did information spread in this city exactly?

Then, Marco’s was already the talk of North Gotham, which likely hadn’t helped matters. He sighed, jumping up to a nearby roof, landing smoothly as usual and checking his gear to make sure everything was still in place. This universe was absolutely terrible for his nerves, he felt constantly on edge when he was out at night, especially now that Jason was gone and he had no way of contacting him.

His GPS had him deliver to yet two more civilian families hidden out in a small building of East End. Both of them smelled of weapons and extreme stress. He hoped the little amount of comfort the food would bring them was enough to make them sleep a bit easier that night.

He could not wait until his suit was done to be able to go out unrecognized. Then, he would be able to help them. It was just his luck to have become an easily identifiable figure in the criminal world, his identity would have to be protected even more tightly than in his previous life.

Not that his original universe had been a total win when it came to keeping Spider-Man and Peter Parker as two separate people. In the end, it had caught up to him. Now, he simply had to make sure it did not happen again.

The most unusual of his deliveries turned out to be the last one, as was often the case.

Instead of bringing him to a dark alleyway hosting a gaggle of thugs to cheer him on again, or to a run down civilian building, it led him deep into North Gotham. He ran past gutted storefronts, crouched away from blaring police lights and sneaked past groups of criminal lookouts for several dozen minutes until he finally made it to his destination. A familiar, empty and destroyed Irish pub stood there, bringing back memories he would rather have kept buried.

As he stood in front of it, he almost felt like turning back and running to Marco’s, pretending he had finished his round and hoping nothing bad would happen.

Unfortunately, despite the tips he had gotten that night and the money his boss would pay him, he was running low on funds. He knew who would be waiting for him in the cold, silent pub but there was nothing he could do about it other than face the consequences of his decisions.

His throat tightened as he stepped past the ruined threshold, feet leaving marks in the powdered snow and frost covering the wooden ground. It was not anxiety that caused his breath to quicken but something in the air, sticky and thick. He had been right, she was waiting for him in there. He could smell her now, an odd mix of a beautiful floral scent and the stench of acidic poison mixing together.

He felt like holding his breath but knew that, by now, it was too late. Still, the itching on the back of his neck pushed him to follow his instincts, locking down on his breathing.

"Ivy," he greeted, finding Spider-Man’s personality to be easier to put on than Peter Parker’s. "Long time no see." Air escaped his throat and more came in, even as he tried to stop it from entering his lungs. His throat felt sticky, pain slowly creeping through his body.

She raised an elegant eyebrow from her seat, up several feet above the ground, nestled in a tangle of vines as thick as his body. Her dress was slightly different than the last one he remembered, blue frost flowers cascading down the sides of her waist and arms. From where he was, he could see them shifting, possessed by a life of their own.

"You have grown bolder since the last time we met." Her voice sounded light and low, almost a whisper, yet he heard her clearly. She caressed a large vine of bursting red blooms and thick bark, her eyes fixed on him, dark and cold. "I believe you have earned yourself a punishment."

He barely had time to wonder what she was talking about before it hit him. And, once it did, it took all he had not to collapse to the ground in pure agony.

Something in his throat shifted, moving against the inside of his body, thrashing and clawing at his neck. He gagged, fingers flying to his mouth as spit then blood bubbled out of it. His insides melted and burned, spreading down from his airways. He could feel his veins bulging, bursting…

The pollen forced its way into his nostrils, rushing down into his bloodstream. He wanted to gasp but his mouth would not move when he told it to. Instead, he bent down, spitting crimson fluids and green drool on the wooden floor. Smoke curled up as the poison in him hit the ground, burning away at what was left of the pub’s flooring.

I am going to die.

The thought was oddly clear, the only thing he could focus on as the world blurred around him. He could not move anymore, his muscles spasming and contracting so violently he almost crashed to the ground.

Desperately, he tried to regain control over his limbs. He couldn’t die there, not like this, not now. He was so close to figuring it out, he had even made a friend.

No, no, no.

Not like this.

Not now.

A finger brushed his cheek, his mind too slow to register Ivy as she moved towards him. He wanted to back away but his body was shaking too violently for him to do anything but fall to his knees. He heaved, trying to breathe but finding only blood and pollen to fill his lungs. Was this the end?

"Interesting…" He heard, sound fracturing and disappearing in a rush of buzzing mist. "A human, even meta, having such an extreme reaction."

A hand grabbed his chin, squeezing tightly enough to make him bite down on his already bleeding tongue. He was forced to look up, straight into the green eyes of the villain he had tied his fate to. What a poor decision that had been, and there he was, paying the price.

"It appear this toxin may be lethal to you, child," Ivy mused, her face nothing more than colors blurring together. Her voice was not any better, distorted and almost impossible to understand. "Let me attempt…"

The burning receded slightly as another itching wave of pollen forcefully entered his nose. He tried to free himself for the woman’s grasp, blood dripping from his chin and staining the collar of his new coat. He gasped despite himself, causing yet more plant matter to push its way inside of him. He gagged, clawed at his chest.

"Not an insect, then." She narrowed her eyes, leaning forward slightly to get a better look at him. "Still, I believe this helped somewhat."

As she spoke, the world became clearer around him, confirming her words. Even better, he was starting to feel his legs and arms again. If he really tried, he could tear his hands away from his chest, where they were still clutched. He tried to breathe in, was welcomed by another barrage of sticky air and itching matter.

Some of his strength returned, he stumbled away from Ivy and out of her grasp. Shakily, he wiped some of the drool and blood away from his mouth, grimacing when he saw how damaged his clothes were. He would have to work hard to clean that one up.

"Yes…" The villainess told him, sitting back down on her living seat of vines and flowers. "Not an insect… A little arachnid." The corner of her lips quirked up in something that might have been a smile. "Your kind and my children have always gotten along well, little spider."

More pollen rushed into his nose and, as it spread down his throat and into his lungs, he could feel his healing taking over. Surprisingly, it was significantly faster than it usually would be, which could only mean…

"You poison me," he rasped, "then you heal me?" It hurt to speak yet the pain was nothing compared to the burning he had experienced only a few seconds earlier. He wavered on his feet, pushing himself to stand straight. He could still feel the poison working through his skin, fighting whatever she had done to cure him, trying to tear him apart from the inside.

Ivy waved a hand to the side, causing a flower covered vine to brush against his back, pushing him towards her. He resisted, now feeling well enough to launch into a fight with her if it was needed. He did not think he would win, not without something to protect his nose and ears from intrusion, but he would do his best.

Spider-man would not die here.

"A misunderstanding," she replied eventually, "I was under the impression your mutations were simple enhancements." Her smile appeared extremely out of place considering what had just transpired, yet she went on in a calm voice, as composed as ever: "This experiment of mine aims to cause pain in humans. You, however, are an arachnid."

Peter flinched, realizing that, somehow, she had figured out the source of his abilities. Just like Orca, he was not fully human but instead a hybrid, with a range of abilities going past those of a regular enhancement type mutant. Still, he did not move toward her, keeping his body relaxed and ready to leap into action.

What would she do with that information? She did say his kind got along well with her "children" but, if she was talking about plants, he knew full well a few of them fed on insects and spiders. Instead of reassuring him, her love of vegetation was making him even more wary.

"Why did you even-" He shook his head, trying to find the right words to spare himself another ten minutes of choking on his own blood. "What did you feel made me deserve this?" He left out that he had decided to attack her immediately if she was to do it again. He would not rely on the mercy of a villain next time.

Ivy’s smile disappeared abruptly and her throne of vines shivered, brushed by an invisible breeze. The pressure against his back grew, beckoning him forward, towards her and the cocoon of greenery she had crafted around herself.

Was she to turn it against him, it would likely turn into a coffin, his coffin.

"You hid the full extent of your abilities to me." The woman eventually said, voice chiller than the wind blowing in the dark streets. "Delaying your next fight by letting me believe you needed rest." She shook her head slowly, eyes still fixed on his, unblinking. "This is unacceptable."

The vine behind Peter’s back reached into his pizza bag, dragging out the very last box he had stored in there. It threw it at one of the wood walls, leaving an oily stain as its contents splattered on the ground.

"Repulsive." Ivy sighed. "A pity we must meet in those circumstances, I despise this type of… food."

The way she said the words made him think she did not believe the pizza was even edible, which of course made him want to protest. Marco made all of them from scratch, it wasn’t like they were some generic fast food item!

He kept his mouth shut, crossing his arms instead and sending her a defiant look. She shook her head again, apparently amused at his reaction.

"Your punishment was sufficient, little spider. Now, we must get on to our deal." Her hair shifted as leaves slithered against her head and neck, her children hugging their mother in the only way they could. "I have taken the liberty of scheduling your next two fights. Considering your range of abilities, I moved you up to the Gamma division."

Peter opened his mouth to protest, realized there was nothing he could say that would change her mind, and closed it again. Information gathering was useful but with Jason on his side, he did not need to go through such lengths anymore. He did, however, need a large amount of money to finish up the rest of his equipment.

More than that, if he got enough, he could potentially start building himself a new identity and get out of this cycle of fighting and illegal activities before it was too late to do so. He remembered his landlady promising him information if he were to gather enough funds, but his friend could also likely help on that front.

Fake papers and a falsified background required a lot of cash but if this was what needed to start anew in this world, he would have to go through with it.

"I assume you will be ready by tomorrow evening," Ivy went on. "We will meet at our usual location, once you are done with your… job." Her eyes tightened in disgust once more.

It was hard not to call her out but the blood on his chin was still fresh. It reminded him to keep quiet, at least until he had some form of filter between his lungs and her poisonous pollen. He would have to include that in his first suit, it was quite obviously a priority in Gotham city.

As he thought, Ivy stood from her throne of vines and walked towards him, brushing his shoulder with one of her perfectly manicured fingers. "Be ready, little spider," she whispered in his ear, bending down slightly. "Those opponents will be stronger than what you have faced before."

He bit back a retort about having in fact faced something much worse in the past. It was unlikely she would recognize the names of the villains he had subdued, which made it easy to keep quiet for once.

He watched as she left, her gait so smooth she seemed to be gliding instead of simply walking. She was beautiful, yet their age difference and her homicidal tendencies destroyed any admiration he might have felt for her appearance.

Beauty was not the most important thing to a man or woman, he had learned that lesson while he was still in high school. He wondered how many people forgot it entirely when put in front of Ivy. She surely had a way to twist anyone around her finger, thugs and civilians alike. He still remembered their first meeting, and the way her toxins had affected his perception of her. Very dangerous indeed.

He kept silent until he was sure she was gone, past the snow covered street and far from the run down pub. She had been so casual throughout the entire encounter that he almost felt like he had imagined himself being poisoned. The blood on his coat, however, proved otherwise.

He sighed, scrubbing his face with his cleanest hand, grimacing when it came back stained crimson. Jason would definitely not be pleased about that one. He had just been telling him to be careful after all.

How many more times would he have to fight? He had promised to cut it out as soon as he could, yet there he was, getting dragged into two more battles. Not only that but he had apparently graduated to a higher division. This was getting out of control faster than he had expected.

Peter coughed, a few remaining blood droplets splashing onto the back of his hand. He shook his head, conflicted. He had to tell her those two fights would be his last, and he had to do it sooner rather than later.

"Tomorrow." He promised himself. "I’ll do it tomorrow."

He hoped she would accept it. If not, then he simply had to be on high alert and be ready to bolt before her toxins reached him. At least, until he finished his suit.

Still, the last thing he needed right now was yet another enemy.

Pity his luck was so terrible.
Notes:

    There was originally a fight scene in this chapter but I deleted it lol … I need to stop listening to metal when writing this, it makes me want to put action scenes everywhere.

    Aaaaah I was tidying up my story plan for this and realized we might be close (by like 5 chapters) to the climax of the first major arc. Considering the word count I think I might just end it there and put the second arc in a sequel :P

Chapter 27: Potential
Summary:

    Jason wants to help (he is worried).

Chapter Text

The paper bag rustled as Jason handed him the lunch he had picked up for them earlier. A simple deli sandwich, the kind you could get in any small store that sold food in Gotham.
It tasted divine to Peter, who hadn’t had anything solid to eat since earlier the previous day. He had collapsed on his mattress as soon as they had made it home and had woken up less than an hour earlier, feeling groggy but rested. His throat had fully recovered from his encounter with Ivy, he still remembered the feel of the toxins entering his system, the poison burning through his organs, burrowing into his chest.

He sighed, closing his eyes briefly. Jason was right, he needed to be more cautious.

They ate in silence, which gave him time to look around the building his friend had taken him to. To his surprise, they hadn’t gone to one of the more dangerous areas of the city but to the eastern side of Old Gotham, where ancient industry buildings had been rehabilitated into parks, schools and housing units. Most of the construction zones they had passed by had sported the now familiar logo of Wayne Industries. Of course, not all of the old plants had been hit by the architectural craze, an exception which included the one they were currently sitting in.

With a roof of large, clouded glass panels and sturdy steel beams, only the thick layer of dust on its floor and the fading paintwork along the walls showed it wasn’t ready to open for business again. Well that and the fact all of the machinery was gone, leaving behind an empty space dozens of time as large as his and Jason’s apartments combined. It was surprisingly well lit, even without any electricity and despite the thick layer of snow that still covered the roof. The sun hit it just at the right angle, which was a nice respite from the chill and the wind outside. He had been inside places like this before, when he still protected New York City. Abandoned buildings attracted all sorts of attention, and not all of it was harmless.

"How many hideouts do you own exactly?" He asked, too curious to keep quiet.

He had originally assumed his new friend had a similar background to his, having to make his way through Gotham with little money and no one to help. It was becoming apparent this was not the case. Instead, he was now wondering how much of it had been a lack of funds and how much had been a desire to stay under the radar. Though, if Jason really wanted to remain unnoticed, he probably should ditch that bike of his. That would always stand out when not in the middle of gang infested territories. Even then, despite the disturbingly high amount of weaponry and heavy duty vehicles at the disposition of the city's criminal networks, he had never encountered something quite as memorable as the monstrously large black motorcycle.

"A few." His friend replied, although not without sending him a pointed look, as if to remind him of the previous night. He was still upset about that, which was understandable. "More than a few, actually. I had a lot of cash left over and little way too spend it, really." Money he hadn't earned in any legal way, no doubt. There was no reason to talk about it now, or even to bring it up, but the knowledge his brand new partner had once been involved in extremely shady dealings still stung somewhat. He hadn't expected it and it was a lot to swallow. Parker luck, he supposed.

"How about buying an actual apartment?" Peter pointed out in between bites. The sandwich was good, even now that his stomach felt fuller. Fresh meat, vegetables and just the right amount of spice. It reminded him of his favorite place, back in the day. He'd have to ask where it came from, especially now that he was only hours away from padding his wallet. If he had to fight for Ivy and Harley, he might as well treat himself to something nice with the money he made. He kept on talking as he thought, mouth still half full, which May would have scolded him for.

"Surely this cost more than just buying a few rooms down the street."

Jason’s face twisted, showing how much he cared for the idea of living anywhere bigger than a single room. Hangars and former assembly lines aside, having his own space was obviously not something he cared much for. Likely because, as Peter had suspected earlier, he wanted to stay under the radar. No reasons for a budding crime lord to put himself in danger, after all. He himself had seen how useful it could be to have somewhere to fall back to, after their unfortunate encounter with the Bats.

Still, many of the young criminals he had met in the past had no qualms about spending their illegal income to raise their quality of life. Not all of them did it but, for someone under twenty like they were, he had found it to be rather common. Comfort and luxuries didn't appear to be high on his fellow vigilante's list of priorities. Perhaps it was what one needed, in order to raise up as a prominent criminal in Gotham. It seemed  the kind of city that would eat an inexperienced criminal alive, in between the dozens of villains roaming about, the various gangs and, of course, the fact an entire family of crime fighter had decided to set up shop there. It could very well be there was no other choice than to spend every last penny on contingencies, weapons and emergency exits.

Either way, this remained a very large, very well placed and no doubt very expensive property. How successful had his new partner been if he was able to afford things like this?

"No apartments." Jason said after finishing his sandwich and crumpling the paper in his hand, rolling it into a ball. "Not much use for them right now. And they’re harder to keep without raising suspicion."

"How much did this cost?" Peter gestured at the room around them, at the doors, stairs and ladders that led to hidden offices and smaller work area. "And also how is this easier to hide than an apartment?"

His friend grinned suddenly, amused by his curiosity, or perhaps simply by the question. He tossed the paper ball over his hand, aiming and successfully throwing it straight into the abandoned lunch bag, then turned back to look at him.

"I’m renting this place to a company," Jason smirked, "specializing in long, unfinished, development projects."

"I don’t see any project going on." Peter was almost done with his own food and trying to shake crumbs off of one of his only remaining shirts. He really needed to go shopping. Again. "No machines."

"It hasn’t gone past the first stages of planning yet." His friend replied, pacing. "It’s very common, especially in Gotham. It’s hard to find investment you see, especially if you don’t want to go through Wayne." A familiar glint of disgust in his eyes when he said that name. There was history there, but not one that was obvious or easy to understand. "Of course no one expects anything to be built there, it’s a common trick. It’s why I pay them to stall."

Once again, the young metahuman looked around, taking in a few traces that someone had indeed been there before. Footsteps in the dust, tire marks, those of the bike, no doubt. There had been machines there recently, and a workbench. The place had been emptied and had remained unused for a few months at least. But before that, it must have been used as a base of operations, perhaps back when his friend was still actively trying to break out as a rogue.

"If it’s so common, how come nobody has looked into it?"

Another grin, this time a bit smug. "I make sure something interesting happens here once in a while, not enough to warrant being watched but just enough that it fits in well. A few drug deals, one or two smuggling rings once in a while. If they get busted, I make it look like the whole thing changes hands." He looked quite proud of it too. "They have no idea who really owns the place."

Peter stared at him for a while. He knew his friend had a history of crime but it was still eerie to hear him mention it in such a casual way, especially now that they had agreed to team up as vigilantes. He decided to keep his mouth shut for now and stood up, tossing his own sandwich's wrapping paper into the flimsy bag. He could feel the other teen's gaze as he walked around for a bit, staring up at the glass ceiling and at the melting snow above.

"This is all very interesting," He began, watching a few droplets leak under a cracked panel. "...But I’m assuming you didn’t bring me here to talk about how you bought the place."

He turned back to Jason, who nodded calmly, joining him at the foot of the stairs he had decided to stop next to. Most of his anger from the previous night was gone, and he was back to his usual confident demeanor. He hadn't been happy to learn that Peter did not, in fact, own a gas mask. Apparently, that was an astonishing lack of foresight in Gotham, not that he had any idea before he had been told, of course. Usually, toxins aimed at regular humans affected him either in different unique ways or significantly more weakly. He had not expected to come across someone with the ability to change the composition of a poison at the very same time it was being released. Mutations and alien powers were becoming more common in his old universe, at least when he had left it, but it had been nothing compared to what he was seeing there. 

"You’re right." His neighbor nodded, bringing him back to the present. "I brought you here because I want to see you in action."

The meta frowned, tilting his head to the side slightly. "You want to-" He shook his head, confused. "What do you mean?"

"I haven’t yet acted out against any of the other rogues," Jason explained, "which will change soon. Until then, I am invited to any and all of those events you like to participate in." He said it nonchalantly, rolling his shoulders as he walked away from the staircase.

"I don’t like to participate in them." Peter protested, which was only somewhat true. He did not enjoy the fighting, but it was still his choice to go there, and he knew he could have stood up to Ivy had he really wanted to. The sentence’s meaning fully hit him then, and his eyes widened. "Wait. Are you coming tonight?"

He wasn't expecting a positive reply and it took him a few seconds to register the nod for what it was.

"I’ll be in the crowd, in case anything goes wrong. I know a few ways out of there."

He felt a wave of relief wash over him, just knowing he wouldn’t be alone this time around. Of course, he would still be the one fighting and there wouldn’t be anyone at his side when it came to winning, but his friend would still be right there. Not only that, but they had escaped danger together before and he trusted they would be able to again. It might be slightly too optimistic, to think they'd be able to pull away from the Pits in case of an emergency, but it was better than the dread that had been simmering in his chest since he had woken up. 

"Thank you!" He grinned at Jason, who turned away almost immediately, clearing his throat. 

"What else am I supposed to do?" The dark haired teen snapped unconvincingly. "Anyway, I don’t want to spend the whole evening wondering if I should rescue you, so I want to see you fight."

Peter’s smile faded slightly. He looked around the large space, suddenly understanding why this place out of every hideout that was apparently at their disposal, was the one Jason chose. A wide open area with an even ground and little in the way of obstacles across all of its length. He meant for it to be a training ground, somewhere they could spar at. He shook his head silently, already knowing he had no desire to go against the only person he considered to be on his side in this universe. He had fought regular humans before, and it always tended to end with at least one or two injuries on the side of his opponents.

"You have a lot of strength, and quite a fair bit of speed." The former rogue went on, not looking at his face and therefore missing the discomfort he knew had to be there. "But I haven’t seen you fight one on one before, which I need to do before we go out. If we end up having to carve a way out tonight, I’d rather know what to expect."

"I-"

How could he explain, in a nice way, that he didn’t want to hurt his friend by accident? He felt saying it too honestly would be hurtful, yet it was true. Jason was obviously experienced when it came to fighting, but he was no meta. He had trained with others before, a few times, but the Avengers had long stopped inviting him over for practice sessions and it had been years now. Even then, he had mostly paired off against the most powerful and experienced of his colleagues, those who could keep up with his abilities. Even if he managed to hold his strength back, there was always the risk of-

His Spider Sense tingled, warning him just in time for him to pivot to the side, dodging a kick that would have landed straight on his nose had he not reacted. The foot passed a few inches from his face and he smelled metal in the thick soles, which had looked completely normal to him only a few moments ago. Something had been dampening the scent, a type of paint perhaps.
Even without super strength behind it, a kick from boots like that had the potential to break his skin, at the very least. He tried to speak, call the impromptu sparring session off, but he was already caught in the moment, and all he could do now was dodge and restrain himself as much as he could.

Instead of stumbling, Jason kept attacking, bringing his leg back in an arc, armored heel aimed at Peter’s head. The meta threw his arms up, easily blocking the blow. He pushed against the other boy's ankle, taking great care not to put too much strength behind the shove. Jason twisted around the push, turning around and slamming the back of his hand where his temples had been a heartbeat earlier. He was not holding back, coming at him with all he had and not giving him any space to talk or protest. 

His superior speed allowed him to easily dodge or block anything his friend tried against him and he had no trouble holding his ground when they were matched in a contest of strength. He didn’t dare hit back, not wanting to accidentally break a bone or crack a rib, but he stayed a few steps ahead at all times. He tried to put space in between them, only to have it closed in moments and be forced to avoid another barrage of punches or a particularly vicious kick.

Despite this, he couldn't help but be impressed. It was incredible how fast Jason could move without the use of any meta power. Every single one of his strikes was smooth and, had they been evenly matched, without any help from mutations, there was no question as to who would have won the encounter. As it was, it remained painfully easy for Peter to slide and dodge around his friend’s attempts to get to him. He could see there was a massive gap in between their respective skill levels but his own powers allowed him to bridge it and surpass it without a second thought. It made him feel a bit bad, there was-

His neck tingled and he rolled under a punch that could easily have shattered his chin were he a regular teenager. He stepped aside, ready to avoid the kick to his waist he could see was coming and-

He felt something push his shoulder, just as the foot he thought was going for his midsection hit the back of his ankle. He was so surprised by the change of pace he found himself falling backward, only to be grabbed by two powerful hands and twisted around in a grapple. This wasn’t an issue, he only had to use a bit of his strength to free himself, just enough that he wouldn't risk hurting anyone but also-

An arm around his neck, a hand gripping his head.

"If I twist," Jason said calmly, "You’re dead."

It wasn't true. Peter's bones were stronger than a regular human's, and he doubted he could be killed so easily but he kept his mouth shut, going limp and hoping it would be enough for the fight to end.

Blessedly, Jason let go of him immediately after that, helping him to his feet with an apologetic grin. Surprisingly, he looked barely out of breath. After what must have been minutes of fighting at a speed and intensity that only a few world class athletes could attain, his cheeks were only slightly redder than usual and his heartbeat was already slowing down to its regular rhythm. If the precision in his blows hadn't made it obvious before, this was yet another indication he was more than used to this level of combat.

To be this adept at fighting at such a young age suggested something very dark, something Peter had encountered before, in the past of some of his former allies.

He shivered. Gotham was a dangerous place indeed.

Another piece of the puzzle slid into place, and he could almost see the final picture. Yet, there was no point focusing on it now, especially not as his friend began to talk, looking and sounding gravely serious.

"You can’t underestimate me, simply because I’m not a meta." Jason said, pointing at him, tone calm despite his words. "Had I had a gun hidden on me, you would be dead four times over, and I am not the most efficient fighter you can find in Gotham."

Peter didn't speak yet, not knowing how honest he wanted to be. He was more than able to dodge bullets, if he used all of his speed, but it was true he had let his guard down. Had he been fighting a meta, that could have been a serious mistake but, as it was, he only had his own attitude to blame. He hadn't been careful enough. No... He had underestimated his opponent, let himself be lulled into a rhythm of dodging and blocking, becoming predictable.

Had he tried, he could have easily defeated the other teen. The issue was, he had not tried. He didn’t want to use his powers against someone he liked, not if they weren’t wearing armor of some sort. Jason was in his usual jeans, black shirt and leather jacket. If he took a punch from him, he could easily shatter a bone, and that was a best case scenario. This was a risk Spider Man could take, although he preferred to avoid it with the use of his webs. Outside of the suit, the mere idea of going against someone like this made him uncomfortable. It reminded him of his first fight in the Pits, of the street thugs he had to face even before that, of how easy it had been to submit all of them, beat them to a pulp. He could have killed someone, back then. 

But Jason was more skilled than they were, wasn’t he? Yet he couldn’t forget the noise their bones had made when they snapped, the smack of flesh against flesh and the smell of blood. He didn’t want it to happen again, especially not to someone he liked.

"That look…" Jason spat on the ground. "You don’t get it. Holding back isn’t an option in Gotham, not unless you want to die." He looked genuinely angry, although he did not glare at him.

"You wouldn’t kill me." Peter retorted, knowing he was right. "And what use would it be to break your bones before we even start out?"

His words didn't help matters, only causing the other boy's brows to furrow further.

"Believe me kid, there are many things in Gotham that could make me turn against you. Toxins aren’t even the only option, in this fucking city." He looked annoyed, frustrated. "I’ve met people as fast and strong as you, and they have better technique. You’ve been lucky so far, but it won’t always be the case. You need to listen to me before it's too late."

"I’ve had training before." He protested, remembering hours spent with the Avengers, going through drills and mock sparring. It hadn't been much but it had taught him solid moves, ones he had used many times over his years of crime fighting. "And you're underestimating how many blows I can take."

"I can tell you’ve had some training." Jason nodded. "But I can also tell it was not consistent, and it didn’t teach you much beyond proper footwork and some basic forms. Not that you used those, of course." He walked closer, hands now in his pockets. "You leave yourself open and you don’t look out for obvious tells. You rely on your instincts and though that’s generally good, it also hinders you because of your lack of experience. You could win against me, if you tried to, but you hold yourself back so much trying isn't even an option."

"I'm not-" Peter closed his mouth just before he let out he had more years of fighting under his belt than he had admitted to. Still, it was quite uncomfortable having to hear his skills dissected so thoroughly. It was true he was more experienced using all of his abilities together, especially his webs, but he was also no beginner. He could feel the worry in his friend, he understood why he thought it was necessary for him to practice but he had never had to in the past.

And look how well you've been doing here.

The stray thought broke through above all others, reminding him of the fire, of the crumbling buildings and of the injuries he had sustained fighting Orca. He had to resort to beating her down mercilessly, he hadn't seen any other way out. What if he had known her weak spots, what if he had learned how to defeat people without having to break them apart or string them up with his webs? He looked down at his hands, knowing he had gone up against gods and monsters with them but also remembering how much of his survival had been thanks to the actions of others or to his own luck. He had fought well for himself, he knew he was pretty smart. He had also messed up, and had to see a lot of people die over the years.

He’d always thought his constant going out and confronting criminals was enough to keep him sharp but even he could tell there was a world of difference between his reliance on his strength and his friend’s sheer level of skill.

"I’ll help you with it, so it won’t be an issue for long." Jason patted his shoulder. "I know a thing or two about martial arts. You'll be terrifying when I'm done with you."

"I’m still not going to hit you." Peter shook his head, hands turning to fists. Even if he was conflicted, it didn’t feel right. He didn't want to hurt his only ally.

"You don’t understand. This is also something we can work on." The older teen slipped his hands out of his jacket and smiled, anger already fading. "Here. Don’t move, alright?"

The meta opened his mouth, confused. Before he could ask what that meant, he got his answer. Jason’s fist shot upwards, right at his eyes. His body screamed at him to dodge, step or roll out of the way, block it at least. His friend’s words kept him stuck in place. What kind of lesson was that supposed to teach him? Was it some kind of punishment for being too trusting? A way of getting back at him after what happened with Ivy?

Instead of slamming into his face as it should have, the hand stopped at the last possible moment, knuckles brushing against his skin. All of the strength had faded, or perhaps it had been pulled back. He let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding, relieved he hadn't been hit after all, although it probably wouldn't have hurt much. He had fully expected the punch to connect, it had looked undistinguishable from all the others he had dodged, a few minutes earlier.

"With only basic technique, you lack control." Jason went on, letting his arm fall back down to his side. He seemed completely unbothered by what had just happened. "Knowing you lack control, it affects your confidence and it leads to situations like the one earlier. You hold back more than it is necessary, you open yourself up to feints and traps."

"Isn’t that just holding back too?" Peter’s eyes flickered to the now relaxed fist. "You stopped yourself from hitting me."

Another strike came as soon as the words left his mouth. This one didn’t stop, keeping its speed and strength until it hit his chest, where it pushed in harmlessly. One of the weakest punches he had ever felt. It had looked so threatening, though.

"The difference," Jason said calmly, "is I trust myself to control my strength." He shrugged and stepped back. "It’s not the only thing. Even with your speed, you move more than you have to, and useless movement is never good. I'd be able to tell you more if you actually tried to fight back, of course."

Peter knew he hadn’t been trained for long in any kind of fighting style. The lessons he had in the past were more meant to serve in case of an emergency or in addition to his web slinging than to be all encompassing. He knew solid, basic forms for kicks, punches and other types of strike but they had all been incorporated into a rather eclectic assemble of swinging, jumping and using the terrain to his advantage.
It had never hindered him before but he was at a point where he had to fight without any of his tools, in the Pits at least.

Now that it had happened once, he couldn’t help but think it might occur again in the future. He had to keep Spider-Man and Peter the delivery guy as two different individuals in the eye of the public. Even if his civilian persona was starting to attract unwanted attention, he couldn’t use his regular tricks to deal with it. He’d have to learn other skills in order to keep up, especially if any of the rogues decided they were interested in him, which he was starting to fear they might.

So here he was, having to listen while Jason explained how he planned to familiarize him with different fighting philosophies and how he needed to lose his apprehension of hitting regular humans. According to him, hesitating at the wrong moment could be deadly in Gotham, no matter who you were facing.

"It’s not only that," the young man continued, "A lot of metas here turned their powers into a business. That means they’re better trained, equipped and experienced than you would expect, and the older among them are leagues above your level." He seemed to be talking from experience and there was no hesitation in his assessment.

Of course, he didn't know about the whole scope of Peter's powers and had no idea they were derived from a spider's, but the serious edge in his partner’s voice was enough to make him worry. He tried to imagine someone just as strong, as fast as he was, paired with intense training. Even without his durability, flexibility and ability to stick to any surfaces, this would be a frightening enemy. 

He had gone up against a few people like this in the past. It had never been a fun experience.

"How can the other vigilantes keep up, then?" He asked, now feeling more open to the idea of getting some additional training in.

"Depends. Some vigilantes are insanely powerful, the kind you and me couldn’t even touch without some kind of trap in place."

Superman must be one of those. The Internet had made him seem like some kind of god, powerful above all others on this planet. He wasn’t the only one, from what he remembered. This version of Earth was host to a slew of powerful individuals. More than his own, or at least he thought so.

"Some use tech, drugs, anything to have an edge." Jason listed. "A lot of smart people survive that way, actually."

Tony had been similar to those, with his suits. The Bats were a bit like that, too, with their massive vehicles and the gadgets they'd been using the last time they met.

"In Gotham, being prepared for everything and knowing the terrain is often the best you can do. Most of the time, it’ll keep you alive."

That one obviously applied to him, what with the amount of hiding places the young man had at his disposition. He even smiled as he said it, probably thinking it to be the wisest option between all of them.

Jason took a break from his speech to drink from one of the water bottle he’d brought over alongside their lunch. He tossed Peter one from across the room and went on as he drank. The sun was still high above the roof, it would be several hours before they had to head out for their deliveries. They had time to talk more, and it was becoming obvious where the conversation was headed.

"You have a lot of potential. You can beat me as you are now. But I think we both know you could use some training, and I can’t help you with that until you at least try to fight back."

Peter sighed, understanding what the whole speech had been leading up to. He lowered his bottle and frowned, wiping his mouth.

"Are you going to make me punch you, now?"

"Yes." Jason nodded.

And so, he did.
Notes:

    MCU Peter Parker does have a lot of experience fighting shit and saving people but he hasn't had much official training. I kinda wonder how scary he can be, pushed to his own physical limits.
    In other words this is the beginning of the Spidey training program.

    Also I'm back for the final stretch of the story. There will be a sequel, and we probably still have at least ten chapters to go before the end of this one.

    VIOLENCE in the next chapter.

    Sequel will probably be called "Red Hood and the Spider".

Chapter 28: A contest of strength

Chapter Text

Peter sighed as a speck of white ice fell into the palm of his hand. It seemed there would be no end to the constant cold. As soon as some of the snow melted, it would come back over the next evening and pile up during the night. It hadn't been so difficult to bear back when he had the Iron Spider. That suit had been perfectly insulated, it even had an emergency heating system. No such comfort now, he had to deal with his cheap clothes.

He looked up from his reddening fingers and the melting snowflake, peering around the docks for a shock of red hair but finding none. Ivy was making him wait this time, and he hadn’t planned on standing still in the wind for more than a few minutes. He sighed, wishing he had thought of bringing gloves or at least a scarf. The chill wouldn’t be dangerous even if he had to remain there for another hour but it was uncomfortable. He almost felt jealous of Jason, who had headed in much earlier in the evening and was probably sitting in the crowd by then. Being warm and dry seemed almost worth the disturbing looks he had gotten after his last fight. Almost.

The occasional sounds of dock workers and the odd civilian walking around was almost smothered by the rolling of the waves as they crashed against concrete and stone. He still heard all of it, of course. He couldn't turn his enhanced senses off, which had led to him listening to a great deal of music back in the days. Perhaps he could spend a bit of the money he earned tonight on a phone and a pair of earbuds. He missed swinging in between buildings to the voices of his favorite artists. He'd have to see how much he made from this, he had been moved to a higher division after all and that had to influence the payout. Perhaps it was why it started later. If that was the reason, he felt a bit annoyed that he hadn't been warned.

Of course, something like that was to be expected when dealing with Ivy. She was the type of person who would murder him without a second thought if she ever felt he was going against her interests. And if she wasn't, she surely acted the part. Harley had been almost as intimidating in her own way, no wonder the two of them were dating. Seriously, of all people he had to get entangled with it had to be these two...

He kicked a large pile of snow, watching it explode around his foot and fall back down to the ground. The worst part about the entire situation was the utter lack of entertainment. At least, in his universe, when he was in a stakeout he could get Karen to play music or a podcast to keep him entertained. He even managed to teach her to play board games with him, all of it purely through voice of course. All of that training and programming had gone to waste and he was back to having to be patient. Perhaps he could convince Jason to play phone chess with him when they went on patrol.

Minutes ticked by excruciatingly slowly, not that he was able to measure it without a watch or a screen to tell him the time. He estimated it to be almost midnight by now, and he was starting to feel hungry. He hadn't had time to grab anything from his boss' kitchen before he rushed out, not wanting to antagonize Ivy. Worst part was the man had cooked Jason and him a warm meal, not pizza for once. His friend had grabbed his, maybe he had expected it to take this long. Next time, Peter would do the same.

A crunch.

Snow.

Someone walking a few streets away from the coast. Light steps. Skittering, a hundred legs, thousands of insects.

Or a living dress of rustling leaves.

Peter took a deep breath, straightened his back, trying to remember who he was, what he had faced in the past. It wasn't too difficult but still, he felt disturbed.

Ivy intimidated him.

Her ability to control plants might be one of the coolest things he had ever seen, and he would have loved to talk to Ned about it, but her equally impressive talent with poisons and toxins gave him the creeps. He wasn't used to having to worry about those kinds of attacks. The Iron Spider used to detect toxins and gases well before they could reach him. He'd have to implement the feature into his new suit as soon as he could. He did appreciate his friend's eagerness to get him a gas mask,  but it was pretty awkward to carry around and he felt the inner coat pocket he'd stuffed it in looked way too bulky to avoid suspicion. 

Of course, this being Gotham, everyone he met likely assumed he was carrying a firearm. He didn't feel like correcting them if they did, it probably kept people from bothering him.

He felt sweat run down his back as the odd mixture of footsteps and moving vegetation turned around the corner. He could see his fellow metahuman approaching in the shadows of one of the many hangars built along the docks. She wore a coat of shivering winter roots, twisted in odd, squirming shapes. He watched as it morphed into a long dress, buds sprouting flowers and leaves along the sleeves. Must be useful to be able to change your clothes like that, he thought. With how quickly his shirts were getting damaged, he would soon have to spend hours scrubbing bloodstains and fixing rips and tears to try and salvage most of them. Gotham wasn't very nice to his wardrobe.

"Good evening." Ivy greeted him, not slowing down as she walked past.

He wanted to roll his eyes but stopped himself just in time. For all he knew, she would have been able to see it and even with the gas mask, he didn't want to risk another dose of her toxins.

And so, he followed her without a word, hands shoved in his pockets. Of course, she didn't apologize for being late, leading him instead towards the now familiar path to the underground. Thick roots split the snow in front of her, breaking and pushing shards of ice away before she had to step on them. He hadn't noticed her doing this before but he had also been significantly more anxious back then. Knowing what was about to happen helped his nerves tremendously, he felt more lucid this time around. He tried to hang onto that, he would need it.

"Good evening." He replied, too late to be polite, although he hadn't meant to offend her.

It was hard not to be distracted by the ever shifting patterns of her dress or by the fight he knew was coming. The person he'd be fighting would be stronger than Orca had been, and he could still remember her teeth ripping through his skin. He had underestimated her, hadn't gone all out. But he had to find a balance in between winning and keeping the full extent of his abilities secret. It was hard to gauge how powerful the average mutan-meta was in this universe. Some seemed strong enough to take on Thanos himself and come out as the winner, others only had a few superhuman traits, as was more common from where he came from. Not only that but he had found multiple mention of magic in the old news articles he had taken to scrolling to before going to bed.

They walked down the old stairway and past the frozen waste water, down into a long corridor of grimy stones and half submerged rubble. This place had seen more than just a few people passing by, he could see impact marks on some of the walls. Yet other details he hadn't noticed the previous time. All he remembered from his last two trips to the Pits had been the sequences of turns and the directions to take, which he had memorized more out of habit than anything else. Right, go down, go up, left. It would be a maze to anyone who had never been led to it before, he could easily picture someone getting lost down there, taking hours, perhaps days to find their way back out.

The door was the same as he remembered, guarded by two armed men and barely keeping the rumble of the crowd contained. He could hear some of it if he focused, a low whisper ready to turn into a roar as soon as they stepped into the arena proper.

"Good luck in there kid." One of the guards whispered as he walked past, patting his back with an encouraging smile. "If anybody makes it out, it'll be you." He winked down at him, sounding cheerful. He even gave him a thumbs up.

Peter slowed down slightly, frowning at the man. He was being recognized as himself now, even if it was only by people connected to the fighting rink. He'd have preferred to save fame, or infamy, for later, once he put on his suit. He didn't have good experiences with the public at large, and the Mysterio disaster was still fresh. At least this time there was no fall from grace and no unscrupulous journalists to write articles about every single details of his life. 

Thoughts about his unfortunate lack of a secret identity fled from his mind as the entrance creaked open, letting in the artificial glow of distant ceiling lights and the grumbling of the waiting crowd. He had been wrong, there was no screaming.

They must have arrived in between two fights, he could smell alcohol, blood and the strong chemical scent of cleaning products overpowering them both. He stepped forward, following Ivy to the edge of the stairs. As before, he was handed a pair of shorts and a sleeveless shirt by one of the employees. This time it was a man, tall and lanky, dressed as if he was about to attend some grand ball or a fancy party. Most of the staff members he could see scattered around the arena sported the same uniform and he spotted a metallic shine on their sleeves. The buttons of their coats, he noted, were engraved with small umbrellas. This rung a bell with some of the studying he'd been forcing himself to do but he couldn't focus on it for too long, especially once his gaze landed on the cage sitting in the center of the room.

It was as large as he remembered, resting on a damaged stone floors, covered in cracks and stains. Fresh blood shone on the thick metal bars. Someone had repaired them after Orca tore them apart, although he recognized some of the damage on the ground, where rods of steel had almost impaled him. His opponent's last gambit before he had managed to beat her down. He felt Ivy walk away silently, not having spoken a word to him since she first greeted him. Being who she was, it was hard to know if she was angry at him or simply acting in character.

His eyes scanned the crowd, trying to spot his friend. He glanced over hundreds of faces, failing to recognize anyone he knew. Eyes stared back at him, whispers reached his ears. They were still calling him "pizza guy", of all things. Worse, it appeared all of them had at least heard of who he was and what he did for a living. Marco wouldn't be pleased about that and neither was he. Keeping Spider-Man's identity secret would be even harder than in his previous universe with his civilian face and his voice already so well known in the underground.

Giving up on spotting Jason, he tucked the clothes under his arm and made his way to the changing room. He had to focus on something, the noise and the smells were getting unbearable. He could feel a tension in the room, apprehension and the fever of a riled-up crowd. His hands felt cold, his throat was dry. He was still hungry, which felt completely inappropriate at this moment.

Perhaps they should think about selling food at those events, nothing like a nice warm hotdog when watching two mutants beat each other to half death.

He pushed the door open, closing it as fast as he could to give his senses some respite. It was warmer in there than it had been outside but he could still feel a deep chill. This far underground, the cold seeped in from the walls, the ceilings and the floors. He wasn't looking forward to undressing and putting on the flimsy sports shirt, as soft as it felt.

He took a few steps, regaining his bearings as his ears stopped ringing.

Then, he noticed him.

There was someone in the room with him, sitting on one of the two benches in front of the row of lockers bolted to the far wall.

Oddly, Peter began to feel uneasy. Not in a human way either but rather as a primal, animalistic instinct that told him something was wrong.

He tasted danger but his neck remained free of any tingling. Whatever the risk was, it was not immediate. The aura of the stranger, however, was overwhelming.

The second thing he noticed about the figure after his intimidating presence was his size. He towered over the room without needing to stand, his shoulders as large as three men's, his muscles curling thick and unnatural around every inches of his body. It reminded him of the stranger he'd chased down a few days earlier, a dark memory which wasn't helped by the sharp scent of something artificial, unnatural. It was all so similar it made his skin prickle, hairs standing on his arms and legs.

"Ah..." His opponent said, his voice almost as deep as the Bat's had been back on that rooftop. "Are you the Gamma?"

Peter didn't reply, still taking in the scene. He could see a thick metallic suitcase laying on the ground next to the man's feet and a small bag full of odd instruments next to it. Tubes and plugs, some of them still wet. He frowned, looking back up. The stranger was wearing the usual Pit fighter uniform, fabric straining to contain his bulging muscles but somehow still holding on. There were scars along his neck and limbs, round holes covered up by layers of damaged skin. As for his face...

"We're allowed to wear masks?" Peter couldn't believe it. Here he was, having shown everyone his face and powers... and he could have been hiding his identity from the very beginning! Why would Ivy lie to him about it? Was she trying to manipulate him in some way?

The man's mask stuck close to his face, highlighting a jawline that was too thick, features that were too strong, almost deformed. It hid his eyes behind two red lenses, shaped to look like a cruel frown. He looked straight at the fabric as it stretched, pulled by the smile hiding under. It was a sinister thing, with no joy and simply dark, cruel mockery behind it. It was only then that he recognized the man, not a simple thug nor a meta looking for money like he was, but one of the rogues who regularly came back to haunt Gotham. He didn't think this one had any meta abilities, beyond...

"You are not allowed to, boy. You and the rest of the crabs fighting to get to the top of Penguin's bucket." Bane replied calmly, bending down to scoop the metal suitcase in his hand. He dropped it next to him, the weight of it causing the bench he was sitting on to creak ominously. How it was holding both him and it up, Peter had no idea. "I did not come to play at fighting and parade before the crowd." The villain growled, turning the case towards him and thumbing it open. A soft green glow lit the sharp angles of his features, making him seem more like a monster than a man. "I am quite grateful for the opportunity to find powerful foes so easily, though. I have been waiting for one of your kind to face me all evening. There is nothing like testing your steel against something stronger than you are, is there not?"

The rogue lifted his head slightly after he spoke, pretending he wanted an answer to his rhetorical question.

Without breaking eye contact, Bane slipped a tube, no, a syringe out of the thick case, raising it in front of him, letting its light spread to the rest of the room.

It smelled like poison.

"Interesting formula, this one." His low voice took on a wondering tone. Peter could see a bead of sweat rolling down the man's neck, a slight shaking of the hands. Still, the criminal's voice was steady as he examined the liquid, rolling the glass tool in between his fingers, admiring it like a precious jewel. "Ace had the core of it right, it just needed to be refined." The same unnatural creases in his mask, another smile. "A man ought to use the tools at his disposal."

Satisfied with what he had seen in the glowing liquid, the large man lowered the needle towards his thigh. His fingers trembled ever so slightly but he easily pushed it into his skin, in between two bulging muscles. Instead of injecting the drug, he slowly rolled his head over to stare at the teen.

"You should get ready, boy. I don't have much patience left. You are the Gamma, are you not?"

"I am." Peter replied. He began to walk forward again, slipping his coat off. He felt the criminal shift as he neared him, tilting his head and watching him all the way to the lockers. The lenses did not blink, his breathing was so low it would have been imperceptible ton anyone but a metahuman. "Am I the first tonight?" The boy asked, storing his winter clothes as casually as he could with the weight of a murderer's gaze on his back.

"I must admit," Bane spoke, ignoring his question. The syringe, still full of the glowing poison, had not yet been pushed into his veins. "I am disappointed with the quality of the fighters here. You are the only one who really caught my interest."

"You've seen me fight before, then?"

The teen rested his back against the wall of lockers, crossing his arms in front of his chest. It was easier to keep himself calm if he pretended he was wearing his suit.

"Not in person." The rogue had not looked away from him once since he had first set eyes on him. "You see..." His finger twitched, pushing the needle in further but stopping after a fraction of a second. The liquid was still there, swirling in the glass tube. "... Powerful tools require willpower and expertise to use properly." He pressed further, once more stopping before triggering the mechanism. Peter could see more sweat forming on his neck, a rhythmic twitching of the jaw. "A fool would let himself be controlled by his own tools, become a slave to them." The lenses caught some of the green light, adding to the eeriness of the scene. Still, he spoke with little to no emotion, as if he were not moments away from injecting a dangerous chemical into his veins. "A wise man knows the right way of using his arsenal is to refine it. Control and power."

Bane gave a last push, letting the metal bite into his flesh. The glowing toxin swirled into his body sluggishly but he did not react overtly, aside from a low grunt. His muscles, however, strained and twisted, expanding even further to give him the allure of a giant straight out of a fantasy book. The shirt he wore tore in several places, unable to stretch any further. Under the fabric, skin rolled and shook violently, shifting and changing faster than should ever have been possible. Once more, he was reminded of that night, of the chase and of the terrible sight that had welcomed him at the end of it.

"Control and power, boy." The villain's voice was distorted, raspy. "You will help me further refine this tool. A man must know what he wields so he doesn't become a slave, don't you agree?"

Peter slipped his shoes on, quickly tying them. This guy was a villain but he was also a regular human, although one empowered by the use of drugs. He pieced together what he remembered about his opponent. He had appeared more than a decade earlier and had operated in the city for several months before disappearing, beaten by the Bat. Ever few years, he would return, usually in an attempt to seize power in Gotham. He was known to reach near superhuman levels of strength and speed under the influence of extreme performance enhancers.

This shouldn't be too hard, if he only thought about their respective physical abilities. Drugs could only bring a regular human so far and Spider-Man had only ever been matched in power when facing mutants, aliens and very advanced technology. He knew how dangerous rogues were in Gotham but, inside of a fighting cage, without any guns or henchmen to distract him, he had no reason to lose. On top of that, this would be his first battle of the day, compared to the older man's streak in the Pits.

A streak he had won so easily he had just been complaining about it.

The metahuman bit his lip, scolding himself. He just had a talk with Jason about not underestimating his enemies and here he was, already falling back into that pattern. He glanced at Bane, who was calmly storing his syringe and bag of tools away in a locker, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. He remembered what all those tubes and trinkets were for now. The man wore them pushed directly into his body, to keep it pumped full of drugs at all times.

This wasn't his regular formula though, was it? He'd said something about someone named "Ace" making or helping make the new version, at least before it had been refined, as he put it. The name did not ring any bell but Jason might know more about it. He filed it down into a corner of his mind, focusing back on the moment and on the fight that was quickly approaching.

The rogue had talked about refining his tools, testing his steel. And the way he had stared at that liquid, so enthralled his hands hadn't stopped shaking until he'd pushed it into his veins... It had to be a new version of his usual drug, otherwise there would be no need to test it, no reason for the reverence the man had shown it. He couldn't go by the information he had memorized about Bane. For all he knew, this compound would be twice as effective as his old one and would bring him closer to Peter's own level of strength.

It made sense. Why would a man like Bane come down to a place like this, where no name metas fought in front of a crowd for attention and money, if not to challenge himself and see the limits of his new tool? He wasn't seeing this a serious enterprise but simply as a field test. It would have been insulting, had he not known how infamous the man was.

He kept watching the giant's back as he pushed open the door, letting in the constant rumble of the crowd and a slow rush of cold air. Silently, Peter fell in line behind him, following the criminal down the steps that led to the cage and trying to ignore how loud and bright everything was. He had to get into the right mental space, remember he wasn't playing the part of a civilian but wasn't quite supposed to be as strong as his vigilante self. No sticking, he remembered. Absolutely no sticking, under any circumstances.

They stepped into the rink and, as the heavy metal doors closed behind them, he noticed the blood had been scrubbed clean, leaving behind the familiar smell of chemicals. It mixed into Bane's own unnatural scent in such a way he had to focus not to gag. Yet another issue with not being able to wear his mask: he had nothing to protect him from the sensory overload that came with his powers. It usually wasn't an issue, even when he was working at a lab, but the environment of the illegal rink and the anxiety it caused him were making him significantly more sensitive.

"Make this worth my time." Bane rasped, muscles spasming and twisting around his neck, red lenses shining with a disturbing glow, reflecting the bright lights above them. As he spoke, the crowd dimmed, disappearing into the shadows as all spotlights turned towards the cage and the two men standing at its center.

With a deep breath, Peter slipped away from his usual self and into his fighting persona. He leaned back slightly and smirked, regaining confidence in himself.

"I'm not sure you'll be able to hit me, big boy." He snarked, rising his arms in an approximation of one of the fighting stances he had been taught in the past.

"Believe me," the rogue growled, mask twitching as his skin shivered under the influence of the drugs. "I will do more than that."

And, suddenly, Bane was moving.

But it wasn't towards him.

Apparently not having watched his previous fights in person did not mean the rogue hadn't learned about his previous experiences in the Pit. He was taking a page out of Orca's book, lunging for the thick metal bars, no doubt intending to try and impale him on one of them. He wanted to keep him far, then, no doubt because he knew he only had his drugs to protect himself and was no metahuman. Peter raised an eyebrow but did not panic, instead deciding to close the distance between them before the older man had the chance to start throwing his improvised weapons. He wouldn't let the rogue set the pace of the fight and, if he wanted to attack him at a distance, the best thing to do must be to take it to close quarters.

He did not use his full speed, keeping half of it in reserve for a surprise if the fight did not go as he intended. As such, he had time to see the frame of the cage bend and tear as the giant heaved with a grunt, tearing off a large portion of it and picking a rod as tall as he was from the wreck. 

He would have no time to throw it, Peter was already on him. Staying low to the ground, he crouched and swung a leg at the taller man, aiming to knock him off balance, testing the waters for now. Unsurprisingly, Bane dodged it easily. Rather unfortunately, the teen's neck started tingling.

"Idiot!" Bane roared.

Then, he swung the rod directly at him, aiming down at his head with enough strength to crush his skull.

It was only the warning given by his Spider sense that allowed the metahuman to roll to the side, barely dodging the expert strike. The rogue did not stop, however, bringing the improvised weapon back in a swift arc, this time targeting his exposed back. He was faster than the regular human, past the limits of even a world class athlete's physic. Peter had to throw himself to the ground again, using his hands to spring away from the man, cursing mentally when Bane immediately followed after him. The way he wielded the staff betrayed many years of expertise and every hit was precisely aimed and swift enough that he knew it would hurt him if he didn't manage to dodge it in time. It might not incapacitate him, but it would definitely be extremely painful.

Clearly, this had never been intended to be a long range battle. Instead, he was beginning to think he had been lured in and this was exactly what his opponent had been planning. He was bridging the gap between their respective abilities by using a weapon that gave his blows more strength and greater reach. More than that, the way he was swinging it made it almost impossible for Peter to find an opening in his defense. The metal rod swirled around in his hands, fluid as water, strong as steel. The ground shattered with each strike that missed but, as he fell into a rhythm of dodging and stepping aside or back, he found himself analyzing his enemy. He had underestimated him, obviously, but there was still ways for him to win.

Bane was more experienced, older and more adept at fighting. He had a weapon that could potentially kill him if it hit his head. He could heal from many things but a shattered skull was not one of them. Of course, it might not have enough power behind it to fully destroy his brain but he didn't feel like putting that theory to the test. For that matter, he had no idea if he could survive a direct blow through the heart, which made it yet another area of his body he had to keep protected. The giant was about twice as fast as a human at peak potential, and likely three times stronger, if the small craters he left on the floor were any indication. On top of that, he had greater reach even without his weapon, and he had the potential to get more rods from the ground behind him, if he got the opportunity to grab one of them.

Worse, he was deliberately trying to push Peter towards one of the walls of the cage, likely to try and corner him there. Knowing that did not make it any easier to avoid, unfortunately, and every move of the staff was powerful enough that he had no choice but ducking away from it.

Yet... There was a way for him to win.

The older man was strong, as strong as a metahuman in fact, but not enough to rival him. His speed was inferior as well, although that mattered little with the staff in the equation. Still, he could use it to his advantage. There was also the fact that, so far, he had only been dodging. A direct blow would hurt him. With this kind of super strength, it might even crack one of his bones if it smacked him hard enough but he didn't have to block it directly to take Bane by surprise.

He kept on rolling and jumping away from the assaults, pretending he was not aware that they were now getting dangerously close to the cage's wall, waiting for the right moment to act. Bane was moving like a well oiled machine, fluid, graceful and incredibly powerful. No two attacks were alike and he was able to both aim at different parts of his body and keep himself protected with a constant barrage of blows. Peter gritted his teeth, waiting for his opportunity. It came in a thrust aimed directly at his chest, the kind that would sheer through his ribs and lungs with the power behind it. The kind that could easily kill him.

Instead of rolling, he stepped aside slightly and, in a burst of speed past anything he'd shown that night, he reached out and grabbed the weapon as it barely missed him. His hands closed around it and he tensed his muscles, tugging as hard as he could. The rod immediately stopped, still for only an instant before he managed to rip it away from Bane's hand. Immediately, he pushed it back in, hitting the man square in the chest with the blunt end of the staff, sending him stumbling a few feet back.

He couldn't slow down now, he had to keep going at full speed before the rogue regained his bearing. Yet, he did not want to kill him.

Without a second thought, he dropped the weapon and surged forward. Bane had already begun to raise his arms to protect his chest and head but his lower body was still exposed. Peter bent down, hands on the ground, turned his body and aimed a vicious kick at one of the rogue's knees, one of the rare areas of his body not completely engulfed by spasming, twitching muscles. It connected with a loud crack. He followed it up with a second blow, this time aiming upwards with his other leg, still using his arms to balance himself on the ground.

Something caught his leg. A hand.

"Idiot." Bane repeated, tightening his grip.

Still, this was something Peter had expected and he immediately tightened his chest, wanting to take the man by surprise and-

He was flying through the air.

Bane had thrown him.

He crashed into the cage hard enough to push all of the air out of his lungs, leaving him coughing and gasping. He almost stuck to the metal rods to gain his bearings but remembered just in time he was not supposed to be using that side of his powers. Instead, he slid down to the ground, a dozen or so feet below, and landed in a crouch, feeling his back burn and ache, no doubt a mess of cuts and bruises. On the other side of the rink, Bane was bending down, picking up the abandoned staff. Despite the damage done to his knee, he did not appear to be in any pain and moved as fluidly as ever.

He doesn't feel pain. Peter realized. No matter how hard I hit him, it isn't going to bother him until I can knock him out.

That must be one of the drug's intended effects. Not only did it make the man stronger, it also rendered him almost impossible to intimidate or knock down. There would be no stopping this fight until one of them was incapacitated. It would make for a good show, no doubt, but it made his self imposed task of not killing anyone much harder. He had to find the balance in between beating the man to unconsciousness and outright slaughtering him.

Even then, he also had to be wary. By now, Bane was prowling towards him, staff in his left hand, red lenses glowing maliciously. The teen stood slowly, knowing he wouldn't be able to use the same strategy again. There would be no more thrusting, no more attacks that left his opponent open to this kind of retaliation. He had to find another way to dispose of the weapon.

They walked towards each other slowly, muscles tense.

They met in the center of the cage once more and moved at the same time, one with drug enhanced reflexes and the expertise of decades of high level combat, the other with a burst of extreme speed and strength, impossible to attain even with the most powerful of substances. Peter ignored the swipe that was coming for his ribs, pushing with all the power his legs could give him and aiming for the giant's midsection.

The blow struck the air, a breath too slow to reach him and he managed to hit the rogue's chest. Immediately, he planted his feet on the ground and pushed as hard as he could. This time he did manage to push the man off balance and forced him to the ground, pining him down with a hand on his throat, using his superior strength to keep him still. He bore down with his other fist, striking at Bane's jaw as hard as he could without fearing accidentally killing him. One blow. Two. Three.

The staff clanked as it hit the ground but, even as he felt a surge of relief wash over him, his neck began to tingle. Cursing, he looked around, trying to find the source of the danger. Not seeing anything, he tried to jump back, only for his body to hit a colossal arm, bent to wrap around him. Before he knew it, he was the one trapped on the giant's chest and Bane did not waste one second, squeezing as hard as he could. Peter felt his bones ache, his muscles protest, and he tensed, pushing out, struggling to free himself.

He was the stronger of the two and, as such, he managed to break out of the deadly embrace, chest hurting and back on fire. He took a few steps back, frowning. This was a ridiculous mistake for him to make, he'd have to ask Jason to teach him more about fighting on the ground.

Despite the punches he had taken to his face, Bane straightened up fluidly, picking his weapon back up and rolling his head, cracking his neck lazily. He did not appear in pain yet the mask outlined several unnatural twists in his jaw. It was broken in several places and the white parts of the fabric where quickly turning scarlet as blood dripped down to his chest. Between that and the cracked ribs he must have gotten from that earlier punch, it was a miracle the rogue was still able to move. How potent was that drug? Was it always this efficient or was the new version that much more powerful?

"Tough one, aren't you?" The criminal slurred. "Tough but untrained."

"Am I really doing that poorly?" Peter shrugged, falling into what he hoped was an acceptable stance. Bane shook his head in reply, crimson seeping down his neck and chest, dripping to the ground as he placed the metal rod before him.

The teen couldn't help but feel a little bit frustrated at the situation. He was the stronger of the two, despite his lack of experience compared to the rogue. This should be an easy win for him but he had gotten tricked a few times now. Worse, he was letting his fear of causing an accidental death influence the way he was fighting. He was still pulling his punches somewhat. Jason was right, he was limiting himself more than he should.

"You are doing quite well." The villain replied, his voice muffled and distorted by the wounds he had suffered. "But not well enough."

"You just won't stay down, will you?"

There was no need for the rogue to answer. They both knew the question was purely rhetorical.

Instead, the blur of motion and metal resumed its lethal dance, staff flying through the air in swift, precise arcs, barely missing him as he dodged.

He did not roll or jump, simply side stepping, turning or bending out of the way. There was no point pretending he was letting himself be lured towards the edge of the cage, no point holding back on his speed. His Spider sense warned him ahead of any feints or tricks and, as long as he gave himself enough space to react, he was fast enough to avoid being struck. The blows could not reach him and he knew he could keep on going like this for quite some time. There had been occasions where he had to keep on running, swinging and fighting for hours on end and, although it could occasionally make him slightly out of breath, he had yet to reach the limits of his stamina. Keeping cool was the most important thing in those situations, panicking would make him think he was tiring, would slow him down and potentially doom him.

He inched his head to the side, letting the end of a swipe miss him by an hair's width, turned his hips to avoid the following slice and side stepped a downward cut that would have taken him in the chin had he not moved. He couldn't read anything in the older man's movement but his speed was far greater, and it would have allowed him to react just in time even without his Spider sense. Still, he couldn't allow himself to fall into a predictable rhythm. Jason had taken great pains to explain how dangerous that mistake could be only a few hours prior. He wondered if his friend was watching him right now, and if he was, what he was thinking about. He hoped he wasn't making a fool out of himself. He knew he could win this fight, he just had to take Bane down for good.

He kicked upwards as he dodged a tight swipe, hitting the metal with the sole of his shoe, pushing it violently to the side. For a fraction of a second, his opponent was wide open to his blows and he took advantage of it, stepping forward and smashing a fist into his ribcage. Layers of muscles softened his blow but it was powerful enough to lift the giant off his feet. He leaped back before he could be grabbed, choosing to resume his careful dodging and ducking, attempting to stay as close to the center of the rink as he possibly could.

Death by a thousand cuts, that might be what he had to resort to. He could get into close range for short bursts of time, pushing his speed to the limit to step inwards and leave before Bane had a chance to stop him. It wasn't a very glorious way of fighting but then this wasn't a very glorious arena or a very glorious city for that matter. If it worked, he had to try it.

He turned a sidestep into a forward lunge, twisting and turning and burrowing his elbow deep into the other man's plexus. He felt his arm being swallowed by a twisting mass of muscles and skin and he tore away, barely avoiding a brutal smash from the rod. The metal bar hit with such strength that the ground under them exploded, shards of stones flying up around them, some scraping at his exposed ankles. Dust stained his shoes, his clothes. There was anger behind that attack. Apparently, he wasn't the only one who was beginning to get frustrated.

"Losing patience, big guy?" He teased, making sure his voice was as mocking as he could make it.

Bane's mask twitched as his face contorted in anger. Peter smelled fury, hatred and a burning desire to hurt. He understood it. He was a no-name metahuman with what appeared to be very basic abilities yet here he was holding his own against a famous rogue. Not only that, he had managed to hit him several times and was now openly taunting him, humiliating him in front of his peers. This could work in his favor, though, especially as the drug worked its way through the man's brain. Enraging him would lead him to make mistakes. It might also cause him to become a more serious enemy of his but, in that moment, he did not think about that aspect of his strategy. He simply had to see the fight through without ending a life and without showcasing his most memorable power.

For a moment, the staff came much faster, much stronger and much more violently. He was forced to take a few steps back as he dodged the onslaught. Still, he could see his attitude was having the desired effect. One of the many blows had been a thrust, which Bane had been avoiding after that first time. He played up the part of the irreverent kid by plastering a bright smile on his face and wagging his eyebrows. It worked and his opponent roared with anger, striking at him with a brutal push of his staff, aimed straight at his head.

Now who's the fool?  Peter thought, raising both of his hands and catching the weapon before it hit him. The shock of it stopping so suddenly made Bane's arms shake with effort. The giant strained, pushing, putting his weight on the staff to try and make him drop it but the boy did not step back. Just as he had done before, he ripped it free and swirled it in his own hands. He was not planning on using it though, he was done playing that game. He had to create a battlefield he could win on easily and having the rod there would be a disadvantage.

He threw the metal bar away. It hit the walls of the cage and dropped down, rolling on the ground behind him. Bane growled, sounding more a beast than a man, and resumed his assault, this time using his fists and legs to try and bring him down. Without the length of metal, however, Peter easily stopped the blows, blocking them with his hands and forearms, sometimes taking them straight on, not flinching when a massive fist bore down on his shoulders or smashed against his chest.

As another punch came for his nose, he jumped up. For most of the fight, he had used his agility and speed to dodge everything that came at him yet he had avoided showcasing any of his more spectacular moves. This was another thing in his favor and he planned on using it to his advantage. He rested his feet on Bane's extended arm, who still going for a strike, too slow to disengage, too human to register what was happening. Without a swirling staff between the two of them, there was nothing stopping Peter from going all out.

He pushed down on the arm, jumping forward straight for his opponent's head. His forehead hit the mask with a loud crunch, breaking the nose hiding behind it. As he did so, he reached down and tightened his hands on the rogue's upper arms, digging into the massive muscles so hard his fingers broke the skin and warm blood seeped onto his palms. Grabbing on with all that he had, he brought both of his feet up and hit the man straight in the chin. He did not use all of his power, of course, but he did put much more strength behind the blow than he would for a regular criminal. Fluidly, he hopped over the rogue's head and landed in a crouch behind him, slamming his feet into the giant's ankles and breaking both of them in one go.

Bane howled, falling to his knees and twisting back to reach for him, massive hands twisted into claws. It was an easy attack to dodge. Peter simply stepped back and kicked at the extended limb. Another crack. Another sinister crunch.

This was more than an humiliation, he realized, feeling cold.

This was a massacre.

Without a weapon to make the fight more even, there was simply no way for Bane to beat him. He might be more experienced but he was weaker, slower.

He was simply more human, even with the drugs.

"Forfeit." Peter said, pretending to be calm and collected despite his heart racing so fast it hurt.

Having the fight end that way would be too easy, however, and the rogue simply snarled at him, blood and drool foaming and dripping through the mask, launching at him, crawling and trying to grab his legs, drag him to the ground with him. The teen stomped down on the extended hand, crushing the remaining fingers.  He had to hit the man again and again, breaking more of his bones, pretending he didn't hear the chanting of the crowd, didn't feel the excitement, the frenzy that surrounded him. This had not been the expected outcome of the encounter and it was an absolutely brutal ending to an already violent fight. He wanted to scream. Instead, he struck once more.

It took several minutes for Bane's body to be shattered enough that he couldn't fight back, reduced to twitching and cursing pitifully, unable to lift anything but his head.

Peter's arms were splattered with blood up to his elbow, it came out of the man in slow trickles, from blood vessels that had burst under the strain of the enormous muscles. The adult's skin was painted blue and black with bruises, his limbs twisted and resting unnaturally on the stained ground.

Bane was a monster, he had read of his crimes, knew he had murdered countless innocents, destroyed lives...

But he still felt unsettled. It was so much easier to get rid of his enemies by wrapping them in webs, it kept his hands clean.

His hands...

They shone red and dripped with a blood that wasn't his. He wanted to scrub them clean but, instead he had to wait until the announcer screamed out his victory, roaring his nickname over the screeches of the frantic crowd. He felt stares from all sides, could hear whispers and shouts, incredulity and excitement everywhere around him. He had not been expected to survive, even less win, yet there he was, having ended the match by utterly crushing, humiliating his opponent. He had a feeling this was, somehow, a bad thing.

Worse, he had most definitely made an enemy today. He didn't know how well the rogue would be able to recover from their confrontation, he had broken at least a dozen of the man's bones while he beat him to the ground. If he did, however, get back to the streets, Peter knew Bane wouldn't let this kind of humiliation slip. He'd have to regain his standing somehow, and that likely meant he would try to get his revenge. He wasn't particularly afraid of the criminal, he knew he could beat him after all, but he was no longer alone. Jason was there too and he didn't want his new friend to become involved in such a chaotic situation.

He sighed, wiping his bloody hands on his shirt, turned around and-

His neck began to tingle.

He tensed, looking over the roaring crowd, up at the balcony, where all eyes seemed to be stuck on him. He recognized many faces, some of which he had never seen at the Pits before. He couldn't tear his gaze away from the silhouettes of the infamous crime lords. He was right. His Spider sense confirmed it. Beating Bane had been a very bad thing, not only because he had antagonized a dangerous criminal but because he was now being reevaluated as a threat. Did Ivy intend for him to die on the rink? Did she expect him to win? Did she even know who he would face that night? He could see her watching him silently, arms crossed, in front of the line of underworld personalities.

He was playing with fire, interacting with her. As soon as he got out, he had to make it clear there wouldn't be any more fighting from him. Surely, she had gotten enough money by now. On top of that, he was almost certain she must have other ways of making money, perhaps she sponsored other young metas, it would explain why nobody had been surprised to see her introducing him.

Either way, his Spider sense made it clear. Those people were dangerous, enough that he was risking his life simply by standing there, staring up at them.

He began to make his way out of the cage, slowly at first, then faster. He was almost out of the rink and headed towards the stairs when something shifted.

The room exploded in a dark, thick cloud of smoke.

His eyes began to sting and water, he started coughing.

Through it all, his neck tingled, screaming at him to bolt.

Perhaps the crime bosses had not been the main threat after all.

Around him, people started screaming.
Notes:

    He'll be fine.

    At first I didn't want to do Bane because Peter is way more powerful than him...
    But then this is MCU Spidey with little formal fighting training and Mr. Steroids put a little extra in his venom today.
    Still, even with just a little more training on fighting without his tools and without his usual aerial style, Peter would have been able to fold him easily. It would only really work rn, before he gets trained up by J-boy. Needless to say, Bane without venom would get destroyed in an instant, so for story purposes, he's in the struggling phase of his relationship with it.
    Anyways I rewrote this like three times. Some of the other villains I wrote in the scene before I settled on Bane will appear either during the ending arc or in the sequel.

    I'm more busy irl rn but this remains my priority fic so don't worry im not planning on putting it on hiatus or anything.

Chapter Text

Peter cursed. He was just getting done with his fight for the night and this was happening? Was this some kind of trick by one of the rogues or could it...

No matter. His Spider sense was clear. He had to get himself out of danger first and foremost.

The smoke spread, too thick for even his eyes to see through. Coughing, he took the few steps he needed to get out of the cage and peered up. The cloud reached over his head but it wasn't yet high enough to completely block the glare of the artificial lights on the ceiling above. Not hesitating, he jumped up, landing smoothly on the steel bars that formed the top of the fighting rink. With several inches separating them from each other, it would have been easy for a regular human to slip and get their foot caught in between but, to him, keeping his balance was child's play.

As he had hoped, the artificial fog hadn't reached up to that point yet and most of the arena was still free from it. Unfortunately, this reprieve was only temporary are several other explosions went off around the large room and the smoke began to spread again. It closed in around the rink, washing over him in seconds. Before it reached him, he managed to spot a few shapes dropping down from above, some landing among the packed crowd, some jumping down next to the cage he was crouching on. He recognized a few of the outfits from the chase he had been involved in a few nights earlier. Not criminals then.

I thought this event was supposed to be safe from law enforcement, what are the Bats doing there? 

There was no time to think too much about it. The crowd panicked, clambering over each other to try and get to the exits, by now already completely invisible, swallowed by the dense clouds. He could hear them cursing, yelling. Some of them had drawn weapons and the flash of gunfire broke through the darkness. He hoped nobody would get hurt. He knew what could happen when a crowd rushed to a single door and, although he suspected there were more than one way to get out of the arena, it did not make it any less dangerous. If a crush happened, he would have to intervene and do his best to get it to clear out. He did not, however, have time to decide on it, as he felt the weight of another person settle on the cage in front of him.

Without his eyes, he could only trust his ears, nose and his built in sense of tremors. Thankfully, he was wearing short sleeves, which made it easier for his body to feel the world around him. Whoever had decided to drop down next to him was still a good twenty feet away, on the opposite side of the rink. They were slightly taller and heavier than him, but not enough to be Jason or the Bat, even Nightwing wouldn't fit the bill. He could hear them breathe through some kind of mask, either to keep the smoke out of their lungs or because there was some sort of neutralizing agent in it. Noted. He would be breathing as little as he could afford to, then. Even he was not immune to lung damage.

"I would advise you not to resist." A male voice. Young. Around his age? He thought so, at least. It was a bit difficult to tell, with a barrier between the other vigilante's mouth and the smoke filled air.

"That's not very good advice." Peter replied, making his voice louder, although he wasn't quite yelling yet. The crowd was so loud, he doubted someone without the gift of super hearing would be able to discern his words. "Are you the guy who tasered me?"

Footsteps.

Whoever it was, he had no issue walking on the bars, easily keeping his balance. Peter sincerely hoped he wouldn't have to resort to violence. Not only was he emotionally exhausted, he had also been the one telling Jason he didn't want any trouble from the Bats. Beating one of them up seemed like a sure way to make the situation even worse.

"I am." The voice admitted. Somewhat surprisingly, the young vigilante added: "Sorry about that."

Well, at least he seemed sincere. 

"Are you going to do it again?"

Under him, he heard people running into the cage, several of them crouching around Bane. He could make out zipping sounds, although it was hard to focus in between all the yelling and the fact he was being approached by one of the Bats. Most of his attention remained on the figure that was slowly walking in his direction. By now, he had closed his eyes, letting his other senses guide him. He imagined the shape of a young man, about a dozen and a half feet away from his position.

"Do you know who you're working with? Do you have any idea what kind of trouble he put you in by making you fight here?" The voice asked, covering up the sleek tone of metal sliding out of a sheath. A blade? No... The shape wasn't right.

Why did he have to fight two guys with staffs in one night? That seemed a bit unfair. Hopefully this one wasn't a metahuman or on any drugs.

"I can't help but notice," Peter began, hyper aware of the people gathering under him, of the fact he could hear Bane's crumpled form being shifted around. "That you did not say 'no' to my question."

"You know what they say about liars." The staff swirled, cutting through the air, disturbing the smoke. "Now be nice and give up. Red Hood is my only target, I don't have anything against you, despite what you've been tricked into doing."

Red Hood... A familiar name. Where had he heard it before? The other boy was obviously not referencing the fairy tales.

"No can do, friend."

The teen facing him sighed, sounding genuinely disappointed in his reaction.

He did not need his Spider sense to dodge the oncoming attack. It had been a simple, slow stroke, meant to threaten him more than truly hit him. He rolled away, grabbing the bars under him with his hands and springing up towards the center of the cage. He landed smoothly, listening as the vigilante turned around then began walking again, taking his time to get to him. Was he trying to delay? Why was he moving so slowly? He took a few more steps back, listening closely. He thought he could feel Bane being rolled over, which couldn't have been pleasant for the man, with all of his broken bones.

"You are fighting to protect someone who does not deserve it. He risked your life by putting you there. I don't know what game he's playing, but he doesn't have me fooled. No vigilante would come here."

"You are assuming way too much." Jason had not put him there, Ivy had. Whatever bias the Bats had against his friend, it was severely clouding their judgement. Did they not see him come in with her? Did they just assume they were all working together? He could see it happening but it was so far from the truth he had trouble believing anyone could think that.

The next attack came much faster, aiming straight for his head then swerving around to poke towards his ribs. He dodged both of the blows with ease, not wanting to retaliate quite yet. He could end the fight easily but his Spider sense had not stopped tingling since that first smoke bomb went off. More worryingly, it seemed to get more intense the closer the teen vigilante got to him. What it meant, he had no idea, but he wanted to be as careful as he could. Thankfully, even if his mind was exhausted, his body was still feeling fresh and he had no issues staying a few steps away at all times. The boy, Robin, Red Robin or whoever he was, was not quite as skilled as Bane had been and he lacked the super strength that would have made his strikes dangerous. Still, Peter's neck was tingling for a reason, he wasn't going to ignore it just because he thought himself stronger.

"I have to ask again..." The blows continued, switching rhythm, three of them coming in quick succession, a powerful stroke, another five fast ones. "... Do you know who you're working with?" A swipe for his feet, coming back up in an arc aiming at his head. "Hood might have Nightwing convinced but I doubt he changed his ways so suddenly. This just proves I was right."

Another swipe at his legs. Peter tossed himself into a backflip, too fast for his opponent to take advantage of it. He landed at the very edge of the cage, still engulfed in dark smoke.

"The man you work with is a murderer." A thrust to his head, he had to bend back to let it fly over him, then flip to the side to avoid a downward knock. "A drug dealer." A kick came for his midsection, paired with another brutal swipe of the staff. He ducked both. "A crime lord."

A thump. Someone else landing on the roof of the rink, behind the attacking vigilante. Peter didn't need his eyes to be open to know who it was, he recognized the weight distribution, the grace with which the figure moved. He hadn't expected to feel this relieved when Jason finally showed himself, but almost immediately, he relaxed, letting out a long sigh. Finally, he didn't have to deal with a crisis alone. It was a wonderful change of pace. Still, he had a lot of questions to ask his friend, once this was all over.

"Such high praise coming from you." The newcomer snarked, voice sounding equally muffled. He must also be wearing headgear of some kind. He thought he could feel a metallic shape, a helmet, around the teen's head. "You forgot to mention I only kill people who deserve it."

So this was Red Hood.

In an instant, the vigilante was away from Peter and running towards Jason. There had been no hesitation, it was an immediate reaction. Was this what he had been attempting all along? Luring his partner out to get to him, knowing he wouldn't be able to take a metahuman by himself? The noise inside of the rink had not stopped, moving towards the stairs now, which were still in absolute chaos. Blessedly, a crush had not yet happened as many seemed to disoriented to be able to reach the doors. That was a miracle in itself.

"As if that's any excuse for murder!"

A smash. The two of them were clashing, staff against fists. Jason dealt with the weapon much more expertly than Peter, blocking and diverting it, weaving around it with ease. Both of the fighters smelled of barely restrained rage. There was definitely history behind them, something very dark and serious.

"Kid!" Despite having to dodge and parry, the rogue turned aspiring vigilante had no trouble talking as he fought. "Go get what I gave you!"

It took a few seconds for the meta to understand what his partner meant but, once he did, he felt torn. Would it not be better if he stayed to help? Sure, he did not want to retaliate and risk worsening their relationship with the Bats, but he could easily take a few of them on his own and allow them to escape. But if his friend thought it necessary for him to go grab his gas mask, he must suspect the group of heroes would use toxins again him. They might not know about his metabolism, which would make the poison less potent, but it remained a major risk.

He wouldn't be able to help if he was drugged. Preventing it from happening was his priority.

"I'll be back!" He called out, crouching and jumping, far above the two struggling teenagers, up towards the ceiling.

For a brief moment, he was high enough that he brushed the top of the room, giving him a sobering view of the rolling wave of dark clouds filling it. Smoke bombs were still going off, keeping the darkness inside, even as the doors leading to the sewers let some of it escape. He heard the young man who had attacked him curse, heard some of the more famous rogues giving orders to their subordinate, heard doors slam open and feet thumping, running, racing to get to the exits. There hadn't been any trampling yet.

"Nightwing!" The boy fighting Jason yelled. "The meta is escaping!"

"I'll be there. And we will have a talk about this, Red Robin." A familiar voice replied immediately, from the bottom of the stairs that led into the cage. "You three, get Bane out. Exit 19-C. Avoid confrontation if you can. I'll be right back."

A zipping sound, then a whoosh. Someone was coming after him.

Peter plunged back into the smoke, landing in front of the locker room, having to shove a few people away as he ran up to it. He smashed his shoulder into the door, sending it flying open. Black fog poured into the small space and he slammed it close as fast as he could, stopping it from fully filling up the tiny room. A layer of darkness still covered the floor, swallowing his legs up to his knees, swirling lazily around his feet and ankles. He paused. There, in front of him, in between the entrance and the locker he was aiming for, stood a man.

Despite the ceiling lights shining overhead, the vigilante seemed to be made from darkness itself, his body armor and cape melting into the thick layer of black smoke as if he was part of it. The Bat had the same presence as he remembered, intimidating, domineering. He only had to turn his head towards him for Peter to start shivering and begin to wonder if he really needed his gas mask after all. Why was Batman even in this locker room? Didn't he have better things to do in the arena, like arresting some of the rogues that were still there?

A soft click tore him away from his wondering, followed by a slow hiss, coming directly from the vigilante's chest.

Alright.

He did need his gas mask after all.

That meant he had to go through this guy, somehow.

And he had to do it without taking any air in, just in case. He could hold his breath for more than thirty minutes, perhaps up to an hour if he pushed it, so it wouldn't be an issue. In fact, he thought he could even go past that if he really had to. That wouldn't be the hard part. The hard part would be to keep his mouth shut until he got his hands on his jacket. Now that was a challenge.

"You again." The Bat spoke with the same deep voice, void of any emotions. "For a newcomer, you seem to have quickly found yourself in dangerous company."

Nightwing would be there anytime now, he had to be fast. Gritting his teeth behind his closed lips, Peter started walking towards the row of lockers, ready for anything. His Spider sense was screaming at him to run, give it up and get to safety. He tried to quell it. He had to do this. He had to do this and avoid murdering any of his fellow vigilantes.

"You know, I have nothing against you." Batman went on, now fully turning to face him. He was holding one of Bane's tubes, which he stashed away into his cape, leaving both of his hands free. "You have good intentions, no doubt. Your actions against Firefly say as much."

Peter froze.

It took everything he had not to open his mouth to ask how. He managed to keep it shut, although he couldn't help his eyes from widening, couldn't help but stagger slightly.

"We found your DNA and part of your suit at the scene." The vigilante explained calmly, the picture of cool, composed confidence. "It matched what we collected from the remains of my car."

He wanted to step out, step back. They did not know his name but they knew his face, they knew his job, they knew his identity. They had linked his civilian self to his vigilante one, they had seen through the mask. How long had it taken them, weeks? Days? Hours?

"You are putting your trust in the wrong man." The Bat crossed his arms. "Red Hood is a dangerous and unstable individual. I know this better than anyone. Fighting by his side will only enable him and drag you down to his level. Did you know he approached you with the intent of recruiting you?"

Their talk in the garage after the car chase, had told Peter as much. It still hurt to be reminded of it but he had decided it wouldn't be enough to make him change his mind. If even the leader of Gotham's only vigilante team saw no hopes for Jason, who else would try to help him? He had to have someone on his side now that he wanted to try another way, especially if he was the one wanting to change. Doing it on his own would risk pushing the older teen towards more violence and despair. Being abandoned would not do him any good. Worse, it could lead him back to the criminal world.

Still silent, the boy shook his head and began to walk again. Why was Nightwing not there? He could still hear screaming and gunshots on the outside. What was happening?  Had anyone died? Was anyone injured? He had to get the mask and run back out as quickly as he could.

"Your loyalty is misplaced." The hero shook his head slowly, sounding slightly disappointed, although it was hard to tell with his utter lack of apparent emotions. Gas was still hissing out of his armor. Peter's bare arms and legs began to itch. He needed to get to that locker. "I would be happy to take you in, help you nurture what you already have. There is no need to talk of your past, even this, the arena, can be forgiven. You are new to Gotham, you feel lost. It's perfectly understandable."

Why is it understandable for me but not for Jason? He thought, keeping his opinion to himself, now only a few steps away from the center of the room.

"There are three other teenagers your age training under me, you are welcome to join them at anytime. I will provide you with shelter and food, you won't have to do this kind of-"

Peter was done listening.

He started running, as fast as he could, interrupting the vigilante in the middle of his speech. He used all of his speed in this one burst, pushing as hard as he could, like he rarely did. He fully expected to be able to get past the man, who, if sources were to be believed, did not have any meta ability powerful enough to be of note, but-

Something caught his ankle, a hand landed on his back, destabilizing him. For a flash, a fraction of a second, he was reminded of Jason, shoving him to the ground and explaining how his lack of experience could be deadly. Then, the memory was gone and he was being held over the floor, arms twisted behind his back, something pressing at the back of his neck. A needle. They were going to sedate him, force him back to their headquarters whether he wanted it or not. How they could think that would win them any points, he had no idea.

No!

He kicked back with one of his legs, balanced on one feet and bending forward to allow himself to strike up at the hero's chest. The blow connected with a loud thud and the Bat went flying, crashing against one of the walls. The syringe fell to the ground, swallowed by the dark smoke that was still flooding in from the small crack at the bottom of the door. He did not hesitate, running towards the locker he had put his clothes in. He opened the door so hard and so fast it tore out of its hinges and crashed to the ground, which he ignored, shoving a hand in his jacket's pocket and taking the mask out.

Palms made slick with sweat and beads of toxin, he used the still clean jacket to wipe his face then pushed the metal object on his head. It shut around his jaw with a click, tightening over his nose and-

BEHIND

His Spider sense was rarely this strong. He threw himself to the ground, straight into the fog, and something crashed above him, falling back down to-

CRAWL AWAY

He pushed against the lockers with his hands, sending himself back a few feet, just enough to see a net fall in front of him. Its wires were almost as thick as his wrist and it was clearly made of metal chain.

"What am I, a fish?" He asked the Bat, jumping back up and turning to face him. "That was a bit rude, don't you think?"

His own voice was muffled now, he tasted artificial air as it was filtered then pushed into his mouth. It felt weird but he tried to ignore it. He could now breathe without risking being drugged, but he was far from safe. Not only did the older man know about his identity, he obviously was not taking any risk with fighting him one on one. How many other tricks did he have up his sleeves? What was next, another round of tasering? Or was Nightwing finally going to come bursting in, evening the odds in the Bats' favor?

"I see Hood gave you some of his stolen equipment." Batman did not sound very pleased at the idea.

"You know..." Peter began, looking around the room for any exit that did not involve having to barrel through the vigilante again. Evidently, that kick had not been enough to injure him, since he was now back to where he had been, blocking the path to the exit, arms crossed and appearing perfectly in control. "... For a hero, you don't really act like one."

"I have never called myself a hero, I simply do what needs to be done." The man's armor had stopped hissing gas. Either he was running out or he saw it as a waste, which meant the mask was indeed working as Jason has promised it would.

"Great sales pitch for your team."

"I somehow doubt joining an established group of vigilante, which would fund, train and house you is any worse than working alongside a known criminal."

Perhaps he could use the element of surprise by sticking up to a wall or the ceiling? No... Batman knew he was Spider-Man, he might have deduced his powers already, or perhaps his DNA had given it away, either way he couldn't take the risk. He had to find something else, and he had to do it fast. The room was filling with smoke, it was up to his waist now, and he could still hear fighting in the main arena. Delaying would only mean Jason had to fight on his own longer. He had to help him!

"That's what I mean, you know." His eyes darted left and right, trying to find something, anything. "For a guy who says he wants to help, you don't do much to really help people."

A pause. The Bat actually seemed surprised. He must not hear that one often. He had to keep talking, get him distracted, then...

The locker door. It could work. It had to work. He kept talking.

"You beat them up then toss them in Arkham or in jail, where they have no chance of rehabilitation."

"There are programs in both of those places to help inmates." The man sounded more annoyed now, his feelings bleeding through his cold persona. Getting talked down to was most definitely not in his habits. "You judge my actions based on flawed information. Do not trust what Hood says, he would rather have me kill those I send there."

It was working, he had to keep on pushing, get him to talk more, give himself time to reach down.

"Seems like those programs haven't been working very well, have they? Recidivism looks to be a bit of an epidemic in the city you protect." The air quotes were heavily implied and Peter hoped he wasn't pushing too hard. Getting the man to hate him by insulting his life's work was not the best outcome this could have, but he needed a way out that didn't put him in range of another syringe or risked him striking the man too hard. So, he kept on going. "Having programs in place is good but they don't appear to be helping people like Red Hood. Sending them back there isn't going to do anything except turn them away from whatever redemption they could get."

The Bat uncrossed his arms, the only outward sign of discomfort. Even his scent was masked by his armor. What kind of man was he, under the cowl?

"Hood thinks you will never give him a shot at redemption," The teen said, moving his foot under the smoke until he found the broken form of the locker door. "If all you can think of is to send him to an asylum that is so famous for malpractice even an outsider like me knows about it, then he's right." He slid his shoe under the panel, ready to kick it up, waiting for the right time. "He wants to be a vigilante, he wants to help. Some people need more attention and support than a standardized system can give them. If you can't see that, then you're not just a poor hero, you're an idiot."

Batman's jaw twitched. He opened his mouth. "Hood is-"

Peter kicked up, in one motion, he grabbed the locker door and tossed it directly at the hero, as hard as he could. The man caught it in the air before it hit him but that one second where he was not staring him down gave the boy time to jump, leaping towards the armored vigilante. He kicked outward, bending the flimsy metal shield with the strength of the blow and sending the Bat sliding back towards the door. He followed and kicked again, this time hard enough to push the adult against the wood panel and break it open, causing a wave of black smoke to rush around the both of them.

"Give up!" He yelled, leaping up, far away from any syringe, needle or net.

Immediately, he heard a zipping, felt something follow him from the ground, faster than he was. He would not have time to land on the cage before he was caught again. Thankfully, he had pushed far enough that he was on a direct collision course with the ceiling. He flipped in the air and extended his arms, sticking to the stone and getting ready to intercept his pursuer. He couldn't hear anything from the inside of the cage, Bane was gone and so were the people who had surrounded him. On top of it however, he felt three people. One, the smaller in stature, was laying down and smelled of blood and gunpowder. The other two were much larger and taller and were engaging in a brutal fight.

Jason had somehow gotten his hand on the teen vigilante's staff and was using it to keep Nightwing, who was also wielding a weapon of some kind, at bay. Both of them reeked of blood and sweat and he heard several blows connecting on both sides. They seemed evenly matched for now, but it wouldn't take much to push the balance one way or the other.

Batman reached him, cape whooshing behind him. Peter welcomed him with a kick down, aiming directly at his head. The vigilante somehow managed to change direction mid-air, the movement accompanied by another zipping sound. 

"Great way to recruit people, pal." He told the approaching shadow. "I definitely want to work for you now."

"You have been fooled. He only wants to use you." Was the reply he got, spoken in a monotone, neutral voice. "Why else would he lead you here? Make you fight someone like Bane? This is low, even for him. Involving Nightwing is even lower, I will not let him corrupt anyone else."

"You know he didn't make me do any of this, right?"

His words didn't seem to matter.

Batman, who had been hovering nearby, hanging from a metallic rope jammed into the ceiling, sprung into action once more.

The air crackled with electricity and Peter barely had time to vault away, forced to fall back down. Several wires crashed were he had been crouching, each of them lit up with threatening arcs of white and blue energy. The time for pleasant conversation was over then. He must have overdone his taunting. Still, he knew he could make it out. He had to. He regained his bearings, aiming at the cage, wishing he had his webs with him so he could be faster, have more mobility. Why did the ceiling have to be so high up?

His neck tingled.

The Bat intercepted him as he fell, crashing into him with all the strength of an extremely muscular, heavily armored adult man. Peter cursed, pushing him away with a two-legged kick before the man had the chance to put any drug in his body. Being sedated and arrested was not how he wanted to end the night thank you very much. Down, on the roof of the cage, he could hear Jason and Nightwing arguing. Further, around them, thugs and crime lords were flooding out of the arena or beginning their own brawls, although some of them were still too disorientated to do anything but stumble around blindly.

Back on the cage, the two young men were still fighting, throwing insults at each other, remaining evenly matched.

"Is this your idea of light back up, you absolute jackass?" Jason screamed, hitting his opponent, his blow striking flesh with a thwack, which was immediately followed by a grunt as he himself was pushed back.

Batman zipped down again, throwing several things at Peter. Although they were blunt and he managed to keep them from touching his head, it hurt enough to make him curse. Still, he managed to punch the man back, sending him flying away, to be swallowed by the smoke again. He was almost to the ground now, but he had deviated from his goal and would be landing in the seats. Why couldn't he just leave them alone? Fighting in the Pits was illegal but there were worse criminals there. Whatever grudge he had against his friend, this was becoming extremely dangerous. They had to get out.

Under him, he could hear more yelling. He tried to aim as close to the rink as he could, knowing he would not make it.

"You think I could come here on my own? You know B, Hood. That's ridiculous." Two weapons clashed, metal grinding against metal then pushing away from each other with a clang. "And there is no more back up now that you shot him. This is a step too far."

"The little fucker had it coming, attacking the guy I told you to protect!"

Wait... what?

Peter landed on the back of a plastic seat, itself nailed down to a long row of stone and cement. It broke under the impact, forcing him to jump again, this time closer to the cage.

"You can't expect him to trust you after what you did to him." Another thud but, this time, Jason was the one to stumble away. "And what are you even doing here with that kid? Getting him to fight Bane? After that whole thing two days ago, really? Do you know how long it took me to convince them you weren't involved?"

"This is why I told you to come on your own! You fucking moron!"

 "So we can get killed fighting our way out of there? I can't get any gear from the cave without B noticing and you know it!"

More struggling, one of them broke away for a few seconds, only to be dragged back in for a punch to the gut.

"I managed to get my gear just fine, you shit liar. You just can't do anything without asking your master, can you?"

"What if I wanted to show them you changed, you idiot? Why did you put that kid in there? How the fuck am I supposed to salvage this?"

The meta's feet hit the stairs and he sprinted down, ignoring the zipping noises behind him, the Bat getting closer and closer. He had to break up the fight, get Jason to leave the arena with him. They were in over their heads and he had absolutely no desire to make it worse. He could ask questions later, and he would. He had to find out what this meant, but now was not the time. He had chosen his side. If nobody would help his friend (he hoped he was truly his friend), he at least had to try and give it his all.

Metal met metal again, faster and faster, a whirlwind of blows, two men fighting, dancing, their styles familiar yet completely unique in their own way. One took a hit to the jaw, the other one to the shoulder. Still, they yelled at each other, barely audible in the midst of the other screams, the other fights that had broken out in between the different groups of thugs. Some of them were blaming each other for the way the night had ended. Penguin, apparently, was a known backstabber and many were holding his crew responsible for the debacle.

"J- Hood, you have to see this is insane. I thought we were busting the place, not helping use some kid as bait!"

"I'm never trusting you again with shit like this!" Staff met body armor and Nightwing barely avoided falling through the metal rods, recovering with a flip that left him open to a vicious kick. Peter reached the bottom floor just in time to hear him tumble and almost fall down. "You'll never be anything but a dog! Go back to your owner, shithead!"

Finally, he made his way up to the top of the cage, and just in time too, as he could feel Batman landing right behind him. He only had seconds, perhaps less. He didn't have time to speak or warn his friend, he just had to act.

He rushed forward and, feeling like a terrible person, kicked Nightwing just hard enough that the man was sent flying off the cage and crashed to the ground. Ignoring the bleeding form of the teenager he had fought earlier, he ran to Jason and grabbed his arm, tugging and forcing him to follow as he jumped back down. He knew they would be chased. He didn't care. They had to get out of there before one of them died. He hoped that gunshot hadn't been fatal. He didn't think his friend would kill a vigilante like this but he was beginning to think he did not know him very well after all.

Thankfully, his partner followed him without protest, climbing the stairs with him and heading for one of the exits.

"He shot him. Twice." Nightwing was telling the leader of his team, sounding both astonished and utterly disappointed. "Shit. I thought he was done with this."

"I heard over the com. I told you not to trust him. Get Red Robin back to the cave, I'm giving chase."

"B, you-"

"No arguing. Do it."

The voices faded the further away they got from the center of the arena, disappearing into the rumble of the disturbed crowd. Still, they ran.

The two of them burst out of the smoke filled arena into one of the many sewer tunnels. The air felt thin, despite the whisps of fogs that still slithered out of the door. Jason, who was indeed wearing a helmet of some kind, and a bright red one at that, tapped Peter on the shoulder, motioning at him to follow. The both of them were going as fast as the taller boy could, passing several fleeing criminals as they sprinted. They turned again and again, followed by the steady sound of zipping and of footsteps thundering after them. It was getting closer but not quite close enough to catch up.

Waiting for them, in the corner of a sewer tunnel, hidden behind a pile of stones and dirty earth, was a familiar bike.

Of course.

It should have been surprising but, really, it was almost expected for the thing to follow them wherever they went. Nobody was as meticulous about escape plans as Peter's new partner in crime. They hopped on as the Bat rounded the last angle before he reached them. He was aiming whatever allowed him to zip around so fast directly towards them, his cape fluttering behind him from the sheer speed he was going at. His scent was still hidden but his entire being emanated pure fury. Rage of a kind the meta teen had rarely seen before.

Jason stepped on the gas, the bike roared to life, starting at a breakneck pace, shooting into the tunnel and barely avoiding splattering them on the opposite wall.

Batman growled, turning in the air and following. He was going terribly fast himself, enough that a mistake would likely kill him. Yet he did not hesitate, flying after them and somehow managing to keep up with the vehicle. The environment made it hard to push the engine to its limit and Peter was forced to bat away a few more projectiles, lest they hit Jason in the back. What did the guy think would happen if one of them did hit? A fall could easily kill the one of them who was human.

"Never again." Jason muttered, evidently to himself, expertly maneuvering and weaving through obstacles and tight corners. "Never asking him again. What an asshole. Never again. How could he think I would... Never again."

Well, Peter thought, this was a complete disaster.

If they made it out of there with their freedom, they needed to have a long, very long talk.
Notes:

    I guess that's one of the main differences with the side fic that would make it somewhat non canon to the main story (which is why its a crack fic and not a family drama).
    I'm going for a mix of pre new 52 and new 52 for Tim and Jason's relationship, with an emphasis on the extreme tension of pre new 52 for now but without insane Jason and wanting to move into more of a new 52/rebirth vigilante red hood.

    I scrunched up the timeline a lot for drama. I'm pretty sure ive said it before but i want to make it clear lol.

    Also yes they do believe Jason is up to no good despite him calling Nightwing for backup. They think he's corrupting a potential vigilante ally. Seeing Peter fight did not help at all. They also do see him as potentially a huge threat after he wrecked their cars and destroyed Bane in front of them.

Chapter Text

He felt them nearing one of the many exits of the sewer system almost a full minute before they got there. It wasn't his nose or even his ears that told him this, but that odd sixth sense he had of his surrounding. He felt the walls around them as surely as he could see them, was aware of the twists and turns of the corridors before they fully reached them. He simply knew they were approaching the outside world, the snow and the wind. He would have felt relieved, had the memory of their previous chase with the Bats not been so fresh. It would be hard to lose the vigilante following them, no matter where they were.

Behind them, Batman had not relented, despite falling back significantly. How he was still holding on, Peter had no idea. Every thunk of the hook hitting stone, every zip of the line being pulled forward must have been hell on the man's arm. They had been in the tunnels for a good ten minutes, after all. Plenty of time for a human to get worn out, following a vehicle going at near full speed. Thankfully, they somehow never got stuck in a dead end or in front of ones of the many ladders and piles of rubbles that peppered the underground maze. Like many other places in the city, Jason appeared completely familiar with their surroundings. Without him, he would have been trapped a long time ago. Peter only knew of one way in and out of the area, and it definitely was not the one they were taking now.

He has to be a meta, he thought, looking back to stare at the vigilante giving chase. This kind of velocity and strain on the arms would not only be exhausting for a regular human, it would also be dangerous. Joints would pop, muscles would strain past their limits. He was aware he only managed most of his swinging because of his superior stamina and resistance. He couldn't picture any person doing the same without those, especially someone as large and heavy as the Bat. Perhaps his armor was built in a way that supported his arm when he swung? With the kind of tech he had seen Gotham's vigilantes use, it wouldn't surprise him one bit.

Seeing him moving that way reminded him of his webs. He still had a few shots left in his gear but he hadn't put it on that night, not wanting to leave them unattended while he fought at the Pits. He needed to ask Jason about finding the chemicals he needed to refill them. He was starting to get uncomfortable, needing to rely on the older boy to find supplies. This entire incident seemed directly connected to his friend's history with Gotham's crime scene and the heroes that fought against it. He had some ideas, some thoughts racing in his mind, as to what that connection could be. He wanted to find time to sit down and put them together. For the first time since he met him, he had a vague idea of what pieces he needed to complete the puzzle that was his partner's identity.

Now, however, was not the time.

The Bat kept on following, using the walls and ground as anchors to shoot himself forward, somehow managing never to hit anything hard enough to be injured even in the tightest of turns. He was still furious. He smelled of extreme anger and was it... sadness? But why? He hadn't been this angry when he fought Peter alone in the locker room, he had been calm, even when faced with blatant taunting. Jason had shot one of his allies, though, and that appeared to have been the last straw. Was this also the cause or the sadness?

I don't approve of this either. He gritted his teeth, glancing at his friend, who was using all of his focus to keep the bike going and stay out of the grimy water, away from the tumbling stones and the creeping vines that could slow it down or, worse, damage it. His bright red helmet must have some sort of night vision built in, since he had not bothered to turn on the vehicle's lights. Peter, of course, did not need his eyes to be able to perceive everything around them. 

Jason had told him he wouldn't shoot anyone who wasn't a crime boss, yet he had no hesitation going after one of the Bats. He could only trust him so far, then. He had expected it, yet some part of him had wanted to remain optimistic. How was he going to help rehabilitate him, if he wasn't being honest about things like this? It had been easier back in New York, all they had needed was a lab and three minds coming together to find the antidote to the various issues of his counterparts' enemies. If only it could be so easy now.

They took a turn down a sharp corner and raced up a slope, leaving their pursuer behind for a brief moment. The rhythmic thudding of the hook hitting the broken paving, however, did not stop. They were still being followed.

Not for the first time since they first took off on the bike, he considered jumping back and ending the chase himself. The tiny possibility Batman might not, in fact, be a meta was the only thing holding him back. Whatever the power, people with mutations tended to be more resistant to damage than other humans. A super powered individual would generally be able to shrug off a blow to the face when going at this speed. A regular human, however, could potentially die from it. Even a body armor of this caliber would not be able to soften the blow enough to guarantee the man would survive. He missed his webs.

He stayed put, not wanting to do any more damage. He was still reeling from the events of the arena, his brutal fight with Bane and his confrontation with the opposing team of vigilantes. They knew who he was behind the mask. That was still hard to swallow. Would they expose him, if he tried acting as Spiderman? He didn't know them well enough to be sure. He didn't remember reading anything of the sort when he studied their history, but he was afraid of the possibility.

And he had no idea who they were. He didn't have anything to hide anymore, nobody to protect, but it still felt awful knowing somebody had connected his real identity and the spider mask.

Finally, they burst into open air, jumping out of the canal and landing into shallow water on a detritus strew beach. In the distance, he could see a few bonfires, people warming up around them, crowding in groups of three or four. Their tents were half buried in frost and snow, although some of them had managed to dig themselves a safe area. Behind the camp, up above the mouth of the sewer, he heard the sound of police sirens.

A lot of them.

Oh they really did bust the place.

He felt cold, and not only from the weather. Had he stayed there and taken his usual exit, he might very well have ended up running out only to be surrounded by a wall of police officers. He counted more than a dozen different cars, and that was only from what he could hear. How many people would end up being arrested that night? Bane had already been taken in but most of the rogues had exited the Pits directly from their VIP lodge. Did that lead to the docks as well?

He wished he had a phone on him, if only to check what was being said on the news about the situation. He could still feel the Bat going after them, slowing down now that they were out into the open. Jason was swerving off the beach and up a stairway that led into the city proper. The buildings there would be easier to navigate with a grappling hook but, in between the twisting alleyways, the bridges and the many gangs roaming the street, they would also make it easier to escape from the chase.

Or at least Peter hoped so. He trusted his friend to know what he was doing, he would simply keep on making sure nothing hit them while they were driving away.

This is the second time I got into a chase in the past two days. It was becoming a bit of an habit. With his webs, he had usually been the one doing most of the following. It was rare to find an enemy who was able to keep up with him without having some kind of flying ability. Most of the street level criminals he went after in his former life had preferred to stick to the ground, and for good reasons. It only took a few seconds for them to be wrapped up in a cocoon or stuck up in the air, unable to free themselves until the webbing dissolved or someone came to help them.

As he had suspected, Batman used the change of terrain to his advantage. Somehow, his grappling hook left the buildings he was propelling himself to and off of intact. That must had taken a lot of effort, with that kind of grip and power he had expected it to completely wreck the stone it stuck itself to like it had in the sewers but, somehow, it didn't. He wanted to take the thing apart, figure out how it worked. If his suspicions were correct, Jason might have one of those. Whether or not he would let him tinker with it was another question entirely. So far, Red Hood had been quite touchy about letting him handle his possessions.

Red Hood...

He remembered the name now. He had seen it along the list of some of the Gotham rogues Barbara had given it, weeks ago, ages ago, at the library. The details were fuzzy, most of his research had been done before he had access to enough food to keep his mind sharp, and he had still been reeling from May's death. Still, he was almost certain a lot of the man's actions had to do with drug dealing, which was in line with the way Jason kept his hideouts safe. He organized pre-planned deals to keep it on the police's radar as a low priority target, making them think they had all of the information on the place and it was not of any importance. A background as a minor drug lord would make the task significantly easier.

But the Bats had mentioned murders too. He had expected it but now that he knew Jason's former identity, he couldn't stop wondering how many people the older boy had killed. Was it more than Tony? Did that even matter? 

Behind, almost a whole street back, the Bat was still following. Peter saw him reach down towards his belt and pull something out. Small, shiny pieces of metal. They reflected the moonlight just enough that he was able to make out what they were. Spikes. Much larger and thicker than the ones usually deployed by law enforcement, most likely custom made to stop a vehicle similar to Jason's bike. Not only that, he thought he could see some sparks of electricity coming out of them.

Not good.

"I'm going off!" He told his friend, who turned back for a split second, face unreadable underneath his helmet but body tensing up abruptly. He couldn't have heard his words over the wind and the sound of the engine, but Peter's body language was clear, and he had already started crouching, ready to jump.

He didn't give the former rogue time to react and gathered his legs under him then pushed upwards, not hard enough to disturb the bike's path but with just the right amount of strength for him to reach and stick to one of the nearby buildings with the sole of his shoes. He had always been able to bypass clothing, as long as it wasn't unreasonably thick. For once, he was glad he wasn't wearing his leather work boots. He might be cold, but he didn't know if he would have been able to stick through those.

There was no point hiding his abilities now, the Bat had seen him use them back in the Pits. Any bystander would either be inside or would have trouble recognizing him with the gas mask hiding half of his face. He didn't have to hold back in that regards anymore. He began running behind the bike, sometimes using his palms, pressed down on the cold walls and gargoyles, to make himself go faster.

The vigilante threw the spikes, much more efficiently than a regular human should be able to. Either he was using a meta ability or he had some more gear he could deploy to make sure whatever he launched had more power behind it. Peter vaulted off the building, twisting in the air and reaching out. Instead of grabbing the projectiles, he kicked, punched and shoved them away. A few slipped past him, the shot too wide for him to reach them in time. Still, he managed to deflect most of them. They hit the nearby roofs and scattered off of them, still sparkling with electricity.

Although he had only brushed them for a few seconds, the shock was strong and his fingers were tingling with the power behind it. They had been meant to disable Jason's bike, not bring him down. He almost missed his landing on the opposite building, shivering from the after effects. The sound of Batman getting closer, however, quickly reminded him of the situation. He began to run again, hopping down onto the back of the motorcycle, shaking his head and trying to get his mind to clear up. That had not been pleasant at all.

Despite the spikes that had managed to sneak past him, Jason managed to keep on going, hitting a few of them straight on. That amount was not enough to stop the machine, thankfully, and they kept shooting through the streets. By now they were far enough away from the docks that the streets had started filling up again and it took a lot of abrupt swerving and sometimes even drifting to keep them from hitting anyone. Most of the GCPD was focused on the seaside, and now was a good time for everyone else to come out and play.

Peter was beginning to recognize where they were heading. By now, North Gotham had become familiar and he was used to the dark streets that went through it. He was almost certain they were deep into the Bowery and making a beeline towards Park Row. Whatever idea his friend had to escape pursuit, it apparently involved Crime Alley.

As expected, they swerved right into the alleyway as soon as they reached it, slowing down back to a normal pace. With the roar of the engine dimming, Peter could hear the sounds of the city. Laughing, screaming, cursing, crying, and-

Flesh hitting flesh.

Bones breaking.

Yelling, terror, despair.

Wait, was that...?

Oh no.

"There must be one here at least..." Jason muttered under his breath, glancing around and slowing further. He couldn't hear as well as his passenger, but he was searching for something.

Peter, however, had a hard time sitting still. The noises he had just spotted were sounding a lot like something he should, in all right, go out and investigate. They were not quite coming from Crime Alley but from a bit further down the road, on a side path to the left. He looked back, spotted the Bat, who was only a few yards away now, zipping towards them with his grappling gun, his cape flying behind him, making him appear even more shrouded in shadows than he already was.

He cursed, tapped Jason on the shoulder.

"I need to go off again, someone needs help!" He shouted.

This time, however, his friend grabbed his arm and shook his head, tugging him back down. Peter understood, they were being followed, they had to escape, but if they split up, he had a shot of helping before the situation became impossible to solve. Whatever he was hearing was beginning to get worse, the crying ramping up to hysteria, more violence. He tried to stand again, only for Jason to force him back down once more. No choice, he would have to overpower him, get past the teen and-

"Where is it?" The older boy asked, screaming over the wind and the bike's engine. Batman had almost caught up to them now, it was only a matter of seconds before they had to face him again.

Relief washed over Peter. They were going to help. With his face masked, he could act out freely for once. It didn't matter the risk, he wasn't the kind of person to let aa situation like this go on if he was right next to it, if he had the power to stop it.

He gave Jason directions, pointing as he did.

Behind them, the Bat was getting frightfully close and was reaching into his belt again, taking another set of oversized spikes.

Not good at all. But this had to be done.

They drove full speed again, heading towards the source of the disturbance. The yells, fighting and crying became louder as they approached, so much so that even a non metahuman should be able to make them out. Jason swerved close to the mouth of the side path, stopped the bike.

Then he turned back on his seat and stared straight at the Bat, then down at the alleyway. With one of his hands, he reached out to grab's Peter wrist, still staring at the figures moving down the small street. A woman and a boy, on their knees, were trying to shield their faces against a flurry of blows.

"Trust me." He said.

Then he drove off again. Peter's heart sank and he forced his arm away from the man he thought he had known, turned and got ready to jump off once again. There was no way he could let that pass, he wouldn't-

The Bat was standing in front of the small alley.

For a brief moment, they exchanged a look. Peter crouching on the back of the bike, still speeding away, about to jump and go help. Batman with his fists clenched, watching them leave.

Then, the older vigilante turned away and ran towards the commotion, sliding the spikes back to wherever he had stashed them.

And so, they kept on going.

They did not have to stop for anything more before they reached their building's street. Perhaps it was luck, perhaps his partner had avoided the hot spots on purpose, to keep Peter from trying to leave again. The way they had taken there had been extremely convoluted, sometimes even going in circles back and forth to make sure they weren't being followed anymore. It was only once he stepped down, taking his mask off the way Jason had taught him to earlier that afternoon, that Peter finally noticed the bike was looking different.

It was larger, bulkier, as if it had been armored. Although it had been hard to see when he was riding it, it was extremely obvious now. In fact, it almost looked like a completely different vehicle, with unfamiliar shapes jutting out and large plates of metal covering what had once been a smooth body.

Ah.

This was Red Hood's bike, not Jason's.

He could see the motorcycle he knew under the added bulk but, had he not known it, he wouldn't have been able to make the connection between the two. And he had thought the thing was big before... Now it almost looked like a tank itself, very much like the Bat's own car.

"Hey."

Jason's voice made him jump and look up. The young man was still sitting on the bike and Peter realized he smelled like...

Anger.

Not directed at him. Still, it was intense. He was surprised his friend was able to keep his voice calm, when he smelled so strongly of fury.

"I'm going to drive for a bit." Jason continued, still somehow keeping his feelings from affecting his tone. "I'm-... I need to think."

He didn't wait for a reply, taking off and leaving Peter behind, standing a few blocks away from their building, wearing shorts and a blood soaked t-shirt. The snow was still falling heavily, shining under the moonlight. It bathed the usually dirty street in an odd glow.

 

The walk up the stairs was even more awkward than usual. He had no idea how to explain the red stains that went up his arms, or the gas mask he was still carrying in his hands but, thankfully, nobody came out of their unit while he was making his way home. He had lost yet another jacket. Worse, he had lost his boots. And, with the lack of a pay-out for this fight, he was now running very low on money. He might have to choose between supplies for his web making and clothes, this time around. At least the delivery job had his rent and food expenses covered. What would Ivy think? Would she expect him to pay her back in a way, for the wasted effort? He doubted the arena would open again anytime soon.

He checked every nook and cranny of his appartement, looking for bugs or hidden cameras and, when he didn't find any, slipped into the shower for a blast of cold water. Blood and dirt trickled down the drain, his hair stuck to his forehead, dripping. He felt empty.

His last set of clean clothes felt odd pressed against the bruises he had gotten from his clash with Bane. Most of them were healed now, but the deeper one were taking longer, a situation not helped by him skipping dinner. He considered warming up some of his ramen but gave up on the idea. He hadn't had the time to use his small oven since he had gotten it. He had no food to put in, no pot and no metal sheet. Yet another thing he would have to buy at the nearby stores. Too bad he didn't have a budget for it anymore.

He sat down on his mattress.

His computer was still on, running the program he had started earlier in the day. It was busy translating the remnants of Tony's code and salvaging whatever was left from the Iron Spider. By now, almost 80% of what could be saved had been and, so far, he hadn't been able to put KAREN back together. There were simply too many corrupted and lost files, too many dead ends in the programming. He could work on it and turn it into something usable, but he had little time to do it.

After making sure stopping it in its track wouldn't damage anything, he turned his program off and stored the Iron Spider's chips away. No AI in his new suit for now, he'd have to make everything voice controlled, or perhaps...

No.

Don't think about it now.

There was something else he had to do, something more important.

Fearing what he might find, Peter turned on his search engine and typed, not sure he wanted to read what he knew would find.

Chapter Text

Thirty-one.

Red Hood had been involved in thirty-one deaths.

At least.

But he had known that, when he decided to help him. Hadn't he? 

Thirteen of them had escaped justice in court after being accused of various crimes, twelve were members of the criminal underground, the rest had been found deceased in various locations of the city, all of them in suspicious circumstances. Nearby cameras and witness reports had identified Red Hood as the one to intervene in every case. There must have been more unreported and undetected attack as well. All of that in less than a year of activity. And that wasn't all, all of this barely held a candle to the amount of drugs that had gone through his partner's network at its peak. He might have been a beginner, as he had put it, but he had been on track to become one of the leading figures in the underworld.

And you have a chance to help him redeem himself. If he did so much as a rogue, what could he do as a vigilante?

But he had already been a vigilante, hadn't he? Jason clearly knew the Bats, had contacted Nightwing, the first ever Robin, for back-up. It had not ended well but he still had known them enough to be able to request their assistance and have them, all of them, show up and assist him.

Peter tossed a handful of snow down the side of the Clocktower, watching in silence as it bounced off dented statues and gothic reliefs. He had given himself the responsibility to help Jason on the road to redemption but he was now completely out of his element. This wasn't a scientific puzzle or something he could solve with his powers. This went deeper, some kind of feud, maybe a betrayal. Whatever it was, it had been so bad the other teen had not hesitated to break his promises and had shot one of the Bats. How did you save someone in such a situation? Could you even save them? It was his duty to at least try, but where did he start? If promises weren't enough, if the tension between the two vigilante groups were so high they came to blows every time, how could he start diffusing it?

One month was what he had agreed to, but that seemed too short a period of time to get to the bottom of the issues there. He could back away and give up on his new friend if they didn't work out but that felt like a failure, even though that was what they had promised each other. But then how far would he go before he had to remove himself from the conflict? He had never intended to become involved into whatever this was. Jason and the Bats had way more history than he had expected them to. If they had once been allies, the incident that caused them to split must have been disastrous. Perhaps that was where he should start, understand the entire thing from the start, and then he could go from there.

A loud thunk, followed by a zipping sound made him jump so hard he almost fell right over the edge of the tower. His neck remained free of any tingling but still, he crouched down, suspicious. Was this a coincidence or had one of the Bats spotted him on his way up? What did they want with him, if it wasn't to try and apprehend him? His Spider sense didn't lie, there were no hostile intentions there but with what had happened the previous night, he couldn't bring himself to trust anyone. It seemed the longer he stayed in this city, the more reasons he had to be suspicious of everyone around him.

A figure rose up from the side of the roof. A black, lightly armored body suit with a blue bird emblazoned on its chest and a domino mask on his face.

Nightwing stood on the opposite of the Clocktower's rooftop, arms crossed in front of him but shoulders relaxed. He didn't smell of anything violent and his general demeanor was calm, but he gave off a distinct scent of tiredness. Peter had not been the only one to skip sleep that night. Jason himself hadn't been back to their apartments by the time he left the building. It was hard to find any peace after a night like this. He still remembered Bane, the locker room and the chase that had come after. Even thinking about it made his heart beat faster.

"Good afternoon." The older vigilante greeted, uncrossing his arms to wave at him. "Do you mind if I come talk for a bit?"

"Hi." He replied, almost choking on the word. "No." He shook his head. How had they found him? Did they put a tracker on him during the chase? The only thing he was still wearing were the shoes he had been given, all the rest had immediately gone into the trash. He didn't want to think about that disaster anymore, and it wasn't like blood soaked clothes were a rarity in Gotham's dumpsters. Sometimes he wondered just how difficult the city's garbage workers had it. It already wasn't an easy job in any kind of large town but it must be even worse here.

"Thank you. I thought it might be better to talk it out. Before it gets out of hand." Nightwing grimaced as he spoke, stepping next to him and sliding down to sit at his side. Peter lowered himself back down from his crouch, turning to look more closely at the other man. It was the first time he had been this close to him without having to fear for his life. From up close, the suit was even more impressive, full of intricacies he hadn't noticed before. He could see several notches along its sides, some of them bulging with hidden equipment. And the two short staffs the man had used to fight Jason were still on his back, perfectly clean and turned off for now. He took good care of his gear.

"I think it already did." He pointed out. "I'm sorry, by the way. About..." What was his name again? "... Red Robin."

"You had nothing to do with it." The adult replied, although his mouth turned downwards and his scent took a distinctively angry turn. "Red Hood and Red Robin have an extremely complicated relationship, this isn't the first time this has happened." He sighed deeply, looking up at the cloud covered sky, a layer so thick and dark the sun could barely pierce it. "If anything, I might have made it worse."

"It's still no excuse for shooting him."

"No, it's not. But you aren't the one who pulled the trigger." He sighed again, sounding exhausted. "Hood is a dangerous person to be around."

"He wasn't the one who signed me up for the Pits." Peter said immediately, frowning at the vigilante. "He has been nothing but nice to me."

"He might be nice to you," Nightwing retorted, "...but his actions put you up against Batman. When it comes to Hood, a lot of the family acts before thinking." He looked down, shoulders sagging. "I suppose that includes me too. But it doesn't mean I'm not in the right. Something happened to him, he's not- There's something wrong with the way he thinks." The sadness was there again, more powerful this time. It tasted a lot like regret, sticking to the back of Peter's tongue.

He considered his next words carefully. The vigilante was not going to act out against him, at least not immediately, and he understood what he was talking about. He had been involving himself with criminals and although at the time he had felt like he had no other choice, justifying it now, even to himself, seemed a poor excuse. He needed to become Spiderman again, get dragged out of the mess he had trapped himself into and he wanted to take Jason with him. He could feel a lot of potential in his friend, if only everyone else could see it too.

"I know about his anger issues." He said eventually. "It's..." Intense. Extreme. Irrational. "...It's obvious. But he wants to get out of the underworld. He talked to me about becoming a vigilante." He didn't add the again but he almost did, shutting his mouth just in time. He wasn't completely sure yet, and he didn't want to look like a fool if he was mistaken. Still, there was no other explanation.

"He talked to me about it too." Nigthwing admitted, surprising him. So they were close, after all. One of his theories was beginning to make more sense. If he was right, then it would explain a lot and somehow still manage to leave more questions unanswered.

In a flash, he was back on a rooftop, wearing his civilian clothes and a delivery bag on his back. He looked up at two men sitting above him, talking, both of them wearing vigilante costumes. One was the man he was currently sitting right next to, the other had been wearing a red mask, covering his entire face, and black combat clothes. It had happened the same night he had seen Harley last, and that had taken precedent in his memory but, now that he thought back on it, he could remember every single details.

Nightwing had been in contact with Jason earlier than he had thought. If they were so friendly they would share a pizza together, what happened between them that a misunderstanding like that would have them come to blows? Red Robin had been severely injured, but what had triggered it? Was the hatred between the two teens that powerful? 

"If you know he wants to be a vigilante, why did you fight him? Why aren't you speaking up in his favor to your allies?" He had a bad taste in his mouth and his head was beginning to hurt. The first Robin had called the Bats a family and, indeed, this had all the signs of a massive family feud. He cursed his terrible luck. Of all things he had not wanted to happen to him, being involved in drama between a former criminal turned aspiring vigilante and his family of intimidating heroes must be in the top ten.

Wait, Wasn't Jason's foster father a Wayne Tech engineer? But if he was right in his theory that would mean that Batman was directly connected to...

"Believe me," Nightwing said with a self depreciating smile, forcing him away from his train of thoughts. "I am. All he told me about yesterday was to come in case something went awry. Between that and the info he sent me about the venue, I thought it would be a good opportunity to get him and the crew to work together." The again hung heavily in the air after he finished his sentence. "It did turn out pretty well, we got a lot of high ranking criminals under bars, the court's going to be busy." He didn't sound that satisfied about it. Of course, if his main goal had been to help with the rift in his family, he had utterly failed.

"...But?"

"But it very much looked like the metahuman we connected to him before was involved in a dangerous, high stake illegal fighting rink. Right after we caught them following a dangerous test subject."

It was Peter's turned to grimace.

"The fighting rink was my decision, not his. He's been telling me to get out since he learned about it. And we had nothing to do with... that test subject." Last time he had said that, shouted that, Batman had not seemed to listen but perhaps it would be different now. For some reason, the man's former sidekick was a lot more open to the idea of allying with Jason than the rest of his... family.

"And it would have been nice if he tried to explain that to me when he asked for my help." Nightwing didn't seem to caught up on him admitting to his criminal activities and, blessedly, took his admission with a small nod, accepting it without protest. When it came to Gotham, beating on fellow metahumans for a crowd of mass murderers and drug dealers must be rather tame. "I wouldn't have gotten anyone else involved if I had known. Maybe Oracle but certainly not Red Robin. And now..."

He seemed to be blaming himself just as much as Jason for the turn the night had taken, which was rather ironic considering they were all there because of Peter in the first place. Well, maybe he could use this to try and ask him some questions. It felt a bit evil to take advantage of someone in a moment of weakness but when else was he going to get the opportunity to talk to one of the Bats like this?

"And you're coming to me with this because?" Pushing just a little bit but not too much seemed like the safest thing to do right now.

The adult shifted slightly, hesitating before he replied.

"Hood and me have had our moments in the past, some worse than others." He sounded almost nostalgic about it, which was very forgiving of a man whose ally had just been shot by the person he was reminiscing about. "But I've wanted him to turn away from crime since he came to Gotham. He doesn't listen to me, though." His eyes, hidden behind the domino mask, found Peter's and he held his gaze. "You might be the first person with good intentions to actually try and stick with him. If you do have good intentions."

If he didn't, the man's tone implied a lot of suffering. The boy shivered slightly. Technically, he knew he wasn't in any danger, but that voice had been so cold. Very unlike the Nightwing he had been talking to until now, who, despite seeming very tired, had been nothing but polite and agreeable. No matter how civilized Gothamites acted, there always was a core of steel inside of them, and it only took situations like this for it to come out in the open.

"We agreed to try vigilantism together." He admitted, omitting the fact he had already been involved in heroics for years and suspected Jason of once having done the same. "This was supposed to be my second to last Pit fight. And he agreed to cut down on... what he's doing." He still didn't know what exactly his neighbor was currently working on but now that he wouldn't be fighting for Ivy anymore, he expected him to fulfill his end of the bargain.

Nightwing nodded, still staring directly at him. He felt like he had to keep talking, those blank white eyes were cold. So cold.

"We were supposed to stay away from you guys, focus on small time crime. But after yesterday..."

"Doing that," the vigilante replied, gaze finally sliding off Peter's face and settling down on the buildings around them. "Might be beneficial. He needs to see himself as one of the good guys. It would also help me convince everyone to calm down for a bit." He crossed his arms, seemingly deep in thoughts. "I wish I could help more but, as I said, he doesn't listen to me. Right now I think he would probably attack me before we could talk it out."

He hummed, stroking his chin, and spoke again. "I will try to keep the family away from you. If you're serious about wanting to help him-"

"I am!"

"... Good. Well, since you are, one of the things you should focus on is his mental state. There's something wrong there, something unnatural. Maybe if you guys can figure it out, he'll be a bit less unstable." He did not look that threatening anymore, nodding as he spoke.

"Uh... Thanks for the advice."

Nightwing's face lit up suddenly, and he directed a bright grin at him. Out of all the smiles Peter had encountered in his life, this had to be one of the most winning. Not even Tony's newspaper ready face could rival it. He replied with a smile of his own, only to yelp when the older vigilante sprung to his feet and, with a quick wave to wish him goodbye, front flipped off the side of the Clocktower. Bending forward, he barely had the time to see him zip off into the city, using his grappling hook almost as expertly as Batman had during the chase. 

Well, at least they weren't swinging, that was his thing.

He sighed, leaning back and thinking on what Nightwing had just told him. Focus on Jason's mental state? He had noticed a great deal of extreme anger in his partner, maybe he should try to read up on how to help those. If those emotions were unnatural then what could have caused it? A mutant power maybe? The library probably didn't have any information about those but they could have something relating to dealing with uncontrolled emotions. Maybe if he went, he would even get to see Barbara. It had been a while, he could tell her things were going well for him, she had looked worried the last time they had talked, and a lot had happened since then.

She had, after all, been the first friendly face he had met in this universe.

His mind made up, he hoped off the side of the Clocktower and landed in a crouch, dusting off his pants and shirt before starting the long walk towards the Gotham city public library.

Chapter Text

Perhaps unsurprisingly considering the time of the year, the library was extremely busy when he reached it.

He saw groups of children off for their winter holidays, teenagers and college students studying for their exams or hanging out with their friends, and adults with their families or on their own. They clustered in small circles, some at tables, other in the coffee shop area, which was the only spot besides the Kids’ section to be filled with loud conversations and laughter. He was reminded of a time where he had sat in a very similar place, plotting with MJ and Ned over a slice of cake or a cup of coffee. He missed those simpler times.

Would Jason like to go there sometime? The older teen didn't look the type to enjoy sitting in a library, what with his love of bikes and firearms, but he did have a large collection of books in his container bedroom. Appearances were often deceiving, especially in Gotham, where looking tough and dangerous was often one of the most effective way to keep yourself out of trouble.

That, or becoming famous in the underworld for being a metahuman. Of course.

He would ask about it, once they had gone over what had happened at the Pits, maybe they could decompress a bit and hang out without having to think of vigilantism or their feud with the Bats. That would be a nice change of pace.

But that’s only if it works out between you two, isn’t it?

Even though he tried to tell himself he hadn't come to talk to her, he felt disappointed when he didn’t see Barbara at the oak counters. A quick swipe of the computer area did not get him any more results. Well, that was that. No friendly librarian today, he’d just have to come back another time to let her know he was doing alright.

The next thing to do was to find the books he wanted. Not wanting to bother any of the employees on such a busy day, he looked around for the psychology and human sciences session on his own. He didn't find it on the ground floor but ended up hesitating in front of the fantasy aisle. It was very well stocked and seemed to be a popular area of the library. Maybe he could spare just a few minutes, find something for him to read during his free time? 

No. The temptation was strong but he didn't have that much time before he had to head out to work. He could always come back later.

There were two upper floors above him, each connected through two massive open wood staircases. Climbing up, he quickly found the hard sciences section, right next to the human sciences area. Once more, he had to convince himself not to grab something completely unrelated. He could find information on this world's scientific discoveries online, he didn't have to get it there. Really, he had to focus. He forced himself to walk past the dozen or so aisle on physics, biology, chemistry and everything he would usually have jumped on, and only allowed himself to stop when he reached the first bookshelf of the Psychology section.

With the library being so big, he had expected a large choice of authors and texts on the subject, but he was still impressed to find almost a dozen rows of books focusing on mental health and self help. It was also quite a busy few aisles, with several patrons of all ages browsing alongside him. So not only was the place well stocked, it was used a lot.

From what he knew of Gotham, this made a lot of sense. New York had been rough on a lot of its more unfortunate citizens but it was nothing compared to this city. Between the regular villains attacks and the downright abandoned town districts, it was no wonder some people would try to find answers in books. Not everyone had the money, the time or the predisposition for therapy after all. He hadn’t, back in his home world. He had relied on his friends and on his family to-

Focus.

Anger management. He could find stuff about that here. 

He apologized to a tiny old woman as he side stepped her and her bag stuffed with thick, complicated psychology volumes, and started looking through the shelves. Depression was a common topic, but he did not think it was fully applicable to whatever Jason was dealing with. Addiction was a close second, with dozens, if not hundreds, of texts focusing on all kinds of different substances, life journeys and research. They had different targets, some were for active users, some for past users and some for loved ones who wanted to understand and help. Several of the drugs mentioned there were completely foreign to him. He would have to learn the terminology, in case he was involved in a bust in the future.

Focus.

He was about to grab a thin book about meditation, something he'd been taught about but had never really practiced seriously, when he realized he had just made a mistake.

He didn’t have a library card.

He was an absolute idiot and he didn't have a card.

What was he going to do then? Sure, he could go back home and research it online but he didn’t feel ready to head there yet and it would make his entire trip to the library a waste of time. He couldn’t take books out without one, could he? That would be theft and even if he brought them back later, the employees would be wondering where they had gone. He really didn't want to have to bother an overworked civilian, and he did not have the time to wait in line at the front desk, which, from where he was, looked extremely busy still. As it was, he probably had forty more minutes to finish up there, anything past that and he would end up late for his shift.

Did that count as a strike? Losing his job now, and the apartment that came with it, would be a disaster.

He sighed, hand dropping back to his side, resigned. He had to accept his mistake. This had been a waste of his afternoon.

Turning around, he took a few steps away from the bookshelves and almost crashed right into someone.

He stepped back just in type, apologizing profusely, mentally cursing himself for his lack of attention. Any other day, with more sleep and more food in him, he would have heard Barbara coming minutes before she actually got there but-

Ah!

Barbara was there.

She was there... and he had almost stepped right into her.

She smiled at him patiently, a pile of books on her knees and a notepad tucked in between her leg and the side of her wheelchair. She didn't look upset about what had almost happened, although she seemed slightly confused. He felt like a bumbling fool and, worse, he could feel himself blush from the sheer embarrassment. 

"Everything alright?" She asked him, barely above a whisper. They were in a library after all.

"Yes!" He replied, a bit too loud. Flinching, he lowered his voice. "I was looking for you."

She raised an eyebrow at that and it took him a few seconds to realize just how creepy he sounded. How could she know she had be the first person to be nice to him after he had been displaced to Gotham? She might not even remember who he was, with how many people she had to see everyday. Good job, Parker, making a great impression there.

"I’m Peter." He laughed awkwardly, still trying to keep his tone as quiet as possible. "We met a couple weeks back."

Not good enough. What kind of guy remembered someone after meeting them only twice, and both times at their place of work? And she probably had no idea what he was talking about. He had to find something to say to clear up any misunderstanding. Between the Bats mistaking him and Jason for active rogues and the Pits pushing him to fight for the enjoyment of criminals, he really didn't want to add 'stalker' to his tarnished reputation. Quick. "I-uh… I wanted to get some books but I forgot I don’t have a card. And you’re the only employee I know here."

Barbara's surprised look melted back into a gentle smile and he felt himself relax. Disaster avoided. He didn’t look like a creep after all.

"I remember you. And I can help you with that. Do you want to do it now or do you need help picking your books?"

He ended up smiling back at her and accepting her offer for help only to realize that what he was looking for might seem sort of weird. Obviously, a lot of people needed help and that was nothing to be ashamed of, but he didn’t want to throw her off. He still told her and was relieved to see her expression did not cloud one bit. 

"Sure. We have a few really good ones on that topic actually!"

Her positive demeanor put him further at ease and he followed her down the bookshelves, accepting the various books she was passing him.

"You have a limit of twenty books on your account," she told him seriously, still managing to keep her voice low enough not to bother anyone. "But only ten of them can be graphic novels or comics. You can also take up to twelve items from the multimedia section." She whirled around, pointing a finger at him, the pile of books still on her lap somehow remaining perfectly balanced. "Now, you can keep them for three weeks. You can request an additional two but please don’t go past that."

"I won’t." He promised.

"I’ll hold you to it." She nodded, adding yet another book to the half a dozen or so already in his arms. "This one is a bit different, but I find it really interesting, so you should read it."

She added three more items to his stack before clapping her hands and beaming at him. "I think this should be all! Of course we have a lot more but those should help you decide how you want to go about it."

"Thanks." Peter told her, fully meaning it. "You guys have so many options it was kind of overwhelming at first, so I really appreciate it."

"Oh no worries. Now let's deal with your card problem."

He stole a glance at a nearby wall-mounted clock. Twenty-five minutes left, that should be just enough time to get it done. 

She led him away from the bookshelves and he followed, smiling despite himself. She was older than Jason and him but he wouldn’t mind hanging out with her if he had the chance. She knew tons about books and she was nice, what else would you want in a friend? Not that this would ever happen, of course. She was a librarian and had no idea what she represented to him. To the tired, hungry and lost Peter of a few weeks earlier, she had been proof that not everyone in the city saw him as a dangerous mutant or as an outsider. To her, he was simply a regular patron.

"I'm glad to see you back," Barbara told him, deceptively fast on her wheelchair. She must have really strong arms, to be able to go this quickly. "Are you living here, now?"

"Uh... yeah." Peter picked his words carefully, not wanting to reveal anything too personal or too suspicious. "I got a job and an apartment."

"No school, then?" She didn't sound like she was judging him for it and he had seen plenty of teens his age out in Gotham late at night, so perhaps not finishing high school was not so unusual. He had gone through hell to get his degree, though, in between the Thanos incident, Mysterio and the routine of going out as a vigilante several hours every day.

"I graduated high school last summer."

He knew he looked young but still, he wasn't going to pretend not to have finished something he had really struggled to achieve. As long as he didn't have to give too many details, who would even check? New York was a very big city with very many schools and universities, and it wasn't like a librarian he had just met a few times would care enough about him to look into it. As he had expected her to, Barbara took his answer with a nod and congratulated him. It was nice, being able to act like a normal teenager. He had been that way for years, even after he became Spiderman, and wanting to get that more simple half of his life back was what had pushed him to go to Stran-... to Stephen. In Gotham, he had lost the opportunity to live a regular teenage life, not because his secret identity had been exposed, but simply because he had to survive the city and his poor decision making had led way more people than expected to knowing about some of his meta powers.

A few more aisles down, they turned left and headed for one of the distant stone walls. There, an oddly modern touch in the midst of the classical architecture that surrounded it, was an elevator. Sleek in design, it opened with a ding and they got in. Accessibility was always nice to see in an older building, although he should have expected it, considering Barbara had been on the upper floor in the first place.

As the doors started to close, Peter looked back at the bookshelves, wondering if he should have taken the time to find some hard science books for his entertainment after all. A lot of the content on the Internet was paywalled. Had he had more time, he could have easily broken through, but here he could get everything for free and without any effort. Maybe Barbara could have given him good advice about that too. He almost asked for them to turn back but closed his mouth abruptly when his eyes caught those of a little boy, standing on the other side of the aisle closest to the elevator.

With smooth bronze skin and perfectly styled hair, he had rarely seen a child with such an intense aura around him. In fact, it took all he had not to step back when they locked eyes and all of that intensity was directed straight at him. It was only made worse by the change in the kid’s expression, going from smiling and talking with whoever he was walking with to going silent and extremely serious. Things went from worse to terrible when the strange preteen decided to ditch his guardian and began to run towards them, dropping his books on the ground without a single care.

He thought he heard Barbara groan behind him but was too distracted by the sight of that tiny boy sprinting and slamming his hand in between the still closing elevator doors to know if he had imagined the sound or not. The whole thing was so odd he didn’t even react when the child forced his way in and smashed the button to close the doors, shutting out whoever his adult companion had been, all the while ignoring the two bewildered looks he was getting. He turned to them, his perfect haircut slightly disturbed by his quick run but his breathing even. Maybe he did track in his free time.

Wait, wasn’t he too young to do track? At what age did that start? 

"Hi Damian." Barbara sighed, and from her tone he could tell he had not dreamed her groan earlier. Dropping books on the floor was quite a rude thing to do inside of a library and she was probably one of the people in charge of keeping the place stocked properly. She knew him, though. Perhaps that was why the boy had decided to rush into the elevator. 

"Gordon." The tiny child nodded, more composed than an experienced business man about to conclude a deal. With the same serious attitude, he turned towards Peter and nodded again, one of his eyebrows twitching slightly, a micro expression too subtle to be spotted by the average human. "And I do not believe we have met before."

"Uh-…" He looked down at the red-haired librarian, who had a very strange expression on her face. No help would come from her. "…Peter."

"Peter." The kid, Damian, repeated. "It's a pleasure to meet you."

He reached out his hand, obviously expecting the meta to shake it. His grip was deceptively strong despite his size. It felt a bit like they were coming to some sort of a business agreement, or they were world leaders meeting for the first time. Except they were just two kids introducing themselves inside of a public library elevator. Damian's voice had a slight accent behind it, barely perceptible. Was he bilingual, maybe? At that age that was impressive.

Still, Peter felt incredibly awkward talking to and shaking the hand of a child he had never met before, especially without their guardian around. At least Barbara seemed to know him, perhaps he could rely on her to save him from being accused of kidnapping.

"He’s the little brother of a guy I used to date." His companion in confusion said, breaking her silence and shaking her head. "Don’t mind him, he’s a bit unique."

Damian’s head whirled around and his previously pleasant demeanor turned frosty. The boy narrowed his eyes at Barbara and, had Peter not known better, he would have thought the kid was about to jump up and strangle her.

"Yes." The child said, with all the friendliness and enthusiasm of a brick wall. "Unique in ways you couldn’t comprehend, in fact." He made a point of turning away from her after he spoke, and even managed to somewhat convincingly look like he was ignoring her. This was quite an achievement in such a cramped space.

Peter shifted his weight uncomfortably as those cold blue eyes locked onto his. Or were they green? It was hard to tell, under the weak artificial lighting. Either way, the kid did not look amused. Perhaps he had a bone to pick with him? Maybe he delivered him a cold pizza a couple days ago and that had ruined his night. 
No, that wouldn’t make sense. Whoever the boy was, he did not look like he would be living in North Gotham, where Marco’s operated. He couldn’t quite tell what materials his clothes were made off but they looked as if they had been cut for him. Either his family was very good at picking outfits off the shelf or they had gotten them at a tailor. The only person Peter had ever known to use one of those for every day clothes had been Tony. Well, the Wakanda royals and their entourage had done the same but they were nobility! He didn't think there were nobles in Gotham but, if there were, this boy looked as if he would be one of them.

So he made a rich child mad somehow, and it didn’t have anything to do with his civilian job. The only other option would be the Pits. Maybe one of his parents was a criminal and they had lost a bet when he won his fights? It seemed far fetched but his luck had been pretty terrible since he landed in Gotham, so this wasn’t completely out of the question. He really didn't need some crime boss baby to get a grudge and come after him but hey, that wouldn't be the worst think to happen since he got that spider bite.

"Have we met before?" His mouth decided to ask, way ahead of his brain, which was still processing his confusion.

Damian’s eyes flashed with something indecipherable but Barbara cut both of them off before the boy could get a reply in.

"Really, don’t mind him." She glared at the preteen. The change of attitude was surprising, even if there was barely any heat behind her eyes. "He always says weird things that shouldn’t be heard in polite company. Right, Damian?"

The preteen in question gritted his teeth, shifting his cold gaze to the redhead. Once again, he looked about to jump her and aim for the throat. The elevator’s doors chose that moment to open, the mechanic ding cutting through the tension that had settled in between the three of them.

Barbara moved first, and both of the boys stepped back to let her through, Damian aiming a dark look at her back.

"Let’s go," she told Peter. "I’ll help you make your card."

He followed her with a nod, hoping the uncomfortable interaction would end there. Unfortunately, his luck had apparently decided today was the day he would be taken for a creep, and, against all logic and reason, the strange child decided to stick with them. He desperately looked around, trying to spot anyone who could be Damian's guardian. If he reached out to them first, they shouldn't get the wrong idea, right? Plus, Barbara and the boy knew each other. Even if they didn't seem very friendly, that had to mean something.

"Should we get him to the front desk?" He leaned forward, whispering and hoping the kid wouldn't hear him. "Find who was with him?"

"Oh, he'll find us himself." Barbara shook her head, looking exasperated. "Just ignore him for now. Don't take anything he says to heart."

"I can hear you, peasant." Damian growled, stepping up to stand in front of them, fists on his hips. "Don't act as if I'm not-"

He spluttered with outrage when the woman simply wheeled around him, not slowing down her pace and completely ignoring whatever he was about to say. Peter cleared his throat uncomfortably, trying to give the kid a smile he hoped looked friendly and not completely awkward. The boy bristled further at this, glaring so hard the meta ended up turning around and following Barbara, hoping he hadn't worsened whatever enmity was already there.

They ended up stopping at a table a few paces away from the front desk and the seemingly infinite line of Gothamites either entering or leaving the library. He could smell coffee and pastries from the louder eating area and his stomach rumbled. It was loud enough that he hoped nobody heard it, although, for a second, he thought he saw Barbara's eyes flicker towards him. Was she curious, worried or did he simply imagine it? It was hard for him to focus on reading her micro expressions, not only because she had very little of them, but also because he was starting to feel really tired. He could go longer than the regular human without sleep but he still needed it, and he also very much had to eat to keep his strength up.

He would grab something from Marco's tonight. That should be enough to make him feel better.

"Alright," Barbara told him, pulling a laptop out from under the table and typing a few words on it. "Let's get started."

He sat across from her, wondering if he should tell her he was running on a tight schedule. Surely she could get everything done in twenty minutes. He would feel terrible, having to leave all the books she helped him pick behind.

Damian stood next to the table, arms crossed and staring at Peter. The boy definitely had some kind of gripe with him, he didn't look away once and it almost looked like he wasn't blinking either. Creepy.

"Do I have to pay anything?" The teenager asked, doing his best to ignore the angry child. If he pretended he wasn't there, he would have to leave eventually.

Unfortunately, the preteen decided to reply to his question, even though it had not been directed at him.

"It is free for any Gotham citizen. Wayne Inc funds the program." He clicked his tongue, a weird tick coming from someone like him. Was he annoyed at the billion dollar corporation or did he approve? It was difficult to tell, especially when so many sounds and scents were already threatening to overwhelm Peter's brain. He needed to get some sleep. Damian kept on talking, seemingly unaware that he was intruding into a conversation that did not concern him. "You should be grateful for their generosity, not everyone is so kindhearted as to use money to better the lives of others."

Barbara rolled her eyes and Peter bit his bottom lip. This was awkward.

"That's... that's cool."

The kid nodded shortly. Apparently, his lackluster reply was enough to satisfy him.

"Library card." Barbara said suddenly, clicking and typing something on her computer. "It’s free, as Damian here so kindly explained. Just need some info and I'll get you one."

"Sure, sure." He nodded vigorously. "I kinda need to get going as soon as possi-"

"Is it because you're an employee?" Damian cut in, looking up at him with a slight frown. In his mouth, the word “employee" sounded foreign. Well, he looked rich enough that he probably wouldn’t have to work for anyone in his lifetime.

Peter's mouth hung open for a moment, he shook his head and closed it. "Uh... yeah. I am. Need to get to work soon."

"If you are late, we can drive you there." The boy offered, sounding completely emotionless. Under all the other smells around them, the meta thought he could detect some kind of excitement hidden away inside of the child. Oh that was most definitely a trap. He wasn't going to fall into it. He had seen enough traps for a lifetime.

"Thank you," He smiled awkwardly, "I'll be okay."

"But Father doesn't mind." Damian protested, looking very much like he believed that argument was convincing enough to change his mind. "You don't, right Father?"

"Of course not!" Someone beamed from behind Peter.

The teenager almost jumped out of his chair in shock. He had been hearing footsteps but there were so many people in the library, and the ground floor was so busy that he had not paid any attention to the noise. He kept forgetting where he was. Gotham was more dangerous than New York and letting people get close to him like this was a good way for him to get into massive trouble. Even more so now that his face was wildly known among criminals.

He turned around and ended up having to look quite a way up to meet the newcomer's eyes. With a bright smile and sparkling blue eyes, the man looked way too enthusiastic to be talking to a random teenager in the middle of an overcrowded library. He also appeared to be quite  well off, wearing a long coat and a dark turtleneck which both looked like they had been commissioned specifically for him. His shoes were leather, and perfectly polished. He had to be the kid's father and, if Peter was right, he had some kind of grudge towards him. 

Damian’s father didn’t look the part of a dangerous crime lord, with his bright smile and his earnest eyes. He smelled odd though, a mix of expensive cologne and of something chemical. Drugs? Medication? He couldn’t quite identify it.

"Ah…" He mumbled. "Uh. Thank you? I’ll be alright." Remembering the kid standing right next to him, he hurriedly added: "I swear, I did not kidnap your son."

Smooth, Parker. Real smooth.

The tall man frowned, his smile faltered. If he was a criminal, he’d know him as what he truly was, and having a metahuman say that to his face couldn’t be pleasant for him.

"You couldn’t kidnap me." Damian informed him in a pleasant tone, patting him on shoulder. The display caused his father’s eyebrows to raise even higher. Apparently, not even his parent was used to the boy’s antics. 

"I wouldn’t want to kidnap you." Peter cleared his throat, looking back at Barbara, whose own eyebrows were twitching in annoyance. "Do you… uh… mind? Sorry, I just. Ah. Have to go to work soon."

"No worries." The smile was back on, brighter and bigger than ever. "Do what you must."

Neither one of the two strangers moved from behind his seat. Peter felt the urge to bolt away from the situation but, instead of running, he took a long, slow breath and turned to face Barbara. He caught a glimpse of her shaking her head at the man behind him before her glare turned into an earnest smile directed at him.

So they knew each other, uh.

"Let’s get started. It’ll be pretty quick. I just need your full name-…"

"Peter Parker." He told her. It felt weird, he hadn’t given his last name a lot recently. She wrote it down on her computer. He heard the man shift slightly behind him, sliding his hands into his pockets.

"Phone number?"

"I… don’t have one yet."

Barbara looked over her computer at him but, instead of asking him why, she  nodded as if it was a common occurrence. For all he knew, it might be.

"Email address?"

"I uh… I also don’t have one."

That was easy to fix at least. He hadn’t had any reason to create one in this world, otherwise he would have made it already. He still felt his cheeks heat up as the strangers shifted behind him again. What were they thinking? They looked rich, were they judging him for how poorly put together his life was?

"Home address? You said you have an apartment now."

He thought about his neighborhood, the people he sometimes saw in the staircase and his landlady. Even if it was just for a library card, he had a feeling it wouldn’t be a good idea to let anyone know about it. The place definitely did not seem to be run in a very legal manner.

"I would rather… not."

This time she did frown, although it didn’t seem to be directed at him. "I do need a way to contact you, but…"

She reached down under the desk and pulled out a small pile of card, held together by a plastic cord. She slid one out and swiped it over her computer then handed it over to him.

"Temporary. Please come back with an email as soon as you can, I’m not exactly allowed to do this."

"You’re not?" Peter stared down at the library card. Why would she break the rules for him? "Uh… thanks?"

"Don’t mention it. But do get back soon to actually make an account."

She led him closer to the main drop off area, past the line and down to a more private, smaller counter. She politely ignoring Damian’s glares aimed straight at her back. The boy’s father peered curiously at the books as they were being scanned. Perfect, now he was going to think Peter had some kind of anger management problem. Oh, joy.

He smiled awkwardly at the tall man, feeling sweat creep down his back. 

Barbara ended up lending him a bag as well, made of fabric and with an ink line art of a a woman wearing an intricate dress of flowers and pearls. Despite being intent on him returning it, she still pushed it into his hands when he tried to put it back down. He ended up stuffing the borrowed books away, all under the watchful eyes of the father and son duo, which still had not left his side.

"Where to?" The adult smiled, clapping a hand on his shoulder. The palm of his hands felt rough despite the shirt in between their skins. Calluses and old scars. Unusual, for someone who seemed so well off.

"Really sir." Peter shook his head, waving at Barbara and making a beeline for the exit, hoping that would be enough to shake him off. "I’m alright."

"But you helped my son get to the front desk, didn’t you? See this as a way to thank you. I truly don’t mind."

If this was a trap and the guy was just pretending to want to be helpful, he was doing a very good job at it. His scent was smothered by chemicals and cologne but his face didn’t show any sign of dishonesty, and he looked as eager as a puppy about to go on a walk. 

"I…"

A trap would make him late to work, but if this was a legit offer wasn’t it rude to just say no? He bit his bottom lip, wishing Barbara had stayed with him until the exit. She could have helped with this, she knew the guy. According to her, she used to date his older son. He didn’t really have time to head back and get her, no matter how much he wanted to.

"It’s not in the best area." He said instead.

That was not enough to dissuade the guy, who was acting like a golden retriever in human form. The man’s smile grew tenfold and he assured him he was not bothered at all at the idea of going into North Gotham. He added in quite a few friendly shoulder pats and a bright "Call me Bruce" while he was at it.
Notes:

    B gets home and immediately starts looking into the name Peter Parker.

    Peter is too polite lol.

    bruce is like a B- dad in this. I’m taking off the abusive stuff he does like manipulating tim and steph, triggering Jason and punching Tim and Nightwing. He still has massive issues though. Just not the punching his kids kind.

    Some of my irl trouble is getting better. This chapter took a month of writing a few hundred words at a time to get done, quality might have suffered but it’s finally done!!! And I have more free time now!!

Chapter Text

Bruce was a terrible driver.

Bruce was an exceptionally skilled driver.

Both of those statements should not have been able to be true simultaneously, yet they were. The polite, overly enthusiastic and most definitely suspicious man turned out to be perhaps the most reckless driver Peter had ever had the displeasure of riding with. He was even more brazen than Tony, which was an incredible achievement. After promising him they would be in time for his shift, which was less than fifteen minutes away, the stranger had stepped right onto the gas petal and had barely lifted his foot since. The only times they ever slowed down were before entering a corner and even then, they were still going way too fast for comfort.

This was made so much worse by the model of car the man was driving. On the outside, the vehicle looked like a classic supercar, sleek and painted in black with touches of blue. The inside was larger than expected, with enough space for maybe five or six people to sit in. More surprising, there was no brand name or logo anywhere on the vehicle. Did Bruce have this commissioned? Could cars even be commissioned? Either way, it had looked fast before he even got in and his first impression had not been wrong.  Peter had no idea how that thing could possibly be street legal.

Honestly, it probably wasn't, but who was he to say anything about it? All he knew about cars was that they had four wheels and that he had no idea how to drive them. Oh, and that he never wanted to sit into one ever again.

Note to self, never accept rides from shady wealthy strangers . 

Was everyone in Gotham as thoughtless as Bruce when behind the wheel? Thinking about it, Jason was also an extreme risk taker whenever he rode his motorcycle, it was a wonder he hadn't wrecked it yet. He really hoped those two were outliers and not part of the norm. Stopping speeding cars was not his specialty, it always used so much webbing. As it was, he had enough left in his shooters for a couple big swings, perhaps three or four if they were short distance. Definitely not enough to end a chase or stop two cars from crashing into each other. 

Every single one of the Bats he had met on the road had been completely ignoring any kind of traffic law as well. Perhaps it really was a Gotham thing then. He just had to get used to it, he supposed.

He fought the urge to sigh and tried to distract himself by looking in the rearview mirror at Damian. The boy was sitting right behind him, openly staring at the back of his neck with a blank look on his face. No help there, that kid was almost as stress inducing as his father’s unhinged driving style. Great. He was just destined to suffer then. He twisted one of his hands into the strap of Barbara's book bag, regretting every decision that had led him to this point. He was already on thin ice at work, missing another evening because he got into a fight on his way to his shift would not help his case in the slightest.

That’s what I get for not saying no when I should have.

His inner voice took on a bit of May’s lecturing tone. He could almost see her, shaking her head, exasperated but affectionate. She had always been clear about one thing: He had to look out for himself and not only for the civilians he protected.

Well... He had never been very good at self preservation.

Damian’s eyes were still on him. He made it seem as if he never blinked. Peter had never met such an eerie kid before, and that had to be the boy's usual behavior since his father didn't seem concerned about it in the slightest. Bruce was thoughtlessly babbling about how commendable it was that such a young man worked and how he wished no kid his age had to go through that. Most definitely born into privilege, that one. The way he put it, he was risking his life every night delivering pizza.

In a way, he was. Perhaps the man even knew about it, if he was aware of his history at the Pits.

His Spider sense was bothering him. It was a low buzz in his mind, a tingling at the back of his neck that ran down his spine. He had a feeling the whole situation might be turning sour if he did one wrong move. Something was up, but he wasn't able to decide what exactly, other than the fact he was riding in a supercar alongside a reckless, shady man and his equally reckless, shady son. He tugged at the bag's strap again, crushing the urge to scratch his skin and shift in his seat. Act natural.

A trap was looking more and more likely. Unfortunate. He had hoped this would be a simple, nice ride to work but he was never allowed to have nice things. Sure, he could bust one of the doors open but that would be putting the kid in danger. He couldn't believe a father would dare drive like this with his own child in the vehicle. Even knowing he, as a metahuman, wouldn't be hurt too badly by a collision, and probably could dodge the crash before it happened, Peter kept on tensing up at every violent turn. He couldn’t look away from the road for more than a few seconds at a time, afraid they would smash into a truck or a wall while he wasn't paying attention. 

His brain screamed at him to run before they ended up colliding with a building but, with the boy there, he had to make sure nothing bad happened. He couldn't let a kid be punished for his dad's mistakes, no matter how creepy said kid was and how weird it was that he hadn't looked away from him once since they left the library.

He only noticed Bruce had stopped talking when the leather of the seat behind him creaked, the only sound in the car except for the roar of the engine. How long had the man been silent? He was too tired for this. He hoped the ride wouldn't get too awkward.

"What is it like to rely on someone else for employment?" Damian leaned forward, speaking too close to his ears for comfort. He could hear the kid’s heartbeat. It was fast. Was it from excitement or from fear? 

"Phrasing, Damian." Bruce tapped a finger on the wheel, swerving away just in time to avoid colliding with a massive delivery truck.

It took a moment for Peter to understand the kid's question had not been an insult. He bit back a comment that definitely would not have made either of the two strangers happy and tried to gather his thoughts as best he could. What part of his pizza delivery job would be interesting to a rich, potentially criminally involved, child? 

Maybe…

He tilted his head to look at Damian. The boy was completely focused on him, ignoring his father’s reckless driving or, more likely, so used to it he didn’t notice it anymore.

"It can be risky." Peter said slowly. "I deliver food at night so I occasionally get into… difficult situations." He hoped that was subtle enough not to incriminate him, just in case neither of them had any idea of what he was talking about. 

Bruce’s heartbeat did not change one bit, neither did his breathing. His son, however, inhaled sharply, pupils widening. It was subtle but it was there. The kid knew what he was talking about. So he hadn’t been wrong about his suspicions, the two of them were involved in criminal activities.

"Oh no!" Bruce gasped, sounding genuinely horrified despite his steady heart rate. "I’m so sorry you have to go through this."

He either believed fully in what he was saying or he was the best liar Peter had ever met. In Gotham, the latter was much more likely than the former. Unfortunately for him though, his son was not as well trained in the art of deception. The boy’s eyes had tightened, some muscles close to his mouth were twitching. Yes, he was aware of who he was. Why would a ten year old know when his father was oblivious? Whatever the man’s role in the underworld actually was, it had made him an excellent liar. One so skilled he could steady his heart and control his breathing perfectly.

"No worries," Peter smiled sweetly, "It’s never any trouble to get them to back off."

Don’t be so threatening they try to shoot me but push just enough that they reconsider whatever they have planned. I can do this.

"Silly me, of course you would have a weapon!" Bruce laughed, a touch of awkwardness thrown in, his scent still completely unidentifiable. Too many chemicals there. Was this on purpose? How common was it for metahumans to have enhanced senses? The more he noticed about the man, the more uncomfortable he was getting. His air of enthusiasm and happiness rang fake somehow. He had no way to tell why it felt so wrong, he could only rely on his Spider sense and his ability to spot micro expressions. 

Alright, maybe he could push just a little bit more. He put on his best confused civilian face and gasped.

"A weapon?" He shuddered in faux horror. "Oh no sir, I would never. I don’t need a weapon to be safe." He ended the sentence with a wide grin of his own. There, the picture of perfect innocence. And no way to figure out the true meaning of his reply without being connected to the underground.

Good job, Parker, you did something right for once. Reminding the guy he could beat him with his pinkie should be enough to get him off his back. If not, he would just have to subdue the two of them and get them out of the car safely before he bounced. Easy, he could do that in his sleep. 

Damian’s heartbeat picked up and he heard his breath catch. When he glanced back, the kid's pupils were slightly dilated. Scared? No, focusing on his scent, he didn’t smell afraid. That… that was most definitely him being excited. But over what? 

A very odd theory popped into his mind.

What if they were criminals but they were not there to trap him? 

The boy was oddly… enthusiastic to hear him subtly remind his dad about his ability to beat up pretty much anyone who did not have similar powers to him. Could it be that they weren’t mad at him but instead…

Oh no.

Please no.

Did Peter have fans?

He tried extremely hard not to let any shock color his face. Oh if there was any kind of higher divinity in this universe, please have them give him some mercy and let him be wrong.

Now, Spiderman had a very large following back in New York. Even after the Mysterio incident, he still had a lot of supporters. He had just as many detractors back then but his fans kept on standing up for him until the end and often clashed with Jonah’s rabid audience whenever they met. Those people had decided to support him because of his actions, or simply after he had a talk with them on the way to patrol and somehow made a good impression. It was a bit uncomfortable to know people looked up to him like this when he hadn’t even been out of high school but at least he had known this was connected to what he thought were pretty good deeds.

But now…

Did his fights at the Pits make such an impact he had acquired fans? And if Damian wasn’t scared of him but excited to see him in person, did that mean he was one of them?

Was this even a trap or a roundabout way for the kid to meet him?

Should he be happy or creeped out?

And if that was the case why the hell did his neck not stop tingling?

His head spun with the dozen of questions that suddenly rose up in his mind. He clutched the bag, pressing it closer to his chest and feeling the shape of the books inside. Everything was under control, he was going to be alright. What if he had fans who thought he was a ruthless fighter, driven by bloodlust and gain? Could he fault them for thinking that? Spiderman had only appeared once in this world, and he had completely failed at saving the victims of Firefly's attack. He wouldn't be a fan of himself either.

Damian seemed completely unaware of his inner turmoil and kept on talking. With a straight face but a slightly trembling hand the boy asked:

"Are you a martial artist?"

It took a lot of willpower for the New Yorker to keep the horror he was feeling off his face. 

Oh no, he really was a fanboy. He could smell that eagerness from miles away. He wished he could disappear into the ground, erase everything that had happened since he went to Gotham and launch himself at another dimension.

Or not. He still had to fix things with Jason.

"I… Sort of?" He coughed, wondering if what he did was considered a martial art. He had some formal training but most of it was instinct and overwhelming physical superiority. He had been told he had an excellent fighting mindset before, but he had only received a few dozen hours of formal training in total. He knew approximate boxing forms and some other bits and pieces from other disciplines, did that count? It had to count, if the boy had asked. It was becoming obvious the kid had seen him fight before and he had thoroughly enjoyed it.

"I practice several martial arts." Damian told him smugly, clicking his tongue again. "They are an excellent way to sharpen the mind and body, as long as you master them properly of course."

How old was he supposed to be? Peter had never met a kid that talked like this before. 

"That’s pretty cool." He said eventually, hoping this wouldn’t devolve into the boy asking him for a demonstration of his fighting prowess. He had that happen to him before as Spiderman and, despite asking for it, many people did not like being reminded they could not hold a candle to most vigilantes, even if it was just play fighting or for a social media video. Civilians got pretty touchy about being reminded mutants like him existed and that some could erase them from existence with a sneeze.

Of course he wasn’t that strong. But he had been involved in interplanetary battles and he was pretty sure Thor could pulverize a mortal accidentally, especially when he was at his angriest.

"It is indeed very… cool." Damian wrinkled his nose slightly at the word but kept on talking, inching even closer to the back of his seat. "Father knows as many as I do, perhaps a bit less. I have practiced a lot you see."

Bruce nodded agreeably, slowing down just enough that they didn’t swing into the side of a dilapidated hotel. The tires squealed worryingly. Peter gritted his teeth. The tingling was getting worse. If this wasn’t a trap, then he probably had to worry about them crashing. Without his web shooters, how could he deal with that situation? Grab Damian in a way that wouldn’t hurt his spine, grab Bruce, break the windshield, jump out? That could work… They already knew who he was anyway, so he couldn’t make it any worse.

"You must be very dedicated." He nodded politely, smiling at the kid. "I haven’t trained as much as you."

The boy scoffed. "Of course not." He raised his hand, reaching up above the front seat and-

The light tingling turned into a knife stabbing at his mind, screaming at him to MOVE. Peter shot forward, bending so fast he heard the seatbelt tear, its strap dangling off, half of it snapped at his waist. It hadn't been strong enough to keep him in place. He looked up, expecting to see a wall headed straight for them, or a car going too slow and staying in their way but, instead, his Spider sense quieted. He hid his hands, which had instinctively become tight fists, into the book bag, feeling the paper and the covers inside.

Behind him, Damian let his hand drop. Both of their hearts were thumping ridiculously fast albeit for what he assumed were two very different reasons.

What did that kid just try to do?

"Are you alright?" Bruce asked, raising an eyebrow and oh god he was looking away from the road whywhywhy.

"I’m fine sir." He lied, hunched over slightly. "Just a cramp."

Please don't notice I ripped part of your million dollars car off. Please don't make me pay for it. I need money for groceries.

He felt hysterical laughter bubbling up in his chest, he shoved it back down.

"Make sure you stretch, then." The man nodded sagely. The chemicals hiding his scent were utterly maddening. What was he thinking? Was he even aware of… whatever his son had been planning on doing?

"I will." He took a deep breath, aware of Damian shifting behind him, settling back down. Not a fanboy. Definitely not a fanboy, that had been such a stupid idea. This was a trap. Not a fan meet up. He was so arrogant, thinking someone would want to meet him that bad. "You can let me out here, thank you." 

"Nonsense! We’re almost there." Bruce tapped the wheel with his fingers. Anxious? It was so hard to tell, his face wasn’t giving anything away. "Damian, get him some water, please. It might make him feel better."

With perfect obedience, his son opened up a small door under his seat, revealing a fridge of all things. Weirdest part was it was absolutely stocked, with several bottles of water, juice, cans of sodas and even some snacks. Probably some rich people thing Peter wouldn’t get to see again for a long time. The boy picked a bottle from the top row and handed it to him with a perfectly neutral expression. He didn't need his Spider sense to tell him not to accept it, but the tingling still confirmed his suspicions.

"Thank you but I'm..."

I'm allergic to water? No I can't say that.

"I'll be fine." He smiled, feeling sweat run down the side of his forehead. 

The boy ended up cracking open the water for himself, although he did not drink from it. Some of it spilled on his fingers during one particularly rough turn. It smelled perfectly ordinary but…

Don’t scratch your neck, don’t scratch your neck, don’t scratch your neck…

Perhaps the universe had finally decided to show him some mercy as they soon slowed down and Bruce expertly parked them right next to Jason’s motorcycle. It was secured in front of Marco’s, in its usual cocoon of chains and locks of varying sizes. They were there. He had survived the ride. They hadn't crashed. Behind him, Damian set the bottle down, sighing disappointedly. His unsettling behavior had took on creepy undertones after what had just happened. If his luck held, he would never have to interact with him ever again.

Peter almost threw himself out of the car, only barely remembering to keep up appearances and exit in a somewhat natural manner. To his dismay, the two potential criminals followed him out of the vehicle, stepping on the curb. With their designer clothes and their expensive car, it was only a matter of minutes before someone tried to mug them. Were they even aware of that? Would he have to protect them if it happened? He really hoped not. They should be smart enough to bring a way to defend themselves along, especially if they had been trying to catch him in some kind of trap.

Bruce smiled, still as enthusiastic as ever and walked towards him, holding out his hand expectantly. 

"Once again, thank you for looking after my son, it was a pleasure to meet you, Peter."

He was obviously expecting him to shake the proffered hand, and the teenager almost did. Something in his gut twisted.

DON’T.

STAY AWAY.

He took a step back instinctively, surprised by the intensity of that feeling. Bruce was still smiling, towering over him. Now that they were out of the car, Peter could hear the wind, feel it against his shirt. It was so cold. In between that, the stretching shadows and the man’s indistinct chemical scent, Damian’s father appeared incredibly eerie. He felt like he could see a glimpse of something bigger, something darker hidden inside of the small oddities that surrounded him. Oh he was involved into some really messed up stuff, wasn't he?

Why did his Spider sense consider him so dangerous? He bit his lip, fingers twitching at his sides. With how things had been going lately, he had to be one of the rogues.

"Peter!"

He shot up, backing away a few more steps and almost crashing into Jason, who was rushing out of the restaurant. The young man grabbed his shoulder and tugged him back, placing himself between him and the car. He was wearing his usual leather jacket and dark clothes, smelled of gunpowder and cigarette. But there was also some...

Wait.

What is that?

He could feel…

Rage. 

Hatred.

Grief.

Pain.

Swirling anger, a crimson storm of fury and violence clouding his senses. He didn’t understand how Jason could even bear to stand there when he was feeling such strong emotions. Had it been him, he would have left already, or he would have risked exploding at people. There was so much intensity in that rush of feelings he completely forgot about Bruce's eeriness and Damian's suspicious behavior. The only time he had ever felt something similar coming from his coworker, they had been driving away from the Pits, chased by a more experienced, more established vigilante.

Red Hood’s face twisted into something terrible, eyes burning with promises of blood and revenge. His hand tightened around Peter’s shoulder, digging into the fabric and pressing against the skin under. It would have bruised any regular person. He wanted to move away but his feet wouldn't obey him. If he left, he had a feeling the situation would escalate very quickly. 

"Jason," he lied, "you're hurting my shoulder."

His friend did not react to his voice. He did not even spare him a glance, all of his attention was on the two strangers, on Bruce specifically. And the worst part was...

Bruce was looking back at him with the same intensity.

There was no anger in the older man's gaze, but that cold gaze was perhaps even worse. He was completely stone faced, no emotion seeping through other than grim determination. The chemicals were still shrouding his smell, but several muscles in his neck had tensed and he was standing slightly straighter. He was expecting some kind of fight.

What the...

"Jason." Peter tried again. "Let's go inside."

"Shut up." His partner snapped. "You have no fucking clue what-..." He shook his head. "Do you even know who that asshole is?"

Bruce chose that moment to speak up, tilting his head down slightly. The only light in the street came from the restaurant, it turned his face into a mask of sharp shadows and angles. He did not sound very friendly anymore, although he was not fully hostile.

"Are you going to attack me?" Violent words but said in a deceptively soft tone. His heart rate was slow, steady.

Jason snarled, tearing his hand off Peter's shoulder and stepping forward. Fury rolled off of him, thick and overpowering. "You fucking..." 

This time, he was the one getting grabbed, stopped in the middle of his lunge by a hand tugging the back of his jacket. For a few terrifying seconds, it seemed as though he would ignore it and keep on going, forcing Peter to use more of his superhuman strength to keep him from starting a street fight. Eventually, the former rogue stopped, shoulders drooping slightly but eyes not moving from their target. He had so much hatred in him, so much sadness.

The restaurant's door slammed open once more and the sound of someone running out caused some of the tension to dissipate. Bruce stepped back, putting a hand on his son's shoulder and frowning down at his feet, looking thoughtful. His face was a lot more expressive than it had been in the car, and Peter thought he could read some sort of pain hidden in there. He felt as if he was looking at a foreign movie without any subtitles. He could see what was happening but he was completely missing the context of it.

Marco limped to stand in between the four of them, arms crossed and eyes glaring furiously.

"Why the hell are you idiots starting a fight in front of my restaurant?"

He stared straight at Jason, gritting his teeth, then turned to Peter. The disappointment in his eyes made the teen cringe but his boss was already looking away, at the last two people involved in the altercation. The Gothamite's eyes went from anger to surprise then to utter confusion. 

"What the-" The man muttered, eyes widening. "What the fuck are you doing here?"

Peter felt left out, it looked like everyone but him was already acquainted with each other.

Nobody had any time to speak, Marco was already whirling around and pointing a finger at his delivery boys, voice low and dangerous. "Both of you, get inside." He ignored Jason's growl, despite the younger man being a few inches taller than him, and significantly larger. "Look, kid, I don't give a shit what beef you have with Wayne of all people but you'll be resolving it somewhere that isn't right next to my business. If you don't like it, you can pack your shit up."

"Fuck off!" Jason raised a fist, which Peter easily caught and forced back down, using perhaps a little too much strength. His friend's rage turned towards him in a flash as the older teen tried to free himself. "Let go. Right now."

"I don't think it would be a very good idea." The metahuman replied, as calmly as possible. His other hand tightened on Barbara's bag, he wondered if it would be okay to drop it. The ground was still a bit wet, mud remained from the many snowfalls and the wind was splashing water around his shoes. 

"It isn't." Marco agreed. "Get your ass inside." He turned to Damian and his father, not looking intimidated in the slightest. "Unless you're going to buy some food, you should leave."

For the first time that day, Bruce's composure cracked and he took in a sudden, sharp breath. He shook his head slowly, tearing his eyes away from Jason with apparent difficulty. He looked like a man who had just woken up from a weird dream. 

"Maybe we'll come back another time." He said. "I apologize for..." He frowned, looking down at his son, who had spent the entire exchange glaring daggers at everyone involved. "... the situation."

"Don't apologize to the likes of him." Damian protested, sounding both threatening and petulant. "He's a-"

The insult never left his mouth. His father had already dragged him back into the car and was gently but firmly pushing him into it. With a curse, Jason tried to free himself from Peter's grip one last time, slipping out of his jacket and lunging towards the vehicle. It was easy enough to catch the back of his shirt and wrap an arm around his waist. He was strong but he couldn't compete with his coworker when it came to raw physical power. The two of them struggled, slipping on the wet sidewalk. Despite his bulk, the older of the two was surprisingly slippery, almost managing to escape a few times.

"Stop fighting and get in there!" Marco snapped at them from the restaurant's front room.

In the end, the books did end up on the ground. 

Peter felt terrible about it. 
Notes:

    Imagine going out to see what weird fight your latest strays/employees are starting in front of your restaurant and they're about to fist fight a billionaire.
    Marco doesn't know Bruce personally but he can recognize him on sight like most people in Gotham.
    Bruce and Jason are both running on zero sleep and an unhealthy amount of caffeine, I call this the Tim Drake lifestyle.

    Oh boy oh boy I hate writing dialogue

Chapter 34: Under control

Chapter Text

After it became obvious the fight between them was going nowhere fast, Jason stormed off without a word. Peter wondered if he should follow him. He was still a bit shocked by the fact the shady guy who had driven him to work turned out to be one of the richest men in this world and a local celebrity.

He picked his things off the ground and walked into the restaurant, earning himself a very unimpressed look from his boss. Their shift was supposed to start a full ten minutes before they had started arguing and the man's twitching eyebrows made it clear he wasn't very pleased about them being so late. Unfortunately, he would have to wait for a bit longer. He couldn't leave his current vigilante partner to wander into Gotham in that state of mind. With him being that angry, he could end up doing something bad, something they would both regret.

"Just one second, I'll be right back."

"Do your thing." Marco shrugged, pouring himself a glass of something cloudy and dark.

He smiled awkwardly and set the sodden bag down on the nearest chair. The fabric was covered in mud and he could only pray the books inside fared a tiny bit better. He felt bad about disappointing Barbara but a small, treacherous part of his mind was worrying about having to spend money to pay her back. Hopefully he would get some good tips that evening. Depending on how the next few hours went, he might have to figure out how to make his next suit alone, and he had already given the materials he bought to Jason. That had been a mistake.

He had a tendency to make those. He hoped May wasn't too ashamed of him, from wherever she was.

Marco rolled his eyes but didn't stop him when he headed back out. He had lit himself a cigarette as soon as the fight between his employees had started but hadn't intervened. Of course, it wouldn't be very smart for an injured civilian to try and get in the way of a metahuman and the person foolish enough to fight him. 

The poor guy couldn't be having an easy time of keeping his business running, with how often his two delivery guys caused trouble. It was a wonder he hadn't fired them yet.

And if he does... then what?

Peter bit his lip and closed the front door of the restaurant slowly. He had thought things were somewhat stable now that he had a place to sleep, a semi-decent job and a way to get supplies. He had been wrong. The misadventures he kept getting himself into were affecting his civilian life and his odds of keeping a roof over his head were looking grim. There was no guarantee he would still be living in his apartment a week from now. He wanted to scream in frustration. Almost one month in another world and he still had not managed to put his life back on track.

He could try to find another job, somewhere that didn't care about ID or his past experience. However, everyone and their mother now knew he was a metahuman. As long as he stayed in the northern half of the city, he wouldn't be escaping his reputation and, if he tried to go to the richer southern side, he would likely have to go through stricter hiring processes. He could always try to rely on Jason and his seemingly endless supply of funds and hideouts but he had only known the other teen for a short period of time and, although he liked him and respected him, he was not fully sure he could trust him with something so important as shelter and food. 

Oh, and they also just had a fist fight. 

He could always leave town, but that meant giving up on his promise to have Red Hood and Spider-Man team up for one month. He couldn't do that, they were only a couple days into their deal, and he hadn't even really started trying to help him. He had to figure out the source of the anger issues Nightwing had mentioned and he had to try to get Red Hood back on the right path. Vigilantism wasn't the most legal occupation but it was a lot better than whatever he had been up to during his crime lord days.

Peter shook his head and looked down, trying to spot the freshest footsteps on the thin layer of snow. Jason couldn't have gone far, he hadn't taken his motorcycle with him. He found some tracks that looked more defined than the others muddying up the sidewalk and started following them. At least that was one thing Gotham's horrible weather was good for. 

His mind kept wandering back to the same question, no matter how hard he tried to ignore it.

Am I still going to have a job when I get back to Marco's?

If he didn't, maybe he could pick up a camera, get some good shots of a hero in a back alley.

That would be a fun way of getting back at the Bats for trying to drug him. He wondered how much the newspapers here would pay for a decent picture of the local vigilante leader. According to the Internet, the man had started his career as a sort of urban legend and it had only been after he teamed up with and helped found the Justice League that he had started to become well known outside of the city. Even then, there were barely more than ten good photos of him. Everything else was some level of blurry, ridiculously dark or obviously altered. He knew he could do better than that.

It would be nice to annoy them a bit, yes, but he couldn't really do that to a fellow vigilante. He didn't particularly care about being seen and being filmed or photographed as Spider-Man, but he had a very different approach to vigilantism. He sighed. Even if he didn't care about the morality behind selling pictures of the Bats, there was also the risk of anything he did towards them being taken as provocation. The only one who had been even remotely civil was Nightwing, who was surprisingly nice, despite the little shovel talk he had given him earlier that afternoon.

Why couldn't every Bat be like him? That would make things so much easier.

He kept on following Jason's path outside of the pizzeria and further along into the streets outside. He was getting closer and thought he could hear him one or two blocks away. For the first time, he took a second to stop and listen. He felt cold. Since the spider bite, he had always had enhanced senses, had always been able to hear, see and smell better than regular humans. He, however, wasn't sure of when he had started being able to identify someone's heartbeats from several streets away.

Peter looked down at his hands, frowning. He had been finishing up his growth spurt lately. Was he becoming stronger due to growing older, or was there another reason behind it? He flexed his fingers. He would have to experiment. Later. When he had time. If he ever had time.

Jason's heart was beating too fast. He was still angry. Not good.

Getting closer to the one dark and cramped alleyway the rogue had chosen to hide out in, Peter started to slow down his pace. He was not afraid. He was confident he could easily beat most baseline humans in a straight fight, no matter how experienced they were, but he didn't know how he was supposed to act. Oh, he had seen a lot of things in his life, helped a lot of people, but the kind of broken relationships Jason seemed to have with about half of Gotham's vigilante scene was a new challenge. Ignoring bullies and other unfortunate high school related incidents, he never had that much issue getting along with people, especially after he developed his powers.

He turned into the tiny street, silently checking for signs of life other than him and the other vigilante. He could hear some people talking inside a nearby apartment, a lady cooking meat on the last floor, a couple that had just gotten home. Nobody was paying attention to them and all of the sounds were muffled by windows or walls. Gotham wasn't the best city to leave an open window unattended anyway. Even now he could hear a few gunshots, off into the distance.

"Hey." He waved at a shadow in the back of the alleyway, which smelled and sounded like Jason. "I came to check in on you."

The Jason-shaped shadow shifted. No insult, no rushing towards him. That was good, that was progress. He tried to project an air of calm that he wasn't feeling and pushed everything else out of his mind. He had to focus on this. 

"I didn't know you and Wayne have history." He said, after some hesitation. "Honestly, I met him by accident and I didn't think much of it. I kind of get why you don't like me being in his car, though, he's pretty creepy."

And his preteen son had been even creepier. The radio shows he sometimes listened to always pictured Brucie as an adequate but airheaded businessman, whose main virtues were a decent business sense and a lifelong passion for charity work. The worse thing that had ever been said about him was that he had womanizing tendencies and a history of reckless behavior. Nothing out of the ordinary for a billionaire, he figured. He should have expected a rich guy from Gotham would have some sort of hidden dark side but he had other things to worry about than this universe's rich and famous.

Maybe he was just naive. He wanted to grit his teeth but held back, careful to maintain a relaxed posture and neutral expression. Unlike Jason, he was still close to the larger street and the lights that bordered it. Some of them were broken but there were enough for his face to be clear.

"It wasn't an accident." 

A whisper, soft and almost entirely covered by the wind. He heard it, of course. For some reason, his coworker knew Wayne well enough that he sounded perfectly confident saying their meeting at the library was no coincidence. Why would he think that? Maybe they had worked together on some kind of criminal project and had a fallout. It was the simplest explanation but it didn't seem to fully fit. His instincts told him the truth was more complicated. Nothing could ever be simple around him, he hated it sometime. 

"You think? He did hit me as suspicious." He replied, hoping he was hiding his confusion well enough.

The shadow blurred, becoming taller, larger. More anger filled the air, Peter felt an urge to shift his feet around to get ready for an attack. He crossed his arms, leaning back on his heels. He had to be careful. Wayne was obviously a very sensitive subject. He couldn't see why. The more he figured out about his coworker, the more mysteries seemed to pop up. He had just started to wonder about him having been part of the Bats' vigilante team before he went off to become a rogue, but that theory in no way included the man having feuds with billionaires or his intense and unnatural bursts of rage.

"You thought he was suspicious?" The shape in the dark stilled but the smell of fury didn't lessen. "As if. You were in his car. You showed him where you work."

Peter shrugged, still pretending he was calm, still acting like he had everything under control.

"He didn't start acting weird until the car ride, actually. He was pretty nice before. That was an act, I think."

"It is." Jason hissed, stepping forward slightly. "This fucker only cares about his own ass. Almost everything he does is an act."

The metahuman frowned, surprised at the intensity of that  statement. He had heard that sort of thing from his coworker before but that had been directed at someone else. Two someone. His foster father and Batman were the usual targets, and often the cause, of his outbursts. Sometimes, he complained about some other vigilantes but those two always came back and always caused the same kind of extreme anger, bitterness and sadness he was emitting now. How strange. Either he had a tendency to get into massive drama with older guys or...

Or...

Peter's eyes widened as a stupid, idiotic theory suddenly popped into his mind. It had no proof, nothing backing it up, but it fit. Jason hated three men more than anyone else. The first was the vigilante Batman, who Peter suspected had been his mentor as a vigilante. The second was his foster father, who was a high ranking employee of Wayne Tech. The third was, apparently, Bruce Wayne, the owner of that company and of the entire Wayne conglomerate. There was nothing indicating a connection between those three strangers, yet...

He filed the possibility away. He would have to come back to it later, after the current emergency was dealt with. He couldn't get distracted.

Not yet.

Besides, thinking about it was no help for his current situation. Jason had noticed his reaction and was practically growling at him, his body shaking, making him stand out among the other still shadows. The street was cramped but it was still full of odd shapes and smells. Garbage mostly, but also some furniture, abandoned off to the sides, under rusted metallic stairways and next to battered doors that had definitely seen better days. In between those still shapes, the teenager was easy to spot. He had started to pace.

"That surprised? What, did you buy into the Brucie act, too? I thought you were smart!"

Cruel words but that was to be expected. Peter shook his head.

"Honestly," he replied with another shrug, "I didn't really know much about the guy. I don't really read the news."

It was a lie, in a way, but it was also partly true. He had gotten out of that habit after every newspaper in New York had shifted to investigating his life, his family and his friends. He had, of course, made use of his radio to catch up on the news in this world and often listened to videos online while he worked on dismantling the Iron Spider but a few weeks of learning was nowhere near enough to make up for a lifetime in an alternate version of the United States. 

"I don't really want anything to do with him now, though. He gave me a bad vibe." He added, seeing his first answer had done nothing to calm his partner down.

A bad vibe was a poor way to explain his Spider sense to someone who didn't know about it but he felt like keeping that particular card close to his chest for the time being. Most of his combat instincts could be interpreted as him having enhanced reflexes and that bit of misinformation could be useful in the long run. After one month, if he could still trust Jason, if he managed to make him give up his aspirations to be a rogue and fully transition to a vigilante, he would let him know. He felt like that wouldn't be a weird thing to keep quiet in Gotham. 

"He did?" Jason sounded more surprised than angry now, but there was still an undercurrent of rage in the way he moved. "The bastard is usually a perfect liar. That's his best talent. He lied to me, you know?"

He sounded lost in thoughts, maybe in memories. Peter shook his head. Thinking back on it, Bruce had not said or done anything odd during the car ride. The way he acted could be interpreted as being a bit overbearing, maybe, but he had been polite. Without Damian there, he wouldn't have been able to tell anything was off, at least until they met Jason outside of the pizzeria. The billionaire's attitude had changed there, and there were those warnings from his Spider sense...

"He sounded like a nice guy but I'm pretty sure he tried to do something to me a few times. I can't tell what, though."

The first half of his sentence caused the figure in the shadows to tense, and the rest of it wasn't much better. Jason swore and kicked at a nearby wall. The sound was oddly metallic and much louder than it should have been. It rung through the alley and some of the voices inside the nearby apartments quieted, turning into frightened whispers.

"Asshole put a bug on you." The furious rogue spoke slowly. His voice sounded harsh, furious. "This is exactly why you don't get into this fucker's car!" He finished his sentence with another kick to the unfortunate building he had decided to take his anger out on.

"I don't think he did." 

He remembered the car ride perfectly and at no point had he let himself be touched after his Spider sense lit up. He still planned to look over his clothes once he got home but that was mostly due to the fact spy bugs were expensive and, if a billionaire just decided to gift him one, he wasn't about to throw it away. He could do a lot with one of those bad boys. Jason, however, didn't share his positive outlook and was still wailing on the furniture around them. Better that than have him start a fight with someone else, honestly.

"If he wanted to put a bug on you, he did it." More anger, more kicking. Peter uncrossed his arms, wondering if he should try to stop the outburst before his partner got too hurt. Hitting that kind of building, made of old, rough stones, couldn't be healthy for his feet. Punching the tables and chairs littering the ground wasn't much better, splinters were nothing to laugh at, they could get infected.

"You can check if you want." He said instead. "Would be kinda weird but if you're worried I don't mind."

"Shut up!" Jason wasn't quite yelling yet but it was close. This whole calming him down thing was not going too well but hey, at least they weren't fighting anymore. "Why the fuck are you even there? I made it clear I don't want to talk to you right now."

By that he meant he had tried to punch him a good dozen time while they were wrestling in front of Marco's. He did manage to hit him a few times but it hadn't been very painful. Peter had tough skin and, without some kind of armor or weapon to make the hits more potent, regular humans generally had a very hard time hurting him.  The rogue had been vicious of course, but he had the advantage of already being in the middle of restraining him when the fight had started and, although that had stopped him from dodging everything that was thrown at him as he usually would, it still made it a lot easier to stop his maybe-friend from doing anything dangerous.

"Well," He spoke slowly, kicking some of the snow on the ground, "honestly, I like working with you. I don't want you to lose the job."

And I promised I'd help you become a vigilante. He didn't speak that last thought. It was generally a bad idea to talk about heroics in public and, if he had indeed been bugged, that could wait until he was done checking his clothes for spyware.

 Jason seemed so surprised by his reply that he didn't speak for close to a minute. When he did, he sounded noticeably shocked, which was very out of character for him. Peter, who was used to his neighbor hiding his emotions and acting outwardly calm and collected, found it a bit disturbing. The anger was bad enough, now he had to deal with the fact it was apparently an incredible surprise for the other vigilante that someone wanted to spend time with him.

"Are you serious? You're worried about me losing my job?"

Maybe he thought it was laughable Peter would be so serious about a part time pizza delivery job. That was also an option and it wouldn't even be too far fetched. Unlike him, the former rogue had money and resources and probably didn't worry too much about having to find shelter if he ever got fired. It was hard to remember that, despite acting like a confident but rebellious teenager, Jason was also filthy rich from dipping into all kinds of unsavory business. 

He tried not to let it get to him. It wasn't like he had told him he came from another universe and had absolutely nothing and no one to rely on. Plus, if being nice kept the anger away, then he just had to go on being disgustingly sweet and pray that would be enough. That was a better plan than giving into his annoyance and starting another wrestling match.

He nodded. "I think you're pretty chill to be around. Most of the time." 

"You think I'm chill. Me."

Peter tilted his head, wondering how relaxed he should pretend to be. He didn't want to be so carefree it looped back around to being annoying.

In the end, he opted to shrug and repeated, simply. "Most of the time."

Truth was, when he wasn't obsessing over the Bats. talking about his criminal past or shooting people, Jason was pretty nice to be around. He was never annoyed when he had to explain something or help out and, until he decided he needed to follow him to his latest arena fight, he had treated him like an equal. He had also bought him food, which was a sure way to any teenager's heart, especially when said teenager was a metahuman with an enhanced metabolism and needed to eat more than the regular human to function.

Jason laughed and, for the first time, he sounded more amused than furious. Distracting him from the source of his anger might be helping, or maybe the thing affecting his emotions was starting to wear off. Nightwing hadn't been very clear on what exactly was causing the outbursts and the irrational anger. Maybe he had wanted to protect his former teammate's privacy but, right now, Peter was finding his secrecy very frustrating. How was he supposed to fix the problem if he didn't have a clue of how it had been caused or of how it usually manifested?

"You're the first person to ever say that about me." The older teen informed him. "You're way too nice, kid."

Another fight breaking out was becoming less and less likely. He fought the urge to sigh in relief and smiled instead. "I'm not being nice. You're pretty alright."

The shadows shifted again and, this time, parted. Jason stepped away from the end of alley, looking incredibly tense but not nearly as angry as he had been a few minutes earlier. This was a rather extreme mood swing, and an important detail. Once he got back to his room, he would have to write down how long that episode had lasted. He still had one unused notebook he could use for this new investigation. There had to be a way to make the unnatural anger stop or to lessen its intensity somehow. If he could help cure his alternate selves' enemies, if he could redesign the Iron Spider and make his own tools, he was able to do this.

The best possible way to start looking into it would be to run physical tests. Unfortunately, he had none of the equipment needed for that and he wouldn't be able to put money towards it for a little bit. He was already planning to order web making supplies with this night's pay. With that done, and hopefully with Jason still willing to help on the sewing side of costume making, Spider-Man should be able to patrol Gotham sooner than he had expected.

"You're a terrible judge of character." Red Hood informed him seriously, standing in front of him, arms crossed. "You really thought Wayne was suspicious?"

For a guy who seemed to hate the billionaire, he was oddly amused at the idea of someone else finding him weird. He was still angry, it was obvious, but his lips were quirking up and he appeared genuinely happy to have been told he wasn't the absolute worse person to be around.

He nodded. "Yeah, and his son was creepy too. I'm pretty sure he tried to stab me."

"Never go into this guy's car again." Jason told him, frowning. "You might have gotten lucky this time but he's extremely dangerous."

Peter nodded again then looked down, deep in thought.

It was incredibly weird how Red Hood was now acting perfectly normal when he had been angry enough to hit walls less than five minutes earlier. Definitely unnatural. He wondered what would have happened if he had not intervened. Would he have stayed in that state? It was clear talking to him didn't break him out of it earlier, not when Wayne had been there and not right after. Was this how the symptoms usually manifested? Did the anger fluctuate in how long it lasted? He itched to put his thoughts down in writing. 

He wished he still had access to the lab equipment he and his other selves had used, that and a sample of blood would have been a great step towards untangling this mess. Maybe he could try to track Nightwing down and ask him for more details? The man did say he wanted them to work together.

They were allies.

Sort of.

"Hey." Jason snapped abruptly, waving a hand in front of his eyes. "I thought you wanted to keep your job. Let's go."

Peter blinked and, once more, realized just how tired he felt.

"Sorry." He mumbled, falling into steps behind his coworker. 

Marco was so surprised to see them walk into the pizzeria together he choked on whatever alcohol he had decided to drink that night. Whisky, maybe, although it was hard to identify the smell. Peter didn't have a lot of experience with liquor, being Spider-Man didn't leave him a lot of time to party. His boss glared at him for a few seconds, apparently not stunned enough that he had forgotten about him wrestling with his coworker right in front of his business. For a moment, it seemed as if they shouldn't have bothered coming back and would be getting fired anyway.

"You two are late." Was the only thing their employer ended up saying, shaking his head and looking disappointed in the both of them.

Jason, being Jason, threw him a dirty look. Considering the revelations Peter was beginning to have about who had raised his maybe-friend, he was starting to understand why he didn't like bowing down to authority figures. He, however, really wanted to keep his apartment so he stepped in before any insult was thrown. He must have done a relatively good job at apologizing since they both ended up being given their usual gear and being shooed away to start on their evening route.

"I can't believe I'm doing this." His coworker told him as they stepped outside, both of them wearing their bulky delivery bag on their back. "You brought fucking Bruce Wayne here and you still convinced me to come deliver pizza with you."

"Not with me." Peter pointed out. "We're splitting, remember?"

"This talk is not over." Jason insisted as he began to free his motorcycle from its habitual layer of chains and locks. "You have to tell me everything he said."

"And I will, tomorrow."

And while they were at it, they could set down a few guidelines, such as 'No shooting other vigilantes'. He didn't think this one simple rule would have to be repeated so much but Parker men attracted trouble wherever they went so, really, he should have expected it.

After watching the bike speed away, he smiled and waved at his boss through one of the front windows and got a very rude hand gesture in reply. Gothamites were such an angry bunch, it would have been endearing if they didn't all insist on carrying a small arsenal with them wherever they went. He just had to deal with it though, at least until his one month was over. Maybe, after that time was done, he would feel ready to go back to New York City. 

Maybe.

He sighed, looked up at the sky.

It had been almost a month, yet he still missed them. 

Well, at least he had avoided getting dragged into another fight. His pizza run shouldn't be too stressful, considering a lot of high ranked gang members had been arrested recently.

It was only when he stepped in front of the GCPD headquarters that he realized he had managed to jinx himself. 

Yeah, Parker luck was definitely still a thing even in an alternate universe.

    the boys need so much therapy istg

    Two things!

    First , I made a tumblr since some people have asked me about it. I haven't been back on this website in forever so my page looks like trash and idk how much I will use it. You can send me questions here. I probably will not reply to DMs due to being asocial so I would prefer asks. If you try to contact me I only ask that you are polite about it and also don't be surprised if I don't reply immediately, I really am not good with social media.
    www.tumblr.com/irisenwrites

    Second, I am doing pseudo NaNoWriMo with my friend and have decided for my project to be finishing this fic. We'll see how that holds up! I can't promise anything but do expect more updates this month.

Chapter Text

Stepping inside a police station the very next day after a massive bust was, in general, a bad idea.

Stepping inside a police station the very next day after a massive bust that involved an illegal fighting rink you competed in was, most definitely, an atrocious idea.

Doing so as a free man, when almost everyone else who wasn't a big wig had been captured and waited transportation directly from said station's cell to the nearest jail was, absolutely and certainly a terrible idea of the worst kind.

Being very aware of how stupid it would be to try and step inside the place this night of all nights, Peter immediately tried to shove the food into the nearest officer's hands and got a few glares as a reward. In a very cold voice, the woman he had tried to dump his responsibilities onto told him she was busy and that he should know better than to try to get in her way. From the look of her, she hadn't gotten much sleep recently and, by the smell of her, the only thing keeping her going was an unreasonable amount of coffee. Between her and Jason, he wondered who was the most sleep deprived.

Gothamites were so weird.

His next attempt at getting rid of the delivery went a bit better but still proved fruitless. The officer he talked to gave him a distracted pat on the back, cracked one of the boxes open, stole a slice and simply walked away without saying a word to him. The older man did not seem in much better health than any of his colleagues. There had been a lot of people at the Pits and it was obvious the department only rarely conducted mass arrests of the sort. He assumed there had to be some differences between his legal system and this one but he couldn't imagine they were done processing everyone. No wonder they ordered pizza.

He threw a pitiful look at the station's entrance, coming to terms with his terrible fate. If he could manage to avoid being seen, he could maybe get out of it without a new reputation as a snitch.

Of course, he was a snitch since he had sold information to Gordon in the past. He was not enough of an idiot to want it spread around, however, and this was by far the busiest he had ever seen the GCPD. Even if Jason hadn't intended to help the Bats in any way when he contacted Nightwing, it was clear his actions had huge consequences throughout the entire underworld. That last fight had been watched mostly by higher ranked members of the mob, and the arrests would likely have left a huge hole in the leadership of the most powerful gangs.

It also forced the police and the justice system to stretch themselves thin. He wondered how much violence would result from this one event and if it would even out with the lives saved.

"What are you standing here for?" A burly officer snapped, shoving past him to head towards one of the many patrol cars parked in front of the headquarters. "Wipe that stupid look off your face."

Peter grimaced but took a few steps forward, still looking around desperately to try and find anyone who did not look as if they would bite his head off if he tried to speak to them. After five minutes and more than a dozen suspicious looks thrown his way, he ended up having to resign himself to his terrible fate. Wishing he had brought one of his few clothes with a hood with him, he slipped into the station, trying his best to look completely innocent and blend in with the people around him.

The entire place was packed with people. The front hall itself buzzed with sound, both from the workers running to and from the deeper half of the building and from a large crowd of civilians that had amassed in front of the three front desks. He flinched at the noise level but still tried to make his way to the unfortunate soul in charge of dealing with visitors. The young man he ended up elbowing his way to looked very happy to see him and plucked one of the boxes from the pile in his arms before telling him to head straight back, pointing at one of the open doors behind him, where he assumed the actual police work happened.

He took one look at the crowd the poor guy had to deal with before sighing and nodding, hoping nobody had described him in too much details.

If he didn't have his Spider Sense and if said sense had not been so quiet, he would have been worried about this being a trap. There was no way he hadn't been described or at least mentioned by the members of the crowd, especially after they saw him beating Bane up. Marco's did not have that many delivery boys and luring one of them to the GCPD was as easy as ordering a few boxes of pizza.

If there was a trap, it would not happen now, he decided. He squared his shoulders and took a deep breath, then stepped out of the crowd. With a bit of luck, most of the criminals taken would not be in this specific station and, if they were, they wouldn't be kept detained so close to the entrance. 

He got a few odd looks as he walked past the desks to enter the restricted part of the headquarters but was eventually let through. A quick pat down revealed the bulky shape in his pocket was not a weapon but Jason's stolen gas mask, causing most of the suspicious glances to turn the other way. It was a lot more advanced than any others Peter had seen in this world and the officer who searched through his jacket and pants clearly thought the same but, still, he was let in.

The room behind the front hall was a lot older looking than he had expected. It was large, impressively so, with an open desk area spanning most of the visible ground floor and an open ceiling that let him look up at several different floors as he walked. The left and right walls led to a dozen offices, all of which were being actively used. The back of the room separated into several other corridors, although it also held a few elevators. He could not see any holding cell which made him sigh in relief. A relief that disappeared relatively fast when he realized the noise level had not gotten any better since he left the front hall. Even this huge space felt cramped that evening. His head was beginning to throb.

Between that and the library, he was starting to suspect Gotham's citizens had a bit of an attachment to traditional architecture and aesthetics. He couldn't complain. As much as he liked swinging between skyscrapers, those did not look very appealing on the inside. There was a certain charm in the dark hard wood that decorated the walls around this central work room and the staircase standing at its heart looked as if it had been plucked out of some history documentary. Even the furniture looked to be excellent quality and worth its weight in gold.

He was surprised. This had to be the most well funded police department he had ever seen. 

"You!" Someone called behind him. "What the hell are you doing-"

He turned as fast as he could, holding the boxes in front of him like a shield. The woman who had called out to him closed her mouth and raised an eyebrow. She looked just as tired as everyone else but, unlike the other officers he had met so far, she calmed down pretty fast once she saw he was carrying food with him.

"Ah. You're the pizza guy. Awesome."

He handed the food over wordlessly, accepting the two ten dollar bills she gave him in exchange. Unfortunately, she did not dismiss him right away, choosing instead to look inside the boxes, maybe to make sure he hadn't poisoned them on the way there. People in Gotham were like that, and this wasn't the first time he had seen someone act this way. He waited as patiently as he could, glancing around and noticing with a sinking heart that one or two detectives were looking at him with obvious mistrust. 

Not everyone here was aware of who he was, then, but those who were definitely did not trust him. He tried to smile in their direction but, to his disappointment, that only made their glares more intense.

"Pizza is here!" The woman eventually cried out, once she decided she was not at risk of being poisoned. "Stay here for a sec." She added in a softer tone, pinning him down with a stern look.

His neck still was not tingling so he stepped back and let a ravenous horde of overworked officers rush past him. As soon as the food had been cleared, the area had instantly turned into a free for all, with quite a few feet being trampled. He grimaced in sympathy after seeing a skinny detective being rudely pushed away from the slice he was trying to grab. Not the most disciplined bunch but he couldn't blame them, there was not a single person in this room who did not look as if they were dead on their feet.

He heard someone step close behind him and turned his head. The female officer -no... lieutenant, she was a lieutenant- looked down at him. She was still holding a box in her hands, which she held out, visibly expecting him to take it back.

"Erm." He said, rather eloquently.

"We have a guy on signal duty." She explained. "I'll give you an extra twenty to take that up to him."

Well if that wasn't code for "we need to talk to you", he would eat his own mask.

If he had a mask to eat, of course.

He considered the odds of this being an ambush but his Spider Sense was still absent. He rubbed the back of his neck out of habit and nodded. A twenty dollar tip was already pretty generous but he couldn't resist the opportunity to double it. The roof would be away from prying eyes and he was beginning to hope he could make some extra cash by sharing info. He definitely did not want to be on the GCPD's bad side, not if he wanted to have a future as a civilian, plus he had continued to visit the Pits mostly to get information on the underworld.

He remembered the face of every single person in that VIP arena. Some of that knowledge had to be useful to someone and, so far, Gordon had struck him as a pretty ok guy. He doubted the commissioner would be there to talk to him in person, considering the state of the station, but he hoped whoever he had tasked with meeting him could be trusted. And he hoped that they would be as generous as the old man had been. A few hundred bucks looked very nice from where he was standing.

"You can take the outside stairs." The lieutenant informed him. He pocketed the rest of his tip and smiled, feeling slightly nauseous. Giving information to the police was turning out to be a lot more stressful than he had expected it to be. He couldn't stop thinking about how his very suspicious and definitely very criminal neighbors would react if they knew he was making extra cash selling intel.

He slipped through the side door she had pointed out to him and, as soon as he stepped outside, took a few seconds to breathe in and enjoy the relative quiet.

Almost everyone he could see in the streets around the station was either a police officer, a member of the press or some kind of legal worker. A few civilians, maybe family members of some of the arrested gang members, flitted around anxiously, the majority of them on their phones. The crowd sticked to the front of the headquarters, thankfully. Most of the people around him were on their smoke breaks or having a discreet mental breakdown next to the dumpsters. He could relate to that feeling very well.

The stairway leading to the roof was guarded by a couple bored looking officers who only let him through after he had bribed them with a slice of pizza each. He walked as quickly as he could up to the roof. He was in the shadows but he was also the only person on this staircase. The least eyes on him, the better he would feel. Nobody looked to be paying much attention but still, his skin crawled.

The roof he stepped onto was empty except for two people. He took note of their location immediately, listening intently. One man, a bit more than middle aged, standing fifteen feet in front of him, slightly to the left, past a bulky air vent and a few stone reliefs. One woman, around his age, light on her feet and absolutely impossible to detect for someone without enhanced senses. Even with his powers, he seriously doubted he could have spotted even just a few weeks earlier. He had made leaps and bounds in his ability to feel the world around him, so much so that he found it a bit worrying.

"Kid." Gordon greeted him. "I have to say, you have some balls on you."

Peter faltered halfway out of the shadows, stopping before he fully left the cover of the stone relief separating the two of them. The commissioner glanced at him, a half smoked cigarette in his hand and an odd look on his face. The teen thought it was a mix of suspicion and curiosity, but he wasn't sure. Like a lot of the adults he had met around Gotham, the man did not let most of his emotions show on his face. If he was considering dragging him back inside and trying to lock him up, there was no sign of it.

The hidden woman shuffled closer, her steps perfectly silent. She was about twenty feet away on their left, up on a higher part of the roof, which had to be some kind of access to the station. She was not triggering any kind of reaction from his sixth sense so he chose to ignore her for now.

"Hello." He said with all the confidence of a man who was regretting every single choice that had led him to this point. "Long time no see."

He could have been more polite, he could have been more careful but, at this point, he was feeling too tired to care. He had just lived through the most stressful walk he had ever taken, had fought Jason in front of his place of work, had gotten harassed by a billionaire and his creepy son and had disappointed the first person he'd properly met in this universe. He could not find it in him to care about watching his tongue, especially since Gordon himself did not look like he gave much of a damn either.

Much like all the other officers he had seen in the building, the man appeared not to have seen his bed in a pretty long time. He was starting to feel good about his own sleep deprivation, and he hadn't gotten more than five hours of rest in the past two days.

"Some balls indeed." Gordon repeated, glancing to the side at what looked like the oddest version of a stage light he had ever seen. It was uncovered, with a thick piece of cloth bulked up around its base. Since it was still unlit, Peter wondered if he was the reason behind the bat-signal having been prepped for use.

He had read about it online but it was still interesting to see it in person. Not many people had that privilege, he suspected. Gordon working with a vigilante was well known, mostly because of the light show that went off whenever an extreme emergency struck Gotham. Despite its infamy, it was used sparingly, and only in the most dire of situations. It was as much a call for help than it was a warning for the population to hide out and be ready to defend themselves until someone else could afford to save them. The hero forums, social media and articles he had read had conveyed that impression to him at least.

He tore his eyes away from the piece of equipment and looked over at the commissioner.

"Pizza for you." He said, with his best winning smile.

Peter thought his customer service voice had gotten pretty decent over a couple weeks of delivering food to very unstable and very well armed people. Gordon did not look amused. He still took the box, though, so that was a win.

"I have heard a lot of interesting things about you." The man said after setting the food down on a nearby stone gargoyle. "I assume you also have a lot of interesting things to tell me."

The other stranger had not moved from the spot she had been in earlier. He could smell metal on her. Weapons, but no gun. Sone kind of blade, then. He resisted the urge to look in her direction, not wanting to make himself seem too threatening. Was he losing his Spider Sense again? He was beginning to doubt he was completely safe, with how close she had gotten to them. 

She could be a fellow police woman, although he had never met one who was able to be so silent. The only other possibilities he could see would be an elite agent, either working for a rich criminal or for the GCPD, or one of the Bats. The last option seemed the most likely. If they collaborated regularly, he could see the vigilantes tagging along with the commissioner for his first time alone with him after the Pits disaster. He had not made a very good impression on them, and the opposite could be said as well. The only one he trusted not to attack him was Nightwing.

Wasn't he supposed to keep them away? Sure, this wasn't interfering with his actual life and he probably wasn't supposed to be spotting anyone, but spying on him crossed a bit of a line. And now he would have to lose the vigilantes if they decided to track him after his shift. Not the best way to end his night.

"Maybe we should go inside." He offered, trying his best to look innocent. He would rather risk being seen by more people than have to deal with another chase.

"Don't worry kid." To his surprise, Gordon looked up and straight at the person in the shadows, who was still watching over them. The chief was a lot more honest than he expected. "Anyone here is someone I trust."

That meant he would be telling them everything that was said anyway. Lovely. Between protecting the identity of active criminals and having the Bats get involved in his business again, he picked the second option.

"I'll hold you to it." He replied, walking to stand a little closer.

"I heard you had fun with Bane." The policeman turned to lean against the bat signal. The thing was so large it held his weight without any reaction. "He talked about you for a while, I think you made an impression."

That was about the last thing he wanted to hear and he made that quite clear. Gordon smiled at his look of dismay. It was a hard smile, full of dark humor.

He was not being treated like an innocent, naive outsider anymore.

But he was still invited to share intel. He wasn't so much of a risk that they wanted him off the streets. Not yet. There must be a lot of other informants like him, who were considered as both assets and potential threats. The chief was careful to order food when the station and the streets were busy, and had gone as far as getting one of his allies to back him up. 

A familiar zipping sound made him freeze for a second. It would have been too quiet to be heard by anyone else, and it had been covered by the sound of a squad car starting up, but he had been running into grappling guns too often not to recognize it. Gordon had not just called one of his allies, he considered him dangerous enough to have two of them as back up. Well, at least the tool was confirmation enough that he was dealing with the Bats, and not any other party.

The newcomer was male, older than him but not by much. He felt familiar.

He focused back on the commissioner.

"I wouldn't call that fun. It was more painful than fun."

"That is not how I had it described to me."

Peter glared at him for a few seconds before he caught himself and hid his annoyance. Having to break the bones of a downed opponent because he was so doped up he didn't feel pain and kept attacking him had been horrible enough that he had barely slept since it happened. What kind of guy did the GCPD think he was? He couldn't see how he could have ever enjoyed that situation. Gordon watched him attentively, perfectly calm and almost finished with his smoke. He looked in his element. In all likelihood, he was.

He missed his webs. After a point, even his strongest opponents could get weak enough that he was able to restrain them, as long as he had enough fluid. He had taken his shooters along this time. Without having to worry about being randomly led to a fighting rink liable to confiscate his weapons, he had no reason not to slip them on before he headed out. He only had a few swings left in them, however, and wrapping Gordon up for being annoying would empty the tanks.

He smiled politely. "Is this all you need, sir?"

The second Bat was even quieter than the first, settling next to her with only his heartbeat telling Peter he was there. He hoped it was Nightwing. As weird as it would be to run into him so frequently, he was the least likely to lead a chase. He really needed to get some sleep and half an hour running from suspicious vigilantes was just as much precious rest he could have caught up on.

Please be Nightwing.

"Did you get to talk to him?"

Blunt. The commissioner was a direct man, then. The way he acted now seemed truer to himself than it had been before. He wondered just how bad of a reputation he had gathered with him and his allies that he was now deemed worthy of not being treated with kiddie gloves on.

"Yeah." He glanced up at the spot Gordon had stared at earlier, now feeling it was safe to do so. He couldn't see anyone up there, the two spies were perfectly melting into the shadows. They knew the roof very well; unsurprising, considering their allegiances. How much did he want them to know? Did he even want to try and hide anything? They were not friends and he knew they would gladly catch and interrogate him if they had the opportunity. Still, they were fighting for the same thing. Jason would have told them to fuck off. 

He was not Jason.

The chief must have taken his hesitation for distrust, and perhaps it was. Still without a word, he took several bills out of his pocket. A few hundred dollars.

He looked at the money, feeling annoyed he was even planning on accepting it. He didn't know how long he would be able to keep his delivery job, and he had to get a safety net as soon as possible. He trusted that he would have trickled that information back to Gordon anyway, at least as long as he thought it could help someone. Even without a bribe he would have told him what he knew. No matter, his own emotions annoyed him.

He shouldn't be feeling relieved to get his hands on some cash, yet he was. He hated what it meant about him.

"I met him in the locker room." He began, "You have to get changed to fight there."

"I see." Gordon narrowed his eyes. It might not have been the best idea to remind him just how involved in the arena he had been.

The Bats both moved, only a twitch. It didn't produce any sound, but somehow he could feel it.

If this was what happened to him when he was too sleep deprived to function, he did not want to repeat the experience. The hyper enhanced hearing did help him spot anyone not included in his Spider Sense, but it was also very distracting, and it made his head hurt like hell.

"He was very talkative. And he injected himself with uh-"

In his current state the only way he could think to describe the liquid would be to call it green goo. He did not imagine Gordon would react well to that wording. He was already pretty tense, now that he had been reminded the kid in front of him had broken the entire body of a man twice his size.

"Venom." The chief said, dropping the butt of his cigarette into a nearby ashtray. "He did it in front of you."

"Yeah." He played back his memory, revisiting the moment he had seen the needle go in, "He was pretty weird about it. Did it very slowly, and talked about control. Control and power."

Seeing as Gordon still didn't seem to want to interrupt him, and the Bats were listening in attentively, he kept on talking.

"He said he was not a slave to it. The venom. I think that's what he meant." He focused, remembering every detail. He was tired but his memory had always been near perfect. "He said he wanted to refine his hm... arsenal."

He went back further, to the start of their meeting.

"He called the arena Penguin's bucket, said the people there were crabs." He noticed the commissioner twitch at the mention of the name. Penguin was infamous for slithering his way out of any long term sentences, and even an outsider like him knew the police was desperate to pin the man. "I saw him." He said, "Cobblepot."

Gordon's only reaction was to narrow his eyes slightly, and only for a fraction of a second. Peter caught onto the micro expression but let nothing on, still talking, still remembering.

"Bane was very talkative," He was repeating himself again, he had to be more precise. "He said he had fought several people already. They weren't much of a challenge. He was interested in me, because I'm a-"

He closed his mouth abruptly, fighting the urge to look away. The commissioner only looked mildly interested, keeping a perfect poker face on. He missed New York. Everyone was so hard to read in Gotham.

"He said he wanted to test his steel. I think he meant the venom. It smelled like poison."

Another part of the memory came back and he spoke a bit faster. "He mentioned a name. Said they had the core of it right. That it was an interesting formula. But it needed to be refined."

"A name." Half a dozen more bills joined those already in Gordon's hand. Peter despised how dry his throat got when he saw them.

He looked away, trying to find an answer. A name... 

"Someone named Ace." He spoke at the same time he remembered it, not missing a tiny muscle twitch next the commissioner's mouth. Tightening. He recognized the person, then.

The Bats did not give much of a reaction, at least not one he could feel. He wondered if he had said enough and, not confident he had, added: "He lost his temper very fast. I noticed that."

"You notice a lot." Gordon's eyes were not any softer, but at least talking to him appeared to have made him less of a threat. He could not define what was different about him, only that something in his demeanor had softened. "Anything else you noticed? We heard there were others on the scene."

Others they did not catch.

He tried to picture the faces he had memorized over his time fighting in the cage. He remembered everyone in the VIP sessions for the three times he had been there, and he described them the best he could. Most of them did not cause any reaction but one of the Bats had a significant heart rate spike when an old man with a piercing gaze and an odd two-toned body suit was mentioned. That one must have been dangerous. He couldn't see why one old dude would be more threatening to them than Ivy or any of the others who had watched his fights but he filed the information away for later.

"How about a man with a red helmet?" Gordon asked suddenly, opening the forgotten box and taking a slice of pizza, which must have become cold by then.

Peter frowned.

Red Hood was a dangerous criminal. No matter how much Jason wanted to become a vigilante, and he was not sure he wanted it very much, he was still a former budding crime lord. He had not been the worst person to lead a gang in Gotham, but he had still committed several atrocities. How much of that had been from him, and how much from the anger he felt, he had no idea. He would not be able to tell until he had found a way to cure him. He thought what mattered was that the man wanted to get away from that past and protect people again. This was what May would have wanted him to do. She thought it was good that he-

It caused her death.

She thought he had made the right choice.

And he had given himself a month to see if she had been right, if he had been right.

It caused her death.

"Never heard of him." He lied, knowing very well Gordon had gotten enough info out of his allies to call him out on it.

The man did nothing of the sort. He simply finished the food in his hand and wiped it on the side of the gargoyle he stood next to. Still with a perfect poker face, he reached towards him. The moonlight caught on the bills he held. There must be at least five hundred dollars in there, enough to buy food, get web supplies and start on working on some of other projects. The boy grabbed them, his heart pounding, and hid them in the inside of his jacket as fast as he could.

"Next time," Peter said, once he had gotten over the feeling of being financially secure, "Let's meet somewhere else."

Annoyingly, this caused Gordon to crack up. The man laughed out loud, smiling genuinely for the first time since he had met him. That simple act changed his face completely, going from the stern, threatening commissioner to a kind older man. He looked so familiar in that moment, and something tugged at his sleep deprived mind, a detail he knew he should not be missing. He was too tired to worry now and pushed it aside, running a finger inside his jacket and feeling the shape of the money hidden there.

"You're starting to wise up." The policeman grinned. "For a second I forgot you're just a kid from New York."

Peter glared at him, not bothering to hide it this time. This version of the man was more genuine but he was also too honest. He didn't need to be reminded Gothamites considered outsiders as barely more competent than babies, Jason and Marco did it often enough.

"Just do it. I'm not coming here again."

The only reply he got was another laugh and he ended up turning on his heels with a sigh. People were becoming annoying to talk to. If they kept on not sleeping, he might have to start knocking them all out, for his own sanity.

He looked up again. The Bats were still there. He wondered if he should bother them, considered the risks, then shrugged and jumped up. If anything, he was confident he could lose them and, with his gas mask, he had little to fear.

He was fast enough to land behind the two vigilantes before they could scatter. Still, they moved immediately. The bigger one, who was indeed Nightwing, took out two short sticks, holding them out in front of him. He smelled of exhaustion and surprise, but other than that seemed in good health, no different than when he had seen him earlier that day. The smaller one, who did look like a woman, smaller than him and dressed completely in black, reached to her belt with one of her hands, widening her stance. 

Remind them you are strong, but be nice enough they won't take it as a threat.

"Hey guys." He ignored Gordon taking out his gun a few feet below. Things like this were better kept for when his Spider Sense started to tingle. If he had indeed lost his power again, he would just go with his gut. "Just wanted to say I've got nothing against you. Sorry about the other night."

They stared at him expressionlessly, their creepy appearance made worse by their shining eye lenses. They were truly the only group of people able to beat out that Damian kid in the eeriness department. Didn't help that they sometimes dragged a literal child along with them. He still was not over the realization that Robin did not look old enough to be attending middle school. At least the boy was nowhere to be seen. Maybe they were being reasonable about it and only brought him out when their mission was safe and simple.

Yeah. As if. He was probably giving them too much credit. 

"You are very polite for a criminal." The smaller vigilante informed him, keeping her hand on her belt. She had slipped something out of it, a throwing star of some kind. No guns, but they were perfectly alright hurtling knives at people. 

"Hopefully not a criminal anymore." He smiled, doing his best impression of a perfectly innocent teenager. It did not work. "Gonna go to college and all that."

One day, he would. Ben and Tony wanted him to and he also had aspirations of his own.

Despite his best attempts at looking nice and friendly, the young woman did not reply, shifting her stance again and raising one of her weapons. Nightwing ended up being the one talking for the both of them, seemingly torn between annoyed and amused. 

"We have other things to do than chase you tonight." Below them, Gordon started. The girl turned to look at her partner, her emotions impossible to read. "Just go and don't get into any more trouble." The older vigilante shooed him away, his batons already back into the sheath attached to his bodysuit. "Seriously. Stay off the streets. For your own good."

Taking it as a dismissal, Peter waved at them, still going for pure innocence, and turned away. He used the shadow of a cloud to jump to the next building over, clearing a gap wide enough to fit half a dozen cars. He heard the Bats stand but, true to their word, they did not follow him as he ran back to the restaurant. Going through with meeting Gordon might not have been one of his best decisions but it was done, and he had officially met another one of the vigilantes too.

At least he had learned something. That Penguin was wanted by the GCPD was old news, according to the forums and videos he'd consumed. But they had reacted to the name Ace and, if he could figure out who that was, he could-

Do what? Bane was already in custody, What point would there be in investigating it, if his supply of venom had already been seized? Why would the GCPD even care?

Maybe Gordon was afraid of the drug getting out to other criminals and wanted to cut the supply before it became a risk.

But... Ace's drug wasn't venom. Bane had said it needed to be refined.

So it had been something else, something he had mixed in with his usual cocktail.

Something potent, going by his reaction.

A strength enhancer?

Muscle growth?

He remembered a man, a twisted, deformed thing, twitching in the snow dying.

Another drug.

It could be.

The Bats would be looking into it. He wanted to stay away from them, at least when Nightwing wasn't there. Jason hated them, couldn't be trusted when they were around.

But he had promised himself he would be getting to the bottom of this incident. In the memory of the man he had watched die.

He was feeling extremely conflicted when he entered the pizzeria, and his mental state did not get any better when his boss greeted him with, of all things, a very cheerful:

"How much did he pay you?"

He bit back another sigh and looked as neutral as he could.

"Who?"

Marco grinned.

"Decent. But you could get a bit more from acting angry. Something a bit like..."

He tilted his head back. His breath smelled of alcohol. He straightened up abruptly, his face showing nothing but cold, intense anger.

"What kind of guy do you think I am?" His boss asked in a low, threatening voice. He was genuinely intimidating, despite the fact he was drunk. His frown relaxed as suddenly as it had formed and he smiled. "Remind them they should be scared of ya." He laughed and drained his glass, filling it back up shortly after.

Peter stared at him silently. Eventually, he found enough energy to reply, although he couldn't help how exhausted he knew he sounded.

"We're delivering to another place next time."

To his great frustration, Marco, much like Gordon, found that statement hilarious.

"So you are learning something."

Everyone in this city was unhinged and very annoying. He couldn't wait to be back in his apartment. His bed, at least, was more reasonable than these people.
Notes:

    Peter, with an average of two and a half hours of sleep a night, has the healthiest sleep schedule right now.
    Maybe the Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms tag was the friend we made along the way. LOL

Chapter Text

"You're early."

Jason was wrong but, considering the guy looked like he had been recently revived from the dead and had eyebags big enough to be confused for black eyes, Peter refrained from correcting him. He was feeling in a much better mood that morning, and it had everything to do with the ten hours of deep sleep he'd just woken up from. Turned out there was a limit to how many nightmares he could get and, once he was exhausted enough, he just stopped dreaming entirely. He didn't question it. It was nice to have the universe be kind to him for once.

"You look like a raccoon." He hid his concern behind a smile. "Do you like, never sleep?"

To his surprise, his neighbor replied with a smirk of his own. "A bit rich, coming from a stick like you. What kinda food do you even eat?"

The younger boy shuddered. "Ramen." Barely seasoned, poorly prepared ramen. Even thinking about the stuff made him want to vomit. With everything that had happened recently, he had little time or inclination to go grocery shopping and, unfortunately, he couldn't survive purely off of Marco's leftovers. His second hand appliances had gone unused ever since he bought them, which was a shame. He really had been looking forward to cooking himself a meal. He hadn't expected how little time he would have for himself. This week had been an absolute disaster.

So yeah, he had lost a little bit of weight, but it really wasn't as bad as Jason's zombie face. Human skin was not supposed to be this pale, especially not on someone who was naturally tan.

"Only ramen?" The former rogue shook his head, looking worried. "Diet is important."

Peter rolled his eyes. "Sure. So is sleep, by the way. Are you gonna let me in?"

He had to suffer another round of concerned glances before his neighbor finally moved away from his door and let him step through. Their apartments being less than ten feet away from each other made it very easy to meet up. He never had one of his friends live this close to him before. Even with his powers, it usually took him ten or fifteen minutes to get to Ned's and MJ's was even further away. He hoped they could keep on being coworkers for a little bit longer, he liked being able to talk to someone his age.

He looked around, trying not to make his curiosity obvious. Jason's place was supposedly the same size and model as his, but it appeared a bit smaller. It was a lot tidier, but had more furniture and items crammed in it, as well as a few curtains, which gave the illusion of a cramped space. There was no bed, not even a mattress, but Peter did notice a couch in somewhat decent shape, with a TV placed in front of it. A gas stove and a small fridge completed the rather simple living area, but even that was organized perfectly. 

The second half of the apartment, the one next to the entrance, was more unusual. It consisted of a mix of workout gear, shelves packed with crates and boxes, and three workbenches. The closest of those was covered in small tools and robotics equipment, one other had weapon cases strewn around it and the last held the horrifying machine Jason had dubbed his Craft-It-All. A mannequin stood in front of it, with what looked like a bodysuit wrapped around its fake torso.

His mouth fell open as soon as he spotted it. 

It was still barebones but there was no way he wouldn't recognize his own design. 

His teammate had already started working on the spider suit. Good. He was only a few days away from being done with scrapping the Iron Spider and the sooner he began working on implementing the technology into another suit, the more powerful he could make it. Still, he hadn't expected it to be this far along, or for Jason to have put so much effort in making it. The first layer of the outfit was almost finished, and he could see the start of the second layer neatly folded next to the demonic sewing machine. It had only been a few days, and he knew it would have taken him at least a week to get the same results. Maybe he had just discovered the reason behind his neighbor's chronic lack of sleep.

"I guess I'm gonna make us some food." Jason sighed, closing and locking the door. "Might as well, we'll be there for a while."

"You think?" Peter walked up to the mannequin, bending closer to look at the finer details.

He tried to memorize how everything looked. Between his memory and his enhanced fine motor control, he generally needed very little practice before he could replicate a pattern. This was definitely higher quality than what he would have pulled off without any help, but it wasn't so far out of his skill level that he wouldn't be able to copy it. He would need to upgrade his own sewing machine to something more appropriate to work with the tougher materials, but he figured he could manage a passable imitation.

He, however, would not be getting carried away and ending up making another monstrosity to rival the Craft-It-All, no sir he wouldn't. He was a reasonable young man, and if he was starting to feel a little bit competitive at the idea, well there was nothing wrong with day dreaming.

Unaware of the fact his new teammate had started drafting up mental plans to build a machine to surpass his own, Jason took his stove out and set it on the table between the couch and the TV. He had a box of eggs and a stick of butter in his hands and, despite his many issues, looked a lot more competent at this whole adulting thing than Peter had ever felt. Of course, he was older and, going by his relationship with the Bats, he had to have been living on his own for a few months at least, perhaps more. It made sense he'd know a lot more about being independent.

The man noticed him staring and took the opportunity to speak, not even looking as he dropped generous chunk of butter into the pan and prepared their breakfast.

"I want to know every detail of your little trip with Wayne." He sounded just as serious as he had been earlier, as if it was normal for a teenager like him to try and fight with one of the richest men in this world.

"The guy is that bad, uh?"

Peter turned away and glanced at the workbenches, feeling a familiar itch, not on the back of his neck but in his mind. He hadn't expected so many shiny tools to just be laying there. It was incredibly tempting to go and take a closer look at them.

The first desk he had noticed, with all the robotics and fun looking toys, monopolized his attention enough that he missed Jason's answer. He couldn't identify all of the equipment on it, but one of them looked very familiar. It was vaguely gun shaped but too bulky to be an useful firearm. He picked it up absently, noticing the slight damage on its side. Part of its plating had been dislodged by a hit or a shot of some kind. He dismantled it easily, noticing some of the inner mechanisms had been pushed out of place by whatever had impacted them. Ah. So it was one of those. He didn't think his teammate actually had one. He hadn't seen him use it before, but if he had been trained by the Bats, he would know how to move with this.

"Nice grappling gun." He complimented, still distracted and only vaguely noticing Jason's head shooting up in alarm.

The man might be worried about some of the more dangerous parts hurting him while he tinkered, but Peter was careful. He was long past sticking his finger into springs or wires. Those had destroyed his skin more time than he could count, and he was getting tired of his hands turning into shredded meat. There were plenty of expensive looking tools around the apartment. He figured using them was better than giving the floor a new paint job. Red was his partner's favorite color, but blood was oh so difficult to clean for someone on a budget.

"What the fuck are you doing?" Red Hood narrowed his eyes, still stirring and making sure his eggs didn't stick to the pan.

"Fixing it. You already have everything out anyway."

He carefully replaced some of the more damaged mechanisms with the spare parts Jason had prepared. The older vigilante had been pessimistic and overshot with the amount he took out. Some of what he had intended to put in that grappling gun was unnecessary, and would risk making it slower and heavier. Peter's hands moved almost on their own, adjusting and tweaking its insides until he felt satisfied. By the time he was done, he had a plate of freshly cooked eggs in front of him. 

He blinked. Uh. He hadn't even noticed the food was ready. He reached for it immediately. He felt hungry constantly, but most of the time he ignored it, pushed it to the back of his mind until it was a low, dull buzz. That technique didn't work so well whenever he was handed anything that wasn't unseasoned ramen.

Ugh. And he used to love noodles too.

"What the hell did you do?" His coworker turned the grappling gun in his hands, then poked at the damaged parts on his workbench. "Why did you take all of that out?"

"You didn't need everything." Peter shrugged, digging into his food eagerly. "Funny tool you got, looks very familiar."

By that he meant it looked almost identical to some of the gear he had seen the Bats using. It would be hard to compare them from a distance but, once he got his hands of it, he could see a clear resemblance. Going by its inner workings, the gun had around the same range, pulling strength and strain resistance as the grappling tech he had seen used by the other vigilantes. He hoped it hadn't been stolen, although that wouldn't have been much of a surprise, and would have been a lot easier to sneak out of the Bats' headquarters than a motorcycle.

"I don't use it that much." Jason frowned down at the tool, gauging its weight for the third time since Peter had finished messing with it. "It's lighter. Did you really just take shit out?"

It was his turn to roll his eyes for once. "Obviously I also moved some parts around." The eggs were pretty good and he hadn't tasted butter in forever so it was a bit hard to focus on anything other than his tastebuds. A little bit of seasoning went a long way, he really should invest on replacing his dwindling stash of salt and spices. "I told you making stuff like this is my thing."

"You said you were good at robotics." Jason flipped the grappling gun to his other hand. "This is a bit different." He mimicked shooting it at the ceiling, then twirled it dramatically.

"Robotics, engineering, whatever." Peter waved his hand, feeling a bit embarrassed. He was used to being around people like Ned and MJ, who had long grown used to his ability to pick up new skills. "Honestly, there's a lot I still need to learn. Physics, for example. I'm pretty decent at it but I barely understand some of the more advanced stuff. Biology is another one."

If he focused on them, he could likely master both topics in a few years, but that wasn't particularly unique. Being mentored by Tony Stark had taught him early on he was far from the only technologically gifted person in the world. 

"You really are something. How the fuck did you not get poached, again?"

The guy who saw my potential died and then everything went to shit for a bit, he thought.

"It's not anything special." He said. "I mean, look at your stuff, you built most of it, right?"

Jason followed his gaze to the workbenches and the various projects on them. "Sure, I did." He admitted, although he still looked at Peter with an odd expression. "But I was taught how to do that."

And there it was, his connection to the Bats. He didn't seem to hide it much anymore, not after their last encounter with the group. He still hadn't said anything directly but what he was implying was as close to a confession as one could get. The tools weren't similar simply because he had taken to stealing them from Wayne Tech and Batman got his designs from them. He had learned directly from the source how to make his own gear.

Another hint towards them being connected. Wayne, the mysterious foster father and the former urban legend. All three could be the same person. The pieces fit.

Until he found some type of evidence, he couldn't prove it but he was starting to believe it all the same. His instincts were rarely wrong, even without his Spider Sense.

Hm. His friend looked like he was in a good mood, and they were here to talk. Might as well ask him.

"So how old were you, anyway?" He said, finishing his plate and handing it over to Jason, who had replaced the stove with a bright red plastic basin.

He got an unimpressed look in answer so he figured he needed to be a bit more blunt. After making sure the room was secure (which earned him another annoyed glance because of course Jason had checked his apartment hadn't been bugged), he tried again.

"How old were you when you became a vigilante?" Just to make sure he would get an answer this time, and at the risk of being too forward, he added: "As young as Robin?"

His neighbor's head snapped up so fast he wondered if the man had any latent metahuman abilities. They stared at each other in silence, the only sound coming from the wind outside and the droplets of water falling from the older teen's hands. It was cold in their apartments, a roof wasn't much protection from the weather when it was so extreme. Peter tugged on the straps of his sweatshirt, suddenly nervous. He had been sure he had read the situation correctly but, if he was mistaken, his words could be taken as an insult. 

"You figured it out, then." Jason said, his voice as blank as his face. "Fuck."

He had gone completely still, one hand holding his half cleaned plate and the other still in the middle of dipping a sponge into soapy water. Peter felt a bit bad for him, but was also extremely relieved. He had been right. He hadn't offended his partner. His hands relaxed and he let go of his shirt. You still got it Parker, at least your brain isn't completely broken.

"It was a bit obvious."

He grimaced when his attempt at making it seem like not that big of an issue made Jason's calm mask crack. His friend looked upset and there was an odd glow to his eyes, an edge of panic. Not the right thing to say. He had to fix it, fast. He tried to smile.

"But only because I saw you with them. I heard you talk to Nightwing at the Pits, and I also saw you two together. Back before we officially met, I got you guys pizza."

The panic turned to anger and the black-haired teen resumed scrubbing the dishes, almost breaking one of them in the process. "That was before that dickhead decided to become an ass licker." He glared at Peter. "Can't be the only thing, spit it out."

Not wanting to have a repeat of the previous night, the younger boy complied, standing up and moving closer to lean on the side of the couch.

"It's the way you talk about them," he explained, "like you know them." Another glare forced him to add: "Of course I know you don't like them, but that was a bit of a clue too. You feel really strongly about them."

About one of them specifically. The leader of the vigilantes was the target of most of the animosity Jason held for the Bats. The Red Robin guy couldn't be far behind, though, considering what had happened when they last met. Shooting someone was worse than talking about them behind their backs. Of course, he didn't doubt Batman would also have ended up with a bullet in the chest if he hadn't managed to block or dodge every single one that had come his way.

"That's putting it mildly." The rogue paused, leaving the dishes half finished, and wiped his hands on his pants. "Fuck. I need a smoke. Do you mind?"

Peter shook his head and waited for the other teen to open the window and roll a cigarette before he talked again.

"I think the only way to figure it out is to spend a lot of time with you." He shrugged. "And also to be unlucky enough to attract the Bats a lot."

"And you are very good at attracting attention." Jason growled, tense and annoyed. Taking a first hit of nicotine seemed to relax him slightly, which wasn't the healthiest but still better than them fighting again. "Do you do it on purpose?"

"I just have bad luck." He admitted, moving to sit on the back of the couch. He wanted to reach up for the ceiling and pace around, a habit he often indulged when he was on his own. "Stuff happens to me all the time. It's like the universe hates me."

His coworker snarled. "No, you go looking for it. Don't tell me a normal guy in your position would have gone off to that little fiesta with the plant bitch." The tobacco didn't take all of the edge out of Red Hood's voice but he was nowhere near the state he had been in the previous night. Small victories were still victories.

Peter figured the guy was right, sort of. "Yeah, I guess I do look for trouble."

They were both lost in thought.

He didn't want to push his friend too hard, not so soon after one of his episodes. He didn't know enough about them, had no idea if they left lingering symptoms or if they completely vanished after he calmed down. Better safe than sorry. He tried to give himself some time by looking up. The roof was sloped and had several visible wood beams crossing across it, more so than in his own room. He noticed a punching bag attached to one of them, with a mechanism to lower it dangling a couple feet off the ground. He was really itching to get up there. Gravity was overrated.

"So." Jason breathed out a cloud of mist and smoke, his voice back to normal and his heart steady. A few snowflakes fell from the open window to land on his hair and shirt. He ignored them. "Wayne. The fuck did he do to you?"

I could say the same thing. Peter bit back the thought, leaning further back, to an angle that would have been uncomfortable for a regular human. On his own, he often forgot that his sense of balance was just as enhanced as his strength or speed.

"Well, I met him when I went to the library." He recalled, casting another longing glance at the ceiling. "But I met his son first. Creepy little guy."

Wait.

If Wayne was connected to Batman, despite how ridiculous it seemed, Damian might be involved in vigilantism as well. He remembered his first and only meeting with the current Robin and how shocked he had been to see he was only a kid. The two boys were around the same age and they had the same build. He shivered at the thought of that unhinged goblin being let loose in Gotham. For his sanity, he really hoped his theory was nothing more than a weird conspiracy. He could already picture himself being stalked by a masked version of the child, who had been a tad too interested in him.

If he's part of it, he must have been gathering information. He might not care that much about me.

Damn it, that was another point towards the Wayne family and the vigilante team being one and the same. He leaned back even more, reaching up to cover his face with his hands. For once, he wanted his instincts to be wrong.

"Of course the brat is creepy," Jason nodded with a smile, "he's his son."

He was very confident for a man who might have been raised by the same person he made fun of. There was something Peter could have said about rocks and glass houses but he managed not to blurt it out. Nice one, Parker. Look at you not being overly impulsive. Instead, he kept the peace by diligently recalling the previous afternoon.

"I was making an account to get some books, so the kid followed me to the front desk. I guess Wayne thought he got lost and I brought him back to the entrance. He said he wanted to thank me and help me get to work. I was late." The ceiling would have been fun to walk on. It was so sad he had to act like a regular, functional, human being.

"And you just said yes?" His friend was almost done smoking and looked at him with immense pity in his eyes. Typical Gotham behavior. Whenever they thought an outsider was being naive, Gothamites would get that expression on their face. Peter had become very familiar with it over the weeks.

"I mean, his son was there. He also acted pretty nice." That didn't help his situation. If anything, his coworker looked even more astonished. "Not the son. Wayne. He was acting alright. He drives like an insane person, though. I can't believe he did that with his kid in there."

"Wayne doesn't care about his kids." Jason said in a somber tone, which really didn't help Peter with his conspiracy theory problem. "Everyone knows he can just adopt another if one of them dies. He's just that kind of asshole."

That was probably the most loaded thing the metahuman had ever heard in his life and all he could do was nod, keeping his mounting frustration off his face. At this rhythm, the little creeper he met at the library would indeed turn out to be Robin. Of course, the universe couldn't give him a good night's sleep without adding a metric ton of crap to his already very long list of problems. Was he going to have to worry about a pint sized vigilante trying to stun or drug him whenever he had his back turned?

"Maybe." He said, very politically indeed. "Either way, his kid tried to grab me at some point, but I avoided him." He made no mention of the Spider Sense, there were many other metahuman traits he could use to explain why he reacted so fast. "Wayne wanted me to drink some water. I didn't."

Jason's face relaxed noticeably after he added the last sentence. The man really thought he was an incompetent baby, lost in some kind of dark hellscape. Well, Gotham was sort of a hellscape, but he was as far from a toddler. With Ivy giving him a first hand experience of being poisoned, there was no way he wouldn't be suspicious of someone he didn't know handing him a drink.

"Yes, I know." Peter scowled, straightening up. "I'm not as hopeless as you think."

He cleared his throat, let out a slow, long breath. Getting annoyed would only make things worse. It was a lot easier to keep his temper when he wasn't feeling like a zombie. He resumed his story, which sounded a lot more lame than he remembered it. Without explaining he had supernatural instincts, and might be considered a bit of a seer, the whole ride had been relatively boring. "Wayne insisted on dropping me at work. When we went out of the car, he wanted me to shake his hand." Another instance of his friend tensing, and another one of him relaxing when he added: "I didn't."

Really, how innocent did Jason think he was?

Then, he had stepped into that car so maybe he deserved some of that disbelief.

"That's pretty much it." His tale over, he stood up and headed back to the workbenches. There were other trinkets there he thought he had recognized. One of them might have been a stun grenade, and Tony had never allowed him to work on those. After the man was gone, May had been sure to keep him away from any kind of explosive. He grabbed it and was delighted to discover that it was, indeed, a flashbang.

"You really didn't let him touch you?" Jason insisted, following him and narrowing his eyes when he noticed what he had just picked up. "Please don't mess with that one."

Peter carefully put the item down, switching his attention to a strange metallic glove, laying on the other end of the table. It was long enough to reach his elbow when he slipped it on. Tensing his fist caused blades to slide out of its sides; they were slightly curved but sharp enough to draw blood, and very well maintained. He felt their blunt end press on his skin, scratching it without drawing blood. He was significantly smaller than Red Hood, using one of those couldn't be a very comfortable experience for him.

"Are you going to play with everything?" The vigilante was a lot less patient than usual. The guy rivaled Gordon in the sleep deprivation department, which explained his mood swings.

"You can't blame me." The teen pointed his armored hand at Jason, who was now closing the window. He wagged his finger and grimaced when the metal blades dug further into his flesh. Yeah. Not comfortable at all. "You left all your best toys out in the open." He looked down at the malfunctioning weapon. "Mind if I take that apart?"

To his surprise it turned out that no, his friend did not mind and he was allowed to tinker as much as he wanted. As long as he allowed the rogue to watch what he did, he was welcome to look at everything in the room, save for the stun grenade.

He soon found out a large part of the everything in question consisted of an endless supply of firearms and explosives. By the tenth incident of him opening a case only to be faced with an intimidating, most definitely illegal, assault weapon of some kind, he limited himself to what was already out. The workbench had plenty of tools attached to it and he gleefully sorted through them. His favorite so far was a tiny dart gun, small enough to be hidden within the palm of his hand, but stinking of chemicals so potent they could put an elephant to sleep. Straight out of a movie. He peered at it for a little bit too long, and his nose started to itch. The smell of it got to him. He gagged.

"It's my turn now." He, with great resilience and strength of spirit, put the poisoned darts down and looked up at Jason. "Let's talk about the Bats."

The rogue did not react well to the mention of the vigilantes. He gritted his teeth and pushed himself off the front door, which he'd been leaning on, started to pace, hand going to his pocket, where he usually kept his lighter and smoking kit. His other fist opened and closed compulsively, moving up to grab his hair. He was trying to keep his emotions under control without blowing up again. The anger was back, tainting the air, but it was still nascent.

He looked like he had it covered for now. Nothing Peter had to say would make the situation better. He decided to play for time and focused back on the pile of equipment he'd gathered. Next in line was a gas mask similar to his own, albeit looking as if part of it had been melted off. The red metal bulged like wax, and its lower half was severely corroded. He whistled, poking at it. The damage had not been caused by heat. Perhaps acid? A very potent toxin, designed to eat through anything? His elbow brushed against the bladed gauntlet and he ended up picking it up again. He had been given the all clear, there was nothing stopping him from taking it apart and stopping it from torturing its user whenever it was activated.

"There's a lot I can't tell you." Jason sighed, after walking back and forth around the apartment at least a dozen times.

Peter looked at him. The young man had moved away and was now standing under the window, moving to open it again. Apparently he needed to smoke more than once to get through what he must think was going to be an interrogation. The teenager slipped his fingers away from the small catch in the plating he'd meant to test the strength of and rested his chin on the palm of his hands, leaning over the many different tasers, weapons and scanning devices. He was very careful not to touch any of the more damaged ones, getting shocked wasn't fun.

"You don't really have to tell me anything." He clarified, feeling oddly calm, despite what he was about to say. "I just meant how you went and shot one of them."

Jason's hand stopped briefly but finished its movement and finished pushing the glass panel upwards. A blast of cold air ran through the room, which they both ignored. "What about it?" He asked, taking his lighter out. "They were going for you. Do you expect me to be a good Christian boy? Turn the other cheek and all that?"

The window rattled. A small pile of snow toppled down and spilled inside. Too much anger.

Giving the former rogue time to calm down had worked so far, he might as well keep doing it.

Peter grabbed the gauntlet and returned to taking it apart. The blades were easy enough to get out once he'd found the mechanisms that secured them; those were only accessible from the inside and it took a bit of maneuvering to get to them. The weapon had only one type of trigger, unlike his own web shooters, so it wasn't that difficult to figure out how it worked. The large amount of equipment he had available to make his task easier helped too. He'd been making himself suffer taking the Iron Spider apart with only tweezers and whatever gear he'd managed to scavenge or afford. He only had to step across the hall to get access to a proper workstation.

By the time he put the last blade down, all of them neatly aligned in front of him, Jason had calmed down, although he was now on his third cigarette.

Peter didn't remember him smoking quite so often before they started clashing with the Bats. It wasn't good on his lungs, he had to buy back Barbara's books as soon as he could. One of them had to have an example of a healthy coping mechanism. Tobacco worked for now, and he decided this was his best opportunity to keep talking. He had a hard time stopping himself from tweaking with his little project and settled on moving slowly and mechanically, eyes aways from his hands. As long as he was careful, he didn't really need his eyes. His other senses could pick up the slack.

"I'd rather they don't attack us in the first place." He said, trying to make some more space in the gauntlet for the blades, which he had yet to reinsert. He almost burned his hand in the process. His Spider Sense saved him at the last second. "But if they do again, I'd probably just leave. I don't want to deal with them."

"You want me to do the same thing." Not a question. Jason didn't sound like he approved.

Gotham appeared to Peter as one of those cities that needed several active teams to keep safe. With the numbers they had, the Bats must have all of the days of the week covered. He imagined Batman, Nightwing and that Red Robin guy led the patrols, with the kids following along and backing them up. Back at the Pits, they had only sent one of the three older men to face him. Securing Bane couldn't have been much safer but still, they hadn't wanted to let the younger vigilantes confront two potential villains, one of them a metahuman.

With three team leaders, they must be working in shifts and share coverage of the city. Even that wasn't enough to stop every single incident, and he himself had ended up in his fair share of street fights. He had also seen infamous criminals such as Ivy and Harley walk around without care. There was enough white noise in town to cover an entire underground arena, and likely a dozen other illegal ventures. Even with Spider-Man and Red Hood coming into play, taking out the other crime fighters was a very poor idea. Gotham was less of a bomb waiting to explode and more a massive field of landmines constantly in the process of blowing itself up.

He tried to explain his opinion diplomatically.

"You told me yourself you wanted to be a vigilante. You can't do that if you pick fights with people on the same side as you."

First attempt, not as smooth as he wanted it to sound but not too bad for him.

"We are not on the same side." Jason scowled.

The cold wind was beginning to wear him thin. Peter wished he'd brought something a bit warmer than his usual indoor clothes. It was already frosty enough in his room that he was worried about Ivy's plant and had ended up wrapping his blanket around the pot, hoping it would help it survive. The temperature was even worse here, with the window open. He couldn't wait for spring. Patrolling was always easier in spring. People were in a better mood too, unless they had seasonal allergies.

"We're not on the side of the criminals." He said sternly, cutting his day dreaming short. "I'm done with the cage fighting, and you have to stop with the drug lord thing."

As we agreed.

"Maybe. But. We're on our own side." Jason's mouth leaked smoke again. It curled up in fascinating patterns, mixing with the falling snow. "A third side. We're not with the Bats."

"Sure." He didn't hold the local vigilantes in the best regards since they'd tried to electrocute, drug and kidnap him. He was perfectly fine staying away from them. "But even then, we're not their enemies. We can ignore them, I think that'd be good."

His friend glared up at the window, perhaps imagining the Bats were on the other side of it. He brushed some snow off of his shoulders, perfectly comfortable in the cold. "They aren't going to ignore you. Batman took a personal interest in you and he isn't about to let it go." He looked deadly serious. "The guy gets really fucking obsessed with things."

Peter slipped the armor piece back on and closed his hand. The one blade he'd replaced so far slid out smoothly, giving his arm plenty of space to sit. Much better now. He repeated the process a few times, noticing a tiny delay. Nothing he couldn't fix. "You sound like you know him well."

Jason called him a rather rude name. He ignored it. "Fuck off with that." His partner told him, exasperated. "You know I used to be Robin."

"Sorry." He shrugged, getting back to messing with the gauntlet. "So he gets obsessive?"

"You have no idea. If you've caught his interest he won't let you go until he's satisfied."

His friend sounded sad and angry at himself for feeling bad in the first place. Peter was coming to terms with the fact he had somehow landed into the middle of the biggest family feud this side of the multiverse. Worse, he'd gotten so involved he was condemned to having to deal with it. He missed his simple family life with May. They had their moments, and high school had been difficult to navigate, but only one of them partook in heroism, and they never tried to kill or capture each other.

If Wayne was Batman, and if he did in fact get obsessed with things, as Jason described, he could see who Damian took from. His only hope was that his theory was wrong. He could deal with one civilian stalker and one vigilante stalker, having both of them liable to follow him at night was a bit too much for him, even if half of the duo was only twelve.

"That's creepy." Another blade went into the gauntlet, he pushed it into place and secured it. "Still. We're not going to fight them. If we see them, either we ignore them or we get out."

He heard Jason's heart rate speed up in anger and their eyes crossed. He held his gaze, feeling as if he was putting on a very good impression of a confident, calm person. Practice really did make perfect.

"This isn't an argument." He said. "It was and still is a condition for me to work with you. We are not going after other vigilantes. Sure, we're not on their side. We don't answer to them, we don't trust them. I can get behind that. But we're not about to send someone else to the hospital when they could be out on the streets helping people."

The window closed with a bang.

He quickly put anything vaguely sharp away, off to the further side of the work area. Jason still had a tenuous grasp on his temper but it was better not to risk it.

"They do not. Help people." The young man breathed out. He began pacing again, took a butterfly knife from one of his desks and started flipping it between his fingers. The maneuvers got more elaborate as he began talking again, visibly struggling with keeping his temper. "They fuck everything up."

Peter tried to imprint every detail in his mind, so he could lay them down on paper later. This wasn't uncontrollable rage, not yet, but he recognized that odd light in his partner's eyes. He was distant, as if he wasn't fully in touch with reality, listening or seeing something else, superimposed on the world around him. Hallucinations? That would make his condition significantly more complex. Had Nightwing not told him the symptoms had an unnatural cause, he might have assumed this was an illness. He had met and helped several civilians with similar behavior.

It was artificial. That meant it had to have a cure, or at least a way to reverse engineer it. He tapped his fingers on the wooden workbench, sticking, freeing, sliding them along. He had to watch carefully. Listen. 

Accelerated heart rate.

Shallow breathing.

Sweating and some minor shakings of the hands.

Dilated pupils and-

The eyes.

He moved immediately, getting closer to Jason, who was still walking. He stood a few feet away from him, and found out that, yes, he had not imagined it.

Red Hood's eyes were glowing.

No. Not glowing. Not exactly. He couldn't see any light reflecting off his skin, and his pupils looked as dark as they should be. The color had changed, though, going from a lighter, slightly faded green to a vibrant emerald. The shade was so intense his irises seemed to shine. Double damn. A spell causing this was more and more likely. Glowing eyes and magic went together like burger and fries. Or ice cream and cookies. Or-

Stop thinking about food, Parker.

"Back off."

Jason growled, moving forward as if to push him. Staying close wasn't a good idea.

He went back to his seat and rested his hands flat on the table. Pushing too far now would be a mistake. The room was full of dangerous explosives and firearms. Their neighbors wouldn't take well to their lunch being ruined by a shootout, they might even get evicted.

As if he'd read his mind, the other teen headed to his front door, grabbing and sliding his jacket on, then storming out. Peter followed him silently, and they ended up standing at the top of the stairs.

"Stay in there." His teammate pinned him down with a glare. "Fuck with whatever you want, don't blow up the place." He ignored his protests and spoke over his reply. "I need some time to think. Don't worry, I won't shoot anyone."

Watching him stomp down the stairs, Peter considered whether or not he should listen to his partner. He was not in a good state, and his condition was actively influencing him. Still, he was able to speak and he hadn't gone through with attacking him. Following him and getting spotted might cause him to completely blow up, and there were a lot more innocent bystanders walking around during the day. This could be a test. He thought he was perceptive enough to notice if his neighbor got involved in a fight. If he did, he would have to start sticking with him more often, to ensure he didn't get himself into trouble. If he didn't, then he had been right about one thing. Giving Red Hood space was a good way to let him calm down on his own, before he got so worked up he could no longer be reasoned with.

In the end, his need to be alone won out and he dipped into his apartment.

The plant looked alright. He adjusted the blankets around it and checked it wasn't too cold. If it died, he thought Ivy might track him down and murder him in revenge. Not much he could do now, save for buying a space heater he didn't have the budget for. 

It only took a few seconds to find his notebook and pens and he was soon back in Jason's room.

He cleared himself a spot on the couch, noticing for the first time the books scattered on the cushions. He read some of the back covers, surprised to see most of them were from completely unrelated genres. There were more vehicle magazines than anything else, but he found several American classics as well as foreign literature, science fiction, theater plays and even a translation of an ancient legal document from East Asia. Interesting. Everyone had hidden depths. Going to the library together as friends didn't seem so unlikely now.

It felt a bit odd to be sitting in someone else's apartment alone, but he hadn't missed the number of locks on the door, and was fairly certain Jason would not usually leave it open like this. His mood was bad enough that he hadn't taken the time to before he left, and he must have wanted him to sit in there to stop anyone else from sneaking in. He didn't need to stay in the room to ensure nobody broke in, he could have heard it through the walls, but he still had to finish fixing the bladed gauntlet, and there were a good dozen other items he wanted to take a closer look at.

But for now, he had to focus for a bit; put his observations down before he got distracted.

The first line of the first page was very simple, a single word.

SYMPTOMS:

Peter started writing.
Notes:

    Pit Madness is so inconsistent in comics istg so I guess that's my spin on it.
    Peter actually has fun for once. Also yes he LOVES all of the bat gadgets. Jason thinks he might as well make use of his pet tech genius.
    OK I am SICK of not writing action but I have to wait until the showdown I planned and it makes me SO sad. I just want to skip straight to violence.

Chapter Text

Peter looked down at his feet and at the dark waters roiling under them. Flecks of foam hit the bottom of his shoes, droplets stuck to the tip of his fingers. Gotham was a coastal city and, despite its powerful criminal element, it was still a major harbor on the East Coast. His usual delivery roads took him to the heart of the central island, away from the ocean and from the memories it might stir of New York and of days walking the riverside, hand in hand with his girlfriend. He hadn't realized until then how much he missed the smell of salt and the familiar sights of a river rushing into a larger body of water.

"Are you sure you're ready to agree?"

He didn't mean to sound accusatory but couldn't help that small sliver of doubt from seeping into his tone. He wanted to believe Jason and trust him but knew how difficult it could be for a man used to murder and violence to turn back from that path. Giving up on him was not an option but believing him so easily might be a mistake. His friend seemed to understand, he didn't react poorly, shrugging and flicking open a can of soda he pocketed from Marco's kitchen.

"Yeah. It's one month, right?"

One month. He almost forgot about their agreement. To him, renouncing murder should be a lifelong decision. To Red Hood, it was merely an idea he wished to try out, nothing more than an idea. The rogue turned vigilante did not fully understand why killing and justice could not co-exist. Peter hoped to make him change his ways, he had managed to reach an agreement between them at least. Thirty days were such a short time, but they would have to be enough.

He plucked a fry out of his cardboard take-out box and threw it up in the air. A seagull dropped in from the clouds to snatch it before it hit the churning sea. He wondered why it was still active so late at night, then remembered he was in Gotham city and most creatures there were nocturnal.

"No murder, no antagonizing anyone who isn't a wanted criminal."

"You're a wanted criminal." His neighbor retorted.

Jason was amused. He no longer smelled afraid, sad or angry. Whatever he had done that afternoon had helped him come to a decision and he had returned to their job much more subdued, to the point he had wished Marco a good time on his upcoming week-long holiday. Peter was too busy thinking about the delicious leftovers he would be missing out on to notice but, later, he remembered the astonished look on their boss' face. He was a high school graduate, a former super hero, an aspiring vigilante and a criminal mastermind tamer. Spider-Man, the metahuman who whispered in the ears of serial killers.

He choked down on a fit of laughter.

"Not a wanted criminal." He said, once he was done grinning like an idiot.

"Got friends in high places?"

Gordon could hardly be called a friend. Reluctant ally was too kind a term to describe their relationship. The man treated him like a very sharp knife, one he couldn't wield without fearing injuries. It was a noticeable step up from his usual relationship with the police.

"No friends." Peter shook his head. "Just lucky, I guess. Maybe I'm too much of a small fry."

"Bullshit." His friend clicked his tongue, reminding him sharply of a much younger boy with much colder eyes. "But keep on staying quiet, you're a slow learner but you're getting there."

"You are the first person to ever call me a slow learner."

He supposed a lot of things had changed between now and his beginning days as a super hero. He used to be praised for his inventive mind and his quick wit. That was back when he had May and Tony, when he could rely on his two best friends. Did losing them affect him that much? It must have. Sometimes, he still felt as if he walked in a daydream, a nightmare, that his mind was filled with fog he struggled to pierce. He was getting better. Talking to Jason helped. Fighting people, running on roofs and getting into all kinds of trouble helped even more. Perhaps he had needed the arena more than he expected, he wanted the violence, had needed it to get his mind off of his memories.

"Well, you're smart, but you're fucked up alright."

Jason, as usual, didn't pull his punches. He was used to it by now and didn't take offense to his tone. Still, the man tried to clarify, raising a hand to pacify him.

"Not an insult. This is Gotham, everyone's fucked up every single damn way to Sunday, you fit right in. Didn't think you would, but you got a hard core to you." He hesitated again but eventually kept talking. "Not like a hard heart, just that you're strong. You gave Bane a beating, yeah?"

"Yeah." He looked down at his shoes again, at the water under the bridge. He could hear cars drive behind them, hidden from sight thanks to the massive pillars they leaned against. Anyone else would have been horrified by the height but both of them were used to danger and neither would fall easily. "Is that what you think is strong?"

"Bane's not just a fighter. A lot of his tactics have to do with intimidation. He broke the Bat's back when I was gone, ruled right over the whole damn city for a bit. Bastard's far too clever."

"He did try to intimidate me."

"And you broke all of his bones in response."

"You don't think that was messed up." Peter wasn't asking a question, he already knew the answer. He may remember that night with a queasy stomach, he may dream of snapping arms and bruises the size of his fists blooming on skin stretched by overgrown muscles. He may do all that yet, to a man born in Gotham, his showing was one of strength. Jason was impressed with him, Jason was satisfied with his choices. 

His friend smiled. "Nah. We'll have to work around it, your civilian identity is very high profile right now. But we can do something about it. Did you know you can hide secrets within other secrets?"

There were several buildings in town who were owned by criminal enterprises. They remained empty, rented to companies who never finished projects and never occupied it. Occasionally, minor drug deals and smuggling operations would be discovered, never enough to close down the place. In between those events, they were considered low priority, the crimes that happened there were never too severe, never bad enough to warrant a full investigation. It left people a lot of room to move and use the space however they wanted. Hiding a secret within a secret. Peter ought to talk to his landlady, pay her and ask how he could get papers.

"I remember." He said, after a while. "Why are we here?"

He didn't mind the cold so much now that he helped himself to one of Jason's spare jackets. The man had so many of them, he likely wouldn't miss it, he hadn't said anything about it when they met up that evening so his instincts had been right. While he wasn't uncomfortable, he didn't fully understand why they had this talk here, right next to a major road, instead of in their apartments. Jason didn't provide any complicated answer, didn't jump off to lead him to yet another secret headquarters. He simply said "I like heights" and Peter smiled, because he understood that feeling. He also loved the wind and the cold, the slight danger and the loneliness.

"We need to get ready." Red Hood spoke, after a long silence that felt more like companionship than any of their previous talks ever had. "Tomorrow might be a fucking mess."

Peter thought about the date, which was a lot more difficult to pin down that it had rights to be. "Something usually happen on New Years' Eve?" He asked, once he remembered the day and the month. His mind may be healing from the shock of changing dimensions but it felt far too scattered still.

"Yeah. Main guy's gone now but that doesn't mean some asshole won't try to hold up his tradition. Might not happen. Either way, we should get back and work on your suit. You know how to make gloves?"

He remembered May guiding his small hands through complex loops, holding his fingers when they bled because he pricked himself during his first attempt at sewing. He could picture Tony, explaining how his technology worked and how he needed to learn to use it by himself, just in case. How he had been right because there had been a before Tony Stark and an after Tony Stark and while the world at large may not have cared much, because the man could be a bit of a dick, he still missed him dearly. He had watched Jason's technique, had listened to countless videos and had replicated it through the technology he inherited.

"Sure." He nodded. "Race you to the bike."

He slid the rest of his food into his friend's plastic bag and leapt to his feet.

"What- Hey!"

Jason's voice echoed across the bridge even as Peter launched himself in the air, flipping and moving ever upward. He stopped on one of the taut cables connecting the road to the pylons and used them to jump off again, faster this time. He landed hands first, gripped the side of a cement barrier for barely a moment and was in motion the next instant. Behind him, he could still hear his friend curse and hastily use his grappling hook to gain speed. That wouldn't be enough to catch up to him but it was a good attempt. The younger teen decided to hold back a bit and make his teammate believe he had a shot. He slowed down in between his two next jumps, crossed eyes with him, then grinned and effortlessly doubled his speed. He was next to the motorcycle a second later, hair ruffled by the wind and leather jacket slipping off one of his shoulders. He felt alive.

There was a kind of friendship that could only be achieved between fellow vigilantes, people who understood the thrill of the fight and were able to keep up with him. He had rarely shared that with another person his age before. He had hoped, for a few hours, that Ned could join him out there thanks to his new magic abilities. Even if he had stayed in his first world, he doubted that would have happened. His best friend was not one for heroics, he much preferred being the guy in the chair. He couldn't blame him for that. Everyone had their role to play, and they decided what it was.

He was very happy to have met Jason. They weren't equals physically, not unless Red Hood met a rogue radioactive spider, but they understood each other.

"Fucking metahuman." His coworker grunted, landing next to him smoothly, already tucking his grappling gun under his shirt. "You're cheating."

"Unless you got another one of those," he mimicked a gun firing up in the air, much to the annoyance of his companion, "I think it's perfectly fair."

"Fair my ass, you don't see me use super speed."

"Can you use super speed?"

His own physical attributes were merely enhanced, with only a few dipping past that and moving onto the super category. He had heard of speedsters in his original universe but they were extremely rare and most were urban legends. One had supposedly died a long time ago, another was rumored to be a mutant. This world, however, had them in spades. The Flash was the most famous but he was one man in a larger group of vigilantes, heroes and even villains who shared the same power.

"Fuck no, I'm as boring as they get."

Peter gave him a look he made sure expressed just how dubious he felt. Jason was six foot tall and two hundred pounds of muscles. Looking past his arsenal of weapons, his ridiculously tuned motorcycle and his past as a famous sidekick, there was nothing about him that could be called boring. Even without his frame, the white streak in his hair and his intermittently glowing green eyes would label him unusual at the very least. He was a lot more distinctive than him, who was a metahuman disguised as a run of the mill teenager.

He shook his head and gave up on arguing. This was not the hill he would die on.

"Do you want me to race you on your bike? Might be fair."

"If I went all out on this beauty," Jason slapped the side of his vehicle, looking at it more like it was a beloved child than an object, "you wouldn't stand a chance."

"Keep telling yourself that."

They fell into comfortable silence once again, which was soon covered by the bike's engine as they headed back to their apartments.

That side of the island wasn't too far from the Bowery and, while it was full of small time criminals, it was also currently bustling with police officers. The consequences of the arena bust would be felt for weeks if not for months. Before leaving for work, Peter had checked who among the rogues had been arrested and had been surprised to recognize a few names. Bane was one, evidently, but so was a man named Deadshot, an infamous marksman. Even the Penguin was under investigation. Cobblepot was influential but everyone and their mother knew he was behind the fighting rink, it was only a matter of time before he was tied up in court. He wondered what would happen then, the crime lord did not seem the type to let himself be sentenced easily.

Everyone on the streets was far too concerned with their own safety to cause them trouble. They still took the long way back, likely to avoid being tracked. Jason must have deemed them safe since, at some point, he dropped him off in front of their building and parked his motorcycle in the back, under its habitual blanket of chains and locks. They walked upstairs without crossing paths with any of their shady neighbors and settled into the older boy's room.

It took them a bit to get to work, which they spent mostly on taunting each other about who would be the fastest in a no limits race, but they eventually focused back on their task.

Peter, as always, found it remarkably easy to slip into a state of complete focus. He listened to his friend's instruction intently, watched him explain how his horrific Craft-It-All worked and diligently began crafting the gloves of his outfit. The schematics he had in his notebooks proved just as helpful as the hints and tips Jason shared. While he was initially very careful about how he handled the different fabrics, he soon reached a pace that would be unnatural to any regular human. Having perfect balance, fine motor control and an excellent memory was a cheat code to life he had used many times before. As long as he had examples and someone to bounce questions and ideas with, he could make something much faster and more efficiently than an experienced artist. He rarely felt as if he deserved being praised for it, most of it was due to his mutations, but he wouldn't ignore his talents simply because he felt he didn't earn them.

"Damn you're fast." Jason whistled, while he put the finishing touches on the mask's new lenses. "Ever thought about taking commissions?"

"I think I'll be a bit too busy for that." He admitted, checking the strength of his current attempt at a half-decent glove. "I'd rather be a scientist, I think."

"Uh. Which kind?"

He tilted his head, considering. "Some sort of physicist I suppose. I haven't decided yet."

"You got time, you're what, sixteen?"

Peter glared at him over the workstation he had commandeered. "Seventeen. You know that already."

Jason did not look one bit remorseful and even had the gall to grin at him roguishly. "Hard to remember, you've got a bit of a baby face."

Easy for him to say that, he had the bulk and the features of a man in his early twenties. Nature could truly be deeply unfair. The New Yorker pushed down on the Craft-It-All with slightly too much strength and frowned when he managed to ruin twenty minutes of work in a single second of frustration.

"I finished high school, you know." He said, after a long minute of glaring at his ruined project.

"You went to high school?" Jason sounded surprised.

"You didn't?"

The vigilante shook his head slowly, eyes still fixed on the mask he was fixing up. "No time for that, went on a road trip instead." He looked up and waved him over. "Come try this."

Peter left his work behind and walked up to him, accepting the item and putting it in front of his head. The plate separating the fabric from his face wasn't too tight and it had the required amount of notches and holes he needed to implement his gadget ideas. He nodded and set it down. "Should be good." He leaned back, looked at the dark skies. "We probably should head to bed."

"No time for that. This won't be ready by tomorrow but we can make it usable. I can lend you pants that should fit somewhat right. If anything happen, I don't want you fucking off with your bare face again."

The metahuman rolled his eyes. Out of all the potential vigilante partners, he had to find the one who found sleep to be a suggestion instead of a vital bodily function. He could get by with less rest than a baseline human, but he doubted his teammate could do the same. He resumed his work on the gloves, keeping track of the time through the thickening layer of snow on the window and the few screams he heard piercing the night. Gotham was always more active in the small hours.

An hour later, he stopped, stared at his still unfinished gloves then looked up.

If Jason agreed to his terms, perhaps he could start trusting him a bit more. He wouldn't tell him anything too important yet, but there was one subject he needed help with. He had made some progress using the Internet but all he had so far were speculations. The question fell from his lips surprisingly fast, he had thought it would be harder to open up about it. Then, he had already mentioned it to Gordon and the Bats spying on their exchange,

"Have you heard of a person or a place named Ace?"

Jason's breath caught. As expected, if the local vigilantes were interested in this intel, Red Hood would likely know something about this. His satisfaction was short lived, soon replaced by confusion as his teammate leaned back, looked up at his ceiling then sent him the coldest glare he had ever seen on his face. Even Wayne hadn't gotten such a strong reaction out of him.

"You aren't ready for that. Don't ask more questions, don't look into it."

Peter forgot all about his gloves and his costume and stood up, crossing the space between them in a couple long steps. "I think I will. Do you know why I'm asking?" He didn't give his teammate time to reply and went on: "Bane mentioned it. Same Bane who uses performance enhancers that make him double in size. He said whoever, or whatever, Ace is helped him with his new formula. I don't know if he stole from them, I don't know if he worked with them. I do want to get to the bottom of this, so I will. It could be related to that dead man, the one from the destroyed buildings. I'm sure he was innocent. He looked like a test subject."

"Don't I get a say?" Jason's eyes shone not with the unnatural green light but with something frightfully cold. "We are a team. For one month, you veto shit, I get to veto shit back. Only fair."

Anger welled up in his throat, burning behind his eyes. He clenched his fists and resisted the urge to scream, they had neighbors and it was very late. "It's not the same, this is about saving lives, not-"

"Killing people can save lives." Red Hood said softly, dangerously. "But I'm not arguing that with you. We disagree, it's fine. I agree to your terms for one month, you agree to mine. You're stopping your investigation. You're strong and you're learning but you're not ready for that shit. It'll eat you whole."

He sounded like he truly believed it too.
Notes:

    I'm not fully satisfied with this chapter but i've been stuck on 37 since November so i decided to just post the latest version and move on to the next story arc no matter what.
    RIP Peter but if Red Hood stops killing for one month you have to make concessions too.
    Jason is not afraid of Ace Chemicals but he is very afraid of what will happen to Petey if he catches a specific's person attention.

Chapter Text

They may not be as versatile as his webs, but grappling hooks were fun to use. The ones developed by Batman's team had several settings and most of them tugged him forward with such force he suspected anyone who picked up the tool without any training would end up with a dislocated shoulder. The gun was calibrated to carry someone much heavier than him, which likely didn't help. He could have spent a minute messing with it and adjusted it, but he thought the speed it gave him was fun.

His teammate warned him his spare gear had quirks. In this case, the quirk involved being flung around by an overpowered cable. The swinging was subpar, but the propulsion was better than his web-shooters, even if that was because of a mistake. Ten minutes into the lesson, he found out how to retract and shoot the hook mid-air. Half an hour later, he was practicing building up acceleration while changing directions, all under the supervision of a disgruntled Jason.

"I thought you were going to crash into the wall." The teen confessed, looking disappointed.

Peter backflipped off a ceiling beam and made sure to set the grappling gun to the highest setting before aiming at the ground. The landing was a bit rough and he may have dented the cement somewhat when he slammed into it feet first, but it gave the effect he wanted. With a flourish, he straightened up and said:

"I was swinging between buildings before you were a twinkle in your parents' eyes, son."

He snapped his fingers at his friend, who slapped them away.

"You're so cheerful."

The older man did not mean it as a compliment: Peter's enthusiasm seemed to cause him physical pain. But how could he understand the joy of being able to move freely in the air, when he had never lost the ability to do so? The grappling gun wasn't as advanced as his old suit: it was more likely to severely injure a perp than immobilize them safely. It didn't matter. It was a way of traveling that kept his feet off the ground and off the walls.

"I think I'm in love," he said, taking care to make his smile very wide and very bright. He'd learned that was a good way to taunt his partner, who still expected him to behave like a gloomy Gotham kid.

As expected, Jason groaned and kicked at his face. Peter tilted his head to the side so the strike brushed past his ear, he felt it touch his skin. He prepared himself for another long spar, but no more hit came his way. Surprised, he glanced up, through the glass panels lining the roof, and noticed the orange cast of the sky. Dusk already.

The day went by too fast, he was so busy practicing with his new toys that he didn't find time to excuse himself and decide whether or not he wanted to continue the investigation on his own. That couldn't be a coincidence. Jason was sneaky, he probably planned this all along. He was an excellent sparring partner too, he didn't match his speed but he constantly taught him new tricks and techniques. He had taken his mind off of Ace, the serum and Gordon's interest in Bane.

"Gear up." The partner in question tossed a small suitcase his way. "Patrol starts in ten."

He obeyed with a small salute and leaped up to change in the single office overlooking Jason's warehouse; it was the only place in the hideout with any amount of privacy. He switched to his suit, of which he only had the uppermost half. Even without the spider-web pattern, he liked the look of it. Black and red, it reminded him of the Iron Spider, of a softer, less flamboyant version of it. He wouldn't be adding gold trimmings to this one, he missed Tony, but it was time he stood on his own. He could honor his memory in other ways.

First his suit, then pants, modified to fit him. They weren't quite skin-tight but he didn't expect any difficulties when moving. The boots were another piece of the costume he borrowed from Jason, they belonged to him "back in the day". Whether that meant during the man's killing spree or while he was Robin remained a mystery, like so many things around him. Peter argued for close to an hour about not needing the metal soles that came with the outfit, which would be disastrous for his fighting style. He could already punch down trees, he really didn't want to tempt fate by adding more innovative ways for him to accidentally brain people.

The suit felt good. It felt weird. The last time he wore it was during the Firefly attack.

Before that, Spider-Man's last appearance was in another universe.

He held his new mask in his hands, looked at the plastic lenses and smiled.

Watch me.

Fitting the plate and the fabric over his face, he felt a sudden surge of emptiness. He planned on adding interfaces to the mask, had been working on it off and on since he bought his new computer, but there had be no time to include them before that evening. He was back to doing things the old fashioned way, no scanner, no heat vision or artificial intelligence. He hadn't noticed how used he was to information appearing in front of his eyes.

Red Hood whistled when he jumped back down next to him. The man wore one of his regular helmets, a model that modified his voice and made him sound like a murderous robot. Paired with the body-armor, the bladed gauntlets, the many firearms and the leather jacket he always donned, he looked like a cross between a vigilante and a killer for hire. They made quite the pair, both decked in crimson and black.

The metahuman pointed at their outfits then at their respective heads, which were completely covered. They hadn't planned to color-coordinate their hero suits but their partnership was clearly meant to be. It was a sign.

"We match!"

His teammate tapped a gun on the side of his helmet and shook his head, not impressed by his comment. His finger was off the trigger, at least.

"This isn't a fashion show." Red Hood said in his creepy robot voice. "Head in the game."

"Aye aye!"

The mercenary was worried. Well, Peter had implied he had experience as a vigilante, he even mentioned it outright a few times. Sadly, his reputation didn't follow him into this world so, even with these tidbits, the most the gunman knew was what he picked up by watching him fight. He must look weird from his perspective: a random teenager with superpowers crashing into the most dangerous city in America, dragging with him an advanced tech suit and a habit of running headfirst into danger. What did Jason think of him?

He fought the urge to send out one of his webs and exit the warehouse in the most dramatic way possible. Even after scrapping and salvaging the fluid left in his canisters, he had only saved six swings. Four, if they were over a long distance. The grappling hook was going to be his best friend until he got around to ordering everything he needed. Thanks to Gordon, he planned to splurge on a phone and on a plethora of crime fighting supplies no later than the very next day. He had also located a few universities and research facilities that had promising dumping sites. Nothing like old chemicals and broken equipment for a vigilante on a budget.

Red Hood tossed him a small earpiece and a dark piece of fabric. The former was easy to figure out and he set it up quickly. The latter was more of a surprise: was he supposed to conform to whatever rule there was in Gotham that required the local vigilantes wear domino masks?

"You never know when that might come off." His companion looked down at the red spider mask in his hands. "I have one too."

"Is this a tradition or something?"

"Just put it on."

The robot was angry.

He put it on.

"We really do match, though," Peter added with a cocky grin, getting back into his vigilante get-up.

He was out through a small window on the roof before his friend had the time to aim a weapon at his head. The grappling gun sent him soaring dozens of feet over the building, he used that time to adjust his body and aim for the ground next to Red Hood's bike. His borrowed shoes absorbed the shock without tearing apart and the pants didn't impede his acrobatics. Yep, this was more than decent. A bit too dark for his taste, but worth it in the short term.

Jason ran to catch up with him.

"You're dramatic. D'you come from Broadway or something?"

His emotions were hard to decipher with his voice like this, and his scent was masked by a heavy chemical perfume, but Peter knew his body language: he was still annoyed.

"Almost did, my good sir." He showed off his best pointe, moving his arms just so, using his unnatural grace. "Took a couple years of ballet, before the city blew up."

As it happened, New York had been invaded by numerous alien cultures in this universe as well. There were plenty of documentaries about it online and he was relieved he didn't have to pretend he wasn't aware of other species existing beyond Earth.

"I can see that. Too bad Nightwing's an ass, you two would get along."

He remembered meeting the first Robin on top of the Clocktower and was very glad his face was hidden by a mask. While he was having a mental breakdown, Red Hood unwrapped his motorcycle. He didn't start the engine, but fiddled with a hidden control panels on the side of the machine. Odd.

"You aren't getting on?"

His friend shook his head.

"Gotta stick around for your first patrol so you don't get your ass shot. If we need to go, I can call it over."

"Oh, neat."

It was like Tony's self-piloting suits, save for the flying and the nanobots. Peter considered the legalities of a bike driving itself down the streets, remembered a few high profile cases back in his universe and found that, like many things in Gotham, he was better off not thinking about it too hard.

"Sooo... where do we start? You have an usual route?"

He didn't get an answer right away. It was, according to Red Hood, more important he learn how to use his earpiece. He indulged him, and even let him explain concepts he had learned years earlier. Yes, he understood the technology wouldn't work in some locations and yes, he would be careful not to be hit on that side of the head. Everything was fine, could they please get on with the debrief?

"Chill," grumbled the robot voice. "You don't want to rush into a death trap. And yeah, I do have a route. Yours won't be the same but we can do mine for now. You know Crime Alley?"

"Park Row?"

That was its proper name, or so Marco's GPS said.

"Sure, Park Row. No one calls it that. Work on your accent too, makes it obvious who you are."

Peter focused and spoke again, dragging his words a bit more.

"I've been to Crime Alley."

His Gotham drawl was better than his fake British accent.

"That works." Jason patted his shoulder. "Let's head there. Roofs only. Be ready to stop on the way. Holidays are a mess in this shithole."

He was right.

Two blocks away from the warehouse, they slowed down and interrupted a car chase. Both parties were shooting at each other and driving at highway speeds in a cramped residential area, which would lead to a death if no one intervened. At best, a bystander would get maimed.

He landed on top of the first vehicle and wrenched a gun out of the passenger's hand, interrupting his attempts to murder his pursuers. The guy stared at him dumbly, took a punch to the jaw and sagged into his seat. The driver swore, swerved the car to try and shake him off but didn't account for his speed. He crawled over the roof all the way to the man's door, broke the glass with a strong kick and swung inside the small space. Another punch, a second fire arm thrown to the backseat, which was, by the way, absolutely covered in drug bags, and he was abusing the brakes to get the car to slow without flipping over.

Getting his license had been a pain, he hated that he needed to go through the tests again. Still, it gave him the skills to pull off stunts like this, and he was sure the dramatic stop looked very cool from the outside.

He glanced back and saw that Jason was done with his own car. He carried his two perps over to him, one on each shoulder. They were too dazed to put up a fight and didn't resist when Red Hood tied them together, using a black rope.

"You calling the police?" Peter asked, dodging a glob of phlegm so kindly spat at him by one of the prisoners.

"They can find them on their own. Fuckers are on patrol too. And Gotham's crooked, if you call one over, they're going to shoot you."

They walked back to the cars and hauled out the cargo. The first vehicle had drugs, the second had assault weapons that were forbidden in every single state in America. Jason dropped a tiny bag on each of the four criminals' laps, took a picture with his phone, then had him carry the rest to the facility he used to dispose of weapons and drugs. Get yourself a metahuman, you can use them as mules. They won't even complain.

They found the crematory off a shady street in the Bowery. The employees seemed to be expecting visitors and led them to a room in the back without asking questions. In a few minutes, the illicit substances were gone and the weapons had changed hands.

Peter was not impressed with that last part. He snatched the guns back, bent their barrels and threw them in the trash on the way out.

"You know I'll have to bribe them now, right?"

Despite his complaining, Red Hood slipped a few bills to the men who had let them inside and cheerfully wished them a nice evening. His good mood was explained when he turned to him mid-air and said over the comms:

"You know, you're supposed to melt or crush them. Snapping them like that's risky."

Robots could be smug, that was news he'd prefer not to know. He wasn't bitter, but he was determined not to become a party to weapon smuggling, stand by and do nothing about it. Jason could do his thing on his own time.

"Well, I don't have pyrokinetic abilities. Maybe I'll drop them at the GCPD next time." Maybe he was a tiny bit bitter.

"Do that and they'll be back out there the very next day. Really. Gordon's fine and he's got a few decent guys but most units sell to Penguin." The robotic voice changed tone, it was subtle but it seemed amused. "Used to sell them to me too."

As expected of Gotham, he couldn't rely on his old technique of packaging everything in webbing, complete with a pretty bow, and handing it to the police. New York officers weren't all clean, but there were checks and balances that stopped them from turning around and selling everything back to the local crime lords. Most of them were scared of the Avengers. He did a few flips to get the frustration out of his system and, as a result, spotted an ongoing assault while he was still upside down.

"Be right back!" He called over his shoulder.

Peter grappled onto the wall behind the perp's head. He flew so fast he had to take care not to hit him head on, or he might have killed him. Instead, he grabbed the back of his jacket and dragged him along for a few feet, then let go. And not a second too late, that grappling gun packed a punch. Mr. Evil-Guy would have been turned into Mr. Evil-Mush if he hadn't dropped him before hitting the wall. His fingers hurt now. Ouch, he shouldn't slam into stone without a plan to catch his footing. Good to know.

Despite his new bruises, the maneuver did its job: because of the momentum, the man lost his balance and fell to the ground. His victim scrambled away, hurriedly picking up her scattered possessions.

"You alright?" He said, checking her for injuries.

She replied by taking out a taser, glaring at him, and shooting the attacker. Typical. He sighed and got ready to stop her. He didn't want a murder on his conscience, even if the future corpse was a scumbag of the highest order.

The bloodthirsty Gothamite noticed his reaction and hesitantly lowered her weapon.

"You new ?" She asked, but only after kicking the unconscious crook in the crotch.

"Yep."

He stepped away from the wall to stand in front of her, hands on his hips.

Add in a thumbs up. There. Perfect.

Now he wouldn't get tased.

"Name's Spider-Man, don't worry, I'm one of the good guys. Saving cats from trees, helping little old lady cross the street, all that."

If he tried that last good deed in Gotham, he felt the imaginary geriatric would shoot him in the head before he got to offer his help. But, unlike the fake grandma, this civilian didn't appear ready to attack him. He gave her a friendly wave, asked a few questions to make sure she wasn't in shock, then offered to walk her to wherever she was headed.

"Fuck no," she said. "You sure you're a Bat?"

"I'm a spider!" He gasped, offended.

He heard Jason snorting through his earpiece. Who knew robots could sound so mocking? First he was smug, then amused and now this. He was starting to believe they weren't even friends anymore.

"Well, spider, I ain't a little old lady so get the hell away. I got shit to do."

She sniffed and left without another word. On the floor, the thug groaned. Peter nudged him with his foot to make sure he wasn't dying. Since his chances of survival were looking good, he tossed him under a streetlight, used one of Red Hood's ropes to tie him up and confiscated the dozen knives he had hidden under his clothes.

"Nice job." Jason told him, standing on the roof of a heavily barricaded bakery.

He didn't need the grappling gun to join him, one jump was enough to clear the distance. He dealt with the weapons as he landed. The knives' blades weren't of good quality, he broke them by pinching one way, then the other.

"Hey," he said, "I have a question."

"Go for it."

They leaped off together, keeping a slower pace this time.

"We aren't listening to police radio."

He landed on a factory roof and slid in the snow until he reached its edge, then jumped up.

"Is it because we can't or because you don't want to?"

Red Hood took a short break to answer him, hanging onto the top of a nearby industrial chimney.

"The GCPD doesn't move everywhere in Gotham," he said, "the Bowery's a mess, there's always some shit going down. Crime Alley's worse."

He dropped down, turned horizontally, aimed his grappling hook and soared towards a grimy apartment building. Peter followed.

"The Bats also work with Gordon, so they're going to be using their intel. And you want to avoid them, right?"

"Yeah. If we keep wrecking their cars, they might sue us."

"If you keep wrecking their cars, you mean." Red Hood snorted. "And, please, never stop, I know it bothers him. He loves his toys."

The metahuman imagined himself in a courtroom, facing Batman and his group of teenagers, with a disappointed Nightwing serving as the judge. They'd show pictures of the first tank he'd destroyed, then explain he had also torn off a strap in Bruce Wayne's priceless designer car. He'd get fined for the damage. Peter hated going to court, last time ended with him having rotten eggs thrown at his windows.

No more destroying cars.

He jumped to another apartment building and sighed when he saw several snipers setting up at its top. He quickly adjusted his trajectory, hanging on to the underside of a gargoyle instead of landing in the middle of the group of gunmen.

"This isn't good," Jason whispered, stopping next to him and somehow holding onto the wall without any metahuman powers. "They aren't cops. They're planning something."

"You mean it's not normal to have snipers out at night?"

"Don't be a smartass, you know it isn't."

Peter grinned. It was difficult to feel anxious when he was wearing his suit, helping people and swinging at breakneck speed.

"I take left, you take right?" He offered. "Want to go stealth or brute force?"

He watched melted snow drip over his gloves, waiting for his teammate's answer. It took a while to come, and it was difficult to feel the man's emotions when he did talk.

"How good are you at stealth?"

"Very good."

One robotic sigh, one robotic grunt, then:

"Can you dodge bullets?"

He shrugged, still hanging from the tip of his fingers. Peter was an expert at shrugging in any kind of positions. He could do it while in a handstand, it was one of his best party tricks.

"Most of the time."

The Iron Spider deflected bullets so he hadn't had to do it in a while, but he was faster than projectiles. Ten or more people shooting at him at the same time could be a challenge, but even if they got a hit in, he healed so fast he would be back on his feet in hours and in top shape in days.

"Alright. Don't get hurt. You take left, I'll be on the right. Pick them off one by one. You're good with knots?"

"Yup."

Another advantage of enhanced dexterity. Jason handed him a bundle of rope and bunches of soft cloth.

"Tie them to the gargoyles, they won't break. But make sure no one's looking when you grab 'em."

"Ooo-kay," sung Peter. He had been through this situation many times.

"If you can't get them from the sides, get to the roof and stick to the shadows. Make sure they can't shoot and block their mouths so they don't scream. If you can, knock them out. If you can't, gag them and tie them up."

"Got it."

He listened to a few more words of advice he didn't need. Yes, he knew he should get a look at the scene before jumping in, yep he wasn't planning to let guns drop down and alert anyone. Yes, really, he was being serious, humming spy tunes under his breath was just his coping mechanism.

Pant pockets had their use. He stuffed them full of lengths of black rope, tucking them against his gas mask, and headed to the leftmost half of the building. He swung from gargoyle to windowsill then to gargoyle again. As he moved, he counted one sniper on every corner, and heard five other heartbeats beside them. Nine targets, all of them armed.

Peter took his time and waited, chest against the wall, right under sniper number one, a lady in expensive body-armor. Five minutes of utter stillness later, the perfect moment came and the middle group split off. Two went to talk on a radio, two were having a smoke break over on Jason's side, and the last was cleaning his gun. They weren't in a hurry to start shooting but he was in a hurry to subdue them before they noticed he was there.

He crawled up and reached the woman in a blink, wrenched the rifle free from her hand and sent it flying down onto a pile of trash bags. She opened her mouth to yell a warning but he moved faster and covered her lips with his hand, which startled her out of sounding the alarm. He used his other arm to drag her over the side and quickly forced both of her wrists behind her back, shoved a ball of cloth in her mouth, secured it to the back of her head then tied her to a nearby stone carving. She wriggled and fought but, unfortunately for her, he was much stronger and much faster than she was and had her neutralized in a moment.

She was stuck halfway down the building. Unless they were willing to jump, her colleagues wouldn't be able to free her.

The woman struggled against her gag, he sent her a warning look she wouldn't see because of his mask and swung himself over to sniper number two.

Five to ten seconds. After that, someone would notice she was gone or spot Jason's handiwork. His partner had moved in tandem with him, taking advantage of the opportunity he noticed. Seven enemies left.

He reached and grabbed number two as one of the chatting men yelped and called out.

"We got spooks!"

Footsteps sounded overhead, the whole group running to Red Hood's half of the roof. They wouldn't make it in time. He heard his teammate jump up on top of the building, creeping behind the startled mobsters.

Instead of abandoning his second sniper friend on a gargoyle, he stuffed his mouth with cloth, looped it around his hair and took him along on a brief freefall. A third of the way to the ground, he flipped forward and ran the rest of the way down the wall. Once he was solidly on the ground, he tied him up and dumped him on the dirty front steps. By a twist of fate, the criminal's gun landed close to him. He spent a second tearing it apart, keeping track of the noises coming from the roof. All four corners had been dealt with, now they had to pick off the five men left.

One of them was moving back to the radio. Peter crouched and jumped, at full strength. Chunks of stones flew away under his feet. By the time the rubble touched down, he was twisting in the air above the building, spotting every gunman and what direction they were facing. Red Hood had taken one out and was stalking a second woman, who stunk of fear. There was one guy at the radio, he hadn't spoken into it yet, and another watching his back. The last was touring the sides of the roof and looking down to spot threats. He wasn't good at it.

Peter took out his grappling gun and set it to maximum speed. This would take some precision to pull off but he had to act now. He shot the hook as he was falling, aiming at floor between the look-out and the radio guy, he moved so fast the whistling wind around him turned into a roar. Both his targets heard the sound of the hook hitting the stone but neither had a chance to react. Just before he reached them, he let the tool slip out of his fingers and stuck his hands on both of their back. They were dragged along with him, yelling. He bounced off the cement, turning his downward arc into another jump and landed across the street, on another building.

He slid, unable to stop and, for a second, feared he wouldn't be able to slow down before he fell off the structure. If he stuck his feet down, it would cut off his momentum. He could take it, but the two fragile regular humans could not. It wasn't an option.

Straining his chest and legs, he miraculously skidded to a stop moments before going over the edge. He didn't have time to relax. Already, one of the thugs tried to shoot him, the second vomited. He slammed both of them down onto the roof before they could get the opportunity to harm him.

"Really guys," he sighed, "you don't have to play hard to get."

Tying up one man without letting the other escape was an interesting experience. As he had before, he grabbed and destroyed their weapons. Who needed fire when you had enhanced strength? Fire wasn't a good super power, spider skills were much better.

Looking over at Jason, he saw that his friend had finished rounding up every enemy on the first roof so, with a shrug, he picked up the groaning crooks and jumped back.

"That was dramatic," said robot-Red Hood.

"Didn't want them to get a call out."

Peter dropped his two bundles of unhappy criminals next to the rest, who had been tied up individually and then again to each other. He let his teammate deal with them and their gear while he gathered the remaining prisoners and their discarded guns. By his second trip, Jason was crouching in front of the radio, by the third, he faced away from the disgruntled gangsters, helmet under his arm.

"We got some action in Crime Alley," he was saying, "you want us to start?"

"No, you moron," the radio spat out, the voice on the other side of the line crackling and distorted, "wait for your damn turn. You people are motherfucking idiots."

"Shut up," Jason growled. His voice was deeper than usual, and his accent heavier. "Not our fault you fuckers can't explain shit."

"Boss' whores're better at following orders than you assholes. Wait for the damn signal like everyone else."

The radio went silent.

Red Hood put his helmet back on.

He turned to Peter, then to the criminals.

"Alright," he said, "let's get them talking."
Notes:

    Peter has fun and goofs around. Jason suffers (he's not ready to have fun and goof around but he'll get there).
    Canon Spidey may not be a ballet dancer but hey I like Billy Elliot (I've never seen the musical tho, only the movie. I know, I know.)

    I'm spending some time planning the sequel. Now, a question for people who want to read it: would you rather I take a long break (3-6 months) during which I’d write 10-20 chapters then post them every week until I run out, or would you rather I write and post it chapter by chapter?

    Also... almost 200k words??
    I know this has no beta/editor so it's in need of trimming but still that's HUGE. so many words
    (to the people who offered to beta: i didnt forget u! ill reach out when i write the sequel if youre still interested)

Chapter Text

The back of his neck tingled, never a good sign.

It was nowhere near what he felt  in the middle of a fight or seconds before an accident. Still, he could feel it building up, steadily rising in intensity. Red Hood had the roof under control, but Peter wasn't exactly being the world's best prison guard at the moment. He was a bit distracted by an ominous sense of impending doom. 

He scanned up and down the street and found nothing on the nearby rooftops, but the alleyways below were busy. More vehicles than usual, it was New Year’s Eve and, clearly, Gothamites did not care whether or not their city led the United States in murder statistics. They were all armed and not a single person looked relaxed, but still, they went out to party.

The tingling spread to his entire head, dripped down to his shoulders. 

He looked back at Red Hood, who appeared to have finished his round of casual death threats and now held a sniper rifle in his hands. Peter wondered if he was going to steal it. His teammate had illegally rehomed Batman's own motorcycle so stealing a sniper rifle wasn’t that much of a stretch. But weapons like these one  didn’t seem like they could be used in any ventures other than murder and Jason didn’t really need that type of bad influence in his life.

"Stop making eyes at the gun,” Peter said.

"Can't help it," Red Hood replied, turning the rifle over in his hands, and no doubt making heart eyes at it under his helmet. "D'you even know how much this  is worth?" He tilted his head towards the group of tied up henchmen. "Either they're the best in the business or someone has a lot of money to burn."

"Well? Are they the best in the business?" Peter asked, hands on his hips. His eyes didn’t leave the snipers except to flick over the empty rooftops; if he followed his instincts, he’d have already leaped to the next building, dodging a blow that wasn’t coming. They were alone, and still , he felt the tingling all over his head and shoulders. 

"Nah. Not even close." Hood shrugged and walked over to kick one of the gunmen in the back of the knees. "I guess Jamie-boy here isn't too bad of a shot, not that he should even be back in the game with his wife and two kids." 

"Fuck you Hood,” said Jamie-boy, who had the privilege of not being gagged and was using it irresponsibly.

"Sounds like you guys are good friends,” Peter said. 

"Oh the best, until I left him to fend for himself. Poor little kitten couldn't find food when mama left, so he sold himself to the highest bidder."

Jamie said something rude, which earned him another kick.

Peter scanned the snipers again until his gaze fell on one, tied up to the side and shaking violently. He crouched in front of him, and as clear as day, felt his neck itch. The man’s eyes were unfocused, his sweat smelled odd. He was gagged and tied up, but Peter was suddenly sure that he was the source of the danger. Interesting. And worrying. Mostly worrying.

The sniper’s gag was soaked in drool. His emotions were hard to detect– there was a hint of fear there but a harsh chemical scent drowned out anything else. 

A very familiar harsh chemical scent. 

He'd last smelled it in a changing room and, before, kneeling in the snow, next to a dying man.

He stuck a hand on the gunman's chest and heaved him over his shoulder, holding him there as he straightened up.

"This guy's about to hulk out.” Peter said, stopping short at the edge of the rooftop. Bad phrasing. Hulk wasn’t a thing here. “Big muscle guy. Very angry. I'm taking him somewhere empty so he doesn't wreck the neighborhood."

"Wait the fuck up–" said  Red Hood, setting the sniper rifle down at last.

"I'll stay in touch over comms. You can finish up here, we don’t have much time.” Peter said, adjusting his grip on the man tied up over his shoulder. The twitching was getting more intense, on the verge of turning into spasms. Not much time indeed.

"Go to the shore." Red Hood said. "Stay away from the docks, go for the beach. Nobody'll be there. But don't get into the water. I’ll catch up.”

"Aye aye, sir!"

Peter  took his grappling gun out and aimed it towards the ocean. Going too fast may be harmful to the normal human on his shoulder but going too slow would definitely be harmful to every other soul in the vicinity. The first time he’d seen someone affected by Ace’s drug, they’d run through several buildings and caused dozens of deaths. The second time was with Bane and his modified venom. Neither ended well. He had to get away from the busy streets.

The closest beach was straight to the east, past one of the largest residential areas in North Gotham. Peter bounced from building to building, grappling onto statues and gothic spires to propel himself across the city. Each time he swung over a street or an alleyway, he dug his fingers deeper into his prisoner’s back. He was right to do so. The gunman waited for a particularly challenging jump, taking them past several streets at once, to tense up, struggling against his bonds. 

Peter heard the rope snap, felt the man’s arms move. At first, he assumed he was about to be dragged into another fight, still mid-air, still frantically jumping, grappling and running from roof to roof, but it didn’t take long to notice poor Mr. Gunman wasn’t trying to escape. He was writhing, grunting in pain, moaning names and words, strings of sentences. At this point, he probably wasn’t coherent enough to flee.

The chemical scent became harsher and, in turn, the sniper steadily grew in both size and strength. Peter had to catch himself mid-jump, grappling onto a nearby building instead of finishing his swing. His prisoner had doubled in weight and the small twitches that were at first easy to ignore had become violent spasms. Feets planted firmly on the ground to keep his balance. He used his powers to stick Mr. Gunman to his shoulder, holding him in place as he jerked left and right.

Under his feet, he heard civilians kicking off their New Year’s Eve party. In the distance, he spotted a group of teenagers waiting by a bus stop. Bystanders were everywhere. He still remembered the buildings collapsing, the smell of dust, the feel of it sticking to his throat. 

He had to keep moving.

Back up in the air, he spotted the ocean in the distance, only a few streets away. As Jason promised, the beach looked empty. He swung a few more times, using a sturdy streetlamp to vault over the sand, and landed in a crouch.

Whoever decided to build an artificial beach in Gotham, where the waters were so toxic they spontaneously pickled the local fishes, was an idiot and a terrible businessman. However, their lack of foresight was useful when it came to super powered fights. The place was completely deserted and Peter couldn't see a single vulnerable building in the vicinity.

He set Mr. Gunman down as close to the water as he could without touching it. It'd take at least a minute for a human in peak physical condition to sprint back to the streets, leaving plenty of time for him to intervene. The man was still growing in size, so Peter couldn't trap him right away; he'd burst right out of his bonds or, worse, die from being improperly tied up. Cutting off blood flow was pretty serious and he didn't plan on performing any amputations that night.

"I'm there,” he said into his comms.

"Copy,” replied Jason, and from his voice, it sounded like things were going well on his end.

The rest of his sentence was muffled, as a scream rang out in the air.

Without warning, Mr. Gunman's back arched over the ground, his skin rippled as the muscles underneath swelled. Peter heard several of his bones crack. He took his last borrowed rope out. There wasn't much of it left but he should be able to tie up his opponent with it. He'd oriented him towards the opposite side of the beach, to make him run across its length rather than heading straight for the houses full of squishy civilians. He needed the henchman in a decent physical state to give himself time to analyze his blood and come up with an antidote.

“Everything alright?” Jason asked.

“Everything’s under control,” Peter said. “Gimme a minute.”

Then, he tapped his ear, turning off the comms channel.

"Alright buddy, don’t panic, it'll all be over soon, we'll get you to a lab. A legal one, this time."

Mr. Gunman moaned. 

It wasn't a good moan nor was it a fun moan. 

It was a “ I'm in so much pain I want to die” moan . 

Peter held onto his optimism. No smashing houses meant this one test subject would be in a much better shape. Perhaps the formula had been perfected since then– maybe he only needed to spend the rest of tonight finding a way to turn him back to normal.  

The sniper’s back relaxed abruptly, he slumped into the ground, groaned and shook his head. His eyes, wide open, twitched up to stare at the moon. Under his chin, his neck and chest were swallowed by a mass of muscles. There was another twitch, this time purposeful. Mr. Gunman turned his head to the side, his gaze found Peter’s. Much like Bane, his mass belied his speed, and he was on his feet in the blink of an eye.

Peter expected him to start running but, to his surprise and slight disapproval, Mr. Gunman decided to swing at him instead. It was pretty easy to dodge, a clumsy punch that Peter sidestepped without having to think much about it.

"You don't need to be so aggressive." He said with a sigh.  "Last guy was much nicer." 

He was also dead. Mr. Gunman was already pretty agitated so Peter decided not to mention it.

"Really, I like your enthusiasm but we need to wrap this up." He ducked under a shaky slap that had enough power behind it to send him flying into the ocean. "You don't look too good, buddy. It's no fun if you make yourself sick."

He jumped over the next punch, flipping in the air and landing behind his opponent. Before the man had a chance to react, Peter grabbed his left wrist and twisted it back, looping the rope around it. Of course, he couldn't get the other hand right away, as it was still in the process of punching the air where he'd been standing moments before. Mr. Gunman had super strength but he didn't have super speed.

"Behind you, big guy!" Peter called, and he jumped  up to stick his feet to the man's back. 

The taunt worked instantly. Peter gritted his teeth through one of the roughest rodeos of his life. Thanks to his powers, the violent bucking wasn't enough to throw him off. Under his fingers, he felt skin straining on the gunman’s arm and realized that it wouldn't be long before the muscles grew so large the poor guy ripped himself apart.

The man, now giant, decided to stop bucking and changed tactics to using his free arm to catch him, a classic blunder. Peter wasted no time grabbing this new hand and adding it to his collection. He used his enhanced strength to force the man's wrists close and quickly tied them together with a square knot.

Next, he had to get to the legs, which–

The back of his neck tingled, and at once, when he felt the urge to jump. He followed his instincts, pushed against the giant’s back, and let go of the rope just in time to avoid being turned into a spider pancake. Mr. Gunman smashed his back into the ground with extreme prejudice, but Peter had already landed a few paces away, right in the shallows. 

“Shit,” he muttered, scrambling out of the water, but Jason’s pants were in one piece and surprisingly waterproof. Was there anything the Bats didn’t consider when they built their equipment?

Mr. Gunman was laid out on the ground. Unfortunately, he was on his back when he needed him to be on his stomach. Peter started forward, this wasn’t anything a little super strength couldn’t fix.

Or perhaps not. Mr. Gunman, out of desperation, reacted quicker than before and managed to twist to the side and stand back up, hands still tied behind his back, rope dangling between his legs. His clothes were torn and his skin had split in several places, uncovering a mess of blood, fat and uncontrollable muscle growth.

"You probably don't want to go that way," said Peter, pointing at the ocean behind him. "Heard the water's real bad around these parts."

His good advice was ignored, but he was used to it at that point. The giant sprinted right at him, head first like a bull. Peter took off as well. Better to meet the man head on than let him be melted to death by Gotham’s toxic waters. The wet sand wasn't the best terrain for running but he had superpowers on his side. He was well away from the water before his opponent reached him.

Being tackled by a metahuman was not a pleasant experience. Being the metahuman in question meant that Peter hadn’t felt it yet in this world. He wasn’t about to start now. He caught Mr. Gunman mid-sprint and, wrapping his arms around his midsection, he heaved and lifted the giant into the air. Using his momentum against him, he started to spin.

He didn’t feel disoriented as he spun faster and faster. When he was  facing away from the ocean again, he threw the man up in the air. Mr. Gunman flew upwards in a beautiful arc, and Peter leaped, moments behind. Before a second had passed, he’d already jumped over his opponent and aimed his webshooters at his legs. He triggered his webs mid-flip, head towards the sand, feet and knees up towards the sky, finding the move just as easy now as it had been a month prior.

The two of them hit the ground, Peter in a crouch after completing his flip, the giant bound in webbing.  The rope around Mr. Gunman’s wrists was now connected to a thick net trapping both his legs and his lower chest. It'd dissolve in a few hours' time, by then they should have had plenty of time to find another way to restrain him.

He pressed a finger to his ear. "Got him."

Red Hood's robotic voice replied: "Good job. I’m on my way.”

Peter straightened up. Mr. Gunman was struggling still, the back of his head dug into the ground as he kept moving from side to side, unable to free himself from the webbing. The drug was affecting him, his muscles hadn’t stopped growing and his skin had torn along his arms and neck. Grains of sand stuck to his flesh, guaranteeing a nasty infection. Peter picked him up, walking away from the ocean and towards the unappealing concrete stairs leading out of the beach. 

“Don’t worry, big guy, we’ll get you sorted out.”

There was no reply, at least not a coherent one. The man muttered names, in between each gasp and scream, they always came back like a prayer.

When he tried to ask him who these people were, the only reply was a sob.

Halfway to the stairs, he spotted Jason landing atop a massive devil statue, itself overlooking the ruins of an abandoned ice cream shop. Peter, impatient, didn't wait for him to get to the beach. He ran forward, jumped in the air and aimed his grappling gun a few feet off from the ominous statue.

"The hell's that white stuff?" Red Hood asked , before Peter  even touched down on the shop's roof. The sniper rifle from before had found a home strapped to his back, but no time to worry about that now. 

"Webbing," Peter replied. "What's a good laboratory to break into?"

Jason stood, just watching, and in the silence, Mr. Gunman stirred a little. This simple movement caused a ripple over his skin, tissue breaking apart to reveal muscle underneath, blood dripping onto the concrete. Jason crossed his arms, his silence made eerie by the featureless red helmet, but when Peter opened his mouth to hurry him along, he finally said, his tone flat, “You can cure him?”  

He shrugged. "Wouldn't be my first time working against the clock.”

Peter didn't have his alternate selves with him to bounce ideas and ask questions to, but he couldn't fail. He'd already had to watch someone die due to this drug, and he refused to let it happen again.

Jason uncrossed his arms and snorted. "Fucking figures. There’s S.T.A.R Labs and WayneTech, but they both have tight security."

"Won't do. I'll need to be there a while."

"Everything else is shady or out of the city. Gotham has a bad track record of labs exploding.”

Jason dropped down from the devil’s head to walk back and forth in the snow. He stopped, shook his head, then started pacing again. Any minute they spent thinking was time they could’ve spent finding a cure. 

 Peter glanced down at Mr. Gunman, at the blood slowly dripping down into the snow, and the dark red was stark against the white. The giant’s eyes were still unfocused, but now they were glazed with pain, with a slight sheen of tears. He shifted again, testing the ropes, and skin split down his neck. The man groaned, a low rumble, and still, Jason was pacing. 

Peter clenched his hands into fists and said, his tone sharp, “We don’t have time for this, Hood.”

Jason stilled. When he spoke, he spoke slowly. “Batman has a place nearby.”

"Please tell me you aren't thinking about breaking into his headquarters.”

"Not his headquarters, that's too dangerous. He has a network of smaller caves around the city. I used one for some time, he hasn't been checking on them as much lately, figure he picked up too many strays or some shit." He shook his head. "Security is tight too but at least we won't get shot."

The longer they waited, the more the man on Peter's shoulder suffered. Another bone snapped in Mr. Gunman’s leg, and he screamed, the noise deafening. Peter clenched his jaw, dread pooling in his stomach. The drug was having a worse effect on the sniper than what he’d seen before. What was a little antagonizing of the Bats if he saved this man’s life? He had the opportunity to help someone, so he had the responsibility to do it, he knew that. 

So, he took out his grappling gun and turned to Jason. "Let's go. He doesn't have long."

"Fuck. Sure, yeah. Follow me."

Red Hood was fast, he knew how to use grappling guns extremely well, but he was still only human. Peter kept his frustration in check as he jumped after him, matching his pace swing for swing. In any case, maybe going too fast would cause more harm than good, as he currently had a passenger with him.

They kept to the seaside, exiting the docks area and moving into a residential district. Civilians  stood outside of buildings, smoking, talking and drinking together, all in an excellent mood. He wanted to scream at them to go back inside because, although his spider sense had quietened, it still rumbled distantly at the back of his head. The main danger had been dealt with for now but there was more coming. 

Did he have time to stop and warn them? No, this was more important.

But he could save more lives...

He was mid jump when he suddenly noticed something horrifying.

The gunman on his shoulder wasn't twitching anymore.

When did he stop? Why wasn't Peter paying more attention? He was distracted by the civilians, he’d slipped up and now–

He slid along the side of a sloped roof, jumped and stuck to the edge of another massive spire. As fast as he could without hurting him, he slid the giant off his shoulder and set him down on the flat stone edge. 

Mr. Gunman wasn't breathing. His clothes were torn into rags, some stuck inside of his body, trapped in between muscle and bone, some resting on the few bits of skin he had left. What was Peter thinking, taking him to a lab? He should be in the hospital.

"We need to get him to a doctor,” he said without thinking.

It wouldn't work, it was too late. The chemicals were too much. They’d killed him.

What could he do? His mind spun frantically, but he couldn’t give up, he couldn’t let the man die, couldn’t watch another person pass away in front of him. Jason grappled to the spire a second later, staring at them. Before he could speak, Peter turned sharply and said, “Electricity. I need a shock weapon.”

Jason dug into his jacket pocket to pull out a handful of gadgets, grenades, small mines, and tiny pellets. “They’re not calibrated for first aid.” 

But Peter took them anyway because that didn’t matter. He felt like time slowed down as he shuffled through the items, his mind rushing ahead in leaps and starts. His hands started working before he was consciously aware of what he was doing. He broke the shell of the mine, tweaked the insides just so, and tore off pieces from the gadgets, readjusting the triggers, limiting the output. Didn’t matter if he shocked himself, if there was blowback, he couldn’t let the man die. 

Even with enhanced speed, maybe it hadn’t been fast enough. Jason stepped forward, but Peter walked around the sniper, keeping Red Hood at his back. If the device exploded, he would rather be the one to take the full blow. He could heal, he’d be fine.

His fingers twitching slightly, he placed the modified mine on Mr. Gunman’s chest, and only hesitated for a second before he activated it with a simple tap. 

Peter stared, hardly breathing, but there wasn’t any smoke or arcs of energy, just the small crackle of electricity. The giant's chest rose as the first charge hit him, twitched once more after the second. For a moment, it looked like he was alive again, like every involuntary spasm was an attempt to catch his breath.

He wasn't. Peter crouched there, hands numbs, blood on his gloves and shoulders, and he watched his machine try to pump life into a corpse.

No. No. This couldn't happen again. He’d failed to save the civilians against Firefly. He’d failed to save the first test subject he met. He’d failed to dispose of Bane without breaking him apart. And now, this was yet another failure to add to the list. 

His mind wouldn't slow down, he had to act, had to do something, anything. He  grabbed the bottom of his mask and pulled it up, drawing a deep breath to begin CPR. He reached for Mr. Gunman’s chest, his hands forming the right shape to push air into the man’s lungs, but Jason, quicker than Peter would’ve thought possible for a regular human, grabbed his shoulder and held him in place. 

“He’s dead, Spider-Man.”

"No,” Peter said, shoving Jason’s hand aside. "Not yet. I haven't tried everything."

There was still a chance to save him.

Jason didn’t try to pull him back a second time, and Peter was free to disable and remove the mine, free to switch to cardiac massage, send air into the man's split lips, feel for a pulse that wasn't there, that he couldn't feel under the layers of tissue. Again and again, always sticking to the same rhythm.

He listened for a pulse that didn’t return, no matter how many times he tried. He felt a strange weight bear down on his own chest. He didn't know how long he’d spent stuck in this cycle when finally, he leaned back on his heels. 

The sky was dark, the moon was high over his head and sometime recently, it’d started to snow.

 It’d snowed last New Year’s Eve in New York City. He and Aunt May had watched the snowfall. He’d opened one of the windows while Aunt May popped open a single bottle of champagne. The good kind for once. 

“Why not?” she’d said with that mischievous smile of her’s. “This is going to be a good year. A great year for us.” 

He closed his eyes, clenching his fists. He heard Jason walk forward, stand behind him for a second, and then sit down by his side. 

“He’s dead,” Peter said. Of course he was. He’d been dead all along. 

Another person he failed to save.

"Yeah,” said Jason. "We can–"

"I need to take a blood sample. This is the second time we’ve seen it and…” He trailed off. 

"It'll happen again,” Jason said.

They stood. The gunman seemed much smaller in death. Peter forced himself to unclench his fists before his fingers tore the gloves apart, forced himself to take a deep breath, lower his tensed shoulders. Bad things happened. Bad things would keep happening. He'd learned that lesson, he needed to move forward. He couldn't stop every time the universe spat in his face, he had to make May proud, had to make Tony and Uncle Ben proud. Them and everyone else who'd died while he survived.

This new version of the drug took less than fifteen minutes to kill. He needed to have a syringe ready the next time he encountered one of these giants. Doing otherwise would be condemning them to a slow, painful death, 

"Let's get to that cave. I have to find an antidote."

"Alright,” said Red Hood. "We can take him on the bike."

"No. I'll carry him."

The corpse was huge. To Peter, it should feel as light as a feather. But somehow, as he picked up the body, it felt heavier than it should be. It weighed on his shoulder as he pulled out his grapple, and he was all too aware of the silence as he swung through the streets. Someone started setting off fireworks in the distance, sparks flying into the sky and exploding, breaking the eerie stillness. Peter could smell the residue, his every sense working overtime. He forced himself to take another deep breath and tried to set it all aside. He’d failed. He had to do more next time. That was the end of it, should be the end of it.

It took them less than a minute to get to a sewer entrance. He could see the spire from here, could see the place where the sniper had died just a moment before. So close. Yes, they would’ve had to break through security measures just to get inside, they couldn’t have gotten right to curing him. But still, they’d been right there… It stung.

“Scram,” Jason said.

 Nearby civilians were already hurrying away, leaving a smell of alcohol and weed in their wake. Between that and the stench of blood, Peter would rather focus on the alcohol.

“Bit out of the way for a party,” he said, trying for a calm, casual tone, like there wasn’t a giant corpse on his shoulder. 

"People hang out here because it's clean."

Jason’s helmet doubled as a flashlight and he turned it on now as they descended, stepping directly into shallow, ice cold water. Unlike the ocean, it was pure and didn’t try to gnaw at their shoes and pants. Peter could smell minerals, not metal. This water hadn’t gone through pipes, and in fact, the tunnel didn’t look very much like a sewer. Jason had mentioned a cave, which he’d assumed was a fancy way of describing a hideout, but now, as he looked at the rough surface of the walls peaking through underneath the bricks, he began to rethink that theory. And if Batman really did live in a cave as cold and as dark as this one, he had to be a metahuman.  

“Decoy sewer?” he asked as he followed Jason into the dark.

“Yeah,” Jason said. “Some civilians found out they could use the water without getting chemical burns or having side-effects, so the bastard closed it down.”

Despite the body weighing on his shoulder, Peter’s mind couldn’t stop working over the problem of the Bat. What kind of person had the money to create decoy sewers? Did Batman go in and build it himself brick by brick? Or did he find and repurpose the area, cutting off the original water flow and replacing it with a clean source? 

"Anyway… Don’t worry about supplies, the cave will have all the shit you need. Dickhead keeps them stocked,  like they’re fucking survival bunkers." Jason tapped the side of his helmet with a finger. "I'll keep the Bats off your back while you work."

"Thanks." 

They both lapsed into silence, and Peter was grateful for it, for a few minutes. Then, his mind turned back to the body on his shoulder, slowly stiffening, blood flow slowing. Just look around, he told himself.  

There were small fishes in the water, swimming against their ankles. None of them showed obvious mutations or disfiguration, they didn't have teeth and their eyes didn't glow red. By Gotham standards, they were a miracle. Looking at them should have sent him into a nerd out, he didn’t have the motivation for it currently. His brain wouldn’t shut up. He needed an antidote.

He felt a strange energy run through him, a nervous kind of energy, and he said, his voice echoing a little in the tunnel, “Were they trying to trap Batman?”

Red Hood’s helmet lit up a crystal clear waterfall up ahead. Jason plunged forward into the water without answering right away. Peter followed, shifting the body on his shoulder. They were a little more than knee deep now, and he braced himself as he stepped through the waterfall. The ground rose up in a slope, taking them over the flow of icy water. 

"The snipers you mean?” Jason said at last, and he glanced over his shoulder. “This guy might’ve been their last resort.”

"If we didn't show up, he may not have used the drug."

"Maybe." Jason shrugged. "But then maybe one of them would’ve shot a Bat in the head, or a cop, or a civilian. They're part of something bigger."

"They are.” The criminal on the radio had said they were supposed to wait for a signal. Were there other teams just like this one dispatched across Gotham? How many of them would resort to using Ace's deadly chemicals? Without an antidote, Peter couldn't save them, but if they were planning on shooting civilians...

"Think the Bats can keep it together for the next couple hours?" he asked.

Red Hood shrugged. "Usually I'd say yes, but tonight's special. They don't have everyone out."

"Because you shot Red Robin in the arm.”

"No, way more than that. That little fucker isn't that important." Jason stopped in the middle of the tunnel, turned towards the left wall. “What do you care about him anyway?” 

“It just proves my point.” Peter said, his tone flat. “Fighting other vigilantes leads to situations like this one, where we don’t have enough people to take care of the city.”

“Whatever.”

Jason stomped deeper into the tunnel, picking up the pace, but Peter had no trouble keeping up. He knew he wasn’t supposed to needle the Red Hood, knew it was wrong, but some part of him just didn’t care right now. He felt angry, sad, frustrated. All these emotions mixed together and led to an overwhelming urge to move, fight, scream.

“What do you even know about the Bats?” Jason asked, once Peter caught up. “Half of them are child soldiers, and Batman? He’s a coward. Can’t get the job done when the city needs him to. Tonight’s his fuck up, not mine.”

Peter opened his mouth to yell at him, only to feel a shift against his shoulder. The last of the air that had been trapped in the corpse’s lungs came out in a small moan. It sounded so close to a death rattle it brought him back to the present, to the situation at hand. He looked down at the ground. In the dark, he could barely see his reflection in the puddle of water that formed by his feet. His silhouette looked huge, bloated by the shape of the dead man he carried.

What the hell was he doing getting into a fight with Jason now? What was wrong with him?

They stood in silence for another few seconds before continuing onward. Neither of them spoke again until Jason stopped abruptly in the tunnel and stared at the wall. "We're here."

There was nothing different about this segment of the fake sewers. Peter held back a few steps, trying to use his enhanced senses to detect anything amiss. He spotted a stronger scent of metal, and though it wasn't intense, it was quite unusual.

Jason pressed his hand on one stone, then another, and after five more different taps, he gave one last solid push. The wall moved slowly, sliding open in the shape of a door. Its panel was so heavy, it took Jason a full thirty seconds to open it fully. 

“Need help?” Peter asked. 

“Nope,” Jason said shortly. “The system’s on standby, but it’ll all go to shit if we trigger the alarm. Stay behind me and don’t touch the walls. Watch where I step.” 

Peter nodded.

This next tunnel segment took them over the water again, though this time they weren’t required to step in it.  Batman had settled on grates instead of a proper floor, which rattled as he walked up to it, weighed down by the corpse. What was the point behind a grate floor instead of a normal one? He was starting to get a sneaking suspicion that the Bat had a flair for the dramatic. 

His suspicion was heightened as they walked further into a dark room with no end in sight and no lights other than Jason’s helmet. He felt cold air, like wind, hitting his suit. How large was this cave system exactly? If he focused, he could hear small animals, small heartbeats far away in the distance.

“And this is only the antechamber or whatever,” Jason whispered. “ The real entrance is further up ahead.” 

“Is he paranoid or something?” Peter asked in a low voice. 

“Very,” Jason replied, his voice coming over the comms more than anything else. “With Batman, always assume there’s a dozen different levels of security, at the very least.” 

“How are we supposed to get in then?” Peter said, impatience rising again.

Jason walked forward slowly, taking great care to avoid entire sections of the grated floor. Peter copied him as closely as possible, sometimes adjusting the corpse on his shoulder to make the jumps between safe sections.

Escaping the pits was one thing, this time they were deep into hostile territory, and without a nice distracting rogue gallery for the police to arrest. If the Bats came in ready for a  fight, he wasn't sure he’d be able to keep holding onto the body. Not to mention this whole thing would also be a huge waste of time, something they did not have a lot of.

"We’ll be fine, as long as we handle this right." Red Hood took an item out of his jacket and said, "This baby here got me into his main cave, so, it's good enough to get in this one.”

The item looked like a tiny hard drive, connected to an even tinier cable. Being Jason's, it was bright red with a skull engraved at its center. When he wasn't so busy jumping from step to step, seemingly going down into the pit of hell with a giant dead man on his back, Peter would have loved to get a closer look at it.

 Red Hood’s helmet shone on another door, which seemed to appear out of nowhere in the wall. Peter reigned in his nervous energy as his friend connected the drive to a computer that had been invisible until he tapped it with a finger. They waited for a second as the screen went from pale blue to red before blinking back to blue. After a nerve wracking silence, during which the room went completely dark, save for the helmet’s light, the door panel opened, still leading into the darkness.

Jason held his hand up. "Wait here a moment."

He held up his grappling gun, shot it into the shadows. Peter heard him move across a wide open space, landing briefly on a metallic surface, higher up than the ground, before he zipped off to the left. There were another few sounds: a thunk, then a low grinding noise.

At once, lights turned on, hitting Peter with the mother of all sensory overloads. He cursed and rubbed his eyes through the mask. It was a miracle he hadn't dropped the dead gunman. What kind of dangerous sociopath decided to almost blind himself every time he stepped into his hideouts?

"We're good!" Jason called. 

Peter stepped inside.

This cave did not deserve being called small, and if this had been his hideout, Peter would’ve made it his primary headquarters. He had an inkling Batman was rich, what with his Bruce Wayne conspiracy theory, but this was taking it to another level. This was Tony Stark level equipment, put on stand by and left behind simply because Batman thought the location had a few issues. An old money mentality if he’d ever seen one. 

Peter stepped closer to a nearby table in the cave, his eyes widening as he stared at the multiple bat-shaped throwing weapons laid out, as neatly as if they’d been lined up with a ruler. There wasn’t any dust on them, and he was suddenly sure that if he reached out and nudged a single one out of place, Batman would know someone had been here. 

The sound of a keyboard clicking made Peter look up and at the rest of the cave. Much like the corridor he'd been in previously, the cave was not built on solid ground but instead set up over an underground river, much larger than what he'd seen in the sewers. The floor was twice as large as Aunt May’s apartment and it was separated into different areas. Close to the entrance and to the left, Peter noticed a medical station, which itself seemed to double as an improvised hospital room, with several chairs, machines and lockers pressed up against the wall. 

Jason himself was standing in front of a massive computer. He’d inserted his  drive into the central column and was staring intently at a variety of screens. Many of them showed active crime scenes, and another was plugged directly into the GCPD's security cameras. 

Peter headed to the med-bay first, dropping the poor gunman onto the operating table. Rummaging through the cupboards, he managed to find a phlebotomy kit in pristine condition. As with the odd bat-weapons, there wasn’t a speck of dust here.

“Hey,” he said, “someone’s been here recently.”

Red Hood pressed a button on the keyboard and switched the display over to a series of case files before turning to Peter. "I'll buy you time. Get as much done as you can."

And with that, Jason got to typing, using a language Peter didn't recognize. He sent a glance at the entrance, which had closed automatically, then at the further end of the platform. There was a boat there, as well as a clear way further into the underground. The river led somewhere. From what Jason had said, there were several interconnected caves under Gotham. How far would they have to go to find the main one?

Peter  shook himself and walked back to the corpse. Death had set in, which made it difficult to draw blood. He ended up having to improvise with the collection of medical equipment around him, getting a few decent samples. His poor costume was covered in blood from boots to mask. 

There was no AI, no nanobots, but everything in the cave was state of the art. Still, it took him a while to get his bearings and find the machine he was looking for. The Bats weren't content with a simple microscope, they had to turn it into a massive computer with a hundred different functionalities. It wasn't the same as Tony's but it was just as dramatic in its own way. Like trying to make a swiss pocket knife out of life saving medical equipment. 

While the computer worked on the first blood sample, he jogged back to the operating table and, after a long moment, managed to talk himself into taking a muscle tissue sample. This would be just as if not more important than the blood.

"I'm sorry,” he told the body as he took the sample, before returning to the med-bay computer.

The software took a second to get used to, it was nothing like what he'd used before, but he eventually figured out how to enter a sort of free camera mode. Now he had a choice between a traditional slide view or a 3D camera. Not as good as Stark Industries but still pretty useful.

He quickly found traces of the toxin, both in the victim's blood and muscles. The gunman had been deceased for some time now, long enough that his cells were dying. In comparison, the chemicals were remarkably healthy, still spreading.

Not only spreading. He narrowed in on a corner.

They were reproducing.

He leaned back with a frown. If he was dealing with a living organism, that'd change everything about his approach. He had to confirm this,  find another instance... Was there a rewind function on the computer? There had to be. Now, how did he–

The screen went black. The whole cave went black.

“Fuck,” cursed Jason. "Get onto the boat,” he said, which meant his escape route most likely involved an ill advised amount of traveling in ice cold water. 

Peter sighed and hurried over because, sadly he had experience being thrown in the ocean. Those things just happened when crime fighting in New York. A trip on a boat through toxic sewers wouldn’t be his worst encounter with sea travel.

"No need,” said a voice.

With his back turned, Peter didn't see the exact moment the screens turned back on. He did, however, notice the change in lighting. The complete darkness was shattered as every computer screen lit up at once. Instead of pale blue or neutral, they were now green.

Jason cursed again. It was a common occurrence.

"Oracle,” he said through gritted teeth, “Didn't know this was one of yours."

"I did tell you someone was there recently,” Peter said, crossing his arms. Even after their little chat earlier, he felt like being a smartass.

Red Hood glared at him through his helmet, but since he wasn't running to the boat, it was hopefully safe to stick around for a while longer.

"It's a recent development,” said Oracle, in a voice so heavily filtered it made it near impossible to pick up any identifying information. "Now, may I ask why you're delivering corpses to my cave?"

"We didn't kill him,” said Jason right away. 

Peter shifted his weight from side to side, feeling another incoming disaster.

"The man was under the influence of some kind of toxin,” he said, very quickly, before Oracle ordered a Bat to burst in through the ceiling and tase them into oblivion. "We're here to find out what it was and make an antidote."

"I see. I trust you remember the first time you encountered this type of mutation?"

Several screens switched to pictures of a massive dead body, laid out in the snow. The man’s skin was damaged, but it had only torn in a few places. Peter leaned forward, staring at it, trying to spot more differences. The muscle groups developed differently too, but that may be merely a biological difference. Still, he seemed smaller. Much smaller than Mr. Gunman. 

The new formula was more potent and, as a consequence, more deadly. And what was more, the first version killed its users, though it allowed them to move for longer before death. Peter imagined a worse case scenario, a toxin able to give people the strength of gods for a split second before killing them instantly. He'd always thought there was a cap to these types of enhancements, but in this new universe, he wasn't so sure.

"Hold up,” said Jason, as he tapped the computer with his foot. "You're trying to work with us? Aren't you still in leagues with the furry brigade?"

Bold words for a man who had once been part of the furry brigade himself. Peter spared some time to give him a pointed look before turning back to the pictures. Other than the size difference between the two test subjects, the old formula was unbalanced, causing different parts of the body to swell, notably the neck, which led to suffocation. The new version of the toxin was more balanced.

"I've heard good things about your associate," Oracle said. "And I can see what you were working on."

At the left of the current display, two more screens blinked on. Peter recognized the muscle and blood sample he was analyzing. The scene had evolved. The toxin spread, but instead of causing the blood and muscle to mutate, it was now attacking them. The ferocity of it made him think of acid. He couldn't imagine the level of pain these men went through, if they were able to feel it on such a molecular level.

"Huh. Okay. That's fucked up." Jason said. "We're pulling out of this."

"No,” Peter said sharply. "There could be more like him tonight. We can't ignore this.”

There was no way he’d back down now. He'd seen another man die, he'd carried him across the city, he still had his blood on his suit. Giving up now was simply inconceivable– it was Peter’s responsibility to see this through.

Jason turned his back to the computer, leaning against the desk to look him in the eyes. He still had his helmet on.

"The guy behind this is someone I want to stay away from. This is my condition, remember. No investigating this one. I don't want to get his attention."

Peter narrowed his eyes. This suit wasn't so intricate that the mask moved depending on his expression, but his posture conveyed his emotions. He straightened up, walked closer to Jason, fists clenched.

"You're lying. I've seen you run into a collapsing building to save civilians. You wouldn't ignore danger like this just because you're afraid." He tilted his head. "You're planning to work on it without me."

Jason wanted whoever was behind the toxin to stay away from Peter, and his friend confirmed it by cursing again, leaning further against the computer. The screen directly behind him shifted, pushed backwards. 

"Hell no! You're too fucking optimistic. If I go against this guy it's because I hate his guts, not because I want to save anyone. And if I want you to stay out of it, it's because he's mine to kill. I don't want any interference."

He sounded pretty convincing, his posture matched his words, tense like he was about to kick him in the teeth. Peter wasn't fooled. Jason returned to vigilantism willingly; he still cared about saving people, even if it was at the cost of his own life.

"We agreed on no casualties,” he said, because pointlessly arguing over good intentions would get them nowhere.

Jason shook his head. "Only if you didn't investigate. This changes things. If I see the fucker, I'm blowing his brain out. We're staying away." He hit the top of a green screen with the back of his hand. "Fuck off, Oracle, we're out."

A man had just died, more would be killed in the same way soon, and Jason was holding back precious information. Peter hadn't felt this angry in a while, he hadn't felt this much in a while in fact. Tonight, for the first time since May’s death, the veil was slowly lifting, and his emotions were rising to the surface. Feeling angry now, rather than numb, felt too soon after May’s death, but then, it would’ve always have felt too soon, even decades later. 

"Who is it?" he asked, and he sounded a lot calmer than he felt. 

"Are you fine with me shooting him then?"

"Right now we shouldn't be worried about killing him or not. We need to stop this–" he waved at the operation table, at the corpse on it. "–before it kills more people. We're already involved, we've started investigating. We can't turn back."

Jason stood up, kicking the computer's chair as he walked by it. 

"You're a stubborn fucking idiot." He didn't walk all the way to the boat, stopping midway and then turning on his heels. He put his hands behind his head, wrapped around the back of his helmet, and sighed. "You're going to get yourself killed, unless you listen to me carefully."

Peter gave him a chance to explain before yelling, but he was quickly running out of patience. They did not have the time for this type of argument. In fact, he was about to tell Jason to let him get back to work. Lives were on the line.

"If we're doing this, you need to do exactly as I say. When I say run, you run. When I say hide, you hide. I don't care if you can punch this dude's head clean off his shoulders; if he survives the fight, he won't ever stop coming for you." Red Hood laughed, which translated into a series of harsh, robotic sounds. "People don't always stay dead either. You don't want him as an enemy."

A dozen more screens blinked on, bright green.

"Joker will come for him eventually,” said Oracle.

They both jumped. While arguing, they'd managed to forget they weren't alone.

"It doesn’t matter if he doesn't antagonize him,” Oracle continued, “ he'll still be targeted. He's a vigilante in Gotham and he's connected to you. Even if it's as a civilian, because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, he'll have to face him eventually."

Jason turned back to the computer, marching over to it and slamming his fist on the desk.

"Which won't be a problem when he's dead! If any of you cowards had the balls to do it, we'd be rid of him already!" He glared at Peter. "But when I try, I get stopped, like everyone's not dreaming of ending him."

Peter barely noticed his outburst. He was lost in thought, remembering everything he’d learned about that name.

Joker. 

Peter knew about the Joker. He'd read his name in Barbara's pamphlet, watched documentaries, and read news articles online. A long time criminal, sometimes a mob boss, other times a spree killer, always a mass murderer. He used toxins, which fit the pattern, and he was cruel, which made Peter wonder whether the lethal side effects of the drug were designed on purpose. 

He understood why Jason wanted him to stay away from the case, because Joker seemed bent on destroying everything he touched. Peter had met Harley, who'd been in a relationship with him, and the state it left her in told him enough to despise the man. He'd seen reports of entire schools being poisoned because of him. 

Jason was wrong. He wasn't the type of person to hide from monsters. It was a vigilante’s duty to fight them, their responsibility.

"Oracle is right, I'll have to meet him eventually." Peter stopped for a second and then said. "I'll listen to you though. You know a lot more about him than I do."

"Don’t I just?" And Jason laughed again, but there wasn’t any humor in it.
Notes:

    First! Welcome back!

    Second! We have a beta/editor: death to pineapples.
    As some of you may know, I'm not a native English speaker so her help was invaluable. She helped a lot with this chapter, whether it be grammar, pacing or just cool story ideas. Thanks again! She'll be working with me on finishing up part 1 :)

    Third!! We have more fanart! Please give these artists some love.

    Peter by Almost All the Clouds: Peter fanart
    Check out their blog for some more cool art: Tumblr

    Spider-Man's future suit, by Guest Man: Suit Art /// Badass action shot
    Check out his gallery for more awesome Spidey fanart: Flickr // Tumblr // Imgur

    Fourth!! The repost is down! Thank you SO MUCH to everyone who helped report it. Special shout out to the bee movie person, you made me laugh.
    -> As I said earlier, the original chap 39 will be deleted and archived here.

    Fifth!! We're well into the final arc of part 1! Part 2 will take a little bit to come but hopefully not too much.
    -> I'm planning on going back and doing an overall edit of this story, as the earliest chapters are a bit rough (my English really wasn't the best back then).

    Sixth!! If you're one of the other people who offered to beta, please feel free to contact me on my blog.
    Old version of chapter 39
