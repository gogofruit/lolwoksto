Summary:

    An unknown Jujutsu Kaisen fan becomes Sukuna. He tries to change the future, but will anyone trust the King of Curses?

Notes:

    Inspired by SIkuna accidentally scares the absolute hell out of an injured teenager and his concerned teacher (shadow sovereign; meet the king of curses) by Overly_Verbose

    This work is mainly inspired by SIkuna's guide to not fucking up perfectly good children by Overly_Verbose. There are probably going to be some similar plot points, but I'm going to try to put my own spin. There will be NO ROMANCE here, only found family and friendship.

(See the end of the work for other works inspired by this one.)
Chapter 1
Chapter Text

He was dead, and then he wasn’t.

It was as if he had been submerged in the deepest depths of darkness, and then someone suddenly pulled him into a blindingly bright stage. He wanted to go back to that peaceful slumber, but something was crushing his chest with a massive palm.

Get off!

He automatically pushed away the hand holding him with all his might. Huh? It was easier than he thought. It was like pushing away air, but he could still feel the muscle and skin of the other being. With his eyes still closed, he lightly landed on the floor with ease.

There was a groan in front of him. A monster. It was releasing a disgusting stench from its mouth. How annoying.

A deeply ingrained instinct pushed him to raise his hand and erase whatever wretch dared to bear its fangs against him. With a gruesome splash and cut, the monster’s life was quickly cut short.

He slowly opened his eyes and found himself standing on a school rooftop.

Wait, how did I get here? He couldn’t clearly remember where he was before, but it surely wasn’t in this strange place. He looked down and saw himself wearing a bright yellow hoodie. However, what drew his attention was the dark tattoos on his skin. They looked awfully familiar. He gazed at them for a while before he finally remembered where he had seen such unique markings. He raised his hand toward his face and lightly touched one of his four eyes.

Ah, this can’t be real, he thought with mounting dread.

Someone was making a sound behind him. It was a light wheeze mixed with a stuttered, fearful gasp. He turned around and saw a familiar-looking teen with spiky black hair. Shit. I know that face.

The teen and he watched each other in silence. He wasn’t sure what kind of face he was making. He couldn’t even be bothered to think much. After all, how could one even understand how such a ridiculous thing had occurred to them? He wanted to run for the hills but couldn’t move a muscle.

Did I just wake up as goddamned Sukuna?!

Megumi did not dare to move. How could he when he was facing the incarnation of death? The worst possible situation had occurred. The infamous King of Curses had reincarnated. God dammit, Itadori. It would've been better if the two of us died instead!

Surprisingly, Sukuna did nothing after utterly destroying the enemy attacking him. Megumi had thought Ryoumen Sukuna would scream for the blood of innocents immediately after his revival. Yet, Sukuna was strangely calm as he took in his situation.

Blood-red eyes gazed at him with unknown intention. Was Sukuna pondering the best way to kill Megumi? If so, he hoped Sukuna would decide quickly. He felt as if he was about to pass out soon. The sheer malice and cursed energy from Sukuna were choking him. No wonder he was called the King of Curses. Only something so powerful and horrible could stand on top of all those monsters.

Sadly, nobody cared to listen to Megumi's wishes. Who had? Not his annoying teacher, not the helpful but frustrating Itadori, and certainly not the King of Curses. Sukuna merely kept looking at him as if he were the weird one in this situation.

Suddenly, Sukuna's right hand moved and grasped his own throat. A familiar voice came out, "Hey, what are you doing with my body?"

'Itadori?!' Megumi thought. He had expected the poor boy to disappear after the King of Curses was reincarnated. Yet, it seemed he somehow managed to exist within the same body as Sukuna. 'What the hell is going on?'

Sukuna's eyes widened for a second before they curved in mirth. Then, with the same mouth, another voice came out, "Oh, you're still here? How surprising." Sukuna's voice was deep and powerful. It sent shivers down Megumi's spine. Although Sukuna was not hostile, that voice still contained an ever-present feeling of danger and terror.

"I mean, it's my body," Itadori said.

"Well, that is true. So what are you going to do?" Sukuna asked.

Was he taunting Itadori? After all, it was no longer Itadori's body. The King of Curses had reincarnated after so many years, and there was no way he would let himself be suppressed. Maybe… maybe this was Megumi's chance. Maybe he could use this time to take down Sukuna while he was distracted. Megumi forced his shaky hands to move.

"Just give it back!" Itadori said.

Sukuna only chuckled. "Take it then."

Slowly, the blood-red eyes changed back to gold, and the dark markings on the skin disappeared. The hand holding the throat relaxed and fell down. Itadori came back and shook his head like a dog.

"Huh, that was easier than I thought," Itadori muttered to himself.

Finally, without the pressure from Sukuna's cursed energy, Megumi could move his stiff muscles. He summoned his power, and shadows began to ripple around him. "Itadori Yuuji! Under Jujutsu regulations, I'll exorcise you as a curse!"

Itadori quickly raised his hands to show that he was harmless. "It's fine! That guy isn't in control anymore. More importantly, we should go to the hospital to take care of our wounds."

Itadori's concern seemed genuine, but Megumi couldn't be sure. Although all signs pointed to Sukuna no longer controlling the body, the way the curse gave up control was too suspicious. What if he was merely pretending? Megumi couldn't know for sure. Although his logic pushed him to follow the regulations, his heart couldn't let him kill someone he saw as a fellow human. Not only that, that person was Itadori. He was stupid, but he was stupidly kind. If Itadori hadn't been trying to save Megumi, they wouldn't have been in this situation. In the end, all of this happened because of Megumi's incompetence. If he were stronger, Itadori wouldn't have thought of eating Sukuna's Finger.

Dammit, what should I do?

Megumi's dilemma was quickly interrupted when a familiar, annoying voice appeared beside him.

"Yo! What's the situation?" Gojo asked with his usual bright tone. Megumi turned toward his teacher in surprise.

"Gojo-sensei! What are you doing here?"

Although Satoru said he wasn't planning on coming, he was actually going to do so the moment he heard Sukuna's Finger was missing from its proper place. Those darned things always caused trouble, and he could only imagine what kind of nonsense Megumi could get dragged into. It seemed his decision was correct, considering his student's horrible appearance. Not many people could come out of a fight with curses without injuries (they weren't Satoru, after all), but today, Megumi looked much more rattled than usual.

Satoru tried to lighten the mood by teasing the boy a bit. It worked like a charm, and the familiar cranky face returned. Now that he was sure nothing was terribly off, Satoru asked the important question, "So, did you find it?"

Megumi didn't answer, and his face only became pinched. There seemed to be a juicy story here.

"Uh, sorry," another young teen said sheepishly, raising his right hand. "I ate it."

Satoru could only stare. His smile froze on his face. Did he ask the wrong thing? No, he was sure that he was asking about the special-grade cursed object and not a delicious mochi. Was there really somebody who could look at those crusty fingers and see a delicious meal? What's wrong with today's youth? Was he really that old? Was this a new trend? Watch me eat this disgusting finger and subscribe!

After a few seconds, Satoru could only ask, "For real?"

"For real," the two teens echoed, but Megumi sounded much more distressed.

Satoru approached the boy and examined him closely using his Six Eyes. The boy gracefully let Satoru stand awfully close to him as the man tried to figure out the mess before him. Wow, Satoru had seen a lot of awful auras, but nothing could compare to the sheer power and malice radiating from the King of Curses. Although it was quite small since the boy had only eaten one finger, it had already shown how terrifying Sukuna could be.

What was more interesting was how it calmly warped around the boy's energy. Although it was powerful, it felt strangely calm and peaceful. Well, as peaceful as a horrifying energy covered in bloodshed and death could be.

"How does your body feel?" Satoru asked.

"It feels fine," the boy readily answered.

"Can you switch to Sukuna?"

"Sukuna?" The teen tilted his head in confusion. Wow, he looked quite cute. Megumi was also cute, but the boy was too cranky for someone so young. If someone didn't know any better, they would've thought the dark-haired teen to be an old man in his eighties. Unlike his ward, the boy before Satoru held a bright energy, similar to a golden retriever.

Satoru said, "The cursed object you ate. Y'know, the crusty old finger you chow down on like it's a delectable sweet."

"It didn't taste sweet. It was horrible, like an old soap!" the boy replied.

Only soap? Satoru had thought it would taste more horrible, considering how disgusting those fingers looked. He joked, "C'mon, don't be so harsh. I doubt Sukuna appreciates your comment about his finger." Could Sukuna listen and see everything the boy witnessed? Based on his examination, the answer should be yes.

"That guy? He hasn't said anything except some hums. He seemed quite interested when you showed up, though."

"Is that so?" Satoru smirked. Well, he was the strongest, after all. Perhaps the King of Curses could feel that he wasn't someone to be taken lightly. "So, can you let Sukuna out for a bit?"

"I guess so…" The boy looked contemplative as if he were listening to something. Was he talking to Sukuna, perhaps? After several seconds, the boy sheepishly said, "He said he didn't want to be bothered by you."

"Eh? Why is the King of Curses afraid of little old me?" Satoru taunted. Well, that wouldn't do. He needed to test whether or not the boy could control the curse. It was also surprising that Sukuna didn't immediately jump on the offer. According to the records, the curse loved carnage and battles. "Doesn't he want to stretch his limbs after being dead for so long? C'mon, I won't bite."

The teen didn't answer for a while, clearly communicating with Sukuna. "He said that he's not interested, but since you won't stop, he'll humor you."

Curious. Sukuna seemed much more evasive than his legends suggested. Well, now, this finally tickled Satoru's curiosity. He really needed to meet with the dreaded King of Curses. "Aw, don't worry. I won't take more than one minute. After that, you can take back control, okay?"

The teen nodded, and Satoru quickly threw his precious omiyage to Megumi. He explained to his student about the amazing Kikufuku Mochi while he waited for the curse to manifest. It didn't take long at all. Soon, the teen's face was covered with dark tattoos, and an oppressive and dark aura emerged. Four red eyes slipped open and gazed impassively at Satoru.

It was like looking into the abyss. Satoru had always been the one to look and examine the world with his Six Eyes. Yet, in front of this being, it was his turn to be examined under a microscope. Sukuna didn't say anything, and yet those eyes spoke as if he knew Satoru inside and out. Somehow, Sukuna knew about his past, his dream, his future, and even death.

It was horrifying.

It was exhilarating.

Without noticing, Satoru had already used his power to throw a chunk of the rooftop at the curse. He couldn't stand those eyes drilling into his soul. Sukuna didn't dodge and only raised his hand lazily. The boulder broke into small rubble with invisible slashes.

"How rude," Sukuna said. Megumi tensed beside Satoru, clearly expecting retaliation. Yet, the curse didn't return Satoru's attack and continued to stand there, looking bored.

Satoru felt a bit insulted. Was he really that uninteresting? He pushed down his annoyance and smirked. "My bad, I thought you wanted a fight, oh King of Curses."

Sukuna scoffed. "Don't presume my intentions, sorcerer. I have no desire to fight someone like you in my current state."

"Are you afraid?" Satoru taunted. He wanted to break that calm facade, yet Sukuna merely continued to stare at him. Satoru knew he was good-looking, but could Sukuna stop staring at him with those eyes? It was getting on his nerves.

Sukuna replied, placing his hands inside his pockets. Satoru really wanted to punch Sukuna. He usually looked down on others, but here's the first person who looked down on Satoru. Keeping your hands ready was important for many cursed techniques, but this curse dared stuff them inside his pockets as if he deemed Satoru not a threat.

Sukuna smirked. "No, but I know better than challenging the Six Eyes and Limitless wielder."

Satoru froze for a millisecond but quickly hid his surprise. Did Sukuna guess who he was with only one attack? The Gojo clan was one of the strongest clans in the modern Jujutsu world, but he wasn't sure whether they were as well-known during the Heian era. Had one of his clan members fought against the King of Curses? He couldn't be sure. Yet, the fact that Sukuna could easily figure out his identity was disconcerting.

"Wow! I've heard you're very smart in a fight, but I didn't know you were a fellow genius," Satoru said with forced levity. "Are you sure you don't want to test your strength against me? Man, I'm really disappointed. Should I tell everyone that the King of Curses is a coward?"

Sukuna merely snorted, unbothered by Satoru's mockery. "Cease this needless prattling. I know you merely wish to know whether the brat can control me."

Ah, Satoru was sure Sukuna didn't have a cursed technique related to mind reading. Or was he really so easy to read? Either way, he really needed to keep his guard up.

Sukuna continued, ignoring Satoru's inner turmoil, "Worry not. The brat is one of a kind. I doubt anybody could suppress me like he did. A very rare person with a special constitution, or perhaps…"

'Perhaps?' Satoru narrowed his eyes.

Sukuna smirked but did not continue. Instead, he closed his eyes. One minute had passed. The markings on his body disappeared, and with them, so did the oppressive aura.

"Ah, is everyone alright?" the boy with golden eyes asked.

"What a surprise! You really can control him!" Satoru replied with his usual happy tone, yet he did not feel at ease in the slightest. What exactly did Sukuna imply? Something was brewing, and Satoru didn't know what. He was supposed to be the strongest, the Honored One, and here he was, being played around like a fool. He frowned behind his blindfold. He would definitely dig out the truth no matter what.

Omake:
Sukuna inner monologue
Sukuna: Shit! How could I isekaid into Sukuna?! I could be anyone! Why him?!
Sukuna: Wow, is that Megumi? He looks great. I thought anime characters would look weird in person. Yeesh, he's bleeding a lot. He needs to get patched up soon.
Sukuna: Yuuji! Where are you, Yuuji? Oh, there you are!
Sukuna: *Let Yuuji take back control* Okay, time out. I need to gather my shit first.
Sukuna: Is that Gojo Satoru?! The Gojo Satoru?! Wow, wow, wow, I don't have a phone right now. I can't take a picture. Man, I can't see his eyes like this, too bad.
Sukuna: Shit, fuck, I don't wanna fight Gojo. Can't I just not?
Sukuna: God Damnit, now I have one minute. Good job me.
Sukuna: Uh, random bullshit go.
Sukuna: Man, Gojo's voice is really nice. Actually, Sukuna's voice isn't bad either.
Sukuna: *Returns to the inner domain* That wasn't bad at all. I even hinted about Kenjaku's plot! Maybe I can change the future! ( ˶ˆᗜˆ˵ )

Megumi: I’m gonna die. ( ꩜ ᯅ ꩜;)⁭ ⁭
Yuuji: I have a demon inside my head, but he's weirdly nice. ('･ω･`)?
Satoru: Something is going on, and I don't like it. ಠ_ಠ

 
Chapter 2
Notes:

    I admit the encounter with the cursed spirit is quite similar to Overly_Verbose's fic, but what can I say? It's a great scene, and I've to add it.

Chapter Text

"Don't trust Sukuna, Yuuji," Gojo said, lacking his usual levity. "No matter how kind or amicable he is. Sukuna is a curse. Remember that."

Yuuji had expected that being a vessel for the King of Curses would be much more unpleasant. He had assumed the curse would constantly spout mockery and taunts at him, but Sukuna proved him wrong by remaining mostly silent. So far, Yuuji could only sense flickers of emotion as he went about his day. For a being born from negative energy, Sukuna gave off only curiosity and amusement.

Unfortunately, Yuuji didn’t have much time to dwell on that. He had to take care of his grandfather’s funeral and visit his seniors at the hospital. His life had completely changed. Curses, sorcerers, and a new world had appeared in front of him, pulling him right into the middle of it. He didn’t want to think about the execution that loomed over him. He already knew what had to be done. He had no intention of regretting the way he lived. He had told Principal Yaga that much.

Yet, as Yuuji faced the horrifying curse before him, dread took hold. It hurt. It hurt. His left hand was gone, and the fingers of his remaining hand had been cut off. He didn’t want to die, but he couldn’t let Kugisaki and Fushiguro die either. So he was trapped in this nightmare.

I can’t go down. Not yet.

Yuuji dodged another attack from the newly born cursed spirit. Its ever-present grin seemed to mock his desperate struggle. He gritted his teeth. He didn’t want to die. Not like this. Not while being torn apart by a monster that took joy in his suffering.

He had been too naive.

And yet.

And yet.

Yuuji had never truly understood the word give up. He forced every ounce of rage, fear, and regret into his fist.

Bam.

The curse caught his punch with ease.

“Dammit!” Yuuji shouted.

He was still too weak. Just then, the howling of Fushiguro’s shikigami echoed through the area. It was the signal.

“Sukuna!” Yuuji yelled. “It’s your turn now!”

“Now, now, when did I say I’d help you?” Sukuna’s mouth suddenly appeared on Yuuji’s cheek.

“You—” Yuuji’s protest was cut short when the cursed spirit flung him across the space. He managed to land upright and kept his eyes on the enemy. “Do you want to die with me here?!”

“Come now, brat, that’s no way to speak to your supposed savior.” Sukuna’s single red eye curved upward in a mocking grin. “Didn’t I tell you I don’t care about losing this much power?”

The first bite of despair sank into Yuuji’s heart. Was this how it ended? He couldn’t accept that. He had promised Gojo and Fushiguro that they would take Sukuna down together. His grandfather had asked him to help people. But now he would die, not long after entering the world of Jujutsu. It was unfair. Completely unfair.

“No need for the pity party just yet, brat,” Sukuna said, cutting into Yuuji’s spiraling thoughts. “I never said I wouldn’t help. Let’s talk for a bit first.”

“Talk? I don’t have time to talk! Don’t you see that—” Yuuji’s eyes snapped toward the cursed spirit. It hadn’t moved in a while. That ever-present grin had disappeared. It stood frozen in place, like someone had nailed it to the ground.

“Relax. That pathetic excuse for a special grade won’t interrupt us,” Sukuna explained, grinning. “I’ve made sure it won’t move unless you attack or try to run.”

“What did you do?” Yuuji asked, letting out a short breath. He wasn’t relaxed, not really, but the fact that the spirit wouldn’t immediately lunge at him gave him a small sliver of hope.

“Just showed it who it’s really dealing with,” Sukuna said.

Megumi stopped in his tracks as a wave of malice exploded from the detention center. Ijichi, who was carrying Kugisaki, halted beside him. They had been heading for the car when the horrible aura erupted behind them.

“Is that?” Kugisaki asked. She looked ready to pass out from her wounds, yet still turned her head toward the building.

“Sukuna,” Megumi whispered. This was the second time he had felt that aura, and he couldn’t imagine ever getting used to it. The cursed energy felt like an oppressive wall closing in from all sides. He knew they were relatively safe now, but every instinct screamed at him not to turn his back to the source.

He forced himself to look at Ijichi and Kugisaki. “You two need to go. Now.”

“Ha?! What about you, idiot?!” Kugisaki snapped. “You’re seriously planning to stay here?”

“Someone has to keep an eye on things,” Megumi replied.

“You’ll die!” Kugisaki shouted. She looked like she wanted to punch him, but her injuries kept her rooted in place.

“We can’t risk Sukuna going wild. I have to stay in case something happens.” Megumi swallowed hard. He didn’t want to think about what would happen if Itadori lost control. Gojo had said he could suppress Sukuna, but what Megumi had seen earlier left him uncertain. Sukuna didn’t seem angry about being sealed. It was as if he had been waiting. Planning. Itadori was just a teenager, trapped between higher-ups that wanted him dead and a monster inside his body.

“As if you could handle that freak on your own!” Kugisaki snapped. She pushed Ijichi aside, who quickly let go. She wobbled but managed to stand straight through sheer force of will. “You know what? If you’re staying, then I’m staying too.”

“What?” Megumi frowned. “You’re injured. You need a hospital. Ijichi can call for help as soon as you get out of the barrier.”

“Any help he gets will come after you’re already a stain on the ground!” Kugisaki shouted. Ijichi took a step back, clearly not wanting to get caught in the middle. He gave Megumi a desperate look, silently begging him to intervene.

Megumi felt a headache beginning to form. “Just follow the plan, Kugisaki. There’s nothing else we can do.”

“Screw the plan! I’m staying!” she said, already moving toward a tree. She leaned on it heavily before sliding down to the ground. “Besides, I want to see what the King of Curses looks like. So it’s a win-win.”

Megumi’s eye twitched. There was nothing win-win about this. It was bad or worse, and they had gone straight for worse.

“Damn it, Kugisaki. This isn’t the time to act selfish,” Megumi said, stepping toward her. He glared, but she met his gaze without flinching.

“You’re one to talk. Stop acting like you’re the only sorcerer here. We’re in this together, and we’ll get out of it together. That potato head better show up soon, or I swear I’ll break his skull.”

Megumi sighed and dragged a palm down his face. He couldn’t understand what his classmates were thinking. First Itadori, now Kugisaki. He turned to Ijichi, who was still frozen.

“Ijichi-san. Please go contact Gojo-sensei. I’ll stay with Kugisaki while we wait for Itadori.”

If he actually returned. If Sukuna hadn’t taken full control.

Ijichi opened and closed his mouth a few times before he managed a shaky breath. Then he forced a smile. “T-then I’ll leave the barrier to contact Gojo-san. But please don’t go anywhere. I’ll be back as soon as I can.”

“Ijichi-san—” Megumi started.

Ijichi raised a hand. “Please don’t ask me to abandon students, Fushiguro-kun. I may not be good in combat, but I’m still your senior. And I can’t in good conscience leave minors behind to face the King of Curses alone.”

Megumi clenched his jaw and looked away.

Great. It really felt like all of them were going to die today.

“Let’s make a Binding Vow,” Sukuna said.

“A what?” Yuuji asked, still keeping his eyes on the cursed spirit. Although Sukuna said that it wouldn’t interrupt them, Yuuji didn’t dare turn his back on it. It had taken off his hand and fingers, after all.

“Think of it as a contract between sorcerers that is tied to our souls,” Sukuna explained. “Unlike empty promises, it is not something that you can break without receiving heavy penalties. If you agree to my demands, then I’ll help you.”

“I’m not letting you take over my body!” Yuuji exclaimed. He still remembered Gojo’s words. Although Sukuna had been very cooperative so far, he wasn’t stupid enough to believe that the curse wouldn’t suddenly change its attitude once it was free.

“Of course not. I’m not foolish enough to believe you’re going to agree to that,” Sukuna’s eye curved into a frown. “I shall merely ask you to let me take over your body for ten minutes if you are ever in a dire situation. I doubt that future enemies you may encounter will be as weak as this pathetic creature. In that situation, we won’t be able to establish another vow like this one. If I deem that you’re in sufficient danger, I’ll use the word ‘enchain’ to take control of your body even without your agreement.”

That sounded reasonable and… weirdly helpful. Yuuji thought Sukuna would ask for something more selfish, but he supposed that the curse didn’t want to die so soon despite his previous words. Yuuji wanted to agree, but he couldn’t help but hesitate. He knew he wasn’t that smart. He wouldn’t know if there was some loophole that Sukuna could exploit. What if he used that chance to hurt innocent people? If only his sensei were here, then he would be able to ask for his opinion.

“I see that you’re still doubtful,” Sukuna said. “Hmm, then I’ll add that I shall not injure any humans who have not attacked me in that situation. Of course, cursed spirits will not receive the same mercy.”

That sounded much better. Yuuji tilted his head. He still felt unsure about making a deal with the devil, but he didn’t have much choice at the moment. “Then, if I agree, you will take care of this curse? Wait, you also need to promise not to kill Fushiguro or Kugisaki when I let you out this time! Actually, don’t you dare kill any innocent humans!”

“I promise that I won’t hunt down those brats or any weakling humans.” Sukuna rolled his eyes. “It’s not as if they will provide much entertainment to me.”

Yuuji wanted to argue against that statement, but it seemed the curse had started to realize that Sukuna couldn’t do much inside Yuuji’s head. It hadn’t attacked him yet, but it had started to move more than before. “Fine, I agree!”

“Good decision.”

Yuuji heard the sounds of chains inside his mind. Or was it his soul? Strange. He felt that he should be more unnerved. Slowly, his consciousness started to fade as he released his control to Sukuna.

As he slowly descended into slumber, he could feel a fiery presence coming from behind him. It was burning hot like hellfire, and yet he didn’t feel pain as it got near. A pair of arms wrapped around him.

“Sleep now. Leave the rest to me.”

Yuuji found himself burrowing deeper into that embrace.

“Now, what should I do with you?” Sukuna said as he took control of Yuuji’s body.

The curse, which had grown too daring, went as stiff as a board when red eyes landed on it. The cursed spirit, born as an apex predator, suddenly found itself in front of a being much more powerful than it. Although it had never encountered this monster before, it knew deep in its soul that Sukuna was not someone it could defeat.

Sukuna shifted his eyes to look at Yuuji’s wounded hands. Although he could no longer feel much pain as a curse, he could still remember how the kid cried as he endured the curse’s attacks. It didn’t take long for him to find the information on how to activate his regeneration ability. In a second, all the wounds on Yuuji’s body were gone, as if he hadn’t been hurt in the first place.

Sukuna flicked his eyes back to the creature before him, anger brimming in his fiery red eyes. “You really took pleasure in torturing the kid. So drunk with stolen power that was never meant to be yours. It’s truly pathetic.”

“Die.” He raised two of his fingers in a swift motion. Dismantle came to him as easily as breathing. Purple blood sprayed into the air as the curse instantly lost all four of its limbs.

It shrieked as it fell to the ground. It had never felt such pain before. Sukuna crouched, lazily watching as the cursed spirit tried its best to heal itself. “You’re awfully slow. Shouldn’t these things come easily to curses? I suppose you’re still a newborn.”

Although it feared for its life, its desire to survive forced it to move despite facing a calamity. The moment the curse’s legs were regenerated, it tried to run away from its predator.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

Sukuna suddenly appeared in front of the cursed spirit, and with a swing of his hand, he punched the creature through several layers of walls.

Crack! Bam!

The curse choked on its own blood as it found itself embedded in a wall. Not even a second later, Sukuna stood before the creature, still watching it struggle to survive with dispassionate eyes.

“How boring. Can’t you be much more entertaining?” Sukuna asked.

The curse didn’t answer, couldn’t. It could only force its body out of the cracks. It must escape. It must survive. It couldn’t die here.

“Well, if you’re going to keep being like this, then I’ll just have to get my own entertainment.” A terrifying and cruel grin blossomed on Sukuna’s face. He used Dismantle once again and cut off the curse’s limbs into pieces.

The cursed technique also destroyed the wall it was embedded in, causing the creature to fall to the ground for the second time. The curse shrieked. This time, it didn’t even bother to regenerate and attempted to crawl away.

“Hey, hey, didn’t I say that you can’t run?” Sukuna lazily approached the cursed spirit. He placed his foot squarely on the creature’s back and forced it to stay still. The curse coughed up another splash of purple blood. Sukuna continued to dig his foot down as he spoke, “You know, I really want to test my skills, but you’re very weak and terribly inefficient at healing yourself. Then a thought strikes me. Why don’t I just help you with that?”

Then, a surge of power flowed into the cursed spirit. It felt like fire and lava pouring into its veins, burning its body and soul. It couldn’t even try to struggle since Sukuna pinned it to the ground like a butterfly on a display case. Its wounds were gone in a second, but a moment later, Sukuna sent Cleave into its body and cut it into pieces.

And so, the hellish cycle began.

Heal!

The curse couldn’t even scream, and only Sukuna’s deranged laughter accompanied its torture. It kept going and going… Would it get stuck in this hell? … And yet… somehow… the cycle... stopped…

“What a waste of time.” Sukuna clicked his tongue and removed his feet from the curse’s back. It didn’t think. Immediately, it got to its feet and ran. It didn’t dare to look back. This was its only chance to survive.

So close!

It could see!

An exit!

“Domain Expansion: Malevolent Shrine.”

Suddenly, the ground underneath it turned into a pool of blood, and something emerged from behind the curse. Then— it was nothing but pieces of meat and gore on the ground.

Sukuna blankly gazed at the result of his work. The cursed spirit’s remains soon disappeared in a flash of flame, vanishing into nothingness. Only an old, wrinkled finger was left on the ground. The purple blood that covered Yuuji’s uniform also slowly vanished.

Sukuna released his domain and exhaled a deep breath. He looked up at the ceiling of the detention center, which had returned to normal after the curse’s death.

‘Ah… I really fucked up.’

Omake:

Sukuna's inner monologue

Sukuna: Holy shit! Yuuji is hurt! I wanna help, but I can’t because that’ll be too out of character!

Sukuna: Okay, I think I’ve figured something out. It’s time to make a Binding Vow! I’m so smart.

Sukuna: *Glaring at the curse* You piece of shit. You dared to hurt Yuuji. I’ll make you wish you were dead.

Sukuna: *After torturing the cursed spirit* I… What the hell…

 

Megumi: I’m going to die. No, WE are going to die.  \(˚☐˚”)/

Nobara: Megumi isn’t the only one allowed to throw his life away! <( •̀ᴖ•́)>

Chapter Text

Sukuna stood inside the detention center, pondering his recent actions. He had planned to make that curse pay for what it had done to Yuuji, but he certainly didn’t expect the process to be this… gruesome. He had practically tortured the creature while laughing maniacally like a crazy, murderous King of Curses. He searched for the feeling of guilt and unease and found none. It was as if tormenting the curse meant nothing to him. Sure, the cursed spirit had been a monster that hurt Yuuji, but he never imagined himself to be that cruel, even against his enemies.

It was as if…

It was as if the original Sukuna were standing here.

Sukuna covered his mouth and frowned. He tried to remember his past life before he found himself in this new world. Frustratingly, he could find nothing. It was as if his previous identity had disappeared like a puff of smoke. He couldn’t remember his name, his family, his childhood. Did he… did he even exist in the first place?

The only clear thing in his mind was the knowledge of future events in Jujutsu Kaisen that he supposedly read in his past life. Sukuna sighed. He hadn’t imagined experiencing an identity crisis in the middle of an empty detention center.

‘What to do…?’

Sukuna’s goal to change the future and protect Yuuji hadn’t changed at all. Although he tortured that curse, he no longer felt any bloodlust that would lead him to attack Megumi. So, that’s good. In the end, even if his true identity became uncertain, Sukuna still knew what he wanted to achieve. That was enough for him.

Sukuna checked on Yuuji inside him, but the kid was still too deep in his slumber. Was he like this with the original Sukuna? He doubted that Yuuji would wake up any time soon. Stuffing his hands inside his pockets, he began to make his way outside the building. Whatever. He didn’t want to stay here and be reminded of his recent activity.

Sukuna didn’t forget to pick up the fallen finger on the ground. He examined the special-grade cursed item and made a disgusted face. Damn, it looks nasty. How had Yuuji even swallowed this thing with that sharp nail, anyway?

Megumi and Kugisaki watched the detention center with perturbation. The first explosion of dark cursed energy had subsided, and only uneasy silence remained. Kugisaki had temporarily fixed her hammer by using a belt to connect the two pieces of the handle. Although she remained seated, she already held some nails between her fingers. Megumi’s hands were also ready to make a sign to summon his shikigami.

“That potato head certainly takes his sweet time,” Kugisaki complained. Although she pretended to act casual, Megumi could easily notice the tension in her shoulders. The lack of any outward violence or destruction made the two of them even more apprehensive.

Out of the blue, the expanded parts of the detention center disappeared, leaving the building looking as it used to. The special grade is dead! Megumi thought. But that revelation didn’t make him feel at ease. Instead, he became more wary of the current situation. Who would exit the building? Would it be Itadori or Sukuna?

If it was Sukuna, then…

Megumi gritted his teeth.

“Oh!” Kugisaki tried to stand up. “There you are, potato head!”

A familiar head with pink hair was exiting the building with an easy stride. Megumi’s eyes widened, then narrowed as he attempted to see who was approaching them. Kugisaki didn’t share the same nervousness and was slowly walking past him despite her wounds.

Kugisaki ranted, “We’ve been waiting for you! If you take any longer, you’ll have to pay for my next shopping trip! Can’t you see that I’m wounded and in dire need of medical attention?”

When Megumi saw the markings on Itadori’s skin, he gasped and pulled back his classmate. The other teen winced and glared at him. “What the hell, urchin head?! Did you forget that I’m hurt?”

“K-Kugisaki!” Megumi shot a panicked look at his fellow sorcerer but quickly locked his eyes on the approaching figure again. “That’s not Itadori!”

Kugisaki made a small sound as she finally realized who they were facing. Blood-red eyes stared at them with a slight curve. There was a small smile pasted on his lips. “Hello there!”

“Sukuna!” Megumi gritted out. “What did you do to Itadori?!”

The curse tilted his head. It was a familiar gesture that Itadori loved to make, but Megumi didn’t feel the same fondness when Sukuna did it. “Nothing. The brat is merely sleeping like a babe. What? Did you forget when he begged me to help him?”

“Shut up! Return his body!” Megumi summoned Nue but didn’t give it the order to attack yet. The King of Curses seemed to be in a chatty mood, so it might be possible to distract him and wait until Itadori could resurface.

“How ungrateful.” Sukuna clicked his tongue but didn’t seem threatened by Megumi’s shikigami. “I helped you guys dispose of that pathetic special grade, and this is how—” The curse’s words were interrupted by a nail suddenly flying straight at him.

Bam!

Unfortunately, Sukuna easily evaded the oncoming attack and merely raised an eyebrow.

“Are you deaf, you dumb curse?! Give us the potato head, or I’ll make you regret coming out!”

Megumi could only stare at his classmate with his mouth open. He could see the sweat rolling down Kugisaki’s face and neck, but the teen kept ranting at the King of Curses as if she didn’t care about the monster before them.

“You’ve done your task; now be a good boy and return to your kennel!” Kugisaki threateningly raised her nails and hammer.

Sukuna looked at Kugisaki, dumbfounded. Perhaps this was the first time he had experienced such disrespect, especially from someone as weak as them. Then, unexpectedly, the curse let out a big laugh while covering his face. It wasn’t particularly evil or mad, but it still sent shivers down the sorcerers’ backs.

The laughter continued for several seconds before Sukuna trailed off. His hand slid down his face, revealing his red eyes once more. “Such big words, little sorcerers. Are you sure you can back them up?”

The two teens tensed. Were they truly going to fight Sukuna?

‘Fuck, Kugisaki. I appreciate your guts, but this is not the time to taunt the King of Curses!’ Megumi thought.

“Alright. I’ll humor you guys.” Sukuna smirked and pulled out his right hand, making a ‘come at me’ gesture. “Entertain me.”

The two sorcerers immediately channeled their cursed energies and began attacking. Megumi sent Nue flying and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with Sukuna. The curse easily blocked his attacks with a grin on his face. Kugisaki attempted to throw several nails, but Sukuna dodged them.

Although Gojo had taught Megumi for several years, he still couldn’t keep up with the King of Curses. Sukuna managed to land a hit on him, but he quickly summoned his serpent. It struck the curse from the ground and lifted him into the air. Kugisaki used the opportunity to throw a nail at Sukuna.

Rip!

Before the nail could reach him, Sukuna ripped his shikigami’s jaw open and leaped higher into the air. Megumi dismissed his summon and ordered Nue to strike the curse from behind. The bird managed to hit him, but it wasn’t enough. Sukuna landed heavily on the ground, sending a shockwave that left them unstable.

‘Shit!’ Megumi thought as Sukuna suddenly grabbed him and flung him at his flying shikigami. Nue managed to slow his fall, but the bird was wounded as it cushioned the impact for him. ‘Nue can’t fight anymore! Oh no, Kugisaki!’

The other teen was desperately trying to keep Sukuna away, but it clearly wasn’t working. The curse easily avoided all the nails she sent his way as he lazily walked toward her. Cornered, Kugisaki finally decided to ditch her ranged method and tried to strike Sukuna with her hammer.

The curse caught her hand. “Come on, you can do better than that.” He lifted her up and then sent her flying toward Megumi, who was running to help her. The two fell into a heap of flailing limbs.

“You two are disappointing.” Sukuna sighed.

Megumi and Kugisaki quickly got to their feet and warily watched the King of Curses. It didn’t seem like Sukuna was about to attack them again.

“You, mouthy brat.” Sukuna pointed at Kugisaki. The teen was ticked off at the name but didn’t refute his words. Clearly, the ass-kicking had put some sense into her. “I’ve seen your cursed technique. It’s powerful, but the problem is that you can’t consistently land it on a fast enemy. You’re also physically too weak to keep up. If you can actually find a way to control your Hairpins instead of just shooting them, you might have provided me with some challenge.”

“And you, spiky brat.” Sukuna shifted his pointed finger to Megumi. Megumi’s eye twitched at the title but kept his mouth shut. “You’re still holding back. You prefer running instead of fighting, even against that pathetic special grade. Is it because you don’t care about the brat? Or is it because you don’t care that you’ll die? Or perhaps… is it because you know you’re holding a trump card that will end all your troubles? Either way, that weak mindset of yours will be the cause of your death.”

Megumi flinched. Kugisaki also couldn’t find any words to say. The three of them stared at each other in silence for a while.

“So, is this the maximum effort you’ll give to get the brat back?” Sukuna asked, tilting his head. Then he gave a cruel grin. “Maybe you should’ve let those higher-ups kill him earlier and cut your losses.”

“Shut up!” Megumi said. He raised his fists and made the summoning sign.

He must summon…

“With this treasure…”

Mahoraga…

Megumi’s hands were shaking. Why was he hesitating? There was a dangerous enemy he couldn't defeat before him. He must summon Mahoraga and exorcise it. He would die, but that wouldn’t matter. He was a sorcerer, after all. Their fate was to keep fighting until they faced an enemy they couldn’t beat.

He knew his duty... what he must do... but...

Megumi looked at that familiar face. He didn’t want to kill Itadori. He knew the being in front of him was Sukuna, but he also knew the teen was still inside somewhere. If only he could reach out to his classmate and bring him back. Somehow, his mind repeated their previous argument.

“Why did you save me?!” Itadori asked angrily.

“I-I didn’t save Itadori because it was logical...” The words that Megumi had kept inside his heart finally poured out. He remembered his sister and her words. He knew he had been motivated by selfish emotional reasons when he asked Gojo to save Yuuji. He was okay with that. “...I’m not a hero, I’m a Jujutsu sorcerer. That’s why I never regret saving you… so, come back, Itadori!”

And yet…

Despite Megumi’s heartfelt words, Sukuna continued to stand before them. The curse’s expression was blank. Megumi thought he would mock the teen for his ridiculously naive words, yet the curse remained silent.

A smirk bloomed on Sukuna’s face. “Heh, I see.”

A second later, the King of Curses appeared merely one foot in front of the teens. The two sorcerers could only gasp as Sukuna grasped their shoulders.

“Keep that determination, and you guys might survive the oncoming storm.” With those words, the curse sent a wave of cursed energy into their bodies. It felt as if someone was lighting a fire inside Megumi’s body, but… the teen opened his eyes, which he had subconsciously closed… It didn’t hurt at all. In fact, Megumi suddenly realized that the pain he had been suffering was disappearing.

‘Is this a Reverse Cursed Technique?!’ Megumi glanced at Kugisaki, who was also looking baffled. She was much more wounded than he was, yet she looked much better than before.

“Consider it a payment for entertaining me.” Sukuna released his hold on them and grinned. “Farewell.” Out of the blue, the dark tattoos that marked the King of Curses disappeared from Itadori’s skin. The secondary red eyes closed, and the red color shifted to familiar gold.

“Huh? Where am I?” Itadori blinked and tilted his head like a dog. Then, he finally registered the two people in front of him. Although they weren’t hurt, the two teens’ expressions were still shaken after encountering the King of Curses. “Fushiguro! Kugisaki! Are you guys okay?!”

Yuuji had been sleeping in the comfiest bed he had ever slept in. After all the pain and fear he had experienced, he didn’t want to wake up. Hadn't he worked enough? Hadn't he suffered enough? He just wanted to rest, at least for a while. Yet, a voice was ringing from outside. That voice sounded familiar…

He knew them…

Fushiguro?

“I-I didn’t save Itadori because it was logical.”

Ah…

Yuuji’s consciousness slowly returned as he listened to his friend’s words. Fushiguro had always seemed closed off and distant. He liked to act like those broody anime characters, like Sasuke. But Yuuji knew that the other teen was never as apathetic as he liked to pretend.

Now, as Yuuji heard Fushiguro’s true thoughts about saving him, he couldn’t help but feel touched. Although he tried to act confident, there was always this nagging uncertainty that never left him. He wasn’t a true sorcerer. He was just a stupid kid who ate something he shouldn’t have.

Yuuji knew that keeping him alive was a risk. Although he didn’t want to die, he understood why some people wanted to execute him. He also didn’t want to accidentally cause more pain to others. That was why… he needed to prove himself. To show that he could be useful. That he could help. That there was meaning to his life. And a meaning to his death.

“That’s why I never regret saving you… so, come back, Itadori!”

Come back. Yeah. Yuuji needed to come back. So, he slowly made his way out of the cocoon inside his mind and climbed out.

“Finally done napping, brat?”

Uh, was that… Sukuna?

Sukuna snorted. “Who else?” Two shadowy hands grabbed his. “Come now, I’m tired of interacting with the other brats. It’s time to wake up.” Although Yuuji couldn’t see him, he could feel Sukuna pulling him up and letting him back to the forefront of his mind.

Yuuji blinked a few times as he suddenly found himself completely in control of his body. “Huh? Where am I?” He had been inside the detention center, fighting a curse, and then… he had made a vow(?) with Sukuna. Then…

Yuuji finally noticed his friends standing before him. Despite having their uniforms completely ruined in places, they didn’t look hurt. However, their expressions were the opposite. It was as if they had just barely managed to slip out of death’s grasp.

“Fushiguro! Kugisaki! Are you guys okay?!” he asked as he approached them.

The two teens stared at him for several seconds before Kugisaki suddenly snapped and hit Yuuji’s head. “YOU IDIOT!”

“OW!” Yuuji crouched and covered his head but didn’t try to fight back as Kugisaki rained punches on him. He felt like he somehow deserved it.

“You just have to be dramatic and wake up at that moment, huh?!” Kugisaki ranted. “Did you know that me and Fushiguro were almost dead?! Dead!”

“W-what? Why?!” Yuuji asked, still not fighting back.

“What else?!” Kugisaki looked as if she was almost frothing at the mouth. “It’s the murderous King of Curses who you let out to deal with the special-grade dumbass!”

“Wait, wait!” Yuuji raised his hands to ask for mercy. “I-I think he shouldn’t be able to hurt you guys! Right! I made a vow? Yeah, a Binding Vow with him!”

“YOU WHAT?!” Fushiguro shouted. He had been silent while Kugisaki was punishing Yuuji, but now it was his turn to be indignant. He stomped toward Yuuji and pulled him up by his collar. “What did you say?!”

“I-I made a Binding Vow?” Yuuji offered a weak smile. “...with Sukuna?”

His friends looked like they were about to have a heart attack. Kugisaki was even clutching her chest and struggling to breathe, while Fushiguro’s eyes couldn't stop twitching as he stared at Yuuji.

“YOU DUMBASS!”

Omake:

Sukuna: *Having an identity crisis after torturing a curse like OGkuna* It’s fine! Everything is fine! I’m still me! I think…

Sukuna: *Meets the gang outside* Oh, Megumi! Wait, is that Nobara?! Why is she still here?

Sukuna: *After saying hello there* Did I accidentally channel Obi-Wan?

Sukuna: Oh shit, isn’t he supposed to have a character arc moment at this point? Should I still fight him so he can still get his revelation?

Sukuna: Sorry, Megumi, Nobara! I’ll be a bit rough, but I’ll make sure not to hurt you guys! Much!

Sukuna: *Fighting the two teens* Damn, Yuuji will definitely get mad at me even though I’m mostly on the defensive here. Sorry, kid, this is for the sake of character growth!

Sukuna: Oh wow, that was fun. *Notices the kids’ states* Yikes. You guys look too hurt for my taste.

Sukuna: *Suddenly hears Megumi’s confession* Such words! I’m moved! *Internally wiping his tears*

Sukuna: *Feels Yuuji waking up* Good job, Megumi! You actually wake up the kid!

Sukuna: *Watches Yuuji being pummeled by his friends* Lol.

 

Megumi: Out of the frying pan into the fire. (-_-|||) 

Nobara: I’m gonna kill this dumb country hick. ⁽⁽(੭ꐦ •̀Д•́ )੭*⁾⁾

Yuuji: What did I do wrong? (｡·  v  ·｡) ?
Notes:

    Yeah, so I want SIkuna to be completely unknown. His previous life won't matter at all cuz, frankly, it doesn't. He just cares about the JJK characters and want to change the future.

Chapter 4
Notes:

    It's always fun to write in Gojo's PoV. He's always so arrogant but also kind, lol.

Chapter Text

Despite the popular opinion that Satoru had a lousy personality, he believed he was quite reasonable. Really. He was the strongest Jujutsu sorcerer, and he could do anything he wanted. Hell, he could become the modern version of Sukuna, and nobody could stop him. Yet, he still let himself be bound by ridiculous rules and etiquette. He took care of powerful curses and curse users. His mere existence was the source of stability many Jujutsu sorcerers had enjoyed for years. He did not doubt that many people could sleep easily at night, knowing that all the most dangerous monsters would be taken care of by the “Strongest.”

Satoru was a good person.

All he asked was to be left alone so he could teach his students and help them grow into strong pillars of the future Jujutsu society. In the meantime, those pesky elders could comfortably sit on their stupid thrones. Satoru even let them order him around like a common mutt, even though he could erase their meaningless existences with the flick of his fingers.

Did you see how nice Satoru had been?

But come on. He had told them about his plan regarding Yuuji, and he even let those higher-ups play their boring power games. He even “agreed” to become Yuuji’s executioner once the kid finished swallowing all of Sukuna’s fingers. All he asked for in return was that Yuuji study under him and become a strong sorcerer.

Satoru was a patient person.

Really…

But those elders couldn’t seem to stop pushing his buttons.

Satoru had been sent on another “business trip” by those stupid higher-ups. And while he wasted his time on boring missions, his students were being thrown into a special-grade nest. To make matters worse, Yuuji even had to beg Sukuna and make a Binding Vow to survive. Seriously? After Satoru had readily agreed to the elders’ demands? This was how they repaid him? By stabbing him in the back and attempting to murder his students?

The higher-ups needed to be reminded of their position.

“Gojo Satoru,” an elder said behind those annoying screens. Did they think that flimsy barrier could hide them from Satoru’s eyes? “We believe we’ve made it clear that you should ensure the completion of your mission. Why have you returned already?”

“Ah, well, you see. I would’ve liked to take my time and eat some regional sweets.” Satoru’s words ticked off another higher-up. Despite years of partnership, the stuck-up elders still had a hard time swallowing Satoru’s antics. They always loved seeing others cower and prostrate themselves before them.

Satoru shrugged. “But you know, I suddenly got dozens of messages from my kouhai. He seemed on the verge of panicking. ‘Gojo-san, please come back,’ ‘Gojo-san, the curse turns out to be a special grade,’ ‘Gojo-san, only Megumi and Kugisaki have returned, and Yuuji has been left to deal with the creature.’”

Satoru could see the tension in the elders’ figures. Ha. Caught red-handed.

“Gojo Satoru! What are you implying?!” another no-good elder demanded.

Satoru ignored them and continued talking. “Luckily, my beloved students managed to get out of trouble because they’re smart. It's not surprising; I’m their teacher, after all. Still, how lucky...” Satoru straightened from his slouched posture and narrowed his eyes. “How very lucky for you guys that all of my students are safe.”

The temperature in the chamber dropped several degrees.

“The disrespect!” a higher-up shouted.

Satoru raised his index finger to his lips while pulling off his blindfold. The blue in his Six Eyes swirled like an icy storm. “Shhh… I’m talking.”

The elder stopped, gulping.

“You guys have gotten too cozy sitting on those seats. Although I prefer to play nice, old people like you can’t seem to understand your situation. I mean, you’re old as shit, so maybe your memories are already failing, huh?” Satoru laughed. Nobody joined in. How rude.

“So, let me remind you of something important~” Satoru intertwined his fingers to make a familiar hand sign.

“Cursed Technique Amplification: Blue.”

“GOJO SATORU!” an elder exclaimed, standing up from his seat.

“Cursed Technique Reversal: Red.”

“ARE YOU PLANNING TO REBEL?!” another higher-up shouted in panic.

“Hollow Purple.”

All the elders were now shouting and no longer sitting in their seats. Although they were afraid, they didn’t run away because they knew it was useless. Once Satoru set his sights on something, nothing could escape. Luckily for them, he let the orb filled with cursed energy remain in his palm.

“Do you see?~” Satoru said lightly, waving his hand, which was still holding Hollow Purple. The higher-ups flinched as they kept their eyes on the cursed technique. They were breathing heavily, but none dared to utter a word. “If your senile minds haven’t forgotten, I’m the strongest Jujutsu sorcerer in the world. I can kill all of you right now, and nobody can stop me. So, I really can’t grasp why you keep being such idiots. Did you forget to take your medications? Hmm?”

Satoru raised his index finger high in the air; Hollow Purple sat firmly on top of the digit. “Let’s make it clear again, shall we?”

Several of the elders gulped.

“I’ll let you warm those seats while I teach my students. Once they become strong and powerful, you senile old men need to get off and enter your retirement gracefully. In the meantime, don’t do anything stupid and test my limits.” Satoru grinned widely. It was half-mad and stained with bloodthirsty urges. “If I get a whiff of you trying to kill Yuuji or hurt any of my students again, I won’t hesitate to hunt you down. At that point, no amount of status, money, or meager power you can gather will be able to stop me from erasing you from existence.”

No one replied. Satoru thought half of the higher-ups were on the verge of passing out. Served them right.

“Alright then. I'm glad we could have an understanding!~” Satoru dismissed Hollow Purple and pulled up his blindfold again. He made his way out of the chamber while waving his hand. “Goodbye. I hope I won’t have to see your wrinkled faces any time soon.”

The door closed with a loud bam.

Satoru used his teleportation and quickly created some distance between himself and those geezers. Threatening them didn’t make him feel better. In fact, he was angrier than before. A part of his mind still couldn’t let go of the thought of killing them and being done with it. It would create some trouble for sure. The stability of the Jujutsu world would be screwed for a while, but it was nothing he couldn’t handle.

However, Satoru pushed down those murderous impulses and went to the Jujutsu High dormitory. He found himself standing before Yuuji’s room. The door was closed, but he easily bypassed it with teleportation. He stood over the kid, who was in a deep sleep. There was drool coming out of the corner of his mouth. The teen looked very tired but content as he rested. That’s good. Satoru felt some of his anger calm down a bit.

When he had received Ijichi’s messages, he had felt a sharp pain in his heart, as if someone had stabbed him again using the Inverted Spear of Heaven. He had been on the other side of the country while a special grade was hunting down his students. Satoru knew they were smart kids with a lot of potential, but they were nowhere near ready to face off against an enemy of that level. Yuuji was the worst of the three since he had only joined the Jujutsu world barely a week ago.

‘There was no way all of them could survive,’ Satoru had thought.

And yet, somehow, someway, when he finally reached the detention center, half-panting from using his teleportation skill, he found the kids and Ijichi safe and sound. Oh, they looked quite haggard and dazed, but all of them still had their limbs. Satoru stared at them for several seconds, trying to process the miracle that greeted him.

They happily welcomed him with clear relief, though Megumi pretended to act aloof as usual. The kids quickly informed him about their mission. A curse womb had somehow obtained another of Sukuna’s fingers, and it had become a special grade. Yuuji decided to release Sukuna, but only after making a Binding Vow with the King of Curses. (Satoru had nearly had a heart attack when he heard this.) Although Sukuna had exorcised the creature, he hadn’t missed the opportunity to mess with Megumi and Nobara. They had even gotten into a one-sided fight against the curse. (Satoru took off his blindfold to ensure that the two kids were actually still alive in front of him.) They told him the curse couldn’t kill them due to the Binding Vow, but Sukuna had even healed all their wounds after the fight. (Really? A curse using a Reverse Cursed Technique on humans?)

Satoru had a lot more questions that needed answers, but he could see how tired the kids were. So, he accompanied them back to the dorm before confronting the higher-ups. It seemed he would need to wait until tomorrow to grill his students for more answers. He could bother Ijichi, but his kouhai looked like he was one step away from passing out. So, Satoru decided not to.

As he was about to exit the room, he noticed a slight shift in the atmosphere. One of the secondary eyes on Yuuji’s face had opened, and a red orb was now gazing at him.

“What do we have here?” Sukuna said, the mouth he had created on Yuuji’s cheek curling into a smirk. “I felt a presence near the brat, but I didn’t expect the strongest sorcerer to visit in the middle of the night.”

“Sukuna~ how nice of you to show up,” Satoru said as he leaned down to examine the curse. It was quite strange to see him manifesting on Yuuji’s body like this.

“Hmph, I doubt that.” Sukuna rolled his eye. “Your dislike towards me is not subtle, sorcerer.”

“Well, what can I say? You’re just a parasite clinging to my beloved student, after all.”

Sukuna looked at him with slight annoyance. Satoru promised himself that one day he would break the ever-calm facade of the King of Curses.

“Did you come here at an unholy hour just to watch the brat sleep like a creep and throw insults at me?”

“Ouch! That hurts.” Satoru clasped a hand to his chest. “Let me tell you, I’m the best teacher that ever graced his presence at Jujutsu High—nay, even the world! I’d never do something as horrible as harassing a minor!”

“Enough.” Sukuna clicked his tongue. “I’ve no desire to trade meaningless words with you, sorcerer. Say your piece or begone.”

Satoru tilted his head and stared at the curse. He raised his hand and took off his blindfold again. It’s not that he needed his Six Eyes when speaking with the curse, but he really couldn’t stand having Sukuna staring at him. Let’s see how he liked being looked at with Satoru’s powerful Six Eyes. Despite their beauty, he knew many people were quite intimidated by them.

“Actually, now that you’re here, I have some questions for you, oh King of Curses.”

Sukuna’s one eye curved in interest. “Oh?”

Satoru sat down on the bed but kept his eyes on the curse. The jostle didn’t wake Yuuji at all. Hmm. He might need to be taught to be more aware of his surroundings, even in sleep. The kid didn’t have Infinity to protect him 24/7, after all.

“That Binding Vow you made with Yuuji,” Satoru said. “You want to use it to stop the execution, right?”

Sukuna didn’t seem upset when his goal was revealed. In fact, he looked downright delighted. “Very discerning of you, sorcerer. Correct, that Binding Vow is merely insurance. Though I doubt I shall need to use it for such an instance.”

“What do you mean?” Satoru blinked. “Are you telling me that you’re fine with being fully exorcised?”

Sukuna replied, “Don’t be daft. I merely know that you won’t let the brat actually get executed.”

Satoru tried not to tense. He kept his eyes locked on Sukuna’s red orb. Once again, he felt the same feeling of being seen. It was as if Sukuna was the god of death, holding Satoru’s soul in his palm and judging all his sins and merits. That red eye was peeling away all his masks and false words to reveal his deepest secrets and wishes.

Satoru really…

Really…

He forced his eyes to stay locked on the curse. “Accusing me of such traitorous actions? Are you sure you’re not projecting yourself?”

“Your distaste for those higher-ups has not gone unnoticed, sorcerer,” Sukuna said. “I also know you’re too soft-hearted to let the kid die just to get rid of me.”

Know.

That word again. What could Sukuna know? This was their second conversation, yet the curse spoke as if he knew Satoru inside and out. Satoru narrowed his eyes. “What? Are you feeling secure in your continued existence, King of Curses? Mark my words, I will erase you from this world without harming Yuuji. He is merely a kid, after all, but a creature like you cannot be left alone.”

Instead of feeling threatened, Sukuna looked even more mirthful. What the hell?

“What? You think I can’t do it?” Satoru demanded. He would prove it to this damned King of Curses, who always seemed to look down on him. Satoru was the Honored One; he always kept his word.

“On the contrary, I know that such a thing is possible.” Sukuna grinned. “Not now, perhaps, but in the future, you may find a way to exorcise an incarnated being without harming the vessel.”

Satoru’s eyes widened in shock. Such confirmation. One would’ve thought that Sukuna would try to hide this information from the world at all costs. Yet here he was, easily proclaiming it to Satoru.

“Heh, until that time arrives, you can consider us allies in keeping the brat alive.” With those words, Sukuna closed his eye and returned to the depths of Yuuji’s mind. Satoru could only stare at Yuuji’s sleeping face in bafflement. He really couldn’t understand the King of Curses.

While Satoru was busy gathering his thoughts, his student suddenly stirred from his sleep. Yuuji blinked several times before fully opening his golden eyes. He and Satoru stared at each other for a few seconds.

“Uh… Sensei? What are you doing here?”

“Yo! Yuuji-kun!” Satoru hid his unease and smiled brightly at his student. “Sorry for barging in at night. I just wanted to check on you, but I ended up having a conversation with Sukuna.”

“Sukuna?” Yuuji quickly sat up in his bed. “Wait! Did he take over my body while I was asleep?”

“Nah, calm down.” Satoru put a firm hand on the kid’s shoulder. “Don’t worry, you’re fully in control. Unless you let Sukuna out, that curse can’t take over your body. He just manifested a mouth on your cheek so we could talk. Which, by the way, was a bit weird.”

“Oh.” Yuuji scratched his cheek and glanced away. “Yeah, he does that sometimes. What did you guys talk about, anyway?”

Seeing no reason to lie to his student, Satoru answered, “It’s about the Binding Vow you made with Sukuna.”

Yuuji’s eyes widened, and then he winced. “I’m really sorry about that, Sensei!” He made a praying gesture with his hands. “I know you said not to let Sukuna out, but I was too weak, and I couldn’t exorcise that curse.”

“Aiya! No need to feel bad, Yuuji-kun~” Satoru placed a palm on his student’s head and rubbed his hair. “You’re just a first-year student and someone who has just entered the Jujutsu world. There’s no way you can handle something at that level. It’s really not your fault.”

“I still can’t help but feel bad,” Yuuji protested but didn’t try to remove Satoru’s hand from his head. Aw. The kid was nicer than Megumi. His ward would’ve tried to bite his hand off if he did this. “If I were stronger, there would be no need to make a Binding Vow with Sukuna. I didn’t even know what it was until he mentioned it to me.”

“Yuuji-kun, if you keep going like this, you’ll make your teacher feel incompetent,” Satoru pouted.

“Ah, why?”

“I should’ve been the one to teach you that, but alas, the pesky higher-ups sent me away and prevented me from doing my duty. It’s okay, though. I’ve made things clear to them. They won’t bother me anymore, and I can use my time teaching my students!” Satoru gave Yuuji a thumbs-up. “In fact, I’ve made some plans about what I need to teach you to make you a great sorcerer!”

“Really?” The kid’s eyes sparkled in wonder and anticipation. “What is it, sensei? Am I going to be able to use Rasengan or something?!”

“Calm down, don’t get too noisy, or Megumi will get angry.” Satoru placed a finger in front of his lips.

Yuuji quickly closed his mouth and nodded. With a much smaller voice, he said, “What training are you going to give me, sensei?”

“That’s a secret~” Satoru grinned when he saw Yuuji pouting. It was always fun to tease the kids. “You’ll find out tomorrow anyway. Be patient~”

Satoru stood up and gave Yuuji another head pat. “Alright, I already bothered you enough tonight. Kids like you need a lot of sleep if you want to grow tall like me.”

“I doubt anyone can be as tall as you, sensei,” Yuuji replied.

“Don’t give up, Yuuji-kun. I believe in you!” Satoru teased.

Before the man could leave, Yuuji suddenly spoke up again. “Um, sensei, I have another question before you go.”

Satoru looked back and tilted his head.

Yuuji didn’t look at him when he said, “About Sukuna… was he really someone that terrible?”

The question hung in the air for a moment. Satoru couldn’t find the words to answer.

“I know that you said he was dangerous and that I shouldn’t trust him, but…” Yuuji continued.

“Yuuji,” Satoru interrupted. He turned to his student again and crouched down to place a hand on his shoulder. He grasped it firmly and forced the kid to look at him. “You’re a good kid with a big heart. But you must understand that some creatures and people won’t hesitate to exploit your kindness. They will smile and act like your friends while holding a knife behind their backs. Sukuna is likely the same. He is the King of Curses. He didn’t claim that title by being a good person.”

The two stared at each other. Yuuji gulped.

“Do you understand?” Satoru asked.

“...Yes, sensei.”

Omake:

Sukuna: *Senses Gojo’s presence* Huh? *Wakes up from sleep* Is that?

Sukuna: *Pops up his eyes and mouth* Yo! Yo! Yo! Hi Gojo! Not that I don’t like to see you, but why are you here at ass o-clock?

Sukuna: It’s the Six Eyes! Six Eyes! They look so pretty, but why is Gojo glaring at me? Have I done something wrong? Please don’t kill me!

Sukuna: Ah, I have a full conversation with Gojo~ One of my life’s dreams has been fulfilled. ⸜(｡˃ ᵕ ˂ )⸝♡

 

Satoru: The hell is wrong with this curse?! (ノ ° 益 °) ノ

Yuuji: If not friend, why friend shaped? ( •̯́ ^ •̯̀)

Chapter Text

As far as training went, watching movies while ensuring the cursed corpse wasn’t decking him was pretty nice. Yuuji was still concerned about whether he was improving, but he trusted Gojo’s words. The man was the strongest sorcerer, after all. Still, although he enjoyed watching films, he couldn’t deny that staring at the TV for hours was getting tiring. At some point, he began to zone out, and his thoughts started to wander. He thought about boring things like what he would have for dinner, but his mind eventually settled on the nagging issue of Sukuna.

Despite hearing Gojo’s warning, Yuuji still couldn’t help but feel curious about the King of Curses. To be fair, he was still angry about the curse attacking his friends, but he couldn’t deny that Sukuna had lent him aid during his most desperate moments. Everyone kept telling him to be wary of the King of Curses, and Sukuna never refuted their claims. Yet, the curse was generally amiable and didn’t bother Yuuji. Dare he say it, even pleasant. The contradiction was messing with Yuuji’s mind. He definitely didn’t plan on letting Sukuna out, but he also didn’t see the point in being needlessly hostile toward the curse.

Yuuji was taking another sip of his soda when Sukuna suddenly spoke, "Speak up, brat."

The sudden voice made Yuuji choke on his drink and cough his lungs out. "Cough! Cough! What the hell, Sukuna?! Why’d you surprise me like that?"

"I should be the one asking you." One of his secondary eyes popped open to glare up at Yuuji. Yuuji could also feel Sukuna’s mouth manifesting on his cheek. "You're the one who can't stop thinking about me. It’s annoying."

"Wait! Hold on! Are you telling me you can read my mind?!" Yuuji asked. He knew he was sharing a body with a curse, but to think that Sukuna could read his thoughts was unsettling.

"In a sense," Sukuna replied. "Though, there’s no need to fret. I can’t hear all of your mindless ramblings. If I could, I would’ve already killed myself."

Yuuji felt slightly insulted at first, but then he realized how horrible it would be to hear another person’s thoughts without a filter. He couldn’t imagine the feeling of having that amount of information pouring into his brain endlessly.

"What do you mean?" Yuuji asked.

"Although our minds are connected, there is still some degree of separation," Sukuna explained. "While I can’t listen to all of your musings, I can hear the thoughts you focus on for too long. I can also feel all the strong emotions you experience, which is why I asked if there was any question you wanted me to answer. I’ve felt you agonizing over me for a while now. It’s distracting."

"I…" Yuuji hesitated. He never imagined Sukuna would confront him about this topic, and Yuuji had assumed he would keep his questions and doubts to himself. Now that he had a chance to confront the curse, he wasn’t sure what he wanted to say.

Sukuna didn’t try to urge him to speak again, but Yuuji could still feel his presence. See, it was always like this. He couldn’t claim that the curse was harmless, but Sukuna was weirdly indulgent and patient with Yuuji. Yuuji knew that he wasn’t the most intelligent guy around, but the curse never took the chance to ridicule him. There were even instances where Sukuna taught him some knowledge about the Jujutsu world.

"I guess… I’m just confused," Yuuji said. "About you. I mean, everyone’s been saying that you're evil, that ‘Yuuji, you should never trust Sukuna,’ and so on…"

"Those are wise words," Sukuna agreed. "When dealing with curses, one should never let their guard down."

"You know it’s weird to hear that from the King of Curses, right?" Yuuji asked, scratching his head.

Nobara couldn’t help but feel annoyed as she dropped her purchases in her dorm room. Although she had been trying to enjoy her shopping time, her mind couldn’t stop returning to that awful fight against the King of Curses. Not only had she gotten her ass kicked by a bunch of curses in the detention center, but she had also been thrown around like a ragdoll by Sukuna. It really…

PISSED HER OFF!

Before entering Jujutsu High, Nobara had already encountered several curses, and she always came out on top. Those experiences had made her confident in her skills, but now she kept getting her ass handed to her like a pathetic damsel in distress. No way! No way! She refused to become a deadweight who needed to rely on potato and urchin heads.

"I've seen your cursed technique. It is powerful, but the problem is that you can't consistently land it on a fast enemy. You're also physically too weak to keep up. If you can actually find a way to control your Hairpins instead of only shooting them, then you might have provided me with some challenge."

Sukuna's words echoed inside her head once again, taunting her. Nobara threw herself on her bed and screamed into her pillow in frustration. She understood, okay! She needed to level up! As much as she loathed listening to a curse for feedback, she knew that Sukuna was one of the strongest beings in the Jujutsu world.

FINE!

Nobara might be a bit vain, but she wasn’t someone who let her ego stop her. The teen got up from her bed and stomped her way out of her room. Now, where the hell was potato head right now? Oh yeah, didn’t Gojo take him somewhere so he wouldn’t be in the dormitory for a while?

With a new goal in mind, Nobara made her way toward her objective. It wasn’t hard to find Itadori. When she asked Ijichi about her classmate, the older man offered to take her to Gojo's house. According to him, their teacher had assigned Itadori special training to help him control his cursed energy. Gojo wanted Itadori to train without distraction, so he took the teen to his home.

Luckily, Gojo's house wasn’t too far from Jujutsu High, and they reached it within ten minutes. Nobara’s eyes widened as she took in the large house before her. This was Gojo’s house? It had a huge-ass garden! Also, how many floors did the building have?

"How rich is that guy?" Nobara wondered out loud, half in awe and half in annoyance.

"Ah well," Ijichi said, fixing his glasses. "Since he is the head of the Gojo clan and the strongest sorcerer, Gojo-san has access to ample funds. This place is only one of his properties in the area, but since it’s the closest to Jujutsu High, he placed Yuuji-kun here."

Nobara gritted her teeth. She couldn’t accept this. "Don’t tell me potato head is currently lazing around in luxury?! This is favoritism! Favoritism, I say!"

Ijichi laughed weakly. "I don’t think you need to worry about that."

Ijichi was correct, and he proved it by taking her to the property’s basement. Although it was big, it was still a basement. Nobara stared at the stairs leading underground. "Potato head is here?"

"Yes," Ijichi replied quite dejectedly. It seemed he was of the opinion that Itadori’s placement was pitiful.

Nobara didn’t know whether to feel delighted or sad about her friend's situation. Anyway, that wasn’t important. She had a mission. Ijichi didn’t follow her and only told her that he would wait in the car until she returned. Nobara merely gave a thumbs-up and continued walking. She soon saw her classmate sitting on a couch, watching a movie on a big TV.

Nobara wanted to ask what the hell Itadori was doing when she saw him shoveling a bunch of popcorn into his mouth. Now, she wouldn’t have felt strange if it were his mouth, but he was actually feeding a second mouth on his cheek. Her own mouth hung open.

A red eye locked on her.

Nobara stiffened under that familiar gaze.

"Brat, you’ve got a visitor," Sukuna said before disappearing from Itadori’s skin.

"Hmm?" Itadori turned to her, his eyes widening. "Kugisaki! What are you doing here?!"

Nobara could only gape at Itadori for several seconds before she snapped, "I should be asking you that, idiot! What are you doing watching movies with the King of Curses?!"

"Eh? But this is my training?" Itadori said. "Gojo-sensei told me to keep this cursed corpse asleep while I watch movies." He showed her the doll in his arms. It looked like it was sleeping, like a real animal, despite being made out of cotton and fabric. "As for Sukuna, well, it feels kind of bad to watch the films alone when he's around, you know."

Nobara gave him a flat stare. "No, I don’t get it."

It was clear that Itadori had no issues being buddy-buddy with the King of Curses. The goddamn teen was the personification of a golden retriever. It shouldn’t surprise her that he couldn’t see the warning signs around the curse. ‘Don’t approach!’ ‘Dangerous!’ He probably saw those words and thought the curse seemed lonely and needed a friend.

Nobara felt she needed to berate Itadori for his decisions, but then she remembered she wasn’t the teen's teacher, and it was all Gojo’s problem.

Nobara waved her hand and said, "Whatever, I’m here to speak with Sukuna."

"You want to speak with Sukuna?" Itadori blinked. "I guess that’s fine by me, but it depends on whether or not he wants to speak with you."

Nobara clicked her tongue. "Fine. Hey! Old man! Come out. I want to talk to you for a sec!"

Itadori looked slightly embarrassed by her actions, but Nobara ignored him. She found that being direct was the best way to get what she wanted. In this case, her approach was correct. The curse manifested on Yuuji’s cheek again, and the red eye returned to stare at her.

"What do you want?" Sukuna asked.

Nobara placed her hands on her hips. "It’s about what you said back then. You know, about me being too slow and weak. I want to hear more about your opinion."

The curse stared at her for a moment. His red eye frowned in contemplation. "Are you sure you wouldn’t rather speak with your teacher? If you haven’t forgotten, I’m a curse."

"Ain’t no way I’m forgetting what you are," Nobara replied. "As for Gojo, I’ll ask the guy about this later, but I don’t see why I can’t ask you about it too. You were the one who brought it up in the first place."

Itadori’s eyes were wide open as he listened to them talk. Nobara really would have preferred to have this conversation privately, but since Sukuna and his vessel were a package deal, there was nothing she could do.

"Fine," Sukuna said. "I don’t believe my words are particularly hard to understand. As far as I can see, there are two things you can do to improve yourself. First, you must enhance your physical capabilities. Though, I doubt this will help much in the long term. Unfortunately, you’re human, and you are not one of those people blessed with the Heavenly Restriction. Thus, you won’t be able to keep up with special-grade curses in terms of sheer power. However, it’s still important for you to strengthen your body so you can fully utilize your ability."

Nobara nodded. Although she was quite fit, she knew she was nothing compared to Fushiguro, much less Itadori, who could punch through walls. "What else?"

Sukuna continued, "Another way is to enhance your cursed technique. I can think of several methods to increase your lethality, but I suggest you focus on your Hairpins. They are quite powerful, but your inability to consistently hit faster enemies is a big drawback. One way you can cover this weakness is by learning to control your nails once you launch them."

"That's what gives me a headache!" Nobara interrupted. She knew she shouldn’t, but she had been bothered by this topic for days. "I know what you're saying, but there's no way I can change the trajectory of my nails. The most I can do is activate them at a later time, but there’s no way I can control them like you suggest! My nails cannot contain the proper amount of cursed energy required to do that trick!"

"Then simply change your nails to something else," Sukuna said, his voice bored.

"What?" Nobara blinked.

The curse rolled an eye. "Do you think you can only use plain nails? Have you forgotten the existence of cursed weapons?"

"You mean like the cool sword Gojo-sensei gave me?" Itadori asked.

Sukuna replied, "Yes, something like that. However, instead of a sword, you could look for something similar to your nails. A needle, perhaps?"

Nobara frowned and crossed her arms. Sukuna's suggestion seemed possible. Unlike Itadori's knife, she could see herself adding needles to her arsenal. It also wouldn’t change the way she fought too much. "That's a great idea, but where can I get my hands on something so niche? Not to mention, a weapon like that will definitely be expensive! I'm not that rich. Do you know how little Jujutsu High gives students in terms of money? I can barely cover my shopping expenses!"

"What about your teacher?" Sukuna asked, his eye curved in interest. "I believe he has great resources and connections. I doubt he’ll have trouble finding something useful for his dear students."

That might work. Although Gojo loved to act like a buffoon, Nobara knew the man was powerful and could become serious when required. She also doubted that he would mind her asking him for help.

"I accept your suggestion!" Nobara exclaimed, pointing her finger at the curse. "Now I just need to find that ridiculous teacher and get my hands on my new weapon. Huh, who would've thought that the King of Curses could be this helpful?" She grinned. "Are you sure you don’t mind giving me ideas on how to kill you?"

"I welcome your attempts," Sukuna said, clearly not taking her possible threat seriously. "I don’t find joy in seeing wasted potential. If you can actually improve, that would be more than enough payment for me."

With those parting words, the curse disappeared once again from Itadori's skin, leaving the two teens staring at each other.

"Um… congrats?" Itadori said, scratching his cheek. The teen looked unsure how to process the interaction between his classmate and the King of Curses.

Nobara snorted. "Has he always been this cooperative?"

Itadori frowned, placing his face on top of the cursed corpse's head. "I guess… He’s never been this chatty, though."

Nobara rolled her eyes. Now that she had gotten what she wanted, she remembered what she wanted to say to the other teen. "Try not to get too buddy-buddy with the King of Curses, potato head. He's a curse."

Itadori shot her a flat look. "You don’t have a right to say that after conversing with Sukuna about your cursed technique."

Omake:

Sukuna: Yuuji is bonding with me? Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

Sukuna: Why is Nobara visiting Yuuji??

Sukuna: Why are the kids approaching me these days??? Have they forgotten that I'm the King of Curses??????

 

Nobara: Where the hell are you, Gojo?! (๑`^´๑)

Yuuji: I also want to get feedback from Sukuna. (ᗒᗣᗕ)՞
Notes:

    I'm not quite sure how to upgrade Nobara's power, but she definitely needs it if she wants to survive in the future. So this is my best attempt, lol.
    I know this chapter is pretty uneventful compared to the previous ones but I think I need to start establishing good connections between Sukuna and the kids.
    Megumi is the hardest nut to crack, though.

Chapter 6

Chapter Text

Satoru was usually a very busy person. However, after his recent confrontation with the higher-ups, those pesky elders seemed to avoid him like the plague. While this wouldn’t last very long, at least it gave him a bit more free time these past few days. Of course, there was no rest for the strongest sorcerer. There were always more curses to kill and damsels to save. Still, Satoru appreciated the chance to spend time with the first years. Since Yuuji was still training at home, there were only Megumi and Nobara in the dormitory. Of course, he would visit the kid later. He didn’t want to make Yuuji feel abandoned, after all.

It was currently dinner time, and Megumi was preparing his own meal while Satoru happily watched his ward from the table. The teen tried to ignore him for a long time, but he eventually cracked and shot him a dark look. “What are you doing here? Don’t you have better things to do?”

“Aw, why can’t I spend some time with my student?” Satoru smiled while resting his head on his hands. “Don’t you miss me, Megumi? I’ve been pretty busy these past weeks, but now I’ve got more free time! Aren’t you glad?”

Megumi only returned his gaze to the sizzling pan. “Tch. I already saw you enough during classes. Go back to where you came from.” His tone was akin to someone shooing away a stray cat who had wandered into their home to steal their food. Rude. If Satoru were a cat, he’d be one of those ridiculously expensive felines with a pure white coat and bright blue eyes.

Satoru didn’t let the words bother him. Megumi had always liked to act distant ever since he was a child. It had never stopped him before, and it certainly wouldn’t stop him now. Luckily for his ward, before Satoru could launch another teasing remark, the door to the dining room opened with a bang.

“Gojo Satoru! There you are!” With those loud words, Nobara appeared, her expression energized and wild.

“Aiya? Is my student looking for her lovely teacher?” Satoru turned his attention to Nobara with a bright smile.

“I’ve been looking for you for hours now!” Nobara stomped toward Satoru with a fierce expression. “Where the hell have you been?”

Satoru tilted his head. “I’ve just come back from a mission. Is there something wrong?” He was pretty sure the elders wouldn’t be making any noise anytime soon, but those geezers were pretty stupid. So, he might’ve overestimated their intelligence again.

“Of course there is!” Nobara exclaimed, but she didn’t look distressed at all. “I need you to find something for me!”

“What is it?” It was rare for his students to ask for favors. Although young, all students who enrolled at Jujutsu High were independent. They rarely sought his help unless it was absolutely necessary.

“I need a weapon,” Nobara said, taking a seat in front of him. “A cursed weapon, preferably needles, that can contain a lot of my cursed energy and be influenced from afar for a decent amount of time.”

“Oh?” This sparked Satoru’s interest. Most of his students relied on their innate cursed techniques; only Maki had to rely on cursed weapons to help her due to her Heavenly Restriction. Nobara was also another person with a great cursed technique, so it was quite a surprise that she wanted her own cursed weapon.

“After the ass-kicking, I got at the detention center, I know I need to get better.” Nobara locked her eyes with Satoru, determination flaring like a bonfire. “So, I’ve been looking for a way to improve my cursed technique. Although I prefer to use nails, many powerful curses can easily dodge them, so I want something that I can control even from afar.”

Megumi, who had finished making his dinner, sat at the table. Hearing her words, he looked at his friend with a frown. “Kugisaki, isn’t that...”

Nobara looked at him and nodded. “Yeah, I’ve been thinking about Sukuna’s words, and I think he’s right.”

Sukuna.

That name immediately made Satoru pause. He had thought he could relax for a bit, but the King of Curses had somehow made his way into the conversation between his kids. What had he done now?

Megumi said, “You shouldn’t listen to a curse, Kugisaki.”

Nobara waved her hand. “I know, I know. I gotta be wary of him, but he’s locked up inside Potato Head for now, so I don’t see the point of being that cautious. Anyway, I spoke with him a few hours ago.”

“What?!” Megumi exclaimed, while Satoru straightened in his seat. Nobara speaking with the King of Curses was definitely not on his bingo card this month.

“Calm down; he didn’t get out or anything.” Nobara continued, looking bored despite her friend's and teacher’s shock. “He just spoke using the mouth on Itadori’s cheek. It was weird, I tell you. But he was giving me useful tips, so…” She shrugged as if chatting with Sukuna was normal. The sky is blue. Water is wet. Nobara just spoke with the King of Curses.

Satoru wanted to laugh. He knew sorcerers were a bit crazy, but his kids seemed to take it a step too far. Megumi had a pinched look on his face, and he looked as if he didn’t know where to start addressing his issues.

“In short, the almighty King of Curses told me that you can help. So, can you?” Nobara looked at Satoru again.

“Oh, he said that?” Satoru tilted his head and touched his chin. Sukuna had always given extra attention to him whenever they met, but he didn’t know the King of Curses had such a high opinion of him.

Nobara crossed her arms. “Yeah, and I also saw your stupidly expensive house. So I know that you’re rich! Don’t you dare say that you can’t find that weapon!”

It wasn’t as if Satoru had ever considered rejecting his student’s request. Not only that, although finding such a weapon would be a challenge for most people, his status and resources should allow him to, if not find, then make such a cursed weapon for Nobara. His only problem with this situation was Sukuna’s role in offering this suggestion to his kid.

First, Yuuji, and now Nobara. What was the King of Curses planning? One would have thought that someone like Sukuna wouldn’t lower themselves to play nice with a group of human teenagers. Satoru himself wouldn’t have believed such a possibility if not for the fact that it was happening right before his eyes. The darned curse was certainly more shrewd than he preferred.

Seeing Satoru not say anything for a while, Nobara began tapping her fingers on the table. “So?”

“Sure! Leave it to your dependable teacher!” Satoru gave a thumbs up. He could see that this was important to the teen. Although he didn’t want to play into Sukuna’s mysterious plan, he also couldn’t bear rejecting his student’s request. Well, whatever, he would just need to keep an extra close eye on the curse. “I’ll make sure to have it ready well before the exchange event so you can show off in front of your senpais!”

“You better keep your word, sensei!” Nobara said with a wide grin. “Alright, I’m gonna go sort my shopping items. Bye!” Now that she had gotten what she wanted, the teen quickly ditched her teacher and classmate to return to her dorm room.

Satoru and Megumi could only watch as Nobara disappeared. His ward looked as though he had swallowed a whole lemon and hadn’t started eating his food yet.

“The two of them are too reckless,” Megumi grumbled, not appreciating how Sukuna had wriggled his way into Yuuji’s and Nobara’s good graces. “Idiots.”

Satoru couldn’t help but tease, “Aiya, Megumi-kun, no need to be so stressed, or you’ll soon get gray hairs.”

“Shut up. You’re the one who already had a head full of white hair since you were a baby.”

“But I look great with it!” Satoru said. “Just ask all those women and girls who can’t help but swoon whenever I show up!”

“It’s because they don’t know your horrible personality,” Megumi said. Although he still looked tense, his shoulders were no longer as stiff.

Satoru smiled as he slid down in his chair. “There’s no need to worry too much, Megumi. While your friends can be rash, they have a good head on their shoulders.”

Megumi snorted and stabbed his fish with his chopsticks. “I doubt that. You didn’t see how they acted in the detention center. Putting aside Itadori’s decision to make a Binding Vow with Sukuna, did you know that Nobara trash-talked the curse?”

“Eh?” Although Satoru had heard a short recap of the disastrous mission, he didn’t have time to grill his students or Ijichi about the whole timeline of events.

“Yeah, when we saw that Sukuna had exited the building instead of Itadori, Kugisaki told the curse to return to his kennel like a good dog.”

Satoru cackled. He wished he had been there to see the expression on Sukuna’s face. The curse definitely hadn’t expected to encounter that level of irreverence. Man, he had hoped to be the first person to break that calm facade, but Nobara had beaten him to it.

Megumi smiled but continued, “I admit it was funny, but it caused Sukuna to start attacking us.”

Satoru stopped laughing. Ah, yes, he had heard how Sukuna had tossed his students around like ragdolls.

“Looking back on it, Sukuna didn’t take us seriously at all.” Megumi clasped his hands together tightly. “Despite only having a shred of his full power, he is entirely on another level. If it hadn’t been for the Vow, he could have killed us in seconds. But… it’s weird that he didn’t injure us more. Even if he had cut off one of your limbs, as long as we weren’t dead by the time Itadori woke up, he wouldn’t have broken the Vow.”

Yeah, that was what Satoru had been thinking about. For someone infamous for being cruel and ruthless, the King of Curses had shown considerable restraint when dealing with the kids.

Megumi shook his head. “After tossing us around, Sukuna lectured us about our weaknesses.”

“That’s when he told Nobara about how she could improve her cursed technique,” Satoru guessed.

“Yeah.” Megumi nodded. “He also said some things to me. He said… he said I was holding back. That I didn’t care if I died. That he…” Megumi gulped and locked eyes with Satoru. “Sensei, I think he knew about my trump card.”

Satoru stilled.

Megumi’s trump card.

Mahoraga.

The thought that Sukuna knew about the most powerful shikigami of the Ten Shadows Technique set deep unease within Satoru. He knew he shouldn’t be so astonished. The King of Curses had gleaned Satoru’s identity and cursed technique within seconds, so it wasn’t impossible for him to know about Megumi’s power.

Still, that understanding did nothing to alleviate Satoru’s worry. Was Sukuna aiming to claim Megumi’s body? It would be one of the most dangerous situations that could happen. Sukuna was already powerful enough on his own, but if he managed to gain access to the Ten Shadows Technique, he would be nigh unstoppable. Satoru’s chances of winning the fight against the curse would also be considerably lower.

However, if Sukuna had such a plan, then why would he hint about it to Megumi? Wouldn’t it be better to keep his mouth shut and wait for the best moment to achieve his goal? Once again, Satoru was stumped in his attempt to understand the King of Curses' way of thinking. Whenever he felt that he almost glimpsed Sukuna’s true thoughts, the curse immediately showed another card and changed the course of the game.

Satoru almost spiraled deeper into his mind, but Megumi said, “... Then, Sukuna told me that I have a weak mindset and that I would die because of it.”

That… almost sounded like advice? Actually, it was somewhat similar to what Satoru had been thinking about Megumi’s approach to fighting. The kid always had a slight suicidal tendency, and Satoru was trying to find a way to address that. But now, Sukuna had beaten him to it and pointed out that problem to the teen first. Satoru felt like ripping his hair out from sheer frustration, but he loved his appearance too much to destroy it actively.

Megumi didn’t seem to mind Satoru’s lack of response. The teen was also too caught up in his own musings. “After that, I…” Megumi stopped speaking, obviously debating whether or not he wanted to say the next part aloud. Satoru’s senses were tingling. His ward was hiding something interesting, but the teen didn’t want to say anything about it. After another second, Megumi continued, “Anyway, he healed us, and then Itadori returned.”

Satoru pouted. He wanted to find out Megumi’s secret, but based on the firm line of his lips, Satoru doubted he would spill. It was more likely that the teen would shut down further conversation. In the end, Satoru could only accept the change of topic. “Reverse Cursed Technique, huh? The King of Curses is certainly talented. I'm sure Shoko will be interested to know there is another great healer among us.”

Megumi didn’t find Satoru’s attempt at a joke funny. The kid was clearly stressed about the existence of the King of Curses. Unlike his friends, who could put off future worries and focus on the present, Megumi had always loved to overthink and fret over many things.

“Didn’t I tell you to stop worrying, Megumi?” Satoru leaned forward and grinned at his ward. “Your teacher is still here. Whatever Sukuna is planning, I’ll take care of it. Remember, I’m the strongest.”

Megumi tried to send him a dry look, but Satoru could see the anxiety bleeding away from his eyes. It was still there, of course, but it was no longer as heavy to the point of overwhelming the kid. “You better. The higher-ups didn’t pay you to hang around and look pretty.”

“But I’m the prettiest guy here!” Satoru protested. He even took off his blindfold to bat his long eyelashes at his ward. Unfortunately, unlike most people, Megumi was utterly immune to his appearance, and the teen simply ignored him in favor of eating his dinner.

Omake:

Satoru: Urgent! Waiting Online. My kids have started to befriend the devil. What should I do? .·°՞(¯□¯)՞°·.

Nobara: Ha ha! I’m gonna level up! Just wait and see Sukuna! ᕙ(  •̀ ᗜ •́  )ᕗ

Megumi: I’m the only sane person here. (눈_눈)
Notes:

    Okay, so regarding Sukuna's healing power, it is along the lines of soul manipulation. It's not as OP as Mahito's, but it's more about healing the soul. Since SIkuna is actually another soul that takes the original Sukuna's place, I want the process to leave a mark on SIkuna. He can't shapeshift humans into weird creatures like Mahito, but he can heal soul damage that is also reflected in their bodies. Does it actually make sense according to the power system in JJK? Probably not. But it's my fic, and I can do whatever I want!
    Edit: So someone pointed out that Sukuna isn't actually a cursed spirit, but only an incarnated being and cursed object. That means he can perform the reverse cursed technique just fine, but I'll still keep the soul-healing ability anyway. (っ- ‸ - ς)
    Also, let me go over some JJK terminologies.
    From my research, Cursed Spirits only refer to creatures born from regular human dark emotions, like Mahito and Jogo. On the other hand, curse is a broader term that includes several things, from cursed spirits, incarnated beings, cursed techniques, to Yuuta's act of cursing Rika.
    So you can consider cursed spirits as curses, but you can't consider incarnated beings like Sukuna as cursed spirits. He is still labelled a curse though. Does it confuse you? It sure confuses me.

Chapter 7
Chapter Text

While Satoru always tried to appear composed and easygoing, he knew the recent events had stressed him out a bit. Sukuna had been nothing like he had imagined. The King of Curses was known for his cruelty and violence, yet the one he encountered was more like a viper calmly observing its prey. The prey, in this instance, was his students. Yuuji and Nobara were already somewhat within Sukuna’s grasp, while Megumi still held the proper caution toward the King of Curses.

So far, Sukuna had not shown any malice toward them. However, this was likely just a sweet, poisoned apple that would harm them at some point in the future. Satoru still wasn’t sure what exactly the curse could be planning. With those heavy thoughts, he entered Ijichi’s car, and they drove toward the meeting spot with Yaga. His kouhai seemed to notice his dark mood, and the man fidgeted in his seat. Unfortunately for him, Satoru wasn’t in a talkative mood, so Ijichi could only suffer in silence.

Perhaps heaven had finally taken pity on his kouhai, as Satoru sensed a presence in the middle of the forest. Well, it seemed he could actually vent his annoyance on something after all. “Stop the car.”

Ijichi flinched despite Satoru’s calm tone. He looked as if he was waiting for his senpai to deck him in the face. “Huh? Right here?” The man examined their surroundings, which were basically in the middle of nowhere. Although he wasn’t sure what Satoru was thinking, he was used to following the sorcerer’s whims. The car stopped, and Satoru quickly exited the vehicle.

“Go on ahead,” Satoru said. He didn’t want Ijichi to get caught up in the fight, nor did he want to worry about the man. He really needed to release his frustration, and the appropriate target was already serving itself on a platter.

“H-huh? Are you testing me?” Ijichi was nearly panicking. “You’re not going to hit me if I actually go on ahead, are you?”

“Just what do you think I am?” Hearing those words, Satoru was tempted to fulfill his wish and hit Ijichi. Maybe a good smack would awaken some of his kouhai’s brain cells.

Seeing Satoru’s ticked-off face, Ijichi didn’t bother to protest and quickly ran away. The sorcerer watched the fleeing man with slight annoyance. However, his attention was quickly grabbed by a presence above him. He easily dodged the attack, and the cursed spirit landed heavily on the road, cracking the asphalt.

Based on its aura and power, Satoru knew it was an unregistered special grade. Come on. Ever since Sukuna was reincarnated, trouble had popped up like annoying bugs. He simply asked, “Who are you?” A curse with this level of intelligence certainly had a name.

A weird mound manifested beside the wall near him, but Satoru didn’t bother to dodge. A massive stream of lava exploded from its opening, covering him from head to toe. He was somewhat amused as he examined how the colors of fire and lava combined. It was quite pretty, but definitely not as pretty as his eyes.

The cursed spirit cackled, overly confident. “That was easier than I expected.”

“Who are you calling easy?” Satoru asked as the lava dissipated, leaving him unharmed. Although he hated it, he sort of understood Sukuna looking down on him. After all, he was the King of Curses, who claimed the title of the strongest during the Heian era. But this weakling dared to underestimate Satoru? The nerve. He would use its head as a soccer ball so the thing would understand the meaning of ‘respect.’

The two exchanged some words, but the curse seemed content with its arrogance. It grinned at him as if it were the one controlling the situation. “Did I wound your pride?” it taunted.

Satoru cracked his fingers. “Nah, I’m starting to find this fun.” Oh, he would enjoy teaching this cursed spirit why he was called the strongest Jujutsu sorcerer.

“Ember Insects!” The curse launched several ugly-looking monsters with great confidence.

“You really have no sense of danger, huh?” The insects flew toward Satoru like bullets, but his Infinity easily stopped them. They began to writhe and scream like wretched babies before they exploded instantaneously.

Although the blast wouldn’t hurt Satoru, he had no interest in inhaling smoke, so he changed his position. The curse didn’t waste its chance to attack him directly with another fire blast. Satoru didn’t bother dodging this one either. He would let the cursed spirit feel satisfied with itself before he broke down its stupid arrogance.

“That human was just as fragile as the rest,” the curse muttered to itself. It then continued rambling about truth, strength, and death as it walked away. Really? Why were there so many delusional people and curses in this world?

“We just went over this a moment ago. Can’t you even learn?” Satoru said as he removed the smoke covering him.

The curse stopped in its tracks and turned to him with wide eyes. Oh, had it finally sunk in? If it even had a brain. Well, Satoru always liked to teach, so he didn’t mind explaining his power to this special grade. He even offered to give an example. The curse hesitated to approach him, but his lack of hostility finally convinced it to satisfy its curiosity.

Satoru couldn’t stop the glee that spread in his chest as he took in the wide-eyed look on the cursed spirit’s face. It never failed to bring him joy whenever his enemies realized that he was nigh untouchable. Eventually, his impish side couldn’t help but show up, and he began to tease the curse.

Satoru had made baiting others and making them lose their cool an art form. While Sukuna always stayed calm when dealing with the sorcerer, the special grade before him couldn’t help but be enraged as Satoru mocked it.

“Damn you!” the curse screamed.

Satoru slammed his fist into the cursed spirit’s gut but kept his hold on its hand tight. It spouted out familiar purple blood, but he continued to rain down punches and kicks. He completed his combo by sending Red at the curse, which hit it straight in the face.

The cursed technique didn’t kill the curse, but it blasted the monster away. The cursed spirit attempted to create some distance, but Satoru teleported behind it and slammed another kick into its body. Man, it felt great beating up bad guys~

The cursed spirit tried to attack Satoru with another blast of energy. Useless. Satoru merely grinned as he punted the thing toward a nearby lake. It landed in the water, temporarily stunned by the impact.

At that moment, Satoru got a great idea. Although he doubted it was intentional, Sukuna had tried to take his place as a teacher. That wouldn’t do. So, this was the perfect moment to show Yuuji just how amazing Satoru was. He was miles better than the King of Curses. He was good-looking, powerful, and hadn’t eaten any humans before. Anyone would agree that he was the better role model!

Seeing the curse wouldn’t get up anytime soon, Satoru teleported back to the basement. The kid didn’t notice his presence, too busy watching the movie on the TV. On the other hand, the one red eye on his cheek immediately locked onto the man. It curved into a knowing look before disappearing.

‘Darned curse,’ Satoru thought to himself.

Yuuji seemed to hear something from Sukuna since the boy immediately turned toward him. “Gojo-sensei!”

Satoru was pleased to see that the cursed corpse continued to sleep despite Yuuji being distracted. Although the kid was a complete newbie, he was talented at picking up new skills.

“Do you need something?” Yuuji asked.

“We’re going out, Yuuji! You’ll get a special extracurricular lesson!” Satoru smirked. Let’s see how Sukuna up this one. “I’m going to show you the pinnacle of Jujutsu battles: Domain Expansion.”

Yuuji’s eyes widened in interest. Satoru grabbed the kid’s hoodie and warped them back to the lake, where he had left the cursed spirit. The teen began squirming when he suddenly found himself being picked up like a kitten. He became even more energized when he noticed they were in a completely different place.

“Where the heck are we?!” Yuuji exclaimed.

Satoru ignored his student in favor of addressing the cursed spirit. It was going to help him teach, so he would give it some face. “Were you waiting?”

The curse showed recognition when it gazed at Yuuji. Hmm. It seemed that even cursed spirits knew about Sukuna’s vessel. He had hoped to shield Yuuji for much longer before he had to deal with the burden of his status.

“This is Itadori Yuuji-kun!” Satoru lifted his student higher. “He’s here to watch our fight.”

“Mount Fuji! His head is Mount Fuji!” Yuuji aptly pointed out when he noticed the curse before them.

Satoru wanted to laugh, but the cursed spirit didn’t seem to pay attention to the slight. In fact, it looked quite pinched. Hmm. His senses told him that this curse knew something important~

“What’s the brat for? Are you going to make him your shield?” the curse asked.

“A shield? No way!” Satoru replied. “I told you, he’s here to watch. Yuuji-kun here needs to learn a lot of things. There’s no need to worry about him; just focus on fighting.”

“Bringing someone who will slow you down? How foolish!” the special grade mocked.

Satoru laughed lightly. “It’ll be fine! After all… you’re w-e-a-k.” He articulated the last word slowly and gave a grin.

The taunt worked like a charm, and the curse completely lost its temper. Seeing three fountains of flames coming out of its head was quite funny. Maybe some rich asshole would pay for a fountain like that. The cursed spirit began to vomit threats that Satoru couldn’t take seriously. It even blasted out a wave of cursed energy that disturbed the calm lake’s surface. Really. All bark, but no bite.

Although the sight didn’t bother him, he noticed Yuuji’s unease. That was understandable; the kid was very young and new at this, so it was no wonder he was daunted by facing the special grade. Satoru wasn’t too worried, though. He knew Yuuji had the potential to become another powerful special-grade sorcerer. He just needed to provide the kid with a safe and stable environment to grow.

Satoru placed a hand on Yuuji’s head and brought his attention to him. “You’ll be fine. Just stay close to me.”

It seemed the curse had stopped barking and now made a sign with its hands. “Domain Expansion: Coffin of the Iron Mountain!”

The surroundings around them quickly shifted as the curse expanded its domain. The cool water turned into fiery lava, and rough mountain rocks covered the sky.

“W-what the hell is this?!” Yuuji looked stunned and scared at the sudden change. On the other hand, Satoru examined the situation with slight boredom. He could break the domain immediately, but he wanted to see what the curse could pull off.

Although Yuuji looked distracted, Satoru calmly explained the basics of Domain Expansion to his student. As the lecture progressed, the kid slowly lost his panic and began to respond. Great, it seemed his decision to bring Yuuji here wasn’t a mistake. While reading from books was great, Satoru knew that having real experience was better for understanding concepts like these.

Now, it was time to end this farce. Satoru slowly pulled off his blindfold and opened his eyes. Sensing upcoming danger, the curse tried to attack him and his student. Unfortunately for it, unleashing his own domain was almost as easy as breathing to him.

“Domain Expansion: Infinite Void.”

Satoru’s domain quickly overpowered the curse’s. The creature could only remain frozen as torrents of information poured into its empty skull. He firmly grabbed Yuuji with one arm and teleported behind the cursed spirit. With his other hand, he grabbed the top of the creature’s head. He explained his domain to Yuuji and the curse, but unfortunately, the kid didn’t seem to understand any of his words. Oh well, Yuuji’s strength was never in his intelligence.

“I’ve got some questions for you, so I’ll let you off the hook with this.” Satoru tightened his grasp and detached the curse’s head from its body. Once it was done, he dismissed his domain, teleported to nearby land, and let the appendage fall to the ground.

The head bounced several times before Satoru firmly placed his foot on it. He slipped his blindfold back on and asked, “Now, who told you to come after me?”

The curse didn’t answer his question. Although it no longer had a body, he doubted it could no longer speak. Cursed spirits were weird like that.

“Was something good supposed to happen if you killed me?” Satoru asked again. Seeing that the creature refused to speak, he began to kick the head around like a soccer ball. The cursed spirit only gritted its teeth. How annoying. He stepped down on the head again. “Come on, tell me!”

“Like, I’d ever tell you, brat!” the curse spat.

Brat? Did it really have the right to call Satoru that? The man increased the pressure on the head. He could have popped it like an annoying pimple, but the curse held important information. He tried to threaten it, but the cursed spirit wouldn’t budge.

It was annoying, irritating, and infuriating. Too many curses and people were testing his patience these days—first, Sukuna, then the elders, and now this cursed spirit. Satoru began to stomp his foot on the head, wanting to flatten it into a pancake. It wouldn’t die. Probably.

“Uh… sensei, aren’t you torturing it too much?” Yuuji said concernedly from the side.

Ah, the kid was too nice, even to cursed spirits. He really needed to toughen his heart a bit.

The curse spouted purple blood as Satoru continued to kick and stomp on its head. It still didn’t want to speak. How dare it? Unlike Sukuna, who could hide inside Yuuji’s body, nothing could protect this curse from his wrath.

“Come…”

Kick.

“On”

Stomp.

“Speak”

Kick.

“Up”

Stomp.

“I”

Kick.

“Can”

Stomp.

“Do”

Kick.

“This”

Stomp.

“All”

Kick.

“Night”

Stomp.

“Sensei…” Yuuji weakly tried to interrupt.

At that point, a plant suddenly sprouted and interrupted his interrogation. A field of flowers then bloomed, offering a wonderful smell and sight to the world.

‘Flowers~ How pretty~’

Satoru’s instinct kicked in a second later, warning him about the danger. He slapped his face to wake himself up. It was definitely a curse trying to lower his guard. Beside him, Yuuji’s foot was caught by a small tree monster, which launched him into the air. Another special-grade curse suddenly showed up and used the opening to retrieve its friend.

Shit.

Satoru had to decide whether to save his student or chase after those creatures. Fortunately for those curses, he always prioritized his students’ safety above all else. He quickly took down the monster and turned around to track the fleeing cursed spirits. Unfortunately, the other special grade was really good at running away.

Satoru noticed Yuuji performing a dogeza and muttering to himself. He caught some words of blame from his student, but he was too busy thinking about the new developments. Powerful special-grade cursed spirits had started working together. Now, this was very interesting but also quite concerning. He had no doubt that Sukuna's reappearance had triggered the curses’ movements.

“Yuuji, I want you and everyone to become strong enough to beat that,” Satoru said.

“Huh? Beat that?” Yuuji looked very doubtful.

“It’s better to have a concrete goal, right?” Satoru smiled. Sukuna’s mysterious words and actions, along with a group of special-grade curses working together, pointed to something big brewing in the dark. He had to make sure his students were ready.

Sukuna: Oh! Is this the time to beat Jogo?! 

Sukuna: Gojo is so cooooool! .o(≧∀≦)o

 

Jogo: Why does this fight feel weirdly personal? ( •̀ - •́ )

Satoru: I can’t beat Sukuna right now, so you’ll have to do! （ꐦ𝅒_𝅒）

Yuuji: Whoa, sensei is so cool but also so scary. (｡Ó﹏Ò｡)
Chapter 8
Chapter Text

As a Jujutsu sorcerer, there were few things in life that were certain for Kento. First, all curses were dangerous and must be dealt with appropriately. Second, all Jujutsu sorcerers died with some regrets. Third, and most importantly, Gojo Satoru was a force of nature that had somehow manifested into a human being. Whatever that man wanted, he would get. If one had to list the number of rules and etiquette Gojo had broken, there would be enough papers to cover Jujutsu High. He was a man blessed by heaven, and he made sure everyone knew it.

Unfortunately, Kento was one of Gojo’s favorite targets. While Gojo was blessed by whatever god existed up there, Kento was cursed with the position of being his kouhai. The day he stepped foot into Jujutsu High was the moment his fate had been sealed. He was branded as one of Gojo’s. While some might think of it as a boon, it was mostly a curse. Kento liked stability and routine, yet his senpai thrived on the exact opposite. He hated anything ordinary, boring, and normal. Anyone who had to deal with a bored Gojo had Kento’s full sympathy. Sadly, that person was often Kento himself.

Today was one such day. Kento had hoped for a regular, boring week. However, Lady Luck was not on his side, as he somehow drew Gojo's attention. Kento felt the beginning of a shiver, but he steeled his resolve and opted to ignore the tall man. Of course, this was a useless act. Once Gojo set his sights on something, he wouldn’t stop poking it until he was satisfied. His latest experience had reminded him very well of that fact. Kento could still recall the paper containing a crudely drawn genital that he had found inside his pocket.

“Nanami!” the gratingly happy voice called out to him.

Kento wanted to ignore him; he really did. But experience had taught him that it was better to let Gojo do whatever he wanted and pick up the pieces afterward. So, with a heavy heart, Kento closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and turned around. “What is it?”

Gojo sported a wide smile as he approached with light feet. Kento almost wanted to take a step back as he saw his doom coming toward him. “Your great senpai has an important request!”

Kento didn’t know what Gojo would need from him, considering he was much more powerful and wealthier. Whatever it was, it would only bring him a headache. Yet, there was nothing he could do but listen and follow whatever whims this manchild had cooked up. “I’m listening.”

“I need you to take care of one of my kids,” Gojo said, giving him finger guns.

“Is it Fushiguro?” Kento asked. If it was him, there might be a chance that Gojo wouldn’t ruin his month. Despite being under Gojo’s care for many years, that child had kept his sanity intact and retained his sensibility and decency. That kid truly lived up to his name.

Gojo shook his head. “Nah, I’m talking about Itadori Yuuji, you know him, right?”

“The vessel of the King of Curses.” Who hadn’t heard of that child? Although Gojo tried to keep him hidden, almost everyone in the Jujutsu world immediately became aware of the infamous figure's reemergence. Kento had been trying to keep his distance because he knew nothing good would come of this situation. The probability of something going wrong increased exponentially when Gojo and the elders began their usual spat. Kento should’ve known that Gojo would eventually drag him into this madness.

“His name is Itadori Yuuji,” Gojo repeated. There was still a smile on his face, but Kento knew he had hit one of Gojo’s sore spots. While the man was very blasé about rules and duties, he was very protective of his students. He had fought for Okkotsu Yuuta’s life, and now he would do the same for Itadori.

It was quite obvious that Gojo didn’t like people merely seeing the kid as a vessel and not a human being. Not that Kento could ever forget that Itadori was a young teen who got trapped in this mess because he ate something he shouldn’t have. However, he also understood the elders’ worries and the possible bad events that might occur with Sukuna’s revival. He had learned a lot about that infamous figure during his time at Jujutsu High, and he learned even more when he heard that Gojo had found Sukuna’s vessel.

“I see,” Kento said.

Although they didn’t exchange more words than that, Gojo understood what Kento implied. Years of interacting with each other had its boons. Unfortunately, those benefits were far too few for Kento’s taste.

Gojo continued, “Anyway, those geezers are back at it again, and now I’m busy with work. However, after what happened previously, I can’t feel safe leaving the kid alone, so I’m asking you to take care of him while I’m away.”

Ah, yes, the horrible mission where the first-years were forced to face a special-grade curse. Gojo hadn’t shared many details about how the students managed to escape. He merely said that Sukuna had dealt with the cursed spirit but nothing else. The elders were obviously not happy with the lack of information, but after Gojo almost lost his patience with them, they didn’t dare to push him too much for now. Kento almost got another sharp headache when he was reminded that Gojo nearly Hollow Purpled all the higher-ups in anger. Only someone like the strongest sorcerer could afford to act so rebelliously and survive.

“So, can you do it?” Gojo asked, grinning.

Had he ever had a choice to say no when facing Gojo?

That was how Kento found himself standing before Gojo and his students. Correct, students, plural. Kento could already feel a headache building up as he took in the three first-years before him. Fushiguro was a familiar face. The bright-eyed boy had to be Itadori, and the only girl on the team was Kugisaki.

Fushiguro had his ever-present dull look as he scrolled on his phone. Itadori was looking at him with wide-open eyes, which made Kento question whether something was on his face. Kugisaki was busy examining her nails with narrowed eyes.

“I believe you only asked me to take care of Itadori?” Kento asked pointedly.

“Well, what can I say?” Gojo laughed. “When I told them that Itadori was about to go on a mission with you, Fushiguro and Kugisaki wanted to join! What kind of teacher would I be if I rejected them?”

Was there any point in defending Gojo’s honor as a teacher when he was so bad at it? He was not a neglectful or horrible teacher, but he certainly wasn’t a good one. Kento had resigned himself to the fact that all new sorcerers from Tokyo Jujutsu High would come out as rule-breakers with no respect for rules or authority. And now it seemed he would have his first taste of working together with Gojo’s spawns.

“Students!” Gojo clapped his hands once. “This is Nanami Kento! An ex-salaryman! He’ll be the one looking after you guys while I’m away. There are many sorcerers who are weirdos, but he’s reliable. Alright! Time to introduce yourselves. Megumi has met Nanami before, but you can still join if you want.”

Fushiguro didn’t even deign to flick his eyes up from his phone and continued to ignore Gojo. How lucky. The boy was one of the rare individuals who could handle Gojo like an expert. Kento stifled his sigh and performed the proper bow before introducing himself.

Despite the wide-eyed look, Itadori quickly returned the bow, while Kugisaki followed a second later. Fushiguro gave him a nod to acknowledge him but still kept his eyes away from the beaming Gojo. After the necessary exchange was done, Kento immediately went straight to the point: “Itadori, while I don’t like how the higher-ups do things, I still believe in rules, which is why I cannot acknowledge you as a sorcerer.”

Itadori pursed his lips but didn’t interrupt him.

“That’s why, in this mission, I’m hoping you can prove that you’re still useful despite the demon inside of you.” Kento fixed his glasses. “I hope Fushiguro and Kugisaki can understand my intention and will not interfere with the test unless it’s absolutely necessary.”

“Sure, whatever,” Kugisaki replied.

“Understood,” Fushiguro said.

Kento could already imagine how this mission would fail. Although the first-year students were nowhere near as obnoxious as their teacher, they were still agents of chaos who would no doubt complicate the job. He could only hope the problems that arose wouldn’t cause him to go into cardiac arrest.

Investigating the crime scene with the students went quite smoothly, and it started to unnerve Kento slightly. The better things went in the beginning, the bigger the mess that would show up at the end. Still, he could only trudge forward and lead the first-years as they exited the building. It was at this moment that the first problem showed its face. Two creatures crawled out of their hiding spaces and set their attention on them.

“I shall handle one, while Itadori will handle the other,” Kento said as he dropped his umbrella. “Fushiguro and Kugisaki should stay back and only help if Itadori gets into a tight spot. However, don’t hesitate to call me if things get too dangerous. As an adult, I have the duty to prioritize children’s lives above mine.”

With those words, Kento began to engage with the enemy. The monsters were not that strong, and he used this chance to teach the students about the merit of revealing one’s technique. As expected, the creature was taken down with one strike. Itadori also quickly defeated his target with his delayed cursed energy hit. This left Fushiguro and Kugisaki watching with slight interest.

“I see you also leveled up, potato head,” Kugisaki grinned.

“Your cursed energy came out delayed, so you’re basically hitting twice with one punch,” Fushiguro muttered.

Itadori beamed. “Yeah! Gojo-sensei has been helping me with personal training so I can finally use cursed energy reliably. He named it Divergent Fist! Isn’t it cool?!”

The child certainly had fun sharing his progress with his friends, to the point he ignored his target, which was still alive albeit incapacitated. While Kento wanted to reprimand him, he also left his enemy on the ground. He was about to end its existence when he noticed a strange item on its wrist.

Kento frowned. The big trouble finally reared its head. He stopped Itadori from killing the other monster and showed the students the picture he had just taken. The revelation was not received well.

“Humans?!” Kugisaki screeched. “What kind of curse can do such a disgusting thing?!”

Fushiguro didn’t say anything and only frowned even harder.

They decided to rest while they waited for Ieri to examine the remains of the transfigured humans. While Kento was quite sure of his guess, he still felt slightly disturbed when he heard the doctor's confirmation. Itadori took the news the hardest. Kento could see the student gritting his teeth in rage. Just as Gojo had said, the kid had a soft heart that easily cared for others. Although it was not a sin to be kind, such softheartedness might bring endless suffering to the kid.

It didn’t take long for them to locate the possible hideout of their culprit. Whatever had done this was not trying to be subtle and didn’t bother to hide its tracks. Kento had no interest in sending three young teens to face a dangerous curse, and he ordered them to investigate the boy at the movie theater. Considering they were all of the same age, they should be able to gather more information than him. However, he doubted it would be much use in the end, since he aimed to exorcise the perpetrator with ruthless efficiency.

After living in never-ending darkness, this was the first time Junpei felt like he saw light on the horizon. Meeting Mahito had uncovered a whole new world and understanding for the teen. He wanted to spend more time pondering souls, life, and human nature. His thoughts swirled like a fast-moving whirlpool, trapping his attention to the point that he failed to notice his teacher until it was too late.

Junpei had merely wanted to end the conversation as soon as possible. Yet, the moment Sotomura called those trash his friends, it made him snap. He hated them. Hated this world. Hated the adults who pretended not to see. Hated the cruel classmates who couldn’t stop tormenting him. He wanted them to stop existing.

“I support everything you represent, Junpei.”

Junpei raised two fingers. He could do it. Mahito had granted him new power that could erase these worthless creatures. He just needed to—

“STOP!”

Junpei turned around to see another teen leaping toward them while reaching to grab a small flying monster. Their eyes locked. Despite his panicked look, the boy landed on his feet gracefully and approached him. “Hey, I wanna ask you something.”

Junpei was still too stunned by the sudden turn of events, but he quickly noticed the button on the teen’s uniform: Jujutsu High. A sorcerer. Sotomura tried to interrupt them, but the boy looked annoyed, and within a second, he ripped off the man’s pants.

What?

Junpei could only watch with his mouth agape as the teen ran away with his stolen item. Sotomura froze in place, unable to process what had just happened.

“NO WAY! PERVERT!” a high-pitched scream rang out. “SOMEONE HELP!”

Two more teens in similar outfits appeared out of nowhere. The girl covered her face while she shouted about her purity. Beside her, the boy with dark hair was talking on his phone blandly. “Hello, police?”

The word "police" snapped Sotomura from his state, and he quickly tried to defend himself. “No! No! You’ve got it all wrong!”

The teens' deeply doubtful expressions forced the man to run away in search of his missing pants. A second later, the first teen with pink hair returned with a bright smile. Nobody would’ve guessed that this boy had just stolen someone’s pants in broad daylight.

The girl finally stopped covering her face to show a manic grin. She then cackled while holding her stomach. “Did you see his face?! Goddamn, Itadori! I can’t believe you have the guts to do that! I’ve always thought you were goody-two-shoes, but I was wrong.”

“Although highly inappropriate, I approve.” The boy with spiky hair nodded, pocketing his phone.

“You think so?” Itadori scratched his head. “I think it was quite mean, but well…” The boy turned to Junpei. “You don’t like him, right?”

“What?” Junpei still couldn’t fully process the ridiculous event that had just occurred before him. He almost believed he had fallen asleep at some point and had hallucinated the whole thing.

“It was just a hunch, am I wrong?” Itadori frowned.

Junpei robotically replied, “Ah, no, you’re right.”

“So? You don’t want someone you hate standing around your home, right?” Itadori said. He spoke those words with such straightforwardness that it stunned Junpei. Perhaps it was his eyes, or maybe his earnest face. But something about the teen seemed to tug at something inside Junpei’s chest. “Do you think we can chat now?”

“Yeah.” The word came out before Junpei could even fully register it. Strangely, he didn’t regret agreeing. He usually hated being approached by strangers, but this group of teens didn’t seem like bad guys. Junpei could only blankly follow them as they headed toward a nearby river. The three seemed to be fully in their own world. Were they not worried about Junpei running away?

The group joked around and traded words, but none were harsh or cruel. They seemed like really good friends. Something painful squeezed Junpei’s chest. Eventually, they reached the edge of the river. Junpei immediately took a seat while the three teens exchanged hushed words with each other. Despite their excited arm waves, he couldn’t hear what they were discussing.

In the end, it was the spiky-haired teen who started the conversation. His sharp black eyes landed on Junpei, and he couldn’t help but gulp.

“I don’t think we’ve introduced ourselves. My name is Fushiguro Megumi. The pink-haired one is Itadori Yuuji, and the girl is Kugisaki Nobara.”

Junpei replied, “Um, Yoshino Junpei. Nice to meet you.”

“Nice to meet you too!” Itadori excitedly replied. “Anyway! We’ve got some questions for you.” He pulled the small flying creature from before out of his pocket.

“You shoved it there?!” Kugisaki shouted, inching away from the boy.

“Where else can I put it?” Itadori asked.

“I don’t know, but not there!”

Fushiguro sighed deeply. Seeing that his friends were distracted, he took command of the conversation. He pointed his thumb at the monster in Itadori’s grasp. “Have you seen any creatures like this before back at the movie theater? Some people died there, and we believe the culprit is something similar.”

Mahito’s face flashed in Junpei’s mind. “No, I didn’t.” The lie came out easily. Although the teens didn’t seem hostile toward him, he couldn’t betray Mahito. “I only started seeing these things recently.”

“Oh, then I’ve got nothing else for you.” Itadori looked slightly disappointed but took a seat next to him.

“Man, this is a waste of time then.” Kugisaki sat beside Itadori.

“Well, it can’t be helped,” Fushiguro said, still standing. “Can you wait for a while? Our superior may want to meet you after this.”

“Sure,” Junpei said. He thought they would awkwardly wait now that the conversation had ended, but Itadori quickly changed the subject to movies. Junpei usually didn’t want to share his interests and hobbies with others, but the boy seemed to have a knack for getting what he wanted.

“Earthworm Man 3.” Junpei braced for ridicule. He knew it wasn’t a popular film that people would consider trendy to watch, and he had plenty of experience with how others would react to his preferences.

Surprisingly, it was Kugisaki who spoke up next. “Eh, that old movie.”

Itadori turned to his friend. “You’ve watched it?!”

Kugisaki shrugged. “Yeah, there was nothing to do in my bumfuck hometown, so I watched a lot of movies back then. I can’t have people look at me as if I’m uncultured, you know?”

“What about you, Fushiguro?” Itadori turned to his other friend.

Fushiguro’s lips curled downward. “Gojo-sensei forced me to watch it. It was horrible.”

“Yeah! It was so boring that I got punched so many times!” Itadori rubbed his jaw as if he could still feel the hits he had taken.

Punched? What had he been doing that made him get punched while watching movies? Junpei couldn’t understand how the conversation had gotten to this point. He had expected ridicule, but the teens didn’t even bat an eye at his response. It was strange. He had never met people like these. All these years, he had only ever encountered those who tormented or ignored him. Nobody had ever cared to listen to his interests. He didn’t have friends. So, he continued to stay in his own bubble. And yet… something akin to hope blossomed inside him. He said, “Well, it was a splatter film, so it’s not the kind of movie where you expect a decent story, but the second one—”

“The second one wasn’t actually bad!” Itadori interrupted.

Junpei turned toward the teen, eyes shining brightly. “Yeah! The second film has some redeeming qualities.” They somehow ended up discussing various films. Itadori had definitely watched the most movies out of the three, but Kugisaki and Fushiguro had their own share of opinions. Their discussion was interrupted when Junpei’s mother found them after returning from a shopping trip.

“Junpei?” his mother asked, a cigarette in her fingers. “Are these your friends?” Despite the smile, there was a hint of worry in her eyes. She knew Junpei wasn’t popular with other kids, and although he tried not to worry her, she could see how down and sad he often felt.

“We just met,” Junpei said.

“Yeah! But I think we’ll get along!” Itadori added. Junpei felt something squeeze his heart. Could Itadori stop being so earnest for a second?

After another round of introductions and Junpei scolding his mother for smoking, she offered to make them dinner. Junpei panicked and tried to disagree, but Itadori’s stomach protested like an angry tiger. Ultimately, his mother got her way, and they had three visitors inside their home.

It didn’t go horribly like he’d initially thought. In fact, it went too well. His mother seemed to be having the time of her life chatting with the teens. Itadori’s humor made him his mother’s favorite, but she also got along well with Kugisaki as they discussed cosmetics and fashion. This left Junpei and Fushiguro suffering silently as they watched the rest of the group have a great time as the night progressed.

Luckily, Junpei’s mother got tired and fell asleep at the table. He was covering her with a blanket when Itadori spoke, “Your mom is great.”

Junpei could only agree. His mother was the only source of support and stability in his life. If she disappeared, he wouldn’t know what to do with himself. “What’s your mother like?” Junpei asked.

“Hmm, I can’t remember them, but I had my grandpa, though.” Itadori smiled.

It was clear that the group would leave without questioning him further. Junpei could’ve kept his mouth shut, but he couldn’t help but ask, “You guys are sorcerers, right?"

The three teens stopped in their tracks, but they didn't look too surprised. All of them turned to Junpei, but Fushiguro’s eyes had narrowed slightly. Out of everyone in the group, he was definitely the sharpest.

Despite the hint of suspicion, Junpei still blurted out, "Have you killed anyone?”

It was a weird and heavy question. He wouldn’t be surprised if they became suspicious of him. He wanted to berate himself for his impulsiveness, but he needed to hear their answers. These were people who dealt with the worst sides of humanity. He wanted to know what they thought. Why did they keep fighting for the sake of the world when they had seen how rotten it truly was?

“No…” Itadori said, stunned. He clearly didn’t expect to hear such a question.

“Nope,” Kugisaki answered more quickly.

“I haven’t,” Fushiguro replied as well.

Itadori looked the most conflicted out of the three. Although they had only just met, Junpei knew the boy was the kindest and most soft-hearted of everyone in the group. He reminded Junpei of those protagonists in shonen mangas who always strive to help people. He couldn’t understand them. Why would they bother trying so much for strangers who wouldn’t do the same for them? They only got themselves needlessly hurt.

“What if you meet bad sorcerers? Will you kill them?” Junpei pushed.

“I still want to avoid killing them,” Itadori replied with a stubborn frown.

“Why? They’re bad people.” Junpei almost demanded. They were bad, so they deserved to be killed. Why couldn't Junpei erase those cruel classmates from this earth? He would do everyone a favor.

Itadori looked down pensively. It was clear he didn't agree with Junpei. “I know that I’ll eventually have to face that decision, but… I’m afraid if I start to kill, I’ll begin to lose the value of life and won’t understand the importance of those I care about.”

Junpei’s eyes widened. One could only arrive at that kind of answer if they had spent a lot of time pondering the topic. Despite Itadori’s cheer, the teen seemed to have his own troubles and burdens.

“Hah!” Kugisaki elbowed Itadori and broke him out of his reverie. “I never imagined this idiot could actually use his head to think about such heavy questions.”

“What does that mean?!” Itadori pouted.

Kugisaki continued, “Anyway, personally, I won’t hesitate. I’ll strike down any enemies that come my way, whether it’s to protect myself or those I care about. I don’t see the point in letting strangers influence my decisions and beliefs." Unlike Itadori's uncertainties and fears, Kugisaki answered with a confidence that was rooted in her personality. She seemed like someone who would keep moving forward no matter the cost. It was the type of faith in herself that Junpei could never muster.

"What about you, Fushiguro?” the girl asked.

The other boy, who had remained silent most of the night, finally spoke, “I think Itadori has a point. When one starts to kill without care, they will eventually lose sight of the value of life. However, I don’t think that should stop me from fighting for what I believe in. I still think it’s better to avoid killing unless it’s necessary, but if there comes a time when I have to kill someone…” Fushiguro’s eyes hardened. “I won’t hesitate.”

Three different people, three distinct answers. Although they had some disagreements, none of them showed any displeasure. Whatever bound the three teens together was stronger than the measly status of classmates.

“I see…” Junpei muttered.

Omake:

Sukuna: Nanamin! Nanamin! Nanamin!

Sukuna: Go Yuuji! Take the pants!

Sukuna: Aw, the kids are bonding together, how cute~

 

Kento: Gojo has multiplied himself, and I shudder to think of this world’s future. <(ㅍ _ㅍ)>

Itadori: New friend sighted! (∩˃o˂∩)♡

Nobara: Itadori sure is a charmer. (｡- .•)

Megumi: Something is off about this kid. (¬_¬")

Junpei: *Having a moral crisis* To kill or not to kill??? (๑﹏๑//)

Chapter Text

Yuuji and his friends finally left Yoshino’s house when the moon was high in the sky. The three of them were hanging out at a nearby café while they waited for the car to take them home. Ijichi had contacted them an hour ago; he had to send Nanami back to Jujutsu High so Ieri could patch him up. Unlike their investigation, the man had managed to confront the culprit inside the sewer. Unfortunately, the cursed spirit had managed to escape. The news caused some tension among the students, especially Yuuji. He didn’t want to imagine the horrible things that curse could do while roaming freely.

“Calm down, potato head,” Kugisaki said, sipping her icy beverage. “It’s not like we can do anything against a special-grade curse like that.”

“Yeah, it’s unlikely we’ll be allowed to pursue a curse with such high danger,” Fushiguro agreed. “Have you forgotten our previous mission?”

How could Yuuji forget? He still had dreams of his hand being chopped off like vegetables. He knew he was weak and that he needed to get stronger, yet he couldn’t stop the urge to chase after that curse. Although he could use cursed energy now, he was still unsure whether he could take down a special grade by himself. He didn’t want to ask for Sukuna’s help again. While the two of them had formed some sort of amicable relationship, he still tried to remember the warnings from Gojo and Fushiguro.

Yuuji could only sulk in silence as he sipped his hot chocolate. He couldn’t help but glance at Kugisaki’s icy drink and Fushiguro’s coffee. Wouldn’t they have trouble sleeping tonight if they drank caffeine right before bed? He shoved the idle thought away as he checked the time on his phone. Ijichi had promised them that they would be brought back to Jujutsu High in half an hour, so they still had some time to kill. Yuuji was about to ask them to visit a nearby bookstore when Sukuna suddenly spoke up.

“Brat, I sense one of my fingers nearby,” the curse said with a low voice from his manifested mouth.

Yuuji was about to slap the strange mouth and hide it from public view when the message finally registered in his mind.

“What?!” All three sorcerers froze when they heard the news. Their voices drew some attention from other patrons, but they didn’t try to interfere, since it didn’t seem like trouble was about to start.

Sukuna continued, “I wasn’t quite sure for a while since it’s one of the fingers that likes to keep to itself. However, it suddenly flared my signature just now.”

“Oh man, don’t tell me we have to fight another special grade so soon?!” Kugisaki pinched the bridge of her nose.

“Luckily for you, no,” Sukuna replied. “I don’t believe it’s been claimed by a cursed spirit. The bad news is that it somehow showed up in a familiar location.”

“Where?” Fushiguro demanded, looking ready to leap out of his seat and run straight to the danger.

“It’s near the brat with the weird bangs. Ah yes, I believe his name is Yoshino?”

Yuuji felt as if someone had poured ice directly into his veins. His eyes widened. No.

Junpei was half-asleep on his bed as he tossed and turned in an attempt to sleep. The recent events and conversations refused to leave his mind. From Mahito’s declaration to the sorcerer’s statements, the two parties were on opposite sides. One refused to acknowledge the existence of life’s meaning, while the other supported the value of life.

Junpei…

Junpei couldn’t be sure.

On the one hand, he still wanted to erase those cruel classmates. He wanted to make them feel his pain. His suffering. He wanted them to beg and cry. His rage and resentment urged him to plunge into that darkness and drown himself in it.

On the other hand, a part of him still wished to avoid such a thing. Did it make him weak? To still hesitate over taking down his enemies?

Mahito’s voice whispered to him, “I support everything you represent, Junpei.”

“I’m afraid if I start to kill, I’ll begin to lose the value of life and won’t understand the importance of those I care about,” Yuuji’s voice replied.

Junpei rubbed his eyes harshly. He didn’t know what to do. With his newfound power, he could easily retaliate against those people without being found out. Yet, he knew that there would be no coming back once he started.

He just wanted…

This time, Fushiguro’s voice rang in his head: "When one starts to kill without care, they will eventually lose sight of the value of life.”

To kill without care. Where does one draw the line on whether or not taking a life is acceptable? Protecting himself against those who wanted to kill him was easy to answer. But those bullies didn’t truly want to kill Junpei; they just wanted to make his life hell. Was that enough reason to kill them?

“I don’t see the point of letting strangers influence my decisions and beliefs,” Kugisaki’s voice echoed.

Strangers, huh… Considering Junpei had just met all of them, wasn’t he being influenced by strangers right now? He had never felt like this. Usually, it was very easy for him to keep his distance. He had lived like this for many years, after all. Yet, Mahito and the sorcerers somehow managed to break through his walls and get into his heart within a day. What did that say about him?

Before Junpei could continue his internal struggle, a loud noise suddenly came from outside.

CRACK! BANG!

“JUNPEI!” Itadori shouted, full of fear.

Junpei got up from his bed and quickly rushed outside. A wild scene greeted him. A monster towered over his mother, but a massive dog with dark fur was biting it. Fushiguro quickly took a stance beside the woman, who still looked half-asleep and confused.

Kugisaki shot a nail filled with cursed energy at the creature. It landed squarely on its forehead. A second later, its head exploded. Itadori was making his way toward him. His eyes were wild and intense, and Junpei could only stare at them.

“Are you okay?!” Itadori grabbed his shoulder tightly.

“What?” Junpei could only croak out.

Kugisaki had moved to comfort his mother while Fushiguro turned to pick up something from the ground. Junpei couldn’t see it clearly, but he believed it was a finger. What the hell?

“Junpei!” Itadori called again.

Junpei snapped out of his surprise. “Y-yeah?”

“I don’t believe there are any more curses here,” Fushiguro said. He was now holding out the item to the other boy. Junpei’s eyes widened when he saw that it was indeed a finger. It looked very old and withered. Despite being a dead object, he couldn’t help but feel uneasy being near it. “Itadori, I would prefer to give this to Gojo-sensei, but I think you should eat it now so it won’t attract more cursed spirits.”

“Sure.” Itadori nodded. Without hesitation, the boy took the finger from his friend and swallowed it.

Junpei gaped.

Did he just eat the finger?!

“W-wait?! Isn’t that unsanitary?!” Junpei asked.

“No worries,” Kugisaki said after herding his mother to the sofa. Somehow, she had gotten back to sleep and was now snoring lightly. “That’s what the potato head is supposed to do.”

Black markings began showing up on Itadori’s skin. They covered his face and went down to his neck and chest. Perhaps they even covered his whole body. Itadori stiffened for a second when a wave of power exploded from him. Junpei almost fell, but Fushiguro caught his arm. A second later, all the tattoos disappeared again as if they had never existed in the first place.

Itadori sighed and opened his eyes. He stuck out his tongue and began to make gagging noises. “Yuck, it still tastes horrible.”

“What do you expect from mummified fingers, idiot?” Kugisaki snorted.

Junpei still couldn’t understand what exactly had just occurred. “What’s going on?”

Itadori winced. “Um, well, it’s a bit complicated.”

Fushiguro sighed. “We noticed a cursed object suddenly showing up at your house. Luckily, we were still nearby, so we returned here to retrieve it. There was only one cursed spirit that showed up to claim it. Although it was very weak, your mother wouldn't have been able to defend herself.”

“Cursed object?” Junpei blinked. Even from the name, he knew the item was terrible news.

“It’s the finger,” Kugisaki said. “It’s a pretty powerful one too.”

“I’m not sure how it suddenly appeared at your house,” Fushiguro continued. “Sukuna’s Finger cannot move by itself. For one to show up at this location… it can only mean that someone is actively targeting you. Although the cursed object won’t cause harm, without the proper seals, it will attract numerous cursed spirits to the area.”

“Target? Are you saying someone wants to kill me and my mother?” Junpei couldn't believe what he was hearing. How could someone do such a horrible thing to them? Had they done something wrong?

“We can’t be sure about the true culprit without performing an investigation,” Fushiguro replied. “Sukuna’s Finger is very rare and powerful. No one would use it to target normal humans like you when there are less expensive and dangerous methods.”

The only ones Junpei could think of targeting him were the bullies at school. They hated him. They loathed him. Could they… Could it be? Shota Ito? The disgusting face of his classmate flashed in his mind.

“Is it…” Junpei’s mouth trembled. “I-I have some enemies at school… Could it be them?”

“Enemies?” Itadori frowned. “Are you being bullied, Junpei?”

Junpei shook his head. That wasn’t important. “I guess, yeah, but tell me, could it be them?”

Fushiguro frowned in deep thought. “Unlikely. Even if they’re somehow connected to sorcerer families or curse users, no one in their right mind would consider losing Sukuna’s Finger to random curses for this type of thing. As far as everyone knows, you and your mother are mundane humans. Like I said, there are better methods they can use to hurt you.”

“Then why did that thing show up here?!” Junpei demanded. If it wasn’t them, then who was it?! Who dared to try to hurt his mother?!

“We don’t know,” Fushiguro replied.

“Hey, does it have to be humans, though?” Kugisaki suddenly spoke up. The other teens turned to her. She had taken a seat at the table and was resting her chin on her palm. “I mean, didn’t Gojo-sensei say the special grades are being weird right now? There’s also that thing at the movie theater. Doesn’t it make more sense that it wants to remove Junpei after witnessing the crime? I mean, it’s still strange that the cursed spirit would use something like Sukuna’s Finger, but curses always have an odd thought process.”

“Special grade?” Junpei asked. He had heard that word before.

“Ah, it’s a rank that sorcerers give to curses,” Itadori explained. Despite the tension, he looked quite proud of being able to tell Junpei about Jujutsu facts. “I think it’s only for powerful cursed spirits that may need cluster bombs to be killed?”

“Any intelligent curses that can talk and cooperate can also be considered a special grade,” Fushiguro added.

“Honestly, the grading system is really unreliable,” Kugisaki said.

Junpei’s eyes widened. There was one curse that he met that fit those criteria. Although he hadn’t seen Mahito fight, he knew the cursed spirit was strong. Could it be him who tried to hurt Junpei and his mother? But why? Weren’t they friends? Didn't the curse just help him? Why did he suddenly change?

“What’s wrong, Junpei?” Itadori frowned when he noticed the other boy was trembling.

Junpei couldn’t speak. The betrayal was stabbing his heart. He had trouble breathing. Mahito. Mahito. Did he truly try to kill Junpei and his mother? He needed to speak with him. He needed to hear it straight from the curse. Junpei closed his eyes as tears began to brim in his eyelids.

“I think you should put him back to bed, Itadori,” Fushiguro said. “The recent murder attempt may have shaken him.”

“Okay.” Itadori began to herd Junpei back to his room, but the teen refused to budge.

“My mother…” Junpei croaked out. He couldn’t leave her. What if another monster showed up? He had almost lost her just now. He couldn’t take the risk.

“Don’t worry,” Kugisaki replied, twirling her hammer like a pen. “I’ll keep an eye on her. No curses will get anywhere near while I’m here.”

Itadori grasped Junpei’s shoulder. “Come on, Junpei. We’ll take care of things here. You can just rest.”

Fushiguro nodded. “I’ll call our supervisors and inform them about what happened. They’ll assign guards to your house while we investigate.”

With those assurances, Junpei let himself be taken back to his room by Itadori. He didn’t know what to think. Everything was spiraling out of control.

Mahito was observing the situation at Yoshino’s house from a decent distance. He had planned to swoop in like a hero and save Junpei in his darkest hour. Yet, other heroes had somehow shown up and ruined his plan. Not only that, but he had also lost Sukuna’s Finger that Geto had lent him. The man had to be angry if he heard that Mahito had lost such an important item while failing his mission. Hmm. That wouldn’t do.

Mahito began turning his mind over as he tried to come up with a new scheme. Oh well. His initial plan to pit Junpei against Yuuji wouldn’t work now. But he could still use the boy to draw out Sukuna. They seemed to care about each other a lot, so using the kid as bait would work wonders.

Hehehe.

Mahito couldn’t wait.

True to Fushiguro’s words, the sorcerers sent some men to investigate and question them. This forced Junpei to confess to his mother about being able to see curses. However, he still kept his mouth shut about Mahito. He wanted to talk to the curse at least once. Unfortunately, the sorcerers didn’t seem able to find anything more substantial. Whoever had placed the finger at his house didn't stay for long, so they couldn't find significant residuals that could lead them to the culprit. They could only confirm that the perpetrator had been the same one who killed the students at the movie theater.

In the end, Junpei could only return to his school life with a heavy heart. He wanted to search for Mahito, but he heard from Itadori that they were planning to explore the sewers where they believed the special grade was hiding. Junpei couldn’t afford to be caught by the sorcerers, so he could only wait for a chance to sneak away.

Junpei noticed the excited atmosphere among some students at his school. Ah, he remembered there was supposed to be an announcement about the national essay contest. Not that he cared. That stupid Shota would probably win. He had heard how the other boy had threatened a student with a bright mind to write his essay for him. Piece of shit.

Junpei kept his head down as he half-listened to the headmaster at the podium. He didn’t want anyone to bother him while he tried to figure out what to do next. Suddenly, a strange feeling sparked in the air. He automatically looked up to see the bright blue sky covered by a strange dark film. What was that?

Ignoring the other students and teachers, Junpei ran out of his proper spot to exit the sports hall. Whatever it was, it was definitely related to the Jujutsu world. He needed to contact Itadori and the others. Junpei looked for a safe hiding spot while he turned on his phone. He was about to contact the boy when suddenly a voice called him.

“Yo, Junpei,” Mahito drawled lazily. Junpei whipped his head around and saw the curse that had suddenly appeared inside his school. He had an easy grin on his face. “It’s been a while.”

“Mahito, you—shouldn’t you be underground?” Junpei asked.

Mahito shrugged. “Oh, should I? Anyway, I’ve got tons of creations to deal with annoying sorcerers down there, so I figured it's time to have a chat with my friend.”

“Friend?” Junpei clenched his teeth. “Did that word mean anything to you when you placed that finger near my mother?!”

“Why should I care? After all… life has no meaning.” Mahito grinned like a madman.

Junpei finally snapped and summoned his shikigami. He sent out the tentacle and tried to take down the curse before him. Although this power was a gift from the curse, he would use it to snuff out the life from the creature's eyes. Mahito easily dodged the attacks and tackled him to the ground. Junpei yelped and tried to push the man away. The curse grasped his cheek and laughed at his struggle. Was he going to die? Was Mahito going to transform him into one of those twisted creatures? Junpei felt tears pouring out of him.

“Junpei, Junpei. I had a plan, you know. You’re supposed to fight Yuuji, but here you are, being friends with him. Oh well, you still have use, so I’ll let you stay alive for now.” Mahito took his phone and pressed the call button. “Come on, I’ll give you a chance.”

The call was picked up.

“Yuuji, help—!” Junpei called out before the connection was promptly ended.

Yuuji could only stare blankly at his phone. Junpei’s call for help echoed in his ears. “I’m going.” He began heading toward the exit when Ijichi blocked his path. He gazed at the man. “Please move, Ijichi-san.”

The man didn’t falter, even under Yuuji’s cold gaze. “You can’t go, Itadori. The curse is clearly aiming to get you. I can’t let you run straight into danger like that.”

Yuuji understood. Really. The adults in his life only wanted to protect him. They didn’t want him to take unnecessary risks. He was their student, after all. However, he also couldn’t close his eyes and ears after hearing someone ask him for help. He had to go. He steeled his resolve.

“No need to get so worried, Ijichi-san,” Kugisaki suddenly said, standing beside Yuuji. “Potato head won’t be going in alone after all.”

Fushiguro stood on Yuuji’s other side. “We’re going to back him up.”

Unfortunately, their words didn’t seem to comfort Ijichi; they only stressed him further. The man let out a small whine before saying, “If you do this, Gojo-san will have my head.”

“Don’t worry; we’ll take full responsibility,” Kugisaki grinned.

Yuuji looked at his two friends and nodded. Together, they sprinted past Ijichi and headed toward Satozakura High. Ijichi let out a wail of despair behind them, “I’ll call Nanami-san!!”

Good. They were going to need backup.

Luckily, they were in a nearby area, so they reached Satozakura High within ten minutes. Regular people wouldn't be able to sprint as fast as they did, but they had learned to use cursed energy to temporarily enhance their bodies. The curtain covering the building could be seen from afar before they even reached the entrance. When the three of them went inside, they found the school absolutely silent.

“Are they—?!” Yuuji asked.

“I’m feeling signatures from the sports building,” Fushiguro said.

They dashed toward their destination and found all the students lying on the ground. Fortunately, it seemed that they weren’t dead, merely passed out. Their attention was quickly drawn to the figures on the platform. It was Junpei, gagged with a piece of cloth and held down by several transfigured humans.

“Divine Dog!” Fushiguro sent his shikigami to deal with the creatures. Kugisaki threw her nails at the rest while Yuuji dashed toward Junpei. When he removed the cloth covering the boy’s mouth, Junpei began to say, “No! Yuuji, it’s a trap—!”

At that point, something suddenly fell on top of him. Yuuji tried to knock the thing off, but chains suddenly wrapped around him tightly. From the corner of his eye, he could see more transfigured humans emerging to overwhelm Fushiguro and Kugisaki. Another monster also took Junpei hostage once again.

Yuuji struggled and finally managed to look at the enemy. It was a human-like curse, grinning at him. Ah. Wasn’t this the patchwork curse that Nanami had encountered?

“You’re really predictable. Although I want to say ‘nice to meet you,’ it’s time to let Sukuna out.” The curse placed its hand on Yuuji’s head, and he felt it activate its cursed technique.

“YUUJI!” Junpei screamed in terror.

“NO!” Fushiguro and Kugisaki shouted at the same time.

Yuuji felt something reaching deep into his soul. However, instead of attacking him, it went straight to the other being inside his body, Sukuna.

Although he was still staring at the curse, Yuuji could somehow see a version of himself sitting on a throne made of bones. He was wearing a kimono, and tattoos covered his skin. The man lounged on his seat, resting his head on his hand. Four red eyes shone in the dark.

“Fool. You dare to touch my soul. Know your place.”

The pressure the King of Curses exuded immediately scared the curse, causing it to pull back. Yuuji seized the chance to kick the enemy off him and got back to his feet. The cursed spirit looked slightly shaken after encountering Sukuna but managed to regain its composure quickly.

“Hahaha! No wonder he’s called the King of Curses,” the curse grinned. “This will be fun.”

“Mahito! Stay away from Yuuji!” Junpei finally defeated the monster holding him down and sent a shikigami jellyfish at the cursed spirit.

Mahito easily evaded the tentacles and changed his arm into a long blade, striking the shikigami with a swing.

“Fuck!” Junpei cursed.

Yuuji quickly moved to Junpei's side and glanced at his other friends. They were still fighting other monsters but didn’t seem to be having much trouble.

“Is that your cursed technique?” Yuuji asked.

“Yeah, but it’s pretty useless,” Junpei grumbled. His shikigami didn’t disappear despite receiving a solid hit from Mahito. It seemed quite sturdy despite its lack of firepower.

“Didn’t you just become a sorcerer? No need to worry. You’ll get the hang of it,” Yuuji grinned and reassured Junpei.

“That’s not important!” Junpei protested, his cheeks slightly reddened. “Mahito can transform humans with one touch. How did you survive?!”

Yuuji was about to reply, but the curse interrupted them.

“How touching,” Mahito sneered. “But don’t you think you should pay attention to your enemy?” His arm shifted from blades to some sort of drill, which he shot toward them.

Yuuji grabbed Junpei’s uniform and dragged him out of the way. It was difficult to dodge the strikes while holding someone, but Yuuji managed to get them to safety. Fushiguro and Kugisaki joined them once they dealt with the monsters holding them back. Knowing that fighting inside a room full of unconscious humans was unwise, they left the building to draw the fight elsewhere.

“How did you not get turned into a monster, potato head?!” Kugisaki asked as they ran.

“Uh, I think it’s thanks to Sukuna?” Yuuji said. “He really didn’t like that guy touching his soul, so he pushed back.”

As expected, Fushiguro didn’t look happy hearing about the King of Curses’ involvement. Yuuji thought he would berate him again for not staying away from the curse, but he only stiffly said, “It seems that only you’re safe from the special grade's technique. So the three of us will support you from behind while you focus on being offensive.”

“Roger that!” Yuuji grinned and gave him a thumbs-up.

They managed to reach an open field when Mahito finally caught up. Although it was four against one, the special grade lived up to its rank by keeping pace with them. Fushiguro and Junpei ordered their shikigami to attack, while Kugisaki used her nails to distract it. Yuuji immediately engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the curse, but its ability to shapeshift made it hard to land a blow consistently. He also needed to keep the enemy away from his friends, or they would get hurt.

The fight was about exploiting openings, but unfortunately, the sorcerers made the first mistake. Junpei was already tired from the prolonged battle and had started lagging behind. The boy failed to keep his distance from the curse, and it seized the opportunity to place a hand on him.

“JUNPEI!” Yuuji screamed as Mahito used its power to transform his friend.

The boy no longer looked human. He had become something more like a strange toy. His head had elongated, and although his hair remained, his body had grown so large that his features had distorted. Big, beady eyes stared blankly ahead.

NO. NO. NO. NO. NO.

“Time for a second round.” Mahito grinned as he ordered the now-transfigured Junpei to attack Yuuji. The boy followed the instructions and rammed his head straight into Yuuji’s chest, but Yuuji didn’t dare to hit his friend.

“Y-y-yuuuu-jiiii…” the boy weakly said.

The sound broke Yuuji's heart.

While Yuuji was distracted by Junpei, Fushiguro and Kugisaki covered them.

“YOU PIECE OF SHIT!” Kugisaki shouted. Instead of using her nails, she pulled out three long needles from her pouch. “I was about to save these for the exchange, but you’re going to be my first test subject!”

Fushiguro didn’t say anything, but his gaze grew heavier. He summoned several of his shikigami to attack the curse.

Yuuji couldn’t pay attention to his friends because he was focused on trying to stop Junpei from attacking. “Junpei! Snap out of it!” The boy could only make unintelligible noises, but it was clear he was in pain.

Mahito was cackling like a madman. The special grade didn't bother to fight back and only danced away from the sorcerers' attacks, relishing Yuuji's suffering. “He’s gone! He’s no longer human! My technique can change the shape of a soul. Not even your Reverse Cursed Technique can heal that!”

NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO.

Yuuji grabbed hold of Junpei and forced the teen to stop moving. Once again, he was powerless. He couldn’t do anything. He failed. He was weak. Weak. Weak. Weak. There was nothing he could do but...

“Sukuna…” Yuuji whispered. “SUKUNA!” He felt the King of Curses’ presence pressing closely to his soul. “I’ll do anything! So! Just like before! Please save Junpei!”

“Didn’t I say-?” Mahito tried to interrupt, still laughing.

“Sure,” Sukuna said.

Despite being in the middle of a fight, all participants stopped when they heard the King of Curses’ voice. All eyes widened as they looked at Yuuji, still holding Junpei down. Even the transformed boy could feel the demon's presence inside the other teen and halted his struggle. The world held its breath.

“Let’s make another Binding Vow. Take care of that eyesore of a curse named Mahito, and I’ll heal the brat.” Sukuna grinned. “Do we have a deal?”

“We have a deal.”

The sound of chains echoed once more deep within Yuuji’s soul.

Omake:

Sukuna: Oh shit fuck! Mahitoooo! I’m gonna get you!

Sukuna: *Notices Junpei is okay* Great, the kid is still alive.

Sukuna: *Feels Mahito reaching toward him* Shit fuck gotta get into position! *Successfully sits like a king* Fuck you, don’t touch me!

Sukuna: *Realizes Mahito is fine* Wait, how did OGkuna hurt him from here??

Sukuna: *Sees Junpei being transformed* I’m gonna kill you Mahitoooo!

Sukuna: Fuck! Junpei! I think I can heal him?! Right! I can do this. Shit. I gotta do it while still staying in character. Fucking hell.

 

Yuuji: *Locked in* I’m going to kill you, Mahito.

Nobara: Fuck. This is almost worse than the detention center.

Megumi: Another Binding Vow?! Damn it, Itadori!
Notes:

    It's still going to be a fix-it, but I'm not gonna make it easy for them. ৻( •̀ ᗜ •́ ৻)
    Also google doc kept changing Mahito to Mojito. So if you find that word in the fic, it's not my fault.

Chapter 10
Chapter Text

Yuuji was about to launch toward Mahito when he felt Sukuna’s cursed energy leeching out of his hand. It spread from his chest and exited through his hands, which were still holding Junpei. The energy entered the transformed boy, and Yuuji felt the teen relax under his hold. Junpei was no longer whimpering in pain and was somehow asleep.

What?

“That should keep the brat stable for a while,” Sukuna said. “Don’t take too long, though. I’m not sure how long he can stay alive in that form.”

When the King of Curses finally returned to the depths of his soul, Yuuji sent a quick thank you to the curse and threw himself at Mahito. He had a deal, and now he just needed to fulfill it. Despite not approving of his decision to make another Binding Vow, Fushiguro and Kugisaki backed up Yuuji as he entered a brutal fight against the cursed spirit.

Yuuji finally landed a solid punch on Mahito’s face, sending him back several feet. Although Mahito landed safely on his feet, Yuuji could see blood dribbling out of his nose. Except for Yuuji, everyone was surprised to see that the curse actually got hurt. Previously, although Yuuji could land various blows on the curse, they always failed to hurt Mahito in any significant way. However, he wasn’t sure whether it was because he was pissed off beyond belief or what, but he could finally pummel that disgustingly smug grin into the ground.

Despite the blood coating its face, the cursed spirit laughed. “I see! So you can see the outline of your own soul!”

Yuuji only answered. “I’ll kill you.”

Fushiguro and Kugisaki flinched at the frigid tone that came from their friend. Yuuji always tried to be positive and kept a smile on his face. But after seeing what Mahito had done to Junpei, he couldn’t let this thing continue to exist. He would kill it. He would destroy it. He would hunt it down.

Yuuji screamed as he began to rain down blow after blow. Most of them failed to land and only hit the ground, which broke into pieces. Mahito changed his arm into wings to help him dodge. Fushiguro’s Nue slammed into the curse from behind, preventing it from running. Yuuji jumped and landed another solid hit on the curse’s stomach.

It didn’t stop the curse, though. Mahito altered his right arm into several long blades. Yuuji was forced to move back to avoid getting cut. One of the blades almost hit him, but Kugisaki sent a long needle to strike at the arm. It curved and flew like a bird.

BAM!

Kugisaki's hairpin exploded and staggered Mahito. Yuuji got close again and landed another hard hit on the special grade’s head. It sent the curse into a nearby building, but the resulting smoke merely gave it cover to send a drill flying toward Yuuji.

Yuuji didn’t hesitate to grab the black thread that still connected it to the main body. Mahito stabbed Yuuji’s hand with thorns, but the boy refused to release it. With a heave, he threw the curse into the air and slammed it into the ground. Fushiguro sent Nue to keep it down while Kugisaki controlled her three needles so they pierced the enemy.

Nue pulled back, and Yuuji leaped toward the fallen curse and tried to stomp its head. Somehow, he only hit the ground. He froze for a second and then realized that the cursed spirit was behind him. It had changed its hand into something akin to a morning star. Before it could hit Yuuji, Nanami showed up to block the attack.

“Nanami!” All the students shouted in joy and relief.

When Kento heard that the three first-year students had decided to go to Satozakura High and face the special grade, he felt the beginning of an aneurysm. Unfortunately, duty called, and Kento couldn’t let himself die before he was sure the kids were safe. So, he entrusted the mission in the sewer to Ino Takuma and immediately ran toward the school.

Somehow, all the students seemed to be mostly fine. Kento’s eyes narrowed as he noticed another transformed human with familiar-looking hair sleeping not far from the fight. “I’ll scold you all later. What’s the situation?” Kento asked.

“I can’t save Junpei,” Yuuji said with a tone filled with regret. “...but Sukuna said he would help as long as we take care of the curse, so-!”

Kento felt as if he were short-circuiting. Did he just hear the name of the King of Curses and the word "help" together in a sentence? The stress must’ve finally gotten to him.

“You’re looking good, 7:3 sorcerer,” the curse happily said. Despite seeing another sorcerer joining the fight, the special grade didn’t look worried. Was it confidence or arrogance? Then, he finally noticed the blood on the curse’s face.

“Itadori, why is his nose bleeding?” Kento asked. He had fought this curse before, and none of his attacks had managed to actually wound the special grade. Yet now he finally saw the creature bleeding and hurting.

“I punched him,” the boy replied unhelpfully.

“Nanami-san, Itadori can’t get hurt by the special grade’s cursed technique because of Sukuna!” Fushiguro quickly added, still keeping his distance. “His status as a vessel also helped him notice the shape of the curse’s soul, which lets him hurt the enemy.”

Bless Fushiguro. The kid had a good head on his shoulders. “I see. Then, let’s exorcise this curse right now. Itadori, you will lead the attack, and we will help you create openings.”

With a first-grade sorcerer joining the fight, the tide of battle shifted in their favor. Mahito tried to use various unique attacks that made it hard to get close. The curse even tried to use transfigured humans to deal with Itadori, but the kid only hesitated briefly before taking them down. Kento saved that revelation for later and focused on cornering the special grade.

Despite the curse’s best attempts, it was no match against four sorcerers. Fushiguro and Kugisaki easily covered the ranged attacks, while Kento and Itadori continued to stay close for melee combat. Eventually, they managed to land a combo that seemed to end the fight.

Yet, right when they were about to claim their victory...

Mahito opened his mouth to show four small hands, creating a gesture.

“Domain Expansion: Self-Embodiment of Expression.”

When the domain expanded, it swallowed only Kento, not Yuuji, who was next to him. Ah. It seemed the curse was capable of excluding its only source of danger. Despite knowing he was in death’s grasp, Kento didn’t feel any fear. In fact, he was quite content. The students were safe, and he could only hope they used this chance to run away and call for more backups, preferably Gojo.

Kento had always known that sorcerers would die in battles. At least, if it were like this, he wouldn’t drag those kids into his mess. His mind replayed his past and decisions. Leaving the mundane life of a salaryman had been equal to signing his death certificate. Yet, he had never felt more alive than when he had contacted Gojo after helping that bakery employee.

The topic of life’s purpose had always seemed so grand and nebulous for Kento’s taste. Such big words were meant for those with special fates like Gojo. Those were the people who could change the world with their own hands. Someone as untalented and unambitious as Kento could never understand those things. Yet, when he heard ‘thank you’ from the bakery employee and saw that the students under his care were safe, Kento thought that he could understand, somewhat.

“Right now, I feel grateful to you,” the special grade said with a wide smile, clearly satisfied that their battle had somehow allowed it to manifest a domain.

“Keep your gratitude.” Kento took off his glasses. “I’ve received plenty of it already. I have no regrets.”

CRACK!

At that moment, Itadori somehow broke into the domain like a fallen angel. The boundary of the domain shattered like shards of glass, and the light from outside outlined his figure as he leaped inside. The kid’s eyes locked onto the enemy, uncaring of the danger he had just put himself in. Kento’s eyes widened. No. Although unintentional, the special grade had just committed a taboo, one that it would pay dearly for.

“I thought I told you not to touch my soul,” a deep voice echoed within the domain. It was dark and held innumerable dangers. While Kento never believed in the existence of a grim reaper, he felt as though he was standing near one right now. “Know your place, trash.”

As if cut with sharp blades, two gashes suddenly appeared on Mahito’s body. The curse fell to its knees as the domain shattered into pieces. All the sorcerers looked stunned at the sudden event, but not even a second later, Itadori sprinted toward the special grade.

Despite being heavily wounded and exhausted, Mahito enlarged its body as if it were a balloon. Itadori halted in confusion but quickly channeled his cursed energy into his fist. This was it.

DIVERGENT FIST!

BAM!!!

Yet, instead of exorcising the curse, it merely popped like a balloon. Kento quickly noticed a fleeing creature and tried to strike it down. Unfortunately, the curse managed to enter the drainage system. When he saw his strike only hitting the grate, Kento pulled out his phone to contact Ino. He was about to order Itadori to continue pursuing the special grade, but the kid fell to the ground.

“Itadori!” Kento and the other students rushed toward the fallen boy. He looked absolutely bone-tired. Despite fighting to stay awake, his eyes slowly closed as he descended into unconsciousness. It seemed the fight had taken too much out of him. Kento was about to tell the other kids to take their friend when they felt a shift in the air. Tattoos began to appear on Itadori’s skin, and the aura surrounding the boy changed. The warmth of summer shifted into sharp, burning hellfire.

Kento grabbed the two first-years and placed them behind him. He raised his weapon even as sweat began to cover his palm. Slowly, the boy, no, the curse, got to his feet and locked four red orbs onto them, King of Curses.

“We meet again, little sorcerers,” Sukuna said with a smirk as he slicked back Itadori’s hair.

“Sukuna!” Fushiguro gritted out.

Despite having the same body and appearance, the King of Curses somehow managed to make the young boy look like a man. Perhaps it was his oppressive aura. Or it might be because of his deep gaze that seemed to peer into their souls. Either way, Kento couldn’t let the curse hurt the students. The man wondered how he should deal with this extremely difficult situation. Frankly, he would rather go another round of fights with Mahito without Itadori’s help than face the King of Curses. Yet, when had he ever had the pleasure of picking his fights? Trouble always seemed to follow him.

“Why did you get out, four-eyes?” Kugisaki said with bluster. She was also sweating and breathing heavily, but not because of fatigue.

Kento felt like he was going to have a heart attack. His assumptions were correct. Gojo’s students were Gojo’s through and through. Hell or high water, they would disrespect anyone before them. Damn the consequences.

Kento prepared for Sukuna to attack, but the King of Curses merely chuckled. “Did you forget about the deal?”

Fushiguro and Kugisaki’s eyes sparked with understanding, while Kento remained confused. Then, he remembered Itadori’s strange sentence.

“You’re actually going to help Yoshino?” Fushiguro narrowed his eyes. He clearly didn’t trust Sukuna despite his apparent friendliness. Again, the kid had a good head on his shoulders.

“I made a deal, so I shall fulfill it,” Sukuna replied.

“But didn’t Itadori fail to kill that curse?” Kugisaki asked.

Sukuna grinned. “That’s where you’re wrong, brat number three.” Kugisaki looked like she wanted to throw a nail at the curse for the nickname. Luckily, she had more sense and refrained. Kento let out a small sigh. Small mercies. “I told brat number one to take care of the curse, and as far as I’m concerned, he has completed that part of his deal.” The King of Curses turned around and approached the sleeping Yoshino on the ground. He didn’t seem to care that he was showing his back to three sorcerers who were highly hostile toward him. Not that he should be worried. Based on old tales and records, that curse could slice them like sashimi within a second.

“That’s awfully generous of you,” Fushiguro said. Red eyes flicked back to look at the boy, but the kid merely glared in return. Oh no. Fushiguro had inherited Gojo’s stubbornness. Kento should’ve known better. He wanted to cover his eyes, but his instincts prevented him from that reprieve.

“Do you not want me to heal the brat?” Sukuna pointed at the transfigured human.

The teens pursed their lips. Besides not wanting to upset Itadori, the two students seemed to care about their new friend. Kento really didn’t wish to know how the kids would react if the boy still died after this encounter.

Kento finally decided to speak up. “As far as I know, the special grade’s technique is to change the shape of a soul. I don’t believe using the Reverse Curse Technique will work in this case.”

Sukuna finally locked his eyes on him, and Kento had to stop himself from flinching. The weight of the King of Curses’ gaze was not something everyone could bear. Although he felt no malice from the curse, he still couldn't help but feel threatened.

“Who said I’m merely going to use that?” Sukuna answered. The curse didn’t deem them worthy of an explanation and instead turned to crouch down beside the sleeping Yoshino. The King of Curses placed his hands on the transfigured human and began channeling his cursed energy.

While Kento had never felt jealous of Gojo’s Six Eyes, he couldn't help but wish he had that sight now so he could see what Sukuna was doing. The curse was obviously using his cursed energy, but that wasn’t the only thing he was doing. His power covered Yoshino, and like molding clay, the transfigured shape of the boy slowly returned to his original form. It took only several seconds before the miracle was completed.

Yoshino was back and continued sleeping peacefully on the ground. Seeing the boy naked, Kento automatically removed his jacket to cover him. Sukuna didn’t seem bothered by his approach and merely gazed down at the teen.

After a moment, Sukuna stood up from his spot. The three humans warily watched the King of Curses. Sukuna smirked, “Why so tense?”

“I’m sorry that we’re worried you’re going to go on a rampage,” Kugisaki somehow still found the courage to show disrespect. “Can’t let you cause trouble for potato head, you know.” Her eyes sparked. “Hey, do you see these?” The girl raised the three long needles, which Kento assumed were special-grade cursed weapons. “I finally got what you asked. Do you want to taste it? Maybe I can hit you in the eyes now.” There was a manic grin on her face. “I won’t hurt Itadori’s eyes, but maybe I can take out one of your secondary eyes. Not like you need four of them.”

Kento was internally on his knees, praying to whatever god actually existed in this world, Amaterasu, Jesus, Zeus, or whatever it was. Could someone please grant these kids some shred of sanity? If they could fulfill his wish, he would become their most devoted follower.

While Kento understood the importance of not showing weakness to enemies, what they were doing right now was simply tickling the dragon’s tail. Although he disagreed with corporal punishment, he was really tempted to whack the girl over the head for her words.

Luckily, the King of Curses didn’t take offense to Kugisaki’s taunt but merely smirked. “Are you eager for another round of trashing?”

All three sorcerers tensed as they waited for the curse to attack them. They were locked in an intense staring contest for several seconds. Then, the King of Curses barked out a laugh. “Luckily for you, I’ve no desire to play around with weaklings. Maybe try again when you can actually offer me some challenges. I see that you’ve yet to master that new weapon of yours.” Sukuna raised his hand and gave them a wave. “See you later then.” With those parting words, the curse closed his eyes and relinquished his control.

The tattoos covering Itadori’s body vanished, and the boy began to fall. Kento quickly caught him and gently lowered him to the ground. He gave a quick examination and found that the boy was in a deep slumber. In fact, it seemed Sukuna had also healed the teen’s body while he was in control. The three remaining sorcerers exchanged glances with each other, unsure of what they had just witnessed.

When Satoru got the news that his students had somehow encountered another special grade during their mission with Nanami, he was one step away from breaking into the elders’ chamber with Hollow Purple in hand. Did his words mean nothing to those geezers? Were they truly brain-dead? Well, then he should complete the process and make them fully dead. However, when he registered Ijichi’s explanation, he realized that the higher-ups had nothing to do with this mess. It was actually the fault of the other trouble group that had just made itself known to him. How unfortunate. He was ready to cleanse this world of some filth, but it seemed those bags of bones could continue to waste Earth’s oxygen.

In a rather bad mood, Satoru entered the infirmary at Jujutsu High. There, he found Nanami, Ijichi, Shoko, all three first-years, and the unlucky boy who got dragged into the chaos. Except for Yuuji and Junpei, the rest of the sorcerers were awake and looked fine, albeit tired. They had some minor scrapes, but they looked remarkably well for a group that had just fought a very deadly special grade.

“Yo! Your beloved teacher is here!” Satoru gave a peace sign and a wide grin.

Everyone in the room merely threw him a mix of tired and exasperated looks when they noticed his presence. Rude. This was how they treated him after he was ready to commit an uprising in their names?

Satoru ignored the reception and continued, “So, what’s the status? I heard you guys got into another mess the moment I’m away. Man, maybe I should keep you by my side all day? You first-years are somehow more problematic than the third-years!”

Nanami sighed as he fixed his glasses. “As you can see, we managed to survive against the special grade. Unfortunately, that curse is quite slippery and was able to escape via the sewer system.”

“Uh-huh, the weird newborn that can transform humans with just a touch. How scary~” Satoru made an exaggerated expression of fear.

“Shut it, blindfold! You know damn well that thing can’t touch you!” Nobara grouched while drinking her can of cold coffee.

“Just ignore him, Kugisaki,” Fushiguro replied, also holding a can of drink. “He’s like a dog. The more you pay attention to him, the wilder he gets.”

Satoru pouted. Why were his students so mean? He turned his attention to Yuuji, who was asleep. There weren’t any wounds on his body. Unlike the other first-years with minor wounds, it was as if he hadn’t been in a fight at all. He shifted his eyes to the other boy on a nearby bed. This should be Yoshino Junpei, a recently awakened sorcerer from a mundane background who had somehow become a pawn of the special grade.

“He looks quite well for someone who just got transfigured,” Satoru commented. He used his Six Eyes to examine the kid and found nothing unusual with the boy’s cursed energy.

“It’s strange, isn’t it?” Shoko piped up. She stood on the other side of Junpei’s bed and looked down at the boy with deep interest. “I’ve examined the special grade’s other victims. Initially, I thought nobody could survive that level of transformation. Even if they did stay alive, there was no way to turn them back to their previous forms. Even my Reverse Cursed Technique is no match against this degree of physical trauma.”

“And yet our King of Curses somehow did it,” Satoru said lightly, though his mood actually soured when he was reminded of the curse’s role. Although he had resolved to keep Sukuna away, the King of Curses had somehow managed to make his students more indebted to him.

“I’ve seen the process personally, and I can’t understand what that curse did,” Nanami said. “Perhaps, if you were there, Gojo-san, your Six Eyes could see what the King of Curses did to Yoshino.”

Yeah, that was the problem, wasn’t it? The moment Satoru took his attention away from his students for one second, that curse always popped out of its hiding hole. Hmm. He was very tempted to keep his kids with him 24/7, but alas, he knew that wouldn’t work. Teens like them loved their individuality, and he knew he had to let them stand on their own. This was a bitter truth he forced himself to accept. Unfortunately, the presence of the King of Curses made swallowing this familiar pill very difficult.

“As far as my examinations go, there are no issues with the kid’s physical body,” Shoko added. “I can’t say for certain about his mental faculties, but we can only wait for the boy to wake up to find that answer.”

“Are you curious about what I did?” a deep, rumbly voice pierced through their conversation.

The easy atmosphere in the room immediately dropped into freezing tension. Satoru turned around toward Yuuji on the other bed. The boy was still asleep, but the familiar mouth had manifested on the boy’s cheek. One of the red eyes had slid open to gaze at the sorcerers.

“How nice of you to join us, King of Curses,” Satoru said.

Nobody in the room offered the same greeting. Most of the sorcerers were tense, but Ijichi seemed to be on the verge of passing out. Although Shoko didn’t say anything, her eyebrows had raised with interest. Either she was curious about how Yuuji’s body worked, or she simply wanted to hear what the curse did.

“Did I not say that I have no interest in trading meaningless words with you, sorcerer?” Sukuna replied dryly. “I’m currently in a good mood, so I will deign to answer your questions.”

Shoko walked around Junpei’s bed to stand beside Satoru. She looked at the curse with curiosity and asked, “My best guess is that you have some form of control over souls. That’s the only way you can undo the transfiguration.”

“How very sharp of you, doctor.” Sukuna’s eye curved in approval. “You’re correct. I merely combine the Reverse Cursed Technique with a simple soul-healing technique to mold the boy back to his original form. Although I cannot perform a similar feat to the curse named Mahito, it is still within my power to guide the soul back to its previous shape.”

Simple. As if such an act wasn’t unheard of before this. In all of Satoru’s years as a Jujutsu sorcerer, this was his first time encountering someone with this type of ability. Oh, he knew that some techniques were related to souls, such as soul summoning. However, nobody could truly see the shape of a soul. Even Satoru’s Six Eyes could only register the presence of souls, but he could never truly view their actual appearance. But here, Sukuna plainly stated that he ‘merely’ used a ‘simple’ soul-healing technique to undo all the damage done to Junpei’s body.

Was this how people felt when they interacted with Satoru whenever he spoke of his techniques? To know that there was a part of the world that existed but you couldn’t touch or interact with? To see how someone could easily bend the rules of nature to their whims. It was… aggravating.

“Aw, do you want me to say thank you?” Gojo asked with a slightly mocking voice. “But I heard how you made another Vow with Yuuji. I thought Binding Vows were something sacred, yet here you are throwing them around like trading cards.”

Sukuna rolled his eye, but he didn’t look that annoyed. “What? You think I’ll just bend to the brat’s pleas and follow his orders like a servant?”

Satoru hummed. “I guess that’s understandable, but your demand for this Binding Vow is quite simple, isn’t it?”

“That newborn dared to touch my soul. I would like to strike it down myself, but as you can see, the brat has me fully under his control.” Sukuna grinned with a hint of bloodthirst. “If I could get my hands on that thing, I would certainly take my time slicing it to bits.”

Although they knew the King of Curses was not threatening them, the savage side of Sukuna still instilled deep fear in most of the sorcerers in the room. Satoru, on the other hand, was quite thrilled to see this new aspect of the curse. It was quite unfortunate that he would never have a chance to battle Sukuna. He would never wish to harm his student’s body, and he would rather exorcise the King of Curses than fulfill his wish to test his mettle against the curse.

However, the bloodthirst quickly subsided like a fleeting gust of wind, and Sukuna returned to his usual calm facade. “But I doubt I’ll have the chance.”

“Oh?” Satoru tilted his head.

Sukuna smirked. “I’m quite sure the brat will want to deal with that curse personally.”

After living in the world for so long, there were not many things that could surprise Kenjaku. However, hearing how Mahito’s mission turned out was one of the few events that managed to make him pause in a few decades. He hadn’t been upset when he received the news that the sorcerers had taken Sukuna’s Finger, which he had lent to the young cursed spirit. That cursed object was always meant to return to the King of Curses, anyway.

When he had listened to Mahito’s next scheme to draw out Sukuna’s vessel, he allowed the curse to continue. Since he couldn’t let anyone catch a whiff of his presence, Kenjaku had to trust the newborn special grade to deal with the rest of the plan. It had been a long shot, but he hadn’t expected how it actually turned out.

Mahito had returned heavily wounded, and the curse needed a day to recover. Jogo, who also had the displeasure of facing Gojo, accompanied him. Kenjaku even treated them by taking the two curses to an isolated hot spring where they could regain their cursed energies safely.

Mahito was still quite young, so he was very temperamental and whimsical, like any child. The curse kept rambling about the King of Curses and a mortal enemy. Although he had some guesses, Kenjaku didn’t bother to push the curse too far. He also had ample patience, which he had developed over many centuries. In the end, it was the special grade who spoke out as he soaked himself in hot water.

“Do you know that Sukuna has the ability to manipulate souls?” Mahito said with a gleeful smile.

Kenjaku blinked. “Pardon?”

“You don’t know?” Mahito turned to Kenjaku. “I didn’t see him do it, but he made a Binding Vow with Yuuji. He said he’s gonna heal Junpei, and unless he has some form of soul manipulation, he won’t be able to fulfill that deal.”

No, Kenjaku did not know at all. Despite his years of knowing the King of Curses, he had never heard of such abilities. Mahito was the first cursed spirit who could influence and mold the shapes of souls. As far as he knew, Sukuna only had his slicing and fire techniques. Did he obtain this ability after incarnating? The need to quench his curiosity was stabbing Kenjaku from the inside, but he artfully pushed it down. He would have time to question the King of Curses further when they reunited.

“The King of Curses is the master of Jujutsu sorceries. It’s not strange that he has a skill like that,” Kenjaku replied. “But tell me more about this Binding Vow.”

“Yeah! The Binding Vow!” Mahito’s face scrunched into distaste. “I was hoping that Sukuna would use that chance to forcefully take control of Yuuji’s body, but he instead ordered the brat to kill me!”

“Did he truly?” Kenjaku blinked. If that were true, it would throw a big wrench into his plan. “Can you tell me the exact words of the Binding Vow?”

“Take care of that eyesore of a curse named Mahito, and I’ll heal the brat,” Mahito deepened his voice in an attempt to mimic Sukuna’s baritone.

“Ah.” The tension in Kenjaku’s chest eased. “I think he merely wanted to teach you a lesson. I believe he was displeased with how you attempted to touch his soul, so he wanted to punish you a bit. The wording of that Binding Vow is rather vague, and I doubt he would expect a new sorcerer like Yuuji to exorcise a special grade like you.”

Mahito whined. “That’s mean. I’m just trying to help!”

Kenjaku smiled indulgently. “Sukuna is the King of Curses. When one interacts with him, you should always show the proper amount of respect and etiquette.”

Well, regardless of this minor hiccup, their plan was still the same. They would need to recover Sukuna’s full power and achieve Kenjaku’s ultimate dream of evolving humanity. Still, it was quite interesting how the King of Curses was more cooperative with his vessel than Kenjaku had previously expected. It seemed that, despite his arrogance, Sukuna understood the benefits of subterfuge.

Omake:

Sukuna: *Glares down at Mahito* Fucking know your place, trash.

Sukuna: *Manages to heal Junpei* Oh, great. Oh, Nice. I’m so great. I’m the best.

Sukuna: *Examines the kids and Nanami* You guys look fine, so I don’t think I need to heal you. So, cya later!

Sukuna: *Hears how curious people are about his abilities and also sees Gojo* Hi, Gojo! Do you want to know? I’ll tell you all about it! Do you see how great I am?! Not even OGkuna can do this! Did I do good? Praise me!

Sukuna: *Focuses too much on his fantasies of tearing Mahito to shreds for what he did to the cast at Shibuya* Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Wait, fuck! Calm down.

 

Satoru: I really want to fight Sukuna~ but I can’t~

Megumi: I feel like I’m a single father.

Nobara: I feel like a single mother who works two jobs loves her kids, and never stops.

Kento: May god have mercy on us.

Ijichi: *Can’t speak because he’s too stressed*

Shoko: Interesting healing skill. Does Sukuna consider working as a doctor?

 

Kenjaku: I wonder what Sukuna is planning.

Sukuna: *If he somehow hears Kenjaku’s words* I’m planning to fuck you up.

Chapter Text

When Junpei woke up, he found himself lying on an infirmary bed. He blinked several times at the ceiling, trying to piece together what had just happened. Slowly, the memory of his fight with Mahito came rushing back.

The teen attempted to sit up but was stopped by a strong hand. A man with white hair and a blindfold was standing beside him, looking down with a carefree expression.

“Nice to meet you, Junpei-kun~,” the man said with a sing-song tone. “Although you woke up earlier than expected, I don’t think you should try standing just yet.”

Junpei wanted to ask who the man was, but before he could speak, a hand smacked the stranger on the back of the head.

A familiar voice scolded, “Enough, Gojo-sensei. You’re going to freak him out.”

Junpei turned to see Fushiguro, the black-haired teen he recognized from earlier. He barely had time to process his presence before Gojo draped himself over Fushiguro, throwing his arms around the boy dramatically. The sight was almost comical, especially given the height difference; Fushiguro had to arch his back awkwardly under the weight of the taller man.

“Aiya! Why do my students keep getting meaner every day? You’ve never hit me before!” Gojo complained, pouting.

Fushiguro clicked his tongue, pushing the older man off with visible irritation. “If you didn’t want to get hit, you could’ve activated your Infinity, idiot.”

“But I don’t want to create unnecessary distance between us!” Gojo said, rubbing his cheek against Fushiguro’s spiky hair. “What if you suddenly wanted to hug me?”

“I would never,” Fushiguro snapped, shoving him away with finality. Once Gojo was at a safe distance, Fushiguro turned to Junpei, who had been watching the entire exchange with his mouth slightly open in disbelief.

“Sorry you had to witness that,” Fushiguro muttered, visibly exasperated. “How are you feeling?”

“I… I’m fine?” Junpei replied hesitantly. To his surprise, he actually felt normal, better than normal, even. He remembered being transfigured by Mahito, but now, his hands and face felt completely human.

“You’ve been asleep for two days,” Fushiguro explained. “Someone managed to revert you back to normal, but the process took a toll on your body, so you needed time to recover.”

Junpei blinked in disbelief. Someone could reverse Mahito’s transfigurations? He had seen that curse’s technique firsthand, and the thought of undoing something so grotesque seemed impossible. Then again, he was still new to the world of Jujutsu sorcery, and he supposed anything was possible.

Fushiguro continued, “Since we needed to make sure the special grade’s cursed technique didn’t leave any lasting effects on you, we brought you to Jujutsu High to monitor your condition.”

“What about Mahito?” Junpei asked. The fight had been a blur, but he remembered falling before it ended. “Is everyone alright?”

“Everyone’s fine,” Fushiguro assured him. “One of our supervisors, Nanami-san, showed up just in time to back us up. Unfortunately, Mahito escaped through the sewers.”

Junpei frowned at the news. He had hoped the curse would be dealt with once and for all, but it seemed the monster had survived. His hands clenched into fists. He couldn’t forgive Mahito, not after what the curse had tried to do to his mother.

“So, Junpei-kun!” Gojo’s voice suddenly cut through the room. The man had seated himself in a nearby chair, his face bright with a mischievous grin. Fushiguro shot him a withering look but didn’t stop him from speaking.

“Since that special grade is still alive, there’s a chance you’re still in danger,” Gojo said cheerfully. “Of course, it might have lost interest in you, but we can’t be sure! Who knows? You might get killed the moment you leave Jujutsu High! Hahahaha!”

Junpei stared at him, horrified. He couldn’t believe someone could deliver such grim news with so much enthusiasm. His face twisted into a grimace.

Fushiguro sighed deeply, looking as though he was praying for patience.

“I have an idea!” Gojo raised his index finger dramatically. “Since you have a cursed technique, why don’t you join Jujutsu High? Studying here will teach you skills to protect yourself. Of course, this also means you’ll have to take on dangerous missions. I believe you’ve already seen the kinds of perils sorcerers face, given your encounter with Mahito.”

“Joining… Jujutsu High?” Junpei’s eyes widened. He had never imagined he would be given such a choice.

Gojo continued, “Of course, you can also reject the idea. If being a sorcerer feels too risky, you could become a window instead. You’d still help by notifying us of any dangerous curses lurking around. But I’d strongly recommend joining! After all, who knows when that special grade might decide to pay you another visit?”

“Sensei, stop threatening the kid,” Fushiguro muttered, raising a clenched fist in mock warning.

“But I’m just telling him the truth!” Gojo whined like a child, shielding his head with his hands.

Sensei? Junpei thought, skeptical. This guy was supposed to be a teacher? He didn’t seem very reliable. Still, the offer didn’t sound half bad. Although Junpei had no desire to play the hero, he also didn’t want to stay weak. At least this way, he wouldn’t feel like a burden anymore.

“I-If I decide to join, what will happen to my mother?” Junpei asked hesitantly.

Gojo rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “Well, since your mother’s already been targeted, I’d suggest she move somewhere closer to Jujutsu High. There are tons of windows and sorcerers around here, so it’s much safer. I’d also recommend staying in the dormitory, but you can visit her every week if you want. What do you think? Doesn’t that sound like a good deal?”

Junpei eyed the man suspiciously. With that grin plastered on his face, Gojo looked like a devil making a tempting offer. Before Junpei could respond, however, the infirmary door burst open.

“Junpei!” Yuuji called out as he sprinted inside. He looked well despite the brutal fight with Mahito. There wasn’t a single scratch on him, even though he’d taken the brunt of the curse’s attacks. He stopped beside Junpei’s bed, beaming brightly. “You’re finally awake! Fushiguro just texted me, and I ran over as fast as I could! How do you feel? Anything wrong? Do you feel pain anywhere? Are—”

Gojo interrupted Yuuji’s barrage of questions by patting his shoulder. “Alright, alright, don’t overwhelm the kid, Yuuji. As you can see, our potential new student is alive and kicking! Also, fun fact: Sukuna can apparently heal souls. Wow! I wonder how the higher-ups will react to this. Maybe they’ll froth at the mouth and die from the shock! Ahahahaha!”

“Gojo-sensei, please don’t say things like that in front of your students,” Fushiguro scolded, smacking Gojo on the head again.

“Wait, new student?” Yuuji blinked and turned to Junpei. “You’re going to join Jujutsu High? That’s a great idea! You can stay in the dorms near our rooms, and we can watch movies together!”

Yuuji looked so genuinely excited that Junpei couldn’t bring himself to tell him he hadn’t decided yet. Meanwhile, Gojo’s impish grin suggested the man was already confident of Junpei’s answer. Junpei sighed. Oh well, there wasn’t really a way to turn back now. After stepping into the Jujutsu world, he knew he needed to grow stronger. He had to be ready for the day Mahito showed his ugly face again.

In the end, Fushiguro had to physically drag Gojo out of the room so that the doctor, Ieri, could examine Junpei in peace. Yuuji, too, was told to leave, but after flashing Ieri his best puppy-dog eyes, she relented. He promised to stay quiet and now sat cross-legged on the bed across from Junpei, watching intently as Ieri worked.

“You’re fully healed,” Ieri announced after her examination. “And there doesn’t seem to be any issues with your mental faculties. Congratulations on being the first human to survive being transfigured.”

Junpei blinked at her, startled. He wanted to ask what she meant by that last part, but Yuuji tugged him up before he could.

“Come on!” Yuuji said, grinning as he led Junpei out of the infirmary.

Outside, Fushiguro, Kugisaki, and Gojo were sitting on a nearby bench, waiting.

“Looking good, weird bangs,” Kugisaki teased with a grin. “I heard you’re joining us, huh?”

“I feel like I was threatened into it,” Junpei mumbled half-heartedly.

“Aw! Isn’t this nice?” Gojo exclaimed. “We actually have four students in a row for two years! There are usually only three, but now we have four. The more, the merrier!”

Initially, Junpei thought it was odd that there were usually only three students per year. But then, considering how rare sorcerers were, it started to make sense. “I’m already enrolled at another school. Wouldn’t that be a problem?”

Gojo gave a thumbs-up. “Don’t worry! I already sent the transfer papers! They should receive them today!”

Junpei could only gape. Did this man just assume he would accept the offer before he was even awake?! Fushiguro noticed his distress and gave him a pitying look. “You’ll get used to him.”

No. Junpei didn’t think he ever would.

Despite the questionable start, Junpei somehow managed to settle into Jujutsu High with relative ease. His mother had been quite worried when he didn’t return home after the fight. The sorcerers had informed her of his situation, though they had withheld many details. After hearing everything, she readily agreed to move closer to Jujutsu High and supported his decision to transfer schools.

“Aren’t you going to protest, even a little?” Junpei asked.

“To be honest, I still don’t quite understand all this weird stuff about curses,” his mother admitted. “But I trust you, Junpei. And I’ve seen how you act around those new friends of yours.” She gave him a warm smile. “That was the first time I saw such a bright look on your face. If going to Jujutsu High is going to make you happy, then I won’t stop you.”

Hearing his mother’s support made Junpei want to cry. He tried to cover his tears, but his mother pulled him into a comforting embrace. He was so relieved she was okay.

Moving house and switching schools at the same time was stressful, but Junpei’s newfound energy and motivation kept him going. Eventually, he found himself in his new room at the dormitory. It was surprisingly spacious and well-equipped, complete with a TV and an air conditioner. It seemed the school spared no expense, likely because there weren’t many students.

Junpei couldn’t help but feel glad about the change in scenery and circumstances. While he missed his mother, he was happy to be around peers his age who wouldn’t bully him. Yuuji was especially warm and welcoming, but Fushiguro and Kugisaki were just as accepting. The trio even threw him a welcome party, staying up all night binge-watching movies until sunrise.

As for school, Jujutsu High was nothing like the schools Junpei had attended before. While they still learned general knowledge from a standard curriculum, there were also classes about the Jujutsu world. Being the newest student with no prior experience, Junpei had a lot of catching up to do.

If he had to admit it, though, the hardest part was the physical training. Junpei was the weakest in the group, which wasn’t surprising, as he’d been a shut-in and had never bothered with exercise. Yuuji tried to help, but his physical abilities were in a league of their own. In the end, it was Fushiguro who became Junpei’s main trainer for hand-to-hand combat.

“We’re both Shikigami users, so it makes sense for me to help,” Fushiguro explained with a shrug. “Our summons might be strong, but you still need to improve your own fighting skills. If you rely too much on your Shikigami, you’ll become the weak link that enemies can exploit.”

The training was grueling. Junpei had never sweated so much in his life. Each time he was thrown to the ground or knocked back, though, he got up and tried again. He couldn’t afford to be the first one to fall the next time they faced Mahito.

While Fushiguro spent the most time helping him, Kugisaki and Yuuji occasionally joined in. Kugisaki enjoyed using dodge training as an excuse to throw her nails at him, while Yuuji offered to accompany him on morning runs to help him build stamina. Despite the physical exhaustion, Junpei couldn’t deny how fulfilled he felt studying at Jujutsu High.

A week later, things changed with the return of the second-year students. Junpei was in the middle of training with his classmates when he noticed three figures approaching. The second years had been on a long mission and were just returning. Their gazes immediately locked onto Junpei, the unfamiliar face. Junpei froze under their scrutiny, taking in his new seniors.

The first was a girl with glasses named Zen’in Maki. When Junpei tried to address her as “Zen’in-senpai,” she quickly shut him down, insisting he called her “Maki” instead. She hated her family name.

The second was a light-haired boy named Inumaki Toge. He only spoke using food-related words because of his cursed speech technique.

The last, and strangest, was a panda. His name? Panda. Junpei had heard that sorcerers were odd, but this was on another level.

“There’s actually one more second-year student,” Yuuji explained. “His name is Okkotsu-senpai, but he’s in Africa right now!”

“He’s the only one I respect,” Fushiguro added flatly.

“You know, he was actually haunted by this special-grade curse called the Queen of Curses,” Kugisaki whispered. “She’s super powerful. I think he was the one who cursed her, but I also heard Okkotsu-senpai has an insanely overpowered cursed technique.”

Junpei could only smile. Even the missing senpai was odd. Oh well. They could all be weird together.

“So, first-years, the exchange event is coming up,” Maki said while twirling her staff absentmindedly. Despite her lithe frame, Junpei was certain she could easily crack a skull open with that weapon. “Are you guys ready?”

Junpei had heard of the Goodwill Event, where Tokyo and Kyoto students competed. Frankly, he’d rather sit it out, but Gojo flat-out refused to let him, despite his very valid reasons.

“I’m still new at this!”

“So is Yuuji-kun~ The two of you can learn together.”

“I’ll just be a dead weight!”

“That just means you need more experience~.”

Junpei had fully grasped why his classmates, except for sunshine boy Yuuji, constantly wanted to punch their teacher. Gojo always wore that all-knowing, impish grin as he gleefully forced them into troublesome situations. He loved nothing more than watching his students suffer, even going so far as to take photos of their shameful states and share them with everyone in his contact list.

“As ready as I can be, Maki-senpai!” Kugisaki answered with gusto, and Yuuji joined in enthusiastically. Unlike the two hyperactive classmates, Fushiguro only nodded calmly.

Junpei, on the other hand, had none of their confidence. He knew he was the weakest among them. “I’ve only been at Jujutsu High for a week. I don’t think I’ll be much help.”

“Oh.” Maki’s sharp eyes locked onto Junpei, and he tried not to flinch under her gaze. “The new student, huh? I get it. To make sure you don’t fall too far behind, I’ll help you train.” An eager, yet threatening grin spread across her face. “Do your best.”

Ah. Mother. I don’t think I’ll survive to see you next week. That was Junpei’s last thought before submitting to his seniors’ brutal training regimen designed to bring him up to their standards.

Despite feeling like he was on the verge of death countless times, Junpei somehow survived until the start of the Goodwill Event. When he saw the Kyoto students for the first time, his immediate thought was, another group of weirdos. Some of them looked relatively normal, but his weirdo sense was tingling. At this point, he was convinced all sorcerers had to be strange.

One individual in particular caught his attention, a humanoid mecha standing among the Kyoto team.

Wow. Is that his cursed technique? So cool.

After Principal Yaga’s explanation of the competition, the two teams split off to finalize their strategies. Luckily, the Tokyo team had already discussed possible plans beforehand, so they weren’t overly anxious.

“The most dangerous one in their group is Todo Aoi,” Maki explained. “He’s already a grade-one Jujutsu sorcerer with insane physical strength.”

“Itadori can handle him,” Fushiguro said. “If it comes down to a brawl without cursed energy, this guy will win.”

“But fighting a grade-one sorcerer alone?” Junpei couldn’t help but voice his concern. He knew Yuuji was strong, but the aura radiating from Todo had been overwhelming.

“I’m not worried about Todo,” Maki said confidently. “He’s so straightforward it borders on idiocy. The ones we need to keep an eye on are the other Kyoto students.”

“Salmon,” Inumaki added cryptically, but while Junpei was still struggling to decipher the senior’s speech, Fushiguro seemed to understand.

“Is it because of the possible assassination attempt?” Kugisaki asked.

“Assassination attempt?!” Junpei straightened from his slouched position. Was this suddenly a spy thriller? What was this about assassination?

Panda tilted his head. “Your classmates didn’t tell you? Itadori’s been targeted before by the higher-ups because of his status as Sukuna’s vessel.”

Sukuna? Junpei’s eyes widened as recognition dawned. He remembered Gojo mentioning the name when he first woke up.

“It seems that Sukuna can actually heal souls! Wow, I wonder what the higher-ups will think about this development. Maybe they’ll froth at the mouths and die from shock! Ahahahaha!”

“Come on, that’s not important!” Yuuji interrupted, looking both embarrassed and anxious about the current topic. “It’s fine. Even if they try to kill me again, I’ve already gotten stronger. I can handle some students attempting to assassinate me.”

“Only you would talk about an assassination attempt as if it’s nothing,” Kugisaki snorted.

Junpei wanted to know more about this topic. Why hadn’t he heard about this before? Why was Yuuji hiding something so important from him? Unfortunately, the other boy had already escaped the meeting room, with the seniors following close behind. That left only Junpei, Fushiguro, and Kugisaki. His two friends watched his expression for several seconds before Kugisaki sighed.

“Stop looking so wretched, weird bangs,” she said, lightly hitting him on the arm. “Potato-head doesn’t like to talk about this with anyone, and since he likes hanging around you, we didn’t have the chance to tell you about it.”

Fushiguro nodded and finally took a seat next to Junpei. “I was the first person to meet Itadori. It was during a mission related to Sukuna’s Finger. Unfortunately, Itadori’s seniors got the brilliant idea to unravel the weakened sealing paper, which ended up summoning a bunch of cursed spirits into their school at night. We were cornered, and that guy thought that by eating the finger, he could gain cursed energy to fight the curses.”

“I mean, he wasn’t wrong,” Kugisaki added, earning a glare from Fushiguro, which she easily ignored. “He did become a sorcerer, but he also became Sukuna’s vessel. Luckily or unluckily, depending on who you ask, he’s a rare vessel who can suppress the King of Curses.”

Fushiguro sighed and continued, “The higher-ups wanted to execute Itadori immediately, but Gojo-sensei pushed back. He convinced them it would be better for Itadori to eat all of Sukuna’s Fingers before being executed.”

“Wait!” Junpei, who had been sitting silently with his head down, suddenly looked up in alarm. “Does that mean Yuuji is still scheduled to be executed?!”

“That’s the plan.” Kugisaki shrugged. “And if I heard correctly, that idiot actually agreed to the deal. Talk about suicidal.”

“And you guys are okay with this?!” Junpei demanded. He couldn’t accept it. Yuuji was the kindest and warmest person he had ever met. How could anyone decide to kill him just because he was a vessel? It was completely unfair!

Fushiguro’s face tightened as he replied, “I… It’s Itadori’s choice. And while I disagree with the assassination attempt, I can somewhat understand why so many people are against the existence of Sukuna’s vessel.”

“What’s so horrible about this guy?!” Junpei asked.

“Sukuna is the King of Curses,” Fushiguro explained, his hesitation giving way to deep wariness. “He’s one of the most infamous figures of the Heian era. We don’t know much about him, but some say he could rival Gojo-sensei in power. Somehow, the sorcerers of the past managed to take him down. Even so, his body refused to decompose like a normal human’s, and his fingers remain as special-grade cursed objects. In short, he’s incredibly dangerous.”

“And to make matters worse,” Kugisaki added, “that guy has all kinds of secrets and weird abilities. Technically, you’ve already met him, but Mahito transfigured you at the time, so I doubt you remember. Anyway, our murderous majesty somehow has soul-manipulation abilities. Not quite like Mahito’s, but he can probably heal wounds that normal Reverse Cursed Techniques can’t, like if you got your spine and body cut in half or something.”

“Although it’s still a minority opinion, there are some who believe that as long as Sukuna is confined within Itadori, it’s okay to leave him alive,” Fushiguro said, massaging his temples. His disapproval of that idea was obvious.

Kugisaki wheezed. “Wouldn’t that be hilarious though? Imagine: you’re bleeding out on the edge of death, and you go to the King of Curses, a murderous, cannibalistic bastard, and ask for help!”

Fushiguro groaned, clearly not wanting to entertain such an absurd scenario. Junpei, however, was confused. “Wait, wasn’t Sukuna the one who fixed me?”

“He was,” Fushiguro replied. “But only because he formed a Binding Vow with Itadori. Luckily, all he asked was to defeat Mahito. He was pissed that the special-grade curse dared to mess with his soul.”

As Junpei pieced everything together in his mind, the full picture finally came into focus, and he didn’t like what he saw. Although he was grateful to have been saved, he hated the idea of Yuuji being tied to someone as dangerous as the King of Curses.

Kugisaki noticed Junpei’s troubled expression and gave him a shove. “Calm down, weird bangs. I have a feeling Potato Head will be fine. At the very least, I don’t think he’s actually going to get executed.”

“Why?” Both Junpei and Fushiguro asked simultaneously.

“First, Blindfold definitely won’t let the elders kill Itadori. That guy loves potato-head to bits.” Kugisaki raised one finger. “Second, Sukuna already has that first Binding Vow with Itadori, where he can take over his body if he deems the situation ‘dangerous’ enough.” She raised a second finger and gave a wild grin. “I think that curse would probably use it to stop the execution if it ever came to that.”

“And this is good news to you?” Fushiguro stood up abruptly, pulling at his spiky hair in frustration. “We should tell Gojo-sensei—!”

“Hold your horses, urchin-head.” Kugisaki grabbed Fushiguro’s wrist and pulled him back down into his seat. “Despite looking unreliable, Gojo-sensei is smart, and I highly doubt he hasn’t already figured this out. If he hasn’t said anything, it’s because either he’s confident he can handle Sukuna even at full power, or he’s already made sure the execution will never happen.”

“That doesn’t make this sound any better,” Fushiguro grumbled, crossing his arms.

“It’s the truth, though.” Kugisaki shrugged.

Junpei wasn’t sure how to feel. On the one hand, he was relieved that Yuuji wouldn’t die. On the other hand, leaving someone as dangerous as Sukuna alive seemed like a terrible idea. He could only hope the exchange event would go smoothly. He was already stressed enough and didn’t think he could handle any more surprises.

Omake:

Sukuna: Hi Todo! Can’t wait to see you become Yuuji’s bro!

 

Junpei: I have a headache.

Megumi: I have a headache x2.

Nobara: I can’t wait to see what chaos will happen in the future.
Notes:

    Do I have to add that OG Gojo’s death reference? No.
    Do I regret it? No.
    Do I believe Canon Gojo is alive somehow and that he’ll return? YES. YOU CAN’T TAKE HIM FROM ME GEGE!
    Wait, no, wouldn’t it be funny if I make a crack fic where SIkuna shows up to heal Gojo and give a fuck you to OGSukuna? LOL.

Chapter Text

The Goodwill Event was one of the rare arcs where Yuuji wasn’t in much danger, so Sukuna could somewhat relax his guard. Oh, Hanami would show up, but they wouldn’t pose much of a threat and would merely serve as a whetstone for the students. With those considerations in mind, Sukuna reclined on his surprisingly comfy throne. Since he was stuck inside Yuuji’s body, there wasn’t much he could do except watch over the kid. However, boredom sometimes got the better of him, and he’d knock himself out until something interesting happened.

The competition was definitely one such occasion. Although Sukuna doubted he’d need to do anything because Gojo had everything under control, watching the kids fight one another was still entertaining. He was particularly looking forward to Todo’s fight with Yuuji. Everything played out quite close to canon, even with Junpei’s presence. As expected, Todo came barreling toward the Tokyo group like a gorilla.

Yuuji immediately engaged the older teen while the rest of the students scattered. Sukuna felt a grin spread across his face as he watched the two sorcerers clash. Yuuji was clearly thrilled to face someone who could match him in pure strength. Unfortunately, despite his excitement, the kid still got one-shotted by Todo, who then stomped Yuuji’s head into a tree.

Sukuna winced at the pain Yuuji must have felt. Physical pain rarely bothered him after becoming the King of Curses, but he could still imagine how the boy felt each time he got hurt. Although Sukuna was itching to intervene, he knew the kid needed to handle this himself. Thankfully, Yuuji managed to get back up despite the brutal beating, and the hilarious encounter that followed was well worth the wait.

“Tell me, Itadori Yuuji!” Todo bellowed. “What kind of woman is your type?”

Yuuji, stunned for a moment, quickly replied, “I don’t really get it, but if I had to say… A tall woman with a big ass, I guess? Like Jennifer Lawrence.”

When he turned his attention to Todo, the teen was staring blankly at Yuuji, clearly experiencing the "false memories" that had suddenly and inexplicably appeared in his mind.

Sukuna hummed, touching his chin. “Now this is interesting.”

Junpei wanted to scream. The exchange event had not gone smoothly. Oh, everything had seemed fine and dandy at first. Despite fears of an assassination attempt, the Kyoto students except for Todo hadn’t approached Yuuji. They’d still managed to get into a fight with the Tokyo group, but it was just a regular scuffle sparked by harsh words. There seemed to be a lot of bad blood between Maki and her sister, but Junpei didn’t want to poke into matters that weren’t his business. Either way, the fighting had been more like a typical teen drama than anything serious.

But then everything went utterly sideways.

A special grade curse suddenly appeared, and a veil dropped around them. At the time, Junpei had been with Fushiguro, watching him battle Kamo Noritoshi. Fushiguro had the situation completely under control, so Junpei had been on lookout duty for nearby cursed spirits. Out of nowhere, a massive tree-like structure sprouted and came crashing toward the building. They managed to escape to safety thanks to Inumaki, but the veil appeared moments later.

Junpei felt a wave of panic. The scene gave him flashbacks to what had happened at his old school. Was Mahito here?

Fortunately, it wasn’t Mahito. Instead, a new special grade appeared, one that seemed connected to nature. Fushiguro identified it as one of the cursed spirits that had attacked Gojo before. He tried to contact their teacher, but the special grade didn’t give them a chance. Despite there being four sorcerers present, they were nowhere near the level needed to face this opponent. Junpei was hit with a deep sense of déjà vu, and he didn’t like it one bit.

The special grade began speaking about “cleansing all humans so the planet could heal.” Goddamn. They were dealing with an eco-terrorist. Not that Junpei had anything against the environment, but he couldn’t accept being killed for the cause.

Inumaki managed to slow the curse down momentarily, buying them enough time to retreat to the rooftops. The bad news was that the cursed speech user hit his limit and passed out after blasting the special grade away. The good news? Maki arrived just in time to back them up. With Kamo down, it was now just Maki, Fushiguro, and Junpei against the curse.

Junpei thought grimly, Damn it. I’m nowhere near ready to face another special grade.

But there was no time for doubt. Junpei steeled himself and prepared to fight. He knew he wasn’t suited for hand-to-hand combat yet, so his best option was to create distractions to allow Maki and Fushiguro to focus on offense.

He had just obtained a new Shikigami and wasn’t sure how effective it would be against a special grade, but it was definitely better than his jellyfish for creating diversions. “Shoaling Wave,” he murmured, channeling a significant chunk of his cursed energy. A swarm of small, fish-like Shikigami materialized and immediately surrounded the special grade.

As expected, the curse easily tore through some of them, but the Shikigami gave Maki and Fushiguro an opening to execute a combo attack. Their efforts forced the cursed spirit into a nearby river, and the three sorcerers gave chase.

While Fushiguro summoned his Divine Dog: Totality, Junpei called forth Moon Dregs to attack the curse. Their combined efforts managed to overwhelm the special grade briefly, allowing Maki and Fushiguro to land a solid blow. But before they could capitalize on their advantage, the curse managed to plant a bud on Fushiguro’s stomach.

Crap.

Junpei immediately stepped in front of his friend. He wasn’t sure how much help he’d be, but Fushiguro was clearly incapacitated because the bud was preventing him from summoning more Shikigami. With no other choice, Junpei picked up a black blade and moved to stand beside Maki.

“Think you can keep up, new student?” Maki asked with a grin.

“I’ll try my best,” Junpei replied with a weak smile.

Summoning another Shoaling Wave, Junpei covered their attacks as best as he could. They had already injured one of the stalks in the curse’s eyes, so they focused on exploiting that weak point. Although he wasn’t as skilled as Fushiguro, Junpei had spent enough time training with Maki to somewhat keep up with her attacks. She dealt the most damage while Junpei worked to cover her openings.

Unfortunately, their efforts still weren’t enough to defeat the special grade. Maki was caught in the curse’s grasp, and Junpei was hurled into a nearby tree. The impact left him stunned, unable to do anything but watch as Fushiguro struggled to summon another Shikigami. Judging by the boy’s expression, he was planning to do something reckless. Junpei tried to stop him, but Maki interrupted first.

“Megumi, that’s enough,” she said. Despite being trapped in the curse’s grasp, Maki wore a grin. “We’ve done enough. It’s time to tag out.”

At that moment, two figures appeared on the battlefield. It was Yuuji and Todo, and they looked like best friends despite trying to beat the crap out of each other the last time Junpei had seen them.

Ah. That’s great. Junpei could pass out now.

Satoru felt like he was losing his mind. It seemed like bad guys couldn’t stop flocking to his kids, especially the first-year students. The Goodwill event was supposed to be a safe competition for young sorcerers, but here they were, dealing with cursed spirits and curse users inviting themselves to the party.

Satoru hovered above the veil that had been set to block him specifically, considering the situation. No doubt about it. This was just a distraction for something bigger. But he couldn’t abandon his students, so he was stuck waiting. And waiting. And as he waited, his frustration and anger built. And built.

Sliding his blindfold off, Satoru opened his eyes just as the veil began to fall apart.

His Six Eyes quickly assessed the scene below. Hmm, things were going better than expected. Aoi and Yuuji seemed to be holding their own against the special grade. In fact, Yuuji had improved significantly while he was inside. How nice~ Satoru made a mental note to reward the boy with some sweets later. But for now...

He had some trash to take out.

First, he dealt with the curse user near Gakuganji. The one responsible for setting the veil. It didn’t take much to destroy the man’s limbs and render him powerless. Gakuganji, of course, had to chime in with a warning about not killing someone with critical information. Satoru felt mildly insulted. He wasn’t one of those senile elders who’d destroy their only lead. Tossing a few teasing remarks at the uptight old man, Satoru turned his attention to the special grade curse.

Ah, he remembered that ugly face. This was the same curse that had managed to escape with its companion last time. He couldn’t let that happen again.

Lets-

“Cursed Technique Amplification: Blue.”

Get-

“Cursed Technique Reversal: Red.”

A little-

“Hollow Purple.”

Crazy.

The purple orb manifested and expanded in an instant. With a casual flick of his fingers, Satoru sent the technique hurtling toward the special grade.

CRACK!

BAM!!!

The trees and earth standing in Hollow Purple’s path were obliterated, leaving a massive chasm in the ground. Once his Six Eyes confirmed that the foreign cursed energy had vanished, Satoru grinned and pulled his blindfold back up.

“Yay! Success!” he cheered, giving a thumbs-up.

But deep down, he knew this was only the beginning. His suspicions were confirmed when word came in that someone had stolen all of Sukuna’s fingers and three of the Death-Painting Wombs.

As if dealing with three pesky special grades wasn’t bad enough, the captured curse user also mentioned a strange monk with an ambiguous gender identity. Not that Satoru cared. Male, female, nonbinary, whatever. If they dared to threaten him or his students, they were going down.

Still, the theft of Sukuna’s fingers put him in a foul mood. That King of Curses managed to make everything worse, even while sealed inside Yuuji.

Thankfully, Satoru was quickly distracted by talk of the Goodwill event. Despite the chaos, his careful preparation and investment were about to pay off. He made sure not to reveal any signs of scheming; after all, his former teacher could smell trouble brewing from a mile away. And Satoru couldn’t let his students miss out on the joy of competing in sports~

After giving everyone a day to recover, Satoru held a discussion with the students and then tossed the suggestion box at Yuuji, letting the boy pick their activity for the second day. For once, luck was on Satoru’s side, Yuuji pulled out baseball. Yaga, however, wasn’t as thrilled. The principal started yelling the moment he saw the results, but Satoru had already skedaddled out of earshot.

Of course, Yaga caught up to him eventually, but Satoru considered it an acceptable loss. Watching his students relax and enjoy their youth made it all worthwhile.

It was a week after the Goodwill event when Yuuji and his friends found themselves in a car, heading to another city. Despite Gojo’s best attempts to keep them close, the higher-ups had lost their patience and ordered him to let the first-year students take on another mission. This decision only came after a round of harsh words and threats exchanged in the elders’ chamber. How could Yuuji know? Well, sorcerers were surprisingly chatty, despite living in a secret world hidden from the public.

Gojo still hadn’t forgiven the elders for what happened during their first missions, and the subsequent incidents involving the first-year students made him even more reluctant to let them go. They had taken small missions here and there, but Gojo had always been nearby to keep an eye on them. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough sorcerers to spare, and they couldn’t humor Gojo’s whims forever. The elders had finally put their foot down this time and told Gojo that he had to let the first-years take a solo mission without him.

This time, they needed to investigate a suspicious string of deaths that had claimed three random victims. They got off to a disturbing start when they arrived at their first source of information, only to find that person was dead. The family was holding a funeral, and they didn’t want to bother the grieving parents, so they had no choice but to head to their school to investigate further.

Their group actually encountered two delinquents, who immediately began bowing when they saw them. Yuuji and Kugisaki initially felt pleased that ordinary humans could somehow sense their powerful aura, but then the delinquents called out to Fushiguro.

Eh?

The two teens looked at their usually silent friend, who was standing stiffly beside Junpei. The black-haired boy turned his head so far away to avoid their curious gazes. “My… Junior High… Here…”

It was quite funny to see Fushiguro acting this awkwardly, but Yuuji needed answers. Although he tried not to be pushy, his friend was obviously hiding something interesting. Did he start to sound like Gojo? Well, that didn’t matter. He was his student, after all. He needed to find out the truth. Kugisaki and Junpei also agreed with Yuuji, and together, they slowly pulled the full story from Fushiguro and the delinquents.

Surprisingly, despite being so serious, Fushiguro had been a problem child during his junior high years. Although he only beat up other delinquents, the new information was still surprising. In the end, they decided to let Fushiguro lead them, since he was familiar with the area. They soon met an old acquaintance of his, who gave them some helpful information. Their best lead was the Yasohachi Bridge, a popular spot for students to bungee jump. Yuuji was a bit interested in trying it himself, but Fushiguro gave him a good smack on the head to stop him.

Ouch.

Before they left, the old acquaintance mentioned someone named Tsumiki to Fushiguro. Yuuji couldn’t help but ask, “Who’s that?”

“My older sister,” Fushiguro replied flatly.

This time, Yuuji didn’t press further. Although he only had his grandpa as a relative, he understood that some people had complicated relationships with their families. He might not be the brightest, but he knew his friend wanted to keep this to himself. His other friends also kept their questions to themselves.

Despite spending hours at the bridge, they found nothing noteworthy that could be connected to a curse. Yuuji even tried bungee jumping with the plastic cord they brought, but he didn’t feel anything. Still, he had to admit that jumping off the bridge was quite fun.

The group was about to head back and rest for the day when one of the delinquents they’d met earlier showed up, alongside his older sister. The girl seemed to be another potential victim, but then she mentioned Fushiguro’s sibling. His friend’s face immediately shut down, but he quickly covered it up.

Fushiguro was obviously hiding something big now. After contacting Ijichi, the boy tried to tell them to return before him, but obviously, they weren’t going to listen.

“That guy is planning something stupid,” Junpei muttered.

“Urchin head is always an idiot, despite his best attempts at looking cool,” Kugisaki added.

“Let’s just follow him.” Yuuji didn’t want to slander his friend, as it was clear that Fushiguro was stressed about something. As expected, Fushiguro returned to Yasohachi Bridge, but this time, he was heading toward the area underneath the structure. There was a focused, cornered look on his face as he examined the bridge.

Fushiguro was definitely planning to investigate on his own. That wouldn’t do. They were friends, so they had to stick together. The three of them stopped behind Fushiguro and confronted him. The boy was clearly too distracted and hadn’t noticed them following him.

“You never tell us anything about yourself,” Kugisaki said.

“Acting like a dark and brooding shonen character isn’t that cool, you know,” Junpei stated.

“Not that you have to tell us anything,” Yuuji added. “But you can at least depend on us. We’re friends, right?”

Those words seemed to finally knock some sense into Fushiguro. He stood silent for a moment, and Yuuji feared they’d pushed too far. Luckily, the other boy seemed to need time to gather his thoughts.

“It’s because of Tsumiki.”

Fushiguro believed the curse hiding underneath Yasohachi Bridge was connected to his sister’s coma, and he wanted to exorcise it now, despite the danger. The story seemed straightforward to Yuuji, and he didn’t understand why Fushiguro was so conflicted. There was a curse hurting people, and since they were sorcerers, they had to exorcise it. Simple.

“Yeah, yeah,” Kugisaki said as she took the lead.

“You should’ve told us this from the start,” Yuuji added.

“You’re being needlessly self-sacrificial,” Junpei said.

Despite the harsh words, Fushiguro merely gave a small smile. Yuuji always knew that his friend preferred to shoulder his burdens alone. It might be because of his childhood, but that didn’t matter to Yuuji. They were his friends, so they were going to help.

Fushiguro’s suspicions were proven correct when they immediately entered a domain after crossing the small river. The curse resembled something from a whack-a-mole game. It kept popping in and out of numerous holes in the area. It didn’t seem too strong, but its speed might make it difficult to deal with. However, Yuuji doubted the curse would last long, given that there were four of them.

“This could be fun!” Kugisaki grinned, eager to slam her nails onto the curse’s head.

However, before they could engage with the enemy, another presence emerged behind them. The sorcerers turned around and saw a strange creature that gave off an eerie vibe. It had two mouths, and blood tears were coming from its eye sockets.

“What’s this? Somebody’s already here?” the curse asked, confused.

The curse could speak fluently, but it didn’t seem that powerful. Yuuji was sure he could deal with it himself, so he told the others to handle their original target. Things were going well until Kugisaki was suddenly pulled out of the domain when she tried to hit the mole curse.

Damn. This reminded him too much of the detention center.

Then, as if things weren’t bad enough, the other curse also ran away! Couldn’t anything go their way for once? Yuuji chased after his target and shouted at his friends, “I’ll help Kugisaki! Junpei, you stay with Fushiguro!” With those words, he leaped into the unknown.

The portal spat him out into the forest surrounding the bridge. Yuuji could still see the first curse, and he immediately chased after it. It was surprisingly fast despite its size. They kept running until they exited the trees and unexpectedly encountered Kugisaki and another curse. There was a strange face on its back, and the curse seemed awfully self-conscious about it.

“You looked!” the new curse screamed in horror.

“Ack! Sorry!” Yuuji automatically apologized.

“Big bro! Sorry! It wasn’t on purpose!” the first curse added beside him.

It really wasn’t intentional, but the curse didn’t accept his apology and became aggressive. The human-like curse began to sprout butterfly wings made of blood from its back.

“Supreme Rot Technique: Wing King!”

A drop of blood landed on a rock, and it immediately corroded the material. Yuuji and Kugisaki flinched at the sight. Shit. They needed to get away. The two didn’t waste time and tried to create some distance. The blood chased them like homing missiles. Yuuji was able to dodge, but his friend lost her footing. Without hesitation, he picked up Kugisaki and used his full speed to escape the attack.

They zoomed through the forest, and Yuuji leaped off a cliff to land on an empty road. He thought they were safe for a moment, but the first curse suddenly showed up and spat a mouthful of blood at Yuuji’s face.

It burned.

Not a moment later, Kugisaki was hit by the butterfly wings. Shit. Now, they were infected with some sort of poison. The two curses stood on either side of them, blocking their escape. Their situation wasn’t looking good, especially after the human-like curse explained its technique. Fifteen minutes for Yuuji and ten for Kugisaki before the foreign blood inside them corroded their bodies from the inside. Yuuji searched for a viable solution, but then Kugisaki began to laugh, and he remembered. Right. Kugisaki’s technique.

“A technique where you win if it hits, huh? You guys sure are strong,” Kugisaki said while pulling out a nail. “Too bad, I’m a bad match for you!”

“Strawdoll Technique: Resonance!”

Without hesitation, Kugisaki impaled her wrist with a nail. The two curses immediately spasmed in pain. Yuuji felt a grin stretch across his face. Okay. The tides had turned. They could definitely win this.

Unbeknownst to everyone, at that moment, another person was watching the fight with interest. Deep inside Yuuji’s soul, Sukuna observed the flow of battle with narrowed eyes.

“Hmmm, I don’t know if this will work, but…”

The King of Curses raised his hands and reached out to the souls connected in the heat of battle. This wouldn’t have worked normally, and he wasn’t sure how Yuuji triggered it with Todo, but… with the help of Eso’s and Nobara’s techniques…

Sukuna clapped his hands and triggered a resonance between Yuuji’s and the two Death-Painting's souls.

GONG!

Suddenly, memories began to flood into their minds.

For the two brothers, it was an image of them eating together at a table as a family. It was strange. It shouldn’t have been possible. There were only nine of them, and they had no brother who looked as human as Yuuji. Yet, their blood called to each other, and they felt it.

For Yuuji, he suddenly remembered old, faded memories. He was just a small baby cradled in his father’s arms. The bespectacled man smiled softly down at Yuuji, expertly ignoring his grandpa’s harsh warnings.

“I know you wanted a child that didn’t happen with Kaori, but her death was-”

“Father-in-law, what are you talking about?” another voice suddenly said. Despite being just a baby, Yuuji could see a woman approaching them. She had short hair and blank eyes. Yet, the first thing that caught his attention was the stitches on her forehead.

When Yuuji returned to himself, Kugisaki was shouting at him. “Itadori! Potato head! Wake the hell up! What the fuck is going on?”

It took him several seconds to realize he was lying on the road. Kugisaki was crouching beside him, shaking his shoulders. He blinked several times to reboot his brain before looking at his friend.

“What?”

“I should be the one asking you that!” Kugisaki shouted, half angry, half terrified. “You suddenly dropped to the ground. Those two curses released their technique and immediately ran away, like Gojo was after their asses! I wanted to pursue them, but you were still comatose on the ground! So tell me, what the fuck happened?”

Yuuji could only stare at her for several seconds. Surprisingly, she didn’t try to hit him to make him speak. After a moment, he said, “I think I remember something important.

Omake:

Sukuna: *Sees a strange thing happening when Todo gets a false memory* Oh? What’s this? Interesting~ I think I can use this sometime in the future~ 

Sukuna: *Gojo makes an appearance* Hollow Purple! It’s Hollow Purple time!

Sukuna: *Tries a new technique* Hehehehe, I’m a genius.

 

Yuuji: What?????

Nobara: What the fuck is going on?!

Eso & Kechizu: ??????
Notes:

    Junpei only has Moon Dregs in Canon, so I need to give him new abilities. Shoaling Wave is basically a group of fish that works similarly to Megumi’s Rabbit Escape. It doesn’t have high attack power but is great at overwhelming enemies.
    Also, I just remembered that Kenjaku needed the finger at Junpei’s house to track the storage location. But Yuuji already ate that one, lol. So let’s just assume he put another tracker in another finger that he let the sorcerers claim~
    The first half of Yuuji’s POV definitely should be Megumi’s, but I was too lazy to rewrite it. Anyway, our spiky boy will get another POV in the next chapter.

Chapter Text

Megumi was not having a good day.

First, he had to revisit his old junior high and face the ghosts of acquaintances past. Then, he chased down a curse that might’ve been tied to Tsumiki’s coma. And finally, the supposedly weak cursed spirit turned out to be a special grade. Not just any special grade, one even stronger than the one they’d faced in the juvenile detention center.

Fuck his life.

It wasn’t until now, bloodied and winded, that Megumi began to piece things together. The curse had consumed one of Sukuna’s Fingers. Its recent surge in activity? Likely tied to the King of Curses’ revival.

BANG!

A cursed energy projectile shot toward him. Megumi barely blocked it with his sword, which shattered on impact. The blast opened a gash on his forehead. Before he could recover, the cursed spirit closed the distance, aiming a brutal punch at his back.

“Fushiguro!” Yoshino acted fast, sending one of his jellyfish Shikigami to intercept the blow. It managed to soften the attack, but Megumi was still hurled into the cave wall. Pain flared down his spine.

They weren’t going to win this. Not like this.

Megumi’s fingers instinctively formed a mudra. “With this treasure…”

But before he could summon Mahoraga, Sukuna’s voice echoed in his head. “Is it because you know you’re holding a trump card that will solve everything? That mindset will get you killed.”

Gojo’s voice followed, a distant memory: “Dying to win and risking your life to win are completely different, Megumi.”

‘A stronger version of myself…’

He stopped.

Slowly, Megumi changed hand signs, rising to his feet. “Fine then… Let’s do this.”

A wild grin spread across his face.

“Domain Expansion: Chimera Shadow Garden.”

Shadows burst from beneath his feet, consuming the cave floor like ink in water. Blood poured from his nose and eyes, and yet Megumi only laughed. It was incomplete, yes, but it was enough. The shadow creatures swarmed the special grade, distracting it long enough for Megumi to close the distance and land a kick to its face.

Yoshino followed up, warping two jellyfish around the curse. They held it down for a few precious seconds, enough for Megumi to create a shadow clone and summon two Nue for a pincer strike.

The curse roared, firing another cursed projectile that obliterated the clone. Realizing too late it had fallen for the feint, it tried to power up, but Megumi had already called forth Divine Dog Totality. The shikigami tore into the curse from behind, ending it.

As the cursed spirit disintegrated, so too did the domain. Megumi collapsed to one knee, just managing to grab Sukuna’s Finger before everything went black. His last sight was Yoshino rushing toward him.

“Idiot!” Yoshino caught him before he faceplanted into the dirt. Megumi’s consciousness faded with the thought of his still-missing friends.

Sleep brought with it old memories, ones he’d rather leave buried. Junior high hadn’t been particularly hard, despite the fights. Gojo had kept the Zen’in clan away, which made things easier. But it was also the last time he saw Tsumiki before the coma. He regretted how cold he’d been, brushing her off as naïve when she had only ever cared for him.

He never got to apologize.

When Megumi awoke, he found himself on the ground, his head resting on something soft, Yoshino’s jacket. His friends looked down at him, expressions equal parts relief and concern.

“Look at you! Why are you so bloody?” Kugisaki demanded.

“Junpei told us everything! You used Domain Expansion?!” Itadori’s eyes were wide.

“It was terrifying,” Yoshino added, smiling sheepishly.

“Ugh, quiet… My head hurts,” Megumi groaned, trying to sit up. His vision wavered.

Kugisaki snorted. “You’re just lying there like some hero clutching Sukuna’s Finger. So dramatic.”

Megumi blinked. Wait, how did they know the curse had a Finger? He’d figure it out later. Right now, they had a job to do.

“We need to call Nita to get it sealed. Fast.”

“I already contacted her,” Yoshino said. “She should be here soon.”

Good. Of everyone, Yoshino was the only truly reliable one. Itadori was strong but too straightforward. Kugisaki tried to act cool, but she wasn’t exactly subtle. He had genuinely worried when they disappeared during the intruder attack.

“Should I just eat it?” Itadori asked casually, smiling like he’d offered to finish someone’s leftovers.

Megumi deadpanned. “This isn’t leftovers.”

Kugisaki smacked him. “Don’t you dare.”

“We don’t know how many Fingers you can contain,” Megumi said. “So don’t eat this one.” He handed it over anyway. “But you keep it. For now. And seriously, don’t eat it.”

“I’m not a dog…” Itadori muttered, but he reached out anyway.

Then, a mouth opened in his palm and swallowed the Finger whole.

Silence.

“We told you not to eat it!” all three yelled in unison as Itadori flailed.

“What?! Me?! I didn’t do it!” he cried. “Sukuna! Why’d you do that?! Didn’t you hear what Fushiguro said?!”

Megumi twitched at Itadori’s familiar tone with the King of Curses. He could already imagine Gojo’s face when he heard about this.

Thankfully, Nita arrived shortly after and hauled them back to the hotel, scolding them all the way. Megumi missed most of it, he passed out the moment he sat in the car.

When he woke again, it was dark. His clothes had been changed, his wounds dressed. He stared up at the ceiling, the events of the day crashing down around him.

It hadn’t been the breakthrough he’d hoped for.

Just another Finger. Another dead end.

Gojo had exhausted every option trying to lift the curse on Tsumiki. He’d hired seal experts, old clans, even underground groups. Nothing worked. One of the seal masters had said something that stuck with him:

“This isn’t modern. This is ancient. Something from the Heian era.”

The Heian era…

Megumi sat up, suddenly alert.

They did know someone from the Heian era. No, he knew someone. Sukuna.

Megumi covered his face with one hand.

He had lectured Itadori over and over about avoiding contact with Sukuna. And here he was, considering a deal. It was foolish. Dangerous. Desperate.

And yet… the idea refused to leave.

The next morning, Megumi emerged from his room with dark circles under his eyes.

“Whoa! You look like a panda!” Itadori said. “I thought you were out cold!”

Megumi didn’t waste time. “Itadori. I need to talk to you.”

“Eh? I didn’t drink your coffee!” Itadori immediately raised his hands in protest. “I swear!”

“What?” Megumi gave him a flat look. “You don’t even like coffee. It’s obviously Yoshino or Kugisaki.”

“Oh, right. Then, what’s up?”

Megumi hesitated for only a moment.

“I need to talk to Sukuna.”

“…What?”

“I need to talk to him,” Megumi repeated, firmer this time. “It’s about my sister.”

Itadori stared at him, confused but concerned.

“She’s cursed, right?”

“Yes, but there’s also a seal on her forehead. It appeared the moment she collapsed. Gojo-sensei has tried everything. Nothing works. But one of the experts said it’s Heian-era magic.”

“So, you think Sukuna might know something?”

A low, amused voice answered before Megumi could.

“You want my opinion?”

The two teens stiffened as Sukuna’s mouth and eye appeared on Itadori’s face, his red gaze fixed on Megumi with curiosity.

“Aren’t you worried I’ll exploit this opportunity?” Sukuna asked.

Megumi didn’t flinch. “You won’t help for free. I get it. But I’m willing to negotiate terms.”

“Fushiguro!” Itadori hissed, more worried than angry.

Sukuna chuckled. “And what do you have to offer me?”

Megumi hesitated.

“…Maybe nothing. But Gojo-sensei might. If I ask, he’ll give you something—so long as it’s within reason.”

“Dragging your teacher into this mess too?” Sukuna’s voice dripped with amusement, his eye curving into a mocking grin. But the expression quickly faded, replaced by a pensive silence. His eye narrowed, thoughtful.

“Before we proceed, it’d be better if I saw your sister myself. I’m knowledgeable, yes, but I won’t pretend I’m an expert in seals. I’d hate to make promises I can’t keep.”

The thought of Sukuna anywhere near Tsumiki made Megumi’s skin crawl—but he knew the curse was right. A drawing or description wouldn’t carry the lingering cursed energy a firsthand inspection might reveal.

“…Fine,” he said.

With the uneasy agreement in place, Megumi and Itadori asked Nitta to drive them to the hospital.

The sterile halls greeted Megumi like ghosts from a half-lived life. He didn’t need signs or directions—his feet knew where to go. They stopped outside Tsumiki’s room, the door just slightly ajar.

Inside, she looked unchanged. Pale, thin, but peaceful. Time had carved nothing into her face. Only the seal on her forehead marred the illusion of rest.

Megumi approached her bedside, letting the silence settle. Behind him, Itadori stayed respectfully back. After a long breath, Megumi finally said, “You can look.”

Itadori stepped forward and shifted his position, angling his hand so Sukuna’s eye had a clear view of Tsumiki’s face.

For a while, the curse said nothing. Just watched. Observed.

The silence stretched too long.

Megumi gritted his teeth. “Well? Do you know anything?”

“Nothing definitive,” Sukuna said at last.

Megumi’s stomach twisted.

“But,” Sukuna added, and both boys leaned in, “I believe I know who created this curse.”

“What?!”

“You’re telling me someone actually made this?” Itadori asked.

Sukuna ignored the outburst. “They’re a strange one. Eccentric, but clever. If anyone could design a seal this intricate, it’d be them.”

“But if they were around in your time, they should be long dead!” Itadori argued.

“Normally, yes,” Sukuna said smoothly. “But this individual possesses a rare cursed technique. Not powerful in combat, but… quite handy.”

His eye curved into a smirk.

“They steal bodies.”

Megumi stiffened. “Like vessel possession?”

“More or less. They hijack a human’s body, suppress the soul, and continue living. Have done so for centuries.”

A chill swept through Megumi’s spine. Someone that old, that skilled, still active after a thousand years? That was a nightmare waiting to happen.

“But why would they target her?” Megumi snapped. “Tsumiki isn’t a sorcerer. She doesn’t even see spirits. What could someone like that possibly want with her?!”

“Who knows what that bag of bones is thinking?” Sukuna said lazily.

Megumi’s fists clenched. “You’re lying. You know more than you’re telling.”

Sukuna didn’t deny it. He just hummed in vague amusement.

“Fine. Then tell me what you want. Let’s make a Binding Vow.”

At that, Sukuna clicked his tongue. “I refuse.”

“What?!”

“There’s nothing you can offer me, little sorcerer. And since I can’t lift the curse on your sister, there’s no deal to be made.”

The eye and mouth vanished from Itadori’s skin without fanfare, as if Sukuna had grown bored of the conversation.

Silence lingered in the hospital room.

Megumi’s shoulders sagged. He stared at Tsumiki’s face for a long moment, jaw tight.

“We need to tell Gojo-sensei,” he muttered, already pulling out his phone.

After completing the mission and recovering, there was no reason to stay in the city. The group returned to Jujutsu High and gave Gojo a full report. The debrief was brief, Gojo was clearly distracted, his mind elsewhere. Yuuji didn’t ask. He already had a good idea of what was bothering him.

They were given the next day off as a reward for their efforts. Normally, Yuuji would’ve taken the chance to explore Tokyo. This time, though, he didn’t have it in him. The recent events had shaken him more than he let on, and all he wanted was a quiet place to lie down.

He declined Kugisaki’s invitation to hit the mall and locked himself in his room. The moment the door shut, he dropped onto the bed like a stone.

Surprisingly, Sukuna remained quiet, no snarky remarks, no mocking laughter. Just silence. And for a while, Yuuji let himself stew in it. But eventually, he broke.

“Hey, Sukuna,” he said aloud. “Back then, when we were fighting those two curses… that weird thing that happened. That was you, right?”

A pause. Then Sukuna stirred, his presence unfurling like smoke.

“Oh? Whatever could you be suggesting?”

“Don’t play dumb.” Yuuji rolled onto his back. “I might’ve been busy fighting, but I remember your presence getting stronger just before it happened. Those flashbacks or memories or whatever… that was your doing, wasn’t it?”

“Since I’m bored, I’ll humor you,” Sukuna said. “I was experimenting. Trying a new technique.”

“A technique? What, flashback projection?”

“Don’t be stupid,” Sukuna huffed. “There exists a rare phenomenon, when cursed energy resonates under certain conditions, individuals can glimpse each other’s souls. I simply forced it to happen between you and those brothers.”

“Brothers…” Yuuji echoed, recalling how one had called the other his big brother. “But why? What was the point?”

“Would you be satisfied if I said curiosity?”

“Sukuna.”

That single, flat word said it all.

Sukuna gave an exaggerated sigh. “Fine. After inhabiting your body, I began seeing souls more clearly. Each one is unique, yet sometimes, echoes remain, marks left by important people, or significant experiences. You, and those two brothers… you share the same shade.”

Yuuji frowned. “What are you talking about? Same shade of what?”

Sukuna grinned, voice dripping with amusement. “Why don’t you figure it out yourself?”

Yuuji clicked his tongue. He’d been around Sukuna long enough to know when the curse was baiting him, never outright lying, just making the truth a puzzle. “Whatever. Keep being cryptic. Anyway, about Fushiguro’s sister—”

“I’m not telling you anything else, brat.”

Yuuji sighed. “I figured. You love your secrets. I’m not trying to take them, just saying, you were weirdly chatty about Tsumiki. Fushiguro was ready to make a Binding Vow, and you turned him down without a second thought. Why?”

“Why not?” Sukuna replied lazily.

“Well, wouldn’t having more Binding Vows help you? Seems like a missed opportunity.”

Sukuna chuckled darkly. “Are you suggesting you’re tired of being my vessel and want to help me cut a few more deals?”

Yuuji waved a hand. “Please. I already said you’re a decent roommate.”

Sukuna snorted. “And I said how ridiculous that was.”

“Yeah, yeah. But that’s the thing, I don’t get you.” Yuuji sat up, rubbing at his face. “Everyone’s told me not to trust you. Hell, you’ve told me not to trust you. But lately… you’ve been acting like a total creep, sure, but also like a surprisingly decent creep.”

“‘Decent’? Did you just call the King of Curses decent?”

“Hey, don’t blame me! That’s the vibe you’re giving off.”

Sukuna grumbled. “Vibe… vibe… What a stupid word.”

Before he could launch into a rant, Yuuji cut in. “Look, what I’m trying to say is, I want to trust you.”

That shut Sukuna up.

“I know you’re hiding stuff. I don’t understand half of what you say. But I see what you do. You didn’t lie to Fushiguro. You didn’t use the Binding Vow. You helped, in your own weird way. So…”

Yuuji took a deep breath.

“Please don’t betray my trust.”

Silence.

A long, heavy silence.

“…You’re a hell of an idiot, kid,” Sukuna said at last.

Yuuji blinked. “Wait. Did you just call me kid? Not brat?”

“Don’t push it.”

With that, Sukuna retreated, his presence folding inward. Yuuji could feel a wall slide into place; an invisible barrier between their minds. The conversation was over.

He sighed and flopped back onto the bed, dragging a pillow over his head.

“I said what I needed to say,” he muttered into the fabric. “Now let’s see what you do with it.”

Satoru was increasingly convinced that Ryoumen Sukuna was the bane of his existence.

The curse had been nothing but trouble since its reincarnation. First, special-grade curses had started appearing like roaches. Then, his first-year students couldn’t go a week without nearly dying. And now? Some ancient acquaintance of Sukuna was cursing people into comas from the shadows. Why? Only that smug curse knew.

The moment Megumi’s call ended, Satoru instructed Ijichi to dig into any other suspicious coma cases. It would take time, but he needed to know how deep this conspiracy ran. Until now, he’d assumed Tsumiki had been targeted by one of his enemies, someone trying to hurt him through his students. But Sukuna’s cryptic hint suggested something much larger was in motion.

How had something this big slipped past him? Whoever this was, they’d been planning for years, possibly decades. An ancient sorcerer, living since the Heian era… this wasn’t someone Satoru could afford to underestimate.

He’d spent the day buried in the archives of Jujutsu High and the Gojo clan estate, breathing in more dust than cursed energy. He hated reading. Sure, he was a genius, but he’d always preferred action to academia. Still, he forced himself through old tomes and brittle scrolls, only to find nothing concrete about this so-called “acquaintance” of Sukuna. Whoever they were, they had erased their trail flawlessly.

By the time Satoru snapped the last book shut, the sun had long since set. He rubbed at his eyes through his blindfold and groaned. He would’ve preferred fighting a dozen curses to spending hours in a library.

He stood and stretched, tempted to sneak out and grab some sweets, anything to distract himself. But he couldn’t. Not when his instincts were screaming. Something was wrong. And the only two people who might know the truth were Tengen and Sukuna.

Most would choose Tengen, of course. But Satoru didn’t like the ancient tree one bit. And he especially didn’t want the old geezers catching wind of this. Nobody saw Tengen without the higher-ups’ approval, and Satoru wasn’t in the mood to play politics.

He could break protocol, sure. Go straight to Tengen. But he knew that would raise alarms, especially if the traitor he suspected was watching. And something in his gut said the mole and this mystery curse user were connected.

Which left him with one miserable option.

Sukuna.

Great.

So, for the second time that week, Satoru found himself standing in front of Yuuji’s door in the middle of the night. He didn’t like disturbing his student, but this was bigger than Yuuji. The kid was already carrying too much. This problem was one the adults needed to solve.

Without hesitation, Satoru teleported inside.

It didn’t take long for Sukuna to notice. The curse manifested on the sleeping teen’s cheek, his eye narrowed in annoyance.

“What do you want now, sorcerer?”

Satoru tilted his head with a smile. “Expecting me?”

Sukuna’s voice was dry. “After what I told brat number two? I’d be a fool not to.”

“You’re a real puzzle, you know that?” Satoru said. “Whoever your little friend is, they’re planning something huge. You could’ve kept your mouth shut, but instead you’re feeding my students breadcrumbs.”

Sukuna grinned. “Maybe I enjoy watching you squirm.”

Satoru raised an eyebrow. “I thought you’d want to fight me yourself. Or are you scared?”

Sukuna snorted. “Cut the nonsense. You want to know about the one behind the coma cases, don’t you? Fine. They’ve gone by many names over the years… but their original one is Kenjaku.”

Satoru blinked, taken aback. He’d expected resistance, maybe a demand for a Binding Vow. But Sukuna was offering the answer freely. Did he hate this Kenjaku enough to sic Satoru on them like a guard dog? If so, that could work in his favor. Or it could be a setup.

Satoru narrowed his eyes. “You’re being very cooperative all of a sudden.”

Sukuna’s eye twitched at the word “cooperative,” a scowl forming. “I’m feeling charitable. Consider it a favor. And if I were you, I’d check your friends’ graves. Kenjaku has a taste for second chances. If I recall, there was another Special Grade sorcerer besides you... Are you sure you burned the body properly?”

Satoru froze.

Suguru’s smile flashed in his mind.

No.

Omake:

Sukuna: *Eats the finger* Sorry, kid, I need it for Shibuya.

Sukuna: *Hears Megumi’s request* What’s this? Another way to pull Kenjaku out of his hidey hole.

Sukuna: *Gets confronted by Yuuji* Yuuji, you idiot! Stop trying to peel off my mask! It’s there for a reason!

Sukuna: *Sees Gojo* Fucking hell Gojo. This is becoming a habit, and I don’t like it. Ugh. I really need some sleep, but fine, I’m gonna throw you more hints.

 

Satoru: WHAT THE FUCK?! WHAT THE FUCK?! WHAT THE FUCK?!
Notes:

    I'll probably take a break before Shibuya because I need to reread the whole series. The plot is also not done, lol, and I'm not confident about portraying Kenjaku. I hate the man, but he's smart. The Kenjaku in my fic is probably gonna be dumber.

Chapter 14

Chapter Text

Satoru rarely visited this area. He was never someone who liked to reminisce about the past too much. As the strongest, he had many burdens and duties to carry, and he didn’t have much time to waste on pointless memories. Hell, he barely had enough time to sleep every day. Yet after hearing Sukuna’s warning, he immediately teleported to this familiar grave. Although he had only laid his eyes on it once, this spot had been ingrained deeply into his mind.

Satoru stared at the name Geto Suguru for a long time. Memories of his three years as a student at Jujutsu High replayed in the back of his mind. The chill of the windy night battered him, yet he felt slightly feverish. Since Suguru had been marked a traitor, the elders refused to give him a space in the sorcerer cemetery at Jujutsu High. Although he had been enraged back then, he felt somewhat grateful now since he didn’t need to be overly careful when digging up the grave.

Satoru could have found a shovel and slowly dug out the dirt. It wouldn’t be that hard since he maintained his physique. But he didn’t have much patience, and he wanted answers right now. So, he simply channeled Blue and gently lifted the soil. Once the casket was revealed, he used the same method to pull open the cover.

Satoru stopped breathing.

It was empty.

Satoru didn’t know what happened, but the next thing he knew, his blindfold was off. The grave before him had already returned to its pristine condition. Nobody would notice that someone had dug up the grave to check the corpse in the middle of the night. He kept staring at the name on the tombstone.

Suguru’s smile flashed again in his mind.

This time, he was bloodied, and his right arm was missing.

Satoru was pointing Red at him.

He breathed in.

Breathed out.

When Satoru blinked, he found himself standing outside of Shoko’s office. Beside him, she was another regular night owl who couldn’t get enough sleep. He stepped into the room and found her sitting behind her desk. His old classmate looked up, and her eyes widened. She usually would give him a dry comment whenever he showed up, but this time, she was silent. Whatever was on his face made her hold her tongue.

Shoko slowly got up from her seat and placed her hands on his upper arms. With a pinched brow, she asked, “Satoru?”

Satoru opened his mouth, but no words came out for a moment. Shoko waited patiently while keeping her eyes locked on his. Eventually, he mustered enough willpower and energy to say, “Shoko… I made a big mistake.”

Choso was a big brother. He knew all of his siblings. There were nine of them, and until recently, they had all been trapped inside jars in a secluded storage building. Only Eso and Kechizu were supposed to be free alongside him. And yet, he somehow felt a new strand of connection stretching somewhere far away. It shouldn’t be possible. There were nine brothers. Only nine. But now, there were ten.

How?

When Eso and Kechizu returned from their first mission, they came bearing bad news. The sorcerers had claimed Sukuna’s Finger. Thankfully, the curse user named Geto didn’t seem upset by the development. After giving a short report, his two younger brothers looked at him with barely hidden panic. He quickly led them out of the room and found a secluded spot away from prying ears.

“What’s wrong?” Choso asked.

His younger brothers traded glances for several seconds before Eso spoke up. “Big brother, you felt it, right?”

His brother didn’t have to elaborate more for Choso to understand. He had been playing the ridiculous human game with Mahito and Geto when he suddenly felt a tug on his soul. The new threat connected him to his non-existent tenth brother.

“… Yes.”

“Big brother,” Kechizu whispered. “We got into a fight with two young sorcerers. They were very strong, and it got quite bad at one point.” Choso wanted to interrupt and ask whether they were okay, but his younger siblings looked ready to burst with their desire to share their findings, so he stopped himself. “There’s this one human boy. He looked very human, but something… something weird happened!”

“We used our techniques on them,” Eso continued, “Perhaps when our blood mingled, it awoke the connection between us and the boy. We don’t know how, but that young sorcerer is definitely our brother!”

Choso was silent as he tried to process this new information. A new younger brother. Their tenth sibling. The youngest of them all. If this boy was a human teen, then he couldn’t be that old. However, that shouldn’t be possible. They had been trapped inside the jars for many years. Their mother had been a normal human and could not bear more children after them. Then, the only one who could be the culprit in creating their tenth brother was…

Kamo Noritoshi.

Choso’s eyes widened as he remembered the face of that useless father. Those sharp eyes and short black hair. However, there was one thing that drew his attention: the stitches on his forehead.

Choso had to grit his teeth to the point of pain to stop himself from barging back into the room and confronting the curse user ‘Geto’. That worthless father had shown up again. That piece of shit. He dared to grant them bodies so he could use him and his siblings as pawns. Not only that, he had definitely tried to pit his two younger brothers against their tenth sibling while they had been unaware of their familial connection. He clenched his fist until he drew blood as he tried to calm himself down.

Calm down.

Although he wanted to kill his useless father, this was not the right moment. Now that they had a new human brother, it would be unwise to continue working with cursed spirits. He also had no desire for them to become pawns in Noritoshi’s game. So, they had to cut their ties. However, he understood that they couldn’t just run away. The curse user would definitely notice them leaving, and that would put his brothers in unnecessary danger.

“Brother?” Eso called, worried.

Choso blinked and gave a weak smile. “Sorry, after hearing what you said, I just realized some things.” He relayed his discoveries to his younger brothers while making sure to keep his voice low. He couldn’t let Noritoshi realize that he knew his true identity.

“Then, should we just leave?” Kechizu asked.

Choso shook his head. No. What they needed to do was play along until Shibuya. At that point, he would definitely be tasked with distracting Gojo Satoru. Although he wasn’t sure that he could survive against such a powerful sorcerer, he was definitely more confident about staying alive on that chaotic and dangerous battlefield. Then, he just needed to find the right moment to escape with his brothers.

“What about our youngest sibling?” Eso asked. “I believe… his name is Itadori. His fellow sorcerer called him that.”

Itadori. Itadori. Choso’s eyes widened when he realized that the name of Sukuna’s vessel was Itadori Yuuji. Damn it. Noritoshi definitely used Yuuji as his major pawn in whatever game he was playing. That bastard. It wasn’t enough that he created and abandoned him and his siblings after raping their mother, and now he had to make another son that he could exploit for his goal.

There was no way Choso could abandon his youngest sibling. Running away from this mess wasn’t an option now. It would be a big leap of faith, but Choso would have to side with the sorcerers. Although he wasn’t overly fond of humans, he knew that Yuuji had grown up as one. Based on the information he got from Noritoshi, he doubted his brother would abandon his friends, so they had to help the sorcerers win this game. He could only hope that once the dust had settled, he could make a deal with them where he and his brother could be left in peace.

And so, Choso started to plan.

Kento deeply understood that Gojo was someone with a flair for dramatics. However, he couldn’t understand why he had to be woken up at an ungodly hour. While Gojo might be a workaholic, Kento had no desire to devote more time or energy beyond his working hours. Yet, he could only succumb to Gojo’s whims as he added him to a new group and flooded the chat room with irritating messages.

[Gojo Satoru: Hello, everyone~]

[Gojo Satoru: Sorry to bother you at this hour, but I’m sure you guys won’t mind getting contacted by the fantastic me!]

[Gojo Satoru: Anyway, I have some important news~]

[Gojo Satoru: Super important! You guys should come! Definitely!]

[Gojo Satoru: Shoko is also waiting~]

[Gojo Satoru: You can meet us at her office, so don’t be late~]

Kento hoped Gojo would stop using such an excessive amount of tilde ( ~ ). Not only was it unnecessary, but it was also annoying. He wished he could just close his eyes and ignore whatever shenanigans Gojo was cooking up. However, experience told him that it was better to humor him and keep an eye on the man before he truly messed something up when they weren’t watching.

Being a Jujutsu sorcerer was truly shit, doubly so when one had to deal with Gojo Satoru. With a heavy heart, Kento got up from his comfortable bed and braced the cold night to meet with Gojo. When he arrived at Ieri’s office, he saw several other victims waiting inside. Ijichi looked half-dead on his feet, while Principal Yaga looked pissed off. Ieri was actually smoking, despite having quit a few years ago. The author of their miseries, on the other hand, was happily munching on cakes that he had obviously just bought from a store.

“You’re the last one to arrive, Nanami!” Gojo chirped.

Kento was tempted to make Gojo drop his cake, but his respect for all foods, especially bakery goods, stopped him from doing so. That, and the fact that this manchild would absolutely throw a tantrum. He just wanted to finish this quickly and go back to rest.

“What do you want, Gojo-san?” Kento asked. “Please don’t tell me you just gathered us here on a whim.”

“Do you think I’m that horrible? Your senpai is hurt~” Gojo pouted.

Yes. Kento wanted to say, but he held back. Yaga had finally lost his patience and interrupted their usual back and forth. “Spit it out, Satoru. I can’t deal with your craziness at this hour.”

“You’re all too biased against me! I really have a good reason to call you guys at this hour! Pinky promise!” Gojo raised his little finger.

Everyone merely stared at Gojo blankly. Ieri sighed and put out her cigarette. “Just tell them, Satoru.”

Gojo clicked his tongue and crossed his arms. “Fine~ Long story short, our King of Curses was kind enough to inform me that apparently one of his ‘acquaintances’ is still alive and kicking. They’ve been hanging out since the Heian era and are planning something very big. I don’t know what yet, but I believe they have put seals on several mundane humans. Tsumiki is one of them.”

Kento blinked several times. He had not expected to hear such horrible news at this moment. Also, why would the King of Curses bring this matter to Gojo? What was that curse planning? He didn’t have much time to ponder the situation since Gojo kept sharing more terrifying revelations.

“Now, you all might be thinking, ‘That’s impossible, Satoru! Nobody can live that long!’ Well, usually, you would be right. Unfortunately, this curse user has a special technique that lets them ‘borrow’ other people’s bodies. So they’ve been hopping from one corpse to another!” Gojo gave a wild grin tinted with bloodlust. “And you know whose latest body they’ve taken a fancy to? Anyone care to guess?”

Kento was afraid to hear the answer. Someone who could survive that long must be intelligent, and they had to use a body that could benefit them. The most urgent question was whether or not this curse user could utilize the ability of the body they stole. If they could, then that would make them a special grade. He wished he could go back to the time when he didn’t know such danger was lurking in the dark. Or at least, could Gojo wait until morning? Now that he had heard this news, there was no way he could go back to sleep.

“Just spit it out!” Yaga gritted out.

Gojo pouted.

Thankfully, Ieri stopped Gojo from going into another ramble and said, “They stole Geto Suguru’s corpse.”

The room descended into stillness. Kento’s eyes widened. That was not good. Geto was a Special Grade sorcerer, and his cursed technique was very powerful. If this curse user got their hands on it, they could cause numerous problems.

“How did you know?” Yaga asked.

“After speaking with our dreadful King of Curses, I dug up Suguru’s grave,” Gojo replied, utterly lacking the previous levity. “It was empty.”

Kento could see Yaga struggling with himself. He was also tempted to berate Gojo and Ieri for not burning Geto’s body to ashes, but he knew the weight of sentiment, and he couldn’t say much against that. He remembered how cold Haibara’s body had been as he lay on the autopsy table.

Nobody spoke for a long time.

“So, what are we going to do?” Yaga eventually asked.

“Nothing much, really, except investigating,” Gojo replied. “I’ve called you guys here because I trust you completely. There’s a mole inside the Jujutsu headquarters, and I’ve been searching for them. We can’t warn anyone else without alerting the enemy.”

“You think they’ve infiltrated the higher-ups?” Kento pursed his lips. While he wasn’t particularly fond of the elders, he still respected them slightly for their experience and knowledge. If they had been compromised, that could only mean bad news for Jujutsu sorcerers. They would be at a severe disadvantage.

“Most likely,” Gojo said, crossing his arms. “The best thing we can do now is gather more information about our enemies without letting them notice that we’re aware of their plans. Ijichi!” The assistant director, who had been silently suffering, tensed when he saw Gojo pointing at him. “You’ll be the one to gather more information about the coma cases. I want to know who else, besides Tsumiki, has been a victim of this Kenjaku.”

“Principal Yaga has a better relationship with those geezers, so I’ll leave it to you to find out which one of them is the traitor.” While Yaga would usually reprimand Gojo for calling the elders “geezers,” this time, he merely nodded silently.

“Nanami and Shoko can search for more Jujutsu sorcerers who can be trusted. I’ve already had Utahime screen the Kyoto branch, but I’ll leave it to you guys to gather allies we can depend on when shit hits the fan.”

Gojo grinned as he pointed his thumb at himself. “As for me, I’ll do my own research and keep an eye on my students. Whatever Kenjaku is planning, I’m sure this curse user will try to make Sukuna work with them. They are acquaintances, after all.”

“You believe the King of Curses is working with Kenjaku?” Ijichi asked. He was clearly afraid of the future where they would have to deal with Sukuna as their enemy. Although Yuuji had been the perfect vessel to contain the King of Curses, who knew what kind of cards Kenjaku had up their sleeve?

“Unlikely, or else why would he tell me about Kenjaku’s scheme?” Gojo said, but then grimaced. “But seriously, that Sukuna is very aggravating. Even if he doesn’t work with this curse user, I doubt that guy doesn’t have his own little plan. Do you know how often I want to bash my head against the wall whenever I hear his name? He always causes trouble and can’t stop dragging the kids into danger! Seriously, how can anyone be this unreasonable?”

Kento felt that Gojo didn’t have the right to say such things. Although he didn’t trust the King of Curses, at least in terms of polite conversation, Sukuna had better manners than Gojo. However, he kept his mouth shut because it was clear his senior had a deep distaste for the curse. Seeing that Gojo didn’t have anything important to say, they began to leave Ieri’s office and let the man rant by himself.

When Kento returned to his apartment, his fear of not getting any sleep seemed to be true. Despite the bed calling him with its promise of sweet rest, his brain refused to let him sleep. In the end, he had to give up and open his laptop to get some work done. His eyes flickered to the clock in the corner of the screen; it was three o'clock.

Jujutsu sorcerers were truly shit.

Although Yuuji enjoyed being a sorcerer and helping people, he couldn’t deny that he also liked lazing around and exploring the city. It was Sunday, and they didn’t have any missions assigned to them, so he decided to shop for some sweets and just explore. Although he had stayed in Tokyo for several months now, there were still many places he hadn’t visited.

Yuuji had accompanied Kugisaki on her shopping trip for the first half of his day, but they decided to split up afterward. He didn’t have a destination in mind, so he simply let his feet take him wherever. Eventually, he entered a candy shop that caught his attention. They sold all sorts of sweets, and he quickly picked up some mochi for Gojo. The man never rejected sweets, and although this wasn’t Kikufuku Mochi, Yuuji was sure his teacher would still appreciate it.

As Yuuji examined all the candies on the shelves, he was reminded of Sukuna, who had been unusually silent.

“Do you want anything?” Yuuji asked silently in his mind. He generally preferred to speak out loud with the King of Curses, since communicating with his mind took a bit of effort. However, he didn’t want other customers to see a mouth on his cheek speaking to him.

“What?” Sukuna grumbled.

“Were you taking a nap?” Yuuji asked.

“No. What do you want, brat?”

Yuuji wanted to pout. After the last confrontation, Sukuna had become a lot more snappish toward him. He also kept saying the word "brat" pointedly, as if to make a point. Well, Yuuji didn’t care. He had made up his mind about Sukuna for now, and as long as the curse didn’t break his trust, he didn’t see a reason to change it.

“I just want to ask if you want any sweets,” Yuuji replied.

“Che, you think I want to eat trash like that?” Sukuna replied. “Maybe if you offer me human meat, then I’ll accept.”

Yuuji didn’t take this to heart and waited patiently while picking up other sweets for his friends. Sukuna had been trying to make himself out to be a "bad guy" ever since Yuuji had called him nice. Well, his attempts were doing the opposite for Yuuji. Yuuji had always had a strong intuition about people, and he was quite sure that the King of Curses was only pretending. Sukuna reminded him of people who were rough on the outside but soft on the inside. He was surprisingly similar to Grandpa and Fushiguro, people who didn’t dare show that they cared about others for one reason or another. In his experience, the best way to break down their walls was to be patient and let them figure things out themselves.

“How about Matcha Cream Daifuku? I think you quite enjoyed that last time.” Yuuji didn’t wait for Sukuna’s response before picking up several. The items in this store were quite pricey, but Yuuji had some savings and didn’t mind splurging for his friends. Sukuna only clicked his tongue but didn’t reply. When Yuuji exited the store with his purchase, he got a message and a location from Kugisaki. Seeing that it was nearby, he sprinted toward the café where his friends were waiting.

Unexpectedly, Fushiguro was also there. There was even another teen sitting across from them, and after a quick look, Yuuji realized that she was Yuko Ozawa. It was quite a surprise to meet an old classmate in Tokyo, but he remembered her moving here after finishing junior high.

“Hey, Ozawa! What’s up?” Yuuji greeted her.

The teen looked quite surprised and speechless for a moment. They ended up chatting for a while. Of course, Yuuji couldn’t say anything too specific about being a sorcerer, but it was still fun talking with an old friend. When the sky was splattered with orange, he escorted Ozawa to the station before joining his friends. They ended their day by meeting up with Junpei and watching a movie at the theater.

When Yuuji returned to Jujutsu High, he shared his purchases with his friends and Gojo. His classmates thanked him, but his teacher took it a step further by hugging him tightly and calling him his favorite student. Once they all got their share, he went to his room to change his clothes. At that moment, Sukuna finally spoke up.

“Have you not realized that the girl you met was interested in you?” Sukuna asked. Now that they were back in the safety of Yuuji’s room, the curse manifested his mouth.

“Eh?” Yuuji stopped.

“It seems that you’re truly brain dead.” Sukuna rolled his eye. “It was obvious that the girl wanted to see how you’d react to her new appearance. From your memories, she was quite different from how she looks now. Are you really this oblivious?”

“Um, really?” Yuuji didn’t realize. He had thought that Ozawa only wanted to chat with an old classmate. Did he do something wrong?

“You’re hopeless.” Sukuna sighed. “What? Are you not interested because she doesn’t fit into your standards? Ah, what is it? Tall with a large posterior?”

Yuuji sputtered. “Why do you have to say that so mockingly? People have preferences, you know!”

Sukuna ignored his protest and continued, “Do you honestly expect you have a chance with that popular actress?”

“Shut up! I just like looking at her, okay?” Yuuji pouted. It wasn’t the first time Sukuna made fun of him for proclaiming his preferences loudly. “I never expected that I’d get into a relationship with her. As for Ozawa, I don’t think it’s a good idea for her to be my girlfriend…”

“Because you’re a sorcerer and she’s a regular human?” Sukuna asked. “... Or is it because you know you’ll be executed?”

Yuuji didn’t answer and continued changing his clothes.

Sukuna exhaled a deep breath. “See, you’ve been failing to remember that I’m a curse that puts you on a death sentence. Although we’ve been cohabitating peacefully, the truth is that we’re destined to be enemies. You sorcerers wish to get rid of me, and I wish to continue to exist. Those two desires cannot coexist. You better get that fact into your thick skull, brat.”

Yuuji bit his lip as he sat down on his bed. “I haven’t forgotten, and I’m not afraid of being executed. But… I just… I’ve been thinking. If we could continue to work together like this, wouldn’t it be nice if we just stuck together? Gojo-sensei will need to convince the higher-ups, but maybe I could continue working as a sorcerer until I’m old while I continue being your vessel. That… sounds nice, doesn’t it?” He weakly laughed as he lay down. “Or maybe that’s just me being a coward. I did promise sensei to let them kill me once I consume all of your fingers.”

Sukuna stayed silent, but he remained close. Yuuji closed his eyes and enjoyed the other's presence. Although the curse had no body, Yuuji could still feel his soul. It was similar to a hot campfire. While it might get you burned if you weren’t careful, it was also warm and welcoming once you got used to it. Minutes passed before the King of Curses said, “You’re not a coward for wanting to live.” Then, he returned to his space and raised a familiar barrier between their minds.

Yuuji chuckled. “And you keep saying that you’re a bad guy.”

Omake:

Choso: Wait for me, Yuuji! Your onii-chan will save you!!!

Satoru: That damned Sukuna, I’m gonna get him one of these days!

Kento: I want to retire.

 

All the adults: *stressed out and can’t sleep*

Sukuna & Yuuji: *Go shopping and eat candies*
Notes:

    I don’t know how Japanese graves work, lol. So this is my best attempt. I believe the majority of Japanese people burn the dead, and you can also see this process when Yuuji gathers his grandpa’s ashes and bones after eating Sukuna’s finger. I tried to Google this stuff online, but no luck. So, I just kind of assume that Gojo is copying the Western burial method here.

    Also, I don’t think Mechamaru dares to spy on Gojo since he has Six Eyes. No way he can avoid being detected. However, he can still track Gojo’s movement somewhat by looking at the people around him.

Chapter Text

Trying to investigate enemies without being noticed by a mole and the elders was a difficult task. Their first major breakthrough was discovering the spy's true identity: Muta Kōkichi, more commonly known as Mechamaru. The result of the investigation shook Utahime, who couldn’t believe that one of her students was a traitor. Unfortunately, the only thing they could do was apprehend the mole and try to extract more information about their enemies.

Satoru assigned his trusty first-year students to capture the suspect. The real Kokichi Muta should be located inside a run-down apartment building. So, on a bright sunny day, Utahime accompanied the three young sorcerers to confront their mole. Sadly, they didn’t find anything at that location. Utahime reported that the room had been entirely empty except for an old chair. Failing to capture the suspect was disappointing, but at least they could confirm that Kokichi was their mole. Satoru could see how the boy had gained so much information with his cursed technique. He doubted that his mecha body was the only thing the student could control.

The atmosphere at Jujutsu High became tense when news of the spy spread. Although the students weren’t aware of the secrets Satoru and his colleagues kept, they could still feel the change in the air. A storm was brewing, and it was only a matter of time before it hit them. Then, at the end of October, Satoru finally uncovered what Kenjaku was planning. It began with the appearance of a massive veil in Shibuya, one that prevented mundane humans from escaping. Not only that, but the trapped civilians also demanded that ‘Gojo Satoru’ show up. Well, well, well.

‘So this is what you’ve been planning,’ Satoru mused as he strode into the crowded station. Taking in the throngs of people, he knew deep down that not all of them would survive. If his guess was correct, Kenjaku must be working with the group of special-grade cursed spirits that had been bothering them for the past few months. If they wanted to deal with Satoru, those curses would definitely station themselves inside this building. Dragging in this many civilians was part of their plan to inhibit his movements and prevent him from going all out.

How very smart.

Satoru would enjoy destroying Kenjaku.

As he descended to the Fukutoshi Line Platform, Satoru encountered two familiar faces and one stranger. He had met Baldy and Weed, but the human-looking curse was new. That one had to be one of the Death Paintings. As expected, the curses used the humans as obstacles to limit his movement. The two special grades quickly attacked ruthlessly, but the Death Painting remained distant and passive. Unlike the special grades, the new curse seemed to avoid killing the civilians. Hmm. He put the thought away, as he didn’t have time to ponder it.

The special grades attempted to breach his Infinity using Domain Amplification, but Satoru wasn’t worried. These weaklings wouldn’t be able to beat him like this. However, his blood still boiled when he saw Baldy taunting him by beheading a civilian. Bastard. He would make them all pay. He decided to take down Weed first since that curse was the most slippery. The Death Painting would be his last priority because it wasn’t as proactive.

Satoru pretended to aim after Baldy to make Weed drop its guard. As expected, it stopped using Domain Amplification to utilize its cursed technique. Heh. Big mistake. He seized the chance and pulled out the two branches from its eye sockets. Baldy tried to save its friend, but its attempts to attack and distract him were meaningless.

Satoru had aimed to exorcise Weed, which had managed to run away from him twice. He increased his cursed technique potency and reduced the special grade to mere splatters on the wall.

SPLAT!

Satoru turned to Baldy and said, “Next.”

The special grade got scared and immediately kept its distance, using civilians as cover and obstacles. Just when Satoru was losing his patience, a train suddenly came, spitting out waves of transfigured humans onto the platform. His eyes widened in horror. No.

Another special grade exited the vehicle. Like the Death Painting, this one looked remarkably human. However, Satoru didn’t have time to observe them. He had to stop more civilian deaths. There was no way he could kill the transfigured humans while dealing with the special grades. Then, he had to make a gamble.

Satoru raised his hand and formed a mudra.

“Domain Expansion: Infinite Void.”

0.2 seconds. That was the time Satoru gave himself to remove 1,000 transfigured humans from the Fukutoshi Line. Red blood and gore spilled into the air, reminding him that these were humans he was killing. Yet, he couldn’t mourn their lost lives because he had to eliminate them before they hurt more civilians. When his objective was achieved, he was left heaving as he released his Domain.

Before he had a second to gather himself, Satoru noticed a small box lying on the ground. Prison Realm. He knew the function of this horrible cursed object. In fact, during his research, he had been thinking about Kenjaku’s plans. Whatever that curse user wanted to attain, they had to remove Satoru from the equation. He was their biggest threat. Besides the Inverted Spear of Heaven and Black Rope, this cursed object was another dangerous item that could counter his Infinity. And what would you know, the thing had gone missing many years ago. How convenient.

“Gate… Open.” A voice called from far away.

The Prison Realm unfolded, revealing a massive eye glaring at him. Satoru was about to launch himself away to avoid being sealed when suddenly, a familiar voice called out.

“Yo! Satoru.”

Satoru automatically turned around, and sure enough, it was the body of Geto Suguru. Piece of shit. Caught you. He didn’t let himself think and leaped toward Kenjaku. He grabbed the curse user’s throat and sent them both flying dozens of feet away from the Prison Realm. Some civilians got caught in the way, but he could only think of the numerous methods he could use to destroy this disgusting monster who dared to sully his best friend’s body.

“You fucking think that cheap trick will work on me, you piece of shit?” Satoru grinned wildly at the curse user. He tightened his hold on the throat and slammed Kenjaku into the wall, which broke under the pressure.

Kenjaku merely grinned back. Although a bead of sweat rolled down his forehead, the man looked awfully calm. “How unfortunate.”

Then, suddenly, Satoru felt something breach his Infinity and hit him straight in the lower stomach. It was a small blade. He couldn’t examine the thing closely, but he knew it was spreading its effect on him. It was turning off his cursed technique and cursed energy.

Shit.

Without hesitation, Satoru used his last chance to teleport away to safety. He couldn’t manage to get out of the station, so he landed harshly outside the toilet on an upper level. With a harsh breath, he used the wall to pick himself up and made his way inside one of the stalls. Only then did he let himself examine the cursed tool sticking out of his stomach.

Satoru pulled out the blade and tried to use the Reverse Cursed Technique to heal the wound. His cursed energy could barely move, but he somehow managed to knit some of his muscles back. It was still bleeding sluggishly, but at least he wasn’t going to die from blood loss now. The bad news was that the cursed tool had already done its job, and Satoru could only helplessly watch as his cursed energy became weaker and weaker until, eventually, he could no longer maintain Infinity.

Fuck.

“The Soul Piercing Blade?” Jogo asked.

The group had gathered together after Gojo’s disappearance from the Fukutoshi Line Platform. Noritoshi’s plan to trap the sorcerer inside the Prison Realm had been a failure, which was great news to Choso. During his investigation, it seemed that the man was Yuuji’s teacher and had been the one who protected his brother from execution. Having him alive and well could only mean good things for Yuuji.

“It was a backup plan,” Noritoshi smiled genially. “I had hoped the Prison Realm would be enough, but just in case, I also brought this cursed tool to deal with Gojo. It’s less powerful than the Prison Realm since it cannot wholly contain the sorcerer. However, it has the ability to suppress the cursed technique and cursed energy of the person it strikes. Unfortunately, this effect doesn’t last forever, and since this is the first time I’ve ever used it, I can’t say for sure how long it will keep Gojo down.”

“What do we do now?” Mahito asked, tilting his head.

“Well, we have three options,” Noritoshi raised three of his fingers. “First, we can find Gojo and try to shove him into the Prison Realm. Without his power, he won’t be able to put up much of a fight. Second, we can just kill him, but I don’t recommend this, since another Six Eyes user will be born in the future and may cause trouble for us.”

Both Mahito and Jogo gave bloodthirsty grins at the suggestion. Clearly, the two of them didn’t like the sorcerer after their encounter. Not that Choso could disagree. While he didn’t plan to let Noritoshi win, he had also felt the life-threatening danger when he faced Gojo in their recent fight. That man truly deserved to be called the strongest sorcerer.

Noritoshi continued, “Third, we can try to find Sukuna and ask him for help.”

“Aw, that’s no fun. I vote for killing them all~” Mahito said with a wide smile.

“Mahito?! What the hell?!” Jogo disagreed with killing Yuuji. Choso also disapproved, but he forced his expression to remain impassive. It wouldn’t do for the others to notice him caring about a random human. The two argued about how to deal with the situation, but he tuned them out.

Choso's priority was to find Gojo. He had already assigned his brothers to seek out Yuuji, so he needed to ensure the man’s safety. This would also help him gain favor with the sorcerers. If he could escort the man to his allies, he could also explain his situation in a favorable light. His decision to hold back from killing humans would also be noted by Gojo. Good. Everything was going well.

“Let’s make it a game then, shall we?” Mahito said. “If I encounter Itadori first, I’ll kill him. If Jogo finds him first, then you can offer Sukuna’s Fingers to restore his powers.”

Choso blankly stared ahead. Not if Eso and Kechizu found Yuuji first.

“What about you, Choso?” Mahito asked.

Choso glanced at the curse and replied blandly, “I believe subduing Gojo is more important.”

“How boring~ what are you going to do, Geto?” Mahito turned to Noritoshi.

The man smiled and pointed at the big eye staring at them from afar. “I will need to safely close the Prison Realm first. It will take some time and attention, or else someone else is going to get trapped inside, and we won’t be able to use that cursed object.”

With those words, the group scattered and began to search for their target. Choso started sprinting, trying to locate the missing sorcerer. He had to be the first to find Gojo, or all of his brothers’ fates would be uncertain.

Yuuji had been walking alongside Mei Mei and Ui Ui on the train tracks when he suddenly heard a familiar voice in his ear. Wait. Wasn’t this Mechamaru? He was about to destroy the strange headset when Mechamaru interrupted.

“Hold on! I’ve got important news! Satoru Gojo has been sealed!”

Yuuji’s eyes widened while his hand froze. No way. That’s impossible. His teacher was too strong. How could such a thing happen?

“Or well, at least that’s what I planned to say.”

Yuuji’s hand tightened again, wanting to destroy the headset in anger. It wasn’t time for jokes, and it wasn’t funny! He almost had a panic attack!

“Calm down! Listen to me first!” Mechamaru added when he noticed Yuuji was on the verge of destroying the tool. “The enemy failed to trap Gojo inside the Prison Realm, but they still managed to hit him with another cursed tool! It’s called the Soul Piercing Blade, and it is able to suppress cursed energy. Your teacher was able to teleport away at the last second, but I doubt he got far. He is currently completely vulnerable, and the enemies are hunting him down!”

Mechamaru began to explain the situation. To save Gojo, they had to take down the veils that surrounded Shibuya. After conversing with Mei Mei, Yuuji agreed to listen to Mechamaru’s suggestion and returned to Meiji-Jingu-Mae to inform the other sorcerers. With his speed, Yuuji managed to reach and exit the station quickly. Several transfigured humans got in his way, but he quickly took them down and jumped up the tallest building nearby.

Yuuji took a big lungful of breath and shouted, “NA-NA-MIIIIIIN!!! NANAMIN, ARE YOU THERE??? GOJO-SENSEI’S CURSED ENERGY HAS BEEN SEALED!”

Not knowing whether or not his allies heard him, Yuuji could only keep yelling. His voice echoed and spread under the moonlight, equally distributing the bad news to allies and enemies. Someone suddenly whacked him on the head, and he whirled around to see Fushiguro, Junpei, Nanami, and another sorcerer. Fushiguro didn’t look pleased with Yuuji’s shouting, but Yuuji couldn’t pay much attention to him since he had to relay the situation.

After hearing the news, Nanami ordered Ino to accompany the students in dealing with the veils while he searched for Ijichi outside. Luckily, it wasn’t hard to guess where the enemies had placed the nails generating the curtains. The group quickly went to the tallest building in the area, the Shibuya Tower, where they confronted three curse users.

Ino decided to deal with the old woman and her grandson alone, while Yuuji, Junpei, and Fushiguro took care of the strange old man. The fight was quite tricky since the curse user had a strange cursed technique. The good news was that they had Fushiguro with them, so his friend quickly figured out what they were dealing with. Once they knew the trick, it wasn’t hard to make the enemy fold like wet paper.

Although they managed to break the three nails, Ino somehow fell from above. Yuuji and Fushiguro managed to save the man from falling to his death, but it didn’t seem like the older sorcerer could keep fighting. What had he encountered up there? Yuuji wanted to get up to the rooftop and beat those guys up, but Fushiguro stopped him.

Right.

They had to save Gojo first.

In the end, Yuuji could only leave Fushiguro and Junpei to take Ino to safety while he went to save his teacher. Despite being the one to suggest the idea, Fushiguro looked reluctant to let him go alone.

“Maybe I should go with you,” Junpei said.

“No way!” Yuuji replied. “One of you has to look out for Ino-san. If you guys encounter an enemy, then you’ll be at a disadvantage. It’s safer for you two to stay together!”

“And you think it’s better for you to go alone to the center of chaos?” Fushiguro demanded.

“But I’m not alone! I’ve got Mechamaru with me! And Sukuna!”

His friends didn’t look comforted by the mention of the King of Curses. Well, they would get over it. Yuuji knew many people didn’t trust Sukuna, but he believed his gut feeling. Anyway, he would be fine! After giving more reassurances to his friends, he finally managed to extricate himself from their worrying and continue his search for his teacher.

Things were going to shit! That was Nobara's only thought as she and Akari Nitta ran through Shoto Bunkamura Street in an attempt to meet with Ijichi. Itadori’s shouting had spread far and wide. With the strongest sorcerer down, their enemies would hunt them down even more ruthlessly. Fucking hell. Although she wanted to join the search to rescue Blindfold, they had to find Ijichi quickly since it was clear the man had been attacked while he was distracted.

As they ran through the empty street, they had the bad luck of encountering a familiar curse user. Oh. One of the infiltrators who had attacked them during the exchange event. Nobara grinned wildly. Good. Good. Back then, she couldn’t beat this guy since he had run away when the veil dropped. She ordered Nitta to run through Tokyu and check on Ijichi while she dealt with the curse user.

Seeing them whispering at each other, the curse user threw his strange hand-sword at her. Nobara deflected the attack with her hammer. Based on her knowledge, the man should be a mid-range fighter, so she quickly closed in to land a melee hit. Unfortunately, he was quicker and more nimble, dodging her attack.

Tch.

Nobara’s eyes widened when she saw the curse user chasing after Nitta. Bastard. She quickly pursued him, but she was too late. The manager had fallen to the ground, bleeding. Piece of shit. She wouldn’t hold back now.

Nobara pulled out three of her special-grade needles and blindly threw them at the enemy. The curse user easily dodged them, but that didn’t matter. However, before she could channel her cursed energy, the man somehow retrieved his sword, which fell straight into his hand.

To her surprise, the curse user landed a shallow cut on her left leg and then struck her straight on the chin. Fuck. A tricky cursed technique. The force of that strike rattled her brain, and her legs shook. The combination of his strange technique and moving cursed tool was making this fight annoying.

Nobara let herself fall to her knees and pretended to be weakened. As expected, the man began to gloat over her as he crouched down. Hah. Pathetic.

“You’ve gotten a lot stronger since I last met you,” the curse user said. “But it’s unfortunate that we don’t live in a world where you win just by being strong. Especially against my cursed technique.”

Nobara chuckled. “We’ll see about that.”

With a flick of her fingers, her needles began to fly and hone in on the man. Her strikes should’ve hit, but a weird series of events occurred. First, his sword was able to get in just in time to deflect one of her needles. The second one somehow missed. Before the third one could be wasted, Nobara summoned it back to her hand and threw it point-blank at the guy’s face.

Hairpin!

The resulting cursed energy explosion sent the guy several feet into the air. Nobara was about to grin at her victory, but she noticed how the man somehow quickly got back to his feet despite bleeding heavily. Weird. Then, another thing caught her attention; one of the markings on his cheek was gone. Hmm.

“So that’s your cursed technique,” Nobara said as she tried her best to get up. The hit from the cursed tool was still shaking up her brain. “You’ve been pretty lucky so far, huh? Too bad you met me.”

“You bitch!” the curse user screamed as his sword flew back to his hand.

Knowing she was facing a tricky opponent, Nobara pulled out more needles. This time, she had six of her cursed weapons flying.

“Unfortunately, your teacher can’t find a cursed weapon that fits your request,” Gojo said happily, two weeks after hearing her request.

“Ha!” Nobara was about to berate the man when he interrupted.

“However, I also know a great cursed weapon maker, and I asked her to make you this!” Gojo pulled out a long wooden box out of nowhere. Even with just her sight, it looked very expensive. “It has no name, so you can give it one. It’s basically a set of long needles made from a special material that can hold cursed energy for a long time. It hasn’t been imbued with cursed energy yet, and your job is to fill it with yours.”

“Sounds simple.” Nobara raised an eyebrow.

“You would think so, huh?” Gojo smiled impishly. “But it’s not that easy. If you want to infuse cursed energy into a weapon for a long time, you’ll need a ton of it. Most people generally need to use one weapon for many years before it can be considered a cursed tool. Of course, this is based on sorcerers using regular weapons. Items made specifically with special materials have an easier time retaining energy, but you still need to work hard to imprint your power into them.”

After spending so many days pouring her energy into using her cursed weapon, she could only activate six of her twelve needles. Even then, she could only keep them up for two minutes. Still, that should be enough to deal with this lowlife.

“Prepare to die!” Nobara said with a grin.

With her six needles flying wildly around the curse user, the man could only stay on the defensive. It was still annoying how many times he managed to avoid getting hit. His luck definitely had a limit, so Nobara only had to push him until that point. Keeping control of her six needles while launching her regular Hairpin was difficult. However, she wasn’t someone who was afraid of challenges.

“Hairpin!” With a strong hit from her hammer, she sent a nail flying straight at the curse user’s head. The man was able to dodge it at the last moment, but the nail struck the wall behind him, sending some rubble flying at him. Seeing her chance, Nobara focused her attention on her needles and ordered them to strike. Out of the six, only two managed to land, but the attack was enough to make the man cough up blood.

Another mark down.

“BITCH!” the curse user screamed.

Before he could retaliate, a hand caught him by the throat and lifted him up. Nobara was stunned at the sight of Nanami, who appeared out of nowhere. The usually calm man was looking very pissed off.

“Where and how many of you are there?” Nanami gritted out.

Yikes.

Nobara decided to sit this one out and examined the situation. Despite facing an angry sorcerer, the curse user still tried not to answer. Bad choice. Nanami punched the man straight into a pillar.

BAM!

Nobara winced.

Seeing the man still trying to get up, Nanami slowly stomped toward him. From behind, a familiar, ugly-looking sword flew toward the sorcerer. Not under her watch. Nobara sent another Hairpin and pinned the cursed tool to the wall.

“I ran into several dead assistant managers,” Nanami said as he lifted the man up for the second time. “That was you, correct?”

“I-I’m sorry!!!” the curse user pathetically pleaded for his life.

Nanami hit the man for a second time.

CRACK!

The curse user was sent straight into another wall, leaving a large crater behind him. This time, he didn’t get up. Oh wow. Nanami absolutely destroyed that guy. Nobara was very impressed with the Grade One sorcerer.

Yuuji’s journey toward Shibuya Station was surprisingly easy. Although he had seen a group of transfigured humans attacking civilians, he soon met Inumaki, who assured him that he would handle the situation. Trusting his senior, he quickly made his way down to the underground platforms.

His progress was halted when he encountered two familiar-looking curses standing before him. It was the two Death Painting brothers. Shit. The two curses also noticed him immediately the moment he landed on the floor.

Yuuji didn’t want to fight these guys. Although he was more confident in his abilities, he knew he would be at a disadvantage alone. He also had to prioritize finding his teacher over fighting curses. Still, he could only brace himself for a fight.

“Wait! Brother!” the human-looking curse said, raising his hands in a sign of non-threat.

“Huh?” Yuuji blinked.

“Brother! You’re our little brother!” the second curse added.

Yuuji could only gape at them. He was sure he was an only child and didn’t have two curses as brothers. “Um, sorry, I think you’ve mistaken me for someone else?”

“No, we do not! Our blood connects us, and we know who you are!” the first curse insisted, a big smile on his face. “We’re very sorry for attacking you back then. We didn’t know the truth! But now we’re here to help you!”

This situation reminded him too much of his first encounter with Todo. Considering the previous similar event, Yuuji still couldn’t believe their claims, but if they were going to help him, then that’s great! He needed all the help he could get to rescue Gojo. “I don’t get what you guys are saying, but I’m glad we don’t have to fight.” Yuuji put down his arms and slowly approached. “Do you guys know where Gojo-sensei is?”

The two brothers looked at each other before the older one said, “We do not, but we believe our eldest brother should be near him.”

“Yeah! Choso nii-chan is planning to help the sorcerers, so he will get your teacher out!” the younger one said.

Yuuji was quite dubious about the prospect of a curse saving the strongest sorcerer, but since they said they would help, he would take it. “Then, we should look for them.”

The two curses looked like they wanted to protest, but before they could continue their conversation, two more figures suddenly showed up. Their new visitors were two girls who looked to be in their teens.

“You!” One of them pointed her finger at Yuuji.

“Hmm?” Why did he get so popular all of a sudden?

The two brothers quickly turned toward the newcomers and protected Yuuji behind them. The teen blinked. He was sure the older one was self-conscious about his back, but this time, he willingly put the sorcerer behind him.

“Eso! Kechizu!” the other girl spoke. “Why are you speaking with a sorcerer?!”

“I can say the same to you,” Eso replied. “Why are you here? You two usually stick close to that man.”

“It’s none of your business!” the first girl said. “Now get out of our way. We have business with Sukuna’s vessel!”

“We won’t leave our younger brother!” Kechizu refused.

Yuuji felt uncomfortable being at the center of this weird tug-of-war between his supposed enemies. What the hell was going on? He just wanted to find his teacher… “Um, excuse me.” Four sharp gazes landed on him. Yuuji tried not to flinch. “Can’t we just talk this out quickly? I’m in a hurry here.”

The first girl quickly demanded, “We want to talk with Sukuna-sama!”

That was surprising. Most people wanted to avoid the King of Curses like the plague, but here he found two people actively seeking him out. The only other person who had done the same had been… Mahito. Yuuji narrowed his eyes. “What do you want with him?”

“Nothing that concerns you. Now go away and let the King of Curses out!” the first girl pointed her cellphone at Yuuji. He didn’t get it, but it was obviously connected to her cursed technique.

Eso and Kechizu also prepared themselves for a battle. Just when Yuuji thought a fight was unavoidable, a deep voice suddenly said, “What’s with the ruckus?”

Yuuji looked down to find one red eye and mouth manifested on his cheek. “Sukuna?”

“Why look so surprised, brat?” Sukuna said. He glanced up at him but soon locked his eye on the girls. “I heard someone calling my name, so I got curious.”

Despite the King of Curses only manifesting on the teen’s body, the other people in the room looked as tense as a bowstring. Yuuji didn’t quite get why Sukuna suddenly came out since he was usually hands-off until Yuuji called for him. Why would the curse be interested in speaking with these girls? Yuuji weakly protested, “We need to find Gojo-sensei.” He really didn’t want to waste more time talking when he could be looking for his teacher.

Sukuna rolled his eye. “I’ll keep it brief. Anyway, I believe you two have something that belongs to me.”

The girls became even stiffer when the King of Curses addressed them. “We…” After taking a deep breath, the light-haired one forced herself to take a step as she pulled out a cursed object tightly covered in seals from her pocket. “We have a request, oh King of Curses!”

Sukuna’s Finger!

Yuuji’s eyes widened when he saw the cursed object. He wanted to take it away from them, but he held himself back.

“A request?” Sukuna asked flatly.

The girl didn’t let her fear hold her back and kept speaking. “Down below, there is a man in a priest’s robe with stitches on his head. Please kill him… please free Master Geto.”

Stitches?

Yuuji’s mind flashed back to that old memory of his parents. Didn’t his mother also have stitches? He saw the two curses perk up at the mention of the man, but before he could ask them about it, the girl continued speaking.

“We know the location of another finger,” the teen added. “If you kill him, we’ll tell you where it is.”

The temperature in the room dropped sharply. Although he wasn’t a direct target, Yuuji could feel the dangerous aura emanating from Sukuna. It was like standing right beside a growling tiger that could slice you to bits with its deadly claws. “You think you can order me around, just for a finger or two?”

The two girls dropped to their feet from the pressure coming from the King of Curses. Beads of sweat began to pour down from their foreheads, and they had trouble breathing. The other curses in the room also struggled under the King of Curses’ pressure, to the point that Kechizu had to lean on Eso.

Yuuji pursed his lips. “Sukuna.”

The curse clicked his tongue and stopped intimidating everyone. Although the hint of danger was still there, it was no longer choking. “Fine. Just give the brat the finger and get out of my sight.”

“W-what about Master Geto’s body?” the girl stubbornly asked. Yuuji had to commend her bravery a bit. It was clear that this Geto was important to them, considering they even dared to make a deal with the King of Curses.

The red orb narrowed. “I’ll take care of that man.”

Under the sharp gaze of the King of Curses, the girl slowly approached Yuuji. With a trembling hand, she offered the sealed finger to the teen. He was about to unseal and eat the cursed object when Sukuna stopped him. “Hold on, brat. If you unseal that thing now, it will draw the attention of many curses. I don’t recommend doing it now. Just keep it in your pockets.”

Yuuji nodded and followed his instructions. “So, do you guys know where Gojo-sensei is?”

The girls shook their heads. This time, the black-haired teen replied, “We only saw the sorcerer teleporting away, and then the curses scattered to search for him. I doubt he’s been found yet.”

Yuuji sighed in relief. “Then we should find him quickly.” He had wasted enough time speaking here and needed to continue looking for his teacher. Being unable to use cursed energy while surrounded by curses was very dangerous.

“I don’t recommend you continue searching for that sorcerer, brat,” Sukuna cut in.

“Why?” Yuuji frowned. “You may not like him, but he’s important to me!”

Sukuna rolled his eye. “I never said I dislike that sorcerer, despite how annoying he is. However, I believe your search for him will only put more unnecessary attention on that man. There are several special grades roaming around, and I know you have other allies in Shibuya. Although they’re strong, I doubt any of them can handle those curses.”

The image of Nanami and his friends flashed through Yuuji’s mind. But… he also remembered Gojo. “But I can’t just abandon sensei!”

“You won’t,” Sukuna said. “Didn’t these two say their brother is searching for Gojo? Leave the task to him, and you should reconvene with your allies. Taking care of those special grades will also lower the chances of your teacher being killed.”

Yuuji bit his lip. He didn’t know what to choose. As a student, he wanted to look for his teacher, who had saved and sheltered him from harm. The man had been taking care of him these past months, and Yuuji wanted to repay the debt. How could he turn his back on him when Gojo needed him the most? However, Sukuna’s logic also made sense. Helping his allies would increase their chance of survival and winning, and it wasn’t as if he could defeat a special grade alone.

“Is your brother strong?” Yuuji asked Eso and Kechizu.

“Big brother is the best!” Kechizu replied with a big smile. It was quite touching how much faith he had in his brother, but that didn’t answer Yuuji’s question.

Eso added, “Our eldest brother is the strongest out of all of us. I believe sorcerers ranked him as a special grade.”

Yuuji looked at the two brothers, trying to gauge their sincerity. It didn’t seem like they were lying, and he wanted to trust them. He remembered Sukuna’s comment about a connection between their souls and could only sigh. “Fine, let’s go find the others.”

Omake:

Sukuna: *Hears the news from Mechamaru* What the fuck! This isn’t supposed to happen!

Sukuna: *Listens further* Goddamn it, Mechamaru, you almost gave me a heart attack!

Sukuna: Okay, this is a bit bad, but not as horrible as canon, so okay, I can fix this… I have to… *silently panics* You better stay alive, Gojo!!!

Sukuna: *Hears Yuuji yelling* OMG! I know the situation is not good, but this is still funny! HAHAHAHA! 

Sukuna: *Watches Yuuji and the brothers interact* Oh wow, it’s a family reunion.

Sukuna: *Sees Mimiko and Nanako* What do we have here?

 

Satoru: WeeWoo WeeWoo WeeWoo!

Choso: Where the hell are you, Gojo!!!

Kenjaku: Things are getting out of control, but it's fine. There's still Sukuna.

 

Nobara: Nanami is so cool.

Junpei & Megumi: You better not die Yuuji/Itadori!

Yuuji: I want to find sensei!
Notes:

    Yeah, sorry, I can’t find a reasonable way to save Mechamaru. First, he already has a Binding Vow with Mahito, so he won’t see a point in contacting Sukuna even when he knows about soul healing. I doubt Mechamaru wants to enter another Binding Vow with another curse. Second, he can’t speak with Sukuna without alerting Yuuji or Gojo. He’s still a traitor even if he plans to spill about the plan to the sorcerers afterward. Unfortunately, his position is too awkward for me to save him.

    Also, how many of you are surprised by that plot twist? LOL. Didn’t I say that I won’t make it easy? Kenjaku has some other tricks up his sleeves. He’ll be severely outmatched in this fic, but he won’t go down easily.

    So SIkuna isn’t very fond of Mimiko and Nanako since they take advantage of Yuuji in Canon. He doesn’t hate them, but he doesn’t care if they live or die. Also, those two definitely wanted to get a Binding Vow, but they didn’t dare to demand more from the King of Curses.

Chapter Text

If Satoru somehow survived this, he was going to celebrate with a dozen cakes and mochi. Being without cursed energy was bad enough, but without Infinity’s protection, he felt practically naked despite being fully clothed. Fortunately, he still had his Six Eyes. He couldn’t use his cursed technique, but he could still sense the presence of curses and enemies. That was enough to let him slowly navigate his way out of the station.

The cursed tool sealing his cursed energy had an unexpected side effect: it also suppressed his presence. As long as he stayed at a distance from the cursed spirits, he could slip past them undetected. Still, it was frustratingly slow going. He had to dart between hiding spots, constantly on edge. He could handle transfigured humans if he had to, but the last thing he wanted was to draw more attention to himself.

He was almost at the stairwell when he sensed it, a special grade. Immediately, he ducked into a nearby restroom.

Goddamn. At this rate, he was going to turn into Hanako-san.

Unfortunately, he was so focused on the special grade that he didn’t notice the transfigured human already lurking in the stall. The creature didn’t take kindly to his intrusion and lunged. Without his technique, all Satoru had was his fists and the cursed tool. He struck hard and fast, driving the blade into the thing’s eye with precision. It pierced through its skull, but not before it convulsed violently, thrashing and making enough noise to wake the whole station.

And it did.

Satoru barely had time to turn before he felt it: the special grade’s gaze. A Death Painting.

He didn’t hesitate. Even outmatched, he wasn’t going down without a fight. The curse dodged his first strike, it was fast but unpolished. New to combat, probably. No surprise, considering it had spent years sealed in a jar.

"Wait!" the curse called out.

Satoru didn’t care. They exchanged blows, the curse still trying to speak between dodges. But the difference in stamina was obvious. Satoru was already wounded, his cursed energy sealed, while his opponent had no such limitations.

After a minute of scuffling, the curse knocked the weapon from Satoru’s hand. Just as he raised his fist to strike again, the Death Painting said:

"I’m your ally."

Normally, Satoru wouldn’t give a damn what a curse had to say. But right now? Exhausted, cornered, and bleeding, he hesitated. "...What?"

"I’m not your enemy," the curse said. "I’m here to help you escape."

"Ha? Yeah, forgive me if I’m a little skeptical," Satoru snapped. "Didn’t you just try to kill me with your fellow curses?"

"I was under duress," the curse said calmly. "If I didn’t obey Noritoshi’s orders, he’d hurt my brothers."

Noritoshi?

He couldn’t mean the Kyoto kid. Satoru narrowed his eyes. "Are you saying..."

The curse nodded. "The one controlling your friend’s body, the fake Geto, his real name is Kamo Noritoshi. I recognized the stitches on his forehead. Same as my father’s."

Of course. Kenjaku. That bastard had to be involved. Satoru had always known he was a plague on the Jujutsu world, but he hadn’t realized just how deep it went. The original Kamo Noritoshi might’ve been scum, but having your corpse hijacked by Kenjaku? That was another level of violation.

"So what, this is a family spat?" Satoru said with a smirk. "That’s cute, but it’s not exactly enough to make you side with a sorcerer."

"True," the Death Painting agreed. "I don’t particularly care for humans. But you’re my younger brother’s teacher. So I have to help you."

That made Satoru pause. "Younger brother? I don’t remember any of my students being a Death Painting."

The curse continued. "Itadori Yuuji is my youngest sibling."

Satoru’s eyes narrowed. "Bullshit." Yuuji was human. His Six Eyes had confirmed that from day one.

"He is," the curse said. "But he’s also Kamo Noritoshi’s son. I suspect his ability to suppress Sukuna is linked to that."

"And how the hell would you know that?"

"Our blood. My brothers fought Yuuji once, when they were ordered to retrieve one of Sukuna’s fingers. Their techniques mixed with his blood during that battle. A connection formed."

It sounded insane. But Satoru knew better than most that blood techniques could reveal things normal sorcerers couldn’t perceive. And the Death Paintings were created by the Kamo clan’s cursed technique.

He was about to press for more details when a memory surfaced:

“Worry not, the brat is one of a kind. I doubt anyone else could suppress me like that. A very rare constitution, or perhaps…”

Sukuna had known?

If that was true… then Kenjaku had been setting this up since the beginning. Was that why Sukuna turned on him? Satoru scowled.

"I know you have questions," the curse cut in, "but we’re out of time. The other special grades are still hunting you and Yuuji. We need to get you both to safety."

"And why do you care about me?" Satoru asked. "Yuuji’s your brother, sure. But I was your enemy a few minutes ago."

The curse hesitated, then said, "Because you matter to him. I’ve seen how he talks about you. If you die, he’ll suffer. And..." He looked away. "I have a selfish reason too."

Satoru tilted his head. "Now we’re getting somewhere."

"In exchange for helping you, I want the sorcerers to release my brothers, the ones still locked in storage. And I want a guarantee that we won’t be hunted. All we ask is to live in peace. We won’t harm any humans who don’t mean us harm."

It was... reasonable. Which made it all the more suspicious.

Satoru squinted at him. "I still don’t trust you."

"You don’t have to," the curse replied. "Just don’t die. That’s enough for now."

Satoru exhaled, rubbing at the blood on his temple. "Fine," he muttered. "But I’m watching you."

When Yuuji decided to search for his allies, Eso and Kechizu insisted on tagging along. The two girls, on the other hand, chose to part ways. Now that they'd secured Sukuna’s promise, it was clear they had no desire to linger near the King of Curses.

Sukuna directed Yuuji toward the Inokashira Line, believing another special grade was lurking there. They ran into some transfigured humans along the way but thankfully no curse users or powerful spirits.

As they neared Avenue Gate, the sharp sound of shattering glass echoed down the tunnel. At the same time, a wave of cursed energy hit Yuuji like a punch to the chest.

There was definitely a battle happening nearby.

Without hesitation, Yuuji broke into a sprint. He arrived just in time to see a special grade curse, one he vaguely recognized, engulfing a sorcerer in flames. His eyes dropped to the ground and caught sight of two bodies. It took a second for the recognition to hit.

Nanami.

Maki.

Yuuji’s heart plummeted.

No. No, no, no.

Were they dead? Had he come too late?

He wanted to rush to their side, but a powerful curse stood in the way.

The special grade finally turned, its wide eye narrowing when it noticed Eso and Kechizu behind Yuuji. “Why are you two with Sukuna’s vessel?”

Yuuji didn’t respond. He couldn’t. His mind was stuck on the broken bodies of his allies. Ieri had set up a triage zone on the Metropolitan Expressway, but there was no way he could carry three injured people out of here, especially not with a special grade in the way.

If Gojo were here at full power, this wouldn’t even be a problem. But Gojo’s cursed energy was still sealed.

While the curses exchanged words, Yuuji stayed focused on his allies. On the impossible weight building in his chest.

Eventually, the special grade turned to him. “Sukuna’s vessel. We meet again.”

Yuuji scowled. A petty part of him regretted stopping Gojo from turning this thing into paste the first time they met. “What do you want?”

“Simple,” the curse said, gesturing lazily toward Nanami. “You want to save your comrades, don’t you? Then let the King of Curses take over and make a Binding Vow.”

Yuuji’s fists clenched. So that was the plan. It wasn’t just about Gojo. They wanted Sukuna out. Did they really believe the King of Curses would play lapdog and do their bidding?

The curse tilted its head mockingly. “Why hesitate? If you wait too long, they’ll die.”

Yuuji’s rage boiled over. He wanted nothing more than to crush that smug look, tear this thing apart and erase it from existence. How dare it hurt Nanami and Maki?

“Brat,” Sukuna’s voice cut in smoothly, cold and composed. “This isn’t the time to lose your head. Bitter though it may be, you can’t win against this curse.”

“What do you expect me to do?!” Yuuji snapped inwardly.

“Let me out,” Sukuna answered.

Yuuji stilled.

Was this a trap? Was Sukuna trying to work with the enemy? Had this all been a setup to push Yuuji into a corner where giving up control was his only option?

“Tch. You’re spiraling,” Sukuna muttered. A hot presence pressed against Yuuji’s soul, grounding him. “Didn’t you say you trust me? Prove it.”

Yeah. He had said that. But right now, everything felt wrong. The special grade was waiting. Watching. Yuuji didn’t want it to speak with Sukuna. He didn’t know why, but some deep instinct warned him against it.

Still, he couldn’t deny the truth. He couldn’t win this fight alone. And if there was even a chance to save his friends…

“Okay,” Yuuji said, eyes hardening. “Let’s make another Binding Vow.”

He couldn’t see Sukuna, but he felt the grin.

“Good. How about this. I’ll do my best to heal those three sorcerers, and in return, you’ll let me take over for ten minutes. I want to deal with this special grade myself.”

It sounded a lot like their first deal, which caught Yuuji off guard. “That’s it? Don’t you want to ask for something bigger?”

“What? You’re not happy I’m being generous?” Sukuna shot back.

Yuuji cracked a small smile. “Nah. Thanks, Sukuna. I accept.”

A sound like chains echoed through their souls.

Jogo wasn’t sure if his threat had worked, but he had no choice but to wait. Sukuna’s vessel hadn’t responded for some time, though the boy’s face kept shifting, brows furrowed, lips pressed tight, then suddenly a smile. What?

Before Jogo could process it, the pressure in the air multiplied tenfold. It felt like an invisible mountain had slammed down on their shoulders. An overwhelming aura of death and malice exploded from the teenager’s body, dark markings blooming across his skin.

Jogo let out a shaky grin.

He did it.

Four red eyes snapped open and locked onto him, pinning Jogo in place like a nailed specimen. The two other curses trailing behind the boy froze instantly.

Sukuna raised his hand and casually combed his fingers through his hair. “You’re holding your head a little too high, don’t you think?”

Jogo barely had time to drop to one knee before a slash whipped through the air, shearing off the top of his head. Blood poured down his face as he trembled, breath shallow. The two Death Paintings didn’t even hesitate. They threw themselves into a full dogeza.

“You thought kneeling on one knee was enough?” Sukuna said, smiling sharply. Jogo didn’t dare to move. Should he follow suit and bow deeper, or would that only insult the King of Curses further?

Luckily for him, Sukuna turned away.

He walked to the first fallen sorcerer, the man Jogo had burned, and crouched beside him. Gently, Sukuna placed a hand on his chest. Cursed energy surged, and within a breath, the burns melted away. The man stirred, brow twitching, and opened his eyes. He flinched hard when he saw who was looming above him, but wisely stayed still.

The Binding Vow must have been genuine. Sukuna had promised to heal the sorcerers in exchange for control. Now that one was healed, the vow was technically fulfilled. He could kill them without breaking his word. And yet he didn’t.

Sukuna rose and approached the next one, the younger female student. She, too, was healed with a touch. And like the first, she froze in place when she realized who was standing over her.

Then came the third sorcerer.

Sukuna’s expression darkened as he stared at the older man. “Do I have to heal this one?” he muttered. Then, his brow furrowed, as if someone was speaking to him.

Was the vessel still conscious?

“Fine, but don’t come crying to me later, brat.” This time, he didn’t bother with gentle contact. Sukuna stomped his foot on the man’s chest and shoved cursed energy into his body. The burns vanished and the man’s missing limb regrew, restored in an instant.

Clicking his tongue in annoyance, Sukuna stood tall and turned back to Jogo. His steps were unhurried, yet each one echoed like a hammer strike in the silence.

“You have something of mine, don’t you?”

Jogo understood instantly and fumbled to present the collection of Sukuna’s fingers. The King of Curses accepted the offering without a word, plucking one from the pile and swallowing it.

The tension spiked.

With each finger he consumed, the air grew heavier, nearly unbreathable. The Death Paintings and even the sorcerers dared not speak. None of them wanted to draw attention.

After finishing the entire bundle and even pulling out an extra finger from his own pocket, Sukuna let out a pleased sigh.

“You’ve been hunting these down for quite a while, haven’t you?” he said. “Since you’ve gone through the trouble of bringing them to me, I’ll let you speak.”

“I-I have nothing to ask,” Jogo stammered.

Sukuna raised an eyebrow. “Really?”

“Our objective is to revive you,” Jogo explained quickly. “I don’t know what deal you’ve made with Itadori, but now’s the perfect time to force control permanently!”

Behind them, the sorcerers were beginning to stir, pushing themselves up slowly. Jogo kept one eye on them. He didn’t know why Sukuna hadn’t killed them after healing them, but he wouldn’t let them interfere now.

“Shibuya’s crawling with the vessel’s allies,” Jogo pressed. “Use them as leverage. You could take over for good!”

Sukuna’s gaze dropped to him again. “No need.”

Jogo blinked. “What?”

“You cursed spirits are truly desperate,” Sukuna said, amused. “Tell you what. Let’s play a little game. If you can land even one hit on me, I’ll grant you a wish.”

Jogo froze. It was a trap. He knew it. With all those fingers absorbed, Sukuna had regained at least fifteen of his original powers. Jogo didn’t stand a chance. But the goal wasn’t to win. He only had to land a single blow.

A flicker of determination sparked in his eyes.

“It’s a deal.”

Sukuna grinned.

In that instant, Sukuna’s cursed energy flared like a supernova, its sheer magnitude radiating across Shibuya. Sorcerers, Curse Users, Cursed Spirits, everyone looked up, instinctively drawn to the sky where two special-grade monsters clashed midair.

Jogo gave it everything he had. Flames surged from his hands, scorching the air, but Sukuna danced through the inferno with ease, as if swatting at candlelight. Each time Jogo attempted a strike, he was either disarmed literally or simply outmaneuvered. The cursed spirit found himself flailing through the sky, chasing shadows, always a step behind.

While Jogo fought tooth and nail just to stay in the game, Sukuna wasn’t even looking at him most of the time. His attention drifted down to Shibuya’s streets, to the humans scattered below. He didn’t particularly care about them, but it wouldn’t do to have the kid crying in his head over civilian deaths.

So, with a mental sigh, Sukuna adjusted the rules.

He steered their battle into abandoned buildings and cleared zones, swatting Jogo away any time his attacks strayed too close to bystanders. More than once, he severed the cursed spirit’s arms mid-cast, stopping an explosion before it could detonate over a crowd. The added challenge, fighting with restraint, only made the game more interesting.

Jogo never stood a real chance against Sukuna, now operating at three-quarters of his full power. But having to play around those invisible constraints forced the King of Curses to get creative.

Still, every game has its end.

Sukuna twisted midair and slammed a brutal kick into Jogo’s gut, sending the cursed spirit hurtling higher into the sky. Hopefully, that would give him no time to activate the molten barrage that had already wiped out buildings before. Jogo screamed, pained but stubborn, and somehow gathered the strength to summon one final attack.

"Maximum: Meteor!"

A massive flaming boulder materialized in the sky, glowing like a second sun. Its searing light painted Shibuya in hues of red and gold, as if sunset had come early, only this sunset promised devastation.

Sukuna tilted his head, intrigued. If that thing landed, it would erase a quarter of the city. Below, within the recesses of his own mind, Yuuji stirred, wide awake and struggling against the Binding Vow. He could feel the panic clawing at the boy’s heart.

The King of Curses sent him a silent pat on the head, half-amused.

Settle down, brat. I’ve got this.

On one of Shibuya’s shattered roads, Kusakabe and Panda stood frozen, their gazes locked on the sky above as a burning meteor blazed its way toward the city. For a moment, all thoughts of battle vanished. Curse users and sorcerers alike stared in stunned silence at the apocalyptic sight.

“Shit! We have to run now!” Kusakabe yelled, snapping out of it first.

“Can we even outrun that?!” Panda shouted back, panic creeping into his voice.

His eyes flicked to the figure facing down the falling inferno. It was Itadori. Or at least, it looked like him. But the aura radiating from the boy’s body was wrong, completely wrong. Gone was the warmth and sunlight Panda associated with Yuuji. In its place was something heavy and suffocating, thick with malice and death. It clawed at the air, weighing down on everything around it.

That wasn’t Yuuji anymore.

“That’s... Sukuna?!” Panda’s voice cracked in disbelief. How did he get out?!

Back at Avenue Gate, Maki, Nanami, and Naobito stood amid the wreckage, forced to bear witness to the chaos spiraling out of control. The two Death Paintings had fled, but none of the sorcerers had the strength or will to chase them. After all, the King of Curses had just hurled a special grade like a broken doll and leapt out of the building in pursuit, laughing like it was a game.

Maki didn’t know how the hell they’d managed to survive three back-to-back encounters with special-grade curses. Her wounds still burned from the fire spirit's attack, but if she had to choose, she'd face that bastard again a hundred times over before going up against Sukuna. There was something fundamentally wrong about him, like staring into the abyss and realizing it’s smiling back.

As she watched Sukuna toy with a special grade like it was nothing, one question kept circling in her mind: How the hell did Itadori keep something like that buried inside him?

“We should’ve killed that brat when we had the chance,” Naobito muttered darkly.

“That brat just saved your life,” Nanami snapped, tone sharper than usual. He looked rattled, more than she’d ever seen him. Maki remembered he'd gone on missions with the first-years. He’d seen Yuuji up close, trained with him. Of course he was shaken. Watching Sukuna take the reins must’ve felt like watching a student get devoured from the inside.

“And now look at where we are.” Naobito scowled. “We’re trapped. The strongest is sealed. And that thing is walking free. No one’s getting out of Shibuya alive.”

The words rang true, no matter how much they stung.

Maki didn’t respond. What could she say? She just stared at the battlefield far beyond their reach, fists clenched, silently praying that Itadori would come back before there was nothing left to save.

Satoru had been trailing the Death Painting out of Shibuya Station when a surge of malevolent energy suddenly spiked in the distance. It hit him like a wave, sharp, suffocating, and horribly familiar. A split second later, the ground rumbled beneath his feet, tremors rolling through the station like a warning bell.

Even without his cursed energy, even with his Six Eyes dulled, he could still recognize those two distinct auras clashing in the distance.

Sukuna. And Baldy.

“Shit! We have to find Yuuji now!” Satoru barked, already moving.

“What?” the curse following him blinked in confusion but didn’t hesitate to chase after him.

“I don’t know what the hell happened, but that idiot kid just let Sukuna out!” Satoru growled as he sprinted through the corridor. “He’s fighting Baldy right now, and if we don’t stop them—”

Another tremor shook the walls.

“A lot of people are going to die.”

They both knew the truth. In their current state, they wouldn’t stand a chance against Sukuna. Not even close. But that didn’t matter.

They ran anyway, toward the epicenter, toward the storm, because if they didn’t, no one else would make it in time.

Sukuna raised a hand and murmured, "Furnace, open."

A spark ignited in his palm then bloomed into a roiling ember, divine flame unfurling like a living thing. As the meteor hurtled closer, blazing through the sky like a herald of destruction, Sukuna barely spared it a glance. Instead, he let his cursed energy swirl, amused by Yuuji’s sudden spike of attention from the depths of his mind.

"Curious, brat?" he asked idly, a grin playing on his lips.

With deliberate motion, he mimed drawing a bow. The string was invisible, formed from concentrated heat and cursed power. The arrow formed at the tips of his middle and forefingers, an ember-sharp point pulsing with concentrated Divine Flame. He aimed it upward, straight at Jogo. The fire curse’s remaining eye bulged in panic.

TWISH!

The arrow shot forth, screaming through the air. Midway to its target, it split apart and bloomed like a lotus made of hellfire. The petals of flame unfurled in the sky and collided with the incoming meteor. For a heartbeat, the heavens were consumed by fire. Light exploded outward, bright as a second sun, turning Shibuya’s night into a white-hot blaze of day. And then silence.

When the light faded, the meteor was gone. So was Jogo. Not a single cinder remained of the special-grade curse.

Before the heat could settle, another presence landed behind Sukuna. He didn’t turn at first, just flicked his eyes back lazily.

A figure knelt behind him: white-haired, dressed in a plain monk’s robe, head bowed in reverence.

“I’ve come to welcome you, Sukuna-sama,” they said.

“Uraume,” Sukuna replied, finally turning fully to face his most loyal follower. Yuuji stirred again at the back of his mind, drawn to the unfamiliar voice, but Sukuna paid him no mind. He had more pressing matters.

“There’s been a change of plans.”

Uraume’s expression didn’t shift, but their pupils constricted slightly, just enough to betray surprise.

“I’m no longer interested in Kenjaku’s little games,” Sukuna said. “Watch him. Make sure he doesn’t leave Shibuya. I’ll end this farce tonight.”

Uraume hesitated for only a breath before bowing lower.

“As you wish.”

Sukuna regarded them for a moment longer, eyes glinting with warning.

"Make sure he doesn’t suspect a thing," he said coolly.

"Yes, Sukuna-sama," Uraume answered without a hint of hesitation.

Omake:

Sukuna: *Sees Nanami and Maki burned to crisp* Shit! We’re still too late! But at least Junpei is not here. He’s with Megumi, right?

Sukuna: *Looks at Naobito* Do I really have to save this guy? This piece of shit? *Accidentally regrows the hand* Ack! I shouldn’t have done that!

Sukuna: *Fighting Jogo* Man, this is fun! I can see why OG Sukuna loves fighting so much! But I gotta make sure nobody gets hurt. Dang.

Sukuna: *Sees Uraume* Finally shows up, huh? Well, you’re still useful, so I’ll let you live.




Satoru: Yuuuuji!!!!

Choso: Wait for your onii-chan, Yuuuuji!!!

Panda & Kusakabe: We're so dead.

Maki: Goddamn. How did I survive that?
Notes:

    The manga never explains Six Eyes much, so I’m gonna assume it’s a passive skill that lets Gojo perceive the world in different ways, even without cursed energy. Also, I’ve never been to Shibuya so excuse me if my description is weird and doesn’t make sense lol.

    Again, I don’t know how exactly the OG Divine Flame works, but this is how it works here! I mean, I already read the chapter, but Sukuna’s power is extremely confusing, especially after all of those Binding Vows. XD

Chapter 17
Notes:

    I have to edit this chapter because Gege released that unexpected detail in Volume 29. Apparently, Wasuke is Sukuna's incarnation and not Jin. Goddamn cat.

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)
Chapter Text

After giving his orders to Uraume, Sukuna turned away and headed in the direction where Megumi and Junpei should be. He hadn’t sensed Mahoraga’s presence yet, which was a relief. There was no way he could deal with that shikigami without leveling half the city. The beast required a Domain Expansion to take down, something that would turn this timeline into a repeat of the original Shibuya incident. He wasn’t about to let that happen.

Perched atop a massive billboard, Sukuna glanced down and spotted Junpei and Megumi squaring off against Shigemo. Both looked exhausted, their clothes torn and movements sluggish, but they were still standing, far better off than in the original timeline. Good. As long as Megumi didn’t get pushed too far, Mahoraga would stay sealed. Sukuna didn’t need another headache right now.

Just as he considered stepping in, two familiar figures sprinted into the fray: Gojo and Choso.

A wild grin spread across Sukuna’s face.

Yuuji stirred at the sight, his spirit perking up at the reassurance that his teacher was alive.

Well then. No need to linger here. Time to deal with the next problem child.

Sukuna cast one last look at the strongest sorcerer before leaping away, toward the final special-grade cursed spirit still hiding in Shibuya.

Satoru was headed toward Sukuna’s last known location when he spotted Megumi and Junpei locked in combat with a curse user. His eyes narrowed. He recognized that face; it belonged to one of the lowlifes who ambushed them during the Kyoto exchange event. The man was weak, laughably so, but his cursed technique must have some trick to it if he was still alive.

Satoru doubted this guy could take down either of his students in a fair fight, but judging by their ragged states, it was clear they'd already been through hell. He was about to intervene when his Six Eyes flickered. Sukuna’s presence flared just overhead.

The King of Curses stood atop a billboard, casually watching the fight below. Even from a distance, Satoru could make out the look on his face. Those red eyes locked onto him. Sukuna’s lips curled into a feral grin.

Shit.

Was he coming down to fight?

Satoru braced himself, tense. With his cursed energy sealed, there was no way he could take on Sukuna right now. But instead of attacking, the curse king turned and leapt away, heading elsewhere.

What the hell?

No time to wonder. His students needed help first. Before he could move, Choso launched a projectile of blood at the curse user.

SPLASH!

It should’ve been fatal, but the man somehow survived. Satoru noticed the markings on the curse user’s cheeks fade. So that was it. A one-time defensive technique. Without hesitation, Satoru closed the distance and disarmed the man. He retrieved the remains of a cursed tool. Its sealing effect was spent, but it could still serve as a weapon.

Without ceremony, he plunged the broken blade into the man’s skull. The curse user’s eyes went wide with disbelief before his body crumpled.

Satoru watched him fall, then turned to his students, who stared with wide eyes and slack jaws.

"Sensei!" Megumi and Junpei shouted in unison.

“Yo! Megumi-kun, Junpei-kun!” Satoru waved with a grin and a peace sign. “You two looked like you were struggling, so your amazing teacher stepped in. But seriously, he was that weak and you still couldn’t take him down? I’m bumping your training.”

Megumi scowled. “Shut up! We just survived a fight against a monster!”

“That’s right!” Junpei added. “The guy was insanely strong, way more than Yuuji or even Maki-senpai.”

Satoru raised a brow. Another Heavenly Restricted type?

Junpei frowned thoughtfully. “Now that I think about it, he looked a lot like Megumi.”

“I doubt I’m that unique,” Megumi deadpanned. “More importantly, I’m pretty sure he was a summon. After he died, his face changed into the grandson’s, the one we saw at Shibuya Tower.”

Satoru’s eyes narrowed. That confirmed it. But before he could dig deeper, two more presences came rushing toward them.

“Choso nii-chan!”

“Eso! Kechizu!” Choso called back, rushing to meet his brothers.

The sorcerers stood frozen as the three Death Paintings shared a joyful reunion. Eventually, Megumi muttered, "...Is he on our side?"

“I guess you could say that,” Satoru replied, scratching his head. “Choso says he’s Yuuji’s older brother.”

“What?!” Megumi and Junpei exclaimed.

“It’s complicated,” Satoru said with a shrug. “I’ll explain later.”

Once Choso confirmed his brothers were unharmed, he asked, “Where’s Yuuji? Weren’t you helping him?”

“We did!” Kechizu said. “We ran into him early on, then some girls, but we ended up looking for other sorcerers instead of heading deeper.”

“We found three. Two men and a young woman, all badly hurt by Jogo,” Eso added.

Megumi’s eyes widened. “Nanami-san? Maki-senpai?!”

“One of the men had light hair,” Eso confirmed. Megumi and Junpei went pale. Satoru’s heart skipped a beat. “Jogo was still there. He forced Yuuji to give control to Sukuna so the King of Curses could save them.”

“And Sukuna did,” Satoru muttered. So that explained it. “What was the Binding Vow?”

“I don’t know,” Eso said, frowning. “They spoke only in their minds. But the King of Curses came out and saved the sorcerers.”

“In seconds!” Kechizu said, awed.

The sorcerers were relieved but uneasy. Sukuna had helped, but why? And for how long?

“And then?” Satoru prompted.

Eso looked reluctant. “Jogo gave him all the Fingers they had.”

Satoru stiffened. “How many?”

“About ten,” Eso said.

Ten. Combined with what Yuuji had before, that put Sukuna well past the halfway point.

“Where is he now?” Junpei asked.

“He was right there a second ago,” Satoru said, pointing at the billboard. The group turned to him with disbelieving stares.

“You didn’t tell us?!” Megumi grabbed Satoru by the collar.

Satoru didn’t flinch. He just patted the boy’s head gently. The kid was clearly rattled. He let go with a scowl and swatted the hand away.

“Relax, Megumi,” Satoru said. “He left the moment he saw me. Guess he’s still scared of little ol’ me.” They all shot him unimpressed looks.

“Probably going after Kenjaku or the other special grades,” he added.

“We already took down the ocean-themed one with Nanami-san,” Junpei said.

“Dagon,” Choso confirmed.

“And I dealt with Weed,” Satoru said. “Sukuna just took out Baldy, so that leaves Patch Face.”

“Mahito,” Choso growled. “He’s the most dangerous.”

“Yeah, but not stronger than Sukuna,” Satoru replied. “If the King of Curses wants to erase that freak, I won’t complain.”

“What now?” Megumi asked.

“You two are heading back to Shoko to get healed,” Satoru said. “No arguing.”

Megumi and Junpei looked ready to protest, but one sharp glance from Satoru shut them up.

“You’ll just be liabilities out here. Go report to Principal Yaga.”

“What about you, sensei?” Junpei asked. “You’re still powerless.”

“Well, your teacher’s going to find Yuuji,” Satoru said cheerfully. Before they could point out the hypocrisy, he raised a finger. “And I’m not going alone. I’ve got my trusty special grade bodyguard right here.”

Choso stared at him blankly but didn’t protest.

“Eso, Kechizu, you two go with them. Make sure they get to Shoko safely.”

The Death Paintings nodded. Satoru was pretty sure they wouldn’t pull anything at this point.

As the students reluctantly headed off, casting him dark looks over their shoulders, Satoru turned to Choso. The two prepared to continue the chase to find Yuuji and figure out just what kind of deal he’d made with Sukuna.

"Ah man, how did it come to this?" Mahito thought, clicking his tongue.

He’d been planning to hunt down Yuuji, settle things on his own terms. But of course, the universe had other ideas. Yuuji found him first.

Well, technically, it was the King of Curses.

Mahito had sensed Sukuna’s presence once before during their first encounter. But sensing him and facing him in person were two very different things. The raw pressure that radiated from the curse now was nothing like before. He’d gotten stronger, much stronger.

So Jogo really did it, huh? Delivered the Fingers straight to the King. And then promptly died for it. Heh.

Not that Mahito cared. Honestly, it was kind of funny. He wondered what Jogo's final thought had been as he got exorcised by the very being he worshipped. Probably something pathetic. "This is all part of the grand plan for the age of curses..." or some other sanctimonious crap.

“Yo,” Sukuna said, eyes narrowed just slightly.

Mahito’s grin didn’t falter. “You gonna kill me next?”

“I plan to,” Sukuna replied evenly. “But the brat wants to fight you first, so…”

And just like that, the King stepped back. Or rather, Yuuji stepped forward.

The boy’s soul flared like a supernova, blazing with intent. Even before Sukuna’s black markings had fully receded, Yuuji surged forward, fists clenched and ready to strike.

Tch. No hesitation.

Mahito flung one of his mini transfigured humans forward as a distraction, but the boy dodged with ease. A moment later, Mahito used Soul Multiplicity: Body Repel, creating a split-second opening to close the gap and slam a bladed hand at Yuuji’s face.

Direct hit. But no crunch, no satisfying crack of bone. He hadn’t put enough force behind it to split the boy’s skull.

'Damn. This is going to be harder than expected.'

With Sukuna watching and clearly itching to intervene, Mahito knew he had to end this quickly. One clean blow. He had to kill Yuuji before the King of Curses got bored and jumped back in. And he couldn’t use Idle Transfiguration. That was the one line he couldn’t cross. Not unless he wanted to die instantly.

So he needed to rely on brute force, pure unrelenting strength. Stabilize his soul shape and ram his hand through the brat’s heart.

Easier said than done.

Despite all that confidence, Mahito found himself on the backfoot more than once. Yuuji landed two clean hits, hard ones. They crashed through the Dogenzaka Ticket Gate, turning the station into their battlefield. Metal railings, turnstiles, concrete pillars. They used everything around them to their advantage.

Fighting without his best move was a pain. But Yuuji’s physical abilities were nothing to scoff at. He was fast. Strong. Focused.

Still, Mahito smirked.

This was fine. The boy's heart was fragile. All he had to do was hit the right nerve. Break his resolve. And the fight would be over.

He got his chance when two civilians wandered into the fray, foolish, doomed sacrifices. Perfect. Mahito used them like props, taunting the boy, poking at his weakness.

'Too easy. You’re still the same, Yuuji. Always shaking for someone else’s pain.'

The boy wore his empathy like armor, but it cracked under pressure. If Mahito could just shatter it completely…

And of course, the human didn’t know about his trump card, his clone.

The clone couldn’t use Idle Transfiguration, but it didn’t need to. It was fast, strong, and clever enough to give him an edge.

And if fate was really on his side?

Mahito smiled.

Just outside the station, he ran into another sorcerer.

Perfect.

Nobara hated being told to sit still especially when her friends were in danger. As soon as she got the assistant manager to safety, she took off to find her teammates and teacher.

Naturally, that led her straight into another mess.

Patch-Face.

Shit.

Unlike Itadori, she didn’t have a demon babysitting her soul. One wrong touch, and she was done for. Still, she wasn’t completely outmatched. If she kept her distance, Resonance could do the job. Her cursed energy had recovered just enough, and she still had her Nails, plenty of ways to keep the bastard back.

The fight was tough, though. The curse was slippery, constantly shifting form. She took a few cuts, nothing serious but it was clear this wouldn’t be easy. After dodging and trading blows for about a minute, she finally saw an opening and slammed Resonance right into its forehead.

TWANG!

But instead of detonating on impact, her cursed energy flared somewhere else entirely.

A double.

Nobara grinned. “You’re a clone, huh?”

“Correct!” the special grade chirped, weirdly pleased. Then, instead of retaliating, it turned and ran.

Nobara sprinted after it, though a creeping sense of unease tugged at her spine. She didn’t know Shibuya Station like the back of her hand, but something about this route felt deliberate.

'Trying to lead me to the real one?' she thought. 'Fine. I’ll deal with him directly.'

She pulled out every Nail she had and launched them upward. If she kept her cursed energy low, maybe Patch-Face wouldn’t notice them in the chaos. She rounded the corner

and froze as two figures came barreling toward her.

Another Mahito. And Itadori.

“Kugisaki! Run!” Yuuji yelled.

Fuck.

The real Mahito lunged. Nobara didn’t have time to dodge. She was too close. But just before impact, her Nails rained down like iron lightning, one of them striking true with Hairpin. The curse flinched just long enough for her to dive behind Yuuji, who had just finished off the clone.

“Kugisaki!” he turned toward her, panic etched all over his face.

She smacked his shoulder. “I’m fine! Eyes on the enemy, idiot!”

This was bad. With Mahito in front of them, Yuuji couldn’t go all out not when Nobara was a liability. Her Nails were almost out of juice too. She’d only have enough for one more technique, if that. Being the weak link in a fight like this made her stomach twist.

But they had no choice. The fight raged on. Mahito kept pressing her, trying to force an opening. She was fast, but not fast enough, not forever. They were pushed back through the Dogenzaka Ticket Gate, and her footing faltered.

Then

Clap!

She blinked and suddenly, she was beside someone new.

Todo Aoi.

First-grade sorcerer. Kyoto weirdo. Lifesaver.

“Oh, hell yeah,” Nobara breathed, spotting another sorcerer nearby, looked like Nitta-san, but male. Sibling?

Didn’t matter. With Todo here, their odds of surviving just skyrocketed.

“Brother! Our battle has only just begun!” Todo declared, flinging off his jacket with dramatic flair.

“Todo!” Yuuji’s whole face lit up.

Che. Nobara would never understand their bromance. She didn’t even like the guy, but she’d be the first to admit his cursed technique was a game-changer. With him around, she could finally step back without feeling like dead weight.

Mahito, surprisingly, didn’t look fazed by the new arrivals. He charged in anyway.

Todo and Yuuji met him head-on.

Each of their strike echoing with raw cursed energy. Yuuji and Todo moved in perfect sync, as if they’d been fighting side by side their whole lives.

From the sidelines, Nobara did what she could, sniping transfigured humans before they could interfere. Arata Nitta, definitely a healer, managed to stabilize her injury, but after that, he had no choice but to fall back, out of the frontlines.

But then Mahito pulled a fast one. Transfigured humans swarmed the station, forcing Todo and Yuuji out into the open road.

Nobara stepped forward to follow, but a hand caught her wrist. She turned to see Akari Nitta, calm but firm.

“Stay back. We can’t help them out there.”

“Che…” Nobara scowled but didn’t shake him off. He was right.

For now, all she could do was watch and trust her team to win.

Yuuji despised Mahito.

This curse had twisted Junpei into a monster and nearly done the same to Kugisaki. He could still hear its mocking tone as it warped screaming civilians into horrors. Still see that sickening smile as it snuffed out lives like it meant nothing. Yuuji didn’t just want to defeat Mahito. He wanted to erase him. Completely.

Thankfully, Todo was fighting by his side. Without him, Yuuji wasn’t sure he could stand a chance against a special grade like this. He could’ve called on Sukuna, begged for help but he refused. He couldn’t rely on the King of Curses forever. He had to protect people with his own strength, his own hands.

Together, he and Todo pressed the advantage, driving Mahito back with brutal coordination. But the curse was slippery, always adapting. Just when it seemed like they were turning the tide, Mahito summoned a transfigured human unlike the rest, larger, stronger, unnervingly fast. It crashed into Todo mid-step, sending him flying into a storefront with a shower of glass and debris.

Yuuji’s fists clenched, his feet sliding back into stance. Mahito was already lunging again, forcing him to stay focused. He had to trust Todo to handle himself.

And Todo did return, battered but grinning.

They regrouped, ready to strike together once more.

Then Mahito smirked. The air shifted.

Cursed energy swirled, thick and oppressive, bending space around him like a tightening coil. Yuuji's eyes widened as the world began to ripple.

“Self-Embodiment of Perfection.”

Mahito activated his Domain Expansion.

Mahito found himself once again standing atop a familiar lake of blood. The surface was eerily calm beneath his feet, mirroring the stillness of the realm. Across from him stood the King of Curses, gazing at him with lazy indifference.

“So we meet again,” Mahito said, his tone sharp. “I still don’t understand why you’re so attached to that human. But it doesn’t matter.” His eyes narrowed. “I’m going to kill that brat before you get the chance to take control.”

Sukuna didn’t answer. His smirk widened, crimson eyes gleaming with something unreadable, something knowing. It was as if he already saw the outcome.

Before Mahito could process the look, he was forcefully ejected, hurled from Sukuna’s Inner Domain the moment his own Domain Expansion collapsed.

Before Yuuji could land a hit, Mahito had already dropped his Domain. The teen rushed to check on Todo, who was in the middle of severing his transfigured left hand. A split second later, a blow to Yuuji’s head made him stumble. When his vision cleared, he saw Todo barely staying upright, fending off the curse.

Yuuji leapt back into the fray, driving Mahito away, but Todo didn’t get up.

Yuuji’s chest tightened. He was on his own now.

The curse launched another transfigured human, but Yuuji tore through it with a clean blow. That brief distraction was all Mahito needed. His form shifted and warped into something new. Yuuji didn’t fully understand the change, but the surge of power was immediate, radiating from Mahito like heat off scorched asphalt.

They exchanged bitter words before clashing again.

This time, Yuuji’s blows lacked their usual impact. Mahito shrugged them off with ease.

Shit.

Yuuji found himself on the defensive, barely holding ground as he tried to limit the damage. Sensing hesitation, Mahito grabbed Yuuji’s face and slammed him into the ground. The impact shattered the pavement and burst a pipe, water pooling around him.

Still, Yuuji refused to call Sukuna, not yet. Not ever, if he could help it.

He forced himself to his feet, panting as water dripped from his chin. Across the crater, Mahito stepped forward, ready to face him again. If Yuuji wanted to end this, he had to give everything: Black Flash, maximum cursed energy, no room for hesitation.

Mahito darted across the shattered battlefield, striking fast and erratic, trying to catch Yuuji off guard. Yuuji focused on his breath, lowered his stance, and timed every move carefully.

Then an opening appeared.

He surged forward, cursed energy sparking. His punch connected with Mahito’s shoulder. The curse staggered. Before Mahito could react, Yuuji’s Divergent Fist struck true.

For a moment, Mahito looked genuinely rattled.

That’s when Todo appeared again, limping but grinning.

“Don’t forget about me,” he taunted as he activated Boogie Woogie.

Mahito twisted in alarm, but no clap came. It was a feint.

Yuuji took advantage and drove a second blow into the curse’s back.

BLACK FLASH!

The hit exploded with force, sending Mahito hurtling through the air. His monstrous transformation unraveled as he slammed into the dirt.

Yuuji climbed out of the crater and stalked toward him. Mahito tried to summon more transfigured humans, but nothing came. His cursed energy was drained.

Cornered.

Yuuji stared him down coldly, eyes sharp and merciless. Mahito’s own eyes widened in panic. He turned and ran.

Yuuji followed, unhurried but relentless.

The curse kicked up dirt in desperation. Yuuji batted it aside. Mahito crawled, trembling, trying to escape.

Yuuji raised his fist, ready to end it.

Then

“Enchain.”

The voice rang out just as Yuuji was yanked backward, his control stolen.

Sukuna appeared.

In a blink, the King of Curses lifted two fingers.

Dismantle.

The cursed technique carved Mahito into ribbons. The special grade was exorcised in an instant, his twisted form shredded and falling apart like wet paper.

Then his crimson gaze locked onto the new arrival, a black-haired man in monk’s robes.

“Long time no see, Kenjaku,” Sukuna said with a sharp grin.

Kenjaku sighed, smiling with thin patience. “Did you really have to do that? I had a plan, you know.”

Locating Yuuji wasn’t that hard. With Satoru’s Six Eyes and the ruckus and destruction the boy’s battle had caused, they could easily track his wayward student. However, Satoru still couldn’t arrive on time. When he and Choso were almost upon Yuuji, Sukuna’s presence flared back to life, forcing them to stop at the edge of the clearing. He passively registered other sorcerers arriving. There were Kyoto students, but he also sensed Panda, Nobara, Kusakabe, and Utahime. When the others noticed him, they began hurrying toward his position.

But Satoru couldn’t spare them any attention. He could only watch as Sukuna faced Kenjaku. What was that guy planning now? Was this the moment he finally revealed his true hand? Fuck. Satoru wanted to tell everyone to run, but he doubted it would help if the King of Curses decided to hunt them down.

“Sensei!” Nobara ran up to him, relief written all over her face. “I thought you got yourself killed! How did you escape?”

Satoru really wanted to comfort his student, but he couldn’t tear his eyes away from the center of the chaos. “Sorry, Nobara. I’ll explain later.”

“Is that Sukuna?!” Kusakabe demanded. The cowardly man clearly didn’t appreciate being so close to the King of Curses. “I thought the kid could control him! Why is he out again?”

“Shut up, old man!” Nobara shot back, irritated by the tone he used about her friend. “Sukuna must’ve used a Binding Vow to take control away from Itadori!”

“Why would he even agree to that?” Kusakabe looked horrified.

Nanami cut in, “Likely to save someone.” Somehow, he and Maki had joined the group of sorcerers observing Sukuna and Kenjaku from afar. Satoru spared a glance to make sure his junior and student were okay before returning to the confrontation ahead.

The situation was ridiculous. They were sorcerers who hunted curses, yet now they were just standing there, watching. But he had to admit, their hesitation made some sense. With Sukuna nearing full power, nobody could survive fighting him without a solid plan. And they definitely weren’t ready yet.

A new figure suddenly entered the standoff, a monk-robed person with white hair.

“I’ve done as you wished, Sukuna-sama.” The monk knelt on one knee beside Sukuna, their head bowed in deference.

Satoru’s eyes narrowed. A follower of Sukuna? He couldn’t believe anyone would be insane enough to follow the King of Curses, let alone that Sukuna would allow it.

“I’ve had this nagging suspicion that something’s going wrong,” Kenjaku finally said. “I made all these plans, and yet somehow my targets keep slipping away. Was that you, Sukuna?”

“What if it was?” Sukuna smirked, placing his hands in his pockets. The curse was taunting him, and Satoru couldn’t help but feel a hint of schadenfreude watching someone else suffer from Sukuna’s chaos.

“Are they having a falling out?” Nobara murmured.

“They do seem to be at odds,” Choso said.

Well, that was good news. As long as Sukuna didn’t turn on them now, they might actually get out of Shibuya alive. Fuck. Satoru missed his cursed energy and Infinity. If he had his power, he could be part of this conversation instead of standing around like a sitting duck.

“I thought we had an agreement,” Kenjaku said.

“You have your games,” Sukuna replied. “I merely played along. But I’m no longer interested in humoring you.”

Wait. So they had worked together. Then why the sudden change of heart? And if Sukuna really had turned on him, why not kill Kenjaku outright?

Satoru wracked his brain, then remembered Yuuji’s words:

“Sukuna asked me to let him out for ten minutes in the future in case I was in danger. But I made him promise he wouldn’t hurt humans while he was out, unless he was attacked first.”

If Sukuna had used that Binding Vow now, then he couldn’t hurt Kenjaku. As annoying as it was, nobody could say for sure whether Kenjaku was still technically human or not. So Sukuna couldn’t act recklessly and kill him without consequences.

“That’s a surprise,” Kenjaku said. “I thought you only cared about fighting and chaos. That’s why I approached you in the first place. Why the change of heart?”

Sukuna shrugged. “Change? I haven’t changed. I still care only about what pleases me or displeases me. And you, Kenjaku,” he pointed a finger, “have been displeasing me.”

“Oh?” Kenjaku raised an eyebrow. “What did I do to earn your wrath?” He tilted his head and tapped his chin. “Hmm… Is it because of Itadori Yuuji?”

The group of sorcerers tensed. Yuuji? What did he have to do with this? He was just a kid.

Sukuna didn’t answer. His eyes narrowed.

“I’m right, aren’t I?” Kenjaku let out a bark of laughter. “Come on, give me a break! Creating a vessel for you wasn’t easy. I had to run a lot of experiments before I got it right. Don’t tell me you’re mad I used the reincarnated soul of your twin?”

Satoru’s eyes widened. What? Everyone else looked equally stunned. Was Kenjaku saying Yuuji was the reincarnation of Sukuna’s twin?

“Let’s set aside the fact that you let yourself lie with the reincarnation of my twin to create Yuuji,” Sukuna said.

Ah, no. So Yuuji’s dad was Sukuna’s twin. What the fuck? Did that make Kenjaku Yuuji’s mom? Satoru frowned.

“I was quite displeased to find myself caged by a brat,” Sukuna added.

Kenjaku clicked his tongue. “Excuse you. I didn’t lie with your twin. Itadori Wasuke was the reincarnation of your brother, but let’s set that aside. You’re awfully picky! A weak soul can’t handle your power. I did my best!”

Wait so it was Yuuji's grandpa who was Sukuna's reincarnated twin? Satoru prided himself on being a genius, but this was one hell of a mental pretzel.

Sukuna’s eyes widened slightly, but he said, “Cease your prattling. I’m done following your whims, and there’s nothing you can do to change that. Uraume.”

The monk immediately blew out a breath of cursed energy that froze the ground and created a massive ice formation aimed at Kenjaku. Unfortunately, he dodged easily, leaping onto a manta ray-shaped cursed spirit.

“How unfortunate!” Kenjaku called. “I thought we were great partners. But I suppose it’s my fault for expecting anything from someone like you.”

“Don’t speak that way to Sukuna-sama!” Uraume snapped, summoning a tall pillar of ice to pursue Kenjaku. The two began clashing midair.

“Should we fight too?” Nanami asked, gripping his blade tightly.

Satoru shook his head. He still wasn’t sure about Sukuna’s stance. Declaring Kenjaku an enemy didn’t automatically make him an ally. As long as the ten-minute mark hadn’t passed and Sukuna remained bound by the vow, he could handle Kenjaku alone. They needed to conserve their strength in case they had to retreat. Hopefully, Yuuji would take control again before things got worse.

Uraume and Kenjaku looked evenly matched, but Satoru knew better. The body-snatcher was still only using cursed spirit manipulation. He had more up his sleeve. With a powerful kick, Kenjaku sent Uraume crashing to the ground.

Sukuna caught the monk and gently set them down. “Sukuna-sama.” Uraume looked deeply ashamed for failing him.

“You know,” Kenjaku said, “don’t think I haven’t noticed you haven’t attacked me directly yet.” He grinned and released a wave of cursed spirits toward the sorcerers.

Shit.

Everyone raised their weapons, preparing for battle, but then Sukuna appeared in front of them, slicing the spirits apart with Dismantle. Still, more cursed creatures came in waves.

“Of course, that’s not all.” Kenjaku raised his fingers in a sign. “Seal activate.”

At that moment, invisible chains appeared and wrapped around Sukuna’s soul. No one else seemed to notice, but Satoru did. Whatever it was, it was holding the King of Curses down. A second later, Sukuna stumbled to one knee.

“Sukuna-sama!” Uraume rushed to his side.

“You think I wouldn’t have a backup plan in case you turned on me?” Kenjaku laughed, flying off into the sky. The sorcerers tried to give chase, but the swarm of cursed spirits overwhelmed them. Several fighters stayed behind to protect Satoru.

Fuck. If only he had his power, he could clear these weaklings in a second.

“You!” Uraume tried to run after Kenjaku, but Sukuna grabbed their hand.

“Uraume,” Sukuna grit out.

Satoru doubted anyone else heard his words. The battlefield was filled with screams and howls, but his Six Eyes remained locked on Sukuna. He could read his lips.

“Protect Itadori Yuuji.”

With that, the chains finally pulled Sukuna down, and Yuuji returned to the forefront. The boy gasped, touching his chest, his eyes wide.

“Huh? Sukuna? SUKUNA?”

Whatever Kenjaku had done, it had severed the connection between them. Yuuji ran after the fleeing man, screaming as cursed spirits battered him from all sides.

“GIVE HIM BACK! GIVE SUKUNA BACK!”

Omake:

Sukuna: *Sees Gojo okay* Good! You’re fine! That’s great. I can just leave that guy to you guys.

Sukuna: *Nobara survives against Mahito* Hallelujah! Another character is saved!

Sukuna: *Mahito confronts Sukuna* LOL! I will laugh when you finally bite the dust.

Sukuna: *Finally meets Kenjaku* Time to end this! Wait, I can’t hurt this guy because of the Binding Vow! Gotta stall! I choose you, Uraume!

Sukuna: *Gets sealed away* YOU PIECE OF SHIIIIII-!

 

Satoru: What the fuck?

Yuuji: GIVE SUKUNA BACK!!!

Chapter Text

Yuuji wasn’t sure how exactly they escaped Shibuya. Everything blurred into chaos after the curse user fled. But even in the confusion, all he could focus on was the sudden emptiness inside him. Sukuna rarely spoke. He wasn’t a constant voice in Yuuji’s mind, but his presence had always been there, looming and silent like a shadow. Now, that shadow was gone. Whatever that long-haired man had done, it had severed the connection between them. Yuuji could still sense something faint, distant, like Sukuna was buried beneath layers of barriers too thick to breach.

It made him feel sick. He hadn’t realized how much he’d adjusted to Sukuna’s presence. Even when the curse was silent, he was there. And now, the stillness in his mind was unbearable, too quiet, too hollow. He caught flickers of movement, his friends, his teacher, voices shouting, but they felt far away. His limbs turned heavy, and his vision faded as his knees gave out. Cold arms caught him before he hit the ground.

Yuuji hoped that when he woke up, Sukuna would be back. Even if just to stay silent.

Satoru should’ve known those geezers would take any chance to get rid of him. The only thing that ever stopped them was his sheer power. Now that he couldn’t use cursed energy, the elders finally had the guts to act on their cowardice.

    [NOTICE FROM JUJUTSU HEADQUARTERS:]

    [1. GETO SUGURU’S SURVIVAL HAS BEEN CONFIRMED. HE SHALL BE SENTENCED TO DEATH AGAIN.]

    [2. GOJO SATORU HAS BEEN DEEMED AN ACCOMPLICE IN THE SHIBUYA INCIDENT. HE IS HEREBY PERMANENTLY EXILED FROM THE JUJUTSU WORLD. ANYONE WHO AIDS OR COLLABORATES WITH HIM WILL BE MARKED A TRAITOR.]

    [3. YAGA MASAMICHI IS TO BE EXECUTED FOR INCITING GOJO SATORU AND GETO SUGURU. HE IS DEEMED A PERPETRATOR IN THE SHIBUYA INCIDENT.]

    [4. THE SUSPENSION OF ITADORI YUUJI’S EXECUTION HAS BEEN REVOKED. HE SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH IMMEDIATELY.]

Satoru laughed when he read it. A low, humorless chuckle. He really should’ve killed those old bastards when he had the chance.

Still, he’d prepared for this. Even if getting sealed hadn’t been part of the plan, he never left himself without backup. With the mole flushed out, he had already shared his findings with trusted allies, quietly, in case this very scenario played out.

The witnesses at the end of Shibuya were all people on his side. And the moment they saw the notice, they activated the contingency plan.

Technically, it was only him and Yuuji who needed to disappear. But the group that defected ended up much larger than anticipated.

The first years refused to abandon their friend. Panda had hesitated, torn between helping Yuuji and looking for Yaga, so Satoru encouraged him to return to his father. He’d long suspected Yaga might become a target if Satoru was removed, and they’d already secured an exit plan for him. Maki and Toge left with Panda, though they promised to keep in contact.

Nanami insisted on staying behind. “Someone has to keep eyes on the inside,” he said. Utahime and the Kyoto students played dumb, pretending not to know anything. Even Kusakabe returned to HQ, and for all his cowardice, Satoru trusted him not to snitch. Shoko also stayed behind; if she disappeared too, it would’ve been too obvious.

Everything was going smoothly, except for four extra guests who invited themselves in.

He expected the three Death Paintings to stick around for Yuuji’s sake. But Uraume?

That one was a wild card.

The white-haired monk had refused to leave Yuuji’s side and glared at everyone like they were scum. The first years and Death Paintings looked ready to throw hands with a special grade curse, but Satoru had to play referee.

Eventually, the whole group reached the safe house. He owned plenty of properties, some open, some kept hidden from even the Gojo clan. He never expected to use one himself. They were meant to protect people he cared about.

Getting there was a pain. Their group was far from inconspicuous, and the Death Paintings especially stuck out. Luckily, Megumi offered to hide them in his shadows, and their bad luck in Shibuya finally broke. They entered the building unseen.

The place was huge, an old estate on the outskirts with a yard and forest. Barriers were in place: one to repel non-sorcerers, one to hide the location from jujutsu users, and a third to absorb attacks. As safe as it could get.

But the unease lingered.

Mainly because of the silent, looming presence of Uraume, who was still cradling Yuuji like an offering. They hadn’t said a word since joining the group. Sukuna’s order must’ve been absolute; Uraume didn’t let the boy out of their arms once.

Satoru clapped his hands sharply to break the tension. “Alright, folks. You’re tired, I’m tired. Pick a room, take a nap. We’ll regroup in the morning, capiche?”

No one moved at first. Then:

“What about Yuuji?” Choso growled, arms folded tight. His fingers twitched every time he looked at Uraume.

“I’ll help them get Yuuji settled,” Satoru said, calm and easy.

Eventually, the others dispersed. Choso lingered, glancing back several times before finally slipping away.

Once alone, Satoru turned to the curse user.

“I heard Sukuna gave you an order,” he said. “Protect Yuuji, huh? That guy’s a lot more attached than I thought.”

“Do not speak of Sukuna-sama,” Uraume snapped, eyes sharp. “And do not test my patience. You’re weakened, sorcerer. I could end you and your allies where you stand. The only reason I haven’t is because our goals currently align.”

“Ooo, scary,” Satoru grinned, utterly unimpressed. He could tell Uraume wasn’t lying, but they also weren’t going to make the first move. Their loyalty was to Sukuna, not to carnage for its own sake.

Still, Satoru made a mental note to watch them closely. The Death Paintings cared about Yuuji. Uraume only cared about Sukuna. If they thought hurting the kid would bring their master back faster...

“Come on,” he said. “This way.”

He led them to a room adjacent to his own. From the sounds echoing through the hallway, everyone else had already settled in. Junpei and Megumi shared a large room. Nobara stayed nearby. The Death Painting brothers clustered together, as expected.

Uraume gently laid Yuuji on the bed, then opened the closet to grab fresh clothes. Every room had a stockpile, just in case. The monk began undressing Yuuji without hesitation, cleaning off grime and blood with practiced efficiency. Satoru watched carefully but saw nothing suspicious. Just routine, mechanical care.

“You’re good at that,” he said. “You a nurse or something?”

Uraume didn’t answer right away. Then, “You may consider me Sukuna-sama’s attendant. My primary role is to cook for him.”

“...He’s picky?”

They gave him a sidelong look. “Preparing and seasoning human flesh is an art. Sukuna-sama appreciates the delicate balance of texture and taste. That is why he keeps me close.”

Satoru blinked. “Oh. Right. Cannibal. Forgot.”

Yeah, he wasn’t gonna touch that one. “So. What now? You gonna play house with us until Sukuna makes a comeback?”

Uraume narrowed their eyes. “I will protect Itadori Yuuji. As long as you do not interfere, I have no reason to act against you.”

Satoru’s tone shifted, sharp and low. “I may be powerless, but I’m not helpless. Step out of line, and I’ll make sure you regret it.”

Uraume met his glare without flinching. “Then do not test me either, Gojo Satoru. You would not survive the cold.”

A long pause.

Then Satoru smiled. “Duly noted. Now get your own room. You’re not staying with the kid.”

Uraume shot him an unimpressed glare before calmly stepping out to find a place of their own to rest. Satoru, meanwhile, turned his attention to Yuuji, who was caught in the grip of an uneasy sleep. His Six Eyes told him that Sukuna still lingered within the boy, though Kenjaku’s seal kept the King of Curses firmly suppressed. He could even faintly see the chains snaking around that cursed soul, whatever technique was used, it was nearly as intricate as the seal on Tsumiki’s forehead.

With nothing else to be done, Satoru finally retreated to his room. Shoko had managed to patch him up in passing, but he still felt awful. The lingering effect of the Soul Piercing Blade had thrown his whole system off. For someone born into cursed energy, soaked in it from the start, the sensation of living without it was suffocating. Was this how fish felt when yanked from water?

After a quick shower and a change into clean clothes, Satoru collapsed onto the bed with a heavy sigh. He was bone-deep tired and desperate for rest, but his mind wouldn’t stop churning. The events of Shibuya had upended the fragile balance of the Jujutsu world.

They had survived, but Kenjaku was still out there. Satoru had no doubt the man was orchestrating something bigger. A curse user like him would never let things settle. And without his powers, Satoru was walking on thin ice. One misstep and everything could fall apart. With that thought weighing him down, he finally drifted into an uneasy sleep.

It didn’t last long.

A loud crash from Yuuji’s room jolted him awake. He jumped up and dashed down the hallway.

Yuuji was on the floor, tangled in his blanket like it was actively fighting him and losing. Satoru let out a small laugh and moved to help.

“Yuuji-kun, relax.”

The boy looked up, eyes wide and distressed, only to brighten the moment he saw his teacher. “Gojo-sensei!” he cried, launching himself at Satoru, who caught him easily.

“I was so worried! When I heard you got sealed, I wanted to run straight to Shibuya Station! Everything was chaos! I met those curse brothers and two girls and then Sukuna told me to help them and”

Satoru patted his back gently. “Shh. It’s okay. Calm down. Everyone made it out. You’re safe now.”

Yuuji sniffled, rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand. “…I still can’t feel him…”

There was no need to ask who he meant.

Apparently, Sukuna’s absence weighed heavier on Yuuji than Satoru had expected. Sharing your head with someone, especially someone like that, must’ve been a strange, singular bond. Losing it, even if it was a curse, probably left a void.

“Alright, don’t look so glum. How about we eat first?” Satoru coaxed him to his feet and guided him out. Uraume had arrived, appearing just a second after him, already waiting in the hall.

Satoru was about to introduce their unusual guest when Yuuji’s eyes lit up.

“You’re Sukuna’s friend!”

Uraume blinked, visibly taken aback by the title. Satoru barely held back a laugh. Sukuna, with a friend?

“I am Sukuna-sama’s subordinate,” Uraume corrected with an edge. “If you are hungry, I can prepare a meal.”

“Uh, I can cook for myself,” Yuuji replied awkwardly. He was one of the few students who actually enjoyed cooking and often prepared meals for everyone, including Satoru. Having someone else volunteer caught him off guard.

“There’s no need. As long as I am here, I will cook for you every day.”

Satoru raised an eyebrow. “Does that include me too?”

Uraume gave him a sharp look but eventually muttered, “I’ll make enough for everyone.”

The three entered the dining area. While Satoru and Yuuji sat at the table, Uraume disappeared into the kitchen. Ingredients were already laid out, apparently the monk had spent the early hours prepping instead of resting. It seemed Uraume’s culinary talents weren’t limited to, well, more questionable ingredients. The scent wafting from the pan was actually delicious.

Gradually, the others trickled in, drawn by the smell.

“Potato head, how do you still look like hell after sleeping for two days?” Nobara said the moment she saw Yuuji’s dark circles.

“I don’t think any of us slept well,” Megumi murmured, eyes on the coffee maker like it owed him something.

“I still feel half-dead,” Junpei added with a yawn.

“Little brother! Are you injured? Do you need anything?” Choso shot up halfway from his chair, looking ready to bolt over.

Yuuji froze, overwhelmed by the barrage of voices, and sent Satoru a desperate glance. The man just chuckled and patted his head again.

“Alright, alright. One at a time, everyone.”

Yuuji turned toward Choso. “Sensei, who’s he?”

“Ah! That’s our big brother!” Eso answered cheerfully, now wearing an actual shirt for once. With the right lighting, he could almost pass for human if you ignored the eyes.

Yuuji stared, then blinked in realization. “Wait, I remember you! You’re the one who helped sensei escape! Thank you so much!”

Choso looked like he might burst into tears. “No need to thank me, little brother! Just… call me onii-chan!”

The room paused. The kids collectively leaned back in mild alarm.

“What is this, a weird kink?” Nobara muttered sideways to Megumi.

“Why are you asking me?” Megumi replied flatly.

“Pretty sure I saw this plot in a movie once,” Junpei added under his breath.

Yuuji blinked. “Uh… your brothers also say I’m their sibling. But I’m pretty sure I’m an only child.”

“No, no! We’re brothers, Yuuji! Our cursed blood connects us! That wretched father Kamo Noritoshi!”

“Kamo?” Nobara tilted her head.

“Noritoshi?” echoed Junpei.

“…The Kyoto student?” Megumi asked.

"No, no. This is a different person." Satoru waved his hand. "There was another clan member with that name, Kamo Noritoshi, who lived centuries ago. He’s the one who created the Death Painting Cursed Wombs."

The students’ eyes widened in realization, but Nobara quickly narrowed hers. "Wait a second. Shouldn’t he have been dead long before Itadori was even born?"

"Ah, that’s where you’re wrong, student!" Satoru grinned, always enjoying the spotlight. "Although he’s called Kamo Noritoshi, the man who created the Cursed Wombs is actually an ancient curse user. He has the ability to hijack corpses and use them like puppets. Poor Kamo was just one of his victims."

"Ew," Nobara said with a grimace.

"This is the plot of a movie," Junpei muttered.

"You’ve known about this for a while, haven’t you?" Megumi asked, eyes narrowing in suspicion.

"Not the part about him being Kamo Noritoshi," Satoru said, raising his hands. "That was news to me, too. But I did know the curse user’s real name Kenjaku. The most obvious sign that he’s taken over a body is the stitch mark on the forehead."

All eyes snapped to Yuuji who, at that moment, looked like he’d been hit by a truck. He didn’t speak for a few seconds, just stared into the distance.

Satoru was about to shake him when the boy finally blinked and dropped a bombshell. "...My mother. I think I remember seeing Kenjaku as my mother."

The room went dead silent.

Nobara shot up and grabbed Yuuji by the collar. "What the hell are you saying, potato head?!"

"What kind of B movie nonsense is this?" Junpei groaned, pressing a hand to his forehead.

Megumi’s frown deepened to a full scowl.

Yuuji didn’t resist Nobara’s grip. He just stared up at the ceiling, voice dull. "Remember when I told you I recalled something important? I didn’t get it at the time. But I saw my dad holding me… my grandpa yelling at him about my mother. He said she was dead. And then this woman walked in. She had stitches on her forehead."

"You mean when you collapsed?" Nobara asked, loosening her grip.

Yuuji nodded. "It was because of Sukuna."

The name made everyone freeze. Even Uraume, who was still busy in the kitchen, paused for a moment.

"He said he saw something similar in our souls mine and the brothers’. Then he did something he called ‘soul resonance.’ That’s what triggered the memory."

Satoru frowned. Soul healing, soul resonance… the King of Curses had more soul-related abilities than any sorcerer he knew. It was starting to become a problem.

Before they could say more, Uraume entered with their meals. The kids brightened at the sight and Yuuji’s stomach loudly agreed.

Satoru laughed. "Alright, let’s eat first. We can pick this up after."

Everyone grabbed a plate, the tension temporarily melting away. But just as they were about to start eating, Yuuji looked up. "Aren’t you going to join us, Uraume-san?"

The curse user had been silently standing near him, unmoving. Caught off guard, they blinked. "You needn’t concern yourself with me, Yuuji-sama. I’ll eat later."

"Don’t call me sama, it’s weird," Yuuji replied quickly. "And you made this food. You should eat it with us."

Uraume hesitated. "It is my duty to care for your wellbeing, as per Sukuna-sama’s instructions. That is enough for me."

Yuuji frowned. "Well, I want you to eat with us. I know you’re Sukuna’s old friend or whatever, but this isn’t the Heian era. No need to act like we’re in a court drama."

Uraume pursed their lips. But after seeing the stubborn glint in Yuuji’s eyes, they sighed and relented. "...Very well."

They took a bowl and sat beside Satoru. The others exchanged glances but chose not to comment, especially when they saw how Yuuji beamed at the small victory. With the extra hands (and appetite), Uraume’s mountain of food quickly vanished.

"Pwah! I'm stuffed!" Yuuji declared, patting his stomach with a huge grin. "That was amazing, Uraume-san!"

The monk gave a brief nod in response.

“Alright.” Nobara leaned back, stretching. “Now that we’re all full, can we talk about the elephant in the room? Why is His Murderous Majesty’s Minion being all buddy-buddy with the potato head?”

Uraume twitched at the nickname but answered coolly. “Sukuna-sama has instructed me to protect Itadori Yuuji. While I trust in my abilities, Kenjaku is a genius who must not be underestimated. Cooperation with sorcerers increases the chance of fulfilling my mission.”

Yuuji frowned. “Speaking of… what happened to Sukuna? After whatever Kenjaku did, it’s like he disappeared. I can’t hear him at all.”

“Kenjaku is a master of seals and barriers,” Uraume said. “And since you were created by him, it’s not surprising he placed a contingency seal inside your body to suppress Sukuna-sama.”

Yuuji’s eyes widened in horror. “Wait, are you saying he’s going to be trapped inside me forever?”

Satoru wanted to say it wasn’t necessarily a bad thing, but Yuuji looked genuinely upset. He held his tongue. Teasing didn’t feel right not when it was clear the boy had started to see the King of Curses as some kind of friend.

“Didn’t Kenjaku seal away your power too, Sensei?” Junpei asked.

“Kind of,” Satoru replied with a shrug. “It’s the effect of a cursed tool called the Soul Piercing Blade. Nasty little thing it suppresses my cursed energy, but only temporarily.” He grinned. “I’d say it wears off in a month or so.”

Relief washed over the group. Nobara even smirked, pumping her fist. “So we just have to lay low, and once you’re back to full power, you can blow those crusty old elders sky-high!”

Megumi opened his mouth to protest the blatant mutiny then closed it again with a click. The elders had exiled Gojo and sentenced him, Yuuji, and Yaga to death. Fair point.

“I wouldn’t be so optimistic,” Uraume interjected coolly. “Kenjaku likely knows that your seal won’t last. I doubt he’ll sit on his hands while Gojo Satoru regains his strength. He’ll act before then.”

“Oh?” Satoru tilted his head. “You sound like you know something. Care to share?”

“I refuse.”

Everyone except Satoru scowled at the flat response.

“What the hell? I thought you were helping us!” Nobara snapped.

“You’re mistaken. My only objective is to protect Itadori Yuuji. I have no intention of helping sorcerers. Honestly, it’d be more convenient for me if Kenjaku eliminated Gojo while I escaped with Yuuji-san.”

Yuuji frowned, clearly about to argue, but Satoru raised an index finger with a knowing look. “Let me guess. You’re trying to push us into releasing Sukuna.”

Uraume didn’t even flinch. They simply stared at Satoru, unconcerned that he’d hit the mark. “Sukuna-sama understands Kenjaku better than anyone. He would be more useful to you than I ever could be.”

Satoru doubted that. From what their captured enemies had revealed, Uraume had likely been at Kenjaku’s side far longer than they’d served Sukuna. Still, pressing the issue wouldn’t help Uraume wouldn’t say more unless Sukuna told them to. Loyal mutt.

Fine. Satoru had been planning to poke at Sukuna eventually anyway.

“Alright, I’ll play along.”

“Wait can you actually help Sukuna?” Yuuji asked, eyes wide with hope.

Aiya. What was he supposed to do with this kid? After losing his grandfather, Yuuji had probably clung to the idea of family and finding out Sukuna was some kind of weird uncle or grandfather had only made things worse. It didn’t help that Yuuji bonded way too easily.

Reluctantly, Satoru answered, “I’ve looked at the seal using my Six Eyes. As far as I can tell, it mostly blocks communication. It’s suppressing his power, sure, but I can still sense Sukuna’s cursed energy in your body.”

“So you can break it, right?” Yuuji asked, hopeful.

“Nope!” Satoru said brightly.

“Eh?”

“I can’t. I might be a genius, but Kenjaku’s a master at sealing. If I tried to force it open, I could seriously hurt you or Sukuna.”

Yuuji’s expression crumpled. “Then…”

“Whoa, don’t cry yet,” Satoru said, waving his hands. “I never said we were out of options. We don’t have to break the seal. We can work around it.”

He leaned forward, eyes gleaming. “There’s a cursed object called the Bunshin Mirror that can create a clone. Basically, it transfers a sorcerer’s mind into a puppet body. Most people don’t use it because it leaves their real body vulnerable, but in this case? Perfect loophole.”

“You mean we could move Sukuna’s consciousness into the clone?” Yuuji asked.

“Exactly! If you can guide his cursed energy into the mirror, we can pull him out without dismantling Kenjaku’s seal.”

“You’re amazing, Sensei!” Yuuji threw his arms around Satoru, who laughed and patted his back.

Their celebration was cut short when Uraume asked, “What about Sukuna-sama’s power?”

Satoru smirked. “What? You thought he’d get a full upgrade with this plan? No way. Even without Kenjaku’s seal, the Bunshin Mirror can only transfer a fraction of his strength. If Sukuna tries to go rogue, Yuuji can just yank him back.”

Uraume’s eyes narrowed, but they exhaled slowly. “As long as I can speak to him I’ll accept this.”

“Then it’s settled!” Satoru stood up dramatically, hands on hips. “Operation: Save the King of Curses is officially a go!”

Omake:

Satoru: Urgent! Waiting online! My kid has gotten attached to a bad person what should I do?

Uraume: I’m only here because of Sukuna-sama’s orders.

Yuuji: I want Sukuna back…

Nobara: What kind of stupid family drama is this?

Junpei: We can make a movie out of this.

Megumi: I need coffee.

Choso: Yuuji! Call me onii-chan!

 

Sukuna: *Trapped inside* AAAAAAAAAAAA-!!!!
Notes:

    I'm still busy with work so don't expect daily updates!
    Also sorry if some of you are annoyed at these new cursed tools/objects. Listen I gotta find a way to change the canon. And if something as unreasonable and OP as Prison Realm can exists, mine can too!

Chapter 19
Chapter Text

"I'm sorry, but the bakery's out of stock. We might need to check other branches."

That was the coded message Nanami sent to Satoru’s burner phone. As much as Satoru craved something sweet, he wasn’t actually asking his junior to bring back mochi and cakes. Nanami, one of the few who stayed behind at Jujutsu Headquarters, was their best informant on the ground.

The Bunshin Mirror was supposed to be stored in Jujutsu High’s warehouse, but after Satoru’s downfall, the major clans had already reclaimed their belongings, locking them back inside their private vaults.

"Ruthless bastards," Satoru muttered. "All these years I kept the peace, and the second I’m knocked off my pedestal, they scatter like cockroaches."

Not that he was surprised. He had been born into the endless spiral of power, politics, and posturing. In the eyes of those fools, there were never true allies, only temporary conveniences.

Still, this was within expectations. Walking into the warehouse and retrieving the cursed object was no longer an option. Since the Bunshin Mirror originally belonged to the Zen’in clan, they were most likely the ones holding it now.

Infiltrating a clan compound wouldn’t have fazed him before, but with his cursed energy sealed, things weren’t so simple.

"Infiltrating the Zen’in compound to steal cursed tools? Count me in." Maki grinned. She had arrived with Panda at Satoru’s request and clearly had no intention of missing a chance to stick it to her backwards, sexist family.

"Shouldn’t you at least hear the plan first, senpai?" Megumi asked with a tired look.

After getting Nanami’s message, the group had begun mapping out how to retrieve the Bunshin Mirror. Opening the Zen’in storehouse wasn’t a problem. Naobito had once given Megumi a spare key in an attempt to coax him into joining the clan. The key had remained untouched in Megumi’s room for years, and they had even asked Nanami to retrieve and smuggle it out for them. Now that they had access, they just needed someone to guide them through the compound. Naturally, they had thought of Maki.

She shrugged. "What for? We’re just robbing them blind, right?"

Megumi looked like he wanted to argue, then gave up with a sigh. Satoru chuckled at his expression, earning a sharp look from the boy.

"Since you're in," Megumi continued, "we need to figure out who else is coming. I’ll go. My shadows are good for infiltration, and worst case, I might be able to stall Naobito and buy time for an escape."

"Me! Me! Pick me!" Yuuji nearly leapt from his seat, hand raised enthusiastically.

"No way, Yuuji-kun. You’re staying put," Satoru said immediately.

"What? Why?"

"Aside from me and Yaga, you're the number one target sorcerers want to kill." Satoru gave him a pointed look, ignoring the wide, disappointed eyes. "You step foot near the compound and you’ll be putting everyone else in danger."

Yuuji pouted but didn’t argue further. "Still think it’s risky for Fushiguro and Maki-senpai to go alone."

"Of course. They won’t be alone," Satoru said.

Megumi frowned. "I don’t think bringing a large team is a good idea either."

"They won’t," Satoru replied, tapping his chin thoughtfully. "Maki and Megumi will go in first. But we’ll have a backup team on standby if things go south."

"I’ll go," Uraume offered. "My ice can pin those weaklings down easily."

There was no denying Uraume’s strength, and with their vested interest in Sukuna, Satoru doubted betrayal. Still—

"Nope. Not happening."

Uraume narrowed their eyes. "Why not?"

"If you suddenly show up, Kenjaku will know something is up. He knows you only move for Sukuna. That might force him to act before we’re ready."

After a long look at Satoru, Uraume relented. "I see."

"So who will go with us then?" Megumi asked.

"Who else? Yuta-kun, of course." Satoru grinned.

Maki blinked. "Yuta? When did he get back from Africa? Wait, isn’t he under heavy surveillance? The higher-ups were ready to execute him until you stepped in."

"True. But conveniently, he’s been assigned patrol duty near the Zen’in compound. If Megumi gives the signal, he’ll be there."

"With a special grade backing us up, there shouldn't be a problem," Megumi murmured.

Satoru, still grinning, added, "Actually, I want to include one more person on this mission."

Everyone turned to him in surprise.

"Ha? You want to borrow Arata Nitta?" Utahime stared, baffled.

Gojo had finally managed to get a secure call through to the Kyoto branch. Since Utahime had made no secret of her dislike for him, the higher-ups didn’t watch her nearly as closely as they did Nanami.

"Yeah, I know it’s a big ask, but I’d really feel better if we had a healer with them," Gojo said.

"You realize Nitta can only stop injuries from getting worse, right?" Utahime said flatly. "And isn’t Okkotsu on this mission too?"

"He is, but he’s not confident in healing others. If Nitta’s there, it’s enough to keep people from dying. We can do proper treatment afterward."

Utahime couldn’t really blame him. They were infiltrating one of the Big Three clans. It was a risky move. Still, she couldn’t just hand over one of her own students. If something went wrong, Nitta would be marked as a criminal. That wasn’t a risk she could take lightly.

"You’re asking too much, Gojo."

Gojo fell quiet for a second before he said, "You know you’re going to have to take a side eventually. After Shibuya, there’s no avoiding a clash between me and the elders. I’ve been patient, but they’ve crossed the line."

"And you want me to drag my students into your mess?" Utahime snapped.

"It’s not like that. I’m just asking you to pass the request along. If Nitta says no, that’s the end of it. But if he agrees, I’d owe you big."

The way he said it made her feel unreasonable for refusing. She still hated the idea of putting students in danger when it could be avoided, but danger was already baked into the job. And she understood his desperation. With Kenjaku on the loose, no one was sleeping well.

"Fine. I’ll ask him. No promises."

"Thank you so much. I knew I could count on you, even if you’re weak—"

"RESPECT. YOUR. SENIOR."

Utahime ended the call with a stab of irritation. She needed a full minute to collect herself before she could move again. Spending this much time talking to Gojo was clearly messing with her brain.

The students still hadn’t returned to the school after Shibuya. They were staying in a hotel, and Utahime refused to leave Todo, who had lost his left hand during a fight with a special grade. Shoko had stabilized the wound, but there wasn’t much hope of reattachment.

Then again...

Didn’t someone say Sukuna could regrow limbs?

She stopped mid-step and slapped her forehead. No. Absolutely not. She was not going to ask the King of Curses for a favor. This was Gojo’s fault. Prolonged exposure to him caused irreversible brain damage.

When she finally reached Nitta’s door, she took a deep breath and knocked.

A moment later, the door opened. Nitta blinked at her, surprised. "Sensei?"

"Sorry, Nitta-kun. Do you have a minute?"

They sat at the low hotel table and kept their voices quiet. Nitta’s eyes widened as she explained the situation.

The students didn’t know all the details, but none of them supported the decision to exile Gojo. To most of them, and plenty of sorcerers besides, he had been the pillar holding their world together.

"Gojo-san needs my help?" Nitta asked, his voice hushed.

"This mission is incredibly dangerous," Utahime said. "If you get caught, they could brand you a traitor. I understand why he wants you, but I still think this is too much to ask."

Nitta opened his mouth, then closed it. He sat there, stunned for a moment. Then he took a breath and nodded.

"If that’s what’s needed, then I’ll help."

Utahime sighed when she saw the spark in his eyes. She got it. Gojo had a reputation. People looked up to him. But if any of them had to deal with him in person for more than five minutes, she was sure they’d change their minds.

"You’re sure?" she asked. "You don’t need to rush into this."

"I’m sure, sensei." Nitta met her eyes. "My technique isn’t great, and I can’t fight. But I can still help. Please let me support the Tokyo students."

She hesitated. The earnest look on his face left her with no good reason to keep saying no.

"Alright. I’ll tell Gojo you agreed. But you’ll stay with Okkotsu and only step in if you’re needed. Got it?"

Neither of them noticed someone listening nearby.

From the shadows, Mai stared at her shoes, her teeth pressing into her lip.

Once everyone agreed on the plan, they moved fast. Time wasn’t on their side. No one knew when Kenjaku might strike again, and the best way to prepare was to learn more about their enemy before it was too late.

Maki wasn’t too worried. The situation wasn’t ideal, sure, but they still had a lot of capable people on their side. As long as Gojo stayed safe until his power returned, they would manage. Sukuna was more of a question mark, but for someone called the King of Curses, he didn’t seem that bad. Bloodthirsty, unpredictable, maybe a pyromaniac, but most sorcerers had worse quirks. She had met far more disgusting and cruel people than the Sukuna she had seen so far.

But if she was being honest, her main reason for joining the mission was personal. She couldn’t wait to stick it to the Zen’in clan. The thought of their panic once they realized all their precious cursed tools were gone gave her energy. She and Megumi had spotted Nitta at a small cafe near the compound. He gave them a quick glance from his seat but didn’t approach. Hopefully, they wouldn’t need his help. In and out, quick and clean. That was the goal.

“Are you ready?” Megumi asked as they got a short message from Yuta saying he was nearby.

Maki nodded. Together, they stepped into his shadow and vanished.

It took time to find a safe route. The storehouse was underground, and they had to avoid patrols. Fortunately, Maki knew the layout well from her time in the Kukuru Unit. As long as they stayed out of sight, they could avoid being noticed.

When they reached the tall door of the storehouse, both let out a breath of relief. They slipped out of the shadow, and Megumi wiped sweat off his cheek before tossing Maki the key. She caught it, grinned, and unlocked the door. It creaked open, and they stepped inside.

Two figures were already waiting.

Zen’in Naobito and Ogi.

Shit.

“Welcome. You two sure took your time,” Naobito said, taking a swig of sake from the bottle in his hand. He was sitting casually on the floor. “I was about to run out of drinks.”

Ogi leaned against a nearby pillar, looking calm. “You weren’t as subtle as you thought.”

The two elders stared them down. Megumi and Maki froze.

“Ogi, handle your kid,” Naobito said, standing up. “I want a word with Megumi.”

Without hesitation, Ogi lunged at Maki, forcing her out of the storeroom. She cursed under her breath. She didn’t want to leave Megumi behind, but she had to deal with her father first. He wasn’t pulling his punches. Every swing of his blade was meant to kill.

Fine. She had a trump card.

Keel. A cursed tool that could absorb cursed energy from others and dispel it at will. If she could lure him into an Iai exchange and catch him off guard, she might get a clean hit. He didn’t know what the tool could do.

She stepped back and dropped into a stance.

Ogi mirrored her, activating the Falling Blossom technique. “Do you know why my brother was chosen as clan head instead of me?”

“Because you’re a piece of shit who doesn’t mind killing his children?” Maki shot back.

Their blades clashed.

Clang.

Thunk.

Keel absorbed his cursed energy, and Maki struck again. Her second blow shattered his blade. A piece of it spun through the air, and Maki surged forward, ready to end it.

Slash.

Her eyes widened. Pain bloomed in her stomach. He had struck her. But how? She had broken his blade.

He had shaped his cursed energy into a new one, just long enough to pierce her.

Damn it. She hoped Megumi could get out on his own.

Maki dropped to her knees and lost consciousness.

"I don’t understand why you refused to join the Zen’in clan," Naobito said. "Do you really like that white-haired brat that much?"

Megumi wheezed. This wasn’t good. He was stuck in a stalemate. The storeroom was covered in shadows from his unfinished domain, but the old man wasn’t fazed. He simply used the Falling Blossom Emotion technique, as if Megumi’s effort meant nothing. Tch. Megumi didn’t want a fight. His goal was to secure the cursed tools. With his domain active, he could absorb all of them into his shadow, but doing so would slow him down. He needed a clean escape route before making his move.

Naobito didn’t seem to care about Megumi’s silence. "Your technique marks you as a Zen’in. I like Naoya well enough, but he doesn’t have your potential. I’m a father, yes, but I’m also the clan head. The future of this family comes first. If you agree to be my successor, I’ll let you borrow any of these cursed tools."

"I refuse," Megumi said flatly.

Naobito frowned. "So you’re happy hiding in Gojo’s shadow? That Satoru is nothing. Once you master Ten Shadows, we could surpass him."

"Are you deaf? I said no," Megumi snapped. Shadows surged toward Naobito on command.

Naobito dodged easily with his technique, then took a long drink from his sake. "I really don’t get your generation. What’s so great about following Gojo Satoru?"

"You want to know?" Megumi asked. He was done listening to the old man’s delusions. "I hate you. I hate this clan. I hate how obsessed you all are with power, how you look down on people without cursed techniques. I hate your disgusting son who doesn’t deserve the air he breathes. I hate your drunk ass that never gave a damn about anyone’s life. You want me to be clan head? Fine. Give me the title and watch me hand it over to Maki."

He launched more shadows. Naobito dodged again, swinging in retaliation, but struck only a fake, just a decoy shadow.

That was Megumi’s chance.

He absorbed the cursed tools into his shadow and bolted for the exit. Nue flew ahead with his phone clutched in its claws. There was no signal underground; they needed to get outside to contact Yuta.

He had barely made it to the corridor when Naobito caught up. The older man slammed a punch into his side, sending him flying toward the wall. Megumi twisted midair and summoned a toad shikigami to break his fall.

Shit. The cursed tools were slowing him down.

"You’ve got guts!" Naobito shouted. "Fine. Since Gojo hasn’t raised you right, I’ll do it myself."

"You don’t get to insult Gojo-sensei, you piece of shit!" Megumi barked. He summoned Rabbit Escape to flood the hallway and overwhelm the older sorcerer. It wouldn’t stop him for long, but Megumi just needed time. Yuta was coming.

But then, a new face appeared.

Zen’in Naoya.

"What’s all this?" he said with that smug, oily grin.

Megumi didn’t hesitate. Divine Dog lunged at Naoya from behind, claws slashing. Naoya dodged, but Megumi used the opening to put more distance between them. Just as he reached the door to the upper chamber, Naobito appeared beside him and drove a fist into his gut.

"Ugh!"

The blow knocked the air from Megumi’s lungs. His body froze up. But before he could hit the ground, a massive hand caught him mid-fall.

Megumi blinked once. Then twice.

Standing there with his katana drawn was Okkotsu Yuta.

"Geez, how many brats are crawling around here today?" Naobito muttered.

"Students always follow their teacher. No wonder they don’t have manners," Naoya added.

They tried to sound unbothered, but it was all bluff. The tension in their shoulders, the flicker in their eyes, special-grade sorcerers weren’t something even top-grade fighters faced lightly.

Megumi grinned. They weren’t getting out of this quietly, but maybe that was fine. Watching these two eat dirt would be worth the noise.

"Sorry for intruding," Yuta said with a smile. "But my kouhai asked for help, and I couldn’t just ignore him."

This sucked.

Mai had shown up at the compound after hearing about the plan to steal cursed tools from the Zen’in clan. Why did it have to be Maki? She knew the place just as well. But of course, it was Maki who got chosen to help Megumi.

She told herself not to go. She tried to walk away. But before she realized it, she was already standing in front of the Zen’in gate.

People here looked down on her, but she was still a Zen’in. Getting in was easy with the excuse of visiting her good-for-nothing mother.

And then she saw it.

Maki being dragged by their father, unconscious and bleeding. A trail of blood followed behind her. Mai didn’t think. Suddenly her gun was in her hand, aimed at him.

She pulled the trigger without hesitation.

Bang.

He blocked the bullet with his sword. His cold, black eyes locked on hers, unreadable.

It was pathetic how quickly he brought her down.

Mai knew Maki would have lasted longer. She always did. She was always stronger.

Their father threw them both into the Disciplinary Pit, the place where they kept the curses. He was talking, saying something or other, but Mai couldn’t hear anything beyond the steady beat of her twin’s heart.

Always so strong.

Mai had always known it would come to this. Maki would be the one to survive. She leaned in and gently brushed her lips against hers.

Maki woke up to the sound of waves and the touch of a breeze on her skin.

A beach?

That didn’t make sense. She was supposed to be locked inside a Zen’in prison. Confused, she turned her head and saw Mai sitting beside her, watching the horizon. Her voice was soft as she explained something about her technique.

"...I'm heavily injured. Once I make this, I'll die."

Maki sat up fast. What was Mai talking about? None of this felt real. Her limbs were heavy and her head was spinning. It took all her strength just to push herself upright. By the time she looked up again, Mai was already walking into the sea.

"Mai! Wait!" Maki called. "Stop saying that. Come back here!"

Mai kept walking. Her voice carried in the wind.

"I know why twins are seen as bad luck for sorcerers. To gain something, we have to lose something else. But that rule doesn’t apply to us." She turned and looked at Maki. "You are me, and I am you."

Maki didn’t care about any of that. She just wanted her sister back. She forced her legs to move, stumbling forward to reach her. Mai raised one hand. Instead of reaching back, she pressed something into Maki’s palm.

"I’ll leave only this. Throw the rest away," she said. "I’ll take the cursed energy with me, but promise me this—"

Everything vanished.

Maki gasped and opened her eyes.

Someone was shaking her.

"Maki-senpai!" Megumi's voice broke through the haze.

She looked up, dazed, then remembered. Her head snapped around.

"Mai!"

Her sister was on the ground, blood trickling from her lips. Nitta crouched beside her, hands glowing faintly as he used his technique.

"I’ve stabilized her for now, but she needs serious help."

Maki crawled closer and placed her fingers on Mai’s neck. One second passed. Then another. She nearly stopped breathing until she finally felt it, a heartbeat, faint but steady.

Relief hit her so hard it almost knocked her over.

"We have to move," someone said.

She looked up to see Yuta. He looked terrible, his face pale and his eyes sunken. Her fingers twitched. There was a sword in her hand, long and unfamiliar. It had to be Mai’s creation.

Maki didn’t know what to do.

One part of her wanted to stand up and slaughter every last Zen’in who ever looked down on them. Another part just wanted to run and never stop until Mai was safe.

In the end, her friends made the choice for her.

Yuta gave a quiet command. Rika lifted Mai in her arms, and together, they fled the Zen’in compound.

When the group returned, they looked awful. Maki had the worst injuries, with Mai close behind. Megumi was roughed up too, shoulders sagging with exhaustion. Yuta and Nitta were physically unharmed, but the weight of what had happened showed clearly in their faces. As soon as Satoru spotted them, he walked over quickly.

“Sensei!” Megumi called out. “The tools—”

“Later,” Satoru cut in. “What’s your condition? Any serious wounds? I’ll contact Shoko and see if she can make it here.”

“I’m fine! But Mai, she needs help!” Maki interrupted, her voice cracking. The girl who had left with a grin now looked like she was falling apart. Satoru pulled her into a hug. She didn’t return it, but she pressed her head against his chest, silent tears soaking his shirt.

"I tried healing her, sensei," Yuta added quietly. "But for some reason, my Reverse Cursed Technique didn’t work on her."

Satoru’s brows pulled into a frown. He turned and gave a quick order. “Uraume, take her to an empty room.”

The monk nodded and carried Mai inside. Maki followed close behind, unwilling to let her sister out of her sight. Satoru then faced the rest of the group.

“How about the rest of you?”

“We’re alright,” Yuta answered. “I got into a brief fight with Naobito-san and Naoya-san, but they didn’t want to push it. I took the chance to escape with Megumi.”

“I’m okay too, Gojo-san,” Nitta added, still a little breathless.

Megumi sighed. “Are you done fussing over us? I really want to drop these cursed tools. They’re heavy.”

“Of course. Thank you for your hard work, Megumi-kun.” Satoru forced a smile, though his mind was far from at ease. Mai’s condition was serious, and he wasn’t sure if Shoko could even make it here. The kids’ sudden escape had probably already reached the elders, and now Nanami and Shoko would be under even tighter surveillance.

Without waiting, Megumi opened his shadow and spat out a mountain of cursed tools into the garden. Even with the heavy atmosphere, everyone was caught off guard by the sheer volume of objects that appeared.

“Is the Bunshin Mirror in here somewhere?” Yuuji mumbled, eyes scanning over the pile.

“I don’t know,” Megumi replied. “I just grabbed everything from the storeroom.”

Everyone pitched in to sort through the cursed tools. It took nearly thirty minutes before they finally found some order. Near the end of the search, Kechizu uncovered a rectangular box.

“This might be it.”

When they opened it, the Bunshin Mirror was inside.

“Thanks, Kechizu!” Yuuji gave the Death Painting a quick hug, then turned his full attention to the object.

Satoru, watching Yuuji’s bright mood, used the chance to text Shoko from his burner phone.

[Kaito: Heya~ Do you have time right now? I’m feeling super lonely.]

[Shoko: Can’t. My boss is being a pain. They’re forcing me to work overtime.]

[Kaito: That’s awful. Can’t you negotiate a bit? I really miss you. Come hang out with me and my friends.]

[Shoko: Sorry. If I don’t become a stellar worker, I might get fired.]

Damn it.

Satoru knew then. Shoko couldn’t come. Sending Mai to a hospital was too risky. The elders were sure to have spies watching. They needed a healer, someone powerful enough to deal with internal damage, maybe even soul damage.

His mind supplied an answer.

Sukuna.

He shut his eyes.

Was he seriously about to rely on the King of Curses to save a student?

Before he could dwell on it longer, Yuuji shouted, “How do I use this?!”

The boy tried sending cursed energy into the Bunshin Mirror, but it ended up being his own. He collapsed on the spot, and a copy of him appeared.

The clone looked around and groaned. “Again?!”

It vanished a second later, and the real Yuuji sat up, clutching his head.

“No luck?” Satoru asked, pocketing his phone.

Megumi shook his head. “He keeps using his own cursed energy.”

“That’s expected,” Satoru said. “We naturally draw from our own reserves. And Yuuji still can’t control Sukuna’s energy.”

“I’m sorry, sensei,” Yuuji muttered, looking down.

Satoru patted his head. “It’s fine. No one gets it right the first time.”

Yuta spoke up. “Is Ieri-san coming?”

Satoru wanted to lie, but he couldn’t. He shook his head. The mood darkened immediately.

“What’s going to happen to Mai then?” Nitta asked. “Should we try a hospital?”

“It won’t help,” Satoru said. “It’s not just physical injuries. She pushed herself too far, used her cursed energy past her limit. Her soul is damaged. Even if she survives, she might fall into a coma.”

Yuuji’s brows drew together. Then his eyes lit up.

“Wait! Sukuna can fix that, right?”

Everyone froze.

Yuta spoke first. “You mean the King of Curses?”

“Yeah!” Yuuji nodded quickly. “You weren’t there, senpai, but he healed Junpei after he got transformed. He also saved Maki-senpai and Nanamin during the Shibuya incident. I don’t know how he does it, but he’s really good at healing!”

“So the question now is whether you can channel his cursed energy into the Bunshin Mirror,” Megumi said.

Yuuji grimaced. “I’ll try my best.”

Nitta hesitated. “Sorry, but... will he even agree? He’s a curse. Why would he help a sorcerer?”

Yuuji grinned. “I’ll convince him! He’ll definitely help.”

No one looked fully convinced, but they had no better option. In the end, everything came back to the same name.

The King of Curses.

Omake:

Satoru: Why is it always Sukuna?

Yuuji: Sukuna we need your help!

Yuta: I don’t really get it, but my kouhai seems to trust the King of Curses…

Megumi: This is a mess.

 

Sukuna: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-!

Chapter Text

Being under so many stares was nerve-wracking, Yuuji knew that he needed to hurry, but he kept pushing his own cursed energy into the Bunshin Mirror. The others tried to give him some suggestions, but no luck. Eventually, he asked if he could go into his room so he could focus. Everyone nodded in understanding, and he quickly ran to his bedroom.

Yuuji sat heavily on his bed and looked down at the small round mirror in his hand. His own face was reflected on its surface and a frown was marring his visage. He closed his eyes and tried to focus. The previous conversation with his teacher resurfaced in his mind.

“Instead of pulling Sukuna’s energy, imagine coaxing it out,” Satoru said. “You know, like a cat.”

“A cat?” Yuuji raised an eyebrow. 

“Dealing with cursed energy is finicky even more so when you are trying to use another person’s. But since you’re sharing a body with Sukuna that should be easier.”

“You’re just making him more confused,” Megumi pointed out.

“But I’m right!” Gojo said.

Yuuji still didn’t fully get it, but he thought he understood some of what his teacher wanted to convey. He was still very new at being a sorcerer so it had taken a lot of effort for him to use his cursed energy. His mastery had improved somewhat, but he knew he was not a master.

This time, instead of pulling out Sukuna’s cursed energy, Yuuji tried to go deep into himself. It took him a while until he could feel that familiar power. Kenjaku’s seal was pushing him back a bit but he could still grasp those wisps of energy. He reminded himself not to be forceful and tried to poke and prod a bit. The power remained static for a long time, and just when Yuuji was losing his patience, he felt it got stronger slightly.

‘Okay, I can do this.’

Sukuna was bored out of his mind. After Kenjaku sealed him, he could no longer contact Yuuji or the outside world. It was like he was suddenly shoved into a small hut in the middle of nowhere surrounded by a blizzard. At first, he had tried to stay calm and collected and examined his current situation. He had tried to push back against the new barrier that stood before him and his vessel but he was immediately pushed back. Trying to stretch out his senses didn’t work either since he couldn’t feel or hear anything from the outside world. 

The only thing that stopped him from going into a panic was the fact that he could still feel Yuuji’s presence. He was sure that his soul was still housed within the teen’s body. So whatever Kenjaku did only strengthened the kid’s natural ability to suppress him to a whole another level. 

Once Sukuna understood his current situation, things became a lot more frustrating and boring. He should have expected that Kenjaku would have a backup plan. That guy might be evil to the bone but he was a genius. Sukuna had wanted to deal with him immediately in Shibuya but now that he was free Sukuna wasn’t sure what he was planning. He doubted that the corpse stealer would let Sukuna and Gojo be.

He might not be the original Sukuna, but he had gained his intelligence and knowledge when he entered this world. Whatever seal Kenjaku put on him wouldn’t last forever. Kenjaku had to be certain that Sukuna would side with him so he didn’t spend too much time perfecting this seal. Sukuna knew that he only had to be patient. In the worst-case scenario, the seal should break down naturally after several months. 

That knowledge did nothing to stave off the boredom that immediately plagued him. Staring at blood lake and piles of bones was never his preferred activity, but that was all he could do. Sukuna had gotten so bored that he actually tried to change his inner domain. No luck. As much as he hated to admit it, this domain was a reflection of himself. Since he had combined with the original, all the sins and predispositions that bastard had developed had staked themselves on him too. Well, he was also stubborn.

Although Sukuna couldn’t change the scenery, he could create some small stuff. His latest creation was a small plushie in the shape of a white cat with one eye. He glared down at the thing as he firmly grasped it in his hand.

“You, I hate you.” Sukuna stabbed the eye with his long nail. “Why did you have to create that smug genius bastard, huh? You’re causing so much trouble for me. I had a plan you know. But that brain had to be smart enough to wiggle his way out. Now I have to chase him around and kill him before he disappears. Who knows what kind of deranged plan he will cook up next?”

The one-eyed cat could only stare blankly as Sukuna strangled it. He pulled its whiskers. Threw it like a basketball at various bones. Stomped it under his feet. After several minutes of torturing the doll, he ended up destroying it to shreds after he realized how unsightly he was acting. He was the King of Curses. He had an image. 

Sukuna sighed and slouched on his throne. He hated this. He hated staring at the black unending sky. He hated looking at the damned pond of blood. He was starting to consider drowning himself in the lake when he suddenly felt a poke.

Sukuna blinked at looked up. Huh? 

Another poke.

His eyes widened as he stood up. He wasn’t imagining things. Was Yuuji trying to contact him? He couldn’t tell. The seal was still suppressing his senses, but he was sure that he felt a weird poking at his cursed energy. He didn’t know what the kid was trying to do, and it wasn’t as if he could respond. So his only option was to flare up his power. It was hard. The seal was still restricting him, and it was like trying to claw your way out of a collapsed cave.

Yuuji had to have received the message since the poking turned into a light pull. It was less of a yank and more of an invitation. Sukuna frowned. He still wasn’t sure what was going on but it wasn’t as if he had anything better to do. He followed the direction the pulling was telling him to go. 

Sukuna couldn’t sweat since he didn’t have a body. He was merely a projection of his own mind in this inner domain. However, he was struggling so hard against the seal that he was wheezing. It wasn’t physical pain. Those he could handle. The barrier was pushing down on his soul and it was much more painful than any flesh wound. Fuck. Damn you Kenjaku. When he got out, he would make that brain pay. Despite the pain he was feeling, he kept pushing forward. 

He reached out and finally grasped something.

Suddenly, Sukuna found himself staring down at Yuuji. The boy was sitting on the bed while he was standing before him. The two blinked at each other for a moment. Then, a bright smile blossomed on the teen’s face as he stretched out his hands wide open.

“You’re here!” Yuuji exclaimed.

Sukuna was so stunned at the sudden change that he had no time to dodge the hug. Yuuji wrapped his arms around him tightly and pushed his head into his chest. Sukuna was still blinking as he took in his surroundings. He wasn’t in Yuuji’s dorm room. The place looked much more expensive. So, they were certainly not in Jujutsu High.

When his instinct finally kicked in, Sukuna pushed the kid away. Yuuji released his hold and eagerly met his glare. “What the hell did you do?”

“The Bunshin Mirror worked!” Yuuji raised a small cursed object shaped like a mirror to him. “Gojo-sensei said that since he couldn’t break the seal, we can use this thing to workaround it and pull you out!”

Sukuna stared at his reflection in the mirror. He was looking more like Yuuji than the King of Curses at the moment. There were no iconic tattoos and his secondary eyes remained closed. Though, strangely enough, he still had red eyes instead of Yuuji’s golden orbs.

“We actually have to steal it from the Zen’in clan. Megumi and Maki-senpai were the ones infiltrating the compound. Wait, you’ve to help us!” Yuuji got up from the bed with an urgent look. “One of the students got hurt during the mission. And since we’re hiding from the higher-ups, we can’t ask Ieri-san for help. Mai-san is still hurt, but you can heal her, right?”

Oh. So things had turned out somewhat similar with canon after Sukuna got sealed away by Kenjaku. He didn’t believe that Yuta killed Yuuji since he would’ve felt something that extreme, but Maki still ended up storming the Zen’in clan. Her goal was the same, but she had Megumi’s help this time. 

Sukuna was trying to find a way to keep up his pretense while agreeing to Yuuji’s request when Gojo barged in. The white-haired man slammed the door open with unnecessary force. “Yuuji-kun! I heard your yelling, what’s going on?” Red eyes and blue orbs clashed. A taunting smirk soon appeared on Gojo’s face. “Finally done napping, oh King of Curses? How did it feel being grounded by your old pal?”

Sukuna had no doubt that Gojo had registered his presence the moment he manifested using the cursed object. The man had merely pretended to be surprised since he always had a flair for dramatics.

“Sorcerer,” Sukuna drily replied.

Yuuji quickly stood between the two adults while spreading his arms open. Shooting a pleading look at his teacher, he said, “Please stop teasing Sukuna, sensei! We still need to help Mai-san!”

Gojo pouted. “You don’t need to remind me, Yuuji. I was about to bring up that topic, just now.”

Liar. Sukuna wasn’t blind to Gojo’s dislike of him. If he had to compare, then the man actually had a lower opinion of him than the original Sukuna before the whole Shinjuku showdown. In the canon, the King of Curses was blatantly evil so Gojo knew what he was dealing with. On the other hand, Sukuna was acting quite well toward Yuuji so it wasn’t strange the sorcerer was more wary about his possible hidden motive.  

“You want me to save another brat?” Sukuna asked, shoving his hands into his pockets.

“Think you can’t do it?” Gojo threw another taunt which earned him another look from Yuuji. “We’ve already got you out of that prison, so why don’t you repay the favor by helping a junior, hmm?”

Sukuna could agree, but he also wanted to know how far Gojo would take this banter. He tilted his head and sent him a flat stare. “Or what?” 

Gojo’s grin became sharp. The small amount of cursed energy that was no longer sealed by the Soul Piercing Blade sparked. Sukuna’s eyes narrowed in anticipation as his hands flexed within his pockets.

Gojo’s finger twitched into a familiar shape of his Red technique and started, “Or-”

“Sukuna!” Yuuji turned around to face him and grasped Sukuna’s upper arms. His bright golden eyes were wide open as he sent a pleading look at him. “Please do this for me?”

Sukuna’s face scrunched. He wanted to say how dared the kid demand something from the King of Curses, but he knew the situation was dire, and he couldn’t waste more time. In the end, he sighed and said, “Fine.”

Yuuji beamed a wide smile. “Thank you!” Without wasting any more time, he herded the two adults out of the room. Several people were standing in the hallway, and most of them stiffened when they saw Sukuna. The only exception was Uraume who quickly approached him and started to follow from behind.

“Sukuna-sama,” Uraume said with a slightly bowed head.

“Uraume,” Sukuna greeted back. The curse user had followed his order so he would give him some face.

Megumi had his familiar pinched face that he always had whenever he was facing Sukuna. Nobara was staring straight at him with narrowed eyes. Yuta and Junpei had slightly widened eyes as they examined the King of Curses; this was their first time meeting him after all. There was also another student there. It took Sukuna several seconds before he remembered the name of the kid, Arata Nitta, the one with the Pain Killer cursed technique. So that was how they prevented Mai from dying.

Sukuna also saw Choso and his brothers. They were standing slightly farther away from the group, but he could feel the animosity from the eldest brother. Heh. Sukuna felt slightly disappointed that he hadn’t been there to see how Yuuji had reacted to the news about having nine extra siblings. 

Despite the unease, nobody stopped Yuuji as he led Sukuna toward the room where Mai was held. Maki looked up from her hunched sitting position when she felt several people coming in. Her red-rimmed eyes widened when she saw Sukuna.

“I did it, Maki-senpai,” Yuuji said. “Sukuna also agreed to heal Mai-san. So you don’t need to worry anymore.”

Maki couldn’t muster a smile and could only nod. Sukuna didn’t bother to greet her and stood beside the sleeping girl. He narrowed his eyes as he examined her condition. Nobody said a word as the King of Curses continued to stare at the wounded teen.

Seconds filled with tension ticked by before Maki lost her patience and asked, “Are you going to heal her or what?”

Sukuna turned his gaze to the teen. “I can’t heal her.”

Everyone was shocked at the statement. Maki immediately grabbed his collar in rage and pulled him toward her. Uraume hissed beside him and the temperature dropped. The monk was about to attack when Sukuna gave a warning glance which made them stop.

Maki screamed at Sukuna, “What the hell?! Didn’t you heal me and Nanami-san when we were literally burned to death? Why can’t you heal Mai?!”

All eyes were wide open at Maki’s display of aggression. On one hand, they were surprised at how daring the teen was. On the other hand, they couldn’t believe the King of Curses let someone manhandle him like this.

“Let me change that statement,” Sukuna calmly replied, “I can heal her flesh wounds, but I cannot retrieve her soul.”

Maki frowned in confusion. “What?”

If the events that occurred what somewhat similar to canon, then that process had already happened. Sukuna continued, “You’re twins correct? Then you must have known that you two are one being.” He pointed his finger at the Split Soul Katana leaning on the bed. “When your sister created that weapon, she did not only imbue her cursed energy; a part of her soul also attached herself to it. Not only that, but some part of her also returned to you. When humans die, our souls will usually leave their bodies to enter the cycle of reincarnation, but twins are different. You are connected.”

This time, Sukuna pointed at Mai. “I can see it. She has started to join you, and there isn’t much of her left inside that body. If you wish, I can try to rip out your sister’s soul, but I cannot know for sure if that won’t destroy her completely. Even then, that will only be part of her since that sword also contains her being. Do you see? Even if I heal her body, she will only remain in a coma, never to wake up. It is best to let the process complete itself.”

Maki’s eyes widened in horror. Her grip loosened as she stared down at her sister. “Why… why did she do that?”

When tears began to come out of Maki’s eyes, everyone began to panic. Yuuji looked especially horrible since he had promised that Sukuna could help Mai. Gojo and Yuta took a step toward the crying teen, when Sukuna said, “Why don’t you ask her yourself?”

The King of Curses raised two of his fingers and placed them on her forehead. The girl immediately lost consciousness and collapsed. Gojo quickly caught her body and he glared up at Sukuna, “What did you do?”

“I’m merely resonating their souls. It’s better if she speaks to her sister herself.” Sukuna stuffed his hands back into his pockets as he strode out. Everyone moved away from him, creating a clear path. He could feel Uraume following behind, but he kept walking outside. He needed some time to think.

Maki found herself back on the beach and felt a familiar presence sitting beside her. She quickly got up to see Mai sitting in the same position as before. “Mai!”

“Maki,” her sister said, looking at her.

“You idiot!” Maki grasped the other teen’s shoulders tightly. “Why the hell did you make that sword?! If you had just waited a bit longer, Yuta could’ve saved us! You-”

“That doesn’t matter,” Mai cut in.

“Of course it does! You’re going to die now, and there’s nothing I can do!” Maki said. Tears began to pour out. Goddamn it. She hated crying. It was useless, but there was nothing else she could do now. Her sister was going to die no matter what.

“Didn’t you hear what I said?” Mai pursed her lips. “You won’t be able to realize your full potential with me around.”

“You think I care about that?!” Maki asked. “Why do you think I left the clan? It’s because I wanted to create a better place for you! If I were stronger, then those old fools wouldn’t be able to demean and hurt you.”

“I know.” Mai smiled softly. “Or well, I know now. I didn’t before. I thought you just left me because you were sick of me following you around.”

“Of course not!” Maki frowned. There was no way she could ever think of her twin like that. “You’re my sister! I had to leave you because I didn’t want to drag you into danger. I know you hate fighting!”

“Well, you never told me that,” Mai replied, crossing her arms. “You just told Naobito that you wanted to be a sorcerer and left me.”

“And then you joined the Kyoto branch,” Maki shot back.

“I guess that’s why we’re twins.” Mai grinned. “Too similar for our own good.”

The two stopped talking for a moment. They gazed at each other while listening to the soft sound of crashing waves. 

Maki lowered her head and said, “I just want you to be happy.”

“I know.” Mai grasped her right hand, which had fallen from her shoulder. “You know, I was about to tell you to destroy everything. I hated them. Those idiots in the clan. I wanted to burn it all down. I still do. But well…” She took a deep breath and exhaled. “... I realized how much of a curse it would be. Then, I heard how you sobbed pitifully beside my body. It was really pathetic. And you know, that might’ve kicked some sense into me.”

Maki raised her head and met Mai’s smiling face. Her sister raised her hand and caressed her face. “Instead, I’m going to tell you to live and get stronger. Show those fools who you actually are. I can’t do it, but you can Maki. You’ve always been more stubborn and stronger than me.”

“... But I don’t want you to go,” Maki protested.

“But I’m not going anywhere,” Mai said as she pressed her forehead against hers. “I’m here, aren’t I? I’m always with you.”

Nobody dared to stop the King of Curses as he exited the building and headed toward the garden. Uraume followed him dutifully and the two stopped to stand on top of the bridge above the pond. Sukuna examined the environment with great interest but did not say anything. Silence reigned for a long time before the man spoke, “You have questions.”

Uraume kept their head low. They had a lot, but they were used to keep them all to themselves and follow their master’s orders obediently. Sukuna was not a kind or generous master. He did not appreciate any sign of disrespect and would cut down anyone who had caused him the slightest displeasure. The monk knew to keep their mouth tightly shut but they also understood that Sukuna had given them a chance to speak up. 

Uraume pondered over their words. After the sudden change of plans to move against Kenjaku. Although the King of Curses had no friends, that curse user had been one of the few people who had an amicable relationship with Sukuna. Kenjaku’s goal to begin the new era of curses also matched Sukuna’s desire to fight powerful foes. Yet, right after the curse’s revival, he had changed his mind immediately. 

The monk had struggled to find a reason for this change of attitude. They believed they had gotten a glimpse of the truth when they heard Sukuna’s command to protect his vessel. Could it be? The thought seemed ridiculous.

“You care about Itadori Yuuji,” Uraume eventually said.

It wasn’t spoken like a question, but Sukuna caught the why that was left unsaid. The curse didn’t respond for a moment and kept staring at the fish swimming in the pond. After another second passed, he said, “Unfortunately.” 

Sukuna sat on the bridge railing and placed one foot up. With his elbow resting on his knee, he placed his head on his palm. “Ridiculous, isn’t it?”

Uraume wasn’t sure how to respond. Frankly, the thought of the King of Curses caring about human life was unimaginable. During all their years of following their master, they had seen numerous lives being extinguished with a mere flick of Sukuna’s fingers. The King of Curses shed no tears for anyone. He had not cared for any being except himself. The only things that mattered were his pleasures and displeasures, and most beings never failed to make themselves an annoyance to the curse. 

Sukuna did not seem to mind the lack of response from Uraume. He kept staring at the surroundings calmly. This was also new. The monk had followed their master for many years and he had always worn detached expressions. His eyes would always glide over everything without an ounce of care or interest. Only on rare occasions would those fiery red orbs spark with joy. Those moments only happened during intense battles, where the King of Curses was pushed to his limits. Yet, somehow, Uraume was able to find that spark as Sukuna sat there in this peaceful environment. 

It was nowhere near the inner flame that burst forth when he was fighting, yet it wasn’t the dead unfeeling coldness that often plagued the King of Curses during the majority of his days. If they had to find a word for it then it might be ‘peace.’ How strange. Although the King of Curses had been powerful and could obtain anything he wished, there was no denying that there had been an ever-present unrest within the man. It was as if he had been fleeting from each moment in his life as he searched for that unreachable high. Yet, now, Uraume could find none of that feeling within Sukuna. Although the curse was a lot weaker and bound, there was no lingering dissatisfaction and boredom against the world.

Uraume couldn’t understand this change of character. Could it be the side effect of being incarnated? Yet, the curse user hadn’t experienced the same event when they were reborn in this modern era. Then again, Sukuna’s situation was different. While the King of Curses was suppressed within his vessel, Uraume had completely overwritten their host. 

There was also that connection between Yuuji and Sukuna. Although they were not related by blood, the monk couldn’t deny that there were remarkable physical similarities between the teen and the original body of the King of Curses.

“So, what are you going to do now?” Sukuna asked with a tilt of his head.

Uraume blinked, not understanding.

“Truthfully speaking, the King of Curses that you once knew is gone,” the man continued, red eyes staring straight into the monk. “Not completely, perhaps. But I doubt that I shall return to my old ways of rampage and death. I do not believe you shall experience anything interesting if you stick around.”

Uraume did not understand. Was Sukuna content to continue staying inside Yuuji’s body and never regaining his full freedom? Did he not care of the threats from the sorcerers? Could he value his vessel that much?

New questions began to emerge within Uraume’s mind, yet Sukuna did not wait for them to answer. “Let us speak straightforwardly. I no longer need your service, Uraume. You are free to leave me if you wish. There is no need for you to follow me like a leashed dog.”

Uraume felt their heart drop. Sukuna was… dismissing them? They pursed their lips. “Are you displeased with me, Sukuna-sama?”

“No,” Sukuna said, scratching his chin. “Truthfully, you have been outstanding. That is why I grant you this boon. I shall not hunt you down, and you can live this second life as you wish. You do not need to serve me any longer. After all, times have changed and the world has many things to offer. Instead of following me, you can go and experience them.”

Uraume lowered their head. It sounded like a grace, yet it did not feel as such to them. They had been following the King of Curses for many years, and they could not imagine any other life.

“Of course, I shall not show you mercy should you decide to hunt down the brat,” Sukuna added, with a sharp grin. “But I doubt you are that foolish.”

Uraume rubbed the edge of their long sleeves. The King of Curses seemed to greatly care about his vessel. As long as Yuuji wished to stay with the sorcerers and held high morals, Sukuna would not move his hands. Yet that weakness would be a great danger to him. The curse user did not believe the King of Curses was unaware of the dangers from the sorcerers, but he did not overtly discourage them either. 

Eventually, Uraume said, “I still wish to follow you, Sukuna-sama.”

“Are you sure?” Sukuna replied. “I do not think following teenagers around is that interesting, and those sorcerers will not accept you with open arms. You’re putting yourself at a lot of risk should you continue serving me.”

“My only wish is to serve you, Sukuna-sama,” Uraume replied while performing a dogeza. 

Sukuna clicked his tongue. “Stop with the bowing, I have no patience for it. Fine, if you insist, I shall not discourage you further.”

Uraume stood up but stayed close to their master. The two continued to stay there in silence.

Satoru didn’t follow when Sukuna left with his lackey. His Six Eyes still tracked their presence, and the two of them stopped in the garden. He had no interest in dealing with the curse when his student was unconscious. The only thing that stopped him from chasing after the King of Curses was Nobara’s assurances that Maki should wake up after a few minutes.

“Itadori was also like this,” Nobara said.

Yuuji looked torn between chasing after Sukuna and staying beside his senior. In the end, he chose to stand with the group of sorcerers as they waited for the girl to wake up. Minutes passed as Maki continued to stay unconscious while tears flowed down from her closed eyelids. Satoru gently wiped them away; his heart hurting seeing his student being so sad. Maki had always preferred to hold herself straight and shoved her emotions aside. To see her being like this was strange and heartbreaking.

Then, Maki’s eyes began to twitch behind her eyelids and they began to slip open. The girl continued to stare at the ceiling and didn’t speak for a while. Satoru was about to ask about her condition when the girl spoke up, “... Nitta.”

“U-um, yes?” the Kyoto student took a step closer to the teen.

“Release your technique,” Maki said.

“Eh?” Everyone blinked in surprise. 

“A-are you sure?” Nitta stuttered out. “If I do that, then Mai-”

“That’s what she wants, so…” Maki slowly got up. Her body was shaking, so Satoru lightly grabbed her upper arm to help her stand. The teen turned to her sleeping twin with a blank face.

Nitta threw glances at everyone before landing on Satoru. The kid was not sure whether or not he should be listening to someone who was emotionally distressed. Satoru pursed his lips. He felt like it wasn’t his place to decide on this matter. Since Maki had decided then they should respect her choice. Satoru gave a nod to Nitta, and the boy breathed out. He approached the dying girl and finally released his cursed technique.

Mai’s weak breathing became slower and slower. Eventually, it stopped altogether. Maki kept staring at her twin and did not say anything. She raised her hand and lightly fixed her sister’s bangs. “Goodnight, Mai.”

Then, the girl turned toward the group and asked, “Where’s Sukuna?”

“Outside, in the garden,” Satoru replied.

Maki nodded and then walked out. The group followed her outside since they weren’t comfortable letting her confront the King of Curses alone. The curse hadn’t shown any hostility so far, but they never knew if he would switch his attitude.

Uraume turned their gaze toward the approaching group, while Sukuna continued to look at the horizon. The curse looked awfully at ease despite being surrounded by sorcerers and heavily weakened. 

“Have you finished saying your goodbyes?” Sukuna asked.

“Yeah…” Maki said. “Thanks for helping me speak to her.”

“I do not need your gratitude,” Sukuna replied, finally turning his head to look at them. “Consider it a repayment for pulling me out of that jail.” The man jumped off and stood on his feet. “Instead of wasting our time, how about we finally talk about the whole reason why you sorcerers risk breaking me out of that seal?” He grinned, stuffing his hands in his pockets. “Let us speak about Kenjaku.”
Notes:

    The whole twin thing is confusing lol. Sukuna’s twin is able to reincarnate without Sukuna, but we can see Mai talking with Maki after her death. That means she still remains with Maki somewhat.

    Also, please remember this is not a crack fic. The omake is only inner monologues and I just made them for fun. Sukuna will never act so ridiculously. When he joins the group, he's gonna suffer with Megumi as they deal with the trio shenanigans.

Chapter Text

The group went to the living room to hold their conversation. Although no one showed any sign of aggression, the sorcerers were still a bit on edge. How could they not be, when they were facing the King of Curses? While the man was very weakened, he still exuded a powerful aura that made everyone uneasy except for Satoru, Yuuji, and Uraume.

Sukuna sat down gracefully on one of the seats while Uraume stood behind his right side. Satoru took the liberty of sitting right in front of the curse. While Sukuna sat with grace, the sorcerer slouched lazily, radiating irreverence. Albeit temporarily stripped of most of their powers, these two were still the strongest beings on the planet in this modern era. Watching them face each other was an interesting yet terrifying sight. Nobody wanted to imagine the level of destruction they could cause if they fought with their full might.

Since there weren’t enough seats for everyone, some had to stand. Nobody dared sit beside Sukuna until Yuuji decided to plop down. Despite Yuuji repeatedly glancing at him, the King of Curses kept his gaze fixed forward.

Silence reigned for a moment until Satoru broke it with a nonchalant voice. “So, anything good you can tell us about your old pal?”

Sukuna replied, “Kenjaku is a master of barriers and seals. I would argue he could rival even Tengen in this art.”

The sorcerers stiffened at those words. Tengen was considered the greatest barrier user in the world. Their knowledge and experience, due to immortality, had made them one of the pillars of the Jujutsu world. Although the sorcerers couldn’t believe such ridiculous words, the one stating them was Sukuna, a master known to have reached the pinnacle of Jujutsu sorcery.

“His goal is to optimize cursed energy,” Sukuna continued. “To accomplish that, he plans to merge all humans in Japan with Tengen.”

Everyone’s mouth went agape at the proclamation. That sounded crazy and illogical. Who would be mad enough to think about doing such a thing? Whatever creature was born from that event would be monstrous and nothing human, something closer to a cursed spirit. The birth of this beast would mean the beginning of the end for humankind on earth.

“How the hell does he plan to do that?” Satoru frowned. “That type of event would require a ridiculous amount of cursed energy.”

Sukuna placed his head on his hand. “By starting the Culling Game.”

The Culling Game? Even from its title, everyone knew it was bad news. Kenjaku’s grand plan would no doubt demand countless deaths and suffering.

“Care to share more?” Satoru asked.

Sukuna glanced at Uraume, who immediately spoke up to answer, “Kenjaku has set up several barriers across Japan that he can activate at any time. There will be ten colonies in total. He has set up two in Tokyo, but you can find one in Sendai, Sakurajima, and Lake Gosho. There are more, but I shall skip that for now. Ancient sorcerers who made deals with Kenjaku in the past will become Culling Game players. However, that brain also wants to force newly awakened humans to join this ritual.”

“Newly awakened?” Junpei muttered.

“Yes, people like you,” Uraume said. “With Mahito’s soul manipulation ability, Kenjaku wishes to remotely cast Idle Transfiguration on those he has marked. He wants those new and ancient sorcerers to fight battles to the death.”

Nobody could speak. This horrible ritual would undoubtedly generate an enormous amount of cursed energy. When forced into a life-or-death situation, humans create overwhelming negative emotions. Forcing them to fight each other in this Culling Game was both the best and the most horrible way to accomplish Kenjaku’s ridiculous dream.

“So that’s why he picked Suguru’s body,” Satoru said lowly as his fists tightened. His departed best friend hadn’t become a special-grade sorcerer just because of his strength. The potential of his cursed technique had been another important factor that made the elders think so highly of him: the ability to tame and use any cursed spirits. If Kenjaku had absorbed Mahito, then he could have obtained the curse’s deadly technique.

“But that’s impossible, right?” Yuuji exclaimed. “Sukuna already exorcised Mahito!”

“Yes, Sukuna-sama eliminated that issue,” Uraume agreed. “However, I do not believe Kenjaku will give up so easily.”

Sukuna said, “That brain has had a thousand years to mull over his plan. Mahito was merely the easiest path to reach his goal, but I know he has backup plans already prepared.”

“You think he’ll still start the Culling Game?” Yuta asked with a deep furrow.

Sukuna shook his head. “I do not think so. At this point, it is too risky to start that stage of his plan. His first priority will be to remove me and Gojo from the equation. As long as he can kill us, there is not much that can stand in his way.”

“But we’re in hiding,” Megumi said from beside Satoru. “As long as we keep our heads down, Kenjaku won’t be able to track us.”

“Did you forget we just broke into the Zen’in clan?” Maki asked, leaning against the wall with her arms crossed.

The other three sorcerers who went on that mission wore awkward expressions. They certainly hadn’t tried to be lowkey when they escaped the compound. Kenjaku should have caught wind of their activities by now.

“But as long as he doesn’t know our exact location, shouldn’t it be okay?” Nobara said. Yeah. They could just wait patiently for the effects of the Soul Piercing Blade to wear off, and then Satoru could handle everything. Kenjaku might have taken him by surprise once, but he wouldn’t fall into the same trap again.

“He won’t try to search for us,” Sukuna replied. “I suspect he will instead attempt to draw us out. That will give him an edge, after all.”

“Draw us out?” Yuuji tilted his head.

Sukuna crossed his arms and leaned back in his chair. “I believe the best thing he could do now is use one of the barriers he set up. Then, he will use the humans trapped in the area as bait and repeat what happened in Shibuya.”

“But aren’t all the special grade spirits gone? He’ll be alone now,” Junpei said. “Although Gojo-sensei is weakened, if we gather enough sorcerers, we can easily handle him.”

Sukuna clicked his tongue. “You are underestimating Kenjaku. Although he is not as powerful as me or Gojo, he is still one of the strongest sorcerers in the modern era. What he lacks in strength, he compensates for with intellect. If you let your guard down even once, he will exploit it and turn the battle in his favor. Also, who said he’ll be alone?”

“What? Did you have other pals you haven’t told us about?” Satoru asked. “Another corpse stealer running around?”

“Don’t be daft,” Sukuna replied. “This is only based on my instinct, but if I’m correct, Kenjaku will likely try to awaken some of the ancient sorcerers. Since they made deals with him, they would have no choice but to follow his orders.”

The mood in the room immediately dropped when they heard those words. A group of ancient sorcerers running amok in the modern era? Although humans love to put themselves above beasts and cursed spirits, they cannot deny that human history is filled with blood and tragedies. Those powerful sorcerers born ages ago would not share the same beliefs and morals as modern sorcerers. Just look at Sukuna, known as a cannibal and slaughterer who killed anyone who crossed his path. Releasing people with that same mindset would be bad news, to put it lightly.

“None of them are at my level,” Sukuna continued, “but they could certainly cause problems. I can think of several who would become headaches. Hmm. Come to think of it, Uraume, what other mischief has Kenjaku been up to?”

“He has done a lot of things, Sukuna-sama,” Uraume replied, “but if I had to pick, the biggest factor that may cause us trouble is the governments of foreign countries.”

… Huh?

“Excuse me?” Satoru asked. “We’re talking about the Jujutsu world here. What do regular governments have to do with us?”

Uraume quickly elaborated, “As part of his preparation for the Culling Game, Kenjaku has contacted several powerful governments to throw more regular humans into the colonies. He revealed the existence of the Jujutsu world and convinced them they could use sorcerers as a possible energy source. They are now planning to send soldiers to kidnap as many sorcerers as possible for experimentation.”

Sukuna chuckled darkly. “Like lambs to the slaughter. They enter the game expecting to be the hunters, yet they become the prey.”

All the sorcerers went utterly pale after hearing Uraume’s explanation. This whole conversation had been one bad news after another. Just when they thought they understood Kenjaku’s plan, Sukuna revealed another part of the scheme. A week ago, they had known nothing about this. If the King of Curses hadn’t suddenly switched sides, their situation would be worse than bad. The Jujutsu world would likely already be on the edge of destruction.

“So it’s not only Kenjaku you have to deal with,” Sukuna continued. “That man will likely try to rope those governments into his plan. And let’s not forget, some of your higher-ups are also controlled by Kenjaku. I suspect the Kamo clan is fully in his pocket, and I doubt you can seek help from the Zen’in clan after your recent robbery. You won’t receive much aid from your fellow sorcerers.” He grinned. “What will you do now?”

The young students exchanged anxious glances while Satoru stared straight at the King of Curses. “Then we will fight. But I still want to try to find Kenjaku first. It would be best if we could apprehend him before he opens that barrier. Dragging more civilians into this is not ideal. However, we must prepare for the worst-case scenario.”

“Worst case?” Nobara asked.

Satoru nodded and looked at his students. “You’ll need to be ready to defeat those ancient sorcerers. I’d rather not involve you guys in this, but I have a feeling we won’t have enough manpower. Nanami, Kusakabe, Utahime, and Yaga will certainly help, but I’ll need to pay Mei Mei to get her cooperation.”

“I think Ino-san will help since Nanami-san will join us,” Megumi said.

“Maybe I can try to convince Miguel to lend a hand,” Yuta murmured. “But to be honest, he really doesn’t want to see you, sensei.”

Satoru stuck out his tongue. Not his fault that the guy had sided with a terrorist and that he’d suffered a personal beating from the strongest sorcerer. That foreign curse user got off lightly since Satoru let him get away by accompanying Yuta while he was in Africa.

“Whatever,” Satoru said, crossing his arms. “I’ll have to contact Tsukumo too. That woman may be unreliable most of the time, but she’ll help if she knows what’s at stake.”

“What about the Kyoto students?” Nobara asked.

“I don’t think they can provide much help in terms of fighting power,” Maki said. “Todo was their strongest fighter, but after he lost his left hand...”

Yuuji whipped his head toward Sukuna. His eyes widened into that familiar pleading look Satoru liked to call the Ultimate Puppy Eyes™.

Sukuna narrowed his eyes. “What?”

“You can heal him, right?” Yuuji asked eagerly, leaning toward the King of Curses.

Sukuna’s face scrunched in deep distaste. “What makes you think I’m a personal healer you can command around?”

“I’ll buy you that mochi you like,” Yuuji replied.

“I’m not like your stupid teacher whom you can bribe with sweets,” Sukuna shot back.

First of all, Satoru wasn’t stupid. Second, those sweets were absolutely worth it, especially Kikufuku Mochi. Third, it was quite ridiculous how quickly the King of Curses was folding like a stack of wet paper under the weight of Yuuji’s stare.

“How about I make you some bento?” Yuuji tried again.

“I have Uraume,” Sukuna replied.

“I promise I won’t force you to watch another Lord of the Rings marathon.”

“I’m no longer stuck in your body. You can waste your time however you like.”

“Sukuna...”

“Brat.”

The two entered a staredown. Although the King of Curses looked fierce with his sharp red eyes, Satoru easily noticed he was on the losing side. Two seconds passed before Sukuna turned his head away and clicked his tongue. “Fine, but I promise nothing. Make sure that brat comes here quickly since I don’t know how long his soul remembers its original shape.”

“Yay!” Yuuji cheered and actually tried to hug the King of Curses. The man stiffened and immediately kicked the kid’s chair, causing him to tumble to the ground.

“Keep your filthy hands off me,” Sukuna hissed.

Yuuji got up and righted his seat but didn’t look mad at the harsh response. In fact, there was a small smile on the boy’s face. The other students watched with wide eyes and open mouths.

“Wow, he stands no chance against Yuuji,” Junpei whispered.

“What the hell? Is he a shōjo protagonist or something?” Nobara muttered.

Megumi’s eyes twitched while Yuta gave a weak laugh. Maki said nothing but raised her eyebrows high. Satoru could hear Choso muttering about wanting Yuuji to hug him. The King of Curses certainly did not miss these words and shot a venomous look promising a world of pain. The kids immediately stopped their gossip.

Satoru tried to fake a laugh into a cough, but the other man gave him a disgusted stare. He still wasn’t sure about the strange relationship between Yuuji and Sukuna. Sure, they had some sort of familial connection, but was that enough for someone as evil as the King of Curses? He had done his research when Yuuji came under his care, and all the tales painted Sukuna as a heartless person who only cared for himself.

“Anyway, what about you, oh King of Curses?” Satoru asked. “Are you going to stay back and watch the chaos?”

“I doubt Kenjaku will let me go,” Sukuna replied. “I will be drawn into this fight since that brain will want to eliminate the two of us in one go. He will likely order the ancient sorcerers to hunt us down.”

“About those sorcerers,” Megumi cut in, drawing the attention of the two adults. “Are they going to be awakened using that seal?”

Satoru stiffened when his mind immediately understood what his ward was implying.

“Yes,” Sukuna replied. “The seal on your sister’s forehead is meant to adjust her brain so she can become a vessel. Nothing like the brat, of course, but it will make her strong enough to house an incarnated being like myself.”

“But that means—!” Megumi stood up from his seat. His hands were shaking, and his face became deadly pale.

Satoru stopped breathing for a second. If Tsumiki became a vessel, then they would have to kill her. That was the proper procedure when a sorcerer encountered a vessel for curses. Yuuji had also faced the same fate after ingesting one of Sukuna’s Fingers. Death by execution. The only reason the boy survived was because Satoru had demanded it.

“Why didn’t you tell me about this back then?!” Megumi stepped toward the King of Curses, his expression thunderous with rage.

“There was no point,” Sukuna shrugged. “Even if I told you, none of you can remove that seal. Your sister’s fate has been decided.”

“You bastard!” Megumi swung a punch, but Uraume appeared and caught the oncoming fist. The monk’s expression was grave, but they did nothing to retaliate.

Uraume glared as they tightened the hand holding Megumi’s wrist. “Watch the words you speak toward Sukuna-sama.”

“Let the kid go, Uraume,” Sukuna said calmly despite the clear disrespect.

The curse user pursed their lips but released their hold. They shot a warning look before stepping back to stand behind their master again. Megumi was still angry, but he did not try to strike the King of Curses again.

Despite the dark looks he received, Sukuna explained in a bland tone, “Although your sister will no doubt be involved in the unraveling chaos, I never said she is doomed to die.”

“What do you mean?” Satoru demanded. As far as he knew, there was no safe method to remove incarnated curses from their vessels. The moment a human was taken over, there was no hope for them. That was why his plan for Yuuji was to indefinitely postpone his execution until he could dig up a method to remove Sukuna from him.

“While an incarnated curse can take over the vessel’s body, as long as the original soul still exists, there is hope for them to return.” Sukuna raised his index finger. “One simply needs to strike the connection between the incarnated being and the human soul to break the balance and expel the curse.”

Souls. Those pesky things again. Although Satoru could manifest Infinity into reality, there was nothing he could do to souls except blast them to oblivion. First, that special grade. Next, Sukuna’s soul-related abilities. And finally, those annoying incarnated ancient sorcerers from the past.

“So you can remove the incarnated being from Tsumiki-san?” Yuuji asked eagerly. Satoru closed his eyes, expecting the curse to say yes. They had been relying on the King of Curses too much these days. Shouldn’t their job be to exorcise this damned being? Yet here they were pleading with him to help. But… as long as Tsumiki could survive, Satoru didn’t mind making a deal with the devil.

“I can’t,” Sukuna replied.

“Eh?” Yuuji and Satoru said in unison.

Sukuna explained, “Due to Kenjaku’s seal, my pool of cursed energy is extremely shallow. Even maintaining a connection to this copy has consumed a lot from this meager reservoir. If I have to use Soul Dismantle on an incarnated being, I will no longer be able to maintain this body and will be immediately sent back.”

“But you have another method, right?” Megumi demanded. The teen had always preferred to be level-headed, but his sister was always an exception. It was rare for Satoru to see him so restless and anxious.

“The task to strip the incarnated being away will fall on the brat,” Sukuna replied, pointing his thumb at Yuuji.

“Me?” Yuuji pointed at himself, half-panicked. “But I can’t do it?”

“You can,” Sukuna said. “You were able to hit Mahito’s soul with your fists. That skill is already effective against incarnated beings. Remember, instead of targeting their soul, you have to strike the barrier between the vessel and the curse. Of course, it would be preferable if you could use my Shrine techniques since that would greatly increase the potency of your attacks.”

“But I can’t use your power at all!” Yuuji protested, making a slicing motion with his hand.

“Not yet, Yuuji-kun,” Satoru cut in. “Didn’t I tell you that your body has been ingrained with Sukuna’s technique? The problem is that you just haven’t unlocked it yet.”

“I have used my power several times while controlling your body, so that should help you master my Shrine technique.” Sukuna placed his hand on his chin. “In terms of awakening those abilities quickly, you may be able to awaken them after performing some Black Flashes.”

‘So get on it,’ those red eyes wordlessly conveyed.

Yuuji was sweating a bit now. “...I’ll work hard.”

Sukuna didn’t acknowledge Yuuji’s words and continued, “Another big problem will be Domain Expansion. Almost all of the ancient sorcerers can perform this ability, so we’ll need people with the same power or the skill to counter it.”

Yuta had already mastered his Domain Expansion, while Megumi could only expand an incomplete one. With the current state, Satoru wouldn’t be able to pull out a full Domain either. He could force himself to release an incomplete one, but that would not be ideal. In his case, it would be better to use the Falling Blossom Emotion technique that he had learned as a child.

“That’s another one on your to-do list,” Sukuna said pointedly to Yuuji.

The teen’s eyes widened, and his mouth opened to protest. Unfortunately, before he could say anything, he was defeated by the man’s sharp stare. In the end, the kid could only silently lower his head.

Eh. Why did this feel like watching a strict parent putting unreasonable expectations on their child? Satoru felt like he should defend his student, but he couldn’t deny that pushing the kids to become stronger was necessary for their survival. With him losing the majority of his power, he wouldn’t be able to protect them in the oncoming chaos. He bit his lips in frustration.

The other students sent Yuuji pitying looks but didn’t say a word in his defense. The boy looked up, sending them wide eyes with a hint of tears. Nobara and Megumi wisely turned their heads away, but Junpei was the first to fold. “Um, how can you be sure that Yuuji can have a Domain? I thought that is a very rare skill that only a handful of sorcerers can achieve.”

“Of course, he can,” Sukuna said matter-of-factly, as if stating a common fact. The sky was blue. The sun was hot. Itadori Yuuji could use Domain Expansion. “Though I admit, this ability is not that necessary. As long as he can protect himself from the sure-hit effect, that shall be satisfactory. I believe you sorcerers have something called Simple Domain, correct?”

Yuuji let out a small relieved sigh at not having to reach the pinnacle of Jujutsu sorcery at the tender age of fifteen. Sadly, he suffered another round of sharp looks from the King of Curses, who still demanded that he master Domain Expansion eventually. “...Yessir.”

“Isn’t this a bit too much though?” Nobara asked with a pinched expression. “And how much time do we have anyway?”

“One month or perhaps even less,” Satoru replied. If Kenjaku wanted to kill him, then the best time was before the Soul Piercing Blade’s effect disappeared. They wouldn’t know how much time Kenjaku needed to trigger his seals and activate a barrier that would trap them.

Sukuna nodded. “We should have at least one to two weeks.” The curse glanced at Uraume for their opinion. The curse user had accompanied Kenjaku for a long time and was the person with the most knowledge about that brain.

“I have heard Kenjaku mention a ritual he prepared before meeting Mahito,” Uraume responded. “Unfortunately, it is much less efficient than using Idle Transfiguration, so he abandoned it when he discovered the special grade.”

Great, so they had some time to prepare. It wasn’t much, but at least they knew what they had to face eventually. The rest of the discussion consisted of the sorcerers talking about their plan while Sukuna and Uraume remained mostly silent. Maki asked for several days to arrange a funeral for Mai, and the others agreed to help her. Since they were in hiding, they had to keep it simple and short, but they should be able to cremate the body. The talk continued for several hours before everyone dispersed.

Sukuna was avoiding him. Yuuji was sure of it. After releasing the man from the seal, the teen had hoped he could speak with him. He had been patient at first since they needed to try to save Mai and then discuss Kenjaku. However, after the discussion ended, Sukuna refused to hold a conversation with Yuuji and ordered him to train. Knowing it was up to him to save Fushiguro’s sister, he understood he had to work hard and get stronger. So he tried to be reasonable and waited until the next day. Yet he still couldn’t get a single proper conversation with the King of Curses.

Sometimes Sukuna was engaged in serious discussions with Gojo. Other times Yuuji was too busy training. On rare occasions when both were free, the man walked away from him. If Yuuji tried to corner him, Sukuna even ordered Uraume to distract the boy so he could escape. Yuuji couldn’t understand. He just wanted to talk. Why was the man so averse to interacting with him? Had he done something wrong? Those worries distracted him several times during training.

“Itadori,” Fushiguro reprimanded with a frown. The two had been holding their daily spar when Yuuji caught sight of Sukuna walking by and got hit in the head.

“Sorry,” Yuuji said sheepishly, rubbing his head.

“You’ve been distracted,” Fushiguro said.

“Was I that obvious?” Yuuji tilted his head.

“I don’t think you have the word subtle in your vocabulary,” Fushiguro replied dryly.

Yuuji couldn’t argue with that. He’d always preferred to be straightforward and honest with his feelings and thoughts. “My bad. I just have a lot on my mind right now.”

Fushiguro pursed his lips. “Is this because of Sukuna?” Yuuji tried to hide his surprise but seemed to fail as his friend sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “You’ve been looking at him a lot. Has he been bothering you?”

“No, he’s avoiding me, actually,” Yuuji admitted with a pout. Although Sukuna had somewhat escaped the seal, Yuuji still couldn’t feel his presence. He hated it. It was still too silent and empty. After what he’d heard about his parentage, there were things he wanted to talk about with the man.

Fushiguro stared at him with deep concern. “You really haven’t listened to my warnings, have you?”

Yuuji looked away. He had followed his friend’s warnings, but Sukuna had proven himself trustworthy over and over again. He didn’t want to keep distrusting someone who’d been on his side this entire time.

Fushiguro slouched and wiped his face with his hand. “Fine. Go to the woods this evening. I’ll try to draw Sukuna out.”

“Eh? You will?” Yuuji asked with a hopeful expression.

Fushiguro clicked his tongue. “I’ve had a short conversation with him. Again, I still don’t trust that curse, but he doesn’t seem to avoid me. I’ll ask him to meet me. That should give you a chance to confront him.”

“Thank you, Fushiguro!” Unlike Sukuna, his friend didn’t reject his embrace. The other boy still scowled and flicked him on the forehead, though. After hearing that promise, Yuuji could fully focus on his training.

When the sky turned orange, Yuuji received a message from Fushiguro telling him to come. He quickly made his way toward the woods behind the estate. Although there were training rooms inside the safe house, some students also used this area to practice. Gojo had even expanded the barrier further so they wouldn’t be disturbed by outsiders.

Yuuji could hear two familiar voices coming from within the woods. It didn’t take long for him to see Fushiguro and Sukuna. The other boy still looked tense facing the King of Curses despite their current status as allies. Sukuna, on the other hand, maintained a calm and collected posture.

The man sighed. “I should’ve known you brats would think up something this foolish.” He then turned to face Yuuji, who was wearing a sheepish smile.

“Well, I wouldn’t have had to ask Fushiguro for help if you didn’t keep ignoring me,” Yuuji replied when he realized Sukuna had caught on to their little plan.

Fushiguro rolled his eyes and stuffed his hands into his pockets. “I’m leaving.” He shot a worried look at Yuuji, clearly concerned about leaving his friend alone with the King of Curses. Yuuji only sent him a reassuring grin and waved him away.

While the black-haired boy returned to the building, Sukuna and Yuuji continued to stare at each other. It was the teen who broke the silence.

“Why are you avoiding me?”

“What makes you think I have to pay attention to you?” Sukuna scoffed.

Yuuji frowned. He still couldn’t understand why the man kept himself away from him. Ever since the beginning, he had always pushed Yuuji away and refused to get close. Sometimes, he even dropped harsh and cruel words just to disturb him. It would be a lie to say Yuuji wasn’t bothered, but he knew deep down Sukuna never meant it.

“I just wanted to talk,” Yuuji said. “You know, about my parents and about us…”

“There’s nothing to talk about,” Sukuna said. “You were created by Kenjaku to be my vessel. To do that, the curse user even dared to lay with the reincarnation of my twin. It’s that simple. I don’t see what else you want to speak about.”

“But if that’s the case, doesn’t that mean we’re related?” Yuuji continued, ignoring Sukuna’s dismissive tone. “I mean, not by blood obviously since you were born ages ago, but still…”

“What?” Sukuna narrowed his eyes. “Have you gotten attached to the notion that you have a family member? Me? Don’t be absurd.”

Yuuji looked down at his feet. “Would that be so bad?” Ever since he was a child, he’d only had grandpa. Before that strange flashback, he couldn’t remember his parents. He’d always wondered how it would feel to have more family members he could rely on. Sometimes, whenever he saw his old classmates, he’d get hit by a hollow feeling in his chest.

“If you’re looking for more relatives, why don’t you spend more time with those three brothers?” Sukuna asked, crossing his arms. “That Choso has been following you around like a mutt. Why don’t you pay more attention to him?”

“I know. They’re nice.” Yuuji still wasn’t sure how he felt about having nine extra brothers. They weren’t actually related by blood since Kenjaku had stolen Kaori’s body. However, it was undeniable he was connected to the Death Paintings. He wasn’t planning on rejecting them, but that wasn’t the topic he wanted to discuss with Sukuna.

“Then I don’t see the point of you bothering me,” Sukuna shot back. “If you have so much free time, use it to train. You’ll be important in the upcoming fight, and I doubt you want to disappoint brat number two.”

The man turned away and began to leave. Yuuji watched his back and clenched his fists. “... Do you hate me?”

Sukuna stopped but didn’t answer.

“... I know it’s not fun being trapped inside a teenager,” Yuuji continued. “You must have hated it. I mean, I experienced it briefly when we switched in Shibuya. It was horrible, you know. Having all your control taken away and only being able to watch helplessly. Not that I blame you for using the Vow back then. I knew you had to do it to quickly exorcise Mahito. I understand. But… I guess I just want to say that I get it… I get it if you don’t like me. It must be hard for you to deal with a brat like me 24/7. You must’ve been happy getting some semblance of freedom… so I just… haha… I’m sorry… really… I know I can be a bit overbearing and…”

Yuuji kept rambling, not knowing how to stop. His mind was a mess. He didn’t know when he started caring so much about Sukuna’s opinion of him. Although he loved helping others, he knew it was important not to let strangers affect you. But Sukuna wasn’t a stranger.

The man had been a constant presence, always with him during his journey as a sorcerer. While Yuuji tried to be confident and brave, there were moments when he was scared and in pain. Yet Sukuna was always there to lend a hand. From killing that special grade at the detention center to saving Junpei after he got transfigured, the man had always kept his word and aided Yuuji. He knew that the King of Curses could easily exploit him in his weakest moments, but he never did. He always helped, and how could Yuuji not get attached?

Although Sukuna was the reason Yuuji got a death sentence, he also caused him to become aware of the Jujutsu society. This hidden world might be dark and ugly, but he had met many great people ever since he ate that finger. From Fushiguro, who tried so hard to be distant, to Gojo-sensei, who protected and taught him. And then there was Kugisaki, Nanamin, Junpei, Todo, and many more. Yuuji had been a rather popular student back in junior high, but he had never been that close to them. He had been their friend, but the bonds were not as strong as those he made during his time as a sorcerer.

“…that’s why I…” Yuuji choked out.

“Brat,” Sukuna cut in, still not looking back. “Didn’t I tell you that you need to remember I’m a curse?”

“Huh?” Yuuji blinked.

“I’m not something you should get close to,” Sukuna continued. “Curses are dangerous. You should never trust one. Not even me.”

Anger ignited within Yuuji. Without reservation, he grabbed Sukuna’s shoulder and forced the man to look at him. The other gazed at him with blank eyes as the teen grabbed his collar. “Why do you keep saying that? I’m sick of it!”

Sukuna replied, “Because that is the truth. I’m the King of Curses. Do you know how many deaths and tragedies I have caused? The records about me have been kept secret, so it’s no wonder you don’t know them. Let me enlighten you. Back then, I razed countless villages filled with innocents. I heard their screams and pleas, and I laughed. I killed children in front of their parents and then ate their flesh. Do you know how many mothers tried to protect their children before I ruthlessly cut them down? Many. Do you know how many sorcerers I’ve killed? Countless. I did not feel anything as I cut them into pieces. Sometimes I would eat them, but when I wasn’t in the mood, I left their corpses to be eaten by wolves. Even now, I can still hear their screams of pain, and I feel nothing.”

Yuuji couldn’t say anything. His hands trembled as he held onto Sukuna’s collar. The man didn’t try to pull away and only continued to stare at him, wordlessly asking whether Yuuji still wanted to get close to him.

“I’m a monster, Yuuji. Don’t forget that,” Sukuna said dispassionately.

Yuuji bit his lip. “…Then what does it say about me when I say I don’t really care?”

Sukuna’s eyes shot wide open. If this had been any other situation, Yuuji would have laughed. The King of Curses, who always looked calm and regal, was looking absolutely flabbergasted.

Yuuji gave a bitter smile. “To be clear, I’m not going to let you kill anyone under my watch, but… Sukuna, I already know you were a horrible person, okay? I may not be sensitive to cursed energies, especially yours, but I can feel the malice surrounding you.”

“Then why are you still such an idiot?” Sukuna asked with a frown.

“Because I know you’re trying to be better,” Yuuji said. “I know you’ve been trying not to kill anyone. Like when you fought Mount Fuji, you could have let it kill those civilians and you wouldn’t have been at fault. But you still tried to redirect the curse’s attacks and keep everyone safe. I may not be smart, but I noticed that, you know.” The teen released his hold and smiled at Sukuna. “So, as long as you’re trying, I won’t give up, okay? It’s fine if you stay distant. I understand. But I just want you to remember that I trust you.”

Sukuna stared at him for a long time. Yuuji waited patiently. That was fine. The man had many secrets and liked to pretend not to care. He really was like his grandpa. It was okay though. Yuuji would continue to stay and help Sukuna.

“Foolish brat,” Sukuna scoffed.

Yuuji grinned.

Omake:

Sukuna: Stay away from me I'm dangerous.

Yuuji: But I don't wanna.
Notes:

    By the way, in this fic, OG Sukuna didn’t make a Binding Vow with Kenjaku. Or at least the Binding Vow goes like this, “You let me turn you into cursed objects, and in return, you can wreak havoc in the future era.”

    Also, I think this is the longest chapter in this fic lol.

Chapter 22

Chapter Text

Sukuna was noticing a troubling development. Yuuji was already a bit of a lost cause. The kid had gotten the bad idea that sticking close to him was a good thing. He had initially tried to keep their interactions to a minimum, but then the brat had to drag Megumi into this mess. In the end, they had a confrontation in the forest. It didn’t turn out the way he wanted, but he understood that Yuuji was a stubborn teen. Once he set his mind on something, he wasn’t going to change unless something extreme happened. Since Sukuna wouldn’t murder an innocent just to lower the kid’s opinion of him, he could only deal with the results of his missteps.

Sukuna had imagined he could continue to keep the teen at arm’s length. He wouldn’t avoid him outright, but he wouldn’t seek him out either. However, the brat seemed stuck to his side whenever he had free time. Yuuji seemed to have the false idea that Sukuna was someone who needed help on his road to redemption or something like that. Such a foolish notion. Sukuna knew well what and who he was. The moment he became the King of Curses, he had to bear the original’s sins and misdeeds. While he had been able to control himself thus far, he did not know for sure whether that never-ending tide of bloodlust would ever consume him. That was why he needed the boy not to trust him. A betrayal from a companion hurt worse than a stab to the heart from an enemy. Yet, Yuuji continued being a stubborn idiot.

Since the kid continued to stick to Sukuna like an annoying leech, the other teens somehow got involved. The first one to fall was Junpei. The two had developed a habit of watching movies together, and being in hiding didn’t stop that. Yuuji had the bright idea of inviting Sukuna to this movie night. Junpei clearly looked averse to that idea, and Sukuna agreed. Unfortunately, the other boy had no resistance against Yuuji’s pleading look, and he crumpled like a pathetic piece of wet paper. Thus, Sukuna had to suffer watching a movie with two teenagers. Luckily, it wasn’t The Lord of the Rings again. Instead, they were watching a new horror action movie.

“Um… I think this is the first time we’ve had a personal conversation, right?” Junpei said awkwardly while Yuuji was missing to grab some snacks from the kitchen. This left Sukuna and Junpei sitting in the room alone. Ugh.

“There’s no need to force yourself to talk with me,” Sukuna said, not looking at the kid. He knew his gaze often unnerved people, and he didn’t want the teen to get a panic attack right now.

“Ah, um…” Junpei stuttered into silence. Sukuna thought that was the end, but then he spoke up again. “I haven’t said thank you for saving me back then. You were the one who healed me after Mahito transfigured me, right?”

“Yes,” Sukuna replied. “It was a deal I made with brat number one. There’s no need to feel grateful to me.”

“Still… if you hadn’t helped, then I wouldn’t be here,” Junpei insisted. “So thank you.” The earnestness in his voice drew Sukuna’s attention, and he turned his gaze to the teen. The boy, surprisingly, didn’t flinch when facing the King of Curses and continued to hold a steady gaze. “I’m also grateful that you’ve been protecting Yuuji all this time. He’s very important to me.”

Sukuna clicked his tongue and averted his eyes. “I do not need your thanks.”

Their conversation was thankfully cut short when Yuuji entered the room with an armful of snacks. The horror action movie was fine. It wasn’t anything amazing, and although it tried to be somewhat realistic, the way the movie portrayed blood and gore was borderline comedic.

“Man, I had such high hopes when I saw the trailer, but it’s disappointing,” Junpei sighed.

Yuuji said, “Well, that can’t be helped. I think they tried their best to make the gory scenes look realistic, but I don’t think many people have personal experience like us.” Being sorcerers, they were used to many grisly scenes where bodies and limbs were torn apart. It was very easy for them to see how unrealistic the bodies’ reactions to extreme physical trauma were.

“What do you think, Sukuna?” Yuuji asked when the man didn’t say a word.

Sukuna had been keeping his mouth shut since he didn’t want to make Junpei more awkward. However, he realized this was his chance to create a wedge between him and Yuuji. The kid wouldn’t listen to him, but he might be more open to hearing his friends’ warnings. If he could make Junpei feel worried about Yuuji hanging around him, maybe he would force the teen to stop.

With a goal in mind, Sukuna said, “Those scenes are laughably pathetic. For instance, when the hands of that female character got cut off, it shouldn’t have been that clean. The wound should have been much more bloody and rough. The blood doesn’t even look real. It wasn’t vicious enough, and its color was all wrong.”

Sukuna had never liked to recall those memories of eating human meat, but he was awfully familiar with the way human bodies break; from how bones were supposed to snap to the stench and consistency of blood. He had refrained from bringing this topic up to Yuuji, but if he could passively remind them that the King of Curses was a well-known cannibal, then the kids might get scared.

“Ah, they did use a lot of visual effects for the gory scenes,” Junpei added, sighing in frustration. “This is why using real props is better. I know computer software is great and all, but nothing can beat real physics!”

“Maybe they needed to save money?” Yuuji suggested.

Junpei shot back with passion, “That’s stupid! Movies are art. If you want to be cheap, then don’t be a movie director!”

Wait no. This wasn’t how this was supposed to go.

Sukuna tried again. “Even the way those humans screamed is asinine. I cannot feel their fear and desperation. It was a pathetic attempt to show the depths of despair one would feel when faced with death.”

“You’re right! You’re right! Those shitty actors also don’t help make this movie great!” Junpei agreed wholeheartedly.

“I think they’re pretty good…” Yuuji murmured.

“Yuuji! You should have higher standards!” Junpei grasped his friend’s shoulder. “How can we take a story seriously and get immersed if the actors cannot fully portray the characters and their feelings?”

In the end, they somehow ended up talking about movies, actors, and props. Sukuna left the room feeling listless. He absolutely failed at his attempt to unnerve the kids. In fact, he believed Junpei was mistaking him for a fellow movie aficionado.

The second one to get close was Nobara. The teen was never someone who held much fear toward the King of Curses. Oh, she had been scared when she fought him in the detention center. However, that fear stemmed from a simple feeling that anyone would have when facing a powerful foe. That emotion never came from Sukuna’s bloody past. Now that she believed the curse wouldn’t be attacking them, she had become rather brazen when interacting with him. Not with false bravado; Nobara was genuinely one of the few people who didn’t mind approaching and interacting with the King of Curses.

“You, spar with me!” Nobara demanded one sunny day while Sukuna was watching Yuuji train with Fushiguro, and Junpei sat on the side reading a book about Jujutsu sorcery. Gojo had tried to spend a lot of time helping his students, but he also needed to handle other matters and help their allies, so he was quite busy. The last time Sukuna checked, Gojo had been trying to get Kusakabe and Ui Ui to come help the group train.

The boys stopped when they heard their classmate’s proclamation. Sukuna turned his attention to her and blinked. Junpei got up and approached the girl. “Um, Kugisaki, if you want a sparring partner I can help you.”

Nobara raised her hand to stop him. “No, I need someone who can actually push me to my limits fast. Maki-senpai usually helps me, but she’s still busy with Mai’s funeral, so I won’t bother her. That blindfold is very busy too, and he spends his time teaching Itadori and Fushiguro.”

Yuuji and Megumi looked quite abashed at being singled out. Nobara rolled her eyes. “No need to get your panties in a twist. Potato Head needs to master that Soul Dismantle while Spiky Hair has to get the hang of his Domain. I get why you two have to be prioritized. But I also want to get stronger, so I call dibs on Sukuna.”

The boys looked gobsmacked at the way the girl talked about the King of Curses. Nobara ignored their looks as usual and stared at Sukuna. “So, are you going to keep sitting there like a princess, or are you going to help me?”

Sukuna’s mind began to turn. This could be a great chance to show the kids how dangerous he could be. Yuuji was extremely protective of his friends; if he hurt Nobara a bit, then the teen might finally understand why he had to keep his distance.

“Are you sure? I won’t stop the spar even if you cry,” Sukuna drawled.

Nobara grinned. “I’m not expecting you to.”

In the end, the two decided to spar in a clearing in the woods. As expected, the three first years followed their friend. Nobara rolled her eyes again at their worried looks but kept marching forward. Sukuna and the teen took their spots and looked at each other. While the sorcerer had her weapons ready, the King of Curses kept his hands in his pockets.

“Still underestimating me, huh?” Nobara gritted.

“I’ve yet to see anything worth worrying about,” Sukuna said.

“I’ll make you regret those words!” With that war cry, Nobara launched her Homing Needles. The girl finally managed to use all twelve of her needles for a decent amount of time. Unfortunately, just getting the cursed weapons flying wasn’t enough. The needles were more than enough to overwhelm weaker opponents, but if the teen faced someone strong, she would still be outmatched.

Sukuna might not have access to the majority of his powers, but he was still strong enough to defeat Nobara. He easily dodged the flying needles with his agility and speed. Using the trees as jumping points, he leaped into the air and knocked them away with his kicks.

BAM!

Four of the needles stuck in the ground. Nobara tried to control them again, but they refused to budge.

“You rely too much on this fancy weapon,” Sukuna said while still dodging the remaining needles. “They are handy, but can easily get interrupted by someone with a brain.” The curse had merely forced his cursed energy into the needles to interrupt her control temporarily. “Also…”

Sukuna dropped right in front of Nobara. The teen’s eyes widened. “You leave yourself wide open for a melee attack.” With a swing of his fist, he sent the girl flying into a tree.

“NOBARA!” the other first years screamed.

“DON’T INTERRUPT!” Nobara yelled back as she struggled to her feet. Blood trickled from the corner of her lips, and she wiped it away. “This is my fight.”

Sukuna had held back, but he knew that hit should have hurt a lot. Nobara was not a tank like Yuuji who could shrug off wounds that would have immobilized countless people. Still, the teen forced herself to get up and kept her eyes locked on the King of Curses.

Surprisingly, Nobara dashed to get close to Sukuna. The man’s eyes widened as he blocked her melee attacks. She had definitely improved since the last time he saw her fight. Maki must have helped her with her martial arts. Good. Just because she preferred long range didn’t mean she could slack off on hand-to-hand attacks.

Although Nobara had no chance of winning in close-range combat against Sukuna, she tried to create openings using her Homing Needles. It certainly made the fight quite interesting. Not only did he have to stop her fists, but he also needed to keep track of those flying weapons. The two exchanged blows for some time until Nobara found an opening. Sukuna had to block a needle with his left hand, while his right hand was used to deflect the teen’s fists. Her other hand was still free, so she tried to land a punch to his chest.

Nobara grinned, believing she finally landed her first hit against the King of Curses. But then—

“ACK!” The teen shouted as she was sent back from a kick to the gut. She rolled several times on the ground before landing face up.

Sukuna grinned. “Good try, but you are still far too focused on your hands and neglect your feet.”

Nobara wheezed in pain as she sent a middle finger at him. It didn’t seem like she was going to get up again, so Sukuna approached the kid. She looked exhausted and weakly glared at him from the ground as he crouched beside her. He placed two fingers on her forehead and used the Reverse Cursed Technique. All the wounds on her body disappeared within seconds.

Nobara groaned as she sat up. “Goddamn, I still feel tired.”

“You need to work on your stamina too, it seems,” Sukuna said blandly.

The girl gave him another middle finger.

“Me! Me! I’m next!” Yuuji said as he excitedly raised his hand.

“Wait, Yuuji! You already sparred with Fushiguro for a long time. I want some training too today,” Junpei cut in.

Megumi didn’t join the conversation and only wore a long-suffering expression. Sukuna blinked as the two kids began to squabble about who got to spar with him next. Oh no. This didn’t go according to plan.

The last one was Megumi. Sukuna already had several conversations with the teen, but they were always short and tense. Out of everyone, he was the most averse to the King of Curses, which he approved. The kid was always the only one with a working brain cell in his head. The curse believed that even if the other teens lost their guard against him, at least he had Megumi who would continue being vigilant. That was why he was so surprised and horrified when that incident occurred.

Sukuna was just strolling in the forest by himself. Ever since he became the King of Curses, he sometimes had this urge to just go away and be alone for some time. Not that he didn’t enjoy other people’s presence, but sometimes he just needed to be surrounded by silence. Uraume also understood this and always left him be.

It was during this moment that he heard a small mewling sound. He stopped and turned toward the source to find a small kitten lying inside a box. It didn’t look too young and there was an empty bowl of food beside it. He approached the animal and crouched down. Instead of shrinking away, the cat actually tried to get close and sniff him. Strange.

He had spent some time in these woods and he knew that there were animals living there. Unfortunately, his miasmic aura still made all living beings avoid him like a plague despite his power being mostly locked away. Wild animals with their primal instincts knew better than to approach the walking calamity, unlike foolish kids who always tried to get close to him like idiots.

“Who are you, huh?” Sukuna reached out his hand in curiosity. The kitten took a sniff and leaned close to his touch. Wow. This little thing might have a broken self-preservation instinct. Still, he couldn’t stop himself from pressing his fingers against its small head and began scratching the cat. The kitten began to purr at the attention.

How strange.

“You must belong to someone, right?” Sukuna asked. “I see a food bowl there. Maybe it's from one of the kids?”

The cat began to meow when he pulled his hand away. It tried to get close again and stumbled on its four little feet. Sukuna automatically grabbed the creature into his hand and picked it up. He expected the cat to get scared of being held by a creature bigger than it, but it actually continued to purr.

“Well, aren’t you a brave one,” Sukuna murmured.

He began to gently stroke the fur and felt the strangely soft. Huh. How long had it been since he touched something like this? He didn’t remember if he even had a pet in his past life, and the original Sukuna definitely had no desire to tend to weak creatures. His reverie was cut short when he heard a crack.

Sukuna’s head whirled around, and his sight landed on Megumi who was looking at him with wide eyes. The cracking sound had come from the broken twig the kid had accidentally stepped on. The two looked at each other.

…

Shit.

Fuck.

Did Sukuna have a mind-altering skill? Hmm. Maybe he could actually influence memories using his soul manipulation. It would be a bit difficult, but well, he could be considered a genius now, right? Okay, so he just needed to get close to Megumi and then maybe knock him out. Hopefully, he would forget seeing the King of Curses speaking with a small kitten. Oh my god. His image. How could he not sense a sorcerer approaching him? Was he that invested in talking with a cat?

Megumi also looked like he didn’t know what to say. His mouth and eyes were wide open, and he looked a bit ridiculous. But Sukuna was afraid that his own expression was also equally stupid. In the end, he forced himself to say, “Is this your pet?”

Megumi opened and closed his mouth several times before he managed to say, “Um… ah… uh… not really, I just have been feeding it…” The teen awkwardly raised a plastic bag filled with cat food and a bottle of water.

Sukuna put down the cat and tried to gracefully stand up. He then distanced himself from the kitten, but the thing actually ambled toward him. He studiously ignored it. “Why didn’t you take it in? I’m sure there is a room in the estate.”

“Um… no.” Megumi shook his head. “I think that it’s a bit absurd to adopt a pet now when we’re about to face something so dangerous. I also feel that I should’ve spent my time training more instead of feeding strays.”

Sukuna blinked. The cat was still meowing. “What’s wrong with that? You can afford it and that teacher of yours certainly won’t stop you.”

Megumi pursed his lips. “I’m a sorcerer. It seems like a wrong thing to adopt a pet when you know you can die anytime.”

Ah. It’s that familiar passive suicidal tendencies. Sukuna stuffed his hands into his pockets and scoffed. “Foolish. You clearly care about the beast so why don’t you just follow your desire? Instead of constantly being scared of your possible demise, you should focus on getting stronger so it will be nigh impossible for anything to kill you. Who knows. Maybe having something precious to take care of will actually push you forward.”

Megumi blinked at the sudden speech. Sukuna knew that he was acting a bit out of character here, but he really wanted to get rid of the kid's dangerous mindset. With him and Gojo being weakened, they wouldn’t be able to stop this kid from doing something stupid in the upcoming fight. He had to get the kid’s mind straight.

“Fushiguro Megumi,” Sukuna continued. “You are someone who struggles to live for yourself. It’s quite pathetic, and I can’t understand that. However, although you cannot find the will to fight for your own life, you keep marching forward for those around you. Your sister, Tsumiki, is one such person.”

The teen’s face turned heavy at the mention of her name. “What are you implying?”

“Nothing much. I simply cannot stand your lack of conviction. I’m someone who lives for my own desires, but you are not like that. You do not care for your life so you often throw it away. On the other hand, you care about others yet you do not dare to hold them close. Take this beast as an example. You wish to shelter it yet you keep it here. Brat number one is another example. You care about him deeply yet you still keep him away. Make up your mind. Do you wish to live for your own selfishness or do you wish to live for others? Either way, a sorcerer without a strong conviction will not be able to survive. What do you want? Do you wish to see the future or not?”

The two stared at each other. Megumi still didn’t say anything, but it seemed Sukuna’s words struck something inside him. The curse looked down at the cat who was still looking up at him and nudged him toward the teen. “Go to your master, shoo.”

The kitten meowed again but finally turned its attention to the one who had been feeding it. Megumi stared at the cat for a long time before he crouched down and picked it up. The creature began to purr as it pushed its head toward the kid’s neck.

“Have you named it yet?” Sukuna asked. If he could get the kid to name the cat, then that would help him make up his mind.

“Ah… I was thinking of naming him Tora,” Megumi murmured.

“Good.” Now that he had said his piece, it was time to escape. Sukuna turned around and left the teen standing in the forest. He didn’t flee, no way. He regally walked away with the grace of the King of Curses. After ensuring that Megumi couldn’t see him, he dashed to his bedroom and walked past Uraume who clearly caught something in his master’s expression. Luckily, the curse user knew to keep their mouth shut.

That night, Sukuna dreamed of getting caught playing in a room full of meowing kittens by Megumi. Somehow, Yuuji showed up and began gushing about him turning into a new leaf. Other kids also appeared, there was even Gojo who was laughing like a madman. Sukuna woke up in a cold sweat. No. No. Absolutely not.

The next day, Sukuna refused to leave his room. Like a loyal servant, Uraume took this sudden change in stride and offered to bring him his meals to his bedroom. He nodded and turned his attention to various Jujutsu texts he had borrowed. Unlike Gojo who was busy all hours, Sukuna didn’t have any appointments. Nobody dared to bother the King of Curses except for foolish children who didn’t have working self-preservations. Luckily, those kids were too busy training and gushing about Megumi’s new pet. He was at peace until nighttime. At that point, his biggest headache announced his presence by knocking on his door.

“Sukuna,” Yuuji said.

Sukuna jolted on his seat and the thought of running away via the window crossed his mind. He pushed it away since he knew the kid had already sensed his presence inside his bedroom and wouldn’t miss his disappearance. Since he had somewhat promised the kid that he wouldn’t avoid him, he could only say, “Come in.”

The teen opened the room with a curious look. “Oh! You look fine, I thought you got sick or something since you didn’t leave your room today.”

“I’m a curse,” he drily retorted.

“Well, I was still worried,” Yuuji replied. “I actually asked Uraume about you, but they said that you wanted to be alone so I didn’t bother you.”

“And you decided that tonight was a great time to be an annoyance?” Sukuna asked.

Yuuji didn’t get bothered by this reply and answered, “We’re going to have a gaming session in the living room. I want you to join. It’ll be fun! You haven’t played any video games yet, right? I can teach you!”

Sukuna should say no. It would be a bad idea. He wasn’t sure if he could look straight at Megumi today if ever. He wanted to stay in his room, but one look at Yuuji’s expectant eye, and he ended up saying, “Fine.”

“Yay!” Yuuji grabbed his arm and pulled him out.

Sukuna sighed inside. Only this kid would dare to manhandle the King of Curses without a thought. He still forced the teen to let him go but followed his lead. Yuuji took him to the living room, where the first years were already sitting.

“You took your time, we were just about to start without you two,” Nobara said.

The kids already prepared a Switch with Mario Kart 8 title showing on the TV screen. Sukuna blinked as Yuuji pushed him to take a seat beside Megumi who was holding a controller. Before he could think of reseating himself, the teen already sat down on his other side.

“Let's try Baby Park first,” Yuuji said. “Sukuna has never played a game yet so he's extremely new at this.”

Nobara laughed. “Man, can't wait to see the King of Curses fumble and lose!”

“Don't be like that, Kugisaki, everyone is a beginner at first,” Junpei said.

“That's your opinion,” Nobara replied. “Personally, I want to wipe the smug grin off his face.”

“Oh? So since you can't beat me in a real fight, you wish to humiliate me in this virtual arena?” Sukuna asked, crossing his arms. “What makes you think I'll lose?”

“You may be a genius at Jujutsu sorcery but you're old as shit,” Nobara retorted.

Sukuna smirked. Well. He had planned on playing dumb at first, but since the kid had such high expectations for him, he would show them. He turned to Megumi. “Pick the hardest route.”

The black-haired teen looked dubiously at the two competitive people. Then he glanced at Yuuji, who was laughing weakly. “Just do as he says.”

They ended up picking Rainbow Road. Yuuji forced Sukuna to read the tutorials and understand what each item and button did. The curse refused to get a test drive and just jumped straight into the competition. Yuuji decided not to play and let the three other teens and Sukuna compete. He kept shooting worried looks at the man, clearly expecting him to get last place.

Well, that was true in the first round. He had to adjust himself to the controls, but luckily it seemed he had experience playing games in his last life. It didn't take long for him to understand when to use drifts and take shortcuts. Luck was also on his side, and he got some great items to get past the kids. In the end, it was Sukuna who got first place.

All of the first years stared at the result in silence. Then Nobara shouted as she pointed her finger accusingly at him. “What the hell? Are you one of those annoying people who get good at everything they try?”

Sukuna merely smirked and shrugged his shoulders. The girl was almost frothing at the mouth seeing his response.

“He's like Gojo-sensei,” Megumi sighed.

“Is this real-life main character aura?” Junpei asked.

“That was great, Sukuna! Now let me try to race against you!” Yuuji said.

Megumi decided to drop out this time and let Yuuji take his controller. Nobara and Junpei tried to challenge the King of Curses again. Like the previous match, Sukuna got first place with Yuuji taking second.

“AAAAAAGGHH!” Nobara screamed in frustration. “I hate geniuses!”

Junpei patted her consolingly on the shoulder. “Come on, Kugisaki. As side characters, we should be happy with our place in life.”

“I refuse!” Nobara said with fiery eyes. “It must be beginner's luck! Let me try again!”

Despite Nobara’s burning desire and her friends' encouragement, Sukuna kept beating them. They even tried to gang up on him, but the man kept getting away. They all kept playing well into the night. Uraume had even come to bring them some snacks and drinks. The three Death Paintings also showed up to support Yuuji. Still, nobody could take the crown away from Sukuna.

Nobara’s eyes were red as she stared at the screen. “Hateful. Life is so unfair.”

“Just let it go, Kugisaki,” Megumi said. He had stopped playing after the fifth game and was now reading on the chair.

Yuuji only laughed as he munched on an anpan that Uraume made. Beside him, Sukuna was sipping his cup of hot tea since they were taking a break after their last game.

“Che, spoken like a loser,” Nobara muttered.

Megumi’s eye twitched. “What did you say?”

“Listen, Fushiguro. You may be alright with sitting at the bottom, but someone's gotta knock this asshole down from his throne. At least once! Let me see it once!” Nobara shouted.

“Aiya, what's this?” Gojo suddenly said. Not that Sukuna was surprised. He already felt the man's presence when he showed up. The sorcerer hadn't been at the estate today since he had to leave to attend to some business. It was already dark, yet the man only arrived now. Hmm. If he remembered correctly, Gojo actually didn't get a lot of regular sleep. That wasn't good.

“Sensei!” All the students exclaimed.

“Sensei! Gojo-sensei, I'll keep calling you sensei if you beat this guy in the next match!” Nobara quickly said.

“Oh?” Gojo tilted his head in interest. “Have you guys been playing games?”

“Yeah! And Sukuna has been kicking our asses!” Junpei replied.

“Sensei! Do you want to play a match against Sukuna?” Yuuji asked.

Megumi silently observed with interest.

“Hmm,” Gojo turned to look at the King of Curses. The man obviously had some opinions about his students playing Mario Kart with the King of Curses, but he kept them to himself. “Really? An old bag of bones like you can actually win at video games?”

“Why don't you discover that yourself?” Sukuna said with a smirk.

The two got into a staredown that ended when Gojo picked up a controller. Everyone’s attention was immediately grabbed by the sight of these two people so close. Although they weren't in a physical fight, the students were eager to see who would win this virtual match.

They ended up picking Athens Dash and only Gojo and Sukuna were competing. The others were cheering and encouraging the sorcerer to beat the other. Sukuna wasn't phased by this at all. In fact, he got rather excited to see whether or not he could beat Gojo at this game. The man was known to be a genius who could be perfect at anything he tried.

As expected, it was a tough match. Both Gojo and Sukuna were neck and neck the entire race and refused to fall behind. The curse had to dig up every shred of tricks and shortcuts he could remember to save that extra 0.2 seconds. Gojo was actually ahead during the last circuit, and everyone was losing their minds. However, the man got too close to a boulder and was stunned for a second. Sukuna took his chance and dashed straight toward the finish line.

Everyone couldn't speak.

Sukuna released his controller and got up to his feet. “Well, it seems that I've claimed another win,” he said and left the room with Uraume following him.

The silence broke with the first years wailing at their teacher.

“We believed in you!” Nobara shouted.

“How could you lose?” Junpei added.

“Sensei! That was so close!” Yuuji exclaimed.

“And you call yourself the strongest,” Megumi snorted.

Gojo continued to stare blankly at the screen and didn't react as his students shook and hit him. Sukuna and Uraume could still hear the commotion in the living room as they headed toward their chambers.

“You seemed to have fun, Sukuna-sama,” Uraume commented.

“Don't be absurd,” Sukuna groused.

Omake:

Sukuna: Gojo doesn't get enough daily sleep. He should get at least eight hours. This can't be good for his health. I should stop after one game so he can rest.

Satoru: COME BACK HERE! I WANT A REMATCH!!!!
Notes:

    I have never played Mario Kart lol. So excuse me if there's any errors.

Chapter Text

Satoru was seeing a troubling series of events, and it was all Sukuna’s fault. Although Yuuji was a sunshine incarnate, the kid was a problem child since he couldn’t stop getting too close to the King of Curses. He had resigned himself to seeing Yuuji sitting closely next to Sukuna whenever they had a meal. The kid also pestered the King of Curses about many other things. However, Satoru couldn’t blame him too much since he understood that Sukuna had tried his best to endear himself to the kid. He had expected more from his other students, though.

Nobara was another kid who gave him unnecessary worries. The first big warning had been when she confronted the King of Curses and asked him about his opinion. Satoru had no choice but to fulfill her request despite his massive concern over the situation. He could still somewhat console himself since he was the one who provided the cursed weapon so he knew Sukuna couldn’t tamper with those needles. 

Yet, on one bright morning, he saw Sukuna sparring with Nobara. The kid was bleeding and bruised all over the place and her feet were shaking. Satoru wanted to interfere, but he saw the bright determination in her eyes. Sukuna was a cruel teacher who didn’t hold back. He threw the student around like a ragdoll and hit her in the most painful spots. Yet, Nobara kept getting up over and over again. When the spar ended, Sukuna would use his Reverse Cursed Technique to heal the kid. Satoru had felt a bit insulted that the curse dared to teach his student, but Yuuji quickly informed him that it was Nobara who approached him first. He sighed. Knowing that it was his lack of time that forced the girl to turn to Sukuna instead of her teacher.

The next one that caused him a headache was Junpei. Satoru had expected the kid to stay far away from the King of Curses due to his personality. Unlike Yuuji who could get along even with the incarnation of evil, Junpei was a lot more wary of people and especially curses. Yet, strangely, he had actually seen the student talking with Sukuna about movies of all things. What could a decrepit curse know about movies? He had been stuck as fingers for many centuries. Even if he got knowledge from Yuuji, there was no way the King of Curses would care about such banal entertainment. He wasn’t a big fan of films and only considered himself a casual watcher, but he heard those two speak about niche topics like casting to props.

And lastly, the most damning evidence that made Satoru sure Sukuna was up to something was Megumi. He knew the kid the longest, hell, he had been the one to raise him after his good-for-nothing father died. Satoru knew Megumi’s mindset and preferences, and that boy hated curses with passion. He would always go with the kill first and ask later approach when dealing with cursed spirits. Yet the kid was strangely amicable toward Sukuna. At first, Satoru thought it was because of Tsumiki. Although the King of Curses wasn’t trustworthy, they needed his sleep to deal with Kenjaku and the incarnated sorcerers. But that didn’t mean that Megumi would enjoy acting buddy-buddy with Sukuna. 

Yet, somehow, Satoru found the two of them speaking with each other. If it was about Jujutsu and their plan, then he understood somewhat, but they weren’t talking about those important topics. No! They actually talked about Megumi’s pet! Satoru knew the kid had picked up a stray kitten recently, and he had teased the boy to the point he got kicked out of his room. That little beast was cute but it had the same prickly attitude as its master. It even bit his hand!

Why were the two of them talking about a cat?? When Satoru saw this, he could only stand silently with a gaping mouth. Sukuna finally turned to look at him and narrowed his eyes. The curse excused himself and left Megumi and Satoru alone.

“What do you want?” Megumi asked.

“I should be the one to ask you that,” Satoru replied. “What are you talking about with the King of Curses? About that pet of yours of all things?”

Megumi clicked his tongue. There was a flush on his cheeks and the boy stayed silent for several seconds before he gritted out, “Sukuna was the one who found out about the cat. I was about to feed Tora, but then I saw him crouching before the box I placed in the woods.”

“Was he torturing the poor thing?” Satoru asked.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if he had done that, but no.” Megumi shook his head. “... I won’t tell you the details since I know your horrible personality. I won’t give you ammunition to bother him. Anyway, after that interaction, I think I get why Itadori is so insistent about giving Sukuna a chance.”

Ha? What kind of nonsense was this? Was Satoru actually asleep right now? Did Megumi actually imply that he wanted to befriend the King of Curses?

Satoru’s expression had to be ridiculous since Megumi chuckled. “I know you won’t believe me. Hell, I wouldn’t have imagined myself doing this a week ago, but…” The kid shrugged. “You just have to experience it yourself I guess.”

Megumi didn’t give him any more explanation and left Satoru standing there in confusion. What the hell was going on? He knew that something horrible was brewing up when he found the kids playing Mario Kart of all things with the King of Curses. He couldn’t believe his eyes at first and thought he had gotten trapped in a weird hallucination. But no, that horrible night was real. Sukuna knew how to play video games, and he was damned good at it. The curse even dared to beat him in a race. That piece of shit. He then fucking left before Satoru could demand a rematch. Even though he was tired that day, he couldn’t get a wink of sleep since he was so angry. His blood pressure raised again when he remembered that embarrassing defeat.

Satoru tried to put these new findings aside since he had other important matters to attend to. Bribing Mei Mei to get Ui Ui’s help wasn’t hard, but convincing Kusakabe to actually pick a side instead of hiding was tough. That man might be a kind person but he was also a coward. He would only take a stand if he were the only man left standing. Luckily, Satoru still had Yaga on his side so he finally managed to pressure the man to betray the higher-ups. Of course, the first-grade sorcerer demanded the continued safety of his sister and Satoru had to arrange some things to make that happen. There were also Nanami, Ijichi, and Shoko who were under heavy surveillance. He would rather have them moved away immediately, but that might alert Kenjaku. So for now, he only ensured that those three had a solid escape plan when things went to shit.

Satoru had a bit more free time today though, so he decided to check up on his students. First, he went to Yuuji but then he saw the kid sparring with Sukuna. The kid had finally managed to use Cleave but he was unable to do it reliably and often failed to bring out the technique. He knew that the King of Curses was the best person to teach the boy about his own cursed technique so he didn’t stop them. Since he didn’t want to look at the bane of his existence any longer, he left to find Megumi. 

When he arrived at the kid’s bedroom, the door was slightly opened and he could take a peek inside. The teen was actually studiously reading a Jujutsu text on his bed while his hand mindlessly petted the sleeping kitten. Since he had his back facing Satoru, the man could see the content of the book he was reading. His eyes widened when he saw Sukuna’s writing on the paper. Satoru had seen the smooth and graceful writings of the King of Curses and he wouldn’t mistake it for Megumi’s handwriting. It was a style you developed after being used to write using a brush. The sorcerer was tempted to barge in and demanded to know the reason why the student was reading something the curse wrote, but he knew that Megumi hated having his concentration broken so Satoru could only leave.

He sighed and headed toward Nobara. The kid was in the training room but she was actually training alongside Junpei. While the girl had her needles out, the boy had summoned his Shikigami. It seemed they were training their control and senses since the two of them were trying to attack each other’s technique with their eyes closed. 

“Aiyo, you guys are working so hard,” Satoru commented as he strode inside. The two students flinched at the interruption and glared at their teacher. 

“What the hell, blindfold. I almost got him,” Nobara grumbled as her needles fell to the ground.

“No way Kugisaki, I was the one who was going to win,” Junpei replied.

Nobara snorted. “Like hell you are, I see you’re already panting, I would’ve definitely won this one.”

Before the two got into a squabble, Satoru raised his hands to pat their head. “Okay, okay, calm down. The two of you were doing great. How did you think up training like this?”

Nobara shrugged. “We didn’t. It’s our murderous majesty who suggested this.”

“Yeah,” Junpei agreed, “he said we had to be more aware of our surroundings and refine our control so he said we could work on it together.”

Satoru felt his eye twitched. Sukuna again. Why couldn’t he stop hearing about that damned curse? Why were his students so captivated by him? He was a curse!

Satoru pouted and threw his arms around the two teens. “Why do guys keep talking about Sukuna? Are you trying to make your sensei jealous?”

“Aaagh! Let me go!” Nobara shrieked.

“Sensei!” Junpei protested.

Satoru squeezed them tighter before he released his hold. Nobara grumbled and said, “For your information, he is a surprisingly decent instructor. He’s tough and won’t hesitate to beat you to a pulp, but you can understand stuff pretty easily after hearing him explain.”

“I’m still a bit intimidated by him, but he has some good advice,” Junpei added.

Satoru whined, “Are you saying that he’s better than me?”

“Absolutely,” the two kids said.

Satoru pretended to have his heart shot. “How could you? I thought I was your favorite teacher!”

“You’re our only teacher,” Nobara responded. 

“But I guess Sukuna can be considered one too, now?” Junpei asked.

Absolutely not. “Eeeh? But he’s a curse! He can’t be better than your perfect sensei!” Satoru took off his dark sunglasses and batted his long eyelashes. The students actually gave him disgusted expressions. Rude.

“Hmph your beauty trick won’t work on us!” Nobara crossed her arms.

“Come to think of it, isn’t Sukuna actually somewhat charismatic?” Junpei asked his friend. “I know he’s in Yuuji’s body but the two seem different somehow.”

“Well it could be because of the way he holds himself,” Nobara pondered while holding her chin. “He’s very graceful, right? His red eyes definitely help but the way he keeps a calm expression is quite striking.”

Satoru could only stare as his two students blatantly gossiped about the King of Curses’ appearance in front of him. Was this a nightmare? He quickly whined and turned up the dramatics up to eleven. “Traitors! How can you guys think that curse is better than me!”

“I mean he’s more dependable,” Nobara said.

“Yes, he’s intimidating, but he gets straight to the point and will help you with important stuff,” Junpei agreed.

“No unnecessary dramatics.”

“Detailed explanations that regular people can understand.”

“Doesn’t get overly close and personal.”

“Helpful and honest.”

Each word struck Satoru straight in the chest, and he didn’t even need to pretend to get wobbly on his feet. Oh no, the worst case had happened. His students had chosen the curse over him. Gojo Satoru. The Honored One. The strongest sorcerer. He could only blink blankly as the two teens gazed at him with unimpressed looks.

“If you’re done with the dramatics,” Nobara said, “why don’t you go and do your job?”

“Yeah, sensei, aren’t you really busy?” Junpei asked.

Satoru couldn’t stay in that room any longer and listlessly walked out. He somehow found his way to his room where he threw himself on the bed face down. Since all of his students had their own activities, there was nothing he could do today. For the first time in a while, Satoru was actually free, and he hated it. He had planned to spend this day with his students but that damned King of Curses stole the first years away.

With a heavy heart, he reached out to his phone to contact Yuta. The boy had left the safe house to find some info about Kenjaku. He exchanged messages with the boy, asking if it was safe to call him.

“Sensei?” Yuta asked. “Is there something wrong?”

“Yuta-kun, am I really that horrible?” Satoru whined. “Do I only contact you if I need something to ask?”

“Um, yes?” the boy said.

Satoru felt his heart getting shot again. Ugh. He was dying. He had to have made a sound since the teen sounded worried.

Yuta quickly added, “Ah, well, sensei is very busy so I understand. Don’t worry, though, I think I’ve made progress with my mission. Uraume-san and Sukuna-san have been very helpful in giving me information about Kenjaku.”

That name again. Satoru gritted his teeth. That King of Curses not only reached out to his first years, he even tried to grab the second years. How dare he.

“Say, Yuta-kun,” Satoru said weakly, “what do you think of our King of Curses?”

“Hmm? Sukuna-san? Hmmm. I think he’s surprisingly nice. I thought he would be a lot more unreasonable, but he has been very active at giving me intel and warnings. I think he’ll be a great ally.”

“What do you think of him as a teacher?” Satoru asked.

“Eh?” Yuta didn’t say anything for two seconds. “Um, I haven’t been taught by him, but I’ve heard from first years that they enjoyed his teachings. Hmm. Maki also spared with him once and I think she wanted to try again.”

Maki too? Satoru wanted to scream. What the hell had that curse been doing while he was out? Had he been spreading his influence over his students? That piece of shit. Satoru had allowed him to live this long and this was how he paid him. By turning his students against him? Unforgivable. He wanted to march out and deck that King of Curses, but his brain told him that would be a bad move. They needed his cooperation and fighting Sukuna right now would be a horrible decision.

“Uh… sensei?” Yuta asked when Satoru failed to respond. “Are you okay?”

“Ah, yes, sorry, I spaced out just now,” Satoru assured his student.

“You’ve been working hard; do you get enough rest?”

Well Satoru was certainly resting now, and he hated it. He didn’t want to be here, he wanted to be out and keep Sukuna away from the first years. “Peachy.”

“Oh well, it’s fine if you take some rest now and again,” Yuta said, “I’m sure Sukuna-san won’t mind taking over the training sessions if you are tired.”

Over his dead body. Satoru had to end the call early since he couldn’t bear to hear the second-year gush over Sukuna. He stuffed his head into his pillow and tried to get some sleep. When he woke up, he didn’t feel rested at all. His dream was plagued with laughing Sukuna who was mocking him over losing his students. The kids also appeared, but when he tried to reach them, they turned their backs on him and walked away.

The sun had already set when Satoru opened his eyes. Although he should be hungry, he didn’t have any appetite. He also didn’t want to meet anyone right now so he decided to head out into the forest. His body felt jittery and full of restless energy. He knew he had to get some of them out or else he wouldn’t be able to focus. If he still had his full power, then he could just teleport into the middle of nowhere and let loose on some random cursed spirit. However, he couldn’t afford to act recklessly so he could only vent his frustration on a sturdy tree. 

The Soul Piercing Blade’s effect had gotten weaker as time passed. He still couldn’t use all of his techniques but he could reliably utilize Blue if necessary. Unfortunately, since didn’t want to draw his students’ attention, he could only use kicks and punches. That was fine. Satoru wasn’t one to shy away from martial arts and he had never slack off from training his body. It didn’t take long for him to get submerged in the movement of his limbs. He didn’t know how long he trained, but his attention was broken when he noticed an unwelcome presence nearby. 

Satoru stiffened and turned to face the King of Curses. The curse had his usual posture with his hands in his pockets as he examined the sorcerer. Those infuriating red eyes were locked on him, and the man glared back. Neither of them said anything. Satoru was usually the one who broke the silence, but he had no desire to speak with Sukuna.

In the end, it was the curse who spoke, “You are restless.”

Satoru only narrowed his eyes and didn’t answer.

The King of Curses didn’t seem to mind and slowly approached him. “Your students were quite worried when they couldn’t see your face today. However, they left you alone when they saw you sleeping in your bed.”

Satoru pushed away the fluttering happiness in his chest. He was grateful that his students noticed his disappearance, but he didn’t want to think about that when he was facing Sukuna. “Why? Do you miss me too?”

Sukuna rolled his eyes. “Don’t be absurd. I merely have developed the habit of strolling these woods at night. Your night training caught my attention, that’s all.”

Satoru crossed his arms. “So you decided to say hello?”

“I wouldn’t have, normally,” Sukuna replied, “yet I see unease within every single one of your moves.”

Satoru snorted. “Since when do you care about my mental health?”

“You are an important fighter,” Sukuna said. “I cannot have you get distracted when we confront Kenjaku.”

“I won’t, so get lost.” Satoru began to turn around, not wanting to deal with the King of Curses any longer. The whole point of his night exercise was ruined now that he had met Sukuna. His mood had returned to worse as he was reminded of what happened during the day.

“Fight me,” Sukuna cut in. Satoru stopped and glanced back. The King of Curses had entered a stance and was looking at him. “I know you have been wanting to hit me all this time. Come. Let us fight.”

Satoru hands flexed at the offer. He should refuse. He wasn’t in the best state of mind to confront the King of Curses in battle. Yet his anger urged him to accept the challenge. He turned to face his opponent and entered into his own stance. They stared at each other for a moment before they clashed.

BANG!

It was only a clash of hands using cursed energies yet the trees and grass shook with each strike. Satoru tried to strike with his fist, but Sukuna blocked him with his arm. The sorcerer followed it with a kick, which the curse avoided by jumping up.

“You’re angry at me,” Sukuna said while deflecting more hits from Satoru. “Why?”

“Still pretending to be innocent?” Satoru tried to kick him between the legs, but Sukuna easily dodged it. The curse shot him an unamused look. “Aren’t you the one who has been trying to lure my students away?”

Sukuna clicked his tongue and tried to knee him in the gut. “Don’t pin this on me. It’s your foolish children who can’t stop approaching me.”

Satoru blocked the attack and grasped his opponent’s leg. “Ha! Don’t think that I’m stupid.” With a swing of his body, he hurled Sukuna away, but the man merely landed on the tree and shot back toward him. “What’s your grand plan? Do you think that I’ll let you live if my students beg for your life?”

The sorcerer swung his fist toward the King of Curses’ jaw, but the curse grasped his arm and swung himself up. He then slammed his feet on Satoru’s back. It almost sent him stumbling but he slammed his feet down and retaliated with a kick. Sukuna slammed his own foot on his which sent the two away from each other.

“I think you are fooling yourself,” Sukuna said. “This is more about you than me.”

Satoru scrunched his nose. “What?”

“You have never liked me in the first place, but that dislike has turned into a personal hate.” Sukuna rolled his right arm. “I think you feel insecure.”

Satoru felt himself grin, not out of happiness but from anger. He didn’t reply and immediately got close to the King of Curses. They traded several quick blows that ended with Sukuna grasping Satoru’s arms tightly.

“Why? Do you feel that your students will abandon you?” Sukuna asked.

Satoru gritted his teeth and raised his knee to hit the curse on the jaw. The curse had to release his hold to avoid the attack, and the sorcerer used this chance to kick the other in the gut. “For a curse like you? No way.”

Despite receiving the first hit, the King of Curses merely grinned. “Liar.”

Satoru stiffened. He hated how easily Sukuna could see through him. He didn’t want to admit this feeling. This weakness. He was Gojo Satoru. One of a kind genius. The Honored One. The strongest sorcerer. As the heir of the Gojo clan, he had grown up surrounded by sycophants. Even without using his Six Eyes, he knew when someone merely pretended to like him. Gojo-sama. Gojo-sama. He hated seeing those sickeningly flattering smiles. He hated the way they tried to get into his graces. His students never approached him with hidden intentions. He knew the kids cared about him, yet those festering insecurities refused to leave.

“Are you the strongest because you are Gojo Satoru, or are you Gojo Satoru because you are the strongest?”

Those words had haunted Satoru the moment they left Suguru’s lips. He could not deny that his strength as a Jujutsu sorcerer was the first thing that came to everyone’s mind including his. He was the one who stood at the pinnacle of Jujutsu society. Yet, now, albeit temporarily, he wasn’t the strongest. He hated it.

“I can see it, do you hate it when you watch your students get close to me?” Sukuna carded his right hand through his hair.

Satoru growled, “You’re just a parasite who clings to Yuuji.”

“Yet, they still seek me out.”

“Because you trick them with sweet words and pretense.”

Sukuna laughed. This time it was the curse who approached Satoru. With a powerful kick to the ground, the man launched himself to the sorcerer. He tried to kick him from above and Satoru shifted sideways to evade it. Another foot came up to hit him from the side, but he blocked the attack with his palm. 

Satoru tried to hit him in the stomach with his free hand, but Sukuna allowed himself to fall and roll on the ground. He then used his foot to make the sorcerer lose his footing, but Satoru jumped up. The two took a step a step back to assess each other.

“Do you believe that your students will abandon you because you are weak?” Sukuna asked with narrowed eyes.

Satoru didn’t answer, yet it seemed the curse got his answer by looking at his face. The King of Curses sighed and then engaged in another round of clash with him. Satoru could’ve used Blue in this fight, but to do that would be to admit that he wouldn’t win in hand-to-hand combat against Sukuna. He refused.

When Satoru managed to grab the curse’s leg after a failed kick, he tried to slam him to the ground. However, Sukuna used his hands to catch himself and then used his other feet to slam him in the stomach. The sorcerer released his hold but got close again to punch him. The curse blocked his fist and then retaliated with his own punch. Satoru dropped down and tried to kick his feet.

Instead of dodging, Sukuna tanked the attack to land a fist at his temple. Satoru gritted his teeth and tried to retaliate but the curse caught his fist and kneed him in the gut. The force sent him crashing onto the ground where he had to glare up at the King of Curses.

“Do you know why they have been bothering me instead of you?” Sukuna said as he shifted his position. The sorcerer tried to get up but the curse firmly placed his foot on his chest.

“Because you’re oh so popular?” Satoru mocked as he tried to assess the best way to attack.

The curse didn’t take his bait and calmly replied, “Because they don’t wish to burden you further.”

Satoru frowned. “What?”

“You may try to hide it well, but your children are not blind,” Sukuna explained. “They notice how long you work and how little you rest.”

“Do you see those bags under his eyes?” Nobara commented. “He has a great skin so it hides them somewhat, but I see them. I don’t think he even gets five hours of sleep daily.”

“Managing this little rebellion and arranging your allies. They know that you have a lot on your plate and refuse to add more to your burdens.”

“I think I heard sensei talking with Principal Yaga for a whole night,” Junpei muttered. “Did those two even sleep? Then, the next morning when I looked for him, he already disappeared from the estate.”

“Despite their young age, those students want to shoulder those duties with you.”

“Thank you for the information, Sukuna-san,” Yuta said in a phone call. “I hope I can find Kenjaku soon. I’ve heard from Ijichi-san that Gojo-sensei has been running around everywhere to ensure the plan is running smoothly. If we can locate that curse user, I think that will put his mind at ease for a bit.”

“They are loyal to you not because of your strength but because you’ve been there when they need it the most.”

“He likes to act like an idiot, but I know he’s doing a lot in the shadows,” Maki said after a spar with Sukuna. “That damned Naobito must have tried to stop me from joining Jujutsu High, but Gojo-sensei stepped in so I can stand here. I don’t know why he paid attention to someone without cursed energy like me, but I’ll always be grateful.”

“They know they have to get stronger so they no longer have to hide behind your shadows.”

“I’m too weak,” Megumi admitted during a moonless night. “You’re right. I haven’t been trying very hard to survive since I accepted long ago that sorcerers tend to die in a fight. I’m not saying that I won’t die like that, but… at least I don’t want to pass away before I can become strong enough to stand beside that idiot.”

“Those kids want you to start relying on them.”

“Sensei has always been there to protect me,” Yuuji said. “I want to repay that kindness. He’s vulnerable right now, so I want to be strong enough so he can feel safe to let me guard his back.”

“Isn’t this the whole point of your plan to be a teacher?” Sukuna asked.

Satoru’s own words echoed in his head. “I will nurture them, strong and clever allies. Nobody will ever need to be alone again.”

The King of Curses clicked his tongue. “I wonder what those brats would think if they were to discover that their teacher thought so lowly of them. Do you truly believe those morons will abandon you if you lose your power completely?” 

“Are you the strongest because you are Gojo Satoru, or are you Gojo Satoru because you are the strongest?”

Ah. It seemed that deep down he had always thought that he could only be Gojo Satoru if he held the title of the strongest. Wasn’t that why many people seek him out? Because he was powerful and the head of the Gojo clan. As a child, the people that he met only looked at him as the bearer of the Six Eyes and the heir of his clan. As an adult, his title as the strongest sorcerer came first before him as an individual. In front of his students, he…

Satoru felt a prickle in his eyes. 

Sukuna’s calm face twisted into shock. The weight on his chest disappeared as the curse stopped sending cursed energy into his foot. The man took a step back but kept his eyes on him. Satoru got up and felt something slid down his cheeks. Oh. He was crying. He tried to wipe the tears away but they kept falling down.

The King of Curses’ expression was turning into horror as he saw his opponent crying his eyes out. “Y-you…”

“I’m not crying,” Satoru said.

Sukuna didn’t reply and only shot him a look of disbelief. A minute passed before Satoru finally calmed down. Damn. That was embarrassing. He didn’t remember the last time he cried. Why was he so emotional? It had to be the lack of sleep. He didn’t get his usual three-hour sleep these days.

“You’re awfully good at giving pep talk,” Satoru commented. “Are you trying to be a Psychologist or something?”

“Stop this nonsense,” Sukuna shot back. “I just need you to stop acting so foolish and worrying those brats. I can’t have you distract those idiots from their training.”

“You know, you still haven’t told me why you get close to the kids,” Satoru changed the topic quickly. This night would be a dark history that he wouldn’t forget. Crying before the King of Curses. How embarrassing.

Sukuna clicked his tongue but accepted the change of topic. “Didn’t I tell you that it’s those brats who have the bright idea of approaching me? I personally want them to leave me alone so I can be at peace.”

“Sure you are,” Satoru said. The man said that but he didn’t put up much fight whenever the kids pestered him.

The conversation lulled to a stop when neither party spoke anything. Satoru continued to look at the sky while Sukuna gazed into the forest. The sorcerer thought that they were done talking when the other man suddenly said, “Gojo Satoru, if there comes a time when I become a danger to Yuuji, I want you to be the one to kill me.”

Satoru stilled. His blue eyes stared uncomprehendingly at the King of Curses who was still not looking at him. 

“Those brats have forgotten that I’m dangerous,” Sukuna said. “I’m a curse. Sorcerers exorcise curses. As the strongest sorcerer, it is your duty to kill me should that time arrive.”

Wait, wait. Hold on. Was Sukuna actually asking Satoru to be his executioner? Why? He thought the whole point of turning himself into cursed objects was to incarnate in the future. Then, why…

Sukuna ignored Satoru’s inner turmoil and continued, “The best plan that I could take is to claim Fushiguro Megumi’s body. Yuuji is too perfect of a vessel for me. As long as he doesn’t ingest too many fingers at once, he can suppress me even when I have my full power. Megumi, on the other hand, can become my vessel without the ability to control me.”

Satoru's mouth went open in horror. Was Sukuna trying to get close to Megumi because of this plan, but that didn’t make sense. Why would he tell him this then?

“My next step is to ensure that brat won’t be able to fight back, “ Sukun said. “To do that I’ll have to kill his sister with his own cursed technique. Killing you will be another step, but I can’t face you before I can fully control my new body.”

Yeah. Satoru could see that. Megumi cared a lot about his sister and seeing his own power take away Tsumiki’s life would destroy the kid’s psyche. Luckily, it didn’t seem like Sukuna was planning to do this horrible act.

“If we fight, we’ll probably get into a Domain clash. Mine has an open boundary so it can hit yours with an external attack. You will need to reverse the barrier condition to handle it. I’ll try to get us to clash our Domains several times so I can ensure Mahoraga is already adjusted to Unlimited Void when I summon him. Of course, that means I have to deal with the burden of adaptability, but I can force Megumi’s soul to be the one to shoulder it.”

Oi, oi, oi. Wasn’t this a very detailed plan? Had Sukuna been thinking over this while he was stuck inside Yuuji? Satoru felt impressed. He had only shown his Domain Expansion once to the King of Curses through Yuuji yet the man had already concocted such a precise and elaborate plan. No wonder he was called the strongest sorcerer of the Heian era.

“However, Mahoraga’s adaptability isn’t only useful to handle Unlimited Void. If I can draw out the fight, I’ll eventually be able to understand Limitless then at that point I can enhance my Dismantle so I can cut through your Infinity.”

With those words, Sukuna went silent. Satoru was also unable to say anything. This was a grand plan that the King of Curses had thought of to take him down. It sounded simple but difficult to accomplish. Yet, Satoru knew that if it came down to that decisive fight, Satoru would likely get caught off guard and that one second was enough for him to get killed. 

“Why are you telling me this?” Satoru eventually asked.

A strong cold wind passed through them and rustled the leaves in the forest.

“Because I don’t trust myself,” Sukuna said, “and because I’m a monster.”

Those weren’t a clear answer, yet Satoru understood what Sukuna was trying to convey. The two of them were painfully alike. While Satoru was the strongest in the modern world, Sukuna was the strongest in the Heian era. The two of them stood at the height of power, and while it brought many benefits, it also brought endless isolation. No matter how much he admired those fragile flowers, he could never fully understand them, and neither could they understand him.

Satoru wondered how worse Sukuna had it compared to him. Based on the texts he had read, Sukuna’s original form was quite monstrous. He had four arms and eyes, a massive stature, and a half-disfigured face. It was a stark contrast to Satoru who had been blessed with a youthful and striking appearance. He knew that his face had brought him a lot of positive attention. For someone like Sukuna, he had to experience the opposite. Everyone would be calling him a monster and a demon. They would avoid him and only show hostility and disgust. It made Satoru wonder whether the King of Curses was born evil or if he had been twisted by the world that had scorned him. After all, why should he care about the world when the world had only detested his existence? Why should he care about the pains of others when they had offered him none? 

Satoru had not become so twisted because he had been lucky. He had been lucky to be born in this age of peace. He had been lucky that he was so powerful that the clan members didn’t dare to play tricks on him. He had been lucky that he met people who could somewhat understand him during his teenage years. He was lucky that he still had his students who kept him grounded in this world. 

Although many horrible things still occurred in the world, Satoru could admit that things had gotten better somewhat. Human rights were widely acknowledged, and the majority of people could live in peace. Sukuna had been born in an age filled with starvation and inequality. Everyone back then only fought for themselves or their clan. They cared not for the well-being of strangers. When one had been surrounded by that type of selfish mindset, it was no wonder that the King of Curses became someone so self-centered. So then, why… why did he change?

“Protect Itadori Yuuji!” Sukuna’s words echoed within Satoru’s mind.

Ah. Maybe the reason had been that simple. Satoru had always doubted Sukuna’s care toward Yuuji. He had always assumed it had been a ploy to make the teen drop his guard. After all, if he could get his vessel to trust him then it would be easy to perform whatever plan he had been thinking of. Yet, Sukuna revealed those to Satoru in hopes that the sorcerer would stop him should he become a danger to Yuuji. But perhaps he had been wrong. Perhaps Sukuna truly did care about Yuuji.

Was it because of their familial connection? Satoru couldn’t fully understand since he was very distant from his parents. The clan had not let them raise him since he was blessed with Six Eyes. He had numerous nannies, guards, and teachers, but he didn’t have any connection with his parents. Even when he met them later, he felt no desire to connect with them. In his eyes, they were strangers. Blood connected them, but he was also connected by that bond to other clan members. Such a thing didn’t matter much to him. He had to admit that he had slight expectations before he met them. Yet when he realized that it was the heir of the Gojo clan that they saw in their eyes, those expectations were turned to ashes in that instant. 

But then again, the connection between Sukuna and Yuuji was different. Although they weren’t truly twins, Yuuji was someone closely related to Sukuna’s missing half. Just like Maki and Mai, perhaps there was a deep bond between them. 

“Hey,” Satoru said, “What happened to your twin brother?”

Sukuna looked surprised at the sudden change of topic, but he readily replied, “My mother was weak and starved. There weren’t enough nutrients for a pair of twins, so I consumed my twin brother to survive.”

Another layer of tragedy. Sukuna might have put it as if he had been the one willingly consuming his brother, but he doubted that fetus could consciously do something like that. Perhaps when Sukuna had grown up and mastered Jujutsu sorcery, he realized the existence of his missing twin. Had he lived his entire life feeling empty and missing something important? Was that why he had gotten so attached to Yuuji? Did he see the shadow of his twin when looking at the kid? 

Satoru felt a prickle of pain in his chest. He understood that desperate desire for connection. Even now, he still struggled with the deep loneliness that came with unrivaled strength. At least he had his students who brighten his day. What did Sukuna have? Only a servant who followed him; yet could he call Uraume his friend? Satoru wasn’t sure. Ah. Perhaps Sukuna was a lonelier man than Satoru ever was. He wondered if all of the strange and contradictory actions he had done were Sukuna’s crude attempt at protecting Yuuji. He clearly didn’t know how to show that he cared about the kid. 

Did he even realize it? 

Looking at Sukuna’s pensive gaze, Satoru doubted it. The thought made Satoru chuckle to himself.

“What is it?” Sukuna frowned at him.

“It’s nothing.” Satoru grinned at him. Unlike the previous grins and smiles he sent at the King of Curses, this time it was genuine. “I just realized some stuff.”

Sukuna looked more confused. “Did you even listen to my words?”

Satoru waved his hands. “Yeah, yeah, you want me to kill you and you have that convoluted plan regarding Megumi and Mahoraga.”

Sukuna looked aggravated at his blase response. “Your arrogance will kill you one day.”

Satoru leaned toward the King of Curses and teased him, “Is that worry that I hear?”

Sukuna's frown became deeper. “You have been acting strange tonight, perhaps you should go back to bed.”

It was surprisingly easy to read Sukuna now that Satoru had gained some understanding of him. Before this, he would’ve assumed the man was pretending, but it was obvious that he was genuinely concerned about him. Hmm. This was very interesting. Who would have thought that he would find a curse who didn’t want to cause chaos and kill humans? Then again, Sukuna was special. Perhaps he could not completely cut away his connection to his humanity even after he got turned into a cursed object. Then that connection flared to life when he met Yuuji who was the closest thing to his missing twin. Very interesting~

“Why are you staring at me like that?” Sukuna scrunched his nose when Satoru kept looking at him with wide eyes.

“Hehehe, it’s nothing,” Satoru replied happily. That was fine, he had a feeling he would have a lot of time to figure out the King of Curses.

Omake:

If Sukuna hears Satoru’s thoughts:

Satoru: I see, he has a tragic backstory.

Sukuna: No! The Original Sukuna is evil through and through, and now I have to deal with his shit. 

Satoru: He’s like me fr fr.

Sukuna: NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! I WANT YOU TO KILL ME IF I EVER SNAPPED!

Satoru: Don’t worry I’ll help you in your road to redemption! 

Sukuna: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
Notes:

    Man, I hate fight scenes.

    This one takes the title of the longest chapter lol.

Chapter 24
Chapter Text

Sukuna really couldn’t understand what the hell was going on with Gojo tonight. When they hadn’t been able to find the sorcerer that day, it wasn’t just the kids who had been worried. As far as he knew, Gojo should’ve been free today. He had expected the man to make a nuisance and annoy his students yet they couldn’t find him for a long time. It was only when Megumi suggested checking his room that they discovered the man had been sleeping the whole time. The students let their teacher rest and spend the day training alone. Of course, Sukuna pretended not to care, but Yuuji was happy to share his findings. 

Although the curse felt that Gojo needed to sleep more, he felt that something else was bothering the man. That gut feeling was proven true when he saw the sorcerer training alone that night. Every swing of his fist was filled with anger, and Sukuna was quite sure he was the target of that negative emotion. Despite Gojo’s best attempts, it wasn’t difficult for him to read the man. Considering how annoyingly close the kids had become, he understood why Gojo had been so unsettled. Well. He could use this event to his advantage.

Inviting Gojo into a spar was a good idea. Not only did it help the man unwind a bit, but it also gave Sukuna a chance to fight with the strongest sorcerer. When he became the King of Curses, he inherited the original’s love for battle. Although he could control himself, he couldn’t deny that he had been itching to stretch his muscles. After his fight with Jogo, he wished someone could challenge him again. Training the kids alleviated this itch a bit, but he was always more concerned about teaching them and pointing out their weaknesses. It was nowhere near a true fight. Now that he could face Gojo in battle, he was very satisfied. Although the two of them could not use their full power, they were still equals in that fight. 

Still, Gojo ended up losing during that short exchange since he was not emotionally stable. Despite wanting their fight to continue, Sukuna focused on snapping the man out of his internal struggle. Out of everyone in the story, Gojo got the most spotlight besides Yuuji. Peeling off that ever-cheerful mask was quite easy. Despite calling himself The Honored One, Gojo Satoru was very human. His power had often made people think of him as a monster, but deep down he was quite the same as everyone else. That feeling of uncertainty over one’s life meaning. That desperation for connection with others. Really. It was too easy. Since the man had obvious weakness related to his students, Sukuna wasn’t hesitant to use the tidbits of information he had gained from the times those kids pestered him.

However, something utterly unexpected happened. Gojo fucking Satoru cried. What the fuck? The sight surprised him so much that Sukuna stuttered and took a step back. The man himself was also surprised and tried to calm down. The curse wasn’t sure what he should do. Did he just make everything worse? Then again he’s the King of Curses. This kind of thing was supposed to be the protagonist's role, but he doubted Gojo would let himself be vulnerable in front of his students. In the end, Sukuna could only awkwardly wait for the sorcerer to stop crying. Ah. This was bad. He was really the worst. Even the original never managed to make the man cry, but he did. What the hell… He should’ve shut his mouth and walked away. Well, it was too late now.

Gojo eventually stopped crying, and it was obvious he wanted to bury what just happened. Sukuna let him change the topic since he didn’t want to think about it either. Luckily, it was a good segway to an important matter he wanted to bring up. The kids no longer had any great aversion toward him despite his best attempts to drive them away. In fact, all his efforts were causing the opposite. He really couldn’t understand. Why were these teens so insistent on sticking close to him? Was there something he missed? Since the kids were a lost cause, he could only turn to Gojo. The man held a deep dislike toward him and he could use it to his advantage. As long as he told the original Sukuna’s plan related to Megumi, then things should be fine, hopefully… 

Sukuna waited for Gojo to get angry as he explained how he would take over his ward’s body and torture the kid to gain full control. Yet, strangely, except for surprise, the sorcerer only looked pensive. He seemed to be deep in thought so the curse waited. The new information had to be surprising, and the man might need time to think over what he would do to Sukuna. Although the King of Curses had expected to get questions, he couldn’t understand why the man wanted to know about his twin brother.

Not that he minded sharing that piece of trivia, but he didn’t see the connection to this topic. Gojo seemed to find something though since he immediately acted differently. He was suddenly way too nice. What? Was this a new tactic? Was he trying to make Sukuna drop his guard? Although the curse had believed he understood the man, he couldn’t say the same now. 

“You really should go back and rest,” Sukuna insisted. It had to be sleep deprivation. Even though the man had just gotten a long sleep today, that was certainly not enough to make up for the bad sleeping habit he had developed.

“But I don’t wanna,” Gojo pouted. “I already slept more than enough today.”

Sukuna really wanted to say no. Who the hell thought that sleeping three hours a day was healthy? He doubted the higher-ups dared to push the strongest sorcerer around too much, so this crazy workaholic schedule had to be the man’s own fault. 

“Anyway, thanks to your little pep talk, my mind is clearer now.” Satoru entered into a familiar battle stance. “How about we continue our little spar?”

Sukuna was surprised at the offer. He was still quite concerned about what Gojo had been thinking which made him suddenly switch attitude, but he really wanted to fight more. His sensibility and thirst for battle warred with each other, and it was the latter that won.

Sukuna sighed. “Fine, but you better not disappoint me again.”

“I wouldn’t dream of it,” Gojo replied with a grin.

Yuuji was woken up from his sleep due to a constant tugging in his chest. It wasn’t painful, but it was rather distracting. Something was pulling his-no Sukuna’s cursed energy. When he realized that, all sleepiness immediately vanished. He quickly got up and headed in the direction where he felt the tugging came from.

“Itadori?” Fushiguro suddenly spoke up when he exited his room and entered the hallway.

Yuuji turned to see the other first years looking at him. “You guys are still awake?”

“We actually just finished watching some movies,” Junpei admitted.

“You looked too exhausted after being pummeled by our murderous majesty the whole day,” Kugisaki said, “so we let you get your beauty sleep.”

“Why are you awake?” Fushiguro frowned. After spending a long time with each other, they knew that Yuuji was quite a heavy sleeper. He wouldn’t wake up unless something was really wrong.

“Ah, well, I think something is going on with Sukuna,” Yuuji explained as he got distracted again by the tugging. He turned toward the forest behind the estate. 

“Is someone attacking us?” Junpei asked.

“No way, Gojo-sensei would’ve noticed anyone suspicious getting close to the safe house,” Fushiguro said.

“It can’t be cursed spirits either,” Kugisaki added. Although Gojo was weakened, his cursed energy was still a deterrent to many cursed spirits. Coupled with Sukuna who often roamed around, the place was basically free of any wild curses.

“Still, if it has the potential to be dangerous, then we should go together,” Fushiguro said with a serious face.

Seeing nothing wrong with that, Yuuji let his friends tag along with him. It didn’t take long for them to find Sukuna. As they got nearer, they began to hear the sounds of fighting. The sorcerers quickened their footsteps and they arrived at the scene of Sukuna fighting Gojo. 

All eyes widened. What the hell was going on? Yuuji tried to intercept and end the battle, but someone caught his arm. He glanced to see Uraume holding him back. The curse user shook their head when Yuuji shot them a confused look.

“It’s merely a friendly spar,” Uraume said.

“Spar?” Kugisaki asked. “Since when did those two become friends? Last I checked, that blindfold wanted to rip out Sukuna’s throat.”

“I don’t think you should say that in front of them,” Junpei said while elbowing the girl anxiously.

Fushiguro observed the ongoing battle with a frown. Although Yuuji trusted Uraume, he couldn’t deny that he was worried. His teacher had been quite hostile against Sukuna despite his cheerful acts. The teen understood the man’s concern. As the strongest sorcerer, it was his duty to ensure that all-powerful curses were dealt with properly. The only reason why he hadn’t killed the King of Curses yet was because he had been inside Yuuji. That, and the fact there were still several fingers left he hadn’t consumed. Although the boy wished the two would get along, he knew it would be very unlikely. 

Yuuji gulped as he watched the two people fight. While Uraume claimed it was a friendly spar, he could feel each blow the two traded. It was as if a minor explosion occurred every time they clashed. Although they were heavily weakened and couldn’t use their full powers, they were still capable of unleashing destruction with their bare fists.

The students who were witnessing the clash between the two strongest individuals couldn’t help but feel awed. They had been taught by them and were quite aware of their teachers’ might. However, understanding and seeing were two different things. Yuuji had personally experienced beatdowns by Gojo and Sukuna yet he had never seen either of them use this level of physical power. He had witnessed how strong they were using their cursed techniques, but this fight was another thing entirely.

While Yuuji was still worried about Sukuna and Gojo, he couldn’t stop himself from trying to analyze the way these two masters fought. Each of their strikes was aimed toward an ever-shifting weak point that they managed to block or evade. Their attack speed was also on another level. Their movements were so fast that Yuuji sometimes failed to catch them. Yet, just when he thought the two had reached their limit, they somehow began to fight mid-air.

Gojo grabbed Sukuna’s leg and launched him into the air. Instead of flailing and trying to land, the King of Curses somehow stepped into the air to launch a kick from above. Gojo dodged the attack and leaped into the air, but the other got close using the same technique. Then, they began to exchange blows while they continued hovering several feet above ground.

“What the fuck?” Kugisaki asked with an open mouth. “I understand Gojo-sensei can use his technique, but how the hell does Sukuna do it too?”

At that moment, Sukuna managed to land a solid kick on Gojo, which sent the man straight onto the ground with a loud bang. Smoke and debris flew up, and right before the students could get worried, the man flew back to retaliate. This time, the sorcerer took Sukuna down with him and they crashed again to the forest ground.

“Are the barriers going to hold?!” Junpei shrieked.

“As long as they don’t use their techniques it should be fine,” Fushiguro said. Another big crash occurred, and the teen winced. “I think…”

Yuuji couldn’t say a thing. He felt that he should stop the two from fighting, not because he was worried about their well-being, but because he was afraid they would take it a step too far and break one of the veils surrounding the estate. The most important one should be fine since it was located in the main building, but the secondary barriers surrounding the forest had a higher chance of being destroyed by the scuffle.

The two crashed several more spots around the forest before they returned to the students’ spot. There were some dirt marks on their bodies, but neither looked exhausted. Two equally terrifying and wide grins were etched on their faces.

“Sukuna! Gojo-sensei!” Yuuji shouted. He wasn’t sure if those two heard him since they kept exchanging blows at lightning-fast speed.

“I don’t think they even notice us here,” Kugisaki said.

“And I don’t think any of us dare to stop those two,” Junpei muttered. Uraume could probably do it with their cursed technique, but the curse user would never use their power against their master, so asking them was pointless. The sorcerers anxiously watched as the two men continued to fight. Just when they thought they wouldn’t stop, Sukuna halted the punch aimed at Gojo’s face and the other did the same.

The two stared at each other as they paused mid-swing. Sukuna sighed and pulled back his hand to return to his usual posture. “Enough.”

Gojo also dropped his hand and turned toward the spectating group. After seeing a wave and grin from their teacher, the students allowed themselves to approach the two. 

“What the hell are you two doing?” Kugisaki demanded.

“If we didn’t set up barriers, the whole neighborhood would’ve been woken up,” Junpei added.

Fushiguro sent a disapproving look at Gojo, while Yuuji glanced quickly between his teacher and Sukuna. 

“Why are you guys fighting?” Yuuji asked.

“Why do you ask that?” Gojo pouted. “Is there something wrong with me sparring with Sukuna?”

“Uh, yeah?” Kugisaki said with a raised eyebrow. “Obviously, you two have been acting like cats and dogs this whole time. Why are you suddenly acting like best friends?”

“We do not,” Sukuna promptly retorted. 

“Eh!!” Gojo shot a hurt look at the King of Curses, but the man already turned and walked away from the group.

“Come, Uraume,” Sukuna said and the curse user followed obediently. The remaining people only watched as the two disappeared. 

Fushiguro turned to their teacher. “What did you do?”

“I’m hurt, Megumi! Why do you assume that I’ve done something wrong?” Gojo said while clutching his chest.

“Who else could it be? Sukuna?” Kugisaki replied.

Gojo covered his bright blue eyes and pretended to cry. “How could my students be so cruel? Let me tell you the two of us just have a heart-to-heart talk!” The teens shot the man a doubtful look, which earned them another dramatic pained groan. “I swear! The two of us are friends now!”

“I really don’t think so,” Fushiguro replied.

“Yeah, he didn’t look that happy when he left,” Junpei added.

Yuuji didn’t get what happened, but it seemed that Gojo was better now. Although he only caught glimpses of his teacher today, he had seen the gloomy aura surrounding the man’s usual bright self. Whatever event occurred between Sukuna and Gojo erased those dark unknown thoughts. 

“Well, I’m glad,” Yuuji said with a smile.

His friends gave him a disapproving expression. 

“Itadori! Shouldn’t you defend Sukuna from this menace more?” Kugisaki asked.

“I don’t think Sukuna wants to be bothered by him,” Junpei said.

Fushiguro nodded seriously.

Gojo threw his arms around Yuuji and pulled him close. “Yuuji-kun! This is why you’re my favorite student! Nobody gets me like you do!”

“Yeah, because he is an enabler,” Kugisaki shot back.

“You should grow some spine, Itadori,” Fushiguro sighed.

Yuuji didn’t take his friends’ words seriously and returned the hug from his teacher. To be frank, he was a bit worried for Sukuna since Gojo could be a bit too much. Yuuji could handle the man since he also had high energy, but Sukuna was someone like Fushiguro who preferred quietness and peace. He could only hope the two would get along somewhat.

Atsuya didn’t understand how he got into this mess. He just wanted to be a regular sorcerer, but he somehow got dragged into an uprising headed by none other than the Gojo Satoru himself. Of course, everyone could see that the elders and the strongest sorcerer had a bad relationship. One could expect at least one rude comment to be thrown whenever those two parties met. It had become a source of hot topics for water cooler conversations. Oh. The Kamo elder had almost passed out after Gojo whipped out his Hollow Purple. Hear, hear. That Gojo just insulted the three big clans. The Gojo clan too? Yeah, his own clan too. 

Atsuya had participated in these conversations several times and he even got a good laugh out of it. Unless you were one of those snobs from the big clans, not many sorcerers held high opinions of the higher-ups. Seeing those crotchety old bastards getting put in their place by Gojo was a treat for overworked sorcerers. No matter how much they threatened and grumbled, they couldn’t do anything because Gojo Satoru was the strongest sorcerer. Nobody in their right mind would dare to stand against him.

That was always the case until Gojo got hit by that damned Soul Piercing Blade and got his power temporarily sealed away. That was a bad situation, but he had figured that things turned out well since the man managed to escape. They just had to wait until the effect disappeared and Gojo could take his place back as the strongest sorcerer. However, the elders somehow believed that it was the right moment to strike back against Gojo. What the hell? Even if they hated the man, killing him would be equal to destroying the balance of the Jujutsu world. That guy might be a manchild, but he was the person who ensured that the sorcerers were standing above cursed spirits. As long as Gojo was alive, Atsuya didn’t have to worry about who would take care of those crazy powerful special grades.

What’s that? More special-grade curses were popping up. What did that have to do with Atsuya? Just order Gojo to deal with it. What’s that? They found a child haunted by a super-powerful curse that could rival Sukuna. Not his problem. Huh? Gojo refused to kill the kid and allowed him to join Jujutsu High. Shit. Oh, it’s fine, Okkotsu was a good kid. What? They found a vessel for the King of Curses, and Gojo refused to execute it. The kid also joined Jujutsu High. What the hell?

Okay fine, maybe the elders had a bit of a point. Gojo was certainly a menace who often made questionable and dangerous decisions. But the man was still somewhat sane, and Atsuya didn’t want to throw away the security that his existence brought. Unfortunately, he couldn’t continue pretending that things weren’t in his control. Now that he had gotten involved in this messy situation, he wanted to berate his past self. He should’ve stayed away from Gojo. At least, that would prevent him from becoming one of the people that man decided to rope into his crazy plans. Okay, fine, Atsuya had to admit that he was slightly flattered that Gojo trusted him this much. But this was still way above his pay grade. Even if they raised his wage, there was no way he would want to have a part in the upcoming rebellion.

Unfortunately, there was nothing Atsuya could do. Gojo had decided and thus everyone had to follow. The strongest sorcerer wanted him to join his camp and now he had to help the kids learn Simple Domain. Not that he minded. He knew damn well that geniuses were horrible teachers. The fact that those children were able to survive this long was a miracle. The problem was why did no one told him that he had to deal with the King of Curses too? What the hell? He thought that the curse was locked up tight in his vessel, but Atsuya actually encountered the infamous figure when he stepped into the estate.

Red eyes locked on him, and Atsuya froze on his spot. He felt very aware of the katana tied to his waist. He was confident he could pull it out, but he didn’t dare. How could he when death was staring him straight in the face? A part of his brain told him that Sukuna was extremely weakened due to Kenjaku’s seal, but that didn’t stop the fear from flooding through his mind. Shit. Shit. Shit. He was going to die and it was all Gojo’s fault. He knew meeting that man was a mistake.

Before Atsuya could think of his last words, a pair of long arms suddenly appeared and reached out toward the King of Curses. Sukuna clicked his tongue and easily dodged away from Gojo’s attempt to hug him. What?

“Have I not told you to stop trying to touch me?” Sukuna said with a glower.

“Come on, Sukuna, just one hug!” Gojo whined while flexing his fingers like a clawing machine. The curse shot him a disgusted look.

What the hell? Atsuya knew that Gojo was insane but he never expected the man to be this crazy. How could anyone sane try to hug the King of Curses? This was the being who caused death and chaos in the golden age of sorcery. He had decimated numerous clans, faced the strongest warriors of that time, and came out on top. Who the hell heard that and thought that approaching this being with this level of disrespect was okay? 

“Kusakabe, why are you blocking the door?” a familiar voice asked.

Atsuya turned to see Iori standing behind him with Todo. Oh yeah. They did plan to hold a meeting here today. Since he still couldn’t talk, he wordlessly moved away to show them the ridiculous scene before him. Sukuna was still dodging Gojo’s attempt to hug him while his eyes slowly became narrower. Hey, hey, hey. Shouldn’t someone stop Gojo before he truly pissed off the King of Curses? 

“Gojo-!” Iori couldn’t say anything else as she gaped at the two figures.

Her voice brought the attention of Sukuna and Gojo; the former immediately pointed his finger at Todo and said, “You, brat, come with me.” Without waiting for a reply, the curse turned around and walked away.

Gojo only waved and said, “Hiya Utahime, Kusakabe, Todo!” before following after the King of Curses. Todo glanced at his teacher, and the woman only sighed before nodding. The two trotted after the two men while Atsuya watched with wide eyes. He was tempted to run in the other direction, but then he heard another voice come from his back.

“Kusakabe-sensei?” Okkotsu said.

Atsuya could only turn around and send his best smile at his student. Maybe he could waste time talking with the second year and pretend that he forgot the meeting. That way he wouldn’t have to deal with Gojo! Perfect plan. “Oh! Okkotsu, I didn’t see you there. Where have you been?”

“I’m just done with my mission,” Okkotsu readily replied. “Are you also here for the meeting, sensei? I can accompany you to the meeting room if you want?”

Ack. God damnit. Why did it have to be Okkotsu? Although the kid was still in second grade, he was already a special grade and it was no wonder he got saddled with important missions now that Gojo was out of commission for a while. Atsuya couldn’t directly reject and run away. No matter how cowardly he was, he still had some face that he needed to maintain, especially in front of students!

“Sure, sure, thanks a lot,” Atsuya said as he reluctantly followed the teen. As he passed through the large hall, he couldn’t help but feel disgusted at the amount of money Gojo had. Only someone as rich as him could have a building this large as a safe house. Oh well. At least if this place was big then he would have an easier time avoiding Gojo and the King of Curses. He might not be able to deny helping the man, but he certainly wouldn’t let himself interact more than necessary with that headache of a sorcerer.

They arrived just in time to see Sukuna unwrapping the bandages on Todo’s left arm. Atsuya had heard that the boy had lost it during a fight with a nasty special grade. As far as he knew, nobody could heal a wound to that level. Even Ieri, who was considered their best healer, couldn’t recover a missing limb. It wasn’t just Sukuna and Todo in the room. There were also Gojo, Iori, Mei Mei, and Yaga. Atsuya heard that it would take a lot longer to extract Ijichi, Ieri, and Nanami from the higher-ups’ grasp, so they wouldn’t be able to attend this meeting.

“Oh! Yuta-kun, nice to see you!” Gojo said to his student while pointing at the empty seat beside him. Obviously, nobody wanted to be that close to the manchild called Gojo Satoru.

“Sensei,” Okkotsu nodded and followed his teacher’s instruction obediently. Poor kid.

Atsuya still wanted to run away, but he could only resign himself and take the farthest spot from Gojo and Sukuna. He couldn’t help but stare at the curse. He had heard of the miraculous healing the King of Curses had performed on the newest first year. That boy even had it worse than Todo. He didn’t see it himself, but he heard that kid got fully transfigured into a monster. Nobody should be able to recover from that, but Sukuna had somehow reversed that process and recovered the boy. Atsuya had seen Yoshino train with his classmates after that horrifying mission. If he hadn’t heard the news from Ijichi who would never lie to him, he wouldn’t have believed the kid had been transfigured several days ago. Even when he stretched his senses, he couldn’t find anything wrong with the first year. 

Although the elders tried to keep the news secret, everybody had heard of this impossible event. It had been the hottest topic for that month and longer. Nobody was sure how they should react to the fact that the cruel and terrifying King of Curses had the power of healing that could bring back people from the edge of death. There were many powerful cursed techniques to destroy and kill, but there were very few that could heal others. Some lucky and talented individuals could learn the art of the Reverse Cursed Technique, but even that was limited to oneself. No matter how much the sorcerers feared the King of Curses, nobody could deny that they were tempted by his ability to heal. No matter how strong you were, there would come a time when you would get wounded. Just look at Gojo. The man had the power of Infinity at his fingertips yet he still almost got done in twice.

Atsuya had kept his mouth shut regarding this topic. It wasn’t his place and it wasn’t part of his job descriptions. The decision regarding the King of Curses' and his vessel’s fate would rest on the elders and Gojo Satoru. Since those two parties were now enemies, Gojo now had the final say. Sure, they still had to take down the higher-ups, but Atsuya really doubted those old fools could stand against the strongest sorcerer. Even if the man was weakened, there were a ton of powerful individuals in his corner. Okkotsu was one example, but he was quite sure the other special grade, Tsukumo Yuki, wouldn’t side with the elders and the conservatives. Atsuya had also heard of the amazing feats the first years had performed. Fushiguro could already manifest his Domain, so he would eventually get put into the special grade rank. Itadori was also another strong contender since that kid managed to handle the special grade cursed spirit named Mahito. If they added Sukuna into the equation, then the teen was already considered one. Yeah, although Atsuya didn’t like being dragged into Gojo’s little rebellion, he was pretty sure they were the winner here. 

Atsuya was pulled out of his musing when he felt Sukuna’s cursed energy spiked. Everyone in the room examined the King of Curses with a mix of curiosity and apprehension. It had been over a week since Todo had gotten his arm cut off. Everyone had considered it lucky that the teen managed to get away with losing one hand after being touched by that cursed spirit. Since there was no hand left, Ieri couldn’t attach the limb to its original place. The only thing she could do was stop the bleeding and heal the wound. 

Sukuna’s red eyes calmly examined the hand, uncaring about the focused stares from the sorcerers in the room. “Hmm, this will get hurt a bit.” The curse didn’t wait for the teen’s response before he injected his cursed energy into the wound. 

Todo’s whole body tensed at the intrusion from a stranger’s energy. Iori was grasping her red hakama tightly, while Gojo had his blindfold off so he could use his Six Eyes to observe the healing process. Mei Mei hummed in interest, no doubt thinking whether or not she could strike a deal with the King of Curses. After all, people would pay a lot to recover and get healthy again. Yaga and Okkotsu observed silently with sharp eyes, and Atsuya felt a bead of sweat coming down from his forehead. No matter how he looked at it, Sukuna’s energy was extremely malicious and volatile. How could somebody with that kind of aura heal someone? But since Gojo had allowed the curse to attempt to regrow Todo’s hand, there was nothing Atsuya could say against that.

The wound on Todo’s hand began to split open and blood poured out. Iori gasped and tried to get up from her seat, but Gojo held her back with one hand. The woman glanced at the man, but his eyes were still fixed on the operation. Seeing that the strongest sorcerer still allowed the process to continue, nobody else tried to interrupt. Todo also didn’t resist and silently endured the pain. Now, the stump that was already healing returned to a bleeding gaping wound. 

Sukuna’s cursed energy spiked again. This time, white bones began to come out followed by muscles and blood vessels. They wound around each other and knitted into one shape. The sight was horrifying but also mesmerizing. Skin appeared not long after to cover the red flesh. In a matter of seconds, the stump had returned to a full hand.

“Try to move it,” Sukuna said.

Todo blinked and did as asked. The newly grown hand flexed and the five new fingers curled inward. The teen repeated the movement several times while staring at his healed limb. 

“Does it hurt?” the curse asked.

“No.” Todo shook his head. “It feels like before.”

“Good,” Sukuna said as he leaned on his chair to cross his arms. “It was a bit touch and go since it has been a while since you lost your hand. Your soul has started to forget, and I have to copy your right hand as a template to make a new left hand. You shall inform me if you feel any unexpected pain.”

Atsuya’s mouth slid open. What the hell did he just see? He had seen cursed spirits recover their limbs but they were made out of cursed energy. Humans were another thing entirely, yet the King of Curses actually managed to regrow Todo’s hand. Hearing the curse performing a healing miracle was one thing, seeing the process himself was another. Damn. He could somewhat understand those crazy people who actually argued that they should keep Sukuna alive. That skill is extremely handy. 

The door to the room slid open with a bang and everyone turned to look at Itadori standing in the doorway. The teen’s eyes widened, seeing so many adults in the room. “Ack! Sorry, I just heard Todo was here and I-”

A hand smacked the boy on the head. “That’s why I told you to slow down, idiot!” Kugisaki yelled.

“They’re having a meeting right now,” Fushiguro said drily, though Atsuya couldn’t see him.

“Brother!” Todo leaped up and opened his arms wide to greet the younger student. The first years’ eyes widened when they saw a full set of hands on the older teen.

“Todo!” Itadori readily returned the exuberant greeting. “Sukuna managed to recover your hand then! I’m glad!”

What a touching sight. Atsuya was pretty sure he heard that Todo almost bashed the younger teen’s head to pulp the first time they met, but it seemed Itadori was one of those people who could forgive and forget.

Sukuna clicked his tongue and headed toward the window. “I’m leaving.”

“Eh? Are you not going to accompany me?” Gojo pouted. “The meeting will be very boring without you.”

Sukuna shot a flat look at the sorcerer as he opened the window. “I have no interest in being surrounded by sorcerers more than necessary.” With that, the King of Curses leaped out of the opening and landed in the yard. 

“Ah! Wait, Sukuna!” Itadori exclaimed when he saw the curse leaving.

“Come on give him some space,” Kugisaki sighed. “Blindfold has been bothering him enough today.”

“I just want to thank him,” Itadori muttered. In the end, his friends had to drag him away and Todo accompanied them after being permitted by Iori. Once everything returned to calm, the people in the room began to exchange glances, except Gojo; That guy was still pouting at the open window. 

“Well that was an interesting sight,” Mei Mei said with a smile.

“What? Are you thinking of a new lucrative money-making business?” Gojo asked with a sharp grin.

“You certainly read my thoughts, Gojo,” Mei Mei replied while making a money sign. “Do you want to help me? I’ll give you a cut.”

Gojo stuck his tongue out. “No way, ask Sukuna yourself. He doesn’t listen to anyone, maybe except Yuuji, but I doubt that kid will let you extort desperate people.”

Atsuya blinked when he was reminded of the situation between Itadori and Sukuna. “Wait, shouldn’t Sukuna be trapped inside Itadori? Why are they separated?”

“Oh, you haven’t been informed yet?” Yaga said. The man shot a disapproving look at Gojo who only shrugged. That bastard. 

“We obtained a cursed tool from the Zen’in clan,” Okkotsu explained, “It has the special properties of creating a clone, but instead of placing Itadori-kun’s consciousness, we managed to place Sukuna’s instead.”

Oh, that made sense. Wait. Did they willingly let the King of Curses roam free then? He shot a horrified look at Gojo, who grinned at his expression. “What~?”

What did he mean by what? Since when was it a good idea to let the King of Curses out of his cage? Wasn’t that guy super evil or something? Atsuya had thought the vessel had made another Binding Vow that forced the curse to heal Todo but that didn’t seem to be the case now. What the hell was Gojo thinking?

“We needed information about Kenjaku,” Gojo explained. “His lackey didn’t want to spill so we could only ask Sukuna.”

Yaga sighed at Gojo’s carefree tone. Atsuya agreed. How could someone act this recklessly? He knew that weird curse user was dangerous, but was it truly necessary to let Sukuna out?

“And he just answered willingly?” Iori asked doubtfully. 

“Yup, and we got a ton of useful info,” Gojo replied. “I haven’t been able to inform you guys since this is a sensitive matter, but let’s just say, be prepared to have your minds’ blown.”

Atsuya didn’t want to hear it. In fact, he wanted to leave. He didn’t want to get dragged into this madness. Unfortunately, Gojo didn’t care about anyone’s opinions and he immediately dumped one surprise after another. At the end of the meeting, Atsuya’s head was throbbing so much that he felt that it was about to explode. Yaga also looked like he had aged ten years, while Iori looked pale as a sheet.

Except for Gojo, the culprit of their miseries, only Mei Mei and Okkotsu looked calm. Okkotsu was likely already aware of this fact since he was the first one to contact the man out of everyone in the group. Mei Mei was sick in the head and she was probably thinking of how to exploit this upcoming catastrophe so she could make a ton of money.

“So do you see now?” Gojo said. “I’ve been working hard alone arranging this meeting and extracting everyone. It’s time for you guys to pay up and help me deal with this mess.”

Atsuya wanted to argue that Gojo was the one who dragged him forcefully into his mess. He would’ve preferred not to know about this at all. Yet, he also knew that if Kenjaku’s plan occurred then everyone in the Jujutsu world would be deep in this crisis. He sighed. Not knowing whether he should be grateful that he knew about this problem early or not.

“That’s why you want me here to teach those kids Simple Domain,” Atsuya sighed.

“Yup!” Gojo replied. “I want you to help everyone but let’s focus on Yuuji first. He’ll be on the front line and deal with one of the biggest threats so he’ll need to be ready.”

Well, at least Gojo had the decency to understand that he would suck at teaching the skill to his students. The man was a genius who could master the hardest techniques, but he was shit at teaching. 

“Also, you should speak with Sukuna,” Gojo added, “he’s another mentor for Yuuji, so it’s better to discuss with him about the schedule.”

The white-haired man gave a shit-eating grin when he saw the dawning horror on Atsuya’s face. The King of Curses? Teaching? He, Atsuya, a mere first-grade sorcerer, had to co-teach with Sukuna? What? Was he dreaming? Excuse me? Someone? He desperately glanced at Okkotsu but the teen averted his eyes. The kid had to know about this but he had kept his mouth shut until now. Betrayed; he was betrayed by his own student. Oh, it was his own fault. Okkotsu was Gojo’s first, the boy would always side with his first teacher. Atsuya hung his head low. He wanted to go home.

Chapter Text

Utahime wasn’t quite sure how she should react to this new development regarding the King of Curses. The last time she heard about the ancient curse, Gojo cursed Sukuna with his whole being. They had contacted each other several times before the meeting. While she had tried to keep it professional, Gojo always managed to include a pity party section for himself. Not that she could blame him much. It seemed some of the Tokyo students had gotten quite close to the King of Curses. She still couldn’t understand how that happened but the situation had been stressing the usually carefree man greatly.

However, something had to have changed since Gojo was acting completely differently toward Sukuna. Previously, the man couldn’t stop insulting and grumbling about the King of Curses, but now he acted as if the curse was his long-lost friend. Utahime couldn’t understand; no, she didn’t want to. She already had enough headaches from the upcoming crisis, and she didn’t have enough energy to even bother figuring out what was going on inside that black box called Gojo’s brain. As long as nobody was dead, she didn’t care.

At least, that was what she kept trying to say to herself. However, dealing with Gojo Satoru was always a difficult and thankless task. Watching the strongest sorcerer continue to pester the King of Curses was, frankly, embarrassing. Utahime wanted to avoid those two, but unfortunately, the people here tend to gravitate to either of them. Since Gojo followed Sukuna like an annoying gnat, others suffered from his disgraceful acts.

Utahime never imagined that she would ever feel pity for someone like the King of Curses, but she was feeling it now. She had experienced the pain of being under Gojo’s irritating attention, and she would never wish it on her worst enemy. Being the center of that man’s attention might sound good to those naive people who didn’t know Gojo personally. But once you interact with him, you would know that it was a fate worse than death to be the person who somehow drew the full attention of this manchild. 

Sukuna was that victim.

Except for when he was instructing the kids or sleeping, Gojo always showed up to annoy the curse whenever he had free time. Utahime was surprised that the King of Curses hadn’t already tried to throttle the sorcerer. She did see his hand twitching like he wanted to use his cursed technique. At this point, she wouldn’t stop him, not that he could hit Gojo with his Infinity. Surprisingly, the Tokyo students were actually on the curse’s side. Sometimes, when their teacher got a bit too far, they tried to restrain him. It wasn’t enough to make the man stop, but at least it gave the curse a chance to escape. Those were merely brief moments of respite, though. Nobody could hide from the Six Eyes.

One great example was when Sukuna was discussing Jujutsu theories with Fushiguro. Utahime still wasn’t quite sure about the fact that a curse was teaching sorcerers. She couldn’t deny that the King of Curses had been known as one of the strongest sorcerers in history, but his past was too bloody for her liking. How could someone with such a horrible track record could teach young students? But since Gojo hadn’t put a stop to this, Utahime couldn’t do anything. It wasn’t as if she could order the King of Curses away. 

That day, the boy was sitting on the single sofa while the curse sat on the long couch. Gojo saw this and decided that it was a great time to put himself next to the King of Curses. Sukuna stiffened, and Fushiguro stopped talking and glared at his grinning teacher. Utahime, who was on her way to the kitchen, couldn’t help but stop to witness the oncoming catastrophe. 

The curse hand was twitching when Gojo was slowly leaning toward him. Luckily, Itadori was nearby and quickly tried to stop this horrible incident. In a desperate attempt to distract his teacher, he said, “Sensei, how about you help me train?”

“Eh? But didn’t you just finish your training?” Gojo asked. “I know you’re working hard, Yuuji-kun, but rest is also important.”

Sukuna twitched at those words.

“Ah, well I-” Before Itadori could come up with an excuse, the curse pulled on the kid’s shirt and forced him to sit between the two men. Ah, a living barrier. The King of Curses seemed to be too proud to blatantly run away from Gojo, but he also didn’t want to be too close to the man.

Itadori obediently accepted his fate, but he still shot a miserable look at Fushiguro. The other boy sighed. 

“Gojo-sensei, don’t you have better things to do?” the black-haired boy asked.

“Eh? But I’m here being supportive of my students. I think that’s very important.” As he said this, Gojo slowly raised his arm and put it on top of the sofa’s back. He was clearly trying to reach Sukuna, and his long arm certainly made that possible. The curse didn’t even look as he inched away from the intruding limb. 

Other people also stopped to watch this ridiculous charade. Kugisaki had a particularly nasty look that she sent at his teacher, “Che, this is clearly harassment, Sukuna, just cut off his arm already.”

“I mean, he can just heal him afterward, right?” Yoshino muttered beside her.

Fushiguro stared at Gojo with a disappointed look. “Shameless.”

Well, Gojo, who had never experienced an emotion called shame, wasn’t bothered at all that his students were defending the curse. Itadori leaned back and tried to pin the arm so it would stop moving. Unfortunately, Gojo was also blessed with particularly long fingers that managed to touch Sukuna’s back. 

The curse immediately stood up and walked out of the room. “Come, brat number two, we’ll spar.”

Fushiguro got up and left, but not before sending another glare at his teacher. Gojo tried to follow them, but the three remaining students blocked his path by forming a wall. All of them sent their own versions of disapproving looks that received a pout from the man. 

“Cut it out,” Kugisaki growled. 

“Come on, sensei, didn’t you want to teach us some stuff before?” Yoshino tried to coax the man.

Sukuna was finally left alone for a bit until Utahime witnessed Gojo annoying the curse again during dinner time. She sighed. What the hell was her life?

Although Gojo was the most annoying one in this group, sorcerers were known to be a crazy bunch. Since there were a lot of them trapped in this estate, something bad was bound to occur. Sadly, the person who became the center of an incident next was Todo. Now, she was quite proud of her student's achievements and strength, but she couldn’t deny that he was quite… special. Most people could handle his attitude, but she should have expected that an incident would occur with Sukuna in the equation.

While the kids would get one-on-one teachings that day, Sukuna suggested holding a group spar where the Tokyo students and Todo would fight together to take him down. Utahime blinked when she heard this. Sorcerers were taught to fight alone since, most of the time, they would be assigned to solo missions. Sometimes, their task would be too big, and several sorcerers would be ordered to complete it together, but that was an exception and not the rule. Thus, they had been teaching the students how to survive and fight as if they had no backup.

“Being able to fight alone is important,” Sukuna said, “but in the upcoming fights, you will likely fight with other sorcerers. It would be best if you get used to cooperating with your allies instead of cobbling up imperfect coordination.”

Gojo hummed in understanding. “Sounds reasonable, do you want me to help? That will make it more even, no?”

“No!” all the first years shouted simultaneously.

It wasn’t just for Sukuna, who they were still protecting from Gojo’s pranks. Sukuna and Gojo might be very weakened, but they could still handle the students in a spar. The only reason they didn’t go to sleep black and blue every night was because Sukuna kept healing their wounds. Utahime couldn’t believe that she had somewhat gotten used to the fact that the King of Curses was a healer.

“You can take over after this first try,” Sukuna said. “Since our position is not ideal and my current state, none of you shall use your power except for that brat.” The curse pointed his finger at Todo. “So far, only brat number one has experienced your cursed technique. The other brats need to learn how to deal with the sudden change of position.”

The first years’ eyes sparked at those words. No matter how strong and fast the King of Curses was, Todo’s technique was one of those special abilities that would catch off guard, even those who had expected it. Gojo was the only exception since he had his Infinity.

“Hehe time for payback,” Kugisaki said.

“Please don’t jinx us, Kugisaki,” Yoshino replied. 

“Shut up! This isn’t Mario Kart!” the girl shot back and turned toward the remaining boys in the group. “You idiots better step up too!”

“Todo! Let’s go!” Itadori said excitedly.

“Of course, brother!” Todo replied with gusto. “However, before we start I have one question I want to ask!”

Utahime felt a hint of premonition. Fushiguro and Itadori also paused and shot a panicked look at the older teen.

Todo ignored the Tokyo students and stared at the curse. “Sukuna! What kind of woman is your type!”

SLAP!

The sound came from Fushiguro, who face-palmed so hard that the hit left red marks on his skin. The others were staring with wide mouths at Todo while Utahime felt the vein in her forehead throbbing. This kid…

“AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!” As expected, Gojo was the only one who found the situation hilarious. The man was laughing so hard that he had to lean on the wall as he bent down to clutch his stomach. “Wheeze… type of women… oh my god, I’m dying…”

Good. You better die, Gojo. Choke on your own spit and die.

The King of Curses’ mouth remained closed, but he was staring at the student blankly. Todo didn’t mind other people’s reactions and looked at the red eyes. The curse didn’t sigh, but he did close his eyes for a second before answering, “I have none. I have no interest in that kind of relationship. Women, men. It doesn’t matter. What’s important is whether they are weak or strong. And you, brat,-” Sukuna suddenly appeared one step in front of Todo. “have yet to prove yourself.”

With one strike, the King of Curses sent the teen flying back.

BAM!

“Good strike, Sukuna!” Kugisaki said, but she immediately tried to get close to the curse to attack.

Fushiguro sighed. “He deserves that.”

“Todo…” Itadori shot a worried look at the Kyoto student, and he immediately dashed toward Sukuna to help Kugisaki. Despite the first years attacking all at once, none of them managed to land a hit on the curse. The man easily blocked or evaded the students’ hits with ease and grace. Utahime wasn’t an experienced martial artist, but she knew that Sukuna sometimes attacked to show the weakness of each kid’s approach. 

Todo also didn’t let himself stay down for long and joined the fight after several seconds passed. With one clap, he switched Kugisaki's position to Fushiguro's, who took the chance to kick the curse. Sukuna caught his foot and threw him toward Yoshino, who was trying to get close.

“I see! Then I shall prove myself!” Todo shouted. He clapped again, and this time, it was Sukuna who suddenly switched with Kugisaki. Itadori, who stood beside her, immediately noticed and tried to attack. The curse blocked the move, but before he could retaliate, he was switched again with Yoshino. This time, Sukuna was fast enough to grab Fushiguro and throw him toward Todo. 

CLAP!

Todo took Yoshino's place and tried to punch Sukuna. The curse deflected his attack and punched him in the gut.

CLAP!

Itadori switched with the Kyoto student, who finally managed to kick Sukuna. The curse grunted.

CLAP!

Sukuna exchanged spot with Kugisaki. Todo, who had been beside her, was able to punch the curse. However, the man caught his fist and retaliated with his own hit.

CLAP!

Todo was pushed back several feet, but he still managed to switch Itadori with Kugisaki. Sukuna, expecting someone a bit taller, misjudged the incoming hit so the girl could land her punch.

“Haha!” Kugisaki shouted.

Her grin quickly extinguished when Sukuna grabbed her arm to throw her at Fushiguro, who was running at her. 

“Again?!” the girl exclaimed as she went down with Fushiguro. 

“Stop,” Sukuna said. The kids immediately halted their movement and stood on their spots. Utahime was surprised at how automatically the students followed the curse’s instruction. She knew that Sukuna had been mentoring them these past few days, but was that short time enough to earn this much obedience?

“As expected, that is quite an annoying technique,” the curse said.

Kugisaki grumbled as she got up to her feet. “Oh, shut up, you aren’t fighting that seriously anyway.”

Sukuna didn’t deny this. The whole point of this exercise was to get the students used to Todo’s technique. Although they still used cursed energy, none tried to truly harm each other. The King of Curses' current body was also a manifestation of a cursed tool, and nobody was sure how much damage it would take before it broke. 

“Although tricky, that technique is still too slow and predictable,” Sukuna continued, “against stronger enemies, you may have trouble.”

“Really?” Itadori asked doubtfully. 

Utahime agreed. She had heard that Todo and Itadori had managed to handle a special grade during the exchange event using Boogie Woogie. Todo didn’t look insulted and listened intently.

“This is merely a suggestion, but what do you think of using a tool?” Sukuna asked. “No matter how fast you clap, as long as your enemies keep an eye on your hands then they can somewhat predict that a switch is about to happen. But if you use an instrument, you can mitigate that issue.”

“An instrument?” Todo’s eyes widened.

“Something like a Vibraslap, perhaps?” the curse said.

“What’s that?” Itadori asked with a confused face.

“It’s a percussion instrument,” Fushiguro replied, wiping the dirt off his face.

Gojo hummed interest. “Well if he can do that then he will be able to swap fifty times in a second. That is if he intends to do that. He can easily decide not to and fool the enemy.”

“Of course, you will need to perform a Binding Vow to change the condition of your technique activation but I think that will be a fair exchange,” Sukuna said.

“Huh? You can do that?” Itadori asked. “Just change how your cursed technique works?”

“It’s still a Binding Vow,” Fushiguro said. “If Todo decides to take it, then he won’t be able to activate Boogie Woogie by clapping. So if his instrument is destroyed then he won’t be able to use his technique. Of course, he can break the Vow, but that isn’t ideal.”

Although Binding Vow created with oneself wasn’t as strict as those created with others, nobody wanted to find out what would happen if they broke it. The best care scenario was that they lost the ability they got after making the Binding Vow; as for the worst case… well, no one knew for sure.

Todo nodded as he listened to Sukuna and Gojo’s words. The teen seemed to be fully considering this feedback. Utahime wasn’t quite sure about listening to the King of Curses, but matters regarding cursed techniques were personal, so she let her student weigh his options himself.

Despite wanting to disappear, Atsuya could only resign himself to staying in the safe house. He still couldn’t accept the fact that he had to stay in the same building as the King of Curses. While he stiffened whenever he caught even a glimpse of pink, the students who had been here the longest didn’t even bat an eye when they saw Sukuna strolled past them. Sometimes, they would even call the curse and talk to him! Talked! With the King of Curses! Who did that? Better yet, what type of sorcerers just let a curse roam free like this?! 

There was also that white-haired curse user. That one was powerful, too, but they bowed around and followed Sukuna like a loyal dog. Not that he felt strange about someone strong following the King of Curses, but that monk also served the students. They made them snacks?! Since when did they start accepting bribes from curse users?! Gojo wasn’t included here since that guy would accept anything as long as it was sweets! The first time he saw Uraume in the kitchen, he had almost drawn his sword. The monk only glanced at him before returning to their task of making meals. Again, why was someone this strong get saddled with kitchen duty? 

To make matters worse, there was the dreaded mealtime. If he was about to have a heart attack seeing Uraume in the kitchen, he almost lost his soul when he found Sukuna sitting on the table. Eating. Okay, the eating part wasn’t weird. It was the fact that the students and Gojo acted as if this was normal. Atsuya should’ve expected Gojo’s students to be as crazy as him, especially the first years. All of them were small menaces that were about to be big menaces that would terrorize the Jujutsu world!

Don’t think Atsuya didn’t see those three Death Paintings that often hang around Itadori! What the hell? Wasn’t this place supposed to be a safe hideout for sorcerers? Why were there so many curses running around? He couldn’t do this. He wanted to go home. Was he the only one sane here? Yaga was lucky enough not to need to stay in this safe house for long, and Mei Mei also left for a while to pick up Ui Ui and deal with other businesses.

On the one hand, he had some time before he had to speak with Sukuna; on the other hand, he was almost alone here! There was Iori, but that woman was already so used to Gojo’s shenanigans that she barely batted an eye at this weird situation! He almost missed Okkotsu, who had just betrayed him for Gojo, but the kid left to accompany Yaga and met with the second years. To be fair, they would return here later after they managed to pull out Nanami, Ieri, and Ijichi, but why couldn’t he follow them? Oh yeah, he had to help the first years. 

Goddamn it. Why did Atsuya have to be so good at Simple Domain? Now he had to be trapped in this hell hole alone. His only hope was for Nanami to also get dragged here, which was more likely than not since that guy was one of Gojo’s favorite victims. Speaking of victims, the latest one that caught Gojo’s attention was Sukuna. The man could’ve picked any of his students, but he decided to mess around with the goddamned King of Curses. Atsuya had seen many times how close the curse got to using his cursed technique on Gojo. He was biting his lips so hard that he was bleeding. The first years even got involved and had to defend Sukuna from their teacher. He would’ve laughed at the ridiculous sight if not for the fact he was on the verge of panic.

Atsuya didn’t get a wink of sleep that night. The room he received was spacious, and the bed was soft. But how could a man sleep when he knew that death was residing in this very building? The world didn’t care for his suffering, though, and the sun got up cheerily as usual. His day got worse when he saw Mei Mei arriving with Ui Ui. Damn it. Why were they so quick? How much was Gojo paying that witch? 

“Kusakabe, you look horrible,” Mei Mei commented with a smile.

“And you look awfully chipper,” Atsuya grumbled. “What got you so excited huh? Just won a lottery?”

“No, merely the expectation of one,” she replied. Oh, she was definitely thinking up something, alright. Not that Atsuya cared; it wasn’t his business. Gojo could handle whatever scheme the witch was preparing.

Knowing that he couldn’t delay his dark fate, Atsuya accompanied Mei Mei and Ui Ui into the training hall. The first years, Gojo, and Sukuna were already there. 

Gojo greeted, “Yo! You guys certainly took your time.”

“The traffic was quite bad, we had to take a few detours,” Mei Mei replied. The traffic they were referring to was actually the people from the higher-ups. After the daring daylight robbery that Gojo’s students had performed in the Zen’in clan compound, those elders had gone frothing at the mouth. Although they were sorcerers, the higher-ups were now more focused on digging out Gojo instead of dealing with curses. Reaching this safe house was no easy task since they had to make sure they avoided being followed or tracked.

 “He~ Did you see how purple their face got when they heard the news about the Zen’in clan?” Gojo asked with a grin.

“Unfortunately, no, they have gotten rather paranoid ever since your disappearance,” Mei Mei said. “They must’ve feared that you may attempt an assassination.”

Gojo snorted. “When I kill them, I’m going to stride in and blast them directly on their old wrinkled faces.”

When, not if. Gojo had made up his mind, then. Atsuya glanced at the first years, but they didn’t bat their eyes when hearing their teacher conspiring about murdering the higher-ups. Ugh. Those were Gojo’s alright.

“So, when are we going to start?” Itadori asked expectantly.

“Um, well, before that,” Atsuya said. “What do you guys know about barriers and domains?”

Gojo pouted at the basic question. “Are you doubting my teaching skill?”

Frankly, yes. The students also somewhat agreed with him since they sent several looks at their teacher. The man pouted even harder.

“Itadori, you answer, since I have to teach you first,” Atsuya said.

Itadori scratched his cheek. “Um, Domain Expansion is the pinnacle of Jujutsu sorcery and it’s basically an arena that buffs the user and allows the caster to land sure-hit attacks?”

Okay, a bit video gamey, but the kid got the basic understanding. Atsuya nodded. “And barriers?”

“Barrier… it’s um…” Itadori began to sweat.

Sukuna sighed and put down the text he was holding. “A barrier is simply zones or territories established with Jujutsu. Domain Expansion is an advanced barrier technique. Although it sounds challenging, anyone with enough cursed energy and knowledge can learn to create barriers. While some barriers are simple, you can also use Binding Vows and talismans to place conditions or restrictions on the barriers you make.”

Oh wow. Sukuna was definitely a better teacher than Gojo. Atsuya couldn’t help but feel impressed. He had always thought that genius was shit teachers. 

“The barriers that appeared during the exchange event and Shibuya were made by Kenjaku,” Sukuna explained, “he’s a master at barriers and he can make powerful ones. For instance, the exchange event barrier specifically rejected Gojo Satoru and in exchange it allowed anyone to come in.”

Itadori and the students nodded along to the explanations.

“There were also those barriers that they placed around Shibuya. One to keep humans in, one to trap Gojo, and the last one to keep the sorcerers out,” Sukuna continued. “Only someone like Kenjaku can overlay those complex barriers without canceling each other.”

“Um, so what does this have to do with Simple Domain?” Itadori asked, tilting his head.

“Didn’t you just hear that Domains are basically advanced barriers?!” Kugisaki hit the boy on the head.

Itadori rubbed his head and said, “Ow! I know that but how does that help me learn Simple Domain?” 

“It won’t, really, understanding the theory and practicing it are two different things,” Gojo said.

“It’s still important to get the basics,” Atsuya shot back. This guy. Just because he could immediately pull off something without reading the theories didn’t mean that everyone could.

Gojo stuck out his tongue and pointed at the boy beside Mei Mei. “That’s why we will ask for Ui Ui’s help!”

The first years looked at the young sorcerer. The boy smiled and explained, “Although I mainly use my technique to teleport, my ability also allows me to switch the soul of someone with another. Of course, this will only occur if you guys give me permission. Also, I can only swap one person twice per month so please consider your pairings wisely.”

“Itadori will switch with me so I can hammer in cursed energy manipulation and the foundation of barrier technique,” Atsuya said. “Hopefully that will make you understand Simple Domain quicker.”

“We’ve already done the same thing,” Sukuna glanced at Itadori.

“We did?” the boy blinked.

“Whenever I took control and used my technique, your body instinctively remembered how to use those powerful skills,” the curse explained, “that’s why I expect you to be able to use my techniques and Domain. Better yet, you should also be able to grasp the Reverse Cursed Technique, considering how often I’ve been healing your body.”

Itadori lowered his head. “... Yessir.”

The other kids shot him a pitying look.

Oi, oi, oi. Cursed Technique, Simple Domain, Domain Expansion, and RCT? Wasn’t this a bit too much? Itadori would grasp these skills eventually but to expect the boy to understand these within a month seemed too far-fetched. 

“When did you use your Domain?” Gojo asked.

“Back in the detention center,” Sukuna replied, “that curse annoyed me so I sliced it to pieces with Malevolent Shrine. Speaking of Domains, Gojo, you should teach Yuta how to flip the internal and external condition of his barrier.”

“Hmm?” Gojo blinked.

“Kenjaku’s Domain Expansion uses an open barrier, so if you want to counter that then you have to be able to make it resistant to outside attack,” Sukuna said.

The adults’ eyes widened while the students looked confused. 

“But that’s impossible!” Atsuya blurted out. 

“Why?” the first years asked.

“Domain Expansion is an act of manifesting your Inner Domain into the real world,” Atsuya said, “Imagine that your Inner Domain is like water, there’s no way you can hold it without a vessel. It’s like using software without hardware! It’s just impossible!”

“But Fushiguro did?” Yoshino said, turning toward his friend.

“That’s not the same.” Atsuya shook his head. He had read the report about that mission. “Fushiguro still used a preexisting barrier from the cursed spirit so he still technically had one. What Sukuna is saying is-”

“It’s not impossible,” Sukuna stated.

Atsuya stopped and gulped. Damn it. He had forgotten that he was facing the King of Curses. He got so caught up in theories and understandings of Jujutsu sorcery that he forgot he was sitting before Sukuna. Luckily, the curse didn’t look affronted by his words and only stared calmly ahead.

“How do you do that then?” Gojo asked, leaning eagerly toward Sukuna. Atsuya was surprised; he had never seen the man look this engaged before. But after hearing Sukuna’s claim, that was to be expected. Even Gojo had to establish a barrier to expand his Domain. If Sukuna could do this impossible feat, then Atsuya would argue that he was better than Gojo in terms of barriers and Domain Expansion. The possibility of fighting someone this monstrous sent shivers down his spine. Luckily, the curse seemed on their side, at least for now.

Sukuna explained, “It’s a difficult skill to master. My Domain Expansion summons Malevolent Shrine which becomes the center of my Domain. Anything within its range will be attacked. Those with cursed energy are hit with Cleave and inanimate objects are destroyed with Dismantle. I can expand up to 200 meters, but I can also reduce the range if necessary.”

Atsuya gulped. Those sounded like one hell of a lethal Domain. He had seen glimpses of the King of Curses fighting in Shibuya. The curse could cut through anything in his path with a mere swing of his hand. Unleashing the full might of that power would render everything within the Domain’s radius dust. 

Gojo hummed as he tapped his chin, “Are you saying that you are imposing your Inner Domain into reality?”

“In a sense,” Sukuna said, “Regular Domains create a separate realm where you can establish your own rules into that pocket space. This allows sorcerers to easily bring out their Inner Domains and use their cursed techniques. Whereas mine and Kenjaku’s ignore that step and just bring it directly into reality. Of course, such a thing requires a lot of Cursed Energy and mastery. As far as I know, only Kenjaku and I manage to ever achieve this feat.”

While the young sorcerers still looked confused, the adults understood the gravity of Sukuna’s words. In the modern era, Gojo had been the ceiling that all the sorcerers and curse users looked up to. The man mastered the Limitless technique in his teens and then grasped Domain Expansion shortly after. His ability to easily understand numerous hard techniques that many struggled with for a lifetime made many people realize their position in the Jujutsu world. For them, Gojo Satoru was the strongest. Yet now, two more monsters revealed themselves. Although they were both remnants of an ancient era, these two had immediately climbed the ranks of the strongest sorcerers. While they knew Kenjaku’s mastery over seals and barriers, finding out the man could unleash an open barrier Domain was another matter. Sukuna was another beast who could challenge Gojo for the title of the strongest sorcerer.

“While my Domain is very powerful it’s not without weakness,” Sukuna continued, “if you can get out of the zone then you will be safe from the sure hit effect and since there is no barrier preventing you from leaving, you can do that.”

“That is if you even have the chance to run away,” Gojo replied with a grin, “I’m sure you can whip out that Domain of yours within less than a second.”

“Correct, Kenjaku can also do the same so you have to enter a Domain clash. Opening a Simple Domain will buy you some time, but you can also use Falling Blossom Emotions to reduce the wounds that you receive from my technique.”

“What’s that?” the students asked simultaneously.

“You know about that?” Gojo asked with interest.

Atsuya felt a bead of sweat rolling down his cheek. Oi, oi. Shouldn’t that technique be a secret? Since Gojo didn’t care about that skill being brought up, he explained, “It’s an anti-domain technique kept by the three big clans. It’s supposed to be a secret, though. It’s not useful against complicated Domains, like Unlimited Void, but it’s quite effective against simple ones.”

“Mine is merely slashing and cutting so using that technique can give you a bit of time,” the curse said. 

“But I doubt it’s strong enough to rival the output of a Domain,” Gojo said, “so in the end it has to be a Domain clash.”

Sukuna nodded. “I’ve never seen Kenjaku’s Domain so I can’t tell you what it will do or its range. Regardless, it is essential for that brat of yours to be able to change the condition of his Domain barrier or else it will get destroyed immediately.”

Atsuya felt that doing something like altering the condition of a Domain barrier was already a tall task, but these two were monsters who spoke about Domain Expansion as if it were a common skill. Did these two even consider whether the kids could even pull off something this unreasonable? Probably not. Geniuses. Once again, he was reminded that this mission was way above his pay grade. Ugh. He wanted to go home.
Notes:

    The manga has never clearly explained Sukuna’s and Kenjaku’s open-barrier Domains, so this is my take, lol. I also based this on other people's theories, but who knows if it’s true or not?

    I still haven’t decided what Kenjaku’s Domain sure hit effect will be, so feel free to share if you have any input or suggestions! In the manga it only shows Kaori's technique but I doubt Kenjaku's DE is that simple. I still want to use Womb Profusion though.

Chapter Text

Kinji had been feeling quite bored and cold. Most of the fights in Gachinko Fight Club were becoming stale. There weren’t any exciting fighters who could raise his passion. Just when he thought he would get very fed up, two new fighters showed up. A boy with bright pink hair and a girl with orange hair. He felt suspicious seeing two new faces, but he was bored, so why not let them create chaos? In the worst case, he would just have to kick them out. Well, his decision was correct. Those two certainly shook up the fights.

Although the girl looked weak initially, she was surprisingly agile and fast. She could easily handle opponents with bigger muscles and statures. The boy was also great. He was a lot more powerful and had a good grasp on how to put on a show for the audience. Kinji was in a dilemma. Having a female fighter was rare, and it would raise attention; on the other hand, the boy had a talent for fighting in front of an audience. Ultimately, he decides to call the boy first since Kinji has a lousy track record dealing with girls.

His first impression of Itadori Yuuji was that he was straightforward and honest. He could work with that. What mattered was whether or not the boy had ‘Passion’. The conversation went well until he received a call from Kirara. He paused. That was a signal for an emergency. Tch. Just when he had thought he would have a good day, Jujutsu High had to ruin his mood. He didn’t waste time and immediately attacked the teen. Surprisingly, Itadori managed to block his attacks. However, the teen was clearly holding back since he was trying to convince him to listen. He had no interest in listening to those stupid elders’ lackeys!

BANG!

Kinji kicked the teen’s chin, but despite being pummeled, the boy refused to budge and grasped his collar. The younger teen slammed his head with his and screamed, “Listen!”

“I don’t wanna!” Kinji yelled back and kicked him away. “I’ve already cooled off!”

The two clashed again before Kinji managed to push Itadori out of the room. Although he kept his eyes on his opponent, he registered the presence of three strangers standing beside Kirara. He noticed the girl fighting in the club, and seeing the other two boys confirmed that these teens had to be first-year students. 

“Itadori!” the unknown teens exclaimed.

“You guys stay out of this,” Itadori said while still staring at Kinji. 

“You’re underestimating me!” Kinji grinned as he slammed his fist on the boy’s face. His eyes widened when he felt the teen didn’t guard against him. 

Itadori slammed his palm against the ground and forced himself to stand up straight. With a harsh exhale, the teen forced a torrent of blood out of his nostrils. So the boy didn’t intend to dodge anything.

“You’re crazy.” Kinji smiled angrily. He might not be Gojo Satoru, who could hit like a truck with a simple finger flick, but his punch still dealt damage. Fine. If this were the game the boy wanted to play, then he would go along. He rotated his arm as he began to channel his cursed energy fully. “Alright, I’ll listen to what you’ve to say. As long as you remain standing, that is.”

“Kin-chan!” Kirara shouted. “These kids want your help! Listen to what they have to say!!”

“I just said that I’ll listen!” Kinji replied. So, the other brats managed to get Kirara’s approval. Interesting. 

“Hey, Itadori! We’ve never met before this so why do you come to me to ask for help?” Kinji asked.

“Because everyone said you’re strong,” Itadori replied.

Disappointing. With a swing of his fist, he sent the brat flying into the air. “When you ask another sorcerer for help, you’re asking them to risk their life for you! You gotta show enough ‘Passion’ to make me want to help you! But instead, you said you came here because someone told you to?! What the hell is that old Yaga thinking?! Isn’t he supposed to weed out weaklings like you!”

“Passion?” Itadori said with his head facing down. “I don’t know anything about that.”

“Ah?!” Was this brat trying to piss him off?!

The teen raised his bloodied face. “I just want to help others. That’s all.”

“Hey, hey, hey,” Kinji growled. “Are you serious? That’s so fucking boring!” What kind of loser shit was this brat spouting about!

“Itadori!” the black-haired student shouted. “That’s enough!”

SLAM!!!!

Kinji punched the kid so hard he got thrown straight at the wall. The boy didn’t stand up again. Tch. “Does it sting? According to Gojo, my cursed energy is rougher than most.” Seeing the kid not moving, he got a bit worried. “Did he die?” He turned to the other brats who were still watching. “You three! Hurry up, retrieve Itadori, and get lost! Never-”

Kinji’s stopped when he felt a presence behind him. He whirled around as he leaped back. What the hell? He hadn’t been holding back when he punched the kid. Since the teen hadn’t guarded against them, that should’ve hurt a lot. “What the hell are you made out of?” Kinji couldn’t help but feel impressed. Not many could handle his punches.

“I don’t get about this Passion you’re talking of,” Itadori continued, despite the blood rolling down his face. Slowly, he walked toward Kinji. “My role is to exorcise curses and help people. We need your help for that, so I’ll follow you everywhere until you say yes.” The boy stopped right in front of him and looked up with bright golden eyes. “Senpai, what’s your role?”

This brat! He kept saying this useless shit, but his eyes were alight with passion. “Fine, I’ll hit you as many times as it-!”

“Kin-chan!” Kirara cut in with a grin. “Aren’t you getting heated?”

Ugh. Kinji had been trying to ignore it but he couldn’t deny that Itadori’s stupid move to tank his punches made his passion burn again. He sighed. “... Come down. We can make a deal.” He was still so annoyed at having to work with Jujutsu High again that he whacked the boy on the head one more time.

“Ack!” Itadori yelped as he wobbled on his feet.

“Ahahaha!” Suddenly, a familiar laugh and presence appeared on the rooftop. Everyone immediately turned to the two new figures. The first one that caught Kinji’s attention was the striking, tall, white-haired man who could only be the infamous Gojo Satoru. “How nice to see that the first and third years get along~!”

“Are you blind!” the girl, Kugisaki, shouted at Gojo. “How can this even be remotely considered a good interaction!”

“Seriously, we’ve only been fighting,” the teen with long bangs said.

“How long have you been watching?” urchin head asked annoyedly.

“From the start, of course~,” Gojo replied with a grin. “I can’t exactly let my students get into trouble during this time, now, can I?”

“Shut up!” Kugisaki shouted.

“You were the one who assigned us to this mission, sensei,” the long bangs said.

“You could’ve just talked to Hakari-senpai directly and we could’ve avoided this whole mess,” urchin's head added.

“Eh, but where would be the fun in that?” Gojo pouted.

All the first years shot an unamused look at their teacher. Kinji chuckled. Well, it seemed Gojo hadn’t changed at all despite not seeing him for a long time. Well, he did change his weird white bandages with a black blindfold, but other than that, the man didn’t look like he had aged at all. Physically and mentally. He finally turned his attention to the other figure that showed up alongside Gojo. On the outside, the second person looked like a twin of Itadori, but something about his presence felt off. When those red eyes looked at him, Kinji instinctively stiffened as if he were facing a powerful opponent. The unknown man immediately turned his sight to the bloodied teen. He clicked his tongue and approached them.

Before Kinji realized it, he had already backed off from Itadori. He couldn’t understand why. This person didn’t have that much cursed energy at first glance, and he didn’t seem that powerful, but something deep within Kinji told him that he had to be wary of this man. The unknown man touched Itadori’s head and released his cursed energy. Within seconds, all the wounds on the boy’s body disappeared into nothing.

Reverse Cursed Technique?! Kinji only knew a handful of people who could do it and even fewer people who could use that skill on others. As far as he knew, only Ieri Shoko could perform healing on others using her RCT. That was why the elders kept such close eyes on her. Finding people who could fight was easy in the Jujutsu world, but good luck finding a healer. Kinji had never seen Ieri heal a heavily wounded person, but he had been under her care. As far as he knew, this guy had a better healing capability than her. 

“Thanks, Sukuna,” Itadori said with a sheepish smile.

“Next time you use that tactic, I’ll let you recover regularly,” the other replied testily.

Gojo suddenly appeared beside Sukuna and said, “Aiya, Sukuna, no need to be so mean to Yuuji-kun. It did look a bit rough, but his approach worked!” As he said these, he tried to put his arm on the other’s shoulders, but Sukuna easily sidestepped out of his reach. 

“Keep your filthy hands off me,” Sukuna said with distaste.

Itadori sighed but quickly put himself between the two men. “Sensei…”

“Can’t you just give up, blindfold?” Kugisaki cut in. “Your desperation is embarrassing.”

The other first years quickly got down and joined Itadori. They firmly placed themselves beside Sukuna and even shoved at Gojo to make him move away. The man pouted. “Why are you guys so mean?”

“Why are you so annoying?” urchin head asked.

Kinji knew that if he let this continue, it would devolve into Gojo throwing his usual drama and tantrums. The man might be a genius, but he had a screw loose. “Okay, okay, I agreed to listen to the kid, so why don’t you guys explain? I don’t get why Jujutsu High is so desperate for my help when you have this guy here.”

Gojo threw a bright grin at Kinji at the unintentional praise. Yep, still a manchild, alright. 

“We’ve explained that a bit to Hoshi-senpai,” urchin head said and began to clarify their situation. At the end of the explanation, both Kinji and Kirara’s eyes were as wide as saucers. Goddamn. He had missed a lot of shit, didn’t he? He knew something big happened in Shibuya, but since he didn’t like to pay much attention to matters related to Jujutsu High and the higher-ups, he only knew that there was a terrorist attack. How the hell could he expect that the Gojo Satoru would get his power temporarily sealed and then immediately exiled by those geezers? 

Kinji whistled. “So you guys are on the run, huh?”

“I mean, we haven’t been doing much running since we’re mostly staying in one place,” Itadori said.

“I already expected something bad was going to happen so I have some safe houses ready.” Gojo gave a thumbs up. His expression clearly said ‘Praise me.’ Unfortunately, nobody paid attention. 

“So, since Gojo is a bit useless now, you guys need extra firepower for the upcoming shit show, huh?” Kinji said, not looking at his teacher, who was pouting again. 

“Many people said you’re strong,” Kugisaki replied, putting her hands on her hips. “So are you in or not?”

“Before I answer that.” Kinji looked at Gojo, who was still dramatically clutching his chest and muttering that he was unappreciated. “What are you going to do after this?”

Kinji and Gojo stared at each other. He could still remember how they parted that day. Everyone knew of Gojo’s distaste against the elders, and Kinji also had the same opinion as him. Those good-for-nothing higher-ups only sat in their positions because they were born in big clans—those pieces of shit who never cared about the casualties and suffering of the sorcerers underneath them. As long as their clans continued to exist and prosper, then the world could go to shit for all they care. He hated their unreasonable and stupid clinginess toward propriety and traditions. He hated them so much that he couldn’t understand or accept why Gojo continued to become their attack dog. The man could’ve just blasted them to nothingness, and there was nothing they could do. Yet, the strongest sorcerer continued to work under them.

It was for this reason that he left Jujutsu High. Gojo had been ready to stand by his side and shield him from the elders’ wrath, but Kinji had enough. He didn’t want to keep working under the corrupt system that didn’t appreciate him. Oh, he knew about Gojo’s plan to change the Jujutsu society from the inside slowly, but he wasn’t that patient. For someone who would throw a tantrum over sweets, Gojo Satoru was a surprisingly forbearing individual. Perhaps if Kinji had been kinder, he would’ve stuck around for his teacher, but he knew that staying in Jujutsu High would stifle his passion. The only way he could spread his wings was by leaving. 

“Those geezers have abandoned you,” Kinji continued. Were you going to continue to follow them like a kicked dog? Licking their feet while you asked for forgiveness?

Gojo gave him a sharp smile filled with promises. “I’m going to take care of them, of course.”

Heh. Kinji grinned and lightly punched the man’s arm. It landed. “Fucking finally old man.”

Gojo pouted. “Old man? Let me tell you I’m still very young!”

Kugisaki rolled her eyes. “Yeah, yeah. We all know how blessed you are with your baby's smooth skin. Don’t gloat. It’s unseemly.”

“Alright, I agree to help you guys,” Kinji said, ignoring Gojo’s antics. “Since we’re gonna work together how about I hear your names? I only know Itadori and Kugisaki here.”

“Fushiguro Megumi,” urchin head replied while raising his hand. He then pointed at long bangs. “Yoshino Junpei.” The boy hesitated and glanced at the last unknown person. 

The red-eyed man observed Kinji and Kirara before saying, “Ryomen Sukuna.”

Ryomen? Not Itadori? Kinji glanced between Itadori and Sukuna. These two looked like twins. Itadori noticed his confusion and laughed weakly. “Um, Sukuna isn’t my sibling.”

“Come on, Kinji, you can’t be this bad at history,” Gojo said cheerily. 

Kinji narrowed his eyes at the man. He looked awfully happy about something. The name Ryomen Sukuna did feel familiar, but he couldn’t put his hands on where he had heard it before. Kirara elbowed him, and he saw his friend staring at Sukuna with wide and fearful eyes. “Kin-chan. Do you remember the King of Curses?”

The King of Curses? Of course, he knew. The biggest and baddest sorcerer in history who made many clans shat themselves. Kinji might not be a history nerd, but if you are a sorcerer, you would hear that name one way or another. Even if that guy was already dead a long time ago and only left behind twenty nasty fingers. Hold on. Didn’t that guy have another name? Hmm. His eyes widened when his brain finally remembered. He locked his eyes on the red-eyed man, who was still looking at him with blank eyes, and then turned toward his teacher, who was grinning madly.

“What the fuck have you done?!” Kinji demanded. “And why didn’t you mention this in your recap?!”

Fushiguro’s explanation of their situation was short and quick. Now that Kinji had thought about it, he realized there were many holes and questions he didn’t know how to answer. Like how the fuck Gojo knew about Kenjaku’s plan to seal him with the Prison Realm. 

“We can’t stay here for long,” Fushiguro defended himself. “If you agree to help, you can come with us to the safe house and we’ll explain everything in detail.”

Kinji growled in frustration. He knew Gojo was insane, but this was a new record. Taking Okkotsu as his student was one thing, but letting the King of Curses incarnate was another matter. “Fine, at least tell me how you get this guy here.”

Sukuna didn’t seem offended at being pointed at by Kinji. In fact, the curse seemed to be tuning them out and was staring into space. Ugh. Did this guy not care about being surrounded by sorcerers who were supposed to exorcise him? 

“Ah, well that was my fault.” Itadori raised his hand. “I, uh, I ate Sukuna’s Finger a few months ago.”

Kinji could only stare at Itadori. Goddamn. This kid was even crazier than his previous expectations. Who the hell dared to eat that crusty old thing? Even if you weren’t a sorcerer, you knew those fingers were bad news. Then again, Gojo had the habit of picking up the most fucked up kids. Prime example number one: Okkotsu. He should’ve known that man could find a mad kid who would chow down on a centuries-old finger. 

Gojo accepted Kinji’s incredulous look with a bright grin. ‘Do you like your kouhai?’ that expression of his said.

Kinji examined the rest of the first years. He was most familiar with Itadori, but he had also seen how Kugisaki fought. That girl might not hit as hard as Itadori, but she had fierceness in her moves. While he hadn't interacted with Fushiguro and Yoshino much, those two seemed to have gained Kirara’s approval. 

Heh. Kinji still wasn't sure about this whole King of Curses being incarnated in the modern world, but his gut told him that the future would get interesting.

Previously, Kento had divided his career as a sorcerer as before being a salaryman and after. After experiencing the recent events, he felt he had to add another divider: before and after Shibuya. Kento had willingly returned to Jujutsu High despite knowing he would be under heavy scrutiny by the elders. Even though he hated to admit it, many people had this assumption that he and Gojo were close. Well, he had the misfortune of being under him for one year while studying at Jujutsu High, but the closeness during their professional period was wholly Gojo's fault. That man was the one who couldn't stop annoying Kento despite his best attempts to keep his distance. 

Kento’s decision to return to Jujutsu High was motivated by two reasons. First, they would need an insider who could monitor the elders. Second, Kento wanted to reduce his time stuck in the same building as Gojo to a minimum. Since he was firmly in Gojo's camp, he knew he would eventually have to leave and go into hiding. However, he still wished to limit that duration, so he tried to stay at the Jujutsu Central despite the higher-ups slowly losing their minds as Gojo remained missing. The elders got even more paranoid when they heard the news of the break-in at the Zen’in clan compound. He still didn't know why Gojo ordered the students to rob one of the three big clans, but there had to be a good reason. He hoped. 

While he didn't enjoy having the elders’ spies breathing down his neck, Kento still wished that peaceful period goodbye as he left Jujutsu High with Ieri and Ijichi. After Gojo got exiled, the tension in the Jujutsu world had gotten extremely high. Although the big clans proclaimed themselves as the head of this hidden society, it was obvious that many sorcerers looked toward Gojo Satoru for guidance. With the man’s fate continuing to be uncertain, many sorcerers had pulled back. They didn't know whether the safety net they had come to enjoy was gone. If Gojo was dead, then they would need to prepare themselves for the decline, if not destruction, of Jujutsu society. If Gojo was alive, then there would be a big clash between the strongest sorcerer and the higher-ups. Either way, many knew better than placing themselves on the other team. Unless you were born in the big clans or crazy enough to think you could challenge Gojo, not many people wanted to get in the way of the Six Eyes wielder. 

On a bright sunny day, Kento finally arrived at the safe house where Gojo and his team had been hiding. As expected, the man didn't hold back and prepared a large land and building that could hold many people. If it hadn't been for the layers of barriers protecting this site, Kento would've thought that this was merely one of Gojo's holiday mansions. Should the elders somehow find out about this safe house, they might get an aneurysm. None of the people who had been in hiding from the higher-ups looked worried or stressed. When he arrived, the students were training as usual, as if they were still at Jujutsu High. His eyebrow raised when he saw the suspended third-year student.

“Yo!” Hakari greeted him. “I thought you would be here before me.”

Although he was the closest with Fushiguro before meeting Itadori, Kento had worked with Hakari several times. Like any of Gojo's students, the teen had his own quirks that made him incompatible with rules and the higher-ups. “Someone has to stay behind.”

Hakari snorted. “Sure you are.” The boy easily saw through his lie. “Dunno if your decision to let Gojo unmonitored is good or not.”

Kento felt a familiar headache building up. “What has he done now?”

“What hasn't he done more like?” Hakari said.

Kento dreaded hearing the answer, but he knew he had to find out. At that moment, a huge crash occurred somewhere in the building, accompanied by a familiar dark signature. He tensed and immediately ran toward the location. Hakari followed him, and they arrived to see two people fighting outside. 

Gojo and Sukuna clashed with a flurry of fists and kicks. A broken window nearby was likely the reason for the ruckus Kento had just heard. He also noticed some small debris on Gojo’s shirt, implying that the man had been thrown out of the window. 

Kento’s hand went to his weapon. How could Sukuna come out? Shouldn't Itadori have full control over the King of Curses? Before he could intercept the fight, he heard a yell coming from inside the building. He glanced to see the kids watching from the broken window.

“Go, Sukuna! Beat him up!” Kugusaki yelled while framing her mouth with her hands.

“This is bound to happen eventually.” Fushiguro sighed. 

“I think Sukuna has been way too patient with sensei,” Yoshino added. “He has continued to mess with him even after being warned so many times.”

Itadori was covering his face with his hands. “I tried to stop them. I really did.”

The boys patted their friend's shoulders. “There, there. It's not your fault.”

What? Kento couldn't understand what the hell was going on. How could Sukuna and Itadori be out simultaneously? Also, why were the students so calm and only watched the fight? No, they were actually cheering for the curse.

“Hey, you two!” Kusakabe suddenly kicked the door open to get outside. “If you wanna fight, don't do it near the building! Go to the woods before you destroy the house!!!”

BAM!

This time, Sukuna got kicked back, but he quickly got back on his feet. Although the two didn't respond to Kusakabe, they still brought their fight farther away from the building.

Kusakabe turned to the students who were still watching. “And you four! Don't you have training that you need to do instead of watching those monsters fight?!”

“Boo! Let us have fun!” Kugisaki replied.

“It's rare to see sensei getting hit,” Yoshino protested, and Fushiguro nodded in agreement. Itadori was still hiding his face.

“Well, isn't this lively?” Maki suddenly said from beside Kento. The man turned toward the second years, who also spectated the battle between Gojo and Sukuna. The teen had cut her long hair and was now sporting a bob like her twin.

Okkotsu laughed weakly beside her. “Gojo-sensei really needs to stop annoying Sukuna-san.”

“Salmon,” Inumaki said.

“It can't be helped,” Panda added. “Sensei rarely meets someone with his level of power so it's understandable that he gets excited.”

“More like annoying,” Maki replied. 

Again, with the easy acceptance of this strange event. What the hell had happened while Kento was away? The man turned to Hakari, who was smirking. “Don't look at me. It's better if you ask the first years; they have been here the longest, after all.”

Oh, Kento would certainly get to the bottom of this. He approached the still-spectating first years, and Itadori finally noticed his presence. “Nanamin!”

Kento wanted to correct the boy over the nickname, but he had higher priorities for now. He pointed at the small figures of Sukuna and Gojo fighting in the distance. “Explain.”

The four students exchanged glances. Fushiguro said, “I already explained to Hakari-senpai. I don't want to do it again.”

“Ugh, fine,” Kugusaki rolled her eyes and began telling Kento everything he had missed while he wasn't keeping an eye on Gojo. The other boys also added their own inputs to the narration. The explanation was quite a mess since the kids couldn't stop expressing opinions about past events. Kento figured out their current situation, and frankly, he didn't like it. 

“So, Sukuna is just out every day now?” Kento asked. None of the kids showed any concern over that sentence and only nodded. He sighed. “And Gojo allow this?”

“You haven't seen how he acts around Sukuna.” Kugisaki snorted. “I think he'll throw a tantrum if he doesn't get his daily annoying Sukuna fix.”

“To be fair, Gojo-sensei was very wary of Sukuna initially,” Fushiguro added. “He just had a… change of heart, I suppose.”

“Wait! Could it be that the Phantom Thieves stole Gojo-sensei's heart?” Yoshino said.

Itadori threw a doubtful look at him. “I don't think they exist, Junpei. Also even if they were, why would they steal sensei’s heart? If they did, why would he become worse then?”

Kento didn't get what the two boys were saying so he ignored them in favor of massaging his forehead. Perhaps, it was his mistake for leaving Gojo unsupervised for so long.

Despite Gojo and Sukuna keeping their fight away from the building, the other residents began to gather to watch the two. Kento couldn't understand how the adult sorcerers could continue to stand by and let those two cause chaos. The kids had an excuse for being immature, but the adults? Maybe not Kusakabe. Kento was already impressed that the man dared to order the two to take their fight further away. But even Principal Yaga was just standing there.

“It's better for them to blow off some steam,” the man said.

Mei Mei chuckled. “Too bad they're not at full power. I think I can make a lot of money streaming their battle.”

Ijichi looked horrified at the thought of the strongest sorcerer and the King of Curses seriously fighting. He let out a small whimper and took several steps back. Not that would help him survive if those two ever go all out. Ieri was idly twirling the unlit cigarette between her fingers as she silently observed the fight. Not worried at all about her old friend.

As far as a battle between two of the strongest sorcerers went, it was quite tame. Both of them had most of their powers locked away, so they could only use martial arts. However, that didn't stop them from causing destruction. At one point, they even took their fight to the sky and clashed in mid-air. Maki hummed in interest when she saw this.

Although Gojo and Sukuna could continue fighting, the battle ended when another person arrived at the estate. It was the curse user with white hair who had been following the King of Curses. Sukuna disengaged from the fight and gracefully landed near the monk. Gojo followed a second after with a pout on his face.

“Forgive me, Sukuna-sama, I’ve failed to obtain the last one,” Uraume said while offering a bundled package with a lowered head.

“That's fine, it's not as if it's left in the wild,” Sukuna took the offering and opened it to reveal three of his fingers.

While most of the sorcerers tensed at the miasma that the cursed objects exuded, Gojo leaned closer to take a look. “So this is what you sent them off for. How many have Yuuji eaten anyway?”

“I've sixteen fingers worth of power,” Sukuna replied. “Fifteen were consumed by the brat while one was sealed inside him by Kenjaku.”

Kento stiffened at the reminder that Itadori was a product of Kenjaku’s experiment. It seemed that being the child of the reincarnated Sukuna’s twin wasn't enough. That curse user also placed one of the fingers inside the kid when he was just a baby. He clenched his fist. With how Itadori was born, there was no way the kid ever had hopes of living a normal life.

“Hmm, so with these three that means you have nineteen then,” Gojo said. “Wanna know the location of the last one?”

“You have it, correct?” Sukuna replied. “I think you've been hiding that finger to stop the execution.”

Gojo grinned. His expression clearly showed that Sukuna's guess was correct.

“Sensei!” Itadori, who had come outside after seeing the two returning, looked astonished at this revelation. “Why did you do that?”

“What? Do you think I'll just let those geezers kill one of my students? You wound me Yuuji-kun!” Gojo threw his arms around the kid and put his knuckles on the teen's head.

“Ow! Ow! Ow! But didn't you promise that you'll be my executioner?” Itadori asked.

“Seriously? You're still planning on doing that?” Kugisaki asked.

The other students sent him disapproving looks. Kento sighed. He had always known that Itadori had a self-sacrificial streak. That boy was more than happy to let himself die if that would save others. 

“No need to worry about that, Yuuji-kun.” Gojo tightened his hold on the teen. “Everyone was afraid of you since they didn't want to imagine the King of Curses going on a rampage. But as you can see here~” The man pointed at Sukuna, who remained impassive. “I don't think your dear uncle will go on a killing spree any time soon. I can certainly see him going murderous if someone tries to kill you, though.”

“I'm not his uncle,” Sukuna replied as he threw the bag holding the cursed objects at the boy. Gojo released his hold to let the teen catch it. “Eat it.”

“Eh? Me?” Itadori looked at the fingers with disgust.

Sukuna sighed. “Who else? It's not as if I can eat it since my body is only a clone from a cursed tool.”

Itadori groaned but picked up one of the fingers. He looked at the object and asked, “Should I eat all of them or one per day?”

“It doesn't matter,” Sukuna replied, “I can't take over with Kenjaku's seal preventing me from controlling your body.”

“Just eat them all and get it done, potato head,” Kugisaki said.

Itadori still looked reluctant but quickly swallowed the cursed object. This was the first time Kento had witnessed the boy consume the fingers. Hearing the kid's disgusted noises, he didn't have to imagine how bad it tasted. Dark markings began manifesting on Itadori’s skin, but the boy didn't stop and ate the second one. With each finger the teen ate, the stronger Sukuna’s dark aura was within the boy. 

Gojo examined Itadori with his Six Eyes when he finished eating. “I don't think the seal is absorbing it.”

Sukuna nodded. “I can still access the cursed energy from those fingers.”

Seeing Itadori looking a bit green, Fushiguro quickly took out candy and offered it to his friend. The boy accepted the sweet gratefully and ate the candy. “It still tastes horrible.”

“You still have one finger left though,” Junpei said.

Itadori groaned.

Gojo grinned. “Want me to bring it here?”

Before Itadori could protest, Sukuna shook his head and said, “No.”

Everyone looked at the curse in surprise. One would've thought the King of Curses would be eager to recover more of his original power. 

“Keep it,” Sukuna continued, “consider it an insurance.”

Gojo pursed his lips, and Uraume looked apprehensive. There was a topic that only those three knew. Kento didn't understand, and he could see the students were also unaware.

Gojo clicked his tongue. “You and Yuuji are surprisingly alike.”

Kento wasn't sure what Gojo meant by those words, but Sukuna clearly understood. “I'm merely being realistic.”

“I’ve never made that promise, you know,” Gojo said.

“Then you’re a fool,” Sukuna replied before leaving.
Notes:

    Since Sukuna has been protecting Yuuji from his worst trauma, the boy isn’t stuck on the cog mentality. But I think Yuuji still hasn’t gained the revelation that he will get during the Shinjuku showdown.
    Hakari and Gojo never have a conversation in the manga, so I can only guess how they will act around each other. I find it impossible that Gojo will let his students get suspended for going against the elders. The only thing I can think of is if Hakari decides to leave by his own choice. At that point, Gojo will respect his decision even if he disagrees. This is just my take, though.
    I believe this will be the last chapter in the preparation arc. I'll probably take another break since I need to figure out the plot for the next arc. There are gonna be a lot of fight scenes. My kryptonite!!!

Chapter 27

Chapter Text

Sasaki Setsuko had a pretty tough year. Although it had started quite well in her new high school, everything went horribly when she picked up that cursed object. Apparently, ghosts and monsters were real, and she had done something terrible by unsealing that old finger. Iguchi had been hospitalized, but he eventually recovered. Itadori, who also witnessed the horrible event, left the school to join another. She tried to remain in contact with him. Although the teen tried to reply, it was obvious that he was busy and keeping secrets. Based on her experience, she knew that it was in her best interest to keep her distance. 

So, even though Setsuko felt bad, she no longer tried to message Itadori. While she couldn’t stop thinking about the occult world, she had started to believe that dark part of reality no longer had any connection to her. That continued to be the case until she woke up one day to hear the news that a massive black barrier appeared around a part of Tokyo and completely swallowed Shinjuku. It had become the number one news in Japan and even overseas. Nobody could find out what the hell it was, and nobody could enter the area.

Setsuko quickly pulled out her phone and opened the chat with Itadori. 

[Me: Itadori! Have you seen the news?!]

[Me: Is this related to those curses you talked about?]

Setsuko continued to stare at her screen, but her messages remained unread. She bit her lip. What the hell was going on?

A large crowd had formed around the black barrier that suddenly showed up within Tokyo. Numerous regular humans watched in curiosity and wariness at this strange event. Police had gathered to prevent people from getting close, but many still milled around to take photos or videos. One journalist was trying to talk with the police, but then her attention was caught by movement on the rooftops. It was a group of people traveling at fast speed as if they were running on flat ground instead of uneven roofs. Unlike many people who tried to get inside, the barrier didn't reject these individuals.

“Hey, did you see that?” the journalist yelled and pointed up, but she was too late. The whole group had been swallowed by the black wall.

Just like Sukuna had predicted, Kenjaku finally opened one of the barriers he had prepared for the Culling Game. To make matters worse, he activated the one in Shinjuku. Sukuna had almost wanted to retreat back inside Yuuji after feeling a bad premonition, but he knew he had to fight. Kenjaku opted to use the same strategy as the one he used in Shibuya. With civilians as his hostages, he ordered the appearance of Gojo Satoru and Itadori Yuuji.

“Guess we should accept the invitation,” Gojo said with a grin.

And so they traveled into the trap Kenjaku had prepared for them. Except for Choso and Yuta, everyone in the safe house ventured into Shinjuku. Those two were assigned to help Tsukumo Yuki guard Tengen. Even if they managed to deal with the incarnated sorcerers and the barrier, there would be no point if Tengen still fell into Kenjaku’s hands. Despite knowing this, the young special grade had been reluctant to let his friends and teacher enter the battlefield without him.

“But I can help,” Yuta protested.

“No one knows for sure if you can exit once you enter,” Sukuna replied. “It’s better if you protect Tengen in case Kenjaku uses this as a distraction so he can go after his true objective.”

“Come on Yuta-kun,” Gojo said as he placed his hand on the teen’s shoulder. “This is an important task, okay? I trust you.”

Yuta sent a weak glare at his teacher. He knew that those words were merely an attempt to coax him. In the end, he could only sigh. “Alright, but make sure all of you come out safe.”

“Of course! They have the strongest sorcerer with them, after all!” Gojo gave a thumbs-up.

Although they entered the barrier as a group, they ended up getting separated immediately. Sukuna wasn’t sure why he still remained beside Yuuji. Perhaps the barrier considered them as one person, or perhaps it was because he had been holding the kid’s hand when they entered. Even if they got separated, Sukuna was still tied to Yuuji, so it wasn’t difficult for him to track the boy down. Unfortunately, while they safely made their way into Shinjuku. A problem immediately reared its head. 

“Found you~.” Yuuji and Sukuna stiffened as they looked up. Above them was a young woman flying with insect wings. Her dark hair was tied into a high ponytail, and there was a crazy wide smile on her face. “Su~ku~na~.” With each syllable, her eyes became even more curved.

Sukuna clicked his tongue. He knew they aimed to save Tsumiki, but meeting this person was still unpleasant. While the original mostly felt ambivalent about many things, Yorozu had managed to make herself into enough of an annoyance that Sukuna could still feel the remnants of the original’s distaste toward this person. He could clearly remember all the times this woman had jumped on the King of Curses while yelling that she would teach him about love. No matter how many times he tried to kill her, the lunatic always returned. “Yorozu.”

“Ah, you still remember my name!” the ancient sorcerer said happily. It shouldn’t be possible, but Sukuna swore he could see pink hearts coming from her.

Yuuji looked very weirded out that Megumi’s sister was acting like this. After all, she had been sleeping peacefully the last time he had seen her. Seeing her serene face being contorted into strange expressions had to be a peculiar sight. He whispered, “You know her?”

“Unfortunately,” Sukuna replied.

“Hey, Sukuna!” Yorozu said, “Do you still remember what I promised you? I’ll be the one to teach you about love. I want to be the one who kills you, and I want you to be the one who kills me! So let’s fight okay~”

“What?” Yuuji looked even more confused. “I-is this an old courtship ritual or something?”

“No,” Sukuna drily said. “She’s just sick in the head.”

Although Sukuna didn’t keep his voice low, Yorozu didn’t look angry over the insult. She continued, “Say, if you’re still alive after our fight, can you promise me one thing~?”

“That won’t happen.” Sukuna shifted into a fighting stance, and Yuuji mimicked him. No way he would ever let her do whatever she wanted.

Yorozu covered her face, yet the gesture failed to hide her manic grin. “Let’s get married okay! I’ll be your legal wife, and no concubines are allowed!” Her breath became faster as his face reddened while she got lost in her fantasies. “For our wedding ceremony, let’s destroy at least three villages, and at the wedding reception, let’s behead the most handsome men! Then, we can all write Haiku as they shrivel up!”

“Ack! Is she a real-life yandere?!” Yuuji exclaimed in horror as he glanced between the woman and Sukuna. How did you get the attention of this insane person? Those eyes wordlessly asked. 

Sukuna had enough of this nonsense and sent Dismantle flying toward Yorozu. She blocked it with liquid metal, and while most people would be afraid of his power, the woman looked even more excited. Che. He actually felt regret that he hadn’t taken over Megumi’s body. At least if he had Ten Shadows, he wouldn’t have to use his original technique against this mad woman. Ugh. He felt dirty. 

“It’s a promise!” Yorozu screamed, and they clashed.

Megumi clicked his tongue when he finally gathered himself. It seemed the barrier had spat them at random locations and forcefully separated them. He seemed to be near the middle of Shinjuku, and the area was deserted. Perhaps the civilians had all left to the border of the barrier in an attempt to escape. He pondered over heading there so he could meet with the others and help evacuate the regular humans. Before he could make a choice, his instinct flared, and he immediately dodged sideways to avoid an explosion. Divine Dog appeared to cushion his fall, and he got up to face two figures.

“Good reaction,” the man with long hair said. “The name is Reggie Star and this one Iori Hazenoki. You must be one of the modern sorcerers, yeah?”

Megumi frowned. “What of it?”

“Hmm well,” Reggie said, scratching his chin. “We’re actually ordered to hunt down Sukuna and the other strong guy, what’s his name? Gojo?”

“What? You’re afraid of fighting those two, so you want to face someone weaker?” Megumi asked.

“No, no, but I figured they wouldn’t be coming in alone,” Reggie replied, “and it’s better to remove unwanted factors first. Like you.”

Megumi didn’t believe that at all. Sukuna and Gojo might have been weakened, but they were still powerful and could go toe-to-toe with special grades. That was fine. These two were ancient sorcerers whose goal was to take care of them. He wanted to find Tsumiki quickly, and instead of running around blindly in Shinjuku, he might get some information after beating these two.

The two ancient sorcerers noticed Megumi’s intent to fight and they also got into position. Hazenoki actually pulled out his own eyeball and threw it at Megumi. The boy was shocked for a moment, but he immediately got out of the blast zone when he felt the opponent’s cursed energy spiked up. Unfortunately, that made him open to attack from behind, and Reggie showed up to kick him.

Megumi managed to recover and slipped into the man’s shadow and appeared behind him. He threw the man away, but when Hazenoki ran up toward him, a familiar jellyfish shikigami appeared to wrap their tentacles around the man. 

“Need some help?” Yoshino asked.

Megumi grinned. “Not really, but thanks for joining.”

Now, it was two versus two.

Nobara knew that ancient sorcerers would be weird. Hell, most modern sorcerers at least had one screw loose in their heads, but this was something else. When the barrier separated her from the group, she immediately encountered a strange woman. Che. Not that she was against people showing skins, but wasn’t this a bit much? Not only had the ancient sorcerer taken over a poor woman’s body, but this person also decided to skip wearing any clothing and only covered the most private bits using her cursed technique. Ugh. The audacity.

“What’s with that face?” Uro Takako asked.

“Nothing, it’s just that looking at someone like you makes me want to puke,” Nobara said as she pulled out her Homing Needles. She didn’t quite get her opponent’s cursed technique, but it seemed tricky. The woman seemed to be able to manipulate space and was able to fly unhindered. Nothing overpowered like Gojo, but still annoying enough that it would cause her trouble.

The ancient sorcerer’s face twisted in anger. “You wretch. You should be grateful to even have a chance to face the captain of the Sun, Moon, and Stars Squad.”

“What’s that? A no-name cult?” Nobara taunted. Oh, she knew about that group. She might not like history that much, but she knew about the old group of assassins belonging to the Fujiwara clan.

Uro looked even more enraged at her response. Huh. This woman was extremely prideful and emotional. “I’ll tear out your tongue, you bitch!”

Nobara threw her Homing Needles which the ancient sorcerer easily dodged. When she was about to order her cursed weapons to move, she felt the space around her warp and she got sent flying several feet.

BAM! BAM! BAM!

Nobara’s ears were ringing, and she spouted out a mouthful of blood, but she forced herself to stand up. With a grin, she wiped the blood from her face. “God damn, that hurt.” She was extremely glad that she had experienced those personal beatings by Sukuna, Gojo, and Maki. If she had been like before, there was no way she could still fight after that attack.

“Still awake?” Uro said as she landed before the young sorcerer. “You’re more sturdy than I thought.”

“Thanks,” Nobara replied. “I have great teachers.”

Before the ancient sorcerer could use her technique again, Nobara got close and tried to punch her. The woman evaded her fist and retaliated. The girl crouched down and tried to kick her feet. Her hit landed and destablized Uro. Nobara grinned as she swung her fist toward her opponent’s face. Yet, instead of blocking, the ancient sorcerer pulled on the air and warped Nobara’s hand. The girl only had a split second to feel terrified at her noodly arm before the woman slammed her elbow on her face.

Nobara was knocked back several feet, but she managed to land safely. She quickly examined her arm and noticed it was back to normal. ‘It didn’t hurt.’

“Curious?” Uro said as she approached Nobara. “My cursed technique treats the sky as a surface.”

Hmm. What a tricky technique. Her opponent was strong, but as long as Nobara could get a part of her body, things would be in her favor.

Uro didn’t let the girl have more time to ponder her strategies before she got close again. This time, instead of punching her, the woman put her wrist close and spread her palms open. The surface around her hands began to ripple.

Shit.

Thin Ice Breaker!

BANG!

Uro frowned. Her hit should’ve landed, yet she couldn’t feel any impact that should have occurred when her attack hit a body. When the dust settled, she couldn’t see the girl’s body. Then, she noticed two presences behind. She whirled around just in time to dodge a strike from a fast-moving needle. It landed on the ground and exploded.

Hairpin!

Uro clicked her tongue and examined her opponents. Besides the girl, there was now an older male teen who didn’t wear any shirt. 

“Thanks, Todo,” Nobara said as she wiped dirt off her cheek. “That would’ve hurt a lot. What did you swap me with?”

“Just a rock imbued with my cursed energy,” Todo replied.

Nobara grinned. Two versus one. With Todo helping her, her chances of winning increased significantly.

Kinji didn’t feel any panic when he immediately got separated after entering the barrier. Sukuna had warned them that this might happen when they headed out. He encountered some cursed spirits on the way, but he was immediately drawn to a massive shikigami. Wondering why nobody else headed here, he approached the creature to meet with its owner.

“Youch,” Kinji said when he found an old man sitting cross-legged on a rock. “Should’ve known the master of this ugly beast is also ugly.”

Dhruv Lakdawalla’s wide-eyed stared down at Kinji. “Brats like you should know their place.”

“Nah, I’m not good with authority.” Kinji dodged an attack from a pteranodon shikigami. Hmm. His instinct was telling him that something was off with that big shikigami. Well, that’s fine. 

“Domain Expansion: Restless Gambler!”

Dhruv’s expression became pinched as new information got shoved into his brain. The old man gritted his teeth and stood up. “What a ridiculous technique.”

“Heh, you’re not the first one to say that, old man.” Kinji grinned.

Ishigori Ryu had been rather displeased when he was incarnated just to be pitted with the King of Curses. Perhaps this was heaven’s way of telling him he had been greedy. But how could he be satisfied with his first life? He might’ve been very blessed to be born in a high-ranking station and had a ‘fulfilling life’ and a good wife, yet he had never felt full. That was why he accepted Kenjaku’s offer. Not that he was afraid of facing strong opponents, but the King of Curses? That guy was another thing entirely. Kenjaku might’ve weakened Sukuna, but Ryu wasn’t stupid enough to think he could challenge that monster.

So, he decided to stay behind and look for something to his taste. Sitting on a tall building, he observed Dhruv entering a fight with one of the modern sorcerers. Although that teen seemed interesting, he had no desire to fight alongside that old man. He wanted to enjoy his dessert on his own in peace. 

‘Is there nobody interesting left?’ Ryu scratched his cheek.

“Aren’t you a bit too relaxed?” a voice suddenly said behind him.

Ryu immediately turned around to see a young woman with short hair standing before him. He hadn’t registered her getting close at all. What the hell? The ancient sorcerer tried to get a feel of his opponent, but he couldn’t register anything. It was as if she didn’t exist at all in terms of cursed energy.

“What the hell are you?” Ryu asked in anticipation. His heartbeat picked up as he felt like he had found his dessert.

“You can call me Maki,” the woman said as she brandished her long sword. “You’re one of the ancient sorcerers, right? Don’t know what your deal is with Kenjaku, but we can’t let you go free.” The blade glinted against the sunlight, and its sharp edge promised death.

Ryu grinned. It seemed his dessert had finally arrived.

Kento wasn’t sure if he should consider himself lucky. The group had been immediately dispersed throughout Shinjuku when they entered the barrier. Although they were quite far away, he could hear the sounds of battle throughout the city. He was dropped near the edge of the barrier, and he found several groups of humans. While Kenjaku had used civilians as bait, it seemed the man had let them leave when Gojo and Sukuna entered his trap. Of course, regular humans still need to journey to exit the barrier on their own feet.

“Please stay close and follow me,” Kento told the scared civilians. They were confused and afraid of the current situation. They would’ve expected to go on their usual daily routine this morning. Get up. Feed the kids. Send them to school. Go to work. Yet that mundane life was abruptly interrupted when a massive barrier fell over Tokyo. Although many managed to escape, there was no doubt numerous souls also perished. 

While the civilians looked doubtful of Kento, they didn’t have much choice. After seeing him taking down one of the monsters with a swing of his weapon, they knew that at least the man could protect them.

Together, they advanced toward the edge of the barrier. As they walked through the empty and ruined street, Kento raised his arm to order the group to stop wordlessly. He felt a cursed spirit’s presence inside one of the alleys before them. A massive creature that took the shape of a rodent showed up not a second later. The civilians shrieked in fear and tried to take a step back. Kento was about to strike his enemy when another blade cut down the monster with one slash. The curse fell to the ground and disappeared into nothing.

Click.

Kusakabe sheathed his katana gracefully and said, “Sorry about that. I see you manage to find some civilians.”

“Kusakabe-san,” Kento said. This acknowledgment was more for the scared civilians behind him, so they knew the new person was an ally. “Have you encountered the others?”

“Yup, just saw Ieri, Nitta, Ijichi, and Yaga,” Kusakabe replied. “They have found a safe spot where they can set up our base. Mei Mei has also spread her crows to keep an eye on things. I think Utahime, Kirara, and Inumaki were also dropped near the edge so they’ve been helping the civilians.”

Kento nodded. Then, he would expect the rest of the group to have engaged with the ancient sorcerers. He motioned to the civilians behind him to keep walking. Despite being afraid, they could only follow his instructions so they could escape this hellhole. 

As they walked toward the barrier, Kento whispered, “Any sign of Kenjaku?”

“Nah, I don’t think anyone has seen him yet,” Kusakabe replied. 

That wasn’t good. As long as Kenjaku remained alive, the curse user would continue to cause chaos. They could only hope the man would not use this chance to go into hiding. A prolonged battle against someone with that level of intellect was never wise.

Kashimo Hajime was dissatisfied and angry. When he had made that deal with Kenjaku, he had been hoping to get a chance to fight Sukuna. He wanted a one-on-one duel against the strongest, but when he awoke after his death, he was ordered to become one of many assassins who would hunt down the King of Curses. He had felt so enraged that he wanted to kill Kenjaku. Che. The only thing that stopped him was the possibility that he would meet Sukuna if he followed the man’s plan.

Now, as Hajime explored the modern city, he didn’t bother to chase after those weak humans who couldn’t even use cursed energy. Kenjaku had released a ton of cursed spirits in Shinjuku, but even those couldn’t manage to get him to drop a single sweat. His attention was drawn to a strange sight. There was a panda. Initially, he thought the thing had escaped from the zoo, but then he realized that it was a cursed corpse. Finally, something interesting.

BAM!

Hajime punched the panda and with a swing of his Nyoi staff, he sent it crashing onto a wall. When he started to feel disappointed, the animal actually got up again. This time, it resembled the shape of a gorilla. Hajime grinned, “Good.”

DANG!

The man blocked the massive fist flying toward his side, but he felt a strange vibration coming from the point of contact. “Not bad.” He shifted his stance, grasped the arm, and tore it off. “But not good enough.”

The two exchanged blows several times, but it was clear that this panda was no match for him. Hajime kicked the animal to the wall again and asked, “Where’s Sukuna?” It seemed intelligent enough so it might know the location of his target.

“...I don’t know,” Panda replied.

Lie. “That pause tells me you do,” Hajime smirked. “Speak up and I won’t kill you.”

The animal refused to answer. Fine. Hajime didn’t feel threatened when Panda shifted into another form. The ancient sorcerer activated his lightning and tore the thing apart. 

RIP!

“... Let me ask you again, where is Sukuna?” Hajime asked again as he poked at the bloodied remains. The creature remained unmoving. At first, he thought he might’ve killed it, but then he picked up the head and examined the corpse. “Good try, but I can still sense some cursed energy in you. Now, tell me Sukuna's location.”

“Sorry,” Panda replied with a smile, “but pandas are tight-lipped.”

“Then, I’ll make sure you’ll never open your mouth again.” Just when Hajime was about to destroy the creature, another challenger appeared. He whirled around and barely managed to block the fist. It sent him flying into the building and destroyed several walls. Hajime stopped his momentum and ran back.

BANG!

Hajime met the white-haired man's cold blue gaze as his fist was blocked with a palm. A wild grin appeared on the ancient sorcerer’s face. Finally, a worthy opponent.

“What do you think you’re doing to my student?” the man asked.

Uraume quickly dispatched weak cursed spirits that dared to bear their fangs against them. They could feel the battles that occurred within this city. While they could’ve aided them, they had a mission from Sukuna. 

“Try to find Angel,” Sukuna said.

“But, Sukuna-sama, isn’t that person an enemy?” Uraume couldn’t help but ask. Angel’s distaste and hatred against the King of Curses was no secret. While the ancient sorcerer was unlikely to side with Kenjaku, that didn’t mean they would help Sukuna. Out of all ancient sorcerers, Angel was the one who posed the biggest threat against the King of Curses. Uraume didn’t wish to have them anywhere near their master.

“I know, but their technique is useful,” Sukuna replied. “If we can make them use Jacob’s Ladder on Gojo, then the effect of the Soul Piercing Blade will disappear. Of course, Kenjaku is likely aware of this, so who knows what that guy may have done to prevent Angel from messing with his plan.”

“I see,” Uraume said.

They couldn’t find a hint of Angel’s presence despite stretching their senses. Did Kenjaku manage not to summon them? No. Uraume was quite familiar with this backup ritual that Kenjaku had prepared before meeting Mahito. It wouldn’t have been possible for Kenjaku to awaken each ancient sorcerer individually, and he likely had to revive them as a group. So, there was a high chance that Angel was also incarnated along with the others. He wouldn't be able to awaken all the sorcerers, so he might've focused on those with the highest power. Angel would be considered as one. Uraume frowned. Was he holding them somewhere?

Inside one of the tall buildings within Shinjuku, Kenjaku was standing near the window holding a binocular. He had been observing the chaos that had unfolded within the barrier. The modern and ancient sorcerers had clashed with each other the moment they met. It was a pity that he wouldn’t be able to use these cursed energies for the Culling Game. Oh well, that was fine. He could use it for something else.

Kenjaku let out a satisfied smirk. “That’s good. Keep fighting. After all, the main event hasn’t started yet.”

Omake:

Yorozu: Let’s get married Sukuna!

Sukuna: No way in hell! I would rather let Gojo hug me for ten minutes than let you touch me with one finger!
Notes:

    The manga, so far, hasn’t touched on how regular humans and the public react to the Jujutsu society and curses. Cause pretty damn sure those colonies aren’t something the higher-ups can hide, so everybody must have known there are sorcerers. The only things the manga shows are the soldiers, who are there because of Kenny, and the betting because of Mei Mei.

    Now that I think about it, forcing all these battles to occur within Shinjuku is too much. But let’s just assume they don’t encounter each other. This is only fanfic, after all. XD

    There’s not much known about Druv, but I believe his technique is to create an invisible non-spherical barrier using the large mice shikigami. Since it’s invisible, many people accidentally step into his domain and get attacked by his pteranodon shikigami. I believe we see Yuta use this flying shikigami against Uro. Since it’s not a regular domain and only a technique, I feel like Hakari can still use his domain without having to go into a domain clash.

Chapter Text

Despite being ancient sorcerers, Reggie and Iori couldn’t easily defeat Megumi and Junpei. The two had initially mistaken the two Shikigami users for being bad at hand-to-hand fights. They decided to get close to them, and they were immediately proven wrong when the two teens fought back ruthlessly with their fists and kicks. After getting regular beatdowns from two ruthless teachers, the young sorcerers had a much higher pain tolerance than before. 

So far, Iori had been the more annoying opponent. His explosive body parts, coupled with his Reverse Cursed Technique, made him difficult to deal with. The teens exchanged glances, and they dashed toward their selected opponents. Megumi immediately got close to Iori, while Junpei targeted Reggie. 

Iori tried to spit out another explosive tooth, but Megumi slipped into his shadow and appeared behind him. When one was dealing with a Reverse Cursed Technique user, one had to aim for their head. Megumi pulled out a sword he had stolen from the Zen’in clan and tried to behead the man. 

Unfortunately, Iori was also aware of this weakness and dodged it. As he turned around, the ancient sorcerer tried to kick him away, but Megumi evaded it and ordered Divine Dog to attack from behind. Although the shikigami aimed for the neck, it only managed to sink his teeth into the arm. 

“You can take that!” Iori allowed the dog to rip his arm off and leaped away.

“Shit! Throw it away!” Megumi shouted.

Divine Dog barely had time to throw the explosive limb away, but the edge of the blast managed to reach the shikigami. The teen pulled back the dog into his shadow and immediately called forth Rabbit Escape. 

Junpei, who was fighting Reggie, also released his own waves of shikigami. The two ancient sorcerers immediately tried to fight back against the numerous creatures attacking them. Megumi quickly approached his friend and asked. “Did you do it?”

“Yup,” Junpei grinned.

Megumi smirked.

Iori was able to hold off the rabbits using his explosion. He kept his vigilance high, expecting the opponent to attack him again. A shadow suddenly appeared above him, and he only had a second to dodge a shark that suddenly appeared. 

“Ugh!” Iori grunted when the shark landed and caused a large splash of water that appeared out of nowhere. The liquid destabilized his footing, giving the jellyfish time to wrap their tentacles around the man, preventing him from moving. Junpei didn’t hesitate and swung the blade he had received from Megumi.

SLASH!

“Guh-” Iori could only gasp as he realized his situation.

This time, the sword strikes true and beheaded the ancient sorcerer. The teen stabbed the head with his blade again to ensure the man was fully dead. When he was sure the sorcerer wouldn’t be moving anymore, he turned to help his friend.

Reggie, who saw his ally already being defeated by a brat, clicked his tongue. He had thought he would have some fun with these modern sorcerers, but it seemed they were not just all bark. Using the Contract Object Reproduction, he sent numerous knives flying at the young sorcerers. Then, with the opening, he pulled out another receipt that rejuvenated his body. 

The boys, who managed to block and evade his attacks, looked surprised at his refreshed state. Reggie grinned. “Surprised? My cursed technique allows me to conjure the concept of a contract. Of course, I’m not limited to only creating physical objects. You’ve seen how I used that receipt to recover my energy. My current state is as if I’ve just enjoyed a two-day stay at a hot spring.”

Megumi frowned. If they didn’t finish this quickly, this could become a war of attrition. It would be fine if they were just facing this opponent, but they would likely need to face other sorcerers and maybe even Kenjaku. They couldn’t afford to get hurt too much.

Just as the two boys prepared for an attack, Reggie pulled out another receipt and summoned a motorbike. The ancient sorcerer got up to the vehicle and expertly drove away. “See ya!”

“That piece of shit!” Junpei yelled.

Megumi summoned Nue to follow the man while Junpei got on his jellyfish. The two tried to catch up to their fleeing opponent, but the sorcerer used another contract to summon two trucks. They barely managed to dodge the oncoming vehicles. To avoid losing track of Reggie, Megumi flew higher. 

When he caught sight of his target, he stopped summoning Nue in favor of Max Elephant. The shikigami dropped right above the ancient sorcerer, but Reggie still managed to jump away at the last second. Junpei easily caught his falling friend with his jellyfish, and the two immediately sandwiched their enemy.

Seeing himself cornered, Reggie summoned a smoke bomb and threw it at the ground. Although a cloud of smoke surrounded him, a swarm of small fish quickly surrounded him and prevented his escape. He shot off several nets to make an opening, yet a shadow appeared behind him.

SWIPE!

Reggie barely managed to doge the sharp claws that were about to slash his back. He swung the sword he had just summoned and blocked an attack from Megumi. Junpei quickly got close and slammed his fist on the ancient sorcerer’s face.

Fuck. At this rate, he was going to lose!

Reggie spread out several receipts into the air as he blocked their storms of attack. The kids looked surprised at the falling radishes. Their confusion was enough to slow their reaction time when those vegetables turned into knives. 

Megumi clicked his tongue when a blade cut his arm. Reggie tried to run away using another vehicle, but the moment he touched the steering handle, his body spasmed in pain. The man fell to his knees as his whole body began to burn.

“... Poison?” Reggie gritted out as waves of pain began to spread around his limbs.

“My jellyfish may not seem that dangerous,” Junpei said as he walked toward the sorcerer. “So you haven’t been avoiding their tentacles that often. Well, I have also been testing on altering my poison. So this one is more slow acting and subtle.”

“You’ve already lost the moment you met us,” Megumi added.

Reggie could only blame himself for underestimating these two teens. Considering they had a connection with the King of Curses and the strongest sorcerer in the modern era, perhaps he had been deluding himself. Che. “What do you want?”

“Answers,” Megumi crouched before him while Junpei placed his sword above Reggie’s neck as a threat. 

“Not like I’ve any choice,” Reggie replied. He really should’ve listened to his gut and kept his head down. Something had gone wrong with Kenjaku’s plan. He was promised to be revived for the Culling Game, and yet they now had to fight modern sorcerers as fodders. 

“Do you know any vessel named Tsumiki?” Megumi asked.

“Tsumiki?” Reggie grunted when he felt another wave of pain. “Never heard of it.”

Megumi frowned in frustration. “A young woman with long black hair.”

“Oh, I think I saw one,” Reggie said through gritted teeth. “I don’t know who it is but the person controlling her seems strong. Pretty crazy about Sukuna too. I only met her once but she couldn’t stop talking about that guy.”

Megumi and Junpei scrunched their face. 

“What’s with Sukuna and drawing the attention of weirdos?” Junpei asked.

Megumi didn’t refute the implication that Junpei also included Gojo in that sentence. “So she may be heading for Itadori and Sukuna.”

“You may want to go help your friends,” Reggie said. “That woman may fancy the King of Curses, but she’s also insane. I think I heard her muttering about being the one to kill him.”

“You’re right, thanks for your info,” Junpei replied as he raised his sword in preparation for beheading the man. Before the blade could land, Reggie activated one of the receipts he had dropped when he fell to his knees. The poison was still burning his insides, but he was still a sorcerer. This amount of pain wouldn’t stop him.

BANG!

Another smoke bomb exploded and caused the teens to cover their noses. Reggie quickly got up to his vehicle. Before he got too far, a shadow flashed by him and took a chunk out of his shoulder and neck. Ah. A massive dog landed not far from him, his maw covered in blood and flesh. The ancient sorcerer lost control of his motorbike and crashed to the ground. The shock caused him to remain unmoving even as the two teens approached him again.

“Nice try,” Megumi said as he waved away the smoke that clung to him. “But didn’t I say you’ve already lost the moment you met us?”

Reggie laughed as blood dribbled out of his mouth. “How disappointing. I’m never friends with Kenjaku. I just joined because this seems interesting.” His killers gazed down at him dispassionately. To be defeated by brats that barely reached adulthood. “Do me a favor yeah? Let fate toy with you and become a clown, then die.”

The young sorcerers didn’t react as the man breathed his last breath. Unlike Yuuji, who tried to cherish all lives he encountered, the two boys didn’t hold the same belief. For them, as long as the person they were facing was considered an enemy, they would stop at nothing to eliminate that danger. 

“Wait, I don’t think we get a specific location from him,” Junpei said.

Megumi’s eye twitched when he realized and then sighed. “I guess we can only keep exploring.” 

Uro cursed her luck. At first, she thought she had found easy prey when she encountered the young female sorcerer. Yet, the moment that older teen joined the fight, things went utterly sideways. It wasn’t hard to guess that boy's cursed technique. He could swap people with anything with cursed energy. The problem was that Nobara had her Homing Needles, which continuously flew around the ancient sorcerer. There were twelve of them, and no matter how experienced Uro was, she couldn’t keep track of them because her enemies were hitting her.

To make matters worse, Todo was using a Vibraslap that allowed him to swap their positions many times. Uro tried to target the boy, but the sorcerer was a gorilla who could handle her in close combat. 

SLAM!

Uro spat out another mouthful of blood as Nobara slammed her fist against her stomach. Fuck. She couldn’t let this continue. The ancient sorcerer flew back to give her some room, and she raised her arms to make a gesture.

“Domain Expansion!”

As long as Uro could drag those two into her domain, there was no way they could retaliate. Her barrier expanded and enveloped her enemies. The scenery shifted from cities to an open sky. While there was no floor, they could still stand in the air. 

Todo and Nobara quickly opened their Simple Domain when they realized their enemy was pulling their ultimate move. Although Uro’s sure-hit attack failed to land, she could see the girl had a harder time maintaining her barrier. Seeing her chance, she targeted Nobara and began to attack her. The girl tried to fight back and block her attack, but it seemed she had to maintain her position to keep her Simple Domain open.

Uro grinned as she landed a solid blow on the teen’s stomach. Instead of falling as predicted, Nobara kept herself upright by grasping the woman’s hair. 

RIP!

The girl pulled harshly on her luscious lock and ripped a few strands off her scalps. Uro wasn’t bothered by the pain, but she was even more pissed now. She raised her foot and kicked the teen off her feet. It effectively broke her Simple Domain and allowed Uro’s sure-hit attack to land on her.

Thin Ice Breaker!

The cursed technique landed squarely on the girl and blasted her away. Knowing she couldn’t keep her Domain open for too long, she decided to drop it early so her technique would recover faster. This time, she fully turned her attention to the boy with the annoying ability. With his partner being down, his trick wouldn’t be that useful.

“You’re next!” Uro exclaimed.

Todo didn’t look dispirited after seeing Nobara getting taken down. The teen readily blocked and evaded Uro’s fast hits. It was clear the boy was better at hand-to-hand than the girl. Despite being large, he maintained his speed and could keep up with Uro’s attacks. 

Uro was slightly annoyed, but she knew she only had to draw this out until her technique recovered. However, just as she was about to be sure of her victory, she felt a stab of pain through her chest as black spikes came out of her torso.

Straw Doll Technique: Resonance!

Uro’s eyes widened. This wasn’t the boy’s technique. At the edge of her vision, she could see Nobara crouching over a straw doll as she prepared to hammer down another nail. Fuck. Uro had assumed her power was merely to control those pesky needles, but that had been only one of her arsenal.

BAM!

Todo slammed his fist into Uro’s face during her moment of distraction. The impact sent her flying several feet back. Although she managed to land upright, Nobara hammered another nail into the straw doll and hit the ancient sorcerer with another resonance.

“Ugh!” Uro grunted.

Shit. Shit. Shit!

Uro switched her target back to Nobara. Great, the kid couldn’t move because of the sure-hit attack. The ancient sorcerer propelled herself toward the immobilized teen, but Todo immediately got in her path and locked her into another close combat. 

The woman didn’t know what kind of attack that thing was, but it was shredding her inside and messing with her cursed energy. If this kept going, she was going to lose! 

Unfortunately, despite her desperate attempts to get past Todo, the teen locked her in hand-to-hand combat. At that point, Nobara finally nailed another Resonance, and another set of black spikes exploded from Uro’s chest. The woman spat out a mouthful of blood as her consciousness disappeared. Todo and Nobara relaxed when they realized their enemy was finally defeated. 

“That was a great fight, sister!” Todo said as he gave a thumbs-up.

Nobara shakily raised her thumb and gave him a bloody grin before she passed out. Ugh. She needed a nap.

Dhruv was losing. He couldn’t believe it. He conquered Japan during the Civil War of Wa. He was supposed to be one of the best sorcerers in history. Perhaps the only one who could challenge him was Sukuna, the King of Curses. When he failed to achieve his goal during his first incarnation, fate was kind enough to let him meet Kenjaku, who offered him another chance to incarnate. He knew that man was a snake with his own agenda, but as long as Dhruv could fulfill his ambition of taking over Japan again. He didn’t care.

Yet, it was a mere few days after his second reincarnation that he encountered a great threat. Dhruv hadn’t taken the brat that approached him seriously. What could a mere boy do against someone with his experience and power? Yet, that cursed technique of his was an infuriating and ridiculous power. When that flood of information was shoved into his brain, he knew Hakari was a troublesome opponent. 

Dhruv wasted no time and started attacking his opponent. He never held much fondness over luck, and he would not let the brat obtain the Jackpot. If that occurred, then things would not be in his favor. Despite his might, the ancient sorcerer could not muster an actual Domain Expansion, but his technique allowed him to create a pseudo-domain using his shikigami. This power allowed him to defeat countless foes, and this teen would be another one.

Dhruv ordered his pteranodons to attack his enemy, yet Hakari easily dodged and kicked away the shikigami. The two locked into close combat, yet the boy could keep up with his attacks despite the ancient sorcerer having the aid of his summons. To make matters worse, his attention was divided by the senseless scenario occurring within this Domain. 

The boy had failed to reach a Jackpot thrice now, but luck sided with the teen during his fourth try. The scenery inside the Domain changed to that of a train station. Dhruv frowned. This wasn’t good. The Final Train Riichi had an 80 percent chance of success. Dhruv decided to wholly ignore the unfolding story and focus on taking down his opponent.

“Maximum!” Dhruv said as he fully channeled his cursed energy.

A massive swarm of pteranodons spawned around them. Each of his shikigami could cause cuts by simply flying past an enemy. With the total number of pteranodons he had created, there was no way Hakari could escape.

The teen also understood the danger and began to reinforce his body. Hakari’s limbs became a blur as he dodged and destroyed numerous shikigami, yet there was no end to the flood of pteranodons. Dhruv kept channeling his technique and summoned even more shikigami.

“The train at platform two…” the announcer said, “... will now depart.”

Feeling his opponent’s struggle subsided, Dhruv lowered his output. He knew he had to save his power in case he encountered Sukuna. As expected, Hakari’s body was sliced everywhere. There wasn’t an inch of skin that wasn’t covered in wounds and blood. The boy was now kneeling on the ground, unmoving.

“You’re one hundred years too early to attempt to challenge me,” Dhruv said.

He was about to turn around when he noticed the projection of the two characters. His eyes widened. The woman had not entered the train. At that point, a massive surge of cursed energy coursed through Hakari’s body. Dhruv attempted to protect himself, but with his opponent's enhanced speed, the teen closed the distance in an instant.

BANG!

In the next second, there was a fist coming out of Druv's chest. The ancient sorcerer could only look down blankly.

Impossible.

“You just can’t stop yapping, can’t you, old man?” Hakari said.

“Granite Blast!” Ryu didn’t waste his chance and immediately used his technique point-blank. Normally, he wouldn’t be this eager, but he knew he couldn’t underestimate his opponent. 

BAM!

His beam destroyed the building behind them, but Maki was able to dodge away the last second. The girl swung her long sword and tried to take off his head. Ryu knew that weapon was dangerous. It was only his instinct, but the aura of that blade was lethal. Yet the threat of life-threatening danger only made the taste sweeter.

Ryu didn’t try to distance himself; instead, he got closer. He sent a fist flying at Maki, but the teen blocked his attack with her sword. That long blade was deadly, but it was quite cumbersome in such close combat. However, Maki was also a martial arts master, and she managed to maneuver her weapon expertly to block and attack. 

Amazing!

The teen clearly had no cursed energy yet she was able to tank his enhanced strikes. It was as if he was hitting reinforced concrete. But that wasn’t enough! Instead of using his usual method, Ryu discharged his cursed energy with his palm and sent the girl flying into the air. Maki landed on the next building, but Ryu was already in the air beside her, pointing his cannon-shaped pompadour. 

Granite Blast!

Instead of evading, the girl raised her palm and directly blocked the attack. Ryu’s eyes widened in surprise and glee as he landed on the other building. Before he could gather himself, Maki had already got close and threw a punch.

CRACK!

The ground underneath Ryu’s body cracked under the impact, but the ancient sorcerer managed to stop the teen’s attack. Fuck. He had to fully reinforce his hand with cursed energy, while this girl only used her pure physical strength. 

Ryu kicked his opponent in the stomach and sent her flying into the air again. Without wasting a moment, he sent his Granite Blast at Maki. The attack should’ve landed, but somehow, the girl used the air itself as a footing and dodged!

With high speed, Maki flew back toward Ryu and tried to stab him with her sword. The man barely had a second to dodge, and the resulting impact of her landing caused rubble to fly in all directions. Fine. Time to pull out the big gun.

“Domain Expansion!”

His barrier expanded and immediately enveloped the two fighters. He waited for a second to see what his opponent would do. The girl had no cursed energy, so it was impossible for her to use Hollow Wicker Basket. Then, his sure-hit attack would surely land on the teen. Yet, instead of faltering, Maki dashed straight toward Ryu. 

Impossible.

Ryu was so surprised that he could only make a last attempt to block the oncoming slash. It cut his hand, but he managed to stop the blade from hitting him. Yet, Maki didn’t stop her momentum and whirled around to land another blow. 

SLASH!

This time, the strike landed, and Ryu found himself falling. As his eyes looked down, he noticed his beheaded body. Ah. He had heard of the rumors of people with such gifts. Hated and beloved by heaven with equal measure. Though they couldn’t use cursed energy, they were blessed with other amazing physical prowess and other gifts. A smile appeared on Ryu’s face.

Thank you.

‘I’m full now.’

Hajime was elated. The opponent before him was someone who could truly challenge him in battle. They had only exchanged enhanced physical attacks, but Hajime knew that Gojo was strong, unlike Panda, who could barely keep up with him. Gojo could easily match his speed and strikes.

The ancient sorcerer tried to slam his fist into the man’s face, but Gojo grabbed his hand and retaliated.

BANG!

Hajime was sent flying back, but before he could land, Gojo already appeared to land a kick on his abdomen. The ancient sorcerer grinned and quickly wrapped his limbs around the leg and tried to elbow the man. The white-haired sorcerer evaded at the last second and raised his knee so he could bring Hajime’s body up. Then, he swung his fist down toward his opponent’s stomach. Hajime instinctively dodged and took a step back. 

CRACK!

Gojo’s fist created a crater on the ground. Hajime grinned as he raised his two arms. With a push of his hands, he sent electricity toward the man. However, instead of the expected blood and gore, his technique couldn’t land on the man.

Hajime’s eyes widened. No way.

Gojo used his opponent’s moment of surprise and kicked his face. The ancient sorcerer got thrown back for the second time, but he was still able to pick himself up.

“That’s one interesting technique,” Gojo said.

Hajime laughed. “I can say the same to you.” Now, he finally remembered. He wasn’t close to the Gojo clan, but he had heard of their cursed technique and innate gift. In his first life, he tried to visit that family, but there was no child that the mythical Six Eyes had bestowed. It seemed in the modern era, someone was finally able to bear that innate gift and limitless. It seemed making a deal with Kenjaku hadn’t been a mistake. His goal was still Sukuna, but if he could encounter more strong enemies like Gojo, then he wouldn’t get bored any time soon.

“But…” Hajime frowned when he finally realized what was off during their fight. “Why are you holding back?”

“Huh?” Gojo tilted his head. 

“You could’ve used your cursed technique this whole time, why do you turn it off?” Hajime asked. “Are you looking down on me?”

Gojo scratched his chin. “I mean, you don’t seem that strong.” Hajime felt a vein in his forehead throbbing. But before he could get angry, the man continued, “But well it’s mostly because I can’t use my full power right now.”

“Eh?” Hajime stopped.

“I thought Kenjaku already told you?” Gojo asked. “You work with him, right? He’s the guy who sealed my power away. My cursed energy and output are very low right now and frankly I want to save it for a bigger fight.”

Hajime wasn’t sure who he should feel angry more toward. The guy who was underestimating him, or Kenjaku who dared to ruin his fun? Honestly, he really wanted to pummel that annoying grin off the white-haired man’s face, but he had no interest in beating a weakened opponent.

“Che! That fucking Kenjaku!” Hajime shouted. “First, he changed his deal, and then he stopped me from fighting Sukuna! And now you!”

“Eh?” Gojo blinked. “You want to fight Sukuna?”

“Who doesn’t?” Hajime replied. “Any respectable sorcerer will want to test their mettle against the strongest.” Nobody could match his power in his first life. The Culling Game should be his second chance to meet a strong opponent, and while Gojo had drawn his interest, he still wanted to meet the King of Curses.

Gojo’s lips twitched at that statement, and then he said, “So you really want to face Sukuna with his full power?”

“What’s with that face?” Hajime felt like he was being laughed at. Maybe he should kill this guy even if he was weakened.

“Ah, it’s nothing.” Gojo waved his hand. “But I’ve to inform you that he’s also in the same state as me. Kenjaku put a seal on his vessel so he can only muster one fourth of his power at most.”

Hajime’s eye twitched. “Damn you, Kenjaku!!!!”

Yorozu couldn’t believe it. She could finally confront Sukuna! When she first heard the man had decided to turn himself into cursed objects, she had been heartbroken. Her dream of teaching him love would remain unfulfilled! Luckily, Kenjaku had offered her a deal. He would revive her in the future and let him confront the King of Curses. Just like he had promised, she had finally met her love after so long!

Still, something was bugging her. Yorozu asked, “You… why aren’t you in your true form?”

Sukuna’s current appearance was quite different from his original one. Although he still retained his unique peach blossom hair, he was a lot smaller and more lithe. He only had two eyes and didn’t have his striking black tattoos that usually marked his skin.

“You can blame Kenjaku for that,” Sukuna replied and kicked her.

Yorozu blocked his attack and retaliated. The King of Curses easily dodged and deflected her kicks, and a second later, the other sorcerer got in her way. The woman raised her arm to deflect the boy’s punch.

“Who the hell are you?” Yorozu asked. “Don’t get between me and Sukuna!”

“No way!” the kid replied heatedly. “Stay away from him!”

Yorozu sent her liquid metal to attack, but before it could land, Sukuna pulled the boy away by grabbing his hoodie. “Calm down, brat.”

Yorozu frowned at the close interaction. During all her time knowing Sukuna, she had never seen the curse act so caring toward anyone. Even Uraume only received cold acknowledgment from their master.

The woman narrowed her eyes. “Is he your vessel?”

“What of it?” Sukuna asked, not denying.

Yorozu wasn’t quite sure how he separated himself from his vessel, but it seemed he was still connected to the boy. Or else, she couldn’t explain why he cared so much about a human’s well-being. “Are you sure you want to bring a brat like him into our fight? He’ll get killed.”

“Even with a fraction of my power, I can handle you, Yorozu,” Sukuna replied.

Yeah, that was another thing that was off with the King of Curses. Although she had never gotten into an all-out fight with the curse, she was well aware of his power. Right now, Sukuna was like a lake that had been dried to the bottom. 

“So confident,” Yorozu said. Well, that was fine. She would rather prove herself when he was at full power, but she didn’t mind claiming him now and then dealing with Kenjaku. It wasn’t as if they couldn’t fight again afterward.

Yorozu sent her metal fluid to Sukuna. The curse and the boy dodged. While the King of Curses kept his distance, Yuuji got close to attacking Yorozu in close combat. The woman clicked her tongue in annoyance. She didn’t want this brat to get in her fight, but she couldn’t kill him yet. Despite her best attempts to take down the boy quickly, Yuuji was able to keep up with her hits. It seemed Sukuna’s vessel inherited his sturdiness and power.

Yorozu dodged a fist from Yuuji and kneed the boy in the stomach. The attack pushed the teen away, but Sukuna used that chance to send a Dismantle at her. She quickly raised her liquid metal to block the technique.

Sukuna clicked his tongue and finally decided to get close. Yorozu grinned at the man’s closeness, but the curse quickly engaged with her in hand-to-hand combat. Just when her heart became elated, the boy showed up again and tried to get between them.

“You brat!” Yorozu screamed.

Sukuna used her distraction to punch her back. Before Yorozu could retaliate, Yuuji mimicked the man’s move and landed another hit on her abdomen. The woman unleashed her technique and forced the two to step back with her liquid metal. 

“Sukuna,” Yorozu said with a furrow, “why didn’t you use your cursed technique?” Back then, Sukuna could’ve used his Cleave, but he opted to hit her with his fist.

Sukuna shrugged. “Well, the brat is supposed to be your opponent. I’m just here to help him sometimes.”

Yorozu froze for a second before her face twisted in anger. “DON’T MESS WITH ME!!” Yuuji looked flabbergasted at her explosive reaction, while Sukuna had a flat stare. “How can you let a brat like that get between husband and wife?! You should be the one fighting me alone! I don’t have any interest in minors!”

She was mad now. Her cursed technique fully activated as armor began to grow around her. “Do you truly believe you can beat me without fighting seriously?” Within seconds, Yorozu’s whole body was covered in her Insect Armor. It was her masterpiece. Nobody could break through it—nothing except perhaps Sukuna’s deadly cursed technique. 

“Get ready, brat,” Sukuna said.

Yorozu flew toward them at high speed, and Yuuji barely had a chance to raise his arms to block. Yet that move did nothing to stop him from flying back from the sheer power of her punch. She flew behind Sukuna and tried to kick him, but the man blocked her attack. Undeterred, she sent numerous spikes of liquid metal through the floor and surrounded Sukuna. 

Yorozu frowned when the curse decided to tank the attack. Then, her eyes widened when she felt her control over her liquid metal disappear. A moment later, the black spikes fell to the ground like water, revealing unharmed the King of Curses.

‘Is that? Reverse Cursed Technique?’ Yorozu wondered. She had seen the man use that power on himself, but to output the Reverse Cursed Technique was a new thing. Yuuji, who noticed her lowered guard, used that chance to get behind her and landed a solid punch.

BLACK FLASH!

Yorozu froze at the feeling of her armor cracking. No way. She whirled around and tried to kick the boy’s head. The teen dropped down and sent another punch. 

BLACK FLASH!!

Another crack appeared on her Insect Armor. “You piece of shit!” Yorozu screamed. The woman was about to use her liquid metal again, but Sukuna got behind her and hit her on the back of her head. Although the attack didn’t break her armor, the impact left her reeling for a moment. At that point, Yuuji took the opening and landed another punch.

BLACK FLASH!!!

The force of that fist sent her flying away. As she landed on the ground hard, Yorozu felt her Insect Armor falling apart. Shit. Sukuna landed in front of her while Yuuji stood on her back.

“Really? Is that how much your so-called love amounts to?” Sukuna asked, tilting his head. “You can’t even handle the brat, what makes you think you can fight me?”

Yorozu forced herself to get up. “Not even close! I’ve only just started! Didn’t I promise you, Sukuna, that I’ll be the one to teach you about love! Only I can understand the loneliness that comes with peerless strength!”

Sukuna rolled his eyes. “No need, I already understand the concept you keep yammering about.”

Yorozu’s eyes shot wide open. Impossible. There was no way. Sukuna? The King of Curses understood love already? “I don’t believe you! You must be mistaken! I’ll show you what real love looks like!”

Yorozu could still remember the first time she laid eyes on him. That massive figure stood above the rest. Though his red eyes were sharp and wicked, those orbs contained endless boredom and distance. It gazed down upon every living being. Unable to comprehend their fragility and weakness. The strongest. It was that loneliness that pushed her to embrace that man. It was the retaliation cut that made her understand his isolation. It should be hers! That solitude! That heartwrenching pain! The one who would kill Sukuna would be her!

With a clasp of her hand, Yorozu summoned the Perfect Sphere. It was one of her ultimate moves. An impossible shape made from liquid metal that could generate infinite pressure. Even Sukuna, with his powerful Reverse Cursed Technique, couldn’t possibly survive this. To ensure her prey couldn’t escape, she immediately unleashed her Domain.

“Domain Expansion: Threefold Affliction!”

Yorozu intentionally kept Yuuji out. She didn’t want the brat to get between her and Sukuna. Since this wasn’t the King of Curse's true vessel, she could destroy the body, and the curse would just get sent back to the boy. Then, she would deal with the sorcerer before she could pursue Kenjaku. 

As expected, Sukuna raised his hands and made a mudra. 

“Domain Expansion: Malevolent Shrine.”

Yorozu grinned. There was no way he could win. Sukuna might have a more refined Domain than hers, but his output was limited. She had felt how weak his attacks were from his Dismantle and enhanced strikes. Even if she had to clash, she would be the one winning!

Yorozu's grin widened. ‘You’re mine.’

Yet, Sukuna merely gave her a smirk.

A mili-second later, the Malevolent Shrine expanded and unleashed the full force of Dismantle and Cleave into the small radius of her Domain. 0.2 seconds. That was all it took for the King of Curses to destroy her Domain. Yorozu could only stare blankly as her barrier fell apart to pieces and slashes appeared on her skin.

How?

“You said Yorozu can use Domain Expansion,” Yuuji asked. “Won’t that be dangerous? You can’t output that much power, right?”

“If I have a regular Domain then yes,” Sukuna replied, “but haven’t I told you that mine has an open barrier? So long as Yorozu doesn’t change her barrier’s condition then she won’t be able to handle Malevolent Shrine attacks no matter how weak they are. And that woman has never seen me use it so she’ll definitely assume mine is a regular Domain.”

Before Yorozu could fall to her knees, Yuuji had already leaped into the broken Domain. He landed his open palm on her back.

“Soul Dismantle.”

Yorozu felt something ripping her apart from her vessel. It was as if her soul was forcefully ejected by an invisible force. No way. How could it? She tried to keep her hold on her body. Yet, her meaningless struggle stopped when she saw Sukuna standing before her. He placed his palm on her face.

“Begone.”

With another attack on the barrier between Yorozu’s and Tsumiki’s souls, the incarnated sorcerer was finally expelled. The remnants of her being spewed out from behind the teen’s body. Yuuji quickly caught Tsumiki’s unconscious form while Sukuna approached the blob of cursed energy.

“Su…kuna…” Yorozu gasped out at the towering figure.

Sukuna gently picked her up. “That’s enough, Yorozu. I commend your attempt, but you have started with a false assumption. I’ve always understood what love is.”

Yorozu’s remaining eye shed a tear. Her form began to dissipate into ashes and smoke as the last of her will disappeared. Just when Sukuna was about to turn to heal Tsumiki, he felt a dangerous presence appearing near Yuuji.

“Yuuji!” Sukuna tried to warn the kid, but it was too late. 

Kenjaku had already stood behind the boy and placed his hand on the teen’s back. A grin appeared on that borrowed face. “Caught you.”

Omake:

Sorcerers: We’re winning this!

Kenjaku: How about, no?

Sukuna: Fuck!
Notes:

    Sorry if the battles are not that detailed. There are just too many of them, and I cannot muster the energy to describe every strike, unlike Gojo vs Sukuna. Also, most of the sorcerers are ruthless lol. I think Yuuji is the softest and kindest. Yuta takes the second spot, but the other sorcerers won’t hesitate to kill an enemy. Sorry about the short Gojo vs Kashimo fight. I need him alive… for now. :)

    Also, what do you think Kenjaku’s plan is?? ;)

Chapter 29

Chapter Text

An unknown hand touched his back, and Yuuji felt a sharp, tearing pain. It was as if someone was ripping his soul into two. It was like a hand was reaching into his chest and pulling out his heart from his ribcage. But that couldn’t be true because the boy didn’t feel the familiar pain that accompany his flesh being torn apart. No, this pain was unique. It was an agony that struck him deep within.

“Aaaagh!” Yuuji screamed.

He knew he should fight back, but he could not. His limbs were locked still by the pain. On the edge of his blurring vision, he could see Sukuna running toward him. Yet before he could even take two steps, the man disappeared into a puff of smoke. 

RIP!

“Just a bit more,” Kenjaku said as he slowly lifted his hand. Something came out of Yuuji’s body. It was potent cursed energy made out of the darkest and most malevolent power.

SNAP!

When the last thread connected to Yuuji’s body disappeared, the cursed energy condensed into a ball within Kenjaku’s hand. It swirled darkly. Looking at it, the orb was quite similar to the ball of cursed energy that Geto usually created and swallowed with his cursed technique. Unfortunately, even in this form, Sukuna couldn’t be considered a cursed spirit.

“Though, won’t that be interesting,” Kenjaku hummed, “imagine me controlling the dreaded King of Curses. Heh.”

Yuuji, who could not handle the agony of being forcefully torn apart from Sukuna, dropped to his knees and collapsed beside unconscious Tsumiki. Kenjaku examined his son.

“Thanks for your hard work, but I’m afraid I’ve to take Sukuna back.”

With those words, the curse user disappeared from the location to start his plan. A minute later, two teens arrived on the ruined battleground to find their fallen allies. Junpei and Megumi quickly ran to check up on Yuuji and Tsumiki. The girl was covered in wounds and bruises, but none of them were life-threatening, and that allowed Megumi to exhale a breath. Yuuji, on the other hand, didn’t look hurt that much, yet the boy had this pained expression as if he was deeply wounded.

“Yuuji!” Junpei shouted as he tried to wake up his friend.

Once Megumi was sure his sister was safe, he turned his attention to his classmate. “Itadori! Wake up!” He slapped the boy on the cheek.

Although it was harsh, the hit managed to force the boy awake. Bright golden eyes snapped open in panic as he struggled to get up. “Sukuna! Sukuna!”

“What? Calm down, Yuuji!” Junpei tried to stop the boy from bolting away.

Megumi also began to look around. Sukuna should have been beside Yuuji, yet they couldn’t see or feel anyone in the area. “Where is Sukuna? Did you two get separated?”

Yuuji could only stare blankly at the questions from his friends. Tears were building up in his eyes as the boy grasped his chest desperately. “I can’t feel him! He’s gone!”

“What?” The other two teens frowned. 

“Kenjaku! He was here!” Yuuji exclaimed. “He took Sukuna away!”

Kenjaku quickly made his way to the ritual ground he had prepared many days before. Based on various small cursed spirits he had spread and the tracking he placed on the incarnated sorcerers, it seemed the modern sorcerers managed to defeat his pawns. Oh well. That was within expectation. He had never held high hopes for the majority of the ancient sorcerers. Except for Sukuna, the only one who could be any threat was Kashimo, who was hard to control.

Kenjaku knew pitting the ancient and modern sorcerers would only take him a meager amount of time. Time that wasn’t enough for him to steal Tengen. The only person who could force the sorcerers into a standstill was the King of Curses. That had been the reason why he had agreed to help Sukuna become cursed objects even without a Binding Vow. He needed the curse’s cooperation. The sheer chaos and destruction that man could unleash was not something that anyone could handle except for Gojo Satoru, perhaps.

“What a pity,” Kenjaku said as he looked down at the orb in his hand. “You know that I was the one who helped you turn into cursed objects right? I may not have that nifty soul attacks you and my son have. However, I have lived long enough that I’m somewhat capable of tinkering with it. Of course, my skill is nowhere near as effective, but since I made Yuuji, it’s not that difficult for me to forcefully pull you out. Having you nicely wrapped up within my seals, just make the extraction process easier. Of course, forcing you into this form won’t work for very long, but don’t worry, I don’t plan on killing you.”

Kenjaku wasn’t sure whether Sukuna was conscious while being forced into this form. Well, that didn’t matter. He had always had the habit of talking out loud. “You should feel grateful. I know how much you loved fighting and I doubt you ever have a chance of fully unleashing your power in the modern era. So, I’ll let you have some fun.”

Kenjaku finally arrived on the ritual ground and immediately activated the second smaller barrier that prevented anyone from entering or leaving. He approached the center of the field. The ground was marked with sigils drawn in blood, and in the middle of it was a massive withered body. “Yuuji wasn’t my first attempt at reviving you, you know. I knew that the chance of me finding the soul of your twin was very low so I tested several other methods first. One of them involved using your original body. I quickly abandoned it since it required a ton of cursed energy that had to be gathered within a short amount of time. That would require pitting many powerful sorcerers in a fight and numerous regular humans to face death or life situations. Of course, I couldn’t do such a thing. That would bring too much attention. However, after you decided to betray me, I knew that I couldn’t remain in hiding, so why not use this old method?”

Kenjaku smiled as he raised his hand to create a sign. The sigils on the ground began to glow eerie red. “My next big problem was how to get close to Yuuji without being noticed. Separating you from the group wasn’t that hard when you entered the barrier but I had to make sure you weren’t near any backup when I approached. That Uraume also had to stay away, so I thought why not let them chase after Angel? You had to have told them to bring Angel to you to remove the Soul Piercing Blade’s effect on Gojo.”

The curse user released his hold on the orb, and it began to float in the air. “I admit that removing Angel would be safer for my plan, but curiosity had always been my biggest weakness. I also wanted to know who would win in a battle between the two strongest sorcerers. Of course, I understand. The limitless and Infinity are tricky, so I’ve brought you a useful tool! Did you know how hard it was to get my hands on it? Well, I was a bit disappointed when I heard the user of the Ten Shadows had been born, but oh well, Mahoraga was better than this cursed tool so I could understand if you decided to steal that body.”

Kenjaku clicked his tongue. “Ugh, now that I think about it, I’ve been working very hard to bring you back, but you’ve been utterly ungrateful! How many years have I spent turning my brain around to make sure you could incarnate? Oh yeah, several hundred years. Sukuna, I thought we could’ve been great allies but you decided to stab me in the back. Still, I feel grateful that despite all of your unpredictableness, I can still guess your movement somewhat.”

The orb slowly approached the body as the cursed energy within the Shinjuku barrier slowly gathered and merged into the ritual circle. “I’ve put some safe measures so you won’t be able to do any tricks this time. You can stay back, relax, and fight to your heart's content.” Kenjaku grinned. “I know Gojo is lauded as the strongest but I understand how powerful you are, Sukuna, I believe in you.”

All the sorcerers tensed when they felt the cursed energy within the veil started to stir. Satoru quickly rose into the air as he examined the smaller barrier that showed up inside the city. Panda, who he had picked up after his fight with Kashimo, clutched his uniform tightly with his much smaller hands. The sorcerer hovered above the veil and tried to break it. As expected, his attack bounced off harmlessly. Satoru frowned. This had to be the work of Kenjaku. What was that man planning now?

“Sensei! Gojo-sensei!” several voices shouted from below.

Satoru turned toward the source to see Yuuji, Megumi, and Junpei standing above a tall building’s roof. Tsumiki was lying on Megumi’s back, unconscious. A smile stretched on the man’s face as he approached his students. Panda immediately jumped off his hold to stand beside the other teens. Junpei shot a confused look at his much smaller senior, but Panda shook his head.

Although Satoru could defeat Kashimo, he had a more pressing matter, so he let the ancient sorcerer roam free for now. His initial goal was to locate Tsumiki, but then the barrier showed up and distracted him.

“You guys did it! Good job!” Satoru said as he examined the sleeping girl. The teen looked a bit rough, but nothing that wouldn’t heal.

“Sensei, that’s not important!” Megumi replied.

“Sukuna! Kenjaku took Sukuna!” Yuuji added.

What? Satoru quickly pulled off his blindfold to fully examine Yuuji with his Six Eyes. What had been once two souls intertwined with each other was now gone. Only Yuuji’s soul remained within his own body. That… shouldn’t be possible.

“Kenjaku showed up after we beat Yorozu,” Yuuji explained. “I don’t know what he did but I felt him ripping Sukuna out of me!”

Shit. Satoru turned toward the small barrier. What the hell was Kenjaku planning to do with Sukuna? The man immediately flew toward the barrier again and tried to destroy it with his cursed technique.

Red!

BANG!

Despite using his power, the black dome refused to budge. Satoru growled. It had to be the constant flow of cursed energy. As long as this power continued to enter, there would be no way for him to break it. He could perhaps try to use the full power of Purple, but he couldn’t be sure about Sukuna’s safety at that point. Was this Kenjaku’s plan all along? Had he always aimed to retrieve the King of Curses?

“You better not die on me,” Satoru muttered as he bit his thumbnail.

It took more than Uraume preferred for them to finally locate the missing Angel. The battles between the ancient and modern sorcerers made it even more difficult for them to discover the tracks of that flighty figure. Their investigation led them to a small building located near the national garden. Several cursed spirits were guarding the area, but the curse user easily destroyed them with their frost.

Uraume touched the door and was surprised it wasn’t even locked. With a simple push, the door opened to reveal an empty room. However, they weren’t fooled. They released a blast of cursed energy that destroyed the seal Kenjaku had placed. The four papers on the edge of the room burned to ash to reveal an entrance to a hidden underground chamber. 

Without hesitation, the curse user climbed down the stairs to finally meet the ancient curse user. A young female teen sat listlessly on the ground. There were that familiar angel halo and wings, but what drew their attention was the two missing limbs. The girl’s left arm and right leg had been cut off.

Uraume paused for a second and said, “Angel.”

The girl raised her head, but instead of speaking directly, a mouth formed on her cheek. “Sukuna’s servant.”

Uraume was slightly surprised the ancient sorcerer didn’t take over the body completely. The girls didn’t seem particularly special like Itadori Yuuji so it was unlikely she could suppress Angel. However, the ancient sorcerer had always held idealistic and pompous ideals that it wasn’t strange she would refuse to steal another person’s body. Perhaps, that was how Kenjaku could easily suppress them since they wouldn’t be able to fully utilize their power with partial possession.

“Do you wish to kill me?” Angel asked.

“No,” Uraume replied. “Sukuna-sama has ordered me to retrieve you. He has use for your cursed technique.”

Instead of Angel, it was the vessel who responded, “I refuse! I would never help someone as evil as the King of Curses.”

Uraume felt slight dissatisfaction. A weakling like her had no right to even speak of Sukuna. But, the curse user kept their cool and continued, “Sukuna-sama has decided to cooperate with the modern sorcerers. I understand your vigilance, but I doubt continuing to stay here is wise. Who knows when Kenjaku will return to finish you?”

The girl pursed her lips.

“The Fallen One? Working with sorcerers?” Angel asked. “If you wish to fool me, you should’ve used a better lie.”

“It is not a lie,” Uraume said. “Regardless of your opinion, you are in no shape to fight back. I’ll take you with me and then you shall see the truth of my claim.”

The vessel growled when the curse user took a step closer. “Don’t touch me!” She attempted to summon the trumpet, but it could barely manifest.

Uraume raised an eyebrow. “You have no chance of winning a fight against me. Either you cooperate or I shall freeze your limbs.” It was an empty threat. The girl was too wounded, and further damage might cause her to die. Sukuna wanted to use her, so Uraume had to ensure she stayed alive. Luckily, in the girl and Angel’s eyes, the curse user was merely a loyal servant of the cruel King of Curses, so their threat was taken seriously.

“Do as they say, Hana,” Angel resignedly said.

Hana still looked reluctant to be touched by Uraume, but it was clear that the two couldn’t resist. It took a bit of time, but the curse user managed to pick up the girl. Since she had lost two of her limbs, carrying her on their back was not possible. So, the monk decided to carry her on the front. The girl seemed to have some complaints about the bridal carry, but she kept it to herself and grasped their robe tightly.

The moment they exited the building, the two ancient sorcerers quickly noticed the swirls of cursed energy that moved within the barrier. Uraume frowned and leaped on top of a building to get a better look. It seemed most of the fights had ended, but they noticed the smaller barrier that had emerged at the center of Shinjuku. What was Kenjaku planning now?

Although far away, Uraume saw the floating white-haired sorcerer who was also observing the situation. The curse user approached the man. On the way, they also noticed a group of students who were watching on a nearby rooftop. They decided to approach Yuuji first when they couldn’t find Sukuna anywhere.

“Uraume!” Yuuji exclaimed when they saw the monk. His eyes were red, implying the boy had been crying not too long ago. 

Before Uraume could ask Sukuna’s location, Hana shouted, “Megumi!”

The black-haired boy frowned in confusion. “Who are you?”

The girl looked down when the teen didn’t know her, but she quickly responded. “We met a long time ago. I mean, we didn’t talk back then, but you saved me!”

Megumi still looked confused since he couldn’t remember ever meeting Hana. The other teens shot bewildered looks at their friend as they leaned toward each other.

“Is she… another yandere?” Yuuji murmured.

“Another?” Junpei asked.

“Why do you keep meeting weird people, Itadori?” Panda added.

“It’s not my fault,” Yuuji defended himself. “And this one is looking for Fushiguro!”

Megumi whacked Yuuji’s head. 

Uraume sighed. They couldn’t understand the strange culture that the teens liked to reference. “This is Hana the vessel of an ancient sorcerer named Angel. Sukuna-sama ordered me to find them since they can use a cursed technique that can remove the effect of the Soul Piercing Blade.”

The boys perked up at the news, but they immediately looked down again. 

“About Sukuna…” Yuuji said.

“Kenjaku took him,” Megumi continued.

Uraume stilled. “How?”

“Isn’t that the number one question?” Gojo said as he returned to the group. The man frowned at the girl within Uraume’s hold. “Who’s this?”

“Someone who can help you remove that binding,” Uraume replied.

Angel manifested their mouth on Hana’s cheek. “You’re a Gojo.”

Gojo gave a peace sign and a grin. It didn’t reach his eyes. “The one and only Gojo Satoru. The strongest sorcerer. Nice to meet you.”

Hana’s eyes widened. “You’re really working with the King of Curses? I thought that guy was evil.”

“Eh.” Gojo shrugged. “He certainly gives off that vibe, but don’t worry the man is a big softie inside.”

“Are we even speaking of the same person?” Angel asked.

True. Uraume had not believed that Sukuna could foster fondness over anything except battles and Jujutsu sorcery. During their long years following his master, the King of Curses had never shown any sign of care toward anything. It was only after his incarnation that he changed his nature slightly. The curse user glanced at Yuuji, who looked even somber as they talked about Sukuna. It seemed the attachment wasn’t one-way only.

“I can’t convince you with words, you have to see it yourself,” Gojo replied. “Anyway, Uraume, do you have any idea what Kenjaku is planning with Sukuna? Yuuji said he extracted him from his body.”

Uraume frowned as they gently lowered Hana to the ground. The girl didn’t resist and tried to make herself comfortable. “I’m not sure. Kenjaku mainly spoke of his plan about the Culling Game, but…” They attempted to dig through their memories. The curse user loved to keep blathering about his theories and plans, saying that there was a lot of nonsense that Uraume had to go through. Could it be? “Perhaps he is trying to incarnate Sukuna-sama using another vessel…”

The sorcerers looked confused. 

“But why would he do that?” Junpei asked. “Sukuna won’t side with him.”

“If he has control, yes,” Uraume said gravely. “But Kenjaku is very sly and a master at seals. I do not doubt that man can pull off something like bindings that will force Sukuna-sama to fight. No, perhaps he will attempt to make him go berserk.”

Everyone went still. They didn’t dare to imagine the destruction the King of Curses could cause should he ever lose control with his full power. After interacting with him these past weeks, it was easy to see how powerful and intelligent Sukuna was. While the teens had experienced sparring with the man, they had never faced him when he was truly fighting. Even the brief clashes between Gojo and Sukuna had shown the gap between all sorcerers and the King of Curses. The only one that could put up a fight was Gojo. 

“Then what are we doing standing here?” Megumi asked. “Shouldn’t we stop Kenjaku?”

Gojo shook his head. “I tried to break the barrier, but it won’t budge. Perhaps if I have my full power I can attempt to break it with Hollow Purple, but we won’t know if Sukuna will survive that attack.”

Uraume turned to Angel. “Can’t you use your technique to break it?”

“No, Hana is too weak right now,” Angel replied, “and even with Maximum Output the constant stream of cursed energy will reinforce the barrier. I will need to keep my technique going for a long time to fully break it. I must also find the barrier’s foundation, which Kenjaku is likely hiding very well. Of course, I can technically move into the barrier, but that will put Hana into a confrontation with Kenjaku. With her current state, that is amount to suicide.”

Everyone’s faces became pinched. So they could only wait for Kenjaku to do whatever he planned and break the barrier himself. They could try to destroy it from the outside, but it seemed that things weren’t in their favor. Instead of wasting their time, they could use it for other things.

“We need to prepare,” Megumi said.

“Prepare for what?” Yuuji asked.

“To fight Sukuna,” Gojo replied.

“I’m a curse. Sorcerers exorcise curses. As the strongest sorcerer, it is your duty to kill me should that time arrive.”

Sukuna’s words echoed once again within Uraume’s mind. When they heard that sentence, the curse user couldn’t believe it. The King of Curses was someone proud who would never lower his head to anyone. Though the world cursed and denied his existence, the curse continued to stand proud and cut down all opposition. Yet, now, the man asked a sorcerer to kill him if he became a threat. Why? Could Sukuna truly hold Yuuji’s safety higher than his existence? Why did he ask Gojo Satoru, of all people? The man was called the strongest in this modern era, but did Sukuna trust him that much? Uraume couldn’t understand. 

“Are you planning to kill Sukuna-sama?” Uraume asked. 

The sorcerers went silent at their cold tone. Everyone knew that Uraume merely worked with them because of Sukuna. Now that the curse was captured by Kenjaku and likely going to become their enemy, there was no reason for the curse user to stick around. Were they going to fight?

Gojo didn’t answer for a moment. “If I do?”

Uraume gritted their teeth and clenched their fists. “... I won’t stop you.”

Huh? Everyone was surprised at that answer. Uraume’s loyalty toward Sukuna was unquestionable. How could the curse user say such a thing?

“I know you noticed my presence, and I heard your conversation,” Uraume continued, “since that is Sukuna-sama’s wish then I shall respect it. However, keep in mind, Gojo, I shall not forgive you should that occur.”

The temperature around them dropped into a chill that caused the students to shiver. Gojo examined Uraume for several seconds before he laughed. “No need for threats. Didn’t I say to him that I’ve never made that promise?”

Atsuya couldn’t understand how things went from great to catastrophic so fast. According to Mei Mei, their group had managed to win the fights against ancient sorcerers. They had managed to evacuate almost all the civilians, and things were going amazing. However, just when they were about to claim their victory, Kenjaku had to show his head and steal Sukuna. He still didn’t get how the curse user could forcefully pull out a curse from his vessel, but that guy was a genius, so Atsuya didn’t bother to think too much over it. Now, the biggest problem they had to deal with was the possibility of fighting the King of Curses. 

When he heard the news from Gojo, Atsuya almost wanted to ask if he was joking, but the gloomy mood of the students and Uraume seemed to indicate this wasn’t a joke at his expense. What the fuck? He hadn’t interacted that much with Sukuna, but after those days of being stuck in that building, he knew that curse wasn’t someone you wanted to fight. Even against a heavily weakened Sukuna, Atsuya wasn’t sure he could win. It wasn’t just his combat prowess; the King of Curses was someone with a disgustingly deep understanding of Jujutsu sorcery. You don’t want someone that powerful and smart as your enemy.

Atsuya hoped that whatever process Kenjaku used to forcefully incarnate Sukuna would make him go berserk and merely use brute force. If the curse could still use his intelligence, then they were done. Ugh. Who was he kidding? The heavens hated them, so he knew it was best to assume they had to fight against a fully powered and intelligent King of Curses who wanted to kill them all. Goddamn it. He wanted to go home.

“So, what’s the plan?” Atsuya asked the group.

Gojo replied as he slouched on the sofa. “Nothing much; we just need to wait for Shoko to heal Hana so Angel can use their technique to remove the Soul Piercing Blade’s effect.”

“Yeah, no I get that,” Atsuya said. “What I meant to ask is what are we going to do in case you lose.”

Gojo gasped dramatically. “You don’t believe in me? The strongest sorcerer?”

Frankly, no. Atsuya knew that Gojo was powerful. If someone asked him to beat Gojo, he would rather quit as a sorcerer than fight this monster. However, he also knew Sukuna. That guy was someone who could challenge Gojo and take the title of the strongest. A battle between these two wouldn’t just depend on skill; luck and situation would play a part in this upcoming clash. While he wished that Gojo could handle Sukuna at his full power, his sensibilities told him they had to prepare for the worst-case scenario.

Nanami fixed his glasses. “Only those who don’t mind dying or can perform Reverse Cursed Technique should step up on this fight.” The man shot a look at the group of students in the room. Clearly, he wasn’t okay with the thought of minors entering a life-or-death fight against the strongest curse in history.

“I’ll go,” Itadori said. The cheery boy had become silent and gloomy after returning. Except for Uraume, the kid had taken it the hardest. Even Atsuya, who tried to keep his distance, could see how close Itadori was to the King of Curses. Who would’ve thought that he would ever encounter a vessel that was attached to the curse that was parasitizing him?

“I’ll go too,” Fushiguro said next.

“Me too,” Yonshino added.

Oi, oi, oi. Why were the first-years so ready to jump into danger? If Kugisaki wasn’t passed out right now, Atsuya was sure the girl would also join in.

“Count me in,” Maki said while leaning on the wall. 

“Um, I don’t think I’ll be much help against Sukuna,” Panda said.

“Salmon,” Toge added.

“Well, since the juniors are joining, then I’ve to come too right?” Hakari said. “You shouldn’t go, though, Kirara.”

The other third year rolled their eyes. “I’m not stupid, Kin-chan.”

Nanami sighed deeply. Yeah, Atsuya agreed. He glanced at Gojo who didn’t say anything as his students volunteered themselves to enter the jaws of death. Was the guy that confident he would win?

“Should we call Yuta back?” Panda asked. “He can definitely help.”

“No,” Gojo said. “Yuta should remain behind and guard Tengen. If Sukuna goes berserk, he’ll be the best distraction for Kenjaku to enter the Tombs of the Star Corridor.”

Ugh. This wasn’t good. Atsuya wished they could have the other two special grades as back up but Gojo’s argument was sound. Before they could continue their discussion, the white-haired man suddenly went tense. 

“What’s wrong?” Yaga asked from his seat.

“A large group of people is showing up,” Gojo frowned from behind his blindfold.

“Curse users?” Nanami asked. There were some curse users that showed up in Shinjuku before. Nothing that Atsuya and Nanami couldn’t handle, but they had been annoying. 

“No,” Gojo said. “I think it’s the military.”

Atsuya dragged a hand down his face. Great. Another complication. Sukuna warned them that Kenjaku had blabbered to foreign governments, but they didn’t expect soldiers to actually show up.

“Do we even have to save them?” Maki asked. Kenjaku had opened the barrier near sundown, and now night had descended into the ruined city. Numerous cursed spirits had been unleashed, and now that the sun was gone, this was their turf. Those soldiers might be strong, but they wouldn’t know what hit them until they were at the edge of life and death. Sukuna had warned them that those soldiers were likely here to capture and throw them into laboratories. Yeah, no wonder the students weren’t eager to save those guys from their deaths.

“We should,” Uraume said. “Or else their deaths will feed more into the cursed energy pool that powers the inner barrier and ritual.”

“Great,” Atsuya sighed. “Time to be heroes, I guess.”

Hell. It was hell. That was all Paul could think of as he desperately tried to escape from the monster that chased him. He was a soldier. He knew that death would come from him sooner or later. He had expected it. But… dying from bullets and explosions was one thing; facing those monstrous creatures as they ate and ripped apart his comrades was another. This wasn’t right. It shouldn’t be like this.

Paul and many other soldiers had been ordered to capture ‘sorcerers’ from Japan. They didn’t fully get it, but orders were orders, and good soldiers listened to orders. They expected powerful humans who could wield so-called ‘magic’ but they didn’t expect to encounter those nightmarish creatures.

At first, the city was silent. There were no more civilians left, and the buildings were broken and falling apart by some unseen battles. They searched the areas to find their targets, but they found no living souls. Instead, it was demons who found them. Everything was silent at first. Then, screams of pain. It was nothing like the cries he had heard when his allies were hurt by bullets or explosions. No. This was different. It was as if they were fighting for their soul. 

Paul couldn’t see much, but he could hear it. In between screams, he could hear the sounds of chomping and the tearing of flesh. He could see blood sprouting out of torn-apart limbs as his ally got picked up by an invisible hand. Paul blinked. It wasn’t possible. He blinked again. Shapes began to materialize. Another blink. There was a massive creature towering over them. Paul gasped. A yawning maw opened and chomped down on his comrade, taking off half of their body. 

“AAAAAGGGGGHHH!” Paul screamed as he emptied his gun at the monster.

All those bullets did nothing. The creature merely turned its attention to him and lumbered closer. No! No! Paul knew he had to run. He turned around and sprinted for his life. He had to find a backup. Where were the others?! They were supposed to be close. As he ran, he began to hear more screams echoing within the empty streets of Shinjuku. Each was more horrid than the last.

Tears began streaming down Paul’s face. 

Stomp!

The monster was chasing him.

Stomp!

Paul was going to die.

Stomp!

The monster's shadow loomed over him.

Stomp!

It was going to eat him too.

Stomp!

Paul tripped on a broken road and fell harshly to the ground. Although his uniform protected him, he knew he was dead. The creature took its chance and grabbed his leg. It lifted him upside down. The soldier could only look wide-eyed with fear at the monster.

The maw of death opened again.

Paul could see the remains of his comrade between its teeth.

He closed his eyes and prayed.

BAM!

Paul landed harshly on the ground. He clambered into a sitting position just in time to see a young boy destroying the monster with a simple punch. The creature landed harshly on the ground and slowly disappeared into ashes. The man could only stare blankly at his savior. It was a teen with bright pink hair.

“You okay?” the boy asked.

Paul couldn’t understand what he was saying. The other was speaking in Japanese. The soldier blinked away the tears that had gathered in his eyes.

“Um, well you really should leave. This place isn’t safe.” The teen made a gesture that seemed to tell the soldier to follow him. Paul could only follow. The boy managed to take down the monster that hadn’t been fazed by bullets with mere fists. Paul knew there were more of those creatures in the city, and his only chance of survival was to follow this Japanese teen.

Paul’s choice was correct. As they made their way through the abandoned city, they encountered other soldiers being attacked by those creatures. All of them were quickly dispatched by the teen, who easily took those monsters down with his punches. Although some were lucky, some were already torn apart by those creatures. Whenever the kid found one of the fallen soldiers, he always closed their eyes and made a praying gesture. Still, the teen ordered them to keep moving.

The group eventually arrived at an open field where other soldiers had also gathered. Many of them bore wounds and haunted expressions. None of them tried to fight against the small group of unknown people who were likely their targets. 

“Fushiguro! I found more soldiers!” the boy said to another teen wearing a similar outfit.

“Just tell them to join the group,” the other replied. Unlike the first teen’s warm expression, the second boy gave them a dark look.

“Um, what’s Gojo-sensei doing?” the first kid asked when he saw the tall man standing before a crow from afar. The guy was... talking to it?

“He wants to make an announcement,” the other responded.

“Eh?” 

Outside of Shinjuku, the world was at the edge of a panic. A strange dark veil had dropped on one of the most populated areas in Japan. Nothing could get inside and nothing could get out for a while. Civilians who were locked inside eventually got out. They spoke of monsters and destruction. Those who left the latest talked about a strange group of people who saved them.

“I don’t even know their name,” a young girl said in an interview. “But they seemed like superheroes or something? There’s this one guy who used a small blade and he just cut down those monsters with one strike!”

“Monsters! There were monsters from hell!” a man yelled. “Those fucking things ate my coworkers. It was big but it moved so fast that it easily caught many of us. I was lucky I managed to escape.”

“I met the katana guy,” a young man stated. “I thought those moves only existed in anime, but that man was so fast that I couldn’t even see him.”

“Uuugh.” A woman cried as she held her cat. “I thought I was going to die. I couldn’t leave Yume-chan so I returned home to pick her up. Luckily, I was saved by one of those people. He was a weird kid, and he kept talking using sushi ingredients.”

“This is the end of the world!” another shouted. “We are all going to die!”

Nobody could make heads or tails of what was happening. Although the strange barrier only showed up in Japan, the news was quickly picked up worldwide. Everyone was theorizing about this unnatural event and many experts were called. Things got even more heated when the Japanese government noticed foreign aircraft entering the barrier.

Insults and threats were thrown around globally. Some said this was a terrorist attack from another country. Others claimed this was a weird but natural phenomenon. However, the public finally got a glimpse of the truth when a livestream suddenly showed up online.

“Seriously? A livestream? Won’t that break Jujutsu Regulation number eight?” Megumi asked.

“It’s not as if we have any other choice,” Satoru said. “Kenjaku has already threatened our secrecy with his attack on Shibuya. Shinjuku is the final nail in the coffin. Also, I doubt those foreign governments will stop attacking us if we push them back this time. I think it’s finally time for us to stop hiding in the dark.”

“Che, you just want to bat your eyelashes at the public,” Maki grumbled.

“Why not? They will definitely love me!” Satoru pulled off his blindfold to actually bat his long eyelashes at his students.

The teens groaned simultaneously. 

“Hello! My name is Gojo Satoru, the strongest sorcerer.” The video started with a man with white hair and blue eyes addressing the camera directly. “You must have already noticed the weird barrier that showed up around Shinjuku. Well, it’s the work of a terrorist and we’ve been trying to handle it.”

The camera changed to show the destruction that had occurred in Shinjuku. Marks of battle were left on numerous buildings and the usually busy streets were empty without people.

“To make a long story short, we are Jujutsu sorcerers. Our job is to exorcise curses. They are beings born from human’s negative emotions. Not everyone can see them, so our predecessors did not see the point of making this knowledge public. I also shared the same opinion until a series of events occurred.”

This time, the camera showed foreign soldiers that entered the ruined Shinjuku. They were decked out in full gear and they moved with purpose.

“Someone has a great idea to make us into living batteries! I mean, I know global warming is bad and all that but using live humans as an alternative source of energy? Really guys?”

The scene changed to show several gory scenes of the soldiers now dying. Some of the watchers could catch glimpses of the creatures that took them down, while most people only saw empty space.

“Unfortunately for our unwelcome guests, they can’t handle the threats of curses. You can’t kill them with bullets, you know.”

A soldier was picked up into the air by an unseen hand. The man struggled desperately against the hold and managed to pull out his gun. He tried to shoot the invisible monster but it didn’t work. Before the man could be eaten, a young teen with a large sword appeared and cut down the threat with a single swing of her blade. 

“Anyway, we’re still not done dealing with the terrorist so another big fight is going to occur soon. We try to save as many as we can but there aren’t that many of us. Those that survive will be sent outside soon. Don’t try to come inside unless you have a death wish.”

With those parting words, the video ended.

True to the man’s words, several groups of soldiers soon exited Shinjuku from the ground. All of them looked haggard and traumatized. Many of them were covered in blood and gore. Japanese police quickly took them into custody, and many news outlets picked up on the news about the new development.

While the storm continued to rage outside, the sorcerers that remained were tense. Although they tried their best, many lives were still lost to the cursed spirits. The pool of cursed energy also increased significantly. Uraume observed the inner barrier with deep consternation from the rooftop.

“How long do you think it’ll last?” Satoru asked.

“Perhaps it will only break after sunrise,” Uraume said.

Satoru chuckled. “A battle with the sun rising as a background. How romantic.”

Uraume gave a cold glance. “You are awfully calm. Are you so sure you can beat, Sukuna-sama?”

Satoru stretched his arms. He had changed his usual black outfit to something more traditional. Now, he was wearing a tight-fitting black shirt, white baggy training pants, and black martial arts slippers. Although he wasn’t usually this picky about his clothing when facing an enemy, he didn’t want his chosen wardrobe to limit his movements. While the outfit was eerily similar to the late Fushiguro Toji’s, he had to admit it was comfortable.

“Nah,” Satoru replied. “I just don’t see the point of panicking.”

Despite Shoko’s best attempts, it still took Hana a while to recover. Kenjaku hadn’t just cut off two of her limbs; he also placed minor restrictions on the girl. Luckily, it was nowhere as complex as Sukuna’s seal, so Satoru could remove it once the girl became much stronger.

“This will get hurt,” Hana warned as she hovered above him. The winged trumpet clasped in her remaining hand.

“I can handle it.” Satoru gave a thumbs up.

The other sorcerers kept their distance as they watched Satoru and Hana. They had picked an open clearing where the girl could safely unleash Jacob’s Ladder. 

“Okay, here we go!” Hana took a deep breath and blew the trumpet.

Jacob’s Ladder!

An enormous circle of light appeared in the sky. A moment later, a massive pillar of light shot down and hit Satoru squarely. He closed his eyes. It was stinging slightly, but nothing he couldn’t handle. When the cursed technique subsided, the man could feel all the bindings fall apart. Satoru exhaled.

“Sensei! Are you okay?” Yuuji shouted when it was safe to approach. The rest of the sorcerers followed behind him while Hana lowered herself to the ground, though she remained hovering above it.

“Yup, nothing a small Reverse Cursed Technique can’t fix,” Satoru replied with a grin.

“Still, let me check,” Shoko insisted as she approached him.

Satoru let his oldest friend fuss over him. He knew it wasn’t because she doubted his ability. The possible fight against Sukuna was putting everyone on edge, and they only wanted him to be in top form. Shoko examined him with her eyes and cursed technique, and when she found nothing amiss, she nodded her head. 

“What did I say?” Satoru said.

Shoko rolled her eyes.

“Um, sensei,” Yuuji said. “About Sukuna…” 

Satoru looked at his student. He knew the kid had to be very worried about the King of Curses. Out of everyone here, the boy was the closest one to the man. Knowing that there was a possibility that his teacher might have to kill Sukuna, he had to be tearing him inside. On the one hand, Yuuji was a sorcerer, and their job was to kill curses. On the other hand, he cared a lot about this grumpy but soft man who had always helped him. To weigh the weight of the world against your own selfish desire. Satoru was quite familiar with that dilemma.

“Don’t worry, Yuuji-kun,” Satoru said. “I’m going to bring your cranky uncle back. I’m the strongest sorcerer, remember?”

The boy gave a small but happy smile at those words. Megumi decided to interrupt by elbowing his friend. 

“Don’t worry about it, Itadori,” the black-haired boy said, “I doubt this man will allow one of his favorite victims to annoy to get away.”

“Yeah, he loves to annoy Sukuna too much,” Junpei added.

“Death is a mercy according to this guy,” Maki said.

“Poor Sukuna,” Panda muttered.

“Salmon,” Toge agreed.

Satoru pouted. “How can you slander me like this? I care about Sukuna a lot!”

Yaga and Nanami sighed together. Kusakabe was pinching the bridge of his nose while Mei Mei chuckled to herself. Before the sorcerers could continue, another person interrupted again.

“Hey, Gojo,” Kashimo said with crossed arms. He had been watching the scene from afar silently. “Whoever wins that fight, I’ll challenge the winner.”

Satoru grinned. Heh. This guy still couldn’t let go of that, huh? “Sure, whatever.”

The sun had almost risen, so Satoru, Utahime, and Ijichi quickly went to their position. The three of them watched in silence as the inner barrier finally broke down. Not even a second later, an aura of death and destruction immediately exploded outward. It was almost like a physical blow to many sorcerers. Ijichi shook on his spot while Utahime paled.

Satoru kept gazing forward. With his Six Eyes, he could easily see a massive figure slowly walking out of the smoke and falling shards of the barrier. The man was tall, taller than Satoru. He had four arms and pale pink hair. Black markings covered his body while a familiar large eight-handled wheel hovered above his head. As the curse raised his head, four red eyes looked up.

The King of Curses had finally fully incarnated.

Omake:

Sukuna: No... please no...
Notes:

    To the readers asking me to show Sukuna in his true form: You’re welcome.

    I don’t get how the armies from other countries managed to enter Japanese soil without global backlash, but hey, they did it in the manga, so…
    Also, since the manga is nearing its end, I really wanna know how Gege is going to handle cursed energy, Tengen, and the Jujutsu society. I have been guessing that they may try to erase cursed energy entirely, but with two chapters left, I don’t know how that’s going to occur. So, this fic may end up being a huge canon divergence. Cuz like I can’t see myself erasing cursed energy from this fic.

Chapter 30

(See the end of the chapter for notes.)
Chapter Text

The Jujutsu Society was in a state of chaos. The Shibuya incident had already put everyone on edge, but with another attack on a big city, Shinjuku, everything was falling apart. The higher-ups had been trying to keep everything under wraps and stopped the reveal of the Jujutsu society to the public. The continuous absence of Gojo Satoru also puts extra stress on numerous elders. Yet, those stressful days were not comparable to the mayhem that was caused when another massive barrier showed up in Shinjuku.

Before the elders could even order sorcerers to handle the crisis, they received a notification that an unknown group of people had entered the isolated city. A report of a white-haired man sealed the fact that Gojo Satoru had made its move. After getting that news, the higher-ups were locked in a fierce debate on what they should do.

Should they still send people? But wouldn’t that put them in direct confrontation with the strongest sorcerer? Had the man recovered his power? Did the Gojo clan know anything about this? 

As if things weren’t chaotic enough, the elders got another report of foreign militaries entering the barrier during the night. Although more voices pushed sending sorcerers to Shinjuku, the majority still voted against moving. Yet, before they could decide, they got another round of terrible news.

The Jujutsu society was completely revealed. 

And it was all thanks to Gojo Satoru.

The higher-ups could only watch silently as they saw the strongest sorcerer directly address the public. The man didn’t even mince his words and stated that they were sorcerers and were currently dealing with a terrorist attack.

“What the hell was Gojo Satoru thinking?!” an elder shouted.

“This is treason! He has broken one of our tenets!” another exclaimed.

“Revealing the world of Jujutsu to mundane humans! How dare he!” an elder added.

As protests and insults were thrown around, Gakuganji Yoshinobu could only listen. He had been forced to be stuck within this chamber as the elders argued with themselves. Although he had always been someone who liked to follow the rules and orders, he couldn’t deny that he had been dissatisfied. Gojo Satoru might be someone eccentric, nonconformist, and disobedient, but at least he knew how to react swiftly. 

As sorcerers, it was their duty to protect those who were weaker and could not see curses. That was the responsibility numerous sorcerers had taken, yet the elders could only throw words and insults in the safety of their meeting room. Yoshinobu sighed as he remembered the conversation he had with Yaga Masamichi. He had been very surprised to receive a call from the fugitive. Though a part of him ordered him to report it, the bigger part of him forced him to stay silent.

“I do not hate you despite our differences, Principal Gakuganji,” Yaga said. “I understand why you have been so conservative and so eager to follow orders.”

“What are you trying to say?” Yoshinobu replied. There was no way Yaga would risk being discovered for a simple talk.

“I know why the higher-ups want to capture me,” Yaga responded. “It’s because of Panda, isn’t it? They want to know how I made him.”

Yoshinobu didn’t reply. The elders had always been interested in the cursed corpse and his high degree of self. Yet none dared to extract the answer from Yaga because of the looming shadow called Gojo Satoru. Everyone knew that any move against his old teacher would spur the strongest sorcerer into action. That is why when the higher-ups heard that Gojo had lost his power, they also decided to capture Yaga. Unfortunately, the Principal managed to escape their grasp and remain missing.

“To create a cursed corpse like Panda, you have to replicate soul information from physical information then input that into cursed corpse cores,” Yaga said. “Then, you have to place three compatible souls and have them constantly observe each other. Eventually, that will stabilize each of the souls and grant the cursed corpse self-awareness. Within three months, it will also gain the ability to replenish its cursed energy.”

Yoshinobu froze. “... Why are you telling me this?”

“... Who knows? Perhaps it’s a curse from me, or perhaps I want to trust my judgment.”

The knowledge that Yaga had given Yoshinobu was indeed a curse. He knew he should report this finding to the other higher-ups, yet his tongue stayed stubbornly silent. It was with this heavy thought that the old sorcerer joined the meeting. The other elders hadn’t stopped bickering with each other when the massive door slid open, revealing a group of people.

Several higher-ranking sorcerers were guarding three familiar students who had their arms tied with suppression seals. Yoshinobu’s eyes widened. “What is the meaning of this?! Why are you bringing Kyoto students here?!”

Kamo Noritoshi, Miwa Kasumi, and Nishimiya Momo looked desperately at their Principal.

“Why look so surprised Gakuganji? After the defection of Iori Utahime, Todo Aoi, and Nitta Aratta, many people have already suspected that the Kyoto branch has been compromised,” an elder said. 

“We’re only making sure that there won’t be any more traitors among our ranks,” another added.

“How does apprehending students help with dealing with the crisis in Shinjuku?!” Yoshinobu demanded.

“Of course it's related! They may be connected to Gojo Satoru!” an old man replied testily.

“We should’ve stopped that man from becoming a teacher!” an elder clicked her tongue. “Look how he has poisoned young minds.”

Yoshinobu tightened his fists and asked, “Are you implying that you plan to execute them?” 

“Not right now, but perhaps we can try to use them to lure out those fugitives from their hiding holes,” the first elder replied.

The three students became pale when they heard that answer. Yoshinobu gritted his teeth. Foolish. How Foolish. The Jujutsu world was in the midst of chaos, yet these elders still stuck on being angry over a man who never offered them any respect. Instead of figuring out how to deal with the public that had found out their hidden society or how to deal with the terrorists, they still aimed to take down Gojo, who, despite many disagreements, had a similar goal with them.

Without hesitation, Yoshinobu picked up his guitar and sent attacks toward the sorcerers guarding the students. Then, he quickly broke the seals on their wrists and stood before them. “Run! You fool!”

The three Kyoto students looked surprised at his action. The other elders also exclaimed in anger and shock. “How are you, Gakuganji!”

“We should’ve expected that you’re a traitor too!”

The high-ranking sorcerers he had just taken down got up to their feet. Since they were too close to the students, Yoshinobu dared not use his strongest attack. Without looking away from his enemies, he shouted again, “I said run!”

The three students finally got the order and began to head to the exit. In the meantime, Yoshinobu tried to stop the sorcerers from chasing, but one managed to slip past. The woman threw her throwing knife toward Nishimiya’s back.

Clang!

Instead of embedding itself into the girl’s back, a sword intercepted the weapon and redirected its trajectory. A young male teen landed between the three Kyoto students and the pursuing sorcerers. 

With cold eyes, Okkotsu Yuta gazed at the higher-ups.

When Yuta heard that the Kyoto students had been captured from Ino Takuma, he was ready to save them. Although he wasn’t as close to the students from the Kyoto branch, he had met Todo. It was obvious that the remaining students were targeted after Todo, Nitta, and Iori left to help Gojo. 

“This could be a trap,” Tsukumo Yuki warned. 

“I know, but I can’t just leave them,” Yuta replied. “Also, it may be best if we can draw out Kenjaku early so we won’t have to fight him in the Tombs of the Star.”

Master Tengen had been quite receptive to their visit and did not disclose their locations to the higher-ups. Although Tsukumo had bad opinions about the ancient sorcerer, Yuta felt that Tengen was cooperative and reasonable. At first, they even offered to help them beat Kenjaku by analyzing his Domain, but Tengen looked quite shocked when Yuta reported about the curse user’s open-barrier Domain.

“It seems I’ve fallen behind,” Tengen said, “while that person continues to rush forward and chase after more knowledge.” 

Either way, it would be best if Tengen could be kept as far away from Kenjaku. Unfortunately, since the curse user was also a master at barriers, Tengen could not lock him out using their technique.

Despite Tsukumo’s misgivings, the woman let Yuta go to save the Kyoto students. He arrived just in time to stop an attack on a girl. With only one look, he could guess what just happened. It seemed that Gakuganji did not appreciate the other elders attacking his students and decided to rebel. Although Gojo had often complained about the Kyoto Principal, it seemed the old man still had his own values that he would not trade for obedience.

Yuta quickly took down the sorcerers and forcefully pulled back Gakuganji. Despite the rude treatment, the old man didn’t protest and let himself get dragged out of the chamber. Instead of looking scared at the special grade’s presence, the elders looked angry and rather excited. The boy frowned.

“Okkotsu Yuta!” an elder shouted as he followed the teen while brandishing his sword. “You’ve finally shown yourself!”

“If you think we’re not aware of you slinking around our turf then you’re mistaken!” another higher-up exclaimed. 

At that moment, numerous cursed energy signatures popped out around them. 

“Eeeek!” Miwa shrieked when she saw the number of enemies surrounding them. It was a mix of members from the Zen’in and Kamo clans. The Gojo clan was missing; it seemed that even with Gojo Satoru being a fugitive, the clan still refused to move without their head. However, the number one thing that caught Yuta’s attention was the face of Naoya Zen’in.

“Okkotsu!” Naoya shouted as he stood in front of his clan members. “Just because you’re a special grade, don’t think you can just do whatever you want! Your slight against the Zen’in clan will be paid in blood!”

Yuta didn’t answer and merely observed the situation. If he were correct, then there were at least two dozen sorcerers. Including the elders, then that made thirty people. If he was alone, he could easily escape, but he had people he had to protect.

“This is madness!” Noritoshi exclaimed, “Why are we fighting amongst ourselves at this moment!”

“Silence! Traitor!” a Kamo clan member said. 

The situation wasn’t in Yuta’s favor, but there was no point in regretting past decisions. The boy quickly wore his ring and called forth Rika. 

“Come,” Yuta said.

As the dreaded Queen of Curses appeared behind the special grade, many opposing sorcerers couldn’t help but shudder. Yet, their sheer number gave them confidence that they could take on the powerful special-grade sorcerer. All of them immediately leaped to attack the boy. Yuta ordered Rika to protect the Kyoto students as best as she could while he handled the enemies.

Naoya was the most aggressive opponent. Although Yuta had never interacted with him for long, he had met and heard of him. Maki had sometimes grumbled about this man. Both he and his father were peas in a pod, but the younger man was much more quick-tempered.

It wasn’t just him who showed up. Other high-ranking Zen’in clan members joined. Yuta knew of Ogi and Jinichi, but there was also a younger man and an older man in their group. Surprisingly, he could not find Naobito here.

The powerful members of the Zen’in clan exclusively targeted Yuta. Although dodging their attacks wasn’t difficult, Naoya was particularly annoying. When the man almost landed a hit on the special grade, he grinned, “Not so great now, are you? I don’t get what everyone sees in you. You are no Gojo Satoru.”

Obviously, sensei was sensei. This was definitely not about Yuta. Naoya seemed to be a man with a sensitive ego. Perhaps he didn’t appreciate that someone young and from an unknown background became a special grade while he was stuck at special grade one. 

Instead of replying, Yuta said, “Domain Expansion.”

All the opponents froze in their tracks. All this time, Yuta merely wanted to draw the enemies closer so he didn’t have to make such a big domain. It was a risky move, but he had to quickly take them down. The opposite side was shocked and afraid. They knew of Yuta’s cursed technique, his ridiculous reserve of cursed energy, and the curse that was haunting him. However, they didn’t know that the boy had developed his own Domain. Had he learned it during his stay abroad?

Those who knew of Simple Domains and Falling Blossom Emotion automatically used that anti-domain technique. However, more than half of the sorcerers did not and they were immediately taken down by powerful thunderstrikes from above. 

Naoya was sweating a bit when he saw some of his clan members taken down with the sure-hit attack. Useless trash! To make matters worse, it seemed that Yuta’s Domain could select which ones to target so Gakuganji and the Kyoto students could freely move. Yuta targeted Naoya since he was the one posing the highest threat. The man was using Falling Blossom Emotion so he could move more freely than those with Simple Domain. 

The other Zen’in members tried to help the man, but Rika quickly got in their path. This time, Yuta was on the offensive. Although Falling Blossom Emotion could stop the Domain’s sure-hit attack, it did not make the man immune to physical hits. As Yuta continued to swing his newly picked-up katana, the other was busy expecting his other copied abilities. Using this distraction, Yuta slammed his fist at his stomach, immobilizing him. 

He followed it up with an enhanced kick, which finally broke the Falling Blossom Emotion technique. The sure-hit attack activated and struck the Zen’in sorcerer. Knowing that wasn’t enough, Yuta didn’t hesitate to slam his katana straight through the man’s chest.

“Rika!” Yuta called. The curse immediately stopped dealing with the other sorcerers and flew toward him. Naoya, who was still heavily stunned, couldn’t do anything as Rika grabbed him and immediately gobbled him up.

“How dare you!” the other Zen’in clan members shouted in horror. 

As those sorcerers ran toward him, Yuta used Toge’s technique that he had picked up from the katana, “Don’t move!” 

The enemies could only obey and watched as the special grade picked up another sword and swung it toward it. It released a powerful slice that cut them in half. Just like before, Rika quickly picked up the fallen bodies and ate them.

On the other side of the battlefield, Gakuganji and the Kyoto students were handling the elders. Although they loved to call themselves the leaders of the Jujutsu world, it was clear they had not entered the battlefield for a long time. Even Miwa, who could no longer use her katana and was forced to utilize hand-to-hand combat, took down an elder by herself.

“We survived!” Miwa shouted.

“Are we traitors too then?” Nishimiya asked.

“I think we’re well past that,” Noritoshi replied.

Seeing there were no more enemies, Yuta finally decided to take down his Domain. However, before they could even release a breath of relief, they heard clapping. The group turned to find Kenjaku standing on a nearby roof.

“Good work!” the curse user smiled.

Yuta grimaced.

Shit.

Now that the King of Curses had shown himself, Utahime quickly activated her cursed technique while Ijichi activated the Simple Barrier to hide Satoru’s technique. Although there wasn’t any instrument to accompany her dance, the woman still put her whole being to power her Solo Forbidden Area. Satoru felt his cursed energy and output increase as the ritual progressed. 

“Nine Ropes.”

Satoru lowered his stance.

“Polarized Light.”

He clasped his hands together.

“Crow and Declaration.”

He fully channeled his cursed energy into his right hand.

“Between Front and Back.”

Satoru stood up straight and raised his right hand. Folding his thumb and middle finger inward, he pointed it straight at the King of Curses.

“Hollow Technique: Purple.”

The curse immediately raised his hands to tank the oncoming attack that suddenly headed toward him. Ijichi’s barrier had successfully hidden the massive cursed energy output that Satoru released. Hollow Purple erased all buildings within its path and hit the King of Curses directly. Yet, the sorcerer knew that wasn’t the end. Without hesitation, he leaped off the rooftop and flew straight toward the curse. Despite the smoke and debris, the man could see the massive figure of his opponent and immediately tried to kick him.

BAM!

The King of Curses blocked his blow with his lower set of arms. Hmm. It seemed Hollow Purple could only damage the curse from a distance. If he wanted to deal significant damage, Satoru would need to hit him with the technique at a much closer distance.

“What’s with the new look, Sukuna?” Satoru asked as he evaded the retaliatory attack.

The King of Curses didn’t answer and stared blankly at him. Using his Six Eyes, Satoru could see Sukuna’s soul trapped within his new vessel. Compared to the seals placed in Yuuji, the ones Kenjaku had put on this new body were much more thorough and powerful. In this state, Sukuna wasn’t the person controlling this vessel. If Satoru had to guess, the closest thing he could call this ‘King of Curses’ was a shikigami. Something akin to Mahoraga. It was intelligent enough, yet it lacked the will that humans had. Should that be the case, then his opponent right now could be considered a rampaging Mahoraga with the shape and power of Sukuna.

‘Che. That guy sure is smart.’ Satoru cursed Kenjaku internally. Only that curse user could create a monstrosity before him. More importantly, he wasn’t sure about the strange, cursed object that exuded the power of the Ten Shadows technique floating above the King of Curses’ head.

“How did Sukuna obtain Mahoraga?” Yaga asked as they watched the ongoing fight from the numerous screens Mei Mei had set up. Her technique allowed them to watch the ongoing battles between the two strongest sorcerers closely.

“It has to be another nifty cursed object Kenjaku has picked up during his long ass life,” Kusakabe muttered. “What do you think, Fushiguro?”

All the sorcerers turned to look at the Ten Shadows technique wielder. Fushiguro frowned deeply. “I don’t know. That thing certainly resembles Mahoraga’s eight-handled wheel. I also feel traces of something similar to my technique in that cursed object, but I can’t be sure about its full capability.”

“So Gojo will have to figure it out himself, huh?” Yaga sighed.

Everyone’s faces became heavy. Fighting the King of Curses alone was already a tall task, but having to deal with the possibility of dealing with Mahoraga also raised the level of danger significantly.

Before the blasted-off arms could regenerate, Satoru quickly launched into another series of attacks at the curse. Those four arms weren’t just for show. Fighting someone with extra limbs would put him at a disadvantage in hand-to-hand combat. The man blocked a kick from the King of Curses and tried to punch him. The curse raised his arm to block his hit and retaliated. Instead of blocking, the sorcerer let himself fall and used his technique to throw the curse away.

CRACK!

The King of Curses landed harshly on the ground, and before he could fully get up, Satoru had already gotten close as he attempted to slam his enhanced foot on his head. While keeping his distance, the curse was eventually led to a bridge by the man, and the sorcerer quickly cut it off to use it as a projectile to throw his opponent away.

The rubble pushed the King of Curses several feet back into the air before he broke it apart with Cleave. In the next moment, another slash flew toward Satoru, but instead of hitting the sorcerer, it landed on the building behind him. Seeing the sorcerer taken off guard, the curse leaped toward him and aimed his four fists toward the opponent. Satoru quickly jumped into the falling parts of the building and used them as obstacles. It didn’t stop the King of Curses for long, but it gave the man some time to create distance.

CRASH!

The two landed on the road and observed each other. Hmm. Although Satoru assumed this thing was similar to a rampaging shikigami, the King of Curses was much more deliberate and thoughtful. The vessel seemed to have mastered Sukuna’s cursed technique, but had it grasped his Domain?

“Let’s find out.” Satoru grinned and created his mudra. “Domain Expansion!”

“They’re clashing Domains now!” Yuuji shouted when they saw the black sphere appearing in the city.

“It’s not immediately destroyed so Gojo must have changed his barrier’s condition,” Nanami said.

Still, not being able to watch the ongoing fight was causing them great unease. Although the sorcerers couldn’t do anything from their current position, they didn’t want to lose sight of the battle’s progression. However, before they could feel agonized any longer, Gojo’s barrier suddenly broke apart.

“What?!” everyone exclaimed.

“Was sensei’s barrier not strong enough to handle Sukuna’s Domain despite changing the condition?!” Fushiguro asked.

“It’s possible,” Kusakabe said. “Gojo is fighting a fully powered Sukuna and although I’m not that familiar with it, it seems open-barrier Domain is generally stronger than regular ones.”

“Technically, Gojo can make the size of his barrier smaller,” Yaga continued. “But even then it has its limits.”

Gojo was now being cut apart by Malevolent Shrine’s attacks. Seeing the usually invincible teacher being bloodied and wounded made the students pale and tense. Was the strongest sorcerer going to lose? Yet, despite being cornered, there was a grin on the man’s face. Using his Reverse Cursed Technique, the sorcerer attempted to heal his ever-increasing wounds.

Tap!

With a leap toward the edge of the barrier, Gojo seemed to plan to leave the radius of the Domain’s attack range, yet the King of Curses quickly jumped on him to prevent his escape. The two exchanged blows again. However, despite Gojo’s mastery of martial arts, the extra pair of arms gives the curse an edge. Luckily, the sorcerer was able to create some distance to give him a chance to create a Simple Domain.

“Simple Domain! Gojo-sensei can now stop the sure-hit attacks and heal right!” Junpei exclaimed.

“That will only give him some time,” Ieri said.

“Against a Domain as powerful as Sukuna’s, you can’t do much without a proper Domain,” Kusakabe added.

As expected, Gojo’s Simple Domain was slowly chipping away. The King of Curses quickly engaged in another fistfight with the sorcerer which finally broke the safe zone. Before more slashes could land on Gojo, the man used the technique again. However, instead of healing himself, the sorcerer let the wounds stay on his body.

“Why is he not using the Reverse Cursed Technique?” Hakari asked.

“Is it because he’s out of cursed energy?” Junpei asked.

“No way, Gojo-sensei can’t run out of power like that with his Six Eyes,” Fushiguro replied.

Their questions were answered when Gojo suddenly got close and pointed his fingers at the curse. 

“Red!”

BANG!

The technique blasted the King of Curses at Malevolent Shrine, which left him stunned for several seconds. Gojo used this chance to get out of the Domain’s range and fully heal himself as he grinned at his opponent. 

“How the hell did he?!” Kusakabe exclaimed.

“Ah! I think sensei healed his burnt-out cursed technique with Reverse Cursed Technique!” Yuuji said. Everyone turned to the boy after hearing that wild response. Seeing the questioning looks, the teen explained, “I heard them talk about it at night. It was a pretty difficult topic so I can’t fully understand. But I think Sukuna and Gojo-sensei said that you could quickly recover by… damaging your brain and healing it?”

“That sounds insane!” Kusakabe shouted. Who would dare to intentionally damage their own brains? Even if you could theoretically heal it afterward, nobody could be sure it would work! The most likely scenario to occur was for the sorcerer to get severe brain damage. This was a technique you had to do correctly the first time, or you’re dead!

Ieiri frowned. “It is possible, but you’ll need to be a genius and crazy to even dare to attempt it…”

And the two people fighting certainly fit that criteria. The King of Curses quickly created a mudra to expand the range of his Domain the moment he got up. In return, Gojo also made that familiar sign with his right hand.

“Domain Expansion!”

This time, no familiar black barrier appeared. As the range of Malevolent Shrine expanded, a black hole suddenly materialized within the city. All eyes watching the fight rounded in surprise as they saw the two Domains clash.

“Open-barrier!” Kusakabe shouted. “When the fuck did Gojo master it too!”

“Just now? I think?” Panda said.

“Salmon!” Inumaki added excitedly.

“Fucking geniuses!” Kusakabe exclaimed as he slapped his forehead.

Nanami pinched the bridge of his nose at the sight. Only someone like Gojo could pull off several extreme techniques for the first time in the middle of a life-and-death battle. “But is that wise? Sukuna is still the more experienced one out of the two.”

Nobody could answer that question. Gojo and Sukuna had returned to another round of hand-to-hand fight. Just like they feared, Sukuna’s open-barrier was more refined than Gojo's newly established one. Malevolent Shrine was chipping away at Unlimited Void, yet the sorcerer continued with his offense. However, it seemed the curse was also quite troubled by the direct clashing of their open-barrier Domains.

“Sukuna is slowing down a bit, don’t you think?” Kirara said.

“Maybe it’s because whatever the vessel is, it’s not fully done analyzing Sukuna’s cursed technique,” Fushiguro theorized. “If that thing is based on Mahoraga it may need time to process and understand Shrine.”

“Ah! Is that why he’s not pulling out Divine Flame yet?” Yuuji asked.

The sorcerers who had been in Shibuya had a pinched face when they remembered that powerful fire attack. If the King of Curses were to use that technique now, there would be no way Gojo could survive.

On the screen, Gojo took advantage of his opponent’s slower reaction time to land a solid hit on the curse’s chest. The King of Curses was shoved back several feet at the impact. At that moment, Malevolent Shrine managed to overcome Unlimited Void, yet the curse’s own Domain also fell apart.

“Wooooah! Gojo-san!” Hakari passionately yelled, and the others joined.

“Does that mean the two of them can’t use cursed techniques at this moment?” Nitta asked.

“But Gojo-sensei can heal his own cursed technique immediately so he should have an edge,” Junpei said.

“I don’t think that’s true,” Ieri replied, “Sukuna is the better healer between those two, but then again we don’t know whether the vessel has also grasped that level of Reverse Cursed Technique yet.”

With their Domains destroyed, the two fought with their fists and kicks once again. Despite things slowly tilting in his favor, Satoru felt something was off. He couldn’t understand his opponent. The vessel’s face remained ambivalent and cold despite the attacks the sorcerer had been raining on them. He couldn’t understand why the curse wasn’t using other Shrine techniques or even the Ten Shadows. The damned eight-handled wheel had never once spun during their fight.

What was it planning?

If Satoru were to assume this thing could fully access Sukuna’s knowledge and intelligence, then he had to be well aware of the Ten Shadows and Limitless techniques. Perhaps it knew about the fact that the sorcerer was aware of his trump card? The man frowned as he rubbed away the blood that flowed down one of his nostrils.

Hmm. Although he had been trying to understand how to heal better from Sukuna, it was clear that forcefully resetting his burnt-out technique repeatedly was a bit much for him. Still, he couldn’t stop now.

“Domain Expansion!”

The two Domains clashed once more. Satoru was slowly grasping this open-barrier technique. With a grin, he began to rain down blows on the King of Curses. While the sorcerer was getting more comfortable at fighting within the open barrier, the curse was still not performing at top speed or strength. This gave Satoru an edge, and he was able to damage the vessel enough for their Domain to break at the same time again.

“Simultaneous again!” Kusakabe shouted.

Uraume frowned. They felt that something was strange, but they couldn’t be sure what it was. Although they didn’t enjoy how Gojo was slightly dominating the King of Curses in this fight, they didn’t believe it was the reason. 

So, what was it?

As the two sorcerers on the TV clashed their Domains for the fourth time, it became obvious that Gojo was getting faster and better. Yet, the one bearing the visage of the King of Curses continued with the same tactic. Why was it holding back?

As the two clashed their Domains for the fifth time, the answer to that pressing question revealed itself. The King of Curses was getting slower, and Gojo was able to land a solid, which allowed Unlimited Void to finally take hold. Receiving the direct mental attack, the curse halted. The sorcerer quickly moved closer, and yet, before he could land another hit. A white and massive shikigami appeared from within the shadow.

It was Mahoraga.

Everyone was shocked to silence. Gojo tried to use Red, but before he could perform his technique, the shikigami destroyed Unlimited Void with a swing of its blade. 

CRACK!

“How?!” Fushiguro shouted as he got up from his seat. “The dharma wheel has never turned even once! It shouldn’t be possible!”

“I’ll try to get us to clash our Domains several times so I can ensure Mahoraga is already adjusted to Unlimited Void when I summon him. Of course, that means I have to deal with the burden of adaptability, but I can force Megumi’s soul to be the one to shoulder it.”

Shit.

Satoru remembered Sukuna’s warnings, yet he didn’t expect this cursed object to be able to force the burden of adaptability on others. He had been so sure that the dharma wheel on the vessel’s head was Mahoraga’s that he didn’t think that it could just be the shape of the cursed tool. With his Six Eyes, he took the time to finally confirm that it was indeed the real Sukuna that was bearing the burden.

“You sly, fucker,” Satoru gritted out. 

Kenjaku, that bitch. He cursed the curse user again for being able to find or create this cursed object that was causing him trouble. Fine. The situation wasn’t good, but there were some silver linings. That cursed object seemed to have limits. After summoning Mahoraga, who had adapted to Unlimited Void, the eight-handled wheel had become cracked in some parts. Now that he could pay closer attention, it seemed that the amount of cursed energy required to power this thing was enormous. That was why the curse had been slow, and Gojo could quickly beat him in Domain clash despite being new at using the open-barrier technique.

Now that the cursed object was damaged, it might be possible for Satoru to destroy it. His biggest threat would be the King of Curses learning the World Cutting Slash. Four turns. That was how much time it would take for Mahoraga to grasp Limitless. And then it would take another turn of the dharma wheel for his opponent to grasp the World Cutting Slash. So, five in total.

“If you ever use Reverse Cursed Technique to recover your burnt-out technique, remember that you can only unleash five Domains at most,” Sukuna said, “any more than that and you will get a backlash.”

Remembering Sukuna’s warning, Satoru refrained from unleashing another Domain Expansion. Unfortunately, his opponent also inherited the real King of Curses’ knowledge and didn’t try to open his own Domain.

Tchink!

Another smaller, eight-handled wheel appeared above the curse’s head. So, it had started.

“You no good copy,” Satoru said. “You can’t think for yourself so you decide to follow his plan.”

The curse didn’t reply, and the two engaged in another duel. Satoru quickly used Blue and forced numerous rubbles to slam into the King of Curses from all sides. Knowing that it would stop the curse for long, he had already pointed red straight at the curse that was exiting its rocky prison. 

Twang!

The King of Curses dodged the man’s attack at the last moment and slammed his fists to the ground. It broke the road and sent many rubbles into the air. Those obstacles only blocked the sorcerer’s vision for a second, yet the curse already got close and threw two of his right fists at him. Satoru had to block both of them with his two hands, but the sheer power sent him flying back. The sorcerer landed on a sidewalk and looked up just in time to see the first turn of the dharma wheel.

Whirr!

One.

Using his Blue, he pulled numerous abandoned vehicles toward the curse. When the King of Curses got distracted while dodging, he summoned several spheres of Blue to join the chaos. The resulting impact resulted in an explosion that sent the curse flying back. 

Whirr!

Two.

Satoru didn’t let this bother him and flew toward his opponent. He pulled his arm back and punched.

Black Flash!

The damage from the critical hit stunned the King of Curses for several seconds it gave Satoru a chance to land a hit on the cursed object. He channeled the maximum output of his cursed energy.

BANG!

His enhanced fist slammed into the cursed tool, and it began to show more cracks. Satoru grinned. It was just a hunch, but it seemed this thing couldn’t summon shikigami and continue the analyzation process at the same time. Good. It would be too tricky if he had to deal with Mahoraga or other shikigami at the same time. Yet before he could celebrate for long, the curse grabbed his legs and slammed him to the ground. 

CRACK!

Satoru quickly jumped out of the crater his body had made to dodge the feet coming down to crush his skull. Unfortunately, his opponent refused to let him keep his distance and locked him in hand-to-hand combat. The sorcerer was forced to be on the defensive since handling four arms was too much.

BAM!

The King of Curses managed to land a solid punch on Satoru’s stomach. Ignoring the pain, he pointed his arm straight at the curse. 

“Red!”

The curse was able to block the technique with its arms, but the ability destroyed two out of four limbs. The two of them leaped back from each other.

Whirr!

Three.

Now with only two arms left, Satoru was more confident at fighting in close combat. After landing several hits using his fists, the sorcerer dodged a swing from the curse and kicked the curse’s leg. It wasn’t enough to completely knock him down, but it destabilized the curse enough that the man could land another hit.

“Red!”

The King of Curses blocked the oncoming attack with his remaining arms, but it was close enough that Red still damaged his face.

Whirr!

Four.

Despite the heavy wounds, the curse didn’t stop and slammed his regenerated fists toward Satoru, which the man dodged by rolling sideways and jumping back. The sorcerer retaliated by shooting maximum output Blue at the curse. 

Although the King of Curses managed to evade the technique, the sheer power of the sphere still pulled the curse into the air. The King of Curses slammed his hands into the building and tried to slow himself. Seeing an opening, Satoru flew up and landed another hit on his opponents.

Black Flash!!

The King of Curses was stunned once again. Using this opening, Satoru began to chant, “Phase. Paramita. Pillars of Light.”

The sorcerer leaped back as he pointed his fingers at the other sphere behind the curse.

“Cursed Technique Reversal: Red.”

Bang!

A small Red orb shot past the King of Curses and combined with the large Blue sphere behind him.

“Nine Ropes. Polarized Light. Crow and Declaration. Between Front and Back.”

The curse fully activated his Reverse Cursed Technique to heal his wounds as he attempted to escape from the blast zone.

“Hollow Technique: Purple.”

BOOOOOM!!!!!!

All the sorcerers held their breath as smoke covered Mei Mei’s crows’ visions. When things became clearer, they could see a slightly wounded Gojo standing. It seemed that he had even gotten caught in his own technique's explosion. Luckily, the King of Curses was in a rougher shape. The dharma wheel above his head was utterly destroyed, and he was leaning heavily on a fallen wall.

“Is sensei winning?” Junpei asked.

Kusakabe allowed himself to grin. “Without that cursed tool, that vessel won’t be able to use the Ten Shadows technique anymore. Even if he puts up a fight, Gojo is in better condition than him, especially after those Black Flashes.”

“Does this mean…” Yuuji couldn’t help but feel blossoming hope within his chest.

“Yeah, Gojo wins.”

Smiles and grins began to appear on the sorcerers’ faces. Yet, at that moment, the King of Curses raised his remaining hand to make a slicing motion. 

Twing!

Everyone’s eyes widened.

Gojo choked out a mouthful of blood.

His upper body slid.

And he fell down.

All the sorcerers’ mouths went wide open. 

“That…” Yuuji froze.

On their screens was a horrifying scene of the strongest sorcerer being cut in half. Only the lower half of his body remained standing, while the upper half looked up at the sky blankly.

Sukuna had grasped the World Cutting Slash.

Although it normally should’ve taken five turns of the dharma wheel to fully breach limitless, Sukuna already held some understanding of this technique. Coupled with his deep knowledge and experience as the King of Curses and some tinkering done to the cursed object by Kenjaku, the vessel was able to understand the World Cutting Slash with only four turns.

The strongest sorcerer’s bright blue eyes dimmed.

“SENSEI!!!!” all the students screamed.

“Yo! Satoru!”

Omake:

Sukuna: I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry

    I have to make an Imgur account to add this image. If it doesn't load try to use VPN. Please look at it, I worked hard making this meme.

    Also, shout out to L0nny_1125 (second comment) for correctly guessing what would happen in the previous chapter. ;)

    Again, I try to follow the rules of the JJK power system as best as I can, but I admit that Gojo vs Sukuna is too big-brain for me. I’m sorry if there are mistakes! I checked everything several times but honestly, the combination of Mahoraga + Limitless + Shrine + Domain Clash is too confusing lol. Why am I doing this to myself? Anyway, this is only a fanfic~

    About Yuta’s abilities. Since he won’t be able to use any copied techniques in canon, I think it’s fair if he has other skills in his arsenal~ He has been a sorcerer quite a while, so it’s not strange if he picked up other abilities. I also don’t think the manga has clarified whether the higher-ups know about his Domain Expansion. The boy was already placed in the special grade rank even before he awakened his Domain, so I think it’s fair to assume that he unlocked the ability during his stay in Africa. His Domain is also hard to understand lol. I’m assuming he can select the sure-hit attack target since Yuuji is safe when entering it in the manga.

Chapter Text

Right after Gojo Satoru was taken down, the God of Lightning, Kashimo Hajime, immediately entered the battleground. The rampaging King of Curses turned his attention to the new challenger, giving Ui Ui and Nitta a chance to teleport in and retrieve the fallen body of the strongest sorcerer. 

‘There’s so much blood,’ Nitta couldn’t help but think. He knew that he would need to deal with wounded people, but seeing Gojo being slashed into two was not something he had ever expected to see. He quickly used his cursed technique to stop the wound from deteriorating further, but he didn’t know whether that would be enough. The next second, Ui Ui activated his own technique and transported them back to their base.

Despite seeing the previous challenger being cut down in two, Hajime didn’t feel the slightest fear as he faced the King of Curses. Although he had witnessed this new form from the screens, seeing the curse with his own eyes was another matter entirely. While many might have flinched away from the four arms and the second mouth, Hajime knew that these extra appendages helped Sukuna to help many battles.

“Tell me, Sukuna,” Hajime said, “did you earn the title of the strongest, or were you simply born as such?”

Frustratingly, the King of Curses did not respond. How annoying. Hajime wished to challenge the being Kenjaku called the strongest, yet this one was merely a vessel that hosted him. Nevertheless, since Hajime had his chance, he would test his mettle against Sukuna. 

He brandished his Nyoi Staff at the King of Curses and immediately tried to strike. With only one hand left and the other three still in the process of healing, the ancient sorcerer had a slight edge against Sukuna. However, Hajime’s enhanced strikes did not manage to wound the curse. Although he had just finished a lengthy battle against Gojo, the King of Curses showed no sign of fatigue.

BANG!

With his remaining hand, the curse blocked the staff and yanked it away. Hajime let go of his weapon and opted to launch an upward kick. The King of Curses took a step back to dodge, but that just gave the sorcerer a chance to activate his Mythic Beast: Amber technique. Without hesitation, he fired off a sonic wave at the curse, which his opponent opted to tank.

Knowing that wouldn’t be enough, he followed it up with a blast of energy beam that the King of Curses dodged. Just when Hajime was about to land his punch, he realized the curse had regenerated his second arm.

BAM!

The massive fist struck Hajime’s face directly, sending flying him backward. While he was trapped in motion, the curse pointed his hand at him as the mouth in his stomach began to chant.

“Scale of the Dragon. Recoil. Twin Meteors.”

Hajime’s eyes widened.

“Dismantle.”

A massive unseen blade flew through the air. 

KCHINK!!!

The ancient sorcerer barely had the time to dodge and he was forced to sacrifice his right arm. Before he could gather himself, the curse already leaped closer and slammed punches into his torse.

“Ugh!” Hajime grunted at the force. The remaining two hands had recovered, too. Ignoring the pain, the sorcerer aimed his hands to launch another energy beam. However, he saw a massive net of Dismantle flying at him.

Deep within his new cage, Sukuna felt a strong tug at his soul. It wasn’t an escape route. He knew better than that. It was a call. A final request. A resonance of souls. He reached back.

There was a bright light, and Sukuna found himself standing on a grass field in the middle of a forest. Before him stood Kashimo Hajime with his back facing toward him. Oh, yeah. Sukuna had just killed him. 

“Sukuna,” Hajime said as he turned toward the King of Curses.

Instead of his vessel's massive form, Sukuna retained his appearance while he was housed within Yuuji. “Kashimo.”

“I was expecting I could put up a bit more fight,” Hajime said. “It was quite embarrassing.”

“You were fighting against me,” Sukuna replied flatly.

Hajime chuckled. “Spoken like the strongest.”

The two of them went silent for a moment. 

“Tell me, do you feel the same thing?” Hajime asked. “That deep loneliness.”

Sukuna didn’t answer.

Hajime didn’t let this stop him and continued, “Back then, in my era, many people came and challenged me. I slaughtered them one by one. Some demanded and asked why I was so heartless, and I wondered why they were so fragile. Do you feel the same?”

Sukuna went silent for a moment and then scoffed. “Solitude and loneliness. What human has never felt such a thing? We simply feel it more deeply because we are so different from the masses that we have a hard time understanding them and being understood. In exchange for our strength, we lose touch with those struggles and pain that help those who are weak to connect.”

“Are you saying I’m greedy because I’m so strong, yet I still seek that connection?” Hajime asked.

Sukuna lowered his gaze to look at the ground. “... No, I think that makes you human.”

Hajime’s eyes widened. In all his years of living, he had been called many things. Genius. Prodigy. The strongest. Powerful. Monster. Demon. Yet, he had never once been called that word… ‘human.’ How funny. 

“Heh,” Hajime chuckled. “Is that why you mince your souls into cursed objects?” Sukuna didn’t reply, yet Hajime got his answers. Then, the ancient sorcerer let out a laugh and grinned at the King of Curses. “Well, luckily for you. It seems, unlike me, you manage to find some fools who are attached to you. I don’t think they’ll stop before they get you back.”

At that moment the connection between them broke, and Sukuna was shoved back into his prison cell. In that dark depth, the King of Curses sighed. ‘I know.’

Kenjaku had planned this clash between the Jujutsu higher-ups and Okkotsu. After observing the fights in Shinjuku, he noticed that the special grade was missing. Of course, they would expect the curse user to use the chaos to take Tengen away from the Tombs of the Star. Besides Okkotsu, Kenjaku was sure that Tsukumo would also be stationed there. Although he was quite confident in his combat capabilities, he still preferred to use some tactics that would make his fights easier. 

Okkotsu was a bleeding heart, and it wasn’t difficult to draw the boy out. With his control over the Kamo clan, it wasn’t hard to convince those elders to capture the Kyoto students. The Zen’in clan, who had been slighted by Gojo and his group, also jumped into the fire. Now, that Okkotsu had used his Domain Expansion, he wouldn’t be able to use his cursed technique for a while, making him an easy target.

With that thought in mind, Kenjaku summoned the Giant Catfish to appear underneath the group of sorcerers. However, before those people could fall into the spirit’s stomach, a dragon shikigami suddenly flew out and took them away. Kenjaku immediately sent another cursed spirit toward the new sorcerer.

Ino Takuma yelped and tried to dodge away, but the cursed spirit was faster. Yet before it could land a hit on the man, another shikigami intervened. This one was familiar to Kenjaku. It was Garuda, Tsukumo’s shikigami. Just as his eyes widened, he suddenly noticed a presence behind him. He barely had a mili-second to take in a long flock of blond hair before a fist landed on his back.

BAM!!!!

The force of that fist sent Kenjaku flying to the ground. As he was falling, his brain worked fast to understand his situation. He had expected Tsukumo to be suspicious of the Kyoto students’ capture, and he had waited for her to be waiting nearby. Yet when he found no massive cursed energy signatures nearby except for Yuta, he thought the woman had opted to stay behind. 

“You’re not the only one with nifty cursed objects, you know,” Tsukumo grinned as she leaped toward him. Kenjaku barely had time to dodge as her foot slammed to the ground to create a massive crater.

Such a powerful hit! Even Gojo Satoru wouldn’t be able to cause that much damage without using his cursed technique. This had to be Tsukumo’s power! 

Kenjaku retaliated by summoning Ganesha, but Tsukumo quickly summoned her shikigami so she could kick it toward his cursed spirit. The ball flew straight toward the special grade and blasted it to pieces. The woman didn’t hang back and tried to get close to Kenjaku.

“My cursed technique,” Tsukumo said as she aimed her punch, “is mass!”

BANG!

Another fist landed on Kenjaku’s face. The force sent the curse user into the building and embedded him in the wall. Although Tsukumo’s strike was powerful, the damage was nothing he couldn’t heal. Mass, huh? What a pain in the ass technique.

“Gravity technique?” Yuki asked.

“That’s what Gojo-sensei guessed after observing Kenjaku with his Six Eyes,” Yuta replied. “Since that man didn’t use his other powers, he couldn’t get a good grasp of it, but he is sure it is something related to Gravity.”

As Yuki watched her opponent, she couldn’t help but feel peeved. This body-hopping bastard had three known techniques. Cursed spirit manipulation was already annoying enough, but Gravity was another tricky power. Their cursed techniques weren’t suited to fight with each other, so…

“Domain Expansion.”

As the two Domains clashed, both Kenjaku and Tsukumo grinned at each other. The man seemed a bit surprised that her barrier didn’t immediately fall apart under the attack, but the woman simply got closer. Yuta had warned her about the weird open-barrier Domain that Kenjaku could do. Although she wasn’t as good as Gojo at this, she had the help of Tengen, who was still a master at barriers. Despite disliking the old tree, she couldn’t deny that they were quite a good teacher and helped her grasp how to change her barrier condition quickly.

The woman threw another punch, but Kenjaku dodged by dropping his body lower and responded with a low punch. The other sidestepped and tried to kick him, but he blocked it and managed to land a punch on her. Yuki quickly recovered and grabbed Garuda, and used it as a whip.

Kenjaku had to bend backward to avoid the shikigami, but this gave the woman a chance to land a kick. Instead of falling back, the man grabbed her leg to bury his fist in her stomach. She raised her knee in retaliation, but the angle was too awkward, so he could easily dodge it. The curse user rolled sideways and landed another enhanced kick on her stomach.

Although this wouldn’t be enough to break her Domain, open-barrier Domains still had an advantage over regular Domains. Despite her best attempts, Yuki was still new at this. Her concentration was broken, and it weakened her barrier enough that Kenjaku’s Domain won the clash. 

CRASH!

Yuki’s Domain fell apart, and Kenjaku’s sure-hit attack landed on her. A massive amount of gravity suddenly pressed upon the woman and flattened her to the ground. However, before Kenjaku could feel satisfied with his victory, a bullet made out of blood suddenly flew toward him. It was a trick he came up with at the last second, but Kenjaku unraveled the stitches on his forehead to negate most of the damage from piercing blood.

“Tch!” Choso frowned.

Kenjaku expected his son to stay back and continue assaulting him with ranged attacks. Unexpectedly, the Death Painting decided to leap closer and dove straight toward his Domain.

What?

Kenjaku couldn’t understand this suicidal move at all. Yet, the answer quickly presented itself when Okkotsu Yuta jumped back into the fight. 

“Domain Expansion.”

Another Domain snapped back and forced Kenjaku’s Domain into another clash. Like Yuki, the other special-grade sorcerer also mastered a way to flip his barrier’s condition to weather open-barrier Domains.

Kenjaku’s eyes widened. ‘How? His cursed technique should still be burnt out!’

“You want to learn how to recover your burnt-out technique?” Sukuna asked with squinted eyes.

“Is that… Impossible?” Yuta asked. He had heard the conversation between Gojo and Sukuna alongside Itadori and knew that if he could master that skill then it would help them during future fights.

Sukuna crossed his arms and didn’t say a thing for a moment. “This is a very risky technique that perhaps only Gojo and I are crazy enough to attempt. One wrong move and you’ll be brain dead, and it’s not as if I can show it to you.”

Yuta sighed. He knew it was a long shot. Although he easily received the special grade rank, he was nowhere near the genius like his teacher. “So it is impossible, huh?”

Seeing his disappointment, Sukuna closed his eyes and let out a breath. After another second of pause, he said, “Technically, there is a way for me to show you, but that will require you to allow me access to your brain.”

“Eh?” Yuta blinked.

Sukuna pointed his finger at his own head. “I can use Cleave to try to carefully attack that specific part of your brain that contains your cursed technique, but this is a very delicate and dangerous process. I usually try to use my technique at maximum output instead of minimum so this will be the first time for me. You will need to put a lot of trust in me if you want to give this a chance.”

“Sure,” Yuta replied.

Hearing his fast response, Sukuna made a disgruntled look that seemed to scream ‘Are you an idiot?’

Yuta couldn’t help but laugh. “Gojo-sensei trusts you a lot, so I know I can put my faith in you, Sukuna-san.”

Sukuna clicked his tongue. “You think too highly of that man. Fine. But I’ll only do it once, so pay attention.” The man placed his two hands on his temple, and Yuta closed his eyes. “Remember that you can only do this once per day. Don’t try any more than that.”

Despite trying his best to understand, Yuta still couldn’t refresh his burnt-out technique in the heat of battle. He still required full concentration to dare to use this risky move, but thanks to Sukuna, Yuta could quickly jump back into battle against Kenjaku.

Ino also decided to help and join the battle. Now Kenjaku had to face multiple opponents while handling a Domain clash. Although Tsukumo was heavily wounded by the Domain sure-hit attack, the woman was quite durable and was already picking herself up. Yuta, Choso, and Ino decided to cover for her while she healed herself with the Reverse Cursed Technique.

It was obvious that the man couldn’t handle this many enemies. Although he tried to defend himself, the constant assault from the four sorcerers and Rika was simply too much for the man. In the end, it was Tsukumo who landed the final punch that damaged the man enough that his Domain fell apart.

“Take that!” Tsukumo screamed.

Before the man could recover, Yuta already got close to him to swing his katana. With one decisive slash, he cut off the curse user’s head. Despite no longer having access to the lungs, the head that fell still retains the ability to talk. The ancient curse user looked up at them. “How disappointing. So this is how my thousand-year quest ends. But don’t be so happy yet… I’ve left you a big gift.” Kenjaku grinned. “Who knows? Maybe your teacher has had a taste.”

Yuta wasn’t sure what the man was talking about, but it was connected to the situation at Shinjuku. Before he could demand more, Geto’s stolen body disappeared as numerous cursed spirits began to go on a rampage. Yuta immediately activated his sure-hit attacks while the other sorcerers tried to help. It took a lot of work, but eventually, all the curses were exorcised, and Yuta could safely drop his Domain.

‘I hope the others are safe,’ Yuta thought as he looked toward the direction of Shinjuku.

Shoko was used to seeing the dead bodies of her comrades. As one of the rare individuals who could output her Reverse Cursed Technique, her fate as a sorcerer had been decided since the beginning. She had prepared herself to see a lot of blood and gore. She had prepared herself to see the dead eyes of her friends and allies. She had prepared herself to sink her hands into their guts and chest cavity. 

Yet, she never expected that she had to see how Satoru looked on her dissection table. That guy had always been someone who seemed invincible. His power had literally prevented everything from touching him unless he wanted to. Yet the so-called strongest sorcerer was lying on the cold table before her. She felt a prickle in her eyes, but she refused to shed her tears. 

Satoru wasn’t dead yet.

Shoko didn’t know what the fuck this ridiculous guy had done, but she could feel a faint heartbeat. It was very weak, and she had mistakenly believed he had died when she got him. But it was there. Now, all she could do was to knit his body back and hope her friend could crawl his way back from death’s grasp. 

‘Don’t you fucking dare leave me too, idiot.’

With those thoughts, Shoko began meticulously stitching back the two broken halves of Gojo Satoru. Despite the procedure, the man didn’t react at all while his eyes remained closed.

With Kashimo down, the rest of the sorcerers began to launch their attacks on the King of Curses. Although the students wanted to grieve for their teacher, they knew they had to stop the curse. Yuuji was so shocked that he couldn’t feel much except numbness. He had just witnessed his teacher, the person he believed to be invincible, being cut in half by Sukuna, someone who he considered his family. Now, he had to be the one fighting him because only he could strip away Sukuna from his vessel.

The first round of people who entered the fight with Yuuji was Uraume and Hakari. Despite not wanting to attack their master, Uraume refused to let Kenjaku’s puppet use Sukuna any further. The three of them entered the fight, falling on top of a massive iceberg that Uraume sent hurtling down like sharp projectiles. Before it could reach the curse, a small cursed spirit in the shape of a bird flew toward Sukuna and gave him a cursed tool.

Yuuji wasn’t sure what it was, but Uraume recognized it, “Kamutoke! Be careful that weapon can use lightning!”

Just as Uraume predicted, the King of Curses raised his hand and summoned a bolt of lightning that destroyed the majority of the ice. The three sorcerers still managed to land safely, and Hakari quickly released his Domain.

“Domain Expansion!”

Since Sukuna was still exhausted from his battle against Gojo, the curse could not unleash his own Domain. Thus, Hakari decided to create the usual barrier where it was harder to break from the inside. The King of Curses didn’t show any surprise as a wave of information was dumped straight into his mind. Instead, he immediately targeted Hakari, knowing that he was the biggest threat at this moment. 

The third year threw the ball, but the curse easily dodged the shutter doors. The preview that showed up was red, and the first scenario they got was the Transit Card Riichi, which had the lowest chance of hitting a Jackpot. Hakari clicked his tongue.

“Frost Calm!” Uraume tried to stop the curse from moving, but the other simply used Dismatle to destroy the ice. Yuuji also tried to get in the way, but the man easily caught his fist and slammed one of his secondary hands to slam Cleave into him.

“Ugh!” Yuuji had to take a step back to heal, but luckily, the King of Curses turned his attention to Hakari.

“You know we never have a chance to spar before,” Hakari joked as he tried to block the fast strikes from the curse. Although Hakari was a master at hand-to-hand, he was not as good as Gojo, and dealing with an opponent with four arms was challenging for anyone.

Yuki failed to pass through the station gate on time.

Everything reset.

The second scenario was the Potty Emergency Riichi.

This time, the three of them attacked the King of Curses simultaneously. Despite being outnumbered, Sukuna kept up with the three opponents. Yuuji tried to attack the curse’s feet, but the man jumped up and used the momentum to kick Uraume away. The curse followed it up by grabbing Hakari and then using him to take down Yuuji and throwing the two of them at the monk. While the three of them scrambled to get up, the King of Curses already threw a Dismatle at them.

Although Yuuji tried to push Hakari away, the older teen still got hit. 

“I’m fine! Keep your eyes on Sukuna!” Hakari gritted out as he forced himself to keep standing.

Unlike Uraume and Yuuji, who had mastered the Reverse Cursed Technique, the third year could only heal during Jackpot. As if heaven was laughing at their misfortune, Hiro failed to reach Shin-Yurigaoka station.

The moment the scenario reset again, Hakari immediately threw the ball to show gold doors. “Ha! Ha! Finally!”

They finally got the Friday Night Final Train Riichi, which had the highest chance of getting the Jackpot. Yuuji and Uraume tried to push back against the King of Curses since Hakari couldn’t move as fast due to his wounds. 

“Icefall.”

Uraume sent several pillars of ice into the air which fell apart into several shards. Those spikes fell to the ground and surrounded the King of Curses. Like before, it couldn’t stop the man for long due to Cleave, but it gave Yuuji a chance to land his first solid hit. The attack stunned the curse for a second, but he quickly kicked the teen away.

‘Shit, I failed to use Soul Dismatle.’ Yuuji frowned as he caught himself. Despite training under Sukuna, the boy still failed to perform his Shrine technique reliably. He usually had to be in the zone or land a Black Flash before those powers listened to his call.

The moment Sukuna released himself from the ice, he used Kamutoke on Uraume and immobilized the curse user. Then, he turned his attention to Hakari. The older teen tried to defend himself as best as he could while he waited for the scenario to reach its conclusion. Just as the curse was about to break his defense, the Riichi resulted in Yume boarding the train.

‘What a shitty time to have bad luck.’ That was Hakari’s last thought before Sukuna sent Cleave into him and then slammed a fist into his temple to knock him out. The force was so powerful that he got sent flying into the building far away. 

Yuuji couldn’t pay much attention to his senior and could only hope Ui Ui managed to get him out. Finally recovering from Kamutoke’s attack, Uraume quickly covered Sukuna with cold, icy wind that covered his sight. A second later, a massive elephant suddenly dropped above the King of Curses and forced him to use his arms to stop it from crushing him. However, he quickly turned one of his palms around and sent Cleave to cut into the shikigami.

Fushiguro quickly called back his summon, but Junpei came in with his Shark. Yuuji jumped up on the large fish and dove straight toward Sukuna. At the same time, the King of Curses easily stopped the fish. It gave Yuuji a chance to get behind the man and slammed his fist into his back. The other retaliated by whirling around and slamming two of his fists into the teen, sending the boy flying. Before he could crash into a wall, Junpei appeared just in time to catch him with his jellyfish. 

In the meantime, Sukuna had raised Kamutoke and summoned several powerful lightning that crashed on the buildings around them. With his other hand, he sent numerous Dismatle that broke down the building into pieces. The attacks sent rubbles flying everywhere and caused Fushiguro. The falling obstacle gave the King of Curses a chance to get close to Uraume. The monk spat out a mouthful of blood but placed their hands on the curse’s arms. Ice began to spread around his body, but he merely placed his other hand on his body and, with a clever use of Cleave, destroyed the ice before it could truly harm him. He then used his leg to kick the Uraume.

“Ugh!” Uraume coughed out another mouthful of blood.

The curse user knew that this trick wouldn’t work against their master. Their plan was never to deal a significant blow to the curse. Instead of forcing more ice to form on the other’s body, the monk created a shard of ice and aimed it at the hand holding Kamutoke. Although the King of Curses managed to stop the spread of ice, it still lowered his reaction time, allowing the projectile to land. 

CRACK!

The ice shard landed and destroyed the limb. Junpei quickly noticed the opening and ordered his Jellyfish to grab the cursed tool and take it away. Yuuji and Fushiguro quickly covered their friend’s retreat and tried to attack Sukuna. However, despite losing a hand, the curse kept up with their barrage of strikes. 

BANG! BANG!

With quick hits, the King of Curses pummeled Yuuji in the temple while Fushiguro received a blow to the stomach. Instead of hitting them more, the curse leaped back and aimed his hand at the fleeing Junpei, who was holding Kamutoke.

“Scale of the Dragon. Recoil. Twin Meteors.”

Both Yuuji and Fushiguro could only look toward their friend in horror.

“Dismantle.”

A massive unseen blade flew at a fast speed toward the teen. Luckily, instead of cutting the boy into two, Uraume pushed the kid away at the last second. Yet the interference caused the monk to lose their right arm and leg. Junpei was quite shocked but he couldn’t stop and quickly picked up the fallen ally. While Sukuna was focused on the enemy before him, he failed to notice the small Jellyfish shikigami floating high above his head. 

TAK!

Although the King of Curses was planning to unleash his power, he was distracted when he felt a dangerous presence above him. He barely had time to look up to see Hana gazing down at him while holding the light trumpet.

“Maximum Output: Jacob’s Ladder!”

The radiant pillar of light descended from the sky and hit the King of Curses directly. Yuuji and Fushiguro didn’t hesitate to jump in to land a combo on the stunned curse. While the other boy kept up the attack, the pink-haired teen crouched down and focused his cursed energy into his fist before he slammed it on the opponent’s chest.

“Wake up, Sukuna!”

It was at that moment that Yuuji had a strange vision. He stood before Sukuna in a dark realm without light, but he could still perceive the man. Instead of appearing in his true form, the curse was wearing Yuuji’s face, though, he was donning a light-colored kimono with a black edge and a black scarf.

“That’s enough, brat,” Sukuna said, yet he did not meet the other’s eyes. “You’ve been attacking the barrier between me and the vessel all this time. Although you can eventually strip me away, it will take too long because of Kenjaku’s seals. It would be better if you directly hit my soul instead. No matter how strong the vessel is, it still requires my soul and power to operate. If you destroy me, then your fight will quickly end.”

Yuuji’s eyes widened.

“Do it, Itadori Yuuji.”

He couldn’t breathe.

“Kill me and end this cycle of curses.”

Omake:

Sukuna: This is how it is fated to end.
Notes:

    Is Gojo still alive?~ ;)

    Kenjaku ends up dying quicker than I expected. Oh well. In the manga, he’s already about to be defeated by Yuki, but with Yuta and the other's help, there is no way he can win if they Jump Kaisen him lmao. He might be smart, but he’s not Sukuna. As for the cursed object that hides Yuki’s presence, just assume it’s a gift from Tengen lol. Kenjaku has been popping out many OP-cursed tools; it’s time the sorcerers have one as well!

    You know, I actually planned Kenjaku to be the final boss in this fic at first, but then I thought, wouldn’t it be funnier if it was Sukuna lol? So yeah, this is what you get XD I mean, it’s definitely not because I wanna see you guys squirm over the Go/Jo scene. Not at all. I promise. (っ>з>)♪♬

Chapter Text

Despite landing a Maximum Output: Jacob’s Ladder on the King of Curses, the seals Kenjaku put on the curse were too strong. While the attack was able to stun the enemy for a moment, it didn’t take long for him to recover. He slammed both Yuuji and Fushiguro away and turned his attention to Hana, who was trying to fly away. 

BAM!

With a punch to the ground, he sent numerous rubbles into the air. Within seconds, the King of Curses climbed up this makeshift ladder to chase after the fleeing sorcerer. The girl’s eyes widened as she saw the massive figure leaping toward her. Angel was screaming at her to get away.

‘Too fast! He’s too fast!’ That was all Hana could think of.

Luckily, right before the hit could reach her, a large Jellyfish appeared to tank the attack. The force still sent her falling, but Junpei quickly caught her, and they rode away on the Shark. The curse wanted to pursue after the two teens, but before he could move, a sword stabbed him through his chest.

The King of Curses glanced back at Maki, who was wielding the Soul Splitting Katana, and kicked her away. The girl managed to block the attack, and the two began to fight in the sky. Despite fighting bare-handed against a sharp blade, the curse was able to mitigate damage by using Cleave to protect his palm. Eventually, he was able to tightly grasp the sword and throw the teen straight down at a building below them. While he could continue his chase after Hana, the King of Curses opted to pursue the falling Maki.

“Dismantle.”

Numerous invisible slashes began to fly toward the teen. While Maki could’ve dodged this normally, she was still immobilized after falling. Fortunately, Kusakabe got between them and used his Simple Domain to prevent further injuries. Sukuna landed heavily on the rooftop and immediately turned to block an attack from Nanami.

“Tch,” the ex-salaryman quickly retreated just as the curse launched a retaliatory strike. He knew he was no match against this opponent in close combat.

‘This guy can still fight like this after being stabbed through the heart,’ Kusakabe thought tiredly as he looked at the sluggishly bleeding wound on the curse’s chest.

Maki, who finally got up on her feet, continued her assault. This time, it was three against one. After the death of Mai, the girl had become even stronger with the progression of her Heavenly Restriction. She was the closest person who could keep up with Sukuna with pure physical abilities. However, dealing with four arms was still tricky, so Kusakabe and Nanami helped cover her openings. Their best bet was to strike the same wound again, which hopefully would make the curse stop moving for a long period. 

The King of Curses knew that fighting these three simultaneously was not good. Nanami might only be a Grade One sorcerer, but his technique allowed him to make weak points forcefully. On the other hand, Maki was the closest person who could keep up with him, and Kusakabe was a tricky opponent with his powerful Simple Domain. 

As if reading his thoughts, Kusakabe opened his Simple Domain again and expanded his range to force Sukuna to be within its radius. With one fast sword draw, the man rained down numerous slashes on the curse. It managed to cut him everywhere, which allowed the other two sorcerers to land their own hits.

Instead of retaliating, Sukuna raised his foot and slammed it down. The impact broke the roof and caused them to fall into the building. The sudden change of battleground shocked the sorcerers, which gave the curse a chance to punch Kusakabe into the opposite wall and send him flying outside. 

The King of Curses then used the air as footing and turned his attention to Nanami. The sorcerer tried to defend himself, but the full force of the curse was too much for the Grade One. With one of his secondary arms, he landed a Cleave into the man’s torso. Before Sukuna could inflict a killing move, a massive virtual hand showed up to push the curse away. 

“Oi, oi, Larue!” Miguel shouted as he entered the building. “I thought we were going to enter after nobody else can fight anymore!”

“Didn’t you say the more the merrier?” Larue shouted back.

Unwilling to be kept down, the King of Curses sent Dismantle which wounded Larue and dispelled the virtual hand. Maki and Miguel quickly started their assault with the others supporting them. Although Miguel did not have a Heavenly Restriction, his cursed technique, Prayer Song, lets him buff his physical capabilities even outside a Domain. This allowed the man to keep up with the punishing speed of Sukuna and Maki.

Knowing that he couldn’t fight against these two for long, the King of Curses opted to use the environment to his benefit. He leaped outside the broken windows and forced them to chase after him. Unlike Maki, who could jump in the air, Miguel was limited to the ground. This broke the sorcerers’ defenses and allowed him to land a punch on the man. Before the curse could land more blows, Larue quickly saved his ally.

Maki saw an opening and slashed the King of Curses. Although she aimed to take off his two hands, her blade could only dismember one. Yet her victory was short-lived. In exchange for his missing hand, the King of Curses landed a critical hit on the teen.

Black Flash!

The attack caused Maki to fall, and Sukuna turned his attention to the two foreign sorcerers inside the building. Before they could get pummeled to death, Yuuji and Megumi entered the battle again together. The two teens fearlessly engaged with the King of Curses. Fushiguro summoned Divine Dog Totality while Yuuji tried to land more hits that could weaken the seals. Despite his ally being down, Larue still decided to stay longer and helped the two boys fight the curse. With his cursed technique, he could still stay away while using his virtual hand to keep Sukuna pinned for short moments. 

Annoyed at the constant interruption, the King of Curses kicked Divine Dog at Fushiguro and sent Dismantles toward Yuuji. He then leaped toward Larue and landed another critical hit.

Black Flash!!

Fushiguro quickly appeared to distract the curse so he wouldn’t continue attacking the downed sorcerer. Despite being hit with Dismantle, Yuuji also got to his feet thanks to his Reverse Cursed Technique. While the two teens engaged with Sukuna, the foreign sorcerers slowly made their retreat. Unfortunately, the curse knew he couldn’t let Larue walk away, and he sent Dismantle at them.

CLANG!

Instead of chopping the men into two, Maki arrived just in time to block the technique. The three students tried to start another round of assault on the curse. Yet before they could reach him, Sukuna broke another floor inside the building and engaged with Maki one-on-one. The girl was forced to defend herself as they fought in mid-air. Although she tried her best, the previous attack had left its mark on her and made her slow down. This weakness finally let Sukuna land his third critical hit.

Black Flash!!!

Fuck.

Sukuna’s output and power were increasing.

Knowing they couldn’t let this continue, Fushiguro summoned Rabbit Escape in an attempt to cover the curse’s sight. Yuuji attempted to land another punch on the King of Curses, but the man blocked his fist and threw him toward the wall. Some of the rabbits quickly moved to cushion the boy’s fall while the rest tried to attack Sukuna. With a flick of his hand, he sent Dismantle at the shikigami.

SPLASH!!

The white-furred creatures exploded into splashes of blood. Before Fushiguro could summon another shikigami, the curse already got close to him and punched the teen in the gut.

Black Flash!!!!

The red eyes widened when he saw shadows covering his fist. It seemed the boy was using his own shadow as a makeshift shield to prevent him from reducing damage. Instead of moving away, Fushiguro grasped the curse’s hand tightly and prevented him from dodging when Yuuji arrived to punch the man in the face. While Fushiguro could not move for some time, he still maintained his connection to Divine Dog and ordered the summon to help Yuuji deal with the King of Curses.

As the two of them fought hand-to-hand, Larue finally decided to give his parting attack to Sukuna and forced his attention on him instead of the teen.

“Cutie Honey!”

Although the King of Curses knew he had to keep his eyes on the boy, the curse could only let his sight be locked on the foreign sorcerer who was being held up by Miguel. At the edge of his vision, he could feel Yuuji powering up. It was the start of a turning point. With gritted teeth and a clenched fist, the pink-haired boy finally released his first critical hit.

Black Flash!

The force of that punch destroyed the wall behind the curse. As the sparks of black flash flickered in the air, Yuuji’s golden eye shifted and changed as a ring appeared in his irises. Just as Sukuna had hoped, Yuuji had finally awakened.

The vessel of the King of Curses knew what was coming. The barrage of Black Flashes the kid would land on him. Yet despite preparing himself, he still couldn’t stop the teen from landing punches after punches on him. 

Black Flash!

This phenomenon should not be something one could call at will, yet this boy-

Black Flash!!

Itadori Yuuji was perhaps one of the few people blessed by the black sparks. The curse kicked the boy away, but the teen used a nearby pillar as footing and then used his Shrine technique to pull out a block of granite from the pillar. He then threw it at the man, who chopped it to pieces with Dismantle. Instead of shying away from the cuts, the boy kept moving forward and grasped his arm. With his other hand, he aimed a punch toward the side of the curse’s torso.

Black Flash!!!

The vessel expected Ino to show up and send his shikigami at this moment, yet nobody came. However, that one second of distraction allowed Yuuji to land another hit.

Black Flash!!

The blow sent the King of Curses stumbling outside. Before he could gather himself, a Shark suddenly showed up to attack him from behind. Although the curse quickly took it down with a well-placed Cleave, Yuuji used the opening to deal another punch.

Black Flash!

The curse grabbed the boy’s face and sent Cleave into his body, but the teen did not let that stop him. With another swing of his arm, he punched the vessel in the face.

Black Flash!!

This time, the King of Curses glanced up, expecting Nanami to attack from above. Like before, nobody came. Instead, there was Divine Dog, who sunk his claws into his back. The curse tried to push the shikigami off him, but that merely gave the boy another opening to exploit.

Black Flash!!!

The force of that strike sent the vessel onto the second floor and into the wall. Previously, he could’ve healed his wound, but the multiple black flashes that landed on him limited his output. Knowing that there could only be one thing that he could do, the King of Curses made a mudra. Yet, at that moment, another person entered the battleground.

“With this treasure, I summon,” Fushiguro said, making a gesture with his two hands and slowly approaching the two fighters. “Eight-Handled Sword Divergent Sila Divine General Mahoraga.”

A cocoon began to emerge behind the black-haired teen while Yuuji quickly leaped back. As Mahoraga ripped its way out of its bindings, Fushiguro grinned, “Let’s see how you handle this at your current state.”

The infamous shikigami finally revealed itself and immediately struck its summoner. Yuuji quickly caught his unconscious friend and ran away. Although heavily weakened, the King of Curses was still the most dangerous, so the shikigami fully turned its attention to Sukuna. The vessel gazed impassively at the summon.

BANG!

The shikigami teleported in front of the King of Curses and slammed down a blade on his head. Unfortunately, the curse easily blocked it with one hand, and it retaliated by kicking the Shikigami away. While the original Sukuna had decided to play around with the summon, the vessel had no interest in testing its mettle. He knew how to defeat this creature. 

“You’re planning on summoning Mahoraga?” Kusakabe asked before the fight between Gojo and Sukuna. “That’s the most powerful Shikigami in your technique, right? Have you tamed it?” The man felt hope blossoming in his chest. If they could get that powerful creature as a fighter, then-

Fushiguro shook his head. “No, but I can still pit it against Sukuna. However, that will put me out of battle since it will attack me.”

That made sense. Kusakabe continued, “I don’t think that’s a bad idea if it can take down Sukuna-”

“No way,” Fushiguro stated.

“Absolutely not,” Yuuji said.

“Impossible,” Gojo added.

“Eh? What’s with this lack of faith?” Kusakabe somehow felt bad for the infamous Shikigami that loved to kill its masters.

“Sukuna told me he can easily handle Mahoraga with only fifteen fingers,” Yuuji replied. 

Fushiguro added, “If he’s going to be fully incarnated with nineteen fingers worth of power, then there is no way Mahoraga can stand a chance, but we can still use it for one thing-”

As Yuuji took Fushiguro away from the center of battle, he could feel the aura of death emanating from behind him. With one glance, he could see something appearing from the sky. It should be the Malevolent Shrine yet it looked much more grotesque than its previous appearance. Before he could think further, he was suddenly teleported away into another location. He appeared right beside Todo and Ui Ui who was examining the ruined city before them.

Just as they had expected, the vessel had unleashed Sukuna’s Domain. Just a few meters behind Yuuji’s position, everything was turned to dust. Trees, buildings, cars. All living and dead things were minced to bits and dust. As if that destruction wasn’t enough, the King of Curses finally summoned the dreaded Divine Flame. Like a divine judgment, that fire rose into the sky and expanded outward and melted everything within its path.

Yuuji’s eyes widened. 

He knew Sukuna was strong, but to see this level of destruction with his own eyes was something else. Now, he could somewhat understand why the man always told him to stay away.

“I’m dangerous,” Sukuna said.

Yuuji could understand why Sukuna was so afraid of himself. To wield this level of destructive power was a heavy burden. He doubted that many could resist its siren call. To destroy everything in your path and to kill everyone who dared to stand against you.

“Do it, Itadori Yuuji, kill me.”

Perhaps it would be wiser if they killed Sukuna, but… Yuuji refused. He had made a promise to him. ‘I’ll bring you back.’

“Are you ready, brother?” Todo asked.

Yuuji gave Fushiguro to Ui Ui and nodded. “Yeah.”

Satoru woke up in a strange airport and was immediately greeted by a familiar face. 

“Hey!” Suguru said while grinning down at him.

“Blegh!” Satoru replied. What the hell was this? A hallucination made by Kenjaku? He tried to remember the last thing he had seen. Oh yeah. He detonated Hollow Purple in an attempt to destroy the cursed tool and stopped Mahoraga from adapting to Limitless. It did work, but something terrible still happened. The white-haired man leaned back and sighed. “You’re kidding me! This sucks!”

“What a rude thing to say after seeing someone’s face,” Suguru said as he sat down beside him.

Satoru clicked his tongue as he examined his surroundings. The airport was very empty. Except for him and Suguru, he could see the deceased Amanai Riko and Kuroi Misato sitting on the table far away. Behind him, he could register the familiar presence of his late junior, Haibara Yu.

“What the hell kind of bullshit afterlife is this?” Satoru groused. “I’ve always told my students that all sorcerers die alone.”

“Such harsh words, who let you become a teacher again?” Suguru replied.

“It’s Yaga,” Satoru said.

Haibara laughed behind them. “But you were definitely the one who forced him to make you one.”

Satoru scoffed as he crossed his arms. “Those elders should be grateful that I graced my presence at school and helped them raise good sorcerers.”

“I’m pretty sure they would disagree with your opinion,” Suguru replied. “Still, I’m quite surprised you have the patience to raise students.”

“What are you talking about? I’m perfect.”

Suguru sighed. “See, with that kind of attitude, it’s a wonder how those kids didn’t lose their minds.”

“You know, Gojo-senpai, we’ve always thought you’re a pretty self-centered person,” Haibara said.

Satoru grimaced at the slight against his honor and character. A lot of people told him he had a bad personality, but he didn’t expect to get attacked in this ‘afterlife.’

Haibara ignored his senior’s sour face and continued, “It always feels like you are just here because you get a kick out of it. It doesn’t seem like you care a lot about protecting people or keeping the sorcery going.” 

“What? Are you saying I’ve become a better person? That I’ve changed?” Satoru asked.

“No,” Haibara said.

“Absolutely not,” Suguru added.

Satoru choked on his own spit. What the fuck? Why was his hallucination so mean to him? He was pretty sure he didn’t have masochistic tendencies.

“Hmmm, but I guess you’ve changed slightly. Maybe?” Haibara said. “I mean, you’re still an egotistical, arrogant, and self-centered person.”

“Oi, oi, oi, since when is this insult Gojo Satoru time?” Satoru asked testily.

“What I think Haibara wants to say,” Suguru continued, “is that you’re not as distant, Satoru.”

Satoru stopped the next complaint he wanted to say. 

“Don’t think I never noticed,” Suguru said, “even back then when we were still friends. There’s this gulf between the two of us. It wasn’t just a matter of power, though that certainly increased the distance between us later.”

Satoru didn’t say anything.

Suguru continued, “It was as if you were standing high in the clouds as you examined the regular people on the ground. Untouchable and unknowable.”

“Is it because of your god-complex?” Haibara asked. 

“Haibara, I’m going to smack you if you don’t stop talking,” Satoru warned his junior, but the other merely laughed.

“But you’re not like that anymore,” Suguru said. “I mean, you’re still annoying and insufferable, but I can’t no longer see that ice within you.” The man grinned. “Is this because of your new best friend?”

“Che, I doubt he’ll like hearing you calling him that,” Satoru said.

“I’ve to admit I’m jealous,” Suguru replied, “are you replacing me, Satoru?”

“Shut up!” Satoru retorted. “You know damn well the two of you aren’t the same. It’s not as if I can ever forget you, idiot. You two would’ve gotten along well with your old men’s acts. I can just imagine the two of you grumbling about everything from the weather to the elders. You even have the same face, look!”

Satoru pointed at the disgusted expression Suguru was making.

“Maybe this is the common look that anyone would wear when they have to deal with you,” Suguru replied. Satoru responded by trying to hit Suguru, but the other easily blocked his fist. “So, what are you going to do next?”

Satoru stopped trying to pummel his old friend and returned to lying on the bench. “Ugh, what else? I have to go back. It’s not as if I can leave them. I mean, if I let myself get killed, that guy will just blame himself forever. He keeps trying to have this mean and dangerous look, but he’s all soft on the inside. Nobody is going to buy that.”

“I’m pretty sure I remember you wanted to kill him the first time you met,” Suguru replied.

Satoru ignored that response and continued, “Also, with the Jujutsu society being revealed to the public, things are going to get tough and chaotic. I can’t leave my students to handle those crises. They’re great sorcerers, but they’re just kids.”

“How did you even survive that attack, Gojo-senpai?” Haibara pipped up. “Didn’t it cut you into two? Like a fish.”

This time, Satoru hit the other directly but still replied, “It was just a hunch. Whenever Sukuna talked about using the World Cutting Slash, he kept gesturing at his torso. Although I managed to destroy that cursed tool, I still felt something was off. So in the last moment, I tried to reinforce my cursed energy and kept the shape of my soul somewhat.”

“Since when can you do that?” Suguru asked with a doubtful expression.

“I’m a genius, remember!” Satoru replied with a proud look. Seeing the dubious expressions on the two people, the white-haired man groaned. “Fine, it wasn’t easy. Six Eyes could see almost anything, but souls are annoying shits. I can see that they exist, but I can’t grasp how to see their shapes. I kept bugging Sukuna about it, but it seemed he couldn’t explain how to allow others to see it.”

“Well, I assume it’s an innate talent,” Suguru replied. “It’s not as if you can help others learn how to use Limitless.”

“Kind of, but not really?” Satoru scratched his head. “I doubt many people can learn this ability, but it’s more feasible since everyone has a soul. My Six Eyes just help me see them better. Still, I don’t think I can gain this skill without a life-or-death situation. When I saw the vessel make that gesture, I knew the World Cutting Slash was coming. Instead of trying to dodge, I tried to see the technique coming toward me. It’s a bit like that moment when I learned the Reverse Cursed Technique. They just clicked, somehow. I could see it then. As that invisible blade slashed through my body and soul.”

Snap!

Satoru snapped his fingers. “Like that.”

Based on the two blank expressions, they still couldn’t get it.

“You’re really a bad teacher.” Suguru sighed.

“It’s good there’s Sukuna over there,” Haibara replied.

“Shut up!” Satoru shook his fists in protest. “It’s hard, okay! Even I, a genius, admit it!”

Suguru ignored his tantrum and continued, “Luckily, the others reached you in time. I doubt you can maintain that state for long.”

“Yeah, it’s up to Shoko to knit my body back,” Satoru replied, “I’m not like Sukuna, who can whip out soul healing like it’s nothing.”

Suguru smiled as he saw the white-haired man stand up. “You’re leaving then?”

Satoru grinned down at his friend. “Yeah, sorry. I can’t stay yet. There are still things I need to do.”

Suguru returned the gesture. “Okay, then I expect you to return after you are old and wrinkly. I’ll then laugh at your face since you will lose that beloved baby’s smooth skin of yours.”

“Excuse you! I’ll age like fine wine, and I’ll still look amazing even when I’m old!” Satoru replied as he walked away.

“Bye Gojo-senpai!” Haibara shouted as he waved his hand. “Tell Nanami to stay healthy too!”

Satoru waved back as he continued heading north.

As the dust and smoke from Malevolent Shrine dissipated, the King of Curses faced his next challengers. Seeing Todo and Yuuji approaching him, the curse knew he was dealing with difficult opponents. Although he tried to send Dismantle at the older teen, the other merely slapped his Vibraslap and forced Sukuna to tank his own technique. 

Todo’s cursed technique was simple to understand yet challenging to counter. No matter how smart you were, you would get overwhelmed with the sheer amount of swaps the teen could do. With Yuuji as his companion, it would be a deadly duo against the vessel that could not allow the real Sukuna to escape from his prison.

The two sorcerers rushed straight toward the curse, but before they could reach him, Todo activated his technique again. Sukuna was swapped with Yuuji which made his back vulnerable to the young teen. The boy took this opening and slammed a fist on him. Before he could recover, the older teen kicked the curse in the face the next second.

Sukuna immediately hit his opponents and sent them reeling back. Yet his attacks were cut short when their position was switched again. He managed to block the next hit from Yuuji and grasped his face. Before he could Cleave his face into pieces, Todo swapped them and landed his own kick on the curse. 

The King of Curses whirled and retaliated, but Todo suddenly changed to Yuuji, who was much smaller and crouching. With quick speed, he slammed another fist into the vessel’s chest.

Black Flash!

The King of Curses knew he could only use his Domain to stop this barrage of attacks. He made his mudra again and just as he was about to release it again, he felt a dangerous presence. It was Okkotsu Yuta.

“Domain Expansion.”

Despite the curse releasing his Domain again, he still had to deal with Yuta, Yuuji, and Todo. Even though Yuta’s barrier was nowhere near as polished as Gojo's, he was still quite strong and could handle the weakened King of Curses’ Domain. While the curse could handle the boy alone, he was accompanied by Yuuji and Todo. The three of them quickly launched an assault. With Todo’s technique, even if the King of Curses still had three hands left, he couldn’t handle the barrage of attacks and swaps from the sorcerer. It didn’t take long for the curse to lose his concentration and fail to maintain his Domain.

The vessel tried to use the Hollow Wicker Basket, but that only gave him several extra seconds before it also broke under the barrage of attacks. When the last layer of defense dropped, Yuta’s sure-hit attack activated.

“Maximum Output: Jacob’s Ladder!”

Another hit weakened the seals Kenjaku had placed on the real Sukuna. Before Yuta had arrived on the battlefield, he took the time to visit the others. While he wanted to jump into battle quickly, he knew he had to understand the situation first.

“Satoru is still recovering,” Ieri said.

“The others can’t fight anymore. Do you think you can buy some time?” Yaga asked.

“Of course.” Before Yuta could leave the base, an unknown girl with blonde hair stopped him. 

“You’re that copycat, right?” the girl asked. “You need to copy my power!”

“Eh?” Yuta blinked.

“I’m too weak, so I can’t enter the fight again, but you can!” the girl insisted. “Angel’s power allows me to strip away cursed technique. It’s extremely effective against that vessel, but I can’t use my full power because of my state.”

“But you’ll need to let Rika-chan eat a part of you,” Yuta protested. The girl already lost one arm and a leg; there was no way he could take more of her.

“I can safely extract her ribs quickly,” Ieri interrupted. “If we manage to get Sukuna back, then that guy can easily heal the damage afterward.”

Seeing everyone agreeing to the plan, Yuta could only follow and copy Jacob’s Ladder. Although he felt bad for taking more from Hana, Angel’s cursed technique was definitely effective. The three kept pressuring the King of Curses, but before, just as they thought they were winning this fight. The curse suddenly placed his palm on Yuta’s chest.

“Cleave.”

As invisible blades cut through his torso, Yuta’s Domain collapsed. Shit. Did the vessel just forcefully restore his burnt-out technique? The curse tried to keep attacking the fallen sorcerer, but Todo quickly switched their places. Rika then used this chance to take the wounded teen to a safe distance so he could heal. 

Todo and Yuuji tried to keep attacking the King of Curses despite missing an ally. However, a solid kick to the older teen managed to give the curse an opening to land a lethal move.

“Scale of the Dragon. Recoil. Twin Meteors.”

Yuuji could only blankly stare as Sukuna pointed his hand straight at his chest.

“Dismantle.”

The slash that cut through the world flew free and hit the pink-haired boy straight in his heart.

A mouthful of blood came out of his mouth.

Omake:

Sukuna: MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP!
Notes:

     

    Te he~

    The final fight feels a bit too similar to the manga, so I was trying to think of other ways to shake things up. This is what I came up with~

    But honestly, why do I keep doing this to myself tho? I hate fight scenes! Writing this gauntlet is tiring, I wonder how Gege does it in manga form lmao.

Chapter Text

Yuuji was cut. Like Gojo, the World Cutting Slash had split the boy into two. Although the King of Curses’ output was reduced after the chain of Black Flashes, the teen had landed on him. The short distance between them still made the invisible blade very lethal. As the pink-haired boy fell down, Todo quickly swapped their position so he could attack the curse. This was bad. Although Boogie Woogie was a great technique, it required at least two participants to be effective. Now with only him alone, the older teen could not keep up with Sukuna for long. 

However, before the sorcerer could lose all hope, an unexpected backup showed up. Like a flash of lightning, Gojo Satoru landed on the battlefield and slammed his fist into the King of Curses’s back. 

Gojo said, “Yo, it’s time for round two.” 

When Satoru finally returned from the land of death, he was greeted by Shoko looking down on him. He grinned at her and said, “Miss me?”

His oldest friend wrinkled her nose and replied, “Just go back there, idiot; your students are fighting Sukuna.”

Satoru wanted to tease Shoko after seeing her red-rimmed eyes, but he knew he had more important matters to address first. His friend had done a great job at healing him, and he quickly left the base to confront the rampaging King of Curses. When he arrived, he saw the grizzly scene of Yuuji’s lying on the ground bleeding. He was cut in two. Satoru’s eyes widened.

Without thinking further, the sorcerer interrupted the battle between Todo and the vessel. Placing all of his rage and desperation, he landed a heavy hit on the King of Curses. Piece of shit. Fuck. He should’ve returned faster. Now, his student was dying, if not already dead. 

“Take Yuuji away!” Satoru ordered Todo as he engaged with his opponent.

The sorcerer wondered what Sukuna had to be feeling right now. To see his own hand and technique hurting so many people he cared about. That fucking Kenjaku. If that guy wasn’t dead yet, Satoru would be taking his time torturing that brain before he finally killed him. 

Both the King of Curses and Satoru were not in their best condition. The vessel had gotten hit with a chain of Black Flashes that greatly lowered his power. On the other hand, despite being healed by Shoko, the sorcerer still had not fully recovered from the abuse of the CT burnt-out recovery skill.

While the two strongest sorcerers clashed once more, Todo managed to bring the wounded Yuuji to Ui Ui. Nitta was also there, and the boy couldn’t help but bite his lip at the repeat of the previous horrible scene. Gojo Satoru somehow found a way back, but he was a one-of-a-kind genius. On the other hand, Itadori Yuuji was merely a young sorcerer. If he still had Sukuna within him, the curse could’ve kept him alive. 

“Pain Killer.”

After stabilizing the teen, Ui Ui took Nitta and Yuuji back to the base. Shoko frowned deeply when she saw another victim of the dreaded World Cutting Slash. They quickly placed the boy on the operating table, but all of them knew that it wasn’t up to them. Although the woman could heal the flesh, it wasn’t just a matter of knitting the two broken parts together. Shoko was still not sure what Satoru had done, but that man had performed some sort of trick to dodge the claws of death. 

Could Yuuji do the same? As Shoko began to examine the condition of her patient, she realized how much more horrible the teen’s situation was compared to Satoru's. Although the two of them were cut at the torso, the man was bisected at a much lower spot. Yuuji, on the other hand, got hit directly in his heart.

‘Impossible! There’s no way he can survive…’ That was all Shoko could think of, yet she desperately tried to heal the student. Despite her logic telling her it was pointless, the woman kept trying. It was her duty. She was useless at fighting, so the least she could do was to keep fighting until her patients stopped. 

Back on the battlefield, Satoru and the King of Curses kept exchanging blows. The two of them were aware that going into another Domain clash would not be ideal for either of them. The sorcerer tried to knee the man in the gut, but the curse blocked it and used his secondary limbs to grab his leg. 

The vessel tried to throw him to a wall, but Satoru adjusted himself and quickly fired Red. Since his output was limited, the technique couldn’t do much damage against the sturdy opponent. The man landed on the pillar and used Blue to drag the curse closer. The other retaliated by throwing Dismantle at the sorcerer.

Satoru dodged the invisible blades and immediately launched himself toward the curse. Instead of hitting the opponent directly, the sorcerer used his technique to break the ground under his feet. The sudden impact barely destabilized the King of Curses, but that was enough for the man to land a hit. The other responded by kicking the sorcerer away and pointing his hand at him.

“Scale of the Dragon. Recoil. Twin Meteors.”

Satoru’s Six Eyes widened.

“Dismantle.”

With a twist of his body, the sorcerer dodged the invisible blade coming toward him. After his second brush with death, Satoru’s abilities had increased in some aspect. Besides better healing, his Six Eyes could now easily see Sukuna’s slashes. Although he couldn’t guarantee to be able to dodge all of them, at least in terms of the World Cutting Slash, the required chanting gave the man more room to dodge.

While Satoru was able to dodge the lethal attack, the vessel was not disturbed and rushed toward the other. With a powerful swing, he landed a critical hit on the man.

Black Flash!

Shit. Satoru gritted his teeth and leaped away. This was not the time to allow Sukuna to recover. Before the two could engage in another close combat, two figures appeared to join in the battle. 

TAK!

With another slap to the vibraslap, Satoru switched to Yuta, who was running behind the King of Curses. Seeing his chance, the man launched another Red at the curse. Yuta, who managed to dodge the beam, quickly swung his katana at the vessel. Unfortunately, the curse managed to block the blade with his bare hand and grabbed the kid’s face. Before Sukuna could use Cleave again, Todo slapped the vibraslap and switched their place. 

TAK!

This time, the older teen and Satoru landed a double punch at the vessel. Although it was a solid hit, neither of them could actually target the barrier between the vessel and Sukuna. All they were doing was damaging the body, and if this continued, it either ended with the King of Curses turning the tides in his favor or Satoru killing him.

Fuck.

They needed Yuuji if they wanted to bring back Sukuna.

“Focus,” Sukuna reprimanded as he stood before the boy.

Yuuji tensed at the harsh tone and clenched his eyes tighter. Sukuna had been forcing the boy to meditate for almost an hour now, and he couldn’t understand the point. Wouldn’t it be better if they trained instead? The teen still couldn’t consistently use the Shrine technique despite manifesting it once before. Despite knowing he would likely get rebuked, Yuuji couldn’t help but ask, “... Isn’t it better if I just train? I already understand Reverse Cursed Technique…”

Sukuna clicked his tongue and flicked the teen’s forehead. “Didn’t I say that I want you to learn soul healing?”

Yuuji whined as he rubbed his sore forehead. “Do I even need it?”

“I doubt you can grasp how to output it, but the least you can do is to learn how to do it to yourself,” Sukuna replied.

“I thought Reverse Cursed Technique is good enough? Didn’t Gojo-sensei say he can even regrow his limbs?” Yuuji protested. He was nowhere near that level, but he could certainly use Reverse Cursed Technique better than Shrine. He couldn’t understand why the man was so insistent that he grasped this difficult skill when he couldn’t reliably use Dismantle.

Sukuna narrowed his eyes, and his hand twitched. Yuuji prepared himself to get hit in the head and closed his eyes tightly, but instead of feeling pain, he felt the man taking a seat beside him.

“Do you think that just because you’re sturdier than others, you can get by without learning how to heal?” Sukuna asked.

“No, it’s just… aren’t you going to be there too? I mean, you can heal all of us easily, right?” Yuuji scratched his cheek.

Sukuna sighed. “You need to stop depending on me so much. There may come a time when I won’t be by your side to drag you out of trouble.”

Yuuji felt that was unlikely, considering the two were a package deal. Yet, he was quickly reminded of when Kenjaku locked Sukuna within him. “I still don’t think I can get it this fast.”

“Considering I’ve used soul healing often when controlling you, your body should be more than familiar with it,” Sukuna replied testily. 

“I know, I know, but it’s hard, okay.”

Sukuna pinched the bridge of his nose in exasperation. “You are already able to see the shape of a soul. What you need to do next is to combine that skill with Reverse Cursed Technique.”

Yuuji blinked.

“Both soul and body reflect each other. When one is destroyed, you can use the other to recover the damage. Let’s say that the process of using the Reverse Cursed Technique is like putting together a blank jigsaw puzzle. If the damage is minor, you only have to deal with a small number of pieces, so placing them in the right spots is easy. On the other hand, lethal damage is similar to needing to piece together half of the puzzle. It’s one thing if you have unlimited time, but when you are that wounded, you are racing against death.”

Yuuji nodded.

“One way to make piecing those pieces together easier is by painting a picture on that jigsaw puzzle. If you know the true shape of your whole soul, you can easily fill in the missing pieces. That’s why I’ve been telling you to examine the shape of your soul by meditating. You need to engrave your true essence into your memory.”

“I see.” Yuuji nodded again.

Sukuna shot him a disgusted look, clearly seeing through the boy’s attempt to look like he understood. After giving another forehead flick, the man said, “Just keep meditating, and don’t you dare use this time to daydream about Jennifer Lawrence.”

Yuuji covered his forehead as he shouted, “Ugh! Why do you keep bringing that up, seriously?!”

Why am I dreaming that? How strange. Yeah. Sukuna did nag me a lot that day. Nothing I could say changed his mind. I can’t understand. Sukuna is always there anyway. Why can’t I depend on him a bit? I already crammed so much Jujutsu theory into my brain that it felt like my head was about to explode. Ugh. I’m tired. Can’t I just sleep a bit more? Sukuna can handle things for a while, right?

Yeah.

Let me.

Just…

Sleep.

.

.

.

.

.

Ugh. I can’t sleep. I feel like I’m forgetting something important. What is it? I’m pretty sure Fushiguro didn’t ask me on cat-sitting duty today. Kugisaki also can’t go on a shopping spree yet. There’s also no new batch of movies I can watch with Junpei. Uuugh. Sensei is still whining about not getting enough sweets for his daily intake, but Ijichi-san promised to bring him some soon. Hmmm. Oh yeah, I’m going to spar with Yuta-senpai tomorrow. I think Maki is itching to fight Sukuna again. Hmm. Someone needs to keep an eye on those two, or they’re going to be as bad as that time when Sensei and Sukuna were fighting.

Oh no. Have I forgotten a homework from Sukuna? There’s that weird meditation thing, but I’m sure I have already done that. Does he expect to meditate while I’m sleeping? That’s not feasible, right? Yeah, yeah. I need to remember the shape of my soul. So I can…

Huh?

So I can what?

“Yuuji.”

Yuuji blinked as he turned around to meet his grandpa's stern gaze. There was a bundle of flowers in his hands. “What?”

“Have you been ignoring me this whole time?” the old man shook his withered hand in anger.

“I wasn’t!” Yuuji lied.

The other didn’t buy it at all. “Ha! You dare to lie to me! Tell me! What did I just tell you?”

Yuuji’s eyes went upwards as he tried to remember what they had been discussing. “That… um…”

Grandpa sighed deeply as he shook his head. “Kids these days. Let me repeat then; it’s about your parents.”

Yuuji blinked. The face of a woman with stitches flashed in his mind. “Oh… them. It’s fine, Grandpa. I know already.” He turned around and stuffed the flower into the vase.

Grandpa clicked his tongue at the gesture. “Didn’t I tell you to stop buying those? They’re a waste of money!”

Yuuji tidied the flowers so they would look nice. “It’s fine. The room will look better with some color, right?”

The older man harrumphed. “I’m already old, and I’ve seen enough. Instead of wasting time here, how about you go and do your club activities?”

“Ugh. Haven’t I already told you that they’re done at five!” Yuuji retorted. “Anyway! It’s not as if they’re that important.”

Grandpa turned around on his bed and put his right hand as a cushion. “Che, idiot kid, youths like you should focus on living your life! Don’t get so hung up over dying people!”

“You’re one to talk! Aren’t you the one who told me to help people!” Yuuji replied, crossing his arms.

“Is that so! What are you doing now, then!” Grandpa shouted back.

“I-” Yuuji paused. Oh yeah. What was he doing now, anyway? He had just left his school to visit Grandpa at the hospital. No. That wasn’t it. Numerous scenes flash through his mind. A city was destroyed. Gojo fighting. Gojo dying. Flames and death. A massive figure with four arms. Red eyes. Sukuna-!

The boy took a sharp breath. 

“Have you remembered now?” Grandpa asked.

“... Yeah.” Yuuji rubbed his eyes. “... You know Grandpa. I don’t think I’ve ever told you that I’m thankful that you took care of me. I must be a handful child for someone as old as you.”

“Stupid, kid,” Grandpa said, still not looking back. “You’re my grandson.”

“Heh.” Yuuji smiled wobbly. “You don’t need to worry, you know. I… I was afraid at first. With you gone, I didn’t have anyone else. It would be just me. Alone. But… I’m not anymore. Did you know how wild things get after your death? Heh. I don’t think anyone will believe me if I tell them. Or maybe they will after sensei uploaded that video. But what I want to say is that I’m not alone. I have my teacher and my friends. Oh! I actually technically have siblings! It’s a bit complicated, but they’re good. There’s also… Sukuna.”

“... Is that so?”

Yuuji nodded. “Yeah. He was a bit scary at first, you know, with those blood and skulls around him. But he’s actually very nice. He reminds me a lot of you. Well, that makes sense; we’re kind of related. He likes to pretend to be mean and dangerous. Well, he’s dangerous, but he won’t hurt you unless you give him a reason. And he’s been taking care of me this whole time, so I’m very grateful. I’m actually indebted to a lot of people.” The boy laughed. “You told me to help people, but it feels like I’m the one being helped constantly. So that’s why I need to go back and help him now.”

Yuuji awkwardly hugged his grandpa from behind and approached the door. Before he could leave, the old man said, “You’re a strong kid, Yuuji.” 

When the teen turned around, the bed was empty. The boy smiled. “Thanks, Grandpa.” With newfound confidence, he opened the door and stepped outside.

Although it was three against one, the King of Curses became even more ruthless after landing that Black Flash. While Satoru tried to cover for the kids, the vessel’s powerful attack and three hands were proving to be quite a challenge. It was as if he could order the students to fall back. After that critical hit, Satoru’s wounds were aggravated somewhat. As if things weren’t bad enough, the curse managed to land a powerful blow on Todo. 

Black Flash!!

Fuck.

With that second Black Flash, the King of Curses had recovered his Reverse Cursed Technique. Without hesitation, the vessel immediately recovered his burnt-out technique and performed a mudra.

“Domain Expansion!”

Satoru immediately activated his own Domain to clash against the King of Curses’. Unfortunately, the sorcerer was not in a condition to win a Domain clash against Sukuna in his current state. Still, he tried his damnedest to fight back. Ignoring the blood pouring out of his nostrils, he engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the vessel.

Todo and Yuta still continued to support him despite the threat of getting hit with a sure-hit attack should either Domain win. Instead of attacking Satoru, the King of Curses focused his attention on Todo. With several quick strikes, the curse managed to break the vibraslap, rendering his technique useless. Things went from bad to worse when the curse healed his fourth hand. Now, with a full set of arms, the King of Curses began to push back.

Bit by bit. Malevolent Shrine suppressed Unlimited Void. Yet, at that pivotal moment, someone leaped into the fight quickly. Satoru’s eyes widened when he saw Yuuji falling down. Just before the boy could land, he raised his two hands and made a sign.

“Domain Expansion.”

A third Domain expanded in Shinjuku. The sudden addition of a new barrier disturbed the balance between Malevolent Shrine and Unlimited Void. Satoru ensured his Domain would not clash with Yuuji’s, and together, the two of them pushed back against the King of Curses’.

Knowing that Yuuji posed the most danger against him, the curse turned his full attention to the boy. The other sorcerers quickly backed up the young teen. The four of them then engaged in a close combat. The King of Curses put up a solid defense against his four enemies. However, he made a mistake when he believed Boogie Woogie was completely dead. Although the teen could no longer use vibraslap, the ball and the box of wood still remained. 

TAK!

With a sharp tap, the teen switched Satoru with Yuuji. The curse who was expecting a much taller opponent, got a solid hit in his stomach. Satoru and Yuta quickly followed it up with their own strikes. These rapid attacks broke the curse’s concentration and allowed Yuuji’s and Satoru’s Domains to suppress Malevolent Shrine. The moment the King of Curses’ Domain broke, the white-haired man immediately dismissed Unlimited Void. Allowing Yuuji’s Domain to take hold.

Yuuji blinked when he suddenly found himself standing in the middle of the woods. After examining his surroundings, he could not find the other sorcerers anywhere. This place wasn’t his Domain either. He would know that immediately if it were. 

“Weird,” Yuuji muttered.

Before he could get more confused, he noticed a small child standing not far away from him. Yuuji immediately approached the other and was surprised to see the kid with pink hair. When the teen got close, the boy turned around, and four red eyes stared at him.

“Sukuna?” Yuuji asked.

Instead of replying, the boy turned around again and began walking away.

“Hold on!” Yuuji had no choice but to follow the kid. All questions thrown at him were ignored, and when he tried to touch the boy, his hand passed through his body. The teen pursed his mouth. Was this the weird phenomenon Sukuna had told him? The one where sorcerers’ souls resonated with each other?

Sukuna took him to a small, broken hut. Inside was a small, frail woman with disheveled hair. With dead eyes, she said, “You’re still here? I thought I told you to scram.”

Sukuna didn’t respond.

“You-!” The woman coughed harshly. “You are a bane! A curse! If I hadn’t birthed you, then I-!” She tried to throw a small stone at the boy, but Sukuna easily caught it with one of his secondary hands. Oh. Yuuji hadn’t seen it because of the size of his clothing. “Look at you! What kind of human has four eyes and arms? You must be a monster! A demon from hell!!!”

Sukuna remained impassive at this barrage of insults.

“If-If you hadn’t been born…” the woman wheezed. “I wouldn’t have been exiled from the village…. Curse you…. Curse you…” 

As the boy turned away from the crying woman, the scene fell apart, and Yuuji was teleported away. This time, it was dark. With only the moon as lighting, it was quite hard to see the surroundings. Luckily, it wasn’t hard for Yuuji to find Sukuna’s cursed energy. He found the boy being manhandled by an unknown man.

Yuuji tried to hit the man, but his fist passed through them like before. With gritted teeth, he could only watch as the adult harassed the small boy.

“So this is the demon, huh?” the man looked down at Sukuna, who gazed at him with flat eyes. “All I see is a weird kid. But I admit, your cursed energy is quite powerful and dark despite your age.”

The boy didn’t reply. 

“What? Are you scared?” the man shook the kid harshly. “You know those villagers paid me to get rid of you. They call you a demon. Hah! What do backwater peasants know about curses? Luckily for them, I was bored, so I decided to take a look. Hunting curses gets a bit tiring and dangerous. So sometimes I want easier prey. I mean. With that appearance, you can be considered one already, right?” the man unsheathed his katana and pointed it at Sukuna. 

Despite knowing it was pointless, Yuuji still tried to stop him. “Stop that!”

Sukuna didn’t flinch at the sharp blade near his face and slowly raised his hand. “Dismantle.”

With one fluid movement, the man’s head was chopped into several pieces. The headless body swayed for several seconds before falling harshly to the ground. Sukuna examined his work with bored eyes. Before he could leave, his stomach suddenly made a rumbling sound. The boy gave a considering look at the corpse before him and raised his hand again. This time, he chopped the body into smaller pieces.

Yuuji could only watch in horror as Sukuna slowly skinned the human corpse and prepared a campfire. Although he knew the man had been planning to kill the boy, seeing the kid planning to eat the other still made him sick. Covering his mouth with his hand, he turned his face away. It was like an eternity of waiting. The teen could only stiffly sit on the ground, back facing the kid, as he waited for the boy to stop eating. 

Eventually, the sound of gnawing stopped, and Sukuna burped. “Decent.”

With those words, the scene shifted again. It wasn’t hard for Yuuji to find Sukuna in this new environment. The curse was no longer a boy and was now a man. His stature was the same as the vessel that it made the teen mistakenly believe he had returned to the battlefield for a second. Yet, as the man continued to walk slowly while ignoring him, Yuuji slowly relaxed.

These scenes had to be Sukuna’s past. Back in the Heian era. The man had never divulged his history to the teen. Whenever Yuuji asked, Sukuna would only tell him the same reply. “I killed. I ate. I fought. I destroyed.” It was only now that the teen fully understood.

Their peaceful walk was interrupted by the sudden appearance of a group of figures. Based on their cursed energies, they were sorcerers or curse users. Yuuji stiffened on his spot while Sukuna boredly gazed at his challengers.

“Ryoumen Sukuna! In the name of the Fujiwara clan, we will execute you for all the wickedness and chaos you’ve caused!” a man shouted.

Sukuna scratched his ear. “How about you just attack instead of these meaningless barks?”

The high-ranking sorcerers’ faces went purple due to the complete lack of respect. Clearly, they were not used to anyone acting like this toward them.

“Kill him!”

Together as one, all the sorcerers leaped with the aim of killing. Despite their confidence, the battle was a one-sided bloodbath. Sukuna barely even moved as he cut down all his opponents. Those that remained quickly realized their situation and tried to run. Yet none managed to escape Dismantle.

Surrounded by blood and gore, the King of Curses sighed. “What a bore.”

The world shifted, and the scene changed once more. Yuuji reappeared in the middle of a war. It was nothing like any battleground he had entered. Even Shinjuku could not compare. He could see numerous powerful sorcerers fighting. Yet their enemy was only one person. The King of Curses. 

Standing on top of a mountain of corpses, the curse wielded both Kamutoke and Hiten as he fought back against endless waves of sorcerers. Despite being outnumbered, Sukuna did not look worried at all. In fact, a wild grin was permanently plastered on his face as he sliced and stabbed many sorcerers down. 

Yuuji didn’t dare to get close and could only remain standing blankly. Despite his distance, blood began to spread on the ground and eventually reached his feet. He looked down, and everything shifted again.

The teen reappeared inside a massive traditional Japanese house. Besides Sukuna, there were also two more people inside the room. He assumed one of them was Uraume due to their white hair. The other seemed to be a noble based on his clothes.

“Come, Sukuna,” the noble said, “Aren’t you bored already? How many clans have you taken down in Japan? Sugawara and Abe are gone, and I doubt Fujiwara can last much longer. I doubt you can find anymore interesting challengers in this era. If you agree to my plan, I can revive you in the future.”

“I’ve told you that I’m not interested, Kenjaku,” Sukuna replied.

Kenjaku pouted at the direct rejection. “Really? Is there something else you want to do here? I’m very sure everyone knows of your might and fear your name.”

Sukuna sighed. “If you are so insistent then just teach me how to turn myself into cursed objects. Should I change my mind, I’ll do so promptly.”

Kenjaku slapped his fan on his palm. “Of course not! We need to make a Binding Vow first!” 

“I refuse.”

Kenjaku choked on his own spit. “You do know that a Binding Vow is necessary to protect both of our interests, right? If you don’t have this agreement, after you get turned into cursed objects, I can do whatever I want to you.”

Uraume frowned at that threat.

“Do as you wish.” Sukuna took a sip of his wine.

The other two looked very surprised at that answer. Kenjaku tilted his head. “Are you sure? I can think of several ways I can play with the remains of the King of Curses.”

“I do not care,” Sukuna replied as he yawned. “If I die, then I die. I’ve no attachment to this life.”

Kenjaku huffed as he slapped his fan to his palm again. “How very Buddhist of you. Are you sure you don’t want to make a Binding Vow with me?”

Sukuna narrowed his eyes. “Either teach me how to do it or never step foot inside my estate again.”

Kenjaku grumbled. “Ugh. How unreasonable. Fine.”

Yuuji blinked, and the scene shifted again. He was now standing on top of a lake of blood, and before him stood Sukuna. Instead of his true form, the man was wearing the appearance he usually took when wearing Yuuji’s body.

“Do you understand now?” Sukuna asked. “I’m a monster. I couldn’t remember much before, but now everything is clear. All those deaths and destructions in the Heian era are my responsibilities. I took numerous lives and consumed countless human flesh. I destroyed many sorcerer clans and squashed their lives under my feet. All because I wished to experience the thrill of battle. I did not feel anything as I committed those evil acts. You have personally experienced the destruction and deaths I could cause.”

Yuuji clenched his fists as he met those red eyes.

“I’ll tell you this once more,” Sukuna said. “Itadori Yuuji, kill me.”

Omake:

Sukuna: It was me all along...
Notes:

    Gege doesn’t explain how a three-domain clash works so this is my take! Gege also doesn’t give Sukuna any backstory so this is mine! Technically, this is SIkuna’s backstory lol. ;p

    FYI: SIkuna reincarnated in the heian era. However he couldn't remember anything about his previous life. He's slightly better than OG Sukuna but he's still very apathetic toward everything. The only time he felt alive was during battles so that was why he fought everyone. Now after he met Yuuji, the memories returned but he mistakenly believed he was just reincarnated.

Chapter Text

Sukuna remembered everything now. When he woke up within Yuuji, he mistakenly believed himself to be an unfortunate soul who got shoved into the King of Curses role. Yet, that wasn’t quite the case. He had actually been reincarnated first as the human Sukuna during the Heian era. Bereaved of the knowledge from his first life, he stumbled his way into the same mistakes and evils the original did. 

Why had he done those horrible acts? 

There was no grand reason. He wasn’t like Geto, who wanted to kill all non-sorcerers because he wanted to erase cursed spirits. He was also not motivated by a crazy plan like Kenjaku, who wanted to evolve humanity further. No, the only reason he did them was because he could. Even now, he still couldn’t remember much of his first life, so he couldn’t be sure of his character in that peaceful world. However, he could easily remember the sheer apathy he felt when he walked the world as Sukuna. 

In his eyes, nothing mattered. Born in a turbulent time with a lack of resources, Sukuna had been constantly tortured by hunger. His mother had been weak and frail and could not provide meals for herself, let alone a child like Sukuna. After birthing him, she had been ousted from the village. They believed the babe was a demon. Not that Sukuna could blame them. Four arms, four eyes, and a mouth in the stomach. In a world where curses existed, such a thing wasn’t that farfetched. So, the two were forced to live in the wilderness. Without the support of other villagers, it didn’t take long for his weak mother to become even more sick. 

Yet, despite constantly cursing him, that woman still fed him. Sukuna grew up thin and malnourished, but he was alive. He wondered why she kept giving him her share of meager food when the hatred in her voice and eyes was honest and real. He understood. A being like Sukuna was a curse. It would’ve been better for everyone if he had passed away alongside his twin. Unfortunately, he had always been hard to kill. 

Cursed energy and technique came as easily as breathing to Sukuna. Despite not having the handy knowledge from his previous life, he had grasped his innate power during his childhood. He honed his Dismantle and Cleave by hunting wild creatures. As his mother got weaker, Sukuna became more independent. At the age of four, he had already brought home some meat for his mother. She never thanked him, and he never expected her to.

At the age of six, his mother finally died. Not from the lack of food or illness; no, she had been killed by an unknown man. He didn’t know why that person broke into a small rundown hut, and he never tried to find out. Sukuna had been outside hunting, and he returned to see him hunching over her prone form. He was raping her dead body. Sukuna didn’t even think before he Dismantled the man to pieces. He had gazed at her dead eyes for a long time before he decided to bury her. As for the man, Sukuna decided to eat him. It was meat, and he was hungry. It was the start of his cannibalistic habit.

For him, humans and animals weren’t different. Although humans loved to put themselves above beasts, Sukuna couldn’t differentiate the two that much. Unlike in the modern era, the Heian people never bothered much over human rights or kindness. All they had in their mind was their own survival. The nobles had much grander dreams. Riches and fame were within their grasp, and so they clashed with each other in the meaningless fight of politics and power. Yet, in the end, it was all the same. Beasts eating each other, like an ouroboros of death and suffering. 

Without his mother chaining him down to that hut, Sukuna began to wander. There wasn’t any direction or destination. He just kept walking. Sometimes, he would stop at a village or city and observe the people. The number one thing that interested him was sorcerers. He knew that he had to learn more to master his technique, so he tried to gather intelligence. Back then, the sorcerer clans were even more strict at keeping knowledge of Jujutsu from outsiders. Only those from the clan or who had pledged their loyalty were allowed to learn. Luckily, Sukuna was a genius. He could easily understand Jujutsu from observation. When that wasn’t enough, he would challenge a sorcerer to a duel. Sometimes, they would have sorcerer’s texts on their body, and he would read them.

It wasn’t intentional, but his infamy quickly grew. Sukuna only wanted to learn more about Jujutsu, which was the only thing that kept his mind from going dead due to sheer apathy. Many strong sorcerers started to challenge him during his teenage years, and it wasn’t long before he found out about the joy of battle. Only when facing a powerful opponent that pushed him to his limits, did Sukuna feel any shred of happiness or excitement. And so he kept fighting and killing. He never tried to pursue a sorcerer with the intent to kill, but if one should present themselves, he would not hold back and use his full power. Unfortunately, that always ended up with the other being cut up to pieces. Sukuna’s technique was always lethal.

Yet in that never-ending quest to reach that high, it ended up with him challenging the biggest sorcerer clans in the Heian era. Abe, Fujiwara, and Sugawara tried to take him down yet not even their most formidable warriors could defeat Sukuna. He truly was the strongest. Some people might be elated at holding this title, but unlike the original, Sukuna did not care about fame or pride. He only fought because he wanted to. 

One silver lining that he could be happy about was the fact he never developed the original’s level of arrogance and his tendencies to demean everything. While he would not hesitate to kill anyone, he had never felt that it was wrong for anyone to fight for their lives. Even if they were meek and weak, they still had a right to try to survive. Of course, he knew this belief would not comfort those he had ruthlessly cut down.

With these memories returning, Sukuna no longer had the luxury of deluding himself. Back then, he could blame all of his dark tendencies on the original, but now he could not. It was all his fault. He was the one who still became the King of Curses despite being born as the human Sukuna. He was the true danger that should be exterminated.

“Itadori Yuuji, kill me.”

Sukuna saw the teen clenched his fists and wondered whether the boy wanted to deck him. He wouldn’t stop the kid. After what he had done, he would be more than deserving to get beaten by Yuuji.

However, instead of swinging his fist, Yuuji only sighed deeply. “Are you done?”

Sukuna blinked.

“If you are done, then I’ve something I want to show you.” Yuuji raised his right hand in an offering. 

Sukuna stared at it for a second before grasping it.

The scene shifted.

The two found themselves standing on a train station. Ah. Sukuna felt Yuuji tugging his hand. With a smile, the kid said, “Come on, Sukuna. Let’s go.”

Together they headed out to explore the empty hometown. After exiting the station, the two come across the iconic statue. Yuuji pointed at it excitedly, “Look it’s the demon’s sword dance statue!”

“It was originally a ritual to offer comfort to ancestral spirits, right?” Sukuna said as the trivia he had learned from his previous life returned. “But it was later used for soldiers who would depart for battle or after their return.”

“You sure know a lot, Sukuna,” Yuuji replied. “I thought only locals knew it.”

“I’ve been in your body. Although I try not to pry, some of your memories still seep into mine.”

“Wait! Are you telling me you have access to my dark history!” Yuuji exclaimed in horror.

“You want me to bring up one?” Sukuna said with a smirk.

“Stop! Shut up! No!” Yuuji made an X sign with his hands. Seeing the widening smirk, the boy whirled away and hastened his steps. “Anyway! Let’s continue our trip!”

As they explored Kitakami City, Yuuji began to talk about his childhood. Sukuna already knew about it after reading the manga, but he still listened closely to the tale. They eventually went to the park, where the boy noticed a bunch of flowers growing on the ground.

“Oh! It’s a Morning Glory!” Yuuji said as he crouched beside the plant.

“It’s actually Hydrangea,” Sukuna replied.

“Wait, are you into flowers?” Yuuji asked with wide eyes.

“A bit. I believe Fushiguro is more familiar with this topic,” Sukuna said. “Do you know the meaning of each flower? Morning Glory symbolizes ephemeral beauty, while Hydrangea is associated with gratitude and apology. Still, all of these meanings vary by region and time, so there’s no need to put that much thought into it. I thought you would know about it a bit, considering how often you brought flowers for your grandfather.”

“Eh, I only picked the ones with the colors that I like,” Yuuji admitted embarrassedly. “It was usually the shopkeeper that gave suggestions.”

“That’s fine, too,” Sukuna replied. “I doubt many people ponder much over flower meanings. I’m sure your grandfather appreciated the gifts.”

Yuuji gave the man a teasing smile. “Is that what you and Fushiguro talk about? Geeking out about flowers? How cute!” 

Sukuna kicked the boy, so he fell on his butt. “Better than gushing over an actress that will never look your way.”

“Enough with Jennifer Lawrence, already!”

They finally left the flowers after that conversation and went to a small stream. Numerous crayfish swam underneath the water while Yuuji crouched on the edge. Offering a small and crude fishing pole, the kid said, “Here, have you ever caught crayfish before?”

“Not really.” Sukuna took the tool and crouched beside the boy. “Back then, I preferred to hunt bigger animals. My technique is very good for hunting, so I never had problems finding food after I had mastered it.”

“Well, I’m a master at catching crayfish!” Yuuji grinned. “Let’s see which one of us caught the biggest!”

Despite Yuuji’s bragging, the kid ended up capturing a smaller one. As the two crayfish showed their dominance at each other, Sukuna said, “It seems I’m the winner.”

“No way, you got an American crayfish! Mine is Japanese, which is rarer!” Yuuji defended.

“Spoken like a sore loser,” Sukuna shot back. “It’s too bad we can’t eat them.”

“No!” Yuuji stretched out his hands to cover the two crayfish. “I won’t let you eat Naruto and Sasuke!”

Sukuna’s left eye twitched at the ridiculous act. “You already named them? Which one is which? Wait, no, you do know they don’t exist, right?”

“They’re real to me!” Yuuji insisted.

Sukuna sighed and dragged the boy away from the stream. “Come on, let’s just go.”

Their next destination was the store department. As Yuuji spoke about his hometown, there was this deep melancholy within his tone. Many things changed as time passed and few were for the better. The lively town became emptier as people moved away. The familiar mom-and-pop shops closed as more commercial stores opened. The lush greenery became dead as industrialization spread. Just like Nanami had said, the accumulation of those little despairs was what made a person an adult.

They visited a small shop which earned a warm look from Yuuji. “This used to sell a killer soft-serve. I spent my whole allowance to eat it that day, but I ate too much… and then threw up.”

“Idiot.” Sukuna chuckled. “It’s good that the shop is closed, or Gojo is going to buy them all and throw up too.”

Yuuji laughed. “Yeah, sensei will definitely do that with his sweet tooth.”

Their next destination was an archery range. Since it was only a fake world, they didn’t have to deal with an employee and immediately grabbed their bows. As someone who had lived in the Heian era, where archery was a skill that people sought to learn, he easily hit the bullseye.

“Hot damn,” Yuuji said as he saw the result. “You’re really good at everything, huh?”

“I spent years practicing real archery,” Sukuna replied as he put down his bow. “Come here, let me fix your posture.”

Yuuji let Sukuna get close and fixed his positioning. The boy had tried Kyudo during middle school, but the sport didn’t really call to him, so he didn’t try too hard. The man started by fixing his posture, which was not straight enough, and then he adjusted the teen’s hold on the bow. 

“Remember to pull the string instead of pushing the bow,” Sukuna explained as he helped the boy. After a bit more prodding, the man allowed the other to shoot his arrow. 

Tack!

It landed on the bullseye.

“I did it!” Yuuji cheered. The boy tried to shoot again, but it missed the red target. “Aw…”

“Kyudo isn’t something you can grasp that easily.” Sukuna lightly hit the boy on the head.

“How did you do it anyway? I thought this sport was only for nobles?” Yuuji asked.

“It was.” Sukuna nodded. “But I was quite bored and tried to master various skills to fill time. Although nobody would teach me, I could learn a lot by simply observing others. When my infamy grew, there were even some nobles who tried to get on my good side by offering to give me various texts and send talented people to serve me.”

They eventually left the archery range to explore other parts of the city. As Yuuji reminisced about his past, the scenery began to shift, and snow began to fall and pile up on the ground. The boy spoke of winter and snow. He told Sukuna how he loved to drink sweet milk tea and how he mistakenly believed Santa existed because he thought snow chains on tires were the sound of bells.

Although exploring this empty city was peaceful, everything had an end. Their tour finally finished when they stopped in the woods. The snow had disappeared, giving way to grounds covered with piles of Ginkgo leaves. The two stared at each other.

“Thanks for listening,” Yuuji said. “It took a while for me to gather my thoughts.”

Sukuna remained silent.

Yuuji continued, “You know when Grandpa got sick, he refused to receive rough treatments to deal with his cancer. Sometimes, I even heard them talk about euthanasia, and I couldn’t understand. As someone with a strong body like me, things like sickness and pain weren’t that present in my life.

“That all changed when I became a sorcerer. Now, death and suffering were looming closer than ever. The first time I felt that was in the detention center. Facing the special grade was scary. It was horrible, and I wanted it to stop. I guess at that moment, I understood a bit. Then, being forced to watch Mahito transfigure Junpei was another type of hurt. I never knew I could feel even more helpless than before.

“After that, Shibuya happened, and I realized how truly weak I was. If you hadn’t been there, many people would’ve died. That was why I promised myself I had to get stronger faster. After our long training, I thought I could do it. I could protect people. But then… I saw Gojo-sensei die. I knew he came back somehow, but seeing him like that broke something in me. Seeing you being used and controlled like a puppet made me angry and desperate…

“I promised myself that I would bring you back. I knew you told me to kill you that first time, but I couldn’t accept it. I guess I was selfish, and I didn’t want to say goodbye to you. But… Sukuna. After seeing your previous life, I think I understand you a little bit more…

“Compared to my childhood, you were dealt a bad hand from the start. While I had a Grandpa who supported me, you had your mother who cursed you. While I had my friends and teachers, you only had people who wanted to kill you.”

“Do not try to excuse the evils I’ve committed, brat,” Sukuna said.

Yuuji shook his head. “No. I’m not excusing you, Sukuna. I just want you to know that I understand. Your life has been so terrible that you grew up feeling apathetic toward everything. While that doesn’t give you the right to kill others, I understand why you are tired. Why keep living when you only feel pain and receive hatred from others? I now know why you keep pushing me and the others away. After seeing your power used by a puppet to hurt our friends, I get why you asked me to kill you. I get why you are so scared.

“I can empathize with dealing with that crushing emotion. For me, it’s my incompetence and weakness, and for you, it is the endless guilt for committing those evils. That’s why…

"I can’t tell you to keep living.”

Hollow Wicker Basket!

The vessel immediately slammed his secondary hands to create a sign the moment his Domain fell apart. Despite being cornered, it didn’t seem like the curse was planning on giving up. Yuuji quickly continued his attack and tried to land a punch, but the enemy slammed his fist into his temple.

The others tried to help, but it was clear that Todo and Yuta were slowing down. The curse immediately switched his target to Todo. With a mighty swing, he landed a critical hit.

Black Flash!

That final attack sent the older teen flying away. When the other fell, he could no longer get up. Satoru tried to break the Hollow Wicker Basket sign, but Sukuna kicked him back. Yuta and Yuuji tried to attack together, but despite only having two hands available, he was able to drive back the older teen. However, that attack gave a chance for Yuuji to punch the curse. 

Yuuji stood over a small Sukuna. The boy was looking up at him with impassive red eyes, waiting for his fate. “Why are you crying?”

Yuuji did not try to rub away the tears that gathered in his eyes. “I know that I said that, but… I’ll be so lonely without you.”

Sukuna kept staring.

“I know it’s selfish, but even now… I still want you around. I’m sure Junpei will be sad not having another film buddy, Fushiguro will also miss talking about flowers with you, and Kugisaki won’t forgive the fact she hasn’t beaten you in a spar yet. Gojo-sensei will be sad, too. He’ll try to hide it, but I know he’ll miss you.”

The boy didn’t reply.

“I’m sorry… I’m not trying to guilt trip you here.” Tears began to flow down. “I’ll really miss you, Sukuna.”

Before Yuuji could continue attacking, he felt several invisible blades cutting him. Shit. Did the vessel just reset his burnt-out technique again?!

“Scale of the Dragon. Recoil. Twin Meteors.”

The sorcerers tensed. Satoru’s eyes widened. Fuck. He could dodge it, but there was no way his students could! 

“Dis-”

Sukuna’s other free hand grabbed the right one. Then, a mouth manifested on the vessel’s cheek. “That is enough.”

Satoru grinned.

Seeing an opening, the three sorcerers restarted their assault. Despite the interruption, the vessel quickly took full control back and defended himself from his enemies. Fists and kicks were desperately thrown, and just as they were about to win, the curse made another sign.

“Domain Expansion.”

Outside the battlefield, Ijichi and Utahime were accompanying Nobara as they made their way into the safehouse where Gojo had been keeping Sukuna’s last finger. After knowing that they had to fight the King of Curses, they knew they could use this cursed object to defeat the vessel. Unfortunately, Uro’s attack had kept Nobara knocked out for the majority of the fight. It was only a few minutes ago that she woke up. Ijichi had actually driven toward this safehouse with an unconscious Nobara in the back. Luckily, the girl finally woke up.

“Ugh, how embarrassing,” Nobara said as she walked toward the finger tied by numerous strings. “How could I miss most of the fight like this? I’ll need to return with a bang then.”

Nobara channeled her cursed energy into her nail. She had temporarily adjusted her skill with a Binding Vow so it would attack the edges of Sukuna’s soul. Of course, the attack would no doubt still hurt the man, but at least it should hopefully help break the barrier holding the curse down.

“Strawdoll Technique: Resonance!”

Just before the vessel could unleash Malevolent Shrine again, black spikes burst out of his torso. The sorcerers grinned at their ally’s help. With a combined punch from Satoru and Yuuji, the Hollow Wicker Basket finally broke. Then, the Domain’s sure-hit attack fully landed on the vessel.

“Soul Dismantle!”

The seals Kenjaku placed weakened significantly. However, the vessel still refused to go down. Yuta quickly blocked a hit from the curse, and Satoru kicked the enemy away. Meanwhile, Yuuji leaped closer to land the final hit that ended this long battle.

BLACK FLASH!

The attack finally ripped the real Sukuna out of his prison and broke Yuuji’s Domain. As the vessel flew back, a black and gold sphere emerged from its wounded chest. The teen quickly grasped it in his hands.

“This is a goodbye then,” Yuuji said as he faced Sukuna one last time.

Sukuna replied, “I’m a curse, brat. It would be best for you to move on with your life without me.”

Yuuji shook his head. “You’re not. All of us were born into this world shouldering curses. Our luck dictates what sort of monster we may turn into. Back then, everybody rejected you and called you a demon and a curse, but you’re not alone anymore.”

Sukuna didn’t say a thing.

Yuuji looked up to stare resolutely at the other. “Even if everyone should reject you again, I’ll be here. Even if no one else will accept you, I’ll live with you.”

The man sighed and closed his eyes. “Always so stubborn.”

As seconds ticked by, Yuuji started to believe the other hadn’t changed his mind. Just as he was about to give a choked goodbye, Sukuna raised his right hand. Golden eyes widened.

“If you are so insistent, then fine,” Sukuna said. “I accept your offer, Itadori Yuuji.”

Yuuji grinned despite the tears in his eyes. He grabbed Sukuna’s hand but pulled the other into a tight hug. The man tensed at the physical contact yet did not resist. Slowly, he raised his hands and hugged back.

“Welcome back.”

Omake:

Sukuna: I'm home.
Notes:

    I don't know if I’m just an emotional person, but I cried while writing this chapter. I’m not joking, do you know how many tissues I wasted?! My kink is loving and supportive relationships (not just romance)!

    Also, I demand an apology from anyone who doubted me! Of course, this fic is gonna have a happy ending!

    FYI: I won't write any react fic. Please stop asking me. I just mentioned that off-hand and never promised to write one. Like I said react fics are too boring to write for me.

Chapter Text

Sukuna woke up slowly. First, he felt himself surrounded by warmth. Then, he heard a distant sound of people talking. Finally, visions of the outside world reached his mind. When he finally became conscious, he realized Yuuji was talking with his friends. Based on his observation, nobody seemed grievously wounded, but they were covered in bandages. The group was drinking various beverages as they discussed all sorts of topics. Unlike the tension he had seen plaguing them these past weeks, all the kids looked relaxed and happy. 

Sukuna had wanted to stay silent longer, but Yuuji quickly noticed him. The boy blinked and stopped talking mid-sentence. The other first years looked at the boy questioningly, but he only closed his eyes to speak with the other inhabitant of his body.

“Sukuna?” Yuuji asked.

“... Brat,” Sukuna replied.

“You’re finally awake!!!” The boy emitted such happiness that even though Sukuna couldn’t see it, he felt that he needed to squint his non-existent eyes.

“You’re too loud.”

“Sorry!” Yuuji tried to whisper, but it didn’t help since they were talking telepathically. “After I took you back, you instantly went to sleep. We’ve been staying at our base since we needed to find the barrier's foundation. I think you’re awake just in time since we just got the news that they may have located it.”

“I see,” Sukuna replied. “What about Angel? Last I saw them, the vessel looked quite rough.”

“Oh, yeah, Hana did lose two of her limbs. We’re wondering if you can heal it?” 

Although Sukuna wanted to stay asleep a bit longer, he knew that a lot of people were hurt after fighting him. Uraume was one example. The monk had lost two of their limbs, too, while trying to save Junpei. “Alright.”

Yuuji easily gave up control over his body and let Sukuna surface. After being suppressed for so long, he couldn’t deny that having flesh was refreshing. When the curse opened his eyes, he was greeted by the first years staring at him.

“What?” Sukuna asked.

“You’re actually awake!” Nobara exclaimed and then scowled. “Ugh, why can’t you stay asleep a few more days? Here, Fushiguro!” 

The black-haired boy accepted the money his friends gave him. “You keep underestimating him.”

“I think it was a bit reasonable he would be unconscious a bit longer,” Junpei defended. “I mean, he was literally acting like a raid boss, and we were attacking him together.”

“Yeah, I also hit him with my Resonance!” Nobara groused. 

“This is Sukuna we’re talking about,” Megumi said as he sipped his drink.

Sukuna narrowed his eyes. “Were you betting on when I was going to wake up?”

“Duh,” the three replied.

“It’s not as if there’s any entertainment in this destroyed city.” Nobara laid back on her seat. “Ugh! I want to go shopping!”

“I’ll need to catch up on some movies when I’m back,” Junpei added.

Megumi only continued to drink his tea.

“Were you also betting?” Sukuna asked Yuuji.

“Of course not! That would be cheating since I can feel you.”

That response implied that the kid definitely would join if he felt that he wouldn’t be cheating. Sukuna rubbed his eyes. “What’s the situation?”

“Nothing much. Things have been calm here, but the Jujutsu society has gone chaotic outside,” Megumi replied.

Nobara slammed her hand on the table excitedly. “Hey! Did you know that Blindfold revealed the existence of sorcerers on the internet? Hahahaha! I’ve seen their comments. It was hilarious.”

“I wonder how the clans and elders are reacting,” Junpei muttered.

“Not well, I assume,” Megumi said. 

“I don’t know much either,” Yuuji pipped up, “but based on Gojo-sensei’s cackle after hearing Ijichi’s report, I’m assuming they’re not doing well.”

Sukuna felt like he had been missing an awful lot of stuff after he got captured. He wondered what topic he should start on but couldn’t decide. In the end, his choice was taken away when Gojo barged into the room.

“Heya! I see our sleepyhead has finally woken up!” Gojo greeted cheerfully.

Sukuna couldn’t help but stare at the white-haired man. Although he had seen the sorcerer return from death, the image of him being cut into two was still fresh in his mind. Despite wanting to avoid this event at all costs, somehow, it still occurred even with his interference. Was it fate? He didn’t know. Yet it seemed that Gojo Satoru had spit on the god of death’s face and returned to the land of living, hale and whole.

“Ai, what’s with that expression?” Gojo asked as he quickly approached the group with his long legs. “Do you miss me?”

When Sukuna didn’t respond, Gojo’s grin became bigger. Seeing his chance, the man didn’t hesitate to try to wrap his arms around the other. While the curse would usually dodge or even hit the other, this time, he didn’t resist when Gojo hugged him. Everyone’s eyes widened. Even Gojo, who had done the act, also froze.

Sukuna meanwhile slowly placed his left hand, which was outside the kids’ vision, on the man’s torso, right where the World Cutting Slash had bisected the sorcerer. Although neither spoke a word, Gojo understood immediately upon feeling the touch.

The first years, on the other hand, sent disgusted looks at their teacher. 

“This is clearly an exploitation of someone who’s mentally distressed,” Nobara said.

“Uncool man,” Junpei added.

“Shameless,” Megumi said.

Gojo only pouted and tightened his hold. “Shut up! I won’t let anyone get between our friendship!”

“This is embarrassing,” Yuuji whined.

Sukuna, meanwhile, was using his cursed energy to examine the man’s body. It seemed whatever healing procedure had been performed had healed the sorcerer. Rest had also helped ease the burden caused by the overuse of the Reverse Cursed Technique. The curse even tried to prod at Gojo’s brain to see whether there was a lasting impact on his brain after forcefully resetting his cursed technique several times. The man would not miss a foreign energy entering his body, yet he didn’t say a thing and let Sukuna continue his examination.

Nobara made a gagging noise. “Disgusting old man! You’re really something, considering Sukuna is older than you.”

“But isn’t Sukuna currently using Yuuji’s body, so technically, he’s also young?” Junpei asked.

“Shameless,” Megumi repeated but with narrowed eyes this time.

The moment Sukuna was sure Gojo was healthy, he immediately knocked the other off him and got up. The man flailed dramatically and tried to capture his target again, but the curse easily dodged him. 

“Where’s Angel?” Sukuna asked the kids.

Megumi got up from his seat. “I’ll bring you to her.”

When the two walked away, Gojo quickly followed behind. This resulted in Nobara and Junpei tagging along. Sukuna felt that the group was too big, considering he was only going to heal a wounded person.

“How’s your sister?” Sukuna asked while ignoring the gaggle of brats behind them.

“Tsumiki didn’t get hurt too badly, and Ieri-san was able to heal her,” Megumi replied. “She hasn’t woken up yet, though…”

Sukuna hummed. “If Ieri said nothing was wrong, then she should be fine, but I can take a look at her if you want.”

Megumi nodded quickly, and a layer of tension dissipated from his shoulders. The boy took them to the makeshift infirmary room where Hana and Tsumiki had been staying. Ieri was sitting at her desk, and the woman only raised an eyebrow when she saw them entering.

Sukuna gave a nod of acknowledgment to the healer while he strode toward Hana, who got tense the moment she saw him. He stopped to examine the girl. Kenjaku really had done a number on her. 

“Ryoumen Sukuna,” Angel said from their manifested mouth.

“Angel,” Sukuna replied. He remembered killing them during his first life. It was nothing personal. They were some of the most formidable sorcerers in that era, and they followed orders from their clan. Sukuna only wanted to fight strong opponents, and so they clashed. Like numerous battles the curse had entered, he came out as the winner.

“I see you truly work with the sorcerers now,” Angel said.

“Working is a bit too much,” Sukuna responded, “I’m merely humoring them.”

“Oh, come on, Sukuna! Your tsundere act won’t work anymore!” Gojo interrupted as he tried to put his arm around the other’s shoulders.

Sukuna tried to elbow the man’s ribs. It landed. 

Gojo pretended to choke and sent a hurt look at him, which the curse ignored. “I’m here to heal your vessel.”

Hana’s eyes widened. She seemed conflicted for a second. On the one hand, she still didn’t trust Sukuna, and on the other hand, the prospect of having a complete set of limbs was a tempting offer.

In the end, it was Angel who replied, “I will keep my eyes on you.”

Sukuna didn’t answer and merely offered an open palm at the girl. Hana gave a hesitant look for a moment before she timidly placed her remaining hand on his. The curse closed his eyes and began examining the girl. He could feel Ieri getting close to watch while the others also kept their eyes on him. Ignoring all distractions, he continued his examination. When he was done, he opened his eyes and said, “This will get hurt.”

Before Hana could respond, Sukuna immediately sent his cursed energy. Similar to healing Todo’s hand, the curse had to reopen the wounds again to start the healing process. He started on her missing arm first and then her leg. When the process was done, the girl looked pale, but she examined her newly grown limbs with awe. Sukuna didn’t even have to tell her before Hana tried to move her hands and legs.

“They’re back!” Hana exclaimed.

“Inform me if you experience any unexpected pain,” Sukuna said. Once his first patient was healed, he turned his attention to Tsumiki. Ieri had completely healed the girl, and there didn’t seem to be anything wrong with her body. When the curse placed his hand on her forehead, he began to probe at her brain.

As expected, after being possessed by Yorozu, there were marks of her time as a vessel. Kenjaku’s tinkering would also affect her life permanently. Sukuna hummed.

“Is there something wrong?” Megumi asked with a frown.

“No, she’s physically fine,” Sukuna replied, “but there is a chance she might develop a cursed technique, and I can almost guarantee she has gained the ability to see curses now.”

Megumi’s face became pinched at that news. The boy had always wished for his sister to live a stable and mundane life. This new ability might cause her unnecessary suffering. 

“Unfortunately, I can’t remove those abilities without risking damaging her brain permanently,” Sukuna continued, “but I can try to encourage her to wake up if you wish.”

Megumi was hesitant at first, but he nodded. Sukuna didn’t waste any time and quickly coaxed Tsumiki's consciousness. After being suppressed by Yorozu for a long time, her soul had gotten used to that state despite being free. The girl could’ve awoken on her own time, but there was no harm in Sukuna speeding the process.

Soft brown eyes revealed themselves as Tsumiki returned to the waking world. Megumi quickly leaned close so his sister could see him. The girl opened her mouth, trying to speak, but her throat was so dry that she could only cough.

Nobara quickly offered her drink, which she was still holding. Tsumiki gratefully accepted it and took several gulps. “Cough… um… Me-megumi?”

Megumi grasped his sister’s hand and choked out. “I’m here.”

Sukuna quickly extracted himself and let those two have their reunion. The others also understood that this was a private matter and left the infirmary. As they exited the room, the curse remembered another person who got wounded badly during the battle.

“Where’s Uraume?” Sukuna asked.

“Oh, they should be in the kitchen,” Junpei replied.

Sukuna frowned. “Didn’t they lose two of their limbs too?”

“Yeah, but they crafted new icy limbs using their power,” Gojo replied. 

“We tried to tell them that they don’t have to take the cooking duty since they’re hurt, but they refused,” Nobara added with a huff.

Sukuna sighed, familiar with his servant’s stubbornness. Just like the others said, they found Uraume working in the kitchen. The curse user immediately looked up when the curse entered. “Sukuna-sama!”

Sukuna held up his hand to stop the monk from kneeling. “There’s no need, Uraume. Why are you still working when you’ve lost your limbs?”

Uraume pursed their lips and, with a lowered head, answered, “I failed to aid you, Sukuna-sama. Despite being the first to enter the battle, I was quickly taken down and couldn’t offer much help. I only managed to figure out this trick once the battle had ended.”

Sukuna quickly grabbed the other’s hand and examined the icy limbs. The ice sculpture was solid and strong, yet it was also terribly cold. It was so cold that it would likely force Uraume to use the Reverse Cursed Technique to negate the frostbite continuously. The curse sighed. “Enough. You were fighting me. It was no wonder that you lost so soundly. Dismiss your technique. I shall heal your wounds now.”

Uraume obeyed his order, and within minutes, they regained their lost limbs. “Thank you, Sukuna-sama.”

Sukuna clicked his tongue. “I was the one who cut off those limbs in the first place.”

“No, it wasn’t you, Sukuna-sama,” Uraume replied stubbornly.

Sukuna’s eye twitched at the daring response, and his annoyance grew when he felt Gojo and the kids nodding along. He wanted to argue back but knew that this would evolve into a meaningless argument.

“Oh! Sukuna-san!” Yuta greeted him when he passed by the kitchen with the other second-year students.

“Finally awake, huh?” Maki said, putting her hand on her hips.

“Tuna Tuna!” Toge added.

“Well, everyone will be glad to hear the news,” Panda commented.

Sukuna examined Yuta and Maki. They didn’t seem particularly hurt, though he could still see bandages peeking out. Beside him, Gojo pipped up, “Yuta-kun! How’s the investigation!”

Yuta smiled. “We’ve found the foundation! As long as Angel can use their Jacob’s Ladder, then the barrier should come down soon.”

Gojo gave a thumbs-up. “Good news! Our helpful healer, Sukuna, has just healed Hana, so we don’t have to worry about limited output anymore!”

“What about Kenjaku?” Sukuna interrupted. The last time he had seen that guy was when he shoved him inside that blasted vessel. That curse user had to use the chaos his rampage caused to try to steal Tengen.

“About that,” Yuta began. They decided to sit in the living room, and the boy began to tell his story about everything that occurred within the central. Sukuna was quite surprised at how some of the events turned out. Although Kenjaku managed to force him to fight the sorcerers in Shinjuku, Japan had gotten off easy compared to canon. Gojo’s decision to completely reveal the Jujutsu world had created great turmoil among the clans, especially with many of the elders being dead, but this chaos might be the chance for the white-haired man to begin his change. 

After hearing the explanation, Sukuna felt the last weight on his shoulders disappear. At that moment, drowsiness crept upon him immediately. Yuuji noticed this and tugged him back inside. It seemed that he still hadn’t fully recovered after the fight and only woke up due to anxiety. Knowing that everyone was safe and Kenjaku defeated, there was nothing holding him back from getting more rest.

Sukuna slept for a long time after that, but he could still notice some events that occurred outside. He heard Yuuji and the others leaving Shinjuku and being confronted by the Japanese officers. He lost consciousness then, but he still heard some fragments of interrogation. It didn’t seem like Yuuji got held up for long since he was a minor. 

When Sukuna fully woke up again, Yuuji had returned to Jujutsu High. The other students were also there, but he couldn’t see Gojo anywhere.

“Gojo-sensei is very busy right now,” Yuuji said.

“After he revealed the Jujutsu society to the public, the government wants to ask some questions,” Megumi replied. “The clans are also putting pressure on him. Since the elders were gone, many sorcerers are looking at sensei as their head.”

“It's his fault that he revealed everything on the Internet,” Nobara groaned as she leaned on her desk.

“It’s not as if we can hide anymore after what happened to Shinjuku,” Junpei said.

Although the kids understood their teacher’s situation, it didn’t change the fact that they no longer had anybody teaching them. While Gojo’s teaching skills were quite questionable at times, he put a lot of effort into nurturing his students. The school should have assigned a temporary teacher to teach the students, but all professional sorcerers in Jujutsu High were very busy dealing with the fallout. Since the Jujutsu society was under heavy scrutiny by the public, the central didn’t dare to approve a lot of missions and send out minors into dangerous situations. While the kids were happy with their sudden free time at first, it didn’t take long for them to begin losing their minds.

“I mean, I’ll be more okay with this if I can go shopping,” Nobara groused, “but Principal Yaga ordered us to stay put.”

“I never expected that I would miss fighting curses,” Junpei added.

Megumi only hummed, but there was a slight furrow in his brow as he flipped through a Jujutsu text he had read before. Yuuji was also listlessly lying down on his desk. The lack of activities was killing the kid since he had so much energy.

“Hey, Sukuna, can’t you help us out?” Yuuji whined.

“What the hell do you expect me to do?” Sukuna asked. Unlike the kids, he had a lot of experience in dealing with boredom. It hadn’t been rare for him to stay cooped up in his estate for a long period. Although he liked fighting, he hated being bothered by people.

“I don’t know. Can you spar with us or something?” Yuuji said. “I mean, you’re also our teacher, so can’t you take over for now?”

“I’m not your teacher,” Sukuna gritted out. 

Nobara perked up at Yuuji’s words. “Oh yeah! Great idea, Potato Head! Come out, Sukuna, I haven’t beaten you yet!”

Megumi and Junpei also looked up in interest. Although technically, they were staring at Yuuji and not directly at Sukuna, the curse could still feel the pressure from them. He tried to ignore them since he had only helped them to prepare them against Kenjaku. Since that brain was gone, there was no point in him helping the young sorcerers.

“Come on, Sukuna,” Yuuji whined as he began to look for the Bunshin Mirror.

‘This fucking brat-’ That was all Sukuna could think of before he was deprived of his safe haven. With the Bunshin Mirror activated, the curse gained a body, which he immediately used to cross his arms. “You dare to demand such a thing from me?”

None of the kids looked threatened at all by the King of Curses’ growls and instead, they began stretching out their muscles. Sukuna’s left eye twitched.

“Aren’t you also tired of getting stuck inside Yuuji’s body all the time?” Junpei asked.

“Come on, some exercise is good for you!” Nobara said.

Megumi just looked at Sukuna expectantly. 

“Yosh! I’m ready!” Yuuji exclaimed as if he had already expected the curse to fold. Sukuna was half-tempted to cut this clone's body into pieces so he would go back inside his vessel. However, he knew the kid would just summon him again with that cursed tool.

Sukuna exhaled harshly and, in the next second, immediately threw a punch at Yuuji. Instead of it hitting, the kid managed to block the attack. 

“Game’s on!” Nobara shouted.

It was chaos from there. The kids had greatly improved after the life-or-death battle against the vessel. Their instinct was sharper, and they had an easier time reading Sukuna’s movement. Although they refrained from using cursed techniques, the first-year students were still able to land some hits on the curse. Sukuna was impressed and decided not to hold back too much.

Despite his earlier protests, the curse ended up dealing with the kids the whole day. He had planned to escape after the spar ended, but then the second-year students showed up. They decided to join in, and somehow, the news reached Yaga’s ears. The next day, he was approached by the sorcerer.

Back then, there was Satoru who had been the main supporter of allowing Sukuna to roam free. Now that the man was busy and absent, it wasn’t strange that the other sorcerers showed their reluctance and wariness. After the Shinjuku disaster, the curse understood why Yaga wanted him to stay away from the young sorcerers. At least, that was what Sukuna expected, but Yaga didn’t throw any threats toward him.

“You should continue teaching them,” Yaga said. “Things have been very hectic, and we’re not sure how long it will take for everything to calm down. It may take weeks, months, or even years. We would greatly appreciate it if you could offer some assistance.”

Instead of waiting for a response, Yaga quickly took his leave. Sukuna could only watch the man’s back with a slightly agape mouth.

“What?” Sukuna croaked out.

And that was how the King of Curses was strong-armed into babysitting duty. Even if he wanted to refuse, the kids wouldn’t stop bothering him. Now that Yuuji could prevent Sukuna from hiding away, he did not stop exploiting that privilege. The curse was tempted to destroy the cursed tool many times.

Sukuna had expected other sorcerers to put a protest, yet no help came from that direction either. When Nanami saw the curse, he only blinked his eyes tiredly and said, “I see.”

Ijichi didn’t seem like he wanted to be anywhere near him, so it was unlikely he would utter any words against the King of Curses. Ieiri only continued smoking when she heard the news, but she didn’t look surprised at all. Since the elders were completely out of the equation, those old fools couldn’t argue either. 

The three big clans were also useless. The Gojo clan was obviously not going to do anything until their head made a move. The Zen’in had been in shambles after losing many of their powerful members. Rumor had it that Naobito had become a complete drunkard after his son’s death. The Kamo also didn’t dare to do anything since they were implicated after the fall of Kenjaku.

So, in short, Sukuna was fucked. He felt like his only path to salvation was the return of Gojo Satoru, but that man would only bring another type of headache into his life. Since he had no escape, he could only stop resisting and follow the flow. Things had stayed relatively peaceful until Christmas arrived.

Sukuna knew the kids were up to something. They might be great sorcerers, but they were shit at lying. It didn’t take long for the curse to find out what they were hiding.

“What’s this? Present?” Sukuna asked as he held the wrapped box.

“AAAAH!” Yuuji shrieked as he tried to grab the item from the man. “You aren’t supposed to see that!”

Sukuna huffed. “Then maybe you should hide it better.”

Yuuji pouted when he finally took back the present. “We plan to surprise you and sensei.”

“You should try to be more discreet then,” Sukuna replied drily. “Hmm. Is Gojo meant to be back soon?”

Yuuji nodded eagerly. “I think so. That’s what I heard, at least.”

Gojo had indeed been very busy. One could argue he was busier than he was when he had to deal with Kenjaku and the Shinjuku crisis. With the elders and two of the three big clans in shambles, Gojo was the sole pillar holding the Jujutsu society together. He also needed to deal with the public and the Japanese government. The last they saw him was on the TV. Although the man had put on some make-up, it wasn’t difficult for Sukuna to see his dark eye bags. 

‘How much sleep has he gotten?’ Sukuna asked. Who the hell was he kidding? The answer was definitely not enough. The curse sighed and said, “I’ll ask Ijichi.”

Although Ijichi was supposed to be the assistant director at Tokyo Jujutsu High, the man was also holding the unofficial title of Gojo’s personal assistant. If you wanted to know where the strongest sorcerer was, you just had to ask Ijichi. 

Sukuna didn’t try to call the man since he knew the other was busy. He did send him a text asking about Gojo’s status. That message remained unanswered until the sun had set. At that point, the kids were starting to believe Gojo wasn’t going to return. While they tried to hide it, it was easy to see they were disappointed. 

Sukuna decided to check his phone, which Yuuji had bought as a ‘welcome gift’ for being the new teacher at Jujutsu High (He had decked the kid for that). The moment he opened his messaging app, he was greeted by desperate replies from Ijichi. Not wanting to ruin the festive mood, he decided to leave the building and called the man.

“What is it?” Sukuna asked.

“Aaaah! Sukuna-san! Please come here!” Ijichi sounded almost hysterical. “It’s Gojo-san!”

Sukuna frowned. “Did he encounter troublesome curses?”

“I would rather it be that case, but no-”

Gojo Satoru was drunk.

That was the pathetic state Sukuna found the man in when he arrived. The white-haired man was leaning on the bench on a, thankfully, empty park. It would be one thing if he sat on the seat, but no, he was sitting on the ground while putting his head on the seat.

The usually bright blue eyes were a bit glazed when he looked at the curse. “Oh, yoooo…. Sukuna. Hic-”

Sukuna wanted to face-palm himself but stopped and resorted to breathing out heavily. “What have you done now?”

“Why?” Gojo whined. “I didn’t do anything… Ummm. Not yet anyway….”

“Why are you drunk?” Sukuna asked.

“I mean, I didn’t plan to be drunk. I just wanted to drink this, see?” Gojo raised the can of beer he was still holding, and Sukuna quickly took it away. It was still quite full. Gojo would, at most, drink two sips of this beverage.

“You fucking lightweight,” Sukuna grumbled and immediately chugged down the alcohol. It didn’t taste that bad, but definitely nowhere near the sake he usually consumed. It certainly wouldn’t be enough to make him drunk. Even if he had to swallow twenty cans of this beverage, he would remain sober. When the can was empty, he crushed it with his hands and threw it into a far away rubbish bin.

Unfortunately, Gojo Satoru might be blessed in a lot of things, but alcohol tolerance was not one of them. The man should already be aware of this and that was why he hated drinking beer.

“Why the hell are you drinking this?” Sukuna asked as he sat on the bench. 

Gojo immediately pressed his forehead against Sukuna’s thigh. “I don’t know. I was feeling a bit… um… tired so….”

“Coffee or tea will work better in this case, idiot,” Sukuna pointed out.

“Yeah… but that’s not the kind of tired I meant,” Gojo replied and patted his chest. “I’m tired here.”

Sukuna went silent. “... Did the government and the clans give you a lot of trouble?”

Gojo giggled. “They certainly tried, but I’m smart, see? I handled them all. Like this!” He wiggled his hands as if he were controlling invisible puppets.

Sukuna snorted. “Sure you are. Can’t count how many times you use your face to fool people on TV.”

“Hehehehe, nobody can resist my face,” Gojo said while batting his long white eyelashes.

“I can think of five people immediately at the top of my head,” Sukuna drily replied. “But sure, good job at fooling those people.”

“Yeah! Good job, me!” Gojo cheered. 

“So why are you so tired then?” Sukuna continued before Gojo could get distracted. 

“Dunno… I’m just feeling it… Hey, do you know today’s date?” Gojo asked.

“December 24.”

Gojo nodded. “It’s Christmas, yeah, but this date is also…”

The sorcerer didn’t have to continue for Sukuna to understand. It was the day of Geto’s death. The day when Gojo had to kill his best friend. The curse sighed.

“Suguru died today, you know,” Gojo continued. “You probably don’t know him, or maybe you do? Kenjaku used his body. I had planned to be the one to put his body to rest, but it ended up being Yuta-kun. Ugh. What a bad teacher I am.”

Sukuna remained silent.

“He wanted to change the world for the better, you know. To stop sorcerers from dying. I don’t know why he changed. He used to care about mundane humans so much, but then he snapped and wanted to kill everyone. I killed him then. Because I have to.”

The two remained silent for some time.

Gojo placed his arm to cover his eyes. “Stupid. How would it even work anyway? Killing all mundane humans? They may not be as strong as us individually, but if the world saw us as a threat, they could’ve just nuked Japan. At that point, everybody would be dead. Idiot.”

The curse still kept his tongue still.

Gojo continued, “Do you think he would be happy if he could see this? The Jujutsu society is starting to change now. Without those old fools in power, things will change.” He sighed. “At least, I hope so.”

“I don’t know,” Sukuna replied. “I’ve never known the man, and even if I do, I won’t pretend to know what the deceased would think.” Gojo pouted, on the edge of protesting about the shitty words of comfort. The curse pushed on, “But, I believe your students will appreciate the fact that they don’t have to sacrifice their lives for those elders who never value them as humans. In fact.” The curse stood up. “I know about it since they’ve been planning to surprise you today. At least that was the plan until you failed to show up.”

Gojo blinked and sat up straighter. “What?”

Sukuna rolled his eyes. “Are you planning on staying here the whole night?”

“No, of course not,” Gojo replied and glanced at the location of Ijichi’s car at the edge of the park. It was quite a walk for someone as drunk as Gojo. The man turned his attention to Sukuna and raised his hands. “Up.”

Sukuna felt his eyes twitched. “The fuck?”

“Up.”

Sukuna felt that this was a ridiculous request that even Gojo would not normally consider. Unfortunately, the man was drunk, and clearly, his brain was a bit broken at the moment. “I will share this pathetic moment with your students. I promise you this.”

Gojo only stared up resolutely, ignoring the threat. It seemed he refused to move unless Sukuna folded to his whims. The curse sighed deeply and finally relented. Although he could easily carry the man, the position was still quite awkward since he was much shorter than the sorcerer.

“Why are you so short?” Gojo complained as he wrapped his arms around Sukuna’s neck.

“I’m taller than you in my true form, you imbecile.”

Gojo stuck out his tongue. “Yeah, not right now, though.”

Sukuna was tempted to let the man fall but refrained since he wanted to act more maturely than a drunk Gojo Satoru. Thankfully, the park was empty except for Ijichi, who looked mortified at having to witness the sorcerer being carried on Sukuna’s back like a child. The man himself didn’t look bothered at all and continued to boss Sukuna around.

The curse lost his patience and harshly dumped the man in the back seat before sitting beside the driver. “Move.”

Ijichi nodded quickly and followed the annoyed King of Curses’ order. The journey back to Jujutsu High wasn’t that long, but it seemed to be enough to clear some of the alcohol from Gojo’s system. Sukuna threw a bottle of water at the man. “Drink.”

Gojo scrunched his nose at the plain water. Clearly, hoping for a sugary drink. However, the harsh glare from the curse made the man relent, and he sulkily drank the water his body desperately needed.

“How much sleep has he gotten these days?” Sukuna asked Ijichi.

Ijichi flinched at suddenly being addressed by the curse but replied, “I-I’m not sure but I have never seen him sleep at all.”

“That’s because I haven’t!” Gojo cheerfully replied. “Too many people wanted my attention, so I couldn’t have rest, you know.”

Sukuna felt that it shouldn’t be something one answered so blithely, but he was talking to a sleep-deprived person here. He sighed again. Damn it. How many times had he done that tonight? 

“Maybe you should skip the party,” Sukuna muttered. The guy needed the rest.

“No way!” Gojo protested and tried to slap the curse’s face. “I won’t let you stop me from meeting my students!”

Sukuna easily dodged the pathetic attack and pushed the man back. “Lay down, or you may make yourself puke.”

Gojo didn’t have the strength to struggle and fell down like paper. A pitiful groan came from the back a second later.

“What did I say?” Sukuna said. “If you insist, then fine, but you still need to go to bed at twelve and wake up at eight at the earliest. You better follow that order, or I’ll make you go to bed myself.”

“Yes, father,” Gojo replied.

Ijichi stiffened when he saw Sukuna’s hand twitched. ‘Please stop talking, Gojo-san!’

Thankfully, they didn’t encounter any issues during the drive back. When the car arrived at Jujutsu High, Gojo looked slightly better. He was still quite wobbly on his feet, so Sukuna had to stabilize him.

“I’m not skipping the party,” Gojo insisted when he caught Sukuna’s squinted eyes.

“I know you won’t, you stubborn mule,” Sukuna replied.

Gojo raised his nose haughtily. “Excuse you, I’m a beautiful mule.”

Sukuna didn’t give a response and herded the man into the room where the party should be held. The lack of lighting inside didn’t bother the two since they could easily detect the excited energies from a group of people inside. When Gojo opened the door, the light immediately came back on, and numerous confetti from several party poppers rained down on him.

“Happy belated birthday, Gojo-sensei!” the students shouted. Technically, it wasn’t just the students. Sukuna could also see Nanami, Ieri, and Yaga in the back. 

“We know it’s very late,” Yuuji quickly explained, “but since you were so busy this month, we thought that celebrating it during Christmas Eve should be fine.”

“We even made a cake!” Junpei exclaimed.

“Do you know how many hours we spent decorating this place?” Nobara asked.

“I hope you like it, sensei!” Yuta said brightly.

“Be grateful,” Megumi added.

“Tuna Tuna!” Toge exclaimed.

“You sure took your time,” Maki complained.

“I’m hungry,” Panda said when his stomach rumbled.

Gojo stared blankly at the group for several seconds. Then, tears began to fall down. Everyone’s face became shocked and white as a sheet.

“AAAAH!” Nobara screamed. “Why is he crying?!”

“Did he get cursed?” Megumi wondered as he made a sign to summon Divine Dog.

“I’m sorry, sensei!” Yuuji and Yuta shouted simultaneously.

The others could only stare back in horror at the sight of the strongest sorcerer crying. 

Ieri laughed. “Congratulations, you broke him.”

Nanami pulled off his glasses to rub his eyes tiredly while Yaga sighed.

Sukuna immediately took a step forward as he rolled his eyes. “No. He’s just sleep-deprived. This isn’t the first time it has happened.”

“What? Are you saying he has cried in front of you?!” Nobara asked.

Sukuna ignored the question in favor of shoving several tissues on Gojo’s face. “Che, how unsightly.”

Gojo blew his nose several times and wiped his eyes. Although he had stopped crying, his red eyes and rumpled face made him look even more pitiful. “I’m fine, I don’t need sleep.”

Sukuna narrowed his eyes. “You better be in bed at twelve, or I’m telling your students what you just did.”

“What? What is it? I smell good gossip here!” Nobara said.

“That depends on whether or not this manchild follows his promise,” Sukuna replied and took a seat.

Yuuji and Yuta still fussed over their teacher like overbearing parents, while Megumi still looked like he wanted to summon his shikigami. Junpei has his phone out to record the whole thing.

“I’m really fine!” Gojo gave a reassuring smile to his students. 

Yuta and Yuuji continued to look doubtful but stopped their fussing. They still hovered near the man, though, as if expecting him to fall down at any time. 

“Aw! Thanks for celebrating my birthday. I don’t remember the last time someone did something like this for me!” Gojo said.

Nanami fixed his glasses and replied, “I believe you said that you hated birthday parties because they were a waste of time.”

Gojo pouted. “Of course, it’s not the same, Nanamin. This is from my cute students!”

The man twitched at the nickname. 

Despite the stumbling start, the party continued wonderfully. Gojo quickly returned to his usual cheerful self. Since everyone was hungry, they decided to start eating first. There were all sorts of food on the table and everyone got their share. When that was done, the kids quickly piled up their gifts on their teacher. Sukuna also got some but he opened his gifts without any flair, unlike the sorcerer. Once the gift-giving was done, the students suggested playing some games to spend the rest of the night.

“That’s right! I haven’t gotten my rematch yet!” Gojo pointed his finger at Sukuna. “You better not run away again.”

Sukuna only rolled his eyes and humored his whims. They fought several matches, but it seemed the lack of sleep only fueled Gojo’s mania, which made him hyperfocus. The two of them kept beating each other, and the curse almost lost track of time. When he took a glance at the clock on the wall, he immediately dropped his control. 

“Alright, that’s enough,” Sukuna said. “You need to go to bed.” Gojo pouted, unwilling to follow on his promise since he had just lost the last match. The curse narrowed his eyes. “I’ll share the pathetic sight you’ve just made at the park if you don’t.”

Nobara caught the hissed threat and exclaimed, “What is it?! Tell me! Spill the tea!” 

Gojo pondered over whether he was fine with his students knowing his drunk acts just because he wanted to beat Sukuna in Mario Kart. In the end, the man sighed. “Fine~”

Nobara groaned in disappointment. The others were also curious but decided not to push it.

Sukuna decided to follow the man to ensure he wouldn’t slink away into the night. The other stayed in the living room to continue playing. Yuta and Yuuji had wanted to follow, but the curse had shaken his head, and they had relented.  

As the two men walked in the empty hallway, Gojo commented, “That was fun.”

Sukuna hummed.

“I heard that you’ve been taking over my role as a teacher,” Gojo continued.

“Not by my own choice,” Sukuna grumbled.

Gojo laughed. “Is it so bad? I think you’re a pretty great teacher. Maybe you should take over the first-year students. Kusakabe has been bugging me about being a bad teacher for beginners so I’ve been considering mentoring third-year instead. Since we only have two full-time teachers, you can take the empty spot.”

Sukuna scoffed. “Do you hear yourself? I’m a curse. Do you expect me to teach young sorcerers?”

Gojo stopped walking and turned around to look at the other. “Do you think anyone has been considering you as one?”

Sukuna crossed his arms. “Anyone with a sound mind should. I’m the King of Curses, after all.”

Gojo rolled his eyes. “Sure you are. But I’m also pretty sure that no curse would fold like a pathetic piece of paper under the earnest eyes of teenagers.”

Sukuna narrowed his eyes. “What are you saying?”

“What I’ve been saying this whole time.” Gojo shrugged. “Your tsundere acts won’t work anymore, Sukuna. I and everyone know that you care. So why don’t you stop pretending?”

Sukuna didn’t reply and only glared back.

Gojo tutted. “You know, that ferocious expression of yours just reminds me of a kitten.”

Sukuna was itching to bite the man’s hand because of those words, but he only growled. “Shut up.” Instead of continuing to interact, he decided to turn around and walk away.

Gojo chuckled. “You’re just proving my point!”

That guy had better go to his room obediently.

Sukuna decided to roam Jujutsu High that night. He knew that if he met Yuuji, the boy would easily notice his disturbed mind. Since he didn’t want to deal with more prodding, he opted to climb one of the roofs to gaze at the night sky. 

Uraume found him not long after. The monk was holding a tray filled with tea and snacks. “Sukuna-sama.”

“Uraume,” Sukuna said.

The curse user offered a cup of tea, which Sukuna accepted. It tasted just like he remembered. After another round of silence, Sukuna asked, “Have you not changed your mind?”

“I have not,” Uraume replied. “I’ll always follow you, Sukuna-sama.”

Sukuna clicked his tongue and took another sip. “With Kenjaku’s death, the future will likely become a peaceful era. Things will get very boring.”

Uraume didn’t say anything for a moment. “... I doubt that will be the case.”

Sukuna raised an eyebrow in askance.

The monk gave a small smile. “This is merely the result of my observation, but you seem to enjoy mentoring those young sorcerers.”

Sukuna groaned. “Not you, too. Did Gojo send you here?”

“I only follow your orders, Sukuna-sama.”

Sukuna sighed. “But you sure sound like that man.”

“Perhaps we merely see the same thing,” Uraume replied serenely.

Sukuna didn’t give a reply, and the two watched the moon the whole night. When morning arrived, the curse decided to check on Gojo’s room. He stood in the yard and stopped beside the wall of the man’s chamber. Although the window was covered, he could feel the other’s calm presence inside. Good. He was still asleep.

Before he could leave, a person caught him. “Sukuna?” It was Yuuji who was having his morning jog. Sukuna continued walking, not wanting to have a conversation near Gojo. The boy followed him and asked, “Were you checking on sensei? Don’t worry, we kept an eye out too and everyone is sure he’s sleeping properly.”

“I’m not,” Sukuna groused.

Yuuji only smiled back, not believing him one bit. “Why didn’t you return last night? I wanted to compete with you, too.”

“I have better things to do,” Sukuna replied.

Yuuji looked at him for several seconds and said, “Something is bothering you.”

Sukuna closed his eyes. This brat could easily read him like an open book. How annoying. “It’s nothing. Gojo just said something stupid yesterday.”

The boy tilted his head. “What is it?”

Sukuna could remain silent, but Yuuji was a stubborn brat who would get his answer one way or another. “He just said I’m a good teacher.”

Yuuji blinked in confusion. “But you are?”

“I’m not,” Sukuna replied. “And I’m a curse.”

Yuuji stopped walking, and Sukuna followed him. The two halted near the edge of the forest that surrounded Jujutsu High. 

“You’re not a curse, Sukuna,” Yuuji said. “Didn’t I tell you that?”

“Only curses can return from the dead after turning themselves into cursed objects,” Sukuna explained.

“That’s just technicalities,” Yuuji replied, “but I don’t think you are.”

“What? You think you can reject reality just because you dislike it?” Sukuna asked.

“I think you’re the one who’s being stupid,” Yuuji shot back.

Sukuna glared at the kid. The audacity. He was a genius who mastered Jujutsu by mere observation. He was not an idiot.

Yuuji smiled softly. “It’s okay. I understand, though. It’s hard, right? Showing others that you care. Even I struggle with it sometimes. It can be very scary, so I get it.” The kid took several steps closer to grasp the other’s hand. “I’m here though. You’re not alone.”

“I’m not a kid, brat,” Sukuna replied but didn’t take his hand away from Yuuji’s grasp. The two began to walk into the woods. Neither said a thing as they listened to the sounds of nature. They stopped beside a small stream, and the man said, “Gojo told me he wanted me to teach first-year students.”

Yuuji beamed. “That’s a great idea!”

Sukuna rolled his eyes. “You don’t even stop to consider, idiot. We’re a package deal I’ve to go where you go. Even Bunshin Mirror has limits, and I can’t be away from you for too long.”

“That’s fine, I don’t mind staying in Tokyo,” Yuuji said. “Hmm. Do you think I can help you teach too? That sounds fun!”

Sukuna could only stare at the kid exasperatedly. “What makes you think that I’ll accept? And even if I do, how can the sorcerers accept a curse teaching in Jujutsu High? You guys don’t count since all of you seem to have brain damage.”

“Is this what you’ve been worrying about?” Yuuji asked. “Don’t worry. You may seem scary at first, but it’s not hard to see that you’re actually nice!”

Sukuna felt like he could roll his eyes to the back of his head at this point. “Don’t be ridiculous.”

“I’m not, though,” Yuuji said. “If you want to do this, then I’ll support you. Didn’t I say that I won’t leave you alone?” The boy tightened his grasp. “Anyway, I also think it’ll be good for you. I don’t want you to stay stuck inside forever. At least with this job, you can go out, right? Not that I think you can’t just go out whenever, but you seem to have this belief that you need to stay inside unless there is something that requires your attention.”

Sukuna scoffed. “Idiot.”

Yuuji only grinned back. 

The two stayed there for several minutes before they headed back to Jujutsu High. At that point, Gojo had finally woken up from his sleep and was now bothering the other students. The man quickly turned his attention to them when they showed up, though.

“And here are my favorite student and fellow teacher!” Gojo cheered as he glomped Yuuji. He tried to take Sukuna, too, but the man dodged him.

“I haven’t agreed to anything,” Sukuna replied.

“Not yet,” Gojo amended.

Sukuna sighed. “Give it your best shot then.”

Gojo grinned wildly.

Chapter Text

Title: In Search of That Blue Sky

    Itadori Ryou wasn’t supposed to exist. Yet he was born as the older twin brother of Itadori Yuuji. He knew this wasn’t where he was supposed to be. After all, he had seen the future of this world, and he had lived twice. In his first life, which he had almost forgotten completely, he was just a normal person who read this story. In his second life, he became the dreaded King of Curses. He remembered he had split himself into twenty fingers, so why the hell was he still reincarnated as a human again?

    Also, how the heck did he just meet a wild gremlin child named Gojo Satoru?

Notes:

    I lived bitch!

    This is NOT a sequel to A Gentler World!

    FYI: I won't write any react fic. Please stop asking me. I just mentioned that off-hand and never promised to write one. Like I said react fics are too boring to write for me.

Chapter 37
Chapter Text

Hi guys! I know this is unexpected, but I just wanted to share that I’ve started my own original webnovel. If you like my writing and have actually finished reading over 100k fics like this one, I think you might enjoy another one of my works too.

This one also doesn't have romance. It's about found family, friendship, and a healthy dose of angst, lol. You can read it for free, by the way! Just please leave a comment to help keep me motivated, lol.

It's called Another Path Taken. Here’s the synopsis! I also plan to turn it into a webtoon soon.

 

    Auren wanted a quiet life. Maybe hunt a few Starfiends, nap under the sun, and leave the whole saving the world thing to someone else. He’s done playing the hero. Unfortunately, fate and whatever cosmic force hates him seem to have other plans.

    Now he’s stuck with three disasters in human form.

    Alwyn is a grumpy kid with a vengeance streak and a secret. He’s a regressor reliving his life.

    Erika is a sharp-tongued opportunist obsessed with wealth, stuck with a mysterious system she can't seem to shake.

    Han is a cheerful airhead with suspiciously sharp combat skills, and as it turns out, he’s also a transmigrator.

    And then there’s Auren himself, a reincarnator saddled with all his memories and none of the peace he hoped for.

    Peaceful life? Not happening.

    Saving the world? Apparently back on the table.
